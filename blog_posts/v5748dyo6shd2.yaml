  description\">I joined Paizo’s Organized Play team in September 2015. Looking back\
  \ over the past 5 years, I’ve collected several happy memories, made wonderful friends,\
  \ and achieved important milestones. I’ve also learned a few hard lessons in communication\
  \ and process implementation along the way. I’ve cried with some of you, laughed\
  \ with more of you, and would happily do it all over again if I could.</p> \n  \
  \   <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p>Before accepting my position, I served as an Organized\
  \ Play volunteer for 2 years. Some of the best gaming experiences I’ve ever had\
  \ occurred while volunteering. I met people from around the globe, attended Gen\
  \ Con—talk about crossing an item off my bucket list!—and sparked enthusiasm among\
  \ my fellow gamers. I believe that volunteering brings people who love games even\
  \ closer together. If you want to experience the benefits of serving as an Organized\
  \ Play volunteer firsthand, check out our blog from last week on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcr?Volunteering-with-the-Organized-Play-Foundation\"\
  >how to volunteer with the Organized Play Foundation</a>. </p> \n     <h2>Sanctioning</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>While no new character options were sanctioned in the past month, you\
  \ can now earn Organized Play credit for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcm?Free-RPG-Day-adventures-now-on-paizocom\"\
  >Paizo’s Free RPG Day adventures</a>: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024ys?Pathfinder-Adventure-Little-Trouble-in-Big-Absalom\"\
  >Little Trouble in Big Absalom</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024yr?Starfinder-Adventure-Skitter-Home\"\
  >Skitter Home</a>. Such credit can be retroactively earned from games played on\
  \ Free RPG Day. GMs should contact their players to issue chronicle sheets.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Last week, James Case also <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcs?Rarity-and-Availability-in-Organized-Play\"\
  >wrote a blog</a> explaining how rarity and access in Pathfinder Second Edition\
  \ works in Pathfinder Society play. James’s thoughts should help explain our philosophy\
  \ on less common options.</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>Looking forward, we are actively\
  \ working on three Adventure Paths: <em>Tyrant’s Grasp, Extinction Curse</em>, and\
  \ <em>Threefold Conspiracy</em>. As we finish them, we will update you in future\
  \ blogs.</p> \n     <h2>Guides</h2> \n     <p>To avoid conflict with the conventions\
  \ this weekend, we scheduled the <em>Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society</em>\
  \ upload for next week. An upcoming blog post will summarize the changes.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The <em>Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society</em> is being actively\
  \ revised and has an estimated publication date of September 15th. It will once\
  \ again be housed online and we intend to provide a downloadable option as well.\
  \ We will post the links in a blog once they are live.</p> \n     <p>Finally, the\
  \ <em>Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</em> is in the\
  \ works and should be posted shortly. There are no program changes for Year 7, but\
  \ we plan to include the adventure deck options first published in blogs so we have\
  \ all the options in one place.</p> \n     <h2>Achievement Points (AcP)</h2> \n\
  \     <p>It’s been three weeks since ya looked at me, cocked your head to the side,\
  \ and... oh wait, this isn’t the place for singing songs. Focus!</p> \n     <p>We\
  \ launched the boon purchase part of AcP just before Gen Con and are busy working\
  \ out the bugs. The first step was to move the chronicle boons from the Year of\
  \ the Open Road into the system so that we had digital versions as well as paper\
  \ ones. This has caused some oddities to pop up, such as Chronicle Boon points appearing\
  \ in the point total section. We are pausing the input process while we track down\
  \ some of these number issues. Hopefully, fixing them will resolve the residual\
  \ AcP challenges as well.</p> \n     <h2>Volunteer Recognition</h2> \n     <p>We\
  \ awarded one new Campaign Coin at PaizoCon Francia this month. The following recipient\
  \ is one of the longtime members of the Swiss venture-crew responsible for organizing\
  \ many events. Congratulations to…</p> \n     <p>Christopher Clark <b>839</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Thank you for all the effort you put into Organized Play, Christopher!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Stars/Novas/Glyphs</h2> \n     <p>One GM received their fifth star\
  \ in the last month. Doing so indicates a commitment to Organized Play, as to achieve\
  \ this milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios\
  \ and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative\
  \ estimate of the time needed to reach five stars is 650 hours!</p> \n     <p>Congratulations\
  \ to <b>Patrick Berndt</b> for earning their fifth star!</p> \n     <p>All five-star\
  \ GMs should now see their stars listed by their name on the forums, as well as\
  \ in their My Organized Play tab. If you are a five-star GM and your status is not\
  \ visible on the forums, please email organizedplay [at] paizo [dot] com and let\
  \ us know!</p> \n     <p>We’re working through some technical snags before we can\
  \ get caught up on our five-nova GMs, but we hope to have them ironed out soon.\
  \ We’re also watching the climb to five glyphs with great interest, as many GMs\
  \ have taken advantage of the online environment.</p> \n     <p>There’s been some\
  \ discussion about the requirements for evaluation games, so we want to clarify.\
  \ Two main points. One, GMs should work with their RVC to get their evaluations\
  \ completed in a method that works for the GM. If the RVC is not responsive, please\
  \ reach out to the OP team for assistance. Two, the GM should complete the reviews\
  \ in their usual medium, but if circumstances don’t allow, then they should choose\
  \ a different platform they feel comfortable with – VTT, webcam, slides, etc. Any\
  \ RVC/VC comfortable completing an evaluation in the GMs chosen method may do so.\
  \ There is one caveat to this second piece. A GM should only ask the Online region\
  \ RVC/VCs to evaluate one of their games. </p> \n     <p>We think this will cover\
  \ most issues, but if it does not, please communicate with either your RVC or the\
  \ org play team so that we can find a solution to your particular issue. We cannot\
  \ write rules to cover every corner case, but we can work to find a way around impediments.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Finally, there is a known bug where glyphs don’t display next to a username\
  \ in the forums. We’ve asked the tech team to address this issue. Thank you to those\
  \ who reached out to let us know there is a problem.</p> \n     <h2>Convention Listing</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>If you don’t see a convention on the list that you think should be there,\
  \ contact the event organizer and ask them to register their event for Organized\
  \ Play support!</p> \n     <table width=\"95%\"> \n      <thead style=\"text-align:left;\"\
