  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Juneteenth is a holiday that doesn’t get the\
  \ recognition or celebration it deserves. We celebrate the Emancipation Proclamation\
  \ as when enslaved African Americans were freed in the United States. But the road\
  \ there was a lot more complicated—emancipation took years to happen. Juneteenth\
  \ is the day we celebrate the true end of slavery in the US, or at least the day\
  \ the last of the slaves in the country were told that they were free, which came\
  \ more than two and¬ a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued.\
  \ This Juneteenth, we wanted to take the time to introduce the holiday to those\
  \ who may not be as familiar with it.</p> \n     <p>On September 22, 1862, President\
  \ Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January\
  \ 1, 1863. This was one of the most important moments in our nation’s history, but\
  \ despite what we may have learned in school, this wasn’t the end of slavery. Particularly\
  \ in states still in rebellion, the only freedom was in escaping to the Union, a\
  \ tremendously dangerous journey. It wasn’t until the end of the Civil War that\
  \ the Confederate states were forced to comply with the newly ratified Thirteenth\
  \ Amendment (which was passed in January of 1865, but didn’t go into effect until\
  \ December of that year). Even then, the news traveled slowly, and some states refused\
  \ to even tell slaves that they were free. It wasn’t until Texas, the last holdout,\
  \ finally complied that the slavery in the United States of the time came to an\
  \ end (though modern-day slavery that disproportionally targets Black people still\
  \ exists through our prison system and laws that allow it as punishment for crimes).\
  \ On June 19th, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger issued the following order to\
  \ the people of Texas:</p> \n     <blockquote>\n      <p></p>“The people of Texas\
  \ are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the\
  \ United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal\
  \ rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection\
  \ heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.\
  \ The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for\
  \ wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military\
  \ posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”\
  \n      <p></p> \n      <p style=\"text-align:right\">—General Order No. 3; Galveston\
  \ Texas, June 19, 1865<br> <a href=\"https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/juneteenth.html\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/juneteenth.html</a></p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Growing up outside the Black community, I was taught\
  \ that the Emancipation Proclamation was the end of slavery. It wasn’t. It’s easy\
  \ for many of us to think that emancipation happened quickly and easily. It didn’\
  t. It took over two and half years after the proclamation for the enslaved people\
  \ of Texas to be freed—and to this day, we are still struggling with the horrific\
  \ legacy of slavery, and the treatment of the Black community is far from equal.\
  \ This second—and in my opinion the true, Independence Day—should always have been\
  \ a major national holiday. It is one of the most important days in our history,\
  \ yet we as a nation have mostly, predictably, either forgotten or refused to celebrate\
  \ it. Thankfully, that’s slowly starting to change. Today, 47 states have recognized\
  \ Juneteenth as a state holiday or day of remembrance. But it has yet to become\
  \ a major national holiday. </p> \n     <p>If you’d like to read more about Juneteenth,\
