  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hey there everybody. As of today, we're\
  \ just about halfway through the spotlight period of the <i>Doomsday Dawn </i>adventure,\
  \ and while we still have many months to go before the end of the playtest period,\
  \ we've learned a lot in the past two months!</p> \n     <p>First and foremost,\
  \ thank you for your participation! We could not do this without you. Your feedback\
  \ has been vital in telling us where the game needs work, and we're looking forward\
  \ to seeing what you uncover in the last parts of the adventure. I'd also like to\
  \ take this opportunity to remind you that if you haven't played up through Part\
  \ 3 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, you have nothing to fear. The surveys for all of the\
  \ previous parts are still open, and there's still much more for us to learn from\
  \ your input.</p> \n     <h2>What Are Our Goals?</h2> \n     <p>In the past few\
  \ months, the design team has been on just about every different news and interview\
  \ forum out there. We've talked about the changes we've made and why we made them.\
  \ We've talked about where we wanted to go and why we wanted to take the game there;\
  \ but in all the rush, we've realized that the one place where we haven't categorically\
  \ stated our goals is right here, in this blog. So without further delay, here are\
  \ our primary goals for the playtest.</p> \n     <ol> \n      <li>Create a new edition\
  \ of Pathfinder that's much simpler to learn and play—a core system that's easy\
  \ to grasp but expandable—while remaining true to the spirit of what makes Pathfinder\
  \ great: customization, flexibility of story, and rules that reward those who take\
  \ the time to master them.</li> \n      <li>Ensure that the new version of the game\
  \ allows us to tell the same stories and share in the same worlds as the previous\
  \ edition, but also makes room for new stories and new worlds wherever possible.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Work to incorporate the innovations of the past decade into the core\
  \ engine of the game, allowing the best rules elements and discoveries we've made\
  \ to have an integrated home in the new system (even if they aren't present in the\
  \ initial book).</li> \n      <li>Forge a more balanced play environment where every\
  \ character has a chance to contribute to the adventure in a meaningful way by allowing\
  \ characters to thrive in their defined role. Encourage characters to play to their\
  \ strengths, while working with others to bolster their place in the group.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Make Pathfinder a game that's open and welcoming to all, no matter\
  \ their background or experience.</li> \n     </ol> \n     <p>There are plenty of\
  \ other things that are important to us as we work to create a new edition of Pathfinder,\
  \ but these points are some of our strongest motivators. I think it's important\
  \ to note that these are guidelines and not necessarily listed in order of importance.\
  \ Furthermore, a guideline might be more important in some parts of the game than\
  \ it is in others. When making something this challenging, it's very useful to give\
  \ yourself guiding principles, while also understanding that you're never going\
  \ to be 100% perfect. In any case, for those of you who were interested in why the\
  \ game has changed in the ways that it has, we hope that laying out our goals for\
  \ the process can help you understand our decisions.</p> \n     <h2>MORE Surveys</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>The surveys never end here at Paizo, and this week is no exception.\
  \ We have been incredibly pleased by the results from the <i>Doomsday Dawn</i> surveys\
  \ as well as the more general surveys we launched two weeks ago looking at <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9c?Ancestry-and-Class-Surveys\">ancestries, backgrounds,\
  \ and classes</a>. Today we'd like to open up two more general surveys.</p> \n \
  \    <p>The first is focused on the general rules for playing the Pathfinder RPG.\
  \ This survey is a large one, going over a wide range of topics and touching on\
  \ nearly every chapter in the <em><a href=\"/store/pathfinder/playtest\">Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Rulebook</a></em>. Set aside about an hour for this survey if you can,\
  \ and make sure to go all the way to the end if you want your results to count.</p>\
  \ \n     <p style=\"text-align:center;margin:2rem;\"><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPRules\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Rules Survey</a> | <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPOpRules\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Open Rules Survey</a></p> \n     <p>The second survey takes\
  \ a look at the monsters in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Bestiary</em>. We want to\
  \ see what you thought about the stats in that PDF and how they were presented.</p>\

  \ it for this week. Make sure to stop back in here next week for Update 1.4 and\
  \ the start of Part 5 of the <i>Doomsday Dawn </i>playtest!</p> \n     <p>Jason\
  \ Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p> \n     <p><i>Join the Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest designers every Friday throughout the playtest on our <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
