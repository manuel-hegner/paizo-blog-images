  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, September 29, 2011</p> \n    <p>The relationship\
  \ and romance rules presented in the <i>Jade Regent Player’s Guide</i> have proven\
  \ to be a popular addition to the Jade Regent Adventure Path—so much so that people\
  \ have been clamoring for relationship rules for other characters in the Adventure\
  \ Path beyond the four main NPCs presented in <i>Pathfinder</i> #49.</p> \n    <p>Although\
  \ you can always come up with your own romance and relationship statistics for any\
  \ NPC in any adventure, we’ve taken two characters from Pathfinder <i>Adventure\
  \ Path #49: The Brinewall Legacy</i> and <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #50: Night\
  \ of Frozen Shadows</i>—Kelda Oxgutter and Ulf Gormundr—and are presenting their\
  \ official relationship info here. As usual, relationships with these characters\
  \ can be either friendly or competitive, and can lead to gaining an NPC’s devotion,\
  \ or their enmity. See pages 13–15 of the <i>Jade Regent Player’s Guide</i> for\
  \ a full explanation of these rules and their use in the Jade Regent Adventure Path.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Kelda Oxgutter</h2> \n    <p>Although Kelda is scheduled to take her\
  \ leave of the PCs once they reach Kalsgard, if they work hard at building relationships\
  \ with her, she may stay on indefinitely.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Preferred\
  \ Gifts:</b> armor, shields, or weapons, fine furs, epic sagas of heroism and battle<br>\
  \ <b>Hated Insults:</b> questioning her prowess in battle, joking about her capture,\
  \ sexist comments<br> <b>Devotion Boon:</b> Kelda’s fast footwork and speed in battle\
  \ has inspired you to quickness in combat as well. Once per game session, you may\
  \ gain a 5-foot enhancement bonus to your speed as a swift action, regardless of\
  \ the distance between you and Kelda. Once activated, this bonus persists for a\
  \ number of rounds equal to your Relationship Score with Kelda divided by 10 (rounded\
  \ down).<br> <b>Enmity Boon:</b> Kelda can be close-lipped and somewhat stiff, but\
  \ you have to admit that she is strong-willed, and held up surprisingly well in\
  \ captivity. You’re determined to prove that you’re just as stubborn as she is,\
  \ and gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear and enchantment effects.<br>\
  \ <b>Romance Score:</b> 36</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br> Illustration by Wayne Reynolds\n    </div> \n    <h2>Ulf Gormundr</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Ulf is strictly professional, and usually avoids relationships with his\
  \ employers, but it is possible that Ulf might warm to someone who truly puts time\
  \ and effort into building a friendship with the surly and notoriously difficult\
  \ Ulfen guide.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Preferred Gifts:</b> scrimshaw\
  \ artworks, strong liquor, survival gear<br> <b>Hated Insults:</b> abuse of authority,\
  \ questioning his guidance or his survival skills, racist comments about the Varki\
  \ or about half-breeds in general<br> <b>Devotion Boon:</b> Ulf’s devotion to his\
  \ friends, even in the face of overwhelming adversity, is truly an inspiration.\
  \ You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against an opponent\
  \ that has just successfully attacked one of your allies in combat. This bonus lasts\
  \ for 1 round after the opponent’s attack.<br> <b>Enmity Boon:</b> It’s easy to\
  \ push Ulf’s buttons and make him mad, and there’s nothing that angers him more\
  \ than someone who doesn’t follow his advice on surviving in harsh environments.\
  \ Of course, to know what not to do, you’ve had to listen attentively to his lectures,\
  \ and have picked up more than a few pointers as a result. Choose one terrain type\
  \ from the list of ranger favored terrains. You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks\
  \ and Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when you are in that terrain, regardless\
  \ of the distance between you and Ulf.<br> <b>Romance Score:</b> 42</p> \n    </blockquote>\
