  >Before we get to today's <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> miniature\
  \ reveals, I want to focus on a couple of important general changes to the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> line that will\
  \ begin with this set, both in terms of the number of figures per set and in terms\
  \ of the subscription benefits offered to <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing\
  \ Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>.</span></p> \n     <h2>Number of Figures\
  \ Per Set</h2> \n     <p>Starting with <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a>,\
  \ Pathfinder Battles sets will go to 44 figures plus the Gargantuan case incentive\
  \ figure. This reduction in number of figures per set is designed to help WizKids\
  \ get its costs in line, and also comes with the added benefit of providing more\
  \ common and uncommon figures to folks who buy their miniatures by the case (something\
  \ a lot of customers have been asking for). The number of figures in a case, brick,\
  \ or booster does not change, just the composition of the set in terms of total\
  \ sculpts.</p> \n     <p>A case should still contain a full set (as always in the\
  \ case of a collated product we can't guarantee this, but it's certainly the goal).\
  \ Below is the model rarity breakdown for a case:</p> \n     <p>56 commons, 32 uncommons,\
  \ 8 rares, 28 large uncommons, 4 large rares.</p> \n     <p>Here is the figure breakdown\
  \ for the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> set:</p> \n     <p>7\
  \ common (Small), 6 common (Medium), 11 uncommon (Medium), 8 uncommon (Large), 8\
  \ rare (Medium), and 4 rare (Large).</p> \n     <p>The total number of figures per\
  \ case and the overall price of the case will not change. The specific figure size\
  \ breakdowns will differ slightly from set to set, but the model rarity breakdown\
  \ should be stable from release to release.</p> \n     <h2>Case Subscription Changes</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>When we started the <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> line, the original plan was to supplement set releases with\
  \ frequent Encounter Packs, Builder Series mini-sets, and other \"one-off\" releases.\
  \ These have proven to be less popular than we'd hoped both with the audience and\
  \ with our partners at WizKids, so as time has gone on we've produced significantly\
  \ fewer of these special releases than we'd planned to.</p> \n     <p>We set up\
  \ our \n      <link>Ongoing Case Subscriptions—a vital backbone to keeping the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> line\
  \ in production since it establishes a baseline of sales for the brand—with these\
  \ special releases in mind. The current model earns subscribers discount codes to\
  \ use on these releases, with three different discounts for the case incentive figure,\
  \ special Encounter Packs or Builder Series releases, and another discount for loose\
  \ singles sold on paizo.com.</p> \n     <p>Starting with the Reign of Winter set,\
  \ the \n      <link>Ongoing Case Subscription benefits will change to:</p> \n  \
  \   <ul> \n      <li>The right to purchase one limited-edition case premium figure\
  \ at 75% off its normal retail price per case ordered. (Same as existing benefit)</li>\
  \ \n      <li>30% off the normal retail price of ALL Pathfinder Battles products\
  \ on paizo.com, including the cases ordered as part of your subscription, all previously\
  \ released product, all Encounter Pack, Builder Series, or special releases, and\
  \ all loose, unpackaged singles.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>To recap: Active a\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>\
  \ to the Pathfinder Battles line receive a 30% discount on all Pathfinder Battles-branded\
  \ products on paizo.com except the limited-edition case incentive figures, which\
  \ can be purchased at 75% off. These discounts bring our pricing in line with other\
  \ online retailers.</p> \n     <p>These benefits last only as long as your Pathfinder\
  \ Battles Ongoing Subscription, and go away if you cancel your subscription. Existing\
  \ coupon codes provided as part of our <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing Case\
  \ Subscription</a> benefits remain active. Even though they are for 20% off instead\
  \ of the new 30% discount, they can be used even after you've stopped your subscription.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It may take us a little time to update paizo.com to reflect these new\
  \ changes, but they will be in place by the time Reign of Winter is scheduled to\
  \ ship to customers in late May.</p> \n     <p>We think these new subscription benefits\
  \ are easier to understand and more attractive to <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> fans. Our ongoing Case Subscribers are absolutely vital\
  \ to the continued success of the Pathfinder Battles line. If you are collecting\
  \ every set, I strongly encourage you to <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >sign up for an Ongoing Case Subscription</a> today. It really is the most important\
  \ thing you can do to encourage a long and healthy life for <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a>. We certainly appreciate it. </p> \n     <h2>Today's Reign\
  \ of Winter Previews</h2> \n     <p>With all of that business out of the way, let's\
  \ take a look at a few of the remaining figures from the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"\
  >Reign of Winter</a> set!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_ZombiePanther.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_ZombiePanther_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Up first this week is the Zombie Panther,\
  \ a nasty undead great cat ready to pounce on your player characters! This mangy\
  \ critter is covered in spots exposing rotting flesh beneath its fur, from a nasty\
  \ bit of exposed ribcage along its side to a significant element of his face where\
  \ the skull is completely visible. I'm holding the production figure in hand as\
  \ I write this, and I'm impressed with the effectiveness of what amounts to a pretty\
  \ simple figure. At the common rarity, you'll have enough of this gross undead animal\
  \ to build a neat encounter. It also makes a great familiar for a necromancer!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Wolliped_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Wolliped_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have the Wolliped, an eight-legged beast\
  \ of burden from the snow planet Triaxus. Though Wollipeds do not play a prominent\
  \ role in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of Winter\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, they do appear on page 90 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8vss\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #70: The Frozen Stars</a>, which also features Triaxus\
  \ heavily. I threw the Wolliped in this set as my \"Erik's Choice\" figure because\
  \ I thought he looked cool and I'd never seen anything like him in plastic before.\
  \ As a big fan of planetary romance novels like <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, I'm also\
  \ a sucker for alien mounts with too many legs. The Wolliped officially has an intelligence\
  \ of 2, but the figure's face is quite expressive, and he could easily double as\
  \ some sort of intelligent creature. He's slated at the uncommon rarity, and is\
  \ a Large creature.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Zavackuul_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Zavackuul_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Last up this week is Zavackuul, a reclusive and\
  \ eccentric aberration who dwells in an icy fissure somewhere during the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a> (no\
  \ spoilers!). Zavackuul is a compulsive collector of victims, whom she entombs in\
  \ ice and displays in her lair. The simple (but effective) paint job on this figure\
  \ looks great, but the real stand-out here are the six (!) tentacles whipping off\
  \ her central form, bringing a great sense of dimensionality to the miniature. Zavackuul\
  \ is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n     <p>And that's it for this week. Please consider\
  \ setting up an <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Ongoing Case\
  \ Subscription</a> to make sure you don't miss a single <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"\
  >Reign of Winter</a> figure!</p> \n     <p>Until next week,</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br\
