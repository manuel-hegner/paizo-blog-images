  \ class=\"date\">Friday, June 19, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\">\
  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I'm pleased to see that our current <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathinder Battles</a> set, <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons\
  \ Deep</em></a>, is arriving in stores and in the hands of collectors, and early\
  \ reaction to the set has been very encouraging. We put a lot of effort into making\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> the best and most useful\
  \ set of figures we've done to date, and with tons of high-utility figures, it looks\
  \ like we either achieved or came very close to that goal (hey, we've done some\
  \ great sets in the past too, so the competition is fierce!).</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ week I'd like to move on from <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>\
  \ to present three figures from our NEXT set, November's <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>. After I announced that we planned a tavern-themed\
  \ set at this year's PaizoCon, a few miniature collectors expressed some concern\
  \ about a set with so many non-combatant figures. I guess the taverns in my campaigns\
  \ see a lot more fighting than the national average, but never fear! In addition\
  \ to barmaids, bartenders, and other NPC figures, <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set also includes a good number of monsters or\
  \ fight-ready humanoids.</p> \n     <p>Here are three of them.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150619-Guard.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150619-Guard_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Every location needs a Guard, and I knew I had to make\
  \ a miniature of this guy as soon as I first saw his image on page 267 of the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>. Good guy, bad guy, you be\
  \ the judge. The only thing that's certain is he is way, way lower-level than your\
  \ player characters, and he's probably going to die in large numbers. That's why\
  \ we made this Medium figure a common!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150619-FrostGiantIceMage.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150619-FrostGiantIceMage_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>We've already produced a couple of frost giants in\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathinder Battles</a> line, but I'm not convinced\
  \ we've created enough to build a truly meaningful battle royale. Thus, I present\
  \ to you the Frost Giant Ice Mage, a regal figure who could just as easily double\
  \ as a cleric or leader type. What's a frost giant doing at the <em>Rusty Dragon\
  \ Inn</em>, you ask? Shhhh. Shhhh. Not everything has to fit the theme perfectly,\
  \ you guys. There's always room for more monsters. The Frost Giant Ice Mage is a\
  \ Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  //static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150619-OrcRider.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150619-OrcRider_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Last up this week is a real winner, the mounted Orc\
  \ Rider on Dire Wolf. I'd like to see the look on the faces of bar patrons when\
  \ this dude wanders into town. The Orc Rider on Dire Wolf comes with a sword and\
  \ a battle standard bearing the symbol of the Hold of Belkzen, where orcs have carved\
  \ out a bit of a nation for themselves. Will he carve out a place at your tavern\
  \ table? The Orc Rider on Dire Wolf is a Large, rare figure, and I can't wait to\
  \ see what he looks like in his final form!</p> \n     <p>That's it for this week.\
  \ Tune in next Friday for another early glimpse at digital sculpts from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>!</p> \n     <p>Until then,\
  \ I remain,</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote>\
