  \ September marks the five-year anniversary of the Minnesota Paizo Organized Play\
  \ (MN POP) group’s fundraising convention, SkålCon. Since the very beginning, our\
  \ goal was always to raise as much money as we could, take in as many wish list\
  \ items as possible, roll some dice, have fun, and try to surpass the previous year’\
  s total. Over the years, we’ve done just that. A lot has changed in these past five\
  \ years, but the spirit of generosity has not.</p> \n     <p>It is a testament to\
  \ SkålCon’s mission that we are a destination convention for people across the country.\
  \ We cannot do this alone! Support comes in many forms: our local volunteers, without\
  \ whom this would never have happened; Paizo, who donates charity boons, sanctions\
  \ runs of retired scenarios, and providing staff members such as Tonya Woldridge\
  \ as attendees; to our convention goers, who donate money and items to those in\
  \ need. Everything adds up to make for an amazing experience for everyone!</p> \n\
  \     <p>How does a relatively small regional convention such as SkålCon grow to\
  \ get national, even international, attention? With a little help from our friends.\
  \ Thurston Hillman, for one. He was instrumental in helping our convention get off\
  \ the ground. His willingness to help in a myriad of ways, regardless of what it\
  \ was we asked him to do, went a long way in ensuring we could put on our little\
  \ convention the following years. Thurston also helped spread the word about our\
  \ community’s dedication to the idea of SkålCon. Every year, I meet more and more\
  \ people, most of whom I had never met before, who ask me when SkålCon is and if\
  \ they can volunteer. Why? Because Thursty, that’s why.</p> \n     <p>While every\
  \ convention is different, so our experience will be different than yours, Paizo\
  \ event support is consistant. They have the ability to help you promote your convention.\
  \ work with you to find the appropriate level of support for your convention, be\
  \ it one that seats 15 or 150 tables over a weekend, and ask “How can we help make\
  \ your convention better?” Most of the Org Play team has a Venture Corps background\
  \ and were once doing what you are planning to do, so they understand the challenges\
  \ of hosting an event. Paizo is in a position to give you the right level of support\
  \ no matter what size convention you are running, and we encourage you to use them\
  \ as a resource.</p> \n     <p>What do we do with the collected donations? We give\
  \ them to Tubman, which helps women, men, youth and families throughout the Twin\
  \ Cities who have experienced relationship violence, elder abuse, addiction, sexual\
  \ exploitation or other forms of trauma. You can learn more about their mission\
  \ at <a href=\"http://www.tubman.org\">www.tubman.org</a>.</p> \n     <p>Finally,\
  \ I want to share a few words from Tubman’s Director of Communications, Emily Truscott:</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Since 2015, SkålCon participants and organizers have contributed nearly\
  \ $20,000 and countless diapers, food items, clothing, and toiletries to support\
  \ the people who need Tubman’s services. People come to Tubman due to domestic violence,\
  \ sexual assault, addiction, and many other situations, and the support from the\
  \ community means so much—not only in the tangible necessities, but because it sends\
  \ a message to our clients that people care about them. Knowing that the community\
  \ is supporting them while they go through these life-changing situations can make\
  \ a huge impact on someone’s life. All of us at Tubman are grateful for the Skå\
  lCon community and what they’ve done for people at Tubman.”</p> \n     <p>SkålCon\
  \ is September 20-22 2019 at Crowne Plaza Minneapolis West and we invite you to\
  \ join us! Our website <a href=\"http://www.skalcon.org\">http://www.skalcon.org</a>\
  \ has all the information you need to attend.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
