  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Like many of\
  \ his kind, Grimmyr is unable to return home.</p>\n      <p>Grimmyr was born to\
  \ a family of iivlar keepers of Clan Idrun, one of many small nomadic jotunborn\
  \ communities within the Fray, that sub-planar realm that lies between the mortal\
  \ Universe and the Ethereal Plane. A place of silver, shifting sands and insubstantial\
  \ copies of geographic features and animals of the Universe, the Fray has been the\
  \ realm of jotunborn and their progenitors for millennia. Grimmyr—and indeed all\
  \ jotunborn—was told since before the time of his weavingday about the responsibility\
  \ bestowed upon their ancestors by the gods so long ago: to watch over the mortal\
  \ Universe that they helped create. This stewardship has been passed down throughout\
  \ the generations, and during times of chaos and strife, jotunborn must venture\
  \ to the mortal realms to lend their aid.</p>\n      <p>Grimmyr knew the stories,\
  \ knew that he might be called upon to redirect a river or replant a forest, but\
  \ he never expected that it would actually happen. He was happy tending to his family’\
  s colony of iivlars, watching them spin their silk, shepherding them to patches\
  \ of ethereal grass where they could feast, and gently pushing aside their claws\
  \ when they got a little too curious. He could see his life’s path stretching before\
  \ him. He would meet a pretty girl from a passing clan, fall in love, and be joined.\
  \ They would have a child, and Grimmyr would teach them the ways of iivlar-keeping.\
  \ Perhaps one day, he would be considered a clan elder and resolve disputes between\
  \ neighbors and guide the community through the Fray.</p>\n      <p>But then, a\
  \ god died.</p>\n      <p>The cosmic upheaval of Gorum’s death was felt across the\
  \ entire multiverse, and the Fray was no different. All jotunborn could feel the\
  \ havoc being wrought in the mortal Universe deep in their souls, like a spiritual\
  \ itch that needed to be scratched. Grimmyr was out in a field when the ground began\
  \ to tremble. Something began to tug at his soul, and he instinctively knew that\
  \ he was being called elsewhere to fulfill his ancestral duty. Time was short, but\
  \ the insectile iivlars couldn’t be left unguarded, so he quickly shepherded them\
  \ back to the clan. His mother and father were waiting there for him. He could see\
  \ in their eyes that they also knew.</p>\n      <p>The goodbyes were solemn but\
  \ not despairing. All three of them understood the weight of this obligation, and\
  \ while a jotunborn leaving the Fray could be gone for weeks or even months, Grimmyr’\
  s parents believed they would see him again soon. His father presented him with\
  \ a pair of sturdy gauntlets made of molted iivlar shell to keep him safe, and his\
  \ mother said a brief prayer to Skode, the giant goddess of heroism. Another violent\
  \ shudder ran through the ground, as if the Fray was impatient for Grimmyr to fulfill\
  \ the covenant. Grimmyr nodded silently to his parents and gave in to the pull on\
  \ his soul.</p>\n      <p>Grimmyr appeared among lush jungle greenery, the most\
  \ plant life he had ever seen in one place at a time. It was night, so he concentrated\
  \ on the silk woven through his skin, creating a soft glow by which he could see.\
  \ As he began to get his bearings, he smelled the smoke. He pushed past broad leaves\
  \ and enormous flowers to find a fishing village on a river, one of its huts engulfed\
  \ in flames. Before he could react, an arrow pierced his shoulder. Several brown-skinned\
  \ elves—presumably residents of this settlement—trained their bows upon him, with\
  \ one nocking another projectile. He held up his hands in a gesture of supplication,\
  \ but his enormous size and glowing skin must have confused and frightened them,\
  \ so they loosed a full volley at him. He barely dodged out of the way, an arrow\
  \ glancing off his gauntlets as he shielded his face.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div\

  \        Art by Wayne Reynolds</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Grimmyr’\
  s flight brought him closer to the river, where other elven village folk formed\
  \ a line to move buckets of water from the shore to the burning building. They froze\
  \ in fear at the sight of him, but that allowed Grimmyr to notice what he first\
  \ thought was a log slide closer to a villager knee-deep in the river. The mud-brown\
  \ crocodile suddenly surged forward, but Grimmyr had already pushed the villager\
  \ to one side, and its jaws clamped down on Grimmyr’s arm instead. Prying the crocodile\
  \ off him, he hurled it back into the river, where it swam off to find easier prey.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Though they were initially wary of Grimmyr, they didn’t stop him from\
  \ carrying barrels of water from the river to help put out the fire. Later, a white-haired\
  \ elven elder tended to his wounds. She spoke a few words of Grimmyr’s language,\
  \ and through their conversation, he learned where he was: a settlement on the Vanji\
  \ River in the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse on the world of Golarion. The elder\
  \ explained how a piece of burning sky fell from above to cause the fire, a piece\
  \ of something larger plummeting down far to the southwest.</p>\n      <p>Since\
  \ then, Grimmyr has been tracking that fallen star, certain that it is the key to\
  \ what brought him to Golarion. Other fragments of it scattered along its trajectory,\
  \ causing minor disasters where they landed. After following one such piece to the\
  \ hideout of a band of river pirates, Grimmyr realized he required more protection\
  \ than just his gauntlets and pieced together a suit of armor to fit his frame from\
  \ various sources. Some he purchased, some he scavenged. To defend himself, he added\
  \ several striking heads to a stone maul, hoping that its intimidating appearance\
  \ would deter otherwise aggressive foes.</p>\n      <p>Despite all this, Grimmyr\
  \ hasn’t forgotten about home. He believes that whatever powers brought him to Golarion\
  \ will be able to return him once he has dealt with the catastrophe he was sent\
  \ to correct. Until then, he will continue to protect those that need it, much in\
  \ the same way he kept his iivlars safe.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
