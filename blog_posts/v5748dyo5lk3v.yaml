  \ Card Game parties will have characters in different roles and will contain sets\
  \ of powers that work well together. However, there are a few other characteristics\
  \ you should consider when assembling a party.</p> \n     <h2>Vary your niches</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Make sure you have characters who fill a variety of niches. Choose some\
  \ magic-users and some fighters; some characters who help with non-combat targets\
  \ and some who support fighting; some who are great when grouped together and some\
  \ who are great alone. You're going to face a variety of challenges, so make sure\
  \ you have a variety of abilities to meet them.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Especially\
  \ vary complementary characters.</i> If you've chosen two characters who will often\
  \ work together, try to make them as different from one another as you can.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Vary characters by primary skills</h2> \n     <p>There are six dice-based\
  \ skills in PACG: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.\
  \ Among your party, try to have good dice in each of these primary skills. If each\
  \ skill is supported by at least one character with a d8, that's great; if your\
  \ whole party tops out at a d4 or a d6 on something, consider how to fix that.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Vary characters by secondary skills</h2> \n     <p>Here's a breakdown\
  \ of the secondary skills and the number of characters in Rise of the Runelords\
  \ who have each: Acrobatics [2], Arcane [3], Craft [0], Diplomacy [3], Disable [1],\
  \ Divine [4], Fortitude [3], Knowledge [3], Melee [4], Perception [2], Ranged [1],\
  \ Stealth [1], Survival [3]. (You could make a similar list for any of the other\
  \ adventure paths.)</p> \n     <p>Ideally, you'll want each of these skills covered,\
  \ meaning you can send <i>someone</i> to defeat each card and close each location.\
  \ Absent that, choose characters that offer a wide spread of skills; work particularly\
  \ hard not to add any characters to your party whose skills are totally redundant.\
  \ Also, look carefully at the skills that are most common among the characters published\
  \ with the adventure path you're playing, because they're probably the most important.\
  \ The fact that none of the Runelords characters have Craft lets you know that you\
  \ can get by without it. Similarly, missing Acrobatics or Stealth generally won't\
  \ be a big deal in Rise of the Runelords, but you should think more carefully before\
  \ voiding Diplomacy or Survival.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Choose characters\
  \ that have a lot of skills, especially if you have fewer players.</i> The fewer\
  \ characters you have, the harder it is to cover all the skills. So for low player-count\
  \ games, consider characters who have three or four secondary skills over those\
  \ who have just two.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #2: Manage gaps with cards.</i>\
  \ If you have gaps in your skill coverage, put cards that help with those skills\
  \ into your deck. Just as a Masterwork Tools can cover a missing Disabler, a Burglar\
  \ can help with both Disable and Stealth. (Remember which characters have those\
  \ boons so you can send people where they need to go!)</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6801-Burglar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p>Sometimes you just need friends in low places.</p>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <h2>Vary characters by cards</h2> \n     <p>There is nothing sadder in\
  \ PACG than acquiring a great card and having to throw it out at the end of the\
  \ scenario because nobody has room in their deck for it. This is also a pragmatic\
  \ issue: You're only going to get so many great cards each game, so the more of\
  \ them you can keep, the better your party becomes. So for each type of boon, you\
  \ want at least one character whose deck list is strong in that type.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><i>Corollary #1: Consider subtypes too.</i> Covering a range of card <i>subtypes</i>\
  \ with your characters can be even more important. In particular, if you can have\
  \ arcane and divine spell users, and melee and ranged weapon users, and characters\
  \ proficient with both light armor and heavy armor, then you're more likely to be\
  \ able to use everything you acquire. Certain characters can even be even more specialized:\
  \ If you have the sword-wielding Kyra from the <a href=\"/products/btpy97ia\"><em>Cleric\
  \ Class Deck</em></a>, you may want someone who can use the great melee weapons\
  \ that aren't swords; if you have Lirianne, you may want someone to take the ranged\
  \ weapons that aren't firearms. (Of course that way lies absurdity; there will always\
  \ be some cards you can't use, but minimize them!)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-KyraCharacterFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-KyraCharacterFront_360.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-LirianneCharacterFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p>Don't ask what happens if they find a card that has the Firearm\
  \ trait <i>and</i> the Sword trait...</p>\n     </div> \n     <p><i>Corollary #2:\
  \ Consider blessings too.</i> Most characters tend to prefer specific blessings,\
  \ either to complement certain skills or to overcome deficiencies in certain skills,\
  \ or because their role cards provide benefits for using them. Try and spread these\
  \ out too, so that you can happily use the maximum number of blessing types.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Vary characters after the fact</h2> \n     <p>Sometimes, you can vary\
  \ characters as they develop over time. Amiri, Kyra, and Valeros might initially\
  \ all pick from the same set of weapons, but you might be able to specialize each\
  \ during play, due either to power feats or to combos built by acquiring other boons.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Take what you want</h2> \n     <p>You should never follow <i>any</i>\
  \ of this strategy advice if it's impacting your fun, and that's especially true\
  \ when you're picking characters. Yes, it's great to have characters that work well\
  \ together, that can answer all of the game's challenges, and that make optimal\
  \ use of your cards. But don't let it stop you from taking the character that you'll\
  \ enjoy playing the most.</p> \n     <h2>Don't be afraid to abandon characters</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>So you've carefully built your party... and you find out it doesn't\
  \ really work. Two character powers clash (like Merisiel and Valeros) or two characters\
  \ are fighting too much for cards (like Ezren and Seoni). Don't be afraid to dump\
  \ one of the characters that's clashing and replace them, particularly if it's still\
  \ early in the adventure path! The end result will probably be better play.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Choosing your party is just the first part of the metagame; how you\
  \ improve those characters over play is even more important (and is the topic of\
  \ the next article).</p> \n     <p>Shannon Appelcline<br> <i>Game Historian</i></p>\
