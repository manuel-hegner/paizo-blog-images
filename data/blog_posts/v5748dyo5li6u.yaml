  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">Over the past 8 years, <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> has grown into a worldwide community. The\
  \ phenomenal growth is testament to the hard work and support put in at all levels\
  \ of the campaign. In fact, it's grown so large that I am adding two more categories\
  \ of volunteers: Regional Venture-Coordinators (RVC) and Venture Agents (VA). These\
  \ two new tiers serve to facilitate communication across the globe, and recognize\
  \ the individuals who support Pathfinder Society with their efforts coordinating\
  \ games.</p> \n     <p>Regional Venture-Coordinators, under the guidance of the\
  \ Organized Play Coordinator, supervise a large section of the world, and will support\
  \ Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants in their duties. The other new rank,\
  \ Venture-Agent, is responsible for organizing regularly scheduled activities at\
  \ a specific venue, and will report to the Venture-Captains or Lieutenants of the\
  \ area where the location is located.</p> \n     <p>If you are interested in volunteering\
  \ for Pathfinder Society Organized Play, we are continually recruiting! <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety/getInvolved\">Check this page</a> to see more information on\
  \ requirements and how to apply (this page has been updated today to outline all\
  \ of the new duties of each volunteer category).</p> \n     <p>Without further ado,\
  \ let me introduce the new Regional Venture-Coordinators!</p> \n     <blockquote>\

  >\n       <div class=\"spoiler-text\">\n        Art started in the Pathfinder Society\
  \ at Gen Con 2007. From there, he immediately began organizing conventions and spread\
  \ PFS to the greater NY area - Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York.\
  \ After being appointed VC in October 2010, he concentrated on recruiting VCs from\
  \ Maine to Washington, D.C., leaving him to focus on New York City and surrounding\
  \ areas. Art received the 5th Campaign Coin, making him Pathfinder Society #705,\
  \ at Origins. Says Art, \"I ran Midnight Mauler as a special so many times I have\
  \ run it from memory 3 times or more.\"\n       </div>\n      </div> \n      <div\

  \       <div class=\"spoiler-text\">\n        Dan started playing PFS at Gen Con\
  \ 2009 and then in the local Pathfinder Society group in Washington, DC. He became\
  \ the first Venture-Captain of the greater Washington, DC/Northern Virginia/Southern\
  \ Maryland area in October 2011. When he moved near Baltimore, MD in 2012, he was\
  \ appointed as the first Venture-Captain for that region. In less than a year, he\
  \ moved back down to Alexandria, VA and became the VC of Washington, DC again, a\
  \ post he has held for the past 2.5 years. Dan was awarded my Campaign Coin at PaizoCon\
  \ 2015, and has attended numerous Gen Cons and PaizoCons, as well as PaizoCon UK\
  \ in 2014.\n       </div>\n      </div> \n      <div style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\"\

  \       Del joined the ranks of Venture-Captain in October 2011. His region stretched\

  \ North Carolina. Over the years, Del trained many GMs and convention organizers.\
  \ He supports Pathfinder Society at Gen Con with vans full of volunteers. He received\

  \ a dozen tables at GenCon. He was instrumental in the early growth of the Chicagoland\
  \ area received a promotion to Venture-Captain in April of 2011. He has since relocated\
  \ to Central Illinois, where he continues to promote local play, organize regional\
  \ events, and mentor new Venture-Officers. Bob is one of the original five-star\
  \ GMs, and has been invaluable in helping to organize some of our largest events\
  \ including PaizoCon and GenCon. He was awarded a Campaign Service Coin in 2014.\n\

  \  Jason became a Venture-Captain in January of 2011, and received my fifth star\
  \ in June 2011. He was the Pathfinder Society's second five star GM, narrowly beating\
  \ Kyle Baird to it! He received a Campaign Service Coin on August 1st, 2015. In\
  \ describing himself, Jason writes, \"I am a guy that just really likes games. My\
  \ favorite happens to be Pathfinder, so I play it a lot\". You may have seen him\
  \ at conventions—he's the overweight guy with a beard. If you walk up to him at\
  \ any time, ever (even if you catch him at work) and ask him to play a scenario,\
  \ he will drop whatever he is doing to join in. Jason enjoys movies, long walks\
  \ on the beach, and terrifying players by running whatever monstrosity Richard Pett\

  \ Pathfinder Society. His hard work and dedication to the Pathfinder Society was\
  \ recognized at Gen Con 2014, where he received a Campaign Coin at Gen Con 2014.\
  \ The past two years, he has been co-lead of Gen Con. Todd is full of tales and\

  \ GM at the Grand Melee. Eric also contributed to the Grand Melee by writing two\
  \ of the encounters for this event. At PaizoCon 2013 Eric was awarded my campaign\
  \ service award, becoming Pathfinder Society #707. Says Eric, \"This is very appropriate\
  \ because upside down it spells out LOL.\" Most recently, Eric's activities include\
  \ being the Venture-Captain of San Diego, playing 6 home games and 1 play by post\
  \ game all using the Pathfinder rule set.\n       </div>\n      </div> \n      <div\

  \ at GenCon UK 2008 and after two years of flying to foreign conventions to play\
  \ the game, he decided to set up local play in the Netherlands in 2010. It could\
  \ be coincidence, but a month after his request for support, the Venture Captain\
  \ program was announced. He was appointed one of the first thirteen Venture Captains\
  \ and has made it a habit to meet up with other Pathfinder players from all across\
  \ the globe. So if you are ever in the Netherlands, send him an email and he'll\
  \ try to set up a game for you!\n       </div>\n      </div> \n      <div style=\"\

  \ who started GMing Pathfinder Society games when Organized Play was set up in 2008.\
  \ He convinced enough people to help him create PaizoCon UK in 2009 and it has grown\
  \ into an international convention. He was selected to be one of the original 13\
  \ Venture-Captains in October 2010. As a UK Venture Captain, he has brought Pathfinder\
  \ Society gaming to various events and encouraged others to take up venture officer\
  \ roles for England, Scotland and Ireland. Paizo, Inc. recognized Dave as a Volunteer\
  \ of the Year 2013-14. He continues to GM Pathfinder as often as possible at conventions\
  \ and also enjoys terrifying GMs by signing up at the last minute to play Pathfinder\
  \ Society games.\n       </div>\n      </div> \n      <div style=\"margin-bottom:\

  >\n        Stephen is a proud gaymer involved with RPGs since the early 80s. I first\
  \ GMed Pathfinder at Free RPG Day in June 2007, and started supporting Pathfinder\
  \ Society in Season 0 as he traveled Melbourne's con circuit. He GMed at GenConOz\
  \ the year Jason Bulmahn visited Brisbane to launch the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook\
  \ and when GenConOz cancelled the following year at short notice, I co-organized\
  \ the first PaizoConOz with Venture-Captain-Sydney Al Rigg. Stephen is one of the\
  \ 13 original Venture-Captains appointed in October 2010, one of the earliest 5-Star\
  \ GMs, and in March 2013 became the third recipient of the Campaign Service Coin.\
  \ Stephen jokes, \"Many local players joke that I had been demoted from VC Australia\
  \ to VC Melbourne with the appointment of VCs in other States, but under their capable\
  \ stewardship, you'd be unlucky to visit an Australian city and not find somewhere\
  \ you could enjoy a game of PFS. In the meantime, I believe I've once again inherited\
  \ the largest geographic PFS region with the inclusion of New Zealand, Singapore,\
  \ India, East Asia and Hawaii. I'm looking forward to working with VCs in the Asia-Pacific\
  \ Region, and will of course be campaigning tirelessly for more PFS excursions into\
  \ Tian Xia, Vudra and... Sarusan!\"\n       </div>\n      </div> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>I would also like to recognize the GMs that have earned their 5th star\
  \ since Gen Con 2015. To qualify as a 5-Star GM, you have to run 150 games, including\
  \ 10 specials and 50 different scenarios, and run a game observed by a Venture-Officer.\
  \ It takes many hours to achieve and shows dedication to Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play. Many congratulations to the following GMs!</p> \n     <table class=\"table-spacing-large\"\
