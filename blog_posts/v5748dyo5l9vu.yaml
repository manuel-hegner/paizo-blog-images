  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, December 31, 2008</p> \n    <p> So one year\
  \ ago today, I made a post to this blog about what was coming in 2008 for Pathfinder's\
  \ Adventure Path. I just went back and looked and it's some interesting reading.\
  \ For the most part, we accomplished everything on that list, although as we got\
  \ toward the end of the predictions for 2008, I note a few things that didn't quite\
  \ work out the way I'd planned for them to. <i>Pathfinder</i> #16 didn't have a\
  \ gazetteer of the Darklands surrounding the drow city, and as I'd feared, the article\
  \ about Demon Lords did indeed slip from #17 to #18. But overall, pretty close!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Anyway, the reason I bring this up is that here we are at the end of\
  \ 2009, and I need a topic for a blog post. Especially after we missed several posts\
  \ over the past few days due to snow-related apocalypses. So, without further ado,\
  \ here's what you can look forward to seeing in <i>Pathfinder</i> in 2009!</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>January</b>: The Second Darkness Adventure Path comes to a close this\
  \ month with Brian Cortijo's <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy84bc\">\"Descent Into\
  \ Midnight,\"</a> taking the PCs into one of the deepest reaches of the Darklands.\
  \ A gazetteer of the mysterious Land of Black Blood and an article about the 29\
  \ most notorious of Golarion's demon lords rounds out the first volume of the year.\
  \ Followers of Eando Klein's adventures in the Pathfinder Journal won't want to\
  \ miss this volume, for this installment brings his long adventure to a close!</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>February</b>: We heat things up in chilly February by traveling far\
  \ to the south of Varisia to start the Legacy of Fire Adventure Path. Paizo's own\
  \ publisher, Erik Mona, penned this volume's adventure, <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy84bd\"\
  >\"Howl of the Carrion King,\"</a> and New York Times bestselling author Elaine\
  \ Cunningham takes over the Pathfinder Journal, starting a new story that'll run\
  \ alongside of the Legacy of Fire campaign.</p> \n    <p><b>March</b>: Those who\
  \ didn't get enough gnolls from the first Legacy of Fire adventure in February will\
  \ love <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy84be\">\"The House of the Beast,\"</a> by\
  \ Tim Hitchcock. The picture shown here by Svetlin Velinov depicts just one of the\
  \ exciting encounters you can look forward to in this massive dungeon crawl, proving\
  \ that there's more than gnolls waiting for you! Sean K Reynolds continues his exploration\
  \ of Golarion's deities with Sarenrae, and Steve Kenson explores the region around\
  \ Pale Mountain in northwest Katapesh, ground zero for half of Legacy of Fire's\
  \ adventures.</p> \n    <p><b>April</b>: In April, we begin Wolfgang Baur's four-part\
  \ series of articles about the Genies of Golarion, starting with an exploration\
  \ of what it is to be one of these magical elemental creatures to begin with. Darrin\
  \ Drader's first <i>Pathfinder</i> adventure, <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy84bf\"\
  >\"The Jackal's Price,\"</a> takes the PCs into the second-largest city in the Inner\
  \ Sea region, and Richard Pett shows us what goes on in a typical Katapesh marketplace.\
  \ Be afraid, as they say…</p> \n    <p><b>May</b>: <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG\
  \ Superstar</a> finalist Jason Nelson's adventure, <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy85jn\"\
  >\"The End of Eternity,\"</a> takes the PCs into an unexpected realm both near and\
  \ far from Katapesh, while Todd Stewart, author of The Great Beyond, explores the\
  \ chaotic extraplanar race of the proteans. Wolfgang's genie articles continue with\
  \ an exploration of methods to bind and command genies.</p> \n    <p><b>June</b>:\
  \ At the height of summer, <i>Pathfinder</i> heads into one of the game's most legendary\
  \ sites—the efreeti-ruled City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Greg Vaughan's\
  \ adventure, <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy85jo\">\"The Impossible Eye,\"</a> delves\
  \ deep into one of the city's palace fortresses, while Wolfgang Baur explores the\
  \ rest of the City of Brass in a gazetteer of the mythic realm. And Sean K Reynolds\
  \ adds Rovagug to the list of big deity articles.</p> \n    <p><b>July</b>: The\
  \ Legacy of Fire reaches its explosive conclusion in RPG Superstar finalist Rob\
  \ McCreary's <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy85jp\">\"The Final Wish,\"</a> where\
  \ we get to see just what happens when a crazed genie gets too generous with his\
  \ wish-granting mojo. Wolfgang's genie articles end with all sorts of genie-powered\
  \ magic, and we pull back the curtain on the spawn of Rovagug. The tarrasque is\
  \ only the most famous one of many, after all!</p> \n    <p><b>August</b>: Things\
  \ start to get a little bit hazier once we move into Gen Con, as they usually do,\
  \ but I do know that August sees the launch of something no less than the first\
  \ ever <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\">Pathfinder RPG</a> Adventure Path, <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves\">\"Council of Thieves.\"</a> Fully compatible\
  \ with both the new rules and the 3.5 SRD, this Adventure Path heads back north\
  \ to the city of Westcrown in Cheliax, home of devil worshipers, tiefling bandits,\
  \ and lots and lots of rebels! We've been pitching the <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy85jq\"\
  >adventure</a> in house here as \"The Godfather\" meets \"The Omen,\" but I'm still\
  \ not quite sure what exactly we mean about that. Those of you who've been waiting\
  \ patiently for lots of details on the Hellknights should find one of this volume's\
  \ support articles of particular interest.</p> \n    <p><b>September</b>: The Council\
  \ of Thieves Adventure Path takes place entirely in and surrounding the city of\
  \ Westcrown, and as a result, many of the adventures in this campaign will have\
  \ a distinctively urban feel. This volume's adventure ups that ante, asking the\
  \ PCs not only to brave the perils of urban adventures, but to take part in a violent\
  \ and dangerous play in order to impress the local nobility! Anyone can kill an\
  \ otyugh, but how many adventurers can remember their next line on stage during\
  \ the middle of a fight for their life?</p> \n    <p><b>October</b>: The PCs continue\
  \ to oppose the Council of Thieves as Westcrown falls ever more under the influence\
  \ of the mysterious thieves' guild, and the second part of an exploration of the\
  \ Hellknights of Cheliax (a series scheduled to begin back in August) shows us even\
  \ more about this organization's methods and resources.</p> \n    <p><b>November</b>:\
  \ At some point along the way in Council of Thieves, I suspect we'll be talking\
  \ quite a bit about devils and Hell—about Mammon and Erebus in particular. I won't\
  \ promise a lot more about this archdevil in November, but chances are good! This\
  \ volume's adventure, tentatively titled \"The Infernal Syndrome,\" explores just\
  \ why it's a bad idea to rely too much on diabolic magic for comforts around the\
  \ home.</p> \n    <p><b>December</b>: It's pretty likely that by this time, we'll\
  \ have a nice big article that examines the tieflings of Golarion. Also, I probably\
  \ should have mentioned that Sean'll be taking a long look at the church of Iomedae\
  \ back in September already, but in December we've got a toasty gift for everyone—\
  Asmodeus, one of the deities most requested for an exploration in <i>Pathfinder</i>,\
  \ finally makes his debut here!</p> \n    <p>And that's that! Wes and I are going\
  \ to be spending a fair amount of time this week getting Council of Thieves all\
  \ mapped out in detail, and in the months to come I'm sure we'll have more to say.\
  \ But for now, the hints and clues and teasers above will have to suffice. Next\
  \ year's looking like it could be Paizo's biggest year yet, in any case—hope to\
  \ see you all there!</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief</p>\
