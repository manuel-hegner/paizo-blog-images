  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Award-winning author Chris A. Jackson talks\
  \ about writing his latest Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href=\"/products/btpy9aon\"\
  ><em>Pirate's Promise</em></a>, and how living full-time aboard a 45-foot sailboat\
  \ in the Caribbean inspires his tales of love, espionage, and high-seas adventure:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>A night as black as a devil's soul. No moon, no stars,\
  \ only a light breeze in the sails and the roar of surf off the bow. We can't see\
  \ it, but we can hear it, each successive crash of the sea against razor sharp coral\
  \ a death knell that grabs your gut and gives a little twist. Our chart is crap,\
  \ no radar, no GPS, only a compass and a depth sounder, and the soundings keep getting\
  \ shallower. Did I mention the engine had quit? All we wanted was shelter from the\
  \ seas for the night, but we didn't arrive until after dark; now we're committed.\
  \ When it feels right, you turn into the wind, furl the sail, and drop anchor. It\
  \ holds. We're safe. Deep sigh of relief, and where's the rum?</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ is how I researched \"approaching a shore in the dark\" for <em>Pirate's Promise</em>.\
  \ I don't recommend it. I researched \"heavy weather\" off the Oregon coast in 60\
  \ knot winds and 35 foot breaking seas. When one of those waves hits the boat, every\
  \ item in the cabin becomes airborne and slams against the wall, including you.\
  \ Your face is pressed against a window as the boat lies on its side, a thin layer\
  \ of Lexan between you and a mile deep ocean, ready to take you... greedy, hungry.\
  \ I don't recommend that either.</p> \n     <p>Okay, so this wasn't exactly research,\
  \ but I use these experiences when I write nautical fiction. There have also been\
  \ plenty of beautiful nights with skies so full of stars you can't see the constellations,\
  \ and whales, and dolphins, and palm trees... and rum for the times both good and\
  \ bad.</p> \n     <p>Looks like I've found my niche, or at least part of it. The\
  \ other part seems to be making romance part of the plot, but better... because\
  \ it's Pathfinder! Yes, she's a snake! So what? Beauty isn't just scale deep, you\
  \ know!</p> \n     <p>How did I do my research on the romance? Well... I do recommend\
  \ falling in love, and not just for literary research interests. Yeah, I can hear\
  \ that one: \"So, you wanna research a novel with me?\" Still, there's nothing like\
  \ experiencing that exquisite stupidity of being in love to add some realism to\
  \ your romance writing.</p> \n     <p>I'm not telling how I researched Vreva Jhafae...\
  \ </p> \n     <p>But if there's something else you want to know about <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8xc7\"><em>Pirate's Honor</em></a> or <a href=\"/products/btpy9aon\"\
  ><em>Pirate's Promise</em></a>, let's discuss it. I'd like to hear what everyone\
  \ thinks, likes, or wants. With a lifetime's worth of sea stories, there must be\
  \ something you want to know.</p> \n     <p>To quote 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea:\
  \ \"It's a whale of a tale, and it's all true. I swear by my tattoo!\"</p> \n  \
