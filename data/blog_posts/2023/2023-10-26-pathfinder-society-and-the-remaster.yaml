  \ data-v-e19af2d6>\n            <p><br>\n              Ever since we announced the\
  \ Pathfinder Remaster project, my inbox has not known peace. Every day I get asked\
  \ by the Pathfinders worldwide, “how will Pathfinder Society handle the Remaster?”\
  \ Every day I must give the same answer, “I don’t know yet! Ask me in 1d4 months!”\
  </p>\n            <p>It’s now 1d4 months later and I can finally start to answer\
  \ this question! With the assistance of some incredibly dedicated Additional Resources\
  \ volunteers and no less than six members of Paizo staff, we are here today to present\
  \ the broad strokes of our plan to convert (or not convert) your Pathfinder Society\
  \ characters to the brand-new Remastered rules. While we don’t intend for our scenarios\
  \ to be written using the Remastered rules until Year 6 begins at Gen Con 2024,\
  \ we know the characters will need to make the switch faster.</p>\n            <p>Before\
  \ we get into it, I’d like to offer a couple of disclaimers. First, the rules we’\
  re sharing today are the broad strokes. There will be more specifics to come on\
  \ release date, but we’re still working our way through specific questions like\
  \ “what happens to my&nbsp;<em>staff of transmutation</em>&nbsp;now that transmutation\
  \ isn’t a school?” We’re sharing this today to get you ready for what’s to come.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Second, these rules are still in flux. We have a pile of questions\
  \ yet to answer internally (we’re having weekly meetings to do nothing but answer\
  \ them), and we expect more will come from the community as time goes on. We expect\
  \ this to happen! Our intention is for these guidelines to live in a subpage of\
  \ the Guide to Organized Play, to allow them to be a living document we’ll update\
  \ as time goes on.</p>\n            <p>Finally, we will not be able to answer every\
  \ single question that comes up. Rules discrepancies and questions come up&nbsp;<em>all\
  \ the time</em>&nbsp;at tables, and the Remaster will increase the odds of that\
  \ happening. The GM always has the power to make calls on rules questions at the\
  \ table. While we strive for the Pathfinder Society experience to play out the same\
  \ at every table worldwide, we need to accept as a community that there will be\
  \ some variance, and be patient with each other as we figure things out. This is\
  \ a game, we’re here to have fun, let’s all keep that in mind as we play!</p>\n\

  \ all that out of the way, here are the current planned guidelines for Pathfinder\
  \ Society and the Remaster. If you have questions/comments/concerns, drop them in\
  \ the comments of this blog and we’ll do our best to answer them. Once the Remaster\
  \ drops, we’ll create a separate thread in the Pathfinder Society forum for those\
  \ specific rules interactions that we won’t discover until they come up in play.</p>\n\

  \            <p>When considering the Pathfinder Remaster, our intent is as follows:</p>\n\
  \            <ul>\n             <li>To ensure that players are not forced to rebuild\
  \ characters</li>\n             <li>To ensure that as much previous material as\
  \ feasible is still useable</li>\n             <li>To incentivize adoption of the\
  \ new, Remastered ruleset</li>\n             <li>To provide an optional method to\
  \ rebuild characters into Remaster rules</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p><br></p>\n\
  \            <h2>General Guidance</h2>\n            <ol>\n             <li><strong>Game\
  \ Rules</strong>\n              <ol>\n               <li>Players and GMs must use\
  \ the remastered rules of the game immediately where possible. \n              \
  \  <ol>\n                 <li><strong>Example</strong>: Recall Knowledge has been\
  \ updated with additional guidelines. These take effect immediately at all PFS tables.</li>\n\
  \                 <li><strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp;The Refocus activity and the\
  \ focus spell rules have been updated to be more intuitive. All characters immediately\
  \ begin using these rules.</li>\n                 <li><strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp;Monster\
  \ abilities such as Grab are no longer automatic, but allow a free skill check to\
  \ attempt the action. GMs immediately begin using this new version of the rules.</li>\n\
  \                </ol></li>\n              </ol></li>\n             <li><strong>Character\
  \ Options</strong>\n              <ol>\n               <li>Beginning on November\
  \ 15, 2023, no new characters may be created using the class chassis printed in\
  \ the&nbsp;<em>Core Rulebook</em>&nbsp;if the class has been reprinted in the&nbsp;<em>Player\
  \ Core</em>. \n                <ol>\n                 <li>This affects the following\
  \ classes: bard, cleric, druid, fighter, ranger, rogue, witch, wizard.</li>\n  \
  \               <li>Characters with at least 1 game reported prior to November 15\
  \ may be built using the&nbsp;<em>Core Rulebook</em>&nbsp;chassis.</li>\n      \
  \           <li>Previously-existing characters with at least 1 game reported may\
  \ continue their progression using the&nbsp;<em>Core Rulebook</em>&nbsp;chassis.\
  \ They may not use the chassis in the&nbsp;<em>Player Core</em>&nbsp;without rebuilding.</li>\n\
  \                </ol></li>\n               <li>If a character option has been reprinted\
  \ with the same name, use the new version as if it were errata. No additional retraining\
  \ is necessary. \n                <ol>\n                 <li><strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp;<em>divine\
  \ lance</em>&nbsp;has been reprinted with new Remaster-compatible rules. All PCs\
  \ with&nbsp;<em>divine lance</em>&nbsp;must update the spell accordingly.</li>\n\
  \                </ol></li>\n               <li>If a character option has not been\
  \ reprinted, characters are free to use the option as previously printed, or to\
  \ select it at any time. \n                <ol>\n                 <li><strong>Example</strong>:\
  \ the&nbsp;<em>brooch of shielding</em>&nbsp;has not been reprinted. Characters\
  \ may still purchase and use a&nbsp;<em>brooch of shielding</em>.</li>\n       \
  \          <li><strong>Example</strong>: the&nbsp;<em>produce flame</em>&nbsp;spell\
  \ has not been reprinted, but&nbsp;<em>ignition</em>&nbsp;takes its place thematically.\
  \ Characters may learn either spell anytime they would learn a new spell, and could\
  \ learn both spells if they chose.</li>\n                 <li><strong>Example</strong>:\
  \ the oracle class has not yet been remastered. Players may still build and play\
  \ oracles using the rules in the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em>.</li>\n\
  \                </ol></li>\n              </ol></li>\n             <li>An oracle\
  \ who learns&nbsp;<em>divine lance</em>&nbsp;must still use the remastered version\
  \ of the spell.</li>\n            </ol>\n            <p><br></p>\n            <h2>Specific\
  \ Rules</h2>\n            <ol>\n             <li><strong>Alignment</strong>:&nbsp;Alignment\
  \ has been removed from the game. PCs and NPCs no longer have alignment. \n    \
  \          <ol>\n               <li><strong>Edicts and Anathema</strong>: To replace\
  \ certain aspects of alignment, edicts and anathema are being emphasized. These\
  \ are voluntary and optional, though deities and classes may introduce specific\
  \ edicts and anathema which are not optional.</li>\n               <li><strong>Holy\
  \ and Unholy</strong>: Many previously-aligned options now have either the holy,\
  \ unholy, or sanctified traits. At a GM’s discretion, enemy abilities which previously\
  \ had the good or evil traits may now have the holy or unholy trait. \n        \
  \        <ol>\n                 <li><strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp;A quasit’s strikes\
  \ previously had the evil trait. A GM may choose to give them the unholy trait,\
  \ as quasits are demonic creatures. Similarly, a quasit’s weakness to good should\
  \ now be considered a weakness to holy.</li>\n                </ol></li>\n     \
  \         </ol></li>\n             <li><strong>Wizards</strong>\n              <ol>\n\
  \               <li>Wizards built using the&nbsp;<em>Core Rulebook</em>&nbsp;chassis\
  \ may continue to treat spells that had their spell school removed as part of the\
  \ Remaster as if they have spell schools. They must otherwise fully update their\
  \ remastered spells. \n                <ol>\n                 <li><strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp;An\
  \ evocation wizard may still select&nbsp;<em>electric arc</em>&nbsp;as an evocation\
  \ cantrip. They must use the new damage as printed in the&nbsp;<em>Player Core</em>.</li>\n\
  \                </ol></li>\n               <li>Wizards built using the&nbsp;<em>Core\
  \ Rulebook</em>&nbsp;chassis may learn new spells printed in remastered books, but\
  \ they can never treat them as having a school spell if they did not previously\
  \ have one.</li>\n               <li>Runelords \n                <ol>\n        \
  \         <li>On November 15, 2023, the Runelord boon will be removed from the Achievement\
  \ Points store. No new Runelords may be created after this date until/unless the\
  \ archetype is reprinted.</li>\n                </ol></li>\n              </ol></li>\n\
  \             <li><strong>Campaign-Specific Rules and Clarifications</strong>\n\
  \              <ol>\n               <li>Pathfinder Society characters may not be\
  \ sanctified to unholy. This is the spiritual successor to the previous rule forbidding\
  \ PCs of evil alignment.</li>\n              </ol></li>\n            </ol>\n   \

  \        <li>On November 15, 2023, all characters with at least one game reported\
  \ are granted one free rebuild. This is a full rebuild; you may completely alter\
  \ a character’s ancestry, class, background, and any options selected. You may not\
  \ alter the adventures a character has participated in, nor may you alter a character’\
  s Reputation earned.</li>\n             <li>Upon rebuilding, your character starts\
  \ with gold equal to&nbsp;Table X.X<em>[Alex note: this table will be published\
  \ with the full rules, and is built on our baseline assumption of earning 8 TB per\
  \ scenario]</em>. \n              <ol>\n               <li>Alternatively, a player\
  \ character may sell any and all currently-held items at face value and purchase\
  \ new items as normal.</li>\n              </ol></li>\n             <li>If you use\
  \ this rebuild, indicate “Remaster Rebuild” on your character’s most recent Chronicle\
  \ Sheet.</li>\n             <li>If, in the course of this rebuild, you wish to refund\
  \ any purchased boons, please email orgplayreportingerrors[at]paizo[dot]com with\
  \ your character’s name, OP ID and character number, and the boon(s) you would like\
  \ to refund.</li>\n             <li>This rebuild must be used before December 31,\
  \ 2024. A second rebuild of this type will not be granted following the release\
  \ of Player Core 2.</li>\n            </ol>\n            <p><br></p>\n         \
  \   <p><br></p>\n            <h2>One Final Change</h2>\n            <p>While this\
  \ isn’t a direct result of the Remaster, we’re taking the opportunity to make another\
  \ change. Beginning on November 15, we will be&nbsp;<strong>removing the Pathfinder\
  \ Training</strong>&nbsp;from the Guide to Organized Play. Your characters who are\
  \ already Field Commissioned may still take bonus downtime, and we’re not going\
  \ to take away the bonus Lores or feats your characters may have already gained.\
  \ However, new characters may not use this system. Quite simply, it’s an extra layer\
  \ of complexity that most players aren’t engaging with, and that doesn’t add much\
  \ to the program.</p>\n            <p>However, we know everybody&nbsp;<em>loves</em>&nbsp;free\
  \ items, so they will remain in the form of&nbsp;<strong>Pathfinder Provisions</strong>!\
  \ We’ll have a pared-down list of consumables which all agents (including formerly\
  \ Field Commissioned agents) may choose from at the start of a mission. By default\
  \ agents will receive healing potions, though they may choose another item or items\
  \ if they prefer. The Society wants to ensure its agents come home safe!</p>\n \
