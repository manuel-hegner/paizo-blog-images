  \      </div> \n      <br> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p><b>Running a Knights\
  \ of Lastwall Campaign</b><br> Campaigns that centrally feature the Knights of Lastwall\
  \ can take many forms. The most obvious is a clash with the Whispering Way—necromancers\
  \ who believe undeath is the apex of existence, from whose ranks the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant arose—or other undead powers, from local malefactors to vampire barons\
  \ or mummy pharaohs. This could be a glorious crusade or a desperate guerrilla war.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>While the knights are a focused group with a specific goal, this doesn’\
  t mean they’re suited only for campaigns involving undead powers. The order’s mission\
  \ is to promote good, stop evil, and gather allies, and this is conducive to many\
  \ urban-focused games. Knights in a city might navigate the web of local politics\
  \ to stop a tyrant’s rise or a secret cult, all while recruiting squires and securing\
  \ noble support for the cause.</p> \n       <p>Knights can appear in other campaigns\
  \ as well. Many knight recruiters travel alone or with a retainer and might join\
  \ other heroes to aid in their noble goals. Likewise, the organization and its members\
  \ are far-ranging enough they might offer aid where player characters are members\
  \ of an allied or sympathetic organization, like the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a>, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse\"\
  >Magaambya</a>, or simply good folk doing good deeds.</p> \n       <p>The Knights\
  \ of Lastwall are a friendly and accepting lot, but players might face them as foes.\
  \ Particularly chaos-prone or destructive Firebrands, Gorumites, or Calistrians—\
  or, conversely, particularly stringent or oppressive Hellknights or Abadarans— might\
  \ come into conflict with the knights until they repent their ways and repair their\
  \ harms. If the player characters are outright villains, the knights will be even\
  \ more intent on stopping them. Woe betides a party of Whispering Way adherents\
  \ should the knights catch them</p> \n       <p>For more <em>Lastwall</em> excerpts,\

  \      <br> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p> \n       <p>Over\
  \ 300 years ago, the machine god Triune revealed itself to the galaxy and granted\
  \ all who would listen a priceless gift: faster-than-light technology using the\
  \ hyperspace realm now known as the Drift. Within decades, Drift travel had opened\
  \ the galaxy to exploration, trade, and conquest on a previously unfathomable scale.\
  \ Empires span multiple star systems. Companies ship essential products to countless\
  \ worlds. Explorers cast off into the unknown to meet unfamiliar species and uncover\
  \ wonders. Vacationers eagerly embark to reach distant attractions. And overall\
  \ the galaxy has achieved prosperity and possibility, all thanks to the Drift.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>So, what if, for reasons few could predict, the Drift just... broke?</p>\
  \ \n       <p>In that instant, starships traveling the Drift are hurled about, landing\
  \ in random and often perilous destinations (even on different planes altogether).\
  \ Drift travel becomes more difficult, with each voyage taking longer, encountering\
  \ frequent dangers, and sometimes failing altogether. Even long-range communication,\
  \ which relied on the Drift to span the galaxy, fails, leaving worlds isolated in\
  \ ways they haven’t experienced in centuries. Governments, civilians, scientists,\
  \ and faiths all clamor for answers, yet Triune seems mysteriously absent.</p> \n\
  \       <p>Welcome to the Drift Crisis, a galaxy-wide calamity instigated when the\
  \ Drift experiences a catastrophic failure. Unlike most Starfinder adventures published\
  \ to date, <em>Drift Crisis</em> isn’t a single story told through a single group\
  \ of heroes; it’s an event that spans countless worlds as the galaxy scrambles to\
  \ make sense of the crisis, restore order, and repair the damage to an essential\
  \ plane. Simultaneously, it’s a time of chaos as opportunists prey upon vulnerable\
  \ neighbors, oppressed worlds overthrow their compromised tyrants, and zealots preach\
  \ the downfall of technology to frightened masses.</p> \n       <p>Indeed, <em>Drift\
  \ Crisis</em> isn’t a single story—it’s a framework for telling innumerable stories.\
  \ In this book, you’ll find 20 exciting adventure seeds that explore different angles\
  \ of the Drift Crisis, letting player characters aid victims, rebuild damaged worlds,\
  \ take down once-untouchable villains, travel to exciting realms, and even reshape\
  \ the galaxy. And this book isn’t alone. Drift Crisis forms the core of a larger\
  \ narrative event presented by Paizo, including <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath\"\
  >Adventure Paths</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/standaloneAdventures/starfinderAdventures\"\
  >Starfinder Adventures</a>, and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/standaloneAdventures/starfinderOneShots\"\
  >Starfinder One-Shots</a> that all present different angles of the Drift Crisis.\
  \ Enjoy these on their own or use them to springboard your own Drift Crisis campaign!</p>\

  \ companions, or otherwise access the tools of undeath for players. Many of these\
  \ options aren’t suitable for all games, making them uncommon or rare accordingly.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>The creatures in Chapter 3 can be adversaries in all kinds of games.\
  \ Many of them have additional options for expansion or adjustments to make them\

  \ \n         <p><b>Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon</b><br> Down a minor side street in\
  \ the grimy, smog-clogged Ferrous Quarter of Alkenstar lies a squat, nondescript,\
  \ two-story building whose weathered sign reads “The Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon.\
  \ Drinks—Meals—Fireproof Rooms.” Its dingy white plaster and off-center porch encourage\
  \ the refined guest to look elsewhere. Indeed, the cosmopolitan traveler who does\
  \ venture inside is likely to be greeted with derogatory comments from a goggle-clad\
  \ goblin inventor or by rude stares from a hard-drinking patron long since mutated\
  \ by the wild magic of the Mana Wastes. To mitigate this reception the dwarven gunslinger\
  \ behind the bar, Foebe Dunsmith, is always ready to share a welcoming word and\
  \ drink on the house. Even so, this is the kind of bar where an introduction—or\
  \ a good deal of diplomatic hard work—is necessary to navigate the dwarven desperados,\
  \ goblin grenadiers, irascible inventors, and hard-drinking hoodlums who make up\
  \ the unruly crowd of regulars. Jumping into a high-stakes game of bootbeer (an\
  \ unexplainably popular guessing game in which players try to hide as much beer\
  \ on their person as possible) or wagering on a hand of cards can win friends, but\
  \ it can just as easily make enemies. And no night at the Barrel &amp; Bullet seems\
  \ complete without at least one knock-down, drag-out barfight!</p> \n         <p><b>OUTLAWS\
