  \ <h1>Reinventing The Wheel</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, April 20, 2007</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Originally, the main menace in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpr\">\"Burnt\
  \ Offerings,\"</a> the first Rise of the Runelords adventure, was going to be a\
  \ tribe of kobolds, because let's face it—everyone loves kobolds. So much so, in\
  \ fact, that they ended up being the bad guys for the first GameMastery Module,\
  \ which hits the shelves two months before \"Burnt Offerings.\" Which is cool for\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wix\"><i>Crown of the Kobold King</i></a>, but left\
  \ \"Burnt Offerings\" without a pint-sized menace. </p>\n   <p>Enter Wayne Reynolds.\
  \ </p>\n   <p>The decision to have Wayne paint the first dozen covers for <i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ had the exciting side effect of making Wayne the one to design the look for our\
  \ goblins. \"Make our goblins look almost as cute as they are scary,\" we told him,\
  \ and he more than accomplished that goal with a swarm of flat-headed, toothy, red-eyed\
  \ monsters wielding crazy jagged swords (which Editor-in-Chief James Jacobs immediately\
  \ named \"dog-slicers\" because, as you'll see below, goblins hate dogs!). Based\
  \ entirely on their look, Jacobs—who's also the author of \"Burnt Offerings\"—was\
  \ able to come up with all manner of weird goblin affectations (the current staff\
  \ favorite being the song they sing while marauding). Based on what Wayne did with\
  \ goblins, we're all understandably excited to see his designs for our stone giants,\
  \ ogres, and dragons... which you'll of course find sneak previews of right here.\

  right\" hspace=\"12\" border=\"0\" alt=\"sketch\"> </p>\n   <h2>Ten Fun Facts About\
  \ Goblins</h2> \n   <p>1: Horse Hate: Goblins excel at riding animals, but they\
  \ don't quite get horses. In fact, their hatred of all things horse is matched only\
  \ by their fear of horses, who tend to step on goblins who get too close. </p>\n\
  \   <p>2: Dog Hate: Although goblins raise horrible rat-faced doglike creatures\
  \ to use as mounts (and ride wolves or worgs if they can get them—goblins are quick\
  \ to explain that wolves are NOT dogs), their hatred of ordinary dogs nearly matches\
  \ their hatred of horses. The feeling is mutual, so if your dog's barking at the\
  \ woodpile for no reason, chances are good he smells a frightened goblin hiding\
  \ in there somewhere. </p>\n   <p>3: Goblins Raid Junkyards: Garbage pits, gutters,\
  \ sewers… anywhere there's garbage, you can bet goblins are nearby. They're weirdly\
  \ adept at crafting weapons and armor from refuse, and are fond of killing people\
  \ with what they throw away. </p>\n   <p>4: Goblins Love to Sing: Unfortunately,\
  \ as catchy as their lyrics can be, goblin songs tend to be a bit too creepy and\
  \ disturbing to catch on in mainstream society. </p>\n   <p>5: They're Sneaky: An\
  \ excited or angry goblin is a noisy, chattering, toothy menace, but even then,\
  \ they can drop into an unsettling silence in a heartbeat. This, matched with their\
  \ diminutive size, makes them unnervingly adept at hiding in places you'd never\
  \ expect… stacks of firewood, rain barrels, under logs, under chicken coops, in\
  \ ovens, etc. </p>\n   <p>6: They're A Little Crazy: The fact that goblins think\
  \ of things like ovens as good hiding places reveals much about their inability\
  \ to think plans through to the most likely outcome. That, and they tend to be easily\
  \ distracted, particularly by shiny things and animals smaller than them that might\
  \ make good eating. </p>\n   <p>7: They're Voracious: Given enough supplies, a goblin\
  \ generally takes nearly a dozen meals a day. Most goblin tribes don't have enough\
  \ supplies to accommodate such ravenous appetites, which is why the little menaces\
  \ are so prone to going on raids. </p>\n   <p>8: They Like Fire: Burning things\
  \ is one of the great goblin pastimes, although they're generally pretty careful\
  \ about lighting fires in their own lairs, especially since goblins tend to live\
  \ in large tangled thistle patches and sleep in beds of dried leaves and grass.\
  \ But give a goblin a torch and someone else's home and you've got trouble. </p>\n\
  \   <p>9: They Get Stuck Easily: Goblins have wiry frames but wide heads, and live\
  \ in cramped warrens. Sometimes too cramped. </p>\n   <p>10: Goblins Believe Paintings\
  \ and Writing Steal Your Soul: The walls of goblin lairs and ruins of towns goblins\
  \ have raided are littered with pictures of their enemies. They never draw pictures\
  \ of goblins, though—that's mean. Writing steals words out of your head. You can't\
  \ get them back. </p>\n   <h2>The Goblin Song</h2> \n   <p>Goblins chew and goblins\
  \ bite, <br>Goblins cut and goblins fight, <br>Stab the dog and cut the horse, <br>Goblins\
  \ eat and take by force! </p>\n   <p>Goblins race and goblins jump, <br>Goblins\
  \ slash and goblins bump, <br>Burn the skin and mash the head, <br>Goblins here\
  \ and you be dead! </p>\n   <p>Chase the baby, catch the pup, <br>Bonk the head\
  \ to shut it up! <br>Bones be cracked, flesh be stewed, <br>We the goblins—you the\
  \ food! </p>\n   <p>-The <i>Pathfinder</i> Staff</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div>\
