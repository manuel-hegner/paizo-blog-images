              <h3>Expanded Ancestries and Heritages</h3>
              <p>The first half of the book provides an in-depth look at ancestries and versatile heritages that premiered in previous book. Each entry presents information on how each ancestry or heritage fits in the Lost Omens setting as well as provide new ancestry feats, heritages, and lineages. The section includes the following entries.</p>
              <p><strong>Aasimar (Calder CaDavid):</strong>&nbsp;Aasimars result from celestial influence, but only rarely are they literally descended from celestials, more often coming from special blessings or the residual energies in holy places. This book presents three new lineages, emberkin, idyllkin, and plumekith, for aasimars descended from peris, agathions, and garudas respectively.</p>
              <p><strong>Azarketi (Jessica Catalan):</strong>&nbsp;Often known as “gillmen” or “Low Azlanti,” azarketis are the descendants of the Azlanti Empire. They survived Earthfall by being mutated by their foes, the alghollthus, to become an aquatic people tied forever to seas and waterways—but their history draws them back to the land. This book presents new azarketi options, exploring their magical connection to water and adds the inured, murkeyed, spined, and tactile azarketi heritages.</p>
              <p>Check out the Azarketi ancestry today with this&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/Azarketi+Ancestry.pdf">pdf download</a>!</p>
              <p><strong>Catfolk (David N. Ross):</strong>&nbsp;Native to the nation of Murraseth in southern Garund, catfolk are feline humanoids who believe they were created to hunt down threats to Golarion as a whole. This book presents new options to double down on catfolk’s agility and luck and adds the flexible, liminal, and sharp-eared catfolk heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Changeling (Isabelle Thorne):</strong>&nbsp;The offspring of wicked hags, changelings are often left in the cradles of their mortal parent’s people and raised without understanding what makes them different. They often feel disconnected from their communities early in life, the subtle call of their hag mother coaxing them to abandon those they love. This book presents the moon may, snow may, veil may, and virga may lineages for changelings descended from moon hags, winter hags, blood hags, and storm hags respectively.</p>
              <p><strong>Dhampir (Lyz Liddell):</strong>&nbsp;Dhampirs are mortals descended from a living and a vampiric parent. Marked forever by their hungers, some may learn to draw strength from the blood of others, while others drink subtler substances, such as pain. This book presents three new lineages, adhyabhau, cel rau, and ru-shi, for dhampirs descended from psychic, strigoi, and jiang-shi vampires.</p>
              <p><strong>Duskwalker (Mikhail Rekun):</strong>&nbsp;Reincarnated souls, duskwalkers gained leave to have one more chance at life. All duskwalkers have strong connections to their previous identities, but each must decide for themselves whether to learn more about their past or forge a new path. This book contains options for duskwalkers based on how their previous life ended.</p>
              <p><strong>Hobgoblin (Owen K.C. Stephens):</strong>&nbsp;Many hobgoblins have been drawn toward the nation of Oprak, which seeks to forge pacts and earn respect through methods other than war and conquest. While clearly related to their goblin cousins, hobgoblins are less frenetic and more careful planners. This book contains options for hobgoblins to assist their fellow warriors or to tap into the legendary Cantorian Spring—the source of the hobgoblin ancestry—to gain healing effects. It also introduces the shortshanks and steelskin hobgoblin heritages.</p>

              <p><strong>Kobold (Owen K.C. Stephens)</strong>:&nbsp;These expert trap makers often live in secluded places that most other ancestries eschew. Kobolds operate in a world of larger, stronger creatures who often dismiss them—until these cunning survivors reveal what they can unleash on their foes. This book contains options for kobolds to improve their use of traps and kobold weapons, and even to grow draconic wings. It also includes the caveclimber and tunnelflood kobold heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Leshy (Linda Zayas-Palmer)</strong>:&nbsp;Leshys are immortal spirits temporarily given mortal forms in bodies made of plants and fungi. Created by powerful primal rituals, leshys come into the world fully formed and self-sufficient, independent of any settlement or even the ritualist that gave them form. This book grows the leshy options by adding the cactus, fruit, lotus, root, and seaweed leshy heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Lizardfolk (Patchen Mortimer):</strong>&nbsp;The powerful reptilian lizardfolk call themselves iruxi and have a history that stretches back thousands of years. Patient and confident, lizardfolk explorers travel from their ancient nations to explore the world of younger ancestries and kingdoms. This book contains options for lizardfolk to gain insights from astrology or power from the bones of their ancestors and adds the cloudleaper and woodstalker lizardfolk heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Orc (Calder CaDavid)</strong>:&nbsp;Orcs were driven from their homelands by the dwarven Quest for Sky and thrust into a foreign world where they had to carve a place for themselves. A troubled history of warfare and grudges has left most orcs at odds with other surface ancestries. This book contains options for orcs to gain power from special painted warmasks. It also introduces the battle-ready, grave, and winter orc heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Ratfolk (Patchen Mortimer)</strong>:&nbsp;Small rodentlike humanoids, ratfolk are clever, adaptive, and communalist. Known amongst themselves as ysoki, ratfolk are natural explorers, travelers, and, most of all, merchants. This book contains options for ratfolk to squish, sneak, roll, and otherwise move about. It also adds the snow and tunnel rat heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Tengu (Eleanor Ferron)</strong>:&nbsp;The beaked and feathered tengu originate from Tian Xia. Nearly always in the minority, tengu have learned to use their knack for languages and blades to find space for themselves. This book contains options for tengu to store magic in specially made fans and adds the dogtooth and wavediver tengu heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Tiefling (Mikhail Rekun)</strong>:&nbsp;Tieflings are planar scions born with a fiendish stain in their blood. Though tieflings are not inherently evil, they are often mistrusted and many do find that fiendish powers and associated temptations come easily. This book presents the beastbrood, riftmarked, and shackleborn lineages for tieflings descended from rakshasas, qlippoths, and velstracs respectively.</p>

              <h3>New Ancestries and Heritages</h3>
              <p>The latter half of the book introduces new ancestries and heritages to Pathfinder Second Edition. Some of these entries include old favorites making their second edition premiere and even includes some brand new entries, each with their own rules options. The section includes the following entries.</p>
              <p><strong>Android (Jessica Catalan)</strong>:&nbsp;Brought to Golarion by a starship crash in the land of Numeria, androids are half organic, half-machine lifeforms produced by alien technology. Though often looked upon with fear by superstitious communities surrounding the crash site, changing politics and the rise of the android goddess Casandalee have led to androids expanding their influence in nearby regions. The section includes feats that allow androids to tap into the power of their nanites and the artisan, impersonator, laborer, polyglot, and warrior android heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Aphorite (Andrew Mullen)</strong>:&nbsp;Aphorites are beings with a mortal base infused with the pure essence of law by the enigmatic axiomites of Axis. Originally designed to form a diplomatic bridge between the perfect logic of the axiomites and the constant contradictions of free-willed creatures, aphorites’ ability to choose has seen them grow beyond their original intent and into their own people. This versatile heritage allows a character use the crystalline motes that cover their body to conceal themselves or their allies.</p>
              <p><strong>Beastkin (Luis Loza):</strong>&nbsp;While most werecreatures are cursed with bloodlust at the sight of the full moon, some of their kin are born without this dire affliction. These beastkin are a source of respect and envy among their fellows, as they also lack werecreatures’ burning vulnerability to silver. This versatile heritage allows for characters with a connection of animals of any type that can tap into their animalistic instincts and senses.</p>
              <p><strong>Fetchling (Andrew Mullen)</strong>:&nbsp;Fetchlings are scions of Ancient Azlant who escaped the cataclysm of Earthfall by fleeing to the Shadow Plane. As generations passed, more and more supernatural gloom seeped into these refugees until they evolved into something beyond their human origins. Fetchlings can gain control over their shadows and are shaped by the bright, deep, liminal, resolute, and wisp fetchling heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Fleshwarp (Ron Lundeen):</strong>&nbsp;Fleshwarps are beings transformed either by magic or by technology beyond Golarion’s ken. Most commonly, they result from drow or other sinister forces transforming their victims out of sadism, yet fleshwarps can also be created from scratch through magical or alchemical manipulation of raw tissue. Fleshwarps are capable of transforming their bodies further to gain darkvision or grow new weapons. Depending on the nature of their transformation, a fleshwarp will have the created, mutated, shapewrought, or technological fleshwarp heritage.</p>

              <p><strong>Ganzi (Isabelle Thorne):</strong>&nbsp;Born wherever and whenever they’re least expected, these scions of chaos rarely conform to any overarching culture among themselves. Ganzi reside in the greatest numbers in the nation of Holomog, with their influence spilling out into Nex, Geb, and the Mwangi Expanse. The ganzi versatile heritage allows characters to tap into the power of chaos and produce random magic or new body parts.</p>
              <p><strong>Geniekin (Jessica Redekop):&nbsp;</strong>Kin to the elements and infused with the power of the planes within the Inner Sphere, geniekin live scattered all over the world, especially wherever extreme environments provide a conduit to primal energy. Most commonly found in Katapesh and Qadira, many geniekin gather in small communities both within and outside of major cities. Geniekin include five new versatile heritages: ifrits, keepers of elemental fire; oreads, wardens of elemental earth; sylphs, followers of the freedom of elemental air; undines, individuals adaptable like elemental water; and sulis, embodiments of the complex relationships between multiple elements.</p>
              <p><strong>Kitsune (James Case):</strong>&nbsp;Kitsune change shapes as easily as clothing, often living undetected among other peoples. Though these mischievous tricksters almost never gather in numbers large enough for political clout, their natural charisma and cunning mean they can have a significant impact on worldly events. Kitune are wielders of powerful magic and have the celestial envoy, dark fields, earthly wilds, empty sky, and frozen wind kitsune heritages.</p>

              <p><strong>Sprite (Mark Seifter):</strong>&nbsp;As denizens of the First World, sprites sometimes tire of their realm where choices hold no permanence and consequences don’t matter. These Tiny fey venture into the Material Plane in hopes of making their own mark. Sprites can empower their wings to grant them flight and sprite heritages vary to include draxies, grigs, luminous sprites, melixies, nykterasm, and pixies.</p>
              <p><strong>Strix (Samantha Phelan):</strong>&nbsp;These avian humanoids maintain small populations within Cheliax and the surrounding environs. Long persecuted by the humanocentric rule of House Thrune, strix have been enemies of the Chelaxian state for almost a century. This section provides feats that allow strix to take to the skies and attack with their wings, as well as the nightglider, predator, scavenger, shoreline, and songbird strix heritages.</p>
              <p><strong>Ancestral Gear (Luis Loza):</strong>&nbsp;The book’s final section provides new weapons and magic items with ties to the ancestries of Golarion.</p>
