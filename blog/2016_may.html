               <p itemprop="description"><a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon 2016</a> has come to a close, but the Pathfinder Society team is gearing up for tons of new programs and material that we showed off at the Paizo Preview Banquet Saturday evening.

               <h2>Pathfinder Society Academy</h2> 
               <p>What better way is there to begin a blog than with a great way to begin one's roleplaying experience? <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5licg">Back in January</a>, Tonya first announced Pathfinder Academy, an expansion of the "Kid's Track" games offered at <a href="http://gencon.com" target="_blank">Gen Con</a> for the past several years. We've since contracted authors for new scenarios, worked with Venture-Captains Michael VonHasseln and Lucas Servideo to create new lesson plans, and have a complete set of new quests on the way for eager young gamers to play. These will debut at Gen Con, and afterward we're exploring ways to distribute these adventures to convention organizers to provide kid-friendly content at events worldwide. In addition, we are working on a scenario rating system that identifies adult themes and ways to adjust the scenarios for our younger players.</p> 
               <p>As a sign of things to come, we're excited to share the new product's temporary logo (still a work in progress)!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Logos/PFS-Academy.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Logos/PFS-Academy_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <h2>Adventure Card Guild</h2> 
               <p>There's a lot in the pipeline for the <a href="/pfsacg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a>. A few weeks ago, Tanis announced the upcoming <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lish">Season of the Goblin</a> (or, We Be Card Goblins, as it's affectionally referred to in-house), which not only provides use two months of goblin carnage but also ties into the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> Class Decks. Tanis tends to giggle evilly and then show off preview art every time we bring up this topic, so it's only right that we introduce you to one of the upcoming goblin "heroes," Zibini, the Great and Goobly. As you might guess from her art, she's a powerful diviner able to foretell what goblins will fight and what they will burn—which is to say everything. Season of the Goblin will combine Tanis' dastardly mechanics with story from author Jason Keeley, whose work most recently featured in <em>#7-23 Abducted in Aether</em>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <br> <i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>
               </div> 
               <p>As the Season of the Goblin winds to a close, the long-anticipated <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Mummy's Mask</a> will be hitting the shelves. Once it does, we'll be launching the Season of the Mummy, sending Pathfinders into the tombs of Osirion to do battle with the evils that sleep beneath the sands.</p> 
               <p>Finally, PaizoCon was an excellent opportunity to refine and introduce special convention rewards for playing the Adventure Card Guild at conventions. For about five years, the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild has offered special "convention boons" at registered events of 15 sessions or more. Last year Tanis and I worked together to create a handful of similar rewards—can't quite call them boons, as that's an existing game term—to distribute at Gen Con, and we've since honed the process to present a set of special rewards for each season of Guild play. We're especially proud of not only the smaller page format (much easier to pack alongside your <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks">Class Deck</a>) but also of the thematic tie-ins to the season. At PaizoCon you may have spotted the Thassilonian Ritual rewards, which allow your character to gain a long-term benefit at the cost of leaving her vulnerable to that sin's foibles. We're designating several of these for distribution to events worldwide, and several are going to be special rewards available at only a handful of conventions such as PaizoCon, PaizoCon UK, Gen Con, and Origins.</p>

               </div> 
               <h2>Roleplaying Guild</h2> 
               <p>Finally, we announced the next season of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild: Year of the Stolen Storm. The organized play program has always been an excellent way to present adventures in a wide variety of places, including those yet to be seen in Adventure Paths or Modules. With this mission, the Society has extensively—but not exhaustively—explored the Inner Sea region over the past eight years, but beyond regular visits to Tian Xia and the Hao Jin Tapestry demiplane, it has traveled beyond this region only rarely. For years I've looked for ways to dabble in some extraplanar travel, and for Season 8 I proposed not just dipping the Society's toes in the water but diving in completely.</p> 
               <p>During the Year of the Stolen Storm, the Society turns its sights to the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. There, agents can not only recover extraordinary treasures but also embroil themselves in extraplanar politics and clash with otherworldly organizations. Over the course of the season, we've planned at least two adventures in each of the Elemental Planes, and in defiance of what I consider the conventional wisdom of planar adventures (i.e. it's only for high-level PCs), we've found some fun ways to let PCs of all levels get in on the action. In anticipation of the adventures to come, Paizo's releasing <a href="/products/btpy9k5n"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Planes of Power</em></a> in August 2016, expanding on the current elemental lore many times over as well as providing new character options that could come in handy while traveling so far afield.</p> 
               <p>Even as we send Pathfinders to distant realms, we'll still have business at home to handle. Look forward to exciting adventures on the Material Plane that continue ongoing stories, travel to unseen lands, and uncover forgotten secrets. The Year of the Stolen Storm is looking to be the best season yet!</p>

               <p>The <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> launches in just a couple months at Gen Con 2016. In Strange Aeons, heroes will be up against cosmic horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos, new monsters, mind-shattering terrors, and explore far beyond the known lands of Golarion. More information and previews will be available on the Paizo blog as we get closer!</p> 
               <p>We also announced the Adventure Path that will be following Strange Aeons at the Banquet, and I got some help from star story-teller and Developer Crystal Fraiser to give you an introduction to The Ironfang Invasion:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>When the PCs witness their hometown of Phaendar destroyed in the first steps of an all-out war of conquest, they begin a quest that leads them from desperate survival to heroes of legend as they push back against the monstrous Ironfang Legion. This ruthless army—helmed by the hobgoblin General Azaersi and empowered by an ancient artifact known as the Onyx Key—intend to claim both Nirmathas and Molthune while the isolated nations bicker with one another. The heroes' quest will take them deep into the fey-haunted Fangwood Forest, to the craggy bluffs of western Nirmathas, and delve deep into the earth to explore the Darklands. Can a small band of refugees grow into champions and push back against Azaersi's horde, or will the Ironfang Invasion give way to and Ironfang nation?</p> 
                <p>The Ironfang Invasion calls back to classic adventures, focusing on exploring the unknown and confronting the fantastic, all to stop a monstrous enemy from wiping out the good people of Nirmathas and Molthune. The PCs will delve into dungeons, siege well-guarded keeps, explore the wilderness, and battle some of the most iconic creatures from the 40-year history of fantasy RPGs.</p>

               <h2>Society Happenings</h2> 
               <p>Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge proudly announced Season 8 of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild: The Year of the Stolen Storm. Beginning at Gen Con 2016, Pathfinders of all levels will be able to travel to the Elemental Planes, clash with extraplanar rivals, and harness the raw energies of the Inner Sphere. Joining the Society in this endeavor will be a host of genie-kin as ifrits, oreads, sylphs, and undines become always available for play in the organized play campaign. To help kick off Season 8, the team will also release a complete set of updated Faction Journal Cards. Also look for new Pathfinder Academy—an updated and expanded Kids' Track program for young gamers—debuting at Gen Con!</p> 
               <p>The Adventure Card Guild's Season of the Runelords is in full swing, including a host of new rewards to distribute at upcoming conventions. Once we've defeated the Runelords, we're launching a new mini-season, Season of the Goblin, that follows the events of the <em>We Be Goblins</em> adventures. The much-anticipated <a href="/products/btpy9mbg"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> hits stores shortly after that, and the team has announced that the Season of the Mummy will be quick to follow. Several new authors are lending their talents to the upcoming Adventure Card Guild scenarios, including Amanda Hamon Kunz, Jason Keeley, Tonya Woldridge, and Linda Zayas-Palmer.</p> 
               <p>Pathfinder Society agents, stay tuned for a more detailed update from the PFS team about these announcements on Tuesday, June 1st!</p> 
               <h2>Publisher Previews</h2> 
               <p>During the Banquet, Erik unveiled a number of new sculpts for the line of <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles miniatures</a>. However, folks are going to have to sit tight for his preview blog this upcoming Friday for images of the just-announced sculpts from the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> release.</p> 
               <p>We've still got another day of PaizoCon 2016! Until we meet again!</p>

               <p>Until now.</p> 
               <p>Next August, Paizo will be releasing the <a href="/starfinder">Starfinder Roleplaying Game</a>—a new science fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder universe and rules, but complete and standalone. It'll be backward compatible, so you can still use all those Pathfinder RPG bestiaries, but will feature all sorts of new classes, races, equipment, and other elements uniquely suited to our far-future setting. You want to play a lashunta technomancer using magic to hack the defense grid, or an android assassin with a laser rifle, or a ysoki ratfolk mechanic clambering around the guts of a spaceship as you blast your way through the enemy blockade? This is the place for it. There will also be new races you've never seen before, new worlds beyond Golarion's system that we've never visited, new twists on magic and the rules system itself—and, of course, ton and tons of cool science fantasy gear, from starships and computers to infinitely sharp zero-edge swords and rune-augmented plasma cannons.</p> 
               <p>The <em>Starfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> will be releasing at Gen Con 2017, but that's not all—we're also going to be starting a monthly Starfinder Adventure Path in addition to our ongoing Pathfinder Adventure Paths. The Starfinder AP volumes will include both adventures and cool new rules and setting information to help expand your Starfinder game. Plus monsters. Lots of monsters.</p> 
               <p>So how does all this science fantasy goodness fit into the Pathfinder setting? Simple: Starfinder is set in Golarion's solar system, but far in a possible future—one in which the gods have mysteriously spirited Golarion away to an unknown location, and refuse to answer questions about it. In its place, the cultures of that world have evolved and spread throughout the solar system, especially to a vast space platform called Absalom Station. Gifted access to a hyperspace dimension by an ascended AI deity, the residents of the system suddenly find themselves with the ability to travel faster than light, and the race is on to explore and colonize potentially millions of worlds. But there are horrors out there in the darkness...</p> 
               <p>As the Creative Director of Starfinder, I can't wait to show you everything we've been building. Joining me as key players on Team Starfinder are longtime Paizo developers Rob McCreary and Owen KC Stephens, as well as Creative Design Director Sarah Robinson on the art side, but all the designers, developers, art staff, and editors are working on different parts of the project—it's an all-hands-on-deck affair. And it's not just us, either—as Starfinder will be released under the OGL, we're looking forward to robust third-party support of the game.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>While the size and scope of the new game make a full public playtest infeasible, we'll be starting to bring in key community members to check it out in the next few months, so keep an eye on the blog for your chance to participate! In the meantime, we wanted to give you a sneak preview of some preliminary concept sketches for Absalom Station, androids, and ysoki from artist Taylor Fischer (who you might know from games like XCOM and Civilization)—while these are only our initial explorations, and far from final, it's fun to see the process as things change and evolve. And it's never too early to chime in and chat with us in <a href="/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/starfinder">the new Starfinder forum!</a></p> 
               <p>We hope you're as excited about <a href="/starfinder">Starfinder</a> as we are, and that you'll join us as we boldly go where Paizo's never gone before!</p>

               <p>In <a href="/products/btpy9ips"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #107: Scourge of the Godclaw</em></a>, the PC villains leave behind the politics and parties of Egorian, and embark on a much more dangerous mission: creating a legendary weapon that can defeat the armies of the Glorious Reclamation in one stroke. To do so, however, they'll need to retake a captured Hellknight citadel, help a paladin fall, take on a gold dragon who was a companion of Iomedae herself, deal with a secret Hellknight order, and carry out some seriously vile rituals across all of Cheliax.</p> 
               <p>With that done, it's time for our villains to finally take the fight to the Glorious Reclamation itself in their newly conquered capital in <a href="/products/btpy9jd0"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #108: Hell Comes to Westcrown</em></a>. But first, the wicked PCs get to try out their new weapon. Have you ever wanted to play a nightwalker? Well now you can (temporarily at least), and there are plenty of do-gooder knights to test yourself against. Finally, the villains go toe-to-toe with the Lord Marshal of the Glorious Reclamation and her allies—with the fate of Cheliax hanging in the balance!</p> 
               <p>There's a lot more still to come of course, but until then, check out some of the exciting art featured in the final two volumes of the Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path!</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">A Wild PaizoCon Appears!</h1> 
              <p class="date">Tuesday, May 24, 2016</p> 
              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p>I hope you're making the trek to the Emerald City this weekend for <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>! (Current weather: 63 degrees and partly sunny. Rain Friday, sunny the rest of the weekend, highs around 65.) Below, a primer on Adventure Card Game goings-on at the show.</p> 
               <h2>Season the Runelords Marchs (Mays?) Onward</h2> 
               <p itemprop="description">PaizoCon attendees will get the opportunity to play <a href="/pfsacg/products/season2">Season of the Runelords</a> all the way up through <em>Adventure 3: Into the Mountain</em> and will even get a sneak peek at <em>Adventure 4: Abjurant Halls of Envy</em>. I just wrote the mechanics for a scenario currently called "Look! A Monkey!" which I expect to be the start of a long and extended death-glare aimed in my direction by you, the fans. Just remember that you're the ones who went into something called the Abjurant Halls of Envy, and complaints can be delivered directly to me. I'm the one who looks like Mike Selinker.</p> 
               <p>While I'm on the subject of Adventure 4, I have more happy news. I've secured the talents of the brilliant Amanda Hamon Kunz to help with story design for the rest of Season of the Runelords. Amanda's design work has lately been featured in books including <a href="/products/btpy9j6p"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9gro"><em>Distant Shores</em></a>, and her writing work shines in <a href="/products/btpy9hdv"><em>Cheliax: The Infernal Empire</em></a>. I'm ecstatic to have a new story collaborator for this season, and if we're very nice to her she might join me again for later seasons. (Previous story collaborators have included Brian Campbell, Dave Gross, Keith Richmond, and Mike Selinker.)</p> 
               <p>Oh, and I'm bringing advance copies of June's <a href="/products/btpy9icp">Witch</a> and August's <a href="/products/btpy9ipq">Gunslinger</a> Class Decks for folks to play with. Drop by the ACG section of the PFS ballroom and game with us!</p> 
               <h2>Adventure Card Game Open Playtest</h2> 
               <p>Those of you lucky enough to get into this lottery event will get to help me hone one of the quarterfinal rounds of this year's Adventure Card Game Open, which will take place at Gen Con. What you see there cannot be unseen, because if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also. But mostly because that's how human eyes work.</p> 
               <h2>We Be Goblins! You Be Goblins! Everybody Be Goblins!</h2> 
               <p>Another lottery event! This time, ACG players and forum rock stars <a href="/people/cartmanbeck">cartmanbeck</a> and <a href="/people/TheryonStormrune">Theryon Stormrune</a> have put together a custom set of scenarios to play through inspired by the storylines of the <em>We Be Goblins</em> series of <a href="/pathfinder/modules/freeRPGDay">Free RPG Day adventures</a>. Theryon and I will be running your tables, so I hope you bring your best goblin game faces. I also hope Theryon brings <a href="/threads/rzs2todl">a certain culinary treat</a>, but I don't know if those can travel cross-country or not.</p> 
               <h2>Learn to Play Mummy's Mask</h2> 
               <p>We've just received the happy news that our <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask">Mummy's Mask</a> demo decks will be at the show! Stop by the ACG section of the PFS ballroom for a 30-45 minute demo. You can learn to play the game, get a sneak peek at the characters, and earn a free deck upgrade for a PFSACG character (one per player per season; this demo counts as Season of the Runelords).</p> 
               <h2>Grand Convocation Scavenger Hunt</h2> 
               <p>PaizoCon presents lots of great ways to play games and interact with Paizo fans and staff, but where does one begin? Why not participate in the Grand Convocation scavenger hunt, which rewards you with a special benefit in the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and Adventure Card Guild organized play programs for every highlight you hit? Play games, meet staff, and walk away with new ways to experience Golarion! Pick up your scavenger hunt sheet at the Pathfinder Society headquarters in the Grand Ballroom.</p> 
               <h2>Something Punny About Seminars</h2> 
               <p>The "What's New in the Adventure Card Game" panel is Saturday at 2 pm, and Mike, Vic and I—and perhaps some other Lone Sharks—will be there to answer your questions and make up wildly improbable stories about card design and development. We'll also have a little something to say about Mummy's Mask at the PaizoCon Preview Banquet Saturday night. And I'll try and sneak into the "Pathfinder Society Q&amp;A" on Sunday at 2:00 PM in case anyone has questions about PFSACG matters. Finally, Obsidian Entertainment will be doing a "Pathfinder Adventures" panel Sunday at 11:00 AM that will be worth your time. (Everyone feel free to ask those panelists when <em>Hook Mountain Massacre</em> is coming out so that I stop getting that question in email.)</p> 
               <h2>Recurring Art Thing</h2> 
               <p>Hooray! It's time for more excellent art from the PACG archives! From the upcoming Goblins Fight! Deck, the Animalbane Crossbow +2.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Convention season for us is a lot like hosting a large gathering of family and friends for a major holiday: preparing way more dishes than usual, aiming for more spectacular fare than we would otherwise cook, and fretting about whether great-aunt Matilda will critique how we made the pie crust. From dicing the first onion to the moment where everyone sits down and takes the first bite of food, there’s always the question of whether everything turned out just right. Sometimes, though, you can just tell that everything’s fallen into place before even seeing your guests’ expressions. In my extended analogy, while Tonya, Todd Morgan, and Bob Jonquet have handled our seating arrangements and sending out invitations, I think my co-chefs Linda, Thurston Hillman, and Jason Keeley can agree that the menu this year turned out great.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>One year ago, I ran an increasingly infamous session of <a href="/products/btpy9cu0"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a> at <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> for a handful of noteworthy hooligans. One of the chief takeaways from this event was the tradition of shouting "Druma Lodge" whenever somebody mentioned Druma, lodges, money, or a host of other keywords that we have developed since then. The esteemed contributor and <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a> author Thurston Hillman was among the more...rambunctious participants, and after the game we got to talking about how the Society had done so little in Druma and what a Druman adventure <span class="messageboard-ooc">[Druma Lodge!]</span> might look like. <a href="/products/btpy9k95"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-22: Bid for Alabastrine</em></a> has grown and evolved in really amazing ways since then, including the incorporation of some Serpents Rise metaplot, so if you have a Spoils of the Siege boon, it might pay to have it on hand to show the GM during this adventure. As fair warning, this Tier 1-5 adventure features both roleplaying and dealing with people whose outfits cost more than your PC might earn by 10th level. Be prepared to hobnob with the high'n'mighty—including these two kalistocrats depicted by Marko Horvatin—but keep an eye out for danger!</p> 
               <p>The uninitiated might assume that I invite editors to write adventures because their manuscripts are pristine and a delight to develop. Although that's true, I've also found that Paizo's editors—including Justin Juan with <a href="/products/btpy95eb">#5-21: "The Merchant's Wake"</a> and Joe Homes in <a href="/products/btpy9ch1">#6-17: "Fires of Karamoss"</a>—are among the more creative narrators and insightful creators to work on the campaign. This time I was especially familiar with editor <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lha8">Jason Keeley's</a> work on the <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics">Pathfinder Comics</a> backmatter and his discerning feedback while editing scenarios, so I felt that this was the guy who could handle a high-level adventure set on another plane. I have since confirmed how delightfully inventive he can be, especially in portraying otherworldly NPCs. <a href="/products/btpy9k96"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-23: Abducted in Aether</em></a> concludes the Master of Spells mini-arc of Season 7 and features several popular NPCs, including the commanding night hag depicted here by Dion Harris (who has also created the excellent artwork for the earlier parts of this story).</p>

               </div> 
               <p><a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon's</a> not complete without a special event. In addition to <a href="/products/btpy9ctz"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-97: Siege of Serpents</em></a>, last year players had the special opportunity in <a href="/products/btpy9cu0"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a> to portray capable Aspis Consortium agents who got to (figuratively and literally) punch Pathfinders in the face. I've really enjoyed hearing from players about their experience with the accompanying pregenerated characters and how they hoped to see those characters appear again in the organized play storyline. Over the course of Season 7, authors have helped us incorporate this motley cast into several more adventures, and it only made sense to get the gang back together for one more epic heist in <a href="/products/btpy9lzy"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-98: Serpents' Ire</em></a>. And epic it is. Even if you're not terribly familiar with the campaign setting, there's a lot of action, a splash of intrigue, and hefty serving of the unexpected. If you enjoy the organized play metaplot, keep an eye out for all sorts of extras that might hint at what's happening elsewhere in the world and what is to come. This was an absolute blast to write (including the *ahem* lovable Iaovin Ratarion, depicted here by Javier Charro), and I hope folks enjoy playing and GMing it.</p> 
               <p>In fact, I might need to assemble another group of yahoos to do just that. You'll know it's us because while everyone else in the room is signing Chronicle sheets, we'll still be stuck on the first scene thanks to having spent hours designing a team uniform, hiding bodies, and coming up with elaborate plans to attack buildings that have nothing to do with the adventure. <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> is great like that.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Here we have the Ankhrav Drone, a new name for a classic creature found on page 15 of the <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary</em></a>. The story behind this burrowing, bug-like monster's origin is quite interesting. The standard version, with a name gate-locked by our inability to include the Open Game License on the bottom of every figure, also was saddled with an illustration that wasn't too inspiring, and that didn't seem to me like it would make a good miniature. Still, it's a very useful creature in general, and eventually I want to make sure we make every creature in the first <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><em>Bestiary</em></a> (if not all the others), so I had a lot of impetus to make the figure, but knew we'd need a better illustration (for minis purposes) AND a new name for the creature. Enter the <a href="/pathfinder/campaignSetting">Pathfinder Campaign Setting</a> book <a href="/products/btpy9aue"><em>Belkzen, Hold of the Orc Lords</em></a>. That book introduced the Ankhrav, a Huge cousin of the classic <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><em>Bestiary</em></a> monster, and positioned it more as a brood queen for the standard Large version of the character. It also had a very cool illustration that, when coupled with the re-do we put into the <a href="/products/btpy8tj5"><em>Pathfinder Pawns Bestiary Box</em></a> created the new look for this creature. I'm pretty happy with how it all turned out, and look forward to having this guy burrow his way up from under my player characters! The Ankhrav Drone is a Large figure at the uncommon rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160520-Gynosphinx.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160520-Gynosphinx_360.jpeg"></a> 
               </div> 
               <p>The Gynosphinx is a classic dungeon creature that we've somehow not managed to produce in more than 10 <a href="/pathfinder/battles">Pathfinder Battles</a> sets. I think we've been waiting for the right piece of art, and with this version, we've finally got it. Sure, she's a bit Liz Taylor, but I'd hardly call that a problem. Ahem. Anyway, the Gynosphinx is a Large, rare figure. </p>
               <p>And that's all I've got for this week. We will likely NOT have a Publisher Preview next week, as I'll be at <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> with the rest of the Paizo staff. I WILL be revealing some new figures at the Preview Banquet on Saturday night, though, so keep your eyes on the Internet to see if you can't find some camera phone photos before we formally share them here after the convention.</p> 
               <p>And if you ARE coming to <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>, don't forget the 9th-annual Miniatures Trading Afterparty in the hotel bar immediately after the conclusion of the convention on Monday. I'll have piles of <a href="/pathfinder/battles">Pathfinder Battles</a> goodies, and it's a great chance to swap doubles with other miniatures fiends in the community. Plastic, metal, painted, unpainted. Bring it all! Dump stuff you don't want anymore for new stuff you never knew you wanted. It's one of my favorite parts of the convention, and I look forward to seeing many of you there!</p> 
               <p>Until then (and after), I remain...</p>

              <p class="date">Thursday, May 19, 2016</p> 
              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">In my position as Organized Play Coordinator, I work with many of Paizo's volunteers.

All of these volunteers strengthen our community, and without them our jobs would be much harder.</p> 
               <p>In acknowledgement of volunteer efforts, Paizo developed two different methods of recognition. As a thank you for exceptional volunteerism within the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a>, we previously established the Campaign Service Coin. In addition, Paizo takes the opportunity at PaizoCon to name one or more people as Volunteers of the Year.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSCSC-front.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSCSC-front_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSCSC-back.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSCSC-back_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <h2>Campaign Service Coin</h2> 
               <p>Tradition held that a Venture-Officer received a coin near their three-year anniversary, as this represented more than 1,000 days of service. A few volunteers that were not Venture-Officers earned coins, usually for outstanding service at Gen Con and PaizoCon. Fifty-four Pathfinder Society Volunteers have received coins since the program's inception.</p> 
               <p>One question I've had over the past few months is "When will I get my coin?" This question led me to examine my interpretation of the Coin's meaning. I don't feel it is a check box achievement. It should not be a reward you receive automatically when you hit a date. Nor should you not get one because you haven't reached the date yet. I think putting a number to the award lessens the impact of receiving it. Instead, I see three years as a flag. In most situations, a volunteer working three years is well known in their community and anyone asked provides me with numerous examples of the volunteers' commitment to the campaign. But some of our most deserving volunteers are not members of the Venture-Officer team and thus their efforts fall under the radar for recognition.</p> 
               <p>So I turn to members of the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a> for help. I request that you send me your recipient recommendations for the Campaign Service Coin award. Nominate the local GM who is dedicated to the game, running every week for years. Tell me about the event organizer that is on site before the room opens, leaves after it is closed, and fields issues like a pro. I want to hear about the player who constantly takes time to introduce new players to the game. These people may be part of the Venture-Officer team, but they may be individuals that are helping out just to make our Society better.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/Blog/20160519-VotY.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20160519-VotY_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <h2>Volunteer of the Year</h2> 
               <p>While many recipients of the Volunteer of the Year award are members of the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a> organized play campaign, it is neither a requirement nor an expectation that they should be. The largest difference is that the Campaign Service Coin acknowledges service to the Society while the Volunteer of the Year looks to the community as a whole. Past recipients include:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>2008: Tim Nightengale</li> 
                <li>2009: Liz Courts</li> 
                <li>2010: Mark Moreland</li> 
                <li>2011: Doug Miles</li> 
                <li>2012: Kyle Elliott</li> 
                <li>2013: Dave Harrison &amp; Rob Silk</li> 
                <li>2014: Ryan Costello &amp; Jefferson Jay Thacker</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>Names often don't convey the weight of the contributions to Paizo as a whole. Tim Nightengale has been a long-time member of the community, organizing the first unofficial PaizoCon and continuing to be an ambassador to newcomers to the convention. Liz Courts established <a href="/companies/paizoFansUnited"><em>Wayfinder</em></a>, the fan-run Pathfinder fanzine that continues publication today under the editorial direction of Tim Nightengale. Mark Moreland established <a href="http://pathfinderwiki.com" target="_blank">PathfinderWiki</a>, the repository of knowledge for all things Pathfinder. Doug Miles is one of <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society's</a> super GMs, having reported over 500 sessions, and was the first five-star GM. Kyle Elliott was a driving force behind <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a> and helped out at many conventions. Dave Harrison and Rob Silk established <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a> in England and co-organized <a href="http://paizocon.co.uk" target="_blank">PaizoCon UK</a>, one of two Paizo sanctioned conventions outside the US. Ryan Costello and Jefferson Jay Thacker operate <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com" target="_blank">Know Direction</a>, the podcast for all things Pathfinder.</p> 
               <p>Each of these recipients has contributed significantly to Paizo's community, spreading the word of Pathfinder far and wide and embodying the best that our community has to offer. Without their efforts and support, our group would be less rich, less vibrant, less a community. To them, I raise a toast and a cheer, for demonstrating what we can do when we give of ourselves.</p> 
               <p>In just over a week, we will migrate from the Paizo offices and head to the Doubletree for PaizoCon: the perfect venue to meet our players and spend time with members of the community. At Saturday's banquet, we get the opportunity to announce the newest Volunteer of the Year. I, for one, can't wait to see who is added to this distinguished list. If you are unable to join us at the banquet, follow our social media on <a href="http://facebook.com/paizo" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/paizo" target="_blank">Twitter</a> as we bring you highlights from the show!</p> 
               <p>To all those members of our community that help out—from carrying things at events to maintaining player databases to organizing conventions to teaching new players and GMs—thank you. From the bottom of my heart, my teammates and I thank you for your hours spent furthering our hobby.</p> 
               <p>See you at PaizoCon!</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">When I joined Obsidian Entertainment last year, because of my background as a tabletop game designer, I was asked if I wanted to work with the <a href="https://pathfinder.obsidian.net/" target="_blank">Pathfinder Adventures</a> team. Even though it meant having to work with Mike Selinker—<i>Hi, Mike!</i>—it sounded like an awful lot of fun to go back to my card game roots for a bit and, frankly, I flat-out love the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>. So I said yes—of course I'd love to see what cool things we could bring to the game on the electronic side that simply aren't possible in the physical space.</p> 
               <p>Our biggest goal was to expand replayability to make sure the electronic version of the game is an amazing value with tons and tons of fun gameplay. The first step was working out the difficulty system that Nathan has <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5likm">already talked about</a>, which allows you to play the same scenario multiple times and still have it feel fresh and fun. The wildcard powers in particular mix things up so that even when you replay the same scenario you just completed, things still feel new.</p> 
               <p>But that's still essentially replaying the same scenarios that many of us have already played over and over. Couldn't we use the computer running the game to generate a new adventure whenever we want one, so that we'll <i>always</i> have fresh scenarios to play? Thus, the concept of Quest Mode was born: Mixing and matching existing scenario powers, locations, villains, and henchmen to create new experiences.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160517-Screen1.jpg">
                <br> <i>Quest Mode, engaged!</i>
               </div> 
               <h2>How Random Is Too Random?</h2> 
               <p>Randomness is great, but sometimes things that are truly random are also truly terrible—my first CD player's random mode once repeated the same song four times in a row. That's entirely possible in a truly random system (even if there's only a 1:1,728 chance of it happening on a 12-song album), but it's still not what you want. Randomness is supposed to keep things fresh!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160517-Screen2_360.jpeg">
               </div> 
               <p>So we looked at places where randomness would result in less fun. A perfect example of this is the scenario Local Heroes. It's a fun scenario, but it completely breaks down in Quest Mode's "grab a scenario and add a villain and some henchmen" mechanic. First problem: there's no villain! And what if you're randomly given a bunch of locations that don't have many allies—or <i>any</i> allies? The whole thing can grind to a halt.</p> 
               <p>So we pulled things like this out of the pool of possible combinations. If a card wasn't going to play nice with Quest Mode, it had to step away from Quest Mode... for now. We ended up with 10 scenario powers, 10 villains, more than 20 sets of henchmen, and multiple maps, so there are more than 10,000 different adventures to be had—and that's before you start calculating different location configurations (and linkages for Legendary difficulty!) and possible wildcard combinations.</p> 
               <p>We do have the ability to build connections beyond pure randomness, so as we're able to spend more time developing Quest Mode, more "hand-crafted" adventures will be appearing. Certain combinations of scenarios, villains, and maps that are designed to work together will appear together more frequently (or even exclusively together).</p> 
               <h2>Bring on the XP!</h2> 
               <p>Another cool thing we can do in Quest Mode is bring the game a little closer to its tabletop RPG roots. We knew as soon as we started talking about this mode that we wanted to use an XP and leveling system where you'd get XP for each monster and obstacle you overcome in addition to the usual rewards for finishing a scenario. That level of granularity for tracking progression would get in the way with the tabletop game, but it's something we can do well in the electronic space. That meant we could have many levels for progression, and therefore more rewards.</p> 
               <p>Speaking of progression, we need to call out and give a big thanks to the Pathfinder Society—the <a href="/pfsacg">PFS Adventure Card Guild</a> progression system gave us a very clear path for developing our Quest Mode progression.</p> 
               <h2>The Future of Quest Mode</h2> 
               <p>So, that's a little look at the history of Quest Mode. But what does the future hold? One of the first new things coming to Quest Mode will be hand-crafted scenarios that deliver new scenarios, villains, and henchmen that players haven't seen before, and special combinations that raise the challenge level higher than we've seen before—with commensurate rewards, of course! And after that?</p> 
               <p>Well, the obvious direction is "bigger and better." Frankly, I'm not allowed to tell you too much more yet. But the thing to remember is that since Quest Mode is outside the boundaries of the Rise of the Runelords storyline that Paizo and Lone Shark delivered, Obsidian has a bit more freedom to roam and present new characters, stories, and rewards! I know that I'm genuinely excited about it, and I think everyone will really enjoy it.</p>

After four days of very little sleep, they help tear down the Sagamore, disassembling everything we built days before, packing up the pallets, rolling banners, and compiling a list of GM feedback. Only when everything is torn down and ready to return to Seattle do they take a breather and stop thinking Gen Con 2016. Then, a few weeks later, they review the feedback, read through the many post-Gen Con forum threads, and start thinking about Gen Con 50. The amount of time these volunteers spend putting the show together is immense and I cannot say thank you enough to them for all they do!</p>

               <p>While writing last Moonday's blog, I realized there was way too much information I wanted to share and including it all would lead to reader overload. So I saved some of the Gen Con information for this week. It's also time to start the next Pathfinder Society Competition!</p>

               <p>Without further ado—your leads!</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b>Jon Cary</b>—Jon started volunteering for Paizo at Gen Con in 2011. The next year, he was appointed Lead. This is Jon's sixth Gen Con with the Pathfinder Society. In addition, he was the Venture-Captain of the Dallas-Fort Worth area from September 2011 to December 2014. Jon is our tech guru, the master of the database, and wrangler of the HQ volunteers. Most importantly, he keeps an eye on Bob and Todd and preserves the OPC's sanity.</p> 
                <p><b>Bob Jonquet</b>—GM herder extraordinaire, 2016 marks Bob's third year as Gen Con Co-Lead. He joined the Pathfinder Society at the outset and was a Tier 1 Gen Con GM in 2010, the first of many years of volunteering for Society events. Bob also leads the volunteer brigade at PaizoCon. When asked for a blurb, Bob wrote, "In his spare time Bob likes long walks on the beach, eating ice cream, and protecting the citizens of Gotham from evil".</p> 
                <p><b>Todd Morgan</b>—The quite one, Todd shoulders the daunting task of organizing the data entry crew and is keeper of the reporting sheets. At 180 tables a slot and 10 slots, that is over 1800 pieces of paper to track. As a result of being holder of the paper, Todd shoulders the responsibility of fixing any reporting errors. This is Todd's third year of leading Gen Con volunteers. Todd is also one of two co-leads for PaizoCon. In his spare time, he plays in a band.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>New for this year, we are adding Department Heads to the Gen Con leadership. They are responsible for coordinating tasks within their areas, getting volunteers breaks, handling on-site issues, and making sure players have a fantastic experience.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b>GMs</b>—Venture-Captain Bobby Harring<br> <b>Marshals</b>—Venture-Captain Seth Brummond<br> <b>Non-Marshal HQ Volunteers</b>—Venture-Captain Walter Sheppard<br> <b>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Demonstrators</b>—Venture-Captain Dominick Trascritti<br> <b>Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</b>—Venture-Captain Micah Daniels<br> <b>Pathfinder Society Academy</b>—Venture-Captain Lucas Servideo</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>At this time, every volunteer should have received their schedule and replied to their appropriate Lead—Bob for GMs and Jon for HQ. Badges have been placed in Gen Con accounts. If you don't see a badge under your "my packet" category on the Gen Con website, please email me and I will look into the issue. I will start looking at room assignments After PaizoCon and will send another email with roommate information to those that qualified for a Paizo room.</p> 
               <p>As a result of planning months out, there are always cancellations. We are still taking applications for volunteers as a "wait list" to fill the inevitable holes in our schedule. Check out the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie2">Gen Con 2016 Call for Volunteers blog</a> if you are interested in being on the wait list.</p> 
               <p>Finally, a GIGANTIC thank you to all the volunteers! Without you, the Pathfinder Society would not have the capacity to offer all the wonderful games and experiences to the attendees of Gen Con. Raise your glass high and toast your efforts! Huzzah!</p> 
               <h2>Character Sketch Competition</h2> 
               <p>Switching gears—it's time for another competition. For this one, break out your crayons, pencils, pens, paints, pastels, inks, or markers and a clean sheet of paper. The theme of this competition is <b>Character Portrait</b>. We are looking for either headshot or full body pieces of your Pathfinder Society characters.</p> 
               <p>As with past competitions, there are a few rules:</p>

               <p>This week, I'd like to show off a couple of the minor devils in the set—the Lemure and the Accuser.</p>

               <p>Here we have the Lemure, and from where I sit I'm not certain that we've ever produced a figure quite so ugly. And I mean that in the nicest possible way! The <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a> describes Lemure Devils as the least of devilkind, shapeless masses of quivering flesh. They are further described as "grotesque and useless." I beg to differ on that last point! I can see swarms of these guys converging upon my player characters. The Lemure is a CR 1 Medium figure at the common rarity.</p>

               <p>Our second fiend today comes from the pages of <a href="/products/btpy8hif"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</em></a>, which describes them as "childlike souls tormented and scoured of innocence by the flames of Hell and then reshaped by the mad whims of the archdevil Baalzebul." Accuser devils embody the foul, merciless, and pervasive corruptions of Hell. At CR 3, they also make for great group encounters. This gross little guy is slated at the common rarity, making him perfect for an otherworldly ambush by the party's devilish foes. The Accuser Devil is a Small figure.</p> 
               <p>There are a lot more devils coming in <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, but I've made my own infernal promise to drag these previews out until October, so I'm afraid they'll have to wait for future previews!</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain...</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p>This week is just a quick data dump ahead of Gen Con's <a href="https://www.gencon.com/event_finder" target="_blank">event registration on Sunday</a> to let you know what we've got on tap for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game at the show. I am both excited and terrified to let you in on some secrets today.</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</h2> 
               <p itemprop="description">We've got tons of material on tap for organized play fans at this year's show. First, the known info: Season of the Runelords, our third season of the Adventure Card Guild, wraps up in August 2016, and avid players will be able to triumphantly complete the season in the Sagamore ballroom. You'll be able to play any or all of the scenarios in SotRu at the show, and we'll even keep a copy or two of Season of the Righteous and Season of the Shackles tucked away for folks who want to catch up or try some new adventures.</p> 
               <p>We'll also be debuting a mini-season, affectionately known in-house as WE BE CARD GOBLINS! This two-adventure "seasonlet" will take players through a PACG adaptation of the events of the Free RPG Day adventures <a href="/products/btpy8j5w"><em>We Be Goblins</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy8xc3"><em>We Be Goblins Too!</em></a>. Birds will be crunched, toads will be licked, and many, many things will be exploded. This mini-season will bridge the gap between Season of the Runelords and Season of the Mummy, which will launch in October when we release the <a href="/products/btpy9mbg"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a>. I didn't get the We Be Card Goblins event listing to Gen Con on time <i>(Bad Tanis!)</i>, so it's not listed in their event system—just buy a Season of the Runelords event ticket and we'll form parties on the fly. (This seems like a good time to mention that the <a href="/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> decks will be available for purchase at the show.)</p> 
               <p>To bury the lede, I should mention that our promo goblins, Ranzak, Ekkie, and Tup, will be PFACG-legal starting in August!</p> 
               <p>To further bury the lede, I am thrilled to elaborate on a little nugget that Pathfinder Society OPC Tonya Woldridge dropped in her <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lisd">blog yesterday</a>:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>This year's special, titled <a href="/products/btpy9mbe"><em>#8-00: The Cosmic Captive</em></a> and authored by Matt Duval, starts at 8:00 PM on Friday night. In past years, we ran 160 Roleplaying Guild tables, spanning levels 1 through 11. This year, we are keeping 160 Roleplaying Guild tables and adding 20 Adventure Card Guild tables. All 180 tables will work together to achieve common goals, and the actions of one effect the outcomes of others.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>You read that right: ACG and RPG tables working together to [redacted] [redacted] the [redacted]! I could not be more excited for this event. Working from Matt Duval's excellent adventure, the whole PFS team will be coming together to craft an exciting interactive for the whole PFS community. <em>The Cosmic Captive</em> will feature a mix of custom cards and cards from various base sets, and the deck will (eventually) be available for download or purchase if you want to run the event at your local convention.</p> 
               <h2>ACG Open 2: Son of ACG Open</h2> 
               <p>In case that wasn't enough <del>work for me</del> fun for you, we've also got a new Adventure Card Game Open in store. See if team <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhtk">"On the Dot"</a> can continue its reign, or maybe the upstart team "Don't Trust Tanis" will take them out! Or maybe YOUR team of four will be the victors! The ACG Open is a team vs. team advancement tournament played in 3 rounds. Quarterfinal matches will happen Thursday and Friday, the semifinal rounds on Saturday, and a final on Sunday. Last year's final was attended by most of the ACG design team and was quite exciting, and the winners each got a full Adventure Card Game Base Set, Character Add-On Deck, and Adventure Decks signed by the designers.</p> 
               <h2>But Wait! There's More!</h2> 
               <p>Even though Mummy's Mask won't be out until October, we will be running continuous MM demos at the Paizo booth during floor hours. Just show up, take a seat, and try not to get cursed too badly. And don't miss the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game seminar on Thursday at 2:00 PM—even <i>we</i> have no idea what secrets we might reveal!</p> 
               <p>Our friends at Obsidian will also be on hand to show off <a href="https://pathfinder.obsidian.net" target="_blank">Pathfinder Adventures</a>. I'm going to assume that if you're reading this blog and you have an iPad or an Android tablet, you're already playing this digital edition of the PACG, so all I need to tell you is that you'll have the opportunity to ask the Obsidian crew what's coming up next. You'll also want to check out the seminar "Pathfinder &amp; Obsidian" on Friday at 1:00 PM.</p> 
               <p>Come join us at Gen Con for the Best Four Days in Gaming!</p>

The multipart "Faithless and Forgotten" series will run in consecutive slots, so it will be possible to play the three parts (<a href="/products/btpy9huv"><em>#7-14: Let Bygones Be</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9hux"><em>#7-16: Lost Colony of Taldor</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9huz"><em>#8-18: The Infernal Inheritance</em></a>) in order. For each scenario, the Gen Con website shows a short descriptive blurb that appears in the program book and a longer blurb available online. The longer blurbs for the Season 8 adventures weren't available at the time of event submission, so I've included them here to give everyone a taste of Season 8 flavor. </p>

The Pathfinder Society's ally Zeeva Foxglove recently received a Harrow reading as repayment for her generosity, but a rare card appeared and portended imminent doom. Now that these terrible predictions are coming true, Zeeva realizes she cannot weather this storm alone.

                 <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 5-9.</p> 
                 <p>Two years ago, the Pathfinder Society concluded its extended campaign to find, reclaim, and explore the lost sky citadel Jormurdun. After ousting the vile demons and duergar within, the Society turned over control to their dwarven allies, who have defended the ancient fortress ever since. A recent raid by duergar slavers has captured some of Jormurdun's dwarves, who have disappeared into the Darklands and bound for the cruel capitol of Hagegraf. Only the Pathfinder Society is equipped and able to launch a daring rescue into the lightless depths, intercept the slaver convoy, and save these dwarves from a grisly fate.</p> 
                 <p>Content in "Captives of Toil" also contributes directly to the ongoing storyline of the Liberty's Edge faction.</p>

               <p>After much deliberation and because they have the potential to run long, we scheduled the new Seeker Arc, "All for Immortality" across the morning slots. We are offering Part 1 (<a href="/products/btpy9k93"><em>#7-20: First Taste of Eternity</em></a>) on both Thursday and Friday, Part 2 (<a href="/products/btpy9m01"><em>#7-26: All the Gods Beyond</em></a>) on Friday and Saturday, and Part 3 (<a href="/products/btpy9m02"><em>#7-29: Serpents Fall</em></a>) on Saturday and Sunday. This gives players the best chance to finish the arc at the event. The GMs for these tables are among the best, familiar with running in a convention setting and adjudicating high-level combat. While they have the potential to run long, we felt the opportunity to play through the arc with friends from other areas provided a benefit that couldn't be passed up. So prepare your team and come see if your character is worthy of the title "seeker".</p>

               <h2>Pregenerated Character Specials</h2> 
               <p>The popularity of <a href="/products/btpy9cu0"><em>#6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9cu6"><em>#6-99: True Dragons of Absalom</em></a> led us to plan two more scenarios with pregenerated characters. Thursday afternoon, we reprise some tables of <em>Serpents Rise</em> for those attendees who haven't experienced it yet. Thursday evening sees the Sagamore engaged in <a href="/products/btpy9lzy"><em>#7-98: Serpents' Ire</em></a>, a continuation of the Aspis Consortium storyline. On Saturday, we delve into Season 8 with <a href="/products/btpy9mbd"><em>#7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a>. Sunday morning sees repeats of both pregen specials, as well as For those Gen Con attendees unable to make Thursday or Saturday night, Sunday morning sees repeats of both new specials. <em>True Dragons of Absalom</em> is on offer several times throughout the convention.</p>

All 180 tables will work together to achieve common goals, and the actions of one effect the outcomes of others.</p>

                <b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-00: The Cosmic Captive</b>

                <div class="spoiler-text"> 
                 <p>Astronomers have marveled as the famous comet Aucturn's Tear once more soars through the solar system, yet this cycle, strange portals have begun opening on each planet the comet passes, and a powerful entity trapped on the other side of these gateways desperately calls for help. To the Pathfinder Society, this is a once-in-a-human-lifetime opportunity to discover what lies through these portals—and either free the captive trapped within or ensure that it remains sealed forever.</p> 
                </div>
               </div> 
               <p>Based on feedback concerning the number of tables available to players of each level, this year you may purchase tickets for a particular sub-tier. While this aids us in allocating GMs to the proper sub-tier, it presents a challenge to the player to ensure their character remains at the correct level. Be sure you purchase tickets for the level your character will be at the convention!</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Society Academy (PSA)</h2> 
               <p>Pathfinder Society Academy incorporates the Kid's Track adventures of previous years, as well as youth friendly tables of <em>The Confirmation</em>, <em>The Wounded Wisp</em> and <em>The Consortium Compact</em>. It provides a place for our younger GMs to hone their skills under the leadership of adult mentors. This year, we added <em>Kid's Track Transitions</em>, a new series of lessons and quests aimed at bridging the gap between the original Kid's Track lessons and full Roleplaying Guild play. When completed, the player receives a chronicle with enough experience, prestige, and gold to make a second level Pathfinder Society character.</p> 
               <h2>Demonstrations</h2> 
               <p>There will be quite a few demos going on! In the Exhibition Hall, Adventure Card Game demos of the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9mbg"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> will be held next to the Paizo Booth. In the Sagamore Ballroom, scheduled demos include <a href="/products/btpy9mb9"><em>Pathfinder Society Quest: Honor's Echo</em></a> for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the <a href="/products/btpy951a"><em>Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em></a> for the Adventure Card Game.</p> 
               <h2>Seminars</h2> 
               <p>We've planned a full complement of seminars, starting Thursday at 11:00 AM and continuing through Sunday at 2:00 PM. Some old favorites, like "Aunt Lisa's Story Hour", Mark Moreland's "Become a Pathfinder Sage", and the ever popular "Ask the Paizo GMs" are back, as well as new offerings. Join Ben Loomes to chat about using sound, especially Syrinscape, as mood enhancement at the table. Or see what's in store for the Pathfinder Comics line with "Pathfinder Comics: Hollow Mountain and Beyond". If you're interested in running a convention, visit us on Thursday at 6:00 PM to learn some of the tips of the trade. With a wide range of offerings, attendees are sure to find something to pique your interest.</p> 
               <p>All of these games utilize volunteers as GMs, as well as a full complement behind the scenes making things happen. To those that signed up, thank you. It wouldn't be possible to hold Gen Con without you! For those still thinking about it, I have a handful of Tier 1 GM positions available. For more information, check out the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie2">Gen Con 2016 Call for Volunteers</a> blog and follow the registration instructions found there.</p> 
               <p>Last, but not least, let me introduce to the Lead Volunteers for 2016! These individuals do it all—scheduling, volunteer organization, setup, tear down, and everything in between. This year brings back the Terrific Trio of Jon Cary, Bob Jonquet, and Todd Morgan. Tune in on Saturday to learn more about our stalwart leaders!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Up first is the simple-but-effective Celestial Lantern. This low-level lawful good spirit eagerly converses with and assists other goodly creatures, and can even be taken as a familiar or summoned by even low-level casters. Molded in clear plastic with a golden lattice, the Celestial Lantern keeps the light of good alive against the darkness. The Celestial Lantern is a Small, common figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160506-Hound.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160506-Hound_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Celestial Sentinels are disciplined watchers for good-aligned deities, often guarding specific places or individuals important to pure-hearted gods. Their ranks fill the celestial armies, where they are great enemies of evil fiends, showing them no mercy. At CR 4, they're also among the most commonly summoned allies for lower-level spellcasters, making them a nice addition to the ranks alongside Celestial Lanterns and the like. The Celestial Hound is a Medium, common figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160506-Trumpet.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160506-Trumpet_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>To round out our goodly trio we've got the Celestial Trumpeter, a messenger of good deities and the vanguard of divine armies. Their glorious trumpets transform into magic <i>+4 greatswords</i>, adding significant punch to a significant array of magic spells, justifying their CR 14 status. The Celestial Trumpeter is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for this week (though more celestials remain for future reveals)! I wish you all the best of weekends to come, and look forward to showing off another round of figures next week!</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain...</p>

                </div> 
                <p>In the nation of Geb, the dead far outnumber the living—and they hold the reins of political power. Most of Geb's living citizens are slaves, chattel, or most gruesomely, food for their undead overlords. Nyctessa was born into this world, yet she straddled both sides of class and society, being a dhampir—the child of a vampire and a living human mother. The heart of a living being beats in her chest, but her flesh is infused with the negative energy that animates the living dead, and she inherited her vampiric father's taste for blood. In the laws of Geb at least, Nyctessa was neither wholly alive nor truly dead.</p> 
                <p>Nyctessa's father was one of the Blood Lords, the undead necromancers who form the elite of Geb's aristocracy; her mother, a slave concubine in her father's harem. Throughout Nyctessa's childhood, both her father and mother were distant figures. She was nursed by loyal human slaves, raised by ghoul governesses, and educated by vampire tutors. She was allowed to see her mother only a few times a week, and her father even less. Nevertheless, Nyctessa always remained aware of being groomed to be her father's heir. Everyone expected her to follow in his footsteps, study necromancy, become a vampire, and eventually perhaps, centuries later, inherit his position in Gebbite society and government as one of the undying Blood Lords. She dutifully enrolled in Mechitar's prestigious Ebon Mausoleum, the same academy of necromancy her father had attended centuries earlier, and she excelled in all her studies.</p> 
                <p>When Nyctessa came of age, the time arrived when she would be presented to Mechitar society and join the social and political scene of Geb's capital city. Most of the young nobles making their debut that night were the newly made spawn of penanggalens, wraiths, vampires, and other undead, but some were the skittish, living offspring of the few mortal Blood Lords who still clung to life. Nyctessa was the only dhampir, and she could feel the mocking stares of her peers, judging her, pitying her even. Neither dead nor alive.</p> 
                <p>In the early morning, before the sun rose, Nyctessa's father presented her with a gift as the ball wound down: her mother. Nyctessa knew what he expected of her. They embraced and Nyctessa sank her teeth into her mother's neck. She greedily drank the blood, gorged herself on it, and felt a heady rush of power as her mother's drained, lifeless body sank to the floor. Her father watched in silence. Nyctessa had taken the first real step toward becoming his heir.</p> 
                <p>Nyctessa returned to the Ebon Mausoleum to finish her studies, but during that time, she could not help thinking of her mother's death at her own hands. It was expected. Morality didn't even enter into it. Nyctessa had been told over and over by her governesses and tutors that no life—or death—equaled her own. Her mother had been chattel, and Nyctessa the scion of a noble house. And her mother's blood had tasted good. Almost from the moment of her birth, Nyctessa had been trained for one role, one destiny. Her future was planned out to the tiniest detail. Only now, she questioned whether that would be enough.</p> 
                <p>At her graduation, Nyctessa's father presented another gift: a staff made from her mother's spine and skull with which to form her arcane bond. This was the last straw, the last nail in her proverbial coffin. The staff was a symbol of her father's power over her, over her future, and the rest of her existence. She could not just allow him to steal all of that possibility from her. She would not just be a pawn in his centuries-long strategies and political maneuverings.</p> 
                <p>Nyctessa left Mechitar that night, paying for passage on a ship to Jalmeray. She took her staff with her, but did not say goodbye to anyone. Before she would promise herself to death, she would see what life had to offer. Nyctessa journeyed to Jalmeray, Katapesh, Qadira, and beyond to Taldor, Andoran, and Cheliax. She left behind her family name, her father's name, and during these travels, she witnessed life itself. A grubby, hardscrabble existence, always grasping for more—more food, more money, more land, more meaning, only to see it all stolen away when death inevitably arrived. A meaningless exercise, and always far too brief.</p> 
                <p>Nyctessa chose to live, but only until she had triumphed over life completely. She would be one of the immortal, the eternal, the deathless, what mortals call the living dead—eventually. She would return home and claim her birthright, but on her own terms, through her own skills and abilities. She would not become a mindless automaton, a starving ghoul, a thirsting vampire, or even a rotting lich, but something different, something new, something uniquely Nyctessa. She would do whatever it took. She would let nothing stand in her way. Nyctessa would find the answer within herself and her magic, and she would forever bridge the divide between life and death.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Two years ago, the brave forces of Paizo took the field of battle, fighting off skilled foes sent by other game companies from around Seattle to claim the Gauntlet, a fabled prize of glory and power. When the dust settled, we were victorious. The Gauntlet was ours!</p> 
               <p>But such triumphs were not made to last...</p> 
               <p>Last year, we once again took the field, raising money for charity, fending off an even greater field of contenders. It was a day of hard fought battles and although we fought valiantly, we were defeated. The team from the Removed From Play podcast had cast us down into ruin. They took the Gauntlet from us.</p> 
               <p>Now, the time has come once again. We go to do battle in less that two weeks and we need your help to once again battle for the Gauntlet. You can help by <a href="http://thegauntlet2016.causevox.com/team/Paizo">donating to the Gauntlet charity in the name of Paizo</a> (or by selecting one of the individual team members). The more money we raise, the more "power ups" we will get during the event to help us win! A lot of the other teams have gotten a bit of a head start on us this year, but we are confident you will help to see us through. The team for this year has seen some changes as well, adding fresh blood to our stable of champions. While Erik Mona and I will be returning, we are happy to add Katina Davis (Customer Service Representative) and Jason Keely (Editor) to the Gauntlet team.</p> 
               <p>Go and, <a href="http://thegauntlet2016.causevox.com/team/Paizo">select a team member and donate today</a>! Every little bit helps and it all goes to support YouthCare, a great charity that helps homeless kids!</p> 
               <p>Last year, we promised a short dungeon adventure as a reward for helping us with the tournament and we have not forgotten about this commitment. Although our responsibilities at Paizo have delayed us, I am happy to announce that the adventure is currently going through editing and will be available for FREE in just a few weeks. Take a look at the awesome map for this exciting adventure!</p>

               <p><a href="/products/btpy9l37"><em>Inner Sea Intrigue</em></a> riffs seamlessly off of <a href="/products/btpy9j6p"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a> in that much of its content showcases these new rules as they affect and exist in Golarion. One of many examples is the specific archives presented. Using the research rules found on pages 148–153 of <a href="/products/btpy9j6p"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>, the book presents four places of research that feature prominently in the setting. They are Forae Logos, located in the Wise Quarter in Absalom; the Jeggare Museum, located in Korvosa in Varisia; the Magaambya, located in Nantambu in the Mwangi Expanse; and the Quarterfaux Archives, located in Caliphas in Ustalav.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>By making Research checks and reducing the archives’ knowledge points, players can discover many of the fascinating truths kept in these libraries. Many such discoveries are in-world details that pertain to the history of the archives’ locations, the magic that has thrived there, and other key elements. Some of the most difficult-to-unearth discoveries, though, are adventure seeds in and of themselves.</p> 
               <p>Take this gem, found in the depths of the Jeggare Museum, for example. </p>
               <blockquote>
                "A small island in Lake Skotha on the Storval Plateau is known as Chorak’s Tomb, and is rumored to be the home of an ancient weapon that belonged to a runelord rival of Karzoug. However, no one has been able to get close enough to verify this story, as all trespassers are driven away by bombardments of boulders and rune-covered ballista bolts."
               </blockquote> 
               <p></p> 
               <p>As with other "Inner Sea" hardcover tie-ins we’ve done in the past (including <a href="/products/btpy8mfs"><em>Inner Sea Magic</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy95b1"><em>Inner Sea Combat</em></a>), we also had the opportunity to present dozens of new character options, from new talents for investigators, rogues, and vigilantes, to new archetypes and prestige classes directly tied to the intriguing elements of the Inner Sea region. The prestige classes included are the Lion Blade of Taldor (updated from its 3.5 iteration) and the enchanting courtesan (inspired by the character Vreva Jhafae in the <a href="/pathfinder/tales">Pathfinder Tales</a> novel <a href="/products/btpy9aon">"Pirate’s Promise"</a>), while the new archetypes include the Anaphexia thought-killer, the bonded investigator (who gets a familiar to aid him in his research), the Nexian spell-spy, the tinkerer (who learns to craft a clockwork familiar that she can adapt to an increasing number of situations as she levels up), and many more!</p> 
               <p>Whether you’re a GM running a campaign with intriguing elements, or a player whose PC prides herself on her sneaky, duplicitous ways, there’s no better supplement to an Inner Sea campaign than <a href="/products/btpy9l37"><em>Inner Sea Intrigue</em></a>!</p>

                <br> <i>She really can attack the darkness.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>As you can see, Wrath Imrijka was about the monster vending, while Class Deck Imrijka is all about those ranged weapons. She fuels her engine by defeating monsters, sure, but she can also use her weapons for their powerful discard/bury effects without losing them to the discard pile. The last power on her character card is an adaptation of the RPG inquisitor's <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/advanced/baseClasses/inquisitor.html#judgment">judgement class feature</a>. It's initially usable only on combat at another location. Never has a bad first impression mattered so much.</p> 
               <p>I've chosen to preview her Fate's Shepherd role because it features an unusual way to cheat death. The final power allows Imrijka to drastically mitigate danger for characters whose decks are low on cards. With feat investment, she can even make the cost to herself minimal! Then, with the last feat on the first power, she can defeat an Undead monster to heal that cost right back into her deck.</p> 
               <p>The <a href="/products/btpy9gdq/"><em>Inquisitor Class Deck</em></a> deck also has a treat for <a href="/pathfinder/tales">Pathfinder Tales</a> fans: Salim Ghadafar, the protagonist of James Sutter's <a href="/products/btpy8oda"><em>Death's Heretic</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy94r3"><em>The Redemption Engine</em></a>, makes his PACG debut in this deck.</p>

                <br> <i>A mysterious weapon for a mysterious man.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Salim focuses on Finesse weapons, which are a staple of this deck. He's a reluctant servant of Pharasma, but he will call upon her power when he really needs it. As you can see from his sweet sword, we enjoyed playing with mechanics for signature weapons, and this one has a potent scaling bonus. His roles, Death's Heretic and Reluctant Priest, explore facets of his connections to swordplay and the Lady of Graves.</p> 
               <p>The third and final character in the <a href="/products/btpy9gdq/"><em>Inquisitor Class Deck</em></a> is an inquisitor of Shelyn, the goddess of love and beauty. After tossing around ideas about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?vqwCrlMb4vno" target="_blank">game show hosts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzPCfT80u3M" target="_blank">hotness judges</a>, I eventually came around to the idea of Sherlock Holmes for the lovelorn, and Varril was born.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-VarrilTokenFront.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-VarrilTokenFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-VarrilFront.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-VarrilFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-KnightOfTheRose.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-KnightOfTheRose_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Why, yes, Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch </i>were<i> reference art for this character. Can you tell?</i>
               </div> 
               <p>He's got the limited heals. He's got the power of Shelyn backing him up when he attempts a check. He's even got that looking-for-love explore-again power. (In case you can't tell, I have a bit of a thing for our boy Varril.)</p> 
               <p>His Knight of the Rose role is all about making people feel good about themselves. He doesn't like to be lonely, and he's eager to spread Shelyn's message when it's her turn on the blessings deck. Note that this inquisitor has no Melee or Ranged skill; he's a lover, not a fighter. <i>(I promised myself I wouldn't make that joke. Oh well.)</i> His other role, Incorruptible, is about rewarding devotion to faith.</p> 
               <p>The new cards in this deck run the gamut. New weapons, new spells, new allies, and even a new blessing. Here's a sampling.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-AllyingHandCrossbow.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-AllyingHandCrossbow_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-ShieldOfFaith.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-ShieldOfFaith_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-LadyOfGraves.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-LadyOfGraves_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>We tried to do a lot in this deck, as you can see from the font size. There's a fair bit of scaling on the new boons, which should be interesting in play. We certainly hope you enjoy the <a href="/products/btpy9gdq/"><em>Inquisitor Class Deck</em></a>, which you can still preorder this week!</p> 
               <p>Ooh, and the return of Recurring Art Thing:</p>

               <p>Today I'm traveling back to Seattle from Quad Cities, Iowa, where we just wrapped the inaugural Quad Cities Game Fest. The convention hosted board games, RPGs, card games, vendors, bingo, and kid's activities—and this isn't even the whole list! Pathfinder took up about a fifth of the space, with a full roster of Pathfinder Society games. I ran <a href="/products/btpy88sz"><em>Hands of the Muted God</em></a> twice this weekend, and the seats for these games were raffle prizes benefitting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund. I enjoyed GMing these tables, and while I don't often get to utilize my license to kill, but two more characters (and an animal companion) did briefly visit Pharasma's Boneyard. You can call me Bond, Tonya Bond. Thanks to Dave, Barrett, VC James Martin, and all fantastic new friends for a blockbuster weekend!</p> 
               <p>On the subject of fantastic people, several dedicated GMs reached their fifth star over the past few weeks. Please join me in congratulating the following for their achievement. Huzzah!</p>

               <p>Shifting gears, I have a few pieces of news on the topic of conventions. A few weeks ago, I unveiled a new Event Support Policy on the blog. It generated quite a bit of discussion, and I put a note in the comments that the team had read the commentary and was reassessing the program. I intended to post the revised policy today, but unfortunately technical difficulties while on the road meant I couldn't access my notes. I ask for your patience for just a bit longer while I return to Seattle, retrieve my notes, and pull the edges together. In the meantime, no convention is being denied support, whether it is in a retail location or not, the packages just vary according to location.</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liqc">In a previous blog</a>, John introduced the Pathfinder Society <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> events, including some one of a kind adventures, out of retirement scenarios, and panels. Last week, our Customer Service team posted the <a href="/paizocon/events">Event Schedulde</a>, and I urge everyone who is going to PaizoCon to take a look and sign up quickly with your lottery preferences. Don't procrastinate—lottery selections end on May 9th!</p> 
               <p>Official Pathfinder Society events in the Grand Ballroom are being run in the morning and evening slots at PaizoCon (with the exception of Saturday night, when we host the annual <a href="/products/btpy9jc3">PaizoCon Preview Banquet</a>. However, you may play in or run pickup games during the afternoon slots. Venture-Lieutenant Louis Manko-Levite has taken up the coordinator mantle for organizing afternoon games. If you'd like to run an afternoon PFS game, <a href="mailto:taenia4000@yahoo.com?Subject=PaizoCon%202016%20Afternoon%20Game">email Louis</a> with the scenario you'd like to run and desired slot (Friday, Saturday, or Sunday). These games will then be added to the overall PaizoCon schedule, and will have a reserved table in the Grand Ballroom. You may also opt to bring a physical sign-up sheet to PFS Headquarters, where we'll post your game onsite. For attendees looking to play in these games, you may sign up during Open Registration on the <a href="/paizocon/events">Event Schedule page</a> ahead of time, or stop by PFS Headquarters at the convention.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">Volunteers are what make our conventions go! At this time, I have a full schedule of volunteers for PaizoCon 2016. However, I see need a handful of volunteers for Gen Con 2016, specifically Roleplaying Guild, Pathfinder Society Academy: Kid's Track GMs, and I'm looking for volunteers willing to accept Tier 1, 5, or 6 status. I could also use a few people for my waitlist, in the event that there are cancellations between now and Gen Con. If you're interested, please read over the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie2">Gen Con 2016 Call for Volunteers</a> and follow the instructions found there.</p> 
               <p>During convention season, we get quite a few questions from PaizoCon and Gen Con volunteers regarding how and when they'll get scenarios they've volunteered to run. Our Community &amp; Digital Content Director, Chris Lambertz, has provided all that you need to know about that process below:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>If you've volunteered to run an existing scenario, they will be assigned to your account as scheduling information is confirmed. You will receive an email notifying you that these are available, and you will be able to download them from your My Downloads page immediately.</p> 
                <p>If you've volunteered to run a special or yet-to-be-released scenario, they will be benchmarked as assigned to your account as scheduling information is confirmed. An email is automatically generated from our system that these have been added to your account at this stage. However, your My Downloads page may indicate that these are not immediately available for download, but don't panic! Once the Pathfinder Society team completes these scenarios, and they are uploaded to our system, an update email will be sent to all volunteers indicating that they are now downloadable. If for any reason you have not received a second email, be sure to double check your My Downloads page <i>before</i> posting, or emailing Tonya or Customer Service.</p> 
                <p>If you are a volunteer for PaizoCon or Gen Con, and you have not received your downloads for scenarios you are scheduled to run by the <b>week prior</b> to the convention you're volunteering at, please email <a href="mailto:customer.service@paizo.com">customer.service@paizo.com</a> and CC tonya.woldridge@paizo.com.</p>
