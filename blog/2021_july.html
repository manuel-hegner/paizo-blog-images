               </div> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description"><em>“Give it your allsix. Give it your allsix.</em>” The chipper voice sang out in the spacious green and yellow interior cockpit of the Veskarium Vanquisher mech. The sound of responding digital displays and humming power fields harmonized with the cheerful voice.</p> 
                <p><em>“Time to face the morning and make some nufriends!</em>” A second, equally energetic voice joined in to complete the ditty and punctuated the song’s end with a series of additional digital keystrokes on floating vidscreens.</p> 
                <p>Sarotska watched with interest as the data appeared in front of her. The holographic light shined off her bright red scales, giving her a momentary violet complexion as she took in the display. Swiping the holographic data away with her claw, the vesk commander of the mech briefly closed her eyes.</p> 
                <p>“Quiet on deck. Bunkle, ready the plasma rifles. Jiji, I want to make sure the weapons core is ready to swap our output over at a moment’s notice.” Sarotska spoke the commands as her eyes re-opened and fixed on the alien landscape now visible through the small view slit that was only accessible from her position in the mech’s chest cavity cockpit.</p> 
                <p>The stone forests of Elytrio’s southern hemisphere were some of the most unnerving terrains that Sarotska had seen in her long time with Obsidian Spiders mercenary company. She’d battled the Azlanti Star Empire, the Swarm, and at least a half-dozen different types of outsiders who’d breached the Material Plane for one reason or another. She’d taken part in the second Scoured Stars invasion and inserted onto jungles where colossi walked like modern gods. Still, Elytrio had a feel completely unlike that of any world she’d walked on. It was a planet that appeared dead, yet wasn’t entirely done with the world of the living.</p> 
                <p>“Sorry about the singing, boss. It’s just, this place doesn’t seem right, ‘gree?” The statement and question came from Bunkle, one of two other operators onboard the mech with Sarotska. The electric blue skittermander turned around and looked up to Sarotska’s elevated position in the cockpit, his six arms continuing to manipulate controls around him as he scrunched his face.</p> 
                <p>“Yeah boss. I thought this place was supposed to be an irradiated wasteland, but there’s no sign of radiation. It’s just a bunch of weird, petrified trees.” The follow-up came from the other skittermander crewmember, the cherry-red Jiji, who kept her eyes forward, looking out from sensors and moving the mech’s twin plasma rifles at the smallest disturbance in the terrain.</p> 
                <p>Sarotska waved a dismissive claw while peering out the viewscreen. “Look. We’re here to find some missing Starfinders. Or, at the very least, their bodies. The Society paid for us because their team that went missing was pretty capable and it’s likely whatever took them down ambushed them in this area. So yes, I think something isn’t right here, but I think the only way we’re going to figure it out is if you keep you eyes on your screens, Bunkle.”</p> 
                <p>The blue skittermander crunched his face in a sour expression and stuck out his tongue before swiveling around to stare back at the mountain of data feeds that accumulated in front of him. Jiji chuckled from her position, though her wide eyes never left the constant flow of data.</p> 
                <p>“Got something, boss! Looks like a signal up ahead behind those rocks.” Jiji chirped from her station. The data quickly moved up to Sarotska’s station with a visual swish as it loaded onto her console.</p> 
                <p>“Hmmm...” Sarotska mused as she took in the data. “It looks like a blip of radiation from behind the rocks. Could be some leftover irradiated debris. Probably something the Starfinders would have investigated on their mission here.</p> 
                <p>“Bunkle, I’m going to move us closer. Keep the plasma rifles ready, just in case.” The commands emerged from Sarotska’s mouth, but she’d already put the mech in motion. One plodding step after another, the Vanquisher continued moving on its path. The roughly humanoid bulk of it crushed the cracked gray terrain around it, as the bulky chassis of the Vanquisher navigated through trees and debris.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The Vanquisher mech was something of an oddity of Veskarium-crafted mechs. It lacked the armor upgrades common on mechs like the Ripclaw or Warmander, and instead had been designed by Veskarium engineers for maximum destructive ranged combat. A Vanquisher boasted a pair of heavy plasma rifles, capable of devastating the land around it for a hundred feet. To mount such brazen weapons on its hull, the Vanquisher not only sacrificed heavy Veskarium armor, but it also lacked any sort of dedicated melee weapon beyond its ponderous legs.</p> 
                <p>“I’m getting something, boss... more radiation. It looks like... OH NO!” Jiji updated just in time for the crew to spot two things in their sensor displays.</p> 
                <p>The first was a gruesome cluster of bodies. Six skeletal figures, each with radically different equipment, were scattered at the base of the rock. The emblem of the Starfinder Society caught in a slight updraft off the tattered backpack of one of the unfortunate souls, letting the crew of the Vanquisher know that they’d found their targets.</p> 
                <p>The second sight was a sudden movement in the rocks. In an instant, the top rock seemed to ripple in the breeze, and then a moment later, it spouted thousands of cracks. As the crew tried to comprehend what they were seeing, the cracked rock burst into thousands of tiny forms that formed a swarming cloud.</p> 
                <p>“Jiji! What are we looking at here?” Sarotska demanded as she backed the Vanquisher off from the agitated lifeforms.</p> 
                <p>“High radiation, boss. Looks like it’s a colony of insects that fed off the radiation. Their wings are some kind of shielding material, so that’s why we couldn’t scan them earlier.” Jiji blathered as she scanned streams of incoming data and manipulated the information with her arms, sending necessary data to both Sarotska and Bunkle.</p> 
                <p>Outside the Vanquisher, the swarm continued to grow as more of the nearby “rocks” sluffed away to unleash droning insects that joined their kin in a growing ball. Instinctively reacting to the mounting threat, Sarotska moved the Vanquisher back several paces, with each step causing the swarm to reflexively discorporate or extend in random directions. Then, an instant after the mech came to a plodding stop, the swarm engulfed the mech and alert sirens blared.</p> 
                <p>“Radiation increasing! The outer shields have burst. The outer hull is melting!” Jiji continued to deliver verbal updates, despite the information displays Sarotska had in front of her to confirm the damage.</p> 
                <p>“Bunkle, I think it’s time that we give our new <em>friends</em> a show of force.” Sarotska put distinct emphasis on the word “friends,” employing the tonal meanings of the Vesk language to let her crewmember know that these insects were to be immediately recognized as hostiles and targeted immediately.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>A moment later, two beams of bright white and blue plasma streamed out from the twin rifles mounted on the Vanquisher’s upper limbs. The swarm danced around the beams, and while some of the insects fell into electrified husks, others in the swarm seemed to bloat and expand off some of the energy weapons fire that poured into them.</p> 
                <p>“Looks like they’re eating most of the plasma, boss. It’s just like how they eat radiation here.” Jiji reported as the cockpit shook with another violent impact from the swarm. “Outer hull integrity is down fifty percent. Ammo reserve number one is jammed!”</p> 
                <p>Sarotska took a moment. She closed her eyes again, and breathed as time slowed around her. She assimilated the verbal updates from Jiji, the scores of tactical data that flooded her vision, and then saw the swarm through the viewport in her station. </p> 
                <p>With a flash of white teeth, Sarotska opened her eyes and she fell back into the moment.</p> 
                <p>“Jiji, shift the weapons core energy to siphon high-frequencies into the rifles. Override the fire mixture since they’re feeding on that. Bunkle, get ready to make the next two shots count.” As the commands issued from her, Sarotska took control of the Vanquisher’s movement systems and siphoned from the power core to initiate a stomping trample maneuver—the only reliable melee option available to the mech. The stomping behemoth moved through the swarm, which parted at its sudden burst of speed.</p> 
                <p>Shifting on its ponderous legs, the Vanquisher made a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn as Sarotska steadied the moving mech with manual controls from her station. Jiji continued adjusting screens as she desperately sent energy streaming from the rear-mounted weapon core into the twin plasma rifles. Finally, Bunkle rested his upper arms behind his head, while his remaining two sets of arms both went to work lining up shots through the Vanquisher’s autotargeting system.</p> 
                <p>“Guess today’s not the day for nufriends, ‘gree?”</p> 
                <p>A stream of electrified air blasted out from the rifle arms, momentarily deafening the cockpit’s occupants. Instead of the fiery plasma that previously emerged, waves of sonic resonance accented by arcs of lighting flew out in a straight line toward the swarm of insects. The twin lines pulverized the swarm together, where arcs of electricity shot between the insects, baking their bodies to dust in an instant.</p> 
                <p>“We did it!” Jiji shouted, leaping atop her piloting chair.</p> 
                <p>“Was there ever a doubt?” Bunkle followed-up, cracking the fingers of his lower arms while his upper arms continued to support the back of his head.</p> 
                <p>Sarotska’s smile vanished as stillness overcame the former battlefield. Nothing remained of the targets.</p> 
                <p>“Bunkle.” the vesk pilot began, her tone immediately conveying a mounting sense of anger and worry.</p> 
                <p>“You didn’t hit those Starfinders’ remains, did you?”</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Since the launch of Pathfinder Second Edition, we’ve released a number of adventures set in the Mwangi Expanse. The upcoming Strength of Thousands Adventure Path might be one of the most anticipated, but we've also explored the Expanse in <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ageOfAshes">Age of Ashes</a>, the standalone adventure <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering"><em>The Slithering</em></a>, and multiple Pathfinder Society scenarios. Such a vast and beautiful locale invariably invites exploration beyond what has already been presented, however, and there's no better resource for that than <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026i4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Since the launch of Pathfinder Second Edition, we’ve released a number of adventures set in the Mwangi Expanse. The upcoming Strength of Thousands Adventure Path might be one of the most anticipated, but we've also explored the Expanse in <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ageOfAshes">Age of Ashes</a>, the standalone adventure <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering"><em>The Slithering</em></a>, and multiple Pathfinder Society scenarios. Such a vast and beautiful locale invariably invites exploration beyond what has already been presented, however, and there's no better resource for that than <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026i4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/62cb1e0c-cc3f-4799-9f30-a155b4acc0a6/073021_AnadiHunter.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/62cb1e0c-cc3f-4799-9f30-a155b4acc0a6/073021_AnadiHunter.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="An anadi in human-spider hybrid form waves at the viewer, looking oddly cute despite his arachnid features."></a>

                <h3>Spidery Friends</h3> 
                <p>Ever since the anadi shyly tiptoed their way into Pathfinder near the end of First Edition, our fans have been split between those who love anadis and arachnophobes (sorry about that). An anadi named Renali showed up in the first book of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path, and she could even accompany the heroes of that adventure as they fought off a group of hostile invaders in the town of Breachill and beyond. With the release of <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em>, anadis are now a playable ancestry—GMs can take cues from these rules to give Renali new abilities to help the PCs overcome their challenges, or even allow a player to use Renali as a PC!</p> 
                <h3>Slithering Spoilers Ahead!</h3> 
                <p>If you're still waiting to experience the events of <em>The Slithering</em> unspoiled, then shoo! Get out of here! But if you're a GM seeking to build on the framework the adventure provides you, consider checking out <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em> as you begin your preparations. Not only does the book contain more information on Kibwe, where the events of <em>The Slithering</em> take place, it also provides information on the surrounding area, the people who live in the city, and recent events that the locals might still be talking about—aside from the terrible ooze curse, of course! Would the sudden influx of charau-ka refugees from Usaro cause your PCs to raise an eyebrow? Could a visiting Alijae elf from the White City of Nagisa have some helpful information to offer? Has a relative or friend had a narrow escape from someone looking to cash in on the rumored Aspis bounties for kobolds?</p> 
                <p><em>The Slithering</em> sees PCs venture into the city of Holy Xatramba to face down a group of demonic cultists. But <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em> unveils another resident of that city—the green dragon Olohimba, who considers the ruins her domain. Though thoroughly evil and happy to dine on any intruders to her realm, she considers herself an orthodox follower of Pharasma (and since she isn't a cleric, Pharasma's ban on neutral evil clerics and champions can't convince her otherwise!) Olohimba considers it her duty to the Lady of Graves to cleanse Holy Xatramba of demons, and she could be swayed to help the PCs in their predicament. Is negotiating with a dangerous and powerful draconic patron worth the risks? Or would the PCs prefer to take their chances with the demons?</p>

                <h3>College Prep</h3> 
                <p>If you and your group are planning to play in the upcoming Strength of Thousands adventure path, be sure to pack <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em> in with your textbooks! Beyond offering a basic history of Old-Mage Jatembe, his Ten Magic Warriors, and the founding of the Magaambya, the book also takes a close look at the city of Nantambu, where the Adventure Path is set. The book outlines all the hottest spots for students looking to spend their free time, from the Black Crowned Crane restaurant to the best shops serving alcoholic “Jatembe Juice.” Unless, of course, you'd rather spend your nights in your dorm room all alone. Even the antisocial can find useful material, however: the ancestry rules for some of the Mwangi Expanse's shiest people, from the secretive shisks to the paranoid golomas. Whether you're a party animal or a studious scholar, <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em> is the book for you!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Marcus was miserable.</p> 
                <p><em>Sign up for border forces</em>, his father said. <em>See the world. Lend your strength and inner fire to Cheliax. Your brother and sisters could use a role model. Your mother could use any surplus income.</em></p> 
                <p>Clearly dad had never served.</p> 
                <p>The journey past the Menador Mountains was challenging; Marcus had never left the Chelaxian border before, and the transition the landscape made as they neared the Uskwood was unsettling. The sun seemed to shine brighter back home; the colors were brilliant, the daylight sparkled, and even the nighttime was made merrier by the vivid oranges and reds of torchlight and campfire.</p> 
                <p>Everything here was muted. Smothered. Silent. As though even the crickets were afraid to call, the birds too cautious to sing. The trees here were different, too; gnarled, angular things whose branches inexplicably still bore fresh leaves. He’d never seen new foliage look so drab, like it was painful to even grow.</p> 
                <p>This entire place was shadow and silence; even the campfire they’d made struggled against the oncoming darkness, and the crackle of burning wood shouted their presence. Marcus huddled closer and gave his companion a long-suffering look over the flames. </p> 
                <p>If Calerio was bothered by the strange solitude of Nidal’s environs, he didn’t show it. The man’s face was calm, his hand steady as it stoked the fire to further life. He took another look around the small campsite, his dark eyes studying every nearby tree and bush before settling again on his companion. Only then did the man’s eyes soften a little, and the wisp of a smile tug at his mouth.</p> 
                <p>“We won’t be here long,” Calerio reassured him. In the silence, even his soft baritone seemed to boom.</p> 
                <p>“Good,” Marcus grumbled. “I’d much prefer mountain-diving to this.” </p> 
                <p>His companion chuckled, and all too soon, the uncomfortable silence pressed in. It needed to be chased off; grasping for a topic, Marcus asked, “So, uh, you been here before?”</p> 
                <p>Calerio chuckled softly. “A long time ago. Years. And never this close to the Uskwood. Even back in my old caravan days, we never went through the Uskwood. The locals don’t like to be disturbed.”</p> 
                <p>“Yet here we are,” Marcus sighed.</p> 
                <p>“Here we are,” Calerio agreed. “But these are the orders.”</p> 
                <p>The younger of the two sighed and returned his eyes to the fire. Behind him, the sun’s last rays finally sank below the horizon line, and night settled in, as though it always belonged there. Nighttime should not feel so heavy, and yet it threatened to smother the Chelish soldier. Marcus’s hand kept close to his scimitar, his stomach tightening in anticipation. By now, the small campfire bellowed in the deadened silence, angry and intrusive. </p> 
                <p>“Won’t be long now,” breathed Calerio.</p> 
                <p>And it wasn’t.</p> 
                <p>“<b>Blasphemers!</b>” The voice boomed, setting both men instantly to their feet. “You shall pay the price for your intrusion!”</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Ian Perks from <em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em></p>
                </div> 
                <p>The attack came from nowhere. The shadow of the closest tree grew longer for but a heartbeat, and then two figures leapt from the dark canopy – one black as night, the other shiningly pale in comparison. Marcus barely had time to raise his shield before the dark creature was upon him; the sudden weight threatened to take his feet out from under him. He braced himself against it, shoved and was rewarded with the scrape of tooth on metal and wood. His sword arm burned, though, from the swipe of a horrid claw.</p> 
                <p>“Wait!” he heard Calerio call. “We mean no harm!” A quick glance to the side showed his companion facing off with a slender elf dressed in leather armor. Wisps of shadow curled in stark contrast to the elf’s albino skin as he clutched a horrible-looking effigy made of bark, blood, and bone.</p> 
                <p>The call came too late; as Marcus watched, the shadows stretched up and over the pale elf’s hand, convalescing at his fingers and shooting forward. The darkness <em>screamed</em> as it barreled into them, a horrible, high-pitched monstrosity of sound that ripped through both men. For a moment, Marcus couldn’t see, couldn’t hear, and was barely aware of the hot, fresh blood that gushed from his nose, tickled over his chin, and dripped from his beard.</p> 
                <p>He shook his head to clear it, noting in his peripheral vision that Calerio had been affected by the <em>Shadow Blast</em> as well, but was already recovering and leveling his shield and trident at the elf. Marcus refocused on his adversary, and a momentary panic gripped him as he realized he’d lost sight of the beast. </p> 
                <p>Then, there it was again, glowing green eyes across the fire, snarling at man and flame as though both were equal enemies. The fire brought definition to the strange, smoky animal. It moved like a hound, snarled like one, and had the bulk and weight of any trained dog, but its very being seemed to waver and meld with the shadows around it.</p> 
                <p>If it wasn’t about to lunge again, Marcus might have wanted to ask questions. As it was, his arm was ready; he would meet this next lunge with a slice the creature would not soon forget. </p> 
                <p>Fortunately, it never came. With a cry, Calerio rammed into the elf, yelling “In the name of our Master Zon-Kuthon, I bid you hold!”</p> 
                <p>Wait… “<em>our</em>?”</p> 
                <p>At the very least, it gave Calerio the moment he’d wanted. The albino elf twitched a finger, and the strange shadow-hound backed away from Marcus, though kept its otherworldly eyes set on the man. Wide-eyed and keeping his shield raised, the younger human kept alert, breathing rapidly and spitting away the coppery-tasting blood that trailed over his mouth. He took a step toward his companion.</p> 
                <p>“You cannot claim to venerate our Midnight Lord and still violate our earth with that filth,” the elf spat, casting a revolted look towards the campfire. </p> 
                <p>Calerio considered his words a moment before speaking quietly. “Marcus, extinguish the fire.”</p> 
                <p>Marcus wanted nothing more than to question that order, but knew better, especially here and now. He carefully set about the task – tricky, when he wanted to keep his eyes on the adversaries. As he worked, he heard Calerio continue. “It was the fastest way we knew to summon one of the Shadowed faith, and our need is great.”</p> 
                <p>“Your needs are unimportant to us, little shadeling,” sneered the elf. “There is a price to pay for calling on us.”</p> 
                <p>“It is a price I agree to pay,” intoned Calerio, sheathing his sword. “Cheliax and Nidal have been allies for years. Our flames rise and give you taller shadows. And now, Cheliax needs the expertise of your sect.”</p> 
                <p>“Why should the druids of Uskwood care about what is happening in the bright lands?” scoffed the elf. Another twitch of his fingers, and the shadow-hound approached, obediently sitting at the elf’s feet.</p> 
                <p>The last, bright wisp of fire died, leaving only wood smoke and darkness behind. The green glow of the shadow hound’s eyes seemed all the brighter without the intrusive campfire. Even now, the pale skin of the elf was easily seen; he made no attempt to hide himself, and why should he? </p> 
                <p>“Because there are mysteries there whose unraveling might be of utmost interest to the Midnight Lord – and both of our courts,” Calerio answered softly.</p> 
                <p>The elf sighed. “Continue.”</p> 
                <p>Marcus breathed. Calerio’s orders had seemed crazy, but they worked.</p> 
                <p>“Recently we discovered a hollowed-out section of rock in the Menador Mountains. We thought it was just an unfortunate experiment gone wrong, or perhaps an old, weakened series of tunnels finally giving in to time, but once the debris was cleared, we discovered a strange item. A huge, porous stone, different from the stone of the mountain, twisting up into a point, like a giant stalagmite. It should have been crushed with all the other debris, but it looked…almost fresh. And it seemed to be…weeping.”</p> 
                <p>The druid stayed silent, arching pale eyebrows as he considered Calerio’s words.</p> 
                <p>“There was no place where the stone would have allowed water flow, and there’s no water source nearby, but we have seen it with our own eyes, and I swear it is weeping. Your sect specializes in the shadows and understand the natural order of things far more than we could. This thing seems to thrive in the shadows of what used to be sturdy rock. What’s more, if this weeping is magical or spiritual in nature, then none know more about suffering than the Uskwood druids.” Calerio paused, swallowed thickly, and then finished, “This discovery could be a godsend to both your masters and mine. I will pay any price you or your sect decree, in honor of our Midnight Lord. Will you help us?”</p> 
                <p>Marcus watched as the albino’s head canted to one side, as though listening to the shadows themselves. After a long stretch of silence, he nodded once. Calerio seemed relieved and seemed to breathe a little easier. “Thank you.”</p> 
                <p>“Do not thank me just yet,” came the elf’s scornful voice. “We may be traveling companions for now, but Zon-Kuthon will get his due, and you will be made to pay for each slight against him.” The elf’s long, white hair shone, waterlike, as he nodded towards the extinguished fire. His pink eyes lifted and rested on Marcus, then. “You both will.” The shadow-hound licked his chops at <em>Marcus</em>.</p> 
                <p>Marcus felt his stomach sink. Suddenly, he wasn’t so relieved for the mission’s success. He’d have many questions for Calerio, once they were alone – if they ever would be, again.</p> 
                <p>They wouldn’t.</p>

                <p>If you are new to Pathfinder or an Adventure Path, welcome! The <em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path Player's Guide</em> is your spoiler-free introduction for getting started with this six-part adventure. Inside you will find the following background and rules for the campaign:</p> 
                <p><b>The History</b>: The Magaambya was founded thousands of years ago by the greatest wizard the world has ever known. Follow the legacy left by Old-Mage Jatembe and his Ten Magic Warriors. Learn of the ranks within the school and the branches of knowledge students can follow. Every student stands tall upon the strength of thousands who have come before them in the ancient academy!</p> 
                <p><b>Coming Together</b>: The Strength of Thousands Adventure Path begins as the heroes arrive at the Magaambya, their home throughout their adventures. Although the heroes must remain close to the Magaambya to learn their initial lessons, they’ll soon gain greater responsibilities and venture across the Mwangi Expanse—and beyond! Incoming students are grouped together in a cohort to support and learn from each other throughout their education. Rather than a typical adventuring party, the heroes of the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path are a cohort of diverse and dedicated students.</p> 
                <p><b>Spellcasting for Everyone</b>: Even though any character class works well in the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path, a campaign where students attend a magic school wouldn’t seem very magical unless all the heroes can cast spells! The player’s guide contain rules that let characters who can’t cast spells (like fighters or rogues) dabble in a bit of magic. Heroes who can already cast spells get even more to expand their repertoire.</p> 
                <p>The <em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path Player’s Guide</em> is written by Ron Lundeen. The cover artist is Setiawan Lee.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Howdy, everybody. Paizo Publisher Erik Mona here. I wanted to stop by the blog today to talk about some upcoming changes to our Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society scenario offerings in the months ahead. Because I spent many years as an active organized play player and GM before my publishing career and often tried to read the tea leaves behind changes just like these, I want to go over the changes carefully to make sure that no one draws the wrong conclusions.</p> 
                <p>Over the last year, our organized play and editorial teams have taken a very close look at our department’s production cycle, reported player data about how often our scenarios are used, sales of individual scenarios, player feedback, and other information to get a better sense of how we can best focus our editorial efforts. We identified two key data points. One, the organized play team produces over 700,000 words of playable content every year! Two, an adventure does not need to have the Society logos to work well in the Society environment. With this information in mind, we’ve come to some decisions about the path ahead that we’d like to share with you. </p> 
                <p>Moving forward, we plan to slightly reduce the number of standard scenarios released for both campaigns. Pathfinder Society will release 3 new scenarios for the season launch in August and the standard 2 new scenarios in September, November, and December. In October, we will release 1 new scenario.</p> 
                <p>For Starfinder Society, we will produce the standard 2 new scenarios per month in August and October, but will release only 1 new scenario in September, November, and December. </p> 
                <p>Overall, we will see a similar pattern in 2022, with slightly fewer scenarios for both campaigns (but at least 1 new scenario a month for both campaigns, and more than that more often than not). To help our community keep up to date, we will add a section to our monthly update blogs with the upcoming production schedule.</p> 
                <p>Adjusting the number of scenarios doesn’t mean a huge reduction in overall Society playable content, as it allows us capacity to bring the popular Bounties program of self-contained shorter adventures to the Starfinder Society campaign starting in January of 2022, with six new Starfinder Bounties introduced over the course of next year, as well as publish new four Pathfinder Bounties for level 3 characters over the same period. </p> 
                <p>Additionally, we are focused on having sanctioning ready at release for our popular new One Shot single-session characters-provided adventures for Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society play, with a half-dozen One Shots scheduled throughout 2022. Bounties and One Shots provide a different play experience than a standard campaign scenario. They are an important way to bring new players into the game systems and provide a great springboard into the organized play community.</p> 
                <p>What’s it all mean in the big picture? Is Organized Play in trouble? Are Pathfinder and Starfinder failing? </p> 
                <p>No. It’s none of that. Both campaigns are doing great and are an important part of Paizo’s present and future. These changes are an attempt to better balance the breakneck pace of our in-house editorial operation to improve quality overall, and to diversify our adventure offerings to provide a wider variety of play experiences, ideally with an eye toward adding more people to the player networks for both games. The more people playing Pathfinder and Starfinder, the cooler stuff we can do to support both games. </p> 
                <p>We are committed to providing the best, most fun, most inviting and most inclusive organized play environment that we can. From time to time, that’s going to mean shaking up the plan a little bit and adapting to new opportunities. Rather than signs of trouble, these are in fact signs of health, and represent efforts to grow and nurture what we have all created together for these fantastic campaigns. </p> 
                <p>For an exciting look at some of the upcoming plans for Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society, check out our landing pages for the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderSociety">Year of the Data Scourge</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shp9?Pathfinder-Society-Year-3-Announcement">Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a> seasons!</p> 
                <p>Until next time, may all your successes be critical!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Twice have I been born, and with each birthing, I have gained a lifelong companion. The first companion was pain, learned the moment I was freed from my mother’s womb to the sight of my “father” standing over me with a drawn blade. Lord Bhrostra introduced me to my companion daily for years, finding new excuses to beat me and new ways to remind me that I was a blight on his house. Pain surrounded me in its warm embrace when my true sire, the elf Lairsaph, shattered my knee and left me broken, a gift to the men who hunted him so that he could escape while I paid the price for his crimes. That pain made me strong, tempered me against hardship, and set my foot on the path toward my second companion: the whispers.</p> 
                <p>Trapped in a dungeon for half a decade, tortured for the crimes of my sire, the whispers comforted me. They etched arcane runes in the hallways of my mind, told me the names of beings who could impart strength beyond anything I had dreamed of, and carved maps to ancient sites rife with power just waiting to be claimed. They’ve steered me toward ever-greater power since the moment of my emancipation: a scroll here, a spellbook there, a magic blade in the hands of an unworthy warrior. Each treasure a step closer to my destiny, each foe a whetstone sharpening me for the next task.</p> 
                <p>The whispers that brought me here, to this barren wasteland of bloodstained stone between the orcish hold of Belkzen and the so-called Gravelands ruled by hungry undead. They told me that there once was a mighty black dragon named Sharzathinek who served the Whispering Tyrant and that her lair was packed with spellbooks and magical trinkets. Such treasures came from a time before the Tyrant’s mortal life, ancient magic from an era when today’s archmages would have been seen as scarcely more than street magicians. The whispers also told me that Sharzathinek was, quite conveniently, dead, slain in a battle far from her lair. Hidden in such an inhospitable place as this, perhaps the lair and its treasures have gone unnoticed, waiting to be found once more by their rightful inheritor.</p> 
                <center>
                 <hr width="50%">
                </center> 
                <p>The lair should be close now. I had to put my horse down several miles back when its hoof caught in a rocky crevice and its leg shattered. Perhaps I could have set the bone and poured a healing potion down the beast’s throat, but I have used up most of the supplies it was intended to carry, and I would prefer to keep my precious healing resources for a true emergency. The horse screamed something fierce before I ended its misery, and while the dragon whose trove I’m searching for is supposedly long dead, some other deadly creature undoubtedly hunts in these lands. Not even the orcs wander into this desolation, but something tore apart a band of ghouls just a few miles back. Something with claws, teeth, and… acid. </p> 
                <center>
                 <hr width="50%">
                </center> 
                <p>The whispers surge in my mind, reassuring me that Sharzathinek is long dead. I needed not the reassurance; a dragon as old as that one wouldn’t merely have torn the ghouls apart, its claws would have scored the stone, and its breath would have melted rock into toxic vapor. I suspect that Sharzathinek left behind a clutch of eggs or wyrmling spawn, a lesser dragon that has likely claimed its mother’s horde. I don’t fear such a lesser creature, though I’m not so foolish as to risk encountering it unprepared. </p> 
                <p>I hear the faintest beating of wings far above me in the storm-wracked sky, and I use a scroll of protective magic to ward my body and equipment against acid. My blade leaps to hand with a thought and with it an array of powerful spells. No simple sword, my blade is fused with a powerful staff whose combat spells augment my specialized array of magic.</p> 
                <p>With my body warded and weapon in hand, I scan the skies. Was that a flicker of a bat-like wing, large enough to hold a draft horse aloft? Or had my nerves simply fooled my senses? The whispers assure me it was no illusion, so I do the only thing that makes sense. I scream into the darkened skies, “Come then, beast! Come and face your better, wyrm! I have more important tasks than wasting time with you here in this gods-forsaken corner of nowhere!”</p> 
                <p>The taunt works. I hear the faint beating in the distance become a deafening hiss, like the linen sail of a great ship tearing under the force of a hurricane. Foolish creature, too consumed by its own arrogant superiority to mask its approach. As it swoops towards me, for just a moment I feel the heavy dread of dragon-fear attempting to cloud my mind, but I brush it aside. I unleash a blast of lightning from my blade, wreathing its body in crackling arcs of electricity. I hold on to that power, grasping a fraction of its potential to wreath my blade in lingering electricity. The beast spews acid as it unleashes its deadly breath, but I sidestep the worst of the blast. The few droplets that reach me fizzle and fume before being extinguished entirely by my protective wards.</p> 
                <p>As the creature’s momentum carries it past me, I step through space itself, appearing at its flank and driving my lightning-sheathed sword into its flank. It roars as the blade parts its scales and jolts of electric energy sear the exposed muscle and nerves beneath, but I’m not done yet. Stepping into the blow, I drive the blade further even as I unleash another blast of lightning. I can feel the electricity pulling my blade deeper as the monster’s body spasms uncontrollably, and I know that I have dealt it a mortal blow. Then its tail slaps me across the side of my head, sending my body twisting and tumbling.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>I woke up a few hours later with a splitting headache, my hair matted to my scalp with blood. The dragon’s body lay nearby… Headless? I may be skilled and deadly but surely my spell wasn’t that devastating. Crawling, and then walking as I regained my equilibrium, I moved next to the dragon. As I inched closer, I noticed that its head had broken through a thin layer of dirt and shale into a cavern beneath. In the darkness below, I saw the glitter of gold and gems as well as the occasional reflective silver of weapons and armor when a line of lightning cut through the sky above. Good thing I brought some rope.</p>

                <p>I apologize for that, Starfinders. With Guidance still shut-down, it’s tricky to get intel to all of you agents out in the field. Don’t worry, though—tech issues won’t stop us from exploring the stars! I’ve pulled the available information about your next two available missions. Be careful out there, Starfinders!</p> 
                <p>Author Rigby Bendele takes the Society to Verces, where Celita hopes to recruit an infamous hacktivist to help solve the Data Scourge digital attacks. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ro?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-404-Mission-Not-Found"><em>Starfinder Society #4-04: Mission Not Found</em></a> is best suited to a team with technological expertise and diplomatic inclinations. Don’t forget that Verces has been hit hard by the Data Scourge, so pack extra ammo and be ready for anything.</p> 
                <p>Novice agents get a call to action when reclusive Venture-Captain Hilo Beruta tasks them with investigating a mysterious relic that can seemingly transport beings to different locations across the multiverse. What new worlds will these brave Starfinders discover? <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027rp/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-405-A-Waltz-Through-Myriad-Worlds"><em>Starfinder Society #4-05: A Waltz Through Myriad Worlds</em></a> is a collection of four quests written by four up-and-coming Starfinder authors: Fabby Garza, Alexi J.

                <p>While on a routine mission to catalogue a noble family’s heirlooms in Cheliax’s port city of Hinji, a team of novice Pathfinder agents went missing! Suspecting foul play, the Society dispatches a more experienced group to find these agents—or their remains—and put a stop to whoever might be hunting hapless Pathfinders in the streets of Hinji. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027rn?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-223-An-Agents-Obligation"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-23: An Agent’s Obligation</em></a> is an adventure for levels 3–6 written by Joshua Hennington.</p> 
                <p>When the Pathfinder Society’s leaders first set their sights on distant Iobaria, they planned to establish a new lodge and solidify the Society’s reputation as the preeminent group of modern day adventurers and explorers. They knew the region was dangerous and had an extensive history—but they couldn’t have anticipated the true extent of what they would discover there.

                <p>Speaking of written correspondence, it looks like there’s a bunch of mail piling up from several prominent Inner Sea lodges. <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpa">Some of it looks urgent</a>, but I’m sure it can wait another month or so while we handle these other critical matters. Everything is fine.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">It all started when Starfinder launched and John Compton (lead of Organized Play development at the time) kept threatening me with a “Time Capsule Boon” where he’d let Pathfinder Society Characters transition into Starfinder Society. It was something of the atomic bomb equivalent of threats to be uttered in the office. The idea of crossing the streams between the campaigns was ludicrous. LUDICROUS, I SAY!</p> 
                <p>Cut to a few years later: John had moved on to join the Starfinder team (ha, irony!), and the new Pathfinder Society developer, Michael Sayre, approached me with the historic line of “Hey, wanna do a crossover interactive?” Thus the idea of doing a crossover interactive between Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society was truly born!</p> 
                <p>A few months later, during one of my in-person visits to the Seattle office, Michael and I got to deliver our pitch to both James Jacobs and Rob McCreary (the Creative Directors for both Pathfinder and Starfinder, respectively). Michael and I finished a whirlwind pitch that talked about time travel, navigating the Gap, and using the Maze of the Open Road to travel to far-off lands.</p> 
                <p>In the ensuing seconds, you could have heard a pin drop. The only real sound in the room was the formation of sweat on the respective brows of Michael and I, as our ridiculous pitch was hurled at our company’s two creative visionaries.</p> 
                <p>Then, with wide smiles, the two of them both joined in on the scheming! Dimension of Time, Hounds of Tindalos, Chronomancy and more were thrown at the wall as possible reasons and storyline elements for this outlandish plan, and the Organized Play Team had full buy-in from Paizo’s Creative Directors.</p> 
                <p>Of course, Michael Sayre would go on to great deeds in his current role as a designer for Pathfinder. That meant that a new lead would need to step in and help, which brings Jenny Jarzabski into the fold. Jenny heard the wild plan of a crossover special and she immediately took the figurative football and ran with it, deciding to tackle the story on her end!</p> 
                <p>So let’s listen to her explain what happened next...</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/631e6318-8669-4173-b5a1-50783f1db45b/072121_FELISE.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/631e6318-8669-4173-b5a1-50783f1db45b/072121_FELISE.png" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A dark skinned humanoid with short red hair, stands in a teal jumpsuit with their hands on their hips, and their blaster holstered "></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3a8ab5e7-2bdd-4413-80a7-e091a2f689d3/072121_HERAXIA.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3a8ab5e7-2bdd-4413-80a7-e091a2f689d3/072121_HERAXIA.png" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Artist Przemyslaw Golab.

                </div> 
                <p>I’ve been tagged in! As Thursty said, this idea started before I joined the team, but I took over the narrative planning, and of course the development on the Starfinder side.</p> 
                <p>Obviously, this special is going to feel different from the ones you’ve played in the past. First of all, this is an epic crossover event that spans time, space, and two different rules systems and settings! That’s pretty darn exciting by itself, right? But that’s not all! When our unholy trinity—John Compton, Thursty, and myself—got together to talk shop and brainstorm ideas for how to make this special, well, <em>special</em>, we came to a unified decision. Almost all of our previous interactives have been world-shattering events where the PCs play big damn heroes trying to save the whole world. It’s a pretty cool way to frame an event, but after years of this, the devs were engaged in a race against ourselves to make each year’s special bigger and the stakes higher than the last. This is not a sustainable cycle. Quickly, we found ourselves (and many of the players!) burning out and feeling fatigue from saving the world year after year.</p> 
                <p>That’s why this year’s special won’t be about saving the world. This time, it’s personal. Based on notes from our brainstorm sesh, I crafted a heartwarming (or heartbreaking?) narrative in which the PCs can save a group of lost explorers. In order to experience the full story, you should play both the Pathfinder and Starfinder versions of the event. Now, if you’re not sold on the smaller-scale event, don’t worry. This plotline is epic—it involves a crossover between the Societies with both sides time traveling and battling extraplanar horrors, after all!</p> 
                <p>Telling you any more would bring us firmly into spoiler territory, but I look forward to the results of your efforts to delve into mysterious ruins across two timelines and save maybe not the world, but someone’s world. Well, maybe you’ll save the world, too. Multitasking.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Veerkea’s life began at sea. Literally, of course: like almost all ijtikris, she hatched from a free-floating egg, grew as an instinct-driven larva for two years, and metamorphosed into her adult, squid-like body before clambering to shore, drawing her first breath of air, and searching for other ijtikris to adopt as her family. Yet, ijtikris hadn’t ruled the planet Iji since ancient times, when the technologically superior Veskarium conquered, annexed, and renamed the world Vesk-2, the first of many conquests. So, when young Veerkea first peeked her upper eyes above the waves, she instead spotted and reflexively bonded to a vesk squadron performing amphibious landing drills along the beach. The vesk gave her a name and a hearty welcome, delighted in teaching her Vesk profanity for the afternoon, and then transported her to the nearest settlement on the isle of Ijahi for proper adoption, but Veerkea vehemently and violently protested being separated from her new family. Impressed by her outburst’s ferocity and considering this a sign the god Damoritosh’s favor, the local commander allowed the new unit to remain together.</p> 
                <p>Part daughter, part mascot, Veerkea thrived under her myriad parents’ tutelage. Her formal education was straightforward: Veskarium lore, physical training, tactics, weapon proficiency, demolitions, and field repairs. Wherever the unit traveled, she absorbed languages, cultural norms, and local technologies even more quickly than her basic foundation. In her final year abroad, the unit operated alongside a predominantly shirren humanitarian mission on a survey of Swarm-ravaged worlds. Where survivors held out, the joint operation provided material aid, spiritual succor courtesy of the god Hylax, and assistance clearing out remaining Swarm hives. Where none had survived, the operation catalogued the damage and whatever remained of these now extinct societies. With each ruined world, Veerkea not only grew more intrigued by the compassionate teachings of Hylax, the Forever Queen, she also saw parallels between these ravaged planets and unanswered questions she had about her own home world. Who were the ijtikris really? And what were they like before the Veskarium invaded?</p> 
                <p>To their credit, both the shirrens and vesk supported her inquiries. Her sergeant-mother, Bhaskeh, secured her what scant imperial documentation survived the pre-Gap conquest of Vesk-2. The more Veerkea read, though, the more the narrative fell apart, seemingly stitched together by placating guesses from fifth-hand sources. Even the venerated poem <em>Skyships Over Shallow Seas</em>, supposedly written by an eyewitness, began with “The skyships arrived with the monsoon rains,” yet the planet had never experienced seasons, much less monsoons. Veerkea had to learn more, and with Bhaskeh’s glowing recommendation to their superiors, the ijtikri secured admission to the prestigious Xakemath College of Cultural Studies on Vesk Prime. </p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/40ecbb53-a04b-4b7b-be5d-0b7e60b51792/092021_Nanocyteiconic.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/40ecbb53-a04b-4b7b-be5d-0b7e60b51792/092021_Nanocyteiconic.jpg" align="left" width="350" hspace="5" alt="A giant squid creature with two pairs of eyes in its elongated head is dressed in an environmental space suit.

              <p>It proved a terrible fit. The social sciences had undergone an uneasy revolution since the Silent War’s conclusion years before, but the Xakemath College of Cultural Studies remained a stubborn bastion of tenure and tradition. Its curriculum taught culture through the Veskarium’s lens: understanding Veskarium cultures as they fit into the empire, identifying fissures in alien societies to exploit during war, leveraging key cultural traditions in conquered peoples to minimize rebellion and maximize harmony, and exploring ruins to salvage forgotten technologies for integration into the military. In practice, Veerkea absorbed few affirmative lessons from her required reading, instead treating each record as another miscalculation in vesk xenoanthropology. Though she was too shy to challenge her instructors’ lectures in person, her essays became increasingly confident critiques of the field. Perhaps surprisingly, her instructors never punished her dissident thoughts. Instead, her essays registered as heartfelt challenge—like a young warrior boasting about her unbeatable combat style—and, by Damoritosh, the best way to test insolent claims was on the battlefield! They had just the site in mind.</p> 
              <p>To her surprise, Veerkea graduated with distinction a year early, and with her diploma came her new assignment as archaeological consultant to a military operation on a no-name planetoid along the Veskarium’s frontier. The low-gravity rock was barren save for a crashed starship and the hundred soldiers forming a perimeter around it, with heavy weapons trained on the wreckage. The commander quickly checked her paperwork, asked if she was the negotiator they were waiting for and, without waiting for her answer, called out to the soldiers: “Make way! We’re sending in the archaeologist!” Giving her a datapad and a grim salute, the commander wished Veerkea luck and pointed her to the wreckage.</p> 
              <p>She skimmed files as quickly as she could—wreckage that seemed to predate the Gap, advanced technology, initial successes by salvage crews…then attacks, robotic clouds that shredded flesh from the inside out, and several skirmishes fought to a stalemate. What a mess. She clambered inside through an airlock blown off by Vesk ordnance and began exploring and documenting the mysterious starship. Although unfamiliar, the technologies seemed intuitive, and she experimentally flipped a few switches to check for power. Something awoke. Rushing along the corridors, countless particles swarmed together into a roiling mass of nanites that screeched an unintelligible challenge. Veerkea froze, wanting to reach for her sidearm. Yet she spotted the bullet holes and triple gashes of doshko blades here and knew that not only had the vesk tried combat and failed, but also that her own methodologies were being put to the test. And so, she spoke.</p> 
              <p>For more than an hour, the cloud and ijtikri spoke past one another, struggling to find some common linguistic ground. She drew simple pictures on the datapad, the cloud reshaped itself into simple pictures of its own, yet their slow progress seemed only to aggravate the strange being. Lacking a better option, Veerkea sketched Hylax’s sacred symbol. In an instant of apparent curiosity or recognition, the cloud calmed, slowed, and approached. As it formed pseudopods to touch the symbol, Veerkea lifted one of her own arms in greeting, and the cloud obliged by reaching out to make contact. With a touch, the ijtikri’s mind swam with the cloud’s projected telepathic thoughts.</p> 
              <p><em>“I am the child of a devastated world</em>,” sang the voice, yet Veerkea thought the same words and knew them true of herself. Again, they projected their thoughts at each other, each saying, “<em>Mine is a history all have forgotten.</em>” A shiver rippled through the cloud, as though it were confused or pleasantly surprised by how closely their thoughts aligned. Embarrassed, Verrkea motioned for her strange friend to speak first, and the cloud obliged, reshaping itself into hazy silhouettes of skylines, landscapes, and people as it spoke. “<em>I remember so little: beautiful cities with soaring arches, rolling hills rising above purple seas, creatures whose names I don’t know, people with stories I have forgotten…and then here</em>.” The cloud stopped swirling and reshaping. “<em>Alone. Homeless.</em>”</p> 
              <p>Veerkea’s eyes dimmed with sadness, and she offered her own tale of conflict, devastation, and dogma, yet also of compassion, camaraderie, and discovery. Of a young ijtikri who poked her eyes above the waves and found an unconditionally supportive family…and she ended her thoughts with “<em>Not alone</em>.” Less a statement of sympathy than a promise. Sensing an invitation, the cloud washed over Veerkea, settling on her before the particles painlessly melded into her skin. “<em>Not alone</em>,” it echoed. “<em>Home</em>.”</p> 
              <p>Veerkea’s apparent victory impressed the Veskarium, with her superiors equating her taming the nanites to a warrior taming a wild defrex to use as a mount. However, Veerkea retired after only a few more years, using her earnings to travel the stars and catalogue forgotten societies’ stories. Her and her nanites’ thoughts are as one, yet on occasion and without warning, the cloud reshapes into some image as if reliving a forgotten dream or channeling some omen from Hylax. Veerkea is quick to catalogue these strange clues, certain that one day they’ll help her locate her passengers’ lost home.</p>

              <blockquote> 
               <p itemprop="description">Nkayah yawned from her post in the tall tree. The job of scouting and protecting wanderers was always more exciting on the move. On the move, she had to stay on her toes, taking silent cover behind trees or climbing into the jungle canopy to maintain line of sight with the strangers and visitors who passed through Ekujae lands. She lived for the silent chase as she assessed outsiders’ motivations. For over a century and a half, Nkayah had ensured non-Mwangi travelers posed no threat to the Ekujae, and that they didn’t release any of the myriad evils trapped within the heart of the jungle—intentionally or not.</p> 
               <p>It was an important job that Nkayah took with the seriousness it deserved, but it could also be incredibly boring. Like right now, as she strained to keep from nodding off while watching two foreigners talk about, well, something. It didn’t help that the dwarf and half-orc interlopers spoke a language completely foreign to her. It sounded similar to the Avistani language the Aspis Consortium agents from Bloodcove spoke when they needed to hide their awful deeds, but she had no linguistic training to confirm it. Despite not knowing what they were saying, the experience she’d earned over decades of training made her confident that their intent wasn’t malicious. But they were stumbling—loudly—through a very ancient Serpentfolk ruin, and that meant that they still posed a threat.</p> 
               <p>She strained her jaw as she stifled a yawn and adjusted her position to ensure she didn’t get too comfortable. A wilderness nap could wait until the pair of foreigners moved beyond her territory and became someone else’s responsibility. Whatever they sought, the longer they spent out in the open like this, the longer they were in danger of needing more than just surveillance. Sometimes it helped to remember that even these boring parts of the job ultimately kept the innocent and defenseless wanderers of their lands safe, as well as protecting her people and the world at large.</p> 
               <p>The dwarf and her half-orc companion let out a series of surprised shouts, snapping Nkayah’s attention back to the moment. Doubtless, she wasn’t the only one in the area reminded of the visitors’ presence by their arguing. They seemed at odds about what to make of one particular section of the ruin, a strange stone that Nkayah had never noticed here before. Perhaps the situation wasn’t quite as boring as she’d thought!</p> 
               <p>She scurried from branch to bough, until she found herself balanced on a long, lonely limb directly over the foreigners. She was close to them, no more than ten feet above the half-orc’s head, so they could easily see her if they looked up, but they were too engrossed in the strange stone formation. As long as she didn’t draw their gaze, they wouldn’t be looking up any tiem soon. </p> 
               <p>The formation was a cone of rough stone, nearly seven feet from base to point, that rose like an incisor from the ground. It wasn’t worked stone like the rest of the Serpentfolk ruin, and it lacked the ophidian motifs and iconography that denoted the ancient Ydersian structures for what they were. This looked both organic and completely at odds with the natural order, and it was no wonder it had so grasped the visitors’ attention. The dwarf held her hand a few inches from the stalactite’s surface, but didn’t touch it, as though sensing for an aura of evil.</p> 
               <p>No, she wasn’t feeling an aura, but rather a steady stream of frigid air blowing from the stone’s otherwise smooth surface. Now that she recognized it, Nkayah could feel the steady airflow herself, and even at this distance. The chill made the skin on her arms prickle with gooseflesh. This certainly warranted more investigation, but she had to focus on her charges—the dwarf and the half-orc, not the ruin, which she’d be able to come back to once the pair no longer presented a threat. And the louder they got, the greater that threat grew.</p> 
               <p>Doubtless, her counterparts from nearby were already on their way to see what the fuss was about. Nhayah shook her head and loosened the harness holding her weapons to her body. This was going to get worse before it got better.</p> 
               <p>Her instincts proved accurate when the sound of arrows in flight drew her attention away from the outsiders and toward the edge of the ruins. She wasn’t the only Ekujae in the area anymore.</p> 
               <p>The dwarf and half-orc were still loudly arguing about the cold stone tooth. They hadn’t noticed the arrival of Nkayah’s kin, and she knew they wouldn’t hear her either as she skittered effortlessly away, mere feet above their heads. Without losing sight of the foreign travelers, Nhayah darted in towards the site of the arrows’ impact.</p> 
               <p>It didn’t take long to find one, embedded into the trunk of a gnarled tree: a darkwood arrow with dull gray fletching, clearly Ekujae-made. If she were on the ground, it would be at eye-level, meaning whatever they were shooting at was not terribly large. As she dropped down and pulled the arrow out to inspect it, her teeth clenched instinctively. Nkayah glanced at her surroundings to locate the arrow’s source, but knew her compatriots were as good at remaining unseen as she was. She’d see them when they wanted to be seen, just as they likely didn’t know she was there until she revealed herself.</p> 
               <p>The arrowhead was tipped with cold iron, finely sharpened, and faintly tingling with magical energy that pulsed lightly into her fingertips. Though the spell was no longer active, she knew what its presence meant.</p> 
               <p>“Demons” she hissed, still too soft for her charges to hear, even if they weren’t now yards away and engrossed in their investigation. She wished she could scream at them. <em>Leave it alone, you fools. Leave our lands and stop meddling in things you don’t understand!</em></p>

               </div> 
               <p>She pulled her bow from her back and swung back up into the branches with her free arm. She moved swiftly back to her spot where she’d previously kept watch and aimed her bow across the clearing in the direction she knew this threat would come from. She hadn’t yet determined whether the demon was somehow tied to the cold-air stone or simply drawn to the site by the outsiders, but regardless, the pair didn’t deserve to die at the claws of a vicious demon just because they were loud.</p> 
               <p>The underbrush rustled as the threat approached, and she notched a cold iron arrow of her own. A hulking form, only partially visible through the jungle’s dense foliage, emerged. She fired. The arrow flew true, and the dark form hissed as its iron head burned across its demonic body. The dwarf and her companion, suddenly aware that they weren’t alone in the ruins, stared, paralyzed with fear, and barely mustered the strength to look up and see Nkayah above them, fearless, with another arrow at the ready. She released the bowstring; the arrow flew and then… darkness.</p> 
               <p>She cursed as she dropped from the tree, racing for where her charges once stood, but could not find them in the darkness. The cool, constant airflow from the stone tooth let her know where it stood, where the dwarf and half-orc had been a moment before. She listened for their voices, but they were either too scared to scream or already lost. Then, her ears caught other voices, two of them, in her own tongue.</p> 
               <p>“Hunters!” she called back in kind. “Speak again so that I may find you. I am a scout. I can navigate to you in this darkness.”</p> 
               <p>The elves obeyed and signaled to her in hushed tones, somewhere off to her left. She made her way to them, slowly, not wanting to injure herself on a bit of the ruin she could not see. It took some time but finally, she connected with another form. The other thankfully stood firmly despite the collision.</p> 
               <p>“I am Nkayah of the Bat Clan. My mother was of the Hawk Clan. You’re demon hunters?”</p> 
               <p> The erratic sound of the others’ steps told her they were fumbling in the dark. “I am Kayoye,” the voice to her right began, “of the Velociraptor Clan. My mother is of the Gecko clan, and we hunt all forms of evil in this jungle. Today’s prey just happened to be a demon.”</p> 
               <p>“And I am Dafiyi, also of the Velociraptor Clan. My mother is of the Python clan. The darkness should wear off shortly. This is not its first attempt to escape us today.”</p> 
               <p>Nkayah sighed. Waiting without being able to see anything at all was incredibly frustrating, but she stood alert, with a firm grasp on her bow and an arrow at the ready. Soon, the demon’s magical cloak of darkness disappeared as swiftly as it had descended, and the dim, green-tinted light of the sun through jungle canopy flooded her sight. Finally able to see, the elves clustered together, back-to-back, and notched arrows, centuries of experience between them allowing the trio to work seamlessly as a defensive unit despite just meeting moments earlier. They rotated clockwise, six sharp eyes and six keen ears scanning the jungle from leaf-strewn floor to branch-woven canopy for any threat. The demon was gone, and no trace of the dwarf and the half-orc remained.</p> 
               <p>Nkayah cursed and kicked a piece of rubble. She rolled the events of the past few minutes over in her head: the serpentfolk ruins, the new-yet-ancient otherworldly stalactite, the demon, and the demon hunters now flanking her. </p> 
               <p>It was a coincidence. The cold-blowing stone and the demon were unrelated. That made things more interesting, perhaps, but also more complicated.</p> 
               <p>Dafiyi stared at the ground in concentration and muttered an incantation to himself, then pointed to the east. “Kayoye and I still have a demon to kill. We found it before, and we’ll find it again. And you?”</p> 
               <p>Nkayah surveyed the trees around her, searching for an answer. It came to her in the form of two familiar voices yelling in distress. The dwarf and half-orc were still alive!</p> 
               <p>She nodded to her kin and smirked, “Sounds like I still have two charges that need my protection, and what do you know? They seem to be in the same direction! I’ll have to return to check on <em>that</em> later.” She tilted her head toward the mysterious stone amid the ruins.</p> 
               <p>Swiftly and silently, she made her way through the dense jungle toward the frantic voices to the east. Dafiyi and Kayoye fell into step just behind her. This was more like it, she thought to herself. The job of protecting wanderers was always more exciting on the move.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">The Mwangi Expanse is a vast and diverse place. The region’s people hold a variety of beliefs that include gods not seen anywhere else. You can read about a number of these gods, including returning gods like Grandmother Spider and new gods like catfolk god Adanye, in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse">Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</a>.</p> 
               <p>We here at Team Lost Omens thought it would be fun to take some of these Mwangi gods and match them up with other gods, both Mwangi and otherwise, to create new pantheons. Pantheons are groups of related gods that a faithful can worship as a collective, focusing on either a specific deity within the pantheon or following all of the gods together. You can find more information on pantheons in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic">Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</a>.</p> 
               <p>Each of the following pantheons includes at least one Mwangi deity and can serve as a suitable faith for characters hailing from the Mwangi Expanse. We encourage everyone to use the following pantheons as examples when creating their own pantheons for home play. If you make your own pantheon or end up playing a character that follows one of the following pantheons, let us know!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5ee751e5-091b-438f-915f-ae14d3bb4b09/071621_majagua.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5ee751e5-091b-438f-915f-ae14d3bb4b09/071621_majagua.png" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A carving of Majagua, goddess of community.

               <h3>Demon Bringers</h3> 
               <p><b>Alignment</b> LG (LG, LN, NG, CG)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b> protection, retribution, and keeps<br> <b>Divine Font</b> heal<br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Strength or Constitution<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Survival<br> <b>Domains</b> creation, family, might, protection<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> cities, duty<br> <b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <em>mage armor</em>, 4th: <em>creation</em>, 7th: <em>true target</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> create fortifications and defenses to protect those who can’t protect themselves, improve your hunting abilities, seek out evils that threaten others<br> <b>Anathema</b> exclude innocents from safe havens, intentionally destroy a shelter, allow demon summoners to live on unpunished<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> machete</p> 
               <p>The Mwangi Expanse is full of dangers. Of particular note are the various demons and other Abyssal creatures that roam the jungles. Many of these creatures are drawn to the Mwangi Expanse by the presence of Angazhan’s or Lamashtu’s might, while others are direct servitors of those faithful to the demonic. While the Mwangi Expanse is home to many demon hunters that keep these evil forces at bay, many of them work in independent groups. It’s only with the combined efforts of the demon hunters that the Mwangi Expanse can be rid of this demonic presence and the people of the Mwangi Expanse can be safe.</p> 
               <p>The demon hunters among the Ekujae elves, Matanji orcs, Mwangi catfolk, Mbe’ke dwarves, and others began to join forces in their demon hunts and brought their respective gods with them. This led to the worship of a pantheon of righteous gods that both offered the might to destroy demons and the wisdom to defend others. Through the worship of Adanye, Chohar, Kazutal (in her form as Majagua), and Torag, these mighty hunters find the strength they need to make the Mwangi Expanse a safer place. While this pantheon didn’t originally have a name, the local Mwangi populations eventually dubbed them the Demon Bringers, as their faithful would bring home trophies in the form of demon heads, claws, or tails. Followers of the Demon Bringers use their skills to hunt demons and other evils that lie within the Mwangi Expanse. They also help create homes and fortifications for those that can’t fight, as the ultimate goal of the Demon Bringers is a safer Mwangi for all.</p>

               <h3>The Freeing Flame</h3> 
               <p><b>Alignment</b> CN (NG, N, CG, CN)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b> liberation, toppling tyranny, and self-realization<br> <b>Divine Font</b> harm or heal<br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Strength or Charisma<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Stealth<br> <b>Domains</b> freedom, change, might, protection<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> ambition, destruction, zeal<br> <b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <em>anticipate peril</em>, 3rd: <em>fireball</em>, 6th: <em>mislead</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> free others from oppression, release harmful tethers be they physical or spiritual, work toward your best self and inspire others to follow<br> <b>Anathema</b> allow tyrants to escape punishment after their reign ends, enslave or oppress others, prevent others from honestly expressing themselves<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> sword cane</p> 
               <p>Local stories say that the people of Vidrian had the support of the gods when the time came for revolution. Lubaiko provided the first flames of rebellion, literally igniting the first cart that led to the initial confrontation at a plantation on the outskirts of Eleder. The tales then note that the casks on the cart erupted as the first blow was struck, creating a massive explosion that woke everyone on the plantation. Many say this was Cayden Cailean’s way of showing his support. As everyone stirred about and watched those first servants and slaves fight, others were fearful of the consequences. It was the touch of hope that Milani granted them that finally gave them the strength to rise up and fight for freedom.</p> 
               <p>Whether or not the stories hold truth, the Freeing Flame remains a notable pantheon among the people of Vidrian today. The young nation broke free from the shackles of oppression and now looks toward bettering itself in the future, a mantra that many Vidrics and followers of the Freeing Flame follow for themselves. With the guidance of Milani, the courage of Cayden, and the inspiration of Lubaiko, a faithful can burn away maladies of the heart to become a person that is free to do as they wish, but also do so without infringing on others. Some follow these ideals to stop tyrants and liberate those that can’t live freely, while others take these teachings to become independent figures with little concern of others’ expectations.</p>

               <h3>Sky Keepers</h3> 
               <p><b>Alignment</b> NG (LG, NG, CG)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b> freedom, skies, storms, weather<br> <b>Divine Font</b> heal<br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Dexterity or Wisdom<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Acrobatics<br> <b>Domains</b> air, change (<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em> 112), protection, wyrmkin (<em>Gods &amp; Magic</em> 119)<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> freedom, lightning<br> <b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <em>gust of wind</em>, 4th: fly, 9th: <em>storm of vengeance</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> remove anyone that would threaten those who live among the skies, encourage others to find a way to live among the clouds, honor the might of storms<br> <b>Anathema</b> interfere with the natural phases of the sky, remove a creature’s innate means to fly<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> longbow</p> 
               <p>The only thing more expansive than the Mwangi jungles, mountains, and rivers are the skies that rest above them. There are many who would seek to take control of the skies and there are others who seek to keep the skies free for all. From evil spellcasters looking to wield the weather for their own wicked whims to deadly monsters that make them dangerous to travel, the skies are never truly safe. Thankfully, an unlikely alliance of gods works together to keep the skies over the Expanse safe.</p> 
               <p>Apsu, god of good dragons, saw how his son Dahak once tried to burn down the entirety of the Mwangi Expanse and took it upon himself to defend the skies that rest over those that put a stop to Dahak’s destruction. Uvoko, the diamond ring, is a living embodiment of the Mwangi skies and valued Apsu’s aid. Finally, with the recent release of Ranginori, the elemental lord took to reclaiming the skies from evildoers. When the three gods encountered each other, they formed the Pact of the Sky Keepers, dedicating themselves to both keeping the skies safe for all, but also maintaining the natural cycles and orders of the skies. The sky belongs to everyone, but ultimately, the sky has no master and attempts to force one’s will upon by forcibly changing the weather or committing similar acts goes against the Pact. Followers of the Sky Keepers can be found all over Golarion, but Apsu and Uvoko’s focus on the Mwangi Expanse leads to many worshippers operating in the region.</p>

               <h3>Touch of the Sun</h3> 
               <p><b>Alignment</b> NG (LG, LN, NG, CG)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b> compassion, rebirth, and the sun<br> <b>Divine Font</b> heal<br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Constitution or Wisdom<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Diplomacy<br> <b>Domains</b> family, healing, passion, sun<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> change, vigil (Gods &amp; Magic 118), zeal<br> <b>Cleric</b> Spells 1st: <em>soothe</em>, 2nd: <em>false life</em>, 7th: <em>fiery body</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> help others with changes that can improve their lives, mind those that others forget or exclude, offer second chances, stand up for others when they can’t stand for themselves<br> <b>Anathema</b> challenge the sun, ignore the pleas of others when you are able to help, refuse to give someone else a chance to offer their truth<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> rapier</p> 
               <p>Legends state that Chohar, Luhar, and Tlehar were the first sun-kings of Mzali, building the city as a safe haven for the people of the Expanse. Their might, leadership, and kindness earned them a place among the heavens, transforming them into the sun gods of Mzali. As gods, they met Sarenrae, another goddess of the sun, and for a time, all four worked together to help the people of Golarion. Eventually, whether intentionally or otherwise, the people of Mzali forgot their sun gods. The sun gods watched as the people of Mzali forgot prayers and songs to their former gods. The sun gods wept because their people could no longer see or hear them, but Sarenrae offered them words of encouragement: there would be a time when people remembered the sun gods once more.</p> 
               <p>Thanks to the efforts of the Bright Lions of Mzali, worship of the sun gods has returned to the Mwangi Expanse. While the sun gods appreciate this renewed faith, they did not forget Sarenrae’s kindness. When asked about their disappearance, the sun gods merely state they were biding their time alongside a friend. This friendship led to the worship of the three sun gods alongside Sarenrae as a greater sun pantheon. The collective sun gods teach that kindness and second chances are pivotal values. They also note that sometimes a person needs to change into someone new before they are truly themselves and instruct that helping others with these changes is akin to helping bring new life into the world. The four gods know that there might be other forgotten gods and peoples out there that just need some kindness to make it through their period of turmoil, so they ask their worshippers to help these forgotten in whatever way they can. Finally, the sun gods make it clear that lost or abandoned gods can still find companionship among the divine and welcome these gods to join their ranks.</p>

These adjustments will go into effect when Year 3 launches on August 19th.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f207f4f4-7b11-4475-b270-fff087f98952/071521_CatfolkLibrarian.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f207f4f4-7b11-4475-b270-fff087f98952/071521_CatfolkLibrarian.png" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt=": A bipedal cat dressed in colorful robes holding a large book"></a>

               <p><b>Catfolk</b>: The majority of catfolk (also known as amurruns) live in southern Garund, in regions of the setting that had not yet seen much attention in Pathfinder Second Edition when the ancestry first came out. With the release of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, we now have plenty of support for people to craft stories related to catfolk characters.</p> 
               <p><em>Change</em>: The catfolk boon is currently restricted to allow each player to purchase it only once. We’re removing this limit, so everyone can create multiple catfolk characters.</p>

               <p><b>Hobgoblins</b>: At the outset of Pathfinder Second Edition, hobgoblins had just begun to establish a diplomatic force through the founding of the nation of Oprak. As word spread of the successful collaboration between Pathfinders and a hobgoblin army unit in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023dd?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-119-Iolite-Squad-Alpha"><em>Pathfinder Scenario #1-19: Iolite Squad Alpha</em></a>, some citizens of Oprak were inspired to join the Pathfinder Society via a program that allowed them to leverage their existing expertise to undergo a shortened training program at the Grand Lodge. </p> 
               <p><em>Change</em>: The hobgoblin boon is currently restricted to allow each player to purchase it only once. We’re removing this limit, so everyone can create multiple hobgoblin characters.</p>

               <p><b>Leshy</b>: The founding of the Verdant Wheel faction served as a recruitment catalyst for the growing number of leshys who have decided to join the Society. As members of the Verdant Wheel unlocked the secret of allowing anyone to establish enough of a connection to primal magic to call upon a leshy familiar (as seen in the Achievement Points store), word of the faction’s deeds spread among the more powerful nature spirits who are embodied in independent leshys. The player characters in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022x2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-115-The-Blooming-Catastrophe"><em>#1-15: The Blooming Catastrophe</em></a> fought against and ultimately freed a group of Abyss-scarred leshys from the influence of the demonic realm, some of whom took the opportunity to join the Pathfinder Society. New leshy agents include Jackpot from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027l2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-218-The-Fanciful-March-of-Urwal"><em>#2-18: The Fanciful March of Urwal</em></a> and a fungus leshy agent from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s7?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-1-The-Second-Confirmation"><em>Intro #1: The Second Confirmation</em></a>.</p> 
               <p><em>Change</em>: Leshys will join the Pathfinder Core Rulebook ancestries and become freely available to all players who have the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide"><em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em></a> without a boon (just like kobolds are freely accessible to players who have the Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide). While we figured that the early access provided by boons was a fair benefit for a reduction from 80 AcP to 40 AcP that lizardfolk have, we wanted to grant something special for the other half of leshy’s price reduction. If you already have a leshy boon at the time that this change goes live, you’ll be able to redownload your existing leshy boon with an upgrade, granting the character the benefits of a successful resurrect ritual the first time they die, just like the Second Chance boon in the Achievement Points store!</p>

               <p style="font-size: 13px;">artist by Mary Jane Pajaron. </p> 
               <p><b>Lizardfolk</b>: In southern Garund, the Pathfinder Society recently reestablished a long-lapsed trading arrangement with the trading city of Ekkeshekar, whose people are predominantly lizardfolk (also known as iruxis). Thanks to the successes of the player characters in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021x5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-109-StarCrossed-Voyages"><em>#1-09: Star-Crossed Voyages</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023fe?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-123-The-StarCrossed-Court"><em>#1-23: Star-Crossed Court</em></a>, iruxis from in and around Ekkeshekar have taken interest in the Pathfinder Society’s mission. The release of Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse provides plenty of new material for people to craft stories for lizardfolk characters from this general region of the world. Additionally, the events of the new scenarios Intro <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s7?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-1-The-Second-Confirmation"><em>#1: The Second Confirmation</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s8?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-2-United-in-Purpose"><em>Intro #2: United in Purpose</em></a> give the Pathfinder Society a chance to make new inroads with an iruxi settlement in the Blackwood Swamp. </p> 
               <p><em>Change</em>: The lizardfolk boon’s price will reduce from 80 AcP to 40 AcP.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">That morning, several survey teams landed on the planet—which scientists back in the Pact Worlds had named Weydana-4—and began taking samples of the soil, the plants, and just about everything they could get their hands on. Long-distance scans had revealed that the planet had a breathable atmosphere, normal weather patterns, and an abundance of flora and fauna, but the corporate sponsors wanted everything double-checked firsthand and in advance of the hundreds of settlers that would soon be arriving.</p> 
               <p>But Lixette de Courtois was born and raised on Absalom Station, and though she spent years studying newly discovered planets like this one from afar, this was her first time setting foot on one. And she didn’t want to spend it scrounging through the dirt. When Zheffori, a biologist from Castrovel, shouted in excitement after finding a pile of hardened droppings from some unknown animal, Lixette muttered an excuse of “getting a better vantage point,” put her datapad on a crate, and climbed the nearby rise.</p> 
               <p>Her boots swished through the tall grass as she stepped out from the shade of several blue-leafed trees. The sun warmed her face as she fixed her gaze on the cloud-topped mountain range in the distance. Somewhere, a bird chirped. She took a deep breath of clean, sweet-smelling air and smiled. </p> 
               <p>“I could get used to this,” she mused. The bird continued to sing, but Lixette couldn’t really say whether or not it did so in response to her.</p> 
               <p>Lixette began to stroll along the top of the ridge until she caught the scent of something sweet. She stopped where the ground to her left became a sheer cliff. Approximately 150 feet below, an array of brightly colored flowers sprouted from a sprawling bush. Thick vines clung to the cliff face and reached all the way to the top, and vibrant blooms adorned these vines, providing the source of the fragrance. She squatted down to pluck one of the flowers, eager to bring it right under her nostrils for a good, long sniff.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly, the vine shot up and wrapped around her wrist.</p> 
               <p>Lixette let out a surprised shout. Again, the bird tweeted. Lixette was starting to think it was mocking her.</p> 
               <p>She pulled against the vine, but it held strong. Much stronger than it had any right to be. As it pulled her arm downward, Lixette lost her balance and fell to her knees at the edge of the cliff. A dislodged pebble tumbled into the empty space and soon landed quietly in the bush below, which prompted some kind of reaction from the plant; its leaves and branches parted—<em>like an opening mouth</em>, Lixette thought—to reveal a collection of jagged rocks. Even from a distance, Lixette could see them stained with blood. The sun glinted off something white nestled within the stones: the bones of several small creatures.</p> 
               <p>Lixette couldn’t help but be a little impressed at millennia of evolution that would produce such a unique feeding method. “Oh, you devious…,” she muttered while struggling against the vine trying to yank her over the edge. Its pull was insistent, and if she had been much smaller, Lixette would have already been dashed against the rocks below, her blood seeping into the soil to water this carnivorous plant’s roots.</p> 
               <p>Looking down, she saw another vine slithering its way toward her. If she didn’t free herself soon, her size wouldn’t save her. Lixette cried out for help, hoping someone from the survey team was near enough to hear her, but there was no immediate response. Even the bird had fallen silent. <em>Traitor</em>, Lixette thought.</p> 
               <p>The vine had now dragged her hand below the top of the cliff, and Lixette strained to keep her balance. She regretted not bringing anything to defend herself, but the bigwigs that sent her didn’t expect her to be traipsing off on her own. She had flaunted the protocols, and she would pay for it with her life. Lixette started to desperately pat down her jumpsuit with her free hand, hoping beyond hope that she had something—anything—that could save her.</p> 
               <p>She almost missed it at first: a thin cylinder of plastic. It was the stylus she had been using to enter observations on her datapad earlier. She must have absentmindedly slipped it into her left-hand pocket earlier. With a triumphant cry, Lixette pulled the stylus out and plunged it deep into the vine. The plant reflexively spasmed slightly, just enough to loosen its grip on her wrist. She pulled herself away from the edge of the cliff, muddying the backside of her jumpsuit in the process. The vine flopped onto the ground, the stylus still jutting out like a strange, plastic thorn, before it slid down and out of sight.</p> 
               <p>Lixette stood up and started to wipe the dirt off her legs but then thought better of it. She brushed a lock of sweaty hair off her forehead and suddenly let out a choked whimper of relief. The bird began to chirp again, as if nature was releasing its held breath. In a forgiving mood, Lixette smiled in the general direction of the birdsong.</p> 
               <p>As she walked back down the rise to the rest of her team, Lixette realized she had never felt more alive. Perhaps it was just the adrenaline of a near-death experience, but she had a spring in her step and a new purpose dawning in her mind.</p> 
               <p>Upon her return, Zheffori said, “Lix, where’d you go? Are you ok? You look a little… flushed.”</p> 
               <p>“Never better!” she replied.</p> 
               <p>“Okay then. Well, we’re all heading back to the shuttle, so get your last looks in for today.”</p> 
               <p>Lixette smiled, knowing that once they got back in orbit, she’d be requesting a seat on one of those colony ships. “This place hasn’t seen the last of me.”</p>

               <p>Four esteemed graduates from the College of Mysteries in Absalom are sent to a tiny desert village in eastern Thuvia along the banks of the Junira River. Rumor has it that everyone in this small community has suddenly developed magical abilities. Power that, if left unchecked, might spell their doom. Perhaps even more troubling, even those who just visit the town receive powers as well! Can these four spellslinging scholars work together to get to the bottom of this mystery before rogue magic tears the place apart?</p>

               <p>Kwibha listened to the First Speaker of the Dragon Wardens with one ear, his attention more focused on keeping warm. By tradition, these yearly negotiations were hold on this flat mountaintop just across the valley from the city of Cloudspire, the air so cold that Kwibha’s breath misted forth with every heartbeat. His late sister Jhirabi, who’d been training to be a Dragon Warden, said the location actually had been chosen because there were few other places where one could treat with a half-dozen dragons, but Kwibha would never be so crass as to say so out loud.</p> 
               <p><b>“…my rain-child’s third daughter is ready to leave the nest. It is time for her to have a territory of her own, a hoard and home atop a good tree. Do they still have that lightning-struck tree outside of Mua’bri…?”</b></p> 
               <p>For a moment, Kwibha envisioned a group of stout dwarven farmers, dour-faced and heavily armed, accompanied by a whimsical fledgling dragon the size of a sheep. The farmers would likely be more dangerous. Still, one had to start somewhere, and it was upon these formalized exchanges of gifts, territories, and protection that the partnership of dwarf and cloud dragon had been built.</p>

               <br> 
               <p>Another hour passed, then a second and third, and Kwibha felt the frost harden on the white scarf around his neck. Snow crunched underfoot as he shifted his weight, and still the dragons and the First Speaker of the Dragon Wardens continued their talks. Kwibha cast a sidelong glance at the First Speaker—Jhirabi had said they were chosen for endurance as well as diplomacy.</p> 
               <p>And then it was time.</p> 
               <p>“Noble kings,” the First Speaker said, for all dragons are accorded the title of kings, “I present to you Second Speaker Kwibha of the Bloodmarked.”</p> 
               <p>That was Kwibha’s cue. The dwarf strode forward, marshalling every scrap of dignity he possessed. To any other dwarf, Kwibha was a person of note, with his gold-embroidered kaftan of cashmere, amber-hilted sword, and the scarlet ribbon tied about his brow. The dragons, Kwibha fervently hoped, would be equally impressed.</p> 
               <p>“Noble kings of sky and cloud, revered ancestors of the storm, you whose wrath is lightning and whose mercy is the rain after a long drought,” Kwibha’s voice echoed off the mountaintops, finely pitched to carry to the great beings clustered before him, “I come bearing an offer from King Thabsing of K’Lereng, called the Blood-Eye.”</p> 
               <p><b>“And what is this offer, Second Speaker?”</b> one of the dragons whispered with a voice like the mist, soft yet inescapable. <b>“We have heard his plans of war before and have little interest in them.” </b></p> 
               <p>“Today, he proposes not war, but justice, not battle, but execution,” Kwibha said smoothly. He held out a single hand in the traditional orator’s pose. “Know this, noble kings. On the last day of the dry season, in the pirate city of Bloodcove where they celebrate the Tempest Day, there will be a great auction of treasures taken from the drowned land of Lirgen. Most of the Pirate Council of the Shackles plans to attend, and we’ve heard that the Hurricane Queen herself, Tessa Fairwind, shall be present.”</p> 
               <p><b>“And how do you know this thing will happen, Second Speaker?”</b> another cloud dragon asked in a voice that thundered across the mountaintop, causing drifts of snow to become tiny avalanches.</p> 
               <p>Kwibha hoped they would ask him this. With a great flourish, he swept his arm out and bowed genteelly to the assembled wyrms. “I know this, noble kings, for I shall conduct the auction myself.”</p> 
               <p><em>This</em> caught the dragons’ attention—and the attention of the Dragon Wardens, for that matter. Kwibha allowed himself a small smile. It had taken nearly two years to make the proper introductions, to pass himself from one pirate to the next in that stinking city. King Thabsing had provided the Lirgeni artifacts, from where it was not entirely clear, but it was Kwibha’s work that had brought this day about. Bloodcove was a very different place from the orderly, harmonious citadel of Cloudspire, a place of violence, greed, and broken oaths, but dwarves lived there as well. Buyers, mostly, to purchase the pirates’ stolen goods and send them back to the Mbe’ke, but a few disgraced sellers as well, who would trade with the Mbe’ke’s enemies. Kwibha had pretended to be one such, and he didn’t know if he’d ever feel properly clean again.</p> 
               <p>“The Free Captains are no fools, and they will expect treachery,” Kwibha continued in the ensuing silence. “But they will expect it from each other or myself. Their ships will be moored at harbor, their sailors carousing, their lieutenants and weather-wizards accompanying their captains for protection. The vessels will be virtually defenseless in the face of a sudden storm, honored lords of lightning,” Kwibha paused, before adding the final bait, “and they will be heavily laden with loot from a season’s successful piracy.”</p> 
               <p><b>“Your words intrigue, Second Speaker,”</b> said the senior-most dragon in a voice crackling with frost. <b>“We will weigh them and give an answer in three day’s time.”</b></p> 
               <p><b>“A question, Emissary of the Bloodmarked,”</b> a younger dragon said, leaning forward such that Kwibha could see the new scars on their horn, <b>“Your king’s plan will destroy the ships, but what of the pirates themselves?”</b></p> 
               <p>“A pirate without a ship, honored king, is like a turtle without a shell,” said Kwibha, his smile colder than the snow of the mountain. “With the Pirate Council trapped in Bloodcove, it will be a simple matter for King Thabsing to march his armies down from the mountains and take the city. And then we will try them, and we will sentence them, and we will hang these corsairs from every tree and doorpost.”</p> 
               <p><em>And then, Jhirabi, you will finally be avenged.</em></p>

               <h3>Laura-Shay Adams</h3> 
               <p>Greetings, I am Laura-Shay Adams, a part-time writer and full-time nerd. The amount of excitement I experienced at being able to contribute to Senghor was probably not entirely healthy, but warranted. Getting to provide and create perspective regarding the day-to-day life within the city and fleshing out some of the prominent businesses made me fall in love with Golarion all over again. The setting has so many strengths, and using it as a creative backdrop to offer such a wide array of cultural flavors that add so much to storytelling is honestly a joy. Each Lost Omens book that has come out has become my favorite, but the <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> area will be near and dear to my heart for decades to come. </p> 
               <p>If you are interested in seeing some of the homebrew projects I’ve come up with for my personal campaigns, one-shots, or my freelancer rates, drop by my website <a href="https://world-invader.com/" target="_blank">https://world-invader.com</a> or contact me via email, at contact.us@world-invader.com. Or if anyone is hosting a game set in the Mwangi Expanse and needs an extra player, I am your lady if our times align.</p>

               <h3>Mariam Ahmad</h3> 
               <p>Hello, I’m Mariam Ahmad (they/them). I’m a queer South Asian freelance writer, and I am so honored to have been a part of this book, my first with Paizo. For <em>Mwangi Expanse</em>, I had the pleasure of contributing lore on the Taralu and penning Amakell Inre and her draconic companion, Sahiba. My favorite part of this process was not just putting imagination to paper, but seeing it brought to life by the wonderful artists. </p> 
               <p>I’ve also written for other indie games, such as Thirsty Sword Lesbians and Rookwood. When I’m not writing or working on cultural consultancy projects, I stream on Huetopia as the GM of Kahaaniyaan and run a podcast called The Musafirs. Both are all Q-BIMPoC actual plays that are set in Sarzameen, my custom South Asian fantasy setting. If you want to see updates on things I do, as well enjoy pictures of food, cats and fibre arts, you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/media_junkie" target="_blank">@media_junkie</a>.</p>

               <p>Hey What’s happening! I’m Jahmal “Mad Jay” Brown, and I’m a contributing author on <em>Mwangi Expanse</em>. The Karina, Solar Ibis and the Zinba are my babies! During the design process I imagined big encounters focusing on these creatures. I know you’re not supposed to have a favorite kid. . . but mine are the Karina!</p> 
               <p>I also worked on Mzali and Senghor, two big and very different cities in the Expanse. The final product looks FANTASTIC! I’m glad I got to be a part of this project of so many amazing authors. You can catch up with my other works on <a href="http://www.madjayzero.com/#_blank" target="_blank">www.madjayzero.com</a>, and I am on twitter @madjayzero. I write about the games I run, game design, and facilitating game sessions. I’m currently doing layout work on my latest Kickstarter project, Lifted, a supers setting Zine.</p>

I’m Allie Bustion, freelance game designer and writer with indie projects of my own but also work on games like <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbian</em>s (“Shinsei Galactic Puroresu: Revolution - The Final Engagement”) and <em>Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants</em> (“The Scene Is Dead, Long Live The Scene”). I wrote a good chunk of things for <em>Mwangi Expanse</em>, but I think my favorite are the Song’o. I put a lot of the joyful parts of being Black from my childhood into them, and I’m super excited to share it with you all.</p>

               <p>Hey there! I’m Sarah, an Afro-Latina writer and designer. For the <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> book, I got to contribute various locations in Mzali and Senghor and had a blast. The Mzali Archives, the Sunlit Inn, the Mixing Mingle, and Burash’s Lost and Found are just a few of the entries I got to dream up! I’m really happy with the finished product and grateful to get to contribute alongside all these wonderful people. In my spare time, I write stories, come up with my own games and homebrews, and craft!</p> 
               <p>You can follow me and my work on all of that on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahndipityCos" target="_blank">@SarahndipityCos</a>, where I have links to reach out to and support me, and I tweet about my ideas and all manner of nerdy things.</p>

               <p>Hi all, my name is Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, credited as Sasha Laranoa Harving, and I wrote the Taralu dwarves! I was really glad to flesh out a culture I’d worked on prior in the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Character Guide</em>’s dwarf section, and I am excited for you all to see what wonders it has in store. I’ve been involved with a number of third-party publishers for Pathfinder and Starfinder as well, and I live in Chicago with my fiancee and my roommate, both also regular players in my games.

               <p>If you’ve been paying attention, you should know who I am by now. If you’re new here, let me tell you. I am Michelle Jones, freelance writer and game designer. I got to write several of the deity entries for <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse</em>, as well as a couple of bestiary entries, and collaborated with some very talented authors to reintroduce everyone to the city of Mzali. If you wanna know more, be sure to check out my twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Aleshakills" target="_blank">@AleshaKills</a>. I will be going into more detail about everything I wrote the moment the book hits the streets. </p> 
               <p>I promise you, <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> has everything you wanted and everything you didn’t know you needed.

               <h3>Travis Lionel</h3> 
               <p>Hello, my name is Travis Lionel also known on the internet as Rabbit. I worked on <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse</em>, specifically the sections on the People of Mzali and the Bright Lions. I did a lot of research on western and middle Africa as well as usede my own experiences as a black American and those of my African brothers and sisters. The most fun I had was studying how pre-colonized Africans lived among the Savannahs. Since working on this project, I’ve primarily been diving into video game livestreams via Twitch ( <a href="https://twitch.tv/EightBitRabbits" target="_blank">https://twitch.tv/EightBitRabbits</a> ). Here I talk about storytelling, how I learned to write and worldbuild, and, of course, role-playing games, such as <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>. For those who enjoy what I wrote and would like me to work on their projects as well, feel free to send business inquiries to <a href="mailto:Travis.TheBlanketFort@gmail.com">Travis.TheBlanketFort@gmail.com</a>. It’s kind of crazy going from the eleven year old in Catholic school turning biblical lore into super hero stories to where I am now. Hopefully, you guys enjoy the work many of us put into this project. </p>

               <p>My name is Hilary Moon Murphy. In real life, I am a librarian, freelancer, and enthusiastic Organized Play Game Master. I am so proud to be a part of this book! I wrote the section on the Sodden Lands, which included both the flooded city Hyrantum and the fierce Terwa Lords. Being able to update Hyrantum and reimagine what has happened with that flooded city and the rest of the Sodden Lands was a true pleasure. When we last saw Hyrantum, it was a sad and downtrodden shadow of its former glory. But Hyrantum is undergoing a new boom with a surprising new group of immigrants. . .

               <p>Здравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! (Hello, dear readers!) My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may know me from past Lost Omen books, such as <em>Legends</em> (where I wrote Baba Yaga), <em>Ancestries</em> (tieflings and duskwalkers), and the <em>Character Guide</em> (humans). On those occasions that Eleanor and Luis don’t need my humble assistance, I’m a Russian-American historian and educator with a book and everything.</p> 
               <p>For this book, I wrote the Mbe’ke dwarves, the Mwangi Jungle, and my personal favorite, the gnolls. My very first PC, way back in the misty depths of time, was a gnoll fighter, and I’ve been on a one-man crusade to get the loveable, furry lugs made into an acceptable PC ancestry ever since. Which, thanks to this excellent book, they are, so do check them out.</p> 
               <p>I should also mention that when not writing for Paizo, I’m working on <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em>, an upcoming campaign setting set in a world of lost suns, teleporting rats, and people who can drink your personality traits. Check out our Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>! Our first Kickstarter project is almost ready to release, so keep an eye out for what’ll come next. You might like it.</p>

               <h3>Soup</h3> 
               <p>I’m Soup! My parents call me Josh. I’m a nonbinary Korean-American freelance writer/game designer/anime podcast host. I have more than a reasonable number of opinions about fantasy and fantasy fiction. I’m always open to taking on new projects, so reach out to <a href="mailto:literalsoup@gmail.com#_blank" target="_blank">literalsoup@gmail.com</a>! You can see what I’m up to outside of work at <a href="https://literalsoup.com/" target="_blank">https://literalsoup.com/</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/LiteralSoup" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LiteralSoup</a>. </p>

               <h3>Jabari Weathers</h3> 
               <p>Hey there! </p> 
               <p>I’m Jabari Weathers, and I’m excited for y’all to get to see my work on the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse</em> sourcebook for Pathfinder 2nd Edition. I had the honor of writing “Reclaiming the Expanse,” as well as penning the cities of Jaha and Osibu for the book. </p> 
               <p>Earlier this year, you may have read my work on <em>Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</em> with Wizards of the Coast, and if you follow my twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/GoblinPrincete" target="_blank">@Goblinprincete</a>) or Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/jmwillustration/" target="_blank">@jmwillustration</a>), you can also gander the illustration work that I made my way into TTRPGs with and catch whisperings about game design and writing thoughts when I’m not spinning too many plates. Also, feel free to check out my illustration website—<a href="http://goblinprincete.com/" target="_blank">GoblinPrincete.com</a>. I hope you enjoy the book, and if you dig the sections I worked on, you can find more of my writing in Dominique Dickey and Charles Linton’s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nearfutures/tomorrow-on-revelation-iii" target="_blank">Tomorrowon Revelation III</a>, which kickstarted earlier this year.</p>

              <blockquote> 
               <p itemprop="description">The first volume of the Horizons of the Vast Adventure Path, “Planetfall,” is out now, but whenever your group plans on jumping into this campaign, you’ll want to make sure you’re prepared for whatever the planet of New Harmony throws at you! And there’s no better resource for that than the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>.</p> 
               <p>With hexploration rules used to survey the land (and which are summarized in the adventure) and deep dives on individual biomes, the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> is a treasure trove of information for Game Masters about to run Horizons of the Vast. For example, GMs can find advice and tables galore that will aid them in creating engaging NPCs and settlements that will help the PCs’ new home come to life. And if the characters decide to go exploring beyond the boundaries of their charter, there are plenty of random threat tables to keep them busy!</p> 
               <p>But the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> isn’t only for GMs! Players about to take on the monumental task of exploring a new world and maintaining a thriving settlement there will find plenty of exciting tidbits in this book. In addition to a wealth of options for every class (as discussed in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpm?A-Galaxy-Of-Character-Options">this previous blog</a>), there are also dozens of items that will help burgeoning explorers tame and survive just about any wilderness. Here’s one example:</p> 
               <h3>Energel Food Pellet</h3> 
               <p>Energel food pellets are easy-to-swallow meals in pill form, capable of staving off starvation, though they lack the appropriate nutrient profile needed for long-term sustenance. You can substitute one pack of food pellets for a day’s food. If you’re already starving when you consume energel food pellets, you automatically succeed at your Constitution check to avoid nonlethal damage that day, but the effects of starvation resume the following day. You cannot benefit from consuming more than two packs of energel food pellets per week.</p> 
               <p>New Harmony is in a system in the Vast and, as such, regular supply runs from the Pact Worlds will be few and far between. A canny survivalist will want to have some energel food pellets on hand in case they end up stranded far from the nearest settlement after running out of rations. Sure, they don’t replace regular meals, but staving off starvation for a day or two could give a character the time to hunt down a wild beast or determine which alien berries are safe to consume.</p> 
               <p>So, as you’re packing to begin your new life on New Harmony, don’t forget your <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. It could mean the difference between life and death!</p>

               <h3>Gristleburst, Inquisitive Pyromaniac</h3> 
               <p>Gristleburst grew up among the Gullcracker goblins outside of Otari, but he was always a loner. His irrepressible curiosity and keen mind for chemistry earned him few friends among the goblins, even though his firebombs were always a source of good fun. When the Gullcrackers were killed and reanimated as zombies, Gristleburst took on the lonely, sad task of putting down each one of his former kin. He now wanders the world as an alchemist-for-hire, just as eager to investigate unusual mysteries as he is to set things ablaze.</p> 
               <p>Gristleburst is an unreliable ally. He’s quick to make friends—particularly because he’s otherwise all alone in the world—but he frequently pursues his own ideals without consulting his allies and hurls his bombs with reckless glee.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3e5c6ada-6ed4-47da-b05d-f218e2831057/070921_Gristleburst.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3e5c6ada-6ed4-47da-b05d-f218e2831057/070921_Gristleburst.png" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="a goggle-wearing goblin has scraps of paper stuck to his leather armor, and wields a bomb with lit fuse in one hand"></a>

               <p><b>Quick Bomber</b> [one-action] Gristleburst draws an alchemical bomb with an Interact action and throws it as a ranged Strike.</p> 
               <p><b> Quick Smoke Bomb</b> [free-action] <b>Cost</b> 1 batch of infused reagents; <b>Effect</b> Gristleburst mixes up a short-lived lesser acid flask or lesser alchemist’s fire without attempting a Crafting check. It remains potent only until the end of his next turn. When he throws this bomb, in addition to its normal effects, it creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot radius burst. Creatures in that area have the concealed condition, and other creatures are concealed to them. This smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.</p> 
               <br> 
               <p><b>Plot Hooks</b></p> 
               <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Gristleburst into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>When the heroes are following a treasure map through a dangerous wilderness, Gristleburst agrees to show them a safe path in exchange for a share of the loot. </li> 
                <li>The heroes are hunting an arsonist, and Gristleburst can help identify blast patterns and accelerants the arsonist used to set the blaze. </li> 
                <li>Gristleburst’s reckless alchemy inadvertently sets a stand of trees or a building on fire, and he needs urgent help to put the fire out before it spreads. </li> 
               </ul>

              <blockquote> 
               <p itemprop="description">From low atmospheric orbit, the crashed starship could have easily been mistaken for some great beast, slain in the heat of battle. Its trajectory had cut a fiery and destructive swathe through thick jungle, and here and there small bits of flame still licked at the foliage, the steaming soil smoldering from the heat of the starship’s unexpected collision, ending at its broken corpse. The hull had been nearly rent in two upon impact, and shorn wiring, ducting, loose crates, and coolant spilled from within like mechanical viscera.</p> 
               <p>As the day bled into twilight, from within the darkness of the starship’s carcass, a life pod beeped rapidly. Kasa took a pained gasp as she regained consciousness. She moved stiffly, feeling the distant ache of what might have been a grievous injury. The life pod had flooded her system with medical stabilizers, a failsafe to ensure functionality in the event of a crash. As Kasa’s mental defenses churned into place, laced with the glittering edge of the medical stimulant’s side-effects, she knew somehow that things couldn’t possibly get much worse.</p> 
               <p>For a while, she lay in the coffin-snug pod that had saved her life, her breath loud and metallic, her ears straining to hear anything beyond from the stillness of her tight confinement. Wherever the ship had made planetfall, she was likely safest in the life pod for the time being. Kasa’s mind raced. Her eyes grew bleary with the threat of tears as panic took hold in the illogical part of her brain. She blinked them away, taking a deep breath and slowly counting objects within her view, a tool she adopted long ago to help regain her composure when stressed. She was a scientist, first and foremost, and that meant shedding fear of the unknown by making it known.</p> 
               <p>With a grunt, Kasa found the panel along the wall near her thigh, fingertips gliding over the interface to release the magnetic locks. The life pod’s lid slid aside with a hiss, and she gingerly hauled herself over the lip and waited for her vision to adjust to the darkness of the life support chamber. Blinking as shapes came into sharper focus, the shadows slowly brightening to shades of illuminated gray, Kasa made her way aft, stealing glances at the other life pods, all empty or crushed, she noted with dismay.</p> 
               <p>As a scientist, she hadn’t been needed on the bridge and thus had no idea where in the universe they—no, it was only <em>she</em> who remained—could be. She knew, as the silence of isolation stretched ever onward during her tentative search, that anybody who could answer such a question had been killed in the impact. What magic or science could divine her location and see to her rescue was lost for now. Perhaps even for good.</p> 
               <p>It took her the better part of an hour to dig through the med-bay, salvaging what stimulant packs she could find. The armory had survived the crash, as had its door, which remained barred to her without proper authorization. Kasa stared at the flickering interface, which flashed warnings and reported on various system malfunctions that could be distilled into a single message: without brute force or proper authorization overrides, she would find no weapons here.</p> 
               <p>That first night under alien stars, she was fitful and skittish. Several times she nodded off, until fear exhausted her and she shut her eyes out of necessity.</p> 
               <p>Dawn came on suddenly, and Kasa was reminded that this world, its atmosphere, its sun—or suns—were all variables in the new problem that unfolded before her. She blinked wearily as her dry, exhausted eyes pricked in the alien air. With a grunt, she unfurled herself from her crouch, stretching and shouldering her pack. If the shuttle bay was intact, there was bound to be something working. She rationalized that it had to be so; no circumstances could be so dire, after all. Unfortunately, her path to the shuttle bay was too obstructed for her to climb through, and she realized she would finally have to go outside and see if another path presented itself. She backtracked but found that the only way out would be up, through the ship’s now-open overhead. Beyond, she could only see the forest canopy, still but for the occasional rustle of leaves, the cries of unfamiliar fauna.</p> 
               <p>Grimly, Kasa began her ascent, using the ship’s exposed wiring to haul herself up and onto the outer hull. It was a great effort, and had any been there to witness her summit, they would have found her sprawled across the sun-warmed hull, catching her breath before she finally sitting up to look around.</p> 
               <p>All around her was dense, writhing jungle: trees as tall as towers, with thick, obdurate vines crawling possessively around their trunks and boasting vivid blossoms with pollen-rich stamen. Try as she might to place the flora around her, nothing in the catalogue of her mind recalled even the slightest comfort of familiarity. She shielded her eyes against the harsh glare of the sunlight that beat through the treetops and discerned, just barely visible through the overgrowth, a trail. It may have been abandoned, but a trail meant this place was once inhabited, and that would suffice.</p> 
               <p>Fear of the unknown gave way to Kasa’s inherent curiosity, and she picked a path along the curve of the ship’s hull toward the shuttle bay. Much of the vessel had broken apart in the crash, and she made short work of climbing down into the massive bay. The collapsed half of the starboard bulkhead had taken all but one of the three Explorer vehicles with it, but the remaining Explorer sat almost pristine, save for a single crack along the window shielding. Kasa let herself smile at the first good news she’d had since waking up.</p>

               <p>Kasa ripped through the jungle in the Explorer for hours, following the ancient overgrown path. She took her time, checking for signs of intelligent life, and for a while she thought all she would find would be jungle. But then the path opened into a wider avenue; not quite paved, but clearly marked by the deliberate imprint of civilization. She brought the Explorer to a halt, peering through the windows to see jungle give way to more deliberate architecture. This ruin, though empty of all life, was the surest sign of someone having lived here. Kasa popped the hatch and climbed out of the vehicle to have a look around.</p> 
               <p>Whatever else this was, it was a discovery—one that none but the forgotten ghosts of those who once called this place home would bear witness. Kasa lamented not being able to salvage her research equipment as she stood in the clearing, taking in the moss-draped, domed towers like ancient mushrooms and arched doorways that stood like portals to another world, waiting to be opened. Though the ruin had collapsed around them, surrendering to the jungle, these remained, all seemingly built for beings much larger than she.</p> 
               <p>“Giants?” She wondered incredulously, her first word in hours, voice dry and reedy from disuse. She turned a slow circuit, once again frowning at her inability to recognize any of the architecture, its design at once ancient but still entirely too alien for her to get even an echo of familiarity from it. Something about the jungle here was quieter, as if the order once imposed upon it still lingered, beating back all save the hapless moss that crawled along the ancient stone. She soon saw why.</p> 
               <p>The thing—the <em>monolith</em>—was massive, jutting from the ground like a spear, and indeed was so anachronistic in comparison to its surroundings that Kasa wondered how it wasn’t the first thing she noticed. It was metal of some kind, she could tell from first glance, emanating soft blue light from the markings along its surface. Unlike the rest of the structures, it didn’t seem to warp to the ruinous touch of time, and the vines of the jungle barely forayed onto its massive base, as if the jungle itself were hesitant to claim the invasive structure. Kasa craned her neck to peer upward. Its length seemed to vanish beyond the forest canopy, bathing her in its light.</p> 
               <p>Tentatively, she raised a hand, reaching out toward it. Perhaps it was an interface, albeit an ancient one. There could be no harm in a simple touch.</p> 
               <p>There was a sudden rustle, and bursting from the copse of trees beyond the ruin came several avian-simian creatures, taking wing in unison. Fleeing.</p> 
               <p>Kasa took one more glance at the monolith, rummaging in her pack for a datapad she’d salvaged from the wreckage. The device flashed cheerful yellow warnings that there was no communications node available for outside access, but she could still use the local capabilities. She did her best to scan and document the relic before her, sweat prickling the nape of her neck as she began to realize that she was no longer alone in the ruins, and that whoever—or whatever—had sent the creatures into startled flight would be upon her soon.</p> 
               <p>She turned, backing up to the monolith, the security of its solidity offering her the only comfort and protection she could find in this alien world. With her head against it, she could hear it thrumming—a faint, rhythmic buzzing that seemed to come from deep underground, wherever the spire’s roots held it firm to the jungle floor. Beyond that sound, Kasa heard and saw nothing. The alien creatures had fled, leaving her alone with the monolith.</p> 
               <p>As suddenly as lightning, the thrumming stopped, and in its place—in her mind—Kasa heard, <em>felt</em>, a high-pitched shriek. There were words in the cry, or the feeling, the meaning, behind words.</p> 
               <p>“<em>Help us</em>,” they pled. “<em>Help us, Kasa! Free us…before it returns</em>.”</p>

               <p>Don’t miss the introduction on this book! Written by the stellar Jabari Weathers, you may have seen snippets from this section floating around Twitter and other wilds of the internet. This section offers prompts to consider when building your character—whether you’re a visitor to the Expanse or were born and raised there—as well as advice on how to venture into the setting respectfully if you’re not sure how to approach it. After that we delve into the major social aspects of Mwangi: the history of the land, the people who live in it, and the gods who hold heavy influence over the region.</p> 
               <p>The Expanse is still a world of adventure, however, and as we move into more specifics, we get into the geography of the region. We’ll trek across mountains, savannahs, and jungles of the Mwangi before finally reaching nine of the region’s greatest nations and cities. Risk pirate havens, explore mysterious cities with dangerous histories, catch fish in the Hurricane Harvest when the tides rush through the streets, or try to find a legendary paradise in the mortal realms! But beware, the final pages of this book contain a bestiary of monsters that lurk, waiting for adventurers to blunder into their lairs!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3cb78374-4780-4f9a-88c3-a407b93cc388/20210707-paulus.png"><img width="300" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3cb78374-4780-4f9a-88c3-a407b93cc388/20210707-paulus.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt=": A half-elf woman dressed like a researcher.

               <h3>COVID Sucks</h3> 
               <p>About two months before the final drafts for the Mwangi Expanse were due, the COVID shutdown hit the United States in full force. As you can imagine, it wreaked havoc with book production.</p> 
               <p>I was one of the luckiest ones. I kept my job, my immediate family was safe, and Paizo gracefully pivoted to work from home. Completing the book was still an unmitigated nightmare, one that caused multiple sleepless nights and minor mental breakdowns over the course of the year. For many of the freelancers on the project, it meant sudden financial insecurity, unexpected full-time childcare, family emergencies or deaths, and even worse. The government response at the time was deliberately inadequate and--yes, I will say it--racist, and was combined with the absolute despair of the constant police brutality that was highlighted during this time.</p> 
               <p>I’m not saying this to invoke pity, encourage token platitudes, or glorify the heroic effort the authors went through to get this book done--even those who had to bow out in the end. It was heroic, but what happened shouldn’t be glorified. I’m saying that so when everyone sees the final product, they understand just how incredible the people who worked on it are.</p> 
               <br clear="all"> 
               <h3>We Messed Up</h3> 
               <p>No matter how much time and effort we put into developing and editing a book, something wrong always manages to slip through. Some are annoying but mild, like spelling “uncommon” wrong a dozen times in a row. Some are just funny, like the sarcesian in First Contact that dealt 1d810+5 damage with a sniper rifle. And some we can only stare and ask, “how the <censored>
                  did we miss that??”
                </censored></p> 
               <p>Mwangi has one of those <censored>
                  moments.
                </censored></p> 
               <p>We fixed the errors in the PDF versions but didn’t spot them in time to alter the printed books. Gripplis have the wrong ancestry bonuses in the printed copies. As a result, they lack the correct ability score boosts (Dexterity, Wisdom, and a Free boost, plus their Strength penalty). The ancestry also has a line noting “others probably assume [gripplis] are savage, simple-minded, or both.” It was meant as a note that such assumptions were flawed but didn’t convey enough context to be appropriate in any sense. Moreover, that language specifically violates our own guidelines on how we talk about people. Our developers and editors know to remove those words on sight to avoid situations like this. However, due to a process issue, this was flagged during production but not actually removed. We’ve instituted new procedures to prevent words like this from ever making it to print.</p> 
               <p>We’re sorry and will continue trying to do better.</p>

Find guidance on how to fill your roles as administrators, overseers, and managers of a slice of New Harmony, with all the responsibilities those roles entail. You can also find character options like The People’s Champion feat which enables you to draw confidence and dedication from the sheer number of people who depend on you.

Perhaps you descend from—or were infected by—a lycanthrope or similar creature, were subjected to the rituals of a beastly fiend, or performed ancestral trials to pledge yourself to a beast spirit. Whatever the source, you fight and hunt like a wild thing, and you know the natural sides of most worlds like you were born upon them. </p>

               <p itemprop="description">Our latest book, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot/discuss?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse">Pathfinder Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse</a> is already trickling into the hands of our subscribers ahead of its upcoming release! With it comes new ancestries, deities, and a ton of lore to inspire characters, both native to the Expanse and visiting from other regions of the Inner Sea. We’ve talked a bit about how to adventure when your character comes from another region of Golarion, such as Absalom or Varisia, so today, we wanted to highlight building a character from the Mwangi Expanse. One of the authors for this book, Jabari Weathers, wrote some great guidance for this in the introduction of the book, as well as some questions to help you dig into your character’s connection with their home and what kind of adventures that might spark. </p> 
               <p>Today, let's go through these questions as we build a character of our own! Meet Bolani, an elementalist (upcoming in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic">Secrets of Magic!</a>) from the Mwangi Expanse. </p> 
               <p>Our first prompt: “What has your home taught you?” Having a character’s home be central to their personality, challenges, or worldview can be a good way to delve into a new concept. </p> 
               <p><em>Though the Mwangi Expanse hosts countless cultures and many powerful civilizations, the vastness and abundance of the land is an undeniable facet of everyday life. The mighty fortress of Senghor plies the sea for netfuls of fish, while the trade city of Kibwe hauls up tons of ores from the earth to fill its marketplaces. Experiencing the turning of the seasons, from the fires and droughts of the savannah to the monsoons of the rainy season, has taught Bolani the true power of the natural world. Humanity can attempt to harness or control the elements, but in the end, such measures will always fail—it is far better to learn the power of each element and adapt to them.</em></p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/64492099-cc69-4bc7-a0a5-5c20c68da27b/070221_bolani.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/64492099-cc69-4bc7-a0a5-5c20c68da27b/070221_bolani.png" align="left" width="350" style="Bolani, a woman wearing a dark outfit with a blue scarf and elegant red cloak"></a>
               <p style="font-size: 13px;">Art by Klaher Baklaher</p> 
               <p>Our second prompt: “What remains mysterious to you about home?” I’m sure that none of us knows every last fact about our hometowns, neighborhoods, or countries—there’s always room for one more unknown fact to discover or a bit of history to unearth. When a character has questions that they’re trying to get answered, that can give a personal angle to their adventures, and Pathfinder is about adventure, after all! </p> 
               <p><em>Bolani mastered many skills in pursuit of elemental mastery, not the least of which is geology. She brags that she can determine where she is in the Mwangi Expanse simply by feeling the rocks through her toes. Yet a few times over her career, she has encountered pieces of stone that elude her understanding—statues that do not seem to belong on this continent, tiny chips that seem to be literally beyond this world. Could these be relics of the Azlani, who ventured into the Expanse to defeat the serpentfolk god Ydersius and then seemingly departed without settling? Might these be related to the Doorway to the Red Star, which has fallen into disuse and mystery since the days of Old-Mage Jatembe? Or might these be crumbling remains from the Abyss itself, trod into the soil of Mwangi by the hooves of a demonic army that even now still lingers?</em></p> 
               <p>Lastly: “What are you protective of?” This can be something immediate, like a family member, but it can also be something a bit larger. What kind of changes scare your character most, and why? Is there something that they are working to preserve or even change about their culture or home? Figuring out what your character wants to protect can be a good way to give them direct ties and make their home feel lived in. </p> 
               <p><em>When Bolani was young, she could speak to the plants and elements of her home and hear them clearly in response. Now that she is older, she has found that these conversations harder for her to accomplish, and often become garbled or strained messages. She does not know if this is due to some change in her own self or if something terrible is happening to her home, beneath everyone’s notice—no one else she has spoken to has reported such a problem, which leaves Bolani uncertain and troubled. Whatever the cause, her connection to her childhood home is precious to her, and Bolani wishes to reestablish the connection and determine what went wrong to prevent it from occurring again.</em></p> 
               <p>Bolani is just one character, and there’s a whole Expanse to explore! Tell us about what kind of characters you’re planning to create, and how they might feel about their homes!</p>

               <h3>Red Waves Aflame — Moderate 15</h3> 
               <p itemprop="description">The city of Bloodcove, on the western coast of the Mwangi Expanse, is one of the region’s major port cities, a veritable melting pot where a merchant can find any item they’re looking for, a traveler can find any dish to fill their belly, and an outlaw can find any number of places to lay low. While it’s named for the crimson waters that flow between its giant mangroves and reflect the burning sunset, the city is also a chaotic one. Pirate captains and cutthroat merchants vie for control and brawls are tolerated as long as they don’t cause to much disturbance, providing another possible interpretation of its name.</p> 
               <p>Lately, several of the fishers in one of the city’s docks, as well as nearby restaurant owners, reported receiving threatening messages demanding a share of their catch and profits in an obvious protection racket. Though such a thing is hardly unknown in Bloodcove, the growing presence of some local Firebrands has empowered the dock workers to resist the scheme, and they’ve even managed to drive off a few pirates come to collect. The last such tussle ended with the pirates threatening that their leader was going to send “a collector” next time, and the merchants worry that things are getting beyond their ability to handle.</p> 
               <p>The adventurers have been called to the docks to make sure everything’s well. After a few minutes, the “collector” surfaces in the bay. A maliadi—a hippo-like beast as greedy as it is massive, known for taking tribute from those it considers its lessers—emerges from the water and begins to rampage. The adventurers must stop the creature before it can make its way deeper into the inland markets, and maybe find out who sent it there in the first place!</p> 
               <p><b>Creature</b> The maliadi remains in the water initially, attacking from range using fire magic like <em>produce flame</em> and, if necessary, <em>volcanic eruption</em>, relying on its collar of fire to stymie incoming attacks and attempting to separate PCs from each other using its wall spells. If targeted by magic, it uses its Counterspelling Wall and then, seeing this as a challenge to its dominance, charges down the spellcaster who would be so presumptuous as to use magic against it and attempts to Swallow them Whole. When reduced to 30 Hit Points, the maliadi tries to flee by turning itself into a river; if caught after this point, it recognizes its defeat and is willing to give up the names of those who called it here, possibly leading the PCs to their next encounter in Bloodcove.</p> 
               <p><b>Rickety Docks</b> The docks here are all either old, floating, precariously built over mangrove roots, or a combination of all three, and in any event were hardly made to withstand a rampaging Gargantuan hippopotamus. The maliadi can Capsize the docks as if they were boats of Huge size. </p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3e51327b-e54c-4881-a740-737eb86d99b4/070221_bestiaryintro.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3e51327b-e54c-4881-a740-737eb86d99b4/070221_bestiaryintro.jpg" align="left" width="50%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A large hippo-like creature rampages through a crowded street, breaking buildings as it moves.

               <p><b>Map</b> This map is constructed using Flip-Tiles from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uq">Pathfinder Flip-Tiles: Urban Waterfront Expansion</a>. To create the map, lay out each Flips-Tile so that the label in the lower-left corner matches the orientation on the map below—for example, rotate this piece marked 21A so that the label is in the upper left. You can place these tiles over a blank mat or place them over an aquatic map such as <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvs">Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Basic Terrain Multi-Pack</a>. While the water in the Flip-Tiles is normally blue in color, we’ve altered the tiles below slightly to more closely resemble Bloodcove’s signature red waves.</p>

               <h2>Title Changes</h2> 
               <p>We’ve been shuffling around some job titles and responsibilities on the Organized Play development team over the last few weeks to account for the transfer of the Pathfinder and Starfinder One-Shots product lines to this team. To reflect this shift, we’re going to start calling the team the “Digital Adventures Team,” rather than a title more closely associated with our OP programs, as their creative remit now covers items that aren’t directly related to our Organized Play campaigns. (They'll still handle those products as well, just alongside these new items on their docket.)</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Linda Zayas-Palmer is now the Development Manager (Digital Adventures) and manages the Digital Adventures Team, of which the “Organized Play Team” is a subset.</li> 
                <li>Thurston Hillman is now titled Developer (Digital Adventures), and will be focusing on Paizo’s One-Shots, Bounties, and Society Interactives.</li> 
                <li>Jenny Jarzabski is the Starfinder Society Developer, and Mike Kimmel is the Pathfinder Society Developer, though both share the official title of Organized Play Line Developer. Jenny and Mike are running the day-to-day development of Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society, respectively.</li> 
               </ul> 
               <p>Most of this is just bringing job titles in line with the developers’ day-to-day duties, but we wanted to announce them in case anybody noticed the changes in the masthead of new scenarios.</p> 
               <h2>Starfinder Society Year 4</h2> 
               <p>We’ve got a couple points of clarification with information we’ve released about Starfinder Society Year 4. In addition, we wanted to post an update that we’re currently working on compiling the common questions about the shift away from Fame and will have answers to some of the outstanding issues and boons prior to the Fame spending deadline. </p> 
               <h4><em>Table Size</em></h4> 
               <p>It was brought to our attention that there was an additional rule change with Year 4 of Starfinder Society that didn’t get the spotlight it should’ve. As of the beginning of Year 4, <a href="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Player-Basics#Legal_Table_Size">the maximum player count for a table is <b>six players</b></a>. Seven-player tables are no longer permitted. We didn’t intend to sneak this change by anybody, we just forgot to announce it with the rest of the changes! </p> 
               <h4><em>New Ships</em></h4> We have one final piece of business to attend to with our new year of Starfinder Society, and that’s the Azata! This brand new ship is available to all players, and its statistics are now available <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Starships">in the Starfinder Society Guide</a>.

               <h2>Pathfinder Society Year 3</h2> 
               <p>Last month, we announced the title for Pathfinder Society <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpa">Year 3: the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a>. We’re excited for you all to experience this new storyline; from what I’ve read so far, it’ll be a great year for veteran and brand-new players alike. One of the highlights for new players is the three-part introduction arc we talked about in the Paizo Intro Blog last Thursday. Mike Kimmel did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOOklXtBOsw">an interview with the Danger Club Podcast</a>—go check it out for some more teasers, and stay tuned to the blog for more news!</p> 
               <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
               <p>The big headline for this month’s sanctioning update is for our First Edition players! We’re pleased to announce that updated versions of the PFS (first edition) <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/additional">Additional Resources</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/clarifications">Campaign Clarifications</a> have been released and take effect immediately. We anticipate that this will be the final version of these documents, barring any major issues. We’re still working on sanctioning documents for the final Adventure Paths, but their rules options are all factored into this update. </p> 
               <p>I don’t have as much to report for our active programs this month. For Pathfinder Society, sanctioning documents for the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix"><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em> Adventure Path</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024xn"><em>Malevolence</em></a> are both ready to go live when the books are released on July 7th. Next on the list for PFS is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em></a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands</em> Adventure Path</a>. For Starfinder Society, I’m pleased to announce that the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a> has been updated to include the options in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zu?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Galaxy Exploration Manual</a>. We weren’t able to get Fly Free or Die or Devastation Ark’s character options out this month, but we’re working on those as our next priority.</p> 
               <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
               <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
               <p>This month, we have several GMs to recognize!</p> 
               <p><b>5th Star</b>: Filipp Kovalev, Lindsey Long<br> <b>5th Nova</b>: Michael Beck, James Carter, Rebecca Fehn</p> 
               <p>Congratulations to our GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
               <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
               <p>Remember that you can use the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">new Conventions calendar</a> to check out all the upcoming conventions with a Paizo Organized Play presence! I also wanted to republish the information for all our major shows here so it’s all in one place.</p>
