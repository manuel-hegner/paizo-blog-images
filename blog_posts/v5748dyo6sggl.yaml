  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to 4719, Pathfinders! We in\
  \ the Paizo word mines are hard at work putting together a huge slate of new products\
  \ for the year but that doesn't mean that I can't take a few minutes to show off\
  \ some of the new figures coming out this April in the next set of Pathfinder Battles\
  \ prepainted plastic miniatures from our partners at WizKids.</p> \n    <p>The <em>Ruins\
  \ of Lastwall</em> set features lots of figures useful in playing out the conflict\
  \ between the knights of Lastwall and the forces of the lich lord known as the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant. For nearly 900 years the stalwart Knights of Ozem have stood watch over\
  \ the lich's prison from their fortified capital of Vigil, the last remnant of the\
  \ forces of good whose victory in the Shining Crusade saved the world from the tyrant's\
  \ grasp. And now players and GMs will have all the figures they need to amass their\
  \ own army of paladins, knights, and regimented soldiers of light.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190115-HalfPage.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Craig J. Spearing</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The\
  \ first two figures were drawn from the same inspiring piece of art from the Pathfinder\
  \ library, this stunning half-page illustration of Lastwall's forces preparing for\
  \ battle by Craig J. Spearing. In the foreground, we have the Lastwall Soldier,\
  \ a rank-and-file soldier in the crusader army. Wearing a simple cloak of the purest\
  \ white, emblazoned with the holy symbol of Iomedae, this Medium common figure is\
  \ one you'll be glad to have multiples of.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190115-LastwallSoldier_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>Towering over the soldiers is the Lastwall General atop his\
  \ rearing charger. His polished gold plate and raised standard serve as inspiration\
  \ to his subordinates and paint an intimidating picture for the forces of undeath\
  \ rallied against them. A Large uncommon figure, the Lastwall General can also serve\
  \ as a PC cavalier or paladin when mounted.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190115-LastwallGeneral_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>I showed off the Lastwall Knight (Medium uncommon) back in\
  \ September when the set was announced, but she's not the only elite figure in the\
  \ set. Check out the Lastwall Paladin with his banner and longsword issuing a challenge\
  \ to the forces of evil. He's a Medium uncommon figure, so collectors should end\
  \ up with a few of him to add variety to their Lastwall army or to serve as PCs,\
  \ cohorts, or prominent NPCs from the ranks of the Knights of Ozem.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190115-LastwallPaladin_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>When these noble warriors fall in battle, they deserve a\
  \ fitting final rest. In the catacombs of Vigil lie the remains of countless paladins\
  \ and soldiers who dedicated themselves to keeping the Whispering Tyrant contained\
  \ in his prison. The Crypt Wall set dressing depicts one of these catacomb niches,\
  \ complete with four removable shelves and three decaying corpses so you can customize\
  \ your use of it.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190115-CryptWall_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>The Knights of Lastwall don't stand alone against the forces\
  \ of evil, though. No, the Great Beytond is full of powerful beings who want to\
  \ see the Whispering Tyrant's forces turned back from their ambitions of conquest.\
  \ Among them are the noble gold dragons who call Golarion's plains home. The Large\
  \ Gold Dragon here (Large uncommon) is just one of the mortal beings who may come\
  \ to the knights' aid (or serve as wise advisors or “quest-givers” for PCs).</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190115-GoldDragon_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>From beyond the borders of our realities, the celestial hosts\
  \ of the upper planes may be summoned or called by powerful clerics or arcane spellcasters,\
  \ the most formidable of which is the Empyrean Angel. First appearing in Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 5 and coming in at a whopping CR 20, this Large rare figure is sure\
  \ to awe all who see it when it appears on the battlefield.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190115-EmpyreanAngel_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>No celestial force is more interested in the outcome of the\
  \ long war with the Whispering Tyrant than the goddess, Iomedae, who was herself\
  \ a knight of Ozem before ascending to godhood. The first of five gods making their\
  \ Pathfinder Battles debut in this set, Iomedae, Goddess of Valor is a Medium rare\
  \ figure, perfect for GMs running the Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path or for\
  \ players of paladins or clerics of the goddess who might attempt to emulate her\
  \ appearance beyond simply wearing her holy symbol.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190115-Iomedae_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>That's it for this preview, but it's far from the last you'll\
  \ see of Lastwall. Check back next time for a look at the agents of undeath working\
  \ to undermine the knights' efforts and spread their cold, evil will across the\
  \ Inner Sea region.</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Franchise Manager</i></p>\
