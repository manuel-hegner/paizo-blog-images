  \ <a href=\"http://freerpgday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Free RPG Day</a> is Saturday,\
  \ June 20, and the card game team has whipped up something special for those of\
  \ you who like free stuff. Introducing... Ekkie!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Ekkie, like her compatriot <a href=\"/products/btpy96ie\"\
  >Ranzak</a>, likes to eat, stab, and steal, not necessarily in that order. She comes\
  \ with a character card, a token card, and a role card, and she can be played with\
  \ any Adventure Card Game Base Set.</p> \n    <p>Ekkie will initially be available\
  \ at stores participating in Free RPG Day on June 20. We'll be sending her free\
  \ to <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6n\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game subscribers</a>\
  \ with their July shipment, and she'll also be available for sale at Paizo's Gen\
  \ Con booth and at paizo.com starting July 30.</p> \n    <p>Before you ask: We're\
  \ still testing her to see if she'll be usable in <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Adventure Card Guild</a> organized play. If she's allowed to join the\
  \ party, you'll probably be playing her with the Fighter Class Deck or Ranger Class\
  \ Deck. But first, meet Ekkie in her own words:</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Hello, Longshanks Hearing Ekkie's\
  \ Words through Glowing Box! I first meet friendly longshanks in town named <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8r0e\">Magnimar</a>. Ekkie was just trying to make ends meet, put\
  \ food in mouth and roof on head, so Ekkie joined fearsome goblin guild named Nightsoil\
  \ Marauders. Is good, scary name: Nightsoil Marauders!</p> \n     <p>Anyway, Ekkie\
  \ was sneaking through a longshank house filled with shinies and foods, taking things\
  \ for the guild and for Ekkie, when the mangiest, barkiest, poodliest of dogmeats\
  \ sneaks up on me and starts barking. \"Bark!\" it says. \"Bark bark bark! Bark\
  \ bark bark!\" Always alerting the sleeping longshanks. Poodles are the WORST. And\
  \ poodles don't even taste good, mostly because the curly hairs get stuck between\
  \ goblin teeth.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n      <img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150217-Pudl.jpg\"\
  > \n      <p><i>THE WORST!</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Stupid poodle will not\
  \ shut up, so longshanks come and chase me up and down and all around the town.\
  \ That part is fun, but eventually they catch up to me and want all this talking\
  \ and doing and not stealing and not eating. Nightsoil Marauders are—what is longshanks\
  \ words again?—\"unfortunate casualties,\" so Ekkie is alone again. But longshanks?\
  \ Longshanks are \"noble adventurers,\" which means sneaking and stabbing and eating,\
  \ but with getting paid afterward. Seems like a good gig to Ekkie. So now, Ekkie\
  \ is an adventurer!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Tanis O'Connor<br> <i>Adventure\
