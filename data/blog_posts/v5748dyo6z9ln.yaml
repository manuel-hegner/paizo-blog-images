  \ and played through an adventure. What do you get from it? What wonderful treasures\
  \ will your characters earn along the way? That’s the topic of today’s blog, the\
  \ fourth in our Starfinder Society rollout!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \      <h1>Chronicle Sheets</h1>\n      <p>After completing an adventure, you’ll\
  \ receive a <strong>Chronicle Sheet</strong>, either physically or digitally. Your\
  \ Chronicle Sheet will contain a summary of the adventure you just completed, along\
  \ with the following rewards:</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Experience (XP)</strong>:\
  \ What your character needs to level up! Each Starfinder Society Scenario awards\
  \ <strong>4 XP</strong>. Every time you earn <strong>12 XP</strong>, your character\
  \ levels up!</li>\n       <li><strong>Credits</strong>: In the Starfinder universe,\
  \ credits are exchanged for goods and services. Your character will earn the same\
  \ number of credits for every scenario, based on their level. This represents the\
  \ Starfinder Society paying you for your efforts. Your character also gets to keep\
  \ any treasure they find along the way. A first-level character will earn <strong>140\
  \ credits</strong> for the successful completion of a scenario, and a second-level\
  \ character will earn <strong>220 credits</strong>. A full table for all character\
  \ levels will be made available in the Guide to Organized Play upon release.</li>\n\
  \       <li><strong>Downtime</strong>: Starfinder Society characters earn eight\
  \ days of Downtime after completing an adventure. This can be used for any Downtime\
  \ activity in the rules, including Earning Income, Retraining, or Crafting.</li>\n\
  \       <li><strong>New Character Options</strong>: Each Starfinder Society scenario\
  \ will award your characters new bespoke content tailored to the adventure! This\
  \ could be anything: a new feat you can take to represent your time in the wilds,\
  \ a magic or tech item gifted to you by a NPC, or anything else our authors and\
  \ developers can dream up.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <br>\n      <h1>Achievement\
  \ Points</h1>\n      <p>Upon completion of an adventure, you (the player) will <em>also</em>\
  \ earn Achievement Points (AcP). This is a meta-currency that is tracked on our\
  \ website after an adventure is reported. For each scenario, players will earn 4\
  \ Achievement Points, and GMs will earn 8. Playing or running games at supported\
  \ events such as conventions or your local game store may also apply a multiplier\
  \ to these points, allowing you to unlock rewards even faster.</p>\n      <p>Achievement\
  \ Points are spent in our online boon store on new rewards and options. Some of\
  \ the rewards will include:</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Legacy Ancestries</strong>:\
  \ <em>Starfinder Player Core</em> and <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy Guide</em> contain\
  \ a whole host of alien ancestries, but we know many of you want to venture into\
  \ space as an elf, dwarf, or other classic fantasy ancestry. At launch, some of\
  \ these ancestries will be available in the Boon Store for just 8 Achievement Points,\
  \ which means that GMing just one session lets you blast off as a space goblin!</li>\n\
  \       <li><strong>Condition Removal</strong>: Get hit with a nasty curse? Did\
  \ an akata implant eggs in your character’s stomach, or did you die in the final\
  \ boss fight? Achievement Points can be used to remove negative conditions after\
  \ an adventure and even bring your character back to life!</li>\n       <li><strong>Pathfinder\
  \ Options</strong>: Versatile heritages, archetypes, and even classes will be made\
  \ available over time through the use of Achievement Points. Your solar kineticist\
  \ is just a few GM sessions away from your grasp!</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>We’\
  re always looking for new ways to let you spend your Achievement Points. If there’\
  s something you want, whether it’s a specific option or a whole category of possible\
  \ rewards, let us know. We just might make it happen!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ from Previous Programs</h1>\n      <p>Those of you who have been with Organized\
  \ Play for a while will notice a couple of conspicuous absences. We wanted to address\
  \ those upfront and explain why we’ve made the decision not to include them.</p>\n\
  \      <p>First, Starfinder Society (Second Edition) does not have factions. You’\
  re a Starfinder, and that’s it—you’re not a member of some secondary subgroup as\
  \ well. For years, factions have existed as a vestige of old systems, and at the\
  \ current time, the Starfinder team is more interested in telling the story of the\
  \ Society as a unified group rather than as a collection of special interests in\
  \ a holo-trenchcoat. Removing them also eliminates another Organized Play-specific\
  \ element that new players have to learn about.</p>\n      <p>Additionally, Starfinder\
  \ Society will not have a GM ranking system akin to the previous system of stars,\
  \ glyphs, or novas at launch. This <em>will</em> return at a future date in some\
  \ form, though not necessarily the one you may be used to. We do want to make sure\
  \ we’re rewarding our dedicated GMs and recognizing those who go above and beyond\
  \ for the program. However, what we don’t want to even tacitly encourage is the\
  \ practice of rushing to that top rank and being one of the first GMs with the highest\
  \ recognition. We’ve seen too many GMs in Pathfinder Society burn themselves out\
  \ and drop shortly after achieving this goal, and the easiest way to prevent it,\
  \ in our minds, is simply not to put it in front of you until a later date.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Also, to be honest, I’m just not sure what to call this new rank. Rings?\
  \ Comets? Moons? Donuts? Naming things is hard, so I’m procrastinating.</p>\n  \
  \    <br>\n      <h1>Retail Incentive Program</h1>\n      <p>Now more than ever,\
  \ it’s critical to support the game stores and venues who host our games. Starfinder\
  \ Society (Second Edition) will feature a Retail Incentive Program (RIP) just like\
  \ previous editions. This program will provide characters with additional durability\
  \ and healing based on the amount of money the table has spent at the venue during\
  \ the session. About to lose your final hitpoint? A last-minute dice purchase might\
  \ just give you the tools you need to survive!</p>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n \

  \      <h1>Player’s Guide</h1>\n      <p>You know how our Adventure Paths have a\
  \ free Player’s Guide, available for download here on paizo.com? They’re great;\
  \ they have primers on the campaign, recommendations for what to play, and even\
  \ campaign-specific content like new backgrounds. Those are neat! We decided we\
  \ wanted one, so we’re doing it.</p>\n      <p>Prior to the season launch (likely\
  \ in July), we’ll be publishing the first Starfinder Society Player’s Guide. Contained\
  \ within will be everything you need to get started with Starfinder Society, including:</p>\n\
  \      <ul>\n       <li>An overview of the campaign rules and a brief history of\
  \ the Starfinder Society</li>\n       <li>Exclusive backgrounds, written just for\
  \ Starfinder Society’s first story arc</li>\n       <li>Playtest backgrounds, available\
  \ exclusively to players who participated in the Starfinder Playtest adventures</li>\n\
  \       <li>Two new ancestries, hot off the presses and immediately (and always)\
  \ available for use in Starfinder Society!</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>This will\
  \ be a free PDF download here on paizo.com. We’ll also have printed copies available\
  \ at Gen Con for all attendees. This will not replace the full Guide to Organized\
  \ Play on the Lorespire Wiki, which contains the full rules and regulations for\
  \ the program. Rather, it is intended to be a primer for new and experienced players\
  \ alike. We hope this will help bring new players into the fold and provide everyone\
  \ with exciting new options for the campaign.</p>\n      <p>Tune in next week for\
  \ our final rollout blog, where Jessica will announce our first Starfinder Society\
  \ storyline for Second Edition! I can’t wait to discover the mysteries of—oops,\
