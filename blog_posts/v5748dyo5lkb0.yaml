  ><em>Pathfinder Pawns: Traps &amp; Treasures Pawn Collection</em></a> is here! Since\
  \ this is the most experimental Pawn Collection we've done so far, I figured the\
  \ best way to communicate what makes up this set is to use pictures along with my\
  \ words. So, today I grabbed a set, along with some Flip-Mats, Map Packs, and some\
  \ miniatures, to play around with.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image2.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image2_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>In this first picture, a few adventurers check out a\
  \ dungeon room where some statues stand in alcoves and an open tomb is in the center\
  \ of the floor. A 5-foot square pit sits along one wall, while a trapdoor sits on\
  \ the floor along another wall.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image3.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image3_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>As they move through the dungeon, the adventurers find a crystal\
  \ skull set atop a pillar in a room lit by a few candelabras.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image4.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image4_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Despite knowing that it's never a good idea to split\
  \ the party, the rogue scouts ahead and gets ambushed by some goblins, only to find\
  \ evidence of their last victim and reinforcement that goblins really like fire\
  \ as the little buggers set off a fire flare.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image5.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image5_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Trying to catch up to his buddy, the barbarian cautiously\
  \ looks at a puzzling rune glowing on the floor of the dungeon corridor.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image6.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image6_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And the rogue continues to get into trouble, but thanks\
  \ to his training he's able to dodge out of the way of some floor spikes, a wall\
  \ blade, and a big crack in the dungeon floor. I hope that guy makes it back to\
  \ the party.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image7.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image7_360.jpeg\"></a>\n   \
  \ </div> \n    <p>This doesn't look good. Those pools of blood in front of the evil\
  \ altar make it look like the unfortunate rogue might have been sacrificed—or eaten—\
  by these undead. At least they decorate their chapel with some nice columns and\
  \ suits of armor.</p> \n    <p><i>(Not pictured because I only just now thought\
  \ of it... When using some of the pawns for tables and altars, you could set them\
  \ up on a couple of 6-sided dice to give some elevation.)</i></p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image8.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image8_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Remember those goblins? They decided to hike out to a\
  \ farm to steal some pickles, but ended up getting into a pickle. Here they encounter\
  \ a pile of bones surrounded by some vines, giving Reta the strong suspicion that\
  \ there's an assassin vine nearby. Some mold grows near the haystack and a bear\
  \ trap has been carelessly left in the grass. In the middle of the enclosure is\
  \ a barrel next to a hole with some rubble. Who—or what—dug that hole, and were\
  \ they going into or out of the ground? The real danger here is that snake swarm\
  \ chasing them out of the fenced area. Run lil' goblins, run!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image11.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image11_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Lastly, the adventurers make it back home. The barbarian\
  \ wipes his feet on the rug, while the rogue goes to sit at his cluttered desk (I\
  \ have such a desk in my office, but I don't have a chest and some books and scrolls.)\
  \ The neighboring room contains a clean desk (show off), a magic chest, and a lever.\
  \ A scroll case sits against the wall in a nearby room.</p> \n    <p>These pawns\
  \ can work well with Flip-Mats and Map Packs that already have furnishings. Since\
  \ most furnishings already on the maps fit nicely in their squares, these pawns\
  \ completely cover them up, adding versatility and reusability to your collection\
  \ of maps.</p> \n    <p>I hope you've enjoyed seeing just some of the traps and\
  \ treasures (and furniture and decorations) included in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujs?Pathfinder-Pawns-Traps-Treasures-Pawn-Collection\"\
