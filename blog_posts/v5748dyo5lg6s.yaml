  \   <p>Oloch has no memory of a time before pain—pain suffered, and pain inflicted.\
  \ A half-orc of the Haskodar tribe in Blisterwell, Oloch was raised—if it can truly\
  \ be called that—with the knowledge that his parents had been quarry slaves who\
  \ died in the ancient mine's cramped tunnels shortly after his birth. Constantly\
  \ forced to fight for survival against his larger, stronger tribe-mates, Oloch quickly\
  \ learned that the best defense is a total lack of fear or restraint. Those who\
  \ thought to casually bully the child soon learned the error of their ways, for\
  \ in Oloch's mind, every fight is a fight to the death, and anyone who pretends\
  \ otherwise leaves themselves vulnerable. </p> \n     <p>This fearless ferocity\
  \ did not go unnoticed. As Oloch reached his teenage years, the tribe's leaders\
  \ began harnessing the boy's abilities. Whether in the gladiatorial pits or in battle\
  \ against the sometimes-allied One Eye tribe, Oloch shed blood on command—both his\
  \ own and that of others As his victories mounted, the tribe's priests of Gorum\
  \ took control of Oloch's education, wrapping him in armor and teaching him the\
  \ glories of the Lord in Iron. In Gorum, Oloch finally found someone he could look\
  \ up to: a being of perfect strength, without the pathetic fallibilities of even\
  \ the other battle-priests. More, Gorum looked into Oloch's heart and put to rest\
  \ any nagging doubts the half-orc had about his love of violence. He saw the dark\
  \ thrill Oloch felt as his oversized sword split the spine of an enemy—and rewarded\
  \ it with magic.</p> \n     <p>As time went on, Oloch began to chafe at even the\
  \ meager restrictions placed on him by his orc superiors. Who were they to tell\
  \ him when and where to fight? And so perhaps it was inevitable that, upon learning\
  \ the truth of his heritage—that he was no slave child, but rather the stolen son\
  \ of a human adventurer—he took the chance to sever ties (and limbs) and strike\
  \ out on his own, taking with him only his favored gear and a description of the\
  \ fearsome warrior woman who bore him.</p> \n     <p>Fortunately for Oloch, the\
  \ legend of a woman brave enough to adventure alone in the Hold of Belkzen—and rumored\
  \ to tryst unashamedly with orcs—is a hard one to stifle. So it was that he soon\
  \ found himself standing before the gates of the human settlement of Trunau, calling\
  \ for its leader, Halgra of the Blackened Blades, to stand forth and meet her son.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To his surprise, she did, and Oloch found himself both shocked and vaguely\
  \ discomfited by the warmth with which Halgra greeted her lost son, welcoming him\
  \ into her house. There she told him the story of his birth—how he was the product\
  \ of a short-lived dalliance with a powerful orc leader she refused to name, and\
  \ how he had been stolen from her as an infant during a raid on her campsite. She\
  \ introduced him to his half-siblings, and offered him a place as a defender of\
  \ Trunau.</p> \n     <p>Yet a wolf can never be a simple dog, no matter how much\
  \ it might long to wear the chain. To Halgra's horror, Oloch's lust for battle refused\
  \ to be sated by simple raids and training bouts. Citizens who roused his ire were\
  \ terribly injured, and in the end Halgra herself had to take up her sword and drive\
  \ him from the town, announcing that she would always love him as a son—but that\
  \ he would never again be allowed in Trunau until he learned to control his battle\
  \ lust and turn his divine abilities toward a positive end.</p> \n     <p>Frustrated,\
  \ feeling shamed for the first time in his life, Oloch left Trunau. For a time he\
  \ wandered the wilds, yet no ordinary beasts could provide a proper challenge—nor\
  \ remove the lingering suspicion that there might, as Halgra claimed, be more to\
  \ life than simple bloodshed. Eventually he wound up in Urgir, where he quickly\
  \ found work as a government enforcer and champion. Though on the surface, he claims\
  \ that his position ensures him a steady supply of worthy opponents, in secret Oloch\
  \ hopes that Grask Uldeth's half-civilized ways will help him puzzle out how to\
  \ balance the orc and human inside himself and discover the man he was born to be.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Oloch is a quiet, brooding warrior with a disturbing love of violence.\
  \ Though not actively evil, and scornful of those who pick on obviously weaker opponents,\
  \ he nevertheless takes it as a given that might makes right, and the whining of\
  \ those unable to defend their property means little to him. He lives in the moment,\
  \ relishing the red rush of battle and the communion it brings him with his god.\
  \ He's not opposed to working with—or even for—those he considers his equals, but\
  \ those individuals are few and far between, and must take pains to show him proper\
  \ respect. Perhaps the only activity other than combat that truly brings him pleasure\
  \ is making music on his drum—and then only if it's sufficiently riotous as to echo\
  \ the clamor of battle.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Managing\
