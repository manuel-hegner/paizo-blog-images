  description\">We're puzzle fanatics at Lone Shark Games. We make all sorts of puzzles\
  \ for all sorts of puzzlers. We've published crosswords in the New York Times, constructed\
  \ puzzle escape rooms and giant puzzle hunts, and we even have a 10-foot crossword\
  \ wall at <a href=\"http://eltana.com/crosswords/\" target=\"_blank\">a bagel restaurant\
  \ in Seattle</a>. We've published a few puzzle books, most notably a solve-your-own-adventure\
  \ puzzle novel called <i><a href=\"http://store.penny-arcade.com/products/the-maze-of-games-by-mike-selinker\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">The Maze of Games</a></i>. Gaby, Tanis, and I worked with artist\
  \ Pete Venters and graphic designer Elisa Teague to create the most intricate series\
  \ of puzzle mazes you've ever seen. We're the kind of designers about whom people\
  \ say, \"Oh, I bet you think you're pretty clever.\"</p> \n    <p>And we do! One\
  \ of our slogans is \"We make puzzles for people who like games and games for people\
  \ who like puzzles.\" Most of our games are often viewed as puzzles. When you play\
  \ the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, the designers are presenting you with a puzzle:\
  \ Can you defeat this Runelord before time runs out? What about rescuing this many\
  \ civilians from the flood? Stopping that bomber before all your ships get sunk?\
  \ We've laid down the gauntlet, and we'll see if you can run it.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ we've shied away from using actual puzzles. You won't find a palindrome on the\
  \ walls or a code in the flavortext. You might find a few puzzly in-jokes—for example,\
  \ I came up with the Skull &amp; Shackles location name \"Scar Bay\" while watching\
  \ <a href=\"http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400506825\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >this college basketball game</a>. But we never made you a real puzzle—until the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9dao\"><em>Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth Adventure Deck</em></a>,\
  \ that is. Now, as with <i>The Maze of Games</i>, we've made you a maze.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Now, making a maze in a game is challenging. James Jacobs said so in his\
  \ introduction to <a href=\"/products/btpy92lh\">the RPG version</a> of this adventure.\
  \ He professed his undying love for mazes, and then continued: \"But the shameful\
  \ truth, I fear, is that mazes just aren't usually fun to play out in modern tabletop\
  \ game sessions. In fact, I've never played in or run a tabletop game involving\
  \ a significant maze that didn't outstay its welcome past the first few corners\
  \ and dead ends and didn't end up with the GM simply hand-waving the exploration\
  \ of the twists and turns so that everyone could get on with the next encounter\
  \ or story development.\"</p> \n    <p>Been there, done that. So we weren't going\
  \ to fall into that trap. While the other designers figured out how to make a <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li1n\">worksite performance review</a> into a great\
  \ scenario, Gaby and I set about to designing a maze that would be fun in the adventure\
  \ card game. And we might've been a little bit... evil.</p> \n    <h2>This is Part\
  \ of a Maze of Twisty Little Passages, All Alike</h2> \n    <p>The demon prince\
  \ Baphomet, the Lord of the Minotaurs, was our go-to goat-guy for our labyrinthine\
  \ extravaganza. The adventure takes place in the Ivory Labyrinth, his home plane\
  \ in the Abyss. It is a giant maze of dark corridors and confusing twists and turns.\
  \ The characters come here to find the kidnapped Herald of Iomedae because Baphomet\
  \ has cloistered him in an Ineluctable Prison. It's a crazy place, and we wanted\
  \ to make you feel lost and confused about where you were going. So we did.</p>\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>This is why you've got that maddening little earworm in your\
  \ head.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The second and third scenarios of this adventure\
  \ are your journey through the maze to reach the Ineluctable Prison. There are some\
  \ tricks here that instantly bollix up your plans. The citizens of Blackburgh are\
  \ real friendly types, so they want you to come visit them over and over again.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In Welcome to Blackburgh, when you move to a location, you shuffle its\
  \ deck. The mere act of moving makes you lose your place. Along the way, you'll\
  \ leave some breadcrumbs: You can always shuffle a card from your hand into your\
  \ location deck to explore it. No more discarding that ally to explore—just fling\
  \ him into the maze! You'll see him again, probably. Maybe.</p> \n    <p>In Twisty\
  \ Passages, if you close a location, you reassign the location cards to different\
  \ location decks. So here we make you move <i>without</i> making you move. When\
  \ you encounter a blessing, you'll conjure up the weird base set location Middle\
  \ of Nowhere, sticking you in a dead end at the very time you expect to feel like\
  \ you're making progress. That cardless location stops you from helping folks at\
  \ other locations and drains cards from the blessings deck when you want to leave.\
  \ So far, so fun, right?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Um, didn't we just leave here?</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The\
  \ plane's capital city is Blackburgh, home to Baphomet's tower. The Ivory Labyrinth\
  \ extends out from it, and the Lightless Maze is its scariest section. These three\
  \ cards make up the heart of the maze engine. The first three locations of these\
  \ scenarios form a mind-boggling triptych.</p> \n    <p>Blackburgh is like the entrance\
  \ to the maze. In Blackburgh, when you encounter a Cultist or Demon (hint: all the\
  \ time), you move everyone else. Everyone moves whenever you fight something, so\
  \ you can't count on folks to be lined up where they can help you the most. When\
  \ you close Blackburgh—even when you do so temporarily—you pop over to that other\
  \ weird base set location, Maze, where if you're not really smart, you'll always\
  \ end up back there. So you get used to finding dead ends around Blackburgh.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Ivory Labyrinth and Lightless Maze are even more brain-melting. When\
  \ you encounter one of the two types of cards that are in these location decks,\
  \ you go to Blackburgh... always go to Blackburgh... never go to anywhere else other\
  \ than Blackburgh. Except when you close one of these locations, in which case either\
  \ you or your friends go somewhere random. Possibly to Maze or Middle of Nowhere.\
  \ Maybe back to Blackburgh! You never know.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Oh, not you guys, too.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The things you\
  \ encounter kick you around, too. These Minotaurs have nasty variations on the \"\
  first encounter\" power seen on other Minotaurs. Now they're summoning up your favorite\
  \ locations and sending your characters there. The Maze Tapestry is another bad\
  \ penny, as you get to see Middle of Nowhere again and again. And so it goes. The\
  \ motto of this place should just be \"get lost.\"</p> \n    <h2>A Little Ball of\
  \ Twine Shall Guide You</h2> \n    <p>So what makes all that fun? You get to puzzle\
  \ your way out! You're going brain-to-brain against us. We've figured out lots of\
  \ little ways to beat this dilemma—tricks with certain boons and certain banes—\
  and we're gonna share them with you now.</p> \n    <p>Nah, just kidding. You should\
  \ find them by yourselves. But hey, we wouldn't chuck you into a maze without some\
  \ ways to help you get out.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Probably should've put that last one in Skull &amp; Shackles.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The best way to control your destiny in this maze is not to\
  \ trigger any of the disorienting things that can happen. The Evocation Staff pins\
  \ monsters to the Ivory Labyrinth until you're ready to go to Blackburgh; the imprisoned\
  \ devil Suurlahetas lets you snatch boons without encountering them and triggering\
  \ Lightless Maze; and the item Iron Shackles holds you fast in place when one of\
  \ these traps wants to move you somewhere.</p> \n    <p>And nothing is better in\
  \ this byzantine world-dungeon than Baphomet's most treasured possession: a humble\
  \ ball of twine. We're not sure why he loves this silver-a-dozen item so much. Maybe\
  \ he killed Theseus in another life. But love it he does, which is why you steal\
  \ it from him at the end of Welcome to Blackburgh.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ We steal </i>what<i> from </i>whom<i>?</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>While it charges\
  \ you up from pounding all these Minotaurs, Ball of Twine can get you out of Middle\
  \ of Nowhere and Maze. But it can also move you <i>to</i> those places, and that\
  \ can be very helpful at times. Don't want to deal with the Lightless Maze? Go to\
  \ Middle of Nowhere. Heck, it's probably there already. Why not visit?</p> \n  \
  \  <p>But other than those little perks, you're on your own against our devious\
  \ little brains. When you finish these scenarios, we'll be saying to you, \"Oh,\
  \ I bet you think you're pretty clever.\"</p> \n    <p>And you will think just that.</p>\
