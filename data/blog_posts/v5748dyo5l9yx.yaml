  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 22, 2008</p> \n    <p><a href=\"http://www.gencon.com/2008/indy/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con 2008</a> is roughly 22 days from the moment you read\
  \ this blog. Paizo is unveiling more new products, hosting more new events, and\
  \ cramming more game play into the Paizo booth than we have ever done at any convention.\
  \ To give a taste of what you'll find at this year's supreme gaming event and to\
  \ make those of you who can't make it seven flavors of raving envious, here's a\
  \ full list of Paizo events we'll debut at the show:</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play</b><br> Though most of the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> events are totally sold out, there are still\
  \ a few that have open slots. If you didn't sign up for these slots during pre-registration,\
  \ no problem! Grab yourself two generic tickets per slot at the show and come ready\
  \ to play. Keep an eye on the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ website</a> for character creation guidelines that should be posted around August\
  \ 1. The following slots still have availability:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n    \
  \ <p>Slot 2: Thursday 1 P.M. to 5 P.M.<br> Scenario #3: Murder on the Silken Caravan<br>\
  \ Scenario #4: The Frozen Fingers of Midnight</p> \n     <p>Slot 7: Sunday 8 A.M.\
  \ to 12 P.M.<br> Scenario #3: Murder on the Silken Caravan</p> \n     <p>Slot 8:\
  \ Sunday 1 P.M. to 5 P.M.<br> Scenario #1: The Silent Tide<br> Scenario #2: The\
  \ Hydra's Fang Incident</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path Preview: Ascension of the Drow</b><br> Though this event is completely sold\
  \ out, we'd be remiss to not include it in the list of Paizo events at Gen Con.\
  \ Ascension of the Drow is a Nicolas Logue-run Paizo mega-event that will determine\
  \ the ruling house of a Drow city to be featured in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tq\"\
  >Pathfinder #16</a>. More than 100 players, Game Masters, and special guests will\
  \ play a variety of Drow, demons, and maybe even gods as they battle for total supremacy.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Assault on Falcon's Hollow: a Paizo Delve</b><br> Last year's delve\
  \ went smashingly (pun intended) and we knew for this year's delve that we'd need\
  \ to line up an even greater number of monsters to raise our tallies of PC deaths\
  \ and TPKs even higher! Come by Paizo Booth #2221 during dealer hall hours, grab\
  \ a pre-generated <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8254\">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a>\
  \ character, and test out the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8254\">Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game's</a> combat system while you protect the tiny village of Falcon's Hollow\
  \ from a ravenous horde of horrendous undead. Accomplishing pre-determined goals\
  \ will win you and your party keys. Those keys just might open our treasure chest,\
  \ winning you fame, fortune, and some free stuff. Sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.dwarvenforge.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Dwarven Forge</a>.</p> \n    <p><b>Paizo Publishing Seminars</b><br>\
  \ Judging by pre-registration numbers alone, we may very well \"sell out\" most\
  \ of our seminars at Gen Con this year (they're free to attend for Gen Con attendees.)\
  \ Pre-registration numbers are the highest attendance counts we've ever had for\
  \ Gen Con seminars and the show hasn't even started yet!</p> \n    <blockquote>\
