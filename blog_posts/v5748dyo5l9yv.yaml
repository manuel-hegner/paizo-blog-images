  \ RPG Beta Preview #3</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 24, 2008</p> \n\
  \   <p>The <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8254\">Beta Playtest Edition</a> of the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG\"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i></a> is off to the printer\
  \ and is due to be released in mid August. In anticipation, we are previewing some\
  \ of the changes made from the Alpha stage as well as taking a look at some of the\
  \ brand new content. In this preview, we are investigating some of the new rules\
  \ that can be found in the Beta Playtest Edition.</p> \n   <p><b>Equipment:</b>\
  \ All of the basic equipment is here, plus a few new weapons to round out the list.\
  \ The starknife is finally part of the Pathfinder RPG, meaning that clerics of Desna\
  \ now have the correct weapon. Although this material is not strictly \"new,\" some\
  \ of it has been carefully tweaked to fit with other rule changes.</p> \n   <p><b>Traps:</b>\
  \ The system for creating traps has receive a significant overhaul. Although the\
  \ end result is mostly the same, the formulas now allow for traps that go all the\
  \ way up to CR 20. When building a trap using the Pathfinder RPG rules, the amount\
  \ of damage and average number of targets is now more important, meaning that traps\
  \ that hit the entire party, draining far more resources, are of a higher CR than\
  \ traps that only target one character. A trap's CR can also increase dramatically\
  \ if it lasts more than one round. Here are a few examples.</p> \n   <p><b>Swinging\
  \ Axe Trap: CR 1</b><br> <b>Type</b> mechanical; <b>Perception</b> DC 20; <b>Disable\
  \ Device</b> DC 20<br> <b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Reset</b> manual<br> <b>Effect</b>\
  \ Atk +10 melee (1d8+1/x3); multiple targets (all targets in a 10-ft. line)</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Frost Fangs Trap: CR 7</b><br> <b>Type</b> mechanical; <b>Perception</b>\
  \ DC 25; <b>Disable Device</b> DC 20<br> <b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Duration</b>\
  \ 3 rounds; <b>Reset</b> none<br> <b>Effect</b> jets of freezing water (3d6 cold\
  \ damage, DC 20 Reflex save for half damage); multiple targets (all targets in a\
  \ 40-ft.-square chamber)</p> \n   <p><b>Meteor Swarm Trap: CR 19</b><br> <b>Type</b>\
  \ magic; <b>Perception</b> DC 34; <b>Disable Device</b> DC 34<br> <b>Trigger</b>\
  \ sight (<i>true seeing</i>); <b>Reset</b> none<br> <b>Effect</b> spell effect (<i>meteor\
  \ swarm</i>, 4 meteors at separate targets, +9 ranged touch, 2d6 plus 6d6 fire (no\
  \ save on a hit), DC 23 Reflex save for half damage on a miss, 18d6 fire damage\
  \ from other meteors (DC 23 Reflex save for half damage); multiple targets (four\
  \ targets, no two of which can be more than 40 ft. apart)</p> \n   <p><b>Spells\
  \ and Magic Items:</b> Both of these chapters have been expanded to a gigantic size\
  \ (with the spells chapter alone coming in at 120 pages). While much of the content\
  \ in these chapters is unchanged, a number of spells and items received some updates\
  \ in the Beta, mostly to bring them in line with the rest of the rules. Due to space\
  \ concerns, some of the spells and magic items were cut, but will be available in\
  \ a free web enhancement for the book, due out at the same time the Beta Playtest\
  \ Edition is released.</p> \n   <p>You will be able to grab the Beta Playtest Edition\
  \ as a free PDF here at paizo.com or as a soft-cover, 408 page, full-color book.\
  \ The book will be on sale at Gen Con, through our web store, and from your favorite\
  \ local game store. Check back next week for a look at the Beta playtest process\
  \ as well as what is in store for the next year of development.</p> \n   <p> Jason\
