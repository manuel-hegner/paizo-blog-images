  \ in Your Hands</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, July 23, 2008</p> \n   \
  \ <p><a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i9\">Next month's <i>Pathfinder</i></a> marks\
  \ more than just the launch of the Second Darkness Adventure Path, it also premieres\
  \ a new addition to <i>Pathfinder</i>'s pages with the first of our new Set Piece\
  \ adventures! Eight-page adventures tied to that month's Adventure Path entry, Set\
  \ Pieces present GMs with a host of options whether they're playing the ongoing\
  \ Adventure Path, running their own games, or simply need an iconic location. Each\
  \ Set Piece is built as an optional Adventure Path episode and includes details\
  \ on how to include it in the month's adventure. For GMs craving lighter fare, though,\
  \ these scenarios are flexible enough to adapt to any ongoing campaign or even serve\
  \ as short, one-night adventures. There's also no telling when your game might need\
  \ a familiar fantasy location—whether it be a thieves' guild, pirate ship, monster-haunted\
  \ ruin, or one of countless other archetypical adventure sites—making Set Pieces\
  \ useful to GMs who need a locale on the fly when their players zig when they're\
  \ supposed to zag. </p> \n    <p>The first Set Piece, Tim Hitchcock's \"Saint Caspieran's\
  \ Salvation,\" presents a Riddleport thieves' den insidiously hidden beneath the\
  \ guise of a rundown chapel. Forced to distinguish scheming swindlers from the truly\
  \ needy, the PCs need to wade through a crowd of questionable castoffs to uncover\
  \ the misdeeds rooted amid the hostel's good work.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p> <b>Unfortunates of St. Caspieran's</b> <br> <b>d6 Mission Encounters</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p> <b>1 Ukkar the Fierce:</b> Once a raging warrior, Ukkar's legs were\
  \ crushed in a cart accident and had to be amputated when they turned gangrenous.\
  \ Now he sits in a small cart and pushes himself about with his calloused hands.\
  \ </p> \n     <p> <b>2 Sylee:</b> This orphan girl stares silently with fearful\
  \ eyes, desperately clutching a dirty rag doll with a missing arm. </p> \n     <p>\
  \ <b>3 Lil' Lirt:</b> A young boy tries to slit one of the PCs' pouches or pockets\
  \ with a razor and make off with whatever's inside. If caught, he bawls for mercy.\
  \ </p> \n     <p> <b>4 Jhonas:</b> When away from Father Padrick's side, Jhonas\
  \ walks the mission, talking to different parishioners and vagrants, trying to learn\
  \ from their perspectives as much as offer them his blessings. </p> \n     <p> <b>5\
  \ Pauper's Hand:</b> These troublesome thieves are always milling about. If one\
  \ spots a PC, he hurries to alert the other guild members. </p> \n     <p> <b>6\
  \ Mika the Fallen:</b> This poor mad fellow walks around barefoot wearing nothing\
  \ but old sackcloth. He believes he's a fallen angel sent to redeem himself by offering\
  \ comfort to lost souls. To those he feels suffer most, he offers true salvation—\
  walking with them up to a high rooftop and pushing them off.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>You'll meet this lot and more of Riddleport's most desperate and despicable\
  \ residents in \"St. Caspieran's Salvation,\" the first <i>Pathfinder</i> Set Piece\
  \ adventure, coming up next month in <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i9\"><i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ #13</a>.</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider <br>Managing Editor, <i>Pathfinder</i></p>\
