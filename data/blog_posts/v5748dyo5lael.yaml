  \ here anywhere? I am waiting for her to get here so that I can properly preview\
  \ her and her awesome rogue talents, but she must be running late. Just like an\
  \ elf, always running late. I know they live for hundreds of years, but my poor\
  \ human life is short and I would like to spend it on things other than waiting\
  \ for her to show up. Ow... my kidney!</p> \n    <p>So, now that Merisiel is finally\
  \ here and I am shy one kidney, it is time to look at the rogue. Not much changed\
  \ between the Beta version of the rules and the final game, but for those who are\
  \ not familiar, let me walk you through the major differences.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ big change for rogues in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is the addition of rogue\
  \ talents. These work like the special abilities that rogues gained at higher levels\
  \ in 3.5, but now they are scaled and a rogue gets her first one at 2nd. Every 2\
  \ levels beyond 2nd, she can select an additional talent, and upon reaching 10th\
  \ level, she can begin selecting advanced talents (which includes all of the special\
  \ abilities from 3.5). Rogue talents are a mixed bag of abilities that allow a rogue\
  \ to become a little better at one facet of rogue life. Merisiel here has three\
  \ talents: finesse rogue, surprise attack, and trap spotter. The first gives her\
  \ Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat, making it a common choice for 2nd level rogues.\
  \ Surprise attack causes all of Merisiel's opponents to be treated as flat-footed\
  \ to her attacks during a surprise round, even if they have already acted. Finally,\
  \ trap spotter gives Merisiel a Perception check to notice a trap the moment she\
  \ moves to within 10 feet of it.</p> \n    <p>Other rogue talents add to a rogue's\
  \ sneak attack, such as slow reactions that causes an opponent hit by a rogue's\
  \ sneak attack to lose the ability to make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. There\
  \ are a number of rogue talents that affect movement, allowing a rogue to move faster\
  \ while balancing or sneaking. There are even a pair of talents that allow rogues\
  \ to cast a limited number of simple spells to aid them in their shadowy deeds.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Aside from rogue talents, there have been a few other modifications and\
  \ additions to the rogue. The biggest of these are the changes to sneak attack.\
  \ This iconic ability now functions on a wider variety of creatures, such as undead\
  \ and constructs. Now that all characters can locate and disarm mechanical traps\
  \ regardless of the DC, the trapfinding ability now grants a bonus on Perception\
  \ checks to notice traps and Disable Device checks equal to half the rogue's level.\
  \ It also grants rogues the ability to disarm magic traps. Finally, up at 20th level,\
  \ the rogue gains the master strike class feature, which allows her to kill, paralyze,\
  \ or put targets to sleep with a successful sneak attack.</p> \n    <p>Aside from\
  \ her class features, there are a few other interesting rules bits presented here.\
  \ Dodge now grants a +1 dodge bonus to AC (and CMD) against all targets. Never again\
  \ will you need to remember to designate a single foe. Mobility works much as before,\
  \ but Nimble Moves is a new feat. This allows Merisiel to ignore 5 feet of difficult\
  \ terrain each round while moving. It might not seem like much but it does allow\
  \ her to take a 5-foot-step into such terrain or move through it during a charge,\
  \ both of which might be vital depending on the circumstances.</p> \n    <p>Well,\
  \ that is all for this week. Wait a minute, that was a bit short. Since I seem to\
  \ have a bit of extra space this week, I guess I will take a look at some of the\
  \ other rules that a rogue must contend with on a daily basis. Of course, I am talking\
  \ about traps and poisons.</p> \n    <p>While traps work much in the same way that\
  \ they always have, the trap rules have been adjusted to scale all the way up to\
  \ CR 20. This was accomplished by adding in some modifiers for traps that target\
  \ multiple creatures or last for more than 1 round. For example, the chamber of\
  \ blades trap, presented below, that deals damage to everyone within a large chamber\
  \ and lasts for 1d4 rounds. On average, this trap is going to last for 2 rounds\
  \ and everyone in the room is going to be attacked twice at a +20 bonus for 3d8+3\
  \ on each hit. While this is not a huge amount of damage for 10th level characters,\
  \ it can add up really quick. On average, PCs are going to take 32 points of damage\
  \ before this trap has run it course (or double that if a 4 is rolled for the duration).</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote>\n     <p><b>Chamber of Blades Trap (CR 10)</b><br> <b>Type</b>\
  \ mechanical; <b>Perception</b> DC 25; <b>Disable Device</b> DC 20<br> <b>EFFECTS</b><br>\
  \ <b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Duration</b> 1d4 rounds; <b>Reset</b> repair<br> <b>Effect</b>\
  \ Atk +20 melee (3d8+3); multiple targets (all targets in a 20-foot-square chamber)</p>\n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <p>Poisons, on the other hand, have seen some revisions.\
  \ After PCs hit about 7th level in 3.5, poison becomes almost an irrelevant threat.\
  \ Once <i>heroes feast</i> becomes an option, it is completely pointless, which\
  \ is a shame. In the Pathfinder RPG, poisons are a threat again at every level.\
  \ The immunity gained from <i>heroes feast</i> has been changed to a bonus against\
  \ poison saves (the same has happened to its immunity to fear) and <i>neutralize\
  \ poison</i> now requires a caster level check versus the DC of the poison to remove\
  \ it. Add that in with some advanced poisons and you have a threat that the PCs\
  \ must now consider when taking on some of the more iconic monsters in the game.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In addition, the mechanics behind poison have changed. Most now deal\
  \ damage every round until they have run their course (this is called the frequency),\
  \ but the amount of damage per round has been decreased a bit to compensate. Each\
  \ poison has a cure line as well, which tells you how many saves you need to make\
  \ to be free of the poison before the frequency has run out. If you have been poisoned\
  \ multiple times by the same source, you no longer need to make multiple saves.\
  \ Instead, the duration of the poison increases by 50% of the original duration\
  \ and the DC of the save increases by +2. So, if you were poisoned three times by\
  \ a wyvern, the frequency would become 1/round for 12 rounds and the DC would increase\
  \ to 21. This system really opens up the poison rules (and curses and diseases which\
  \ work under similar rules), allowing you to concoct all manner of vile ways to\
  \ die. Here are a few sample poisons from the <i>Core Rulebook</i> to get your ideas\
  \ flowing.</p> \n    <blockquote>\n     <p><b>Belladonna</b><br> <b>Type</b> poison,\
  \ ingested; <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 14<br> <b>Onset</b> 10 minutes; <b>Frequency</b>\
  \ 1/minute for 6 minutes<br> <b>Effect</b> 1d2 Str damage, target can attempt one\
  \ save to cure a lycanthropy affliction contracted in the past hour; <b>Cure</b>\
  \ 1 save</p> \n     <p><b>Insanity Mist</b><br> <b>Type</b> poison, inhaled; <b>Save</b>\
  \ Fortitude DC 15<br> <b>Frequency</b> 1/round for 6 rounds<br> <b>Effect</b> 1d3\
  \ Wis damage; <b>Cure</b> 1 save</p> \n     <p><b>King's Sleep</b><br> <b>Type</b>\
  \ poison, ingested; <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 19<br> <b>Onset</b> 1 day; <b>Frequency</b>\
  \ 1/day (unlike others, this poison continues until cured)<br> <b>Effect</b> 1 Con\
  \ drain; <b>Cure</b> 2 consecutive saves</p> \n     <p><b>Tears of Death</b><br>\
  \ <b>Type</b> poison, contact; <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 22<br> <b>Onset</b> 1 minute;\
  \ <b>Frequency</b> 1/minute for 6 minutes<br> <b>Effect</b> 1d6 Con damage and paralyzed\
  \ for 1 minute; <b>Cure</b> none (This poison continues until the end of its frequency,\
  \ regardless of the number of saving throws made)</p> \n     <p><b>Wyvern Poison</b><br>\
  \ <b>Type</b> poison, injury; <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 17<br> <b>Frequency</b> 1/round\
  \ for 6 rounds<br> <b>Effect</b> 1d4 Con damage; <b>Cure</b> 2 consecutive saves</p>\n\

  \ the release of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>. Of course, if you want\
  \ a bit more, check out <i>Kobold Quarterly</i> #10, which contains another preview\
  \ written by yours truly and a look at the revised shadowdancer prestige class.\
  \ Next week, we will round out our look at the base classes by taking a look at\
  \ Ezren, the iconic wizard.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead Designer</p> \n\
