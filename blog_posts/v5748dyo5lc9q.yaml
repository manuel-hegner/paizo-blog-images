  \ Robin D. Laws</p> \n  <h2>Chapter Three: The Dog</h2> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Gad's\
  \ feet scramble for purchase against a heap of gravel as the muscular prisoner chokes\
  \ the life from him. Stokh grunts in surprise; Gad's supposed to be shackled at\
  \ the ankles. He tightens his grip. Gad's arm flails into the gravel pile. He fishes\
  \ out an object.</p> \n   <p>The burly prisoner sees the flash of metal and releases\
  \ Gad in a twitch of panic. Knuckles white on the hilt of Ethundel's dagger—stolen\
  \ when he prompted Stokh to push him into the elf on the way into the excavation\
  \ that morning—Gad neatly plunges it between the startled man's well-demarcated\
  \ ribs. He jams it in deep. He twists, forcing Stokh to cry out in pain.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Agonized cries resound through the pit. They cease as blood fills Stokh's\
  \ lungs. He dies to the sound of running elven feet. Gad steps out of Stokh's path\
  \ as his corpse timbers to the dirt. He slides to Vitta's side, yards away. He presses\
  \ his ankles together. Vitta slaps the shackles on them. Using a twig she's carved,\
  \ she clicks its tumblers, locking it. She stashes the twig in the rock pile, retrieving\
  \ another item. When she sees that Ethundel has seized control of the scene and\
  \ is barking orders to his fellow Reclaimers, she places it in Gad's hand.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Ethundel rushes to Stokh's side. He places fingers on his jugular, shakes\
  \ his head, and rises. A red fury, so intense as to be visible in the weak light\
  \ of predawn, suffuses his triangular face.</p> \n   <p>\"Where is the new one?\"\
  \ he calls. \"Where is the churl?\"</p> \n   <p>Gad scrabbles back, catching his\
  \ eye. The elf sprints at him, hauling him to his shackled feet. He backhands Gad\
  \ across the face. Throws him against the pit wall. When he tries to knee him in\
  \ the groin, Gad angles to avoid the worst.</p> \n   <p>\"What happens here?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>At the slicing sound of his mistress's voice, Ethundel stops. He throws\
  \ Gad to the dirt. \"The new one has murdered our best thrall. Our strongest, most\
  \ loyal human.\"</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <table align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"\

  \ arched brow suggests that her admiration for Stokh ran cooler than her lieutenant's.\
  \ \"Humans are vicious, Ethundel. They slay one another. The savage ones are oft\
  \ of greater use than their docile brethren.\"</p> \n   <p>Ethundel points at Gad.\
  \ \"And I shall slay this one.\"</p> \n   <p>\"And lose two slaves, instead of one?\"\
  \ says Dualal. \"When we are a few day's digging from our prize?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I warned him not to defy me.\"</p> \n   <p>She laughs. \"I've told you time and\
  \ again, child, just because these creatures walk and talk, and seem capable of\
  \ feeling, you must not mistake them for people. They are but snarling animals.\
  \ If one dog tears another's throat, it is not the fault of the dog, but of the\
  \ negligent dog-keeper.\" She sweeps toward Ethundel. \"Why did you let my one good\
  \ dog kill my other?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Milady...\" Ethundel stutters.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I raised you from nothing, and you are hard and brave, yet you haven't the sense\
  \ of a barnacle.\"</p> \n   <p>Ethundel can see that his comrades are watching him.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"I didn't even do it!\" Gad blurts.</p> \n   <p>\"What?\" says Dualal.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"He says I killed Stokh, but it wasn't me. Look! He's stabbed. Do I have\
  \ a blade?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Ethundel,\" she says, \"did you let the human have a\
  \ dagger?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I did not!\" </p> \n   <p>\"Look!\" says Gad, \"the blood's\
  \ on his scabbard!\"</p> \n   <p>The dagger is back on Ethundel's hip. Returned\
  \ to him when he was trying to knee Gad in the gobbles. Stokh's sticky blood smears\
  \ his belt and tunic.</p> \n   <p>Dualal's hand snakes out at him. </p> \n   <p>In\
  \ an unthinking defensive gesture, Ethundel's hand lands on his guilty dagger-hilt.\
  \ He immediately lets it go, as if it burns. His lips follow the rhythm of his unraveling\
  \ thoughts. \"He must have—no...\"</p> \n   <p>\"Give me that blade,\" she says.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>From her tone, Gad decides he guessed right. These two are like mother\
  \ and son. But not truly mother and son. All the demands, none of the affection.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>She pulls the knife from its sheath. With it falls a bundle wrapped in\
  \ a dirty rag. It falls to the dirt. Glinting dawn light reflects from ruby facets.\
  \ Dualal bends down to seize the purloined gems.</p> \n   <p>\"You've been holding\
  \ out on me,\" she says.</p> \n   <p>\"No.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I told everyone that\
  \ any treasures found in the Ironroot Vaults were to be turned over to me. And you,\
  \ of all my followers, you betray me?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I've never seen those before.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"You, whom I elevated not for your strength, nor for your courage,\
  \ but for your loyalty—you would forsake me for a handful of stones?\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>She stabs him in the chest. He drops to his knees, more out of supplication\
  \ than injury. </p> \n   <p>\"Milady, it's a trick, I would never—\"</p> \n   <p>Dualal\
  \ jabs the knife into his open mouth, slashing his tongue. \"Silence, traitor!\"\
  \ She wheels to face the appalled ranks of her minions. Ethundel gags behind her.\
  \ \"Each of you will stab him once with his own duplicitous blade. I shall punish\
  \ shirkers and light-strikers as I have punished him!\"</p> \n   <p>One by one,\
  \ they step up and meekly comply. Her lackeys slash at Ethundel enough to say they've\
  \ done it. She wrinkles her nose in dissatisfaction.</p> \n   <p>\"You there. Human,\"\
  \ she says.</p> \n   <p>\"Me?\" Gad asks.</p> \n   <p>\"These elves are of the blood,\
  \ yet have permitted it to run thin in their veins. We lost Golarion to you because\
  \ we lacked your cruelty. To take it back, we must equal your barbarity. Teach my\
  \ men a lesson, human. Show them what savagery is.\"</p> \n   <p>She proffers the\
  \ knife.</p> \n   <p>\"Do it. I'll reward you.\"</p> \n   <p>Gad steps up and slices\
  \ open Ethundel's throat.</p> \n   <p>Imagining that he's doing it to her.</p> \n\
  \   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗ ∗ ∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>Days of toil\
  \ pass, with no hint of Dualal's promised reward. Each morning Gad and Vitta go\
  \ down into the excavation with the rest of the press gang. Some days they break\
  \ rocks. Some days they pass debris buckets down the passage or up the shaft. Every\
  \ night they stumble from the complex, which they now know as the Ironroot Vaults,\
  \ topple onto beds of gravel, and surrender to pain-wracked sleep.</p> \n   <p>Since\
  \ his stabbing of Ethundel, the other prisoners come to Gad, as if, in killing the\
  \ elf, he gained a measure of his authority.</p> \n   <p>They say:</p> \n   <p>\"\
  They're going to work us to death.\"</p> \n   <p>\"My name is Saadak. I have a wife,\
  \ three children, and another on the way. My death will be their misery, too.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"If we're still alive when they get whatever they're looking for,\
  \ they'll slaughter us just for spite.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I am Barash, son of Barash.\
  \ I was foolish to venture so close to the Shudderwood with my cart, but it is not\
  \ a crime I deserve to be killed for.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I overheard her. They seek\
  \ a gem that will prove her destined to rule the world. That can't be true, can\
  \ it?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I am Tlivush. That is my brother, Tliuka. It does not matter\
  \ what happens to me, but if he does not return, it will break our mother's heart.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"There must be a way we can escape.\"</p> \n   <p>\"She thinks you're\
  \ her new pet or such. We beg you, sway her to ease up on us.\"</p> \n   <p>It throws\
  \ him off. Gad is used to leading, to calling the moves, but with confederates who\
  \ are in on the gaffle. Responsibility for a pack of ordinaries is not part of the\
  \ plan.</p> \n   <p>The next evening, as the end of the shift nears, Vitta's ax\
  \ opens a hole to a hollow chamber. She quickly returns the rock to its place. \"\
  The digging's almost done,\" she says to Gad.</p> \n   <p>That night, Gad sleeps\
  \ fitfully. He dreams that Dualal is looming over him.</p> \n   <p>He awakens. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>Dualal is looming over him.</p> \n   <p>She unlocks his shackles and takes\
  \ him for a walk. They stroll up the slope out of the pit, to the dead forest beyond.\
  \ \"The other dogs gather around you,\" she says.</p> \n   <p>\"We prefer 'human.'\"\
  </p> \n   <p>She turns to face him, as if worried that he'll rifle her pack. \"\
  I said I'd reward you, and I will. Even though a sliver of me now suspects that\
  \ you somehow abetted Ethundel in his betrayal.\"</p> \n   <p>\"That's not so,\"\
  \ Gad says.</p> \n   <p>\"Your people were bred to serve mine. You'll deny it, but\
  \ it's true. Are we not older, wiser, more beautiful? How could we be supplanted\
  \ by such as you?\"</p> \n   <p>\"It is a mystery.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I could use a\
  \ loyal dog. A killing beast. Instinctively, the others yearn to follow you. Why\
  \ is that?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Your thoughts rush swiftly. This poor dog can't keep\
  \ up.\"</p> \n   <p>\"When I rule... It is unrealistic to expect that we shall exterminate\
  \ your race entirely. Many will remain. I must learn to command your kind. Yet my\
  \ revulsion for you clouds my understanding.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You're not too big\
  \ to admit that.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Not at all.\"</p> \n   <p>\"What makes you think\
  \ you're going to be world-queen?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Do not mistake this moment of\
  \ intimacy for weakness. Insolence shall still be punished. My visions say so. Since\
  \ I was but a child, I have dreamed my future glory. I would fall into a trance,\
  \ and recite epic stanzas of my eventual deeds. All the great prophetic poems of\
  \ elvenkind refer to me, foretell my coming. Yet unbelievers, even other Reclaimers,\
  \ refuse to see the obvious parallels in the texts. The prophets say that the great\
  \ elf queen to come will find a gem, buried deep in the earth. Its light will shine\
  \ on the elven people, curing them of their blindness. Forcing them to recognize\
  \ me. I will unite the elves and fey of the known worlds, then the seven leaves\
  \ will fall—but it is beyond your comprehension.\"</p> \n   <p>\"And that's what\
  \ we seek here—your gem?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Two thousand years ago came the first harbinger\
  \ of my rule. The thornbeast. A terrible tripartite devourer: animal, mineral, vegetable.\
  \ It scourged the elven kingdoms, seeking the queen too early, enraged by its failure\
  \ to find her. The elves of this land finally captured it and sealed it in their\
  \ own holy Ironroot Vaults. They could not kill it, so they left a powerful gem,\
  \ the Opal of Command, to force its eternal slumber.\"</p> \n   <p>\"And the opal\
  \ is your gem of prophecy.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yes.\"</p> \n   <p>\"So what happens\
  \ when you take it from its resting place? You release the thornbeast?\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Don't worry about that, good dog.\"</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n\
  \    ∗ ∗ ∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>Gad asks the amber elf\
  \ what his name is as he and Vitta smash through the last wall of rock to the open\
  \ chamber beyond. The elf has time to snarl at him before the stones give way, collapsing\
  \ into a tumble of rubble at their feet. </p> \n   <p>Darkness shrouds the chambers\
  \ beyond. Vitta reaches for a lantern.</p> \n   <p>The amber elf stops her short.\
  \ \"Halfling! Go to the top, and convey to your mistress that the excavation is\
  \ at an end.\"</p> \n   <p>Gad steps lightly on her toe, to forestall the retort\
  \ he can already hear coming. She stalks off down the passageway, squeezing her\
  \ way past the row of bucket-haulers. \"Drop your pails, boys,\" she says. \"Digging's\
  \ over.\"</p> \n   <p>Soon Dualal and her best-armed guards have shoved themselves\
  \ into the tiny terminal chamber. She peers into the black with her exceptional\
  \ elven eyes.</p> \n   <p>\"Shall I dismiss the thralls?\" Amber elf asks. \"We\
  \ shall guard you, the rest of the way.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yes,\" says Dualal.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>A hideous, hungry wail echoes from the depths. </p> \n   <p>Dualal whispers:\
  \ \"The thornbeast.\" She swallows, then shudders back to composure. \"On second\
  \ thought,\" she says. \"The thralls may still be of use. To walk ahead, and alert\
  \ us to hazards.\" She turns to Gad. He expects to see a cruel smile but there is\
  \ only blankness. She gestures to the pile of stones, and hands him a lantern. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Proceed, brave dog, proceed.\"</p> \n   <br> \n   <p><b>Coming Next\
