  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, December 2, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">By now I hope you've had a chance to check out\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, the hot new <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> set of pre-painted plastic gaming figures\
  \ from WizKids that's in stores and shipping from the paizo.com warehouse RIGHT\
  \ NOW! <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> contains a wide variety\
  \ of commonly encountered creatures from the <a href=\"/pathfinderrpg\">Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game</a>, and looking at the production-run figures, I think it's\
  \ one of our finest sets to date. In fact, following up <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> is a bit intimidating.</p> \n    <p>Happily, our next\
  \ set, April's <a href=\"/products/btpy9qab\"><em>Crown of Fangs</em></a>, ups the\
  \ ante in ways that will take me several weeks to fully explore. It's an exciting\
  \ time for <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>, with lots of new\
  \ figures and set features unlike anything we've done before.</p> It's become a\
  \ bit of a tradition that the first image I post from a new set is that set's limited\
  \ edition case incentive figure, but in the case of <a href=\"/products/btpy9qab\"\
  ><em>Crown of Fangs</em></a>, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9p8l\">Court of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</a> incentive playset is so awesome, so packed with value that I don't\
  \ have enough time today to go into it in full, glorious detail. Instead, I'd like\
  \ to show off four figures (including two from the incentive) that give a nice taste\
  \ of what's in store.\n    <p></p> \n    <p>For starters, <a href=\"/products/btpy9qab\"\
  ><em>Crown of Fangs</em></a> is a bit of an unofficial companion to Paizo's popular\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</a> Adventure Path, now available in a special collected <a href=\"/products/btpy9nme\"\
  >hardcover edition</a>! The set includes many key NPCs, factions, and creature types\
  \ encountered in that classic Pathfinder campaign, but the set also includes plenty\
  \ of \"generic\" figures useful for any fantasy campaign. Today's preview shows\
  \ off both types of figures.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161202-Ileosa.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161202-Ileosa_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>First up today is the imposing Queen Ileosa Arabasti, wearer\
  \ of the titular Crown of Thorns and a major, let's say character, in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9nme\">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> campaign. Ileosa previously\
  \ appeared in a different outfit in our <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"><em>Legends\
  \ of Golarion</em></a> set a few years back. I'll leave the reasons behind her costume\
  \ change to the campaign itself, but suffice it to say we thought it would be fitting\
  \ to include an \"after\" figure to <a href=\"\"><em>Legends of Golarion's</em></a>\
  \ \"before.\" Queen Ileosa Arabasti is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161202-SeatedIleosa.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161202-SeatedIleosa_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Here's another look at Queen Ileosa seated upon the eponymous\
  \ Crimson Throne itself, the centerpiece of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9p8l\">Court\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</a> case incentive playset. The seated version of Ileosa\
  \ seen here also comes in the incentive playset, and is fully removable from the\
  \ throne, which stands alone as an amazing piece of dungeon dressing.</p> \n   \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161202-BoneDevil.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161202-BoneDevil_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>But it's not just Crimson Throne and Ileosa all the time.\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9qab\"><em>Crown of Fangs</em></a> also includes tons\
  \ of in-demand figures for commonly encountered foes such as this awesome Bone Devil.\
  \ The Bone Devil is a Large, uncommon figure, and I simply cannot wait to add a\
  \ couple of handfuls of these to my personal <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> collection.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of Pathfinder Battles collections,\
  \ the best way to make sure you never miss a single figure is to sign up for a <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Pathfinder Battles Ongoing Subscription</a>, which\
  \ delivers Pathinder Battles goodness directly to you as it is released. Your subscriptions\
  \ are the single most important factor in keeping the line healthy with lots of\
  \ robust offerings, and I'd like to offer a heart-felt \"thanks\" to all current\
  \ and future subscribers.</p> \n    <p>You guys are the best!</p> \n    <p>Next\
  \ week, I'll have more awesome <a href=\"/products/btpy9qab\"><em>Crown of Fangs</em></a>\
  \ figures to reveal!</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
