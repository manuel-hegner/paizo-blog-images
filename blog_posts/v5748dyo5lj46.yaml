  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're a month away from the release\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, the launch\
  \ of an all-new comic book series from our partners at Dynamite! Pathfinder Worldscape\
  \ throws the Pathfinder adventurers Valeros, Seoni, Merisiel, and Kyra into a prison\
  \ dimension that draws in the greatest warriors of three worlds, giving us the unique\
  \ opportunity to cross over the Pathfinder adventurers with Dynamite's incredible\
  \ roster of fantasy and pulp characters, including Red Sonja, John Carter of Mars,\
  \ Tarzan, and a host of others. I'm quite excited about the series as a Pathfinder\
  \ publisher and as a pulp fan, but to be perfectly frank, the thing that excites\
  \ me most about <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> is the fact that I am writing it.</p> \n    <p>I've previously\
  \ contributed scripts to the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/goblins\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Goblins!</em></a>, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/origins\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Origins</em></a>, and <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Hollow Mountain</em></a> series, but this is my first go as the\
  \ sole writer for all six issues, and overall the Worldscape project is one I've\
  \ been working behind the scenes to make happen for years, almost since the very\
  \ first Pathfinder comic ever came out. I'm thrilled and humbled by the opportunity\
  \ to write comics featuring the iconic characters we created, but mixing that with\
  \ the chance to script the exploits of characters created by Robert E. Howard (and\
  \ Roy Thomas), Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Frank Frazetta pushes the experience over\
  \ the top for me to the point that it's become a real creative highlight of my career.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Worldscape</em></a> also provides me with the opportunity to work\
  \ up official Pathfinder RPG game statistics for some of these legendary heroes.\
  \ As with previous <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\"\
  >Pathfinder comics</a> series, each issue of Worldscape contains a short RPG appendix\
  \ and a pull-out miniatures-scale poster map. The first issue naturally leads with\
  \ official game statistics for Red Sonja, one of Dynamite's flagship characters\
  \ and one of the true pillars of sword &amp; sorcery comics. Putting together Red\
  \ Sonja's Pathfinder stats was a fascinating experience in game design and creative\
  \ adaptation, and in the process of making it all work it occurred to me that it\
  \ might be fun to open up my creative process a bit here on the Paizo blog, and\
  \ discuss—step by step—my thought process on bringing these characters to life—\
  Pathfinder style.</p> \n    <p>So, welcome to the first installment of the Worldscape\
  \ Workbook, where I plan to do just that, on a more or less weekly basis. Throughout\
  \ the month leading up to the Worldscape series and during the release of the issues\
  \ themselves, I'll be opening up my brain here every Wednesday (because Wednesday\
  \ is new comic book day!) and letting you know what went into adapting these characters,\
  \ and why I made some of the decisions I did.</p> \n    <p>Even though I'm taking\
  \ the design lead on this project, of course there are lots of other people involved,\
  \ giving me suggestions, modifying my mistakes, and generally snickering about my\
  \ bad decisions directly to my face in advance, ideally to spare me from all of\
  \ you laughing in my face after the issue comes out, and it is too late to do anything\
  \ about it. These conversations have taught me a lot about the design philosophy\
  \ at play within Paizo's editorial and design department, and as I was sitting there\
  \ thinking about how interesting it was to sink my teeth into this stuff, it occurred\
  \ to me that a lot of you would probably find it pretty interesting, too.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I won't be posting the game statistics here on the blog—you've got to <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9oco\">buy the issue</a> for that—but I do plan to talk about\
  \ why I made certain decisions, and (sometimes just as importantly) why I didn't\
  \ make certain other design decisions (or why I did, and Jason Bulmahn made me change\
  \ it). In the process I'll be revealing some of my own design blind spots and stupidities,\
  \ which I figure some of you will also appreciate.</p> \n    <p>So let's begin at\
  \ the beginning, with the character featured in next month's <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>: RED SONJA!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160921-Worldscape1.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160921-Worldscape1_180.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>In the following weeks, I'll discuss things like Red Sonja's\
  \ statistics, her new sword-devil archetype, her class, her equipment load-out,\
  \ and so on, but first things first. I've got to address the chainmail bikini.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It goes without saying that there is not currently a bikini armor type\
  \ in the Pathfinder RPG, so figuring out the value of Red Sonja's armor wasn't as\
  \ simple as simply picking out something appropriate from the <a href=\"/products/btpy88y\"\
  ><em>Core Rulebook</em></a>. The smallest bit of armor there that's even remotely\
  \ close is the chain shirt, and while the original version of Red Sonja way back\
  \ in the 1970s DID wear a chain shirt (along with some fantastic hotpants), the\
  \ current incarnation wears decidedly less material.</p> \n    <p>As an aside, one\
  \ of my biggest surprises in researching about 100 issues of Red Sonja comics from\
  \ various eras is that her chainmail bikini isn't really chainmail.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160921-Worldscape2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160921-Worldscape2_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>That's more appropriately a type of armor called \"coin\
  \ mail,\" which also isn't in the <a href=\"/products/btpy88y\"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a>,\
  \ in bikini form or otherwise. So my first decision regarding Red Sonja's armor\
  \ was that I was going to have to invent an entirely new type of armor for her,\
  \ which I did:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">New Armor\
  \ Type: Decorative Armor</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">Little more than a few\
  \ small patches of cloth adorned with bits of metal, decorative armor is more a\
  \ fashion statement than practical protection. Despite its impracticality, decorative\
  \ armor can be enchanted with enhancement bonuses and special armor qualities.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Cost</b> 5 gp; <b>Armor Bonus</b> +0; <b>Maximum\
  \ Dex Bonus</b> —; <b>Armor Check Penalty</b> 0; <b>Arcane Spell Failure</b> 5%;\
  \ <b>Speed (30 ft.)</b> 30ft.; <b>Speed (20 ft.)</b> 20 ft.; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>This passed muster with a couple of Paizo's developers,\
  \ but \"decorative armor\" met its match when I passed it by Jason Bulmahn and Owen\
  \ K.C. Stephens, who correctly pointed out that I had created it only as a kludge\
  \ to get Red Sonja enhancement bonuses, and that this type of armor would be too\
  \ tempting to monks and wizards, who would gain all of the upside while suffering\
  \ none of the downside. Jason did thank me for at least putting that 5% spell failure\
  \ chance in there, but I'd only done that as a trick to sneak it by him, and it\
  \ didn't work.</p> \n    <p>So decorative armor was dead, as I pretty much knew\
  \ it would be, and I had to figure out something else. To be honest, I wasn't too\
  \ bothered, as the solution never really worked for me, anyway. Slapping three triangles\
  \ of a dozen silver pieces over your breasts and crotch doesn't really make for\
  \ effective protection of any kind, so facing rejection of my armor solution, I\
  \ went back to my original original idea, which is far, far simpler.</p> \n    <p>Red\
  \ Sonja's chainmail bikini isn't armor at all.</p> \n    <p>Instead, I decided,\
  \ Red Sonja would derive most of her Armor Class from a combination of a naturally\
  \ high Dexterity AND a special ability of her sword-devil archetype.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ an archetype requires a class, and what class is Red Sonja? Check back here next\
  \ week, and I'll tell you!</p> \n    <p>In the meantime, check out a recent interview\
  \ I did with <a href=\"http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/08/23/pathfinder-meets-hyboria-barsoom-golarion-and-more\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Bleeding Cool</a> about the series with lots of details on the\
  \ plot, characters, and how the whole project came together.</p> \n    <p>You might\
  \ also consider setting up a <a href=\"/products/btpy8tvw\">Pathfinder Comics Ongoing\
  \ Subscription</a> to make sure you don't miss the first issue, which hits comic\
  \ stands on October 19th!</p> \n    <p>Thanks for your time, and we'll see you in\
  \ next week's Worldscape Workbook!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
