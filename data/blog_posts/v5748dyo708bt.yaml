  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Iseph pulled\
  \ their hand away from their side. Their fingers were sticky and purple with their\
  \ own synthetic blood. The android winced and calculated the odds of completing\
  \ the contract: <em>67.3%. Suboptimal. </em></p>\n      <p>This bulk freighter was\
  \ supposed to be derelict, but the corridors were crawling with bone troopers and\
  \ starving vacc ghouls. A bone trooper, grinning with its whole skull, perched at\
  \ the controls of a turret and shot Iseph down as they tried to land in the cargo\
  \ bay. The android’s integrated force field took the brunt of the impact, but a\
  \ jagged bit of wreckage pierced Iseph’s side. A medpatch relieved the discomfort\
  \ of severed processors. A few rounds from their semi-auto pistol took care of the\
  \ bone trooper. <br><br></p>\n      <p>Iseph dashed down gloomy corridors toward\
  \ the reactor core, a satchel of explosive charges swinging from their shoulder.\
  \ The priest of Pharasma on Lucent Station who’d hired Iseph was right—this was\
  \ a rogue Corpse Fleet vessel, locked on a collision course with the tiny asteroid\
  \ settlement. An invasion? If so, cracking the reactor apart would prevent untold\
  \ loss of lives.</p>\n      <p>Iseph found the blast door to the reactor sealed.\
  \ A grinning skull icon sneered from the display. A quantum pick from their infiltrator\
  \ kit and a good shove persuaded the cranky door to open. A deep hum throbbed out\
  \ from the murky reactor chamber and a strong whiff of void energies tickled Iseph’\
  s olfactory sensors. This was no derelict freighter.</p>\n      <p>Three grated\
  \ catwalks, stacked one above the other, surrounded the hemispherical reactor far\
  \ below. The blast door spat Iseph out onto the middle deck. Radiation flared the\
  \ operative’s built-in force field. Levels just below redline, but that wasn’t the\
  \ problem. The starving pack of vacc ghouls on the catwalk above was.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p><em>Recalculating. There is now a 53.5% chance of successfully completing\
  \ the contract. </em>Lucent Station required better odds.</p>\n      <p>An emaciated\
  \ ghoul dangled from the cables above, waving a cutlass-shaped grindblade. Iseph\
  \ sighted it through the sniper scope and blew it screaming to the reactor pile\
  \ below. Another pair dropped in front of them waving grindblades. Iseph batted\
  \ one slash away, gritting their teeth as dermal plating took the blow. That ghoul\
  \ staggered out into midair and vanished. The android flipped their rifle around\
  \ and bashed the second one, then drew their pistol and fired three rounds into\
  \ its head. A third ghoul clambered like a spider along the underside of the catwalk\
  \ right into the last sniper round.</p>\n      <p><em>Recalculating…75% chance of\
  \ success</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>Iseph’s next target was a tangle of vapor-swaddled\
  \ conduits that rose up from the core, braided through the catwalk levels. A coffin-like\
  \ emergency shunt sat on the deck nearby. An explosion there would reverberate up\
  \ and down the conduits, maximizing a chain reaction.</p>\n      <p>Iseph gripped\
  \ their side as they limped towards the shunt. A hulking creature emerged from the\
  \ vapor clouds. Tall as a standard human, but twice as broad, it was composed of\
  \ hunks of oozing flesh. A blue-and-silver armored coat festooned with the rank\
  \ badges of an admiral barely contained its squirming flesh. The admiral grinned\
  \ at Iseph with sharp, rotten teeth and swung a massive grindblade to the ready.\
  \ A pair of rigor mortics, constructs of raw flesh and armor plating with integrated\
  \ shields, lumbered into flanking positions.</p>\n      <p><em>Recalculating…50%\
  \ probability of success.</em></p>\n      <p>Predictably, the rigor mortics charged\
  \ forward shields first to shove Iseph off the catwalk. The admiral advanced behind\
  \ them, wheezing in sharp, lungless gasps that the android hypothesized were an\
  \ attempt at laughter.</p>\n      <p>Iseph grabbed one of the shields and yanked\
  \ it clean from the rigor mortic’s bony grip, then plunged the zero knife into a\
  \ visual organ. Silvery-black ichor streamed from the wound. Iseph slammed the pistol\
  \ to its forehead, pulled the trigger, and sent the undead plunging headless into\
  \ the reactor.</p>\n      <p>Iseph vaulted over the other rigor mortic, slicing\
  \ a bundle of cables that festooned the deck. The cut cables vented steam and coolant,\
  \ twisting on the deck like live serpents. The hapless rigor mortic became entangled\
  \ in the coils. The android emptied the entire magazine of their pistol into its\
  \ bulbous head, spattering gore across the deck.</p>\n      <p><em>Ammo depleted.\
  \ Odds at 52%.</em><br><br></p>\n      <p>Snarling at the demise of its rigor mortics,\
  \ the admiral lunged at Iseph with the heavy grindblade. Iseph hurled the zero knife\
  \ and the cold blade buried itself deep in the admiral’s neck. Pus boiled from the\
  \ wound, but the monster just laughed as it continued to advance.</p>\n      <p>Iseph\
  \ grabbed one of the cut cables and swung out over the abyss. The grindblade whooshed\
  \ through the empty radioactive gloom where Iseph had been only moments before.<br><br></p>\n\
  \      <p><em>45%. <br><br></em></p>\n      <p>Momentarily clear of the catwalk,\
  \ Iseph unclipped the incendiary grenade at their belt with a free hand and pulled\
  \ the electronic pin. Then they tossed the grenade at the admiral. The brute vanished\
  \ in the explosion, leaving behind only jagged pieces of bone and metal. Iseph swung\
  \ back to the catwalk and landed safely on deck.</p>\n      <p><em>Increasing probability\
  \ of success: 89%</em>.</p>\n      <p>Iseph approached the emergency shunt, reaching\
  \ for a charge. They stopped short at the flow viewport. Inside, instead of a reactor\
  \ feed there was a humanoid face. The humanoid was young, and softly glowing vermilion\
  \ arcs traced across their features. An android. Distorted black veins of void energy\
  \ pulsed in parallel swirls alongside their circuitry. The necrotization of tissue\
  \ indicated a 35% chance the android was a borai or some other type of undead.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Iseph stepped back, still clutching the charges. This “shunt” was nothing\
  \ more than a sarcophagus hooked up directly to the reactor. What kind of being\
  \ would need to draw that much power?</p>\n      <p>There was a high probability\
  \ this android was a necrovite waiting to be reborn in undeath. The android’s eyelids\
  \ flew open and met Iseph’s searching gaze with their own. Their curious expression\
  \ melted to pure terror. Though the operative couldn’t hear their cries through\
  \ the thick portal, the meaning was clear: <em>Help me!</em></p>\n      <p>Iseph\
  \ glanced at the explosives in their hands. They could help free the android one\
  \ way—or another. Was this a ruse? <em>Processing new directive.</em><em>Odds for\
  \ success: Unable to calculate.</em> Iseph placed the charges in standby and back\
  \ in their bag. They toggled the latches on the sarcophagus. Clouds of vapor smelling\
  \ like decaying plant matter spilled from the hatch.</p>\n      <p>The creature\
  \ dropped to their knees and gasped. Trailing wires and tubes kept them connected\
  \ to the machinery in the sarcophagus. “Thank you,” they whispered.</p>\n      <p>Iseph\
  \ visualized half a dozen martial strikes to neutralize the kneeling android, but\
  \ remained still, curiously moved by their stark vulnerability. “What were you doing\
  \ in there?”</p>\n      <p>The other shrugged. “They t-took me.”</p>\n      <p><em>“\
  Who</em> took you?”</p>\n      <p>“Don’t remember. But I didn’t w-want to go.” The\
  \ other’s voice was shaky, indicating confusion and anxiety. Iseph considered that.\
  \ They, too, had once woken up not remembering.</p>\n      <p>“I have a directive\
  \ to destroy this place,” Iseph advised.</p>\n      <p>The necrotized android regarded\
  \ Iseph warily. They stood as the umbilical tubes detached with wet pops and examined\
  \ themself as if for the first time, another familiar act. Something stirred in\
  \ Iseph.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>“Do w-what you must. I won’t stop y-you,” the other\
  \ said.</p>\n      <p>“You won’t,” Iseph agreed, strangely conflicted about that\
  \ answer. They set a charge against the power coupling of the sarcophagus and armed\
  \ it. Shunt or not, the device was still connected directly to the reactor.</p>\n\
  \      <p><em>94% chance of success. </em></p>\n      <p>“I’m Avel.” The other’\
  s eyes glimmered with vermilion light.</p>\n      <p>“Iseph. You should come with\
  \ me.”</p>\n      <p>Avel arched a glowing brow. “Are you sure? I don’t know to\
  \ what purpose I’ve been set.”</p>\n      <p>Iseph shook their head and set the\
  \ rest of the charges. “Then find your own purpose. Everyone should have that chance.”\
  \ Avel looked around at the cavernous ship of the dead, considering. Calculating\
  \ their own odds, maybe? Iseph checked their remote detonator and set it on standby.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Let’s leave this wretched place, Iseph,” Avel said with a shudder. They\
  \ found the escape pods three decks above. No bone troopers or rigor mortics impeded\
  \ them. Perhaps Avel was repelling them with a secret signal. Iseph opened the pod’\
  s hatch and ushered Avel inside. The other android hesitated.</p>\n      <p>“Will\
  \ they accept me where we’re going?” Avel asked. Iseph shrugged. The Pharasman priest\
  \ would likely need to be <em>persuaded</em>. Iseph could handle that.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>A huge shadow crashed into Iseph, knocking them to the deck. The detonator\
  \ skittered from their hand. The admiral towered over Iseph, its flesh charred and\
  \ suppurating from the grenade blast. Its jaw hung loose, enhancing its vicious\
  \ grin. It held the splintered ends of the grindblade against Iseph’s throat. Avel\
  \ stepped over to the detonator and picked it up. Was this betrayal after all? Iseph\
  \ began to calculate the probability. Avel smiled and thumbed the button.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p>The deck shook and the admiral toppled back. Iseph kipped up to their\
  \ feet, feeling their medpatch—and the artificial flesh beneath it—tear open in\
  \ a new arc of fire. Iseph ignored the painful sensory stimulus and shoved Avel\
  \ into the pod. They crawled in after, sealing the hatch.</p>\n      <p>The admiral’\
  s howling face appeared at the viewport. Iseph slammed the launch trigger and the\
  \ escape pod blasted into space. In the distance, the freighter’s hull spasmed as\
  \ explosions in the reactor tore it apart. Lucent Station, still just a speck of\
  \ spinning rock in the forward viewport, was safe.</p>\n      <p><em>Mission Complete.\
  \ </em>Or was it? Avel stared at their destination, expression tight.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>“I don’t know what they did to me, Iseph. I could be a danger to the ones\
  \ you saved.” Avel said. Iseph shook their head, wondering at this unexpected deviation\
  \ from their mission. Avel had not been part of their calculations before, but they\
  \ certainly were now.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     \
