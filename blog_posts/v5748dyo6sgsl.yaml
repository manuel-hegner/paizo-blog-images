  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">This month is an exciting\
  \ month for Starfinder Society, as we’re set to release the second wave of adventures\
  \ for our second season. These scenarios are pretty important to the team, as they\
  \ represent two different things: the new and the old.</p> \n     <p>Bringing in\
  \ “the new” we have <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn7?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-203-The-Withering-World\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #2-03: The Withering World,</a> a quest pack containing\
  \ five smaller sized adventures, written by Arc Riley, Jennifer Povey, Jessica Catalan,\
  \ Rigby Bendele, and Shahreena Shahrani. Each of these authors brings a unique style\
  \ and interesting encounters into a story that has the Starfinder Society exploring\
  \ a new world locked in an impossible orbit between a sun and a black hole. The\
  \ arrival of some particularly nasty cultists complicates matters, and the PCs need\
  \ to step in to prevent an entire unexplored world from tumbling into the nearby\
  \ stellar phenomena! This quest pack is particularly exciting because it’s Starfinder\
  \ Society’s first such pack to include five quests, which should provide more content\
  \ for those looking to run these events at their local gaming space. (For upcoming\
  \ quest series, we’ll likely be jumping between four and five quests each—whatever\
  \ makes the most sense for the story). This pack also has the Repeatable tag, bringing\
  \ it into our growing stable of repeatable content that players can use to level\
  \ up and explore the setting with new characters.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  >Illustration by Beatrice Pelagatti</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Our second July\
  \ scenario takes a look at something older and expands the fan-beloved story for\
  \ the false moon of Salvation’s End. The strange moon contains many secrets and\
  \ veteran freelancer Matt Duval didn’t back away from tackling the next big part\
  \ of the Salvation’s End storyline. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn8?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-204-Futures-Fall\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #2-04: Future's Fall</a> brings us back inside the\
  \ moon to enter one of its mysterious vaults; don’t worry, this scenario acts perfectly\
  \ as a stand-alone mission and doesn’t require that players have any prior knowledge\
  \ about the false moon (though playing <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #1-09: Live Exploration Extreme!</a> and <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpya0dv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-120-Duskmire-Accord-9\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #1-20: Duskmire Accord 9</a> can certainly help!) Matt\
  \ is no stranger to writing for Paizo, as he’s written the incredibly successful\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpya0a3\">Starfinder Society Scenario #1-19:\
  \ To Conquer the Dragon</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9wer\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</a>, both of which seem\
  \ to have dragons on the cover—Spoiler: there’s no dragons in this scenario. What\
  \ Future’s Fall does have in store for the PCs is the opportunity to travel to a\
  \ theoretical future where the Pact Worlds as we know it is gone, and the cause\
  \ of this collapse may be related to a very real threat that has yet to pass. Methinks\
  \ there’s some big hints in this scenario for possible future* events, and players\
  \ interested in the ongoing Starfinder Society storyline are going to want to play\
  \ it as soon as they can schedule it.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ scenario to the planet Castrovel for a bit of a historic reenactment and then\
