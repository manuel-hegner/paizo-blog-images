  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Keith here to kick off the first in a long\
  \ series of blogs discussing the new versions of the iconic characters that we did\
  \ in Core. When designing these characters, we did things in roughly this order:</p>\
  \ \n     <ol> \n      <li>Delve into the character’s current backstory.</li> \n\
  \      <li>Evaluate the character’s capabilities in the RPG.</li> \n      <li>Examine\
  \ the character’s new art.</li> \n      <li>Examine every old version of the character\
  \ to cherry-pick the best parts (using designer definitions of best).</li> \n  \
  \    <li>Focus on powers and capabilities that would feel good in any and every\
  \ adventure we make from here on out.</li> \n      <li>Make sure the final result\
  \ feels different enough in play from the previous versions that veterans aren’\
  t bored.</li> \n     </ol> \n     <p>Some things changed with Pathfinder’s new edition,\
  \ like Valeros using a shield, Harsk dual-wielding axes, Fumbus... existing. Little\
  \ things like that.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20190423-Sajan.jpg\"\

  \ from the multiple blessings and punching to focus on his use of slashing weapons,\
  \ particularly that temple sword he’s often holding. This version was dubbed <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5li0f?I-Do-Not-Seek-Answers-But-Rather-to\"\

  \ huge quality of life improvement for a class that’s supposed to feel agile.</p>\

  \ RPG, and one aspect that I felt we could focus more on is how versatile and well-rounded\
  \ monks are in the RPGs. Or, at least, try to be. They are great at all saves, have\
  \ a fair number of useful skills, and really like having a good Strength, Dexterity,\
  \ Constitution, and Wisdom. Monks are pretty much the example class for Multiple\
  \ Ability Dependence, where you need more abilities than you can afford to increase.\
  \ Core tries to emphasize the monk’s versatility in a few ways by giving Sajan a\
  \ more human monk-like array of “okay but not great” stats, and by letting you be\
  \ “pretty good” (though not great) at more things by recharging your blessings on\
  \ any check and having more skills. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ Sajan derives from Core that isn’t obvious at face value is that Core has so many\
  \ more diverse blessings. As a character who likely blesses every turn, with blessings\
  \ as his primary card type, this lets you really customize Sajan’s deck in an interesting\
  \ way. Want to be ready to avenge? Pack a Calistria’s Sting. Want extra dice against\
  \ monsters, and you’re okay fighting the occasional summon? Grandmother Nightmare\
  \ has your back. Nothing to worry about there.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ since you’re probably rolling a bunch of dice at most things, but you don’t necessarily\
  \ have a great bonus. Padaprajnas master all aspects of warfare, so that role offers\
  \ better skill and proficiency with weapons alongside improved teamwork feats. Iroran\
  \ Dedicant focuses more on perfection of self, improving his unarmed fighting skills\
  \ and giving him ways to turn any roll into success. Iroran Dedicant also offers\
  \ a unique ability (not for everyone) to shift around your skill and card feats\
  \ as you play, letting you adapt to different adventures and correct past choices\
  \ you might regret.</p> \n     <p>And that’s our new Sajan. In testing, we found\
  \ him more flexible and interesting to play and advance. Hopefully, you’re enjoying\
  \ him too!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
