  \ href=\"/products/btpy9e44\">Pirate's Prophecy<i></i></a><i>, Captain Torius Vin\
  \ has given up the pirate life in order to bring freedom to others. Along with his\
  \ loyal crew and Celeste, the ship's snake-bodied navigator and Torius's one true\
  \ love, the captain of the Stargazer uses a lifetime of piratical tricks to capture\
  \ slave galleys and set the prisoners free. But when the crew's old friend and secret\
  \ agent Vreva Jhafe uncovers rumors of a terrifying new magical weapon in devil-ruled\
  \ Cheliax—one capable of wiping the abolitionist nation of Andoran off the map—\
  will even their combined forces be enough to stop a navy backed by Hell itself?</i></p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter 3: Prophecy and Deception</h2> \n     <p>Water\
  \ as dark as a devil's soul slipped past <i>Stargazer</i>'s hull. The hiss of foam,\
  \ creak of wood, and occasional flap of canvas would have been soothing to Celeste\
  \ if not for the low scudding clouds that blocked the moon and stars. She felt stifled,\
  \ as if a blanket of ignorance had been pulled over her head. Even the steady, familiar\
  \ scuff of Torius's boots as he paced the quarterdeck couldn't assuage her frazzled\
  \ nerves. </p> \n     <p><i>Without the stars, I'm blind.</i></p> \n     <p>They\
  \ were following their usual indirect route to Almas, first sailing southeast toward\
  \ Osirion to avoid any encounter with the Chelish navy, but had yet to make their\
  \ turn northeast toward their true destination. Unfortunately, with the continuous\
  \ low overcast, Celeste had been unable to accurately fix their position for several\
  \ days. She only knew that they were approaching the Garund coast. Dead reckoning\
  \ put them somewhere north of the Alamein Peninsula, but without the stars, her\
  \ estimate could easily be off by fifty miles. Even if they missed the peninsula\
  \ itself, such an error could put them on the unforgiving rocks of the Coast of\
  \ Graves.</p> \n     <p><i>Who names places like that</i>? She stared southward\
  \ and saw nothing but blackness. Where was the light at Djedefar? <i>Could the monks\
  \ have let it go dark for some reason? </i>Celeste tried to keep her tail from twitching.\
  \ Generations of mariners had used the light of the tower for navigation—not because\
  \ it was a designated lighthouse, but because monks faithful to Irori kept the Stepped\
  \ Tower lit for their own inscrutable reasons. Had she missed some significant date\
  \ or convergence of the stars that would signify a darkening of the beacon? Not\
  \ seeing the stars for two days was bad enough. Approaching an unseen shore only\
  \ made her more nervous.</p> \n     <p>Torius paused behind her, so close she could\
  \ taste his intimately familiar scent on her sensitive tongue. The brush of his\
  \ hand along her smooth scales eased her anxiety a little.</p> \n     <p>\"Don't\
  \ worry, love. The mercury in the weatherglass has been rising since sunset. The\
  \ stars will show themselves soon.\" The confidence in Torius's voice might have\
  \ been affected, but it was welcome.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Right now I'm more worried\
  \ about rocks than stars. I hate approaching a shore in the dark with no solid navigational\
  \ fix.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's quiet enough to hear surf from a mile off, and we\
  \ can tack in a heartbeat if we spot the shore. I just want to get a solid position\
  \ fix so we can set a proper course.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I know.\" Without the stars,\
  \ a sighting of shoreside landmarks was the only sure way to know where they were.\
  \ \"It concerns me that we haven't seen the light of the Stepped Tower. If there's\
  \ fog on the coast—\"</p> \n     <p>\"There!\" Torius pointed low on the eastern\
  \ horizon. \"A break in the clouds.\"</p> \n     <p>Celeste caught sight of a single\
  \ star glimmering to the east through the overcast for a moment before it vanished.\
  \ More gaps in the clouds gave tantalizing glimpses of the heavens, but were too\
  \ fleeting to distinguish constellations or identify individual stars. Celeste glanced\
  \ at the rack of hour and minute glasses she used to keep time, and quickly calculated\
  \ where the planets would be in the sky. Those she could identify even without constellations,\
  \ but none of them shone through the overcast yet.</p> \n     <p><i>Bretheda, Verces,\
  \ Castrovel </i><i>...</i><i>where are you, my dears</i>?</p> \n     <p>Celeste\
  \ floated up her silver sextant in preparation. All she needed was a clear sighting\
  \ on two of the three planets, and she would have their position.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  There!\" She caught sight of Bretheda and raised her sextant to take a sighting.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A glint of red light on the instrument's polished silver caught her\
  \ eye. At first she thought it was a reflection of the lamp from the binnacle compass,\
  \ but the helm was behind her, blocked by her body. Lowering the sextant, she stared\
  \ into the darkness, scanning the invisible horizon from windward to leeward. <i>Nothing</i>.\
  \ <i>What the</i>... Then she looked up. A faint glow pulsed red through the thick,\
  \ low clouds directly in front of the ship. Even as she opened her mouth to cry\
  \ out a warning, the color shifted to purple, and Celeste knew exactly what it was.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Torius! The Hor-Aha light!\"</p> \n     <p>At the same moment, the\
  \ lookout shouted down, \"Light off the port bow! Up in the clouds!\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The Hor-Aha tower loomed out of the heavy mist not four ship-lengths ahead.\
  \ Deadly stonework soared hundreds of feet high, a line of white surf frothing about\
  \ the razor-sharp rocks at its base.</p> \n     <p>\"Wear ship!\" Torius thundered.\
  \ \"Sheet in the main! Man the braces!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Helm's hard astarboard!\"\
  \ Windy Kate called out as she hauled the big wheel over.</p> \n     <p>The crew\
  \ responded like a well-oiled machine. Feet pounded down the deck, and callused\
  \ hands pulled frantically on lines. Surf rumbled over black rocks a stone's throw\
  \ off the port side. The deck leveled briefly as <i>Stargazer</i> turned downwind,\
  \ then the heavy mainsail boom swept overhead with a lurch, and the deck heeled\
  \ sharply to port as they rounded to the north. The rack of finely calibrated sand\
  \ glasses and the small leather bag with Celeste's instruments started to slide\
  \ toward the edge of the deck. She snatched the bag up with magic, and slithered\
  \ to block the heavier rack of sand glasses with her coils. </p> \n     <p>As the\
  \ brigantine steadied on her new course, slipping easily through the sea once again,\
  \ Celeste watched Hor-Aha's lurid red shift to deep purple, then vanish into the\
  \ mists in the ship's wake. The ancient lighthouse had once served as a navigational\
  \ aid and warning for pending storms to Osirian ships, but the light had gone dark\
  \ ages ago. Only recently had the light renewed, though it now only showed red and\
  \ purple, the chromatic code for violent gales. Rumors about haunts and curses abounded,\
  \ and the weather and currents around the spire were unnatural and unpredictable.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Well, <i>that</i> was close.\" Torius plucked the rack of sand glasses\
  \ from Celeste's coils and put it down on the upwind side of the quarterdeck. Nervous\
  \ laughter sounded around the middeck as the crew settled from the near catastrophe.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Too close.\" She put her bag of instruments down beside the rack,\
  \ and glared down at the chart she'd pinned to the deck. \"We're forty miles <i>east</i>\
  \ of where I had us plotted. There must have been a countercurrent off the Alamein\
  \ Peninsula that pulled us off course.\" </p> \n     <p>\"Don't fret about it. I\
  \ told you we could turn in a heartbeat.\" Torius caressed her scales and smiled.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Celeste fought to still her pounding heart as she looked to the east.\
  \ More stars winked in the sky along the horizon as the overcast broke up. \"Of\
  \ course, <i>now</i> I can get sightings, since I no longer need them.\" She snatched\
  \ a pencil out of her bag and marked an X on the chart right next to the symbol\
  \ representing the ancient lighthouse.</p> \n     <p>\"Gozreh's luck.\" Torius brushed\
  \ her cheek with the back of his knuckles. \"Good eye spotting the light.\" </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Thank you.\" Celeste smiled and leaned into the caress. Between her\
  \ lover's touch and the stars now twinkling overhead, her stress slowly ebbed away.\
  \ She drew a deep, calming breath and gazed skyward.</p> \n     <p>\"After days\
  \ of clouds, it's no wonder you're tense... \" Torius pulled her close. \"I'll leave\
  \ you to enjoy the stars. We're headed for open sea, so I won't need a fix for the\
  \ rest of my watch.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Very well, my captain.\" Grogul wouldn't come\
  \ up for the morning watch for an hour, so Celeste tucked her instruments back into\
  \ her case. </p> \n     <p>Raising her face to the sky, she took in the beauty of\
  \ the emerging stars. As the blanket of clouds swept to leeward, the heavens unfolded\
  \ like a mound of glittering treasure. Overhead marched the constellations of the\
  \ Cosmic Caravan, the planets scattered among them like brilliant escorts. For a\
  \ little while, she tried to put aside her worries and just enjoy the view.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Spies</i>... Never had Celeste thought that they would one day be\
  \ trafficking secrets in a covert war for freedom. She remembered when freedom meant\
  \ sailing the sea in search of plunder, taking fat merchant ships, stealing their\
  \ illicit or smuggled cargo, and selling the ill-gotten prizes in Katapesh's dark\
  \ markets. Now freedom meant fighting to free others, sailing the same circuitous\
  \ route from Almas to Ostenso month after month, living in a ship full of lies.\
  \ Glancing at the crew toiling about the deck, she wondered if any shared her misgivings.\
  \ Torius's choice to get involved in Andoran's covert war against slavery had very\
  \ nearly destroyed them all, but not a single member of the crew had abandoned ship.\
  \ </p> \n     <p><i>They'll never abandon their captain, and neither would I, but</i>...\
  \ <i>is this the only life for us</i>?</p> \n     <p>Panged by guilt, Celeste gazed\
  \ up at the stars. She often sought guidance in the heavens, seeking answers among\
  \ the paths of the planets among the constellations. She had faith in the cosmos.\
  \ It wasn't capricious or vindictive, and didn't take sides in right and wrong,\
  \ good and evil. Its message might not always be easy to interpret, but the stars\
  \ never lied. Tonight, Bretheda—the Cradle—shone from within the Stargazer, Celeste's\
  \ birth sign, which had no immediate significance, and Castrovel approached the\
  \ Lantern Bearer, which was Torius's. Celeste smiled. She'd never really noticed\
  \ an increase in her lover's libido when the planet of lust and fertility crossed\
  \ his sign.</p> \n     <p><i>Perhaps I'll start taking data</i>. </p> \n     <p>The\
  \ only other planet in the sky, Verces, glimmered between the constellations of\
  \ the Stranger and the Follower. <i>Interesting</i>... Verces, the Line, signified\
  \ choice<i>. Between a stranger and a follower? How might that apply to us</i>?\
  \ The answer was there, if only she could discern it. <i>If I could just see it\
  \ clearly in the stars, hear it in the song of the heavens</i>.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ celestial chorus sang through her soul... </p> \n     <p>\"Sails!\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Celeste blinked. To the east, the sky glowed with the light of dawn. Hours\
  \ had passed since Torius had left her to her musing. She'd lost herself among the\
  \ stars yet again, oblivious to the bustle of sailors around her, undisturbed even\
  \ by the changing of the watch. <i>Damn it</i>... Celeste felt as if a piece of\
  \ her life had been stolen away, angry at her lapse, but also frightened at her\
  \ loss of control.</p> \n     <p>\"Where away, and what type of sails?\" Grogul's\
  \ bellow to the masthead lookout rattled Celeste's eardrums.</p> \n     <p>\"Southeast,\"\
  \ came Lacy Jane's answer. \"Lateen rig. Two masts, but it's too dark to tell the\
  \ color. She's hull down. Could be a felucca or a galley.\"</p> \n     <p>A felucca\
  \ meant a merchant or fisherman. A galley could be a slaver.</p> \n     <p>Celeste\
  \ opened her case and lifted out her telescope with a flick of magic. It was a far\
  \ finer instrument than any other aboard. \"Grogul.\" She floated the telescope\
  \ to him. \"Do you want to send this up to Lacy?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Sure, if you\
  \ promise not to bite me if it goes overboard.\" He knew she cherished the instrument,\
  \ and obviously appreciated the offer.</p> \n     <p>Celeste knew he was joking,\
  \ but smiled to show her fangs. \"I promise. I haven't bitten anyone in <i>days</i>!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Thanks.\" Grogul turned to his bosun's mate. \"Kalli, run this\
  \ up to Lacy.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Aye!\" Kalli the gillman tucked the telescope through\
  \ her belt and climbed up the ratlines, her webbed hands and feet sure on the ropes.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In moments, Lacy Jane called down, \"Galley! Yellow sails! She's turning\
  \ north!\"</p> \n     <p>\"They're turning to follow us.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Seems\
  \ that way.\" Grogul's predatory grin spoke volumes. He shouted orders to the crew.\
  \ \"Maintain course, but slack the sheets to slow us down a bit. Someone wake the\
  \ captain.\"</p> \n     <p>Celeste looked to the sky, but the light of dawn had\
  \ already dimmed the stars. She would get no more guidance from there, but she remembered\
  \ her earlier observations. <i>Verces between the Stranger and the Follower. A choice</i>...\
  \ As usual, the signs could be interpreted numerous ways. If the ship they'd spotted\
  \ was the follower, who was the stranger? Or perhaps the choice wasn't between a\
  \ follower and a stranger, but between fleeing or fighting the stranger who followed\
  \ them? If they chose to fight, they risked more than the ship and their lives,\
  \ for they carried Vreva's coded logbook, a repository of secrets invaluable to\
  \ the Andoren cause. They could never let slavers get their hands on that book.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Torius and Thillion hurried up to the quarterdeck. Snick followed, rubbing\
  \ her eyes, her sea-green hair sticking up at all angles. She dyed it blue for her\
  \ disguise in Ostenso, but insisted on washing it clean every time they left port,\
  \ just like she insisted upon changing the identity of the ship from <i>Sea Serpent</i>\
  \ to <i>Stargazer</i>.</p> \n     <p>\"Looks like an Okeno slaver, sir,\" Grogul\
  \ reported. \"Still hull down, but they've turned to follow. I slacked sheets to\
  \ slow us, and in this light wind, they'll catch up quickly. We should get a better\
  \ look soon.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Thanks, Grogul.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Couldn't you have\
  \ waited until after breakfast to bellow like a bull elephant?\" Snick glared up\
  \ at the bosun and tried to smooth her hair.</p> \n     <p>\"Sorry to interrupt\
  \ your beauty sleep. I know you need it.\" Grogul grinned down at her, showing his\
  \ tusks.</p> \n     <p>The gnome made a face. \"You should get some, too.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"We could lure them in and take them, Captain.\" Thillion squinted\
  \ to the south, his elven eyes sharper than theirs by far. \"Unless she turns out\
  \ to be as big as the <i>Bloody Scourge</i>, of course.\"</p> \n     <p>Celeste\
  \ could only agree. That ship had very nearly been the death of them all.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"We may have to let this one pass.\" Torius squinted at the sea and sky,\
  \ obviously gauging the variables that might affect their chances. From his frown,\
  \ he was also undoubtedly thinking about Vreva's logbook. He turned to Celeste and\
  \ cocked an eyebrow. \"Unless you have some insight from the stars?\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"I don't... \" Celeste paused and considered the choice that faced them.\
  \ <i>Should we fight and risk Vreva's book</i>?</p> \n     <p>\"Yes.\" The answer\
  \ came out of Celeste's mouth before she knew what she was saying. She had no idea\
  \ where the overwhelming feeling of promise had come from, but it couldn't be denied.\
  \ The song of the heavens sang it loud in her soul, a familiar rightness, just as\
  \ when she'd considered facing Lothera Cothos.</p> \n     <p>Everyone looked at\
  \ her in surprise.</p> \n     <p>\"You <i>do</i> have some guidance from the stars?\"\
  \ Thillion sounded dubious.</p> \n     <p>Torius had learned to respect her astrological\
  \ prophecies, but knew better than to ask for specific information. Long experience\
  \ had taught him that her predictions were fraught with uncertainty, often only\
  \ becoming clear in retrospect. The rest of the crew still often saw her prophecies\
  \ as more troublesome than accurate. But this time, she was certain.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Yes, I have. The choice is clear. We should take them.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Captain!\" Lacy Jane called down from the foretop. \"She's hull up! One deck of\
  \ oars, and she's pulling hard! They're coming after us!\"</p> \n     <p>Torius\
  \ turned to Celeste. The slaver wasn't so large that <i>Stargazer</i> couldn't take\
  \ her, but there was still doubt in his eyes. \"You're <i>sure</i>?\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"I'm sure, my captain.\" Celeste reared up, more sure of this than she had\
  \ been about anything lately. \"We should take that ship. Trust me!\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Torius grinned. \"I was hoping you'd say that.\" He turned to his officers.\
  \ \"We take them! Thillion, I like your idea of luring them in. Let's make like\
  \ we're a merchant fleeing in panic. Grogul, something aloft is going to break.\
  \ Nothing catastrophic, just enough to foul the rigging and kill our speed. You'll\
  \ command the main boarding party amidships.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Aye, sir!\" The half-orc\
  \ hefted his axe and thumbed the razor edge.</p> \n     <p>\"Snick, put the <i>Sea\
  \ Serpent</i> placards back on, and load your babies with the usual tricks. We'll\
  \ take them by surprise.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Surprises are my specialty, Captain!\"\
  \ The gnome scurried off to tend her ballistae. <i>Stargazer</i> would look like\
  \ a benign merchant until the cunningly disguised firing ports opened and the tips\
  \ of six of Snick's specialized ballista warheads nosed out.</p> \n     <p>\"Thillion,\
  \ you and your archers will rake their deck from our forecastle as they come alongside,\
  \ then board and continue the barrage from their own foredeck.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Yes, sir.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8531-Cover.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8531-Cover_500.jpeg\"></a>\n     \
  \ <br><i>Illustration by Remko Troost</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>\"Celeste, you,\
  \ Windy, and the bosun's mates will board aft with me. Once we've cleared their\
  \ quarterdeck, I want you to rake their middeck with your spells.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  It'll be my pleasure.\" Celeste's heart raced in anticipation of the battle. Having\
  \ suffered in chains herself, there were few things in life she enjoyed more than\
  \ blasting slavers with destructive magic.</p> \n     <p>\"Good! Windy, start steering\
  \ wild. Grogul, tell the crew to handle the sheets and braces like lubbers. Thillion,\
  \ pick your archers and stand ready. Remember, we're merchants until the trap is\
  \ sprung!\"</p> \n     <p>Canvas and tangled cordage flapped in the wind, and sailors\
  \ scurried around the deck in apparent panic. The slaver was closing fast, near\
  \ enough now that Torius could read the placard on her bow. The <i>Golden Chain</i>\
  \ bore a figurehead of a woman bound in gilded manacles and a collar.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Keep coming, you bastard.\" Torius lowered his glass and turned to shout\
  \ panicked orders to his crew. They had to play this right. If the slaver got a\
  \ whiff of the trap, they would rake <i>Stargazer</i> with arrows and ballista bolts\
  \ from afar. But Torius had learned how to play on slavers' greed by appearing vulnerable.\
  \ To traffickers in flesh, sailors were potential merchandise, not to be damaged\
  \ unless they resisted. Few merchantmen could offer much of a fight. Most would\
  \ choose slavery over death.</p> \n     <p>Torius knew better. He'd die before he\
  \ became a slave again.</p> \n     <p>\"Yaw to starboard, Windy. We're panicked,\
  \ remember.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Shakin' in my boots, sir.\" She grinned at him and\
  \ hauled the wheel to starboard, her strong right hand working in concert with the\
  \ hook-and-pike combination that had replaced her left. A slaver had taken that\
  \ hand some months ago. Already, Windy had filed five notches in the pike for the\
  \ slavers she'd killed as payback.</p> \n     <p>\"<i>Sea Serpent!</i> Heave to\
  \ and nobody dies!\" The bellowed command from the bow of the <i>Golden Chain</i>\
  \ brought a cold smile to Torius's lips. </p> \n     <p>Glancing over his shoulder,\
  \ Torius assessed their foe. Slavers armed with nets, grapples, and cutlasses crowded\
  \ the galley's middeck, ready to board. On the forecastle, a ballista crew stood\
  \ ready beside their engine, but the adjacent catapult wasn't even loaded. There\
  \ were no archers. There were, however, more slavers than Torius had counted on.\
  \ He hoped he hadn't underestimated this foe.</p> \n     <p>\"Kalli, ready the colors.\
  \ I want to scare yesterday's breakfast right out of those bastards!\" The instant\
  \ the slavers saw Andoran's flag, they'd know they were in for a fight, and <i>Stargazer</i>\
  \ had a deadly reputation in Okeno. \"Dukkol, pass the word down to Celeste. Two\
  \ minutes.\"</p> \n     <p>The two bosun's mates hurried to comply, the gillman\
  \ clipping the flags to the mainmast halyard, and the one-eyed dwarf thumping down\
  \ the stairs to where Celeste hid inside the sterncastle door. Moments later, the\
  \ dwarf returned, and Torius heard the rasp of scales on the deck beside him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Ready, my captain.\" Celeste's disembodied voice sounded like music\
  \ to his ears.</p> \n     <p>\"Good. You know your target.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Anyone\
  \ who looks like they're about to cast a spell.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Right.\" Recently\
  \ the Okeno slavers had begun contracting powerful wizards to protect their ships.\
  \ Torius winced as he recalled the Gray Corsair <i>Gold Wing</i>, sunk by a blast\
  \ of magic before their eyes. That was another reason he chose to lure their prey\
  \ in for the kill. Up close, a caster was an easier target. With any luck, Celeste\
  \ could neutralize the threat before they had a chance to blast <i>Stargazer</i>\
  \ to kindling.</p> \n     <p>Torius glanced over his shoulder again, trying to look\
  \ scared as he gauged the angles and distances between the two ships. He muttered\
  \ a prayer to Gozreh that Celeste's guidance on this battle would prove true. They\
  \ were taking a serious risk in this venture. He'd probably catch hell from Marshal\
  \ Trellis for putting Vreva's logbook at risk, but they did have to maintain their\
  \ reputation as privateers. That meant actually taking on a slaver now and then.\
  \ Besides, Torius never tired of killing slavers and freeing slaves. The looks on\
  \ their faces—the horror of the slavers and the amazement of the slaves—when they\
  \ realized what was happening made him feel more alive than just about anything\
  \ else in the world.</p> \n     <p>\"Yaw to port, Windy! Keep them guessing.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Aye, sir!\" <i>Stargazer</i> slewed to port. The slaver shifted course\
  \ accordingly.</p> \n     <p>\"<i>Sea Serpent!</i> Heave to, or we'll fire on you!\"\
  \ The crack of a ballista backed their threat, but the warning shot flew harmlessly\
  \ overhead, a holed sail the only damage.</p> \n     <p>\"Don't shoot! We surrender!\"\
  \ Torius dashed to the taffrail, waving his arms in a panic. \"Let fly sheets! Helm\
  \ to windward!\"</p> \n     <p><i>Stargazer</i> turned to starboard and <i>Golden\
  \ Chain</i> back-paddled her starboard sweeps to come alongside. Torius scanned\
  \ the galley's deck, noting the satisfied smiles and laughter among the slavers.\
  \ <i>That's right, just keep laughing</i>... The two ships closed to barely ten\
  \ yards.</p> \n     <p>\"I have the caster, Torius.\" Celeste's voice came from\
  \ right beside him.</p> \n     <p>\"Do it.\"</p> \n     <p>Arcane words flowed,\
  \ harsh and garbled to the captain's ear. Celeste materialized as lightning lashed\
  \ out toward <i>Golden Chain</i>'s quarterdeck. The bolt struck a robed woman there,\
  \ blasting her to the deck in a flutter of smoldering cloaks. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  <i>Stargazer</i>!\" Torius drew his sword and thrust it high, the familiar rush\
  \ of adrenaline surging through his veins.</p> \n     <p>Two flags flew up the mainmast,\
  \ the golden eagle of Andoran on a blue-and-gray shield, and directly beneath it,\
  \ <i>Stargazer</i>'s own long black-and-silver pennant bearing a serpentine silhouette\
  \ of a naga with flowing white hair. Thillion's archers leapt up from hiding to\
  \ rake the galley's forecastle with a deadly volley. The crew of the enemy ballista\
  \ fell, riddled with arrows. <i>Stargazer</i>'s deck shuddered beneath Torius's\
  \ feet as six ballistae cracked in perfect unison. The bolts cleared the galley's\
  \ rail by mere inches, and the triggering tethers came taut, detonating the ceramic\
  \ warheads. Blue-white liquid splashed forth onto the astonished slavers, encasing\
  \ them in freezing alchemical ice. Grogul and his boarders boiled up from the main\
  \ hatchway, heaving grapples to pull the two ships closer.</p> \n     <p>\"Celeste,\
  \ Dukkol, Windy, Kalli, with me!\" The helmswoman and bosun's mates drew weapons\
  \ and ran with him to the rail, but Celeste didn't move. When he glanced back, she\
  \ just stared at him with a questioning look. \"Come on!\"</p> \n     <p>\"<i>Que\
  \ towlre nokta?</i>\" Celeste gaped at him wide-eyed.</p> \n     <p>Torius stared\
  \ at Celeste, trying to interpret what she'd said. \"Celeste! Come on!\" </p> \n\
  \     <p>She blinked at him, uncomprehending, and spoke again, but her words came\
  \ out as a string of gibberish.</p> \n     <p><i>What the hell language is she speaking</i>?\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The two ships met with a crash. Torius couldn't wait, even for\
  \ her. He leapt the rail onto the enemy quarterdeck, parrying a pike thrust even\
  \ before his feet touched the deck. Windy gutted the pikeman as she landed beside\
  \ him, and parried a cutlass with her hook. Kalli lunged to skewer a slaver officer\
  \ through the neck with her rapier. Dukkol bellowed a curse as he took a pike in\
  \ the leg, but his axe clove through his opponent's arms in riposte. More slavers\
  \ closed in on them, pressing them hard. Torius parried wildly, glimpsing the slaver\
  \ captain beyond the flashing blades. The officer knelt over the smoldering form\
  \ of the fallen wizard, a blue glass bottle in one hand. The caster reached up for\
  \ the bottle with one charred hand.</p> \n     <p>\"The caster's still alive!\"\
  \ The Stargazers were holding their own so far, but if the slaver captain healed\
  \ the wizard, they'd be in trouble. \"Celeste!\" </p> \n     <p>Torius couldn't\
  \ break through the flashing blades before him, but the answering crackle of lightning\
  \ was all he'd hoped for. The bolt caught both the wizard and the captain in its\
  \ fury. The caster was reduced to a smoldering corpse, but the captain rolled to\
  \ his feet and drew a pair of hooked silvery hand axes from his belt. Ignoring the\
  \ smoke trailing from his singed jacket, the man charged to the attack.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Torius pressed his opponent hard, slashing through her guard to open a horrible\
  \ gash in her leg. The woman stumbled, and Windy took the opening to slash her cutlass\
  \ across the slaver's neck. The helmswoman took a cut to her other arm from her\
  \ own opponent, but Kalli put her rapier in the slaver's ribs. Dukkol, though limping,\
  \ guarded their flank as more slavers charged up the steps from the middeck to reinforce\
  \ their officers.</p> \n     <p>Torius kicked away the twitching corpse and met\
  \ the captain's attack, parrying one gleaming axe and dodging the other. The man\
  \ was quick, however, and Torius missed his next parry. The slaver's blade ripped\
  \ through the fine mail beneath his shirt, gouging a furrow down his ribs. Pain\
  \ took his breath away and weakened his knees.</p> \n     <p>\"Gozreh's guts!\"\
  \ Torius was no stranger to injuries, but this felt like he'd been plunged into\
  \ boiling oil. He managed to evade the other axe and slash at the man's legs, driving\
  \ him back.</p> \n     <p>The slaver captain grinned maniacally and flourished his\
  \ weapons, which glimmered strangely. \"You're no match for—\"</p> \n     <p>A beam\
  \ of searing energy from Celeste caught the man square in the face. The axes clattered\
  \ to the deck and a horrible scream rose from the slaver captain's blistered lips,\
  \ his hands clawing at eyes charred to cinders in their sockets.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Match that, asshole!\" Torius silenced the captain's screams with a slash of his\
  \ sword. Clutching the wound in his side, he clenched his teeth against the excruciating\
  \ pain and turned to face the enemy charge.</p> \n     <p>Then Celeste was beside\
  \ him, her scales shimmering with a starry radiance. At first, Torius thought it\
  \ was the mesmerizing shimmer she often used to distract an enemy, but the effect\
  \ was different. Instead of her scales shimmering, it looked as if she wore a luminous\
  \ cloak of glittering motes. A slaver lunged at her, and Torius thought the cutlass\
  \ would surely rake her, but the starry nimbus turned the blade before it touched\
  \ her side. Celeste struck like a viper, sinking her fangs into the slaver's throat.\
  \ His screams died in a gurgle, and she flung the twitching corpse aside with a\
  \ twist of her body.</p> \n     <p>Torius spared a moment to assess the battle.\
  \ Thillion and his archers had taken the foredeck, and their bows sang a song of\
  \ death, shots picking off slavers as they struggled against Grogul's boarders.\
  \ Two Stargazers had turned the enemy ballista around to fire down upon the slavers\
  \ crowding the middeck. Snick's ballista crews now fired crossbows from the conjoined\
  \ rails, and Torius spotted the shock of the gnome's green hair as she scrambled\
  \ toward the enemy forecastle. The surprise of their assault had given them a foothold,\
  \ but they were still outnumbered. Here on the quarterdeck, slavers poured up two\
  \ flights of steps to oppose them. Even with Celeste's aid, they were being pressed\
  \ hard. </p> \n     <p>\"Rally!\" he called out in encouragement. \"We've got to\
  \ take the quarterdeck!\"</p> \n     <p>Celeste shouted something unintelligible,\
  \ but her tone bespoke urgency.</p> \n     <p>\"I can't understand a word you're\
  \ saying, Celeste!\" Had the wizard gotten off a spell to tangle her tongue? Torius\
  \ swallowed his worry for her and slashed to drive the enemy back. If they could\
  \ take the quarterdeck, Celeste could rake the middeck with her spells, but not\
  \ while fighting at close quarters.</p> \n     <p>A flight of glowing motes shot\
  \ from the naga to riddle the enemy, and Torius breathed easier. Two dropped their\
  \ weapons, and were instantly skewered, and Dukkol hacked the legs out from under\
  \ another. The Stargazers surged forward, and Torius drove his opponent over the\
  \ forward rail.</p> \n     <p>They had taken the quarterdeck.</p> \n     <p>Lightning\
  \ lashed out from Celeste, arcing the length of the deck to blast a furrow through\
  \ the enemy force. Arrows streaked from the rear of the slaver ranks in reply. Kalli\
  \ took a shaft in the shoulder, and Torius felt a burning sting as one creased his\
  \ thigh, but the one aimed at Celeste glanced off her starry shield.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Nice spell, Celeste!\" He slashed at another slaver trying to regain the\
  \ quarterdeck, sending her tumbling down the steps. \"Dukkol, block the stairs!\
  \ Don't let them get a foothold! We've got to give Celeste cover!\"</p> \n     <p>Celeste\
  \ yelled something else, but still he couldn't understand her. Fortunately, she\
  \ knew her role. Another searing bolt of lightning blasted the enemy force. Grogul\
  \ and his fighters were pressing the slavers against the far rail now, so reduced\
  \ were their numbers. Celeste slithered quickly to the port side of the quarterdeck.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Guard the stairs!\" Torius commanded the others. \"Nobody gets—\"\
  \ His orders died on his lips as a burly slaver with a hooked falchion leapt down\
  \ at Celeste from the ratlines. The full force of the man's falling mass backed\
  \ the two-handed stroke. \"Celeste! Look out!\"</p> \n     <p>Celeste turned to\
  \ Torius, eyes uncomprehending as the blade fell like a guillotine toward the back\
  \ of her head.</p> \n     <p>An iron-tipped ballista bolt struck the slaver the\
  \ instant before the blade would have cloven her skull. The heavy falchion sheared\
  \ away a lock of the naga's platinum hair, then skittered down her scales. The glancing\
  \ blow brought her around in a flash of fangs, ready to strike, but the shaft had\
  \ spitted the slaver through the chest. Her would-be assassin lay twitching on the\
  \ deck, clutching the wrist-thick bolt and gasping for breath.</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ a sigh of relief, Torius traced the bolt's trajectory back to the foredeck, where\
  \ a grinning gnome leapt with delight at her life-saving shot. He'd have to remember\
  \ to thank Snick, but the battle wasn't over yet. </p> \n     <p>\"Celeste!\" Torius\
  \ pointed to the deck, since in her current state she seemed incapable of understanding\
  \ him.</p> \n     <p>Celeste turned away from the dying slaver and cast her lightning\
  \ yet again, blasting the tightly pressed slavers and thinning their remaining ranks\
  \ by half.</p> \n     <p>The devastation shattered the enemy's waning morale. Some\
  \ dropped their weapons to plead for mercy, while others, rightly assuming that\
  \ none would be given, leapt over the side. This proved a poor tactic, however,\
  \ for the school of sharks that often followed slave galleys had been alerted to\
  \ a pending meal by the blood running from the ship's scuppers. The water roiled,\
  \ and shrill screams rose above the din of battle.</p> \n     <p>The surviving slavers\
  \ fought grimly on—ravaged by Grogul's boarding party, Thillion's archers, and Celeste's\
  \ spells—until the last fell in a welter of blood. A cheer rose up from the Stargazers,\
  \ and Torius thrust his bloody sword to the sky in triumph.</p> \n     <p>\"Grogul,\
  \ search the ship and free the slaves! Snick, see to the wounded! Thillion, pick\
  \ a prize crew and take stock of all she's carrying. You'll be taking her into Almas\
  \ as usual.\" As the three hurried to follow his orders, he turned to find Celeste\
  \ coiled over the slaver who had attacked her. She had ended his suffering with\
  \ a bite to the throat, a kindness Torius doubted the slaver would have returned.\
  \ Her cloak of starlight had vanished, and her black scales were spattered with\
  \ blood, but she seemed unhurt. \"Celeste! Are you all right?\"</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ turned to him with a startled look. \"I'm... fine.\" She glanced down at the gash\
  \ in his side. \"You're bleeding.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'll live.\" He winced as he\
  \ flexed his side. It still hurt abominably, but the crippling pain was gone. The\
  \ blade had skittered across his ribs like a stick along a picket fence, but the\
  \ wound wasn't life-threatening. \"What happened to you? I couldn't understand a\
  \ word you said.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I... don't know. I couldn't understand you, either.\"\
  \ She gazed at the charred corpse of the slaver wizard. \"Maybe she cursed me.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Well, it's lapsed, at least.\" He ran a hand down her truncated\
  \ hair. \"Though it cost you a haircut.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes... I didn't see him.\"\
  \ She looked forward. \"Snick saved my life.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes. She's certainly\
  \ got a way with ballistae. That was an amazing shot. I'll have to give her a bonus.\
  \ But that cloak-of-starlight saved you as well. That's a handy spell.\" He laughed,\
  \ but was surprised to see that his mirth wasn't mirrored in her eyes. Instead,\
  \ she looked rather shaken. \"You sure you're okay?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Just a little\
  \ rattled, I think.\" Celeste smiled weakly. \"Close call, you know. But we won.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"That we did.\" Torius surveyed the deck. \"Your prophecy was spot-on!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>The Stargazers were hard at work, and already the deck looked less\
  \ like a slaughterhouse and more like a ship. Snick and her ballista crews tended\
  \ the wounded with a satchel full of potions for those close to death and bandages\
  \ for the rest. At a glance he saw only two dead Stargazers. They'd be in Almas\
  \ in just a few days, and there was enough in the death fund they all paid into\
  \ to have them brought back by the priests there. Torius looked over his crew with\
  \ a surge of pride; taking on such a superior force with only two deaths was an\
  \ amazing feat. </p> \n     <p>He cleaned his sword on a dead slaver's shirt and\
  \ slipped it into its sheath. \"Yes, it's a good day to be a pirate.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"<i>Privateer</i>, you mean,\" Celeste corrected.</p> \n     <p>\"I suppose.\"\
  \ He gave her his best piratical grin and laughed. \"Doesn't have quite the same\
  \ ring to it, but I must admit there are advantages.\" </p> \n     <p>The first\
  \ of the freed slaves stumbled onto the deck, pale and blinking in the sunlight.\
  \ That look of delighted astonishment on their faces made all his pain worthwhile.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I still think I should go in with you. Mathias rubbed up against Vreva's\
  \ leg and lashed his tail. You might need my help.</p> \n     <p>\"Not this time,\
  \ love.\" Vreva took a calming breath and peered out the window of the carriage\
  \ as it turned onto Ostenso's waterfront. She loved Mathias and might have used\
  \ his help, but having him along would distract her. In the belly of a Chelish flagship,\
  \ surrounded by a thousand sailors and marines, the last thing she needed was a\
  \ distraction. \"It's just dinner. I'll be in and out in a trice.\"</p> \n     <p>Dinner\
  \ with you is never <i>just</i> dinner. Mathias knew better than to be put off by\
  \ her assurances. Tell me you're not planning to befuddle his brain with your feminine\
  \ charms, drug his wine, break into his mind with magic, and steal his every secret\
  \ right down to his mistress's favorite color.</p> \n     <p>\"Mathias!\" She reached\
  \ down and scratched him behind the ears. \"Never <i>all</i> of that on the first\
  \ date.\"</p> \n     <p>Right. He didn't sound convinced.</p> \n     <p>The truth\
  \ was, Vreva didn't have much of a plan other than to make her best possible first\
  \ impression on Admiral Ronnel. She'd done some digging on him, of course, and deemed\
  \ him a hard man, a brilliant naval tactician, a political hawk, and—thank Calistria—\
  a ladies' man. The only way she could get more information about him and this Kellid\
  \ witch and her weapon, neither of which they had seen in several days of Mathias\
  \ spying from the waterfront alleys, was to meet him in person. Unfortunately, her\
  \ letter of introduction and invitation to a private dinner at the Officers' Club\
  \ had been answered with regrets and an explanation that his duties would not let\
  \ him leave his ship—but also with a return invitation to visit him aboard his flagship,\
  \ <i>Devil's Trident</i>. If she got him alone, and detected none of the magical\
  \ precautions so common among the powerful and paranoid, she might risk casting\
  \ a spell on him or drugging his wine. Then, with some careful suggestions, she\
  \ might attempt to discover what this secret weapon was. Vreva was experienced enough\
  \ to know that things like this took time. Besides, the admiral wasn't going anywhere\
  \ soon. Rumor had it that <i>Devil's Trident</i> would be tied to the dock for some\
  \ time yet awaiting an unknown deadline.</p> \n     <p>The carriage rumbled to a\
  \ stop, the iron wheels sounding hollow on the thick wooden planks of the wharf.\
  \ Vreva smoothed her dress, and then cast a spell on Mathias that made him vanish\
  \ from sight. Her familiar would skulk about the docks within range of her empathic\
  \ messages. If something untoward occurred, at least he would know.</p> \n     <p>Vreva\
  \ stepped from the carriage and tamped down her trepidation. She'd been in many\
  \ dangerous places in her career, but never had she stepped aboard such an intimidating\
  \ ship. This close, the sheer immensity of <i>Devil's Trident</i> made her feel\
  \ as if she stood before the ramparts of a castle. Looming over lesser ships, the\
  \ flagship's four towering masts soared so high they seemed to pierce the evening\
  \ sky. Three rows of ballista ports checkered the hull, more than she'd ever seen\
  \ on one ship. The gangplank looked more like a drawbridge than a simple ramp, sporting\
  \ gilded rope handrails and carpeted steps that led up to a wide boarding hatch\
  \ on the middeck.</p> \n     <p>Vreva approached with an easy, fluid gait that belied\
  \ her tension. She had taken great care with her attire for the evening, remembering\
  \ one of her very first lessons as a courtesan: you have only one chance to make\
  \ a good first impression. Her gown—deep crimson silk brocade with gold accents—\
  plunged low at both neckline and back, though a shawl clasped at her throat currently\
  \ hid the full effect. </p> \n     <p>Security around the ship was tight, especially\
  \ since it was docked not at the naval pier, but rather at the main commercial pier\
  \ of the port. A score of Chelish marines were stationed all along the dock, and\
  \ another ten in formation at the base of the gangplank, all of them resplendent\
  \ in black-and-red uniforms. An army couldn't have easily breached the flagship's\
  \ defenses—but Vreva could. She'd done some careful reconnoitering earlier in the\
  \ day, looking for magical defenses, wards, traps, and the like. Though she'd found\
  \ none, her skin crawled with unease. She had no doubt there were spellcasters aboard.\
  \ For this first incursion, she'd taken great care to leave all of her magical trinkets\
  \ and lethal poisons behind—nothing that would raise suspicions if discovered. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>The marines at the gangplank snapped to rigid attention, but couldn't\
  \ hide their covert glances at the admiral's guest.</p> \n     <p>\"Madame Korvis.\"\
  \ A tall lieutenant bowed stiffly, his face a mask of propriety. \"Lieutenant Draell\
  \ of the Imperial Marines at your service. The admiral's expecting you.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"And he's supplied me with quite a dashing escort.\" She proffered a silk-gloved\
  \ hand. \"Delighted to meet you, Lieutenant Draell.\"</p> \n     <p>He took her\
  \ hand in a formal fingertip grasp and bowed again, his unsmiling face flushing\
  \ slightly. \"You'll excuse the formality, ma'am. We're under very strict security.\"\
  \ He placed her hand on his arm and gestured to the gangway. Four of the marines\
  \ fell in around them, their faces chiseled from stone.</p> \n     <p>\"Well, I'm\
  \ honored to receive such royal treatment.\" She wasn't really. Five soldiers surrounding\
  \ her meant she couldn't make any haphazard observations en route to the admiral,\
  \ but that wouldn't stop her from learning as much as she could. \"I've never been\
  \ aboard a <i>flagship</i> before. Perhaps you could point out a few things on the\
  \ way.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'd be happy to, ma'am.\"</p> \n     <p>At the boarding\
  \ hatch, another squad of marines stood around a man in a black jacket with two\
  \ silver emblems on his lapels, a pair of crossed lightning bolts and a junior officer's\
  \ insignia. He was young and good-looking, and Vreva knew instantly that he was\
  \ a spellcaster. Here, it seemed, was the magical security.</p> \n     <p>\"One\
  \ moment please.\" The darkly clad caster stepped forward and held up a hand, his\
  \ fingers bent in a crooked gesture as a whisper of arcane words issued from his\
  \ mirthless lips. His hand shimmered briefly in the dim light of the deck lanterns.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Magic?\" She cocked an eyebrow at her escort. \"You <i>are</i> being\
  \ very careful, aren't you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Just a precaution, Madame Korvis.\"\
  \ Draell's face remained impassive. \"I'm sure you understand.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I understand perfectly.\" She fixed her features in a facade of mild affront. \"\
  Will there be a search of my <i>person</i>, as well?\"</p> \n     <p>Draell looked\
  \ momentarily horrified. \"No, ma'am. We just look for magic.\"</p> \n     <p><i>That's\
  \ good to know</i>. She sighed as if mildly put out.</p> \n     <p>\"Nothing.\"\
  \ The caster nodded respectfully and tipped his tricorne, but remained impassive.\
  \ \"Your pardon, ma'am.\"</p> \n     <p>Vreva smiled sweetly at him, then turned\
  \ back to Draell. \"Now, about this wonderful ship, Lieutenant... \"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Vreva feigned rapt interest as Draell happily spouted nautical mumbo-jumbo,\
  \ drowning her in meaningless details about buntlines, cat-harpins, and double-preventer\
  \ stays. Only once they entered the lofty sterncastle did the deluge of sailor-speak\
  \ ease to a trickle, and her attention sharpen. She memorized every twist and turn\
  \ of the corridors in case she had to make a quick escape. Surviving such an escape,\
  \ however, seemed unlikely with all the sailors and soldiers about. Dour marines\
  \ stood at many of the doors, and every passage branch. If she had to flee, she'd\
  \ need to sprout wings and go out a porthole.</p> \n     <p>Finally, they came to\
  \ a pair of double doors guarded by two more marines and narcissistically emblazoned\
  \ with the crest of the Admiral's house. Cheliax's queen had granted Ronnel the\
  \ title of baronet for his service to the empire, which barely qualified as nobility.\
  \ At Lieutenant Draell's knock, a white-jacketed steward opened the door and stepped\
  \ aside.</p> \n     <p>Draell escorted Vreva inside, and executed a crisp military\
  \ bow. \"Milord Admiral Vaetus Ronnel, Madame Virika Korvis.\"</p> \n     <p>A slim\
  \ man of perhaps fifty years wearing an immaculate dress admiral's uniform turned\
  \ from the broad expanse of stern gallery windows. \"Madame Korvis, how very delightful\
  \ of you to accept my invitation.\" Ronnel approached with a smile and a conspicuous\
  \ brush of the golden epaulets atop his shoulders. \"I regret <i>terribly</i> that\
  \ I couldn't meet with you at your establishment, but the duties of command never\
  \ end, and my presence is required here.\" The admiral executed a precise quarter-bow,\
  \ the proper formality for a noble greeting a guest of lower standing.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Ronnel was surprisingly handsome, which didn't matter in the slightest. What\
  \ did matter was his obvious arrogance. She could use that to her advantage. From\
  \ her youth in Egorian, Vreva was all too familiar with the propriety and pomposity\
  \ of the new nobility. She'd be living in that world still, had she not abandoned\
  \ her true name, family, and heritage. She also knew enough about Ronnel to be on\
  \ her guard. The man was skilled, intelligent, and ruthless. He was also an idiot\
  \ when it came to money. Without a war to supply him with prize money from naval\
  \ conquests, his lavish habits had resulted in a considerable debt. Lastly, and\
  \ perhaps most importantly, he enjoyed female company.</p> \n     <p>\"Milord Admiral.\"\
  \ Unclipping her shawl, Vreva handed it off to the steward and curtsied gracefully,\
  \ giving the admiral a delicate smile and a perfect view of her daring neckline.\
  \ \"It's such a pleasure to finally meet the commander so highly spoken of by his\
  \ officers. I'm thrilled to be invited aboard such a <i>fabulous</i> ship!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The last part, at least, was the absolute truth; she was thrilled by\
  \ this opportunity to spy on a fleet admiral, and the ship was indeed fabulous.\
  \ The great cabin was nothing short of palatial. Polished brass lamps hung from\
  \ every beam, bathing the teak-paneled walls in a soft golden glow. The decor was\
  \ both masculine and military. A large desk stood to the right, emblazoned with\
  \ yet another coat of arms, a pair of crossed swords displayed on the wall behind\
  \ it. A table set with burnished silver plates and sparkling crystal stood in front\
  \ of high, gilt-framed windows that arched along the entire back wall, providing\
  \ a glorious view of the harbor. White-gloved servants stood behind each chair,\
  \ ready to attend. </p> \n     <p><i>Not exactly intimate</i>. <i>I'll have to get\
  \ him alone somehow</i>.</p> \n     <p>\"Everything's so lovely and bright.\" She\
  \ beamed at Ronnel and placed her hand on his proffered arm. \"I expected a military\
  \ vessel to be stuffy and cramped.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We keep <i>Devil's Trident</i>\
  \ in fighting trim,\" he said, puffing up his chest, \"but I also enjoy my comfort.\
  \ As Admiral of the Ostenso Fleet, I <i>do</i> require accommodations to entertain\
  \ guests.\" He dismissed Draell with a wave and gestured toward the table. \"A glass\
  \ of wine before dinner?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'd prefer whiskey, if you have a single\
  \ malt handy.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Whiskey?\" Ronnel looked at her as if she'd asked\
  \ him for a cup of freshly drawn blood. \"Really?\"</p> \n     <p>\"<i>Really</i>,\
  \ Milord Admiral.\" Vreva curved her lips in a licentious smile. Her request had\
  \ caught him off guard, accomplishing exactly what she intended. \"A dear friend\
  \ introduced me to the pleasure of a finely crafted single malt whiskey.\" Memories\
  \ of that friend and their ill-fated romance muddled her mind for a moment, but\
  \ she thrust them aside and focused. \"The flavor is so very... <i>smoldering</i>,\
  \ don't you think?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I've never really tried whiskey, but I think\
  \ my steward might be able to find something you'll like.\" Dragging his eyes away\
  \ from hers, the admiral snapped his fingers and his steward hurried off, doubtlessly\
  \ to delve the flagship's cellars. \"You're a woman of eclectic tastes.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Eclectic?\" She shrugged and squeezed his arm. \"Not to my thinking.\
  \ I like my liquor like my men, strong and straight up.\"</p> \n     <p>Ronnel gaped\
  \ at her for a moment, then laughed out loud. \"By the stones of Asmodeus himself,\
  \ you really <i>are</i> something!\" He laughed again, fully and without reservation.\
  \ \"Quite refreshing! Quite refreshing indeed after so many simpering shrews. A\
  \ <i>real</i> woman, not afraid to speak her piece to someone above her station.\
  \ Quite refreshing!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Why, thank you, Admiral.\" <i>First task accomplished</i>.\
  \ Vreva had just set her first impression in stone, distinguishing herself from\
  \ any other woman the admiral might entertain. Squeezing his arm again, she joined\
  \ in his laughter. \"Not every man has the self-assurance to recognize me for what\
  \ I am, but you've hit the proverbial nail on the head with the first stroke. No\
  \ doubt one of your officers has told you of me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"They have not.\
  \ I swear it on my honor.\" Ronnel placed his hand over his heart and bowed. \"\
  Please, let's forget all this propriety and simply enjoy ourselves. I can't think\
  \ of a single person with whom I'd rather spend an unabashed evening of frivolity.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Unabashed frivolity just <i>happens</i> to be one of my favorite\
  \ pastimes, Admiral.\" Vreva beamed up at him, enjoying the blush that rose to his\
  \ cheeks. She had him exactly where she wanted him: mirth up, inhibitions down,\
  \ and his libido ready to jump out of his pants and prance around the cabin.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Very good!\"</p> \n     <p>The steward arrived with a bottle that\
  \ looked like it had spent several years rolling around the ship's bilge. The label\
  \ was barely legible, but when the steward proffered it for inspection, she recognized\
  \ the crest of a New Stetven distillery in distant Brevoy.</p> \n     <p>\"Ah, you\
  \ have good taste, Admiral! Let's give it a try.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Damn the ballistae\
  \ and full sail ahead! Ha ha!\" The admiral snatched up two tumblers from the sideboard\
  \ and clapped them down on the table. \"I do believe I'll join you!\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Please, allow me to serve your first taste!\" Vreva plucked the bottle from\
  \ the startled steward's hands, expertly cracked the seal, and twisted the stopper\
  \ free with a resonant pop. She poured a measure into each glass and held one out\
  \ to Ronnel. \"To a night of unabashed frivolity.\"</p> \n     <p>He took his glass\
  \ and glowed at her. \"To that, Madame Korvis, I will drink!\"</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ they did.</p> \n     <p>The heady flavors of smoky peat and malt exploded in Vreva's\
  \ senses, but she was prepared for the shock of it. She gasped in a cleansing breath,\
  \ enjoying the liquid fire that warmed her throat and stomach. The admiral's gasp\
  \ evolved into a fit of coughing, his face turning an astonishing shade of scarlet\
  \ before he managed to draw a full breath.</p> \n     <p>\"Rather takes you off\
  \ guard, doesn't it?\" She relieved him of his tumbler before he dropped it.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Like a summer squall!\" He coughed again and tried to smile. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"It's an acquired taste.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I think I'll stick with\
  \ wine.\" Ronnel motioned the steward forward.</p> \n     <p>\"To each his own poison.\"\
  \ Vreva strolled around the vast cabin, brushing her fingers lightly over the requisite\
  \ portrait of Queen Abrogail II, and peering in admiration at the crossed swords\
  \ mounted on the bulkhead behind Ronnel's broad desk. \"This cabin is positively\
  \ lovely! Would it be possible to get a tour of the rest of the ship?\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"After dinner we can take a turn on deck, but I'm afraid most of the ship's\
  \ off-limits to visitors.\" The admiral joined her, sipping a glass of deep-red\
  \ wine. \"This cabin is for formal dinners and meetings, mostly. I sometimes host\
  \ dinners for the captains of the fleet here, but I generally use it as an office.\
  \ I have more intimate quarters for entertaining... special friends.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p><i>Not too subtle, are we, Admiral?</i> Vreva gave him a sultry smile. \"\
  I'd love to see them.\"</p> \n     <p>\"After dinner, then.\" He guided her back\
  \ to the table with a hand at the small of her back as two stewards entered bearing\
  \ several covered dishes. \"I've arranged quite a feast for us. I have one of the\
  \ finest culinary slaves money can buy, you know.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Really?\" Vreva\
  \ wondered about people who used slaves as their personal chefs. Didn't they realize\
  \ how easy it was to poison someone? </p> \n     <p>Hoping that tonight wasn't the\
  \ night the enslaved chef decided to rebel, Vreva took the seat a servant held for\
  \ her. Just as Ronnel took his own seat, however, a knock sounded at the door. When\
  \ the steward answered, a harried lieutenant burst into the cabin, gasping for breath\
  \ and dabbing a handkerchief at four parallel scratches etched across his cheek.\
  \ Vreva recognized him from the Officers' Club—the disgruntled lieutenant.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Milord Admiral!\" The officer saluted stiffly. \"I beg your pardon, but\
  \ there's an emergency, sir.\" </p> \n     <p>The admiral flushed crimson, the veins\
  \ in his neck and face bulging. \"Pardon me for a moment, my dear. The drudgeries\
  \ of command again, I'm afraid.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I understand perfectly, Admiral.\"\
  \ Vreva smiled sweetly and sipped her whiskey as her host thrust himself out of\
  \ his chair.</p> \n     <p> Ronnel stalked over to the injured lieutenant and backed\
  \ him up against the door, his voice harsh and low. \"This <i>better</i> be important,\
  \ Lieutenant Emero, or you'll be scrubbing the bilges for a month!\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"It's that <i>witch</i> again, sir!\"</p> \n     <p>Vreva could just make\
  \ out the officer's hushed words. She gazed out the window as if entranced by the\
  \ view, covertly watching the two men's reflections in the glass. She longed to\
  \ cast a mind-reading or eavesdropping spell, but didn't dare with a servant hovering\
  \ at her elbow. Even casting a silent spell might be noticed.</p> \n     <p>\"What's\
  \ she done now?\" the admiral demanded.</p> \n     <p>Emero lowered his voice further,\
  \ and Vreva strained to hear.</p> \n     <p>\"She's... with that... and that bloody\
  \ devil hit my... the infirmary... and when I... blood on my... immediately... \"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Right now?\"</p> \n     <p>In the window's reflection, Vreva saw\
  \ the admiral cast her a quick glance, then turn to glare at the poor lieutenant.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"I'm sorry, sir, but she... \"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, <i>fine</i>!\
  \ Wait here.\" Ronnel returned to the table and bowed to Vreva. \"I'm very sorry,\
  \ my dear, but I'm afraid I'm being called away.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, how <i>dreadful</i>!\"\
  \ Vreva put on her best pout and stood. \"Can I wait for you here?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"I don't know when I'll get back, but if you like, please stay and enjoy the\
  \ meal. I'll be an hour, at least, but could be longer.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, I\
  \ could never accept your hospitality without the pleasure of your company, Admiral.\"\
  \ Vreva leaned forward to brush his cheek with her own, her voice a sultry whisper.\
  \ \"There's no hurry. An unabashed evening of frivolity must be done properly, you\
  \ know.\" She trailed her nails down his taut waistcoat.</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, I agree.\"\
  \ Ronnel stepped back and took her hand in his, bending to kiss it. \"I'll arrange\
  \ another dinner, and we'll do it properly. You have my pledge of honor.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"I'll hold you to it, Admiral.\" Vreva curtsied again.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Jensen, escort the lady off the ship and hail a carriage.\" The admiral cast Vreva\
  \ one more longing glance before stalking out of the cabin, Lieutenant Emero at\
  \ his heels.</p> \n     <p><i>Well, that was a waste of time!</i> Smiling sweetly\
  \ despite her disappointment, Vreva accepted her shawl from the steward and wrapped\
  \ it around her shoulders. She looked wistfully at the dishes on the table. The\
  \ covers hadn't even been removed, but the tantalizing aromas made her mouth water.\
  \ Maybe she should have taken Ronnel up on his offer and dined alone, but it would\
  \ have given the wrong impression. She'd done the right thing. She did, however,\
  \ finish her whiskey before she followed the steward back through the labyrinthine\
  \ passages. She caught the faint sound of distant raised voices, and considered\
  \ what she'd overheard. <i>Devils and witches and blood, oh my</i>... </p> \n  \
  \   <p>As her carriage approached, Vreva felt a surge of urgency. <i>Mathias</i>.\
  \ She sent him a nudge of affirmation, and feigned a misstep as she boarded the\
  \ hackney. Her marine escort caught her arm, and she pressed against him long enough\
  \ for Mathias to slip ahead of her, his black fur rendering him virtually invisible\
  \ in the darkness. Thanking her escort, she stepped up and settled into the carriage.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>What the hell happened? Mathias mewed as they jerked into motion. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"The admiral was called away. Something to do with this witch of theirs.\
  \ There might also be a devil involved, too, though it could have been just a turn\
  \ of phrase.\"</p> \n     <p>Are you kidding me? This is Cheliax! If someone says\
  \ devil, they're probably talking about a <i>real</i> one!</p> \n     <p>\"Regardless,\
  \ I think we need a different strategy.\"</p> \n     <p>A little feline reconnaissance?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Exactly.\" Vreva scratched Mathias under the chin, but he was already\
  \ purring with excitement. \"One more ship's cat should go unnoticed, though getting\
  \ you aboard might be tricky. They scan everyone who comes aboard for magic.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As long as you don't use a <i>cat</i>-apult, I'm in!</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Oh, my love, that was dreadful.\" She picked him up and nuzzled the back of his\
  \ neck. Born an ordinary cat, Mathias had only been speaking since becoming her\
  \ familiar less than a year ago, and was still learning the finer points of language.\
  \ Unfortunately, he was also learning how to pun. \"Stick to chasing rats.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I'm so unappreciated... </p> \n     <p>\"Celeste?\"</p> \n     <p>Something\
  \ brushed through her hair, shattering the song of the heavens into a thousand shards.\
  \ Celeste whirled and lashed out, fangs extended.</p> \n     <p>\"Celeste!\" Torius\
  \ jerked his hand back. \"Gozreh's guts! What's gotten into you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Torius!\" She slithered back, her panic receding, though her heart still raced.\
  \ Then she saw the blood on the back of his hand. \"By the stars! Torius, I'm sorry!\
  \ I didn't... Clean it! Quickly!\" If any of her venom got into his bloodstream,\
  \ his addiction might flare back to life. Lunar naga venom was dangerously habit-forming,\
  \ and that dependency had nearly destroyed their relationship once before. He'd\
  \ all but accused her of trying to enslave him, and she'd thought he wanted to be\
  \ rid of her. The last thing either of them wanted was to go through that again.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"I'm fine. It's just a scratch.\" He wiped the tiny trickle of\
  \ blood away and sucked on the wound. \"Be more careful, will you?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"You startled me!\" Dread descended on her like a shroud. Once more, she'd\
  \ lost herself so deeply in the stars that she'd been oblivious to her surroundings.\
  \ <i>What's happening to me</i>? <i>Maybe I </i>have<i> been cursed</i>... </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Celeste didn't know what to think. Her inability to speak or understand\
  \ a word of Taldane during the battle with the slavers might have been a spell cast\
  \ by the dying wizard, but she wasn't sure. The shimmering cloak of stars that shielded\
  \ her from enemy blades and arrows, however, had come from within her. She had felt\
  \ the magic arise from deep inside her. It hadn't been a spell, at least not in\
  \ the way she was used to casting spells, but something... internal. The magic might\
  \ have protected her, but it also scared the hell out of her. And now she had bitten\
  \ Torius.</p> \n     <p>\"You're sure you're okay? How do you feel?\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"I'm fine.\" He sucked again at the tiny scratch and spat over the rail.\
  \ \"No venom got in. Believe me, I'd know.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Thank the stars!\"\
  \ She felt a flood of relief, but still the nagging worry. <i>Cursed</i>... \"Don't\
  \ touch me like that when I'm stargazing. You startled me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Well,\
  \ you can bet your scaly tail I won't do it again!\" </p> \n     <p>\"I <i>said</i>\
  \ I was sorry.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Forget it. No harm done.\" Torius reached out to\
  \ touch her again, but she reared back out of reach. He stopped and stared at her.\
  \ \"What's <i>wrong</i> with you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Nothing. I'm just rattled, I\
  \ guess.\" Celeste glanced around the quarterdeck, but nothing seemed amiss. They\
  \ were still sailing northbound, though the lights of Almas weren't yet visible.\
  \ In fact, the only lights other than the stars were those of the captured galley\
  \ following a mile in their wake. \"What's going on?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Nothing serious.\
  \ I just need our position. It's almost midnight.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Of course.\"\
  \ She had apparently been lost for hours again, and hadn't even heard the ship's\
  \ bell tolling the watch change. <i>Cursed</i>... She took quick sightings on Bretheda\
  \ and Castrovel, and ran through her calculations, grateful for something to occupy\
  \ her mind for a while. Only after marking the chart and jotting down the time did\
  \ she realize that Torius was staring at her. \"What?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Nothing.\
  \ You just seem jittery.\" He noted their position on the chart, ordered a minor\
  \ course change, then returned to her. \"You're sure you're all right?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"I <i>am</i> a little jittery, I guess. I don't know. Perhaps that close\
  \ call aboard the slave galley unnerved me.\" She wanted to tell him about the strange\
  \ spell, that she felt it might be linked to her inability to communicate during\
  \ the fight, but couldn't force herself to form the words. Celeste glanced about\
  \ the quarterdeck at the sailors bustling about in their duties. Sailors were notoriously\
  \ superstitious, so later might be better, when they could talk privately. Or maybe\
  \ she shouldn't tell him at all. <i>Should I tell him about this</i>?</p> \n   \
  \  <p>A curious feeling washed over her. The song of the heavens resounded in her\
  \ mind, but unlike the feeling of rightness she'd felt when she suddenly knew taking\
  \ the slave ship was the correct thing to do, she now felt a swirling uncertainty,\
  \ a morass of good and bad, benefit and detriment, boon and bane. She shook her\
  \ head at the strange sensation, and thought for a moment she heard musical laughter.\
  \ She twisted, scanning the deck for the source, so clear and loud, but it wasn't\
  \ any voice she'd ever heard. <i>Now I'm hearing voices in my head! What the hell's\
  \ happening to me?</i></p> \n     <p>\"Celeste!\" Torius reached out to her again,\
  \ and she couldn't shy away. Not from him. His warm hands felt good on her scales.\
  \ Soothing. Familiar. \"What's wrong? You look like you just saw a ghost!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I... don't know.\" That was the truth at least. <i>Hearing voices,\
  \ strange spells, speaking in tongues</i>... Her mind whirled with potential causes,\
  \ none of them good. <i>Is this what it feels like to be possessed by a spirit or\
  \ demon</i>? \"I just... feel strange. I can't explain it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Just\
  \ try to relax.\" He pulled her into a comforting embrace. \"We'll be in Almas today,\
  \ and it'll take at least a couple of days to get the ship straightened out. Snick\
  \ said we sprung a few joints coming up against that galley, and they'll need to\
  \ be repaired. We can afford to take a little time for ourselves.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Time—you mean a few days off?\" Maybe that was all she needed.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Sure. We'll have to meet with our contact, of course, but after that... how about\
  \ a night on the town? Almas is a big city. There are lots of places you haven't\
  \ visited yet.\"</p> \n     <p>\"That would be nice.\" Celeste smiled and leaned\
  \ into Torius's warm arms. Almas also undoubtedly had innumerable wizards and clerics\
  \ who might be able to discern what was wrong with her. <i>Maybe I can even find\
  \ someone to lift this curse</i>... </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"text-align:\
