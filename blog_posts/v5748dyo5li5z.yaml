  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Let's start off this week's Friday Publisher\
  \ Preview with the bad news. <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon\
  \ Inn</em></a>, the next set in the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ line of prepainted fantasy miniatures, has been officially moved from a November\
  \ release to a January, 2016 release. So we're all going to have to wait just a\
  \ little bit longer to receive these amazing miniatures. Having seen the paint masters\
  \ at this point, all I can say is that I can assure everyone the wait will be worth\
  \ it. There's a little bit of knock-on fluidity with the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles Iconic Heroes</a> boxed sets as well, but I don't have final\
  \ confirmation and I don't expect a significant delay on that front. I'll let you\
  \ know more when I know more. Again, those sets are incredible, and the wait will\
  \ be worth it.</p> \n    <p>With that unfortunate news out of the way, let's move\
  \ on to this week's previews!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-GracefulSlayer.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-GracefulSlayer_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first this week is the Graceful Slayer, an elf barbarian\
  \ from page 22 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex</em></a>.\
  \ One of the last figure selections from my dear, departed licensing assistant Mike\
  \ Kenway, this fearless warrior is ready to rock with an elven curve blade and a\
  \ formidable bow. She should work great as a player character, or as a member of\
  \ a wilderness tribe. The Graceful Slayer is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-Bed.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-Bed_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>It's been a while since I've had a chance to reveal any\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>'s \"dungeon\
  \ dressing,\" so I'm pleased to show off this handsome Bed. Sleep on it, tip it\
  \ over and use it as cover, or... well, I'll leave other uses to your imagination,\
  \ but you can't have a proper nighttime inn ambush without a proper bed, and <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> is here to help\
  \ you out! The Bed is a dungeon dressing piece that will be randomly inserted into\
  \ booster packs, with the general idea of there being at least one per case (collation,\
  \ as per usual, is an inexact science and is not guaranteed).</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-Beaky.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-Beaky_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And here we have my favorite miniature in the entire\
  \ set, a bird/bear combination we can only call \"Beaky\". This monstrous creature\
  \ is one of the largest of its time produced in prepainted plastic to date, and\
  \ while he's technically a Large creature, he really pushes the limits of his size\
  \ in a way that's sure to send shivers up the spines of your players. Beaky is <i>substantial</i>,\
  \ in terms of size, weight, and table impact. I cannot wait to get one of my very\
  \ own. Beaky is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week.\
  \ Join us in seven days as we reveal more amazing figures from <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>!</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain,</p> \n  \
