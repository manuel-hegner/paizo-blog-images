  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Ari Marmell</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Four: Revenge Is\
  \ a Dish...</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"\
  ><p>Marcov spotted the modest hut to which the priest had directed him, spent a\
  \ moment invoking the haunting spirits, and broke into a sprint. He leaped, hurling\
  \ his whole weight against the shuttered window nearest the front door. Wood burst\
  \ inward, splinters flying—all in utter silence, for the ghosts of that long-dead\
  \ village had spread their intangible substances through the surrounding air, muting\
  \ all sound.</p></span> \n     <p>A trio of animated skeletons—Marcov guessed they'd\
  \ been chosen over fleshier undead so as to cut down on the stench—lurched and staggered\
  \ from across the room. Bone fingers wrapped around cheap swords, or curled into\
  \ tearing claws. The clacking and clicking probably would have been disturbing,\
  \ if he could hear any of it.</p> \n     <p>Marcov spun, sweeping the legs from\
  \ under the nearest corpse. Bastard sword held high, he parried a stroke from the\
  \ second, then brought the heavy pommel of the weapon down in a diagonal arc. The\
  \ skeleton's collarbone shattered, causing the undead to stagger and nearly topple.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>With a quick yank on the thing's opposite shoulder, Marcov removed \"\
  nearly\" from the equation. The animated bones fell atop the first skeleton, pinning\
  \ it down just as it tried to rise. Marcov reversed his grip and plunged the blade\
  \ through both rib cages and deep into the wooden floor. Neither skeleton would\
  \ be getting up anytime soon.</p> \n     <p>The third and final guardian was just\
  \ clever enough to lunge, taking advantage of the intruder's newly disarmed state.\
  \ It seemed a good idea, right up until Marcov pounded the thing into a heap of\
  \ splintered bone with a small end table that had been standing in a corner.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A few additional swings took care of the two pinned to the floor. Marcov\
  \ retrieved his sword and continued, still wrapped in silence.</p> \n     <p>Doubtless\
  \ the skeletons had been intended to scare away any potential intruders, and delay\
  \ an attacker long enough for Khydol to prepare. Except Khydol hadn't heard a peep.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The cleric stood in the next room beside a makeshift shrine to Calistria,\
  \ surrounded by rickety shelves of mementos—crockery, books, children's toys, candlesticks—\
  presumably lost by those displaced during the General's purge of clerics from Touvette.\
  \ The tome he'd been perusing fell open to the floor, its pages crumpling, as Marcov\
  \ appeared in the doorway.</p> \n     <p>The half-elf's eyes widened at the sight\
  \ of the unnaturally stealthy intruder. He raised holy symbol wrought of pewter\
  \ and began to intone a prayer to his goddess.</p> \n     <p><i>Sorry</i>, Marcov\
  \ mouthed around a vicious grin, then raised his blade and advanced at a saunter.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He was halfway through cleaning his blade when the silence lapsed and\
  \ the room abruptly filled with the whisper of cloth on steel. A moment later, he\
  \ heard the faint crunching of someone climbing in through the broken shutters.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Marcov?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Next room!\" he called back. \"You're a\
  \ little late, Loursa.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Khydol's dead?\" Her footsteps, drawing\
  \ nearer the open doorway, weren't quite loud enough to mask the peculiar tone of\
  \ her question.</p> \n     <p>\"Dead as Aroden. Figured I'd ask him a couple of—\
  \"</p> \n     <p>It was pure luck that saved him. Had Loursa arrived before the\
  \ ghosts had dismissed the unnatural hush, or had his struggle with the skeletons\
  \ not scattered so many chips of wood and bone, she'd have been on him with no warning\
  \ at all.</p> \n     <p>As it was, Marcov heard the sudden rush across the debris\
  \ and was able to hurl himself aside. The blow that would otherwise have punched\
  \ through his hauberk and into his back instead left only a fiery trail of blood\
  \ and pain across his ribs.</p> \n     <p>\"What the <i>hell</i>? Loursa—\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The guard kept coming, her blade thrusting as fiercely as it had against\
  \ the bandits. Marcov, wincing at every blow, found himself barely able to parry\
  \ despite his heavier sword.</p> \n     <p>For a moment there was only steel on\
  \ steel and shuffling feet. Marcov retreated as far as Khydol's body, then leaped\
  \ over it, putting a bit of distance between him and his traitorous opponent.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"So what is it, then?\" he growled. \"Just waiting until you didn't\
  \ need me anymore to get rid of me?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Something like that,\" she\
  \ told him softly.</p> \n     <p>He mumbled briefly under his breath. Then, \"Lovely\
  \ show of gratitude, Loursa.\"</p> \n     <p>Again she came at him, teeth bared\
  \ in a feral snarl.</p> \n     <p>Marcov clenched his left fist. Wisps of shadow,\
  \ phantom limbs invisible to mortal senses, swirled.</p> \n     <p>Khydol's body\
  \ floated up into Loursa's path just as she made to step over it.</p> \n     <p>Marcov\
  \ lunged, burning with betrayed fury. Flesh and bone parted, and his former companion\
  \ deflated with a soft sigh before sliding from the tip of his blade. For an instant,\
  \ Khydol's floating body held Loursa upright, then both corpses thumped awkwardly\
  \ to the floor.</p> \n     <p>He'd actually grown comfortable, letting someone fight\
  \ at his side again. <i>Should've known better. Stupid, stupid...</i></p> \n   \
  \  <p>Again he cleaned his sword, then leaned it aside and knelt over the bodies.\
  \ He began to call upon the surrounding spirits, prepared to ask them to revive\
  \ Khydol's memories long enough to get some answers...</p> \n     <p>And paused.\
  \ His gaze flickered to Loursa's slackened face, a bitter spring of pain bubbling\
  \ unexpectedly to the surface of his anger.</p> \n     <p>When his hand came down,\
  \ he felt the ghosts moving, but it wasn't into the body of the priest he directed\
  \ them.</p> \n     <p>Loursa's jaw twitched. Her unfocused eyes turned toward him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Why did you try to kill me?\" He cursed himself for the plaintive\
  \ tone he couldn't quite banish.</p> \n     <p>\"Ellithir... tells me... you want\
  \ to harm her, as... you have so many others. I... have to... kill you first.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Who's Ellithir?\"</p> \n     <p>\"My dearest... friend.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>A horrible suspicion began to crawl on millipede legs up Marcov's spine.\
  \ \"How long have you known her?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Few hours.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Then why are you such dear friends?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Words. She speaks... strange,\
  \ pretty words.\"</p> \n     <p>The brutal simplicity of the dead. Marcov rose,\
  \ staggered backward until he thumped against the nearest shelves. Several dishes\
  \ and other trophies fell, shattering around his feet. He didn't notice.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Loursa hadn't liked him; he'd known that from the beginning, and hadn't\
  \ cared. But she'd fought beside him. She <i>hadn't</i> betrayed him, not intentionally.\
  \ Marcov knew magic when he heard it.</p> \n     <p>And he'd killed her for it.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Marcov rubbed at his forehead and looked back at the corpse, but it\
  \ was once again an empty, lifeless husk.</p> \n     <p>\"I'm sorry.\" His voice\
  \ was oddly hoarse, the words dusty from years of disuse.</p> \n     <p>Marcov slung\
  \ his blade over his shoulder and stalked out into the street, his rage growing\
  \ hot once more. Someone in this town knew who Ellithir was, and Marcov felt more\
  \ than ready to make whoever it was tell him.</p> \n     <p>∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>A\
  \ few customers wandered the aisles of the general store when Marcov arrived. For\
  \ several minutes, as he pulled goods aside and hunted for hidden secrets, the patrons\
  \ stared at him in confusion. When one of them confronted him, asking what he thought\
  \ he was doing, the gaunt foreigner was only too happy to let his ghosts toss a\
  \ few objects around the room until he'd sent everyone into panicked flight.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It took some doing, and nearly ten more minutes; that damn mosquito-repelling\
  \ herbal smoke, which seemed to be everywhere he went in the River Kingdoms lately,\
  \ had given him a right headache by the time he was through.</p> \n     <p>Finally,\
  \ however, with the spirits subtly guiding him when he got too far off track, he\
  \ located the hidden trapdoor behind the counter.</p> \n     <p>He was forced to\
  \ duck, walking at almost a crouch down the upper portion of the stairs, until he\
  \ was deep enough below the ceiling to stand straight.</p> \n     <p>The chamber\
  \ was earth and soil, barely supported by sagging beams of wood. A stone-rimmed\
  \ pool sat within, a granite pillar protruding from its center. Both the stink of\
  \ acrid incense and a faint glow that was the cellar's only illumination spilled\
  \ from a pair of braziers. Marcov saw no one else here, heard no one, but a lifetime's\
  \ instincts screamed of lurking danger. Again, he began whispering to the ghosts,\
  \ asking them to guide his strikes, to warn him of attack, to—</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ shadows at the chamber's far end shifted and lightened, revealing a slender silhouette.\
  \ A voice hissed something only vaguely like words, and Marcov's sword began to\
  \ glow. He heard skin sizzle even before he felt the searing pain, and threw the\
  \ weapon aside with a startled shout. It scraped the edge of the pool, settling\
  \ point-first in the water. Steam hissed upward to join the clouds of incense.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Marcov ran, and not an instant too soon. A thunderous crash shook the\
  \ chamber, centered where he'd been standing. Dirt fell from the ceiling and water\
  \ sloshed over the edges of the font. The burst of noise hit him like a physical\
  \ blow, staggering him, making his ears ring; he could only imagine how much worse\
  \ it might have been had he suffered the brunt.</p> \n     <p>Another three paces\
  \ and Marcov jumped for the low ceiling. A brilliant beam of light flashed beneath\
  \ him, so close he could feel the heat of its passing. Had gravity taken its normal\
  \ course, his leap would not have stopped him from plummeting into the path of the\
  \ ray.</p> \n     <p>He felt a phantom current wrap around his fingers and feet,\
  \ holding him to the ceiling. Hanging upside down above the pool like a humanoid\
  \ spider, he began scurrying sideways.</p> \n     <p>The darkened figure emerged\
  \ somewhat from the gloom, revealing a golden-haired elf whose features might have\
  \ been deemed soft, had they not been twisted in a rictus of anger and hate.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Ellithir, I presume?\"</p> \n     <p>She grunted an affirmation. \"\
  And you would be Draeven. You're a damned nuisance, you know that?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"So I've been told. What's this all about?\"</p> \n     <p>Ellithir didn't\
  \ answer, but the flicker of her eyes toward the granite pillar was all the confirmation\
  \ Marcov needed. He knew a shrine when he saw one, even if he didn't recognize the\
  \ deity.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Ellithir.jpg\"\

  \     <p>\"So, this <i>is</i> a religious thing. Just not Calistrian.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>He was stalling, and he knew that <i>she</i> knew he was stalling, but still\
  \ she answered. \"Khydol was useful, as was his faith.\" She shrugged. \"His grudge\
  \ was genuine. I just... encouraged him to expand his horizons.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  To what end? All this bloodshed and suffering... For what?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Bloodshed\
  \ and suffering is the end, Draeven! We—\"</p> \n     <p>Ellithir flung out her\
  \ hand in the midst of speaking, clearly hoping to catch him unprepared.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Marcov hurled himself forward and leaped from the ceiling, wondering what\
  \ fell invocation he'd avoided. Even as he landed, his sword flew from the pool\
  \ into his waiting grasp, cool to the touch once more. He swung.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ sword crashed into a glimmering aura that sprang into life around the elf, the\
  \ blade stopping inches from her skin.</p> \n     <p>Again, Ellithir screeched something\
  \ that was only vaguely a language. This time Marcov recognized a word—or perhaps\
  \ a name?—repeated from her first incantation: <i>Gyronna</i>.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ elf's right eye bulged, suddenly bloodshot and grossly swollen, as if pushed partly\
  \ from her skull by the rage and magic within her. She slapped a hand against his\
  \ armored chest.</p> \n     <p>Agony drove him to his knees. Worse than any wound,\
  \ any illness he'd endured, it felt as though something ate away at him from within.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Then something wriggled, a wet and flaccid tickle that brushed the <i>inside</i>\
  \ of his ribs and burrowed toward his gut, and he realized that was precisely what\
  \ was happening. It was all he could do not to retch, then to scream his horror\
  \ until his mind was gone.</p> \n     <p>\"Idiot!\" Ellithir kicked him in the face,\
  \ sending him sprawling. \"We are a plague! We are as the worms consuming your flesh!\
  \ You haven't stopped me. Even if you'd killed me, you could never—\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The murdered souls that haunted Marcov could do nothing against the unnatural\
  \ parasites that riddled him. But as they'd guided his limbs before, granting him\
  \ strength, so did the spirits enable him to act now—more slowly and feebly than\
  \ he would have preferred, but far more effectively than Ellithir could have anticipated.\
  \ He stumbled upward.</p> \n     <p>Again, the glimmering aura prevented a killing\
  \ stroke.</p> \n     <p>\"Remember how you fought,\" Marcov whispered, coughing,\
  \ to the spirits surrounding him. \"Remember the men who swept over you, over your\
  \ families, your children. Remember how you fought...\"</p> \n     <p>Wisps of nothingness\
  \ swirled, blended, assumed substance and form—until a plain longsword, chipped\
  \ and battered and vaguely transparent, hung behind the elven cleric.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Ellithir gasped as the blade plunged between her shoulders, unhindered by\
  \ her aura. She staggered forward, this time into Marcov's waiting grip.</p> \n\
  \     <p>A simple touch was all it took. Flesh split, blood flowed, muscles burst\
  \ beneath the ghosts' fury.</p> \n     <p>Ellithir fell, first to her knees, then\
  \ to one side. Ever thirsty, the earthen floor drank the growing pool of blood around\
  \ her.</p> \n     <p>Marcov, too, collapsed once more, panting, shuddering in pain.\
  \ \"A drink and a whore if I live through this,\" he mumbled, though whether to\
  \ himself or the spirits was unclear. \"Not necessarily in that order.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Cel—celebrating?\" Ellithir's words emerged as a burbling, blood-soaked\
  \ cough. \"Don't. We—we are everywhere. The River Kingdoms belong to us! The flesh\
  \ is filth. The world is pain. To see is to hate. And the Hag... the Hag sees...\"\
  </p> \n     <p>A final rattle, a pinkish froth, and Ellithir was gone.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Moments later, the agony of the worms began to fade, and Marcov nearly wept\
  \ in relief. He felt as though he'd just swum the Inner Sea while suckling a mewling\
  \ vampire, but the worst of the pain was gone.</p> \n     <p>Then, with the image\
  \ of Loursa's dead face floating before his mind's eye, he realized he was wrong.\
  \ It was only the physical pain that had ebbed.</p> \n     <p>Groaning, he dragged\
  \ himself upright, leaning on his sword like an old man's cane. His gaze flickered\
  \ first to the strange stone shrine, then to the dead priestess at his feet.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He thought of Ellithir's dying words—of cults like this spread throughout\
  \ the River Kingdoms—and the spirits stirred within him.</p> \n     <p>Just this\
  \ once, maybe he wouldn't mind the job that lay ahead.</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"\
