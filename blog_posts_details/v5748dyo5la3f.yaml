  artist: "the Varisians to tell the future and divine fortunes. Think of it as an\
    \ RPG-version of the tarot deck. Each of Curse of the Crimson Throne's six adventures\
    \ are also tied in theme to the six suits of the Harrow deck, and as you play\
    \ through this new Adventure Path, Harrow deck readings can provide valuable insights,\
    \ helpful bonuses, or even unexpected perils and dangers. You can expect to see\
    \ some recurring themes throughout the Adventure Path tied to the Harrow deck,\
    \ but we'll be going beyond that. Players will be able to select a feat, \"Harrowed,\"\
    \ that'll let them use draws"
