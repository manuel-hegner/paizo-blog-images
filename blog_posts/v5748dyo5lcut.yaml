  \ love of roleplaying actually started because of a computer game. In 1980, I discovered\
  \ one of the first computer roleplaying games, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akalabeth:_World_of_Doom\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Akalabeth: World of Doom</a>. It had very simple graphics, and\
  \ gameplay amounted largely to wandering through computer-generated dungeons, killing\
  \ things, and taking their loot. But I was hooked! I used to go down to my local\
  \ computer store—Computer World, in Appleton, Wisconsin—and I'd play the game on\
  \ their Apple II demo setup for hours. (The Computer World staff tolerated my incessant\
  \ play because it attracted lots of attention to the computer!)</p> \n   <p>In 1981,\
  \ I went off to St. Olaf College, leaving Computer World—and Akalabeth—behind. I\
  \ soon needed to scratch my adventuring itch, so put I up a message on the bulletin\
  \ boards asking if anybody at St. Olaf was playing Akalabeth. That didn't pan out,\
  \ but it did lead someone to contact me about a game that was new to me: Dungeons\
  \ &amp; Dragons. Of course, I fell in love with D&amp;D, eventually leading me to\
  \ a career of more than 25 years in the gaming business, including working at Wizards\
  \ of the Coast on the launch of D&amp;D's third edition in 2000!</p> \n   <p>My\
  \ boss on that 3E team was Ryan Dancey, and when I left Wizards, I told Ryan that\
  \ I'd love to work with him again someday. But our lives diverged; I started Paizo,\
  \ and Ryan went to CCP in Iceland to be the Chief Marketing Officer for the EVE\
  \ Online MMO. We stayed in touch over the years, and after Ryan left CCP earlier\
  \ this year, I asked him what he was going to do next. His answer: \"How about a\
  \ Pathfinder MMO?\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\" style=\"padding: .5em;\">\n\
  \    <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\"><img src=\"/image/content/Logos/Goblinworks_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> Visit <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\"><b>goblinworks.com</b></a>\
  \ for more information about Pathfinder Online!\n   </div> \n   <p>At first I was\
  \ skeptical. I'd heard horror stories about hundreds of millions of dollars lost\
  \ developing games that were never released. Or games that launched with a big splash\
  \ only to become zombies within months, their subscriber base dwindled down to a\
  \ barely sustainable number. But this was Ryan, and I really wanted to work with\
  \ him again. So I challenged him to convince me—to make me a believer. Over the\
  \ next few months, Ryan started developing a plan for this Pathfinder MMO, and I\
  \ started to believe. The plan wasn't 100%, though, so I brought the resources of\
  \ Paizo to bear on it. Erik Mona, Vic Wertz, James Jacobs, Jeff Alvarez, Gary Teter,\
  \ Wes Schneider, Sarah Robinson, and more each contributed unique insight to help\
  \ us come up with a plan for the game—now christened Pathfinder Online—that we could\
  \ all believe in. What we are announcing today is the result of that work.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Pathfinder Online's journey is just beginning. We've started a brand-new\
  \ company called Goblinworks to create the game. At the moment, it's owned by myself,\
  \ Ryan, Paizo, and Mark Kalmes. Mark is one of the top tech guys in the MMO field,\
  \ and he'll be Goblinworks' Chief Technical Officer. (And <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com/investors\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">we're currently looking for additional investors</a> to help\
  \ us move forward with Pathfinder Online.)</p> \n   <p>Traditionally, projects like\
  \ this are developed in secrecy, with information leaking out in whispers for months\
  \ before a formal announcement. But we don't want our loyal customers to find out\
  \ about Pathfinder Online through rumored half-truths; we want you in on the ground\
  \ floor.</p> \n   <p>A lot of big picture work has already been done on Pathfinder\
  \ Online, and it's going to be a bit different from your traditional fantasy MMO.\
  \ It's going to focus around the characters you create, in a world that will grow\
  \ out of your interactions, developing the way you choose to develop it. It takes\
  \ place in the River Kingdoms of Golarion, with our own <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\"\
  >Kingmaker Adventure Path</a> providing some of the inspiration. There will be an\
  \ overarching storyline, and dungeons aplenty to explore, but where Pathfinder Online\
  \ is going to thrive is in the ability of each of you to leave your mark on the\
  \ world. Do you want to build a castle that you own and control? Go for it. Want\
  \ to start a town and rally folks to your banner? Do that. Do you want to ally with\
  \ the neighboring villages to form a new nation—or perhaps wage war on them instead?\
  \ The choice is yours. Want to become the most feared bandit in the River Kingdoms?\
  \ The path is available. Want to become the greatest armorer that Golarion has ever\
  \ seen? All it takes is hard work. If you can imagine doing something in the world\
  \ of Golarion, we want you to be able to do that in Pathfinder Online.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>The fun is just starting! Please use the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/licensees/pathfinderOnline\"\
  >discussion thread</a> here on paizo.com to interact with Ryan, Mark, myself, and\
  \ the rest of the Goblinworks crew as we start this new adventure. We're going to\
  \ be very interactive with you, the Pathfinder community, because we want this game\
  \ to be YOURS. Stay tuned for blogs, trailers, and other teasers as we move forward.\
  \ In true Paizo fashion, we will keep you guys in the loop, and listen to your feedback\
  \ as we progress.</p> \n   <p>Things have come a long way since Akalabeth. Join\
  \ me for the ride and help make Pathfinder Online the best MMORPG ever!</p> \n \
