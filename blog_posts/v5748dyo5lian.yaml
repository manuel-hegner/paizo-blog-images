  \ to be Victorious, it Needs Good Help!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, December\
  \ 8, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Evil is insidious, it's not always the person stabbing\
  \ you in the face repeatedly, but instead, it's the person whispering honeyed words\
  \ into your ears. You've all been victim to it. I've seen you lot, swayed by the\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li3n\">promises of the occult</a>\
  \ or <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li4f\">tales of black markets</a>.\
  \ The crafter of those words was quite skilled. It's my understanding that her hand\
  \ helped guide the words that fill the tome of which I am to speak.</p> \n    <p>What\
  \ am I here to discuss? I'm here to talk about evil. Specifically, I'm here to talk\
  \ about <a href=\"/products/btpy9he0\"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Agents of\
  \ Evil</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>The noblest of soul, or the most depraved mind, can\
  \ willingly walk the path of service to an evil power. It's important to note that\
  \ such bondage does not inherently turn one into a force for evil. In this guide,\
  \ you'll read about bad beginnings, sad stories, and monstrous motivations.</p>\
  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">For those of you without a maligned past or\
  \ similarly dark ambitions, there are evil patrons aplenty—from the Aspis Consortium\
  \ to the Whispering Way—who willingly seek agents to do their bidding. For those\
  \ of you with a more religious bent, the fouler gods of Golarion have much to offer.\
  \ Even those less vile followers of such deities are given their fair respect in\
  \ this book. Asmodeus too takes his rightful place here, and for those of you foolish\
  \ enough to combat the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\"\
  >rightful rule of House Thrune</a>, you may find yourself interested in hearing\
  \ about the Devil Impostors—summoners whose eidolons imitate the traits of hellspawn.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>All can benefit from the knowledge on fighting the supposed 'forces of\
  \ good'. Learn strategies to employ against agathions, angels, archons, and azatas\
  \ alike—most certainly useful for those battling the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\"\
  >rising rabble of the Glorious Reclamation</a>.</p> \n    <p>Contained within the\
  \ intricate script of this tome are poisons of the foulest sort, with additional\
  \ necrotoxins—whose sort you've likely learned of from Golarion's black markets.\
  \ Even the more misunderstood races can learn some skill in service to evil powers,\
  \ from fetchling magi clouding the vision of their enemies, to tiefling alchemists\
  \ brewing bombs of pure hellfire.</p> \n    <p>Ah... it appears I may be telling\
  \ you too much, and our time is growing short.</p> \n    <p>Luckily, there's far\
  \ too many magic items and spells to adequately describe in this place. I could\
  \ discuss the withershot muskets, crafted by the servants of the daemonic harbinger\
  \ Cixyron. Or perhaps you'd like to hear of the Aspis Consortium's success with\
  \ the aboleth-designed ioun spite bracers.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>Interested?</p> \n    <p>Well, I suppose I could tantalize\
  \ you with the necromantic spell blood tentacles that does... well, it does exactly\
  \ what you might expect.</p> \n    <p>Sadly, there's just too much to talk about\
  \ in a place such as this.</p> \n    <p>Except... Well, I wouldn't be properly evil\
  \ without mentioning one last seductive item from this volume of inequity. The insinuator\
  \ is an antipaladin archetype that purely embodies a path of pure self-interest.\
  \ These paragons of self shun bonding with a single deity, instead living an existence\
  \ bartering with any power that seems likely to grant them the power needed to meet\
  \ their own goals.</p> \n    <p>Now I must go. But before I do, I must thank Crystal\
  \ Frasier and Owen K.C. Stephens for the opportunity to work on this book. If anything,\
  \ I am truly an agent of their far-reaching evil.</p> \n    <p>Thurston \"Thursty\"\
