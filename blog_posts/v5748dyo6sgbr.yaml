  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Much of the Kingmaker Adventure Path's\
  \ story involves wilderness exploration and the taming of an untamable land. So\
  \ of course we had to include a lot of \"wilderness monsters\" in <a href=\"/products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>The first of these is\
  \ the imposing smilodon, a saber-toothed tiger from the nearby Realm of the Mammoth\
  \ Lords. This primordial feline takes up the entire base, and makes for a very intimidating\
  \ opponent (or animal companion, if you like that sort of thing). The smilodon is\
  \ an uncommon Large figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-Smilodon_360.png\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Since we're showing off some exceptionally large creatures,\
  \ how about a big-ass frog? You'll be adventuring in the River Kingdoms, after all,\
  \ and that means swamps and rivers and stuff. So I bet you'll be facing a few of\
  \ these amphibious menaces. Despite their size, they remain frogs, so you should\
  \ have no problem making them croak. The giant frog is a common Medium figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-GiantFrog.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-GiantFrog_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Amphibians and reptiles are similar, right? I'm no biologist,\
  \ so I think they're all just different levels of slimyâ€”beasts I'd rather kill than\
  \ touch. So we included a monitor lizard to kill (or touch, if you like that sort\
  \ of thing). Based on new concept art for the Kingmaker CRPG, the purple monitor\
  \ lizard is a common Medium figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \ <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-MonitorLizard.png\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-MonitorLizard_360.png\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Since I'm sure the comments are going to be full of slimy\
  \ creature-lovers yelling at me for being mean, I'll distract you all by showing\
  \ off a creature everyone likes: a swarm! Swarms are tough to do in miniature form,\
  \ because they don't always take a square shape, and they are at their best when\
  \ they are sharing a square with other creatures. That has resulted in many, many\
  \ swarm figures looking more like bumpy coins than the creatures they're meant to\
  \ represent. So we went with a more cinematic look for the army ant swarm, a common\
  \ Medium figure, which is a 4-foot-tall mass of insects that have already stripped\
  \ an earlier victim to the bone.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-ArmyAntSwarm_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, we need a skilled ranger to hunt or tame these\
  \ beasts of the Stolen Lands, and who better to fill that role than the quiet archer,\
  \ Ekundayo, from the <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em> CRPG. A Garundi native of Absalom,\
  \ Ekun makes an excellent PC or ally mini, with his nocked arrow and sweeping cape.\
  \ His rare rarity means he'll remain unique in most collections, making him stand\
  \ out among the myriad bow-wielding ranger figures out there.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ October 24, so keep your eyes tuned to this spot in the coming days. Until then,\
