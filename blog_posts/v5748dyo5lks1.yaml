  \ Guild offerings for <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> when Tyler volunteered\
  \ to help with the </i>Ultimate Intrigue<i> blog, so I happily took him up on the\
  \ offer. I am terribly amused that he's switched his favorite character yet again...\
  \ and this time he technically picked </i>two<i> characters!</i> —Keith Richmond</p>\
  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello again, everyone! Now, I know what you're\
  \ thinking: \"Tyler already told us who his <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lijp\"\
  >favorite character was</a>! Then he told us he lied, and really had a <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo5ljbw\">different favorite character</a>!\" Well, that's\
  \ all true... but we can move past all that now, can't we? Today I'm here to talk\
  \ to you about my <i>new</i> favorite character, Aric. Or as he's known to members\
  \ of the seedy underbelly of the cities of Galt, the Red Raven.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Aric's constant smile and The Red Raven's constant frown are all\
  \ you need to see they're VERY different people. (Who needs glasses, right, Clark?)</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>While the other Ultimate Decks each feature one new character,\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9wmw\"><em>Ultimate Intrigue Add-On Deck</em></a>\
  \ features two! They're most assuredly distinct characters—in the RPG, they even\
  \ have different alignments!—but they are inexorably linked, as you can see from\
  \ the first power on each of their respective character cards.</p> \n    <p>Aric\
  \ is real good at chatting people up, making friends, and getting those friends\
  \ to do favors for him. He's charismatic, charming, and likable. The Red Raven,\
  \ on the other hand, is a creature of the shadows, striking quickly and decisively\
  \ and without mercy. Aric and the Red Raven share a single role card that you flip\
  \ when you switch between their two character cards. It's not hard to figure out\
  \ the basic strategy to deal with different situations: Aric prefers finding and\
  \ acquiring boons and likes to evade encounters with monsters, while the Red Raven\
  \ is all about taking out those monsters, leaving their gear for Aric to clean up.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6830-Infiltrator.jpg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6830-MaskedAvenger_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>As you can see, Aric can easily avoid monsters, leaving them for\
  \ his masked alter-ego to dispatch.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Now, I'm not going\
  \ to say that I love complex ACG characters, but... well, no, I do. I <i>love</i>\
  \ complex ACG characters, and the complexity of the interactions that these characters\
  \ have with boons and banes as you're playing the game is just fantastic. There's\
  \ no better feeling for me than examining the villain as Aric, switching to the\
  \ Red Raven, grabbing a powerful weapon from my kit, then exploring and utterly\
  \ destroying that villain.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6830-AricCharacterBack.jpg\"><img\

  ></a> \n     <p>If you run into a monster as Aric, it's really your own fault, but\
  \ even then you can use your Mancatcher to hold him off while you go put on your\
  \ mask. (Don't ask about the \"real world\" logistics of that, please...)</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Oh, that's right: we haven't discussed the kit yet! Did you\
  \ notice that Aric's deck starts with 18 cards instead of the normal 15? This is\
  \ because Aric and the Red Raven have the unique ability to set aside a few extra\
  \ cards when they draw their starting hand to create the kit, and when you switch\
  \ between the characters, you get to trade a card in your hand for a card in your\
  \ kit! It's a fantastic way to allow two disparate characters to work well with\
  \ the same deck, and it's just one more reason that Aric and The Red Raven are my\
  \ favorite character(s) ever! (And this is definitive—I mean, there's <i>no chance</i>\
  \ that a character in <a href=\"/products/btpy9xdn\">some future release</a> could\
  \ take that place in my heart, right?)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \

  \ iconic vigilante, then I don't know what you did expect...</p>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>But oh, we're not done yet! Apart from the amazing new characters, there\
  \ are tons of exciting new boons in <em>Ultimate Intrigue</em>. From swords that\
  \ you can use to acquire allies in addition to fighting enemies, to spells that\
  \ <i>automatically</i> defeat monsters and make them your friends, to armors that\
  \ keep you from being randomly selected by banes, there really is equipment for\
  \ every character somewhere in this deck.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ no excuse for failing a Diplomacy check. Like, ever.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Ultimate\
  \ Intrigue also holds a plethora of amazing allies. You thought the allies in the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2e\"><em>Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</em></a> were\
