  \ about to hit subscribers, this is a great time to talk about themes and stereotypes\
  \ and writing with intention. You often hear that people insist that their pop culture—\
  their video games, their action movies, their roleplaying games—should be free of\
  \ politics and \"agendas,\" but the truth is that the personal is just politics\
  \ on the small scale. Your own needs, opinions, and preferences become politics\
  \ when shared or opposed by multiple people. As an author or a game developer, at\
  \ some point you have to accept the responsibility that everything you create carries\
  \ cultural weight, that you describe what is and isn't normal, what is and isn't\
  \ moral, who is and isn't a protagonist or a villain or even a person. The orcs\
  \ of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books were self-loathing and aggressive, without\
  \ personal goals or culture, while elves are nuanced and individual and reflect\
  \ a long and storied history—one of these groups is defined as \"people\" while\
  \ the other are faceless opponents. Killing a hundred of one is the background noise\
  \ of the trilogy; killing one of the other is a tragedy that Tolkien uses to dredge\
  \ up emotion in his readers.</p> \n    <p>And yes, I realize the irony of this specific\
  \ example as I talk about an Adventure Path built around conflict with and killing\
  \ hundreds of members of a specific species.</p> \n    <p>These are fictional races,\
  \ but every creative work paints a perspective of the world, and who does and doesn't\
  \ fill what roles. Many creative repeat what we see in the world around us. Some\
  \ of us try to depict idealized worlds we want our world to become. Still others\
  \ exaggerate the evils of the real world into more dire or naked threats, washing\
  \ away the shades grey to highlight change they feel the world needs. There's no\
  \ one right way to wield the influence you have as a creative, except perhaps to\
  \ remain ignorant of it.</p> \n    <p>One of the common themes in the way Paizo\
  \ wields our power is to depict women and minorities as heroes. One of our big goals\
  \ as a group is to paint a world where anyone can be the champion. And we've done\
  \ that well; we've painted women as crusading nights, spellcasters of devastating\
  \ power, freedom fighters, gladiatorial champions, and swashbuckling pirates with\
  \ hearts of gold. Ironfang Invasion specifically kicks off with a female companion\
  \ there to aid and train the PCs as they grow from nobodies into heroes. But sometimes\
  \ that urge to champion a cause can push too far, and we end up putting a group\
  \ on a pedestal. The elves from Tolkien feel flat to a lot of readers because they're\
  \ TOO good and TOO nice and TOO enlightened; even at their worst, they feel like\
  \ overbearing parents, rather than people who make mistakes, dirty their hands,\
  \ or occasionally are just jerks.</p> \n    <p>The one thing Paizo rarely does is\
  \ paint women as jerks.</p> \n    <p>That's not to say we never portray female villains.\
  \ Queen Ileosa, Areelu Vorlesh, and Queen Abrogail Thrune are unabashedly wicked.\
  \ The Inner Sea region in general overflows with evil women rulers. All of a certain\
  \ type: politically powerful, charismatic, and conventionally attractive. Pathfinder\
  \ has plenty of female villains.</p> \n    <p>Like I said: The one thing we rarely\
  \ portray are female jerks. The scum. The bastards. The glorious panoply of disreputable\
  \ antagonists. Women in Pathfinder or fiction in general are rarely allowed to be\
  \ dirty and violent and unladylike. One of our goals in <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion\"\
  >Ironfang Invasion</a> was to portray a huge variety of female antagonists, from\
  \ the traditional \"sexy spellcaster\" like Arlantia (you'll meet her next month),\
  \ to masters of tactics and arms like Azersi and Kosseruk, to crazed cultists like\
  \ Naphexi, to violently anti-social scum like Jang and the redcap Dearga Finlay.\
  \ In <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9pn4\"><em>Siege of Stone</em></a>,\
  \ author Thurston Hillman gives us the small-potatoes gang leader in Origa, the\
  \ lecherous bully in Chief Grax, the condescending intellectual in Zanathura, the\
  \ greedy mercenary in Kisegar, and the scheming manipulator in Elacnida.</p> \n\

  \ and heroes—Aubrin, Gendowyn, Navah, the overeager treant Longfrond—but Ironfang\
  \ Invasion is also packed full of women being every flavor of villainous and objectionable—\
  an important facet of representation oft forgotten in our efforts to display a given\
  \ group as varied, diverse, and fallible. Save your pedestals for statues, and let\
  \ the women of the Ironfang Invasion scheme, belch, and stab their way into your\
  \ hearts.</p> \n    <p>Crystal Frasier<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n   </div> <!--\
