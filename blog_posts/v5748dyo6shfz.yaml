  \      </div> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hey, Pathfinder fans! It’s Mark\
  \ Moreland, your friendly neighborhood Director of Brand Strategy, with a bit of\
  \ exciting news about web fiction over the next few months. Today, to celebrate\
  \ the release of the second-edition <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox\"\
  >Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> next week, we’re launching the first chapter of a serialized\
  \ novella by fan-favorite author, Liane Merciel (<em>Nightglass, Nightblade, Hellknight</em>).</p>\
  \ \n      <p><em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em> takes place in the town of Otari,\
  \ pictured here, which serves as the setting for not only the Beginner Box, but\
  \ also the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023dy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari\"\
  ><em>Troubles in Otari</em></a> adventure and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationVaults\"\
  >Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</a>. Like new players taking their first steps\
  \ into the game and world of Pathfinder with the Beginner Box and our other Otari\
  \ content, the heroes of this tale are new to adventuring, but quickly find themselves\
  \ embroiled in a plot that could threaten the entire town.</p> \n      <p>This return\
  \ to long-form Pathfinder fiction also gave us another opportunity to try something\
  \ new, so after this week, you won’t see the remaining chapters of <em>The Shroud\
  \ of Four Silences</em> here on the Paizo Blog. Instead, you can get each week’\
  s chapter emailed directly to you by ensuring you have opted in to receive “Products,\
  \ Offers, News, and Events” emails in your <a href=\"https://paizo.com/paizo/account/settings/privacy\"\
  >account privacy settings</a>. We’ll still have Otari-related blogs coming out on\
  \ Wednesdays for the duration of <em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em>’s release,\
  \ but they’ll be encounters, No-Prep Characters, and other content you can use at\
  \ your table. If they happen to also be relevant to the current chapter of Eleukas,\
  \ Wendlyn, and their companions’ story, I’m sure that will be entirely accidental.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>So without further ado, I present to you: <em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em>.</p>\

  \ \n     <center>\n      <h3>WORK DETAIL</h3>\n     </center> \n     <p>Come on,”\
  \ Eleukas coaxed. “Just one more load and you’re done.”</p> \n     <p>“’One more\
  \ load,’ he says,” Wendlyn muttered, flexing her scratched and sawdust-smeared shoulders.\
  \ “’One more.’ My arms are about to fall off, and he wants me to cheer up because\
  \ there’s ‘just one more load.’”</p> \n     <p>“You were the one who opted for a\
  \ work detail over a night in the cells.” Otari’s lumber companies gave away their\
  \ split, hollowed, and beetle-weakened discards for firewood, provided people used\
  \ their own carts to haul the loads away. Wood splitting was one of Captain Longsaddle’\
  s favorite punishment details, since the Otari Garrison was in perpetual need of\
  \ firewood, and whatever they didn’t use could be given to townspeople too ill or\
  \ infirm to chop their own. The need never ended, which meant the work never ended.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Well, <em>obviously</em> A night in the cells is a night in the cells.\
  \ Rats, damp, terrible food. Whereas with this, I’m out in the fresh air and sunshine,\
  \ plus you end up doing all the work.” Wendlyn dragged another hollow log over to\
  \ Eleukas’s stump and dropped it.</p> \n     <p>“You could always stop stealing\
  \ things,” Eleukas pointed out, heaving the log into position and hefting his hatchet.\
  \ A maul would have been more efficient, but efficiency wasn’t the point of punishment\
  \ details. “What’d you get this time? A handful of coins from some drunk sailor?\
  \ Was it really worth it?”</p> \n     <p>It was the closest he’d ever come to openly\
  \ chastising his friend for her unending larceny, and Eleukas held his breath for\
  \ a beat, afraid he’d pushed their friendship too far. To fill the silence, he began\
  \ hacking at the log, splitting it neatly with a few sharp blows.</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ Wendlyn just shrugged and went back to the reject heap for another log. “When\
  \ else do I get to see my oldest friend? Seems like these work details are our only\
  \ chance to catch up.”</p> \n     <p>That stung. Eleukas contented himself with\
  \ splintering the new log as he tried to think of a response. It was true that since\
  \ he’d joined the Otari Guard, he hadn’t had much time to sit around in taverns\
  \ with his friends, even though—or maybe because—he was only a raw recruit and felt\
  \ so far behind in his training. There was always some new technique to learn, or\
  \ another bit of wisdom to pry from some grizzled veteran, and he was so full of\
  \ questions about his new life that sometimes he forgot to keep up with the old\
  \ one.</p> \n     <p>It really was only on these work details, when Eleukas contrived\
  \ to get himself assigned to guard duty after Wendlyn’s latest arrest, that he saw\
  \ her anymore. And it was true that he volunteered to do most of the work, partly\
  \ because he felt so guilty about letting their friendship lapse, even though she\
  \ was the one who was supposed to be improving her character through labor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Maybe I could—” he began, but Wendlyn cut him off with a sudden, intent\
  \ look at the tree line beyond the lumber yard.</p> \n     <p>“Did you hear that?”\
  \ She rose up on her toes, leaning toward the forest like a hound casting for scent.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Eleukas mopped his brow, pushing sweat-soaked black curls aside. He\
  \ hadn’t heard anything over the thunk and thud of splitting wood, but her half-elven\
  \ ears had always been better than his.</p> \n     <p>“No,” he started to say, cautiously,\
  \ when a scream split the sap-scented air.</p> \n     <p>It was a howl of raw rage,\
  \ and although Eleukas couldn’t have said whether it was made by person or beast,\
  \ he knew it was a battle cry.</p> \n     <p>“Come on.” Wendlyn was already running\
  \ toward the trees. “Bring your axe.”</p> \n     <p>Eleukas didn’t waste any more\
  \ time with questions. Otari was a close-knit town, where you helped your neighbors\
  \ if they needed it, and the forest could be dangerous. Kobolds, wild animals, worse.\
  \ There were even rumors of saboteurs targeting the log flume that was Otari’s economic\
  \ lifeblood, and though Eleukas didn’t like to credit such tales, that cry <em>had</em>\
  \ come from the direction of the flume.</p> \n     <p>Gripping the sweaty hatchet,\
  \ he ran after her.</p> \n     <p>Branches whipped Eleukas’s face and undergrowth\
  \ snarled at his feet as he charged through the wood, trying to keep Wendlyn in\
  \ view. The half-elf darted through the trees as easily as a shuttle through thread,\
  \ and if it hadn’t been for the bright blaze of her red ponytail waving through\
  \ the greenery, he’d have lost her. Wendlyn never remembered to wait for anyone\
  \ slower than she was.</p> \n     <p>Ahead, the clattering bulk of Giant’s Wheel\
  \ loomed over the treetops, creaking and grinding and throwing a rhythmic rain up\
  \ to the sky as it harnessed the Osprey River’s power to carry logs down to the\
  \ sea. Its immense clacking rush drowned out anything as small as a human voice,\
  \ but Eleukas didn’t need to listen for screams anymore. He could see the person\
  \ who’d made them.</p> \n     <p>No, not person. Corpse.</p> \n     <p>Even as he\
  \ crashed through the forest’s edge and heaved for breath in the clearing beyond,\
  \ Eleukas registered the unnatural angle of the neck, the blood that drenched the\
  \ clothes, the terrible gaping wounds in throat and torso. He’d never actually seen\
  \ a person murdered before, but he knew immediately that it was too late to save\
  \ this man. And he knew it would be scorched onto his memory forever: a thing he\
  \ had trained for, a thing he had expected, and a thing for which he could never\
  \ have been prepared.</p> \n     <p>The fight wasn’t over, even if its first victim\
  \ was dead. Two patchy-furred rats, each the size of a large dog, were menacing\
  \ Wendlyn with loud hisses and bared fangs. The bright afternoon sun didn’t cow\
  \ them, and neither did the darting thrusts of her short sword. The rodents worked\
  \ with uncanny coordination, one feinting at Wendlyn to draw her attention while\
  \ the other lunged in to bite.</p> \n     <p>Eleukas had never seen Wendlyn fight\
  \ before, and was surprised by how deftly she handled her blade. He’d always assumed\
  \ she just carried it as an affectation, but it was clear she’d had some real training.\
  \ She was holding her own against the rats. One was bleeding from its jaw, and the\
  \ other bore a deep cut along its ribs, although they’d torn their share of ugly\
  \ scratches across Wendlyn in return.</p> \n     <p>“I’m here!” Eleukas shouted,\
  \ hoping to distract them. One of the rats turned on him, snarling. He swung at\
  \ it but missed. The rat snapped at him, sharp teeth grazing the hair on his forearm.\
  \ Its spittle flecked him like warm rain.</p> \n     <p>Adjusting his footing, Eleukas\
  \ tried again. This time he read the animal’s momentum and chopped low in the other\
  \ direction, misjudging the aim a little—the hatchet was designed for splitting\
  \ firewood, and was considerably shorter and smaller than the battle axe he normally\
  \ used—but catching the rat hard in the forequarters all the same.</p> \n     <p>Bones\
  \ crunched, and the rat fell squealing. Yet the other one, to Eleukas’s astonishment,\
  \ didn’t run. Its greasy brown fur puffed up higher, its spine arched stiffer, and\
  \ its hisses grew louder. Despite the posturing, it seemed oddly reluctant to commit,\
  \ hopping back and forth just out of reach instead of coming at either of them.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A second later, Eleukas realized why. It wasn’t alone. Something stirred\
  \ in the underbrush, creeping toward them as the rat spat and snarled in distraction.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“You take the rodent,” Eleukas said, standing back-to-back with Wendlyn\
  \ so he could focus on the new threat.</p> \n     <p>It was hard to pick out from\
  \ the leaves. He glimpsed a gaunt, clawed black hand, its skin hard and glossy as\
  \ polished leather, its nails curved into sharp talons. The body was a shapeless\
  \ mass of damp fur or filthy rags, blending into the brush so that Eleukas couldn’\
  t guess its size. And the face—</p> \n     <p>When he saw its face, he froze. There\
  \ was no face. From the stump of its neck rose a vortex of shadow, sucking inward\
  \ to an infinitude of nothing.</p> \n     <p>The emptiness at the core of that non-face\
  \ dragged Eleukas’s consciousness into its chilling depths. He felt, in some place\
  \ beyond rational thought, that if he let it pull him in, he would be torn apart\
  \ and devoured so completely that nothing of his mind or soul or awareness could\
  \ remain.</p> \n     <p>Terror closed cold around his heart. Fear swallowed every\
  \ shred of reason in his mind. And then, just as Eleukas braced himself to try,\
  \ somehow, to pull away from the deadly grip of the whirlpooling dark, a plume of\
  \ soft black powder blew up from the depths of that devouring emptiness into his\
  \ face.</p> \n     <p>Blindness seized him. He couldn’t see, couldn’t breathe. A\
  \ thick warm wall choked the air away from his gasping mouth. Eleukas tried to scream,\
  \ but that heavy, blanketing warmth buried the cry in his throat.</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ fell, suffocating, into oblivion</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight:\
