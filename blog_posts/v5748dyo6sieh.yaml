  \   </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi everyone!\
  \ James here to talk a little bit about the Remaster project. We're getting closer\
  \ and closer to <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> and <em>GM Core</em>releasing in\
  \ November. To shine a little more light on what's coming, the marketing team and\
  \ us thought we would kick off a blog series going into some of our changes in a\
  \ little more depth. We'll start things off with a class, the wizard!</p> \n   \
  \   <p>The wizard is the classic arcane spellcaster who learns magic in the most\
  \ academic way: institutions, tomes, tutors and the like, and we wanted this to\
  \ come through in how the class feels to build and play, so expect to see some more\
  \ references to training, incantations, runes, spell formulas, and the like in the\
  \ feats and features.</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <table class=\"image\"\

  \       <tbody>\n        <tr>\n         <td><a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/785cbfea-1212-4d3e-bfcf-da716e1cfb8f/P2_Iconic_Ezren_1000x1500.png\"\

  \ align=\"left\" width=\"350\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"Pathfinder Iconic,\
  \ human wizard, Ezren\"></a></td>\n        </tr> \n       </tbody>\n      </table>\
  \ \n      <p>While the wizard was generally already providing a satisfying play\
  \ experience at the table, it was also a class that interacts very heavily with\
  \ one of the larger changes we’re making in the Remaster, which is the removal of\
  \ the eight schools of magic that were deeply tied to rules we were using via the\
  \ OGL. Though this presented a big challenge in remastering the class, it also let\
  \ us solve one of the biggest frustrations of the wizard, which is that there wasn't\
  \ a whole lot of space left for them to expand. One of the most commonly requested\
  \ expansions for any class is additional major paths to build your characters along,\
  \ but because the wizard schools already had all eight schools of magic that could\
  \ ever exist in the setting (plus universalist), we could never increase the number\
  \ of wizard schools or explore more interesting options beyond those preset themes.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The new role for arcane schools is as just that: actual mages' curricula\
  \ in Golarion. This allows us to make much more tightly focused schools that really\
  \ let you sell the theme of your wizard, from the tactical spells of the School\
  \ of Battle Magic (<em>fireball</em>, <em>resist energy</em>, <em>weapon storm</em>,\
  \ <em>true target</em> and the like) to the infrastructure-focused spells of the\
  \ School of Civic Wizardry (<em>hydraulic push</em> for firefighting, <em>summon\
  \ construct</em> and <em>wall of stone</em> for construction, <em>pinpoint</em>\
  \ and <em>water walk</em> for search and rescue, and <em>earthquake</em> and <em>disintegrate</em>\
  \ for controlled demolitions). We've also rearranged the existing wizard focus spells\
  \ and, in some places, changed them a little bit to fit their new locations—the\
  \ School of Mentalism's <em>charming push</em> focus spell functions much like the\
  \ original enchanter's <em>charming words</em>, but the new spell doesn't have the\
  \ auditory or linguistic traits, since the School of Mentalism is much more about\
  \ direct mind magic.</p> \n      <p>This also opens the door to create more schools\
  \ in the future based on the specific schools of magic in the setting, and I know\
  \ my colleagues in the Lost Omens line have already started thinking of what some\
  \ of these might be (they have, as yet, sadly rejected my suggestion for a goblin-themed\
  \ wizard school containing mostly fire and pickling spells).</p> \n      <p>We haven't\
  \ just remastered the schools; we wanted to go through the feats as well and give\
  \ the wizard a few fun toys to underscore <s>how they're nerds</s> their academic\
  \ mastery of magic. Some of these are tools originally developed in other places\
  \ that make perfect sense for a wizard to have, like the Knowledge Is Power magus\
  \ feat (with a few wizard-specific adjustments). We also gave the wizards some new\
  \ feats, like the following:</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <blockquote>\
  \ \n       <p><strong><u>Secondary Detonation Array [one-action] Feat 14</u></strong></p>\
  \ \n       <p><strong>Manipulate, Spellshape, Wizard</strong></p> \n       <p>You\
  \ divert some of your spell’s energy into an unstable runic array. If your next\
  \ action is to Cast a Spell that deals damage, has no duration, and affects an area,\
  \ a glowing magic circle appears in a 5-foot burst within that area. At the beginning\
  \ of your next turn, the circle detonates, dealing 1d6 force damage per rank of\
  \ the spell to all creatures within the circle, with a basic Reflex save against\
  \ your spell DC. If the spell dealt a different type of damage, the circle deals\
  \ this type of damage instead (or one type of your choice if the spell could deal\
  \ multiple types of damage).</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>This feat ties\
  \ into some of the flavor tweaks we've made to wizards to have them talk about their\
  \ abilities a little more academically, and it's burst of damage is one that requires\
  \ a little bit of forethought in strategy to get the most out of, something that\
  \ a spellcaster whose key attribute is Intelligence might gravitate toward.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>That's our look at the wizard! Of course, what would a wizard be without\
  \ their spells? Check back in on Thursday, where we'll go over some of the updates\
  \ to magic coming in the remaster, from new spells to some of the new rules for\
  \ spellcasting!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
