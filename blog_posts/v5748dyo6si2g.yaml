  \ itemprop=\"description\">I’m gonna drop a hot take at the top of this blog: I\
  \ think PaizoCon was a success this year! Everybody who’d been there before couldn’\
  t help but comment on how different it felt, but as someone with no base of reference,\
  \ I had a great time. We ran over 100 Organized Play games in the ballroom, including\
  \ our first hybrid special. I got to hang out with some of my awesome coworkers\
  \ and meet some fantastic community members, and I spent way too much money in our\
  \ store!</p> \n      <p>No, it wasn’t a perfect show. There are things to iron out\
  \ before Gen Con and things to improve for next year. A non-zero number of people\
  \ (myself included) tested positive for COVID after the show (I’m doing fine, thanks\
  \ for asking). Overall, I’m so thrilled with my first physical PaizoCon</p> \n \
  \     <p>I have a <em>ton</em> of things to talk about in this blog—it might be\
  \ the longest blog I’ve ever written—so strap in, and let’s blast through these\
  \ updates!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Digital Releases</h2> \n      <p>Here are\
  \ this month’s digital releases, available June 29, 2022.</p> \n      <h3>Pathfinder</h3>\

  >Illustration by Nicholas Phillips</p> \n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Year\
  \ of Boundless Wonder</h2> \n      <p>At our PaizoCon panel, Pathfinder Society\
  \ developer Mike Kimmel announced the title for Year 4: Year of Boundless Wonder!\
  \ We’re very excited for this new metaplot, featuring a treasure hoard full of wondrous\
  \ items and treacherous secrets. More information about the year’s stories, as well\
  \ as any rule changes, will be forthcoming between now and the year’s launch at\
  \ Gen Con Indy and Gen Con Online. For now, be sure to check out our panel on YouTube\
  \ and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si20\">the announcement\
  \ blog</a>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Achievement Points Update</h2> \n     \
  \ <p>I have good news and bad news!</p> \n      <p>The good news: last week, tech\
  \ rolled a code update that, among other things, should start every new player with\
  \ 80 Achievement Points for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Society and retroactively\
  \ grant those points to current players as well. One of the most consistent complaints\
  \ about the program at large is that new players can’t play weird characters from\
  \ the jump. This 80 AcP grant is enough to purchase an uncommon ancestry, some new\
  \ character options, or just resurrect your character a couple of times after making…\
  \ <em>interesting</em> choices. We hope that this will ease a new player’s introduction\
  \ to the system and benefit those of you who have been working diligently to save\
  \ up for something shiny as well!</p> \n      <p>The bad news: doing so apparently\
  \ broke AcP entirely in new and exciting ways. We’ve had reports of some people\
  \ not seeing the grant yet, and other reports of events not awarding AcP for sessions\
  \ anymore. Obviously, this is a problem, and tech is actively working on fixing\
  \ it. Please know that fixing this is my highest priority, and I hope to see the\
  \ issues resolved soon. Thank you all so much for your patience!</p> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <h2>PFS Faction Pins</h2> \n      <p>A couple of months ago on Paizo Live!,\
  \ I announced that we’d be getting new faction pins in the store for PaizoCon. Unfortunately,\
  \ thanks to shipping chaos, they missed it by <em>one day</em> and arrived just\
  \ after the show closed. Luckily, they’re now available in the Paizo store!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02du2?Paizo-Organized-Play-Pin\"\
  >Paizo Organized Play</a><br> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dtz?Pathfinder-Society-Faction-Pin-Envoy-s-Alliance\"\

  >Vigilant Seal</a></p> \n      <p>The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay/perks\"\
  >Accessory Perks</a> page has had an update in the works for some time. Now that\
  \ these pins have arrived, that will hopefully be the motivation I need to put the\
  \ final touches on the page and get it live so that these pins provide an in-game\
  \ benefit. Until then, enjoy the bling!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Major Convention\

  \ \n      <p>We released a <em>ton</em> of products, and sanctioning for other products,\
  \ in May. So many that I don’t have time for fun commentary and I’m just going to\

  \ \n      </ul> \n      <br> \n      <h2>New FAQ Answers</h2> \n      <p>Prior to\
  \ PaizoCon, we posted a couple of new answers to crafting-related questions on the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq\">PFS FAQ page</a>. I will reproduce\
  \ the text here, but the most current version can always be found on that page.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Can I upgrade permanent items?</b><br> Yes, players may upgrade\
  \ permanent magical items or items made from special materials using the Crafting\
  \ rules on page 535 of the Core Rulebook. Players may not upgrade adventuring gear\
  \ or consumable items in this manner.</p> \n      <p><b>Can I pay the cost difference\
  \ to upgrade a permanent item instead of using Craft to do it myself?</b><vr />\
  \ Yes. The Pathfinder Society has numerous crafters that assist their fellow agents.\
  \ Use the rules for upgrading magic items on page 535 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n      <h3>Campaign Coins</h3> \n\
  \      <p>At PaizoCon, we awarded six new Campaign Service Coins. These Coins are\
  \ given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support\
  \ their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers\
  \ may be nominated by emailing organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, region and\
  \ a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope\
  \ to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’\
  re attending is also useful.</p> \n      <p>Congratulations to: David Peever, who\
  \ now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#852</b><br> Jocelyn Hamilton,\
  \ who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#853</b><br> Preston Hudson,\
  \ who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#854</b><br> Dennis Muldoon,\
  \ who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#855</b><br> Glen Parnell,\
  \ who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#856</b><br> Nicole Heits,\
  \ who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#857</b></p> \n      <h3>GM\
  \ Ranks</h3> \n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in\
  \ any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone,\
  \ a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10\
  \ special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n      <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th\
  \ Star for PFS1 and one GM earn their 5th Nova for SFS.</p> \n      <p><b>5th Star</b>:\
  \ LeRoy Byrd</p> \n      <p><b>5th Nova</b>: Nikolaus Beattie</p> \n      <p>Congratulations\
  \ to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you’\
  ve achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n      <p>In addition to our\
  \ major shows, convention season is in full swing! We have tons of events around\
  \ the world scheduled for this summer, and we encourage you to support your local\
  \ shows! Any convention that has filed for event support can be found on our <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">conventions calendar</a>.</p> \n      <p>Until\
  \ next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the Year of Redemption’s Rise!</p>\
