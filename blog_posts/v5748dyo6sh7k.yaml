  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Janira consults her notes,\
  \ then stares at the box in her hands. She feels around the carved surface, fingers\
  \ tracing the grooves etched in the wood. She pauses, her fingers splayed across\
  \ the surface, as she looks back to the parchment spread out in front of her. Holding\
  \ still, her fingers not moving from their assigned points on the box, she skims\
  \ the notes again, then looks up at the grey-robed Pathfinder Initiate sitting across\
  \ from her.</p> \n      <p>“Okay, Sidney! Before I apply pressure, I want you to\
  \ confirm I’ve got the right points.” </p> \n      <p>The initiate reaches for the\
  \ notes sitting before Janira, pulling the paper closer to them. Reading off the\
  \ list of notes, they indicate pressure points necessary to open the box. </p> \n\
  \      <p>“Rose. Nasturtium. Gallardia. Poppy. Anemones. Strawberry. Primrose. Viola,”\
  \ they intone.</p> \n      <p>Janira turns the box, careful not to move her fingers.\
  \ “Check! Alright, step back now. If something goes wrong, only one of us needs\
  \ to pay the consequences.”</p> \n      <p>Sidney moves across the room and opens\
  \ the door, weight shifted to the balls of their feet for quick movement. They turn\
  \ and look at Janira. “Are you sure you don’t want help?”</p> \n      <p>“Nope.\
  \ I got this!” she replies cheerily, though a slight waver underlies her concern.\
  \ “Ready?”</p> \n      <p>She applies pressure, her fingers depressing the centers\
  \ of the flowers. A faint click echoes from deep inside the box. She smiles and\
  \ tries to lift the top. Unsuccessful, she sighs. “Nope. Back to the notes. This\
  \ puzzle won’t answer itself.”</p> \n      <p>Sidney returns to her side, shaking\
  \ their head. “Unfortunate. We thought we had the answer.”</p> \n      <p>Janira\
  \ frowns briefly and lets out a little sigh. “Not this time. But we won’t give up.\
  \ There are more records to comb and papers to go through. How about you head down\
  \ to the library and see if they’ve dug up any more information. I’ll go check with\
  \ Master of Scrolls Kreighton Shaine and see if he’s in a mood to talk about the\
  \ box or still waxing poetic about the new blooms in the south garden.”</p> \n \
  \     <p>Clapping Sidney on the shoulder, Janira smiles. “Don’t give up hope, Sidney.\
  \ We’ll get through this sooner or later.”</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \  <hr> \n      <p>A quick Pathfinder Society (second edition) Achievement Point\
  \ (AcP) update. We’ve dug into the issues, kicked a few things loose, and as a result,\
  \ seen some changes in player and GM AcP numbers. Unfortunately, they still aren’\
  t reflecting all games at the right totals. Looking into the number discrepancies,\
  \ we think we have identified some of the issues holding back the rollout of Achievement\
  \ Points. This week, we’re working on some implementation plans and will have another\
  \ update next week as part of the May Update!</p> \n      <p>For those that didn’\
