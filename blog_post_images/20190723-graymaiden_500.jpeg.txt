| summary  = The Gray Maiden. A fully armoured warrior with a matching shield almost as tall as they are. The shield is pointed at each end, edged in gold, and has a rune in red across the front. The Gray Maiden also wears an armoured face mask, a plume of red hair flowing from the back. Her cape is almost the same color as her hair. She wields a long sword in her right hand.
