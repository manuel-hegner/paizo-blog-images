  s a Desna?</h2>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Some two-hundred months ago,\
  \ I was a wrecked ball of frazzled nerves as I waited for the verdict to come in\
  \ on the very first Pathfinder Adventure Path. This was before Pathfinder was its\
  \ own RPG, and while I had experience writing and developing three previous Adventure\
  \ Paths, this was the first one that wasn’t tied to an established world.</p>\n\
  \      <p>We were starting from scratch.</p>\n      <p>Not only was my adventure,\
  \ “Burnt Offerings,” kicking off the first Pathfinder Adventure Path, but that volume\
  \ also had to present a brand new campaign setting, complete with its own pantheon\
  \ of gods, new weapons and items, world maps, new monsters, and more, all at the\
  \ same time. Before “Burnt Offerings,” no one knew what a starknife was, who Desna\
  \ was, or where Sandpoint was but me. All of those things (and quite a bit more)\
  \ were part of my homebrew campaign, exported into the new Paizo setting largely\
  \ as a time-saving stunt so that we didn’t have to build everything from nothing\
  \ in a few months of frenzied creativity. Fortunately, we had an entire company\
  \ of incredibly creative folks and amazing artists (in particular Wayne Reynolds\
  \ and his iconic goblins) to support the adventure, and by the time that first Adventure\
  \ Path came to a close, Golarion was off to the races.</p>\n      <p>And so here\
  \ we are, waiting for the 200th volume of the Pathfinder Adventure Path to hit store\
  \ shelves, and I just wanted to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of the folks\
  \ who helped keep this thing going over the years—and to all of the gamers who kept\
  \ their subscriptions going and spent countless hours exploring the adventures we’\
  ve been creating. You’re all the reason we made it this far, after all, and unlike\
  \ the first time I wrote about Sandpoint and its many troubles, this time I’m confident\
  \ it’s here to stay.</p>\n      <p>Well... unless one of those seven dooms gets\
  \ loose and has its way!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\

  \      <br>\n      <h2>Shadows Under Sandpoint</h2>\n      <p>Coming back to Sandpoint\
  \ to celebrate the 200th volume of the Pathfinder Adventure Path isn’t just a return\
  \ to the site of the very first Pathfinder adventure back in our very first volume\
  \ in 2007—it’s a return to the town where the Pathfinder RPG was truly born, in\
  \ the very first Paizo office campaign to use the new rules. As players around the\
  \ world were playing one of our first four Adventure Paths, the Paizo creative staff\
  \ itself (or at least a very large portion of it) gathered in our office conference\
  \ room to explore James Jacobs’s Shadows Under Sandpoint campaign.</p>\n      <p>Players\
  \ like Jason Bulmahn, F. Wesley Schneider, Rob McCreary, PaizoCon co-founder Tim\
  \ Nightengale, Sean K Reynolds, Christopher Paul Carey, James L. Sutter, and more\
  \ gathered weekly to explore the town, facing off against foes like Pillbug Podiker,\
  \ the menacing undead Kanker, the maddening Red Bishop, and even the Sandpoint Devil\
  \ itself in a campaign that spanned the first few years of the Pathfinder RPG era.\
  \ Traces of these adventures have appeared in previous Pathfinder products. The\
  \ old <em>Pathfinder Chronicles NPC Guide</em> contained early stats for the characters\
  \ of everyone listed above, and in the few times we’ve revisited Sandpoint in print\
  \ since Rise of the Runelords, more NPCs and other plot developments have worked\
  \ their way in, a palimpsest record of our original adventures hidden between the\
  \ sheets of official Pathfinder material. Heck, my own character in James’s game,\
  \ Ostog the Unslain, is now a genuine regent in the Land of the Linnorm Kings, a\
  \ development right out of the final session of that old office campaign.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Now, with <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em>, James has pulled together\
  \ all these threads into a new narrative that features many of the same challenges\
  \ and foes that went into our original game—an office game that literally influenced\
  \ the development of the Pathfinder rules and world more than perhaps any other.</p>\n\
  \      <p>It’s not every day that a monthly periodical manages 200 volumes. The\
  \ predecessor to Pathfinder Adventure Path, the venerable <em>Dungeon Magazine</em>,\
  \ only lasted 150 issues. A rare milestone like this calls for reflection, and for\
  \ celebration. We hope you enjoy facing off against the Seven Dooms just like we\
  \ did in the Paizo offices more than a decade ago, when we weren’t even sure Pathfinder\
  \ would last 20 volumes, let alone 200.</p>\n      <p>Here's to Sandpoint, to Pathfinder,\
  \ and to at least 200 more months of adventure on the road ahead!</p>\n      <p\

  \      <br>\n      <h2>This is Where I Came In</h2>\n      <p>Let’s fiddle with\
  \ the <em>Scepter of Ages</em> a little and bounce back to the quieter times of\
  \ 2007. I learn that the excellent <em>Dungeon</em> and <em>Dragon</em><em>Magazines</em>are\
  \ ceasing publication and Paizo, this little company that put the excellence into\
  \ those magazines says that they’ve got this monthly Pathfinder thing they’re making\
  \ that will carry the torch of the Adventure Path forward. I liked their stewardship\
  \ of the magazines, so I took the option to roll my subscription over to this new\
  \ endeavor. When “Burnt Offerings” (<em>Pathfinder Adventure Path</em> #1) arrived\
  \ at my house, I was greeted with a tale of evil wizards from a forgotten empire\
  \ waking into a world already full of uncertainty and hard people eking out a living\
  \ in a remote corner. And goblins. Delightfully maniacal goblins. I immediately\
  \ volunteered to run it for my group as soon as we wrapped our current campaign.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Maybe it’s because it was my first taste or maybe it was because the place\
  \ oozed with colorful characters full of life (and potential conflict), but Sandpoint\
  \ has been a gold standard of the small fantasy town in my eyes. It’s small enough\
  \ to have that “everyone knows everyone else’s business” thing going, but big enough\
  \ that there’s always some shady goings on when the town goes to sleep.</p>\n  \
  \    <p>Years later, I joined the company while we were working on “Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles”—so, well after most of the foundational Runelords work was done or the\
  \ return to Sandpoint in “Jade Regent”—but I helped out with “Shattered Star,” wrote\
  \ for “Return of the Runelords,” and developed both <em>Sandpoint: Light of the\
  \ Lost Coast</em> and this—the 200th volume of the Pathfinder Adventure Path, a\
  \ return to Sandpoint to save the first town I came to love in the world of Golarion.\
  \ I in no way created Sandpoint or the Runelord saga—that’s James’ crown to bear—\
  but I’d like to think I’ve guided it a bit.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
