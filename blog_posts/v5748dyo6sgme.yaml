  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I hope this May Day finds you\
  \ enjoying good weather and getting ready for the turn of the seasons. For those\
  \ of our friends in the Southern Hemisphere, shorter days herald the coming of winter,\
  \ but hopefully, you can get a few more rays of sunshine before the first flakes\
  \ fall.</p> \n    <p>In the office, convention preparations take up much of the\
  \ team's time. On a positive note, scenario development proceeds at a good clip,\
  \ and we look forward to getting the scenarios into the hands of our convention\
  \ GMs. As the developers finished with the new special events, they finalized some\
  \ outstanding points and identified information that would aid player participation.\
  \ To reach as broad an audience as possible, we decided a short blog that could\
  \ be linked via social media and other information outlets would be the best option.\
  \ If you know of someone that would benefit from the information, please pass a\
  \ link to this blog on to them.</p> \n    <p>As a general practice, when scheduling\
  \ the special events at PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con, we separate out each subtier\
  \ and assign GMs accordingly. This helps with the amount of prep work needed by\
  \ the GM, and it makes sure we have the right number of tables at each sub-tier.\
  \ As registration for these events open, please know we are watching the ticket\
  \ sales and will make adjustments to the number of tables in each subtier accordingly.\
  \ It is important to register for events in a subtier you are willing and able to\
  \ play, as the opportunity for trading levels is almost non-existent onsite. Reminder\
  \ for those playing #10-98: Siege of Gallowspire, not only are tickets sold by subtier,\
  \ they are divided up into Soldier and Champion. See the entry below for more information\
  \ on those terms.</p> \n    <p>I turn now to our team of developers working on the\
  \ special events—Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton and Society developers\
  \ Linda Zayas-Palmer and Thurston Hillman—for specific scenario details.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Pathfinder Society (1st edition) #10-98: Siege of Gallowspire (For Levels\
  \ 5-16)</h2> \n    <p>Soldier is a little bit harder than a typical Pathfinder Society\
  \ Special. Champion is a full-on Hard Mode.</p> \n    <p>Regarding other characters.\
  \ You can bring up to three additional PCs of level 5-20 to the game. These PCs\
  \ are called <em>Aid Characters</em>. Aid Characters can generate more powerful\
  \ aid tokens, and they can also participate in special Aid Missions. The higher\
  \ level the Aid Character, the better they are likely to do at challenges.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The only thing you need to bring for an Aid Character is that PC's most\
  \ recent Chronicle sheet fully filled out. You may want to bring their character\
  \ sheets too, particularly if you don't remember the characters that well and you'd\
  \ like to roleplay them a bit. Aid characters must be your own PCs.</p> \n    <p>If\
  \ you don't have PCs at the appropriate level, you can instead enlist the aid of\
  \ 4th level NPC Pathfinders by using the iconic pregenerated characters. These NPCs\
  \ aren't as capable as your own PCs would be, but they can still help out.</p> \n\
  \    <p>You may have heard from previous discussions of the idea of changing which\
  \ PC you are playing mid-session. That is no longer part of the scenario.</p> \n\

  \ information!</a></p> \n    <h2>Starfinder Society #2-00: Fate of the Scoured God\
  \ (For Levels 1-10)</h2> \n    <p>We're pleased to announce that the upcoming Starfinder\
  \ Society interactive special (<em>Starfinder Society #2–00: Fate of the Scoured\
  \ God</em>) is going to be a repeatable event! Unlike typical scenarios with the\
  \ Repeatable tag, this event is repeatable once over its three Tier ranges (Tiers\
  \ 1–4, Tier 5–8, and Tier 9–12) giving players multiple opportunities to experience\
  \ this momentous adventure throughout the coming convention season. We're excited\
  \ to provide players attending numerous conventions (such as Origins and Gen Con)\
  \ a chance to run or play in this event multiple times, and for credit!</p> \n \
  \   <h2>Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) #1-00: Origins of the Open Road (For Level\
  \ 5)</h2> \n    <p>When Starfinder Society launched in 2017, we featured <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Special-100-Claim-to-Salvation\"\
  >a special prologue adventure</a> that helped set up the upcoming stories we would\
  \ tell in the first year—all while giving players a taste of higher-level play with\
  \ pregenerated characters. Two years later, we're kicking off Pathfinder Society's\
  \ second edition campaign in much the same way in <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #1-00: Origin of the Open Road</em>, with the PCs playing 5th-level pregenerated\
  \ iconic characters who uncover forgotten secrets of the Society in the arcane capital\
  \ of Quantium. Even though this is a special adventure, it's not an exclusive scenario;\
  \ run and play it at any venue.</p> \n    <p>Until later—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>\
