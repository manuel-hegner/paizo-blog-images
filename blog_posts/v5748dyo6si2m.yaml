  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Late last year, in my new\
  \ role as the creative lead for Pathfinder Society Organized Play, I sat down to\
  \ plan the plots and themes for Year 4. One of my first experiences on the Organized\
  \ Play team back in January 2021 was to sit in on the pitch meeting for Pathfinder\
  \ Society Year 3: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. It was thrilling to see what Thursty\
  \ had planned for the year, and I couldn’t wait to see how it turned out.</p> \n\
  \     <p>A few months later, I learned that “how it turned out” was going to be\
  \ my job! I knew that I wanted Year 3’s plot to lead naturally to Year 4, and that\
  \ Year 4 should continue to solidify the role of the Pathfinder Society in Golarion.\
  \ I also knew that I wanted Year 4 to “feel” different from the seasons that had\
  \ come before. So, what to do?</p> \n     <p>At some point—I can’t quite remember\
  \ when—I began to think of each “season” of Pathfinder Society as one of the four\
  \ seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. (Living in the Pacific Northwest, I\
  \ might describe our seasons as “wet,” “more wet,” “spiders,” and “wildfires,” but\
  \ I digress.) Perhaps it was the fact that I am often introspective as fall turns\
  \ to winter (when I happened to be brainstorming the Year 4 themes), or perhaps\
  \ it was the simple fact that we’ve often described a year’s worth of content as\
  \ a “season” of Organized Play. Whatever the reason, it was easy to decide which\
  \ seasons corresponded with the three current seasons of Pathfinder Society.</p>\

  \ <br> \n     <p>The Year of the Open Road was spring. It was a season of new beginnings,\
  \ new relationships, allies, and adventures. Doors (and magical mazes) opening up\
  \ to exciting places. A fresh start. A new edition! Brand new characters! </p> \n\
  \     <p>That meant Year of Corruption’s Reach was summer, a season of grand adventure,\
  \ epic tales, and exploration of the distant land of Iobaria. There were several\
  \ transitions on the Pathfinder Society development team during this time—quite\
  \ appropriate for the transition to our current plot, the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries.</p>\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <p>To me, this season represents autumn, a season of change,\
  \ reflection on the past, and preparation for the future. Appropriately, during\
  \ the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries, the Pathfinder Society’s past looms large.\
  \ We saw the campaign’s focus shift to the Inner Sea lodges of years past. In a\
  \ way, the Society has spent Year 3 hunkering down, cleaning house, reflecting on\
  \ the past, and preparing to deal with whoever has been behind all of the problems\
  \ arising at these Inner Sea lodges.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <p>So, I knew Year 4 needed to be winter. Often, winter represents\
  \ sorrowful things. Loss. Isolation. Despair. Darkness. For a long time, I considered\
  \ taking the campaign in a grim direction in Year 4. However, for many reasons,\
  \ I decided that a year of darkness and despair is not what the campaign needs at\
  \ this time. </p> \n     <p>Winter is dark, but it is also a season which many people\
  \ endure with light, hope, comradery, and gifts. And so the Year of Boundless Wonder\
  \ came to be.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6ef4bd9f-ec0c-42f7-9512-dd0b9a9f5047/PFS_ChaliceOnly_Final_NicholasPhillips.png\"\
