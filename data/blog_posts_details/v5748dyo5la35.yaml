  artist: "the confluence of magical power, these creatures are the raw stuff of arcane\
    \ energy given life and form. Powerful in their own right, when given a source\
    \ of magic upon which to feed, they become nearly unstoppable. But times change\
    \ and empires fall. In the darkness that followed Starfall, much was lost, and\
    \ as power left the world these creatures of arcane energy withered and died,\
    \ deprived of the magical power that they needed for sustenance. Only a few linger\
    \ still, tied to the rare relics of power that still remain"
