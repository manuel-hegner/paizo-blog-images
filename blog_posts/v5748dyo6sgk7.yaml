  >Pathfinder Player Companion: Heroes of Golarion</a></em>. Once you pick up this\
  \ book from your local gaming store in digital format from Paizo.com, you'll be\
  \ able to see the wonder of great heroes from around the world. If that doesn't\
  \ excite you, let me give you a tour!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  ></a>\n     <br><i>Illustration by Marcel Mercado</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Your\
  \ journey will begin in Arcadia, a land of natural beauty and great legends. Among\
  \ these are the warriors of Kazutal, the goddess known as Mother Jaguar. These slayers\
  \ have perfected techniques to capture and incapacitate their foes and such techniques\
  \ can be yours with a new set of slayer talents. Another group of locals are the\
  \ wyrwoods, living constructs that span the entire continent. Wyrwood PCs of all\
  \ manner will have new class options, feats, and racial traits to help expand their\
  \ skill set.</p> \n    <p>From Arcadia, we land in Avistan. While the continent\
  \ is well-known at this point, there are always new secrets to be discovered! Who\
  \ better to learn about secrets than the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye? The\
  \ new speaker of the Palatine Eye archetype allows bards to tap into the power of\
  \ secret rituals. Less secretive are the goblins of Avistan. The new batch of goblin\
  \ feats allow goblins to sing confounding songs or spout nonsense to stop foes in\
  \ their tracks.</p> \n    <p>If we head south, we land in Garund! The land is a\
  \ place full of unique heroes, like Holomog investigators capable of using their\
  \ engineering expertise to collapse environments on to their enemies, or the beast\
  \ speakers, heroes that draw on ancient Tekirtanin techniques to tame mighty beasts.\
  \ The beast speakers are not the only ones to draw upon the power of Garund's animals.\
  \ Many Garundi shifters use their abilities to transform into unique animal aspects\
  \ like those of the elephant or the lion.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n \

  ></a>\n     <br><i>Illustration by Nathanael James</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Casmaron\
  \ is no stranger to great heroes. Some of these include the plague eater spiritualists\
  \ of Iobaria. These spiritualists specialize in housing the souls of those lost\
  \ to the ravages of disease and travel the land to cleanse those who have yet to\
  \ succumb to plagues. Other notable figures include the hero-gods of Iblydos. These\
  \ mythical figures have shaped Iblydos and some, such as the Divine General Psomeira,\
  \ will even share some of their might with mediums that call upon them.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Next, we arrive in Tian Xia. This is a land where humans live alongside kitsune,\
  \ nagaji, tengu, and other notable groups. The varying peoples and cultures have\
  \ connections to the spirits and elements that sometimes manifest as power over\
  \ the elements. The new array of kineticist talents allow Tian Xia characters to\
  \ wield power over winds or call upon past lives to tap into elements outside the\
  \ norm. Even more intriguing are the uniquely treated dyes and inks of Tian Xia\
  \ that allow alchemists to create tangible objects and creatures with the mere swipe\
  \ of a brush.</p> \n    <p>With all these great heroes from around Golarion, it's\
  \ no surprise to find that some of them have achieved mythical status. This book\
  \ wraps up with a look at options for mythic heroes, in particular, those classes\
  \ that make use of occult power. A new set of rules and guidelines allows all occult\
  \ classes to join in the fun offered in <em><a href=\"/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG: Mythic Adventures</a></em>. In addition, the book features new\
  \ universal path abilities and path abilities for all six mythic paths, such as\
  \ the champion's overcharged blast which allows kineticists to apply additional\
  \ infusions to their blasts.</p> \n    <p>Finally, we made it home! If you want\
  \ to take the journey around Golarion for yourself, make sure to grab your passport\
  \ and pick up <em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Heroes of Golarion</em> right away!</p>\
