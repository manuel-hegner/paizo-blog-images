  \ on as Keir pushed the wooden piece the length of the board. Keir had carved it\
  \ himself, fashioning the likenesses of kings and queens and knights so he could\
  \ teach his boy the game, which represented so much in life.</span></p> \n    <p>The\
  \ boy was improving. It wouldn't be long before he beat his old man.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ thought pleased Caron. She wasn't the boy's real mother, but motherhood was about\
  \ more than just bringing a child into the world, wasn't it?</p> \n    <p>Keir moved\
  \ his queen, placing it where it could be taken by Caleb's black knight. The boy\
  \ looked up at him with a bright smile and took the piece, not suspecting for a\
  \ moment that his old man was devious enough to set him up for a fall. It would\
  \ be a lesson, even if it came at the cost of that wonderfully innocent smile.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Caron studied the board. Moving the knight away from its defensive position\
  \ allowed Keir to push his bishop into place, which in turn would force Caleb to\
  \ move his king into a position where check mate was only a couple of moves away.\
  \ It was all about looking ahead, seeing the possibilities and permutations the\
  \ game presented.</p> \n    <p>The boy stepped unwittingly into the trap.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Keir was merciful, ending the game in a couple of minutes.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Lose a fight, win the battle,\" Keir said.</p> \n    <p>Caleb nodded. He was a quick\
  \ learner and wouldn't fall into the same trap twice.</p> \n    <p>Keir rubbed one\
  \ of his huge hands through the boy's mop of hair.</p> \n    <p>Caron felt the familiar\
  \ prickle at the back of her neck. It was irrational, of course, but she envied\
  \ them their closeness.</p> \n    <p>In the morning they would move on. There were\
  \ miles left to patrol before they rested again. Then, at least she could concentrate\
  \ on what she had been trained to do, instead of watching the two play and feeling\
  \ maudlin for a life not lived.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Caleb_180.jpeg\"></a>\n     <br>Caleb's\
  \ innocence is outweighed only by his optimism.\n    </div> \n    <p>It was easy\
  \ to see why the range was known as the World's Roof. Even here, far from their\
  \ loftiest heights, the snowcapped peaks were spectacular to behold, intimidating\
  \ as they clawed up at the sky. Some of the mountains, like the Mhar Massif off\
  \ to the east, pierced the clouds and kept on climbing until their summits were\
  \ far out of sight. There was something primal, elemental, about the mountains'\
  \ presence in the world. They seemed to taunt the fleeting nature of humanity and\
  \ promise that no matter what, the land would abide.</p> \n    <p>It had been a\
  \ long journey skirting the Kodar Mountains along the borders of Varisia and Belkzen.\
  \ On the way, the travelers had seen things that could never be unseen. But at night\
  \ it had been the sounds rather than sights that would never leave Caron, especially\
  \ the gentle, low moaning of the willow-'o-wisps. She knew the dancing lights were\
  \ the last echoes of the great sacrifice the marsh had seen, and she had been unable\
  \ to differentiate those ghostlights from the lost soldiers who had given their\
  \ lives in that desperate blood ritual to deny the orc devastation so long ago.\
  \ Caleb was both old enough to understand the implications of those flickering lights\
  \ and impressionable enough to imagine there was some kind of glory to be won through\
  \ self-sacrifice. The world would batter that out of him in time, but until then\
  \ it was Keir's and her job to love, nurture, and protect the lad.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ paused, mopping the sweat from her brow, and looked up again through the thick\
  \ forest lining the lower slope. The trees thinned out as the incline steepened,\
  \ leaving roots exposed and clinging to the bedrock where the soil had slid away.\
  \ In a month, the leaves would turn to golden brown, crumple, and fall, but for\
  \ now the forest was in the last bloom of summer.</p> \n    <p>They pushed on. Gradually,\
  \ the trees thinned around them, the sounds of the forest giving way to the whistle\
  \ of the wind as it swept down through the mountains and the crunch of scree underfoot.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>There were risks that went with any patrol, especially one that had lasted\
  \ as long as this one, but there were rewards, too. One of those was contact—with\
  \ the world, with the good people and glorious creatures that brought it to life.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She turned the patrol in the direction of the huddle of buildings in\
  \ the distance.</p> \n    <p>Smoke rose from the main house.</p> \n    <p>She was\
  \ hungry, and she knew Caleb would be, too. The boy was always hungry. He'd inherited\
  \ his father's larger-than-life appetite.</p> \n    <p>\"One night won't hurt,\"\
  \ she told Keir. She knew the road weighed on him more than it did her. It had been\
  \ her choice to live like this. When his world fell apart, he had fallen in love\
  \ with her, slowly, one day at a time, but she was never going to be Neve, who would\
  \ always be his first love. During those first days and weeks on the road, it was\
  \ painfully obvious that Keir had come with Caron to escape the ghost of his departed\
  \ love. Neve was everywhere in their old village, in every stone and every window.\
  \ He'd see her in the river, her reflection bathing even if her memory could never\
  \ be washed away. So Caron had made the offer: \"Come with me. Her ghost will still\
  \ be here when you return, but maybe you'll be better able to cope with it.\" That\
  \ had been so long ago now, and more and more he'd talk to the boy about home, about\
  \ teaching him skills in the forge, and the life they had waiting for them. Going\
  \ home wasn't something she looked forward to in the same way. For them it was a\
  \ beginning; for her it was an end. An end to this life they shared where they were\
  \ the entire world to each other.</p> \n    <p>\"Then we move on,\" he agreed, thinking\
  \ she was as keen to be moving again as he was. \"We don't want to be out here when\
  \ winter arrives.\"</p> \n    <p>Sometimes ignorance was bliss.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ nodded.</p> \n    <p>As they neared, people emerged from their houses. One woman,\
  \ draped in a thick shawl, leaned in close to a muscular man who stood head and\
  \ shoulders taller than the others. Her voice didn't carry. Caron put a smile on\
  \ her face. She took in the people and the surroundings. There were obvious signs\
  \ of preparation for some sort of celebration, though she couldn't think of any\
  \ holy days they might be observing. Perhaps it was a coming-of-age ceremony?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A big burly man stepped forward, his arms spread wide. \"Welcome, welcome,\"\
  \ he said, grinning broadly. \"Come, join us. You must be hungry. Thirsty. Please,\
  \ be welcome.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thank you,\" Keir said. \"The promise of a decent\
  \ meal is music to my ears.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'll have beds made up for you. Rest.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Keir took the man's outstretched hand. \"There's no need to trouble\
  \ yourselves.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's no trouble,\" the man said. \"What's ours is\
  \ yours. Today is a good day—the Festival of the Sun. Please. We may not have much\
  \ to offer, but what we have we will gladly share with you.\"</p> \n    <p>Curious\
  \ faces watched as the newcomers walked between the rundown houses. The locals'\
  \ clothes were patched and poor, their skin etched with the shapes of the bones\
  \ beneath. It was painfully obvious these people were living on the edge on starvation,\
  \ and yet they were willing to share what little they had.</p> \n    <p>The man\
  \ showed them to a tiny house that was bare save for the essentials and reeked of\
  \ cold and damp. It was a small village. An empty house felt like a greater tragedy\
  \ than it might have in a bigger town. Who had lived here? Why was it empty now?\
  \ Caron ran her fingers across the wall, wondering what stories the stones might\
  \ tell.</p> \n    <p>They were supplied with water and soap to wash themselves,\
  \ and given time to change out of clothes smeared with the grit and grime of their\
  \ journey. \"I'll send someone to scrub them for you,\" the man said, and then closed\
  \ the door behind him.</p> \n    <p>Caleb, exhausted, was sprawled out on the simple\
  \ cot that lay in the corner of the room, his eyes closed. Caron admired his unerring\
  \ warrior's talent of being able to catch a nap whenever and wherever the chance\
  \ arose.</p> \n    <p>\"The boy's got the right idea,\" Keir said, and within minutes\
  \ was fast asleep himself.</p> \n    <p>For a few minutes, Caron tried to follow\
  \ suit, but no matter how she tried to let her mind drift, sleep would not come.\
  \ Reluctantly, she rose and went out for a walk.</p> \n    <p>\"Hello again.\" It\
  \ was the man who'd shown them into the house. \"I hope you're hungry,\" he said\
  \ with a smile.</p> \n    <p>\"You really shouldn't trouble yourselves.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"It's no trouble, really. We don't see many travelers these days, and it\
  \ would mean the world to us if you'd stay, enjoy the celebration.\" He looked down\
  \ at his feet, then up at her, obviously uncomfortable. \"You might have noticed\
  \ when you arrived... We don't have any children of our own. We won't be here much\
  \ longer. We weren't blessed. Our little community is dying.\" He raised his hand\
  \ to fend off Caron's look of sympathy. \"It's just a fact of life,\" he went on,\
  \ \"and no great tragedy to be honest. We've got a good life here. However, and\
  \ feel free to say no, it just struck me that it would be a great honor if your\
  \ boy could take part in the festivities?\"</p> \n    <p>\"How?\"</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ smiled softly. \"It has been a long time since youthful laughter filled these\
  \ hills. The feast calls for a Lord of Summer... do you think he would like to be\
  \ our Lord of Summer?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Lord of Summer. I don't think I've come across\
  \ that before.\" Her words were not quite a question but invited an answer just\
  \ the same. The question she really wanted to ask was where had all of the villagers'\
  \ own children gone—or had none ever been born? An entire barren generation seemed\
  \ unlikely, even in such a small community. Had the children died? Disease was always\
  \ a threat. They were a long way from any help. Her mind raced with the possibilities,\
  \ trying to fasten on the most obvious one that would explain the sadness she felt\
  \ from the villagers. Something had happened to the children, a sweeping sickness\
  \ had taken them, something like that. If so, that was a sorrow she could share,\
  \ and it would explain so much.</p> \n    <p>\"For generations we have celebrated\
  \ the arrival of autumn,\" the man said, \"and given thanks to the mountains for\
  \ the shelter and protection they afford us. It goes back to when I was a boy, and\
  \ when my father was. The Lord of Summer represents the best that the village has\
  \ to offer. Even though your son is not one of ours, he would still represent so\
  \ much of what we were and want to be again. All he needs to do is take his place\
  \ on the Briar Throne and smile.\"</p> \n    <p>She'd come across plenty of towns\
  \ and villages that clung onto long-held beliefs and rituals. Some were no more\
  \ than explanations of natural phenomena like the rise and falls of river levels,\
  \ the coming of the new moon, or the changing of the seasons. Giving thanks to the\
  \ mountains was no stranger than any of those. She smiled. \"I'm sure he'd love\
  \ that.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Wonderful. Wonderful. We'll need to go through the ceremony\
  \ with him, of course, practice the few lines he'll need to say, but that'll take\
  \ only a few minutes. First, we should see about getting you fed.\" He smiled and\
  \ led her back to the house.</p> \n    <p>As he closed the door behind her, she\
  \ realized she hadn't seen anything of the village.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>The sun sank lower in the sky, casting a gloom inside\
  \ the room.</p> \n    <p>People came and went, bringing with them food and questions\
  \ about the world outside. Everyone was so friendly. She went outside. She could\
  \ see Caleb dressed in a costume of leaves and vines. He waved to her, clearly delighted\
  \ to be the center of attention. So like his mother, Caron thought, and so unlike\
  \ herself. But that was blood for you: it couldn't be denied.</p> \n    <p>The man\
  \ who'd greeted them came over to meet her at the door. He smiled warmly. \"Thank\
  \ you so much for doing this. Your boy is having the time of his life.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I'm sure he is.\" Caron looked across at Caleb as he was fussed over by\
  \ half a dozen women old enough to be his grandmother. By the time they were finished\
  \ with him he'd be every inch the young, virile Lord of Summer they needed. Looking\
  \ at him there she didn't see the boy; she saw his father the day she'd lost her\
  \ heart to him. The boy was his double. She couldn't help but smile, remembering\
  \ the man who'd stolen her heart. But of course that meant remembering everything\
  \ else, too: the naming ceremony, and the fact Keir hadn't chosen her no matter\
  \ how desperately she'd wanted him to just say her name and take her hand and dance\
  \ together into the sunset.</p> \n    <p>They followed the man between the houses,\
  \ to the green in front of the main communal house. The entire village had gathered.\
  \ She could feel them holding their collective breath as a Caleb stepped forward,\
  \ dressed in the lush colors of summer. His costume was completed with a crown of\
  \ leaves that had been picked that morning and were already beginning to brown and\
  \ curl. The crown was a reminder that summer couldn't last forever, no matter what\
  \ rituals or ceremonies you performed.</p> \n    <p>The boy walked slowly, his footsteps\
  \ caught in the rhythm of a softly beating drum. She hadn't noticed the drummer.\
  \ The sound seemed to be emanating from within the huddled buildings.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>At the edge of the settlement, a path lit by fiery brands led the way up into\
  \ the mountains. With the sun lowering in the sky, the brands created a path of\
  \ light. Caleb led the procession, walking slowly up the mountainside.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>He didn't look back at them once.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>The villagers began a slow, rhythmic chant. Their voices rolled\
  \ across the mountainside. They weren't raised in joy. This was a dirge. Mournful,\
  \ melancholy, like the mountain itself was grieving.</p> \n    <p>\"This isn't right,\"\
  \ she whispered fiercely.</p> \n    <p>Keir said nothing.</p> \n    <p>They walked\
  \ side by side up the path of light, leaving the village far behind on the lower\
  \ slopes. The path wound up through scree and loose rock toward the bare face of\
  \ the mountain. She could see dark black scars in the face, deep crevices eroded\
  \ into the mountainside by centuries of harsh weather. Some of the scars rose high\
  \ above their heads, but were so narrow it would have been hard for a rat to squeeze\
  \ through.</p> \n    <p>The path of light opened out into a broad, flat expanse\
  \ high above the valley below. In the center, surrounded by more blazing torches\
  \ and a circle of scuffed footprints, was a wooden throne fashioned from intertwined\
  \ branches and living vines. This time Caleb did look back for approval before he\
  \ climbed into the chair. He took his place center stage and waited while the others\
  \ chanted. The pounding of the drum increased, in volume and tempo, counterpoint\
  \ to the melancholic song.</p> \n    <p>And then suddenly it stopped.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>There was movement within the cracks of the mountain face.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ stared at the dark fissures in the rock as slowly shadows began to detach from\
  \ the blackness. There was something wrong about the way they moved—too fluid, too\
  \ supple, hunched and scuttling almost like spiders rather than walking proudly\
  \ down the hillside like actors—that twisted her gut.</p> \n    <p>Only they weren't\
  \ shadows at all.</p> \n    <p>They looked almost human in the way they moved; their\
  \ skin was sickly, almost translucent in the faltering light of the path's torches.\
  \ She could see the bright, bloody colors of the organs beneath the surface and\
  \ the hard ridges of ivory bone. In its hand she saw a hideous double-bladed sword\
  \ that gleamed sickly in the moonlight. The shadow man saw her staring at him, and\
  \ turned to stare back at her, his wide mouth stretching ear to ear as he bared\
  \ razor-sharp teeth.</p> \n    <p>This wasn't a ceremony. It was a sacrifice.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Caleb sat proudly on his throne, the Lord of Summer's crown of leaves\
  \ firmly in place on his head, the daemon spawn closing in on him, hungry to take\
  \ the villagers' offering.</p> \n    <p>\"Caleb!\" she screamed, reaching for her\
  \ sword and trying to push and shove her way through the crowd of onlookers. But\
  \ as fast as she moved, they were faster. The shadow men spilled out of the cracks\
  \ in the mountain and rushed down the slope.</p> \n    <p>The entire mountainside\
  \ was locked in eerie silence.</p> \n    <p>She felt arms grab at her and hold her\
  \ tight, then saw the same smiling man who'd gone out of his way to make them feel\
  \ welcome pull Keir down.</p> \n    <p>They fought desperately, but it didn't matter.\
  \ There was no way they could fend off an entire village long enough to reach the\
  \ boy on his briar throne.</p> \n    <p>Caron screamed and twisted, bucking and\
  \ thrashing against the hands holding her, but it didn't matter. The sheer weight\
  \ of bodies overwhelmed her. Something slammed into the side of her face repeatedly—\
  fist or rock, it made little difference—until she stopped fighting and her entire\
  \ world grew dark.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Into the darkness in Chapter\
