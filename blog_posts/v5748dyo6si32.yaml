  \ travel is unreliable. The galaxy is in chaos, and opportunists lurk in every star\
  \ system. Starfinder needs heroes, and with the recent release of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c7l?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis\"\
  >Starfinder Drift Crisis</a>, your characters can be part of the action! But this\
  \ book wouldn’t have happened without heroes of a different kind: the authors who\
  \ joined our team to tackle a totally new kind of book, all the while with fire\
  \ in their eyes, passion in their hearts, and in their brains 101 new ways for your\
  \ PCs to rediscover that in space, nobody can hear you scream. Meet some of the\
  \ great minds who helped bring you the Drift Crisis!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\

  \    <br> \n     <h3>Dennis Muldoon</h3> \n     <p>Hi Starfinders! My name is Dennis\
  \ Muldoon. In addition to being a freelance author, I'm also an avid Starfinder\
  \ player, GM, and organized play Venture-Captain in the San Francisco Bay Area.\
  \ I was very excited to contribute to this book, writing the Blazing Speeds adventure\
  \ seed, as well as the ChiwaTech faction and volocoth devils. For more Drift Crisis-related\
  \ content from me, check out the new Starfinder Society interactive special, <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c83?Starfinder-Society-Special-499-A-Time-of-Crisis\"\
  >SFS #4-99 A Time of Crisis</a>.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Sen.H.H.S.</h3> \n \
  \    <p>Hi all, Sen.H.H.S. here! You may have seen my name around some Pathfinder\
  \ products such as Bestiary 3 and <em>Secrets of Magic</em>. I was also in Starfinder's\
  \ <em>Galactic Magic</em>, and am delighted to be back to join the chaos that is\
  \ Drift Crisis, where I wrote about the Drift before everything went sideways. You\
  \ can follow me on Twitter @SenHHS to keep track of what I'm up to, though I think\
  \ the disruption to the Drift has disrupted my tweets somewhat. So! You can look\
  \ forward to more of my work in the upcoming <em>[static]</em> and <em>[white noise]</em>\
  \ which is going to be released in <em>[more static]</em> hello is this thing on\
  \ <em>[all static and endless white noise]</em></p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Mikhail\
  \ Rekun</h3> \n     <p>Приветствую, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich\
  \ Rekun, and I wrote the Pahtran Independence section as well as the Hymothoa.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In my day job, I’m a history teacher and historian, and as part of that\
  \ I’ve spent a lot of years teaching decolonization and the end of the European\
  \ imperial system to students. So when I wrote up the Pahtran bid for independence,\
  \ the examples of decolonization were very much on my mind—especially the multi-cornered\
  \ disaster that was the Congo Crisis, but to a lesser extent also Algeria and Vietnam.\
  \ Decolonization is a big, messy, complicated subject—too big to treat seriously\
  \ in either this post or the 2-page Pahtran Independence section, but I do hope\
  \ that I’ve managed to capture at least a little of that messiness in a gameable\
  \ format.</p> \n     <p>If you enjoyed reading about the Pahtran political crisis,\
  \ I’m also the creative director of the Luminant Age project, a Weird Swashbuckler\
  \ setting currently working on fulfilling our second Kickstarter. If you like the\
  \ idea of your PC becoming a senator while fighting thousand-year-old glasswrought\
  \ engines, please follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuminantA\"\

  \     <h3>Alison Cybe</h3> \n     <p>I’m Alison Cybe, and I created the themes for\
  \ Drift Crisis! It was a blast; themes are super fun elements which can do a lot\
  \ to enhance your character. I know that when a player is starting out, they choose\
  \ their theme based on which stat benefit they gain, but they also come with extra\
  \ abilities as you level up. I like to surprise players with those; make each one\
  \ quite unique to that theme! Each time I make one, I try to combine a selection\
  \ of upgrades which are both fun and create a character unlike anything else!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Drift Crisis is a lore event. There’s a school of thinking in game development\
  \ which teaches that heavy lore is something to be avoided; that it gatekeeps casual\
  \ players from the game. I don’t believe that. Players love lore. A good, deep sense\
  \ of history to the cosmos, with a large number of groups pursuing their own goals\
  \ and agendas, it all creates the sense of a living and breathing world. Drift Crisis\
  \ contains so much for players, outside of the options; it provides a means to look\
  \ at the cosmos anew.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>James Rodehaver</h3> \n     <p>Hey\
  \ everyone, I’m Jim, James, Evil Jimjam—it all means me. I had the honor of contributing\
  \ to <em>The Drift Crisis</em> with the Trifold Legionnaire adventure seed. I was\
  \ inspired to explore a conflict where the antagonist was so focused on a goal that\
  \ they became a force of destruction. I wanted to highlight the theme that the impact\
  \ of someone’s decisions, even without malicious intent, can put them on the wrong\
  \ side of conflict. I also added Sovereign Trinity to the NPC rolodex. The story\
  \ of some power-hungry figure with a messiah complex attempting to elevate themselves\
  \ to godhood is a classic and the Drift Crisis felt like the perfect opportunity\
  \ for someone to try that with Triune.</p> \n     <p>In addition to contributing\
  \ to the <em>Drift Crisis</em> book, I am going to appear in the Drift Crisis actual\
  \ play stream on Paizo’s official twitch channel. More details are coming soon,\
  \ but I’m excited to play alongside some amazing pro streamers and one of Paizo’\
  s own is going to be in the GM seat!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>John Curtin</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Hi Paizo, I’m John Curtin! You may know me from such internettings as\
  \ Starfinder Facts on Twitter or Bearly Factual Productions on Patreon. While I’\
  m normally full of the absurd and wacky on social media, in Drift Crisis I tackled\
  \ the very serious topics of Near Space’s troubles in the Crisis, and maybe the\
  \ most solemn subject of all: loot. While you’re enjoying the Treasure Tables in\
  \ the back, be careful near the artifacts; some of them can get pretty nasty. Fun\
  \ fact: The Leng Luminary was inspired by a lantern from my wedding to my partner!\
  \ Hope you enjoy Drift Crisis as much as I plan to, and can't wait to talk more\
  \ about what I have coming up in Interstellar Species!</p> \n     <br> \n     <div\

  \ \n     <p>Hi, everyone! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I did the Cracks in the\
  \ Cosmos adventure seeds/spells, the riftstalker (which got some extremely cool\
  \ Princess-Mononoke-vibes art), Shaizera of Radiant, and everyone's favorite unethical\
  \ highly acclaimed media mogul, Zo! I think the Drift Crisis provides a good opportunity\
  \ for some cool, unusual adventures, and I had a lot of fun being a part of it (and\
  \ throwing in First World shenanigans). If you end up playing Cracks in the Cosmos\
  \ as a full campaign, I'd love to hear how it goes! You can find me (sporadically)\
  \ on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KendraLS\">@KendraLS</a>, and if you'd\
  \ like to check out other things I've written, my credits are on my website at klspeedling.com.\
  \ </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> \n     <p>Hi, I’m Jessica Catalan!\
  \ I’m the current Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance author who primarily\
  \ writes for Pathfinder and Starfinder. I contributed a lot to Starfinder Drift\
  \ Crisis, including the 'Drift in Crisis’ article, The Vast, factions (Eyeswide\
  \ Agency, Hellknights, Tetrad), class options (mystic, technomancer, vanguard),\
  \ stat blocks (gravity, vorclash, Drift Architects), and the Alluvion Fractures\
  \ adventure seed. The Drift Crisis is an exciting event to be a part of and I look\
  \ forward to seeing the adventures and content our community creates as a part of\
  \ it!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Rigby Bendele</h3> \n     <p>I contributed the\
  \ Moored faction, the Chaos on Absalom Station adventure seed, the drift saboteur,\
  \ and Aleksana Guryari's NPC write-up for this book. When writing the Moored, I\
  \ spent a lot of time looking at the way we make meaning during a crisis. I pulled\
  \ on time that I spent in activist communities when thinking about the Moored. When\
  \ big moments of crisis happened, these groups would often get overwhelmed by well-meaning\
  \ people finally motivated to join their local orgs. However, this also meant that\
  \ orgs suddenly had to go supporting 20 people to hundreds. These moments of crisis\
  \ seemed like they would be a good thing, but weathering the sudden change in resources\
  \ truly taxed them.</p> \n     <p>If you want to hear more from me, you can find\
  \ me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rigbeesknees\">@rigbeesknees</a> or\
  \ check out my work in Galactic Magic and the upcoming Pathfinder Dark Archive releases.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>John Godek III</h3> \n     <p>Hi everyone! I’m an avid\
  \ Starfinder player, 5 Nova GM, podcaster, and recent kidney transplant recipient.\
  \ I teach entrepreneurship and marking as a professor for my day job. Prior to academia,\
  \ I founded tech startups, and served on icebreakers and law enforcement cutters\
  \ in the US Coast Guard. I was a federal law enforcement officer, and one of only\
  \ 200 people in the world qualified to pilot polar class icebreakers. I visited\
  \ both the Arctic, and Antarctica, transited the Northwest Passage, and circumnavigated\
  \ North America. For Drift Crisis, my experience in federal law enforcement and\
  \ as a sailor inspired my sections on the Stewards and Free Captains factions, as\
  \ well as the starship infiltrating Azlanti Stellar Scout. My current work in academia\
  \ aided me in drafting the Stabilization Protocol adventure seed where you track\
  \ down Drift experts from across the galaxy.</p> \n     <p>I have three podcasts\
  \ on the <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/\">Know Direction Network</a>:\
  \ <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/\"\

  \ </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Andrew White</h3> \n     <p>Hello! I'm Andrew White,\
  \ Paizo's front-end engineering lead and a freelance author who has written for\
  \ a whole mess of Pathfinder and Starfinder projects going back to the Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide. Lately, I’ve also been working closely with the folks at Foundry\
  \ VTT to convert Paizo’s adventure content for virtual tabletops. My contributions\
  \ to Drift Crisis were a bunch of new class options for precogs, solarians, and\
  \ witchwarpers, my favorite of which is the ability to deliberately enrage eldritch\
  \ beings from beyond space and time in the hopes that they’ll eat your enemies before\
  \ they eat you. Have fun with that one!</p> \n     <p>If you’d like to see more\
  \ of my work, I also recently released the Danger Dossier on Starfinder Infinite,\
  \ which addresses Starfinder’s only major flaw by adding froghemoths to it; I’m\
  \ a contributing author to a bunch of exciting announced and unannounced upcoming\
  \ Paizo projects, including one of the Drift Crisis Case Files, and I can occasionally\
  \ be found retweeting stuff written by better writers at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/plaguecontrol\"\
  >@plaguecontrol</a>.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Kate Baker</h3> \n     <p>Hi, I’\
  m Kate Baker, frequent contributor to Starfinder and Pathfinder products, and I\
  \ was delighted to get to work on Drift Crisis. This book is such a fun shakeup\
  \ of the setting, and I know everyone who plays the game will find some great ideas\
  \ for implementing this storyline. I particularly enjoyed getting to write the Swarm\
  \ adventure seed. </p> \n     <p>You can follow me at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KateBakerGM\"\
