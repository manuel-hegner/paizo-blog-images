  \ Amber Die, but they successfully made it through the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\"\
  >Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> in six weekend-long sessions. Here’s the Order\
  \ of the Amber Die returns to give us a recap of their last session and share some\
  \ collected stats on their entire run of this campaign. If you haven’t been reading\

  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Entering the grand finale of an Adventure Path—especially\
  \ one played in front of the community—comes with plenty of trepidation and nostalgia.\
  \ Our opening evening of marathon six was emotional, and we spent it reminiscing\
  \ about some of our favorite moments in Strange Aeons. As our membership is spread\
  \ across the country, even if we achieved victory we'd be saying goodbye to our\
  \ characters and each other for what could be months or years; with fifteen active\
  \ members, we've had some overlap but never the same roster in any project.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To help bring this marathon experience to life, our GM tapped another\
  \ member as a live-NPC for the role of the mute musician Erich Zann, and we were\
  \ joined once again by Savannah Broadway in the role of NPC Winter Klaczka. We also\
  \ had plenty of props and music for the dark cabaret we would encounter in Paris,\
  \ and actual wine labels for the bottles of Ruby Artemesia that would feature at\
  \ a sinister gala.</p> \n     <p>For <a href=\"/products/btpy9qcm?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-114-Black-Stars-Beckon\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #114: Black Stars Beckon</em></a>, the entire marathon\
  \ session was 104 hours long with 63 hours and 15 minutes of session hours.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Highlights From Black Stars Beckon</h2> \n     <ul>\n      <li>We needed\
  \ to perform three rituals in order to sever Carcosa's connection to Golarion; these\
  \ were lengthy, left us vulnerable, and worse yet: drew the attention of Great Old\
  \ Ones. During our second ritual, a ghastly dream manifestation of Xhamen-Dor emerged\
  \ to disrupt our casters. Erasmus, despite still suffering from the possession corruption,\
  \ put his occult skills on display with <i>entrap spirit</i>—instantly ending the\
  \ fight before it began.</li> \n      <li>The strangeness of this Adventure Path\
  \ reached new levels with Carcosa's patchwork of cities stolen from different times\
  \ and planets, but by this point we had found ways to embrace it. We invited ourselves\
  \ to a vampire ball in ancient Azlant, where we threw caution to the wind and partied\
  \ like it was -9999. Later on, we popped in on a cabaret full of Leng ghouls in\
  \ 1890s Paris, where we sipped champagne and basked in the ambiance of La Belle\
  \ Époque.</li> \n      <li>To reach our goal in an ice-enshrouded elder thing city,\
  \ author Jim Groves challenged us with an old-school numbers puzzle that almost\
  \ stopped the campaign. Immersion is important to the Order, so our GM wasn't ready\
  \ to let us off the hook with an intelligence check. After two hours the group broke\
  \ for sleep, leaving Sterling (Alahazra) alone with our notes. When we woke up the\
  \ next morning, he had solved it.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     </div> \n     <h2>The Experiment</h2> \n     <p>From otherworldly horror to\
  \ the research rules, dream quests and occult rituals, this path just felt different\
  \ from standard Pathfinder—which was exactly what we loved about it. Regarding the\
  \ results of our experiment, we were all in agreement that not only can Strange\
  \ Aeons be played by complete rookies to the Elder Mythos, but that we may have\
  \ had the better deal by doing so!</p> \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n     <p>When\
  \ Adam Daigle opened his introduction to <em>Black Stars Beckon</em> by apologizing\
  \ for killing our characters, it helped us to consider PC-demise from a lighter\
  \ perspective. With our group having regular access to <i>breath of life</i>, a\
  \ <i>cauldron of resurrection</i>, and even <i>wish</i>, mortality was no longer\
  \ an issue; with a number as high as sixteen, even death died.</p> \n     <h2>Best\
  \ Quote From Marathon 6</h2> \n     <p><i>Cold silence before a gunfight in the\
  \ cabaret.</i><br> Feiya: \"Any ghoul that doesn't wanna get killed, better clear\
  \ on out the back.\"</p> \n     <h2>The Strange Aeons Adventure Path by the Numbers</h2>\

  \ \n     <h2>How it Ended</h2> \n     <p>Atop a rain-soaked tower surrounded by\
  \ a massive yellow sign, we faced off against Ariadnah the lich and the abomination\
  \ that Count Lowls had become. Things got off to the kind of start you hope you'll\
  \ never experience when playing for a championship. We lost two characters on the\
  \ opening round, with Feiya dropped by a <i>horrid wilting</i> and Winter removed\
  \ by a <i>maze</i>. The room was silent. We had to block out what was happening,\
  \ find a way to rally, and do what any team might do in this situation: a Hail Mary.\
  \ Alahazra threw it in the form of <i>disintegrate</i>, and the lich caught it in\
  \ the face with a natural one. A few rounds and seven (consecutive) successful saving\
  \ throws later, we were in a position to win. When the dust of victory finally settled,\
  \ only Erasmus and Quinn were left holding the belt of Strange Aeons.</p> \n   \
