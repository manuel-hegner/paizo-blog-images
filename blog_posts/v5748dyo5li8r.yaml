  \ Paizo's social media accounts, VC Karim &amp; VL Florent confirmed the safety\
  \ of all PaizoCon France attendees. Such is the enthusiasm and self-reliance of\
  \ our Pathfinder Society brethren, despite the government closing the site down\
  \ and the convention being officially cancelled, games still happened. Karim &amp;\
  \ helpers found two sites across town and coordinated games all day. Not only did\
  \ they play scenarios in the afternoon, they organized five tables for the interactive\
  \ special <em>7-00: The Sky Key Solution</em>. For the hardiness of the attendees\
  \ and the efforts of Karim &amp; crew, vivat!</p> \n    <p>Also this weekend, I\
  \ participated in a game of <em>7-09: The Blackros Connection</em>, via Google Hangouts.\
  \ As of a few weeks ago, Ross Tait, Venture-Lieutenant of Edmonton, Alberta, had\
  \ run the required amount of games and special events. The only requirement left\
  \ was to GM for a Venture-Captain. Unfortunately, there was none within a 4-hour\
  \ drive. So after some discussion, we decided I would act as observer. He got a\
  \ group together and we linked in players from North Bay, Edmonton, and Seattle.\
  \ I enjoyed myself and found that modern technology allows for all sorts of opportunities.\
  \ If you are geographically separate from a gaming group, I encourage you to contact\
  \ Venture Captain Jesse Davis, who coordinates the online program, and ask about\
  \ games. He has GMs that run a variety of platforms, including play by post (pbp),\
  \ virtual tabletops (VTTs), and videochat.</p> \n    <p>Traveling around the area\
  \ gives me ample opportunity to participate in PFS activities. So far, I've made\
  \ it to 4 game stores in the greater Seattle area and plan on getting to a few more\
  \ in the next two weeks. I enjoy getting out and chatting with the players, as well\
  \ as keeping up with my GM skills. I'm even getting a chance to play. Last weekend\
  \ found me playing at a table of <em>6-12: Scions of the Sky Key Part 1</em> at\
  \ Extra Life Con in Spokane, Washington. I also ran two games and played a session\
  \ of the Season of the Shackles ACG. We had a meet and greet over breakfast and\
  \ coffee, where we discussed some concerns and shared information with some of the\
  \ con attendees. They raised over $100 for charity, which was extra awesome because\
  \ it was the inaugural event. Preston Hudson, Venture Captain of Northeastern Washington/Idaho,\
  \ called the event a success and plans on making it an annual item.</p> \n    <div\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, last week saw Tanis and I teamed up with the\
  \ dynamic duo at Know Direction podcast. It was my first recorded interview and\
  \ while there were a few technical issues the interview went off without any real\
  \ problems. If you want the full scoop of what we talked about you can view the\
  \ whole podcast <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/knowdirection/v/25329901\" target=\"\
  _blank\">here</a>. I hope to come back in a few months, this time with the whole\
  \ PFS Team, to talk about Season 7. While most of the reveals are at the PaizoCon\
  \ Preview banquet, we may have a few things we can share.</p> \n    <p>This is my\
  \ 48 day recap and a look to the future. What have you been doing in the past 6\
  \ weeks? Has anyone gone to some of the conventions? What about home games? I would\
  \ love to hear in the comments below!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized\
