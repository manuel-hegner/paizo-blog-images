  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>The Seventh Execution</h1> \n   <p>by Amber\
  \ E. Scott</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: The Fettered Freed</h2> \n   <p>The moon\
  \ was a yellow bruise in the sky as I hurried through the streets of Edme. Sweat\
  \ poured off me as if I raced through a furnace. I ran without seeing, navigating\
  \ the streets by long practice. I felt I had left part of myself back at home, as\
  \ if I had lost a limb.</p> \n   <p>I stopped, panting, when the cobbled road spilled\
  \ into a flagstone-plated quadrangle. Prickly weeds, trampled flat by the mobs that\
  \ congregated there, sprouted from cracks in the stones. The gray walls of Torvin\
  \ Academy bounded the opposite size of the plaza. A few lights burned in upper windows,\
  \ but the plaza was full of moonshadows.</p> \n   <p>Razor Jenni stood in the center\
  \ of the quadrangle, atop a wooden platform braced with heavy timbers. I shuddered\
  \ when I saw the final blade, her thirsty edge held aloft atop a scaffold. A set\
  \ of stocks at the base of the scaffold snapped around the prisoner's neck. A groove\
  \ cut through the yoke allowed Razor Jenni's blade to slip through and take the\
  \ prisoner's head with her. </p> \n   <p>I spied movement at the base of the platform.\
  \ Bradach stood concealed in the shadow of the scaffold. When he saw me, he took\
  \ a step forward and beckoned. I scanned the quadrangle a final time to ensure no\
  \ one watched, then hurried to meet him. </p> \n   <p>“It's good to see you,” Bradach\
  \ said. He wore a heavy, dark cloak and stood with his hands deep in his pockets,\
  \ shoulders hunched against the chill. “Did you succeed?”</p> \n   <p>“I spoke to\
  \ my... I spoke to Mirford.”</p> \n   <p>Bradach looked alarmed. “You told him our\
  \ plan?”</p> \n   <p>“No.” I shook my head. “I asked about the executions. I wanted\
  \ to prove to you that the guilty, the traitors, are the ones who are executed.”\
  </p> \n   <p>Bradach sighed and crouched to face me. “And what did you find?”</p>\
  \ \n   <p>When you are a halfling, you get used to living in a world unsized for\
  \ you. Yet it always seemed to me that I was the proper height, and everything else\
  \ overlarge and exaggerated. In that moment, though, I felt small. “He implied that\
  \ the evidence used—” My voice broke. I cleared my throat. “The evidence might not\
  \ be as ironclad as I would prefer.”</p> \n   <p>“It's hard to admit that the things\
  \ we fought for weren't worth our dedication,” Bradach said. “It's taken me a long\
  \ time to reach the place I am now, and I took many wrong turns along the way. But\
  \ what we do here can make up for many sins of the past. You see that, don't you?”\
  </p> \n   <p>I nodded.</p> \n   <p>“Then do you have the medallion? Hand it to me\
  \ and we can set about freeing these poor souls.” He stretched a hand out. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>I have said before that halflings must remain alert to survive. We have\
  \ learned to carefully read the humans who run the cities in which we live, attuning\
  \ ourselves to their whims and desires to remain useful, and thus safe. Bradach's\
  \ words sounded well enough, but the way he thrust his hand toward me was a shade\
  \ too quick, too eager. It unnerved me for reasons I couldn't articulate.</p> \n\
  \   <p>“Tell me more,” I said. “What led you to undertake such a selfless mission?”\
  </p> \n   <p>“We are exposed here. I'd be happy to answer your questions afterward,\
  \ but we can't delay. You did get the medallion, didn't you?”</p> \n   <p>“Even\
  \ the most desperate looter would hardly stride up to the doors of Torvin Academy.\
  \ We have a few minutes.” I met Bradach's gaze. “I spent most of my life allowing\
  \ myself to work for a man whose intentions were not wholly admirable. Forgive me\
  \ if I make more certain this time. What spurred you on your mission?”</p> \n  \
  \ <p>He looked away as if weighing my question. When he spoke, his voice was low\
  \ and sad. “Someone I care about is trapped in there. Do you need to know more than\
  \ that?”</p> \n   <p>But I had seen a flash of annoyance in his eyes before he looked\
  \ away. My sense of unease deepened.</p> \n   <p>“How did she come to this?”</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He gave me a lopsided smile. “It is that obvious that she's a woman? We\
  \ worked together in Mivon. She hated injustice as much as I did, and we undertook\
  \ several missions together. Six months ago she traveled to Edme in an attempt to\
  \ free a prisoner awaiting the blade. She failed, and was executed herself.”</p>\

  \    <br> \"Razor Jenni claims both heads and souls.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>It was\
  \ a good story. Yet if Bradach had known what function I truly performed for Mirford,\
  \ he would have used a different cover. My life revolved around executions, and\
  \ I knew well enough that there was only one woman to die in Razor Jenni's arms\
  \ in the last few months. I took a step back, anger replacing the nausea in my gut.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>“You had nothing to do with her,” I said, harshly, foolishly.</p> \n \
  \  <p>Bradach straightened. “I choose to keep my motivations private. I may be guilty\
  \ of misleading you in that sense, but I wanted to make sure you understood how\
  \ important this is. It's all that matters. Now we can argue about this all night\
  \ or you can tell me whether you got the medallion.”</p> \n   <p>I took another\
  \ step back. “I couldn't get the opportunity. You'll have to give me more time.”\
  </p> \n   <p>We stared at each other. Branach looked me over from tip to toe, tapping\
  \ his chin. After a long silence, he spoke.</p> \n   <p>“I think you're lying.”\
  </p> \n   <p>“That makes two of us.” </p> \n   <p>He gave me an ugly smile. “Then\
  \ I won't waste any more words. Give me the medallion or I'll take it off your corpse.”\
  </p> \n   <p>He reached for me and I stumbled back, flailing my arm to keep him\
  \ off. My little knife leaped into my hand. </p> \n   <p>“Get away from me!”</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He put a finger to his lips as he advanced. “Voice down, slip. Do you\
  \ want to bring the whole city down on us?”</p> \n   <p>My heart thudded. The fiery\
  \ anger inside me turned in an instant to icy rage. </p> \n   <p>“Chelaxian!” I\
  \ dropped my voice to a shaking whisper. “I've sent more than one of your kind to\
  \ their deaths.”</p> \n   <p>“And now you'll help one of my kind release those souls.”\
  \ He darted forward and grabbed for me again. I ducked under his arm and skipped\
  \ out of his reach. “They'll be invaluable in my rituals. Perhaps I'll even find\
  \ a use for your corpse.”</p> \n   <p>I darted to the left. Bradach rushed forward\
  \ and caught hold of my wrist. A soundless explosion of cold shot up my arm and\
  \ numbed me all the way to my shoulder. I bit my tongue to keep from crying out.\
  \ I flailed, kicking and scratching, and threw myself back. Bradach lost his grip.\
  \ I tucked into a roll as I fell. My numbed arm threw me off. The roll broke apart\
  \ and I sprawled on my stomach. </p> \n   <p>For an instant I felt a terrible weakness\
  \ grip my limbs, but I shook off the lassitude and scrambled to my feet. I kept\
  \ as quiet as I could. If I cried out, someone was bound to hear. The guards at\
  \ the Academy would simply arrest us both, and I had just stolen from my master.\
  \ Looters would cut us down. </p> \n   <p>Bradach loomed over me. My knife lay on\
  \ the ground to my right. I dropped to my knees when Bradach swung at me. His arms\
  \ whooshed overhead. I snatched up the knife and stabbed him in the thigh. </p>\n\
  \   <p>Bradach stumbled back with a muffled cry. His heavy cloak blunted some of\
  \ the impact, but the edge of my knife came away wet with blood.</p> \n   <p>I leaped\
  \ to my feet again as Bradach took another run at me. He had his own knife out now.\
  \ I dove forward and to one side of him. His knife scored my back as I rolled past.\
  \ The cut stung, but not badly. I kicked up to my feet a dozen paces past him. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>“I get worse than that chopping carrots.”</p> \n   <p>He threw his knife\
  \ at my head. I ducked down and raised my hands for cover. Too late I realized that\
  \ Bradach's throw was careless, meant only to distract me. I tried to back up but\
  \ he had already charged. As I scrambled back, Bradach caught me in the chest with\
  \ a sharp kick.</p> \n   <p>I flew back and slammed into the cobblestones. Bradach\
  \ twisted his hands together. Blue light built between them.</p> \n   <p>I had hoped\
  \ our forced silence might keep him from casting, but no words accompanied his intricate\
  \ gestures. Light shot from his hands and streamed toward me like ethereal arrows.\
  \ I rolled away. The missiles followed my movements. I bit my fist to keep from\
  \ screaming as the bolts slammed into my side. </p> \n   <p>My body shrieked with\
  \ pain, but my heart bled with regret. To conspire with a Chelaxian, even unwittingly—\
  I could think of no greater ignominy. I had paid for my betrayal, and paid dearly.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Bradach twisted his hands together again. I bounced to my feet and sprinted\
  \ for cover. I whipped around the edge of Razor Jenni's platform and crouched behind\
  \ one of the timbers. I heard Bradach's quiet curse.</p> \n   <p>I panted, trying\
  \ to regain my breath. I blinked in surprise to see I still held my knife. Instinct\
  \ must have kept it in my hand. I could hear Bradach circle around Razor Jenni's\
  \ frame. I waited until he had almost rounded to my side, then ran the other way.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Bradach reversed direction. I'd expected that. I raced up the stairs onto\
  \ the execution platform and cut across it. Bradach heard me coming and tried to\
  \ back away. I threw myself off the platform and crashed into him, burying my knife\
  \ in his shoulder.</p> \n   <p>His howl of pain eased the ache in my heart. We fell\
  \ together. I tried to pull the blade free but Bradach rolled to the side and threw\
  \ me off. I had always supposed wizards to be weak and frail, but Bradach was no\
  \ pale scholar. His strength and size far outstripped mine.</p> \n   <p>My knife\
  \ stayed buried in Bradach's shoulder. I scrabbled for a weapon but came up with\
  \ nothing but a chunk of broken flagstone. Bradach rose to his feet, panting. I\
  \ clutched the flagstone to my chest and crawled under Razor Jenni's platform.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>She was a presence, that blade. I could feel her weight above me, pressing\
  \ down, waiting hungrily for her next victim. I shuddered and forced myself to remain\
  \ in the shadows, half-hidden behind a timber pile.</p> \n   <p>“Come out of there\
  \ you rotten little slip,” Bradach whispered. I could hear the faint rasp of his\
  \ boots as he circled the platform, trying to spot me. “Or throw me the medallion\
  \ and I'll let you go.”</p> \n   <p>Halflings survive by reading human intentions.\
  \ I knew Bradach was lying.</p> \n   <p>Bradach finally got on his hands and knees\
  \ to peer under the platform. I summoned all my strength and flung the flagstone\
  \ chunk. The rock struck Bradach above his eyes. He whimpered and collapsed.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I waited for a minute to catch my breath. My heart beat crazily and would\
  \ not calm down. I crawled out from under the platform and rolled the wizard over.\
  \ He was unconscious, but still lived. I went through his clothes and removed a\
  \ case of scrolls and a pouch half-filled with gold and silver coins. </p> \n  \
  \ <p>Then I dragged Bradach up the stairs to the platform. My side ached. Blood\
  \ dripped from the cut on my back, but not much. I used all my strength to pull\
  \ the wizard's warm, heavy body along. My sense that Razor Jenni was alive—was watching\
  \ me—grew stronger as I dragged Bradach across the platform and onto the chopping\
  \ block.</p> \n   <p>Six traitors I had sent to their final rest. Six that I was\
  \ certain of. </p> \n   <p>That night I made it seven. </p>\n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n\
  \    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>Her or me, I'd said. I had saved myself\
  \ by condemning her. In truth, though, I had condemned both of us. When she made\
  \ the march to Razor Jenni, I'd walked beside her, though I hadn't known it then.\
  \ A part of my soul stays trapped in that blade, too. I believe it always will.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Galt is no longer home to me. I am armed, though, and I have money\
  \ in my purse and new courage in my heart. I'm told the River Kingdoms hold freedom\
  \ for all, even servants. The road there is a dangerous one, but halflings have\
  \ learned to survive. I travel when the roads are empty and sleep in ditches when\
  \ I can. My sleep is untroubled. The nightmares have gone. </p>\n   <p><b>Coming\
