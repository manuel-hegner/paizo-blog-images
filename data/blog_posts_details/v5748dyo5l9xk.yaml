  artist: "the gods. They are punishments meted out by the drow themselves. One noble\
    \ family of drow, House Parastric, has maintained their power due to their possession\
    \ of a powerful secret—the art of fleshcrafting. On one level, this art lets a\
    \ drow use various poisons to reshape parts of the body, granting a soldier large\
    \ claws or a poisonous bite, for example, or a scout antennae so he can navigate\
    \ even more easily in the dark. Yet this is just the beginning, for the drow of\
    \ House Parastric also developed a method to reshape an entire creature—this is\
    \ known as fleshwarping, and those that survive the painful and humiliating process\
    \ are known as fleshwarps. Every race put through the process emerges as something\
    \ different—all troglodytes come out as hulking behemoths; all surface elves emerge\
    \ as twisted deformed monsters; all halfings come out as skittering quadrapedal\
    \ beasts, and so on. But it was the drow themselves who proved the most impressive\
    \ subjects for fleshwarping, for all drow that undergo the process emerge as driders.\
    \ In drow society, driders are seen as freaks and mutants. Becoming a drider is\
    \ not prestigious—it's physical proof of punishment and a brand of shame. Yet\
    \ driders are not frail or helpless fleshwarps; they're powerful creatures in\
    \ their own regard. As a result, in drow society driders are often kept as guardians,\
    \ soldiers, or bodyguards. Retaining little of their previous life's memories,\
    \ most driders serve their drow lords and ladies without question. But not all\
    \ of them. Female driders in particular are more headstrong and aggressive, just\
    \ as with the drow themselves. Most drider rebellions are instigated by a female,\
    \ and today there are numerous small tribes of driders dwelling in the remote\
    \ corners of the Darklands, free"
