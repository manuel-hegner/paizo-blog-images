  \ take a look outside. For those in the northern hemisphere—well, I can at least\
  \ speak for the Seattle area—flowers are blooming, the sun is out (mostly), and\
  \ the afternoons have been delightfully warm. Yes, it's clear that the seasons are\
  \ changing. Spring? Summer? No, I'm referring to Pathfinder Society Organized Play!</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Year of the Demon is on the home stretch, and there are another six\
  \ scenarios in the works to conclude the Pathfinder Society's expedition into the\
  \ Worldwound to explore the dwarven Sky Citadel Jormurdun. The path to the dwarven\
  \ ruins is fraught with danger, though, starting when <a href=\"/products/btpy95ea\"\
  >misfortune strikes the Society's basecamp</a>. With the PCs' help, I'm sure the\
  \ Society will be able to embark with their motley crew of allies accumulated over\
  \ the past year. That small army is going to come in handy in <i>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #5–24: Assault on the Wound</i>, especially when the Pathfinders come\
  \ face-to-face with a pair of villains who have long vexed the organization during\
  \ <i>Scenario #5–25: Vengeance at Sundered Crag</i>.</p> \n    <p>All of that effort\
  \ will pay off at Gen Con 2014 with the debut of <i>Pathfinder Society Special:\
  \ Legacy of the Stonelords</i>, an exciting delve into Jormurdun with some delightful\
  \ twists written by Mike Shel.</p> \n    <p>Elsewhere in the world, Aaqir al'Hakam\
  \ has returned home to <a href=\"/products/btpy95eb/\">mourn the death of his mentor</a>,\
  \ but darker plots are afoot in Qadira. Meanwhile, agents in Mendev must save their\
  \ fellows from the fires of misguided inquisition in <i>Scenario #5–22: Scars of\
  \ the Third Crusade</i>, and back in Absalom, the Blakros family approaches the\
  \ Society with word of a powerful artifact sought after by their mutual enemy. The\
  \ problem is that the artifact is secreted away in shadowy Nidal, which the PCs\
  \ visit in <i>Scenario #5–23: Cairn of Shadows</i>.</p> \n    <p>Finally, as an\
  \ added bonus, we're including an extra Pathfinder Society Special this year: <i>The\
  \ Paths We Choose</i>. Written by Tim Hitchcock, a veteran author of Gen Con Specials,\
  \ <i>The Paths We Choose</i> explores each faction's choices over the previous season\
  \ including ways in which the faction's goals, means, and motives are evolving based\
  \ on player choices.</p> \n    <p>Expect product pages of these and the first three\
  \ scenarios of Season 6 soon.</p> \n    <p>Happy gaming</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br>\
