  \ \n     <h3>Lisette</h3> \n     <p>Most of Delgar's buildings were fashioned from\
  \ rough-hewn timber, lacking exterior plaster or even a second story. Unless you\
  \ enjoyed the smell of fish scales and muddy water, there was little to recommend\
  \ the place, although Lisette appreciated the community's nod toward organization.\
  \ A lot of river communities couldn't be bothered to fashion straight roads—or straight\
  \ houses, for that matter. Delgar at least had been built on a grid plan, and as\
  \ she and Karag climbed out of the barge that afternoon, she was able to take quick\
  \ stock of the little town. </p> \n     <p>For the last week of her journey she'd\
  \ heard rumors about a hunting expedition jointly sponsored by several of the famously\
  \ uncooperative River Kingdoms. Delgar was to be its launching point, which was\
  \ probably what had drawn her bounty so far north. Apparently, experienced hunters\
  \ were to be paid good coin, and the old rogue probably hoped he could pass off\
  \ as one.</p> \n     <p>She and Karag blended in fairly well with the crowds thronging\
  \ the little village, for no one could guess by looking at their gear that they\
  \ earned their coin hunting men, not beasts.</p> \n     <p>She scanned the faces\
  \ they passed, taking the place in, ignoring the return appraisals from knots of\
  \ varied martial types who wound their way through the muddy streets.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Dark of eye and dark of hair, which she'd cut to the nape of her neck, Lisette\
  \ had the pale complexion of a Chelaxian. Her pants were dark, loose, comfortable,\
  \ and tucked into well-worn, calf-high boots sewn from lizard hide. A pair of pistol\
  \ butts stood out from the sash tied at her waist, weapons of fine iron and dark,\
  \ highly polished wood. Her single mark of flamboyance was the slim red feather\
  \ thrust into the side of her brimmed cloth hat.</p> \n     <p>As Karag finished\
  \ unloading their gear, he handed a matching flintlock rifle up to her. She shouldered\
  \ the weapon without remark, the brown strap sliding across the long black sleeve\
  \ of her shirt and the rim of her black vest.</p> \n     <p>The burly dwarf hefted\
  \ a second rifle on his own shoulder, the long muzzle poking three feet above his\
  \ blond locks. He then lifted a huge leather bag as thick around as himself and\
  \ propped it on the other shoulder.</p> \n     <p>\"Let's get this over with,\"\
  \ she said, and they started forward.</p> \n     <p>The two made an odd pair. Karag\
  \ was Lisette's physical opposite in nearly every way, for he was blond and pale\
  \ and sturdy. Where she strode with pantherish grace, he swaggered. If passersby\
  \ even recognized the rifle he carried for what it was, they would probably have\
  \ assumed it was his, but it belonged to Lisette just as much as the powder bag\
  \ slung across Karag's back, the rifle over her own shoulder, or the brace of flintlock\
  \ pistols thrust through her belt.</p> \n     <p>\"You ever hear what they're really\
  \ supposed to be hunting?\" Lisette asked him. She ignored the appreciative whistle\
  \ of a leather-clad barbarian leaning against the side of a building.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"It's some monster the elves drove out of Kyonin,\" Karag answered in his\
  \ low rumble. \"If the long-ears can't be bothered, they'll just chase a beast out\
  \ and let everyone else...\"</p> \n     <p>Karag's voice trailed off, and Lisette's\
  \ gaze swung to follow his own.</p> \n     <p>A thickset man with a full beard had\
  \ just stepped from the sprawling, two-story building ahead of them and stood now\
  \ under a hanging placard carved with a leaping fish. The hood of his light traveling\
  \ cloak was cast back to reveal a balding pate peppered with red hair. Beside him\
  \ were two younger men of similar build, their receding hair heavy with grease.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lisette cursed in disbelief. It was never, ever this easy. She'd tracked\
  \ the man for the better part of two months, always staying just behind him. And\
  \ now he was there before her within a few moments of reaching Delgar.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Velmik,\" Karag whispered.</p> \n     <p>Even as her hand swept toward\
  \ her right pistol, Velmik spotted her. With a deep-throated shout he dove back\
  \ through the doorway. His sons hurried after.</p> \n     <p>Lisette wasted no breath\
  \ cursing. \"Back entrance,\" she ordered Karag, then leapt to the wooden porch\
  \ to push into the throng of men Velmik and his sons had stumbled through.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The fugitives left a wake through the middle of the tavern's crowded common\
  \ room, a wide space crammed with long wooden tables and broad-shouldered men and\
  \ women, many of whom were now cursing, their heads turned toward Velmik. The murderer\
  \ ploughed toward a closed door beside the stairs to the private rooms. One of his\
  \ boys was ahead of him; the other was looking back at Lisette. His hand went to\
  \ his belt, and fastened not around the sword hilt, but an axe haft. Lisette knew\
  \ then that she faced Gern, who had a reputation with his throwing axe. That meant\
  \ the one starting up the stairs ahead of Velmik had to be the eldest, Hadek, against\
  \ whom there was a minor bounty. Not half the size of the one on Velmik, and it\
  \ wouldn't have brought her out to the wilds, but with him so close by she wouldn't\
  \ dream of passing up the opportunity.</p> \n     <p>Gern charged up the creaking\
  \ steps after the others. \"Hurry, Dad!\"</p> \n     <p>A man and woman at the top\
  \ of the stairs froze at sight of Hadek and backed off.</p> \n     <p>Lisette elbowed\
  \ a gawking servant girl out of the way and pulled her pistol free, cocking the\
  \ hammer with her off hand. As she brought the muzzle in line with Velmik's broad,\
  \ retreating back, Gern sent the axe flying at her head.</p> \n     <p>She sidestepped,\
  \ firing as she felt the passage of the haft brush her hat brim. She missed by only\
  \ a little, hitting Hadek instead. The man dropped with a girlish scream and his\
  \ father whirled. Behind Lisette, the axe smashed into a row of glasses at the bar,\
  \ and there was an uproar from the bartender and any number of patrons. She thrust\
  \ the smoking pistol through her belt and drew its twin even as Gern pulled a second\
  \ axe.</p> \n     <p>Velmik crouched by his firstborn, who whimpered on the stairs.\
  \ The older man bared teeth as he faced her, drawing steel.</p> \n     <p>She notched\
  \ back the hammer of her second pistol and snapped off a shot. She grinned through\
  \ the swirl of black gun smoke—she'd known even as the weapon kicked in her hand\
  \ that it had been true. Gern staggered and jerked as a leaking red hole materialized\
  \ in the center of his forehead. He sprawled.</p> \n     <p>The thunderous pistol\
  \ shot set women screaming and men shouting in terror. Many dove for cover or rushed\
  \ the door. Lisette calmly shoved the smoking pistol back through her sash and drew\
  \ her short sword.</p> \n     <p>Velmik charged down the stairs, eyes mad and rolling,\
  \ lips peeled back to show stained and crooked teeth. He brandished his long notched\
  \ sword like a cleaver.</p> \n     <p>\"You killed my boys, you bitch!\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Lisette snatched a tankard from the abandoned bar and hurled it at Velmik's\
  \ head. Her aim was not as accurate with her off hand, but the bald man swerved.\
  \ The tankard banked off the stair rail, spraying sour-smelling ale. The instant's\
  \ distraction was all Lisette desired. She lunged forward, slicing rather than thrusting,\
  \ and cut Velmik across his neck and upper chest. The old fool was wearing leather\
  \ armor but no neck guard.</p> \n     <p>It was not a deep strike, but it was enough\
  \ to spoil Velmik's own and set him clawing instinctively for his throat. He looked\
  \ down, wide-eyed, as she drove the sword through his hand and out the back of his\
  \ neck.</p> \n     <p>Blood spurted forth, and Velmik gurgled a bit as he wobbled,\
  \ then sank, finally flopping onto the floorboards like a fish. His sword struck\
  \ the stained planks a second later with a dull clang.</p> \n     <p>There came\
  \ a brief silence, over which she heard the labored breathing of Hadek, collapsed\
  \ with glassy eyes upon the stairs.</p> \n     <p>She wiped her blade on the back\
  \ of Velmik's shirt.</p> \n     <p>Karag burst in through the back doorway, panting,\
  \ and suddenly found every pair of eyes in the whole tavern staring at him and the\
  \ musket he carried in two hands.</p> \n     <p>The silence lasted only a moment\
  \ longer, and then the buck-toothed bartender demanded to know who she was, how\
  \ she dared, and, most loudly, who would pay for the damages.</p> \n     <p>\"I\
  \ am a bounty hunter,\" Lisette told him calmly, \"and two of these men are wanted\
  \ in Andoran, Druma, and Isger. Karag will pay the damages.\" At this the dwarf\
  \ stepped to her side, a little red-faced.</p> \n     <p>\"They never came out,\"\
  \ he explained swiftly, softly, \"and I heard gunshots.\"</p> \n     <p>She had\
  \ surmised that. \"There was no real trouble,\" she told him so his dwarven pride\
  \ would remain uninjured. \"Bag these two up, and pay this gentleman for his trouble.\
  \ Your pardon, sir,\" she said to the proprietor with her prettiest smile. \"I'm\
  \ afraid I must leave your fine company.\"</p> \n     <p>The bartender and the others\
  \ gawped. She didn't mind the attention at all; it might make her stay in the place\
  \ a little simpler.</p> \n     <p>The crowd broke into low murmurs, talking among\
  \ themselves and staring darkly. A few were even moving back toward their tables,\
  \ though they were cautious about it. The bartender was actually scowling.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"This is Delgar,\" he said with a drawl. \"You can't just wander into\
  \ the town and kill people in my bar! We have laws!\"</p> \n     <p>Karag stepped\
  \ up to the counter, his head just clearing its edge. \"Lisette has full authority—\
  \"</p> \n     <p>\"This is my inn!\" The barkeep's face reddened. Lisette heard\
  \ angry murmurs from the crowd behind her. Curious. She hadn't anticipated this\
  \ at all. Quietly, methodically, she took up one of her pistols and cleaned the\
  \ inside of the muzzle with a rag she pulled from a vest pocket.</p> \n     <p>From\
  \ behind came a loud clump of steps, and a lull in the mutters as a deep, male voice\
  \ demanded silence.</p> \n     <p>Lisette paused in the loading of her pistol and\
  \ turned.</p> \n     <p>A peculiar figure strode through the doorway. At first glance\
  \ he was just another broad, powerful man-at-arms. And then she saw so many incongruities\
  \ that she was not sure which to consider first.</p> \n     <p>It was not so remarkable\
  \ that she faced a thickly built member of the city guard bearing a sheathed sword.\
  \ What <i>was </i>remarkable was that he was a half- or at least quarter-blood orc.\
  \ Even out here in the uncivilized wilds, most folk didn't trust their kind, and\
  \ there was no missing the greenish hue or the foreword thrust of the thick jaw\
  \ and upward-pointing teeth. Yet here was no coarse brute, either, for his garb\
  \ was immaculate, from polished helm to the glimpse of leather armor she perceived\
  \ beneath the spotless blue tabard with its black, crenelated tower. Her eyes shifted\
  \ briefly to the tall figure striding in behind him, likewise immaculate, likewise\
  \ wearing leather armor and a white-and-blue tabard with a stone tower, but his\
  \ long mustaches and slanted eyes were merely peculiar as opposed to extraordinary.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What has happened here?\" the half-orc growled.</p> \n     <p>\"Captain,\"\
  \ the barkeep began, and once again Lisette started. <i>Captain</i>? The barkeep\
  \ pointed at her. \"This woman just killed those three men on the stairs with some\
  \ kind of magic.\"</p> \n     <p>The bright, rather small eyes in the half-orc's\
  \ face shifted immediately to her, then to the gun.</p> \n     <p>\"You need to\
  \ set that down,\" the captain growled.</p> \n     <p>Karag stomped over from the\
  \ bar to stand at Lisette's side. He glowered up at the orc, who seemed careless\
  \ of the dark look, for he gave the dwarf little attention before focusing again\
  \ upon the gun.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Lisette.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>\"Who are you?\" Karag growled.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ tall, mustached guardsman had stepped to the half-orc's side, and it was he who\
  \ answered in a mellow voice with the faint trace of a Brevic accent. \"You are\
  \ addressing Drelm, captain of the Delgar guard. And he has given your...associate\
  \ a command. Put aside the strange wand. Immediately.\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette's\
  \ smile did nothing to change Drelm's expression; it remained grim even as she passed\
  \ the still unloaded pistol on to Karag. \"I am a bounty hunter,\" she said, \"\
  fully licensed in five separate countries, and at least as many municipalities,\
  \ including Tymon. Two of those men were known bandits and murderers; the other\
  \ was a relative. I was not after him, but he attacked.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Proof?\"\
  \ Drelm asked.</p> \n     <p>Lisette was used to thinking on her feet, but it took\
  \ a moment longer to decipher the captain's short command.</p> \n     <p>\"I have\
  \ posters for them here,\" she said, \"in my vest pocket.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Pull\
  \ them slowly,\" Drelm told her.</p> \n     <p>\"Of course.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ captain's eyes never left her hand as she produced two quarter-folded pieces of\
  \ parchment. They crinkled as she passed them across to one large, greenish hand.\
  \ The knuckle on his first finger was scarred with a long, slightly paler line.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She watched as his eyes tracked across the likenesses of Velmik and\
  \ Gern—not perfect, but fair enough—and then the words beneath. And she kept the\
  \ smile upon her lips, knowing that he would demand some sort of fine, or impose\
  \ some other penalty to enrich himself. She knew better than to object. Here was\
  \ a \"man\" clearly used to getting his own way by physical intimidation. The curious\
  \ thing was how the barkeep and two barmaids were both focused upon the \"captain\"\
  \ expectantly. She would have thought they would view any interaction with him with\
  \ fawning politeness, as you had to do in larger cities when the gangs shook you\
  \ for protection money.</p> \n     <p>Drelm finished what must have been a somewhat\
  \ labored examination of the words, for he was long about it, and handed the papers\
  \ off to the Brevan. \"Compare them.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, Captain.\" The Brevan\
  \ stepped around Karag, walking with a horseman's swagger. His boot heels, she noticed,\
  \ were silver.</p> \n     <p>\"They did a lot of damage.\" The barkeep pointed to\
  \ a row of smashed glasses sitting on a dark shelf behind him. Lisette glanced over\
  \ the bar top and saw a trio of broken bottles lying on the dark floorboards amid\
  \ a spreading pool of sweet-smelling wine.</p> \n     <p>\"We will gladly pay for\
  \ the damages,\" Lisette told them. \"Although all of this was because Velmik's\
  \ son threw an axe.\"</p> \n     <p>That didn't hold any sway with the barkeep.\
  \ \"He wouldn't have thrown an axe if you hadn't followed him into my inn!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Brevan had climbed the first two stairs and was glancing back and\
  \ forth between the two pieces of paper and the bodies. \"Captain,\" he called,\
  \ \"two of these look just about right. And the third must be a son of the older\
  \ one.\"</p> \n     <p>Drelm's small eyes flicked to the barkeep's. \"What will\
  \ repairs cost?\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette could see conflicting emotions warring on\
  \ the barkeep's face. He looked down at the damage, then back to the orc.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Five gold sails.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Three at best,\" the Brevan said as\
  \ he wandered over. \"I can smell that wine from here. Not exactly high elven vintage.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>The Brevan was right, but Lisette knew better than to offer any opinion.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Three,\" Drelm said to Lisette. \"Pay him. Demid, collect the coins.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Yes, Captain.\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette couldn't believe she was\
  \ getting off that lucky. Drelm glanced once more at the dwarf, who still watched\
  \ with suspicion, and faced the rest of the tavern's occupants.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Many of you are new faces,\" Drelm said as he drew himself up. \"This is not how\
  \ we do things here.\" He tapped his chest. \"Those who kill, face me. Those who\
  \ steal, face me. Those who hurt an innocent, face me. I give this one\"—he pointed\
  \ to Lisette—\"this one chance. She is new. She is a bounty hunter. She has taken\
  \ her chance, and yours. Next time, you face me. Am I understood?\"</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ snapped this last. A few of the folk—locals, probably—were direct with their reply:\
  \ \"Yes, Captain!\"</p> \n     <p>The others looked away and mumbled.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Drelm's lips pulled back in a snarl, and he roared. \"Do you understand me?\
  \ You will answer, ‘Yes, Captain!'\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, Captain!\" the customers\
  \ called back.</p> \n     <p>\"Again!\"</p> \n     <p>This time the tavern timbers\
  \ seemed to shake a little with the noise. \"Yes, Captain!\"</p> \n     <p>Drelm\
  \ grunted, then glanced back at Lisette. \"No more bounties before speaking with\
  \ me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Of course.\" Lisette tried a smile, and produced a gleaming\
  \ cold coin. She lobbed it twirling into the air between the half-orc and herself.\
  \ \"For your trouble.\"</p> \n     <p>Drelm caught it without looking in one massive\
  \ fist, then addressed the Brevan while staring at her. \"Lieutenant Demid, she\
  \ is new. Speak to her.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Only the mayor pays the city guard, little\
  \ sparrow,\" the Brevan said from behind her.</p> \n     <p>Drelm then pitched the\
  \ coin, without once considering it, toward the barkeep. \"I levy fines for bribery,\"\
  \ he said. \"There, keep it. Now you profit from the mess.\"</p> \n     <p>Stranger\
  \ and stranger. Lisette couldn't quite figure the captain's angle. Only some wet-behind-the-ears\
  \ Eagle Knight would be so honest. Certainly no half-orc in a village no one had\
  \ heard of.</p> \n     <p>\"Do you have more targets in Delgar?\" he asked her.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Probably not,\" Lisette answered. There was always the possibility\
  \ she'd bump into someone else.</p> \n     <p>\"‘Probably not.'\" Drelm grunted,\
  \ a low, almost thoughtful sound. \"If it becomes ‘probably yes,' see me before\
  \ you spill more blood, or you and I will have a problem.\"</p> \n     <p>At last\
  \ he acknowledged the dwarf, who muttered under his breath. Something dwarven, from\
  \ the sound, and an insult, from his dark look.</p> \n     <p>\"I don't speak dwarf,\"\
  \ the half-orc said, then his eyes tracked back to Lisette's. \"Tell him threats\
  \ to me when I'm in uniform are threats to the guard.\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette's\
  \ hand tightened on Karag's shoulder. He tensed under her fingers. She did not leave\
  \ off smiling. \"I'll make sure he knows.\"</p> \n     <p>Drelm grunted.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The Brevan strode past then, coin purses in hand. \"They had thirty-two\
  \ silvers, Captain, and a handful of coppers.\"</p> \n     <p>\"For the treasury,\"\
  \ Drelm said.</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, Captain.\"</p> \n     <p>Her first thought was\
  \ that the half-orc was an idiot and meant to have the lieutenant turn the money\
  \ over to the city coffers. Then she realized they were saying that solely for the\
  \ benefit of listeners and would surely cut themselves in for a nice percentage\
  \ of the money, for Demid had certainly announced fewer funds than he'd actually\
  \ found on the bodies.</p> \n     <p>Drelm surveyed the room a final time, then\
  \ turned heel and strode away.</p> \n     <p>\"Karag,\" Lisette forced almost sickly\
  \ sweet kindness into her voice. \"Make the rest of the arrangements. And keep the\
  \ captain's warning in mind. I do think,\" she added, \"we'll be better welcome\
  \ at some other inn for the night.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I suppose you're right,\" Karag\
  \ said, and turned to consider the bodies, and the barkeep, who still watched them.\
  \ Everyone, actually, was still staring at them, although some had returned to their\
  \ meals.</p> \n     <p>\"My pistol?\" Lisette asked. It was evidence of how peculiar\
  \ the encounter had been that Karag had not instantly returned it to her. He did\
  \ so now with an apologetic look, then strode toward the bar. In this place she\
  \ didn't imagine he'd be able to drag the bodies to an alley and cut off their heads.\
  \ One way or another, though, the dwarf would have to decapitate the corpses and\
  \ drop the heads in salt. It didn't matter to her how he did it, so long as they\
  \ stayed on the right side of the law—and, more importantly, so long as the evidence\
  \ of the kill was preserved long enough to collect the bounty.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ walked out past Demid and stepped to the edge of the raised platform, leaning\
  \ against the warm building shingles while she checked over the pistol bore and\
  \ fished around for her pellet and powder. She was not at all surprised to find\
  \ the Brevan guard following her out, black eyes afire with interest.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"You have strange talons,\" he said, \"but are a deadly bird. The dwarf didn't\
  \ slay any of them, did he?\"</p> \n     <p>\"No.\"</p> \n     <p>She pulled out\
  \ a powder packet and bit off the end with her teeth, then spat it to the side.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Demid's lips turned up in a slight smile.</p> \n     <p>\"Is there something\
  \ funny, Lieutenant?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Demid,\" he said. \"I assure you that I take\
  \ you quite seriously.\"</p> \n     <p>She wasn't sure what to make of that, but\
  \ decided not to press further. \"So what are a Brevan and a half-orc doing on the\
  \ guard force in a nowhere village in the River Kingdoms? It almost sounds like\
  \ a joke.\"</p> \n     <p>He repeated the word doubtfully. \"A joke?\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Sure.\" She pulled free a bullet from another pocket and held it up to\
  \ the sun. \"A Brevan and a half-orc walk into a bar. But I don't know the punch\
  \ line.\"</p> \n     <p>\"The punch line. Oh, yes. No, it's no joke, Lady...\" He\
  \ waited expectantly.</p> \n     <p>\"Lisette.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Lisette. How lovely.\
  \ I might begin such a joke myself. An angry dwarf and a beautiful marksman—markswoman—\
  enter a bar. But I also don't know the...\" He paused to make a rolling motion with\
  \ his hand, then finished: \"punch line.\"</p> \n     <p>\"There isn't one.\" Lisette\
  \ put home the bullet, and, satisfied, tamped it down. \"What is it you want, Lieutenant?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I am curious about you. Part of my duties as a guardsman of Delgar,\
  \ you understand.\"</p> \n     <p>Was he flirting, or was he actually searching\
  \ for information? The more time she spent in this place, the more unsure she became.\
  \ She could read men, though, and even though Demid clearly found her attractive,\
  \ there was a coolness in his gaze. \"Of course.\"</p> \n     <p>\"For instance,\
  \ I've never seen wands with handle grips before.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You mean these?\"\
  \ As she tapped the muzzle of her pistol, he nodded. \"These aren't wands, they're\
  \ guns. No magic's involved.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ah,\" he said. \"I've never seen\
  \ one before.\"</p> \n     <p>\"But you've heard of them?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Alchemical,\
  \ aren't they?\"</p> \n     <p>Clearly he wished to hold one, but she wasn't feeling\
  \ charitable. \"Something like that.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I see. And where is it that\
  \ you're going?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I wish only to find lodging for the night. Somewhere\
  \ where I might obtain a warm bath.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ah.\" Demid clicked his tongue.\
  \ \"That's more challenging than usual, owing to the hunt. Are you planning to participate?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I'm only here for Velmik. I just want a warm bath, a night in a\
  \ real bed, and then I'll be on the next boat out.\"</p> \n     <p>Demid listened\
  \ with interest, then provided directions to a home near the walled city center.\
  \ \"Madame Celene has expensive rooms, and is careful to whom she rents them. Most\
  \ of these would not be welcome there. Your friend,\" he continued, \"would have\
  \ to be...\"</p> \n     <p>\"Gentlemanly?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Polite,\" Demid said\
  \ with a nod.</p> \n     <p>\"He can manage that. I thank you, Demid.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Of course.\" He executed a smart half bow, turned on his heel, and retreated\
  \ to the inn.</p> \n     <p>Interesting. He had not been looking for a bribe, or\
  \ romance, but inspecting her, almost as though he were a guardsman in Almas. A\
  \ real professional. Well, the River Kingdoms attracted fugitives. Likely the Brevan\
  \ had some sort of complicated backstory, and probably one less interesting than\
  \ she supposed. Curious as she was, she decided she was thankful neither Demid nor\
  \ Drelm were the types who liked to brag about their past.</p> \n     <p>Lisette\
  \ slipped her gun back through her belt, readied her second, then tucked her supplies\
  \ away. She checked her appearance in a small glass mirror, finding a few blood\
  \ flecks, which she wiped from her cheeks.</p> \n     <p>Demid's directions and\
  \ information proved accurate. Madame Celene, a beanpole-thin woman with a personality\
  \ dry as day-old bread, could have done with some of the Brevan's politeness. Elyana\
  \ rented a room for a silver wolf—a criminal rate out here in the middle of nowhere—\
  but it came with a warm bath, and privacy, and Celene told her the latter was not\
  \ likely anywhere else in the village this week.</p> \n     <p>The outrageous fee\
  \ soured Lisette's mood even after a long hot soak in a sparkling clean iron tub\
  \ off Madame Celene's kitchen. She was upstairs in the tiny bedroom allotted her,\
  \ methodically checking over her gear, when a loud rap rang against her door.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lisette reached immediately for one pistol, which she put close to hand.\
  \ She was partially dressed, in shirt and pants, although she was uncorseted and\
  \ barefoot, and her wet hair hung wild about her shoulders.</p> \n     <p>\"Who\
  \ is it?\"</p> \n     <p>She expected an answer from Karag. Still, you could never\
  \ be too cautious in her line of work. She glanced over her shoulder at the narrow,\
  \ shuttered window overlooking the street. The afternoon sun cast lines of light\
  \ through which dust motes drifted, highlighting the polish on the old floor planks.\
  \ Madame Celene kept a tidy inn.</p> \n     <p>\"I have a message for you, miss.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>The voice was that of a young man's. Lisette lifted the pistol and\
  \ pulled back the hammer with a faint click. \"From whom?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Someone\
  \ from the court, miss.\"</p> \n     <p>That struck her as more than a little curious.\
  \ \"You don't know?\"</p> \n     <p>Apparently the message boy thought so too. \"\
  I'm sorry, I don't,\" he admitted. \"I was just supposed to find the lady who'd...\"\
  \ There was a brief pause. \"Killed those men at the tavern. You're her, aren't\
  \ you?\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette was still wondering how to answer that when the boy\
  \ spoke on.</p> \n     <p>\"I'll just slide this message under the door. No need\
  \ to pay me. My fee's already handled.\"</p> \n     <p>The floorboards creaked outside\
  \ then, probably from the boy shifting weight, and a small envelope slid slowly\
  \ under the door.</p> \n     <p>Lisette stared at it from a distance.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"I'll be going now,\" the young man's voice said, nervously, and then his\
  \ footsteps receded hurriedly.</p> \n     <p>Lisette slowly lowered the hammer,\
  \ put the gun aside, and stepped to the envelope, though long years in the field\
  \ made her cautious even with this simple act. The letter might be poisoned or trapped,\
  \ or the letter might be a distraction while something else was underway.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In the end, though, it proved just a letter, sealed with wax that lacked\
  \ the mark of any kind of seal. The message within promised twenty gold sails for\
  \ a brief discussion with the lord mayor, so long as she understood she that was\
  \ to be completely discrete about the summons, both before and after the meeting.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>An unexpected development, and a profitable one. Probably the man was\
  \ looking to drop a criminal the local guard force hadn't been able to kill. Someone\
  \ too clever for, say, a half-orc. The discretion was peculiar, but compared to\
  \ some of the requests she'd heard over the years, it didn't amount to much. Likely\
  \ Lord Avelis didn't want anyone knowing his guard force couldn't handle the matter.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lisette readied herself in short order, pleased that she'd kept one\
  \ blouse clean just for these sorts of emergencies.</p> \n     <p>One street over,\
  \ the wooden buildings gave way to a handful of stone homes immediately outside\
  \ the walled enclosure that surrounded the seat of government. The ten-foot wall\
  \ wouldn't hold off an army for long, but it would keep back the kind of bandit\
  \ forces that usually assaulted River Kingdoms settlements.</p> \n     <p>She passed\
  \ through the open gates and tried not to stare too long at the two spear-bearing\
  \ guardsmen. It was odd enough that they should look so competent, odder still that\
  \ their helms matched, and that their hair and faces were well-groomed, but beyond\
  \ that, they were actually wearing clean tabards. One simply didn't encounter that\
  \ level of organization in River Kingdoms villages, which tended to rise and fall\
  \ every generation. So far as she knew, Delgar was only a few years old. It had\
  \ no business being so well run.</p> \n     <p>She understood now that the symbol\
  \ she'd seen on all the guards' tabards—a small tower with an arrow slit and four\
  \ merlons—was a fair likeness of the tower of the keep ahead of her.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Beyond the gate was about what she'd expected—an expanse of rich black dirt\
  \ and scrubby grass with various outbuildings and storage sheds. A stable stood\
  \ along the wall directly west of the gate. All of this, too, seemed finely ordered.\
  \ There were no sagging roofs or rotting joists, no mismatched roof thatching.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>How did the lord of this little burg manage such order in the midst\
  \ of such chaos? He might not be the simple hayseed with delusions of grandeur she'd\
  \ anticipated. Lisette supposed it didn't really matter, so long as the money was\
  \ good.</p> \n     <p>As she crossed the compound, the keep's metal-banded door\
  \ opened wide, and out walked three tall, splendid figures. One was dressed in black\
  \ traveling clothes, like herself, and the others in green and brown forest gear.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Elves. She'd seen her share of them in various cities, but these were\
  \ no ordinary citizens. They walked with a warrior's confidence, shoulders wide.\
  \ Their eyes had a veteran's look, measuring all that they took in.</p> \n     <p>Each\
  \ gauged her as they walked for the stables, and as one adjusted the strap of his\
  \ quiver, she realized with a start that his left hand was nothing more than a hook.\
  \ He was the shortest of the lot, though still half a head taller than herself,\
  \ and one of the most beautiful creatures she had ever seen, even for an elf. His\
  \ coppery brown hair was long, straight, and thick, and his dark eyes were dotted\
  \ with luminous amber flecks. Many elven males struck her as youthful or effeminate,\
  \ but not this one, whose fine-featured face seemed grimly competent, and was marred\
  \ by a small scar along his nose. She was shocked to find that her breath actually\
  \ caught in her throat a bit as his eyes met hers. Worse, he seemed to see or hear\
  \ it, for his gaze fastened on her a moment longer. Then he glanced at the hook\
  \ upon his arm. His expression hardened, and he strode after his companions.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lisette wasn't used to feeling regret, but she had a mad impulse to\
  \ follow and tell him that it wasn't the hook she'd gasped at. But what should she\
  \ care about what an elf thought of her feelings?</p> \n     <p>She found someone\
  \ else watching: a lean, bearded man in the tower doorway. She returned his scrutiny\
  \ as she walked closer.</p> \n     <p>The stranger stood perhaps six feet tall,\
  \ with a full head of brown hair. That and his beard were lined with distinguished\
  \ bands of silver. His face was weathered but handsome, and she guessed him to be\
  \ somewhere in his late thirties or early forties. His breeks were brown, his cuffed\
  \ and collared shirt white and tight over thick shoulders. He had a swordsman's\
  \ build, she thought, though she saw no blade upon him.</p> \n     <p>Lisette halted\
  \ before him.</p> \n     <p>\"Welcome,\" the man said in a subdued baritone. \"\
  I think you may have come to see me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Lord Avelis?\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Avelis will do,\" he replied. \"And you are?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Lisette Demonde.\
  \ Of Cheliax.\"</p> \n     <p>He didn't quite manage to hold in his surprise. One\
  \ eyebrow twitched. Somehow, she was not quite what he'd expected. But he didn't\
  \ let it stop him. \"It was good of you to come so quickly. Please, follow me.\"\
  \ He turned on one boot heel and addressed someone out of sight within the building,\
  \ telling them to bring refreshments.</p> \n     <p>Lisette followed the mayor through\
  \ a common room, then a deep doorway—almost a short tunnel—and into a long, narrow\
  \ office. Apart from a small, high window, the room lacked natural light, which\
  \ explained the lanterns hung from dark joists over the desk.</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ was just barely room for Avelis to slide around the desk, and this he did before\
  \ turning to face her and gesturing to the chairs.</p> \n     <p>As they took their\
  \ seats, she noted the well-crafted wooden cabinet under the window behind him.\
  \ The elm desk was simply but finely made, and the papers on its surface neatly\
  \ stacked.</p> \n     <p>\"Your arrival was fortuitous,\" Avelis told her. \"I've\
  \ made inquiries about...those in your line of profession, but none of them have\
  \ come.\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette smiled thinly. \"The River Kingdoms is a long way\
  \ to come for twenty gold sails. I assume you don't want someone local.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"You assume correctly.\"</p> \n     <p>A chubby servant girl knocked upon\
  \ the door behind them and hurried forward with a platter holding a wine bottle\
  \ and two glasses.</p> \n     <p>\"Just set it on the desk, Syra. Thank you. Please\
  \ close the door behind you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, Mayor,\" she said, curtsying\
  \ to him before she departed. The door shut with a heavy thud.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Please, have a drink.\" The mayor's hand indicated the platter.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  You're very kind. After we discuss our business, perhaps.\"</p> \n     <p>Avelis\
  \ nodded once, sharply. \"I'll cut to the point.\" He reached under the desk, and\
  \ Lisette tensed as she heard a drawer being opened. A moment later, Avelis set\
  \ a cloth bag upon the wood, where it jangled with a heavy thud. He pushed it toward\
  \ her. \"Twenty gold sails. That's for hearing me out and keeping your mouth shut.\
  \ Even if you don't like what I offer you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"That's right.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She loosened the leather tie cord and peered within, then lifted one\
  \ of the coins to the sunlight. It was Andoren currency, with a shine so clear it\
  \ must be virtually unhandled. She tested one between her back teeth, found it appropriately\
  \ soft and pure, and dropped it back in with its fellows before cinching the bag\
  \ and dropping it into the pack she'd slung over the chair back.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Don't you want to count it?\" Avelis sounded amused.</p> \n     <p>\"I did,\" she\
  \ said, which wasn't entirely true, but she could tell there were at least fifteen\
  \ sails in there, which was good enough for her. \"Alright, Avelis, I can see you're\
  \ serious about this. What do you want me for?\"</p> \n     <p>Avelis steepled his\
  \ fingers. \"I need you to kill an orc.\"</p> \n     <p>She laughed. \"Any decent\
  \ mercenary can do that job, Mayor. And your town is crawling with them. Your guard\
  \ force looks surprisingly capable.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, it is. But it's the captain\
  \ of my guard I want you to kill.\"</p> \n     <p>The expression upon his face was\
  \ so strange, what with his twitching smile and the burning gleam in his eyes, that\
  \ she thought at first that he joked.</p> \n     <p>She realized he was serious\
  \ as he spoke on. \"I suppose I should explain that he's partly human.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>She cleared her throat. He probably wasn't going to handle this well. Avelis\
  \ seemed like a man who was used to having his way. \"I'm a bounty hunter, Mayor,\
  \ not an assassin.\"</p> \n     <p>Avelis shrugged. \"Is there a difference? I'm\
  \ putting a private bounty on him.\"</p> \n     <p>She wanted to ask how large that\
  \ bounty was, but she was already treading on thin ice. \"Has he broken the laws\
  \ of your community?\"</p> \n     <p>\"No.\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette shook her head.\
  \ \"Then that's an assassination. That's not my line.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, you\
  \ haven't yet heard my price.\"</p> \n     <p>Now the trick was leaving the meeting\
  \ gracefully. She offered a few alternative suggestions. \"If you want him killed,\
  \ hire some guards to attack him. Hire some bravos. Poison him.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  My guards are fiercely loyal to him. They would sooner betray me. And he would kill\
  \ any warriors sent against him. Poison...would be too suspicious. I want you. And\
  \ I will pay you very well.\"</p> \n     <p>Again she saw that strange gleam in\
  \ his eyes, and the peculiar shifting smile. She felt a dawning curiosity about\
  \ the money. \"How well?\"</p> \n     <p>Avelis reached slowly into an inside pocket\
  \ to produce a small red silk bag. He undid the drawstrings, cupped his left hand,\
  \ and poured out a stream of small gems, each the size of her thumbnail. Lisette\
  \ recognized bloodstone and carnelian, moonstone and onyx.</p> \n     <p>\"Every\
  \ one of them is worth at least fifty gold sails. A fortune that transports well.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>It was far more than what Lisette would have guessed. She had many\
  \ questions, but thought to keep him talking while she considered the matter. \"\
  Pardon my asking, but if you have all of these, what are you doing...here?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Avelis's eyes narrowed. \"That's not really your concern, is it? Do\
  \ the job well and all this is yours.\" He extended the palm of his hands, strewn\
  \ with gems, and Lisette reached out to select one. She held it up between thumb\
  \ and forefinger, and directed it into a mote-filled sunbeam.</p> \n     <p>\"That's\
  \ more than four thousand sails for what's likely to be a week's work.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Lisette had been paid in gemstones often enough that she knew a real one\
  \ when she saw it. She dropped that one back into his palm and chose another at\
  \ random. It, too, was finely cut, glimmering with color.</p> \n     <p>She'd had\
  \ good reasons for walking away from her earlier profession, and even finer reasons\
  \ for permanently keeping her distance. Yet this was good money—absurdly good, given\
  \ the circumstances—and if she played things right, no one would ever know. How\
  \ would the Black Coil ever hear about the death of a half-orc in the River Kingdoms?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>With this kind of money she might finally have the funds to set up permanent\
  \ residence in Triela in one of those rambling old Chelish-style mansions. There\
  \ were any number of them sinking slowly into disrepair. Between this and the funds\
  \ she'd stashed in Almas, she might just be able to lay claim to one and afford\
  \ the upkeep.</p> \n     <p>The real question might have been why the mayor wasn't\
  \ doing the same thing. But then, as he said, that really wasn't her business. Maybe\
  \ he was one of those driven to command. Or maybe he'd done something terrible under\
  \ his real name and had fled to the frontier to start afresh.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ considered the mayor as she dropped the gem back into his palm. \"Why do you want\
  \ him dead?\"</p> \n     <p>His smile widened, showing teeth, and he gathered in\
  \ the gems. \"He killed my son, and is marrying my daughter. He will rule after\
  \ me...unless I kill him.\"</p> \n     <p>Had he missed the obvious? Some, blinded\
  \ by desire for vengeance, were too quick to dismiss easier methods. \"Wouldn't\
  \ it be easy to forbid the marriage and bring him to trial?\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's\
  \ not so simple.\" Avelis's lip curled in a savage sneer before he regained composure.\
  \ \"It was no blade that killed my Melloc, but negligence. My son was on patrol\
  \ with the orc, who didn't have the brains to safeguard him. Most of the village\
  \ doesn't even think it's the orc's fault.\" The mayor's eyes burned. \"He's got\
  \ all of them fooled.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What do you mean?\"</p> \n     <p>\"They\
  \ like him. They trust him.\"</p> \n     <p>\"A half-orc?\"</p> \n     <p>Avelis\
  \ nodded once. \"Two years ago this community was on the brink of ruin. Bandits\
  \ and river raiders were a constant threat. Despite my best efforts, the town was\
  \ lawless and violent.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And Drelm fixed all this for you?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"The orc and his friend. An elven woman named Elyana. They were just\
  \ passing through, but with their help things quickly turned around. I was grateful,\
  \ understand. He's been my guard captain now for the last year and a half, and Elyana\
  \ remains a sort of informal advisor. She's very, very good.\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette\
  \ managed not to smirk at the open lust in the man's tone. So Avelis had a thing\
  \ for pointed ears. Then again, given her reaction in the courtyard, who was she\
  \ to talk?</p> \n     <p>\"The town has embraced them,\" Avelis went on. \"They've\
  \ even embraced the idea of him...courting my daughter. But the thought of his blood\
  \ mingling with mine...\" The fingers on the mayor's left hand slowly curled inward,\
  \ and he stared down at the clenched fist, almost in surprise. It began to shake.\
  \ \"I should have seen it,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"He means to rule after\
  \ me!\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette thought she had a handle on the matter now, but she\
  \ summarized for clarity. Before discussing contracts, she always made sure expectations\
  \ were clear between her and her employer. \"You want him dead, but not in an obvious\
  \ way. And you don't want to anger the village, or his friend the elf?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Exactly.\"</p> \n     <p>\"How is it that a half-orc and an elf are friends?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Avelis snorted. \"They served together over in Taldor. I thought\
  \ they were lovers for the longest time, or I'd have been more worried when Drelm\
  \ was near my daughter. He's so...proper...I didn't even realize what was happening\
  \ until it was too late.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Well, I don't have any love for orcs.\
  \ But my reputation is as a bounty hunter. I take on legal cases. I'd like an official\
  \ contract.\"</p> \n     <p>Avelis favored her with a long look, then set his elbows\
  \ on the desk and steepled his fingers. \"I think the money's good enough that we\
  \ don't need a contract. Don't you? Papers can fall into the wrong hands.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Maybe you should think about hiring someone else then. As I said,\
  \ I'm not an assassin.\" Not anymore. And by her covenant, she could not work as\
  \ one. She shouldn't even be sitting here.</p> \n     <p>\"Well, I'm the ruler here,\
  \ and I'll pay a large bounty. I can even turn the paper over to you, if you wish,\
  \ once you succeed.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I always come through on a contract,\" Lisette\
  \ said.</p> \n     <p>\"I've no doubt. You managed to impress Lieutenant Demid,\
  \ which is no mean feat. He said that you felled three men, and that you used strange\
  \ weapons that launch metal balls, but aren't magic.\"</p> \n     <p>He was doing\
  \ his best to change the subject. \"That's true enough. I want the contract with\
  \ me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"That's really not possible.\"</p> \n     <p>She thought\
  \ about walking out. Yet... \"Then I want half, now.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Half?\" he\
  \ spluttered.</p> \n     <p>\"Unless you give me a contract that will hold up in\
  \ court.\"</p> \n     <p>Avelis frowned, and his good looks soured. The eyes narrowed,\
  \ lines curled about his mouth, and she saw what he would look like in ten or fifteen\
  \ more years. A bitter, angry old man.</p> \n     <p>Avelis let out a pent-up breath.\
  \ \"Very well. But there is one more condition. Drelm must die, but it can't be\
  \ done in a way that alerts anyone—especially not Elyana, whom I would rather remain\
  \ to serve the town. Her counsel is quite valuable to me.\"</p> \n     <p>I'll bet\
  \ it is, Lisette thought, but Avelis seemed oblivious to how much he was revealing\
  \ about himself. \"And it can't be done promptly,\" he continued. \"You've probably\
  \ noted the influx of warriors.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It was hard to miss.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"A deadly beast's killing people up and down the river.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  One beast?\"</p> \n     <p>\"We think so. It was my son's last wish that we band\
  \ together to launch an expedition to hunt the thing down. I've joined forces with\
  \ Kyonin, Tymon, Riverton, and Sevenarches, and we've scraped enough together to\
  \ reward those who kill it. Drelm and Elyana are heading the expedition. It must\
  \ succeed—it was the beast that killed my boy, and I will see it go down. Which\
  \ means Drelm can't be killed until the thing is dead. He's too good a warrior.\
  \ Do you understand?\"</p> \n     <p>More complications. She should have known it\
  \ would have more complications. \"So you want me to go on the expedition with them\
  \ through the wilderness and pretend to hunt for this thing with them. What sort\
  \ of beast is it?\"</p> \n     <p>\"No one's really seen it.\" Avelis turned over\
  \ an empty palm. \"What we do know is that it likes to kill. It's smashed into homes\
  \ and outposts and hunting camps up and down the river for the last six months.\
  \ It comes and goes as it likes, vanishing right in front of witnesses.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Better and better. She kept the disgust from her voice. \"I see.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Some of the best trackers in the River Kingdoms will be along,\" Avelis\
  \ said. \"I can't imagine it taking more than a week. And at some point, while you're\
  \ trying to shoot the beast with one of your alchemical wands, Drelm will just get\
  \ in the way. And he <i>will</i> get in the way—he'll be in the forefront to kill\
  \ the thing, I guarantee it. And you, with your ranged weapons, will be standing\
  \ back. Easy.\"</p> \n     <p>Somehow she doubted it would be as easy as he supposed.\
  \ And then Avelis opened the bag once more. \"Hold out your hand, and we'll count\
  \ out your advance. That is, if you're in.\"</p> \n     <p>She hesitated only a\
  \ moment. \"I'm in.\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"\
