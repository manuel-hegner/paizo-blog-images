  artist: "a sudden, desperate need for a larger life than cattle and corn, Valeros\
    \ packed quietly and left in the middle of the night with no more than a change\
    \ of clothes, some pilfered food, and an old axe handle to discourage any ruffians\
    \ who might seek to divest him of either. It was to become a theme that would\
    \ follow him for the rest of his life. In the years since, Valeros has come a\
    \ long way"
