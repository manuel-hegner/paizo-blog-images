  \ \n   <p>by Andrew Penn Romine</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: The Rose and the Star</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The\
  \ future is not so mysterious, to those of us who know how to read the turning roof\
  \ of the sky. When that array of glittering stars beckons you to the gilded paths\
  \ of fortune, you know you are destined for greatness.</span></p> \n    <p>Still,\
  \ bracing myself on an outcropping of black rock, the remnant of some ancient volcanism\
  \ or arcane calamity, I wondered if perhaps the stars had other plans for me. I\
  \ stood blinking into the westering sun at the rim of a shallow valley deep within\
  \ the desert of Ketz, buffeted by a wind like a belch from a reeking furnace. I\
  \ wrapped my keffiyeh tightly around my face, but the sand still ground in my teeth\
  \ as I clamped my mouth shut. </p> \n    <p>Despite the fearful wasteland, the promising\
  \ allure of ancient treasure beckoned before me. A hill of black and red stones\
  \ loomed above the shimmering desolation, crowned by a squat flat-topped tower seemingly\
  \ as old as the Ketz Desert itself. Azzah's Tower—just where I had calculated it\
  \ must be. Even through the drift of centuries, polar Cynosure had pointed me true\
  \ on my star charts. </p> \n    <p>A short slide back down the slope deposited me\
  \ in the minimal shelter of the defile that wound like an ancient road toward the\
  \ tower. My minders awaited me beside their camels, a company appointed by the satrap\
  \ himself to ensure I read my star charts accurately. Four were warriors, clad in\
  \ layers of ochre leather and black cloth and bristling with the tools of their\
  \ trade—scimitar, dagger, and a keen impatience for a halfling astronomer.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Najh Semekh, their captain, a human with a touch of the ifrit in his brassy\
  \ hair, sneered down at me with impatient disdain dulling his chestnut eyes. Resentment\
  \ pinched his brow and darkened the planes of his face. I imagined he thought himself\
  \ handsome and witty, but after four weeks in the desert I'd grown weary of his\
  \ counterfeit charm. As a scout in the satrap's service, he claimed familiarity\
  \ with the Ketz's trackless waste, but it was I who predicted the tower's actual\
  \ location, not he. </p> \n    <p>\"What do you see yonder, thief?\" Najh inquired.\
  \ \"Is this the right place?\"</p> \n    <p>I allowed a smile to blossom and inclined\
  \ my head in a semblance of a bow. I still bristled at the epithet \"thief,\" as\
  \ it was hardly a fitting title for Haron esh Kazzar, palace astrologer. It was\
  \ perhaps accurate, however, for I'd been caught in the satrap's personal library\
  \ with an armload of scrolls and a thin, rare volume of star-lore tucked in my sash.\
  \ One parchment of particular interest detailed possible locations for the time-lost\
  \ tower. Explaining that I had intended only to borrow the items in question for\
  \ an evening of study failed to move the guards, the magistrate, or indeed the satrap\
  \ himself. </p> \n    <p>\"A tower, just where your ancient survey map indicated.\
  \ In a few short hours, the sign of the Stranger will rise behind it, and you will\
  \ have your proof. Of course, there's only one among us who can ultimately confirm\
  \ that we have found Azzah's fabled tower.\" </p> \n    <p>I pointed to our final\
  \ companion, kneeling beyond the circle of Captain Najh and his warriors. Shaba\
  \ Alemas, a human in a sand-colored robe befitting a hermit, was compact and muscular;\
  \ even her long black hair had been braided close around her head. Her exact age\
  \ eluded me, for the elements had etched her skin, but a youthful vitality remained\
  \ in the flash of her topaz eyes. Where Najh chattered constantly, hers was a more\
  \ phlegmatic demeanor. Now she knelt in prayer, her sun-dry lips moving in silent\
  \ communion with the goddess she served—Sarenrae, the Dawnflower.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ held little patience for the cult of the Dawnflower—they placed such importance\
  \ on the sun's course across the sky that they consigned the rest of the stars to\
  \ a lesser role. But Shaba Alemas seemed to me touched by starlight. I saw its delicate\
  \ tracery along the rough line of her jaw and the pale whirl of her eyes. Despite\
  \ her rustic appearance and stolid devotion to her goddess, she would rise to great\
  \ things someday. </p> \n    <p>The satrap, hungering for war with the north, encouraged\
  \ the more militant devotees of her holy order to fits of zealotry and righteousness.\
  \ I had naturally assumed Shaba one of these at first, for she held her chin high\
  \ and spoke of Sarenrae's great divinity. However, she armored herself with only\
  \ her faith, a homespun robe, and a scimitar she strapped to her belt but never\
  \ drew.</p> \n    <p>Shaba ceased her prayer and fixed me with a penetrating look.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"This is the place. Fate and our astrologer have led us true.\" </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Najh laughed, the short bark of a jackal. </p> \n    <p>\"Indeed, and\
  \ I suppose my efforts leading us through the desert were inconsequential?\" </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Shaba inclined her head and lifted one knotted brow. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  You and your men have my utmost thanks as well, Captain Najh.\" </p> \n    <p>The\
  \ corners of Najh's mount twitched in estimation of the value of Shaba's gratitude.\
  \ I had seen similar expressions on my own Aunt Jaffira's face when receiving poor\
  \ bids for her camels. If Shaba noticed, she made no remark, but stood and prepared\
  \ to remount. </p> \n    <p>\"You think it's fate that brought us here, Sister Shaba?\"\
  \ I asked. \"In truth, I supposed my destiny might lead me to a less wretched spot.\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> Every scholar is a thief at heart.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"Fate\
  \ and destiny aren't the same, astrologer. I thought you of all people might understand\
  \ that.\" </p> \n    <p>\"So fate is living out your days in the desert with a few\
  \ crazy followers, and destiny is to be well-remembered for it?\" I laughed, but\
  \ Shaba found no humor in my jibe. </p> \n    <p>\"Azzah was a devoted servant of\
  \ the Dawnflower,\" Shaba said, \"and his final words will heal the rift in my church.\
  \ This is his destiny. And it's also mine.\" </p> \n    <p>As if in mockery, a camel\
  \ suddenly brayed, and the other beasts stamped in sympathetic restlessness, crunching\
  \ the gravel of the narrow defile. The wind died, and in the odd stillness my heart\
  \ thrashed in my chest. Something was wrong. </p> \n    <p>Where there had been\
  \ none a moment ago, a cloud moved across the sun, plunging us into shadow. One\
  \ of the soldiers cried out as a rush of hot air returned, blasting down the gully\
  \ counter to the previous wind. In the premature night, there was the whooshing\
  \ of a great bellows. Immense pinions fretted the sky, and a carrion-stench fouler\
  \ than the backside of a camel clawed at my throat. The camels groaned in terror\
  \ even as the sun returned, and the soldiers struggled to control them. Only Shaba's\
  \ beast remained placid. </p> \n    <p>A great shriek ripped open the cobalt sky,\
  \ forcing our hands to our ears. One of Najh's soldiers lost the battle with his\
  \ mount, and the creature raced from the defile, bleating in terror, dragging the\
  \ poor man behind. Shaba moved with phenomenal speed, hurtling into the open after\
  \ the fleeing beast. </p> \n    <p>\"No!\" I shouted, knowing the death that wheeled\
  \ through the vault of the sky. It was the great terror of the desert, a bird of\
  \ prey that dined on elephants and camels as well as unlucky travelers and foolish\
  \ seekers. </p> \n    <p>The roc. </p> \n    <p>Fright numbed my good sense, and\
  \ I raced after Shaba, though my legs didn't carry me so fast up the scree. Najh,\
  \ his eyes wide with surprise, made no move to follow even though it was his man\
  \ in peril. From the corner of my eye, I witnessed a curious gleam in the captain's\
  \ eye and doubted it was from tears shed for his soldier. </p> \n    <p>I slid down\
  \ the other side of the scree to the heat-blasted stones of the plain. The bleating\
  \ camel and its doomed rider had already traversed a hundred paces in the opposite\
  \ direction from the tower, but was still well within view of the vast black bird\
  \ that rushed from the east like a hungry cloud. The cruciform spread of its ink-black\
  \ feathers cut a hole in the vault of the sky. The copper flash of its hooked beak\
  \ like the prow of a merchant ship dazzled my eyes. Shaba ran ahead of me, the ragged\
  \ edge of her anchorite's robe dragged the ground and cast small dust devils in\
  \ her wake. </p> \n    <p>I cursed myself as a fool for following. What was it to\
  \ me if Shaba met her end in the gullet of a roc? Surely we could still collect\
  \ whatever artifacts the satrap wished us to acquire without her help. I didn't\
  \ relish the thought of the trip back across the desert at Najh's mercy, as I suspected\
  \ he was as tired of my company as I was of his, but that alone was no reason to\
  \ risk my life. </p> \n    <p>No, in truth, it was the starshine in Shaba's eyes\
  \ that drew me. Few of us are touched thus by fate, or destiny, or whatever the\
  \ dour hermit chose to name it. To lose her to such ignominious circumstances would\
  \ be a tragedy.</p> \n    <p>Shaba, focused on saving the soldier, ran headlong\
  \ into the roc's path. I'd thus far avoided calling upon my star-granted gifts within\
  \ Najh's sight, lest he think me capable of completing this expedition by sorcery\
  \ alone. Yet I wouldn't stand by as the hermit tried to martyr herself.</p> \n \
  \   <p>The heavenly motions of the stars are ever smooth, without the slightest\
  \ hitch or friction. It was this aspect of the sky that I took into myself and then\
  \ cast out, into the sands in front of Shaba, making them as slick as oiled glass.\
  \ Her feet slid out from under her, and she fell hard to the ground just as the\
  \ great black roc dived. </p> \n    <p>The camel and its hapless rider were beyond\
  \ my help, and the bird snatched them into the air with an exultant screech that\
  \ nearly made my ears bleed. Enormous feathers fluttered over the desert, each worth\
  \ a sizable amount of coin to the right buyer. I calculated the risk of collecting\
  \ at least a few, but the roc, unbalanced with its struggling load, still wheeled\
  \ overhead. </p> \n    <p>I crawled to Shaba and touched the hermit upon the heel.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"We must crawl back to the defile. Slowly, before it notices us.\"\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"I could've saved that man, halfling.\" </p> \n    <p>I shrugged,\
  \ indicating with two fingers crooked into a beak-shape what her likely fate would\
  \ have been. </p> \n    <p>\"I suspected you had a gift with sorcery,\" she said,\
  \ her eyes still fixed on the circling roc.</p> \n    <p>\"Don't tell Najh. He'll\
  \ expect miracles.\" </p> \n    <p>What might have been the ghost of a smile tugged\
  \ at the corners of Shaba's mouth.</p> \n    <p>\"We need you in Azzah's Tower,\
  \ sister. I'm not going in there with just the satrap's men.\" </p> \n    <p>\"\
  Aren't you the satrap's man?\" she sneered.</p> \n    <p>\"Only as much as it pleases\
  \ me to be.\" </p> \n    <p>\"You're a curious one, Kazzar. I haven't decided to\
  \ what purpose Sarenrae has fated us to meet.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps to many purposes,\
  \ Sister Shaba. My fate is guided by more than one star.\" </p> \n    <p>The roc,\
  \ still clutching its prize, turned toward the tower. It alighted there, tearing\
  \ into its meal and shrieking out across the valley. The dying sun silhouetted a\
  \ gobbet of meat as it vanished down the roc's feathered gullet. Deep in my belly,\
  \ there came a fluttering of tiny wings.</p> \n    <p>\"The roc has picked a most\
  \ inopportune place to nest.\"</p> \n    <p>Shaba nodded, her smile growing. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"But sorcerer,\" she said quietly, \"did you remark upon its eyes as\
  \ it circled past us? Milky as quartz. Its beak is cracked with age, and its feathers\
  \ droop most raggedly.\" </p> \n    <p>The news warmed my spirit like a gallon of\
  \ Taldane brandy. </p> \n    <p>\"If it's blind, then we might be able to approach\
  \ the tower after all,\" I said. \"As long as we're quiet, of course.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"And the wind is in our favor. It is fateful.\" </p> \n    <p>The fervor\
  \ in her stony blue eyes again befitted not so much an anchorite, but a martyr.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>We crawled back to the defile, where Najh received us with callous\
  \ relief that we had survived. </p> \n    <p>\"Hulf was a good soldier,\" he said,\
  \ his sincerity vaporous enough to see through. </p> \n    <p>\"Sister Shaba did\
  \ all she could to prevent his death, Captain,\" I replied. The man had plenty of\
  \ reason to dislike me, but the look he cast at Shaba's back as she walked away\
  \ tingled my spine with the breaths of a thousand sand-spiders.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Leave the camels here,\" Shaba commanded, tying the reins of her camel to a horn\
  \ of rock. \"We can proceed to the tower on foot.\"</p> \n    <p>\"With the roc\
  \ up there?\" Najh asked, clearly chafing under orders that weren't his own.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It's blind, or nearly so. If we proceed slowly and quietly, we've got\
  \ hope of gaining entry to the eastern vestibule undetected.\" </p> \n    <p>Najh\
  \ crooked his jaw, weighing Shaba's plan, his eyes lit with calculation cold enough\
  \ to bring snow to the desert. Then he nodded. As he turned to lead his remaining\
  \ men down the defile after the priest, I saw that his fight to control his mount\
  \ had left his tunic askew, revealing a patch of flesh at the base of his neck.\
  \ There on his bare skin was a symbol scribed of darkest hues: a drooping rose bisected\
  \ with a needle. </p> \n    <p>I had learned something of my family's trade before\
  \ the stars called me away. Camel trading. Caravanserai supply. The selling of secrets.\
  \ At Uncle Ilnario's knee I had learned of the true centers of power in Katheer,\
  \ and that not all of them resided in the satrap's palace. The Pierced Rose was\
  \ a sign of one of the most notorious mercenary gangs in all of Qadira. Indelicate\
  \ thugs, those wearing the Pierced Rose relied mostly on their reputation for violence\
  \ to solve problems. To find that Najh was one of their number was no small omen\
  \ of trouble. </p> \n    <p>And I placed great significance in such signs. </p>\
