  \ alt=\"Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook.\"></a> \n      </div> \n      <p>Pathfinder\
  \ is a game with a legacy. Drawing from a heritage stretching back to Gary’s table,\
  \ when envisioning a new edition, it is tempting to simply iterate on what has come\
  \ before. After all, that was the strategy that built Pathfinder into an incredibly\
  \ successful Roleplaying Game.</p> \n      <p>That was not the route we decided\
  \ to take.</p> \n      <p>Simply iterating on the same game engine was not enough.\
  \ The 3.5 engine has had its day, and as a team we decided that it was time to modernize,\
  \ to create a version of Pathfinder that was more than just tinkering around the\
  \ edges. The game needed to evolve to speak to the desires of the current crowd\
  \ of gamers. It needed to an engine tune up that made it easier for novices to grasp,\
  \ while still providing a rich depth of option. What it needed was elegance in its\
  \ design.</p> \n      <p>The first steps were taken shortly after the first edition\
  \ of Pathfinder made their way to the printer. The work that was left undone, due\
  \ the necessity of compatibility, would become the basis for what the new game needed\
  \ to be. The math engine caused problems with high level play that led to an unsatisfactory\
  \ game experience. Imbalances in fundamental class design created imbalances that\
  \ left some players feeling unable to contribute. A bloat of rules options without\
  \ any checks in the system created a game that was unwieldy to run.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>But in spite of all that, the game itself was still a success, due in large\
  \ part to the world it created, and the investment it fostered in players and game\
  \ masters alike. We knew, from the outset, that the story of the game had to remain\
  \ the same, even if the rules that made it manifest needed to change. Achieving\
  \ that goal meant that we needed to do a lot more than simply clean up the game.\
  \ We needed to start over.</p> \n      <p>Pathfinder Second Edition does not include\
  \ one single sentence or rule carried over directly from first edition. That was\
  \ one of the first choices we made. Everything was up for examination, from the\
  \ fundamental math formulas behind the game to the individual statistics for longswords.\
  \ And while that made for a lot of additional work, it also meant that we could\
  \ look at each rule cleanly, unburdened by the conventions of the past. In the end,\
  \ many things work similarly to how they did in first edition (a longsword still\
  \ does 1d8 damage), but we were able to innovate where the game called for innovation.\
  \ Take the action system for example. In first edition, when it was your turn to\
  \ act in combat, you had a complicated menu of options, between move actions, standard\
  \ actions, free actions, swift actions, and on and on. In second edition, we simplified\
  \ that to just three actions, removing all the types and making your turn a more\
  \ dynamic part of the game. The narrative is still fundamentally the same, but how\
  \ you take part in the game is much simpler to teach and easy to use.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Next, we knew that if we were going to take a fresh look at the game, we\
  \ needed a playtest that would allow us to gather meaningful data about the core\
  \ of the game’s engine. In the past, our playtests had focused on the experience\
  \ of the rules, relying mostly on player and game master anecdotes to gather information.\
  \ While this gave us insight, it was impossible to apply any measure of statistical\
  \ rigor to the data. For second edition we decided to create an environment that\
  \ allowed us to gather better data about our game. To start, we needed to standardize\
  \ the feedback by getting a massive number of players to experience the same adventure.\
  \ We wrote <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, a seven part mini-campaign, with the express goal\
  \ of testing targeted parts of the Pathfinder game engine. There was a part filled\
  \ with undead to stress test the player’s healing capabilities. There was a tests\
  \ focused on the various skill disciplines in the game. And perhaps most importantly,\
  \ there was a test designed to push the characters beyond their limits, to test\
  \ the rules for death and dying in the game.</p> \n      <p>While this sort of hardcore\
  \ testing gave us invaluable information about how our game assumptions were playing\
  \ out, it was a grueling test for some groups of players. After all, playing the\
  \ same type of encounter over and over to determine the breaking point is not exactly\
  \ the most fun way to play the game. Their sacrifices, though, led to some of the\
  \ most in-depth analysis we have ever seen on an RPG. It led us to fully understand\
  \ the spots where our assumptions and biases were leading the game astray, allowing\
  \ us to course correct. Some systems were entirely abandoned (like resonance, a\
  \ system for balancing magic item use), while others were refined into rules to\
  \ meet player desire (like the new system for focus spells, allowing casters to\
  \ utilize their signature spells all day long). The playtest was one of the hardest\
  \ we have ever run, but it was also the most rewarding.</p> \n      <p>The second\
  \ edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game has been in the works for years, but\
  \ now on the eve of its release, all of that work is about to pay off. The new version\
  \ of the game is simple to run and easier for new players to learn, but it keeps\
  \ all of the features that players have come to appreciate from Pathfinder: deep\
  \ character customization, a rich world narrative, and all the tools to tell the\
  \ type of stories that you want to tell. Speaking for the team, we can’t wait to\
  \ share those stories with you.</p> \n      <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of\
