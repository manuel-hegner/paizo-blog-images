  \ class=\"date\">Thursday, January 26, 2012</p> \n   <p>Tuesday, we announced the\
  \ Top 32 for RPG Superstar. Now those lucky, skilled gamers are hammering away at\
  \ the Round 2 task of designing a new Golarion organization. Their submissions are\
  \ due Friday, secretly reviewed by the judges over the weekend, and go live for\
  \ voting on Tuesday, January 31. Good luck to the Top 32!</p> \n   <p>If you submitted\
  \ a wondrous item and didn’t make it into the Top 32, don’t lose heart! One, not\
  \ winning your first RPG Superstar is a fine tradition upheld by 2009’s winner Neil\
  \ Spicer and 2010’s winner Matt Goodall—you now have a year to practice and hone\
  \ your craft for the next competition. And don’t forget to stop by the <a href=\"\
  /forums/dmtz54o1\">Official Critique My Item Thread</a> to get some feedback on\
  \ your item from the community and perhaps the judges!</p> \n   <p>I’m also doing\
  \ something new this year. During the selection process, the judges set aside items\
  \ that may be suitable for the Top 32, usually ending up with 40–60 items that they\
  \ winnow down to just 32 plus four alternates. If your item is on the following\
  \ list, your item was on that longer list but didn’t make that final cut. To help\
  \ improve your skills, if your item is listed here and you’d like me to give you\
  \ feedback from the perspective of a Paizo developer, reply to this blog post and\
  \ I’ll repost your item with my feedback—the same sort of feedback I’d give to a\
  \ new freelancer.</p> \n   <p><b>Note:</b> Only the items in the following list\
  \ get this special treatment... I don’t have time in my work schedule to give feedback\
  \ on hundreds of items. Also, requesting feedback means you won’t be able to submit\
  \ this item next year, as the judges will know who you are and therefore your item\
  \ won’t be anonymous anymore. Fortunately, a true superstar has more than one awesome\
  \ idea, and you should be able to take what you learned this year and create something\
  \ even better next year!</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><i>Bracers of Versatile\
