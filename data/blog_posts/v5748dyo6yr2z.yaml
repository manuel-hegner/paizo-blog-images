  \      </div>\n      <p>If you’re excited about playing Starfinder Second Edition,\
  \ you probably want to learn more about the setting–the fictional universe the game\
  \ takes place in. <em>Galaxy Guid</em>e is a tour of Starfinder’s setting that’\
  s sure to inspire countless games. It’s also a sourcebook full of tools for Game\
  \ Masters (GMs) and players, whether you’re planning to play a prewritten adventure\
  \ or create a homebrew campaign of your own!&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><em>Starfinder\
  \ Galaxy Guide</em> builds on existing lore from Starfinder First Edition, providing\
  \ updates to the setting following major events like the<a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinder/driftcrisis\"\
  > Drift Crisis</a> and the recent explosion of Aucturn, which featured in<a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq047uk?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday\"\
  > A Cosmic Birthday</a>. Epic struggles are unfolding between the despotic Veskarium\
  \ and the ruthless Azlanti Star Empire, beginning with<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq07flb?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-Empires-Devoured\"\
  > Empires Devoured</a> and sparking consequences that ripple across the galaxy—\
  and that’s only a taste of the dramatic events in <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy\
  \ Guide</em> that might shape your Starfinder games!</p>\n      <p>This book is\
  \ packed full of exciting new lore, including some wacky sectors of space you’ve\
  \ never explored before. Get ready to launch into Kazmurg’s Absurdity, an unexplored\
  \ sector of the galaxy created by former Starfinder Managing Creative Director Thurston\
  \ Hillman. Kazmurg’s Absurdity is a vast, magically warped territory that can only\
  \ be traversed using traditional maps. The Absurdity contains realms full of rich\
  \ resources and bizarre cultures warred over by conniving empires, cruel daemons,\
  \ and ruthless megacorporations. It’s the perfect place for an adventuring party\
  \ interested in exploring uncharted space and discovering new worlds filled with\
  \ ancient secrets and unimaginable treasures.</p>\n      <p><em>Starfinder Galaxy\
  \ Guide</em> is designed as a toolbox to help GMs tell different kinds of stories\
  \ using the Starfinder rules and setting, but it’s full of content for players,\
  \ too. Six new ancestries and six new archetypes provide plenty of options for creating\
  \ characters. Get to know the most powerful and influential factions in the galaxy,\
  \ tour major ports of call where you might spend downtime in your campaign, and\
  \ visit local hot spots where narrative hooks to draw characters into the setting\
  \ wait around every corner. <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy Guide</em> is your preview\
  \ of the Starfinder galaxy–it is fuel to launch your campaign into Second Edition,\
  \ or to blast your Pathfinder campaign into strange new worlds.</p>\n      <br>\n\

  \ </div>\n      <p>Still with me? I should sum it up, gree? <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy\
  \ Guide</em> contains….</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li>A 2-sided poster featuring a\
  \ political map of the Desna’s Path galaxy and an infographic of the Pact Worlds\
  \ system, designed by Kyle Hunter.</li>\n       <li>Tools for telling common types\
  \ of stories (like dystopian and horror) in your Starfinder campaigns and incorporating\
  \ common elements such as high fantasy or advanced technology into your Starfinder\
  \ or Pathfinder adventures.</li>\n       <li>Tons of new backgrounds designed for\
  \ characters from the Starfinder galaxy!</li>\n       <li>Introduction to major\
  \ and minor factions in the galaxy.</li>\n       <li>Six new archetypes.</li>\n\
  \       <li>Six new playable ancestries.</li>\n       <li>Gorgeous art, new lore,\
  \ and inspiration for countless adventures!</li>\n       <li>The answers you’ve\
  \ been waiting for about special topics like what happened to those corporate dark\
  \ elves that lived on Apostae. (And perhaps other burning questions about the new\
  \ ORC space frontier!)</li>\n       <li>AND THE BEST PART: All the rules in this\
  \ book are fully compatible with Pathfinder Second Edition!!! That’s right; get\
  \ ready to send your Pathfinder party through a portal to a faraway planet, or to\
  \ give your Starfinder group a time machine. Or maybe you’d rather crash another\
  \ spaceship into Golarion, Numeria style. The galaxy’s your oyster now.</li>\n \
  \     </ul>\n      <p>Still not enough for you? Okay, then let’s take a closer look\
  \ at some of the content in this book and show off some spoilertastic art!</p>\n\
  \      <h3>Ancestries</h3>\n      <p>There’s six new ancestries in this book. That’\
  s right, that means that technically you’re going to have 16 ancestry options available\
  \ to you in August, not to mention the two versatile heritages and Pathfinder legacy\
  \ ancestries you can choose. Not bad, huh? Let’s talk a little more about those\
  \ ancestries.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6e1d4fac-fcae-4feb-b1f9-0ffea956aace/WitchwarperContemplative_5.png\"\

  \ to rub together? This contemplative doesn’t have that problem.”)</p>\n      </div>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Astrazoan:</strong> A shapeshifter who physically reshapes their\
  \ own anatomy using specialized musculature rather than using magic to change forms.\
  \ Sometimes they don’t get all the details of the change quite right—see if you\
  \ can spot all the astrazoans in this book!</p>\n      <p><strong>Contemplative:</strong>\
  \ An engorged brain with a vestigial body whose ultimate tools are a superior intellect\
  \ and psychic powers. Contemplatives live underground on Akiton where they ponder\
  \ mathematical and metaphysical questions or convene in psychic forums.</p>\n  \
  \    <p><strong>Dragonkin:</strong> A humanoid dragon hybrid who can form a deep\
  \ spiritual bond with one other creature. Dragonkin come from Triaxus and are the\
  \ heart of the Skyfire Legion, a troop of bonded warriors who defend their planet\
  \ alongside dragon allies.</p>\n      <p><strong>Kalo:</strong> A graceful aquatic\
  \ humanoid from Kalo-Mahoi, a watery moon orbiting Bretheda. An average kalo is\
  \ both athletic and creative, and most are known for their outrageous but practical\
  \ fashions.</p>\n      <p><strong>Sarcesian:</strong> A humanoid spacefarer with\
  \ energy wings who can survive in the void of space. Sarcesians live in isolated\
  \ communities in the Diaspora or travel solar streams to distant locations.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Vlaka:</strong> A wolflike nomad from Lajok with an incredible\
  \ sense of smell and unusual sensory adaptations. Vlakas who witnessed the rebirth\
  \ of their dying sun, Sota, are marked with starburst patterns that match their\
  \ natural blessing to kindle light.<br><br></p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Archetypes</h3>\n\
  \      <p>If you think the factions in <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em> are really\
  \ cool, this book also contains six archetypes that let you play as a member of\
  \ one of them! Here’s what the Starfinder team cooked up.</p>\n      <div class=\"\
