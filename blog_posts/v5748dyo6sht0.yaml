  \ Nothing about that sentence is stressful at all, nope. Let’s take a look at some\
  \ of our upcoming events!</p> \n     <h2>Stream Highlights</h2> \n     <p>All weekend,\
  \ we’ll be streaming liveplays with our partners, as well as panels with Paizo staffers\
  \ to tell you all about our upcoming products. While every panel is a must-see,\
  \ here are some of the highlights, as chosen by me (coworkers feel free to disagree\
  \ with me in my DMs):</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <ul> \n      <li><b>Keynote</b>\
  \ (Thursday 3pm EDT): Join Erik Mona as he talks as fast as he possibly can while\
  \ spilling as much information about the next year of products as possible! I think\
  \ his slideshow has clocked in somewhere around 70 slides of beautiful art, so you\
  \ won’t want to miss this one.</li> \n      <li><b>Catching Up with Paizo Organized\
  \ Play</b> (Thursday, 5pm EDT): Obviously I’m biased on this one, but Mike Kimmel\
  \ and Jenny Jarzabski have #plans, and they’ll be teasing some of those plans live\
  \ with me and Linda!</li> \n      <li><b>Pathfinder Designer Showcase</b> (Friday,\
  \ 4pm EDT): The Pathfinder Design Team is going to, somehow, talk about every upcoming\
  \ book in just one hour! This may or may not include details on books Erik announces\
  \ in his Keynote…</li> \n      <li><b>Ask Paizo Anything: Pathfinder</b> (Saturday,\
  \ 5pm EDT) and Starfinder (Saturday, 6pm EDT): We mean it, literally anything about\
  \ the world. Want to know where the best meal in Nantambu is? Dying to find out\
  \ what the runes of Eloritu mean? Come here and ask the teams behind our games your\
  \ burning questions! *answers not guaranteed, results may vary</li> \n     </ul>\
  \ \n     <p>You can see the full stream schedule for the weekend on our <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/gencon\">Gen Con landing page</a>.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Let’\
  s Play Some Games</h2> \n     <p>This year, we have over 500 games scheduled for\
  \ Gen Con Online! Tickets for many of them are <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/events?host=Paizo+Inc.\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">still available on Gen Con’s website</a>; ticket sales won’\
  t close until the game starts, but many of them will fill up, so don’t delay! Here\
  \ are some of my favorite scenarios we’re running this weekend:</p> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li><b>PFS 3-99 Fate in the Future and SFS 3-99 Perils of the Past</b>:\
  \ This year’s interactive special is premiering as our flagship event. Join us on\
  \ Friday afternoon for the PFS event and Saturday afternoon for the SFS event, as\
  \ our first-ever linked special takes you on a journey through time and space to\
  \ solve an anomaly and reunite lost adventurers. We can’t wait for you all to experience\
  \ this year’s adventure; tickets are still available for both events, so don’t wait,\
  \ grab one today!</li> \n      <li>If you want to dive right into our ongoing storylines,\
  \ definitely check out <b>PFS Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</b> and <b>SFS\
  \ Intro: Year of the Data Scourge</b>. These repeatable adventures will get you\
  \ right into the action, whether you’re a first-time adventurer or a long-time player!</li>\
  \ \n      <li>For our experienced Pathfinders, we have the entirety of the <b>Breaking\
  \ the Storm</b> arc running throughout the weekend. This high-level arc brings last\
  \ year’s metaplot to a close and is a real challenge for experienced characters.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>For my fellow Starfinders, we’ve got a diverse array of scenarios,\
  \ including <b>Secrets of Stillness</b>, where you’re asked to solve a mystery by\
  \ one of the faction leaders; <b>Combatant’s Concerto: Prelude to Revolution</b>,\
  \ in which a party becomes a sinister plot; and <b>A Waltz Through Myriad Worlds</b>,\
  \ a quest pack where you’ll get to experience four alternate timelines and discover\
  \ their secrets. All these and more have tickets available!</li> \n     </ul> \n\
  \     <p>Don’t forget to <a href=\"http://paizo.events/\">join our Discord server</a>\
  \ to get set up for your games; we’ll be hanging out there all weekend!</p> \n \
  \    <br> \n     <h2>Charity Auction</h2> \n     <p>As in previous years, we will\
  \ be running a charity auction to benefit Gen Con’s charity partners: <a href=\"\
  https://www.takethis.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Take This</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trinityhavenindy.org/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Trinity Haven</a>. You can read more about both organizations\
  \ on their websites or at Gen Con’s charity homepage. Last year we raised over $10,000\
  \ for charity with boons and other products, and while we’re not ready to announce\
  \ what we’re auctioning off yet, we hope you’ll join us in raising money for these\
  \ worthy causes.</p> \n     <p>We can’t wait to see you all at Gen Con Online, September\
  \ 16-19! If you have any questions, <a href=\"http://paizo.events/\">join our Discord</a>\
  \ and we’ll help you get ready for the event. Until next time - Explore! Report!\
  \ Cooperate! And stock up on easy-to-prep meals!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
