  \ to Vol II—Gen Con 2018!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, January 17, 2017</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p>I just finished attending MarsCon\
  \ in Williamsburg, Virginia, and am making my way back to Seattle. An unexpected\
  \ snowstorm kept me in Atlanta a bit longer than I planned, but piloting skill and\
  \ no ice meant the plane flew today and I made it safely to Seattle this afternoon.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This weekend, badges for Gen Con went on sale. We sent the message out\
  \ that our volunteer call would go live on Wednesday. So here it is! As the program\
  \ continues to grow and evolve, we make changes from year to year to streamline\
  \ processes and help the convention run smoothly. With over 300 volunteers and around\
  \ 1700 tables of organized play games running, Gen Con is easily our largest event.\
  \ This means even more attention on processes and efficiency. The changes below\
  \ are the same adjustments we made to PaizoCon and are aimed at bringing all the\
  \ large conventions into the same logistical umbrella.</p> \n     <p>First, we changed\
  \ the nomenclature from session or slot to block. Each block is 5 hours. This unifies\
  \ the terminology from the event support form used by our event organizers and keeps\
  \ things consistent across the board.</p> \n     <p>Second, we ditched using the\
  \ Tier system to describe how many volunteers. It is a RPGA holdover that caused\
  \ confusion, as the lower number the tier, the more slots a person volunteered.\
  \ Also, we have tiers for our scenarios, so having tiers for volunteers caused some\
  \ confusion in our data. This year, you register for the number of 5-hour blocks\
  \ you wish to volunteer.</p> \n     <p>Third, we are setting an 9-block maximum\
  \ for volunteering, with the goal that no volunteer will do more than 8 blocks and\
  \ that no one will be scheduled for more than 3 in a row. A full day is hard (been\
  \ there, done that) and we want people to take breaks to sleep, eat, bathe, and\
  \ see what the convention has to offer. This is really, really important, no matter\
  \ how much of a GM/HQ machine you want to be!</p> \n     <p>Fourth, it is my understanding\
  \ that the hotel lottery and badge refunds changed this year. I submitted our badge\
  \ request and should be able to drop them into volunteer accounts as soon as we\
  \ send out the acceptance letter and have an acknowledging email in reply. This\
  \ should allow volunteers signing up for less than 8-blocks to submit their names\
  \ for the hotel lottery, which occurs in February.</p> \n     <p>Fifth, we are looking\
  \ at ways to streamline our processes and reduce the number of HQ personnel. In\
  \ the interest of efficiency, we also are looking for volunteers willing to commit\
  \ to 7 and 8 blocks. Anyone may volunteer for a HQ position, but I want to be forthright\
  \ about the limitations of the position from the beginning.</p> \n     <p>Finally,\
  \ we are looking to schedule tables bottom up, instead of top down. By starting\
  \ off with a few tables of each scenario, then increasing based on ticket sales;\
  \ we should be better poised to respond to player demand. Hopefully, this means\
  \ that we will have fewer tables fail to make and fewer GMs released. Volunteers\
  \ will have their block schedules before event registration opens, but may not have\
  \ scenario list until late June/early July. We are still committed to getting scenarios\
  \ into GMs hands at least 2 weeks before Gen Con starts. While this split schedule\
  \ means more emails and paperwork, it should mean fewer changes at the last minute.\
  \ Hopefully, a more streamlined system all around and more efficient use of our\
  \ GM pool.</p> \n     <p>Block times:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"\
