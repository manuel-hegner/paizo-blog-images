  \ \n     <p>But before I get too mired into details of the rules, I want to talk\
  \ about the high-quality overall GM advice in the book. For instance, my favorite\
  \ bit of GM advice is this section in Gamemastering on adjudicating the rules, where\
  \ we flat out tell you the underlying principles so you can design improvised rules\
  \ on the fly!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n      <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_adjudicating.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Text inset: If you don’t know how long a quick task takes, go with 1 action,\
  \ or 2 actions if a character shouldn’t be able to perform it three times per round.\
  \  \r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you’re not sure what action a task uses, look for the most similar\
  \ basic action. If you don’t find one, make up an action adding any necessary traits\
  \ (usually attack, concentrate, manipulate, or move).\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen two sides\
  \ are opposed, have one roll against the other’s DC. Don’t have both sides roll\
  \ (initiative is the exception to this rule). The character who rolls is usually\
  \ the one acting (except in the case of saving throws).\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf an effect\
  \ raises or lowers chances of success, grant a +1 circumstance bonus or a –1 circumstance\
  \ penalty.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you’re not sure how difficult a significant challenge\
  \ should be, use the DC for the party’s level.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you’re making up\
  \ an effect, creatures should be incapacitated or killed on only a critical success\
  \ (or for a saving throw, on a critical failure).\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you don’t know\
  \ what check to use, pick the most appropriate skill. If no other skill applies\
  \ to a check to Recall Knowledge, use an appropriate Lore skill (usually at an untrained\
  \ proficiency rank).\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUse the characters’ daily preparations as the\
  \ time to reset anything that lasts roughly a day.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen a character\
  \ accomplishes something noteworthy that doesn’t have rules for XP, award them XP\
  \ for an accomplishment (10 to 30 XP, as described on page 507).\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen\
  \ the PCs fail at a task, look for a way they might fail forward, meaning the story\
  \ moves forward with a negative consequence rather than the failure halting progress\
  \ entirely.\"> \n     </div> \n     <p>There’re tips on encounter, session, adventure,\
  \ and campaign management as well! One useful new tool we added was the Pathfinder\
  \ baseline, which essentially explains a baseline assumption for edgy content. Whether\
  \ you want to follow it or not is totally up to your group. It’s a conversation\
  \ starter; the baseline determines what you should expect from our published adventures,\
  \ and we’ll tell you if there’s an exception. Similarly, for a home game, if you\
  \ read the baseline and want to add or remove restrictions (or scrap it entirely!)\
  \ you now know that you should talk to the rest of your group first. Lack of communication\
  \ often arises when everyone has their own baselines and assumes everyone shares\
  \ theirs.</p> \n     <p>But you want some hard rules, right? We have rules for encounters,\
  \ exploration, and downtime, as well as rules for all sorts of environmental effects,\
  \ natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, and hazards like haunts and traps.\
  \ For a quick taste of these before we move on, take a look at these temperature\
  \ effects. Unlike First Edition, they aren’t based on the legacy Pacific Northwest\
  \ sensibilities where a day of summer back home on the East Coast would kill me\
  \ from nonlethal damage!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n      <img src=\"\

  > \n     </div> \n     <p>For our in-depth look, let’s start with guidelines for\
  \ skill DCs! You might’ve seen the simple DCs before from Jason’s spoilers, but\
  \ we have those, as well as a level by level DC table for tasks against something\
  \ of that level, which you can adjust by 2, 5, or 10 if it’s particularly easy or\
  \ hard. For instance, learning a 6th level spell or identifying level 11 monster\
  \ is DC 28, but uncommon spells or monsters are DC 30, and rare spells or monsters\
  \ are DC 33. You’ll also notice these DCs are much easier to make than before, thanks\
  \ to playtest guidance through a series of other numbers, we’ve alighted on a strong\
  \ set that can help show off how amazing your PCs are!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ note: I’m most of the way through book five of the War for the Crown Adventure\
  \ Path, which I’m running in Second Edition. GMing it has been a joy; preparing\
  \ and running have been much easier than when I ran Jade Regent or Rise of the Runelords\
  \ in First Edition, even including the effort of converting the adventure. Other\
  \ Paizo community members running in the playtest have noted this as well, including\
  \ community member Ediwir, who is running War for the Crown in both First Edition\
  \ and the playtest at the same time to compare. If you’ve ever wanted to GM Pathfinder\
  \ before but it just looked daunting, Second Edition is the perfect time to give\
  \ it a shot! You’ll have all these tools at your fingertips to make life easier,\
  \ and everyone’s starting out too, so there will be tons of community support and\
  \ goodwill, as well as more than a little patience for mistakes. I hope you’ll join\
  \ me and give running a game a shot. If you do, what are you most excited to run\
  \ first? The Age of Ashes Adventure Path? <i>The Fall of Plaguestone?</i> Pathfinder\
  \ Society adventures? Something special you’re brewing up at home? Let me know in\
