  artist: "all devotees of the draftsman’s pencil. The heavy black lines, representing\
    \ the cartographer’s stern intent. The green district borders and blue lines demarking\
    \ the edges of the ship graveyard, attempts to inject a moment of life and joy\
    \ into his work. The labels in red, representing the very blood he spilled to\
    \ bring this map to completion. You can almost imagine him pausing, pen in hand,\
    \ to wipe the sweat"
