  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>In</i> <a href=\"/products/btpy9ckc\">Lord\
  \ of Runes</a>, <i>when Count Varian Jeggare is bequeathed a dangerous magical book\
  \ by an old colleague, he and his hellspawn bodyguard Radovan find themselves on\
  \ the trail of a necromancer bent on becoming the new avatar of an ancient and sinister\
  \ demigod—one of the legendary runelords. Along with a team of mercenaries and adventurers,\
  \ the infamous investigators will need to delve into a secret world of dark magic\
  \ and the legacy of a lost empire. But in saving the world, will Varian and Radovan\
  \ lose their souls?</i></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter One: The Acadamae</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Radovan had placed seven pebbles on the sundial between the shadow and\
  \ the next hour. As darkness covered the next tiny stone, he flicked it away. It\
  \ skittered across the plaza, narrowly missing the toes of a woman hurrying east.\
  \ By her well-made dress of common cloth, the basket trailing a few errant threads,\
  \ and the distinctive callus on her finger, I took her for a seamstress. She frowned\
  \ at Radovan. He offered her a wink and the smirk he refers to as \"the little smile.\"\
  \ She turned away an instant too late to conceal her own smile.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  A servant will bring me the keys at any moment,\" I said. \"Go.\"</p> \n     <p>Radovan\
  \ stretched, pointing his wicked elbow spurs at the sky. His red leather jacket\
  \ hung loose on his broad shoulders. The tongue of his belt lolled out from the\
  \ tighter cinch. In the months it had taken us to reach Korvosa, I estimated he\
  \ had lost seventeen pounds. He nodded toward the gate. \"I don't like the way those\
  \ guys are looking at you.\"</p> \n     <p>I turned to see a trio of students emerging\
  \ from the Acadamae, the girls laughing at the boy's quip. I could only presume\
  \ that Radovan referred to the hellspawn guarding the gate. The devil-blooded sentries\
  \ were notorious throughout Korvosa for abusing students and visitors alike.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>One of the guards snarled as the students emerged. \"What's so damned\
  \ funny?\" </p> \n     <p>Unlike Radovan, who boasted he could pass in dim light\
  \ so long as he avoided the \"big smile,\" these hellspawn would never be mistaken\
  \ for human. One had vestigial gills and an eel's snout; the other could barely\
  \ see out from beneath a pair of coiling horns.</p> \n     <p>The students lowered\
  \ their heads and hastened past. The horned hellspawn whistled after them. The other\
  \ turned toward me. His piscine eyes lingered on the sword on my hip and the Ustalavic\
  \ wolfhound at my heel. He weighed the danger and looked away.</p> \n     <p>Suppressing\
  \ a smug smile, I turned to Radovan. \"As you can see, 'those guys' know better\
  \ than to menace a count of Cheliax.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Not those guys,\" said Radovan.\
  \ He plucked another pebble from the sundial and made a catapult of his thumb and\
  \ middle finger. He aimed at the top of the gate. \"Those guys.\"</p> \n     <p>A\
  \ spotted raven, a chimera cat, and a potbellied imp peered down at us.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Radovan, it would be prudent not to—\"</p> \n     <p>Radovan flicked the\
  \ stone. The half-black, half-orange cat shrieked and fled along the wall. The raven\
  \ flew into the safety of the Acadamae grounds, but the devil flew toward us, cursing\
  \ in the guttural tongue of Hell. It demonstrated an impressive vocabulary and a\
  \ flair for simile.</p> \n     <p>\"That cat might have been a professor's familiar,\"\
  \ I said. I drew the Shadowless Sword and plucked a riffle scroll from my pocket.\
  \ \"Or, worse, a master's.\"</p> \n     <p>Radovan shrugged, but I saw by his posture\
  \ he was prepared to produce a razor-sharp throwing dart or star from one of the\
  \ many secret pockets in his jacket sleeves. \"I was aiming for the imp.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Hovering just beyond reach of my blade, the devil hissed, revealing a mouth\
  \ full of needle-sharp fangs. Radovan hissed back through his big smile, revealing\
  \ a jumble of teeth a Mendevian general once compared to a demon's armory.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The imp peeped and flew after its cohorts.</p> \n     <p>Radovan popped\
  \ his jaw back into joint. He turned to see where the seamstress had gone.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Go.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You don't mind if I take the night?\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Look for me at Upslope House tomorrow. I will return there after I finish\
  \ cataloging Ygresta's library.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You got too many books already.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"One can never have too many books. Still, I doubt I shall find\
  \ any worth keeping. Just strive to remain inconspicuous. Stay out of Thief Camp\
  \ and Old Korvosa.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Old Korvosa, huh?\"</p> \n     <p>I should\
  \ have known better than to present Radovan with a forbiddance. By naming the two\
  \ districts I most wished him to avoid, I practically ensured he would visit them.\
  \ \"The important thing is to avoid Chelish attention. The moment I receive the\
  \ queen's summons, I am duty-bound to return home.\"</p> \n     <p>Thanks to warnings\
  \ from military friends in Sarkoris, I had thus far avoided the heralds of Her Infernal\
  \ Majestrix. I knew what message they must carry: Queen Abrogail would demand to\
  \ know why I sent her a copy of the <i>Lexicon of Paradox</i> rather than the original.\
  \ I had prepared several excuses, but none would withstand a rigorous interrogation\
  \ by the inquisitors of Asmodeus. How could I admit that I trusted the crusader\
  \ queen of Mendev to use the book for the good of all Avistan? How could I conceal\
  \ my fervent belief that the queen of Cheliax would use it only to further her own\
  \ power? One sharp question was all it would take to condemn me to impalement upon\
  \ the tines.</p> \n     <p>Self-preservation was not my only motive for remaining\
  \ abroad. What began as a self-imposed exile to escape scandal had become an adventure.\
  \ Radovan and I had faced many horrors, and wonders too. Some came not from the\
  \ fabled lands we visited but from within ourselves. One of the wonders—or horrors—\
  within myself remained an unsolved mystery. </p> \n     <p>And I hoped to find the\
  \ answer to that mystery soon, here at the Acadamae in Korvosa. Yet as Queen Abrogail's\
  \ impatience grew, it was only a matter of time before she instructed one of her\
  \ sorcerers to contact me with a spell. There were ways to avoid such communication,\
  \ but none I could safely explain to her inquisitors. When I received the summons,\
  \ by writ or dream, I would answer.</p> \n     <p>\"You'd think she'd cut you some\
  \ slack now the war's over,\" Radovan said.</p> \n     <p>Despite the sun warming\
  \ my shoulders, I felt a gloom. \"The war is never over.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Come\
  \ on, boss, lighten up. Take a picnic over to Jeggare Island. Go for a stroll around\
  \ Jeggare Square. There's a Jeggare Museum, isn't there? You like museums. You like\
  \ stuff named after you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"How many times must I tell you—?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Yeah, I know. They named those places for your uncle Monte.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"<i>Montlarion</i> Jeggare the explorer, one of the esteemed founders\
  \ of Korvosa, my accomplished great-great—\"</p> \n     <p>Arnisant pricked up his\
  \ ears at the sound of irritation in my voice. I patted his shoulder. A sly smile\
  \ grew at the corner of Radovan's mouth. He was trying to be amusing. As usual,\
  \ he succeeded more at being trying than at being amusing.</p> \n     <p>\"I just\
  \ wish you could relax is all,\" he said. \"Ever since we hit town, you've been\
  \ tense.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Tense\" was too small a word for the vexation I felt\
  \ since meeting with Toff Ornelos. What I sought from the headmaster was an explanation\
  \ of why the Acadamae had failed to detect my magical bloodline, which I had discovered\
  \ only recently. For reasons of their own, the proctors allowed me to engage in\
  \ a futile struggle to master the science of wizardry when they should have turned\
  \ me away to develop my innate talents under the tutelage of a sorcerer.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Instead of answers, what the headmaster gave me was news that one of my\
  \ oldest friends had died having named me executor of his meager estate. Headmaster\
  \ Ornelos would hear none of my complaints until I had dispensed with what he deemed\
  \ the more urgent matter.</p> \n     <p>Yet none of that was Radovan's fault. I\
  \ looked him in the eye and said, \"There is a park.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Huh?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Jeggare Green. It is a modest size, but Queen Domina dedicated it\
  \ to me, not my ancestor.\"</p> \n     <p>\"'Jeggare Green,'\" Radovan mused. \"\
  I'll look for it. If you're all right, then I'm going to—\" He jerked a thumb over\
  \ his shoulder in the direction of the vanished seamstress.</p> \n     <p>\"Go!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Radovan departed at a jog.</p> \n     <p>I turned back to the hellspawn\
  \ gatekeepers. They glowered but kept their tongues still. I wondered whether their\
  \ caution had more to do with my sword or my hound. The Shadowless Sword was swift\
  \ and Arnisant fearless, but the guards had more to fear from my spells—both those\
  \ inscribed on the riffle scrolls concealed throughout my coat and those I could\
  \ summon by force of will, now that I understood that I was a sorcerer rather than\
  \ a wizard.</p> \n     <p>The guards turned at the approach of another student from\
  \ inside the Acadamae grounds. Rather than taunt the woman, they bowed as she passed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The hem of her skirt swirled about her ankles as she strode toward me\
  \ with swift grace. Upon each hand she wore a jeweled ring, and around her throat\
  \ a cameo on a black ribbon. Across her hips hung a plaited belt holding a pair\
  \ of holstered wands and a tooled-leather pouch, to which she had pinned the silver\
  \ Acadamae badge that granted her access to the campus. To my surprise, I could\
  \ not estimate her age more precisely than mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Ordinarily\
  \ I could make a guess accurate to within two years.</p> \n     <p>On impulse, I\
  \ uttered a brief cantrip. The spell indicated powerful magic on the woman's cameo,\
  \ rings, pouch, and wands, but none on the woman herself. </p> \n     <p> \"Count\
  \ Varian Jeggare.\" Her eyes registered surprise as she drew near. \"Why, you look\
  \ entirely rejuvenated, if a bit underfed. You must come to my father's house and\
  \ let us give you supper.\"</p> \n     <p>Unable to recall her name, I bowed and\
  \ fell back on a banal courtesy: \"You are as lovely as ever, my lady.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Her lips quirked—with pleasure or amusement, I could not tell. My inability\
  \ to read her expression irked me.</p> \n     <p>My gaze slipped from the woman's\
  \ deep purple eyes to the cameo at her throat. Carved into the stone was an exquisite\
  \ death's head moth, its wings dappled in tawny shades fading to ivory. </p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Did I see you cast a spell as I approached?\" she said.</p> \n     <p>It\
  \ was bad form to cast a spell on a fellow noble. \"A minor divination, lady, nothing\
  \ to violate your person. Forgive me. I must strive to shed my wartime habits.\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"No apology necessary. We are all grateful to those who held back\
  \ the Worldwound demons. Besides, no one can cross the campus without being subjected\
  \ to a few divinations, if not a transmutation when the upperclassmen feel prankish.\
  \ I just didn't think you could do that.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Do what?\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Cast a spell.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ah.\" My disability was not a well-kept\
  \ secret, but few were bold enough to mention it to my face. </p> \n     <p>With\
  \ a gesture for me to follow, the woman led me through the gates. As we strolled\
  \ along the gravel path, Arnisant snuffled at her shadow and growled. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Arnisant, heel!\" The hound returned to my side, his gaze locked on the\
  \ lady's feet. \"I beg your pardon. He is usually better behaved. Perhaps he too\
  \ must shake off the rude habits of war.\"</p> \n     <p>The woman lifted her skirt\
  \ a few inches and examined the soles of her boots. They were of a fashion popular\
  \ decades earlier, one that I found uncommonly fetching. \"Perhaps I stepped in\
  \ something as I passed the conjurers.\" She appraised Arnisant, who remained calm.\
  \ \"May I pet him?\"</p> \n     <p>She showed no fear, so I nodded.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ hound remained still as a statue as she stroked the curly gray fur on his head.\
  \ \"What a handsome fellow. And what a fine name for him.\"</p> \n     <p>Since\
  \ I was in Ustalav when I found Arnisant, I named him for the famous general who\
  \ martyred himself to defeat the Whispering Tyrant. \"My grandfather always said,\
  \ 'Give a dog a good name.'\"</p> \n     <p>\"Because others will think you a brute\
  \ if you call him 'Fang'?\"</p> \n     <p>\"For that reason too, but also as a practical\
  \ blessing. When you give a dog a brutal name, your tone grooms him to become a\
  \ brutal animal each time you call to him. But a dog hears respect as well as scorn.\
  \ Call him by a hero's name, and he may become a hero himself.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  In that case, Arnisant must be ready to give his life for you.\"</p> \n     <p>That\
  \ notion troubled me more than it ought, for I had grown fonder of Arnisant than\
  \ of any other dog I had raised.</p> \n     <p>We continued our walk across campus.\
  \ Plots of ornamental foliage provided a Chelish order to the grassy swards between\
  \ the academic buildings. The spring flowers perfumed the grounds. A bell from the\
  \ Hall of Summoning tolled the hour. Moments later, students spilled out to enjoy\
  \ a few minutes outside before their next classes began.</p> \n     <p>\"They look\
  \ so young, don't they?\" said the woman beside me. Her smile should have seemed\
  \ familiar, yet it did not. Still I could not place a name with her face.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In my memory library, the mental construct I have nurtured for nearly a\
  \ century, I perused the gallery of every Korvosan aristocrat I had ever met. The\
  \ woman's black hair and purple eyes suggested she shared my mother's Azlanti heritage,\
  \ the rarest of bloodlines. She bore none of the other Jeggare features, which my\
  \ father's elven blood muted in me. </p> \n     <p>I nodded agreement and smiled\
  \ before looking away, pretending to take in the scenery while wracking my memory\
  \ for her identity. As we passed the statue of Acadamae founder Volshyenek Ornelos,\
  \ I found a clue in his countenance.</p> \n     <p>I last met unfamiliar members\
  \ of House Ornelos at the funeral of Fedele Ornelos, one of the finest men I ever\
  \ had the privilege to call friend. After the memorials, I remained in Korvosa to\
  \ attend to business. In the evenings I renewed old acquaintances and established\
  \ new ones. Among the new were young scions of the noble families, including House\
  \ Ornelos. Children seldom leave an impression on me, but I record their names and\
  \ ages in my memory library nevertheless.</p> \n     <p>My escort was surely one\
  \ of Fedele's nieces, making her the grandniece of Toff Ornelos and thus accounting\
  \ for the deference the hellspawn guards showed her. No doubt the headmaster had\
  \ sent his grandniece to keep me and my hundred questions out of his office. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Arnisant woofed as a raven swooped near. Once more I drew the Shadowless\
  \ Sword from its scabbard, but not to strike. In addition to its swiftness, the\
  \ blade revealed the truth beneath any illusion. It revealed the raven's true form\
  \ as that of another imp. </p> \n     <p>\"Don't let them frighten you,\" said the\
  \ woman. \"The familiars are worse bullies than the guards. Professor Ygresta had\
  \ the right idea. Each term he would destroy one as an example to the others. They\
  \ never harried him as they do some of the timid professors.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ Shadowless Sword revealed no illusion on the woman. I put away my blade. \"Was\
  \ he not concerned he would kill a colleague's familiar?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, no,\"\
  \ she said. \"He always summoned the imp himself.\"</p> \n     <p>Her anecdote brought\
  \ a nostalgic smile to my lips.</p> \n     <p>\"So it's true he learned that custom\
  \ from you?\" she said.</p> \n     <p>\"Not the idea of a warning demonstration,\
  \ but I might have provided the inspiration.\" Even before the rise of House Thrune,\
  \ summoning a devil was a mandatory exercise at the Acadamae. There was no requirement\
  \ to keep the fiend as a familiar, however, nor to let it free to torment the citizens\
  \ of Korvosa, as so many reckless students do. Though the convulsions I suffered\
  \ while casting the spell were agonizing, I gladly suffered them again to destroy\
  \ the fiend after the proctors recorded my success. One less devil in Korvosa. One\
  \ less inch of the world surrendered to Asmodeus.</p> \n     <p>As we passed the\
  \ Hall of Whispers, a stench of boiling urine from the necromantic laboratories\
  \ wet my eyes. I plucked a scented handkerchief from my sleeve and offered it to\
  \ the lady. </p> \n     <p>She waved it away. \"After four years among the cauldrons,\
  \ I became quite immune to the stench.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ah.\" The significance\
  \ of the moth on her cameo struck me. \"You specialized in necromancy.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Your favorite subject.\" Her tone indicated that she knew of my disdain\
  \ for her specialty. </p> \n     <p>\"Ah.\"</p> \n     <p>\"<i>Ah</i>.\" She softened\
  \ her mimicry with a smile. \"Uncle Toff warned me that you despise necromancers,\
  \ but I know that can't be universally true. After all, Professor Ygresta was your\
  \ friend.\"</p> \n     <p>Despite our social disparity, Benigno Ygresta had been\
  \ a friend of a sort. In fact, he had been perhaps my oldest living friend, although\
  \ I had seldom seen him in the seven decades since we left the Acadamae. I decided\
  \ not to mention that we first met when I hired the lowborn Ygresta as my bottle-washer,\
  \ a menial job he gladly accepted to supplement his paltry income.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  You studied with Ygresta?\" I asked.</p> \n     <p>\"He was the one who persuaded\
  \ me to join the Hall of Whispers. I'd always thought only ghouls and grave robbers\
  \ would study the art, but he caught my attention by demonstrating the best spell\
  \ I had ever seen. Eventually, his lectures on the ethical applications of necromancy\
  \ won me over. His life-matter theory alone should have earned him distinction,\
  \ if only he could have won over the masters.\"</p> \n     <p>I nodded sadly, remembering\
  \ one of Benigno Ygresta's many shortcomings: he had little talent for the subtle\
  \ politics of wizards, especially the more conservative masters of the Acadamae.\
  \ \"Ygresta always struggled to express his fancies as proofs the traditional necromancers\
  \ could embrace.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm more than half certain they were more than\
  \ fancies,\" she said. \"But you're right: He could never satisfy the masters that\
  \ they were more than eccentric ideas. Everyone always thought it was another part\
  \ of his hopeless quest to improve the Acadamae's reputation.\"</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ was familiar with Ygresta's arguments that necromancy was not inherently evil.\
  \ His points were cogent enough, sometimes even compelling. Yet even if I could\
  \ overcome my disdain for the ghouls and grave robbers, as my enigmatic companion\
  \ described her colleagues, I would never break a promise to my mother.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"The professor once told me that you could have been one of the best necromancers\
  \ at the Acadamae, if only you'd chosen to pursue our specialty.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Arcane theory was my best subject.\" It was in practice that I had failed, not in\
  \ principle. Even through the long decades when I barely dared to cast a meager\
  \ cantrip, my knowledge of the arcane served me well. </p> \n     <p>\"Let me guess:\
  \ you studied evocation.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\
  //static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8527-Varian.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8527-Varian_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \      <br><i>There's nothing Varian loves more than a good book—except maybe an\
  \ evil one.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>\"Did the headmaster tell you that?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"No one told me anything.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Why do you guess evocation?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Am I wrong?\"</p> \n     <p>\"No,\" I admitted. Not only had I\
  \ failed to read her expressions, but she seemed singularly capable of reading me.\
  \ \"But I still want to know why you guessed it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You strike me\
  \ as the fire-and-lightning type.\"</p> \n     <p>Much as I despise being categorized,\
  \ I held my tongue. One does not wish to seem defensive. </p> \n     <p>She continued\
  \ leading the way to Ygresta's rooms. I continued to worry at the knot of her identity.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Realizing she was Toff Ornelos's grandniece narrowed the possibilities.\
  \ When I had met them, the girls had ranged from ages six to fifteen. This woman\
  \ was surely not Nicoletta, who married an ambassador to Sargava and likely resided\
  \ there still. I did not think she was Letizia, whose constant yawning was her singular\
  \ attribute. Of the others I remembered only names and relative ages. The youngest\
  \ was Ambra, and her sisters were Filomena, whom Shelyn had blessed with exceptional\
  \ beauty, and Illyria, whom the goddess had overlooked.</p> \n     <p>With that\
  \ thought, I knew the answer.</p> \n     <p>By virtue of my half-elven longevity,\
  \ I had seen generations of human children grow to adulthood. Lady Illyria was not\
  \ the first ugly duckling to become a swan, but hers was the most pronounced transformation\
  \ I had witnessed. The nose that seemed thin in childhood had grown regal, the fey\
  \ cheekbones elegant. As a girl, she had barely spoken to me, yet I could now envision\
  \ her watching the adults in silence while her sisters chattered among themselves.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Past the Hall of Whispers, we came to a row of faculty cottages. At\
  \ the farthest, she climbed three steps up onto the landing and unlocked the door.\
  \ Turning with a flourish, she offered me the key. </p> \n     <p>Also with a flourish,\
  \ I held the door for her. \"After you, Lady Illyria.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ah!\" she\
  \ said, still mimicking me. She straightened a pin holding her hair in a display\
  \ of purple-frosted roses. \"I knew my name would come to you eventually.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I recalled that Illyria's mother lived in Westcrown while her father—\
  Fedele's sickly brother, nephew to Headmaster Toff Ornelos—kept a home in Korvosa.\
  \ \"How is your father's health?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I am making sure he eats properly\
  \ before I sail to Riddleport next month.\"</p> \n     <p>\"To Riddleport?\" The\
  \ city was more popular with pirates than with gentlewomen.</p> \n     <p>\"Some\
  \ friends are throwing an eclipse party beneath the Cyphergate.\"</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ resisted the impulse to correct her use of the term. The phenomenon is more accurately\
  \ an occultation of the sun, not an eclipse. Yet one does not wish to seem pedantic.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Inside, the cottage appeared largely undisturbed since Ygresta's death.\
  \ Someone had stripped the sheets from the sagging mattress in the bedroom. We shooed\
  \ flies from unwashed dishes in the kitchen but were relieved to discover the pantry\
  \ had been cleared. A film of dust had accumulated on the furniture.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The sitting room featured a pair of overstuffed chairs beside the hearth. A\
  \ deep depression in one seat indicated Ygresta's favorite. On the wall behind it\
  \ hung a portrait of the man. His tall figure was much as I remembered, if withered.\
  \ It had been decades since we last met, so I had never seen Ygresta's thinning\
  \ gray hair, his round spectacles, or his sunken cheeks. Recognizing the portrait\
  \ as the work of a painter who had died twenty years ago, I wondered how much more\
  \ time had ravaged Ygresta before death. Considering he was the same age as I, and\
  \ wholly human, he had enjoyed an exceptional life span.</p> \n     <p>\"They say\
  \ he slipped away in his sleep,\" Lady Illyria said. Sorrow tinged her voice.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Then the Tender of Dreams kissed his face.\" I sketched the wings\
  \ of Desna over my heart.</p> \n     <p>Illyria drew the spiral of Pharasma over\
  \ hers. How strange, I thought, for a necromancer to invoke the Lady of Graves,\
  \ whose priests abhor the undead. No stranger to the paradoxes of character, I found\
  \ this anomaly deepened my curiosity about the woman. </p> \n     <p>After a moment,\
  \ we broke our separate reveries.</p> \n     <p>\"The library?\" I asked.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Between the dungeon and the torture chamber,\" she said, her voice sinister\
  \ yet whimsical.</p> \n     <p>We descended a spiraling iron staircase. Magical\
  \ flames sprang up in glass fixtures, casting our shadows behind the bars of the\
  \ railings. Arnisant followed us down to the wooden floor and sniffed the corners\
  \ of the room. Again he growled.</p> \n     <p>\"Arnisant!\" He came to heel. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lady Illyria sniffed. \"I can't blame him. This place is full of weird\
  \ stinks.\"</p> \n     <p>That was so. The library smelled more like an alchemist's\
  \ laboratory. Shelves lined the walls, except where they parted for a fireplace\
  \ and two doors. One door stood open, revealing a cluttered storeroom. Judging from\
  \ the odor, the closed door concealed a privy.</p> \n     <p>Librams, chapbooks,\
  \ scrolls, folios, and loose manuscripts crammed the shelves. The collection was\
  \ smaller than expected. At a glance, I estimated I could complete the inventory\
  \ within a day. The sooner the cottage became available for another tenant, the\
  \ better pleased the headmaster would be. Pleased enough to answer my inquiries,\
  \ I hoped.</p> \n     <p>Knickknacks interrupted the ranks of books. Apart from\
  \ a devil's skull and a brass candelabrum resembling a hand of glory, I spied few\
  \ tokens of necromancy. Between the shelves stood a pair of tables. One lay empty,\
  \ one stacked with crates overflowing with packing straw. A ledger, brush, and paste-pot\
  \ lay beside a stack of blank labels, as the custodians had promised.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Ygresta's desk stood across from the tables, before the little fireplace.\
  \ Beside it hung a birdcage, empty but for a dry water dish and a carpet of hardened\
  \ fecal matter. At my approach, a brass lamp flared to life, spilling light on the\
  \ desktop. </p> \n     <p>There in the center of the desk, upon a discolored paper\
  \ blotter, rested a teak box beneath a calling card inscribed with my name. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Without disturbing the card, I scanned the box for magic. Detecting\
  \ none, I scanned the room. The lamp above the desk and the lights on the stair\
  \ radiated steady magic. On a few of the shelved books I discerned traces of metamorphosis\
  \ spells. The latter were likely the residue of simple preservative spells, but\
  \ their presence suggested more valuable tomes. Those I set aside for further study.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"The professor left his entire library to you?\" said Illyria.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"His will names me his executor but indicates no beneficiaries, so\
  \ in effect he did. After gathering the collection into lots, I will circulate an\
  \ inventory to the Acadamae librarians and entertain their requests.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"You won't keep it for yourself? I thought you liked books.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Perhaps one or two volumes.\" My library surely already contained any interesting\
  \ volumes I might find here, but I did not say so. One does not wish to boast. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"In that case, may I be the first to lodge a request?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"On behalf of the Hall of Whispers?\" </p> \n     <p>\"On behalf of myself.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>So, I thought, Illyria was not merely smoothing over her uncle's\
  \ sour greeting. She had her own agenda as well. \"Name it.\"</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ indicated a shelf of chapbooks. \"Professor Ygresta's collection of the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles</i>.\"</p> \n     <p>My own collection was the most comprehensive I\
  \ had ever seen. It included volumes dating from the very founding of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society, with many annotated duplicates. In the unlikely event I should find one\
  \ I lacked on Ygresta's meager shelf, I would claim it. But I saw no harm in giving\
  \ Illyria the rest. \"Is that all?\"</p> \n     <p>She averted her eyes. \"If you\
  \ aren't taking them, perhaps also your letters?\"</p> \n     <p>\"My letters?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Please.\"</p> \n     <p>Her blush appeared genuine, but a sincere\
  \ appearance is the goal of every ruse. \"My letters to Professor Ygresta?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Exactly.\" She withdrew a pasteboard box from a shelf and lay it before\
  \ me. I opened the drawer and saw it was full of letters, all addressed to Professor\
  \ Benigno Ygresta in my handwriting.</p> \n     <p>Out of a sense of collegial obligation,\
  \ I had always responded to his letters about current affairs at the Acadamae with\
  \ some account of my latest excursion. The letters contained nothing not also reported\
  \ to the Society. Naturally, I never mentioned military, political, or personal\
  \ matters to someone beneath the aristocracy. I could not fathom what interest they\
  \ might hold for Lady Illyria.</p> \n     <p>The foremost letter was my most recent\
  \ message, a request for Ygresta to speak on my behalf to Headmaster Toff Ornelos,\
  \ for whom I had so many questions about my admission and education at the Acadamae.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I'm sorry.\" Lady Illyria winced. \"I knew it was too much to ask.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>For a moment I considered whether she was flirting with me. Long\
  \ before I reached the age of maturity, my mother armored me against the attentions\
  \ of women attracted more to my wealth than to myself. Yet Illyria did not strike\
  \ me as the type. An Acadamae graduate would be far too intelligent to expect me\
  \ to succumb to such manipulation. </p> \n     <p>Whatever her agenda, I could think\
  \ of no harm that could come from giving her the letters. Moreover, a favor to her\
  \ was a favor to the headmaster. I still required answers to my questions.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"You will understand that I must review the letters before deciding.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>She brightened. \"Naturally.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Then let us revisit\
  \ the matter after I have finished cataloging the library.\"</p> \n     <p>She rubbed\
  \ her palms together. \"In that case, let me help.\"</p> \n     <p>Before I could\
  \ protest, she drew a wooden disk from her pouch. She wound a string around a slot\
  \ in its circumference and flicked the disk away. As she uttered the spell, the\
  \ whirling disk reached the end of the string and vanished. In its place, a whirlwind\
  \ stirred the loose pages on the nearest shelves.</p> \n     <p>\"Start in there.\"\
  \ She directed her invisible servant toward the storeroom. \"Dust every surface,\
  \ but move nothing.\"</p> \n     <p>While I appreciated her careful instructions,\
  \ I preferred to discharge my duty in solitude. \"Lady Illyria, I assure you I require\
  \ no assistance.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You'll choke to death on these cobwebs before\
  \ we can have you to dinner.\" She fanned away the cloud already emerging from the\
  \ storeroom. \"There must be a window in one of these rooms.\"</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ cast a light on the palm of her hand and entered the storeroom. </p> \n     <p>With\
  \ a resigned sigh, I sat before Ygresta's desk. The chair felt too large, but so\
  \ did my coat. Radovan was not the only one who had lost weight during our journey.\
  \ Arnisant sat at my foot, sniffing to confirm I had no food to share. I admonished\
  \ him with a look, and he laid his head on his crossed paws, the guilty beggar.\
  \ During the worst of our privations on our journey from the Worldwound, I had succumbed\
  \ to pity and secretly fed the hound a portion of my ration. He learned to linger\
  \ whenever I ate. Now I had to be strict with him lest he learn to beg whenever\
  \ I sat before a table.</p> \n     <p>The box on Ygresta's desk appeared to be of\
  \ recent construction, no more than a year or so old. The golden teak was of a type\
  \ commonly imported to Varisia from eastern Garund, but in the carving I spied the\
  \ iconography of ancient Thassilon. </p> \n     <p>I lifted the card bearing my\
  \ name. Engraved on the box's lid was the sihedron, a star with each of its seven\
  \ points notched like one of Radovan's throwing blades. I had seen the symbol etched\
  \ on artifacts recovered from the demesnes of the long-lost runelords and their\
  \ predecessor, the great King Xin, Emperor of Thassilon.</p> \n     <p>Illyria emerged\
  \ from the storeroom with a bottle of wine. \"Was 4690 a good year?\" She presented\
  \ the bottle like a sommelier. </p> \n     <p>The label had begun curling at the\
  \ edges. The bottle was from one of my best vineyards, but an early frost had bruised\
  \ the grapes that year. \"That vintage has not aged as well as others.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"There's plenty more where that came from. What's a good year?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Is there any '84?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I see bottles dated back to the Age\
  \ of Enthronement. You could open a shop with all of these.\"</p> \n     <p>Since\
  \ I left Korvosa upon my graduation from the Acadamae, it had become my custom to\
  \ send a gift of each year's wine to friends and associates in the city. Benigno\
  \ received only one bottle annually, so I was surprised so much remained. \"Did\
  \ Ygresta stop drinking wine?\"</p> \n     <p>\"We didn't exactly run in the same\
  \ social circles.\"</p> \n     <p>\"No, of course not.\" Despite his academic accomplishments,\
  \ modest though they were, Benigno Ygresta remained a vintner's son.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"What have you found there, a sihedron?\" Illyria sat on the corner of the\
  \ desk and peered at the box. \"You see all sorts of adventurers with those lately.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Do you?\"</p> \n     <p>She nodded. \"Fortune-hunters have been\
  \ dredging up Thassilonian artifacts all across Varisia. So many Pathfinders have\
  \ been exploring the region that they opened a new lodge in Magnimar. Oh, but of\
  \ course as a venture-captain you already knew that.\"</p> \n     <p>In fact, I\
  \ did not know of a new lodge, but I had no desire to discuss my estrangement from\
  \ the Society and its ten anonymous leaders whose motives I no longer trusted.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I opened the box. Inside I found a thick stack of unmarked parchment.\
  \ The pages fit perfectly inside the box's velvet lining, suggesting the container\
  \ had been made to size. I retrieved a magnifying glass and a pair of clean white\
  \ gloves from the satchel. A cursory inspection offered no clue as to the parchment's\
  \ age or origin. Even with the aid of my glass, I could not identify what animal's\
  \ skin constituted the material. Removing the parchment, I felt its substantial\
  \ weight. Its outermost pages, only slightly thicker than the rest, formed its only\
  \ binding.</p> \n     <p>\"It's a book,\" said Illyria. \"A codex, to be precise.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>The study of ancient manuscripts remained one of my abiding interests,\
  \ so I appreciated her specificity. \"You must have earned full marks in Paleography.\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"One of my best subjects.\" She made no attempt to disguise her\
  \ pride.</p> \n     <p>I flipped through the pages. The interior was as blank as\
  \ the covers. </p> \n     <p>\"A gift of stationery?\" said Illyria. \"The professor\
  \ often said how much he enjoyed reading accounts of your travels. Maybe he intended\
  \ you to use it as your next journal.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Perhaps. But if it was a\
  \ gift, why not send it to me?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Maybe he wanted to give it to you\
  \ in person.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Then why leave a calling card with my name upon it?\
  \ Except for a recent message I sent him, we had not corresponded in several years.\
  \ He never told me I was to execute his will. He left me no instructions.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She picked up the calling card I had set aside. \"Perhaps he had just\
  \ begun making arrangements.\"</p> \n     <p>That was as reasonable a suggestion\
  \ as any, but it hardly satisfied the questions of the carved box and the blank\
  \ pages. Setting aside the box, I began to lay down the codex but paused when I\
  \ noticed the stains on the blotter. Among the usual ink spots and food stains lay\
  \ a dark spatter surrounding a rectangular void.</p> \n     <p>\"Let me tear that\
  \ away for you.\" Lady Illyria reached for the blotter page.</p> \n     <p>\"No,\
  \ leave it.\" I laid the codex in the blank space within the spatter. Its corners\
  \ fit one side of the blank. I opened the pages to lie flat, and it fit perfectly\
  \ within the unblemished space.</p> \n     <p>\"He must have spilled wine,\" said\
  \ Lady Illyria. \"Later he cleaned the pages with a spell.\"</p> \n     <p>That\
  \ was possible, but I did not like the color. I rubbed a gloved finger across the\
  \ stain. Faint granular residue remained on the white cloth. \"Not wine. Blood.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"How interesting.\"</p> \n     <p>I raised an eyebrow.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>She wrinkled her nose. \"I mean, how gruesome.\"</p> \n     <p>The stain\
  \ was beyond interesting. Ygresta had left me far more than a codex of blank pages.\
  \ He had left me that which I love best: a mystery.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n \
