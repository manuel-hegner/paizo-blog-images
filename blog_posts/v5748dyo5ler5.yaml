  \ itemprop=\"description\">In the forthcoming Pathfinder Campaign Setting book,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8xeb\"><i>Fey Revisited</i></a>, we examine ten classic\
  \ fey creatures in the context of how they function and fit into the world of Golarion.\
  \ Each article presents details on the ecology of the creature (life-cycle, habitat,\
  \ and so forth), its aspect of nature, and a sample creature of the type as well\
  \ as a description of the sample's home. We also provide some background about each\
  \ fey creature's real-world mythological origins and the fairies' tokens.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>A fey token is an item, generally crafted by the fey giving it, that\
  \ can be provided to another creature as a sign of the fey's blessing or approval\
  \ for a short period of time. Each fey creature in the book has different conditions\
  \ upon which it grants its token, and each has a limited magical effect that generally\
  \ lasts about a day before its magic fades. As an example, here's the token granted\
  \ by the evil water fey known as nuckelavees.</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurb120\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9256-NuckelaveeToken.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9256-NuckelaveeToken_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> Illustration by Helge C. Balzer\n    </div> \n  \
  \  <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Token of the Nuckelavee</b><br> Nuckelavees are rarely\
  \ pleased by anything other than bloody vengeance, but occasionally they take a\
  \ liking to a mortal—usually one with some connection to nature—who has a reputation\
  \ for being a friend of the waters, perhaps by virtue of clearing a river of debris\
  \ or driving a coven of polluting hags from a shore. In such instances, the nuckelavee\
  \ bestows its token upon the do-gooder. The recipient awakens one day to find a\
  \ bracelet made of cold, gray skin that smells of brine and constantly drips water.\
  \ (Some say the nuckelavees craft these bracelets from strips of their own skin,\
  \ which is why they have none left to wear.) Upon donning the bracelet, for the\
  \ next 24 hours the recipient gains the ability to make contaminated water clean\
  \ enough to drink (as per the spell purify food and drink, but only for water).\
  \ However, the fey token has a cost. For the same duration, the water inside the\
  \ recipient's body becomes tainted, lowering his or her Constitution by 2. When\
  \ the token's power expires, there is a chance that the devil of the sea comes after\
  \ the recipient to reclaim the bracelet.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <br clear=\"\
  all\"> \n    <p>Ok, so maybe that's not the fey token most PCs would want, especially\
  \ given that last bit about the nuckelavee maybe coming for them. The rest of the\
  \ tokens presented in the book totally don't have hitches and gotchas like that,\
  \ though. I swear. Really. Why wouldn't you trust a fey creature not to try to trick\
  \ you?</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8xeb\"><i>Fey Revisited</i></a> is available\
