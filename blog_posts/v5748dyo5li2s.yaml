  \ itemprop=\"description\">It's Friday, which means it's time for your (mostly)\
  \ regularly scheduled preview of upcoming figures from the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> line of prepainted fantasy gaming figures. Up this week\
  \ are three early looks at digital sculpts for November's <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set. I should add here that while these are digital\
  \ sculpts, I've actually seen and approved all of the paint masters for this set,\
  \ and they look phenomenal. Because so many of our figures include stamped-on additional\
  \ details (called \"tampos\" in the lingo of the business), I don't tend to photograph\
  \ paint masters, even when I really want to. Once we begin to receive early production\
  \ samples, we'll shoot several of them and show them off here. But for now, we're\
  \ still looking at digitals.</p> \n    <p>I've showed off a lot of the set's common\
  \ and uncommon figures so far, so this week, in celebration of something special\
  \ (which I'll get to below), I want to pull back the curtain on some of the set's\
  \ rare figures. Our partners at WizKids always pack an amazing amount of paint and\
  \ sculpt details into the rare figures, and this set is no exception. Some of my\
  \ absolute favorites from the set are found at this rarity.</p> \n    <p>And so,\
  \ as my favorite television scientist might say: \"Awaaaaaaay we go!\"</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-Akkevrah.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-Akkevrah_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the imposing Allevrah, Elf General, looking splendid\
  \ in her green dragon skin armor. A few months back, as I was working on Pathfinder\
  \ Battles set lists, my boss and Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens came by and said \"Mona,\
  \ put some more elves in the line. We need more elves!\" I decided to fulfill that\
  \ request in the form of a few figures from <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><em>The\
  \ Lost Coast</em></a>, but I think Allevrah here is the coolest of the bunch. She\
  \ was, in a slightly different form (NO SPOILERS) a major NPC in the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/secondDarkness\">Second Darkness Adventure Path</a>, but\
  \ I think she works just as well as a major NPC ally or even a player character.\
  \ There's no denying that she looks ready to kick some serious ass. Allevrah, Elf\
  \ General is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-GoblinVulturePilot_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up next is the Goblin Vulture Pilot, from page 109 of\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Monster Codex</em></a> hardcover.\
  \ I love the way WizKids' sculptors perfectly captured this guy's facial expression,\
  \ and I can't wait to have him (literally) dive bomb my player characters. This\
  \ figure looks incredible in hand, and I'm delighted to get more mounted figures\
  \ into the line. Let me know if there are other mounted monsters and characters\
  \ you'd like to see, and I'll try to sneak them in somewhere! The Goblin Vulture\
  \ Pilot is a Medium figure at the rare rarity. (Ok, the goblin himself is Small,\
  \ but the vulture is Medium and on a Medium base.)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-Zilvazaraat_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up today is one of <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn's</em></a> stranger visitors, a multi-dimensional merchant\
  \ of arcane wares known as Zilvazaraat. The towering planar peddler first appeared\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy8vss\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #70: The Frozen\
  \ Stars</em></a>, and he was originally slated to appear as a miniature in the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"><em>Reign of Winter</em></a> set. That set (and a\
  \ few others at the same time) lost about 10 figures when we went from 55-figure\
  \ sets to 45-figure sets, and Zilvazaraat here has been waiting for his time to\
  \ strike ever since. I figured, hey, you never know who might stop by <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> for a bit of drink and some\
  \ back corner business, so he sauntered his way back into our lives. I think it's\
  \ fair to say that this creature has never been made before in prepainted plastic.\
  \ He's a little bit off-kilter, but he's got a gorgeous sculpt and I hope you like\
  \ him. Given that he appears anywhere to buy, sell, and trade magic items, your\
  \ players will probably love him. Zilvazaraat is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>With the previews behind us, I'd like to reveal some sad news to Pathfinder\
  \ Battles fans. Although I tend to get a fair amount of credit for the line in public\
  \ forums based on the regular appearance of this blog, the truth is that making\
  \ these sets as amazing as they can be is a team effort. Over the last few years,\
  \ I've been honored to include in that team Paizo's Licensing Coordinator, Mike\
  \ Kenway. Mike has been an absolute workhorse behind the scenes of Pathfinder Battles,\
  \ tracking down art, managing the approvals chain with WizKids, and making sure\
  \ that I don't fall too behind on planning set lists and other Pathfinder Battles\
  \ business.</p> \n    <p>We've got Mike to thank for the awesome <a href=\"/products/btpy9eo8\"\
  >Bone Golem</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>,\
  \ and numerous other figures he's championed over the years. A significant part\
  \ of the line's quality and success can be attributed directly to Mike's keen eye\
  \ for detail and excellent work ethic.</p> \n    <p>Unfortunately (at least for\
  \ us!), Mike has accepted a job with another company, who understands how good he\
  \ is at this type of thing, and what an asset he is to licensing coordination. Mike's\
  \ last day in the Paizo office is next Thursday, October 8th, and I wanted to be\
  \ sure to take this opportunity here in the Friday Publisher Preview to thank Mike\
  \ for his tireless efforts on behalf of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> fans. The line would not be what it is today without his hard work,\
  \ and we will miss him dearly.</p> \n    <p>That said, time (and minis production)\
  \ waits for no man, and the show must go on. We're currently looking for Mike's\
  \ replacement to join the Paizo staff as Licensing Coordinator. Since a major part\
  \ of the job involves helping me manage the Paizo side of Pathfinder Battles, I\
  \ thought I'd put <a href=\"/paizo/about/jobs\">a link to the job opening</a> here\
  \ in the blog, in case some of you miniatures stalwarts might consider a change\
  \ in career.</p> \n    <p>I could definitely use the help!</p> \n    <p>I'm off\
  \ to New York Comic Con next week, and will try to drop a preview from the road.\
  \ There's still so much awesome stuff in <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The\
  \ Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set that I can hardly believe it!</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ next time, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div>\
