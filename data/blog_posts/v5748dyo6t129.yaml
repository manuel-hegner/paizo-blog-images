  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>Despite my\
  \ apprehension at reading about the deaths of so many of Golarion’s gods and my\
  \ continuing belief that these </em>Godsrain Prophecies <em>cannot be taken at their\
  \ word, I still feel a bit wistful about reaching the end of my analysis. While\
  \ it is certainly possible that there are other prophecies in this vein, this is\
  \ the last that I will read before delivering the collection to my Lady. </em></p>\n\
  \      <p><em>I am not sure why I feel so hesitant to put this work aside. Of course,\
  \ there is something satisfying about feeling like you are a part of important research,\
  \ even if the experience of it is less than pleasant. (I think here of those who\
  \ have documented the beliefs of faiths that are somewhat more difficult to understand,\
  \ as in</em> To Scream Is Divine: My Year at a Nidalese Temple <em>and its somewhat\
  \ more uneven follow-up,</em> Kuthite Lullabies<em>.) Beyond that, though, I believe\
  \ I will miss the gods themselves—or at least the insights into them that these\
  \ texts have given me, even when I don’t believe a word that I am reading.</em></p>\n\
  \      <p><em>After reviewing the entirety of the</em> Godsrain Prophecies<em>,\
  \ I am confident in one thing and one thing only: that the author has been made\
  \ privy, whether through prophecy or otherwise, to the fact that one of Golarion’\
  s gods will die. The preoccupation with the subject of a dead god, accuracy of some\
  \ of the smaller details, and feeling of anticipation throughout are compelling\
  \ evidence in favor of my theory. With all the contradictions and confusions in\
  \ the text, though, I do not believe that the author knows which god, how they die,\
  \ or why. </em></p>\n      <p><em>Unfortunately, this is where my certainty ends,\
  \ as there are several different reasons why the author may have taken this information\
  \ and used it to create the prophecies. It is possible that they feared what might\
  \ happen and wrote these prophecies as a warning, attempting to prevent the dangers\
  \ they dreamed up. It is also possible that they hope the death will be a destabilizing\
  \ event, and that they intended for these prophecies to weaken faith and trust in\
  \ the gods, making them easier to abandon in the aftermath of a catastrophe. There\
  \ is no way to know, as I will admit to my Lady; I hope that in her wisdom, she\
  \ can discern the truth.</em></p>\n      <p><em>If nothing else, as with all futures,\
  \ only time will tell.</em></p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>–Yivali</em></p>\n\
  \      <center>\n       <br>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n       <br>\n      </center>\n\
  \      <h2>The “Death” of Rovagug</h2>\n      <p>The chant starts as a whisper—\
  an idle piece of pillow talk on nights Sarenrae cannot sleep, her fingertips gone\
  \ marching on the canvas that is Shelyn’s back, her hands casting surging shadows\
  \ onto Desna’s resting arm. She weaves a tale of how to win the battle that she\
  \ hungers for, imagining alliances that span across the Great Beyond and speaking\
  \ life to victory until the passion of her dream becomes a shared ambition. All\
  \ three lovers make mention of it, idly, to those who share their interests, pitched\
  \ in a tone and timbre meant to echo in the listener’s chest. The message drums\
  \ with nostalgia tinged with rage and thirst for justice long delayed, and it is\
  \ passed along from ear to ear until it finally circles back, a call to action with\
  \ the deadly urgency of war.</p>\n      <p><em>Imprisonment is not enough. Rovagug\
  \ must die.</em></p>\n      <p>There are more gods now than there were when Rovagug\
  \ was sealed away, and many sign up for the quest to kill the Great Destroyer, to\
  \ stand alongside Abadar and Gozreh and Calistria. Some do so to show their mettle,\
  \ some to gather bragging rights, and some to reassure themselves that if there\
  \ is something to gain, they won’t leave empty-handed. Sarenrae worries, privately,\
  \ that many do not understand the danger they’ve signed up for, but she takes the\
  \ names and notes the skills and hands the roles out all the same—rear guard to\
  \ those who fear but fight, support for those who dwell in hope, melee for those\
  \ who want to feel the blood beneath their fingers.</p>\n      <p>At first, it seems\
  \ too easy. Asmodeus unlocks the seal that leads into the Dead Vault and gods pour\
  \ through in something like a line. Wrackworms turn from feasting on the Rough Beast’\
  s flesh to face them, but fall to sword and spell and scythe as if they were an\
  \ afterthought, slicking the ground around themselves with remnants of their dying.\
  \ After the cheers and murmurs fade, a gnawing silence fills the air, thick and\
  \ dank and hungry, and for a moment, no one moves, a huddled mass of godhood waiting\
  \ for something to happen.</p>\n      <p>Then Rovagug is everywhere—suddenly, impossibly.\
  \ Rending, clawing, tearing open, shoveling exalted flesh into his waiting mouths.\
  \ Apsu’s wing is torn asunder. Hei Feng’s feathers fall like rain. Grandmother Spider\
  \ holds her own, her arms a whirling blur of blades, but watches as Thamir falls\
  \ still, body crushed beneath a claw, and Hanspur drowns a second time, awash in\
  \ his own blood. But Rovagug, despite his power, cannot overcome them all, and soon\
  \ the tide of battle changes, rattling the prison’s walls as gods press their advantages,\
  \ slamming his body side to side—an endless, rhythmic dying.</p>\n      <p>With\
  \ each impact on the Dead Vault’s walls, Golarion is shaken. Buildings tumble into\
  \ streets. Rivers shift to find new banks. Old trees flatten forests. Volcanoes\
  \ long thought dormant, from Taldor to the Five Kings Mountains, spit dense ash\
  \ into the sky, blanketing the life around them and blocking out the sun. The Eye\
  \ of Abendego expands twofold, turning the Mwangi Expanse into newly Sodden Lands.\
  \ When Rovagug is finally still, Sarenrae standing by his head with her arms held\
  \ high in victory, the gods emerge from the Dead Vault to find a world that thinks\
  \ the end has come.</p>\n      <p>After all the dead are mourned, no one agrees\
  \ on what comes next. The aftermath grows tense and bitter, victory turned vicious.\
  \ With Rovagug no threat to them, godly alliances feel heavier, a burden to be shrugged\
  \ off or set down and ignored. How to rebuild a ruined land becomes the stuff of\
  \ smaller wars—Abadar feuds with Erastil, Irori shuns Iomedae, Sarenrae feels the\
  \ weight of blame hurled at her from every corner, and Norgorber sides with anyone\
  \ who might advance his cause. But while they bicker here and now, the gods may\
  \ yet unite again, as deep in Avistani soil, disturbed by distant tremors, the worst\
  \ of Rovagug’s spawn have felt their prison falter and ready for destruction that\
  \ would make their sire proud.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  \ trapped within the bowels of Golarion has always made me a bit nervous, but it\
  \ seems it may be better than the alternative! Which gives me one final idea as\
  \ to why these prophecies exist—perhaps they argue against change and tell those\
  \ who read them that, even for those gods whom you might fear or hate, the status\
  \ quo is better than anything new that you might long for—a desperate version of\
  \ a wish that, no matter what they have seen coming, it would be best for things\
  \ to continue as they are. Sadly for the author, change, I believe, is inevitable.\
