  \  </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The ritual continued.\
  \ Gifne sat in place as she had for the past day, eyes closed, silently repeating\
  \ the mantra in her mind, communing with the Green, with the Will of the World,\
  \ with nature itself. Finally, to her satisfaction, she felt nature respond.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>All about her the world became green, lush, filled with light. The\
  \ sandy ground grew dark with moisture, became thick loam, from which sprouted grass,\
  \ brush, and bramble. Under the half-elf druid’s encouragement, desert plants sprung\
  \ from the ground around a newly pooling oasis, their leaves reaching toward the\
  \ diamond-blue sky. </p> \n      <p>Gifne opened her glowing green eyes and was\
  \ pleased with what she saw. Where once there was only dry dunes now stood a lush\
  \ grove surrounding an oasis vital to her employers, the nation of Rahadoum. The\
  \ potential for life in this place had always been here. All it needed was a little\
  \ push so it could flower and grow.</p> \n      <p>She closed her eyes and thanked\
  \ the Green for its bounty. This was another successful day in a series of successes.\
  \ If her work continued unimpeded, Rahadoum would have many years before it had\
  \ to worry about encroachment from the desert once more.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  >Lost Omens: Gods &amp; Magic!</a></p> \n      </div> \n      <p>With her eyes still\
  \ closed, Gifne folded her hands and began a new ritual, communing with nature,\
  \ casting her mind from her body, seeking the next location to continue her work,\
  \ to re-channel the desert, keep it flowing and healthy, yet maintaining a balance\
  \ with its human neighbors.</p> \n      <p>“Are you… you’re not praying, are you?”\
  </p> \n      <p>Gifne opened her eyes but didn’t get up from her cross-legged position.\
  \ Jhelana Mandu, captain of the Pure Legion, had been assigned as her bodyguard\
  \ and guide when she’d first arrived in Rahadoum’s capital, Azir, the Godless Port.\
  \ The woman was tough, curious, and charming. Over the past few months they’d each\
  \ saved one another a score of times, changing what was once a professional relationship\
  \ into a friendship forged in fire and steel. Yet Jhelana’s question represented\
  \ the rot in the garden.</p> \n      <p>“Not praying,” the half-elf answered, struggling\
  \ to keep sarcasm from her voice. Luckily her friend’s Rahadoumi accent was different\
  \ enough from her Taldan tones to hide the nuance. “I was communing.”</p> \n   \
  \   <p>“Communing?” Jhelana asked, eyebrow raised. “With what?”</p> \n      <p>“\
  Why ask questions to which you already know the answer?” said Gifne, no longer bothering\
  \ to hide her exasperated sigh. “With nature, with the Green. With life itself,\
  \ as I’ve told you before.”</p> \n      <p>“Sounds an awful lot like a deity,” said\
  \ Jhelana, patting her sword. “Which I’m sworn to put a stop to.”</p> \n      <p>Gifne\
  \ laughed to hide her annoyance. She pointed at where the green grass now poked\
  \ up through the sand at Jhelana’s feet. “Are those blades of grass a god? Is that\
  \ palm tree? That spit-lizard on the rocks or those flowers by the pool? No. That’\
  s life itself and it’s never wrong to worship life.”</p> \n      <p>Jhelana moved\
  \ her hand away from her sword. Gifne had seen her wield it several times since\
  \ they’d begun travelling together and didn’t envy any who found themselves facing\
  \ the Legionnaire. “You shouldn’t worship anything,” Jhelana said. “The Pure Legion\
  \ believes in people. In ideas, as the Laws of Mortality dictate. Not in powers\
  \ who rule from some golden castle in the clouds.”</p> \n      <p>Gifne shook her\
  \ head. How could she explain to the Legionnaire, dear friend though she was, about\
  \ the will of the green world, the very life force of Golarion? It shone through\
  \ them all: rock, tree, and water. Even Jhelana Mandu; her more brightly than most.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“I used nature’s magic to heal your wounds when we were set upon by\
  \ those gnoll reavers last month,” Gifne said.</p> \n      <p>“You didn’t question\
  \ where it came from then.”</p> \n      <p>“I was barely conscious,” said Jhelana.\
  \ “Plus I trusted you when you said your healing came from no god.”</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Gifne raised an eyebrow. “So now you don’t trust me?”</p> \n      <p>Jhelana\
  \ shrugged, looking uncertain—very unlike her usual self-assured demeanor. “A troubling\
  \ thought occurred as I watched you work on this latest encroachment of the desert.”\
  </p> \n      <p>The sun still shone bright in the sky, its heat bringing dappled\
  \ sweat to Gifne’s brow. “And that is?”</p> \n      <p>After departing Azir, Gifne\
  \ and the captain had traveled east alongside the Winding Way river, making their\
  \ way through most of central Rahadoum. Gifne could use its vibrant waters to aid\
  \ her ritual and also, the pair never need worry about dying of thirst. Far off\
  \ along the eastern horizon, Gifne could see the tall peaks of the Napsune Mountains\
  \ where stood the fabled Shepherd’s Rock, citadel of the Pure Legion.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Jhelana stared at where the desert had once been, where the lush oasis now\
  \ stood. “You commune with nature, but what if it’s nature’s will that the desert\
  \ consume Rahadoum? Would you abandon us, leave my country to choke and die, a forgotten\
  \ ruin in the desert?”</p> \n      <p>The wind blew around them, causing newly sprouted\
  \ leaves to rustle gently, making a susurrus of the long grass. Jhelana’s question\
  \ pierced through Gifne’s defenses as easily as the captain pierced an opponent\
  \ with her blade. Was she doing the right thing, here? Or was she upsetting the\
  \ balance? Gifne looked at the life around her. She stared at the desert, its dunes\
  \ now several hundred yards away.</p> \n      <p>“It’s hard to know what nature\
  \ wants,” said Gifne slowly. “These are things you will need to accept. Balance\
  \ is never easy, but it’s worth it. I cannot believe the desert would destroy your\
  \ nation. Elsewise, my rituals wouldn’t work. A balance can be achieved between\
  \ your people and the desert. I have to believe that.”</p> \n      <p>“When I was\
  \ a child, this didn’t happen!” Jhelana said. “The desert might grow slightly in\
  \ the dry season, a few hundred yards at most, but when the rains came, the grasses\
  \ retook it. The movement was slow, there was balance. Only now…”</p> \n      <p>Gifne\
  \ stared at her friend in shock. The Legionnaire never spoke of her childhood, never\
  \ told much of herself at all, really. “What’s happening now?”</p> \n      <p>“\
  The desert is like a glutton who can never be sated,” said Jhelana, and Gifne heard\
  \ the fear in her voice. “The rains slow its progress, but it keeps growing by miles\
  \ every season. Nothing about this is natural. Nothing!”</p> \n      <p>Gifne refrained\
  \ from telling her friend that trying to determine what was natural on Golarion\
  \ was often a futile exercise. In its earliest days her own faith, druids of four\
  \ factions had warred over whose philosophy best represented nature. Only by intercession\
  \ of nature itself did they learn to work in balance together as the Green Faith.\
  \ Even now there were schisms and disagreements, but at least none could claim to\
  \ be the only true path. </p> \n      <p>“I believe you, my friend,” the druid said.\
  \ “And I promise two things. You will never have to compromise your beliefs with\
  \ me. I worship nature.”</p> \n      <p>Jhelana nodded. “Your second promise?”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“This I swear, Jhelana Mandu,” said Gifne, slicing open a palm with\
  \ a clawed thumb and letting it bleed on the thick brown soil. “If the source of\
  \ the growing desert is unnatural, we will put a stop to it, you and I.”</p> \n\
  \      <p>Jhelana stared at Gifne’s bleeding hand in surprise. Then, quicker than\
  \ thought, she too cut her sword-calloused palm with a dagger and grasped the druid’\
  s hand. Gifne smiled. </p> \n      <p>“We must keep to the Winding Way, for now,\
  \ but soon we will come to this Eternal Oasis. I would very much like to see that,\
  \ if we’re able.”</p> \n      <p>“Why?” Jhelana asked. “It’s said those who go in\
  \ don’t come out. Besides, it’s one of the few places in Rahadoum that doesn’t need\
  \ your help.”</p> \n      <p>“That’s just it,” said Gifne. “If there is indeed an\
  \ unbalance, something strange happening in Rahadoum, it may be we can find the\
  \ answers in this Eternal Oasis.”</p> \n      <p>Gifne watched the uncertainty in\
  \ Jhelana’s face give way to determination. The captain nodded and the two began\
  \ to make their way back to the Winding Way to find the next place to push back\
  \ the desert. </p> \n      <p>All around them, as the wind blew through the new\
  \ grass and rippled the oasis pond, the desert waited. </p> \n     </blockquote>\
