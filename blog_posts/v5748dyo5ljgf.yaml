  \ Help From My Friends</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, January 19, 2017</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We've all\
  \ been there, whether by seeing it in a movie, reading it in a book, or experiencing\
  \ it in your favorite tabletop adventure: the protagonists stride into the throne\
  \ room, where the regal monarch greets them and says, “Hail, noble adventurers.\
  \ Long have I sought heroes to assist me with this plot hook, and you may be the\
  \ saviors I need.” That treatment may work well in a European-fantasy setting awash\
  \ with minor kingdoms and desperate NPCs, but in Qadira, everyone knows somebody;\
  \ there's rarely any need for a regional governor to rely on some no-name group\
  \ of 9th-level adventurers, much less have any motivation to entrust them with important\
  \ tasks. Whether one's the soul of courtesy or a boor busting into a trade prince's\
  \ parlor demanding news of the nearest dungeon, an unknown adventurer's almost certain\
  \ to receive the same response: “Who the hell are you?”</p> \n    <p>While Jessica\
  \ Price was writing <a href=\"/products/btpy9qib\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Qadira, Jewel of the East</em></a>, we began discussing the importance of one's\
  \ status through citizenship, family, and social connections—everything from selling\
  \ a goods without a license, to choosing a spouse, to arranging a meeting, to traveling\
  \ the roads without paying tolls. That was all well and good for citizens, but we\
  \ knew that for Qadira to be a fun adventuring location, it needed to be accessible\
  \ to foreign PCs. If an adventurer isn't born into Qadiran society, how can he access\
  \ its wonders? Patronage. With the right friend, doors both figurative and literal\
  \ open for the PCs. After we had nerded out about Roman patronage for a while, Jessica\
  \ exclaimed what we were both thinking (and I give you the direct quote): GAMIFY\
  \ SOCIAL CLIMBING. The honor system in <a href=\"/products/btpy8x64\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Ultimate Campaign</em></a> gave us a starting point, but the more we brainstormed\
  \ how Qadira's social mobility worked, the more we realized we needed something\
  \ tied less to the client and more to the patron herself. The patronage system was\
  \ born.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9299-Opener.jpg\"\

  ><em>Qadira, Jewel of the East</em></a> dedicates four pages to the patronage system,\
  \ which provides a mechanical framework for a client (either a PC or the entire\
  \ party) to earn social credit (<b>Clout</b>) with a patron. Each patron has a certain\
  \ amount of influence (<b>Rank</b>, ranging from 1 to 10), holds power in a certain\
  \ sphere within the society (<b>Category</b>), feels a certain way toward the client\
  \ (<b>Disposition</b>), and may know other equally powerful people in other social\
  \ spheres (<b>Affiliation</b>). As a PC performs tasks in a patron's name, he earns\
  \ Clout that he can spend on improving the patron's disposition or buying favors.\
  \ The trick is that relative social status plays a significant role in who talks\
  \ to whom, so a tourist stands almost no chance of arranging a meeting with the\
  \ satrap; in game terms, one's starting Clout depends heavily on the patron's rank\
  \ and the PC's ranks in the patron's favorite skills, and if that calculation results\
  \ in 0 Clout or less, the prospective client had better supply a really nice gift\
  \ or suffer being ignored.</p> \n    <p>Patrons are the key to success in Qadira.\
  \ The right patron can not only provide the PCs with a critical lead on a lucrative\
  \ adventure site, but she can also help outfit them from her personal stockpiles,\
  \ secure them access to restricted areas, and then spread word of their deeds. Of\
  \ course, this is a two-way street; if a PC intends to earn that Clout, he must\
  \ perform favors for the patron, help her earn prestige by having sponsored a successful\
  \ hero, and avoid embarrassing her. The patronage system includes a wealth of suggested\
  \ ways one can earn and lose Clout, including methods unique to different patron\
  \ categories (e.g. attending a major social event for a social patron or recovering\
  \ a major relic for a religious patron). Perhaps my favorite little feature is the\
  \ list of additional patron qualities that modify the patronage system in little\
  \ ways to fit a patron's positive and negative qualities. If the PC intends to keep\
  \ climbing the social ladder, though, his patrons can be of further service, granting\
  \ him a reliable introduction to higher-ranked patrons that had previously ignored\
  \ him. A sword-swinging warrior can find a home in any campaign, but in Qadira,\
  \ a PC who plays the system right could secure unfettered access to the empire's\
  \ wonders, the ear of any celebrity, and a marriage proposal to one of the satrap's\
  \ cousins—all by knowing who's who and how to befriend them. I like to think that\
  \ in a Qadiran campaign, playing a social climber could be just as important a party\
  \ role as that of a healer or trapsmith.</p> \n    <p>What you'll find in this book\
  \ is designed for Qadira but is easily adaptable for other regions and settings\
  \ by renaming a few titles or adding a new category. Since I spend most of my time\
  \ working on the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>\
  \ campaign, I thought it fitting to include an informal patron stat block for several\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society's most reliable contacts in Qadira.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
