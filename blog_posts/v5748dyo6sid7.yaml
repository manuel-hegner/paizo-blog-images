  \ With Gen Con just two short weeks away, we figured it was time to reveal the changes\
  \ for Year 5 of Pathfinder Society Play. The good news is, there are very few, and\
  \ they’re all exciting!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8022a8d5-f979-49de-bbb2-04fcdafa005d/PZOPFS0005_PFSYEAR5_2000.png\"\

  \ \n     <p>Thanks to the efforts of the Pathfinder Society, as well as the ongoing\
  \ events in Golarion, the following updates will be made effective <strong>August\
  \ 3, 2023</strong>.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>The <strong>changeling</strong>\
  \ versatile heritage is now freely available to all players, due to the Society’\
  s adventures involving the night hag Aslynn.</li> \n      <li>More adventurers of\
  \ uncommon ancestries have joined the Pathfinder Society in the past few years,\
  \ so the <strong>tengu</strong> and <strong>ratfolk</strong> ancestries will also\
  \ be made freely available!</li> \n      <li>Additionally, in preparation for their\
  \ inclusion in the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej2?Pathfinder-Player-Core\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Core</em></a> book, the <strong>tiefling</strong> and <strong>aasimar</strong>\
  \ versatile heritages are freely available to all players.</li> \n      <li>Boons\
  \ for all of the above freely available options will be removed from the Boon Store\
  \ as of August 3. Players who previously purchased those boons will have them updated\
  \ to grant a free use of the resurrection ritual to those characters, as we have\
  \ done for past ancestries.</li> \n      <li>Finally, due to the influx of planar\
  \ energy throughout Golarion, the <strong>geniekin</strong> versatile heritage will\
  \ be reduced to 40 Achievement Points! This boon will also be updated to include\
  \ the <strong>talos</strong> and <strong>ardande</strong> heritages from <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02eju?Pathfinder-Rage-of-Elements\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Rage of Elements</em></a> upon its release.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <br> \n \
  \    <h2>Retail Incentive Program</h2> \n     <p>Our Retail Incentive Program is\
  \ designed to help players support those game stores and venues which host our games,\
  \ often for free, while earning in-game benefits. Over the past year we’ve heard\
  \ some recommendations to improve it, and I’m delighted to share the new version\
  \ of the program now!</p> \n     <p>You can download PDFs of the rules for <a href=\"\
  https://downloads.paizo.com/RetailerIncentiveProgram_PFS.pdf\">Pathfinder Society</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/RetailerIncentiveProgram_SFS.pdf\">Starfinder\
  \ Society</a> now on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay/policies\">Retail\
  \ Incentive Program page</a>, which we’re also working on redesigning and making\
  \ more prominent. The major changes are:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>Adding a new\
  \ “heroic” tier, unlocked with a table spend of $100 or more</li> \n      <li>Altering\
  \ or replacing boons that reduced the gold cost of healing now that those benefits\
  \ primarily use Achievement Points</li> \n      <li>Making the benefits more versatile\
  \ and/or slightly more useful</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Overall, the intention\
  \ of programs like the RIP and the Accessory Perks is to provide incentives to players\
  \ and GMs to support our products and venues. The goal is not for these to be hard\
  \ rules, but to encourage GMs and organizers to adopt a “spirit of the law” reading\
  \ of any of these programs to ensure all players are enjoying themselves. Thanks\
  \ to all the volunteers who provided feedback on these revisions!</p> \n     <p\
