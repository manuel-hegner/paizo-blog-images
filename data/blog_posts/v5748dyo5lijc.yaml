  description\">Ho there, stranger! If you're lookin' for shelter on a cold night\
  \ like tonight, you could do a lot better than that cursed Ledinthorp estate you\
  \ were prowling 'round. Come 'long. My daughters married and moved out ages ago—\
  means we got a spare bed for a traveler who doesn't know how to stay out of trouble\
  \ when there're Gray Gardeners keeping the peace.</p> \n     <p>You even know whose\
  \ ruined home you were in? That once belonged to the old Ledinthorp clan. They played\
  \ at being dukes and earls until the Revolution swept through in '67 and lopped\
  \ off their heads! I hear the nursemaid smuggled out the duke's heirs before the\
  \ mobs set fire to the place and made dresses out of the swanky curtains. Nobody's\
  \ had a mind to fix it up, and the only reason anyone goes there now is to look\
  \ for the inheritance the duke supposedly hid in the walls. Course, if there's any\
  \ justice in the world, the Red Raven's found it long since and given it out to\
  \ help feed starving mouths in these tryin' times.</p> \n     <p>What's that, stranger?\
  \ Never heard of the Red Raven? That's a right shame, and something of a surprise\
  \ for folk 'round here. He's famous—a hometown hero! Now I admit a lot of cities\
  \ get to make that claim, but 'round here it's true. He was born a common man to\
  \ a couple down on Razor Street. Some even say that he's the lost son of Darl Jubbanich,\
  \ which would make the Red Raven the child of Liberty itself, raised by the common\
  \ folk! But those were hard times; we were struggling with starvation inflicted\
  \ by Galt's hungry neighbors, and the dark legacy of those traitorous aristocrats\
  \ still strangled our lands. Even so, he fed on the freedom of a liberated nation—\
  that part's exaggeration, mind, but it's how the story goes—and grew up strong,\
  \ proud, and gallant. And handsome! You'd believe me if you saw him. My, if I was\
  \ forty years younger…</p> \n     <p>Oh, don't give that look! At my age you're\
  \ allowed to speak your mind. Now, where was I?</p> \n     <p>Just about everyone\
  \ 'round here's seen the Red Raven from down the street or across the square as\
  \ he pursues brigands and traitors. I'm lucky to have seen him eight times, myself.\
  \ Why, he flies 'cross the shingles as if his cape were feathers, soaring on wings\
  \ of grandeur stained by the blood of them rotten nobles. The glow of old Galt's\
  \ torches'n'pitchforks can't compare to that righteous hellfire smoldering in his\
  \ eyes, hotter'n Asmodeus's summer sweat! Course, what would you expect from someone\
  \ whose passion for justice ignited from the sparks that flew from the first final\
  \ blade? You know how our final blades all have ladies' names? That's 'cause they're\
  \ the only wives the Red Raven takes, and hardly a night goes by that he doesn't\
  \ bring home some bloody present for the missus. Har har!</p> \n     <p>Aww, loosen\
  \ up, stranger. Jokin' aside, my youngest, Anjerille, she was at a festival when\
  \ the Red Raven dropped into the crowd and picked out a villain—said he could sniff\
  \ out nobles by night just by following the stench of their perfumes. Oh, you laugh.\
  \ I did too, but only a month later we learned that he has eyes so sharp that he\
  \ can tell the difference between a cobbler and a count from three streets away\
  \ with only a crescent moon for light. Now, my eldest, Redarra, is known to tell\
  \ some tall tales, but given what else I've seen, I half take it as truth when she\
  \ says he can taste a man's bloodline back ten generations from just a single drop.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Who is he really? Anyone you ask will give a different answer. Some\
  \ think he's a common bandit turned good. Others say he's a reformed noble seeking\
  \ redemption. Me? I say he's everyone in Edme, for we're all willing to watch for\
  \ aristocrats who think that after half a century it's finally safe to return to\
  \ Galt. Aristocrats who would sneak around a burned-down estate and walk away with\
  \ a bag of jewels, like the one I fancy you're carryin' now. Blue-bloods with a\
  \ face like yours—the same as old Duke Ledinthorp's, whose head I watched tumble\
  \ from Razor Jenni's blade so long ago. The son of a dead dynasty like yours, scavengin'\
  \ what rightly belongs to the people of Galt. Who's the Red Raven? He's everyone\
  \ we've passed tonight. He's every set of eyes that's seen us walking together.\
  \ He's the footsteps you hear patterin' across the rooftops, fast as the heart of\
  \ man who's got only an hour left to live.</p> \n     <p>Best get runnin' Your Excellency.\
  \ The Red Raven knows you're here.</p> \n     <p><i>Check back next week when we\
