  \ this Saturday, June 17th! There a tons of participating locations, so check out\
  \ the program's event locator, join in the fun, and grab a copy of Paizo's Free\
  \ RPG Day offerings while supplies last. Last month we met <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljt1\"\
  >the new promo character Reepazo</a>, so today I'd like to present two other prizes:\
  \ the new <a href=\"/products/btpy9r0o?Starfinder-First-Contact\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ First Contact</em></a> and a special Chronicle sheet that you can earn by playing\
  \ anytime between June 16th and June 25th.</p> \n    <p><em>First Contact</em> is\
  \ an exciting first look at both the Starfinder rules and its setting, presenting\
  \ 12 different creatures (including 4 different playable races). There's a lot of\
  \ great content here, and I reached out to the authors to share some of their favorite\
  \ parts.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO9500-11-SecurityRobot.jpg\"\

  \ Art-wise, I think my favorite piece is the security robot. I love the sleek futuristic\
  \ flavor that's part Mac Store, part Prince Robot from Saga, and part classic droid.\
  \ But a lot of the monsters in here are things I've been waiting to see in print\
  \ for years—both the ellicoth and the haan started life as brief name-drops in <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8qib?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Worlds\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Distant Worlds</em></a>, and now here we are at last. I particularly\
  \ enjoyed writing about the orocoran ichor lords—it's high time Aucturn got some\
  \ native inhabitants!</p> \n     <p><b>Rob G. McCreary</b>: The bone sages of Eox\
  \ were first introduced back in <a href=\"/products/btpy85ed?Pathfinder-14-Second-Darkness-Chapter-2-Children-of-the-Void\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #14</em></a>, and in Pathfinder RPG they were most\
  \ easily represented by liches. For Starfinder, however, we wanted to update the\
  \ lich to the science-fantasy future, and thus the necrovite was born. So what makes\
  \ a necrovite more than just a space-lich (other than a cooler name, of course)?\
  \ Three things: technomancer AND mystic spells, the Eoxian wrackstaff, and an electroencephalon\
  \ (because a necrovite has to store her soul somewhere, after all).</p> \n     <p><b>Jason\
  \ Keeley</b>: It was a bit of a no-brainer that goblins would be in Starfinder.\
  \ As a bit of a joke, I wrote them up as \"space goblins\" for the playtest and\
  \ gave them cobbled-together laser pistols that tended to blow up in their own faces.\
  \ It turns out people thought that was funny enough to make them canon with <em>First\
  \ Contact</em>. And the art, with their bandaged-up bubble helmets, really helped\
  \ seal the deal!</p> \n     <p><b>John Compton</b>: Starfinder's been a great chance\
  \ to flesh out the many weird aliens Paizo—quite often James L. Sutter—has name-dropped,\
  \ but it's also an exciting opportunity to create entirely new creatures. My assignment\
  \ for First Contact included \"New plant monster (Castrovel)\" and the directive\
  \ to \"Make it weird and awesome.\" I knew I wanted a plant that wasn't a low-mobility\
  \ ambush predator, and at the time I was fixated on invasive species like kudzu.\
  \ What resulted was the ksarik, a ferocious carnivore that absorbed psychic energies\
  \ and evolved from fairly mundane corpse blossoms into aggressive quadrupeds that\
  \ can absorb others' genetic material in order to take over their ecological niches.\
  \ I'm a sucker for dorsal crests, and if you look closely, you can see the eyestalks\
  \ projected to either side like a hammerhead shark.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n \
  \   <p>Be sure to look at <a href=\"/products/btpy9r0o?Starfinder-First-Contact\"\
  ><em>First Contact</em></a> for a first taste of what's to come in 2017 and beyond!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Even though there's not a new adventure featured for Free RPG Day, we\
  \ want to encourage you to get out and game together. In fact, we've made a unique\
  \ Chronicle sheet for the event. If you're playing a game any time from June 16th\
  \ to June 25th, you can earn a copy of this sheet—just one per participant, no matter\
  \ how many times you play. In fact, consider printing off some extras to hand out\
  \ at whatever event you're a part of so that others can join in the benefits. Everyone\
  \ gets the first boon, which allows the chance to replay (or \"re-GM\" for credit)\
  \ one of the past Free RPG Day modules one time, and while it's certainly the spirit\
  \ of this reward to use that boon for Free RPG Day this year, you're welcome to\
  \ hold onto it for whenever you need it.</p> \n    <p>If you play in a Free RPG\
  \ Day game—that's a game hosted by a location participating in Free RPG Day 2017—\
  you also receive the Tome of First Contact boon. Just as you're getting a first\
  \ glimpse at what Starfinder has to offer, so to has one of your characters found\
  \ a wondrous bestiary filled with alien beasts and otherworldly people. Reference\
  \ it to get an edge when facing creatures from beyond Golarion, and above all, enjoy\
  \ Paizo's contributions to Free RPG Day 2017!</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
