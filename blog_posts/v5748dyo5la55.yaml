  \ of Doom Results!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, August 31, 2007</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Gen Con was a great show for Paizo, as usual, but this year had a new addition\
  \ to our booth presence. It all started with a little contest around the office\
  \ to determine who could design the most deadly dungeon chamber. While this idea\
  \ was all well and good, we would need some \"test\" subjects to run through our\
  \ gauntlet of pain, and thus the idea of running a delve at Gen Con was born.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Using the fabulous Master Maze 3D dungeon terrain pieces produced by Dwarven\
  \ Forge, along with our <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wv9\">Critical Hit Deck</a></i>,\
  \ <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7uvm\">Combat Pad</a></i>, and <a href=\"/gameMastery/itemPacks\"\
  >item cards</a>, we set out to murder as many unsuspecting visitors to our corner\
  \ of the booth, and murder we did. Of course, we also gave out some great prizes\
  \ to those who managed to succeed, including free production, discounts at the booth,\
  \ and even some real swords. </p> \n   <p>Every unfortunate soul who met his end\
  \ in the depths of Tirana's death trap became a red dot on our oversized delve maps,\
  \ as a warning to others. Of course, that didn't seem to help much, as by the end\
  \ of the show there were 255 red dots on the maps. Considering that we ran roughly\
  \ 1000 players through the delve, a 1-in-4 death rate is pretty respectable (mental\
  \ note: make next year deadlier). Of course, part of the fun was figuring out whose\
  \ rooms caused the most deaths. Phil Lacefield's rooms certainly had the most kills\
  \ as a whole, but no individual room had more kills than Publisher Erik Mona's doom-filled\
  \ Vrock chamber. Congrats to Erik for having the least compassion toward poor player\
  \ characters.</p> \n   <p>If you missed out on the delve, never fear. Many of its\
  \ chambers were used as inspiration for <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zke\">GameMastery\
  \ Module D2: Seven Swords of Sin</a></i>, which should be hitting your store shelves\
  \ any day now.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn <br>GameMastery Brand Manager</p> \n  </blockquote>\
