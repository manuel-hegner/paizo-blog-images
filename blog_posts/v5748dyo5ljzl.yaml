  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">While we're excited for the launch of so many\
  \ new adventures at Gen Con in a few more weeks, Season 8 cannot be overshadowed\
  \ with its last two scenarios. Just as the Society has gathered extraordinary tools\
  \ with which to crack the Untouchable Opal, so too has Season 8 brought together\
  \ exciting scenarios to explore the elemental planes. Both of these adventures are\
  \ fitting capstones.</p> \n    <p>If you haven't heard, in Season 8 we've been preparing\
  \ to destroy a major artifact, in the process unleashing a long-imprisoned demigod.\
  \ That demigod's enemies are equally immortal, and they've been none too pleased\
  \ to learn about the Society's intentions. Fortunately, the Pathfinders have teamed\
  \ up with an extraplanar operation known as the Concordance of Elements, and together\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy9tl8?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-824-Raid-on-the-Cloudborne-Keep\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-24: Raid on the Cloudborne Keep</em></a> they're\
  \ poised to neutralize one of these enemies before they can become an insurmountable\
  \ threat. This Tier 5-9 scenario by Sean McGowan takes the PCs on a dangerous mission\
  \ of infiltration, airships, and skullduggery deep within the Plane of Air, where\
  \ a recklessly ambitious elemental is assembling an army. Defy the Duchess of All\
  \ Winds and bring light back to the Elemental Planes in this scenario with a special\
  \ opportunity for the Silver Crusade faction.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustrations by Tom Ventre</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last\
  \ year we launched our first exclusively seeker-level content in years with the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9k93?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-20-All-for-Immortality-Part-1-First-Taste-of-Eternity\"\
  >All for Immortality series</a>, and ever since it's been our aim to continue releasing\
  \ seeker contentâ€”not necessarily in extensive series but rather as stand-alone features.\
  \ For something as monumental as unleashing a demigod on where the Planes of Earth\
  \ and Fire meet with tectonically unbearable heat, we knew that level 12+ adventurers\
  \ would be the right choice. Season finales are difficult, and high-level content\
  \ is difficult. Fortunately, we also had Robert Brookes (caught him between <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9sgs?Aethera-Campaign-Setting\">Aethera</a> projects, which you should\
  \ also check out) ready to tackle this challenge. He delivered. <a href=\"/products/btpy9tl9?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-825-Unleashing-the-Untouchable\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-25: Unleashing the Untouchable</em></a> is a\
  \ Tier 12-15 adventure that showcases both your powerful PCs' strengths as well\
  \ as the serious ramifications that accompany any mortals' efforts to revise the\
  \ setting's extended pantheon. You won't want to miss it.</p> \n    <p>As a production\
  \ update for Gen Con adventures, we're making great progress. As I write this, we're\
  \ running our final passes on most of the Starfinder Society adventures, which should\
  \ be ready to distribute to Gen Con's Starfinder Society GMs at the end of the week.\
  \ Likewise, most of our Pathfinder Society adventures are nearing completion, and\
  \ we'll be delivering those to the convention's GMs next week.</p> \n    <p>John\
