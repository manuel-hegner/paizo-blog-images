  right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>So, a bard, a fighter, a rogue, a cleric,\
  \ and a wizard walk into a dungeon. The fighter says, \"If only someone could give\
  \ me a bonus to hit and damage against those ogres.\" The rogue says, \"If only\
  \ someone could give me a bonus to my Disable Device checks to help me disarm this\
  \ trap.\" The cleric says, \"If only someone could counter the song of the harpy\
  \ that is luring me to my doom.\" The wizard says, \"If only someone could fascinate\
  \ these orcs so that I could get away from them.\" Finally the bard says, \"Sorry\
  \ guys, but I am built using 3.5 and all out of bardic performance for the day.\
  \ Who wants a <i>ghost sound</i>?\"</p> \n   <p>Don't let this situation happen\
  \ to you. The Pathfinder bard has a revised mechanic for his Bardic Performance,\
  \ limiting him to a total number of rounds per day, meaning that he does not have\
  \ to save his few uses for inspire courage. Bards start out with a number of rounds\
  \ per day equal to 4 + their Charisma modifier and gain an additional 2 rounds per\
  \ day for every level beyond first. Lem here also has the Extra Performance feat\
  \ which grants him an additional 6 rounds per day.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>The beta\
  \ version of the bard also had two paths for his bardic performance, allowing him\
  \ to gain different abilities depending upon the type of Perform skill he possessed.\
  \ While it was fun to come up with new abilities, the split caused many to worry\
  \ that for a bard to reach his full potential, he would have to invest twice the\
  \ number of ranks into Perform. In the final game, we solidified it back into one\
  \ progression, but kept many of the new abilities, such as Dirge of Doom that causes\
  \ all foes within 30 feet to become shaken as long as the bard continues his performance.\
  \ In addition, the progression for some of the other performance types has been\
  \ enhanced. Inspire courage increases to +2 at 5th level and continues to increase\
  \ by +1 for every 6 levels after 5th. Inspire competence also increases by +1 for\
  \ every 4 levels after 3rd.</p> \n   <p>We have also made starting and maintaining\
  \ a bardic performance a bit easier. At 1st level, starting a bardic performance\
  \ is a standard action, but this changes to a move action at 7th level and a swift\
  \ action at 13th. Regardless of the action needed to start a performance, maintaining\
  \ a performance is a free action, meaning that the bard can keep up a performance\
  \ and still cast spells, move, and make attacks.</p> \n   <p>Moving on from bardic\
  \ performance, the bard has received a number of other upgrades as well. Bards no\
  \ longer have any alignment restrictions and they have d8 hit dice. Their spell\
  \ progression has been enhanced a bit to remove the \"0\" listings from their chart,\
  \ meaning that they get a spell without having to have a Charisma high enough to\
  \ grant a bonus spell of that level. Bardic Knowledge now grants a bonus to all\
  \ Knowledge skills equal to 1/2 the bard's level (minimum +1) and allows the bard\
  \ to make any Knowledge skill check without having ranks in it. Well-versed grants\
  \ a flat +4 bonus on saves against other bardic performances, as well as sonic and\
  \ language-based spell effects. Lore master is granted at 5th level and it allows\
  \ the bard to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check. In addition, once per day he\
  \ can take 20 on a Knowledge skill check. As he gains levels, he can use this secondary\
  \ ability multiple times per day as well.</p> \n   <p>One other class feature was\
  \ added to the bard that allows him to really maximize his skill points. During\
  \ the playtest there were a number of concerns about the Perform skill, being that\
  \ it was required to gain access to specific bardic performance abilities but did\
  \ little else beyond the roleplaying uses. To solve this we introduced a new bard\
  \ class feature called versatile performance. This ability is gained at 2nd level\
  \ and it allows the bard to substitute his Perform bonus for the bonus of two other\
  \ skills, depending on the type of Perform. For example, Lem has versatile performance\
  \ for both comedy and wind instruments. This allows him to substitute his bonus\
  \ in Perform (comedy) for his bonus Bluff and Intimidate. It also allows him to\
  \ substitute his bonus in Perform (wind instruments) for his bonus in Diplomacy\
  \ and Handle Animal. With this ability he can use these skills even if he would\
  \ normally have to be trained. As he gains levels, Lem can add new types of Perform\
  \ to his list, allowing him to make even more substitutions (such as Perform [dance]\
  \ for Acrobatics and Fly).</p> \n   <p>There have been a few changes to the spells\
  \ on Lem's list as well. <i>Glitterdust</i>, for example, now allows a save each\
  \ round to negate the blindness (although the creatures affected by it still remain\
  \ visible for the duration). <i>Hideous laughter</i> now grants an additional save\
  \ after the first round of laughing to negate the effect. If this second save fails,\
  \ the target laughs for the entire duration, which remains 1 round per level. <i>Lesser\
  \ confusion</i>, and by extension, <i>confusion</i>, have been simplified a bit\
  \ to make them easier to adjudicate. Both of these spells cause the subject to gain\
  \ the confused condition, which causes them to roll d% each round to determine their\
  \ actions on the following table.</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Confused Condition</b><br>\
  \ 01–25 Act Normally<br> 26–50 Do nothing but babble incoherently<br> 51–75 Deal\
  \ 1d8 points of damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand<br> 76–100 Attack\
  \ nearest creature</p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>At higher levels the bard gains\
  \ a few new performance types, allowing him to frighten or even kill his foes (in\
  \ Lem's case, probably by telling a really bad joke). The bard also gains a performance\
  \ type that allows him to cast <i>mass cure serous wounds</i> by performing for\
  \ 4 consecutive rounds. The bard also gains the jack-of-all-trades ability at 10th\
  \ level which allows him to try any skill untrained and at higher levels allows\
  \ him to treat all skills like class skills and to take 10 on any skill check.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Well, that is the end of the bard's tale. Tune in next week for a journey\
  \ into the wild with Lini, the iconic druid.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead\
