  >There are many ways to attempt to win at adventuring. You can pry up every loose\
  \ board in the dungeon to drain the local economy of every last mote of gold dust.\
  \ You can gather wild tales of that time you defeated a Vulture Demon with nothing\
  \ but a sharpened chicken bone. Or, if you don't like your friends much, you can\
  \ be the last one standing when the battle ends. But wealth is hollow, tales can\
  \ be fabricated, and standing alone is... well, lonely. The true pathfinder of style\
  \ wins by making it look good, period.</p>\n             <p>It takes a higher standard\
  \ than a brown woolen cloak to make it as a character in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>. Live fast and make it through Adventure Deck\
  \ 6, or die pretty.</p>\n             <p>This week, the PACG team struts their choices\
  \ for best dressed character in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8720XS-pquc\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">walk-off</a> of lethal fashion.</p>\n             <h2>Liz Spain</h2>\n\
  \             <p>Swashbucklers are generally a flouncy bunch, but <b>Jirelle</b>\
  \ pulls off an outfit that elevates practicality to fabulous. Eschewing the common\
  \ brown or black, Her studded leather jerkin and chaps are a sumptuous dark indigo\
  \ trimmed in gold, giving the impression of stars in a sea of midnight. Her tall\
  \ boots, practical for charging through rough underbrush or hiking rocky terrain,\
  \ punctuate her lithe elvenesque silhouette with cuffs that won't quit. Heck, even\
  \ her buckler is painted to match.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n              <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Jirelle.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Jirelle_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n              <br><em>Gorgeous but deadly.</em>\n             </div>\n  \
  \           <p>To top it all off, Jirelle rakishly dons a crimson worsted wool cloak\
  \ lined in gold silk. A bold color choice for the battlefield, the cloak can be\
  \ employed to distract enemies and entrap their weapons. Better yet, the cloak,\
  \ scarves, and long hair will flow as she turns to look amazing in any duel while\
  \ keeping enemy strikes from targeting the important squishy parts. After all, clothing\
  \ is a much a verb as a noun. Jirelle makes it work.</p>\n             <h2>Mike\
  \ Selinker</h2>\n             <p>As with all critical decisions, it is de rigueur\
  \ to approach the selection of the most fashionable character scientifically, rather\
  \ than through such fallible methods as \"personal taste\" and \"saying anything\
  \ to get the thumbscrews removed.\" I have devised an unassailable four-part methodology:</p>\n\
  \             <ol>\n              <li>Eliminate all monochrome outfits. Approximate\
  \ percentage of candidates remaining: 50%.</li>\n              <li>Eliminate overuse\
  \ of brown. Approximate percentage of candidates remaining: 15%.</li>\n        \
  \      <li>Eliminate visible belly buttons. Approximate percentage of candidates\
  \ remaining: 3%.</li>\n              <li>Of the remaining candidates, pick the one\
  \ that Liz Spain is most likely to dress as.</li>\n             </ol>\n        \
  \     <p>Thus, the only plausible answer is <b>Radillo</b>. Don't thank me. Thank\
  \ science.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n              <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/20150929-RadillloLiz.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150929-RadillloLiz_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n              <br><em>When Radillo says jump, you say, \"Yes ma'am.\"</em>\n\
  \             </div>\n             <h2>John Compton</h2>\n             <p>A character\
  \ with plenty of pockets, bells, whistles, and doodads is all well and good, but\
  \ what captures my imagination is a character whose dedication to an in-world ideal\
  \ is such that she tries to emulate it in flesh. As someone who is playing a cleric\
  \ of Nethys through the Mummy's Mask Adventure Path (RPG-style), and as someone\
  \ who really appreciates how our campaign setting presents the god of magic, I love\
  \ <b>Zarlova</b>'s personal sense of style.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n              <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-ZarlovaToken.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-ZarlovaToken_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n              <br><em>Dedication to god, dedication to style.</em>\n    \
  \         </div>\n             <p>Sure, plenty of Nethys's faithful worshippers\
  \ dress in black and white, representing the god's half-scorched, half-healthy body.\
  \ Zarlova has taken it a step further and paid someone to tattoo her right half\
  \ in bone-white patterns, shaving that side of her head just to show off the ink.\
  \ I also like how she's tossed aside the notion of a perfectly symmetrical black-and-white\
  \ garment and instead embraced diagonal swathes of color that are as unpredictable-yet-visually-appealing\
  \ as magic itself. Even her staff of two intertwined snakes shows off Nethys's dual\
  \ nature. When it comes to fashion, Zarlova's sensibilities are like her magical\
  \ prowess: unrivaled and the envy of all.</p>\n             <h2>Tanis O'Connor</h2>\n\
  \             <p>I'm going to cheat, unsurprisingly enough. My take is that the\
  \ best-dressed character in the game is the one wearing only his birthday suit.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Meet <b>Gronk</b>.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n              <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-Gronk.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-Gronk_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n              <br><em>He's... too sexy for his clothes...</em>\n        \
  \     </div>\n             <p>Though he occasionally spends time as an elf, Gronk\
  \ the druid knows his bark is better than his bite when he's in his woodsiest form.\
  \ No shirt, no shoes, no service necessary for this hunk of forest manliness. Who\
  \ needs a hat when your head can double as a piercing weapon? And his oaken codpiece\
  \ goes with everything!</p>\n             <p>You'll get the deets on the Gronky\
  \ goodness in next month's <a href=\"/products/btpy9dyj\"><em>Druid Class Deck</em></a>\
  \ preview.</p>\n             <h2>Brian Campbell</h2>\n             <p>My choice\
  \ is Wrathack. Wrathack has an axe that is actually two axes, because her weapon\
  \ has an axe at either end. Battleaxes deal a lot of damage, and she has two of\
  \ them forged together, which makes her double axe the best fashion accessory a\
  \ hero can have. Also, she's wearing bloody feathers that she ripped off the wings\
  \ of an angel, which is badass. And she's wearing armor, which is obviously better\
  \ than not wearing armor. I would like her outfit more if she wore more black, or\
  \ if it was stained with more blood, but the fact that she has more axes than any\
  \ other adventurer means that she wins.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ blood.</em>\n             </div>\n             <h2>Vic Wertz</h2>\n          \
  \   <p>Ranzak is the best-dressed character. (Parrots count as \"attire,\" yes?)</p>\n\
  \             <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n              <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-PR1_Ranzak.jpg\"\

  \     </div>\n             <h2>Keith Richmond</h2>\n             <p><b>Merisiel</b>\
  \ is a true mistress of fashion, from her peacock-like fan of shoulder knives down\
  \ to her meticulously worked leather boots.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n              <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6805-Merisiel.jpg\"\

  \ a dagger!</em>\n             </div>\n             <p>What other character has\
  \ so mastered the intricate accessorizing of blades, incorporating a full dozen\
  \ into her costume? Her dagger hilts even match her studded leather armor.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Merisiel employs a full array of colors, with rich red leather\
  \ armor, blue garments, gold threading, silver studs, black sheathes and straps,\
  \ and a dashing accent of green and yellow to catch the eye.</p>\n             <p>Those\
  \ familiar with Merisiel's abilities know, however, that her true strength is that\
  \ she is only seen when and where she can steal the show.</p>\n             <h2>Gaby\
  \ Weidling</h2>\n             <p>Feet feats! Gaby here with my picks for best footwear!\
  \ If you know me, you'll know I have a small shoe problem. I love shoes (particularly\

  \ person, I'm going to show a picture and you'll have to guess whose feet I've chosen.\

  \ green and they have some nice silver detailing. Luckily (or unluckily) I don't\

  \             <p>Just look upon it and marvel. What else could compare? Nothing\
  \ even comes close. It is splendiferous, after all. Look at how it completes Balazar's\
  \ look. Gaze in wonder as it sets off Padrig's scales. Truly it is the pinnacle\
  \ of magical haberdashery.</p>\n             <p>And not only is it awesome in its\
  \ majesty, but it is also said to be alive, and to counsel wise Balazar in his many\
  \ travels. What other mere accoutrements listed by others here can equal that feat?\
  \ None.</p>\n             <h2>Chad Brown</h2>\n             <p>Oddly enough, I picked\
  \ first (as far as I know, anyway), but I'm adding my section last. That's good\
  \ for me, because it lets me take a look at what my fellows have done. Let's see...\
  \ hmm...</p>\n             <p>Sorry, everyone; hats are great, but then you have\
  \ to decide between Balazar and Alahazra. Just like in Apples to Apples or Cards\
  \ Against Humanity, two good but very similar answers cancel each other out. Likewise,\
  \ all that footwear is awesome, but even Gaby can't pick just one (or two). Also,\
  \ despite what Tanis might try to tell you, \"wild shaped\" is not the same thing\
  \ as \"dressed.\" For all we know, Gronk is wearing mustard yellow spats and white\
  \ shoes—well into Lamashan, even!—underneath all that bark. Automatic disqualification\
  \ on account of not being dressed!</p>\n             <p>All that aside, there are\
  \ several good criteria listed, and one character who, in my opinion, excels across\
  \ the board: Olenjack, dwarven guild leader and pillar of the community. Awesome\
  \ coat, great styling. Beard jewelry—tasteful yet refined—alongside a respectable\
  \ amount of stabby. Plus, while Ranzak may have a parrot—excuse me, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhou\"\
  >a <em>Magic Bird</em></a>—even he doesn't have have a screaming howler monkey <em>wearing\
  \ a pirate hat</em> for a belt buckle.</p>\n             <p>As Olenjack might say,\
