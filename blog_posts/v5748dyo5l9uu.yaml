  \ Appendix – Erik Mona</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, February 16, 2009</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As was explained in my introductory blog post, the purpose of this series\
  \ is to create Paizo's very own Appendix N, a semi-comprehensive list of the books,\
  \ comics, movies, and roleplaying products that influenced each member of the Paizo\
  \ staff in their work on the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting. To begin this\
  \ series, there seemed no better place to start than with one of the original creators\
  \ of Golarion and the driving force behind <i>Planet Stories</i>, Erik Mona. He\
  \ had quite a bit to say. By the time we finished lunch, I had filled three complete\
  \ pages with notes and had been forced to finish transcribing the interview on a\
  \ napkin. Unfortunately (or fortunately as the case may be), the length of the interview\
  \ has forced us to break it into three parts. In this first installment, Erik reveals\
  \ which authors most influenced his idea for the general feel he wanted to give\
  \ Golarion.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>David</b>: What authors or titles\
  \ stand out to you as most influential on your game design and upon Golarion?</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Erik</b>: Robert E. Howard's <i>Conan</i> series, particularly the\
  \ collections of the original Conan stories that have been published by Del Rey—\
  <i>The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian</i>, <i>The Conquering Sword of Conan</i>—\
  those ones; Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Grey Mouser stories; Moorcock's Elric series;\
  \ China Miéville's stories, particularly <i>Perdido Street Station</i> and <i>The\
  \ Scar</i>; Jack Vance's 4-book Dying Earth series (which I think is now published\
  \ in a <i>Dying Earth</i> omnibus); C. L. Moore's <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8d\"\
  >Jirel of Joiry series </a>; Hugh Cook's 10-book series <i>The Chronicles of an\
  \ Age of Darkness</i>; H. P. Lovecraft; and Henry Kuttner's <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81tx\"\
  ><i>The Dark World</i></a> and <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8e\"><i>Elak\
  \ of Atlantis</i></a>.</p> \n     <p>A lot of these authors and titles influenced\
  \ the mood and tone of the setting, as far as being sword and sorcery stories. Michael\
  \ Moorcock's Elric series being the only exception, these stories feature protagonists\
  \ who are not superhuman; each is just a dude. It's like how Captain America is\
  \ a regular guy compared to the other Marvel superheroes—he can't fly and doesn't\
  \ have any remarkable powers. Batman obviously falls into this category as well.\
  \ The characters in these stories are powerful but not superhumanly so. More importantly,\
  \ almost, is the idea that the environment itself is the antagonist, and the characters\
  \ are exceptional—but otherwise ordinary—people who must fight back or the world\
  \ will destroy them.</p> \n     <p>Tolkien was an influence only so far as he influenced\
  \ D&amp;D. The world he created just didn't fit with what we were trying to do with\
  \ Golarion. To be honest, it is too hopeful, not grim enough. I asked Jason Bulmahn\
  \ when we were first creating Golarion, rhetorically, if it would be possible for\
  \ Paizo to build a world without gnomes, dwarves, elves, and the like. Of course\
  \ we immediately came to the conclusion that it would be impossible, but it gives\
  \ you an idea of what we were trying to achieve with Golarion.</p> \n     <p>Gary\
  \ Gygax's Gord the Rogue books were very influential in the way that they showed,\
  \ through storytelling and world-building, the sort of milieux that the inherent\
  \ style of a world governed by the game's rules. Even if used simply as a point\
  \ of departure, that's an invaluable resource. The early Thieves World anthologies\
  \ were also an influence, more in terms of style and world-view than anything else.\
  \ Greyhawk and Sanctuary are photocopies of Leiber's Lankhmar, and when it comes\
  \ to a location most exemplifying the fantasy RPG spirit, Lankhmar is the place.\
  \ </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Thus concludes the first part of my interview\
  \ with Erik and the first installment of <i>The Fabled Appendix</i>. Next time:\
  \ Erik discusses how Osirion and Cheliax were born, and the books and horrible vacations\
  \ that inspired their creation.</p> \n    <p>David Eitelbach<br> Editorial Intern</p>\
