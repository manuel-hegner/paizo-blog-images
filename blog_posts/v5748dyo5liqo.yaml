  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2016</a> is just\
  \ a little over a month away, and we're all busy making preparations for our favorite\
  \ convention of the year. Whether you're a first-time visitor to the Seattle area,\
  \ or a PaizoCon veteran, here's a few things to do in the area before, during, and\
  \ after the convention!</p> \n    <h2>Movement Speed</h2> \n    <p>If you are not\
  \ renting a car, and you're not using an allied NPC boon for local travel, the DoubleTree\
  \ Hotel is conveniently located right on the A Line Express of King County's Metro\
  \ bus system. Just up the street is also the light rail which leads directly to\
  \ downtown, which is going to be your best way to get to the sights of Seattle.\
  \ The most affordable way for out-of-town visitors to view the area is to pick up\
  \ a <a href=\"http://metro.kingcounty.gov/fares/index.html#types-of-fares\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Regional Day Pass</a>, which can be purchased at the light rail station\
  \ for $8 for unlimited rides (for fares up to $3.50). The challenge rating of facing\
  \ the local highway system is mighty—use public transportation and carpool as much\
  \ as possible! For planning out your travels, Google Maps and One Bus Away has been\
  \ the most reliable for public transportation arrival and departure times.</p> \n\

  \ \n    </div> \n    <h2>Gazetteer of Seattle</h2> \n    <p>When I first came to\
  \ live on the moister side of the Pacific Northwest, I had an excellent guide to\
  \ show me the way (thanks, Cosmo). Now I am passing on some of the locations that\
  \ I enjoy in the area, and if you are arriving early for PaizoCon, see the sights\
  \ of the Emerald City! A fair warning: Seattle is quite hilly, and some spots are\
  \ very steep. PaizoCon Founder Tim Nightengale recommends that you visit <a href=\"\
  http://www.seattleattractions.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seattle Premier Attactions</a>\
  \ for a broader overview of what you can see, but here are my favorites. </p>\n\
  \    <ul> \n     <li><strong><a href=\"http://pikeplacemarket.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Pike Place Market</a></strong>: In operation since 1907, this is a multi-level\
  \ market that you've probably seen on TV where the folks throwing the fish around.\
  \ It is less busy during the week before noon, so keep that in mind, and that you'll\
  \ want to bring cash here, as not all the places accept credit or debit card. If\
  \ you're a foodie, don't miss Beecher's Handmade Cheese, Daily Dozen Doughnut Company,\
  \ DeLaurenti, Ellenos Yogurt, Market Spice, Piroshky Piroshky, the \"original\"\
  \ Starbucks, and World Spice. There are dozens of different stores in Pike Place,\
  \ not to mention a comic book store—spend some time meandering!</li> \n     <li><strong><a\
  \ href=\"http://www.pioneersquare.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pioneer Square</a></strong>:\
  \ One of the oldest neighborhoods in Seattle, built in 1857, there is quite a bit\
  \ of local history to discover here, including King Street Station and the Klondike\
  \ Gold Rush National Historical Park. Don't miss the <a href=\"http://www.undergroundtour.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Underground Tour</a>!</li> \n     <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.seattleaquarium.org/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Seattle Aquarium</a></strong>: I have it on good authority from\
  \ an enthusiastic three year old that this is the best. Jellyfish, octopi, otters,\
  \ seals, tide pools and an underwater dome are some of the features here. Seagulls\
  \ can be seen all around Seattle for free!</li> \n     <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.seattlecenter.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Seattle Center</a></strong>: There are not one, but <em>multiple\
  \ things</em> to do in this encounter. The <a href=\"http://www.empmuseum.org/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">EMP Museum</a> is more than just music (though there is a lot\
  \ of that too, and the guitar exhibit is quite stunning), and the <a href=\"https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pacific Science Center</a> has multiple attractions (including\
  \ a <a href=\"https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/the-art-of-the-brick/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">LEGO® exhibit starting on May 28th</a>), and the Seattle Center is also\
  \ home to the <a href=\"http://www.spaceneedle.com/home/\" target=\"_blank\">iconic\
  \ Space Needle</a>. Whether or not Chihuly was contacted from Things Beyond Space\
  \ and Time is a matter of some debate, but <a href=\"http://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Chihuly Garden &amp; Glass</a> is full of inspirational mind-bending\
  \ art. The easiest way to get to the Seattle Center is by the Monorail from Westlake.\
  \ If you're planning on attending multiple museums at the Seattle Center or around\
  \ town, check out the <a href=\"http://www.citypass.com/seattle\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Citypass</a>!</li> \n    </ul> Other strong contenders for things to see and do\
  \ in Seattle: the International District, Ivar's, Molly Moon's Ice Cream, <a href=\"\
  http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Seattle Art Museum</a> (check\
  \ out the Roman glassware and Native American collections), Seattle Great Wheel,\
  \ and probably at least a dozen other places that I'm forgetting. If you get lost,\
  \ Pike and Pine streets are great fixtures to orient yourself, as is the Washington\
  \ State Convention Center and Westlake Center. In a pinch, just head downhill towards\
  \ the water.\n    <p></p> \n    <p>Many have asked this question, but this is a\
  \ good spot to say this again: we do not offer tours of the Paizo offices, sorry!</p>\

  \ \n    <h2>Local Eats</h2> \n    <p>Besides the DoubleTree Hotel's coffee stand,\
  \ breakfast buffet, and lounge, here are a few places to eat within walking distance\
  \ (half a mile) of the convention space. </p>\n    <ul> \n     <li>13 Coins Restaurant</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Dave's Diner &amp; Brews</li> \n     <li>Denny's</li> \n     <li>Gregory's\
  \ Bar &amp; Grill</li> \n     <li>Jack in the Box</li> \n     <li>L&amp;L Hawaiian\
  \ Barbecue</li> \n     <li>Mango Thai Cuisine &amp; Bar</li> \n     <li>Sharps RoastHouse</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Taco Bell</li> \n    </ul> \n    <h3>To the Market!</h3> \n    <ul>\
  \ \n     <li>Safeway, 21401 Pacific Highway South, Des Moines, WA 98198 (2.1 miles,\
  \ open 5am to 1am)</li> \n     <li>Safeway, 4011 S 164th St, Seattle, WA 98188,\
  \ (2.3 miles, open 24 hours)</li> \n     <li>QFC, 17847 1st Avenue South, Normandy\
  \ Park, WA 98148 (2.5 miles, open 24 hours)</li> \n    </ul> For other shopping\
  \ needs, the Westfield Southcenter Mall is four miles away (2800 Southcenter Mall,\
  \ Seattle, WA 98188), and is open 10am to 9pm, and includes a multiplex IMAX theater.\
  \ If you need non-emergency medical care, Immediate Clinic Burien (15870 1st Avenue\
  \ South, Burien, WA 98148; 8am to 8pm) and Concentra Urgent Care (545 Andover Park\
  \ W, Tukwila, WA 98188; 24 hours) are the closest.\n    <p></p> \n    <div class=\"\

  Let's Jam!</h2> \n    <p>Alright, it's convention time! I know you might not want\
  \ to hear it, but give yourself a little bit of extra time to prepare yourself and\
  \ get a bite and a cuppa joe in before your day starts. (And for all of the volunteers\
  \ that arise to run at this hour, thank you!) A little bit of courtesy goes a long\
  \ way, so please be kind to the hotel NPCs when gathering with your party. If this\
  \ is your first convention ever, well, thank you for picking ours! Here's a few\
  \ convention tips:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Wear comfortable, broken-in shoes,\
  \ and bring an extra pair. Your feet will thank you.</li> \n     <li>Bring extra\
  \ socks.</li> \n     <li>Stay hydrated—there is no substitute for water.</li> \n\
  \     <li>Bring a non-sugary snack to keep your energy levels up.</li> \n     <li>A\
  \ minimum of 3 hours of sleep, two real meals, and one shower. In the <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lds5\">words of Erik Mona</a>, \"Man cannot survive on gaming,\
  \ booze, and 5-Hour Energy alone (trust me, I've tried).\"</li> \n     <li>Don't\
  \ completely fill your schedule—give yourself some downtime.</li> \n     <li>Make\
  \ new friends.</li> \n     <li>For freelancers and would-be freelancers, bring a\
  \ business card (and leave some room to write notes on).</li> \n     <li>Don't forget\
  \ the dice.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p></p> \n    <h2>ConCrud</h2> \n    <p>It happens—\
  you know it, we know it. Wash your hands, cover your mouth, stay hydrated, eat proper\
  \ meals, get some rest—these give you a bonus to your Fortitude save to help from\
  \ spreading Urgathoa's touch.</p> \n    <p>Got any additional questions? Concerns?\
  \ Musings? Want to know other favorite haunts that we like? Ask away in the the\
  \ discussion thread!</p> \n    <p>Getting the dire ducklings in a row,</p> \n  \
