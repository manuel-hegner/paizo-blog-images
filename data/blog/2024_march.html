                <p>Like last year, parts of the show you know and love will remain free, but we’re continuing to have a ticketed event with community-run games and activities at the same time!</p>
                <p>What to look forward to this year!</p>
                <p>Some of you may have attended conventions hosted on Tabletop Events before, but many of us have not! If you haven’t, here’s how to get your badge for the show.</p>
                <ol>
                 <li>Visit the convention page at <a href="https://tabletop.events/conventions/paizocon-online-2024"><strong>https://tabletop.events/conventions/paizocon-online-2024</strong></a> (also linked at paizocon.com).</li>

                 </div>
                 <li>There should be one badge type listed: the Attendee badge. Click the green “Buy” button.</li>
                 <li>Enter your first and last name, as well as your Discord username. Your Discord username will <strong>never</strong> be shared publicly, and is just so we can assign you special roles on the Paizo Events Discord server.</li>
                 <ul>
                  <li>On this screen, you can also purchase a badge for a friend! Information on adding and purchasing badges for friends can be found <a href="https://help.tabletop.events/article/122-friends">on this page</a>.</li>

                <h2>Submitting Community Events</h2>
                <p>New this year, the community is able to submit events for inclusion in the PaizoCon Online schedule! These can be RPG events featuring Pathfinder or Starfinder, as well as other systems or even other types of games entirely! Want to introduce people to your favorite indie RPG? Looking for players for the new board game you just bought? Finally want to settle who the best Mario Karter in the community is? You can host all these events and more!</p>
                <ol>
                 <li>From the PaizoCon convention page, go to “Host” in the top bar, then click “Submissions.”</li>
                 <br clear="all">

                 </div>
                 <li>Click “New Submission” and choose an event type. For this explainer we’ll be using an RPG event, but most events will ask for the same or similar information.</li>
                 <li>Fill in the requested information! Let the staff and prospective attendees know as much as you can about the event you’re submitting. Once you’ve filled in the information, click Create!</li>
                 <li>After submission, staff will review events and either approve them (adding them to the schedule), contact you for more information, or reject them. We reserve the right to reject events for any reason.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>You can submit events any time before <strong>May 24, 2024</strong>. However, if you want your event to be on the schedule before it initially gets released, it must be submitted by <strong>March 28, 2024.</strong></p>
                <p>If you have any questions about event submission, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:paizocon@paizo.com">paizocon@paizo.com</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Other Activities</h2>
                <h3>Portfolio Reviews</h3>
                <p>After the success of last year’s Friday portfolio reviews, the Art team has added an extra day onto their review schedule! Portfolio reviews will remain free on a first-come, first-served sign up basis, but this year we’re giving ticket purchasers the chance to sign up early.</p>
                <p>If you’re interested in having your writing samples reviewed, we’re also offering writing reviews on Friday and Saturday this year as well!<br><br></p>
                <p>Stay tuned for more information and registration in the coming weeks!</p>
                <h3>Livestreams</h3>
                <p>Get ready for a weekend full of fantastic livestream programming including seminars, interviews, liveplays, and the annual weekend opening keynote on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo">Official Paizo Twitch channel</a>!</p>
                <p>Stay tuned for the full stream and activity schedule coming soon!</p>
                <h3>Friends of Paizo:</h3>
                <p>We’ll once again be joined by multiple friends of Paizo in the Discord this year! Chat with, ask questions of, and learn more about the amazing work of teams like BKOM Studios, Foundry VTT, Roll20, and more!</p>
                <p>Last year’s convention was entirely online, but this year we’re introducing <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sih9">PaizoCon@!</a> Our new pilot program allows you to experience PaizoCon in person with your fellow Pathfinders and Starfinders at participating local game stores!

Reactivating the maneuvering systems on the old rig sent out an alert and now a Confluence Agent has assembled a team of deep pressure specialists to retrieve the mining rig and learn what sent it plunging into the clouds.</p>

                <p>Greetings once again, Pathfinders!</p>
                <p>This month we’re diving deep into the Maze of the Open Road with two scenarios set inside that bizarre extraplanar transport hub. Between the return of two elemental planes and the efforts to stabilize the maze’s magic by setting new exits and entrances, it seems like some uninvited guests have made it in.</p>
                <p>First off, someone is sending agents astray. Landmarks and signposts are being moved around, fog is leading people off course, and other similar happenings are causing agents to exit at entirely wrong locations. While no one has been hurt, Venture-Captain Sigvard Tornkvist is at her wits end with these endless mix-ups. It’ll be up to you to find out what’s behind these odd pranks and put a stop to them. But who knows what could be behind all of this? I do have it on good authority that, if you play your cards right, you might end up in a dance-off.</p>

It’s up to you and your party to retune the keys and help anyone else who might have gotten caught up in the elemental chaos. Let’s hope that whatever Gedun and Yeyacha stole this time isn’t something super valuable to someone super powerful…</p>

                <h2>What is a Humble Bundle?</h2>
                <p>Bundles are limited-time collections of games, books, software, and more. Simply pay what you want and choose where your money goes, whether that be to the publisher, to Humble itself, or even to charity. Most bundles come in tiers starting at only $1—but the more you give, the more you get in exchange!</p>
                <p>When you make your purchase on Humble Bundle, you’ll receive a series of digital codes to redeem on the Paizo Store, one for each tier of unlocked products, plus at the $30 level, three additional codes to redeem on Foundry VTT.</p>
                <p>There are four tiers to this bundle, starting at $5 and going up to a $40 tier. It features the Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path in both PDF and as Foundry VTT modules, <em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em> in both PDF and physical hardcover, and the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Impossible Lands</em> world guide and more!</p>
                <p>A portion of your purchase goes to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF), whose mission is to prevent and cure breast cancer by funding the most promising medical research worldwide. It’s a great cause at any time, but especially during Women’s History Month.</p>
                <p>Our first Bundle tier starts at $5 and includes a code for four PDFs worth $45, including:</p>

                <h2>The “Death” of Zon-Kuthon</h2>
                <p>Shelyn has tried countless times to touch the heart of Zon-Kuthon, but in the end her music is what dooms the Midnight Lord. He’s long ignored his sister’s tears, no matter how they stream or pool, collecting any that he can and using them as salt to rub into followers’ wounds. Her pleading declarations he considers almost background noise, a counterpoint that makes the pain that echoes through the Netherworld sound that much more divine. But when she finds the beauty in the way his Kuthites scream and whimper, weaves together suffering into a string of rousing chords, builds melodies from dripping blood and rhythms from a clanging chain? Only she could find the art in all the suffering he wields, a dulcet murmuring that calls out from an orchestra of pain. <em>Dou-bral, brother, I love you still. Dou-bral, come back to me.</em></p>
                <p>With newfound strength, Dou-bral returns, soul breaking through its cage of bones and kicking out the usurper who’d lived beneath his skin. But even free he’s trapped inside a body built for cruelty, his face a mask of agony that tells a brutal story—scars and cries and sharpened blades, blood and tears and pain. The anguish he has known and caused, the torment Zon-Kuthon embraced—how can he reconcile himself with all he now remembers? He tries to flee back to his cell, to turn back into what he was, but Zon-Kuthon is memory now and only he remains.</p>
                <p>Dou-bral can feel divinity like sparks beneath his fingertips, but with all that he’s done and been, he cannot now reward himself and let himself play god. He takes the power in his hands (so good now at destroying things) and rips it from his very being, leaving something more than man but less than deity. He stumbles from the Netherworld, his ears ringing with tortured screams (most of which are not his own), and makes his way to Pangolais, as if Zon-Kuthon’s capital will help him understand the things his other self has done. And when Shelyn walks next to him, her arm outstretched in kindness, the glaive she’d taken from him offered up with open hands, he turns his back and walks away, her music souring in his ears, reminding him of every chain he used to break their father.</p>
                <p>Art and beauty pay a price for all that Shelyn’s sacrificed—the nightmares that disturbed her rest as she crafted a song of pain, the knowledge that Dou-bral is back but still wrapped up in suffering, the loss she feels from victory that’s nothing like she’d hoped. In theaters and galleries, on stage and page and instrument, creative minds start struggling—the colors dim, the music fades, the movements don’t flow smoothly—and lovers’ disillusions grow as nothing feels the way it was, until the disappointment drives some life-long pairs apart, an echo of a sadness that she cannot seem to shake.</p>
                <p>Dou-bral’s other flesh and blood, the spirit-wolf turned Prince in Chains, roams the grounds of Xovaikain, trying to fill the absence that his son has left behind. But for all his vicious howling, what is left of Thron is not a god, and soon two new contenders come with plans to claim the Netherworld—Asmodeus who wants to bring new pain to the unworthy, adding a few new items to the tools he has for torment, and Iomedae, who seeks to free the souls still left within the realm, turning their search for pain into a sacrifice for glory. Neither willing to back down, they fortify positions, preparing for a battle that will change the Netherworld.</p>
                <p>Far from the squabbling of the gods, Dou-bral travels through Nidal, hoping that he will find some path to redemption. Instead, he watches Cheliax, no longer held by ancient pact to stay within its borderlines, begin to take Nidalese lands, while members of the Umbral Court each claim to be Zon-Kuthon’s heir and stab each other in the back to claim his legacy.</p>

                <p><em> I will be completely honest here: Zon-Kuthon terrifies me! Always has. And yet this prophecy wasn’t scary at all. At least not to me. My Lady, I know, fears little, but I have been feeling the whole set of emotions during these annotations—terrified one minute and smiling the next. I truly thought I would be shivering after reading this, but I think I feel more sad than anything. Miss Shelyn trying so hard to free her brother and achieving her goal, only for him to reciprocate no love? It almost reminds me of my role in collecting these prophecies. I have wanted to be a part of something big to show my Lady how I can be of help to her for some time, and yet that means collecting a group of so-called prophecies that could be devastating in the wrong hands. It is odd to think of the gods having the same types of problems that the rest of us sometimes do. We revere them, and yet, especially as I read these prophecies, they seem more… mortal somehow? Or not. I hope that doesn’t sound too disrespectful. Best to leave this line of thought behind and move on to the next prophecy.</em></p>

                <p itemprop="description">After a lovely day and night spent in the river canyons, it was time for our next adventure. “What do you think?” I asked Lythea the next morning, spreading the rough map of the coastline that we’d pieced together out on the table in the galley. “The cartography of this region is incomplete, but my notes suggest that several migratory species congregate in and below the cliffs along the shoreline, somewhere—” I gestured diffidently with a claw. “—near here?”</p>
                <p>She laughed at my hopeful expression, the water gently sloshing in the supramarine chair she affectionately called her “Little Sea” as she leaned forward and scrutinized my attempts at map-making, tracing the jagged lines with her finger. “We’ll aim for here,” Lythea said, her tone decisive, “and then work our way up the coast if we need to. No need to worry, Baranthet.”</p>
                <p>“There’s occasionally some need,” I protested as Grefu approached, his finned arms delicately balancing several platters. “Here, let’s clear some space.”</p>
                <p>Our stoic cook grunted his thanks as we swept the papers away and helped him unload the eclectic breakfast he’d prepared. We left the menu up to him, but he always seemed to find a way to accommodate everyone’s favorites (today’s breakfast included multi-seed scones for me and seaweed wraps for Lythea, among other delicacies). The others joined us shortly thereafter: Dr. Pom emerging from her cabin and blinking in the bright sun; Telero and Chari putting away their spyglass and sketchbook, respectively, as they returned from vantage points at the prow; Ten scuttling down from the central mast to arrive before the others and take first pick of the bounty. Grefu’s eyes twinkled as the young surki loaded their plate with one of everything and tucked in, their mandibles moving with wordless delight.</p>
                <p>Lythea and I continued to discuss our plans as the others settled in. “With fair winds, it should only take a few hours, but... I’m not sure the weather will hold,” she said, evaluating the horizon with a critical eye.</p>
                <p>Grefu politely refrained from smoking his coral pipe during mealtimes, but he was never without it, and now he gestured toward the clouds with it in hand. “She’s right. Storm’s movin’ in.”</p>
                <p>This succinct observation complete, he stood and began clearing plates as I looked anxiously at Lythea. “The winds will guide us either way. There’s no cause for concern,” she reiterated with a smile.</p>
                <p>Several hours later, I certainly felt there was a cause or two as I clung to the controls on the exterior deck, rain stinging my face. I much would have preferred, dear reader, to pilot the ship from the safety of the main bridge, the <em>Zoetrope's</em> sturdy panes shielding us from the elements, but some curious property of the storm had rendered our instruments erratic and unreliable, leaving us no choice but to conduct an open-air reading. Lythea watched the clouds and the sea below us with unflappable focus, fiercely calling directions over the thunder snatching at her words. But our navigator’s faith in our trusty ship and crew was not misplaced, and—trembling a bit from the effort, but still upright—I managed to set us down precisely where she wanted us with only minimal mishaps.</p>
                <p>As I unclipped my safety line and sagged against the helm to catch my breath, Ten scampered by on their way to the engine room, looking as though they’d just had the time of their life despite an obvious abrasion on their arm. Grefu soon joined us, his coral pipe clenched in his mouth, and passed over a thermos of giant swordfish soup. I let the spicy aroma soothe my frayed nerves and permitted myself a moment to reminisce about the thunderstorms I watched in my youth with my pet protoceratops, Lin, my grandmother’s stew simmering away as she told us of the wardens.</p>
                <p>Grefu’s gruff voice broke my reverie. “Nice flyin’, you two.”</p>
                <p>I toasted him with the thermos. “Excellent cooking. Soup during a storm, imagine!”</p>
                <p>He nodded, silently accepting the compliment, but his eyes were on Lythea, who’d accepted a thermos of her own but was staring off at the water.</p>
                <p>“Lot of memories in storms,” he said, his voice gentle. “Lot of stories. This recipe was born in one, you know.”</p>

                <br>
                <p>Grefu leaned against the control panel, adjusting the satchel of herbs and salts that was always at his hip. His gaze as faraway as Lythea’s, he ventured, “Several generations back, my community was in a great famine. The matriarch of our clan had led us well for many years, but she was old and tired, and so we were looking for new leadership—normally a celebrated transition, but a grim one this time.</p>
                <p>“My great-grandmother knew one good hunt could see us through. No one had ever dared to face the legendary swordfish lurking in the depths, beyond the coral walls of our home. Still, she was hopeful it could feed us for many seasons if she could only catch and prepare it properly.”</p>
                <p>I was lucky the thermos was keeping my soup warm, because I had completely forgotten about it, so enraptured was I in Grefu’s story! Lythea, too, seemed to be hanging on every word.</p>
                <p>Grefu blinked in that slow, measured way of his and continued. “She organized a group of our finest eel riders, even recruiting some from a nearby community, and set off into the dark. I imagine it must have been a terrific battle. But they returned, bearing the great beast—and she prepared and served it for her ascension feast, when the village unequivocally nominated her as our matriarch’s successor.”</p>
                <p>“She sounds like an inspiring woman,” Lythea said, a small but genuine smile brightening her face. “Do you miss your family, Grefu?”</p>
                <p>He considered this a moment. “It’s natural to do so, when you leave a close-knit community,” he said finally. “And I do. But they’re with me still, when I make a family recipe or repair the same nets their hands worked before mine.”</p>
                <p>“Have either of you considered writing down some of your family’s stories?” I asked, ever the librarian.</p>
                <p>“I sing of mine,” Lythea said, shaking her head. “That’s what keeps them close, for me.”</p>
                <p>Grefu seemed to agree. “That’s more your wheelhouse, Baranthet—or Charikleia’s. Though I’ve thought about putting together a recipe collection, maybe.”</p>
                <p>“A cookbook!” I was delighted. “Oh, you must—I’ve never eaten so well in my life as I have on this voyage.”</p>
                <p>He huffed in amusement. “We’ll see. Maybe our navigator here can help me find a few of the rarer ingredients I’ve been missin’.”</p>
                <p>Lythea’s lyrical laugh filled the bridge as she clinked her thermos to ours. “I’m always up for a dive!”</p>

                <p>Hello again, explorers! Today, we take a look at some of the aquatic content coming in <em> Howl of the Wild</em>: the athamaru ancestry and the merfolk ancestry! First are athamarus, Grefu’s amphibious people, who sculpt coral, communicate (and defend themselves) via scent, and practice eel rearing. Athamaru eel riders are a fearsome force, and your character can saddle up and lead the charge with abilities like Riptide Mount!</p>
                <p><u></u></p>
                <h3><u>RIPTIDE MOUNT [one-action] — FEAT 5</u></h3>
                <p></p>
                <p><b>Athamaru</b><br><b><u>Requirements</u></b><u> You are underwater and adjacent to a creature that is at least one size larger than you, has a swim Speed, and is willing to be your mount.</u><br></p>
                <p>After working with aquatic beasts of burden for years, you have learned how to easily mount and dismount them. You Mount the creature and Command an Animal to issue it an order of your choice.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a merfolk, Lythea has quite the voice. Merfolk are one of the most magical ancestries coming in <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, with abilities like manipulating water, cursing sailors, or turning their tears to pearls. But a merfolk’s most famous ability is their enchanting song—quite literally with the Siren Song feat!</p>
                <h3><u>SIREN SONG [three-actions] — FEAT 9</u></h3>
                <p><b>Auditory, Mental, Merfolk, Primal</b><br><b>Frequency</b> once per day<br></p>
                <p><u><b>Prerequisites</b> expert in Performance</u><br>
                  You can beguile and bewitch with your song. All creatures in a 60-foot emanation must attempt a Will save against your Performance DC. On subsequent rounds, you can Sustain the song, causing each creature in the area currently affected by your song to attempt another Will save. Typically, creatures that have traveled with you for a significant time, such as your fellow party members, are immune to your Siren Song.</p>
                <p><b>Critical Success</b> The target is unaffected and becomes immune to your Siren Song for 24 hours.<br><b>Success</b> The target is fascinated with you until the end of your next turn.<br><b>Failure</b> As success, and the target is stupefied 1 for as long as it’s fascinated.<br><b>Critical Failure</b> As success, and the target is stupefied 2 for as long as it’s fascinated.</p>

               <p>It’d be silly not to mention that our CEO and Founder, Lisa Stevens, is a prominent woman in the TTRPG community and has been a cornerstone of Paizo since the beginning.

               <h3>Caryn DiMarco, she/they</h3>
               <p>You may have seen my name on PFS scenarios or in Lost Omens Highhelm—or on some soon-to-be-released products! I am so proud of this achievement, but when I'm not writing for Pathfinder, I obviously do play a lot of Pathfinder. This includes Pathfinder Society (forever GMs unite) and one question that's always on my mind is how to make sure every player feels welcome at our games.&nbsp;</p>
               <p><br>
                I've been at a lot of tables where I'm the only member of a certain group, and that's never a fun situation to be in. But often it's the only way to get more people to show up. I want to thank everyone who's signed up for a table or showed up to GM despite being a minority in their community; it's always a risk, but it's work that makes this community more welcoming for the rest of us. If this doesn't apply to you, I hope you walk up to each table with the goal of getting to know all the players and doing your part to create a safe and welcoming environment for them.&nbsp;</p>
               <p><br>
                Pathfinder is a game for everyone, but it takes everyone's effort to make that true.&nbsp;</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, credited as Sasha Laranoa Harving (nov/nov and dune/dune)</h3>
               <p>To advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the world of women is a difficult topic to broach. I am, personally, as a tall butch nonbinary lesbian who underwent estrogenizing hormone treatments for several years, and who has felt like a boy and a girl and a woman and am none now... am not often advocated for in the inclusion of.</p>
               <p>I feel like when people aim to include women, they want to say that anyone who considers themself a woman is welcome. Often, I’ve seen them explicitly turn away trans women who are not able to safely come out for having some facial hair, or implicitly for not speaking the same language as the majority at the function by not having interpreters, or for being disabled by being in a venue with three steps up.</p>
               <p>This is me saying to include them. Include everyone affected by misogyny. Fight the venue to get a ramp put in. Yell when they don’t want to spend money for an interpreter. If you have any form of privilege, weaponize it for those without.</p>
               <p>We do not win alone. And there will come a day when our voices demand more attention than their silence.</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Sara Jeffers (she/they)</h3>
               <p>Sara Jeffers (she/they) is an Indigenous Two Spirit game designer and graphic designer who utilizes traditional Salish art and storytelling structures to help de-colonize game design and add to the growing representation of First Nations and Indigenous North Americans in the industry. They also professionally GM a number of systems and games, focusing on combining horror with wholesome. When not writing or playing TTRPGs, Sara can be found hanging out with the coolest kids on the planet (theirs) and watching Bluey.&nbsp;</p>
               <p>Their previous published work includes Starfinder Bounty #10 and several solo TTRPGs available on&nbsp;<a href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a>. She is currently writing a full level 1-20 campaign for Pathfinder Second Edition and starting production on a murder mystery Actual Play set in the world of Thedas. Her most recent graphic and motion design work can be seen on an upcoming Thirsty Sword Lesbians Actual Play on Enchanting Sorcery Productions on Twitch and YouTube.</p>
               <p>In the future, Sara wants to be part of the movement in the TTRPG industry that leads towards something more exciting and less problematic than 4X play.</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Lynne M. Meyer (she/they)</h3>
               <p>Hello! I’m Lynne, one of Paizo’s editors. I’m a queer femme and an advocate for inclusive games. For over a decade, I worked in higher education as an interfaith and DEI educator—a role that included developing and implementing training programs for students and staff, and directly supporting students of all genders and sexual orientations.</p>
               <p>This background now informs what I do in the gaming industry.</p>
               <p>I'd been a player for many years, but it was a 2018 call for contributors to what would become&nbsp;<em>Uncaged Anthology</em>&nbsp;that inspired me to start writing for TTRPGs. An anthology of one-shots, each centered on a feminist reimagining of a traditionally female mythological archetype and its origins? I had to do it! I battled my fear and pitched an adventure. Almost everyone on the team was of a marginalized gender, and the support we gave (and still give) each other was life changing. For most of us, it was the first time we’d experienced anything like that.</p>
               <p>I then helped edit all the subsequent&nbsp;<em>Uncaged</em>&nbsp;books. That work led to more projects, and more opportunities to grow my skills. Eventually, that led me to Paizo!</p>
               <p>Find me on Bluesky (@lynnemeyer.bsky.social) and Twitter (@Lynne_M_Meyer).</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Elizabeth V Nold (she/her)</h3>
               <p>Hello! My name is Betsy (she/her) and I am a player, GM, and freelance writer of TTRPGs. I most recently got to work on [redacted], but, in the meantime, you can check out my work on the <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-05: Inheritor's Rite</em> or <em>Pathfinder Bounty 7: Cleanup Duty</em>. I have also written for the Shadowrun system and contributed to the <em>Attitude</em> sourcebook.</p>
               <p>&nbsp;I began my TTRPG adventure when my friend bought an AD&amp;D book for $1.00 at a yard sale. I did not realize until years later how rare my all-girl group was at the time. In my 30+ years playing, GMing, and writing for games, I have seen women go from being a minority to being a common sight. Gaming has given me many opportunities. I have learned that I can write. Through GMing, volunteering as a Venture Officer, and helping to organize Paizo Organized Play Games Conventions (come say hi at Origins), I have learned to be confident in my abilities and how to convey that confidence.</p>
               <p>Thanks to all the strong women and allies who have come before that made this possible for me. I hope that I can help keep the progress moving forward.</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Jessica Redekop (she/they/he)</h3>
               <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Redekop (she/they/he), and I was one of two women with a cover credit on <em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>. Women play games and belong in the gaming industry.</p>

               <br>
               <p>Around May of last year, we shared a preview for the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sial?Remaster-Previews-Dragons-Most-Diabolical">diabolic dragon</a> (the first dragon preview blog!). We are only just now getting around to their divine counterparts, the empyreal dragons. These dragons are connected to the plane of Heaven. They’re majestic beings with large, powerful frames and golden scales. Unsurprisingly, their divine nature grants them a breath that unleashes spirit damage with holy sanctification.</p>
               <p>Their most noticeable feature is the golden halo that rests above their heads. This halo radiates an inspiring aura that grants allies benefits to saving throws and skills checks. Depending on the power of the empyreal dragon, the dragon can make use of additional abilities that originate from this halo. Some empyreal dragons can create a healing pulse that restores other creatures within the aura’s area. Others use their divine power to push creatures away. Particularly powerful empyreal dragons can even impose a mental burden on creatures in the area, causing them to become slowed. Thankfully, an empyreal dragon chooses who is or isn’t affected by these abilities so they can strategically help allies and hinder foes. The dragon can also deploy the halo, directing it to a nearby area and causing the aura to move with it. This allows an empyreal dragon to help or hinder from afar while focusing on a separate part of the battlefield.</p>
               <p>All of these abilities complement empyreal dragons’ benevolent natures. They are compassionate beings who go out of their way to protect others. They even make their lairs particularly accessible, knowing that nearby innocents might someday make use of the treasures within. It’s not unlikely for an empyreal dragon’s lair to contain a multitude of magical armaments so that nearby innocents can stumble upon them in times of need.</p>
               <p>That’s our look at the empyreal dragon! We’re just about finished with our look at the dragons from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core"><em>Monster Core</em></a>, which releases in just a few weeks. We have one last dragon to preview for everyone. As has been foretold, we will take a look at the omen dragon in our final blog. See you then!</p>

               <h2>Massacre on the Hill — Severe 3</h2>
               <p itemprop="description">This encounter takes place in the small town of Navendale at the base of the Aspodell Mountains in Andoran not far from the Cheliax border. Your PCs could be passing through town or restocking and relaxing between adventures. Navendale is small, but it gets a fair number of travelers. One of the draws is the Red Rose Refuge, a popular lodge perched high on a rocky peak overlooking the town. The Refuge, as the locals call it, is known for having musicians play nearly every night, and tonight the famed Brastlewark Trio are performing.</p>
               <p>The PCs are in the town square below when a stableboy comes running down the steep road to the Refuge shouting for any attention he can gather. He heads straight for the PCs and says, “Hey! You! You gotta help! It’s real bad up there!” If he’s calmed and asked what’s going on, he continues, “I was working in the stables brushing the horses when all of a sudden they got spooked, and then a real bad stink rose up. I nearly urped; smelled like when you stumble across a dead goat out on the mountainside. Then I heard all the yelling and screaming. A couple people stumbled out into the snow all bloody. You gotta get up there and do something!”</p>
               <p>The PCs can run up the steep road and get to the Refuge in about two minutes. When the PCs arrive, the first thing they encounter is a stench of death carried on the cold spring wind. The Refuge’s door hangs open and the sounds of gruff voices, sobbing cries, and violence spill from the doorway. Inside, tables sit askew, and chairs are sprawled out on the floor amid broken pottery mugs and shattered glass. Over a dozen bodies lie slumped and bloody on the floor.</p>
               <p><strong>Map:</strong> This map showcases a portion of the upcoming <em>Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Showtime Multi-Pack</em>, out next month on Paizo.com or your local hobby store!</p>
               <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> Forced from their warrens, this group of ghouls has been wandering the countryside to find a new home. They’ve also grown hungry, and instead of hunting in town, they decided to target the remote Red Rose Refuge. They slinked out of the woods, passing by the stables before entering the Refuge.</p>
               <p>They immediately attacked anyone they could reach, killing a dozen staff and patrons before cornering the frightened gnome singers on the stage. Three of the ghouls have the performers restrained while they whisper into their ears using Ghoul Whispers, while the other three are feeding on their fresh kills so they can use Grave Knowledge to help them find new warrens under an old boneyard. As the PCs enter the room, all six turn their attention to the door and bare their teeth.</p>

               <p>The ghoul can instead automatically learn something specific known by a creature it consumed in the last 7 days, like the location of a hidden treasure or the name of a loved one.

               <p itemprop="description">Welcome to the <strong><a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/Starfinder_FieldTest_4.pdf">fourth Starfinder Second Edition Field Test</a></strong>!</p>
               <p>As the Starfinder team prepares for the launch of the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">Starfinder Second Edition Playtest</a> later this summer, we’re releasing small snapshots of our work in progress. So far, we’ve previewed the soldier class, a couple of ancestries, and the mystic. Be sure to check out those Field Tests if you haven’t already! We appreciate all the discussion and hype around the Field Tests, which energizes and motivates our creative processes even more than coffee does (if you can believe it).</p>
               <p><br>
                Speaking of motivation, Field Test #4 previews Starfinder’s “team player” and “party leader” class, the envoy! Inside, you’ll find our thoughts on the envoy’s role and capabilities, and an alpha version of the first 5 levels of the class, just like our earlier class previews. While you may have seen the envoy in action during the Starfinder team’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm6g2MYVUCw">livestream playtest</a> in October, or perhaps you were lucky enough to play a demo at a recent convention, this is your chance to see the actual draft of the class!</p>
               <p>Oh, and did I mention new art? I’m sure you’ve met our iconic envoy, Navasi!</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div>
               <br>
               <p>So, what’s the envoy all about? They’re a Charisma-based class, and the Starfinder team generally thinks of envoys as “support” characters, though they’re quite likely to play a leadership role, whether as a mover and shaker in your campaign, as a “party leader” or “face” for the rest of the player characters, or all the above! For envoys in Second Edition, we’re trying a brand new mechanic in the form of “envoy directives.” These abilities—some of which you get automatically, and others which you can select as envoy feats—give some direction to the envoy’s allies and grant the envoy and their allies a small benefit for following through on the orders. Directives have a variety of uses, from singling out targets with “Get ‘Em!” to hustling the team into a better tactical position with “Get in There!” Envoys can also “lead by example,” following their own directive to grant everyone an additional bonus for the round. Combined with numerous other feats that grant envoys combat options (like doling out temporary Hit Points, buffs, and debuffs), the ability to wield awesome sci-fi weapons, and several unique reactions, envoys have a satisfying and flexible action economy. Every team will be happy to have an envoy along, and your ability to build an envoy character to fit a variety of party roles means your envoy will always have a team to call their own!</p>

               <br>
               <p>Envoys must be ready for anything, from performing community service to battling whatever horrifying creatures Thurston decides to throw at the rest of the team during internal playtests! So far, we think envoys are a blast to play. They almost always have time to get into a good position on the battlefield while consistently dishing out damage, granting benefits to their allies, and tackling unexpected situations with their variety of skills and adaptive skill feats. Sometimes a single turn for an envoy has a major impact on a fight, such as by repositioning the entire team after a nasty ambush. We’d love your feedback on how envoys play at your table, especially in different team compositions—or with multiple envoys in the same party!</p>
               <p>So, what’re you waiting for? Get in there and read that field test! Finally, if you’re hoping to catch more snippets of the playtest, stay tuned for announcements about future playtest livestreams. We’ve still got more to show you between now and the playtest release at GenCon!</p>

               <p><em>Perhaps the author of these works is no prophet at all, but someone who seeks to weaken what we understand of divinity. I am not certain who or what would seek that as an outcome, but any entity that benefits from faltering faith is one that cannot have the best interests of Golarion at heart. Still, if I am being candid, the thought of some mysterious villain appeals to me more than it probably should. Perhaps I simply wish to find a reason for these prophecies outside of any potential truth I might find in their pages. Or perhaps I have stumbled onto a workable theory. I will note the thought, but only as one of many I might bring to my Lady. False comfort can too often be found within visions of conspiracy.</em></p>

               <h2>The Death of Nethys</h2>
               <p>Mind. Matter. Spirit. Life. Four essences. Four building blocks. Four cornerstones whose intersections shape the way that magic works. And in that four, two pairs that are too different to be joined together. Matter never blends with Spirit; Mind and Life remain apart. Nethys knows the truth of this, but never quite believes it fully. (Is he not the proof that there is power in duality?)</p>
               <p>As the centuries progress, he keeps returning to this quandary, tells himself that he alone can meld the two opposing pairs. He can be the font of knowledge. He can give the world new magic. He can take the contradictions, put them through a transformation. He can start two new traditions. Mind and Body. Heart and Soul.</p>
               <p>Does he succeed? Perhaps he does. Perhaps he stands awash with pride, his fingers trembling at the feeling, ready to share something of the magic he has wrought. But if he feels triumphant, it is only for a moment—a breath of jubilation as he soaks himself in magic, followed by a cry of horror as his body falls apart. Nethys, by sheer will and power, holds himself together briefly, fractures crawling down his arms, breaking him to pieces like a chunk of splintered glass. He remains alive just long enough to see the power of his folly, spreading from his fingers to the very building blocks of magic, tearing them asunder as his body turns to ash.</p>
               <p>In an instant, magic changes—bends and rips and stretches thin, settling like a shredded cloth pulled tight across the world. Where it is torn, all magic ceases. Long-held items lose their power. Spells are nothing more than words. Spellcasters within these hollows lose all tether to their magic, even if they only cross the boundary in the aftermath. Some regain their skills with time, but others never quite recover, every magic word they utter turned to dust between their lips. Some don’t even make it that far, dying when the magic ends, falling from the skies above, losing shields that keep them safe, gulping down a healing potion turned to flavored water.</p>
               <p>At first, the new uncertainty inspires mass devotion, but there is little solace from the other gods. Pharasma asks for a report. Irori swears to make it right. Their followers still cannot cast a single spell within the hollows. And those who lose the taste for magic, prayers dying in their mouth? They do not seem to gain a thing from all their dedication.</p>
               <p>For those who never cared for magic, hollows are a place of refuge, leveling the playing field in favor of the fist and sword. Many flock who follow Nethys, loyal to his knowledge still, believing this to be some test that leads them to a new reward.</p>
               <p>Many on Golarion relocate from their hollowed homes, fearing what it means to lose the magic in their lives. But travel is no easy thing, not even with the scout and map and herbal kits (now free of magical augmentations) that have become requirements for any trip outside. Rumors abound of hidden dangers scattered through the Great Beyond: places where the magic varies, strong one day and weak the next, turning one night’s cantrip to the morning’s deadly strike; villages consumed by all the magic stolen from the world, drowning in a power they have no way to unmake.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Magic is so fundamental to our reality that the thought of its absence or unreliability on a multiplanar scale is nearly as unfathomable as the concept of Nethys’s own ambition being magic’s undoing!</p>
               </div>
               <br>
               <p><em>Magic has never been among my preferred subjects to study, but I now wish I’d learned more of it! It would help me to properly evaluate what, if anything, within this prophecy is truly feasible. Could one death (even the death of a god) create this level of chaos within such a fundamental part of life? This prophecy seems to indicate that magic is forever changed by Nethys’s actions, but even a disaster of the magnitude described seems unlikely to change fundamental principles of magic (a statement I would be much more convinced of were I sure that I fully understood them). While I doubt that this prophecy would come true, I am now curious if there are any projects that Nethys has undertaken that might lead to his attempting something on this scale. Perhaps I judged too quickly, and these are less dastardly plot than desperate warning? I need more information to be sure.</em></p>

              <blockquote>
               <p itemprop="description">“To the left!”</p>
               <p>“His stomach’s open!”</p>
               <p>“Pin him down, pin him down!”</p>
               <p>The basher arcade was filled with battle cries and frenzied advice from spectators as servers smoothly weaved between groups with cheap drinks for their patrons. Students from all over the city crowded every corner, cheering and booing each game’s combatants. Soo-jin took a long sip of tea, wincing at the strong aftertaste as onlookers shouted at the small figures projected in the middle of their table.</p>
               <p>“Get him!” one of the boys from Sage Plum Academy cried as an alley basher kicked her opponent in the head. “To the right, to the right!”</p>
               <p>The tiny figures clashed again, fists flying as their players maneuvered them to victory. Nga’s eyes were locked onto the projections as she rolled her fighter into a defensive position, raising his arms to shield his chest. Her opponent grinned, his hands deftly moving levers while his fighter pressed in with punches and kicks.</p>
               <p>Soo-jin watched the brawl with gritted teeth, waggling her fingers nervously. One boy’s eyes met hers and he pointed a finger at the <em>SPELLS ARE CHEATING </em>sign; irritated, Soo-jin raised her hands and pointedly showed they were free of magic auras before setting them on the table.</p>
               <p>The opposing fighter grabbed Nga’s by the waist. Soo-jin’s nails now clacked against the table in a nervous drum beneath the frenzied shouts for a finishing blow. With a smirk, Nga flipped a lever, and her fighter’s elbow smashed downward, his leg swooping up into a powerful kick. There was a shout—a blare of music—and Soo-jin jumped so fast her chair fell over.</p>
               <p>Nga beamed triumphantly as the Sage Plum boy groaned, his friends laughing and sighing at his loss. Nga’s tiny fighter raised his fist, roaring silently in victory, and illusory fireworks exploded across the table to illuminate expressions of both dismay and glee around the table.</p>
               <p>“Pay up, all!” Soo-jin laughed. Groans echoed above the victory music, followed by the clink of coins falling into her purse as she collected her friend’s winnings. Another round was suggested and a new challenger was already settling into the open seat, cracking their knuckles dramatically as the battle music started back up. Soo-jin cast a quick cantrip over the purse, checking the total, before nodding a quick farewell to the other students and following Nga toward the exit.</p>

               <br>
               <p>The heavy scent of cheap tea and fried snacks gave way to the aroma of hot buns and saucy chicken. The sun was bright outside the basher arcade, the shouts of stall vendors replacing the cheers of students. Tired laborers grumbled about the lack of progress on the Surepath highway while young children ran past, yelling about spotting a sundaflora in the gardens. A girl from Soo-jin’s cram school waved politely from a shop known for its buns; Soo-jin awkwardly waved back, trying and failing to remember anything except that the girl had a duck as a familiar.</p>
               <p>Nga and Soo-jin walked leisurely to their usual kopi-tiam, greeting Uncle Moon as the smell of coffee wafted toward them. Uncle Moon shouted a greeting back, merrily flipping hot taiyaki from a pan into a wax paper bag. Momo slept peacefully on the counter, purring with one small paw curled protectively over a copper piece.</p>
               <p>“May I take your order?” a short tengu server asked as they sat down.</p>
               <p>“Two taiyaki, one Xa Hoi coffee, and—” Soo-jin looked over the menu, and something newly added distracted her from her usual order “—one sparkle tea, please.” The server nodded and shuffled off, stopping to check on another customer. Soo-jin added the day’s total to a column in her notebook. “We’re so close, Nga. Just a few more silver pieces and we’re set!”</p>
               <p>“I’m getting paid for tutoring on Moonday, so you can add that to our current amount.” Nga accepted the arriving tray from the server and took a leisurely sip of coffee. “You know, if <em>you </em>would take up tutoring—”</p>
               <p>“I would rather let Mogaru eat me.” Soo-jin looked out the window. It hadn’t been that long since the giant monster’s attack, but she could scarcely see the water for all the bamboo scaffolding that had sprouted up in the aftermath. The city would be back, bigger than ever, in no time.</p>
               <p>“Come on! Everyone wants a Willow Branch student to teach their kids, you’d make enough money for a concert ticket after a week.”</p>
               <p>“You’re just as good as any twig,” Soo-jin scoffed, biting into her taiyaki and regretting it immediately as piping hot red bean paste scalded her mouth. She gasped, huffing desperately to try and cool down. Momo opened a judgmental eye from the counter. “You should try to test into another school.”</p>
               <p>“As much as my parents would love for me to become a ‘twig,’ I’d rather be the best where I am than become average at a fancy academy.” Nga took a smug sip. “Unlike you, I’m in the top ten in my class.”</p>
               <p>“Well, Miss Top Ten, keep up the good work and we’ll get our concert tickets in no time.”</p>
               <p>Soo-jin’s eyes swept past Nga’s head to the wall of advertisements behind her, lingering on a poster announcing the upcoming Shining Crystal Muses concert in celebration of Harmonious Spring. Vivid ink paintings of the four Muses reached out to a prism floating above them, enchanted pigments creating tiny flecks of rainbow light that danced across the poster. Even in an ink portrait, Haru’s handsome face stood out, smiling coyly.</p>
               <p>Goka had everything—peoples and food and buildings and magic from everywhere on the continent—but the one thing it had that Soo-jin cared about more than all of that was the Shining Crystal Muses. In only two weeks, she was going to meet Haru in person. It was a shame the concert hall wasn’t in its full splendor, as the authorities had foolishly deemed it lower priority for reconstruction.</p>
               <p><em>What if that kaiju comes back? </em>Soo-jin’s mother had fretted, but if Mogaru inconvenienced the city at the most important moment of her life, Soo-jin would personally put the kaiju down and no one could stop her. She smiled back at the poster, sipping her sparkle tea as worries of exams slipped out of her mind, and she focused on what really mattered: supporting her favorite band.</p>

               <p>Varisia’s Lost Coast has seen more than its fair share of danger over the past few decades, and the town of Sandpoint, known also as the “Light of the Lost Coast,” has been at the epicenter of much of that danger. Goblin invasions, attacks from giants and dragons, deadly fires, murderous rampages, and natural disasters have tested the limits of those who dwell here, and many have wondered why the Lost Coast, and Sandpoint in particular, has had such a run of bad luck recently.</p>
               <p>There is a reason. And now, nearly two decades after Runelord Karzoug rose from his slumber to threaten the realm, those reasons are coming to a boil. A new band of heroes must step up to save the town from a sinister conspiracy that would bring doom seven times over to Sandpoint.</p>
               <p><em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em> is a very special adventure: it marks the 200th volume of the Pathfinder Adventure Paths by returning to the town where it all began! Serving as a sequel to <em>Burnt Offerings</em>, the first adventure in Rise of the Runelords, <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em> is a fully self-contained campaign in a single 200-page volume that brings your characters from 4th to 12th level. Along the way, you’ll discover the true nature of the supernatural forces that have loomed in the background of all that has occurred in this small coastal town.</p>
               <p>Inside the <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint Player’s Guide</em>, you’ll find player-friendly, spoiler-free information and tips to help you make an exciting new character perfect for the Seven Dooms for Sandpoint Adventure Path.</p>

                <li>Eight new backgrounds to contextualize your character’s history in Sandpoint.</li>
                <li>A gazetteer of the town of Sandpoint that provides new information on influential factions in the town (from established groups like the Sandpoint Cathedral and the Town Watch to newcomers such as the Runewatchers or the Scarnetti Consortium), details on living in Sandpoint (including tips on earning income, earning reputation with the town’s seven most influential factions, or securing downtime support from individual NPCs and locations), and a gazetteer of 50 of the town’s most important locations.</li>
                <li>An interactive narrative that you and the other players can read through as a group to help generate a brand new “adventuring history” for your first three levels of experience, if you prefer to build brand new 4th-level characters to play this Adventure Path rather than bring in established characters from a previous adventure.</li>

               <p>As it exits Early Access, <em>Pathfinder: Gallowspire Survivors </em>introduces a host of highly requested features from the community, as well as UI improvements, overall gameplay balancing, and Steam Deck compatibility. Players may now brave the depths of Gallowspire with a friend in both local co-op and Steam Remote Play. Escape incoming damage in a blink of an eye with the all-new dash mechanic, and gain run-deciding buffs with a strategic sip from the potion belt. With the addition of dedicated chapters, faster character progression, hyper mode, and new Pathfinder collectible cards with official artworks that provide permanent upgrades, every attempt towards sealing away the disgraced lich-emperor brings great reward.</p>
               <p>Within the depths of Gallowspire lies the disgraced mythic lich Tar-Baphon, one of Pathfinder’s most ancient and powerful villains. While sealed away beneath his ancient seat of power, he has been deftly plotting his grand return. As the magic that contains him begins to fail, three fearless heroes will rise to the occasion, tasked with venturing into Gallowspire's depths to defeat Tar-Baphon and repair the wards that seal him away.</p>
               <p>Step into the role as one of three daring heroes and battle through the horrors of Gallowspire. The Fighter, Wizard, or Rogue all come with their own strengths and talents that will aid them in their efforts against Tar-Baphon. Choose an ally to fight alongside you as you slay hordes of Tar-Baphon’s undead minions, collect and upgrade your arsenal of spells and weapons, and extinguish Gallowspire’s callous bosses. There will be many failures throughout your journey, but aided by an ancient medallion, the heroes can escape death and grow stronger with each attempt.</p>
               <p>Prepare to face Gallowspire's hordes for as long as it takes…<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2388460/Pathfinder_Gallowspire_Survivors/"><em>Pathfinder: Gallowspire Survivors</em></a> launches on April 4th.

               <br>
               <h2>Guide Updates</h2>
               <p>Version 5.10 of the <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=Pathfinder-Society-(Second-Edition)-Guide-to-Organized-Play">Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society</a> has been published! This version contains some important updates, including removing <em>axiomatic</em> and <em>anarchic</em> runes, which must be returned for a full refund as they no longer function with the removal of alignment; and making some remaster-related changes to Spellcasting Services and PCs with Disabilities.</p>
               <p>A full changelog is available <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=pfs2guide._.Changelog#Version_5">here</a>. Please let us know if there are any further questions or concerns!</p>
               <br>
               <h2>FAQ Updates</h2>
               <p>To go along with the Guide, we’ve added a couple new FAQ answers to the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq">Pathfinder Society FAQ page</a>! Specifically, there is now suggested guidance on running Influence encounters in PFS, as well as clarity on how to get items made from special materials.</p>
               <br>
               <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2>
               <p>February might be our quietest release month in recent memory, with just a single flip-mat on top of our OP scenarios! But of course, that’s all due to next month’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02et8"><em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em></a>, a double-length AP taking you back to where it all began. As such, the sanctioning machine is kicking up again!</p>
               <p>We expect <em>Seven Dooms</em> to be sanctioned for PFS play upon release, and players will get access to a pretty cool item for completing the adventure! No spoilers, yet. We’ll also be sanctioning the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4"><em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em></a> but, other than summoning creatures, there aren’t very many player-facing options in this book.</p>
               <p>In April, we expect to drop sanctioning for the <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ex6?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Tian-Xia-World-Guide">Tian Xia World Guide</a></em>, and then in May we’ll turn our attention to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ew4/discuss?Pathfinder-Howl-of-the-Wild"><em>Howl of the Wild</em></a> as well as our final Starfinder First Edition release, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ewi/discuss?Starfinder-Mechageddon-Adventure-Path"><em>Mechageddon!</em></a> Lots of new content on the horizon for you all, hope you’re excited!</p>
               <br>
               <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
               <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
               <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
               <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their 5th rank!</p>
               <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Zackery Kuehn and Jess Miller-Camp</p>
               <br>
               <p>That’s all from me this month, folks! Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And get ready for convention season!</p>

               <h2>The Death of Erastil</h2>
               <p>Erastil runs. Gallops really. Hoof over hoof, his antlers gleaming, bounding over shallow stream and whirling under tree branch, his body flying forward in a streak of joyous motion. He cannot always be the stag, but there are times he needs to run and feel the wind across his legs, familiar as the dawn but as new as any sunrise. He runs until he’s just past tired and ready for a drink of water, shaking leaves from antlers in a spray of autumn colors and transforming back into the form his followers are used to—horned head and wiry body of an age-old master hunter.</p>
               <p>But he is not the only age-old creature resting in this wood. <em>Something </em>emerges, slowly, from a refuge it has tired of, assorted sharp and fleshy parts dragging its pouch of hunger up from somewhere down below. Even Erastil’s well-trained eyes do not quite see it slowly crawling, clawing onto haunch and belly, drawing closer to the god and waiting for the perfect moment. Not until the instant that it rises up to strike.</p>
               <p>Erastil runs. Scrambles really. Step after step, bow at the ready, preparing even as he flees, trampling through a clutch of bushes, plunging through the river’s cold, trying to stay ahead until he whirls around to face what hunts him, show it that he’s unafraid. But there are things that even Old Deadeye has no defense against. And when that something catches him, its jaw wide and devouring, it turns what once was hunting god to nothing more than helpless prey, only stopping its ravaging to marvel at the flavor. There’s something here it’s never savored, in between the crunch and squelch—divinely filling in a way that it has never known before and now can never be without. Once it has consumed its meal and all that’s left is bits of bone, it scents the air and twists its body, reveling in the aftertaste of something past mortality, and lurches through the undergrowth to find another morsel.</p>
               <p>Followers of Erastil who felt his blessings fade track his remaining footprints to the place he fought and fell. (There’s luck in that, or Jaidi’s hand, steady despite a widow’s grief, putting firm hands against their backs until they find whatever place his hint of dust remains.) A hunt is called, a holy ride, in honor of the fallen god, to track and take whatever beast has left their altars bare. But all they find across their path are other grieving worshippers whose gods (most small in name and reach, their purpose only known by handfuls) now are merely carcasses, devoured by some wretched beast that no one ever glimpses. The Hunters offer shelter and a purpose to these wanderers, and some find comfort in the endless chase across the Great Beyond, even as they never seem to find the subject of their search. Whatever killed Erastil, whatever hunts the other gods, is always hidden from their view, is always one quick turn away, is always adding to the trail of carnage just ahead.</p>
               <p>The gods take notice of the beast, each readying their own defense. Some draw together, forming pacts and promising to shield each other—the radiance of the Dawnflower reaches the realm of the Midnight Lord, Norgorber and Iomedae draw swords with Cayden Cailean, the half-abandoned Summerlands fill up with frightened deities—but others use the moment as the perfect time to strike. Gorum turns on the cowardly and sharpens blades against their backs, Asmodeus carves clauses into those he has a contract with, Calistria builds safety from the ashes of revenge. Pantheons rise and fall and splinter in the shadow of the beast, endlessly repositioning even when it has gone to ground, its hunger sated only briefly every new time that it feeds.</p>
               <p>Among the mortals, fear takes root as one god or another falls, and those who live are sometimes absent, too caught up in safety to give followers their strength. Some flourish in these absences that gods might once have kept in check, selling hope or cruelty as counters to divinity, creating order from the chaos any way they can. And when the gods grow used to fear and venture back into the world (beast still lurking in the corners, drooling at the prey), some find their temples turned to rubble, dusty from years of disuse, or built over to some new purpose they can barely recognize, and must now find a new path in a half-godless Golarion, even as something in the shadows starts to hunt</p>

               <p><em>Much as I found it distasteful to read about, I wish this supposed prophecy had gone into greater detail about this “beast” with what I suppose is a taste for divine flesh (a prospect I can barely conceive of, let alone comment on!). While I did attempt to use my rudimentary artistic talents to create some sort of sketch, even my best guess at the appearance of this beast has fallen quite short, as it matches nothing I am currently aware of. Either my skills are not up to the task, the prophecy has purposefully been vague, or this beast has never been seen before. If the latter, this is yet another reason to doubt this prophecy in particular. Anything this powerful would surely be noted in someone’s annals. Beyond that, though, the breakdown of the gods noted here seems very unlikely. In both my studies and experiences of the gods, I have found them to be quite devoted to those who worship them (each in their own way, of course), even when to their own detriment. No matter how horrible the threat, I do not believe mortals would be abandoned in this way, nor that they would abandon their gods in return. Or, at least, I do not wish to believe it. Best, I think, to move on to some new, and hopefully less troubling, prophecy.</em></p>

               <p itemprop="description">To truly immerse oneself in the natural world, one must view it up close! Though our ultimate goal was to find the Wardens of the Wild, we couldn’t neglect the incredible opportunities for study we found over the course of our investigations, and we made frequent stops to survey the wilds on foot (or on fin or wheel, in Lythea’s case). I hesitate to call them “side expeditions,” for they were valuable in their own right; Chari’s notes and sketches filled several folios we’re still disseminating now that we’ve returned—ah, but I outpace myself.</p>
               <p>In any case, these excursions were where our scout, Telero, and our scribe, Charikleia, really had a chance to shine. One day, early in our voyage together, we were flying along a river that gradually carved the land into a breathtaking gorge, its cascading tributaries branching like the roots of a great tree in the rocky canyons spread out below us.</p>
               <p>“Professor!” called Telero from the starboard rail, his voice ringing bright and eager as always. “This could be the perfect place to look for more sage aconite!”</p>
               <p>(I feel I must pause to note, dear reader, lest it cause confusion: I am not, in fact, a professor in any official capacity! A lifelong scholar, certainly, and a dedicated librarian and archivist, but circumstances led me away from my university studies long before I advanced to any sort of teaching career. Nonetheless, I’ve been “the professor” to Telero since our first day aboard the <em>Zoetrope</em>, and I must say I find the epithet endearing, despite its inaccuracy.)</p>
               <p>Telero grew up among talented herbalists and knew botany was a special interest of both mine and the doctor’s; we also knew that where interesting flora grew, interesting fauna was sure to follow. Who could say what new discovery might lead us to the wardens? I set us down on the rocky riverbank—my landings were getting smoother with practice—and called our small crew together to prepare for the journey.</p>
               <p>We quickly decided that, due to the branching nature of the canyons, a group survey wasn’t the most efficient course of action. “Let me go, Professor,” said Telero, eying the lodestone in his staff and tying off a bearing. “I spotted a waterfall a few miles in when we flew over. I can find it and then come back for everyone else!”</p>
               <p>I could tell asking him to wait for someone who hiked at my speed—that is to say, glacial—would be futile. “A wonderful idea, Telero,” I said, smiling at his irrepressible enthusiasm. “But it did look like there were several possible routes. Why don’t you take Charikleia with you?” The two had already bonded over similarities in their childhoods, and the young nomad hung on the more seasoned adventurer’s every word when she shared tales of her exploits before our voyage. I also suspected Chari’s measured and experienced approach would be a good balance to Telero’s hastier decisions on the trail.</p>
               <p>My friend and fellow scholar nodded, already tucking her sketchbook into her bag. “I <em>am</em> quite familiar with mazes,” Chari teased, “and I’d love to sketch the falls—”</p>
               <p>“Last one there’s an egg full of broodpiercers!” Telero’s hooves thundered down the gangplank as he charged off into the gorge, no longer able to contain his zest for adventure.</p>
               <p>“Careful to boil those first!” Grefu warned after him. Chari laughed and waved to the rest of us as the two set off, the clatter of their hooves echoing off the mossy basalt walls of the gorge long after they faded from view.</p>
               <p>Dr. Pom and I had barely finished our second leisurely cups of tea when Telero came galloping back. My concern over his haste and Chari’s absence was quickly allayed by the exuberance on his face. “Professor, everyone, we found it! You’ve got to see this!”</p>
               <p>Our intrepid scout deftly guided us through the canyon, at times splashing through the river itself as the mossy rock walls closed in around us, only a line of blue sky visible far above. “How did you find it so quickly, Telero?” I asked, marveling at his surety as the canyon widened and the river diverged. He led us down the left-claw path, stopping often so those of us on two legs could keep up.</p>
               <p>“It’s easy,” said our young guide, his eyes earnest. “You just have to listen to the river and watch the wind.”</p>

               <p>I’m afraid this surprisingly poetic insight has not yet improved my own sense of direction, but perhaps it will resonate with you, dear reader. If nothing else, the boy’s words remind us of the importance of being alert and appreciative of the world around us.</p>
               <p>The roar of the falls drowned out further conversation as we rounded a final bend and came to a large canyon pool, fed from the endless water cascading over the cliff ahead. Telero beamed as we silently took in the thunderous serenade, the mist covering our awed faces.</p>
               <p>It was nearly a full minute before I realized, with a shock, that Chari was sitting on a nearby rock, pencil in hand as she sketched the scene in front of us for our logs. She looked up and smiled as I took a seat next to her. Grefu and Dr. Pom began unpacking our picnic lunch while Lythea, Telero, and Ten charged into the pool, their laughter barely audible as they dove into the spray.</p>
               <p>Chari passed me several sketches. “Signs of stony bat spit, similar to those of other gorgon subspecies detailed in the Kirisiel report, but I thought I’d document the flora first and wait for you to investigate.”</p>
               <p>I paged through her neat drawings, all precisely labeled in her steady hand. “These are wonderful, Charikleia. How lucky we are to have you along. How was the trek?”</p>
               <p>She laughed. “Telero’s a natural. He’d be right at home in the training mazes back home. I’d love to see him race my siblings sometime.”</p>
               <p>Though I can’t fathom how he could have heard us over the waterfall, Telero bounded forward from the pool, narrowly avoiding soaking Chari’s sketchbook. “Chari could have found it first!” he protested, shaking water from his hair. “But she had to stop to draw everything.”</p>
               <p>I traded a smile with my fellow researcher as she restacked her notes and moved them away from the pool. “I’m glad you’re both so thorough in your own ways,” I said. “The smallest detail could be the clue that leads us to the wardens.” I sighed, equal parts grateful and wistful, the sun warm on my scales. “Now, if only I were as organized as you are, Charikleia. I don’t suppose you know where I placed volume three of <em>The Thrilling Tales of Spiridendra</em>, do you?”</p>
               <p>“You’re the librarian, Baranthet, not me,” she joked, standing and offering me her hand. “Care to join us by the falls? I think I saw some likely nesting spots in the rocks behind the water.”</p>
               <p>Telero leapt forward. “I saw that too! C’mon, Professor!”</p>
               <p>I accepted Chari’s hand with a smile as she helped me to my feet. “Lead the way!”</p>

               <p><b>About the Author</b><br>
                 Baranthet Zamendi cultivated his love of the natural world at a young age, enamored with his grandmother’s awe-inspiring tales of the legendary Wardens of the Wild. He briefly attended Almas University before returning home to rebuild Droon’s public library, eventually becoming its head archivist. His upcoming book on the crew of the <em>Zoetrope</em> and their search for the wardens is his first, but he’s already planning his next adventure.</p>

Sallé is a senior editor at Paizo and has written for numerous Pathfinder and Starfinder books, including more of Baranthet’s tale in<em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>, the primal treatise and witch journals in <em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em>, and <em>Starfinder Bounty #12: Under Pressure</em>. When she’s not extolling the virtues of the en dash, she enjoys playing as many narrative games as her schedule allows and wandering the woods with her Disreputable Dog.</p>

               <p>Hi everyone—James here! As we get closer to Howl of the Wild’s May release date, we thought we’d share with you some logs of the wildlife expedition of the airship Zoetrope and its crew of naturalists as they seek the mythical Wardens of the Wild, which Simone has diligently sourced. As you may know, Howl of the Wild presents <a href=" https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sibw&amp;page=1?Meet-the-Crew-of-the-Zoetrope "> six new playable ancestries </a>, each of whom is represented by a different member of the airship’s crew—alongside Baranthet, the expedition’s iruxi leader.</p>
               <p>Since we got a look at Charikleia and Telero today, this seems like a good time to show off feats for the centaur and minotaur ancestries coming in the final book! Centaurs can be pretty competitive, and young Telero’s no exception:</p>
               <p><u></u></p>
               <h3><u>FIERCE COMPETITOR [one-action] — FEAT 9</u></h3>
               <p></p>
               <p><b>Centaur, Mental</b><br><u><b>Frequency</b> once per day</u><br>
                 You challenge a single ally to a physical competition. This competition must involve accomplishing a specific goal for a specific use of the Acrobatics or Athletics skill, such as Climbing to the top of a wall, Tripping a specific foe, or Long Jumping across a chasm. You and your selected ally gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the associated skill check for 1 minute or until one of you wins the challenge, whichever is first. If you win this competition, you gain a +2 status bonus to Intimidation checks for 1 hour.</p>
               <br>
               <p>You wouldn’t really expect someone as soft-spoken as Chari to be scary, but it turns out minotaurs are frighteningly good at disappearing into mazes and other cover.</p>
               <p><u></u></p>
               <h3><u>ALARMING DISAPPEARANCE — FEAT 5</u></h3>
               <p></p>
               <p><b>Minotaur</b><br><u><b>Prerequisites</b> expert in Stealth</u><br>
                 Your ability to move unseen is startling for one your size, causing panic among your enemies. When you successfully Hide when previously observed, creatures you are hidden from become frightened 1. They are then temporarily immune to Alarming Disappearance for 1 hour.</p>

              <p>One of the challenges with the update to the Second Edition remastered rules was having to leave a lot of old favorites behind. In addition to classic spells, notable magic items, and other memorable mechanics, we also had to leave behind some monsters. Unfortunately, in some cases, a variety of reasons makes leaving behind strigiform-ursine hybrids or cuboid gels the best option for us. There are other cases where a bit of cleaning up and a makeover leads to something we can still use in the new remastered environment. That’s the approach we took with the horned dragon—a dragon who you might previously remember for its focus on the color green.</p>
              <p>Horned dragons are our second primal dragon offering in <em>Monster Core</em>. Like other primal dragons, horned dragons are powerful and more bestial than other dragons. This manifests most notably in the form of their massive, paired horns. In addition to simply striking others with their horns, a horned dragon charges their prey and impales these unfortunate victims on the horn. Once impaled, the prey is stuck and goes wherever the dragon goes until the prey manages to escape impalement.</p>
              <p>Beyond that, the horned dragon should feel relatively familiar. Their personalities are relatively the same, their other abilities such as their poison breath and twisting tail reaction are still around, and they still generally live in forested regions and swamps. When updating monsters for the remaster, we wanted to make these changes as unintrusive as possible and allow updated monsters to generally fill the same role they had prior to their update.</p>
              <p>We also took these opportunities to update monsters in interesting ways where we could, thus the shift from the dragon’s color to their horn and the addition of their impaling charge. The change in focus allows us to make the dragon more of our own and even opens them for future possibilities. While the horned dragon in <em>Monster Core</em> is green and lives in forests, there’s a decent chance you could see a blue horned dragon that lives in a lake or a tan horned dragon that lives in a desert sometime in the future!</p>
              <p>That’s our look at the horned dragon! Make sure to keep an eye out for this dragon and lots of other new dragons when <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core"><em>Monster Core</em></a> releases in March. Stay tuned for more draconic previews in the coming weeks. Next time, we’ll take a look at the majestic empyreal dragons. See you then!</p>
