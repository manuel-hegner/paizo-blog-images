  \ Send-off</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, September 11, 2017</p> \n   <div\

  >Last Friday</a>, James Sutter announced that he was leaving the Paizo family and\
  \ moving on to focus on his writing career. We will miss James and wish him the\
  \ best, so we decided to send Sutter off the best way we knew how—with embarrassing\
  \ stories and photos—and the occasional heartfelt goodbye.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>My earliest memories of James L. Sutter are of a childlike gelfling\
  \ spirit with an emo haircut, some kid recruited into Paizo through back channels\
  \ by Lisa Stevens to fill whatever role she thought necessary at the time. These\
  \ were the early days of Paizo, where our business was magazines and our org chart\
  \ was a circle with everybody's name in it. Those without a specific duty inherited\
  \ from our previous incarnation as the Periodicals Department of Wizards of the\
  \ Coast tended to flit from job to job, doing what needed to be done, eventually\
  \ accruing enough responsibility and expertise for a job description to calcify\
  \ around previously unclaimed duties that had essentially fallen to the floor. James\
  \ helped with some of the company's non-D&amp;D magazines, with customer service,\
  \ and with getting Reaper miniatures uploaded onto the new paizo.com webstore, but\
  \ he'd never really worked on the magazines I oversaw at the time. That all changed\
  \ when we needed an assistant editor, and Sutter was only too happy to join our\
  \ staff. In fact, this was about the same time that I formally became Publisher\
  \ at Paizo, which netted me a private office down the hall and a tearful goodbye\
  \ to the Editorial Pit, the tiny room that once housed our entire gaming-mag operation.\
  \ Sutter himself sat in my old desk next to James Jacobs, and for a few years he\
  \ even had to tolerate a couple of drawers filled with a half-decade of junk I was\
  \ too busy (or lazy, take your pick) to clean out.</p> \n     <p>The young kid from\
  \ the Seattle Stranger's editorial office took to the drawer-sharing situation with\
  \ aplomb and a great attitude, traits that I would come to appreciate (and rely\
  \ on) in the future. But then he was just Young James Sutter, an intern-made-good\
  \ who frankly reminded me a lot of myself, and who, over time, I began to realize\
  \ could have a huge future at Paizo. Once upon a time, after all, I had been the\
  \ youngest guy on the D&amp;D team, and the youngest member of my creative team\
  \ in the Dark Days of public relations, before I managed to turn D&amp;D freelancing\
  \ into a career. And here, somehow, I'd found myself in charge of the whole editorial\
  \ operation. What might the future hold for this ambitious young editor?</p> \n\
  \     <p>As it turned out, the launch of the Pathfinder RPG gave James plenty of\
  \ opportunities to impress me even more. He'd already helped me (along with Pierce\
  \ Watters and Chris Carey) run the editorial side of Planet Stories, Paizo's short-lived\
  \ but much-loved classic sci-fi and fantasy reprint series, and with a new game\
  \ coming we knew we'd need a fiction line to accompany it. Free web fiction, at\
  \ first, but even at the very start I knew we wanted to have novels eventually,\
  \ and that Sutter—already with a reputation as one of the strongest among a coterie\
  \ of strong writers—would be just the guy to helm it.</p> \n     <p>There was only\
  \ one problem. James Sutter was a rock star.</p> \n     <p>I don't mean a figurative\
  \ rock star, like a guy who always overdelivers on his turnovers or an editor who\
  \ routinely improves the work of some of the industry's top writers. I mean an actual,\
  \ literal rock star for a series of local heavy metal bands that always seemed (at\
  \ least to me and my fellow Paizo senior managers) like they were a lucky break\
  \ away from making it big. I saw big things for James Sutter here at Paizo, but\
  \ if he wanted to take advantage of them, he needed to go in with open eyes and\
  \ every part of his being. We gave him a choice: Rock star or RPG star. James chose\
  \ RPG star, and we've all been the richer for it over these past 13 years, during\
  \ which James has been absolutely essential.</p> \n     <p>Like Golarion's star\
  \ system? You can thank me for the idea of giving the planets equal treatment to\
  \ the outer planes, but beyond a couple of tired pulp pastiches (my specialty!)\
  \ of Mars and Venus, that's pretty much all Sutter.</p> \n     <p>Enjoyed the Pathfinder\
  \ Tales line? Sutter wrote two of the novels himself, but he also edited every single\
  \ one and contributed creative ideas to all of them. There literally would not have\
  \ been a Pathfinder Tales line without him, and even now, as his days at Paizo dwindle\
  \ into hours, he's still helping me find a new publishing partner to continue the\
  \ line in the future, no doubt with future James Sutter Pathfinder stories yet to\
  \ be told.</p> \n     <p>Enjoy the fun fiction bits at the side of the two-page\
  \ chapter openers in all our hardcover books? James wrote about 95% of those. Love\
  \ our comics? James wrote about a quarter of those, too.</p> \n     <p>Oh, did you\
  \ like Starfinder? I put James in charge of Paizo's biggest product launch ever\
  \ because of the success he had brought to all of those projects listed above, because\
  \ he created the planets that form the core of the primary star system, because\
  \ I knew he knew enough about the creative and business sides of publishing to make\
  \ it work, and because I knew, after all these years, that he really was a rock\
  \ star, and one that blazed with the incandescent creative power of a sun.</p> \n\
  \     <p>It turns out, after 13 years, that this rock star really cannot be contained\
  \ by the band he's toured with this past decade or so. Having grown to something\
  \ considerably more adult than a gelfling intern, Sutter leaves Paizo as one of\
  \ its greatest champions, a face on a growing Mt. Rushmore of gaming whose contributions\
  \ will last far longer than his time here in the office. You'll recognize his face\
  \ on that mountain as the one with the expression of a master player in the middle\
  \ of the sweetest solo he has ever played. Our rock star is all grown up and about\
  \ to break out on a solo career. You'll see him out there in the wilderness at the\
  \ center of the spotlight, with a legion of fans throwing the horns in his direction.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And you'll also see him here, in the pages of Pathfinder products yet\
  \ to come and in the timeless creations he leaves behind. Pathfinder wouldn't be\
  \ Pathfinder without James L. Sutter. Paizo wouldn't be Paizo, either.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>So long, James L. Sutter. Thanks for everything you have done for Paizo,\
  \ for me, and for all of our players and fans. I think I speak for all of us when\
  \ I say we can't wait to see what you come up with next!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br>\
  \ <i>Publisher &amp; Chief Creative Officer</i></p> \n     <hr> \n     <p>Once upon\
  \ a time, there was a mystical, magical land called Jamestopia. Here, agents of\
  \ Operation Banjo Thug wandered where they wished, content in the knowledge that\
  \ their domain was protected and that the impromptu puppet shows they had become\
  \ known for could be performed without fear. In Jamestopia, the view of the river\
  \ was unparalleled, even if for some time the smell of sewage wafting in from sources\
  \ unknown (likely other, lesser realms which didn't have the word \"James” in their\
  \ title) got distracting. And even when the world changed and we moved offices and\
  \ Jamestopia fractured (AKA Sutter and I ended up sitting in different parts of\
  \ the building), the concept of Jamestopia remained. Even when James Sutter drifted\
  \ even further from the land of dragons and elves into the land of SPACE dragons\
  \ and SPACE elves… the concept remained.</p> \n     <p>But now, Jamestopia has suffered\
  \ a mortal blow, and there remains but one agent of Operation Banjo Thug to hold\
  \ back the onrushing advent of the mundane. It's not going to be the same, representing\
  \ the whimsical and nonsensical on my own.</p> \n     <p>There are a lot of fond\
  \ memories, be they mice in the drawers or orange skin from too much carrot juice\
  \ or adventures in creative sitting posture or impromptu discussions about the possibility\
  \ of there being a space elevator somewhere in Varisia, and while Jamestopia is\
  \ going away, those memories will remain.</p> \n     <p>I'll miss ya lots, Sutter!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And you DO REALIZE that now I get to do whatever I want with a certain\
  \ LAWFUL EVIL gold dragon, right?<b> MWA HA HA HA HA HA!!!</b></p> \n     <p>James\
  \ Jacobs<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p> \n     <hr> \n     <p>My first real encounter\
  \ with James was when he reviewed my editing test for Paizo with me at a New Year's\
  \ party (Seattle's a small world) while wearing a Steampunk officer's uniform and\
  \ a sword.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20170911-01.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20170911-01_500.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div> \n    \
  \ <p>While his dress sense in the office is more conservative, he has always brought\
  \ the same flair, sense of fun, and dedication to doing and being all the things\
  \ all the time. Since that disconcerting day, James has been my peer, my boss, and\
  \ then my peer again, but always a friend, a mentor, and an ally. We've commiserated\
  \ about impossible deadlines and tough decisions, cried on each other's shoulders\
  \ about family crises, and cheered each other's successes. Dude, I'm going to miss\
  \ you here so much, so you'd better do tons of amazing things (including writing\
  \ for us!)</p> \n     <p>Judy Bauer<br> <i>Managing Editor</i></p> \n     <hr> \n\
  \     <p>Sutter has always been friendly and upbeat, even during those unfortunate\
  \ crunch times. If it weren't for him, I probably wouldn't be at Paizo, and I'll\
  \ miss him sorely. Good luck out there, pal!</p> \n     <p>Jason Keeley<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
  \ \n     <hr> \n     <p>I first met Sutter at PaizoCon 2008, when I was still a\
  \ \"super-fan”, known for my message board handle and my involvement in the PathfinderWiki.\
  \ I remember his enthusiasm when I showed him the print-on-demand paperback Pathfinder's\
  \ Journal compilation I'd made to more easily read Eando Kline's adventures during\
  \ my New York City commute. I like to think I was the inspiration for the Pathfinder\
  \ Tales line he would eventually helm.</p> \n     <p>During that convention's Grand\
  \ Convocation event, a bemused Wes sat at his assigned station, providing Harrow\
  \ readings (with a glass of wine, of course) for eager Pathfinder Society players\
  \ like myself. Next to him, over-the-top Sean K Reynolds acted out the part of a\
  \ medium, channeling the gods in a live-action casting of <i>commune</i>. Enter\
  \ Sutter, who had been lurking over Wes's shoulder as \"Chumley”, Herr Schneider's\
  \ loyal imp companion. When I approached Sean and asked him to channel Zon-Kuthon,\
  \ Chumley took the opportunity to possess the open divine vessel and puppet him\
  \ into giving me entirely non-Kuthite responses. Needless to say, the photos I got\
  \ of Sutter manipulating Sean like a marionette were priceless.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20170911-02.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20170911-02_500.jpeg\"></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170911-03.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170911-03_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>And the hijinks haven't slowed down ever since. Sutter has\
  \ always been a constant source of new ways of looking at seemingly old, unsolvable\
  \ problems, and has never been shy about his more eccentric personal traits—communal\
  \ living, dumpster diving, and Star Trek body painted naked bike rides not the least\
  \ among them. He's taught me a lot about the creative process, the logistics of\
  \ getting books made, building one's online persona, and more. I'll miss him in\
  \ the office, but know that as long as we keep putting out books about space and\
  \ the First World, he won't be too far away.</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Franchise\
  \ Manager</i></p> \n     <hr> \n     <p>Sutter's had my back since I first started\
  \ freelancing with Paizo. He's always been tremendously supportive, encouraging,\
  \ positive, and willing to take time out of his (incredibly busy) schedule to encourage\
  \ and advise. He's a model for how to give credit where credit is due—though he\
  \ really could stand to give himself his share of that credit. I'm lucky to have\
  \ been able to work with him and even more lucky that I can count him as a friend.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lyz Liddell<br> <i>Editor</i></p> \n     <hr> \n     <p>Meeting James\
  \ Sutter is like being swept up in a cyclone made of flashing neon lights, skydivers'\
  \ screams, and pulsing electronic dance music: you have no damn idea what's going\
  \ on, but whoa are things fun. Sutter's enthusiasm for everything creative immediately\
  \ struck me the day I met him. Since then, it seems like the cyclone hasn't stopped,\
  \ as we've worked on everything together from brainstorming Pathfinder canon to\
  \ the massive undertaking that was the Starfinder RPG. As that project took shape,\
  \ I also learned a thing or two about managing from Sutter, and the admirable depths\
  \ of his experience for Paizo.</p> \n     <p>In the end, when push came to shove,\
  \ I knew I could be my weird self around Sutter. And, I'll let you all in on a little\
  \ secret: it's because he's weird, too!</p> \n     <p>Yeah, I know, Sutter. I'm\
  \ <i>rude!</i></p> \n     <p>Amanda Hamon Kunz<br> <i>Development Coordinator</i></p>\
  \ \n     <hr> \n     <p>I've only been working at Paizo for a few months now, so\
  \ I don't have the awesome, \"way back when” stories that others are sharing. However,\
  \ I did work with Sutter quite a bit for the marketing of Starfinder. I can say\
  \ that there were evenings when I would burst into his office and say, \"They need\
  \ a 700-word article, in an hour!!” and Sutter would give me a look. The look was\
  \ a combination of annoyed, tired, amused, and determined. In every one of those\
  \ situations, I got the 700-word article with time to spare. The guy is a machine\
  \ that creates and creates. It's been a blast working with him and he'll be missed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Dan Tharp<br> <i>Marketing Coordinator</i></p> \n     <hr> \n     <p>When\
  \ James L. Sutter started at Paizo, he looked like he was about 12 years old. To\
  \ top it off, we already had a few James' in the office, so he got relegated to\
  \ being referred to as Sutter or Young James. Well, Sutter eventually turned 21\
  \ and discovered the wonders of alcohol, and being 21 he also thought that he was\
  \ invincible. And so the stage was set for one of the most epic nights of drinking\
  \ the editors of Dragon and Dungeon had ever seen.</p> \n     <p>We in the developer's\
  \ pit would sometimes take jokes a bit too far. Such was the case with our quoting\
  \ of the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic \"Total Recall”. Responding to any deadline\
  \ with \"Two Weeks\" was common practice. Crying out like Arnold at any injury was\
  \ accepted as normal. We enjoyed the flick so much that we thought it would be a\
  \ great idea to get together and watch the movie, complete with mars themed drinks\
  \ and food. Seeing as we are all gamers, I dug up the rules for a Total Recall themed\
  \ drinking game. We gathered at Wes' place late one Saturday to partake in our favored\
  \ film.</p> \n     <p>It all started great until we realized that drinking every\
  \ time the word \"recall” or \"mars” was said was going to lead to disaster. Well,\
  \ many of us realized that… but not Sutter. He vowed to keep pace with me, matching\
  \ drink for drink. He was, after all, invincible, despite the fact that he was literally\
  \ half my weight and about a foot shorter than me. As the movie drew to a close,\
  \ I was quite tipsy. Sutter… well, Sutter was ruined. Incapable of coherent speech\
  \ and unsteady on his feet, it was clear that he had drank more than enough. Soon\
  \ after, it was Wes' kitchen sink that paid the price.</p> \n     <p>A lot has happened\
  \ since those early days of Paizo. Sutter went on from editing dungeon to working\
  \ on Pathfinder and eventually managing our fiction lines and overseeing the creation\
  \ of Starfinder. He may not have been invincible then, but he sure seems like it\
  \ now.</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p> \n   \
