  artist: "none other than James L. Sutter, former Starfinder Creative Director and\
    \ an amazing author whose work really makes this voice experience shine. Incredible\
    \ voice actors, sound effects, and music further make this game sing. Specifically,\
    \ when Starfinder Creative Director Robert G. McCreary and I heard the rich soundscapes\
    \ of Absalom Station and felt the tension of combat with space goblins, we were\
    \ gleefully astonished. This project has brought Starfinderâ€™s world to life just\
    \ as we imagined, and for me it was a truly awe-inspiring experience"
