  \ Advice</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 16, 2010</p> \n    <p>Do\
  \ you want a shot at becoming a professional game designer? If so, you should enter\
  \ the <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/previous/2011\">RPG Superstar 2011 competition</a>.\
  \ Though the competition doesn't begin until December 3rd, that's just when we start\
  \ accepting submissions. Be smart and start working on your Round 1 wondrous item\
  \ submission <b>now</b>. That gives you a few extra weeks to refine your item concept.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>You should also check out the series of posts I'm writing giving advice\
  \ about things likely to get your item auto-rejected. They're indexed in a sticky\
  \ post <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/rpgsuperstar/previous/2011/general/wondrousItemAutoRejectAdvice\"\
  >here</a> on the Paizo forums. This is my third year judging, and by posting these\
  \ I'm trying to help other designers—that's you!—avoid common pitfalls that'll knock\
  \ you out of the competition. Fellow judge—and RPG Superstar 2009 winner—Neil Spicer\
  \ has been providing helpful comments in response to these posts, too. And it wouldn't\
  \ hurt to read Neil's <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/rpgsuperstar/previous/2011/previous/2010/general/archives/adviceForRoundOne&amp;page=1#0\"\
  >Advice For Round 1</a> post from last year.</p> \n    <p>Also check out former\
  \ Superstar judge Clark Peterson's extensive write-up of <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/rpgsuperstar/previous/2011/previous/2009/general/someThingsIAmSeeingInThisYearsBatch\"\
  >problems he saw in items from a previous competition</a>, which can help you steer\
  \ clear of things that'll make your chances crash and burn.</p> \n    <p>Let me\
  \ point out one thing so we're absolutely clear: <b>you have to participate in Round\
  \ 1 (wondrous item) if you want to progress to later rounds in the competition!</b>\
  \ We had a few people last year miss out entirely because they thought they could\
  \ jump in at a later round. Oops!</p> \n    <p>Read the competition rules. Do some\
  \ research. Submit a wondrous item between December 3rd and December 31st. Paizo\
  \ uses this competition to recognize talented designers we can use for freelance\
  \ writing—whether or not they make it to the final round. And if you <b>do</b> make\
  \ it to the final round, you could win a contract to write an adventure module for\
  \ Paizo. This could be your big break!</p> \n    <p>Good luck, good gaming, and\
  \ most of all... have fun!</p> \n    <p>Sean K Reynolds <br>Developer, RPG Superstar\
  \ Judge</p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: RPG Superstar --> \n  </div> <a href=\"\
