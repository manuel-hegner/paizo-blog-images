  \ of a Three-Eyed Wonder</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 30, 2010</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Do you have an office pet that you can use to terrorize your coworkers?\
  \ Is your terrifying office pet a living fossil that evolved just as the first terrestrial\
  \ creatures set foot on land? Does your terrifying, living fossil office pet bear\
  \ a striking resemblance to an aboleth? No? Well, then perhaps you should upgrade\
  \ your office pet. Might I suggest... a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triops\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">triops</a>?</p> \n    <p>Meet Blinky (so dubbed by Sutter).\
  \ Blinky was hatched from an innocuous-seeming package of bark and detritus a mere\
  \ two months ago. Even when he was a little filter-feeding larva, I could see the\
  \ evil glint in Blinky's three eyes. He was destined for great things. He exercised\
  \ dutifully, swimming around his bowl. He learned to hunt in that bowl, chasing\
  \ down and consuming his weaker triops brethren. He had to absorb their power, as\
  \ he knew he had to be strong. He moved onto the faster crustaceans that had the\
  \ gall to hatch along with him, punishing them for swimming in his bowl as if they\
  \ were his equal. He ate his broccoli and avoided his peas (a creature after my\
  \ own heart). </p> \n    <p>It was not long before he had grown over an inch long.\
  \ That's when he knew he was ready. Ready to escape his bowl and cause terror.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Alas, the poor creature has shuffled off this mortal carapace. Was it\
  \ the new plant I introduced to the bowl just before the long weekend? Was it the\
  \ cold seeping through the window? Was it the excitement of fulfilling his life-long\
  \ goal of <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/community/offTopic/wesSchneiderUrbanCastaway\"\
  > terrorizing Wes as he sleeps</a>? Or was it Wes himself, intent on a mission of\
  \ assassination and horror-eradication? I'm betting on Wes.</p> \n    <p>Don't worry,\
  \ Wes. The next generation is already gestating. Soon, they will be larval, and\
  \ before you know it, they will be tiptoeing through the vents, watching you type.\
  \ Watching you with their three eyes. Waiting for you to sleep. The triops are coming\
  \ for you, Wes.</p> \n    <p>Chris Self <br>Finance Manager</p> \n   </blockquote>\
