  \ is less than a month away, and traditionally that convention debuts the thrilling\
  \ conclusion of one season of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play</a> and lays the groundwork for the exciting story arc that begins\
  \ a month later at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\">Gen Con </a>. The Pathfinder Society\
  \ is poised to march to Jormurdun, a lost dwarven Sky Citadel, but several of their\
  \ sworn enemies have taken it upon themselves to claim the prize first. Of course,\
  \ we can't let that happen, so gear up to tackle some major campaign villains at\
  \ PaizoCon! On Friday evening, we're also doing a test run of \"Legacy of the Stonelords,\"\
  \ one of the upcoming season's two Special adventures.</span></p> \n    <p>What\
  \ season is that, you ask? Well, no doubt you've seen this blog's title already.\
  \ Nonetheless it's our pleasure to announce that Season 6 of Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play is the Year of the Sky Key, which kicks off this August at <a href=\"\
  http://gencon.com\">Gen Con Indy</a>!</p> \n    <p>The Pathfinder Society team has\
  \ really enjoyed reading <a href=\"/threads/rzs2qsvd\">the speculation</a> about\
  \ the upcoming season. For several years we've tied the season's theme to the Adventure\
  \ Path that debuts at that year's Gen Con, as we did with <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/jadeRegent\"\
  >\"Jade Regent\"</a> and the Year of the Ruby Phoenix, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >\"Shattered Star\"</a> and the Year of the Risen Rune, and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >\"Wrath of the Righteous\"</a> and the Year of the Demon. To an extent this is\
  \ also true for the Year of the Sky Key, which borrows from the technological theme\
  \ of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods\">\"Iron Gods\" Adventure\
  \ Path</a>; however, the scope is different this time around.</p> \n    <p>It's\
  \ hard to deny Numeria's appeal and intrigue. For years we've received inquiries\
  \ on the messageboards, questions during convention panels, and requests in person\
  \ for more information about Numeria, and based on <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfn\"\
  >a blog post earlier this year</a>, the organized play campaign is no exception\
  \ to this phenomenon. The bounty of new books about <a href=\"/products/btpy978l\"\
  >Numeria</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy95d2\">its technology</a> provide some\
  \ great adventure ideas that might inspire a few scenarios this year. So that's\
  \ it, then—a year of robots, laser guns, and cybernetic prostheses? No, that's one\
  \ of the Year of the Sky Key's many charms. Not everyone likes sci-fi peanut butter\
  \ in the fantasy chocolate, and we respect that. What's more, introducing a glut\
  \ of advanced technological gadgets in the campaign would impact the many adventures\
  \ that precede (and likely those that follow) Season 6 in unintended ways. One can\
  \ only imagine the havoc a particularly trigger-happy Pathfinder could inflict with\
  \ a nuclear resonator or gravity rifle. </p> \n    <p>We have several adventures\
  \ planned that deal with Numeria and its past, including the three scenarios set\
  \ to debut at Gen Con. You'll find that many of these adventures don't take the\
  \ PCs directly into Numeria, but they do involve the rare piece of technology smuggled\
  \ out of that nation, the Technic League, and the sites influenced by Numeria's\
  \ alien treasures. That said, we've made a conscious decision not to tie this season\
  \ to its neighboring Adventure Path so closely for another important reason: it\
  \ allows us to return to long-neglected lodges and reinforce the Pathfinder Society's\
  \ founding goal—the recovery of lost knowledge and ancient treasures. During the\
  \ Year of the Sky Key, Pathfinder agents will have numerous opportunities to return\
  \ to places the campaign hasn't touched in years. Are you excited to see more of\
  \ Qadira, Katapesh, the Mwangi Expanse, the Land of the Linnorm Kings, the Shackles,\
  \ and Tian Xia—including whatever became of the thriving Lantern Lodge? Us too!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In the weeks leading up to the new season's debut, we'll be sharing more\
  \ details about faction developments, the revised <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"\
  >Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>, and a few other surprises that\
  \ we're really eager to announce. In the meantime, check out the Year of the Sky\
  \ Key's new logo.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20140616-SilverDisc_500.jpeg\"\

  \ well as some of the favorites from Season 5, we've adjusted the number of tables\
  \ available at Gen Con for nine of the 10 slots, and more tickets are now available\
  \ for those popular events that were sold out. Finally, John will be appearing on\
