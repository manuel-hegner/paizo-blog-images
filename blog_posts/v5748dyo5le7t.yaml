  \ of Norret's flask, pronouncing it ninety-nine point nine percent pure will-o'-wisp\
  \ essence, with the impurities mostly consisting of honeysuckle and grape. Norret\
  \ nodded, and the three old men fell to talking amongst themselves.</span></p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Wizards would buy it for ink,\" Sage pointed out.</p> \n    <p>\"Wizards\
  \ don't need this degree of purity,\" Newby countered.</p> \n    <p>\"Would be useful\
  \ for underpainting secret messages,\" said Hessim. \"Signatures and such.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Newby snorted. \"Think of the holy glow of Iomedae's sword or Sarenrae's\
  \ rays.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bit heretical, considering the origin,\" said Sage.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Then the ghastly pallor of Urgathoa.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Or the flames\
  \ in Asmodeus's eyes,\" Hessim enthused.</p> \n    <p>\"Point,\" admitted Sage.\
  \ \"Wonderful for unholy icons. We are agreed then, gentlemen?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Aye,\" said his fellow shopkeepers.</p> \n    <p>The old men were nothing if not\
  \ scrupulous. They kitted Norret out with an elaborate case of oil paints and brushes,\
  \ including a traveling easel, a sketch pad, and a small canvas, while I was given\
  \ a similar set of watercolors. They also gave us a map of Korvosa and advice on\
  \ the best bridge to take to cross the narrows en route to the mainland and the\
  \ Acadamae atop Citadel Crest.</p> \n    <p>It was grand. It was imposing. It was\
  \ also open only to students, faculty, and tradesmen. Frightening hellspawn guards\
  \ menaced those who didn't belong.</p> \n    <p>That said, Norret and I were Galtan,\
  \ and we were used to avoiding the Gray Gardeners. Hellspawn gate guards, no matter\
  \ how ridiculously twisted their horns, simply did not rate. We walked past.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A plague also raged, and we'd noted any number of Korvosans who'd masked\
  \ themselves like hastily deputized Gray Gardeners, neckerchiefs pulled up over\
  \ their faces to keep disease-bearing spirits from flying down their throats. Ours\
  \ were Vudrani silks which had belonged to Rhodel. </p> \n    <p>Perhaps the most\
  \ shocking thing were the imps that perched blatanly on the shoulders of students\
  \ and professors, or lounged on the lintel of the main gate. These stuck out their\
  \ tongues and made evil gestures at the tiny dragons who rode on the shoulders of\
  \ better-minded students and faculty. One older and elegant wizard had a cloud of\
  \ multicolored gemstones orbiting her head, serving as the hoard for the rust red\
  \ drakeling perched atop the jeweled comb holding up her long red hair.</p> \n \
  \   <p>We had floating pomander oranges.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n  \

  \     <br> The Acadamae's discipline of its familiars leaves something to be desired.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>We followed her into the Acadamae's grounds. Before us lay\
  \ the grandest and newest building I'd ever seen in my life.</p> \n    <p>Suddenly\
  \ an imp swooped down. \"Trespassers!\" it shrieked. \"You've no legitimate business!\
  \ You're our lawful prey!\"</p> \n    <p>Norret displayed Dr. Orontius's letter,\
  \ including the seal at the bottom, a calligraphic O that resembled an owl's eye.\
  \ \"On the contrary, we're here to deliver a missive to one of your instructors,\
  \ Zharmides the Godless.\" </p> \n    <p>The little fiend snatched the letter, fluttering\
  \ higher into the air, then turned a backflip as it giggled with infernal mirth.\
  \ \"Didn't you know?\" the creature cried. \"He's dead! Not even of the plague!\
  \ Choked on a fishbone!\" The imp laughed as if this were the most hilarious joke\
  \ in the world. \"But without this letter, you've no legitimate purpose—or even\
  \ with it! Ignorance of the law is no excuse!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Except you've no\
  \ lawful right to that letter either.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Possession is nine-tenths\
  \ of the law!\" the imp countered. \"Care to try for the last tenth?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>It hovered above Norret, just out of arm's reach. While my brother is tall,\
  \ he's not that tall. Norret jumped for it while the imp pulled it out of the way,\
  \ still chortling.</p> \n    <p>Then I saw my brother get angry.</p> \n    <p>Norret\
  \ angry looks a lot like Norret happy, except instead of the corners of his eyes\
  \ going crinkly, his lips go white. He took off his glove, the fringed one with\
  \ the ruby on the back, then reached into his pouch and took out the reefclaw pasty.\
  \ He seasoned it with thieves vinegar and chewed it slowly, his teeth becoming longer\
  \ and sharper, pointed like an eel's.</p> \n    <p>Then his arm shot up and his\
  \ hand—well, I've seen my brother sprout claws like a wolf or a bear, and once even\
  \ talons like an owl, but that was nothing compared to this. His hand changed, growing\
  \ and shifting, becoming a giant crawfish pincer with the top half as big and sharp\
  \ as one of the Final Blades of Galt.</p> \n    <p>The claw snapped like a guillotine.\
  \ The imp's head flew one way, the body another. The letter drifted down.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Norret caught it, his hand once again its normal shape. He tucked the letter\
  \ inside his jacket, put on his unicorn-skin glove, and picked up the imp's body\
  \ by the tail. He stuck the stinger through the stopper of a corked vial and watched\
  \ as unholy venom leaked down the sides.</p> \n    <p>\"Guards! Guards!\" shrieked\
  \ the imps on gate.</p> \n    <p>Norret tossed the imp's body on the ground. It\
  \ smoked, the little fiend dissolving into ectoplasm and ash as Norret turned to\
  \ face the hellspawn guards.</p> \n    <p>\"Is there a problem?\" asked a lilting\
  \ voice. The wizard with the rusty house drake on her comb stepped forward. \"These\
  \ gentlemen are with me.\" Hers was a beautiful smile, sweet as an icon of Shelyn.\
  \ \"They agreed to paint my picture before the Hall of Charms. Isn't that so, gentlemen?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Yes,\" I lied. Norret nodded.</p> \n    <p>The guard with the improbable\
  \ horns snorted. \"Visitors are supposed to sign in at the front gate.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"You are forgetting that the guest book was found to be a source of contagion.\"\
  \ The wizard still smiled her sugary smile. \"Please just put down that Arlunia\
  \ Ehrmande, Lecturer in Charms, has two guests for the afternoon, and try to see\
  \ that those in my retinue are not molested by stray imps.\" The house drake on\
  \ her comb flicked its forked tongue for good measure.</p> \n    <p>\"Of course.\"\
  \ The horned hellspawn bowed.</p> \n    <p>Our rescuer gestured for us to follow.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We accompanied her past a rhododendron hedge and around to where a wide\
  \ lawn opened onto smaller buildings. She gestured to the left to a graceful structure\
  \ partially obscured by a copse of trees. All I could see above them was a marble\
  \ frieze of frolicking satyrs and enticing nymphs. \"The Hall of Charms is always\
  \ lovely in any light, but...\" she mused, tapping one finger to her painted lips,\
  \ \"perhaps, today, another might be more apropos....\" She indicated the building\
  \ directly behind her. \"You're the artists. What do you think?\"</p> \n    <p>What\
  \ I thought was that I'd seen the building before—the House of Joy, the Calistrian\
  \ temple from Isarn. The building's shape was slightly different, but otherwise\
  \ it seemed a perfect copy. Then I realized that the banners of the former palace\
  \ displayed the old king's crest, and instead of the usual bevy of Calistrian beauties,\
  \ the balconies were thronged with pre-revolutionary coquettes, frivolous young\
  \ noblewomen with impossibly high hairdos, fantastically jeweled gowns, and flirtatious\
  \ glances strikingly like the sacred harlots.</p> \n    <p>I blushed and looked\
  \ away.</p> \n    <p>\"Behold,\" said the enchantress, \"the Hall of Lies....\"\
  </p> \n    <p>All at once she changed, like a chalk painting dissolving in rain.\
  \ The woman's rich flowing gown became mouse-gray robes, her long red tresses became\
  \ mouse-brown hair, the cloud of jewels vanished, and her comb became a bunch of\
  \ pencils stuck in a bun. Even the haughty little house drake became a crumple-eared\
  \ orange tabby cat.</p> \n    <p>It had been an illusion, I realized. The Hall of\
  \ Lies had to be one too, since I didn't think it likely that the Acadamae would\
  \ just <i>happen</i> to have a building I recognized so well. </p> \n    <p>The\
  \ woman gave a lop-sided grin. \"I'm not Professor Ehrmande,\" she admitted, \"\
  but I couldn't leave a couple Galtan boys to deal with the hellspawn. My grandfather's\
  \ from Galt, and you sound just like him.\" She appeared decades younger than the\
  \ serene enchantress. \"Besides, I saw that spell with the claw. It's wicked good,\
  \ and I want it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It wasn't a spell,\" Norret admitted.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Alchemy?\" she guessed. \"All I'll say is I'm from Daggermark, and it's\
  \ not a spell <i>yet</i>. Give me the page from your formulary and I'll figure out\
  \ what's missing.\" She grinned and put her hand out. \"Nella. Nella Cailean. Not\
  \ the one from the puppet show and no relation to the really famous one either.\
  \ And not Nellaforia or Nellali, and for Cayden's sake not Nellatirencia. Just plain\
  \ Nella or Nel, Journeyman Fibber. And this,\" she said indicating the snub-nosed\
  \ cat still perched atop her head, its eyes round and bright as two coppers, \"\
  is Lady Marcatella, or Marcat for short. You two?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Norret Gantier,\"\
  \ Norret said, \"and this is my brother, Orlin.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And you have a\
  \ fabulous estate back in Galt that you'll inherit once the Revolution's over?\"\
  \ She paused, looking at our expressions. \"Wait, you're really from Galt? Not just\
  \ the kids of refugees we've got crawling all over the River Kingdoms?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>I didn't know what to say. Here she was admitting that she not only knew\
  \ escaped nobles but that she might even be descended from one and had even given\
  \ her cat a noble title. Then I remembered that I was in Korvosa, not Galt, and\
  \ the Red Revolution was half a world away.</p> \n    <p>\"We're from Dabril,\"\
  \ Norret explained.</p> \n    <p>Nella paused, glancing at Norret's glove and the\
  \ ruby on the back. She chuckled. \"You read Pintgarthe's <i>Lost Jewels</i> too,\
  \ eh? Points for making it look believable. You can't imagine the sort of gaudy\
  \ crap impers try to pass off when they take 'Frauds &amp; Forgeries.' The Hero's\
  \ Tankard made of solid gold chased with pearls? As if!\" She gave us each a hard\
  \ look. \"But what's <i>your</i> scam? Don't try to fib a fibber.\"</p> \n    <p>Norret\
  \ reached into his jacket. \"We're just here to deliver a letter.\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ looked at the letter and laughed. \"You're after Zharmides' lost books too?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Lost books?\" I was confused. I'd thought we were after a snuffbox.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"What, you really don't know? The imp told you straight: Zharmides is\
  \ dead. Choked on a fishbone down at the Posh and Turtle. The professors have been\
  \ accusing each other of stealing his books 'cause everyone wanted his spells. Speaking\
  \ of which, you owe me one.\" She put out her hand.</p> \n    <p>Norret sighed and\
  \ got out his formulary, his alchemical workbook. He pulled a blank page out of\
  \ the back, took out his silver pencil, and began copying notes and scraps. It took\
  \ a while, but at last he folded it and held it up out of Nella's reach. \"A question\
  \ first: Where's Zharmides' body now?\"</p> \n    <p>Nella shrugged. \"No great\
  \ secret. The government's ordered all the dead taken to the plague pits in the\
  \ Gray District and burned. The Acadamae's torched its dead in the Cube.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"And the ashes?\"</p> \n    <p>She paused. \"Sent to the Hall of Whispers\
  \ for its columbarium.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Columbarium?\" I said.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ nodded, slightly so as to not dislodge her cat, which I realized had no tail.\
  \ \"Dome filled with cinerary urns: books for students, busts for instructors, full-on\
  \ bronzes for headmasters, and a necromantic circle in middle so you can talk to\
  \ their spirits, though it works a bit better if the urn has actual ashes in it.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>I could already summon spirits–or at least one–without ashes, so I\
  \ was less impressed than I might be. I heard a giggle, a bit too high-pitched and\
  \ far too nasty to be Rhodel.</p> \n    <p>Nella raised her hand, adjusting her\
  \ bun or her pencils or the cat who was sitting on them, but her pinkie was out\
  \ at an odd angle and her cat was looking the same direction. I looked where both\
  \ pointed. Norret did too, adjusting the lenses of his monocle.</p> \n    <p>Dr.\
  \ Orontius once told me that three or more imps are called \"an impudence.\" The\
  \ impudence that was fluttering nearby scattered, spooked.</p> \n    <p>Norret looked\
  \ back to Nella. \"But Zharmides died outside the Acadamae.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Right,\"\
  \ she said, \"and no one's wanting to search the plague carts to see if they've\
  \ burned his body yet. The conjurers are pissed 'cause, if he'd had an imp, they\
  \ could summon it and ask for his soul, but Zharmides, just to be contrary, had\
  \ a homunculus.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Homunculus?\" I repeated, confused.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Homunculus?\" Norret said the same word delightedly.</p> \n    <p>He and she exchanged\
  \ looks, and she explained, \"It's an artificial imp.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's made\
  \ out of a mandrake root,\" Norret continued, \"and that's not quite accurate.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"It's a foot-high manikin with fangs and bat wings.\" Nella waved\
  \ flippantly. \"About the only visible difference is that an imp has a poisoned\
  \ tail, while your classic homunculus has poison teeth.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So what\
  \ did Zharmides look like?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The spell first?\"</p> \n    <p>Norret\
  \ handed her the folded paper.</p> \n    <p>She opened it and almost absentmindedly\
  \ stepped over to the Hall of Lies and tapped one of the statues flanking the door—\
  that of a cavorting nymphette with precariously tall hair.</p> \n    <p>The statue's\
  \ illusion flickered, feminine trading for masculine, youth for age, and hard marble\
  \ for living flesh, now appearing as a stooped, thin-faced old wizard leaning on\
  \ a gold-topped cane. The brocade of his waistcoat was woven over and over with\
  \ stylized Zs, and the same sigil was engraved on the wax seal hanging as fob from\
  \ his watch chain. I didn't see a snuffbox, but I noted a telltale bulge beneath\
  \ his pocket square.</p> \n    <p>Norret took a vial from his bandolier and sipped\
  \ it, flipped to a blank page in his formulary, took his silver pencil in hand,\
  \ and began to sketch.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Bringing out the dead\
