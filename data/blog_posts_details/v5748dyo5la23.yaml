  artist: "The Marriage cannot be parted. Note how both the Forge's hammer and the\
    \ Marriage's crown are positioned in the middle of the left-hand-side of their\
    \ respective cards. As hinted at in the past, the alignment of each icon and the\
    \ icons themselves all mean something specific for the cards. Where the position\
    \ of its icon determines the card's overall demeanor, the icon itself keeps score\
    \ of an ability the card represents. Harrow releases in only a few weeks. When\
    \ it does, I foresee in your future years of enjoyment. Mike McArtor GameMastery\
    \ Editor"
