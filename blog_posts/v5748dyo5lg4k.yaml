  >Mummy's Mask</a> opens with <a href=\"/products/btpy94qz\">\"The Half-Dead City,\"\
  </a> in which the heroes explore numerous abandoned sites in a sealed Osirian necropolis.\
  \ It's a classic task for Pathfinders, and as a result, I made sure to sanction\
  \ this as a Tier 1–2 adventure that players can enjoy again and again. Of course,\
  \ one cannot expect the disturbed dead to remain quiet, and they strike back in\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy94vv\">\"Empty Graves,\"</a> sanctioned for levels 4–\
  6.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9079-Wati.jpg\"\

  \     <br>Illustration by Francesco Graziani\n    </div> \n    <p>Of course, Osirion\
  \ doesn't have a monopoly on intrigue and adventure. <a href=\"/products/btpy93qw\"\
  >\"Tears at Bitter Manor\"</a> begins in Cassomir on Taldor's coast and travels\
  \ deep into the countryside. You may find some similarities to <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvy\"\
  >\"The Dragon's Demand\"</a> in how it is sanctioned, such as the multiple Chronicle\
  \ sheets that each grant 3 XP and 4 Prestige Points; however, this time the entire\
  \ module is sanctioned for play—not just a large part of it. “Campaign mode\" is\
  \ still an option, of course, and there's a little something extra for players who\
  \ are willing to go the extra mile when they play through the whole adventure. You\
  \ may find the <a href=\"/products/btpy921i\">module's campaign cards</a> particularly\
  \ useful in that regard.</p> \n    <p>What? No, don't peek! Go play it! You can\
  \ find the Chronicle sheets on the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources page</a> or on the respective product pages.</p> \n    <p>While\
  \ we're on the topic of sanctioning adventures, let me give you an update on other\
  \ projects. <a href=\"/products/btpy92lr\">\"Wardens of the Reborn Forge\"</a> has\
  \ gone through several revisions and is almost done, and we'll add that to the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\">Additional Resources page</a>\
  \ soon. More of Mummy's Mask will also be appearing between now and Gen Con. When\
  \ these update, we'll post an update on the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2oi02\">Additional\
  \ Resources Updates thread</a>. Also, we wouldn't forget about <a href=\"/products/btpy959k\"\
  >\"Risen from the Sands,\"</a> which is this year's Free RPG Day module set to debut\
  \ on June 21, 2014.</p> \n    <p>What about that <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\"\
  >Emerald Spire Superdungeon</a>? Yep, the plan is to sanction it, though I'm still\
  \ in the earlier stages of that process. There's too much dungeon delve goodness\
  \ for us not to share this with the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Finally, I'd like to thank Nathan King for his hard work behind the scenes\
  \ to help me sanction these and other adventures. Nathan's been a volunteer author\
  \ of numerous boons dating back to Gen Con 2013, and he's also contributed to numerous\
  \ other sanctioning projects. Much appreciated, Nathan!</p> \n    <p>Happy gaming!</p>\
