  \ \n     <p>By the time she'd come of age, Zova had long known she didn't fit in\
  \ with the Clan of the Moon.</p> \n     <p>Although Zova's parents loved her and\
  \ supported her in all ways, she was still the only daughter among four siblings,\
  \ and while she got on well with her brothers, she often felt left out. As Zova\
  \ grew older, her parents' Desnan teachings intrigued her, yet she felt a stronger\
  \ kinship to the animals of the world than to the night sky above. In training for\
  \ the hunt, Zova reveled in the act of stalking and pouncing like the animals she\
  \ so empathized with, but she found herself impatient with her mother's preferred\
  \ method of hunting with the bow and struggled to train her own archery skills.\
  \ In time, when her friends began to flirt and pursue romantic trysts, Zova realized\
  \ that while she valued and greatly enjoyed the company of those friends, she felt\
  \ no drive to find such a romantic partner for herself. Increasingly she found herself\
  \ restless, curious about the world beyond the Cinderlands. She'd seen illustrations\
  \ and heard stories of the vast oceans, glacial wonderlands, and above all else\
  \ the wonders of the deep forest, but paintings and tales could not sate her curiosity.\
  \ Where the Clan of the Moon's territories in the arid west of the Cinderlands seemed\
  \ to contain all the necessities of life for everyone she knew, Zova longed for\
  \ the color green.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Zova's parents saw it\
  \ coming, of course, well before she made clear her intention to travel the world\
  \ and seek its wonders. They worried for her safety, but they also knew that of\
  \ all their children, Zova's passion for life, her respect for the natural world,\
  \ her keen perception, and her almost uncanny knack for getting the upper hand in\
  \ a fight made her the best suited to leave the proverbial nest. Despite her awkward\
  \ place in the clan, she still loved her family and adored her home, and promised\
  \ to return as often as she could—and to bring stories of marvels from her adventures\
  \ when she did.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1140-Zova.jpg\"\

  \ by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>She had no real plan or timetable\
  \ to follow as she left the Cinderlands, knowing only that she wished to travel\
  \ west, toward the oft-glimpsed lands of vibrant green she'd long been lured by.\
  \ Whenever she felt homesick, Zova found she need only look to the sky to feel at\
  \ home, knowing she gazed upon the same sights her family did. The moon was always\
  \ there, a welcome and soothing constant in her life. As days turned to weeks, Zova\
  \ found that nature itself was a more than adequate surrogate family, and more besides.\
  \ Though she had always felt alone in crowds as a child, watching everyone else\
  \ interact with each other, here in the natural world she felt like she belonged.\
  \ The animals of the world were as companionable as anyone as long as they were\
  \ treated with respect—and certainly more diverse and interesting as a whole than\
  \ the people she'd known up to that point!</p> \n     <p>The Storval Rise presented\
  \ Zova her first significant challenge. She knew of its existence, but had never\
  \ seen the massive cliffs with her own eyes. Standing atop them, the sweeping expanse\
  \ of greenery below seemed to taunt her—so near, yet so far. The carefree antics\
  \ of falcons as they swooped out over the cliff filled Zova not with jealousy, but\
  \ with inspiration. If only she could fly, she could join them in their graceful\
  \ exits from the Cinderlands! But as she watched the falcons hunt and play, she\
  \ felt her own perception grow keen, like a kinship with the raptors was waking\
  \ in her vision. As if using a falcon's eyes while gazing down the cliffside, Zova\
  \ found that she could pick a treacherous but navigable path down the cliffs. She\
  \ did not marvel at this—she accepted it with simple pride.</p> \n     <p>Despite\
  \ her keen eyesight, Zova's descent was fraught with peril. She nearly died thrice\
  \ on the climb (twice to near falls, once to a redback rattlesnake she accidently\
  \ stepped upon and was only just able to calm before it bit her), but late that\
  \ night, as the waxing moon rose, she finally set foot into the Ashwood. Lit by\
  \ the moon, the forest's greens appeared almost black, yet Zova reveled nonetheless.\
  \ Here was the world she'd dreamed of, a realm that she had to imagine back home\
  \ in the scrubby Cinderland hills. For the remainder of the night and well into\
  \ the next day, Zova sprinted and explored, climbed trees and delved into tangles\
  \ of roots, hunted and played and delighted until she finally came to a toppled\
  \ statue along the banks of a rushing river. She made camp in the shelter formed\
  \ by the oversized statue's moss-draped chin, and soon collapsed into exhausted\
  \ sleep.</p> \n     <p>When she woke, it was deep night once again. The now-full\
  \ moon's light filtered through the canopy in pale beams, and while the ground was\
  \ hard and the air was cool, it was the peal of an unearthly howl that had roused\
  \ Zova from sleep. The howl was unlike anything she had ever heard—plainly the cry\
  \ of an alpha wolf, yet carrying within it tones of malevolence and cruelty that\
  \ felt far too human. Truly frightened for the first time in her life, Zova staggered\
  \ to her feet and took her bow in hand, only to find campsite surrounded by a pack\
  \ of the largest wolves she had ever seen.</p> \n     <p>For the first few moments,\
  \ Zova's arrows held the strangely aggressive pack at bay, but as the fight wore\
  \ on, it became apparent to the wolves that Zova was no predator of note. Her arrows\
  \ missed more often than not, and those lucky few that scored hits were only glancing\
  \ blows. As she fought, Zova did her best to empathize with the wolves, only to\
  \ realize in horror that a stronger will than her own imposed upon them. When the\
  \ wolves finally overcame all fear of her archery, Zova threw aside her useless\
  \ bow and reached for her knife—only to find she had lost it at some point during\
  \ the previous night's enraptured frolic through the woods. The wolves closed in,\
  \ and Zova feared her journey was about to come to a sudden end.</p> \n     <p>Again\
  \ that malignant howl scarred the night, and Zova could feel a presence approaching\
  \ through the tangles. As the wolves closed their circle around her, she found herself\
  \ hoping that the wolves would kill her before whatever hateful thing they obeyed\
  \ arrived to finish the job. When the first wolf struck, she frantically swiped\
  \ at it with her hand, a desperate attempt of self-preservation. For a few moments,\
  \ she couldn't understand what had caused the wolf's yelp of pain and its sudden\
  \ retreat. The other wolves had frozen as well, as if confused—a confusion that\
  \ Zova felt as she looked down at her bloodstained hands... only to see that they\
  \ were now bloodstained talons.</p> \n     <p>The will to survive rose in Zova,\
  \ and with a snarl, she went on the offensive. She lunged at the next wolf, slashing\
  \ across its snout with the birdlike talon that, a moment before, had been her hand.\
  \ Again and again she cut and clawed, and the wolves, unsettled by her transformation,\
  \ fell back. Zova became the predator, and as the last wolf fled, she held high\
  \ her talons and cried out in triumph.</p> \n     <p>That cry was answered by the\
  \ selfsame hateful howl. The master of the wolves had come. Zova whirled, raised\
  \ her claws in a challenge, and froze in fear. What had emerged from the darkest\
  \ part of Ashwood was neither person nor beast—nor was it strictly alive. A ghostly\
  \ form, seemingly shed from moonlight itself, crouched in the air above, a towering\
  \ man-wolf with orange eyes, fur that shimmered and wavered in unfelt wind, and\
  \ teeth and claws of all-too-solid razor-sharp bone. Yet what the thing said was\
  \ the crowning horror.</p> \n     <p>\"Welcome, sister...\"</p> \n     <p>Zova didn't\
  \ attempt to fight. She whirled and fled, never looking back as the mad howl of\
  \ the ghost wolf pursued her. She clambered onto the toppled statue, sprinted across\
  \ its brow, and plunged from its crown into the churning river below. Perhaps it\
  \ was the current's speed that saved her, or perhaps it was the ghost's inability\
  \ to pursue, or maybe it was just luck. Whatever the cause, Zova washed ashore a\
  \ mile downstream, barely alive—but alive she was.</p> \n     <p>Zova never returned\
  \ to the Ashwood. Those to whom she's told her tale smirk in disbelief—not from\
  \ claims of an encounter with a ghost wolf (for many parts of Varisia host stranger\
  \ terrors than ghosts or werewolves), but that she had escaped to tell the tale\
  \ at all. The legend of Loper, the ghostwolf of Ashwood, has frightened many listeners,\
  \ for in most of these tales the victims are lucky just to survive. Zova never revealed\
  \ to anyone the two words Loper spoke to her that night, yet she feels that in those\
  \ two words lies the explanation of her escape. She vowed to some day return to\
  \ Ashwood and solve this mystery—preferably in the company of a group of adventurers,\
  \ for a faithful pack brings so much more to a fight than can a lone predator!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Until that day, Zova travels from town to town, exploring her growing\
  \ power as a shifter and the confusing nature of adventuring party dynamics. Her\
  \ protective nature is augmented by the compassion she feels for these all-too-often\
  \ orphans, for she knows she is not the norm among her traveling companions in having\
  \ a family who loves her and a home she can some day return to.</p> \n     <p>Yet\
  \ on nights when the moon rises high and unwelcome dreams torment her sleep, Zova\
  \ can't help but wonder—are those she calls her brothers really her brothers at\
  \ all?</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>James Jacobs<br> <i>Creative Director, Pathfinder</i></p>\
