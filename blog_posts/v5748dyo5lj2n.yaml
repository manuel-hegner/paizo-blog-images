  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>Once a notorious pirate, Jendara has at last\
  \ returned to the cold northern isles of her birth, ready to settle down and raise\
  \ her young son. Yet when a mysterious tsunami wracks her island's shore, she and\
  \ her fearless crew must sail out to explore the strange island that's risen from\
  \ the sea floor...</i></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter 1: Harbor Wave</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Jendara put down the file and checked the edge of her blade. She'd worked\
  \ out the last of the nicks, but the sword could use a touch of the whetstone to\
  \ bring out the edge. She reached for the bottle of oil at her elbow and paused.\
  \ It was the kind of autumn morning in the Ironbound Archipelago that she loved.\
  \ The smoke of her village's fires rose up in straight blue streaks, and the sound\
  \ of children at play resounded in the crisp air.</p> \n     <p>\"Ho, Jendara!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>She turned from her makeshift workbench, a split length of driftwood\
  \ balanced on two fat stumps, already smiling. \"Good morning, Boruc.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"No sign of the Milady yet?\" The big man tucked his thumbs into his belt—\
  nearly hidden under the bulge of his belly—and glanced out at the harbor. </p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Not yet, but the tide only turned a few hours ago. The boatyards at Halgrim\
  \ aren't that close.\"</p> \n     <p>\"That captain husband of yours ought to hurry.\"\
  \ Boruc grinned, and his teeth showed brightly against the red of his beard. A native\
  \ islander like Jendara, he'd become one of her closest friends in the time since\
  \ she'd returned to the archipelago. \"Doesn't he know it's your birthday?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You remembered?\" She laughed and got to her feet.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ ground moved beneath her in a sickening shudder.</p> \n     <p>She grabbed onto\
  \ the workbench to steady herself. The earth jolted and jumped, and from the cottage\
  \ behind her came the smashing of glass. A heavy yelm of thatch crashed down off\
  \ the roof.</p> \n     <p>Her mind leaped to her son. \"Kran!\" She stumbled as\
  \ the ground gave a last shake, then found her footing again. She sheathed the sword\
  \ and broke into a run. \"He went to the beach with Oric and that damn dog.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You ain't got much time,\" Boruc warned.</p> \n     <p>Jendara knew\
  \ it. She'd grown up on an island not that different from this one, and she'd spent\
  \ her life on the sea—she'd seen what could happen after an earthquake. She scanned\
  \ the horizon. It was probably too early for the ocean to rise up, but given the\
  \ power of the shaking, the tsunami wouldn't be long.</p> \n     <p>A woman raced\
  \ out into the street. \"Fire! My house is on fire!\"</p> \n     <p>Any other time,\
  \ the rest of the village would have rushed to help her, but not now. People stumbled\
  \ out of their houses, running uphill. Jendara could already see the tide turning\
  \ in the harbor, the water pulling itself away from the shore like a blanket whipped\
  \ back from a muddy bed. </p> \n     <p>\"Kran!\" she bellowed. The boy had brains.\
  \ He knew he had to get away from the shore. </p> \n     <p>A man shoved her aside.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"Hey!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Gotta get uphill!\" he shouted over his\
  \ shoulder, and she saw the chicken clutched under his arm and the blue beads strung\
  \ in his beard. The baker, Norg.</p> \n     <p>His wife ran behind him. \"Get out\
  \ of here, Jendara!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Kran!\" Jendara shouted again. The boats at\
  \ the piers were already high and dry. </p> \n     <p>\"Jendara!\" A tall man with\
  \ sandy hair and beard—Morul—caught her by the arm. \"Tell me the boys are already\
  \ headed up to Boruc's house.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I haven't found them yet.\" She\
  \ caught the look of panic in his eyes. \"I'll get the boys. You get Leyla to high\
  \ ground!\"</p> \n     <p>\"She can't walk yet—the fever's got her knocked out.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Then you better hurry!\"</p> \n     <p>She broke away from him,\
  \ her own fear climbing in her throat. Kran was a smart lad and levelheaded for\
  \ a twelve-year-old. He should have made it up from the beach by now.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The crowds pressed against her and she found herself shoving aside old men,\
  \ children—anyone that stood between her and her son. She could already see the\
  \ ridge of water forming on the horizon. It didn't look like much right now, but\
  \ she knew these waves to be deceptive. When it hit the island, it could be devastating.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Her boots slid on the mud of the beach. Were they down by the boats\
  \ or over by the caves? The beach itself was empty, dotted with abandoned clam shovels\
  \ and buckets.</p> \n     <p>\"Kran!\"</p> \n     <p>He couldn't answer, of course.\
  \ That only made it all the worse. Her boy, her precious boy, was mute.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Help!\"</p> \n     <p>But Oric wasn't. Kran's best friend shrieked like\
  \ a stuck pig, his voice bouncing off the rocks by the caves. Anger lit Jendara's\
  \ blood on fire. Even on a good day, the caves were dangerous.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ raced toward the rocks.</p> \n     <p>And then skidded to a stop. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Oh, shit.\" </p> \n     <p>She stared at the two boys on the nearest outcropping\
  \ of rocks, unable to quite make sense of what was happening. Her son had Oric by\
  \ the arm, but the other lad was clearly stuck between the two great rocks—a space\
  \ she herself had passed through a dozen times collecting mussels.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Help!\" Oric screamed again. Kran looked over his shoulder, his eyes black circles\
  \ in a too-white face. His little dog burst out of the gap between the rocks, whimpering.\
  \ She was caught in something as well—some kind of thick, sparkly rope had wound\
  \ itself around her chest, binding her to the stones.</p> \n     <p>Jendara scrambled\
  \ up beside Kran. The ocean began to growl softly, the sound of all the rocks and\
  \ debris it had sucked up now grinding along at the bottom of the sea bed. She could\
  \ feel sweat prickling in her armpits.</p> \n     <p>The same tough rope had snared\
  \ Oric, she saw. Jendara drew her sword. She'd never seen rope like this. It clung\
  \ to the tow-headed boy with the stickiness of tar, and it shimmered with a pale\
  \ purple-blue light. It reminded her of a spider's web—if the spider were the size\
  \ of a small cottage.</p> \n     <p>She hacked through it, glad she'd sharpened\
  \ her blade. The roaring was getting louder.</p> \n     <p>Kran jumped down beside\
  \ the dog, pulling on its front legs.</p> \n     <p>\"Cut the dog free,\" Jendara\
  \ snapped at him. </p> \n     <p>He shook his head wildly and held up an empty hand.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Where's your damned belt knife?\" </p> \n     <p> \"He must have left\
  \ it at my house.\" Oric was nearly babbling. He wriggled and twitched as the words\
  \ bubbled out. \"We were whittling and then we needed mussels for your birthday\
  \ dinner and—\" He broke off at the fury in her eyes.</p> \n     <p>She seized the\
  \ boy by the armpits and yanked him free of the rocks. A strip of skin ripped free\
  \ of the back of her hand, stuck fast to the strange silk, and she hissed. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Now run!\" She slashed the binding on the dog and then sheathed her\
  \ sword. \"Get running, both of you!\"</p> \n     <p>They slipped and slid on the\
  \ mud. The dog raced past them. It might have been a half-sized, ugly thing, but\
  \ it wasn't stupid. </p> \n     <p>Jendara risked a glance over her shoulder. The\
  \ wave had picked up speed. It towered over the bay, a wall of mud and debris ready\
  \ to crash down and swallow the island. They were never going to make it to the\
  \ safety of the hilltop.</p> \n     <p>She put on a burst of speed to pass the boys.\
  \ \"To the meeting hall!\" She stretched her hand behind her and caught Kran's sleeve.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The meeting hall was the largest and sturdiest building in the\
  \ village, and stood on a knoll of rock above the main street. Decorative finials\
  \ stuck up from each end of the high ridgeline of its shingled roof, while colorfully\
  \ painted columns outlined a covered porch. She ran her hands over the green-and-blue\
  \ surface of the nearest column. Kran wouldn't have any problem shinnying up it.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"On the roof,\" she ordered. He was up the column in a flash, and then\
  \ immediately put out his hand to help his friend. Oric leaped onto the column but\
  \ slid down again. He was bigger than Kran and less agile.</p> \n     <p>Jendara\
  \ gave him a shove and let him scramble up onto her shoulders. His boot knocked\
  \ into her head as he struggled up onto the roof. </p> \n     <p>The dog whimpered.</p>\

  \ <br><i>Illustration by Jesper Ejsing</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Jendara risked\
  \ a look over her shoulder and felt her stomach twist. The sea had arrived in the\
  \ harbor. It raised itself above the beach, hoisting longships and sailboats up\
  \ into its muddy mass with a nasty crashing crunch.</p> \n     <p>There was no time\
  \ for shinnying up the column. Jendara grabbed the dog by its collar and flung it\
  \ onto the porch roof. Then she jammed her belt knife into the column and pulled\
  \ herself up. Her hand closed on the edge of the roof as the great wave hit the\
  \ first row of houses.</p> \n     <p>Walls boomed and crumpled, wooden joints screeching\
  \ as they ground together. Jendara hung for a second, and then Kran grabbed the\
  \ back of her jacket. She came up onto the roof.</p> \n     <p>It wasn't high enough\
  \ here. They had to get to the top of the building, the ridgeline with its finials—\
  they could hang onto those.</p> \n     <p>\"Up!\" she shouted. </p> \n     <p>Kran\
  \ was already moving. The next section of roof was much higher and steeper, and\
  \ for a second she thought he wouldn't be able to get a grip on it, but he did.\
  \ Oric was right behind him. He caught a shingle and dangled for second. Then the\
  \ shingle broke free.</p> \n     <p>The boy hit the roof of the porch and slid down.\
  \ Jendara lunged for him. Her fingers closed on his wrist and his weight hit the\
  \ end of his arm with a crack. He screamed in pain and grabbed her with his other\
  \ hand just as the wave smashed into the side of the meeting hall.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ water slammed down on Jendara, driving out light and air and all sense of up or\
  \ down. An incredible crackling and ripping resounded around her. For a second,\
  \ she couldn't breathe.</p> \n     <p>Then with a powerful crunching, the porch\
  \ roof ripped free of the meeting hall. Jendara gasped for air as she popped to\
  \ the surface of the water.</p> \n     <p>The roof slid along the side of the meeting\
  \ hall, riding the muddy mass of the wave. Oric clung to her, and she clung to the\
  \ edge of the porch. If the roof broke apart or sank, the debris caught in the floodwater\
  \ would crush them.</p> \n     <p>The wave drove them into the side of the next\
  \ house. The walls had cracked and buckled against the power of the water. Wood\
  \ groaned and snapped all around them. Over the powerful stink of mud and brine,\
  \ the smell of smoke was choking. The earthquake had caused its own damage via fireplaces\
  \ and woodstoves.</p> \n     <p>She looked around, desperate for her boy. She made\
  \ out his silhouette on the still-intact ridgeline of the meeting hall and felt\
  \ herself relax a little. If he was still all right, she could focus on saving herself\
  \ and Oric.</p> \n     <p>\"Jendara!\" Oric's voice cracked with fear.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Jendara whipped her head around. A wall of debris was headed right for them:\
  \ wood and rubble and a still-recognizable door, jutting out of the swirling water\
  \ like a giant knife. </p> \n     <p>Jendara shoved against the broken house. She\
  \ wasn't going to die pinned to a cottage, stabbed to death and buried in muck.\
  \ She'd killed a giant and a troll and faced down a horde of barbarian shapeshifters.\
  \ She had a family, a business, friends. Damn it, she wasn't going to drown!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The porch roof popped free of the broken house. The figurehead of a\
  \ longship smashed into the wall where they'd been trapped, and with a groan, the\
  \ house began to collapse on itself. The porch roof bobbed into the middle of the\
  \ street. The water had carried them uphill, but it was still up to the bottoms\
  \ of the windows, at least four feet high, and it would only get higher until the\
  \ floodwaters withdrew.</p> \n     <p>Jendara searched for safety. They couldn't\
  \ stay on this makeshift raft. Another wave would rip it apart or smash it into\
  \ bits. Her eye caught the building on the far side of the street—the blacksmith's.\
  \ The only stone building in the village. Its porch wasn't much, but it was the\
  \ best shelter she could see. </p> \n     <p>She grabbed a length of board floating\
  \ beside her and poled hard. The road beneath her climbed the hill, and the current\
  \ was fighting her now as the water pulled back for its next pounding wave. The\
  \ raft shuddered as it moved slowly through the churning water.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ drove her pole between the slats of someone's garden fence. The support column\
  \ for the blacksmith's overhanging roof was just a few feet away. Someplace nearby\
  \ someone screamed for help, and her heart gave a squeeze. </p> \n     <p>But she\
  \ couldn't help anyone if she didn't help herself first. </p> \n     <p>She jerked\
  \ her chin at the porch, arms trembling to hold the roof-raft in place. \"Get over\
  \ there!\" </p> \n     <p>Oric grabbed onto the fence with his good hand and jumped\
  \ off the raft. The water was shoulder deep on him, but he didn't complain. He might\
  \ not have Kran's stoicism, but he was still an islander through and through. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Jendara jumped off the raft. The water tugged the raft away in an instant,\
  \ smashing it into a floating log. It sank immediately.</p> \n     <p>Here on the\
  \ other side of the sturdy garden fence, there was a little less floating debris.\
  \ A plow sluiced past, grinding against Jendara's side and bumping up against the\
  \ fence with a heavy thud. She hoped the fence would hold a little longer.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Wading was hard. The water pulled her back with every step, and rocks and\
  \ broken tree branches slammed against her chest and legs. Oric slipped and slid,\
  \ then made it up onto the porch. Though the difference in height was slight, she\
  \ thanked the ancestors as she followed him up onto the porch. There was less wreckage\
  \ moving in the water, and the current wasn't as strong. She took hold of the porch\
  \ column, then frowned. </p> \n     <p>Oric gripped the column with one arm, but\
  \ the other hung uselessly at his side. He must have dislocated it when she'd grabbed\
  \ him on the roof. If another big wave hit, he'd be gone.</p> \n     <p>She felt\
  \ for her belt, the leather stiff in the saltwater. Cursing, she got it off and\
  \ around the column. \"Grab onto that,\" she ordered.</p> \n     <p>Then the next\
  \ wave hit, and all she could do was cling to the column and the boy and try to\
  \ protect her head as mud and smashed stonework and broken bits of everything battered\
  \ them. She coughed and spluttered. </p> \n     <p>The next wave seemed a little\
  \ smaller—or perhaps she was simply used to it. She lost count of them as they came,\
  \ driving flotsam into the corners of the porch and dragging it back out into the\
  \ street. A dead duck washed up against the pillar and floated in the eddy, its\
  \ yellow feet sticking up in the air as the water spun it in a slow circle. Then\
  \ it sank beneath the muck.</p> \n     <p>Between the waves, she stared at the roof\
  \ of the meeting hall and watched Kran and the dog huddle in silent misery as the\
  \ water slowly withdrew. He had never felt so far away, and she had never been so\
  \ powerless to help him. She had thrown away her old life—a dangerous life, to be\
  \ sure, spent serving bloodthirsty Besmara, the pirate goddess—to find someplace\
  \ safe to finish bringing up her boy. Leave it to nature to prove her wrong.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Oric shivered beside her, and she risked letting go of the column to\
  \ grip his shoulder. If only he hadn't gotten caught in that stuff down by the rocks,\
  \ that strange silky rope like spider webbing. They would all be up at Boruc's house\
  \ waiting for the water to recede, warm and dry and safe. </p> \n     <p>It was\
  \ just bad luck, she supposed. As the Varisians might say, it was just a bad alignment\
  \ of the stars, bringing misfortune down upon their entire village. She shivered\
  \ and tightened her grip on the column. </p> \n     <p>The breeze strengthened,\
  \ pushing aside a few clouds and inviting the sun to play on the surface of the\
  \ floodwaters. They were receding, she realized. The houses on this stretch of the\
  \ street were badly battered, and the ones closer to the beach were smashed and\
  \ ruined, but at least the worst was over.</p> \n     <p>\"I've got to get Kran,\"\
  \ she told Oric. \"You stay here.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Don't leave me!\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"You'll be fine. The water's going down. And Kran's been alone this whole\
  \ time.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We would have all been out of here if he hadn't wanted\
  \ to make you that stupid present,\" Oric grumbled. </p> \n     <p>Jendara shot\
  \ him a stern look. \"You'll be fine,\" she repeated. She took a careful step down\
  \ from the porch. Something shifted beneath her feet and she gritted her teeth.\
  \ There was no way to see what lay beneath the surface of the water—the stuff was\
  \ as opaque as milk and as dark as garden soil. The worst might be over, but that\
  \ didn't mean it was safe.</p> \n     <p>It was like capturing a rival pirate ship,\
  \ she thought, setting her foot carefully before taking the next cautious step.\
  \ They fought hard on the deck and you felt your blood boil as you cut your way\
  \ forward, knowing every hand was set to kill you. But that was only the obvious\
  \ danger. Down below was where the real nasty stuff waited: the injured happy to\
  \ take someone to Pharasma's Boneyard when they went, the vicious cook devoted to\
  \ his captain, the booby traps some loyal mate had set when all seemed lost. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Back in her pirate days, she'd seen plenty of her crewmates killed after\
  \ the battle was ostensibly won, and she'd learned a thing or two. She kept her\
  \ focus on the ground and the debris floating around her knees, and she moved slowly,\
  \ even if every bit of her wanted to race back to the meeting hall and make sure\
  \ Kran was all right.</p> \n     <p>Then she was there. The porch columns were slick\
  \ with mud, and some stood at odd angles. She didn't trust them. She looked around\
  \ for an alternate route.</p> \n     <p>To her left, Kran's dog barked.</p> \n \
  \    <p>She turned. The dog stood on the canted roof of the house beside the hall.\
  \ At some point, a massive fir tree had toppled down on the broken house, and now\
  \ lay at an angle, its top driven into the colorful wall of the meeting hall and\
  \ its roots tangled in the wreckage below. The dog must have climbed down the tree.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Smarter than you look,\" she grumbled. The yellow-and-white mutt wasn't\
  \ the companion she would have picked for her boy. It wasn't a sturdy herding dog\
  \ or a fine hound bred for hunting, just some stray he'd found by the docks, good\
  \ for nothing but eating Jendara's venison. \"Come here ...\" She tried to remember\
  \ its name. \"Fylga. Come.\"</p> \n     <p>The dog scrambled onto the tree trunk\
  \ and began climbing back up to the roof of the meeting hall. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  Or maybe not.\" Jendara picked her way toward the base of the tree and gave it a\
  \ shove. It felt solid. </p> \n     <p>In the distance, wood groaned and crumpled.\
  \ Someone called for help again, the voice thin and tired. She had to get moving;\
  \ people needed her.</p> \n     <p>\"Kran!\" </p> \n     <p>The boy peered over\
  \ the roofline at her. He pointed at the tree and spread his hands questioningly.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"It's safe, I think. But hurry!\"</p> \n     <p>He came down the tree\
  \ cautiously, clinging to it like a bear cub. Jendara found herself reaching for\
  \ him before he even made it to the halfway point. Her lip hurt from biting into\
  \ it. The meeting hall could collapse, the tree could shift, the house could crumple\
  \ more—</p> \n     <p>And then she had a hold of him and he was on the ground and\
  \ she was squeezing him tight, tighter than she'd hugged him in years. He was twelve,\
  \ after all. And he'd never been a cuddly boy, even when he'd been little.</p> \n\
  \     <p>He kissed her cheek and hugged her back. Then he pulled away, a smile spreading\
  \ over his face. With his black hair hanging in wet clumps, that smile looked even\
  \ whiter and broader than usual.</p> \n     <p>He pointed at the demolished house\
  \ beside them, and it took Jendara a minute to make out what he saw in the midst\
  \ of the broken beams and the sludge of mud. There was only the hint of colorful\
  \ paint to remind her of the meeting hall's porch columns, one of which had been\
  \ driven through the ruins of the house next door.</p> \n     <p>And there, jutting\
  \ out of what had probably been a blue-and-green painted sea star, was the belt\
  \ knife she'd stabbed into the wood as a handhold just before the wave had hit.\
  \ Kran wrenched it free with a grunt, and handed it to her, beaming.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Maybe her stars weren't so badly aligned after all.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
