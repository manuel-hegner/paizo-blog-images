  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Mother Bears</h1> \n   <p>by Wendy N. Wagner</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Fires by Day</h2> \n   <p>Jendara followed Tam's light,\
  \ feeling the cave's blackness like velvet pressing against her skin, her nostrils.\
  \ She wanted to run outside before the cave smothered her. But she couldn't stop\
  \ thinking of that horrible wail. It wasn't Kran—he could make a few sounds, but\
  \ none so loud or carrying. She reminded herself of that fact again and again.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>It still made her skin crawl.</p> \n   <p>\"Remember,\" Tam called over\
  \ his shoulder. \"Keep an eye on the person ahead of you. The floor of these places\
  \ isn't always—\"</p> \n   <p>His voice cut off in a scream and his light disappeared.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Jendara darted forward. \"Tam!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Jendara, stop!\" Vorrin\
  \ shouted.</p> \n   <p>She froze. By the glow of her lantern, she could see the\
  \ sudden drop Tam hadn't. The tunnel opened into great mouthing darkness that her\
  \ lantern barely began to light. \"Are you all right?\"</p> \n   <p>\"My arm's caught.\"\
  \ Tam grunted. \"Caught bad.\"</p> \n   <p>Vorrin knelt beside her. \"I can wrap\
  \ a rope around this bit of stalagmite, lower you down. Be some work getting the\
  \ two of you up again, but I can manage it.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara held her lantern\
  \ over the cliff’s edge, getting a glimpse of Tam's red hair about seven feet below\
  \ her, just above the floor of what must be a vast cavern. The cliff broke up into\
  \ long fingers of rock at the bottom, and he hung from the crotch of the two tallest.\
  \ Jendara shook her head. \"Damn, that's ugly. Let's do this fast before he loses\
  \ an arm.\"</p> \n   <p>Somewhere in the darkness, the wail sounded again. Jendara\
  \ felt gooseflesh prickle as she passed her length of rope to Vorrin.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Make a good knot when you join those.\"</p> \n   <p>He brushed his fingers down\
  \ her cheek. \"The best.\"</p> \n   <p>She didn't watch him tie the two ropes together\
  \ or wrap the rope around the rock, just moved her lantern out of the way and rubbed\
  \ dirt into the palms of her hands. She didn't need any sweat to make climbing harder.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Vorrin wrapped the rope around her waist and tied it tight. She clambered\
  \ over the cliff edge, and after only a moment's climbing could hear Tam's pained\
  \ breathing below her. He was too much the islander to groan or whimper—the raw\
  \ rasp of his inhalations was as bad as a scream. But there was no way to climb\
  \ faster. No light, no ladder, just her fingers and toes searching out purchase\
  \ on the cracked rocks.</p> \n   <p>Suddenly Jendara's palms went sweat-slick. Her\
  \ fingers slipped off the narrow handhold, and for a sickening second she swung\
  \ from the end of the rope, her face scraping the cavern wall. </p> \n   <p>\"Jendara!\"\
  \ Vorrin yelled.</p> \n   <p>Then her foot found a hold, a rock spur of some kind.\
  \ \"I'm okay!\"</p> \n   <p>And wished she'd been quiet as a frenzied barking sounded\
  \ out in the darkness.</p> \n   <p>\"Gods,\" Tam groaned. Jendara could see what\
  \ he saw, a brightening in the distance like flickering torchlight. She thought\
  \ of the goblin dog scat on the boat and climbed faster.</p> \n   <p>The bottom\
  \ of the cliff came as a surprise. Now that she was down, Vorrin's hands were free\
  \ to hoist the lantern, lighting up Tam and the rocky ground. </p> \n   <p>The goblin\
  \ dog's snarl echoed off the walls of the great cavern. Jendara loosened the rope\
  \ from her waist and stretched on tiptoe to work it around Tam's. His breathing\
  \ was just tiny gasps now. Every ounce of his body hung from the pinned arm.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Jendara locked her arms around his thighs, grunting as she lifted him\
  \ up out of the vise. A horrible squeak choked in his throat, and the big man went\
  \ limp. \"Damn it,\" she whispered. She could only hope he'd regain consciousness\
  \ soon. She couldn't get him back up that cliff on her own.</p> \n   <p>Pressing\
  \ herself against the rock that had gripped him, she pushed off again, getting a\
  \ little higher. Tam coughed and wriggled. Suddenly all his weight was on Jendara\
  \ and she staggered. </p> \n   <p>\"Vorrin, he's free!\"</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  \  <p>The light disappeared, and after a second some of the weight came off Jendara.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Behind the rocks, the goblin dog shrieked. Jendara stiffened as she heard\
  \ a sound she knew only too well, the dry scrape of air moving in a throat that\
  \ had never spoken. Kran's strange laugh.</p> \n   <p>\"Kran!\"</p> \n   <p>She\
  \ pushed Tam back against the cliff face, propping him against the wall. She could\
  \ smell the blood seeping from his scraped and mangled shoulder. \"Be right back,\
  \ friend.\"</p> \n   <p>Then she was off. She wished for her own lantern, but guttering\
  \ torchlight guided her forward, as did a cacophony of sounds: the hollow wailing,\
  \ a clatter of stones, the hideous sounds of goblin speech.</p> \n   <p>A goblin\
  \ dog lay twitching on the cave floor, the end of a very familiar pocketknife jutting\
  \ out of its eye socket. Its rider had rolled free, and swung a torch around its\
  \ swollen gray head to block the volley of rocks Kran lobbed at its face. One goblin,\
  \ alone. Jendara grinned to herself and felt for her belt axe. She could handle\
  \ one goblin scout and a dead dog.</p> \n   <p>The belt axe soared through the air.\
  \ The wet thud of it sinking into the goblin's skull was like music.</p> \n   <p>Kran\
  \ dropped his rocks and ran to the dead dog. He jerked his knife free and began\
  \ to cut at the black pack on the dog's back, which wailed and wriggled. Jendara\
  \ reclaimed her axe and jogged to his side. </p> \n   <p>It was no pack, she realized.\
  \ The glossy black hide belonged to a bear cub, a cut seeping blood along its side.\
  \ She held its paws as Kran struggled to cut the last of its ties. The white blaze\
  \ on its nose triggered prickles on the back of her neck.</p> \n   <p>A grizzly\
  \ rampaging last night. An island under attack this afternoon.</p> \n   <p>A goblin\
  \ scout here right now.</p> \n   <p>\"We've got to get out of here.\" She tucked\
  \ the bear cub under her arm and grabbed Kran by the hand, racing for Tam and the\
  \ only way she knew out of the cave.</p> \n   <p>\"Vorrin! Hurry up!\" she bellowed.\
  \ She didn't wait for him to begin pulling. She slapped Kran on the butt and urged\
  \ him up the cliff, scurrying behind him. One-handed, weighed down by the bear,\
  \ she still made it up before Vorrin finished hauling Tam.</p> \n   <p>They worked\
  \ together to half-drag Tam out of the tunnel and down to the beach. By the time\
  \ they hit the sand, they could see the goblin torches flickering at the mouth of\
  \ the cave, brighter than the faint orange of sunset over the sea.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  How did you know there were more?\" Vorrin asked.</p> \n   <p>\"The bear,\" Jendara\
  \ grunted, shifting Tam's weight against herself. \"The goblins must have scared\
  \ it last night when they took to the caves. The attack on Black Bay Island was\
  \ a distraction.\"</p> \n   <p>Oric jerked awake from his post on a washed-up log.\
  \ \"Wha—\"</p> \n   <p>But Jendara cut him off. \"Run back to your village. If there's\
  \ trouble, let us know.\"</p> \n   <p>His eyes were huge as he nodded and dashed\
  \ away.</p> \n   <p>Jendara could already smell smoke. Her stomach sank as they\
  \ rounded the headland. Flames stained the sky. Oric stood frozen, staring at his\
  \ burning village.</p> \n   <p>Behind them, goblin riders whooped and cheered.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Jendara passed her son the injured bear cub. \"Kran, run to the Milady\
  \ and arm yourself. Help the crew protect the docks. And take Oric!\" </p> \n  \
  \ <p>The boy looked pale, but did as he was told. Jendara smiled up at Tam. \"I\
  \ sure hope you can fight left-handed.\" </p> \n   <p>He gave a weak laugh and took\
  \ up a fighting stance. Jendara felt heat course through her veins, the ice that\
  \ gripped her all day melting away. She rubbed the tattoos on the backs of her hands\
  \ and chuckled to herself.</p> \n   <p>\"Little bastards don't know what they're\
  \ in for.\"</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n\
  \   <p>Jendara stood beside the mound of goblin dead and waited for Vorrin to pass\
  \ her the torch. Her arms ached with exhaustion, but she felt proud: proud of herself\
  \ and the people she'd helped defend. A group of women stood close by, and at least\
  \ one smiled at her. She'd forgotten that, whatever other duties the women of the\
  \ islands might have, they could still fight. They weren't so different, she and\
  \ them.</p> \n   <p>A great roar came up from the docks as the villagers cheered\
  \ for their returning kin. But many minutes passed before Jendara made out the shapes\
  \ of the returning war party, and even in the moonlight, she could see a grimness\
  \ in their approach. The man in front led a shorter figure on a rope.</p> \n   <p>Oric\
  \ jumped up from his seat beside Kran. \"Father! You're home!\" He dashed toward\
  \ the men but stopped as the torchlight revealed the scowl on his father's face.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"What happened?\" Morul growled. \"Smoke fills the sky above the island.\
  \ We found this filth looting the tavern on Black Bay. And all the village gathers\
  \ here to make a bonfire?\"</p> \n   <p>Vorrin handed the torch to Jendara, and\
  \ she held it a moment above the goblins. \"Not just any bonfire. While you fought\
  \ the fires on Black Bay Island, the main goblin troop prepared to attack your village\
  \ under the cover of darkness. They would have succeeded, too, if not for our sons\
  \ and their furry friend here.\"</p> \n   <p>Kran hugged the bear cub, who made\
  \ a sleepy grumble.</p> \n   <p>\"Bears? Boys? I don't understand.\" </p> \n   <p>The\
  \ wise woman stepped forward. \"Know that we only lost one building—the meeting\
  \ house—and have only two wounded. Jendara and her people helped greatly.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Morul tugged the rope lead hard enough to send the small, dirty man at\
  \ its end sprawling. \"And what of this trash?\" Gorg groaned from the sand, but\
  \ didn't move.</p> \n   <p>Jendara smiled. \"I have an idea.\" She beckoned to Morul\
  \ and, when he joined her beside the bonfire, murmured quietly for a moment.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He looked from the cowering Gorg to the villagers to the pile of dead\
  \ goblins. And then to Jendara. \"You truly are Erik Eriksson's daughter, aren't\
  \ you?\"</p> \n   <p>She laughed and lit the bonfire.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n\
  \    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>Vorrin watched Jendara finish tucking\
  \ the blankets around a sleeping Kran and a snoring baby bear. He waited for her\
  \ to close the cabin door behind her and join him on the deck. The night was clear\
  \ and the stars brilliant.</p> \n   <p>Jendara could tell he wanted to say something—\
  something meaningful and true about the day, about helping the village women fight\
  \ off the goblins, about finding Kran, about everything they had done. But he knew\
  \ better. Instead, he settled for standing with her and grinning as they watched\
  \ a small boat row out of the harbor. \"Nice of Gorg to chip in like that. Glad\
  \ he didn't have any hard feelings after that beating we gave him.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  You'd think he'd need his ship, but it was thoughtful of him to leave it to the\
  \ village for rebuilding materials.\" Jendara laughed, then sobered. </p> \n   <p>She\
  \ reached out to the grizzly fur, still sitting on the deck. \"You know, it's funny\
  \ how this bear saved so many people. If the goblins hadn't driven her out of the\
  \ caves, she would never have lost her baby or attacked Yul's sheep. Kran wouldn't\
  \ have followed his ears down into that cavern. Right now, we'd be sailing for the\
  \ mainland, and a lot of people would be dead.\"</p> \n   <p>\"That's some bear.\"\
  \ Vorrin studied the moon a moment. \"Are you disappointed that we missed the tide?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>She shook her head. \"No. Not one bit. It felt nice tonight. Like being\
  \ part of someplace. Like having a home.\"</p> \n   <p>He reached for his pipe and\
  \ lit it, puffing until the coals glowed red. \"You know, when we get done selling\
  \ this load, maybe we should come back here. It'd make for a nice summer harbor.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Jendara looked sideways at him. \"You saying we should tie up for summer?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>He puffed the pipe again. \"There should be a place we can take the\
  \ ship for repairs and supplies. A place to let Kran get his land legs. What do\
  \ you think?\"</p> \n   <p>She nodded, and felt herself begin to smile. Behind his\
  \ pipe, Vorrin was doing the same.</p> \n   <p>Neither of them had used the word\
  \ \"home.\" But for two retired pirates, it was a pretty good first step.</p> \n\
