  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, March 22, 2013</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">This week I'm in Las Vegas for the GAMA\
  \ Trade Show, an annual meeting of game manufacturers and retailers wherein game\
  \ publishers show off their new stuff, hatch massive conspiracies with one another,\
  \ and work with retailers to be better partners in getting our cool game products\
  \ into the hands of consumers. This year's show has been a wonderful experience,\
  \ and over the last few days I've spoken with hundreds of retailers with questions,\
  \ comments, and criticisms about Paizo's products. That's meant a lot of chatting\
  \ about the Pathfinder Battles miniatures, and I'm pleased to report that the word\
  \ from folks here is that customers are really loving our figures. The trade show\
  \ has been an educational experience, and it's convinced me that the next few years\
  \ are going to be even more exciting for Pathfinder fans than the last few!</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>And while I've been away from the office, the Pathfinder Battles forces\
  \ have been marshaling some amazing new figures from the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set, scheduled for a summer 2013 release!</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ week I'd like to show off three of these neat new minis, the insidious (and probably\
  \ a little leaky) grindylows!</p> \n    <p>Grindylows play an important role in\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, as they make great aquatic adversaries for low-level characters.\
  \ Without the risk of spoilers, I think it's fair to say that your players will\
  \ be seeing a lot of these guys over the course of the campaign.</p> \n    <p>With\
  \ heads and upper bodies that resemble those of goblins and bottom halves more reminiscent\
  \ of a greasy octopus, grindylows aren't <i>actually</i> goblins, but their teeth\
  \ and crazy culture make them just as lovable.</p> \n    <p>But don't take my word\
  \ for it. Have a look for yourself!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130322-Grindylow.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130322-Grindylow_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>This little critter is the Grindylow, a rank-and-file warrior\
  \ of his undersea race. Armed with a coral-studded poker and ready to bite your\
  \ hand off, the Grindylow is a Small figure. Because you'll want a good number of\
  \ this guy, we've slated him at the common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130322-BrinebroodQueen.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130322-BrinebroodQueen_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the evil Brinebrood Queen,\
  \ an appalling grindylow matriarch. You'd better hope she's not pointing at you,\
  \ because wherever she commands, a swarm of grindylows is likely soon to be!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This figure has a great sculpt and looks amazing in hand (especially\
  \ the tentacles along her bottom half). She is a Small creature at the rare rarity.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130322-TheWhale.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130322-TheWhale_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And here we have The Whale, a genetic throwback to\
  \ a primeval era in which grindylows could grow to any size. Grindylows like The\
  \ Whale never quite stop growing, and can eventually reach size Huge. This charming\
  \ gentleman is \"merely\" Large, and makes a great centerpiece to any grindylow-themed\
  \ encounter. The Whale is a rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week.\
  \ Stay tuned to this space next week for more piratical and aquatic beasties from\
  \ the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of Pathfinder\
  \ Battles prepainted figures!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n\
