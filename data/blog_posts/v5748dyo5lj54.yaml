  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Happy Monday! As I contemplated this week's\
  \ blog and what to write, my head jumbled with thoughts, I realized a year passed\
  \ since I started a Paizo. The realization prompted me into analysis of Pathfinder\
  \ Society. The end conclusion what that, while some of the initiatives didn't quite\
  \ work as intended, the overall health of the program remained well. PFS membership\
  \ grew, convention support reached an all time high, we released many backlog items\
  \ such as <em>Advance Player's Guide</em> pregenerated characters, sanctioned much\
  \ of the available Pathfinder content for use in Pathfinder Society, produced one\
  \ and a half seasons of the Adventure Card Guild, created new Seeker content, and\
  \ released convention content with enough time for GM preparation.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ items that didn't work the first time out, such as the Regional Support Package\
  \ (Game Day support), are back on the drawing board for version 2.0. The team also\
  \ started a revision of <em>Roleplaying Guild Guide</em> with the intent to clean\
  \ up ambiguous wording and address questions raised on the forums. At this time,\
  \ the exact release date is unknown, but the goal is as quickly as possible given\
  \ our production schedule.</p> \n     <p>Hats off to John, Linda, Mark, for being\
  \ an awesome while working with me to make a memorable year of Pathfinder for you,\
  \ our players. Thanks also to the Paizo staffers in other departments that support\
  \ Pathfinder Society. Without all of us pulling together, we could not make PFS\
  \ happen.</p> \n     <p>While the staffers supported Pathfinder Society from inside\
  \ Paizo, the network of Venture-Officers provided support to all the local games.\
  \ We currently have over <b><i>760</i></b> Venture-Officers in 49 of the United\
  \ States and 35 countries spread over 6 continents. This number grows every week,\
  \ as more people join the Pathfinder Society family. Unfortunately, there is not\
  \ enough room to list them all here, but check out the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/coordinators\"\
  >Coordinator List</a> for an up to date roster of our Venture-Officers. Huge thanks\
  \ to all of them for making a global Pathfinder Society!</p> \n     <p>There is\
  \ another pool of volunteers integral to the Pathfinder Society. Without the throngs\
  \ of GMs, no games could run. While GMs spend large amounts of time preparing and\
  \ running games, some dedicate hundreds of hours to the hobby. In recognition of\
  \ the large amount of time spent providing games to others, we recognize GMs with\
  \ stars. They earn the first star after running 10 games, which equates to approximately\
  \ 50 hours of game time and another 10-20 preparing for the games. From there, we\
  \ award two stars for 30 games, three stars for 60 games, and four stars for 100\
  \ games. Some GMs dedicate over 600 hours to running games, run at least 50 different\
  \ games from the various PFS seasons, and run a game for a Venture-Captain, who\
  \ verifies the GMs knowledge of the Pathfinder Society and the Pathfinder RPG system.\
  \ To these GMs, the most dedicated of our bunch, we award <b>five stars</b>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The following GMs achieved their fifth star over the past few months.\
  \ Please join me in congratulating:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Nils Janson</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Morten Fredricksen</li> \n      <li>Atte Kiljunen</li> \n      <li>Joe\
  \ Kirner</li> \n      <li>Ryan Bolduan</li> \n      <li>Colin Webster</li> \n  \
  \    <li>Mark Cohen</li> \n      <li>Þórarinn Sigurðsson</li> \n      <li>Rigby\

  \     <li>Hillis \"Al\" Mallory III</li> \n      <li>Sebastian Mullins</li>\n  \
  \   </ul> \n     <p>Last year involved great change and upheaval. Currently, it\
  \ is planning time. We are reviewing data, looking for trends, and setting out our\
  \ ideas. Going forward, I'm focused on refining programs, tweaking operations, and\
  \ streamlining processes. Oh, and working on the upcoming Season of the Adventure\
  \ Card Guild. But more on that later, as I don't want to give any spoilers! At least,\
  \ not yet. Perhaps next week!</p> \n     <p>Until then—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>\
