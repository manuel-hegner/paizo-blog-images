  \     <p><em>The Sky Citadels marked the height of dwarven architecture and engineering.\
  \ Built at the end of the centuries-long Quest for Sky, these massive fortresses\
  \ provided far more than just safety, encompassing entire cities and fostering dwarven\
  \ ingenuity. They were also symbols of determination and hope for dwarves, a monument\
  \ to the accomplishment of an entire people who persevered through immense difficulty\
  \ and doubt—though they also created some of their own problems, as they drove orcs\
  \ before them and unknowingly released Darklands horrors behind them. Though the\
  \ fortunes of the dwarves have proven less reliable, these bastions yet stand, and\
  \ several continue to thrive. </em></p> \n     <p><em>While Highhelm wasn’t the\
  \ first Sky Citadel, it has proven itself arguably the most important and certainly\
  \ the most influential. The undisputed center of dwarven culture today, Highhelm\
  \ has a depth, complexity, and richness in its fabled halls that place it among\
  \ Golarion’s finest cities. Dwarves of all kinds, be they holtaksen, ergasken, or\
  \ grondasken, call the Sky Citadel their home, and the city even houses large populations\
  \ of other ancestries. This mixing of ancestral cultures and traditions, combined\
  \ with influence from Highhelm’s neighbors, makes the city unique among the active\
  \ Sky Citadels. It’s simultaneously a city that’s undeniably dwarven in its nature,\
  \ but also one that draws from non-dwarven traditions to create a culture unlike\
  \ anywhere else. </em></p> \n     <p><em>This volume presents an in-depth look at\
  \ this remarkable and unique metropolis. The first chapter offers a general overview\
  \ of Highhelm with detailed sections on its history, culture, and people, including\
  \ government, trade, customs, and notable figures. To truly understand dwarves,\
  \ one must understand their clan system, here explained in exquisite detail. A gazetteer\
  \ of the city and its surroundings comprises the second chapter, offering specifics\
  \ on Highhelm’s three major sections. For each section, the gazetteer presents neighborhoods,\
  \ locations, notable people, current events, and player options. The third chapter\
  \ provides even more player options, including ancestry feats and legendary gear,\
  \ as well as new monsters and the stalwart defender, an archetype representing the\
  \ defensive techniques of the warriors of Highhelm. This book also details the deities\
  \ of the entire dwarven pantheon for the first time. </em></p> \n     <div class=\"\
