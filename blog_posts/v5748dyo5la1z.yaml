  \ in Space!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 19, 2008</p> \n    <p>Okay,\
  \ I lied. Robert E. Howard's <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8b\">Almuric</a></i>,\
  \ the latest release from <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet Stories</a>, isn't actually\
  \ a Conan novel. But it sure <i>feels</i> like one. </p>\n    <p>No, as a piece\
  \ of literary history, <i><a href=\" /store/v5748btpy7x8b\">Almuric</a></i> is actually\
  \ far more fascinating. Best-known as the creator of Conan the Barbarian, Robert\
  \ E. Howard was one of the most distinctive and well-regarded voices of the pulp\
  \ era. His brutal, might-make-right take on fantasy inspired generations of books,\
  \ films, and games, almost single-handedly popularizing the sword and sorcery genre\
  \ in the 1920s and 30s. His friendship with H. P. Lovecraft led to contributions\
  \ to the vast and intricate Cthulhu mythos. His work has been called \"so highly\
  \ charged with energy that it nearly gives off sparks\" by none other than Stephen\
  \ King himself. Even his personal life has become legend, having been turned into\
  \ the award-winning movie \"The Whole Wide World.\" And who knows how much more\
  \ he might have accomplished had he not infamously taken his own life at the age\
  \ of 30. </p>\n    <p>Yet for all of his extensive achievements and hundreds of\
  \ stories, Howard wrote very few actual novels, of which <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8b\"\
  >Almuric</a></i> is by far the largest and best-known. Within its pages, a Conan-esque\
  \ brute named Esau Cairn, dissatisfied with life on earth and running from the law,\
  \ finds himself transported to another world, where his natural strength and savagery\
  \ make him a powerful captain of men. On this planet of beautiful maidens and their\
  \ Neanderthal-like warrior consorts, strange beasts and black-winged men, Esau carves\
  \ out a place for himself with bared steel, and in so doing rescues a valiant civilization\
  \ from the oppression of sadistic masters. In shortâ€”classic Howard. </p>\n    <p>Or\
  \ is it? Therein lies the mystery that's one of the most fascinating things about\
  \ <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8b\">Almuric</a></i>. </p>\n    <p>You see, <i><a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8b\">Almuric</a></i> was first published three years\
  \ after Howard's death in 1936, supposedly from a complete manuscript discovered\
  \ among his personal documents. Yet while most of the manuscript has been universally\
  \ accepted to be original Howard material, the last few chapters have long been\
  \ a source of controversy. Did Howard, indeed, finish the last section? Or was the\
  \ story instead, as some personal letters from Howard's father hint, finished by\
  \ another author as part of a shrewd financial move? For those historians who believe\
  \ the latter theory, the chief suspect responsible for wrapping up <i><a href=\"\
  \ /store/v5748btpy7x8b\">Almuric</a></i> is none other than <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80hr\"\
  >Otis Adelbert Kline</a>, Howard's literary agent and himself a prominent <i>Weird\
  \ Tales</i> author (who, incidentally, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80hr\">will be\
  \ seeing print in Planet Stories this September</a>). In addition to veiled references\
  \ to shady arrangements, theorists who believe Howard never lived to see a complete\
  \ <i><a href=\" /store/v5748btpy7x8b\">Almuric</a></i> draft point to the novel's\
  \ ending as uncharacteristic of Howard's style, whereas others accuse such conspiracy\
  \ theorists of jumping at shadows. The debate rages on to this day. </p>\n    <p>So\
  \ pick up a copy, breeze through its action-packed story, and see which camp you\
  \ fall into. And once you've made up your mind, post on our messageboards and let\
  \ us know where your suspicions lie! </p>\n    <p>And now, a sample: </p>\n    <blockquote>\
  \ <i><p> Of all the forms of life I had encountered on that strange planet, none\
  \ filled me with as much loathing as these dwarfish monstrosities. I backed away\
  \ from the mangled heap on the earth, as a nauseous flood poured through the rift\
  \ in the wall.</p> <p>The effect of those vermin emerging from that broken wall\
  \ was almost intolerably sickening; the suggestion was that of maggots squirming\
  \ out of a cracked and bleached skull.</p> <p>Turning, I caught Altha up in one\
  \ arm and raced across the open space. They followed fleetingly, running now on\
  \ all fours, and now upright like a man. And suddenly they broke out into their\
  \ hellish laughter again, and I saw we were trapped. Ahead of me were more emerging\
  \ from some other subterranean entrance. We were cut off.</p> <p>A giant pedestal,\
  \ from which the column had been broken, stood before us. With a bound I reached\
  \ it, set the girl on the jagged pinnacle, and wheeled on the lower base to take\
  \ such toll of our pursuers as I might. Blood streaming from a score of gashes trickled\
  \ down the pedestal on which I stood, and I shook my head violently to rid my eyes\
  \ of blinding sweat.</p> </i>\n     <p><i>They ringed me in a wide semicircle, deliberate\
  \ now that their prey seemed certain, and I cannot recall a time when I was more\
  \ revolted by horror and disgust, than when I stood with my back to that marble\
  \ pillar and faced those verminous monsters of the lower world.</i></p> \n    </blockquote>\
