  \ itemprop=\"description\">I've been in the office only 5 days since returning from\
  \ my ToyFair trip, but that time has gone by like a flash. When I think back to\
  \ my time at ToyFair, it seems like only yesterday that I was checking out the latest\
  \ action figures, playsets, statues, and other cool stuff on display. And I'm especially\
  \ pleased that this year, we had a nice display of Pathfinder items to show off\
  \ at the show, as well.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lh60\">Last\
  \ Friday</a>, I showed off a few of my personal camera-phone photos of upcoming\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> figures from our friends\
  \ and partners at WizKids. WizKids had plenty of Pathfinder on display, from the\
  \ first three <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\">Iconic Heroes</a> sets\
  \ to about a third of June's <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>\
  \ set.</p> \n    <p>Here are a few more shots from their booth. These are production-run\
  \ versions of these figures, so expect the finals to look pretty much exactly like\
  \ this.</p> \n    <p>Let's start by focusing on a few shots of figures from the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\">Iconic Heroes</a> boxed sets.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-Harsk.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-Harsk_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is Harsk, Dwarf Ranger from <a href=\"/products/btpy98sx\"\
  >Iconic Heroes Set #2</a>. Check out his eye for a good sense of the level of detail\
  \ WizKids is going to to make sure these sets are of the finest quality possible.\
  \ It took all of my willpower not to simply walk away with this figure.</p> \n \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-KyraFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-KyraFront_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-KyraBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The phone I was using focused a bit strangely in these\
  \ photos, but I wanted to include them anyway for historical reasons. Our very first\
  \ WizKids release, <a href=\"/products/btpy8l52\"><em>Beginner Box Heroes</em></a>\
  \ featured a Kyra figure that blew away the expectations of collectors (and the\
  \ Paizo staff) with the quality of design work, in particular on Kyra's very detailed\
  \ cloak. Here's the new version, and I think the detail here is even more impressive.\
  \ Kyra, Human Cleric also appears in <a href=\"/products/btpy98sx\"><em>Iconic Heroes\
  \ Set #2</em></a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-Amiri.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-Amiri_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next up is Amiri, Human Barbarian. WizKids did an amazing\
  \ job on all of the little details on this figure, and she looks fantastic. I'm\
  \ also quite partial to Amiri because, while I was at ToyFair, the first issue of\
  \ the new <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsOrigins\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Origins</em></a> comic series released in comic shops, and Amiri\
  \ is the special guest star. I wrote <a href=\"/products/btpy9ap0\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Origins #1</em></a>, and hope you guys have had a chance to check it out. Our\
  \ favorite barbarian more than accounts for herself, that's for sure! Amiri is also\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy98sx\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set #2</em></a>.</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-Ezren.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have another denizen of <a href=\"/products/btpy98sx\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes Set #2</em></a>, Ezren, Human Wizard. Great, great detail work\
  \ on this figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-Damiel.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-Damiel_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Let's move on to <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\"><em>Iconic\
  \ Heroes Set #3</em></a>, with a look at Damiel, Elf Alchemist. I confess this is\
  \ not the sharpest photo in the world, but it gives a good sense of the level of\
  \ amazing detail WizKids is putting into these figures. I can't wait to add Damiel\
  \ to my personal collection.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next up is Balazar, Gnome Summoner. For such a cute little\
  \ guy, his miniature packs a ton of awesome details. Balazar is included in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy99z3\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set #3</em></a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-PadrigFront.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Balazar the summoner is lost without his eidolon, Padrig.\
  \ Here he is from front to back. Padrig comes in <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes Set #3</em></a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Let's move on to <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons\
  \ Deep</em></a>, which is rapidly shaping up to be one of my favorite sets in the\
  \ line, with tons of high-utility figures. One of my favorites is the Giant Crawling\
  \ Hand, a Medium undead monstrosity just waiting to slide some (rotting) skin with\
  \ your player characters. I'm thrilled that the Hand is a common figure, as I can't\
  \ wait to give my player characters a \"round of applause\" for their tireless heroism.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-Griffon.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Every GM needs a great Griffon figure, and this set gave\
  \ me the perfect opportunity to slip one into <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a>. The Griffon is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-VeiledMaster.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150227-VeiledMaster_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week is the Veiled Master, a variant aboleth\
  \ that first appeared in my Paizo-staff \"Kings of Absalom\" in-office campaign,\
  \ where they were revealed to have been heavily involved in the last days and ultimate\
  \ fall of the ancient Empire of Azlant. They subsequently appeared in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8v2x\"><em>Inner Sea Bestiary</em></a>, and you can expect to see\
  \ them again in the not too distant future. The Veiled Master looks fantastic in\
  \ plastic. It's a Large, rare figure with tons of cool details.</p> \n    <p>And\
  \ that's it for this week, and for my storehouse of ToyFair images. Check back in\
  \ this space next week for more cool reveals for upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> releases!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
