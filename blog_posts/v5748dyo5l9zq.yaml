  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, June 11, 2008</p> \n   <p>We're finishing up\
  \ a whole bunch of great products this week, all of which will be available at Gen\
  \ Con in a couple months. As most of you are probably keenly aware, we launch a\
  \ whole new Adventure Path in August with the first 96-page chapter of Second Darkness.\
  \ In addition, we provide the most comprehensive look at Golarion and the Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles Campaign Setting with our expansive 256-page campaign setting hardcover.\
  \ Not to be outdone, of course, is the Pathfinder RPG Beta release, a 400-page behemoth\
  \ chock full of awesome. </p> \n   <p>Don't overlook, though, Paizo's release of\
  \ the first of its new line of products that provide useful flavor and new rules\
  \ for GMs <i>and</i> players alike: the 32-page Pathfinder Companion. Each Pathfinder\
  \ Companion will cover some topic related to the campaign setting in great detail,\
  \ presenting both flavorful information and new character options. </p> \n   <p>This\
  \ first Pathfinder Companion fills the role of the Second Darkness player's guide,\
  \ but goes so much further. In August's Companion, we introduce a structured and\
  \ expansive traits section. We first introduced traits in the Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne player's guide, but with this player's guide we set out more defined rules\
  \ and a much greater variety of available traits. In each subsequent Pathfinder\
  \ Companion, we'll introduce some more traits to give you an even greater selection\
  \ to choose from.</p> \n   <p>In fact, to give you a little glimpse at what we've\
  \ got coming your way, here's a short excerpt and a bit of art for you.</p> \n \
  \  <blockquote> \n    <h2>Character Trait Design Philosophy</h2> \n    <p>At its\
  \ core, a Character Trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat—in fact,\
  \ at one point, we considered calling them \"Half Feats\" but abandoned that idea\
  \ when we realized it implied a point-based system that didn't really exist (there's\
  \ no such thing, for example, as a \"Double Feat\"). Yet a Character Trait isn't\
  \ just another kind of power you can add on to your character—it's a way to quantify\
  \ (and encourage) building a character background that fits into the world of Golarion.\
  \ Think of Character Traits as \"story seeds\" for your background—after you pick\
  \ your two traits, you'll have a point of inspiration to build your character's\
  \ personality and history from. Alternately, if you've already got a background\
  \ in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his Traits\
  \ as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability\
  \ scores quantifies his strengths and weaknesses.</p> \n    <p>One more thing—Character\
  \ Traits are for PCs. If you want an NPC to have traits, that NPC will need to \"\
  buy\" them with the Additional Traits feat. Player characters are special—they're\
  \ the stars of the game, after all, and if they have an advantage over the NPCs\
  \ of the world in this way, that kind of makes sense. The pregenerated characters\
  \ presented in Pathfinder and the modules will not have bonus Traits selected for\
  \ them—we're leaving those choices to you if you wish to use one of them as a PC.</p>\
