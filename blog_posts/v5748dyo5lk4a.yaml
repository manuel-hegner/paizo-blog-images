  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Back in July we introduced a new character\
  \ to the Pathfinder Society campaign. More accurately, we asked for your help in\
  \ the form of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz1?Leaders-in-Liberty\">a contest\
  \ to write the character's backstory</a> in 250-300 words. After Tonya copied the\
  \ entries into a form we could review without seeing any author names, the team\
  \ set to reading through the 53 narratives and picking out our favorites.</p> \n\
  \    <p>We've included our top four picks below, and it's now the community's turn\
  \ to decide. Vote for your favorite by <b>September 29 at 5:00 PM Pacific time</b>\
  \ and we'll announce the winner soon afterward in a later blog. Remember that those\
  \ who participate in the contest—including in the voting process—contribute to the\
  \ Liberty's Edge faction's goals for the recent Season 9 <a href=\"/products/btpy9dgw?Pathfinder-Society-Faction-Journal-Cards\"\
  >Faction Journal Cards</a> update.</p> \n    <p>When we launched this contest, we\
  \ were still several weeks away from the release of <a href=\"/products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</em></a>. That\
  \ adventure has a significant Liberty's Edge faction connection, and I encourage\
  \ everyone to play it. It also provides a little more context for this contest—\
  not necessary to vote on your favorite background, but potentially helpful. I've\
  \ included that information in a spoiler below, so investigate at your own peril.</p>\

  \ \n     <h3>Daarit Kwelu</h3> \n     <p>Daarit Kwelu was born in the abolitionist\
  \ city-state of Senghor. Her father, Tadesse, was a scrupulous investor in the long\
  \ haul sea trade who used his fortune to ensure that his two daughters would be\
  \ free to pursue their own paths in life. While her younger sister, Rensaret, decided\
  \ to put her talents into the Senghorian navy, Daarit chose to go to the Magaambya\
  \ and put her mind to work.</p> \n     <p>Her education in Nantambu focused on the\
  \ modern and ancient languages of the Inner Sea, and she quickly began serving as\
  \ a junior translator for visiting scholars. Daarit proved her lexical mastery when\
  \ she assisted Neiford Sharrowsmith in deciphering a recovered codex from a fallen\
  \ Shory sky city. Her ability to interpret subtle nuances in the Shory language\
  \ helped render ancient metaphors into functional formulae, unlocking new and deeper\
  \ understandings of the lost aeromantic arts.</p> \n     <p>That Shory text awakened\
  \ in her a sense of awe and pride in the history of the Expanse and its people.\
  \ Fueled by these stories of ancestors who conquered earth and sky, she became even\
  \ more attuned to the liberator's cause; seeing in each Mwangi slave a sky master\
  \ chained to the ground.</p> \n     <p>Upon completing her studies, Daarit returned\
  \ home with a dream of restoring the ancient power and glory of the Expanse. Her\
  \ vision of a great nation for a free and united Mwangi people was well received\
  \ by council elder Helise Solu who saw in her a voice for his own expansionist politics.\
  \ Daarit now serves as a translator and diplomat for Senghor, brokering alliances\
  \ between the Mwangi free cities, advocating for the abolition of slavery throughout\
  \ Garund, and hoping, one day, to see her people return to the sky.</p> \n     <h3>Folami\
  \ Kanye</h3> \n     <p>Folami Kanye was born on the waves to a family of Ombo pirates\
  \ and slavers, and from birth she was trained to be a savvy negotiator and capable\
  \ fighter. However, her relatives' actions never sat well with her, especially in\
  \ Sargava. She felt as though the Ijo they frequently abducted were her own people\
  \ and wished that the two groups could unite against their Chelish oppressors.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When Folami was 19, her family captured an elderly Ijo woman named Abena,\
  \ who reminded Folami of her deceased grandmother. After a storm destroyed their\
  \ provisions, Folami's sister Ife, the vessel's captain, ordered the deaths of Abena\
  \ and two other slaves to save resources. In a daring rescue, which even Folami\
  \ admitted worked only because Ife never suspected her sister's betrayal, Folami\
  \ fought off her sister's guards and hustled the slaves to a life boat. Unwilling\
  \ to harm her sister, Ife did not pursue, and an Ijo fishing vessel picked up Folami,\
  \ Abena, and the others.</p> \n     <p>Over the next few years, Folami set up a\
  \ small but thriving operation to rescue slaves from Ombo pirates like her family.\
  \ Her friend Abena manages Folami's headquarters, all the while chiding her to find\
  \ a more peaceful solution to Ijo problems. Folami realizes that her endeavors are\
  \ adding to the Bonuwat vs. Bonuwat fighting that she found counterproductive in\
  \ her youth, but at least now she fights for justice.</p> \n     <p>When the Pathfinder\
  \ Society won the Sargava Chalice in 4717 and even extracted concessions from the\
  \ Chelish nobles regarding the cup's ownership, Folami recognized that an alliance\
  \ with the organization might help her realize the goals of freedom on a larger\
  \ scale. After doing some research, she contacted Colson Maldris and offered her\
  \ team's services in exchange for a broadening of Liberty's Edge's endeavors in\
  \ Western Garund.</p> \n     <h3>Helakai Ironsi</h3> \n     <p>Helakai Ironsi is\
  \ a traveling manifestation of the ethics of her Caldaru heritage. Born and raised\
  \ in Senghor, as most Caldaru are, Helakai has grown into a dual role in life. She\
  \ travels openly as a merchant, yet in private she is a steadfast vessel of the\
  \ Bonuwat diety known as Shimye-Magalla.</p> \n     <p>Her travels take her from\
  \ Senghor to Bloodcove and then up the Vanji River to Nantambu and Lake Ocota. Not\
  \ specializing in any one product, she selects from the variety of goods that arrive\
  \ in Senghor to make up her cargo for the upriver journey. It is in the return trip\
  \ downriver that she serves Shimye-Magalla and her ancestors' spirits.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Helakai runs escaped slaves, hidden among her crew or concealed by her magic.\
  \ Outwardly her vessel is filled with trade goods from the interior, but this simply\
  \ defrays the cost of bringing those unfortunates to Senghor and the freedom of\
  \ that doorway to the open sea. Some will challenge her story, but she is resourceful\
  \ and has always won free.</p> \n     <p>She sees as her greatest danger the possibility\
  \ of a double-agent posing as an escaped slave. This would be serious trouble if\
  \ she was ratted out to the Aspis Consortium in Bloodcove. Fighting through the\
  \ Aspis base is not an option, subterfuge is the only tactic that works. Helakai\
  \ has become quite skilled at that.</p> \n     <p>Her current and recent trading\
  \ partners include Aya Allahe and Sharrowsmith's Exports, through which she has\
  \ become aware of the Pathfinder Society and their links in the wider world. Lately\
  \ that connection has become more active.</p> \n     <h3>Karisa Starsight</h3> \n\
  \     <p>The pirate slaver Kolm Redarax of the <i>Besmara's Lash</i> came upon an\
  \ adrift Bonuwat ship. Redarax found the crew entirely missing with no sign of violence.\
  \ Just as he set to leave the apparently cursed vessel, an infant's cry was heard.\
  \ Redarax found a swaddled Bonuwat girl-child. When the infant opened her eyes,\
  \ Redarax noticed their striking blue color that seemed radiant in the sun. Redarax\
  \ named her Karisa Starsight—his daughter.</p> \n     <p>Being the daughter of the\
  \ captain did not exempt Karisa from duty. She tended to the needs of the slaves\
  \ Redarax traded in various Garundi ports. She came to realize the slaves were people\
  \ with the same worth as any other. As she grew into a young adult, she was torn\
  \ between the plight of the slaves and her love for her father.</p> \n     <p>One\
  \ day the <i>Besmara's Lash</i> was attacked by a Gray Corsairs vessel, captained\
  \ by a friend of Major Colson Madris. The Corsairs were victorious. When the Andoren\
  \ captain was about to put Redarax to the sword, Karisa intervened. She pledged\
  \ her service to Andoran and freedom in exchange for Redarax's life. The captain\
  \ agreed, but reasoned that putting her into simple servitude would be an act little\
  \ better than those of Redarax. He decided to send her to be mentored by his friend\
  \ Madris in Absalom, while Redarax was taken to an Andoren prison.</p> \n     <p>Karisa\
  \ quickly excelled as an aide to Madris. Life at sea has given her a disciplined\
  \ work ethic, enhanced by interpersonal skills learned from many cultures. Madris\
  \ has made her his steward, having her assign Pathfinders and other agents to various\
  \ tasks in the cause of freedom. Karisa is proud of her role, but she can't forget\
  \ that her father—no matter how much she despises his morals—is himself bound in\
  \ chains.</p> \n     <h3>Orisa Ombo</h3> \n     <p>Traders know Orisa Ombo as the\
  \ powerful scion of the nine-feathers trading house. She travels throughout Garund\
  \ and Avistan, sternly trading the wares of her family: rare hardwoods, magical\
  \ items, seafood and most heartlessly, slaves. The cold-hearted Lady Ombo cuts hard\
  \ bargains and doesn't flinch from questionable tactics. She has brought profit\
  \ and renown to her house, but she is not the woman she used to be.</p> \n     <p>Several\
  \ years ago, Orisa collected a group of Bonuwat slaves to trade in Katapesh. Among\
  \ them was a Janni priest of Shimye-Magalla known as Ardrashir. Ancient tradition\
  \ among the Bonuwat forbid harming servants of this nature god, but Orisa sold him\
  \ to depraved cultists of Lamashtu for great profit. The night the priest was sacrificed,\
  \ Orisa tossed and turned in her fine bed, and she was visited by a vision of Shimye-Magalla.\
  \ The angry spirit fused the soul of Ardashir into Orisa Ombo and cursed her for\
  \ breaking the ancient laws of her people.</p> \n     <p>Ardashir struggled within\
  \ Orisa and forced her to face his suffering. Now, Orisa pretends to be same heartless\
  \ merchant queen, but by night, word has spread throughout the inner sea region\
  \ of an avenging angel, who seems to know all the secrets of the slavers he targets.\
  \ The Shadow Angel is Orisa's body possessed by Ardashir's soul. He strikes slaving\
  \ rings where they are most vulnerable and disappears into the night.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Lady Orisa works with Liberty's Edge, offering them information and secret\
  \ financial support. In return, she asks for Pathfinder strike teams to attack slavers\
  \ and those that protect them. She is a master of disguise who is careful to protect\
  \ her cover identity and can even be found posing as a slave, following the trade\
  \ routes to gather information.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"text-align:\
