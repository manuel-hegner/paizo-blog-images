  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, October 4, 2017</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"\
  articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With any new game system, and\
  \ associated organized play campaign, there are rules questions that even the designers\
  \ and developers could not predict. I was surprised to find out that batteries are\
  \ one of the more discussed issues in <a href=\"/starfindersociety\">Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. There have been several discussions, both on the\
  \ forums and among the venture-officers, about how to handle some of questions that\
  \ came up with regards to handling batteries in Starfinder.</p> \n     <p>So, let's\
  \ start with some new rulings!</p> \n     <h2>New Starfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild Rulings</h2> \n     <p><i>The following rulings are official for the Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild and go into effect immediately.</i></p> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li>Any equipment a PC owns that comes with a battery is automatically\
  \ recharged to its full number of charges between scenarios. The same applies to\
  \ any individually purchased batteries a PC owns. It is assumed that PCs have access\
  \ to free recharging stations within the Lorespire Complex or from their starship.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Starfinder Society starships, unless otherwise noted, can recharge\
  \ batteries. If a scenario involves a starship, and the PCs have access to the ship,\
  \ they can use the recharge station onboard at no cost.</li> \n      <li>The current\
  \ number of charges on a battery does not impact the sale price of an item. Any\
  \ items that are sold with a battery (such as energy weapons) must be resold with\
  \ the associated battery, regardless of the battery's current charge.</li> \n  \
  \    <li>Update the Pulsecaster Rifle (<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> 176) statistics\
  \ as follows: Capacity 20 charges, Usage 1.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p><b>Character\
  \ Updates:</b> If you previously purchased recharging services on your character\
  \ between scenarios, you can reclaim any credits spent on these services. If you\
  \ purchased a pulsecaster rifle for a character, prior to the publication of this\
  \ blog post, you must use the new statistics, as presented above, or immediately\
  \ exchange the weapon back at full credit value (instead of the standard 10% resale\
  \ cost).</p> \n     <h2>Moving Forward</h2> \n     <p>After reading various forum\
  \ comments, receiving private messages, attending conventions where I discussed\
  \ this matter with players, and hearing from our venture-officers, the Organized\
  \ Play team decided the above rulings worked best with our campaign. Tracking charges\
  \ on batteries (beyond just weapons) between scenarios was cumbersome on players,\
  \ and it just added another layer of complexity to GMing a scenario. There were\
  \ some rightful fears that PCs might spend more time using the <i>transfer charge</i>\
  \ cantrip to completely drain obtained equipment, to bypass having to purchase replacement\
  \ chargesâ€”let alone the final impact on how equipment sharing would work with that\
  \ cantrip.</p> \n     <p>As currently written in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, the pulsecaster rifle comes with a battery\
  \ that's more expensive than the actual weapon purchase. The update above is in\
  \ line with an upcoming FAQ/Errata from the Starfinder team that will address this\
  \ issue. This future FAQ update should also include some other rules clarifications\
  \ and updates, so keep an eye out for a future Starfinder FAQ</p> \n     <p>I suspect\
  \ that these rules should alleviate most concerns with regards to tracking battery\
  \ charges for a character. Players are still expected to track charges during a\
  \ scenario, but I suspect that most PCs relying on energy weapons will pick up a\
  \ secondary battery and have ample charges to get through even the most grueling\
  \ encounters.</p> \n     <p>Now, go forth, and pew pew pew with all the lasers!</p>\
