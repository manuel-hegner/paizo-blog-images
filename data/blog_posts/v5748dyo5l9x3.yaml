  \ Dark World Approaches...</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, October 21, 2008</p>\
  \ \n    <p> In my last <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet Stories</a> post, I talked\
  \ all about <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81tx\"><i>The Dark World</i></a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/search?q=henry+kuttner\">Henry Kuttner</a>'s story of two men trapped\
  \ in the same body and thrust into a world of mythology and corruption, and dropped\
  \ quotes by everyone from Ray Bradbury to Marion Zimmer Bradley to Roger Zelazny\
  \ about how much they adore the book and the ways in which its unique take on science\
  \ fantasy influenced their own writing.</p> \n    <p>Since I can't top their comments,\
  \ I'm not even going to try. Instead, here's an excerpt from <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81tx\"\
  ><i>The Dark World</i></a>, coming soon from Planet Stories:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>Gripped in my right hand I still held the sword. I cut at him savagely\
  \ by way of answer. He sprang back, glanced over his shoulder, and drew his weapon.\
  \ I followed his glance and saw another green figure dodging forward among the trees.\
  \ It was smaller and slenderer—a girl, in a tunic the color of earth and forest.\
  \ Her black hair swung upon her shoulders. She was tugging at her belt as she ran,\
  \ and the face she turned to me was ugly with hate, her teeth showing in a snarl.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The man before me was saying something.</p> \n     <p> \"Edward, listen\
  \ to me!\" he was crying. \"Even if you're Ganelon, you remember Edward Bond! He\
  \ was with us—he believed in us. Give us a hearing before it's too late! Arles could\
  \ convince you, Edward! Come to Arles. Even if you're Ganelon, let me take you to\
  \ Arles!\"</p> \n     <p> \"It's no use, Ertu,\" the voice of the girl cried thinly.\
  \ She was struggling with the last of the trees, whose flexible bough-tips still\
  \ clutched to stop her. Neither of them tried now to keep their voices down. They\
  \ were shouting, and I knew they must rouse the guards at any moment, and I wanted\
  \ to kill them both myself before anyone came to forestall me by accident. I was\
  \ hungry and thirsty for the blood of these enemies, and in that moment the name\
  \ of Edward Bond was not even memory.</p> \n     <p> \"Kill him, Ertu!\" cried the\
  \ girl. \"Kill him or stand out of the way! I know Ganelon!\"</p> \n     <p>I looked\
  \ at her and took a fresh grip on my sword. Yes, she spoke the truth. She knew Ganelon.\
  \ And Ganelon knew her, and remembered dimly that she had reason for her hate. I\
  \ had seen that face before, contorted with fury and despair. I could not recall\
  \ when or where or why, but she looked familiar.</p> \n     <p>The man Ertu drew\
  \ his weapon reluctantly. To him I was still at least the image of a friend. I laughed\
  \ exultantly and swung at him again with the sword, hearing it hiss viciously through\
  \ the air. This time I drew blood. He stepped back again, lifting his weapon so\
  \ that I looked down its black barrel.</p> \n     <p> \"Don't make me do it,\" he\
  \ said between his teeth. \"This will pass. You have been Edward Bond—you will be\
  \ again. Don't make me kill you, Ganelon!\"</p> \n     <p>I lifted the sword, seeing\
  \ him only dimly through a ruddy haze of anger. There was a great exultation in\
  \ me. I could already see the fountain of blood that would leap from his severed\
  \ arteries when my blade completed its swing.</p> \n     <p>I braced my body for\
  \ a great full-armed blow!</p> \n     <p>And the sword came alive in my hand. It\
  \ leaped and shuddered against my fist.</p> \n     <p>Impossibly—in a way I cannot\
  \ describe—that blow reversed itself. All the energy I was braced to expend upon\
  \ my enemy recoiled up the sword, up my arm, crashed against my own body. A violent\
  \ explosion of pain and shock sent the garden reeling. The earth struck hard against\
  \ my knees.</p> \n     <p>Mist cleared from my eyes. I was still Ganelon, but a\
  \ Ganelon dizzy from something more powerful than a blow.</p> \n     <p>I was kneeling\
  \ on the grass, braced with one hand, shaking the throbbing fingers of my sword-hand\
  \ and staring at the sword that lay a dozen feet away, still faintly glowing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was Matholch's doing—I knew that! I should have remembered how little\
  \ I could trust that shifting, unstable wolfing. I had laid hands upon him in his\
  \ tower-room—I should have known he would have his revenge for that. Even Edward\
  \ Bond—soft fool that he was—would have been wise enough not to accept a gift from\
  \ the shape-changer.</p> \n     <p>There was no time now for anger at Matholch,\
  \ though. I was looking up into Ertu's eyes, and into the muzzle of his weapon,\
  \ and the look of decision grew slowly in his face as he scanned mine. </p>\n  \
  \   <p> \"Ganelon!\" he said, almost whispering, \"Warlock!\"</p> \n     <p>He tilted\
  \ the weapon down at me, his finger moving on the trigger.</p> \n     <p> \"Wait,\
  \ Ertu!\" cried a thin voice behind him. \"Wait—let me!\"</p> \n     <p>I looked\
  \ up, still dazed. It had all happened so quickly that the girl was still struggling\
  \ in the edge of the trees, though she cleared them as I looked and lifted her own\
  \ weapon. Behind it her face was white and blazing with relentless hate. \"Let me!\"\
  \ she cried again. \"He owed me this!\"</p> \n     <p>I was helpless. I knew that\
  \ even at this distance she would not miss. I saw the glare of fury in her eyes\
  \ and I saw the muzzle waver a little as her hand shook with rage, but I knew she\
  \ would not miss me. I thought of a great many things in that instant—confused memories\
  \ of Ganelon's and of Edward Bond's surged together through my mind.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Then a great hissing like a wind swept up among the trees behind the girl.\
  \ They all swayed toward her more swiftly than trees have any right to move, stooping\
  \ and straining and hissing with a dreadful vicious avidity. Ertu shouted something\
  \ inarticulate. But I think the girl was too angry to hear or see.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ never knew what happened. She could only have felt the great bone-cracking sweep\
  \ of the nearest branch, reaching out for her from the leaning tree...</p> \n  \
