  \ Society Organized Play, Part IX: With Prestige Comes Fame</h1> \n    <p class=\"\
  date\">Monday, May 16, 2011</p> \n    <p>One of the unique elements of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play campaign is the presence of factions and each character's\
  \ growth within her faction using the prestige system. It's undergone some changes\
  \ over the last three years, most notably the tying of maximum buying power to total\
  \ prestige at the start of Season One. Well it's changing again, and in a way we\
  \ think will streamline the system for ease of use for GMs, authors, and most of\
  \ all, players.</p> \n    <p>Faction missions aren't going anywhere, but they are\
  \ going to change a bit. Instead of there being two faction missions for each of\
  \ the 10 factions, each one will have only a single difficult mission to earn that\
  \ faction's Prestige Point (PP). A second Prestige Point will be tied to several\
  \ success conditions of the main Pathfinder Society mission. Thus, an Andoran faction\
  \ Pathfinder can get his faction Prestige Point by freeing the slaves from the gnoll's\
  \ camp, while he gets a second Prestige Point by retrieving the ancient Lamashtan\
  \ relic that Venture-Captain Eliza Petulengro sent him after in the first place.\
  \ This is a direct response to fan feedback that there needed to be more reward\
  \ for actually completing the main mission of a Scenario. Also, it means our authors\
  \ only have to design 10 faction missions instead of 20—the same number they're\
  \ already doing.</p> \n    <p>You might notice I capitalized Prestige Point up there.\
  \ That's because it's a new game term we'll be using from here on out. No longer\
  \ do you need to track CPA and TPA. Prestige Award—the expendable resource gained\
  \ and spent in the course of an adventurer's career—is now expressed as Prestige\
  \ Points, and the total number of Prestige Points gained in the course of a career\
  \ is now called \"Fame.\" Fame is a constant score like Strength or Charisma, while\
  \ Prestige Points fluctuate like hit points or wealth.</p> \n    <p>In addition\
  \ to eliminating the confusing CPA/TPA wording, this newly codified system means\
  \ we can offer cool new abilities tied to Fame and costing a set amount of Prestige\
  \ Points. Check out the following faction resource that will be available to members\
  \ of the Andoran faction, from the forthcoming <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8g79\"\
  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Pathfinder Society Field Guide</a></i>:</p> \n   \
  \ <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Liberation (5 PP)</b> In the event that you are captured\
  \ and forced into slavery, the faction mounts a rescue operation, freeing you from\
  \ servitude without any material or physical effect. Any cost or penalty normally\
  \ associated with being enslaved (including magical effects such as <i>dominate\
  \ person</i>) is negated at no additional cost to you.</p>\n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>That'll cost 5 PP and can be spent anytime, regardless of how much Fame\
  \ the PC possesses. Other resources, like granting a character a noble title or\
  \ a military position, will require reaching certain Fame thresholds before Prestige\
  \ Points can be cashed in to actually gain the benefits. All 10 factions have a\
  \ number of these in the <i>Pathfinder Society Field Guide</i>, and we have ideas\
  \ of other places they may appear in the future.</p> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9235-ItsAKeyIGuess.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n    <p>Until next week, take a look at this\
  \ mysterious faction symbol. It's one of the new ones, and one I <i>would have</i>\
  \ revealed next week had we gotten enough new followers on our Facebook page. I\
  \ guess I'll just be talking about how things are shaking up within the Qadira faction\
  \ in next Monday's blog—same Path time, same Path channel.</p> \n    <p style=\"\
