  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Located halfway\
  \ along the Obari Crossing sea route that connects the Inner Sea to wondrous Vudra,\
  \ the archipelago of Iblydos boasts millennia-old city-states guided by ascended\
  \ hero-gods. At least that’s how society used to operate; the Age of Lost Omens\
  \ ruined prophecies’ reliability, and cyclopean prophecies were essential in creating\
  \ new hero-gods. As attrition and age kill off the remaining hero-gods, Iblydos\
  \ perseveres, made rich by trade yet dreading the demise of its pantheon.</p>\n\
  \      <p>In the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/mythspeaker\"\
  >Myth-Speaker Adventure Path</a>, the player characters visit the city-state of\
  \ Pol-Bailax as it mourns the death of an exceptional citizen—one who would have\
  \ become a hero-god in better times. Yet Iblydans don’t simply weep; they celebrate\
  \ a life well lived. The PCs’ arrival coincides with spectacular funeral games to\
  \ celebrate this hometown hero, and it’s a perfect time to join the festivities,\
  \ discover Iblydan history, and begin the PCs’ own legend. As they do, mythic power\
  \ is reawakening in Iblydos as not seen in ages. It’s all fun and games for now,\
  \ but the PCs soon attain mythic power of their own. Will they become the hero-gods\
  \ Iblydos has long sought? And what is this mythic power, why does it emerge now,\
  \ and what is the cost of this power?</p>\n      <p>Inside the <em><a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/Myth-Speaker_Players-Guide.pdf\"\
  >Myth-Speaker Player’s Guide</a><a></a></em>, you’ll find player-friendly, spoiler-free\
  \ tips and advice to help you create an exciting and engaging character ready to\
  \ take on what awaits. Contents include:</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li>Character suggestions,\
  \ including recommendations for ancestries, classes, languages, skills, and feats\
  \ well suited for this Adventure Path.</li>\n       <li>Six new backgrounds designed\
  \ for adventurers in Iblydos, such as the Student of Apotheosis who studies the\
  \ hero-gods of old and the Beast Seeker who dreams of confronting the legendary\
  \ monsters that call the islands home.</li>\n       <li>An overview of the remaining\
  \ hero-gods to inspire your own journey or even empower your divine spellcasters.</li>\n\
