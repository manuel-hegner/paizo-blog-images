  \ at Last</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 25, 2008</p> \n   <p>Science\
  \ fiction and fantasy. To much of the literate world, they're the same thing—they\
  \ even get shelved in the same section at all but the most enlightened bookstores.\
  \ Yet among those who enjoy these genres the most, the lines between the two are\
  \ sharp and expansive (even if no two people agree on where that line is drawn).\
  \ Many of the friends whose book recommendations I take to heart scoff at the idea\
  \ of getting science fiction chocolate in their fantasy peanut butter—they'll read\
  \ one but not the other. It's a sort of literary apartheid.</p> \n   <p>For me,\
  \ though, there's never been that divide. Science fiction and fantasy are two great\
  \ tastes that taste great together, and I don't mind rocking some boats to keep\
  \ the ampersand in SF&amp;F.</p> \n   <p>Sometimes, of course, the purists are right.\
  \ Every time Wes and Jacobs comb through one of my manuscripts to make sure I'm\
  \ not slipping hidden particle accelerators or robots into <i>Pathfinder</i>, I'm\
  \ forced to admit that they're correct to do so—it's important to keep a world internally\
  \ consistent, and getting too hung up on science in a magical setting can break\
  \ the feel (or the author). Never mind how cool it might have been to make Varisia's\
  \ towering Spindlehorn a space elevator for ancient thaumateurgic astronauts...\
  \ it just doesn't fit.</p> \n   <p>Which is why I was so happy to get a chance to\
  \ write the \"Into the Black\" support article for <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy81to\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #14</a>, a gazetteer of Golarion's solar system and the diverse\
  \ cultures which inhabit it. These days, I spend a lot of my time buried in <a href=\"\
  /planetStories\">Planet Stories</a> manuscripts, visiting worlds like <a href=\"\
  /search?q=leigh+brackett&amp;what=products\">Leigh Brackett's</a> exotic and dying\
  \ <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdr\">Skaith</a> in the <a href=\"/search?q=eric+john+stark&amp;what=products\"\
  >Eric John Stark books</a>, or <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8b\">Robert E.\
  \ Howard's Almuric</a>, not to mention swashbuckling Burroughsian pulp like the\
  \ Mars novels from <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8c\">Michael Moorcock</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/search?q=otis+adelbert&amp;what=products\">Otis Adelbert Kline</a>.\
  \ With this article, I (with significant influence from publisher Erik Mona) got\
  \ the chance to finally bring hardcore Planet Stories SF into the Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ setting.</p> \n   <p>While I included many more modern SF tropes, from the terminator-line\
  \ society of Verces to the irradiated liches of Eox the dead or the Jovian floaters\
  \ of Liavara and Bretheda, Golarion's closest neighbors are straight out of the\
  \ sword and planet genre epitomized by the Planet Stories books. The green planet\
  \ of Castrovel, with its steamy jungles and beautiful telepathic matriarchs, meshes\
  \ completely with the 1930s image of Venus, and any fan of Burroughs or Brackett\
  \ will quickly recognize their Mars in Akiton's four-armed warriors and desert strongholds.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>If you're like me and already enjoy mixing and matching your genres, I\
  \ hope <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy81to\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #14</a> hits the\
  \ spot. And if you're a <i>Pathfinder</i> or Planet Stories purist, well, this might\
  \ be a good point to give the other camp a shot and see what you've been missing.\
  \ After all, despite what Dr. Egon Spengler might say, sometimes it's <i>good</i>\
  \ to cross the streams...</p> \n   <p>James Sutter<br> <i>Planet Stories</i> Editor</p>\
