  \ href=\"/products/btpy8sa9\">Nightglass</a><i>, a young boy in the shadowy nation\
  \ of Nidal is taken from his home and trained by the sadistic magical academy known\
  \ as the Dusk Hall, transformed into a living weapon in the service of the dark\
  \ god Zon-Kuthon. Many years later, now grown to manhood, Isiem is sent to Cheliax\
  \ to help put down a rebellion by the winged, inhuman strix. Yet as he conducts\
  \ his grisly work, Isiem begins to question his life under the shadow of the Midnight\
  \ Lord, and wonder who the real monsters are...</i></p> \n   <h2>Chapter Thirteen:\
  \ Reprisals</h2> \n   <p>The whooping woke him.</p> \n   <p>It had been the better\
  \ part of a week since Isiem had talked to Orwyn and the others around the timber\
  \ wagons. Both he and Oreseis had spent the intervening days asking questions under\
  \ a succession of guises. Mostly Isiem chose illusionary identities whose mysterious\
  \ disappearances, like the Pezzacki half-orc's, could easily be laid at the Hellknights'\
  \ door; when such people vanished, it burnished their knights' reputation for ruthlessness\
  \ and raised few questions about where they had gone. Sometimes, so that people\
  \ would not wonder why the Nidalese never showed their faces, he went undisguised.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But whatever face he chose, and whomever he approached, Isiem learned\
  \ little about the strix. Wild rumors and speculation abounded, but accurate observations\
  \ seemed scarcer than waterfalls in the desert.</p> \n   <p>Some said the strix\
  \ were winged devils in more than name—that the diabolists of House Thrune had deliberately\
  \ summoned them from Hell and set them loose on the people of western Cheliax so\
  \ that they could offer protection from the threat they themselves had created.\
  \ Some said the mine overseers had struck a secret bargain with the strix, allowing\
  \ them to feast on lazy and unruly workers in exchange for leaving the others unmolested.\
  \ A few claimed—never when they knew Isiem was listening—that the strix were not\
  \ living creatures at all, but rather Nidalese thralls who had escaped from the\
  \ shadowcallers' control and hid in the deep recesses of Devil's Perch because no\
  \ light could reach them there.</p> \n   <p>The only sure thing anyone knew was\
  \ that the strix had murdered Chastain, her daughter, and everyone accompanying\
  \ them—and that the outrage demanded retribution.</p> \n   <p>That thought leaped\
  \ to the fore of Isiem's mind when he heard the whoops that morning. Pushing off\
  \ his blankets, he went to the window and pulled the curtain to the side.</p> \n\
  \   <p>The street below was crowded with cheering men gathered around four sweat-stained\
  \ riders on lathered horses. A dark-winged figure staggered on foot between the\
  \ riders, and two more broken, winged forms dragged in the dust behind them. The\
  \ ropes that bound the corpses were not tied around their ankles, but threaded through\
  \ gashes in their calves.</p> \n   <p>Fastening his shadowcaller's robe as he went,\
  \ Isiem hurried down the stairs.</p> \n   <p>Every citizen in Crackspike seemed\
  \ to have mobbed the street. He glimpsed the Hellknights pushing forward through\
  \ the fray, Posie's girls leaning bare-shouldered on their balcony, and miners and\
  \ laborers who had come fresh from their work, wearing clothes sweated through and\
  \ caked with dust so many times that the men seemed made of mud.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ creature who had attracted all their notice seemed oblivious to the crowd. The\
  \ strix hobbled between the riders with his head lowered between his enormous, bedraggled\
  \ black wings, unresponsive to the curses hurled his way or the occasional gob spat\
  \ on him by a spectator. The riders and their horses, spattered with similar missiles,\
  \ were less restrained; they answered with imprecations fiery enough to burn a Hellknight's\
  \ ears, or—if the spitter was foolish enough to be identifiable, and in reach—vicious\
  \ blows from their quirts.</p> \n   <p>Isiem ignored them, along with the occasional\
  \ shrieks from the bystanders they struck. It was the strix that interested him.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>This one was a juvenile, he guessed, and male. Head to toe, it was the\
  \ color of coal. Its eyes were enormous and eerily luminous, reflecting a green-violet\
  \ iridescence in the bright hot sun. There were no whites or pupils that Isiem could\
  \ see, although it was difficult to be sure with the creature's head bowed. Its\
  \ ears were thin and sharp, lying flat against its skull. It went barefoot, its\
  \ toes and fingers alike tipped with short translucent talons, and its clumsy pigeon-like\
  \ gait suggested that it did not often find reason to walk upon the ground.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Above all, however, it was the strix's wings that commanded attention.\
  \ Bent and broken, they still towered over the men on horseback. The feathers were\
  \ a glossy, oily black, touched with a peacock shimmer like the plumage on a loon's\
  \ throat. There was an undeniable grandeur to those wings, even as the creature\
  \ who bore them tottered crippled and diminished on the earth.</p> \n   <p>\"How\
  \ did you catch him?\" one of the whores called down.</p> \n   <p>\"Hunting,\" the\
  \ lead rider shouted back. \"This one\"—he jerked the strix's rope as if the creature\
  \ were a balky dog on a leash\"—thought he'd catch a few of our mules for dinner.\
  \ That was his mistake. The other two came to free him. That was theirs. They didn't\
  \ care to be taken alive, so I thought it only right to oblige them.\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"Are there any others?\" Paralictor Erevullo asked.</p> \n   <p>The rider\
  \ hesitated, winding and unwinding the reins around his hand several times before\
  \ answering. \"I can't be sure,\" he admitted, \"but I don't think so. These two\
  \ rushed in blind, they were so upset we'd caught their friend. Any others would've\
  \ done the same, if they were out there. Anyway, we didn't see no more.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>Erevullo nodded curtly. He gestured with a gauntleted hand to the battered\
  \ strix. \"We will take that one. In the name of Her Imperial Majestrix Abrogail\
  \ II.\"</p> \n   <p>The rider opened his mouth to protest, then closed it, returning\
  \ the Hellknight's nod even more brusquely. \"What about the others?\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"Sell them to your tavern to stuff as a showpiece. Cut them apart and sell\
  \ the pieces as keepsakes. Or just throw them by the roadside and let dogs feast\
  \ on the corpses.\" Erevullo shrugged. \"They are of no use to us. Do as you will.\"\
  \ The paralictor turned his flinty eyes on Isiem. \"It is said that the Kuthites\
  \ of Nidal are unrivaled in extracting information from their charges. I trust this\
  \ reputation is well founded.\"</p> \n   <p>\"It is,\" Isiem answered.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"They don't speak no civilized tongue,\" the rider interjected. \"Just screeches\
  \ and devil squawks. We couldn't get nothing sensible out of none of them.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Language is no obstacle,\" Isiem said. He turned to Erevullo. \"Is there\
  \ somewhere we might work without interruption?\"</p> \n   <p>The paralictor waited\
  \ for the rider to untie the strix's rope from his saddle horn. Upon receiving it,\
  \ Erevullo tossed the mudstained hemp to Isiem. \"One of the alehouses has a cellar.\
  \ They were using it as a dungeon of sorts. It's yours.\" He motioned to one of\
  \ the other Hellknights, a signifer whose clean-shaven scalp was tattooed with spiked\
  \ swirls of red and black. \"Odarro. Show the shadowcallers where they will work.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"This way.\" The bald signifer turned on his heel, leaving the riders\
  \ and the crowd to look on in confusion that soon turned to abuse of the two remaining\
  \ strix. Whether their victims were alive or not, the people of Crackspike seemed\
  \ all too happy to beat them and spit on their feathered remains.</p> \n   <p>Tugging\
  \ his captive along behind him, Isiem left them to their sport.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ cellar Erevullo had spoken of was beneath the Long-Bottomed Lady, the largest\
  \ of Crackspike's three ramshackle taverns. It was a cramped and dingy space, illumined\
  \ by wobbly shafts of light that spilled through the tavern's floorboards. Barrels\
  \ of beer and jars of white whisky crowded every available inch. A coating of sandy\
  \ grit clouded the vessels, although the tavern always drank through its stock within\
  \ days.</p> \n   <p>It was only on account of the liquor that the owners of the\
  \ place had undertaken the trouble of digging a cellar and laying in a wooden floor.\
  \ Spirits were unconscionably expensive in Crackspike, which had to import all its\
  \ necessities across miles of hard road. The owners of the Long-Bottomed Lady wanted\
  \ to protect their investment, and the easiest way to keep thirsty miners from stealing\
  \ their beer was to sit on it.</p> \n   <p>Isiem wondered whether his work would\
  \ dent their appetites. He doubted it. If anything, strix blood seemed to whet thirsts\
  \ in Crackspike. And there would likely be a great deal of blood before he was done.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He wanted to begin gently, though. Confidences won through trust were\
  \ worth more than secrets extracted through torture; the latter were often fragmentary\
  \ and peppered with lies. Many Kuthites chose to rely on torture anyway, but Isiem\
  \ valued effectiveness above piety.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> The strix are proud warriors—for all the good that\
  \ does them...\n   </div> \n   <p>The cellar had no chairs. He rolled two of the\
  \ smaller barrels from their nooks, arranging them so that they faced one another\
  \ across a short space. Touching the small clay talisman of a ziggurat in his pocket,\
  \ Isiem murmured the words that would grant him the gift of tongues. He'd prepared\
  \ the spell with the intention of questioning some of the miners whose Taldane was\
  \ shaky, but it would serve as well with the strix.</p> \n   <p>\"Speak to me,\"\
  \ he said. The words had an odd, doubled echo as they left his lips. Isiem heard\
  \ his own voice clearly, but just as clear were the stretched, shrill vowels and\
  \ harsh plosives of the strix's tongue. He was never sure what the listener heard—\
  but it hardly mattered, as long as he was understood. \"What is your name?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The strix gave him a hostile, unblinking stare. It did not sit on the\
  \ barrel as Isiem did, but perched on top, its clawed toes grasping the wooden edge.\
  \ In this light its eyes showed no iridescence; they were yellow as a hawk's. Faint\
  \ striations of darker gold, converging in the center of each eye, expanded and\
  \ contracted as it breathed.</p> \n   <p>\"You should answer me.\" Isiem drew the\
  \ holy symbol of Zon-Kuthon out from under his shirt and let it rest pointedly upon\
  \ his chest. \"Sooner or later, you must. And ‘later' will come at a cost.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"I am not afraid. Pain is nothing.\" The strix's voice had the same odd\
  \ echo as his own: familiar human words twinned to piercing shrills and whistles\
  \ only barely recognizable as speech. Its true voice seemed extraordinarily hoarse;\
  \ judging from the chapped skin around the strix's lipless mouth and the sunken,\
  \ bruised-looking circles around its eyes, that was a symptom of its recent hard\
  \ use rather than the creature's natural tone.</p> \n   <p>It made the creature's\
  \ bravado even more wearying. The strix would break. Under the ministrations of\
  \ a Pangolais-trained torturer, all men broke. And all dwarves, and all orcs. A\
  \ strix would be no different, however alien its appearance.</p> \n   <p>Isiem had\
  \ had his fill of breaking brave rebels in Westcrown. It was tedious, the progression\
  \ from braggadocio to stoicism to abject begging. Such men clung to loyalty and\
  \ principle as though it were a raft that could save them. It never did, but the\
  \ Nidalese wizard had long lost his taste for snapping their fingers to make them\
  \ let go.</p> \n   <p>\"I could show you otherwise very quickly,\" Isiem said, \"\
  but I will give you the chance to help yourself first. Again: what is your name?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"<i>Kirraak,</i>\" the strix cried. Whether it was a name or a curse,\
  \ the spell didn't translate it.</p> \n   <p>Isiem decided to accept it as a name.\
  \ \"Kirraak,\" he repeated, altering the sound to fit on a human tongue. \"How were\
  \ you captured?\"</p> \n   <p>For a long time the strix did not answer. Its chest\
  \ heaved with silent, desperate breaths. Then it cocked its head downward and veiled\
  \ its eyes with semitransparent membranes that slid across them from the side, instead\
  \ of lowering vertically like its true eyelids. \"Stupidity. They left a hurt mule\
  \ behind. I wanted it. Some of their dogs wanted it too. I was butchering the dead\
  \ mule when the dogs came upon me from behind. They kept me from flying.\" The strix\
  \ motioned toward one of the black wings hanging broken from its back. Up close,\
  \ it smelled of dust and wild oily feathers and a rank undercurrent of infection.\
  \ \"I could not escape when the men came back to see what their dogs were quarreling\
  \ over.\"</p> \n   <p>\"And your companions?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Untie me.\" The strix\
  \ lifted its head and held its arms out, showing him its rope-chafed wrists. The\
  \ coarse hemp was spotted with blood, red as Isiem's own. \"Untie me, and I will\
  \ say.\"</p> \n   <p>Kirraak tensed as Isiem drew a small knife to cut its bonds.\
  \ The muscles at the bases of its wings flexed, and it crouched slightly, gathering\
  \ its strength. Isiem noted its tension but continued sawing at the rope.</p> \n\
  \   <p>He wasn't surprised when the strix attacked. He <i>was</i> surprised at how\
  \ fast it was. Isiem was already ducking away when Kirraak snapped the last few\
  \ strands between its wrists, but he barely had time to put a barrel between them\
  \ before the strix seized a nearby bottle of brandy and hurled it at his head. The\
  \ bottle shattered on the wall inches away, raining liquor and glass shards. One\
  \ splinter nicked Isiem's chin, another his cheek.</p> \n   <p>\"<i>Krevaar!\"</i>\
  \ the strix screamed. \"I tell you <i>nothing!</i>\" </p> \n   <p>Isiem didn't waste\
  \ his breath on a reply. He shielded his eyes and dodged behind a second barrel.\
  \ Another bottle hurtled past, clipping the side of his head, but the strix itself\
  \ did not come. Glancing back, Isiem realized that the strix's wings gave him the\
  \ advantage in this confined space; Kirraak flinched every time the wounded appendages\
  \ struck anything, and the creature could hardly move without smacking its massive\
  \ wings into a wall or keg.</p> \n   <p>It had fashioned a crude sort of knife from\
  \ the remains of a broken bottle, though, and Isiem guessed that might prove more\
  \ lethal than its ineptly thrown missiles. If the strix got close enough to use\
  \ it.</p> \n   <p>He kicked a wine rack toward his adversary, sending bottles tumbling\
  \ everywhere. Two of them slammed into Kirraak's infected wounds, eliciting an ear-splitting\
  \ shriek and causing the strix to drop its improvised blade.</p> \n   <p>Isiem seized\
  \ the chance. Thrusting a hand in the strix's direction, he chanted quickly, nearly\
  \ tripping over the familiar words in his haste. Magic gathered in him like lightning\
  \ and lanced out, surrounding the strix in a crackling black halo. Needles of dark\
  \ energy stabbed into Kirraak.</p> \n   <p>The strix collapsed, keening in agony.\
  \ Its makeshift knife cracked under its body, cutting into the creature's arm and\
  \ chest, but it hardly seemed to notice this insult compared to the wracking pain\
  \ of Isiem's spell. As the strix's shrieks gave way to whimpers, and then into insensible\
  \ sobs, Isiem straightened and brushed the glass flinders from his hair.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"You should have answered my questions,\" he told the strix without rancor.\
  \ He had not, of course, really expected that Kirraak would. The rebels in Westcrown\
  \ seldom did; why would a strix be any different? This was just another step in\
  \ their dance, predictable and inevitable.</p> \n   <p>Kirraak made no answer. Isiem\
  \ hadn't expected one. He picked through the shattered glass and liquor pooled around\
  \ the semiconscious strix, selecting several of the longest, smoothest fragments\
  \ and laying them atop a nearby barrel. He was careful to arrange them where the\
  \ shafts of wintry sunlight made them glint in the cellar's gloom.</p> \n   <p>When\
  \ he had all the shards he needed, Isiem retied the crippled strix's arms and tossed\
  \ the rope over a rafter, hoisting Kirraak up onto its clawed toes. Standing in\
  \ that partly suspended position wouldn't hurt immediately, but in a few minutes\
  \ it would start to ache, and in an hour or so it would become unbearable.</p> \n\
  \   <p>As an afterthought, and as a courtesy to the Long-Bottomed Lady's guests,\
  \ Isiem gagged the strix with the wine-sodden remnants of a burlap sack. Then he\
  \ started another, simpler incantation, and passed a pale hand over the stained\
  \ rips in his robe. The torn threads knitted back together; the stains faded from\
  \ the cloth. In moments there was no evidence of his prisoner's defiance.</p> \n\
  \   <p>The illusion of infallibility was crucial to the fear a skillful torturer\
  \ inspired. Nothing his victims did could be seen to hurt him, or even interrupt\
  \ his plans. Everything that happened in his domain had to serve his purpose. The\
  \ strix's struggles, the shattered bottles, the wasted brandy—all of it, as far\
  \ as the world would ever know, was part of Isiem's designs.</p> \n   <p>Isiem picked\
  \ up a sliver of glass and drove it through the joint of the strix's infected wing.\
  \ Pus and dark blood spurted out. Kirraak screamed again, weakly; its head jerked\
  \ up once and fell back down, limp.</p> \n   <p>Coldly Isiem took a second sliver\
  \ of glass from the barrel and held it poised, waiting for the strix's eyes to flutter\
  \ open again.</p> \n   <p>Everything had its purpose.</p> \n   <p class=\"center\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n   <p class=\"body-no-indent\">\"Why did you let it fight back?\" Oreseis\
  \ asked.</p> \n   <p>Isiem shrugged, spooning pork-flecked oat mush from the pot\
  \ the Hellknights had brought up for them. To preserve their air of inhumanity,\
  \ the Nidalese did not eat where anyone might see them; instead they requisitioned\
  \ food from the Hellknights and sent their waste back the same way. The subterfuge\
  \ worked well enough, but he could wish the Hellknights indulged in better fare.\
  \ The Chelaxians subsisted on iron rations boiled in conjured water: oat mush, barley\
  \ porridge, wheat gruel dotted with shreds of dried apples or rock-hard sausage.\
  \ Practical, and perhaps good for discipline, but even by the standards of a Nidalese\
  \ ascetic, a Hellknight's trail dinner was a sorry meal.</p> \n   <p>Still, he'd\
  \ choked down worse. Isiem thrust his spoon into the gruel and sat on the side of\
  \ his bed. \"I always give them the chance to fight.\"</p> \n   <p>Oreseis had already\
  \ finished his own meal. He sat with his spellbook propped up on bent knees, making\
  \ a half-hearted pretense of studying the next day's magic. \"But why?\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"So I can be justified in what comes after.\" Seeing that the other shadowcaller\
  \ did not understand, Isiem sighed and set his spoon down. \"By giving my captives\
  \ a choice, I give them responsibility for what follows. If they choose to answer\
  \ readily, they escape pain. If they choose defiance, they suffer for it ...but\
  \ they know that it was their choice.\"</p> \n   <p>\"How virtuous,\" Oreseis said,\
  \ smirking.</p> \n   <p>\"Maybe.\" Isiem swallowed a mouthful of gruel, trying not\
  \ to taste it. The pork, somehow soggy and tough at the same time, actually made\
  \ it worse. \"But it is useful. Men who feel culpable for their own suffering are\
  \ conflicted. Guilty, angry, distracted. Easier to break.\" He took another bite,\
  \ wondering if Oreseis would believe the lie.</p> \n   <p>It <i>was</i> easier to\
  \ break a man who felt he'd brought his own woes upon himself. But not precisely\
  \ for the reasons he'd given.</p> \n   <p>The true reason Isiem gave them the chance\
  \ to fight was because putting the choice on the victim—putting the <i>fault</i>\
  \ on the victim—removed it from his own conscience. Framing the torture as the consequence\
  \ of the victim's decision, rather than his own, absolved the torturer of guilt.\
  \ And after Westcrown, Isiem could not work without that absolution.</p> \n   <p>Oreseis\
  \ closed his book and stretched his legs. \"Erevullo wants one of us to help his\
  \ signifers enchant their devilstongue relay.\" Seeing Isiem's puzzlement, he added:\
  \ \"It's how they intend to communicate with Citadel Enferac while the passes are\
  \ snowed in. Evidently their usual methods tend to get intercepted by strix spears.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"So I've been told. What's this relay?\"</p> \n   <p>The younger shadowcaller\
  \ shrugged. \"I didn't see the thing clearly when they were unloading it, and of\
  \ course its magic is unfinished, but it appears to be a brazier of gold and iron,\
  \ set with rubies and black stones. Obsidian, maybe. I couldn't see clearly. Erevullo\
  \ told me that they burn the tongues of devils in its flames, and thus carry their\
  \ messages through Hell back to Citadel Enferac, where other braziers exist to receive\
  \ the infernal words.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Can anyone use it, or just diabolists? Does\
  \ every relay communicate with every other? How much of a delay is there between\
  \ sending a message and receiving one?\"</p> \n   <p>Oreseis gave him an incredulous\
  \ look. \"How would I know? I've never used it. I haven't even <i>seen</i> it in\
  \ any meaningful way. But obviously we should learn more.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yes.\"\
  \ Isiem considered it for a moment. \"Offer to assist the Hellknights with their\
  \ relay. Learn what you can. The Umbral Court will be grateful for your report.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Oreseis tilted his head slightly, studying him. \"You're the better\
  \ wizard.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Making you the less obvious spy.\"</p> \n   <p>\"And the\
  \ less adept one.\" The younger wizard's mouth twisted into an expression that was\
  \ not quite grimace and not quite smile. \"Don't mistake me. I'm honored that you\
  \ offer me the opportunity. But should I miss some detail that you would have caught,\
  \ the Umbral Court will be displeased with us both. I cannot imagine the relay is\
  \ that simple, or Erevullo would not have asked us to help with it—nor would he\
  \ be so cavalier about giving us the chance to study it.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Or he wants\
  \ us to take note of Citadel Enferac's efficiency,\" Isiem said pointedly, \"so\
  \ that we understand how valuable they are as allies and how dangerous as enemies.\
  \ We could second-guess his motives for hours and it wouldn't matter. What <i>matters</i>\
  \ is that we have the opportunity to learn more about this device, and you have\
  \ the skill to study it without arousing suspicion.\" He softened his tone slightly.\
  \ \"You do have the skill, you know. The Umbral Court would not have tasked you\
  \ with this assignment if you were lacking.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Why won't you do it?\"\
  </p> \n   <p><i>Because I don't want to go back to Nidal.</i> Knowing a secret valuable\
  \ to either the Hellknights or the Umbral Court would give them a reason to hunt\
  \ him down, and Isiem intended to offer them none. But what he said was: \"Because\
  \ I have a strix to break.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Ah.\" Oreseis nodded. \"That need not\
  \ delay you long. There is a quicker way. Quicker, and holier.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Oh?\"</p> \n   <p>The younger shadowcaller stood, put his spellbook away, and retrieved\
  \ something else from his pack: a round object, about the size of his hand, muffled\
  \ in black velvet.</p> \n   <p>He held the nightglass up, still veiled. \"Send one\
  \ to the shadow, and he will give us all his kin. Another nation under Zon-Kuthon.\"\
