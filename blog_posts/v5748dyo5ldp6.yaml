  \ August 2, 2012</p> \n   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As some have noticed,\
  \ when we launched the new Pathfinder Society Organized Play homepage here on paizo.com,\
  \ we removed the Write for Pathfinder Society page. This is mainly because the Open\
  \ Call as it existed wasn’t working as intended and we were in the process of changing\
  \ it. Well, that process is now complete, and aspiring authors and game designers\
  \ can now find the revised guidelines on the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/getInvolved\"\
  >Get Involved!</a> page.</span></p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8ttq\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPSQ0001E_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>In short, for the last few years, we’d been\
  \ asking for brief adventure proposals for Pathfinder Society Scenarios, while at\
  \ the same time increasing the amount of plotting that went into each successive\
  \ season. The result of this was that even when we got an outline for an amazing\
  \ adventure we wanted to publish, finding a way to fit it into the season’s metaplot\
  \ or product schedule between other scenarios became untenable. Additionally, we\
  \ found that asking for a few hundred words of prose didn’t give us a good sense\
  \ of how an author would actually perform when tasked with writing encounters, designing\
  \ stat blocks, and mapping, all of which are vital skills any freelancer needs to\
  \ possess. The end result was that we weren’t getting submissions we could easily\
  \ use, and the already difficult task of getting one’s foot in the door as one of\
  \ Paizo’s writers became even more challenging for those submitting queries.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The solution we’ve now implemented is this: instead of asking for an adventure\
  \ proposal, we’re now soliciting Pathfinder Society Quests—2,000-word mini-adventures\
  \ containing one or two tiered encounters and using GameMastery Map Packs and Flip-Mat\
  \ lines. This format allows authors to show us they have a grasp of the rules, can\
  \ write an adventure on a small scale, and can tell a story using encounters as\
  \ the primary mode of imparting plot and character to players and GMs. And, to top\
  \ it all off, a submission we like is something we can immediately use with very\
  \ little development. Whether we publish an accepted Quest on paizo.com, use it\
  \ as a Pathfinder RPG demo at conventions or game stores, or promote the campaign\
  \ by putting the adventure in another medium like Kobold Quarterly, authors whose\
  \ work we like can get paid for their effort and see the fruits of their labor in\
  \ print much faster.</p> \n   <p>You can now download our first Pathfinder Society\
  \ Quest, the Tier 1–5 <a href=\"/products/btpy8ttq\"><i>Ambush in Absalom</i></a>\
  \ (written last spring by yours truly). We’ll let everyone know when we have more\
  \ available and where you can find them.</p> \n   <p>I look forward to seeing what\
  \ great ideas the community has to offer!</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
