  \ Seven</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 9, 2009</p> \n    <p><i>7. You\
  \ are running an Adventure Path, and one of your players is ignoring the obvious\
  \ hook. Do you gently nudge him in the planned direction, or do you go with the\
  \ flow and see where this digression might take you?</i></p> \n    <p><b>Lisa Stevens</b>:\
  \ Basically I try to nudge, or I may come up with a different hook. For example,\
  \ in <a href=\"/dungeon/products/books/v5748btpy7dx9\">Shackled City</a>, there\
  \ is an adventure where the players need to be convinced to go to an evil plane,\
  \ and I just knew the hook as written would not work on my players, so instead I\
  \ had the NPC seek out one of my PCs who was a rogue, and basically had the NPC\
  \ convince him that great wealth and power were to be had there, and then I just\
  \ let him convince the rest of the party. But in one of my early D&amp;D groups,\
  \ my players made me a sign that read \"HINT HINT,\" and they told me to hold it\
  \ up whenever they were being too dense. So basically I would be like, \"The bartender\
  \ begins telling you about an old abandoned mine...\" (holds up sign).</p> \n  \
  \  <p><b>F. Wesley Schneider</b>: I think the most interesting thing about being\
  \ a GM is the art of getting the players to do exactly what you want but making\
  \ them think it was their idea. There is nothing more satisfying than having your\
  \ players come up with this really brilliant and clever idea, and it's exactly what\
  \ you wanted them to do from the beginning.</p> \n    <p><b>James Jacobs</b>: I\
  \ let the players do their own thing, but they eventually end up where I want them\
  \ regardless. Basically I just remain flexible and adapt.</p> \n    <p><b>Erik Mona</b>:\
  \ I just let them go wherever. I'm perfectly happy allowing them to dictate the\
  \ action.</p> \n    <p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b>: Depends on the group. Sometimes you'll\
  \ get a bunch of chaotic players who want to be the embodiment of mayhem. In those\
  \ situations you have to make a decision: do you keep slapping them with plot hooks\
  \ or do you just wander off aimlessly into the woods?</p> \n    <p><b>Sean K Reynolds</b>:\
  \ I don't plan too far ahead, so I can remain flexible to my players' actions.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Joshua J. Frost</b>: I try to gently nudge them back, usually with\
  \ an NPC. But if they insist on running off, I'm pretty good at improv.</p> \n \
  \   <p><b>James Sutter</b>: It depends on the type of game I'm running. A lot of\
  \ the time I'll just play a sandbox style of game, where I'll show up with some\
  \ sticky notes and that's it. If it's an AP, I generally try to weave and nudge\
  \ them in the right direction. But I also tend to play with big groups; my last\
  \ campaign had eight players. In those situations, I really feed off of what my\
  \ players give me, and in a lot of ways depend on that. I'm a big fan of using experienced\
  \ players to my advantage, too. I rely on the more experienced players to help coach\
  \ the novices.</p> \n    <p><b>Chris Self</b>: If the players are following something\
  \ that might actually lead somewhere, then I'll let them do whatever, but if they're\
  \ just sort of spinning their wheels, I'll try to nudge them in the right direction.\
  \ I actually once played in a campaign that fell apart because the GM gave us too\
  \ many hooks and not enough of a nudge in any one direction.</p> \n    <p><i>I've\
  \ never minded players wandering off. I'll kill them wherever they go, one way or\
  \ another.</i></p> \n    <p>Hank Woon <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n   </blockquote>\
