  \ <blockquote> \n   <h1>Secrets of the Revolution</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday,\
  \ September 29, 2010</p> \n   <p>With the conclusion of Amber Scott's <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/tales/serial/v5748dyo5lbgk\">low-down, dirty story</a> of life in the\
  \ swamps of Nirmathas, it's time for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial\">free\
  \ Wednesday web fiction</a> to head across Lake Encarthan to the little town of\
  \ Dabril in Galt, best known for its fine perfumes and gloves, as well as a tendency\
  \ to send folks to the guillotine at the slightest provocation. (But then, what\
  \ town in Galt doesn't?) It's to this less-than-welcoming setting that a young alchemist\
  \ returns home after years with the militia, body broken by the ravages of war and\
  \ in search of any thread of familiarity that might help him start a new life. Yet\
  \ here he finds more than he bargained for, for in the ruins of Dabril's noble manor\
  \ house lie alchemical secrets beyond anything a simple grenadier can imagine...</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The author of this month's story, Kevin Andrew Murphy, is no stranger\
  \ to Pathfinder, having already written <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker/v5748btpy8b7w\"\
  >a chapter in the Prodigal Sons Pathfinder's Journal</a> in the Kingmaker Adventure\
  \ Path (in the process introducing the bizarre and fabulous Clever Nella puppet\
  \ show, plus a new way to play with a Harrow deck). In addition, he's written fiction\
  \ for everyone from George R. R. Martin's Wild Cards series to White Wolf's World\
  \ of Darkness (from whence his character Penny Dreadful hails), as well as several\
  \ standalone novels, RPG adventures, poems, and more.</p> \n   <p>Most pertinent\
  \ to this story, however, is Kevin's encyclopedic knowledge of alchemy. A professional\
  \ consultant on the subject for both television and the gaming industry, Kevin understands\
  \ as well as (or better than) anyone here in the editorial pit exactly how the real-world\
  \ science of alchemy evolved, and uses that knowledge to great effect in taking\
  \ us inside the brain of one of Golarion's alchemists, showing off that same esoteric\
  \ passion and the unique worldview it inspires. While alchemy in the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG doesn't track precisely to real-world historical practices, and individual\
  \ alchemists are likely as different in their approaches as any wizards or rogues,\
  \ I hope you'll agree that Kevin's character of Norret Gantier is a fascinating\
  \ specimen, and that his story is as educational as it is exciting!</p> \n   <p>James\
