  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">In the last\
  \ adventure, the players gallivanted around on the corpses of murdered demon lords\
  \ competing for the blessings of the demon lord who killed them. What could possibly\
  \ top that? <a href=\"/products/btpy9dao\">Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth</a> definitely\
  \ ups the ante again.</p> \n    <p>Iomedae has a little problem: her Herald went\
  \ and got himself captured by the demons and hauled off to a prison in the Abyss.\
  \ This situation cannot be allowed to continue, and she needs the best the world\
  \ has to offer. But who has the right resume for such a job? Perhaps a ragtag team\
  \ that has pushed back the demon hordes, led crusader armies into the heart of the\
  \ Worldwound, freed a former crusader stronghold, and ventured into the Abyss to\
  \ stop the production of elixirs that grant mythic powers to demons.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ first, there must be an interview.</p> \n    <h2>Performance Review</h2> \n  \
  \  <p>The RPG adventure <a href=\"/products/btpy92lh\">\"Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth\"\
  </a> begins with the players being summoned into the presence of the god Iomedae.\
  \ Even for mythic characters, this is not something that happens every day. She\
  \ tests them to see if they are worthy of the task she has for them. Her tests don't\
  \ involve combat; they're questions, and they're the types of questions a god might\
  \ ask. They are hard questions. They are tricky questions. There seem to be real\
  \ consequences for getting them wrong and real rewards for getting them right, not\
  \ the least of which is being sent to the Abyss again to rescue the Herald.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The real question, though, is how to model this in the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game. Well, we took some liberties and made up some new rules, and those\
  \ are some of my favorite things to do.</p> \n    <p>The scenario Audience with\
  \ the Inheritor has a lot of features that make it unique. First, you treat the\
  \ villain, The Lady of Valor, differently. She's not shuffled into a location with\
  \ the henchmen; she goes into the blessings deck instead. This makes a huge difference.\
  \ For one thing, it means that you only have to worry about the villain popping\
  \ up at the start of your turn. Once that's over, you're free to explore to your\
  \ heart's content. A less obvious benefit is that you will never end the scenario\
  \ without finding the villain. And as long as there are still cards in the blessing\
  \ deck, you always know you will get to meet the Lady at least one more time.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She also has a singular power: her check to defeat is increased by 10\
  \ for each character in the game. Everyone will need to contribute each time she's\
  \ encountered in order to defeat her. Failure also means that <i>every</i> character\
  \ takes 1d10 damage they can't prevent, and then she goes back into the blessing\
  \ deck.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-AudienceWithTheInheritor.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>You rang??</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>It's not as hopeless as\
  \ it looks, though. The characters have some powerful tools to help them in their\
  \ tasks; remember that Iomedae <i>wants</i> them to win! First of all, the locations\
  \ in this scenario are the friendliest you are likely to find anywhere. There are\
  \ only 4 banes (plus the henchmen) among all 6 locations. It's practically a treasure\
  \ trove. There's a new location called Heaven that is especially nice—players get\
  \ to add a die to their checks against Deities (guess who!) for each marker on the\
  \ card. You can get markers by closing the location, but the henchmen are also a\
  \ big help. If you defeat them, they add markers to Heaven as well. By the end of\
  \ the game, you could have 8 markers on Heaven, and I'm sure 8 dice would really\
  \ help against the Lady.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-Heaven.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Bloody well rite!</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Interesting Choices</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Once the players pass Iomedae's little test, they are dispatched to the\
  \ Abyss (again) to secure the release of her Herald. They must journey through the\
  \ realms of Baphomet, the lord of minotaurs and mazes, to a magical prison where\
  \ the Herald is being held.</p> \n    <p>Along the way, many cool things can happen,\
  \ but the last scenario contains two of the coolest.</p> \n    <p>First, it contains\
  \ an optional fight. After the players defeat the Herald, they can simply end the\
  \ scenario... <i>or</i> they can go and try to kick a Demon Lord's butt first. It's\
  \ totally up to the players and will probably depend heavily on how they feel and\
  \ what cards they have. Baphomet is no joke, and it might be wisest to simply take\
  \ the win when you can get it. If they can defeat him, though, they get an extra\
  \ piece of loot: the Amulet of the Abyss!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\
  \ <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-Baphomet.jpg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-AmuletOfTheAbyss_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Are you ready?</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The second cool thing\
  \ also occurs at the end of final scenario as part of the reward. One of the players\
  \ can choose to trade in his mythic path card for one of two mythic paths that represent\
  \ assuming the mantle of the Herald of Iomedae. One of the paths is more suited\
  \ to melee or divine characters, the other to ranged or arcane ones. The choice\
  \ is up to the players, but it's a one-time offer.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>The benefits package is pretty good.</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Labyrinthine\
  \ Challenges</h2> \n    <p>AD5 adds several extra tricky banes to the game as well.\
  \ One of the most clever is the Corruption Demon. With a 25 combat check to defeat,\
  \ he's no slouch, but that isn't where his true strengths lie. If a player can't\
  \ make a difficult Intelligence or Knowledge check, her character is going to get\
  \ carted off to the Middle of Nowhere, and that place is rough. And that's not the\
  \ demon's only trick. If he's undefeated, he deals damage, and then instead of going\
  \ back into the deck, he gets displayed next to a character and reduces all non-physical\
  \ skills to a d4. Fun times!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-CorruptionDemon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-CorruptionDemon_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>He just keeps asking \"Are we there yet!?\"</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Also of note is the Xenarth. You only need a modest 24 to defeat it,\
  \ but if the location deck isn't nearly empty, the Xenarth is turn up again like\
  \ a bad penny. Oh, and you might take 2 Acid and 2 Poison damage as well.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-Xenarth.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>\"Demon sharks. Why did it have to be demon sharks?\"</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The barriers are very entertaining as well. There's a Temptation,\
  \ of course, but I think the most interesting barrier here is the Magic Ray Fusillade.\
  \ Unless you're Ezren, you're going to find the 18 check to defeat fairly difficult.\
  \ And if you fail, someone is going to get hit for a LOT of damage in very small\
  \ buckets. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-MagicRayFusillade.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <p>The Bureau of Totally Made Up Facts tells us that every year, hundreds\
  \ of people get lost in the mazes of the Abyss, never to return. They leave a variety\
  \ of useful items for adventurers to discover, though some are not always so nice.</p>\

  \ <p>This set has so many good spells that I just want to call them all out, but\
  \ my favorite is Elemental Bombardment. It doesn't do anything too crazy. It's primarily\
  \ just a damaging spell. But I love the idea of summoning a giant elemental high\
  \ up in the sky, from which it plummets directly onto your opponent and then it\
  \ gets up and beats on them.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-ElementalBombardment.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>What's that whistling sound?</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The real\
  \ standout boons, however, are the allies in this set.</p> \n    <p>Let's start\
  \ with one that really highlights what playing in a mythic campaign is all about.\
  \ The main storyline and goal of the first PACG Adventure Path, Rise of the Runelords,\
  \ is to defeat one of the ancient Runelords who has returned to the land. He's the\
  \ big baddie of the set, and it takes all of the players' efforts to defeat him\
  \ at the end of the AP.</p> \n    <p>Here we have Runelord Alderpash. Not only is\
  \ he <i>not</i> the major villain of this set, he's a prisoner of Baphomet who can\
  \ become your ally. HE WORKS FOR YOU! Now that's mythic! And he's pretty awesome\
  \ as well, adding 2d4+1 and an elemental trait to a combat check, or you can just\
  \ banish him to permanently close any location.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-RunelordAlderpash_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>More like \"Alderwuss.\"</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>There is also\
  \ Orengofta, a demon who's hoping to cash in on the players by betraying them...\
  \ until he notices how powerful they are, and then he's glad to help them. In this\
  \ case, he helps by looking for the villain, and if he finds one, he can put it\
  \ on top of your dresser. But if he doesn't find one, there will be <s>Hell</s>\
  \ <i>the Abyss</i> to pay.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-Orengofta.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-Orengofta_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Follow me not...</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here's a little trick\
  \ you should know about these allies: Not one of them has a check to acquire. Instead,\
  \ you're going to have to <i>do something</i> to free them from their prison cells.\
  \ And I'm sure you'll <i>never</i> regret doing it...</p> \n    <p>Games are often\
  \ about the stories you can tell to your friends about things that happen while\
  \ you're playing them. I'd be hard pressed to come up with a better story than:\
  \ \"First we had tea with the Lady of Valor. Then we went to the Abyss and fought\
  \ our way to the Ineluctable Prison where we rescued the Herald of Iomedae, and\
  \ I got these lovely Baphomet horns to hang above the fireplace.\"</p> \n    <p>Paul\
