  \ we in the real world aren't the only ones doing our civic duty today; inhabitants\
  \ of the Inner Sea region are also participating in their own celebration of taxes,\
  \ sponsored by the church of Abadar. Editor-in-Chief F. Wesley Schneider got his\
  \ taxes done early, and used the extra time to put together a special holiday blog\
  \ for the Pathfinder Society community. You will find a special Pathfinder Society\
  \ Chronicle sheet below, which you can download and apply to a Pathfinder Society\

  \     <p>No one enjoys paying taxes. Every year, though, on the 15th of Gozran,\
  \ priests of the church of Abadar spend the day walking city streets, doing what\
  \ they can to make the bitter pill of annual taxes a bit easier to swallow. From\
  \ dawn to dusk, clerics of Abadar attend the tax collectors of sizable communities\
  \ as the tax wagons roll from door to door. More than just aiding in the yearly\
  \ errand, the faithful personally thank every citizen for contributing to the improvement\
  \ of their city, extol the public works funded by their contributions, and foretell\
  \ the grandeur of civic projects to come. The disenfranchised and destitute they\
  \ attempt to comfort as best they can, quoting from their god's dogma on work and\
  \ worthiness, but this is not a day for discounts or deferrals.</p> \n     <p>At\
  \ dusk, the Abadarans host several celebrations in parks, plazas, and other communal\
  \ areas about the city, organizing donations and contributions from local vendors\
  \ to feed and entertain all comers. Having already preached to most of the city\
  \ over the course of the day, the clerics perform only a brief opening ceremony,\
  \ dedicating the feast to Abadar, the city, and its great people. These celebrations\
  \ are often quite distinct from neighborhood to neighborhood and are almost always\
  \ divided along economic boundaries.</p> \n     <p>The festivities involving the\
  \ wealthiest citizens usually happen on the steps of city hall or other grand civic\
  \ buildings and feature the best music and food, but often little more than polite\
  \ card and guessing games. These galas usually wrap up by midnight.</p> \n     <p>For\
  \ the common folk, the parks and marketplaces take on a carnival atmosphere, with\
  \ simple but good food, local ales, performances by talented citizens, and games\
  \ of chance going on well into the night. A prevailing superstition through these\
  \ festivals is that, during the celebration, it's lucky to kiss—or in some regions,\
  \ pinch—a cleric of Abadar, leading to many a rosy cheeked cleric.</p> \n     <p>Even\
  \ the city's poor are given reason to celebrate, as the local temple of Abadar hosts\
  \ a cheery but unabashedly religious gathering on its steps, feeding all comers,\
  \ doling out a hearty ration of wine, singing hymns of the faith, and providing\
  \ tokens for a second wine ration for any who return to attend a service within\
  \ the month.</p> \n     <p>For a holiday that revolves around paying taxes, this\
  \ Abadaran festival isn't as reviled as one might expect.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Use the Chronicle sheet below to celebrate your pending tax refund or\
  \ for a little escapism from the realities of whatever you may owe. And for those\
  \ of you in other countries where taxes aren't due today, maybe you want to earn\
  \ this boon while you can and save it for your nation's tax day.</p> \n    <p align=\"\
