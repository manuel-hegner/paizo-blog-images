  artist: "what I found—a like-minded community enthused about roleplaying games,\
    \ and wonder of wonders, so was the staff! A little over five years later (and\
    \ a not-insignificant amount of cookies), I have been happy to call many of the\
    \ people on the Paizo staff friend. Now, though, I get to call them coworker and\
    \ see the level of dedication they give to the products they put out every month\
    \ for our gaming pleasure. While I am a young padawan learning at the foot of\
    \ masters, my compatriots Cosmo and Sara Marie will be showing me everything that\
    \ makes Paizo's Customer Service department awesome. After one day looking over\
    \ their shoulders, I know that I have much to learn—maybe some of their awesomeness\
    \ will rub off on me. Time to go feed the cave raptors—I think Crystal knows where\
    \ they are at, but I don't think they eat cookies... I may need to arm myself,\
    \ just in case. Liz Courts Customer Service"
