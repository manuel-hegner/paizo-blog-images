  \ of the Guard</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">Even after she and Karag were led to a private room in the back of\
  \ what proved a pleasant little tavern—complete with dark wood booths and antique\
  \ table lanterns—Lisette couldn't quite believe the dwarf's claim that he'd get\
  \ her connected with the banker. Yet the dwarf wasn't one to offer reassurances,\
  \ and she wasn't one to ask for them, so she simply fell to repairing the musket\
  \ while he assaulted a large platter of ribs and downed mug after mug of frothy\
  \ ale.</span></p> \n    <p>Proof of Karag's story arrived within a quarter-hour\
  \ of him asking the tavern keeper to relay a message. A large man in the blue coat\
  \ of the city guard trooped into their room, closing the door behind him with elaborate\
  \ care. </p> \n    <p>Lisette set aside Kerrigan's rifle. Loaded.</p> \n    <p>Karag\
  \ glanced up and swallowed quickly before dabbing greasy lips with his napkin. \"\
  Lisette Demonde, this is Lieutenant Vech Marill. Lieutenant, this is Lisette Demonde.\
  \ A bounty hunter.\"</p> \n    <p>Vech was large and thick, and between that and\
  \ his grim demeanor he might have resembled one of Belvar's thugs if he hadn't carried\
  \ himself with pompous dignity. His uniform, from the cuff of his pants to the collar\
  \ of his coat, was immaculate, and his well-groomed mustache ends extended an absurd\
  \ thumb-length beyond his face.</p> \n    <p>The lieutenant trod heavily across\
  \ the planks and bowed. \"Charmed,\" he told Lisette.</p> \n    <p>\"As am I.\"\
  \ She had decided against rising, so as to leave the question of who socially ranked\
  \ whom more uncertain. \"Karag told me he had connections in the guard. He didn't\
  \ mention they were so gentlemanly.\"</p> \n    <p>Karag grunted and downed a long\
  \ swig from a foaming mug of ale.</p> \n    <p>\"Won't you join us?\" she asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Vech pulled out a chair across from her and took a seat. </p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-LieutenantVech_500.jpeg\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br>Lieutenant Vech is far too fond of his mustache.\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>\"She spoiled my work for you, Lieutenant,\" Karag growled between mouthfuls.\
  \ \"She royally tupped the whole situation with Belvar. You'll have to find a new\
  \ spy.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I saved his life,\" Lisette said. \"Twice.\"</p> \n    <p>Karag\
  \ grunted but didn't correct her. She saw Vech's eyebrows twitch with interest.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Lisette explained. \"Karag and his bagman were jumped in an alley where\
  \ I just happened to be. We got out together. Then, when Belvar proved uninterested\
  \ in my business proposal, he became combative with both of us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  A business proposal?\" Vech's mustache twitched disapprovingly.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ passed over the bowman's warrant. Vech unfolded it, lingering for a moment upon\
  \ the bloodstain in the corner. Kerrigan had been carrying it.</p> \n    <p>\"Is\
  \ this blood?\" Vech asked.</p> \n    <p>Lisette nodded once. \"This assassin is\
  \ after one of your prominent citizens.\" She artfully brushed hair from her forehead\
  \ and fixed Vech with an intent gaze. \"Some of your men misconstrued my activity\
  \ earlier today, and gave chase.\"</p> \n    <p>Vech blinked. \"Wait a moment. Were\
  \ you the one firing arrows willy-nilly from rooftops near the Centre Street court?\
  \ That's not—\"</p> \n    <p>She tried to keep irritation from her voice. \"Not\
  \ me. That was the bowman.\" </p> \n    <p>Vech frowned and touched his mustache.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"He was planning to shoot his target,\" Lisette continued, \"but\
  \ I surprised him so he aimed his arrows at me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Do you have a license?\"\
  \ Vech asked.</p> \n    <p>Lisette studied him for a long moment, hoping he wasn't\
  \ as thick as he seemed. Then she reached into a small belt pouch and handed over\
  \ a sheaf of stamped papers. She waited as he unfolded and read over each of them,\
  \ knowing he'd find all of it in proper order. There wasn't only an official Andoren\
  \ seal affixed to the bottom of the primary document, there were all the proper\
  \ signatures, and additional bounty licenses from Isger, Druma, and Absalom.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He handed them all back. \"You should have reported your activity to\
  \ the guard immediately upon entering our jurisdiction. A less lenient man might\
  \ see fit to bring you up on charges.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And you're a lenient man?\"\
  \ She gave him her best smile.</p> \n    <p>It worked, and the big man returned\
  \ one of his own. \"I'm willing to provide concessions for a... newcomer to the\
  \ city.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I just want the bowman, Lieutenant. He's stalking someone\
  \ in banking who's known to have some underworld contacts, a Jhon Dronsbech. I thought\
  \ Belvar might introduce us.\"</p> \n    <p>Vech's brows rose. </p> \n    <p>She'd\
  \ learned Jhon Dronsbech was a prominent and prickly citizen, a member of Oregent's\
  \ city council, and she'd been worried about how someone in the guard might react\
  \ to information that an assassin was on his tail. \"If you value his safety,\"\
  \ Lisette said, \"I suggest precautions be taken sooner rather than later. The bowman\
  \ is quite deadly.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Jhon is a wealthy man, with his own security.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Lisette arched an eyebrow. \"It's your affair.\"</p> \n    <p>Vech\
  \ fingered the end of his mustaches, twirling them between finger and thumb. \"\
  I'll ride out to speak with him at once.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'd like to accompany\
  \ you,\" Lisette volunteered.</p> \n    <p>He looked surprised. \"You? Why?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"To bear witness. He may not believe just how dangerous the bowman is.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You have personal experience with this killer?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Yes.\" Something in her voice drew Vech's eyes to hers for a long moment. Finally,\
  \ he nodded.</p> \n    <p>Her eyes flicked to the dwarf. \"I'd like him along.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Karag? He still has half a pig to eat.\"</p> \n    <p>The dwarf\
  \ wiped hands on his napkin. \"She wants me to earn my keep. If the bowman's there,\
  \ I get two-fifths of the bounty.\"</p> \n    <p>The officer's eyes narrowed. \"\
  You think the bowman will be there?\"</p> \n    <p>\"He'll be wherever the banker\
  \ is,\" Lisette said, \"looking for opportunities to strike. I hope to flush him\
  \ out with the game.\"</p> \n    <p>Vech seemed to think long and hard about that.\
  \ \"I'm not sure I like your analogy, but very well. Dronsbech's a touchy one, and\
  \ your story might make him a little more receptive.\"</p> \n    <p>Vech ordered\
  \ a carriage and brought along a pop-eyed corporal he assured her was an excellent\
  \ swordsman. She eyed the slim young man dubiously as the carriage got underway,\
  \ and the soldier, Culcumber, proved irritating almost on the instant. He pointed\
  \ at the rifle, just visible in the gloom owing to the open curtains and the full\
  \ moon.</p> \n    <p>\"What's that?\" His voice was thin, sharp.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  A ranged weapon.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Is it magic?\" Culcumber asked. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  No.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then what is it?\"</p> \n    <p>Lisette was far more interested\
  \ in watching the lay of the land as they approached the city gates, so she decided\
  \ to head off further questions. \"It's a gun. From Alkenstar. I carry four. The\
  \ longer ones have greater range; all have excellent stopping power. And no, I won't\
  \ be telling you anything else about them.\" At that she fell silent, then pushed\
  \ the curtain aside to consider the passing streets.</p> \n    <p>As they rode out\
  \ north of the city, Vech attempted small talk a couple times, but Lisette kept\
  \ her answers curt. Didn't the chatty soldiers realize they were heading into combat?\
  \ At least Karag was silent.</p> \n    <p>Before much longer they turned off onto\
  \ a country lane. A manor stood in the lee of a hill ablaze with light. Lanterns\
  \ strung on poles ascended the hill, and figures strolled up and down dressed in\
  \ wild garments with fantastical masks. A band of a dozen musicians, dressed alike\
  \ in green finery, sat on dark benches, plying their trade on violins, cellos, and\
  \ woodwinds, and it made a merry sound on the evening air.</p> \n    <p>Great. What\
  \ more perfect cover could an assassin encounter when closing in on a target? </p>\
  \ \n    <p>The same thought must have occurred to Vech, who was eying the perimeter.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Dronsbech at least had an ample force of guardsmen—grim mercenary types\
  \ wearing dark red tabards over leather armor. Two came immediately to inspect the\
  \ carriage. Vech motioned for the others to remain within and dropped to the ground.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The guard who stepped forward to meet him was a well-built veteran with\
  \ a crooked lower lip. His eyes flicked brightly over the uniform coat and Vech's\
  \ insignia. \"Are you an invited guest, Lieutenant?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I've urgent\
  \ news for Mister Dronsbech.\" Vech put his shoulders back. \"His life may be in\
  \ grave danger.\"</p> \n    <p>The fellow's expression clouded, and he studied Vech\
  \ for a moment before coming to a decision. \"Come on, then. Who's the rest in the\
  \ carriage?\"</p> \n    <p>\"One of my men, and witnesses to the assassin who's\
  \ after your master.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Assassin?\" The guardsmen's eyebrows climbed\
  \ a little higher. \"Alright.\" He glanced at his companion. \"Laltros, you're in\
  \ charge of the gate. Might want to call up Murgan.\"</p> \n    <p>The talkative\
  \ guard led them off toward the manor, eyeing the rest of Vech's group with curiosity.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"You'd best get Dronsbech up to the house,\" Vech said. \"From\
  \ what I've learned, it's a credible threat.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What kind of assassin?\"\
  \ the guardsman asked.</p> \n    <p>\"A bowman,\" Lisette answered. </p> \n    <p>The\
  \ man frowned, then increased his pace and led them through a side door into the\
  \ manor house, where they threaded past a trio of servants bearing food-laden platters.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>The guard then introduced a frowning servant as Darvus, Dronbech's\
  \ seneschal, who informed them that the master was with some guests in the garden.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"But who are these?\" Darvus asked in a droning voice, indicating Lissette\
  \ and Karag with a slight gesture.</p> \n    <p>\"They need to see the master,\"\
  \ the guardsman answered. \"Shall I bring him?\"</p> \n    <p>Darvus's frown only\
  \ deepened, and his balding forehead creased: he was one long visage of disapproval.\
  \ \"This is quite irregular.\" He sighed. \"Very well; go find Master Dronsbech.\"\
  \ As the man hurried off, Darvus nodded to Vech. \"I suppose you can wait in the\
  \ master's office. Be so good as to follow me.\" He directed a dark look toward\
  \ the dwarf and stepped off the marble to a parquet floor, highly polished, and\
  \ then to an ornately carved oaken door. \"A moment,\" he instructed, then stepped\
  \ through into the darkened space to light a wall lamp and another on a desk. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Lisette entered, followed by the others, and saw then they stood within\
  \ a finely appointed space, complete with an expensive carpet of green and gold,\
  \ a wall-long bookshelf, a window overlooking what appeared to be a courtyard garden—\
  for Lisette could see walls beyond the flowers—and a mahogany desk with various\
  \ shiny knick-knacks. </p> \n    <p>Darvus stepped back from the desk lantern and\
  \ cleared his throat. \"Make yourselves comfortable.\" He pointed to leather upholstered\
  \ seats and regarded Lissette again, haughtily. \"Why is it that you're here, again?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Lisette returned the man's gaze. \"I have information that may help\
  \ your employer avoid considerable danger.\"</p> \n    <p>Darvus studied her for\
  \ a long moment, then considered each of them in turn before departing, pulling\
  \ the door shut behind him. It closed with a click.</p> \n    <p>Next to the door\
  \ was a wide, floor-length mirror that reflected the group: the dwarf, now studying\
  \ the view through the window; Culcumber, nervously considering the book spines;\
  \ and Vech, fingering his mustache with a look of disappointment, apparently noticing\
  \ that one side drooped further than the other. </p> \n    <p>Lisette stationed\
  \ herself near the mirror and waited for the sound of approaching steps. </p> \n\
  \    <p>Darvus opened the door and entered, reviewing the room before gesturing\
  \ with a sweeping motion. </p> \n    <p>Jhon Dronsbech entered behind him. The banker\
  \ was a tall man with a widow's peak and stooped shoulders, and he scowled at them\
  \ all from under high, supercilious brows. </p> \n    <p>He tapped his ivory-handled\
  \ cane and was opening his mouth to speak when Lisette snapped up her rifle and\
  \ fired.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>: Blood and explanations\
