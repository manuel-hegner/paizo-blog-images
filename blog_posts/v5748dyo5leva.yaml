  description\">Tantaerra hastily transferred her hands to just the bottom edge of\
  \ the crate-lid as she backed away—and the first slashing blows fell on it, numbingly\
  \ hard.</span></p> \n    <p>A few splinters flew, but the swift dark swords were\
  \ sharp, and the arms that drove them very strong. Steel sliced deep and caught,\
  \ binding in the wood.</p> \n    <p>The silent slayer shook its swords to free them.\
  \ Tantaerra let go of the lid before she was shaken dizzy and darted around behind\
  \ the huge stack of crates. Time to enact her clever plan.</p> \n    <p>She ran\
  \ right up the reaching pole and kicked out hard against the cellar wall, slamming\
  \ her back against the big stack of shield crates. She hit hard, readying herself\
  \ to leap clear of the avalanche as the crates overbalanced and came down on top\
  \ of her attacker.</p> \n    <p>Yet the big stack of shield-crates wavered not an\
  \ inch.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra cursed foully, then cursed even harder as she felt\
  \ swords biting into the far sides of the crates she was now clinging to. The manyswords\
  \ thing was hacking and hewing crates as high as it could reach, cleaving wood that\
  \ was a lot older and damper than the lid it had just flung aside; its blades were\
  \ through one crate-side already.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra climbed wood that shuddered\
  \ and groaned at each sword-blow, and was a crate higher when a sudden cacophony\
  \ of sliding metal announced the riven crate was abruptly spilling all of its shields.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Spilling them right onto the head of the manyswords monster, or automaton,\
  \ or golem, or whatever it was. The thing came staggering into view around the edge\
  \ of the stack. By then, Tantaerra was atop the uppermost crate and holding onto\
  \ one of the cellar ceiling beams, sneezing out dust.</p> \n    <p>The manyswords\
  \ thing regained its balance and determination, and charged back at the stack, hewing\
  \ at the next crate down.</p> \n    <p>Sparks and shrieks flew as metal struck metal,\
  \ and all too soon the deluge of rusting shields emptying out of a half-destroyed\
  \ crate rang out again—but this time, the weight of two full crates stacked atop\
  \ the two now-empty ones was too much, and Tantaerra's perch groaned, toppled, and\
  \ came down on the thing of swords with a thunderous roar.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra\
  \ rode the ponderous fall almost to the cellar floor, but sprang free at the last\
  \ moment to land in a dead run up the stairs.</p> \n    <p>She halted halfway up,\
  \ listening as the crash rebounded off the walls, ready to continue running at the\
  \ slightest stirring in the shield pile. Yet no new sounds interrupted the fading\
  \ echoes.</p> \n    <p>She turned and moved cautiously down again, halting two steps\
  \ from the bottom, peering into the cellar's half-light.</p> \n    <p>Nothing was\
  \ moving but eddying dust. Swords lay still here and there on the floor, and a few\
  \ corners of the cage-like apparition that had been their wielder could be seen\
  \ protruding from under a great heap of shattered crates and flakes of rust.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Stairs creaked as the Master moved down into the basement. \"Is it dead?\"\
  \ he asked.</p> \n    <p>\"Well and truly crushed,\" she responded.</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ shook his head, and they crossed the cellar together to peer at the fallen swords\
  \ and shields, then examined the coffin-like crate lying open and unscathed. The\
  \ lid had borne the \"Hroalund Only\" directive; the solid box was well used and\
  \ empty, and bore no other markings save the usual chalked street-carters' mark\
  \ that meant \"delivery fee paid.\"</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra looked again at the label\
  \ on the lid. Although its lettering was different than the label on the crate of\
  \ gorgets they'd received from Galdrake and Sarpent, the labels and glue were the\
  \ same.</p> \n    <p>\"Someone wants you dead,\" she told her master grimly, tugging\
  \ the rag from her face.</p> \n    <p>He looked angry, but said only, \"I believe\
  \ we both know who.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So what happens now?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I go\
  \ and do the work they've hired me for,\" the Master told her, his words flat and\
  \ hard. \"Argulk Hroalund doesn't run from threats.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Argulk Hroalund\
  \ <i>can't</i> run, these days,\" Tantaerra replied. \"From anything.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>The Master of the House of Blades gave her a scowl that lightened slowly\
  \ into a chuckle and a nod. \"You have the right of it, little one. And I see from\
  \ your face that you have an idea.\" He started for the stairs, and added over his\
  \ shoulder, \"Your ideas have never led me astray thus far, so...\"</p> \n    <p>When\
  \ she reached the head of the stair, he was holding out his belt-flask.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Drink,\" he ordered. \"You've earned it. Then talk.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>It was hot and cramped inside the box, even wearing only light\
  \ gauzy silks. Tantaerra had taken the hood off, and resolved to stay that way until\
  \ Hroalund was actually opening the catches. She wore a smoke suit: tight-fitting\
  \ breeches, slippers, a jerkin, and a full-head hood, all mottled gray to make the\
  \ wearer hard to see in mist, shadow, or dim surroundings. It was identical to the\
  \ sort favored by Molthuni scouts and sneak-thieves of all lands, and she was surprised\
  \ they'd been able to find one small enough to fit her—once the arms and legs were\
  \ doubled back on themselves, that is. Sometimes it proved useful to work in a shop\
  \ that sold war-gear.</p> \n    <p>Useful, but not precisely comfortable. She was\
  \ bumping and rumbling along on the House of Blades' freight cart, in a box that\
  \ had only two tiny air-holes where nails had gone \"missing\" (thanks to the Master's\
  \ prybar), and huddled on a bed of coiled cords inside a frame that held a tray\
  \ of the Master's smaller tools just above her nose. Her carrybag was across her\
  \ legs, reassuringly heavy. The traps Master Argulk Hroalund installed were almost\
  \ always activated by trip-cords or wires, and his working gear also included many\
  \ pulleys, hooks, ring-catches, hinged treadles, and the like. So the cart held\
  \ no less than six boxes—because Garldrake and Sarpent could afford the best, and\
  \ wanted it.</p> \n    <p>The holes were too small for Tantaerra to see the splendid\
  \ carved sign that proclaimed \"Garldrake and Sarpent/Arms and Armor For All,\"\
  \ but as she was carried through its doors—double doors!—she could tell that it\
  \ was brighter and roomier than the House of Blades.</p> \n    <p>She did catch\
  \ a glimpse of the fabled polished copper ceiling. The Master had spoken scornfully\
  \ of that particular addition to the main showroom of what was increasingly his\
  \ chief rival in Canorate. Sheets of copper that were polished nightly, there to\
  \ make everything grander and brighter, reflecting everything on display and showing\
  \ the counter staff what patrons were up to in every back corner and aisle. Ornamental\
  \ pillars and moldings had been added everywhere, and doors turned into tall archways,\
  \ to make the premises appear much grander.</p> \n    <p>The prices had soared,\
  \ of course, but unlike the Master, Garldrake and Sarpent were happy to charge extra\
  \ for their fancy show room. And it had worked—not only had they retained most of\
  \ their patrons, they had gained some new ones; foolish nobles who judged a smith\
  \ on the beauty of his store rather than the quality of his steel.</p> \n    <p>Where\
  \ the House of Blades was crammed with knives, knives, and more knives, Garldrake\
  \ and Sarpent had lots of empty space, and lone suits of armor standing on their\
  \ own in gleaming displays. The shop still carried far more wares than the Master\
  \ did, but most of them were on shelves filling room after room opening off the\
  \ showroom.</p> \n    <p>You could do that, the Master had said a trifle enviously,\
  \ if you'd taken over the next-door shops on both sides, and had coin enough to\
  \ swallow more. Over the last eight years, Garldrake and Sarpent had gone from strength\
  \ to strength, buying out many—no, most, by now—competitors. They were <i>the</i>\
  \ purveyors of armor and weaponry to Molthuni of wealth and discernment.</p> \n\
  \    <p>And welcome to it, she'd often heard the Master say, but from time to time\
  \ he'd sounded wistful while saying it. The rest of the time, he sounded merely\
  \ bitter.</p> \n    <p>\"Well, well, Master Hroalund! I am <i>most</i> pleased to\
  \ see you!\"</p> \n    <p>To Tantaerra, Loryn Garldrake sounded more astonished\
  \ than pleased. That confirmed her suspicions: that the manyswords thing in the\
  \ coffin had been expected to kill him, and this prearranged hiring to outfit their\
  \ store with traps was an alibi—for who would kill the best trap-fitter <i>before</i>\
  \ he did his work for you?</p> \n    <p>\"Welcome, welcome!\" Garldrake went on,\
  \ more heartily. \"And you've brought all your, ah, fixings and fittings, I see!\
  \ Can you have it all done today, d'you think?\"</p> \n    <p>Loryn Garldrake was\
  \ one of those who could melt butter on his tongue, jovially and heartily. Probably\
  \ until the instant he thought you were crossing him, and then—watch out.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I fear not,\" the Master replied gently. \"I could if you closed your\
  \ doors, but your partner was most firm that the shop—\"</p> \n    <p>\"<i>Establishment</i>,\
  \ please!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ah, pray pardon—the establishment should stay open, and\
  \ that one room at a time would be curtained off as I worked. Here's the chart we\
  \ agreed upon; please let me know if there are any changes you'd like, or...\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"No, no,\" Garldrake spoke slowly, his voice sharp and shrewd. No doubt\
  \ he was studying the chart. \"No, this is all in order. You're the best, Master\
  \ Hroalund, and the best is what we want. You'll start at the back, then?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p> \n    <p>\"My lads will carry your boxes through. Six, aren't\
  \ there?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Six and my little satchel, here,\" the Master replied\
  \ agreeably. \"My thanks. The curtains? Ah, good, good...\"</p> \n    <p>A few bumpy\
  \ moments later, Tantaerra felt her box being set down. With care, thank the gods.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"No, leave them closed, thank you,\" the Master said firmly. \"I'll\
  \ open them as I need them. Until then, less clutter, and easier to move if a patron\
  \ needs something I'm in front of. <i>Thank you</i>.\"</p> \n    <p>There were murmurs\
  \ from Garldrake's shop workers, booted feet shuffling away, and then the familiar\
  \ clinks and clanks of the Master getting out tools and starting to hum softly to\
  \ himself.</p> \n    <p>Though Garldrake and Sarpent ran to nothing so common as\
  \ a shop-bell to announce the front doors opening, Tantaerra didn't have to see\
  \ to know the shop was busy. The hubbub of many voices never stopped, not a few\
  \ of the nearest inquiring what was behind the curtains. Hastening feet fetched\
  \ things from nearby shelves on more occasions than she could count. It made the\
  \ pace in the House of Blades seem one step from the grave, by comparison.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Abruptly the catches on her hiding place were thrown back. She only just\
  \ had time to tug on her hood before the Master was dragging her out by an elbow\
  \ and murmuring, \"<i>Now</i>.\"</p> \n    <p>After the dimness of the box, the\
  \ light even in this back room seemed nigh-blinding, but she was out in it for barely\
  \ long enough to snatch two quick breaths before being plunged into darkness again—\
  dustier and faintly moldy darkness this time, with a cool draft.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ Master had bundled her into the Garldrake and Sarpent dumbwaiter—or rather, atop\
  \ the box that traveled up and down the shaft on furry-with-dust but well-oiled\
  \ cables. Easily done by hauling on cables and thrusting a foot down into the box,\
  \ when all one needed was enough space for a lithe halfling to pop through. Tantaerra\
  \ checked that her carrybag was leashed securely to her wrist; it was heavy with\
  \ trap-guns, triplines, and cork-guarded darts coated with poison that brought swift\
  \ and deep slumber to those they stung.</p> \n    <p>She was here to spend the night,\
  \ peering and hearing as she stayed unseen. Riding the top of the dumbwaiter, or\
  \ climbing its ropes to get higher, the better to spy.</p> \n    <p>Being discovered\
  \ would bring almost certain death, because the Master had a pretty fair idea of\
  \ what Garldrake and Sarpent were up to: cheating the rulers of Molthune by providing\
  \ inferior armor and weaponry—like those gorgets—and undercutting competitors' prices,\
  \ driving said rivals into business failure or forcing them to sell out to Garldrake\
  \ and Sarpent. No doubt they knew that Master Hroalund would never willingly hand\
  \ over his shop, and had decided it would be easier to acquire his share of the\
  \ market after his untimely death. </p> \n    <p>They had to know they'd be found\
  \ out eventually, but obviously planned to make their fortunes first, and probably\
  \ buy merchant ships and buildings in the heart of bustling cities in other lands,\
  \ so they could leave Molthune in haste and still keep some wealth. Or perhaps they'd\
  \ simply quietly pay off the injured parties whenever their shoddy quality was discovered—\
  and in the meantime, grow to dominate Molthune's arms and armor trade, and heap\
  \ up coins as high as they could.</p> \n    <p>A fine plan in theory. Yet if Tantaerra\
  \ could discover evidence of it, Hroalund could easily use that knowledge to expose\
  \ them—or perhaps simply hold it over them, using it to secure his own safety.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Safety—and more than a little gold, if Tantaerra had her way. For anything\
  \ that threatened Master Hroalund also threatened his slave. And no one threatened\
  \ Tantaerra and got away cheaply...</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Like Tantaerra\
