  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, February 18, 2010</p> \n   <p>This week Paizo\
  \ posted new product descriptions for dozens of products to be released in the third\
  \ trimester of 2010, including new hardcover books, a revision of the Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting, and a brand new line of Pathfinder novels!</p> \n   <p>We've\
  \ been hard at work on these items for months, and even though you'll have to wait\
  \ until at least September before they hit your game table, we're thrilled to finally\
  \ be able to discuss some of this stuff in public. The suspense has been killing\
  \ us!</p> \n   <p>Folks are already discussing some of our new releases on the <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizo/products\"><b>paizo.com</b> messageboards</a>,\
  \ but as the commentary has been flying fast and furious over the last couple days,\
  \ I figured it might be helpful to post a broad overview of our new offerings here\
  \ on the blog, with direct links to the products in question.</p> \n   <p>So without\
  \ further ado, let's plug ourselves into the future-caster time machine and take\
  \ a journey forward to September through December 2010. Bring your dice and a few\
  \ character sheets. You're going to need them!</p> \n   <p><b>PATHFINDER FICTION</b><br>\
  \ The biggest announcement is a brand new line of Pathfinder novels written by some\
  \ of the biggest names in fantasy fiction! The first book, <a href=\"/pathfinder/fiction/v5748btpy8ddr\"\
  ><i>Winter Witch</i></a>, by <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Elaine Cunningham,\
  \ explores the tale of a barbarian shield maiden who ventures from Varisia to the\
  \ winter-locked land of Irrisen to rescue a possessed sisterâ€”and the canny young\
  \ cartographer who follows her into that haunted land. The book formally releases\
  \ in September, but we'll have copies on hand at this year's Gen Con Game Fair as\
  \ a special preview. October sees the release of <a href=\"/pathfinder/fiction/v5748btpy8dds\"\
  ><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a>, by former <i>Amazing Stories</i> and <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ editor Dave Gross, which revisits the Pathfinder agent Varian Jeggare and his\
  \ tiefling assistant Radovan, last seen in the Pathfinder Journal section of the\
  \ Council of Thieves Adventure Path. Additional novels will follow in 2011 from\
  \ well-known authors including Paul S. Kemp and other familiar faces. Stay tuned\
  \ for more info!</p> \n   <p><b>NEW HARDCOVERS</b><br> Following up on the forthcoming\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88rc\"><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a> and <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b6g\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>, 2010 will see\
  \ the release of one more hardcover rulebook in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\
  \ line: <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ddb\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i></a>!\
  \ Like the first <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8auu\"><i>Bestiary</i></a>, <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ddb\"><i>Bestiary 2</i></a> will include more\
  \ than 300 monsters for use with the Pathfinder RPG, including old favorites like\
  \ the hippogriff and new planar creatures like the aeons and proteans. This book\
  \ will cover most of the standard monsters from the history of the game that we\
  \ couldn't fit in the first <i>Bestiary</i>, as well as tons of other great monsters\
  \ you've never seen before. Each monster will receive a full page or a 2-page spread,\
  \ using the same format as the original book.</p> \n   <p>Supplies of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy84eo\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a>\
  \ hardcover are dwindling faster than we can count, so in September we'll release\
  \ a revised edition in the form of the <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8dd7\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting World Guide: The Inner Sea</i></a>. Fully updated\
  \ to the Pathfinder RPG rules and with expanded coverage of nearly every nation,\
  \ the latest version of this book contains a new cover from Wayne Reynolds, an updated\
  \ map, fixed errata from the first edition, and more than 300 pages packed with\
  \ tons of information about the lands, peoples, beliefs, and cultures of the world\
  \ of Golarion. Paizo Creative Director James Jacobs is giving this project his personal\
  \ finish, making sure our campaign setting book is a solid bedrock of our publishing\
  \ operation for years to come. We're really pleased with the early development of\
  \ this book, and think it will be an ideal resource for all Pathfinder players and\
  \ game masters.</p> \n   <p><b>PATHFINDER CHRONICLES</b><br> In addition to the\
  \ revised campaign setting, in late 2010 we'll release the <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8dd9\"\
  ><i>Inner Sea Map Folio</i></a>, a massive 32-panel map of the Inner Sea region\
  \ containing all \"canonical\" locations from every Pathfinder product published\
  \ to date! This monster is sure to brighten up the gaming room or man-cave of any\
  \ Pathfinder enthusiast, and its \"four poster\" format will even allow for easy\
  \ reference at the game table for those lacking the wall space to do it justice.\
  \ The Campaign Setting product line will also see a new Classic Monsters-style book\
  \ in the form of <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8dd8\"><i>Misfit Monsters\
  \ Redeemed</i></a> (and you won't believe what that's about until you read the description,\
  \ believe me) as well as <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8dda\"><i>Lost\
  \ Cities of Golarion</i></a>, which explores six adventure locales from throughout\
  \ the world of Golarion.</p> <b>PATHFINDER PLAYER COMPANION</b>\n   <br> We can't\
  \ let the GMs have all the fun, after all, so we've also planned a couple of sure-fire\
  \ player's guides for the last third of 2010 that will be must-buys for Pathfinder\
  \ RPG players. October sees the release of the <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/v5748btpy8ddm\"\
  ><i>Inner Sea Primer</i></a>, a slimmed-down overview of the Pathfinder world designed\
  \ specifically for players. This book will include tons of new character traits\
  \ tied to the regions and religions of Golarion, and will provide a perfect \"gist\"\
  \ of the setting for those looking to dip a toe in the water without needing to\
  \ buy a big hardcover book. December sees the release of <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/v5748btpy8ddn\"\
  ><i>Halflings of Golarion</i></a>, which rounds out the player's guides to the standard\
  \ \"demihuman\" player character races in the Pathfinder RPG with plenty of details\
  \ on how to integrate them into Golarion campaigns. Lots of fun equipment and lore\
  \ in this one for fans of halflings (and everyone else, too)!\n   <p></p> <b>PATHFINDER\
  \ MODULES</b>\n   <br> \n   <p>Gamers have been asking for a high-level Pathfinder\
  \ adventure since the very beginning, and now I'm pleased to report that the time\
  \ has come at last! Shipping in September, <a href=\"/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8ddg\"\
  ><i>The Witchwar Legacy</i></a> takes 17th-level player characters to the snow-shrouded\
  \ witch kingdom of Irrisen to thwart a plan by the Ice Queen involving the insidious\
  \ Baba Yaga herself! If that's not enough, in November we'll release a brand-new\
  \ 1st-level starter adventure called <a href=\"/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8ddh\"\
  ><i>The Godsmouth Heresy</i></a>, set in the shadowy city of Kaer Maga, site of\
  \ June's <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8b7r\"><i>City of Strangers</i></a>\
  \ sourcebook!</p> \n   <p><b>GAMEMASTERY ACCESSORIES</b><br> Paizo's popular map\
  \ products keep on coming in the last part of 2010, including the first-ever crossover\
  \ between the Map Pack and Flip-Mat lines! Everything starts innocently enough in\
  \ September with the release of <a href=\"/gameMastery/maps/v5748btpy8ddi\"><i>Flip-Mat:\
  \ Forest</i></a>, but things really get interesting in October, with <a href=\"\
  /gameMastery/maps/v5748btpy8ddo\"><i>Map Pack: Shops</i></a>. This 18-tile map set\
  \ includes the interiors for several different stores, apothecaries, taverns, and\
  \ the like, but things become super-special when you combine this pack with November's\
  \ <a href=\"/gameMastery/maps/v5748btpy8ddj\"><i>Flip-Mat: City Streets</i></a>,\
  \ which details a mercantile district suitable for use with other city Flip-Mats.\
  \ The roofed buildings on this Flip-Mat (suitable for rooftop chases) correspond\
  \ exactly to the interiors presented in <a href=\"/gameMastery/maps/v5748btpy8ddo\"\
  ><i>Map Pack: Shops</i></a>, providing a uniquely immersive tabletop experience.\
  \ And if that's not enough to impress your jaded players, spring December's <a href=\"\
  /gameMastery/maps/v5748btpy8ddp\"><i>Map Pack: Ambush Sites</i></a> on them. They\
  \ probably deserve it.</p> \n   <p>GameMastery Cards keep coming as well, this time\
  \ in the form of new <a href=\"/gameMastery/itemPacks/v5748btpy8ddq\"><i>GameMastery\
  \ Condition Cards</i></a>, handy reference cards for all of the various conditions\
  \ in the Pathfinder RPG rules.</p> \n   <p><b>PATHFINDER ADVENTURE PATH</b><br>\
  \ And, of course, we haven't forgotten the date that brought us to the big dance\
  \ in the first place. The last trimester of 2010 will see plenty of action in the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Path line, as the Serpent's Skull Adventure Path takes a\
  \ jungle trail toward its stunning conclusion! Ruined Azlanti cities, Red Mantis\
  \ assassins, monkey-men, the Pathfinder Society, ancient serpentfolk, and one very,\
  \ very angry Gorilla King are all in store in a quartet of adventures by <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/v5748btpy8ddc\">Tim Hitchcock</a>, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/v5748btpy8ddd\"\
  >Kevin Kulp</a>, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/v5748btpy8dde\">Greg A. Vaughan</a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/v5748btpy8ddf \">Graeme Davis</a>! The\
  \ Serpent's Skull is a return to classic-style adventuring in the Pathfinder tradition,\
  \ and we can't wait to get you guys into the jungle!</p> \n   <p>I'm saving our\
  \ Planet Stories releases for tomorrow's blog, so be sure to tune in then for some\
  \ of the biggest Planet Stories news we've had yet!</p> \n   <p>So much is happening\
  \ here at Paizo these days that it's difficult to remember the uncertainty and horror\
  \ of the last few years, with major changes to our business, our game system, and\
  \ our lives. All of us really appreciate the support you have shown us so far, and\
  \ we look forward to more exciting products in the months and years to come!</p>\
