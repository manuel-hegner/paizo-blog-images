  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Get ready to reboot your\
  \ spell caches with Starfinder Galactic Magic! This exciting new supplement dives\
  \ into the most magical parts of the science-fantasy Starfinder setting, with a\
  \ new class, a wealth of class options, dozens of new spells, and articles on how\
  \ magic and religion affect day-to-day living in the Pact Worlds and beyond. Of\
  \ course, none of this would be possible without our talented authors! Let’s learn\
  \ a little more about some of them and what they worked on for this book in their\
  \ own words. And if you’re a new (or returning) fan of any of these authors, be\
  \ sure to check out their other projects, websites, livestreams, and more!</p> \n\

  \ 15;\">Creative Director</em></h3> \n      <p>I’ve had the good fortune to write\
  \ a lot for Pathfinder and helped to invent a fair portion of its deities, but always\
  \ in the context of the fantasy genre. The chance to revisit some of these elements\
  \ in a different genre is exciting and liberating. after spending decades with deities\
  \ like Desna and Sarenrae flitting around in my head as divinities first in my homebrew\
  \ game and then more recently in Golarion. Alas, there was only so much room to\
  \ talk about Desnan dream stations or to explore the implications of what worshiping\
  \ the goddess of the sun might entail when you’re in outer space, but hopefully\
  \ the entries in this book will help spark new ideas for how to use these deities\
  \ in your game! And of course, on the opposite side of the “friendliness scale,”\
  \ being able to lean into the science-fiction tropes of the classic pulps and explore\
  \ how Nyarlathotep and the Elder Mythos functions in Starfinder was equally delightful.\
  \ But the thing I’m most excited to see once this book’s out is all the amazing\
  \ content created by all the other authors in this book!</p> \n      <br> \n   \
  \   <h3>Jessica Catalan (she/her)<br> <em style=\"font-size: 15;\">Starfinder Society\
  \ Developer</em></h3> \n      <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder\
  \ Society Developer. I’m also a mother, gamer, blogger, and freelance author who\
  \ primarily writes for Paizo’s Starfinder and Pathfinder RPGs. You can find a list\
  \ of my currently announced writing credits on my Paizo profile (meloriel). Some\
  \ recently released highlights include <em>Secrets of Magic, Guns &amp; Gears, Lost\
  \ Omens Grand Bazaar, Galaxy Exploration Manual,</em> and <em>Tech Revolution</em>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For <em>Galactic Magic</em>, I wrote the mystic and witchwarper class\
  \ options, twenty spells, and numerous deities, including Kadrical, Lamashtu, and\
  \ all the ancestral deities. <em>Galactic Magic</em> also marks two big firsts for\
  \ me. This is the first time I was hired to create entirely new deities of my own\
  \ design (Dagosarn, Flux, Isvith, Jalvari, Meyel, Romgul, Uvonn, and the Vesk Saints).\
  \ <em>Galactic Magic</em> is also the first time I was hired for freelance development\
  \ work, making this my very first developer credit.</p> \n      <p>I’m beyond thrilled\
  \ to have been a part of this book and I look forward to seeing it hit gaming tables!\
  \ Enjoy!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them or xe/xem)</h3> \n\
  \      <p>I'm a sometimes-poet, sometimes-game designer doing my best to make engaging,\
  \ inclusive tabletop games. In <em>Galactic Magic</em>, you'll find my work in the\
  \ technomancer and Oras section. When I was writing the Oras section, I thought\
  \ quite a bit about Donna Haraway's \"A Cyborg Manifesto\" and the way in which\
  \ cyborgs offer a rejection of the separations between animal, human and machine.\
  \ This should probably tell you that I'm a queer theory nerd (which is the crux\
  \ of my academic background) and that I love thinking about alternative ways of\
  \ being through TTRPGs. While <em>Galactic Magic</em> is my first hardcover with\
  \ Paizo, you'll find my name on more books soon and can enjoy more of my Starfinder\
  \ work with <em>SFS #3-07: Strike at Zone 78</em> and <em>SFS #4-04: Mission Not\
  \ Found</em>.</p> \n      <p>You can find me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slothscout\"\
  >@slothscout</a>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Hello, all! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I’ve been freelancing for\
  \ Pathfinder and Starfinder for about six years. You might remember me from this\
  \ year’s Starfinder GenCon special, <em>#3-99: Perils of the Past</em>. I’m delighted\
  \ to have been a part of <em>Galactic Magic</em>, helping give the “fantasy” side\
  \ of “science-fantasy” some love. I did several sections for the book, including\
  \ the faith introduction, the Besmara and Weydan entries, the Parallel Truths, and\
  \ the new operative class options. I’ve always been fond of exploring how magic\
  \ and faith interact with a highly technologically advanced setting, so this assignment\
  \ was a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed crafting the operative options, which\
  \ hopefully add a little magical flair to your operative of choice!</p> \n     \
  \ <p>I’ve got a few more Pathfinder and Starfinder projects in the works currently,\
  \ though most of them are still Forbidden Knowledge at this point. I can confirm,\
  \ though, that I got my grabby hands involved in Pathfinder’s upcoming <em>Book\
  \ of the Dead</em>! In my non-freelancing downtime, I can be found hanging out with\
  \ a book or video game—usually Animal Crossing these days—or pretending I know how\
  \ to bake. You can find a full list of my writing credits at klspeedling.com and\
  \ I’m on Twitter as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KendraLS\">@KendraLS</a>, where\
  \ I sporadically post cat pictures.</p> \n      <br> \n      <table class=\"image\"\

  \ others. (See my carrd for the full list: <a href=\"https://senhhs.carrd.co/#portfolio\"\
  >https://senhhs.carrd.co/#portfolio</a>) With <em>Galactic Magic</em>, it looks\
  \ like I've made the jump over to write even more magic in a different(?) universe.\
  \ This book has been a long time coming, and I hope you'll get to experience the\
  \ magic (pun intended) within its pages soon. You can always find out what I'm up\
  \ to on my Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenHHS\">@SenHHS</a>. If my calculations\
  \ are correct, you might get to witness me tweeting about \"trace analysis in Golarion\"\

  \   <h3>Shay Snow (they/them)</h3> \n      <p>Hi, I'm Shay Snow, I'm an editor at\
  \ Paizo, and I wrote up a bunch of species-specific spells and the entry on Zon-Kuthon,\
  \ surprising exactly... no one! As my mutuals on Twitter know I'm a pretty big Zon-Kuthon\
  \ fan so I joyfully jumped when offered the chance to give the pain man a new write\
  \ up for <em>Galactic Magic</em>. You may have seen me in a few Starfinder scenarios,\
  \ Pathfinder’s <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> and <em>Tech Revolution</em> and\
  \ I have a few things coming out in <em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth.</em> Additionally,\
  \ you can find my name on a few <em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em> projects!</p> \n    \
  \  <p>When not writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on\
  \ my Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpellsInSugar\">@SpellsInSuga</a>r, where\
  \ you can also sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media. You\
  \ can keep up with my work, or even contact me for hire, through my website <a href=\"\

  \ Redekop (she/they/he)</h3> \n      <p>Hi! I'm Jess, and I wrote about some fabulous\
  \ outsider deities in <em>Galactic Magic</em> ! Even though it's a smaller section,\
  \ I'm particularly proud of my work in this book. It gave me an opportunity to introduce\
  \ a lot of cool content into Starfinder, and there are some lines scattered through\
  \ the section that are quite personal to me. I won't spoil which gods are included,\
  \ but if you're familiar with my past work for PF and SF, some of them are very\
  \ \"me.\" :) I hope you like Starfinder's new and returning outsider deities as\
  \ much as I do!</p> \n      <p>For more of my content check out Valiant, an actual\
  \ play Pathfinder podcast on the Know Direction network, where I play Xiadani the\
  \ aasimar druid. You can also find me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tectonomancer\"\
  >@tectonomancer</a> on Twitter.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>дравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun,\
  \ and you may recognize me from previous Starfinder products such as the <em>Galaxy\
  \ Exploration Manual</em> (where I wrote about Accord and created the Starship Toolbox)\
  \ and <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #31: Waking the Worldseed</em> (where I wrote\
  \ the Hibb article), along with plenty of Pathfinder stuff. In my more mundane life,\
  \ I’m a Russian-American historian, educator, and author.</p> \n      <p><em>Galactic\
  \ Magic</em> was a bit of a weird project for me. John Compton contacted me and\
  \ said ‘we need magical nanomachines and we need them as soon as humanly possible.’\
  \ Well, I’m never one to shirk from a challenge, and produced the magical options\
  \ for the nanocyte in basically a weekend. I’m reasonably pleased with the results,\
  \ especially the ability to make fancy nano-runes and sigils like a proper anime\
  \ protagonist. (That was what John wanted, right?)</p> \n      <p>Nanites are also\
  \ of some interest to me for other reasons, as when not writing for Paizo, I’m working\
  \ on <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> alongside the inimitable Andrew\
  \ Mullen and Isabelle Thorne (follow us at https://twitter.com/LuminantA). I shan’\
  t share too much in the way of details, but let’s just say that fans of microscopic\
  \ shenanigans may find our upcoming release, <em>Armaments of the Luminant Age</em>,\
  \ of some interest to them.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Hi everyone! My name is John Godek and I am an avid Starfinder GM,\
  \ player, freelance author, and podcaster. I had the opportunity to write several\
  \ sections of <em>Galactic Magic</em> and I can’t wait for you to see them! I created\
  \ two brand new soldier fighting styles—the spellbrawler and the archer—along with\
  \ new weapons, gear boosts, fusions, and armor upgrades that synergize with these\
  \ styles as well as offer cool options for other styles and classes. In addition,\
  \ I formulated nearly three dozen new magic spells, including spells that provide\
  \ basic utility, create different types of barriers, and are related to or originated\
  \ in the Vast. Finally, I crafted three new legendary artifacts of tremendous power,\
  \ each steeped in ancient lore. Other Paizo projects I have forthcoming include\
  \ work on the Drift Crisis hardcover, backmatter in <em>Starfinder Adventure Path\
  \ #44</em>, and my very first adventure—<em>Starfinder Bounty #1: The Cantina Job</em>!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>You can find me playing with the Emerald City Lodge in Seattle, or\
  \ you can listen to my podcasts on the Know Direction Network, including: Digital\
  \ Divination with Ron Lundeen, Intrepid Heroes, a Stafinder actual play, and Presenting,\
  \ a podcast where I interview game designers, developers, artists, and writers.</p>\

  \ The Mwangi Expanse</em> and the memetic zenith from <em>Starfinder Adventure Path\
  \ #24: The God-Host Ascends</em>. The best part about writing for this book has\
  \ been visualizing the awesome abilities I’ve always wished my character could have\
  \ and getting the opportunity to share that vision with the rest of the community.</p>\

  \ \n      <h3>Dennis Muldoon (he/him)</h3> \n      <p>Hi folks! My name is Dennis\
  \ Muldoon, and I've been freelancing for Paizo for a few years now. I've contributed\
  \ to almost every line Paizo publishes, now, most recently <em>SFS #4-10: The Way\
  \ In</em>, the Azlanti Space Age material in the toolbox of <em>Starfinder Adventure\
  \ Path #42: Whispers of the Eclipse</em>, and the ssumzili and golgopo monsters\
  \ in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #171: Hurricane's Howl</em>. For Galactic Magic,\
  \ I wrote the experimental apparatus mechanic alternate class feature for all your\
  \ magically inclined mechanic needs, along with magic-themed mechanic tricks for\
  \ mechanics of all types. I'm also extremely excited to bring the Lucky Drunk himself\
  \ into Starfinder with a section on Cayden Cailean! My full list of credits is on\

  \ <p>Hey, Starfinder fans! I’m Kate, and I’ve been writing for Starfinder and Pathfinder\
  \ for about five years. I was delighted to get to write the sections on Hylax and\
  \ Talavet for this book. Hylax is near and dear to my heart after writing one of\
  \ the Attack of the Swarm volumes, and I even have a tattoo of the <em>Crown of\
  \ Hylax</em>! Talavet speaks to me equally, with such a strong focus on the importance\
  \ of stories, something I’ve never appreciated more than in the last year and a\
  \ half. I hope you enjoy reading about their role in the galaxy, along with the\
  \ many other deities featured in this book.</p> \n      <p>Follow me at <a href=\"\
