                <p itemprop="description">Hello everyone! It's your friendly cyber-neighborhood Venture Captain Tyler again, bringing you a quick discussion about the options that we have as players in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. (Note the new branding!). First I'll talk about the stunning number of characters you can choose from, and then I'll talk about the mindboggling amount of content there is to play through.</p> 
                <p> We have a LOT of character options now. So many that I found it a daunting task when I started typing all of them out. So, instead, I decided to do something a bit more fun… I made a graph! (Yes, I'm a huge nerd, we all are, deal with it!)</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190701-unlocksfull.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190628-unlocks_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p>Click on the image for a larger, more readable version!</p>
                </div> 
                <p>There are a total of 32 class decks and 162 characters you can play in PACS! (I'm counting Aric and the Red Raven as one playable character even though they have 2 character cards.) In the graph, I've listed the characters in the format "Name (Deck or Box)" in order to distinguish where they came from. I've also listed some specific scenarios, adventures, or other means of unlocking certain decks for certain characters. Altogether, the decks, characters, and means of unlocks make up the nodes of the graph. </p> 
                <p> The edges of the graph represent the way in which a character is available for any given deck. Most of these are yellow arrows with the word "Free" on the label. This means that you can use this character with the associated deck without any additional requirement. Obviously, you can use, the monk Rooboo with the the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9hvy"><em>Monk Class Deck</em></a> she came in. But the PACS Guide also says you can swap any character with any other character of the same class. For example, the Pathfinder Tales deck includes the wizard Varian, so you can replace him with any of the other 9 PACG wizards: Varian from Curse of the Crimson Throne; Darago, Ezren, Melindra, or Radillo from the Wizard Class Deck; Nyctessa from Hell's Vengeance 2; or Ezren from RotR, Mummy's Mask, or the Core Set. (The Tales deck also gives you free access to 9 rogues and 8 sorcerers—that's 27 "Free" characters to choose from!) </p> 
                <p> The new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes"><em>We Be Heroes?</em> Free RPG Day adventure</a> includes 4 new goblin characters: Crimsi the ranger, Grenek the barbarian, Pizazz the bard, and Siathorn the druid. The rule I described above means they can be played with the Class Deck corresponding to their respective classes, but thanks to a table on page 8 of the most recent PACS Guide, they can also be played with the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight! Character Deck</em></a> (Crimsi and Grenek) or <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn! Character Deck</em></a> (Pizazz and Siathorn). Looking at the graph, you'll notice another connection for Crimsi: the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9sxh"><em>Hunter Class Deck</em></a>. This is thanks to a beautifully written adventure reward from Season of Factions' Favor Adventure 4: "Each player unlocks the ability to play all characters that have the Ranger trait using the Hunter Class Deck." This is one of several character unlocks that are achieved through completing specific sets of scenarios, with the best example of these being my buddy Mavaro from Mummy's Mask, who can be played with a total of FIVE different decks, four of them through adventure completion unlocks. These unlocks are represented on the graph by maroon or orange nodes with names in the format "S4A4" for Season 4 Adventure 4, or "S5-5E" for Season 5 Scenario 5E. </p> 
                <p> There are four new characters in the <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em> adventure path, three of whom don't have a matching Class Deck. But fear not! Page 9 of the PACS Guide gives us decks for these characters, with Kess the Brawler using the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9e8d"><em>Barbarian Class Deck</em></a>, Quinn the Investigator using the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x03"><em>Ultimate Equipment Add-on Deck</em></a>, and Hakon the Skald using the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9pl6"><em>Warpriest Class Deck</em></a>. (Crimson Throne's other character, Varian the Wizard, starts off with <em>three</em> deck options—Wizard, Tales, and Hell's Vengeance 2—so he's versatile from day one.) And don't forget that you can add an Ultimate Add-On Deck to a Class Deck or Character Deck, or add a Class Deck or Character Deck to an Ultimate Add-On Deck (as described on page 8 of the PACS Guide), giving you loads of choices for your card upgrades! </p> 
                <p> There's one more character on the graph that I'd like to specifically point out: Arueshalae from the Wrath of the Righteous base set. Arueshalae—or Aruey, as I like to call her <em>(please don't tell her that)</em>—was unlocked way back in season 1 for a few lucky convention-goers who were able to pick up a specific convention boon. It allowed them to use her with the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy97id"><em>Rogue Class Deck</em></a>—but only in Season of the Righteous. Now, however, there is a new way to unlock our succubus friend, and play her in any scenario! </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190628-aruey.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190628-aruey_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">My friend Aruey, always willing to help out her friends... and smite some serious demon butt.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9g8v?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-13-Lexicon-of-Paradox"><em>Season of the Righteous Adventure</em> 3 PDF</a> was updated recently: the reward for that adventure now unlocks Arueshalae with the Hell's Vengeance 2 deck. This reward is retroactive, so if you have completed all 4 scenarios of <em>Season of the Righteous Adventure 3: Lexicon of Paradox</em>, you have already earned the following reward: </p> 
                <p><span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; text-align: left; padding: 2px 5px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;"> Each player unlocks the ability to play Arueshalae from the<em> Wrath of the Righteous Demon's Heresy Adventure Deck</em> using the <em>Hell's Vengeance 2 Character Deck</em>. When Arueshalae is Tier 3 or higher, you may add the loot cards Spherewalker Staff, Starbow, and Swallowtail Bracers to your Class Deck box.</span> <br style="clear: all;"> </p> 
                <p> A huge number of players just gained a new character to play... and she's quite the character, with a cohort and several Owner boons coming along with her. I recommend adding the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9vmz"><em>Ultimate Combat Add-On Deck</em></a> when playing with her, for maximum arrow-based destruction! </p> 
                <p> I know a lot of our players out there are concerned with compatibility of the old class decks with the new <em>Core</em> and <em>Curse</em> cards. The folks at Lone Shark and Paizo have heard you, and they've been hard at work on some creative solutions. Make sure you check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/cardgame/conversion">Conversion Guide</a>, especially the Characters and Roles section. </p> 
                <p> Also, <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42kvo?Guide-60-released#2">Vic recently made a post</a> that gives us an option for trying out some new cards in our class decks, letting you swap any class deck card for any Core or Curse card that has the same name! You'll need to own copies of these cards, and you'll need to come up with innovative ways to make sure your cards don't end up mixed up with those of the box that you're using to play (I recommend a small sliver of colored Post-It Note stuck to your cards). Or, you can play online with us over in the <a href="https://paizo.com/campaigns/PFSACGFlaxseedOnDeckAdventureCardGuildLodge/recruiting&amp;page=last">Flaxseed On Deck play-by-post lodge</a>, where your cards will never get mixed up because they're digital! </p>

But you'd be wrong! Here are the currently available adventures for PACS play: </p> 
                <p> </p>

                </ul> 
                <p></p> 
                <p> That's around double the content that has been released in regular Adventure Path form! The last of these, released just this month, is a four-scenario adventure written by David Jacobson and myself, outlined and developed by Linda Zayas-Palmer, with rules text from Keith Richmond. Working on this was a blast, particularly since it let us draw inspiration from David's and my fan-made Adventure Card Game adventures that we've run at PaizoCon the past several years, including our own take on <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk9g"><em>Season of the Kobolds</em></a>. </p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <p> Up next is Year 6: Year of Rotting Ruin (Uses Core and Curse; 6 adventures, Tiers 1–6)—the first adventure drops at Gen Con on August 1! </p> 
                <p> And it doesn't even stop there! <em>The Dragon's Demand</em>, <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>, and <em>We Be Heroes?</em> have also been sanctioned for PACS play. Each product page below includes a link to a sanctioning document that details the changes that need to be made for PACS play: </p> 
                <p> </p>
                <ul> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set"><em>Core Set: The Dragon's Demand</em></a> (Core and optionally any AP; 3 adventures; Tiers 1–3–but with unlimited replay at Tiers 1–6 for the random scenario, effectively giving you an <em>endless supply</em> of fresh PACS scenarios!) </li> 
                 <li> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> (6 adventures with 1 bonus scenario; Tiers 1-6) </li> 
                 <li> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes"><em>We Be Heroes?</em></a> (1 adventure, Tier 1) </li> 
                </ul> 
                <p></p> 
                <p> In addition, Linda announced at PaizoCon that we will soon be seeing some standalone PACS adventures that can be played at several different tiers, so stay tuned for more news on that front. There are so many new options for play, my head is spinning! </p> 
                <p> That's it for me today. I'm sure you can tell that I'm excited about all of the new content and character options that we have available to us now and moving forward, and I'm sure the comments section of this blog will quickly include a rousing debate over the best ways to play some of the characters shown in the graph. (I'll likely start off the comments by expanding my <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkm1?Making-the-Most-of-Character-Unlocks">previous list of best secondary decks</a> to add to any given character.) Thanks for reading, and I look forward to playing with as many of you as I can! </p>

                 <p>I am a gay game designer from Scotland. I was introduced to Pathfinder in my early 20s, and I’ve contributed to multiple RPG products as well as working as a designer on the Pathfinder Online MMO. For me the most powerful and impactful way Paizo supports the LGBQTIA+ community is in the casual and normalized inclusion of such characters in their products. It is a refreshing change from almost every other type of media, especially games media. These characters are simply living their lives in Golarion. They have hopes and fears and dreams and partners and jobs and debts and faiths and feats and classes and memorized spells, and their gender identity and sexuality are secondary to all of that. They are complex individuals, not tropes or tokens, existing in Golarion the same way LGBQTIA+ people do in the real world. They belong, and this helps remind me that I belong too; both in Golarion, and here on Earth.</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p> Talking about being asexual is challenging for me; I’ve identified publicly as asexual/heteroromantic for about a year, privately for about two years before that, and have been questioning on and off since eighth grade. While I’m normally quite talkative, I spent well over half my life not having words to describe myself. If you had told me five years ago that I’d be writing a piece on being queer on Paizo’s community blog, I’d have called you a liar. The notion of being asexual was never really an option for me—I had a couple girlfriends, and while I never felt a drive to be in a relationship, I knew I could feel romantic attachment towards women. You see, I didn’t learn that sexual attraction and romantic attraction were different things until about three years ago, and once I did, I had my answer for who I was. Its why I think it’s so important to get good representation in everything from television shows to roleplaying games—the more places where ideas regarding diverse identities exist, the more likely it is that people who are questioning will discover words that make their personal identities feel valid. Otherwise questioning people are left feeling broken or worthless when nothing could be more wrong.</p> 
                 <p> I think that Paizo’s work in giving voice to diverse people is so important because tabletop RPGs are often a place where questioning people can build characters that help them understand themselves. I don’t have a single queer friend who didn’t “playtest” a queer character before they came out IRL. For me, it was kitsune. Every one of my developers seems to know all about how much I enjoy playing and writing Pathfinder kitsune, but I don’t think many of them know why. For me, the kitsune ancestry is the perfect analog of being asexual. Here you are, this glorious, fantastic person living in a world where life is so much easier when you’re a socially accepted human. But you have an “ace” up your sleeves—it’s easy for you to pretend to be one of them, so you do it. Sure, people sometimes ask awkward questions, but you go through the motions and give generic answers. “I’m focusing on my career,” “I haven’t found the right person,” “I guess I’m in a dry spell.” You play off expectations, and they’re happy to assume you’re one of them. But keeping the secret from your party in a cooperative game is tough. Really, really tough. Eventually you tell them or they find out, and it becomes the party secret. It helps you realize that if you surround yourself with friends and family who love and respect you, they’ll love and respect you in both your forms. Human and kitsune, heterosexual-passing and ace. I don’t know if I would have had that without Pathfinder.</p>

                 <p>I’ve been a proponent of inclusivity in games for decades. For years I’ve been able to cite a whole list of queer characters in the Pathfinder canon, and I could explain why that representation was important. But when I started the Hell’s Rebels Adventure Path with my home group, I ran into the art and description for a fairly minor NPC: Zachrin Vhast—and something about it *clicked* with me in a way that I’d never seen before. It was a major step forward in a long, confusing process of figuring out my own nonbinary gender identity, and I went from understanding why representation is important to really *understanding* why it’s important—and that’s only made me more passionate about doing so.</p>

                 <p> As a kid who felt the need to hide any sign of my interests, roleplaying was a useful excuse to open up. Before I started freelancing, seeing gay characters get some representation helped me feel more comfortable in geek spaces where I spend a fair bit of time. That made it delightful when I got the chance to channel bits of the gay bars I've loved into the Wicked Fork in <em>Inner Sea Taverns</em>. Both sharing secrets and using unexpected connections feel like natural extensions of gay life to me (especially before coming out), and influenced my contributions to <em>Ultimate Intrigue</em>, <em>Spymaster’s Handbook</em>, <em>Inner Sea Intrigue</em>, and other books that focus on skills and problem-solving. Recently, my contributions to Starfinder and especially augmentations have been fueled both by my partner (he was a fan first) and by transhumanism in the queer community.</p>

                 <p> As a gay gamer, I’ve always accepted that characters in sci-fi/fantasy are straight by default (after all, "farmboy swings in to rescue damsel" is a persistent trope of the genre), and while I’ve never been made to feel unwelcome in the fandom, it can be a little frustrating to have games and narratives constantly assume that all their players share the same viewpoint. Working at Paizo, I’m proud of the ways that we’ve tried to empower players to play whatever character appeals to them and add NPCs and background characters of various identities, often for no reason than just to have them exist in the story. I’m especially proud to work with my fellow editors, who’ve helped me find some of my own blind spots in my writing and who are always looking for ways our language can be more inclusive and welcoming to gamers of all strides. Happy Pride, everyone! PS, be on the lookout for an upcoming art piece that puts a hilarious LGBTQ+ spin on “swinging in to rescue the damsel.”</p>

                 <p> Hello, everyone. My name is Dave Nelson and I am a bisexual author who has contributed to some upcoming Paizo products. Bi men are not a group that tends to get a lot of spotlight in pop culture and games, so it has sometimes been a struggle finding myself represented by characters. This is part of what drew me to roleplaying games in the first place; the ability to take on an identity in a zone free of judgement or constraints. The genre allowed me to work out a lot of questions I had about myself and Golarion was the first fantasy world I encountered where I felt someone like me would not be out of place. It is my sincere pleasure to contribute to this world and add as much honest representation that I can.</p>

                 <p> Gaming has always been an outlet for me: a creative outlet, an outlet for stress, a way to blow off aggression. But a couple of years ago it became about something more. It became about self-reflection and self-discovery. I had the opportunity to write an adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8–99: The Solstice Scar</em></a>, that featured a transgender woman as the heroine. In researching transgender people I found that their feelings matched my feelings. It wasn't long before I accepted that I was a transgender woman, and shortly after that I began my transition in earnest. Through roleplaying we can explore aspects of ourselves, learn about ourselves, and improve ourselves. It can be a guide along the path to find one’s self. For my full story of self-discovery and transition, see my blog post, <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2018/07/inspire-confidence-know-thyself/" target="_new">Know Thyself</a>.</p>

                 <p> Our world is scary, and that makes RPGs so important to me. Games like Pathfinder and Starfinder let me relax, escape reality, and enjoy crafting stories with friends. But they also do something even more important: they let me explore myself via my characters, be they NPCs like Sandpoint’s Ameiko, iconic PCs like Merisiel or Zova, or my own PCs like Shensen the rebellious diva or Zeru Zinzi the graffiti artist. It took me a while to notice there was more of me in my characters than I thought, and that helped me realize I was bisexual—the one thing all my characters have shared throughout various games, regardless of ancestry or gender or anything else. My own difficulty with groups and social gatherings in the real world would have made this sort of self-discovery a much slower (or even impossible) process without them. So, thanks to all the Ameikos and Merisiels and Zovas and Shensens and Zerus in my life, and even more thanks to the real-world friends I’ve been so fortunate to meet along the way as fellow players and GMs. You’re all so much more amazing and brave than the heroes in any game we play!</p>

                 <p> My name is Kendra Leigh Speedling and I’ve been a Paizo freelancer for a couple years now! I’ve written two Pathfinder Society quests, some sections for Player Companions, and an Adventure Path bestiary monster, as well as some 3PP work. I’m bisexual as well as demisexual, though I usually use queer as a shorthand. Realizing I’m bi took a while for me; sometimes I still wonder if I actually “count” enough since I’m happily monogamous in a relationship people tend to perceive from the outside as straight. (Being demisexual complicated matters since the number of people I’ve been attracted to is fairly small.)</p> 
                 <p>I always enjoy finding LGBTQ characters in RPG material; this might sound a bit hokey, but it really does make me feel included (especially if they have an identity that isn’t exclusively gay/lesbian—though that representation is also important!). I feel like more and more have been appearing lately, which is awesome. I want people to be able to get that experience from the things I write, too, so it definitely informs my own work. That inclusivity is one of my favorite things about Pathfinder and Starfinder, and I’m glad to be a part of it!</p>

                 <p> I figured out that I was queer when I was 19, rather abruptly. I’ve been on a journey ever since, a journey I am just beginning to realize is far from over. As the U.S. loses so many of its protections for queer folks, that journey is just becoming more important.</p> 
                 <p>But the wonderful counterpoint to the struggle and grief on the national scale is the incredible opening of the gaming community, fraught and tempestuous though it is. People are starting to realize that the queer community is pretty nerdy, and game companies are beginning to include so much content and hire queer people in a way we’ve never been included before, and it is marvelous.</p> 
                 <p>At Paizo, I’ve had the opportunity to write and check some of the guidelines for the respectful inclusion and portrayal of marginalized characters and NPCs. This is an issue that has become increasingly important to me recently, as the backlash for companies explicitly welcoming queer people into their spaces has become vocal and relentless.</p> 
                 <p>And every time I see a clearly queer character in gaming, or see a rule about respect and openness, it’s like another hand reaching out and inviting me into this space where stories are everything, and where bravery and honor change the world in big ways.</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p> Hi, I'm Gabrielle Harbowy. I wrote the Pathfinder Tales novel <em>Gears of Faith </em>(and its short story, "Inheritance"), and the PFS scenario <em>Grotto of the Deluged God</em> (#9-22). I am an out bisexual, polyamorous person, and I loved being able to represent a loving, long-term female couple in my official Pathfinder fiction. Without the supportive and encouraging network at Paizo, my characters Keren and Zae, and their ferocious dog Appleslayer wouldn't exist, and wouldn't have touched the hearts of LGBTQ and allies worldwide. I'm proud to have had a chance to help normalize queer, nonbinary, and trans characters in Golarion, and in fantasy fiction. Representation is so important, and I love that Paizo celebrates it.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">"Got us between Hell and high water again, Captain!" Giant ducked spray and shot a glare to her captain. She didn't have to duck much; even standing on a box step, the halfling was barely tall enough to see over the ship's wheel.</p> 
                <p> Devrin Arlos just laughed and eyed the six Chelish warships closing in on them. They'd chased <em>Nightwave</em> all the way from the Arch of Aroden, along the coast of Rahadoum, and through the treacherous Jagged Reach. They weren't likely to give up now. Ahead loomed the Eye of Abendego. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190627-highseas.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190627-highseas_500.jpeg"></a>

                </div> 
                <p> "Wouldn't have it any other way. Don't worry! <em>Nightwave</em> can take it!" </p> 
                <p> She struggled with the wheel. "Maybe time to put a reef in the forecourse?" </p> 
                <p> "Long past time, but I was hoping—" A crack louder than a ballista shot pierced the howl of the wind, drawing his attention back to their nearest pursuer. "Hoping for that." </p> 
                <p> The foremost Corentine frigate's foretopmast shattered, falling with yards of shredded canvas and a mile of tangled cordage. Sailors scrambled to hack the wreckage away, but the ship slewed off course, and jibed her mizzen boom, ripping yet more canvas. </p> 
                <p> "Payback's a bitch!" Vulmia Manux, Devrin's navigator and general fix-it go-to, shook an ebony fist at the struggling ship. The Mwangi half-elf was still sore that <em>Nightwave</em> had been damaged by the Corentines’ hell-spawned minions. The Corentines were out of devils now, and clearly intended to overpower the Firebrand ship with brute force. </p> 
                <p> "Reef the forecourse and tops'ls." Devrin squinted forward. "Take her a point to starboard, Giant. Batten down and rig lifelines! We're going in!" </p> 
                <p> The crew responded without question. The outer wall of the perpetual storm towered in a burgeoning barrier of torrential rain and wind, mountainous seas, and deadly currents. A glance back confirmed that their pursuers were also shortening sail, but hadn't broken off the chase. </p> 
                <p> "Come and get me, you bastards!" Devrin shouted. </p> 
                <p> "You taking this personal, Captain?" <em>Nightwave</em>'s bosun, Gaspiya, dropped down from the mizzen shrouds, eyeing him with concern, her lip curled back from her short tusks. </p> 
                <p> "No, but somebody's got to teach them that they don't own the whole damned sea!" He clapped Vulmia on her shoulder and grinned. "Don't worry. We've got them right where we want them." </p> 
                <p> "Sorry, sir." Vulmia nodded and squinted into the screaming wind. "I just think we might have bit off more than we can chew. Six to one?" </p> 
                <p> "I said, don't worry! That's my job, right?" Devrin flashed a rakish smile and pointed to the impending wall of the storm. "Give Giant a hand at the helm and hold fast! We're in for a trouncing!" </p> 
                <p> The storm hit them like a charging bull, with rain so thick he could barely see their nearest pursuer slashing hard enough to sting exposed skin. The seas mounted to vertical walls higher than <em>Nightwave</em>'s topsails, their plunging tops threatening to overwhelm them. <em>Nightwave</em> staggered as a wave broke over the ship’s stern, and Devrin struggled to stay put in the waist-deep deluge. Lightning lit the sky in sheets, but the captain howled and laughed into the teeth of the storm. </p> 
                <p> "Captain!" Devrin's cabin boy, a stout young man from Katapesh, pointed abeam. "They're trying to cut us off!" </p> 
                <p> Devrin shielded his eyes and squinted at the Corentine frigate, <em>Helldawn</em>, plunging down a towering wave. "How in bloody blue blazes did they—" Then he spotted the tornado of animate water at the ship's bow, pulling on two thick ropes like a massive draft horse. "They've summoned an elemental!" </p> 
                <p> A webbed hand closed on Devrin's shoulder. "It's time, Captain." </p> 
                <p> He turned to look into the blue-on-blue features of Ris, an undine and recent addition to his crew. It had been Ris who had told him about the Chelish plan to dump tons of toxic mine tailings onto a submarine merfolk city in the Hellmouth Gulf. At his behest, she had delved the depths to warn the merfolk. With no way to forestall the Chelish, the merfolk had evacuated their city, saving tens of thousands of lives. Now was the time for retribution. </p> 
                <p> "You're sure, Ris? The seas—" </p> 
                <p> Another wave buried <em>Nightwave</em>'s quarterdeck, but while the rest of them struggled to stay upright, Ris reveled in the torrent, her lips curving from pearly teeth in glee. The deluge flowed off her blue skin and sharkskin leathers, lending strength to her slim frame. </p> 
                <p> "I'm sure, my captain." Ris lifted a willowy arm to point to a towering swell, a hundred feet of sheer water. Lightning lit the sky behind the wave, illuminating thousands of sinuous shapes within. </p> 
                <p> Devrin's mouth dropped open at the sight. A vast school of merfolk, tridents in hand, their marine minions swimming along with them, shapes enormous and terrible, yet beautiful. </p> 
                <p> "Sing them a song, Ris!" </p> 
                <p> "I will, my captain." She pulled the lyre from her back, an enchanted instrument crafted from shell, narwhal horn, and mother of pearl. A wave crested to break against the ship's quarter, and Ris dove straight into the tortuous sea. </p> 
                <p> "Hope she hurries up!" Vulmia shouted over the roar of wind and water. "They're getting close!" </p> 
                <p> Indeed, <em>Helldawn</em> was closing fast. At the peak of a swell, the ship yawed, and ballistae cracked. The deadly bolts flew at <em>Nightwave</em> with unerring accuracy, holing sails, smashing into the hull, and impaling flesh. Devrin bellowed for the ship's cleric, Rikkan, to see to the injured, even as the holed sails tore to shreds in the hurricane winds. Vulma, Gaspiya, and the top-crews clambered up the ratlines like spiders to cut away the torn canvas, but the damage was done. <em>Nightwave</em> slewed with the uneven strain and nearly broached on a towering wave. </p> 
                <p> "Captain!" Giant screamed, fighting the wheel with all her strength. "She'll roll on the next one if we don't get some sail aloft!" </p> 
                <p> Devrin fought his way to the binnacle and flung open the hatch beneath the compass. There, in a golden frame, sat an apple-sized emerald glowing with an inner light, <em>Nightwave</em>'s heart. </p> 
                <p> The captain placed a hand on the gem and spoke low. "Spirits of the deep, hear my call. Claim your places at my side! Make sail!" </p> 
                <p> The spirits of a hundred and one sailors lost at sea surged from the gem in a translucent torrent, racing aloft, untouched by the hurricane winds. Ethereal canvas billowed on ghostly winds to pull <em>Nightwave</em> upright. Her bow pointed down the next towering swell, and they raced forth. The ghostly sails faded away quickly, but they had saved the ship. </p> 
                <p> The burst of speed had taken them out of range of <em>Helldawn</em>'s ballistae, but for how long? The peak of a wave blocked their view of <em>Helldawn</em>, but then both ships rose, and Devrin saw their salvation surging from the depths. </p> 
                <p> "She rises!" he bellowed, as the behemoth surged from the sea, an orca of such massive size that it dwarfed the leviathans of the deep. </p> 
                <p> The monstrous whale breeched to the height of <em>Helldawn</em>'s main crosstrees, and came down amidships. Timbers snapped like kindling, planks exploding with the horrific impact. The ship's keel snapped with a report that Devrin felt through the soles of his boots. The ship foundered, broken in half, two hundred sailors, gone in one moment of vengeance. </p> 
                <p> "Payback!" Vulmia screamed from aloft, and the captain and crew of <em>Nightwave</em> cheered. </p> 
                <p> In a moment of eerie clarity, the torrential rains ceased. The remaining Corentine ships stood there, stark against the raging storm. </p> 
                <p> Then, from the sea, vengeance rose like a plague of demons from the abyss. </p> 
                <p> Tentacles ensnared one ship, tearing at wood and flesh, while the jaws of a megalodon ripped at the hull of another. Thousands of merfolk surged up the sides of a third, their tridents crackling with electricity, torrents of water blasting Chelish sailors and marines off the deck. A fourth ship surged upward as a vast shape thrust up from beneath. The dragon turtle's spiked shell smashed through the deck of the ship, and the beast thrashed, splintering wood and crushing sailors. The last ship in the armada tried to flee, but the sea behind them frothed with the fury of the merfolk. In their haste, the Corentine captain must have forgotten about the storm. A breaking sea took them on the beam, and the ship capsized, masts snapping like felled trees. When the wave rolled past, there was nothing left but flotsam. </p> 
                <p> Devrin stared in silent shock for a long moment. Six ships, twelve <em>hundred</em> sailors...gone. </p> 
                <p> "Captain." Ris touched her captain's shoulder, and he turned to see the undine's sorrow. "I'm sorry. I sang the song of vengeance to them. They needed no such encouragement." </p> 
                <p> "I wish we could have let that last ship go, just to take the message back to Cheliax." He scanned the sea, but it was clear that there would be no survivors. "Maybe it would have prevented another incident like this." </p> 
                <p> "Perhaps." Ris shook her head. "But the sea is a harsh mistress, and even Hell lacks the wrath to thwart her will."</p>

                <p itemprop="description">In May, we introduced the concept of major and minor factions, as well as <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgn1?Pathfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Preview" title="Pathfinder Society Second Edition Preview: Horizon Hunters &amp; Radiant Oath">introduced the first of our new factions</a> for the Second Edition campaign: the Horizon Hunters and Radiant Oath.

Today we introduce the last of our major factions! </p> 
                <h2>Grand Archive (Major Faction)</h2> 
                <p>Archaeology is a destructive science, and adventurers tend to be more destructive than most. If the Society’s to uphold its mandate to study and preserve the past, then documentation and academic rigor are key. Yet members of the Grand Archive do not limit themselves to Absalom’s libraries; these bold explorers’ voyage to the most exciting sites to chronicle the past in person and share those tales with the world.</p> 
                <p><strong>Faction Leader</strong>: Although third in line for the Sky Citadel Kraggodan’s throne, <strong>Gorm Greathammer</strong> (LN male dwarf) has always been drawn to the adventuring lifestyle. His passion drew him to the Pathfinder Society decades ago, where he distinguished himself as an explorer and chronicler, having numerous publications to his name and countless stories to retell. Even so, he regularly returned home to help administrate the sky citadel. After withstanding the exhausting Ironfang Invasion and direceting peace negotiations with Molthune, he returned to the Grand Lodge on an extended leave of absence. He now oversees the Grand Archive, promoting scholarship and uncovering centuries-old mysteries to solve at long last. Yet those who would expect the Grand Archive’s leader to be a shy, spectacled sage are in for a surprise; Gorm is daring, boisterous, and ready to get his hands dirty alongside his allies.</p> 
                <p><strong>Objectives:</strong> The Grand Archive promotes the ongoing education of Pathfinder agents, the recovery of ancient knowledge, and the mastery of esoteric lore. Thanks to Gorm Greathammer’s leadership, the faction also encourages travel, so that agents can experience history directly, draw their own conclusions, and ensure that all relics receive the care and curation they deserve—especially where a berserker’s boots might otherwise shatter a priceless statue. After years of neglect and several noteworthy attacks, the Grand Lodge’s written records are a tattered shadow of what they once were, and the Grand Archive is dedicated to restoring the Society’s libraries by seeking replacement texts and long-lost documents the world over.</p> 
                <h2>Vigilant Seal (Major Faction)</h2> 
                <p>Rune-sealed doors, buried temples, warded vaults, and ancient keeps…these are among the most tantalizing sites for explorers to delve, yet all too often these ruins were abandoned for the same reason: their contents were too dangerous to leave unfettered yet too enduring to destroy outright. The Pathfinder Society’s track record of unleashing forgotten horrors while in the pursuit of glory and lore is dubious. Yet for every imprisoned fiend accidentally released while Pathfinders explore overgrown shrines, the explorers have also uncovered and defeated slumbering evils that would have otherwise emerged to plague the world unforeseen and uncontested. As far as the Vigilant Seal’s concerned, this tradition of cavalier recklessness must change.</p> 
                <p><strong>Faction Leader</strong>: Among the most famous Pathfinders of the previous decade, Eando Kline (CG male human) famously explored Varisia, infiltrated the Hold of Belkzen, and plumbed the Darklands’ depths to uncover a lost serpentfolk city. Knowing that further publicity would encourage exploration and goad the serpentine villains to attack the surface, Kline returned to the Grand Lodge ahead of his rival Arnois Belzig, urging the Decemvirate not to publish either of their findings. The Decemvirate dismissed his concerns, and in disgust, Eando Kline resigned from the Society. For the past decade he’s led his own expeditions, always endeavoring to explore more responsibly than the organization he left behind. Yet with news of a change in the Decemvirate and respected colleagues rising to positions of power, Eando Kline has returned to the Society at last, accepting his old wayfinder so long as he could lead in the organization’s reform.</p> 
                <p><strong>Objectives:</strong> Just as the Pathfinder Society decrees that its agents must “explore, report, and cooperate,” the Vigilant Seal expects its agents to “protect, contain, and destroy.” Dangerous artifacts are often best kept deep within the Grand Lodge or other secure sites, rather than left where they might cause harm. Where slumbering evils lie chained, agents are expected to ensure every link remains strong. And where those goals are impossible, those agents must be ready to neutralize the threat. The Vigilant Seal encourages its agents to be educated enough to identify and understand hazards, and Eando Kline believes that individual Pathfinders must exercise their own discretion in assessing the danger and knowing when to intervene.</p> 
                <p>And with that, you’ve now met all six of our starting factions, including four major factions and two minor factions. There are more previews yet to come, and of course even more to share at the new campaign’s launch on August 1st!</p>

                <p>By far the largest of the meta-regions in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zoj?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide"><em>Lost Omens World Guide</em></a>, the High Seas consist of, well, all the seas and oceans that cover Golarion’s surface. And though the shape of these great bodies of water remains largely constant, the sea is ever changing, with new, unexpected threats and bounties awaiting over every horizon or washing ashore with every wave. That said, not a lot has changed between Pathfinder's first and second edition in this region, leaving more room for us to explore all new locations and dive deeper into the lore of established but only lightly detailed locales and organizations.</p> 
                <p>Among the areas given new revelations are the Mordant Spire, the ancient elven outpost formed from the remains of a dead Azlanti god; the utopian island nation of Hermea, where the benevolent gold dragon Mengkare oversees a grand experiment to perfect humanity; tropical Mediogalti Island, home to the pirate port of Ilizmagorti and the secret, jungle citadel of the Red Mantis assassins cult!</p>

                <p>The region of the High Seas we've done the most with in Pathfinder's first decade of development is the archipelago known as the Shackles, off Garund's western coast. Here, in the shadow of the permanent hurricane called the Eye of Abendego, the Free Captains of the Pirate Council rule their fellow buccaneers as much with fear and the threat of violence as they do loyalty and the promise of coin. A few years back, the Hurricane King Kerdak Bonefist was defeated by an ambitious crew of pirates who'd begun their career as simple deckhands on the famed ship <em>Wormwood</em>. Replacing Bonefist as the head of the Pirate Council and ruler of Port Peril is Hurricane Queen Tessa Fairwind. To the pirates and other natives of the Shackles, life is pretty much what it was before the edition change, but the Free Pirates, no longer receiving bribes from the government of Sargava, have ramped up their operations in the region, leaving the entire southern Arcadian Ocean ripe territory for both potential cutthroats and privateers looking to quash piracy at its source.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190625-tessafairwind.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190625-tessafairwind_500.jpeg"></a>

                </div> 
                <p>One of the most exciting parts of the High Seas region, however, are the lands and settlements beneath the waves. New sites in the Inner Sea and Arcadian Ocean are presented with exciting adversaries, political intrigues, and adventure seeds for any sea-faring campaign. Among them are the aquatic elf city of Irim, the gillman enclave of Kienek-Li off the Isle of Kortos, consisting of the coral Boneglade and the buoyant, wooden Float, anchored to the ocean floor by giant chains, and the deep-trench alghollthu city of Gholinom, dubbed the Passage Outward by its sinister masters.</p>

                <p>Presented alongside the setting details of the High Seas are a number of new character options, including both magical and mundane equipment useful in both maritime and underwater exploration, seven new backgrounds such as the Hermean expatriate, scholar of Azlant, and storm survivor, and the Red Mantis assassin archetype, allowing cultists of the mantis god Achaekek to begin their training as early in their careers as second level.</p> 
                <p>Next week, we'll head back to solid ground for a trip through the Impossible Lands along the Obari Ocean! On Thursday, Pathfinder Tales veteran Chris A.

                <h2>What is Pathfinder all about?</h2> 
                <p>At its heart, Pathfinder Second Edition is the same type of game as first edition. You take on the role of a sword &amp; sorcery adventurer of your own design, going on daring adventures for a chance at fame and fortune. One player takes on the role of Game Master, helping to adjudicate the actions of player characters, nonplayer characters, and monsters, weaving all of them together to form a compelling story—one that everyone at the table helped to create!</p> 
                <p> Of course, as a game, Pathfinder is a lot more than just telling stories. It is a system of rules that defines how the world works, and for Second Edition we wanted to make sure that this game “engine” was easy to understand and interpret, both for players and Game Masters! And while we made sure that creating and advancing your character was a clean and intuitive as it could be, we also ensured that the game allowed your choices—your vision for your character—to truly matter. The decisions you make in Pathfinder define your character, expressed not just in the story but in the rules as well. </p> 
                <h2>Core Mechanic</h2> 
                <p>Pathfinder is a narrative roleplaying game, meaning that you describe what your character is attempting to do while the Game Master describes how the story and world unfolds around you. Whenever there is doubt or uncertainty in actions, you will be called upon to make a check, which requires you to roll a d20 and add a modifier based on your character’s proficiency at that particular challenge. These checks come in many forms, from swinging a sword to climbing a cliff to dodging a roaring fireball. The result of your check, as interpreted by the GM, determines whether or not you succeed at your task, and might even decide whether or not your character survives!</p> 
                <p>In Pathfinder Second Edition, proficiency determines nearly every important statistic used by your character during play. How skilled are you with a longbow? How good are you at Stealth? What is your aptitude for casting illusion magic? All of these statistics, and many more, are defined by your proficiency in the statistic. </p> 
                <p>Proficiency is gained through the choices you make in building your character. If you are untrained, you get no bonus at all, but you can still add a modifier from a relevant ability score to represent your raw talent. If you are trained, you add your level plus 2, along with any other relevant modifiers. If you are an expert, you add 4 instead. Masters add 6, and characters with legendary proficiency add 8. This basic formula applies to nearly everything in Pathfinder Second Edition, making it easy for you to see where you stand and understand what your chances are at overcoming the challenges the game puts in front of you. </p> 
                <h2>Facing Danger</h2> 
                <p>The world of Pathfinder is a dangerous place. Vampires lurk in forgotten tombs, trolls prowl in the mountains, and deadly dragons await atop mounds of priceless treasure. These threats—and many more—await your character as they explore the story, and more often than not, such encounters will end with a thrilling combat.</p> 
                <p>Combat in Pathfinder is much more structured than the freeform narrative play of the rest of the game. During combat, participants take turns, during which the number of things that can be accomplished is limited. On your turn, your character will get to take three actions. Many of these will be what are called basic actions, like moving, drawing a weapon, opening a door, or making an attack. Some might be special actions that only your character can take, based on the choices you made during character creation. Casting spells, performing amazing martial stunts, or utilizing special class features like rage are all examples of special actions.</p> 
                <p>Just because your turn is over does not mean that you do not have an opportunity to participate in the combat. Some characters can take special reactions that allow them to interrupt the flow of play on other characters’ turns. You might dodge an incoming attack, block with your shield, or even attempt to counter an enemy’s spell. Each character can only take one reaction between turns though, so you have to make it count!</p> 
                <p>Combat continues until one side is defeated, gives up, or retreats, but these deadly encounters are just one way that you might resolve conflict. You might use skills or magic to sneak past foes, or you could try to talk your way out of a fight, relying on guile and charm to win the day. Ultimately, the way you approach danger in Pathfinder is up to you, and your chance at success depends on the choices you make for your character! </p> <!-- yes this is a table. please move along. -->

                <h2>Creating Your Story</h2> 
                <p>Pathfinder Second Edition empowers you to tell your own story, no matter what side of the table you occupy. Players have a wide variety of choices in making their character, giving them the tools to bring their idea to life. Your choice of ancestry, background, and class define the major parts of your character, but they are just the beginning. Your choice of skills, feats, and gear say a lot about the player character you are portraying and as you gain power, the new choices you get to make speak to your hero’s journey. You can come up with a plan for your character’s growth, or you can let their adventures influence your decisions. It’s up to you!</p> 
                <p>Taking on the role of Game Master brings a whole different kind of flexibility to your role at the table. As GM, you get to shape the overall narrative, defining the actions of villains, monsters, and all of the nonplayer characters that make up the world. You provide the adversaries that the PCs must face if they hope to succeed, and your narrative forms the backdrop that allows the characters to grow and triumph. Pathfinder provides a wide range of tools to help you in this vital task, from guidelines on how to build balanced encounters to narrative advice, and guidance on how to create a welcoming play environment. Within the pages of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook">Core Rulebook</a> you will also find a wealth of treasure to award to your PCs when they succeed and a bunch of devious traps to guard the treasure. Most importantly, the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp4?Pathfinder-Bestiary">Bestiary</a> contains over 400 monsters waiting to face off against your PCs, from shambling undead to fiendish demons.</p>

                 <p>The Class of 2013: Ezren, Kyra, Merisiel, Sajan, Seoni, Seelah, Amiri, Harsk, Lem, Lini, Valeros</p>
                </div> 
                <p>We started, of course, with the "Core Eleven," the iconics representing the classes from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3">Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</a>. In August 2013, the wizard <b>Ezren</b>, the cleric <b>Kyra</b>, the ranger <b>Harsk</b>, the bard <b>Lem</b>, the rogue <b>Merisiel</b>, the sorcerer <b>Seoni</b>, and the fighter <b>Valeros</b> became the centerpiece of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy951a">Rise of the Runelords Base Set</a>, and are without a doubt the most played characters in PACG history. For those who wanted a slightly more complex set of characters, the barbarian <b>Amiri</b>, the druid <b>Lini</b>, the monk <b>Sajan</b>, and the paladin <b>Seelah</b> were featured in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy91un">Rise of the Runelords Character Add-On Deck</a>.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2014.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2014_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p>The Class of 2014: Alahazra, Damiel, Feiya, Jirelle, Lirianne, Oloch, and Seltyiel</p>
                </div> 
                <p>As satisfying and… well, iconic as those characters were, we were hot to introduce a bunch more. While we spooled out alternate options for those 11 classes in our first waves of class decks, we introduced a handful of less traditional iconics in August 2014. The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy92zj">Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</a> gave us the oracle <b>Alahazra</b>, the swashbuckler <b>Jirelle</b>, the gunslinger <b>Lirianne</b>, and the magus <b>Seltyiel</b>, while the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy92zk">Skull &amp; Shackles Character Add-On Deck</a> was home to the alchemist <b>Damiel</b> (more on him later), the witch <b>Feiya</b>, and the warpriest <b>Oloch</b>.</p> 
                <p>We’d now introduced roughly half the known Iconics, and people started clamoring for the rest. There was a particularly loud drumbeat for the investigator Quinn, whom people presumed would make his debut in our next set. This did not occur.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2015.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2015_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p>The Class of 2015: Adowyn, Alain, Balazar, Crowe, Enora, Imrijka, and Shardra</p>
                </div> 
                <p>May 2015 launched the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9a46">Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</a>, where the cavalier <b>Alain</b>, the summoner <b>Balazar</b>, the arcanist <b>Enora</b>, and the inquisitor <b>Imrijka</b> arrived. Those first two mandated a whole new card type, the cohort, to account for their respective warhorse Donahan and chicken-snake eidolon Padrig. The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9h3j">Wrath of the Righteous Character Add-On Deck</a> gave spots to the hunter <b>Adowyn</b>, the bloodrager <b>Crowe</b>, and the shaman <b>Shardra</b>, with Adowyn and Shardra accompanied by the wolf cohort Leryn and the stone spirit cohort Kolo. Quinn, an urban character, would have to wait until we were done sacking the Abyss.</p> 
                <p>We were nearing the goal line, except the RPG folks were moving the goalposts. Suddenly, there were about to be a lot more iconics.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2016.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2016_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p>The Class of 2016: Estra, Mavaro, Yoon, and Zadim</p>
                </div> 
                <p>For the next set, we had a choice to make: complete the existing iconics or branch out with a few more story-based characters. The design team was split: yeah, we wanted to wrap up the iconics in a dainty bow, but there were just too many other cool characters we wanted to make. In October 2016, the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9mbg">Mummy’s Mask Base Set</a> featured the slayer <b>Zadim</b> and the first two of our mental-focused iconics, the spiritualist <b>Estra</b> and the kineticist <b>Yoon</b>, along with Estra’s ghost ally Honaire. Another of those, the occultist <b>Mavaro</b>, appeared in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9reo">Mummy’s Mask Character Add-On Deck</a>.</p> 
                <p>But that’s only four new iconics. We slowed our roll a bit, saving room for new non-iconics in our core boxes for the first time: the rogue Simoun (whom we made up), the magus Ahmotep (ditto), the druid Channa Ti (from Elaine Cunningham’s stories), and the cleric Drelm (from Howard Andrew Jones’s stories). This made for a richer story than if we’d dropped Quinn into the middle of the undead-filled desert. We would later follow that inclusion of non-iconic characters from Pathfinder fiction by introducing James Sutter’s Salim in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9gdq">Inquisitor Class Deck</a> and Dave Gross’s Alase in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9mbi">Summoner Class Deck</a>. We also added the trio of Dave’s wizard Varian and bodyguard Radovan (both previously seen as a cohorts in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9g8v">Season of the Righteous</a>) and Chris A. Jackson’s lunar naga astrologer Celeste in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2e">Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</a>.</p> 
                <p>At this point, we needed to make some calls. We didn’t have the next base set on the horizon yet, but we wanted to keep bringing out characters. So the practice of only debuting iconics in Adventure Paths needed to be reconsidered. The other obvious place was the class decks, but were we really going to want to write a class deck solely for mesmerists? We needed a new approach. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2017.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2017_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p>The Class of 2017: Emil, Lazzaro, Linxia, Nyctessa, Urgraz, and Zelhara</p>

                <p>In October and November 2017, we debuted the first character decks united around an Adventure Path. The <a href="https://paizo.com/hellsVengeance">Hell’s Vengeance</a> Adventure Path features six evil characters—the so-called "evil iconics," even though they’re not technically iconics—and we wanted our players to get to play the baddies too. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2o">Hell’s Vengeance 1 Character Deck</a> featured the cleric <b>Lazzaro</b>, the hellknight <b>Linxia</b>, and the antipaladin <b>Urgraz</b>, while <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjy"> Hell’s Vengeance 2</a> contained the assassin <b>Emil</b>, the necromancer <b>Nyctessa</b>, and the torturer <b>Zelhara</b>. I admit that when I designed the first iteration of this game, I did not expect a torturer character. But hey, it takes all kinds. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2018.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2018_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p>The Class of 2018: Aric, Erasmus, Hayato, Meligaster, the Red Raven, Reiko, Rivani, and Zova</p>
                </div> 
                <p>In the same design cycle, we did it again, this time with all of the iconics from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu">Occult Adventures</a>. In addition to Estra, January 2018’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9teh">Occult Adventures 1 Character Deck</a> starred the mesmerist <b>Meligaster</b> (Lem’s bro!) and the psychic <b>Rivani</b>. The next month, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9u08"> Occult Adventures 2</a> had the return of Mavaro and Yoon, plus the debut of the medium <b>Erasmus</b>. This approach allowed us to make the occult boons that all of them could use, including all the psychic spells.</p> 
                <p>And now we were down to stragglers. At this point there were only six iconics left, and no clear plan to deal with them. For example, were we ever going to make the <a href="https://paizo.com/jadeRegent">Jade Regent</a> Adventure Path? I mean, maybe? But not soon. So what to do with the samurai and the ninja? A Jade Regent Character Deck? Sounded cool, but I had another idea.</p> 
                <p>Based on complaints I heard at PaizoCon and elsewhere that the first seven class decks had essentially been lapped by the creations we made afterward, I proposed to Paizo a new line of decks designed to supplement the class deck line. Using the four “Ultimate” RPG books as inspiration, we would make four “Ultimate Decks,” each with a bunch of experimental boons and one character each. That character would be one that we probably never would make a class deck for. For example, with the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy97if">Wizard Class Deck</a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy97ie">Sorcerer Class Deck</a> already in existence, did we really need a deck with three arcanists in it? One would do. So Enora reappeared in April 2018’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9vtb">Ultimate Magic Add-On Deck</a>.</p> 
                <p>But now we had a chance to get three more iconics out: the samurai <b>Hayato</b> in March 2018’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9vmz">Ultimate Combat Add-On Deck</a>, the ninja <b>Reiko</b> in June 2018’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x03">Ultimate Equipment Add-On Deck</a>, and—in one of the most bizarre things we’ve ever done—the dual-character vigilante <b>Aric</b>/the <b>Red Raven</b> in May 2018’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9wmw">Ultimate Intrigue Add-On Deck</a>. Which would— Hold on. As we were plotting these out, Erik and Vic let slip that a new book called <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness</a> was on the way, and it would feature a new shifter class with a not-yet-named iconic. After some quick schedule rejiggering, <b>Zova</b> appeared in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdn">Ultimate Wilderness Add-On Deck</a> in July 2018.</p> 
                <p>All right, just three to go! I had lobbied that our new versatile base set contain all the Core Eleven iconics done from scratch. My co-designers told me this would be challenging—actually, I think the word they used was “impossible.” No single box before could ever hold 11 characters, but I was sure we could do it. Eleven was tight, but we could just make it. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2019.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2019_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p>The Class of 2019: Fumbus, Hakon, Kess, and Quinn</p>
                </div> 
                <p>But the folks in RPG R&amp;D had one more surprise first. With the long-awaited Second Edition <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0k">Pathfinder Core Rulebook</a> underway, they wanted to introduce a goblin iconic. Totally cool by me, I said, and then they said they wanted it to be an alchemist. “But, but… we already have an iconic alchemist,” I said. They would shed no tears for poor Damiel, and neither did I when I saw the crazily goggled nutball they were planning to make. “What’s his name?” I asked. “Oh, he’s still in testing,” they said. “We won’t know that for months.” I don’t draw many lines with Paizo, but this time I had no choice. “Our game comes out three months before yours does,” I said. “So if you don’t name this goblin quickly, he’s gonna be named ‘Gobbo McBoomy.’” Bingo-bongo, the iconic goblin alchemist <b>Fumbus</b> was born. Alongside the other members of the newly expanded “Core Twelve,” Fumbus appeared in May 2019’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7">Core Set</a>.</p> 
                <p>Core’s companion Adventure Path, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>, finally gave us the urban setting we’d been longing for, and we could bring in the last three iconics. Along with a new version of Varian (with Radovan as a cohort), Curse debuted the skald <b>Hakon</b>, the brawler <b>Kess</b>, and, at long last, the investigator <b>Quinn</b>. Iconic collection 100% complete.</p> 
                <p>That’s 41 iconic characters (since Aric and the Red Raven have separate character cards) plus 6 “evil iconics”, amid—get this—163 total characters and 329 roles. (Why not 326, you ask? At the risk of spoilers, I leave that question for the trivia-minded among you.) It’s been a great journey with a whole lot of great characters. We hope you’ve enjoyed playing each and every one.</p>

               </div> 
               <p itemprop="description">Invisible and as silent as a church fart, Twilp Farfan slipped through the sparse midday crowds of Sothis's Malhitu Bazaar. Skulking in broad daylight always freaked the halfling out, but if he didn't stir up too much dust or bump into anyone, his passage would go unnoticed. Sothans tended to close up shop and nap in the blazing heat of the day, so there weren't many people about.</p> 
               <p><em>All good for me.</em> He paused in the shade of an awning and wiped his face. <em>All except the heat.</em></p> 
               <p>Twilp studied the blue-domed cupolas across the square and found the right building. Two burly guards stood beside the beaded doorway of Kepeshka's Antiquities Emporium. Sweat glistened on their ebony skin, their eyelids sagging, but each rested a hand on a khopesh at his belt.</p> 
               <p><em>Nobody trusts anyone these days.</em> Of course, that included Twilp. He didn't care who he stole for or from, as long as the gold was yellow. In Sothis, gold was all that mattered, and after the fall of the pyramids, there had been a glut of expensive antiquities on the market, ripe for the picking. The halfling's gaze drifted up to Sothis's looming Black Dome and the recently fallen pyramid beyond. The instant it hit the ground, grave robbers had swarmed like ants over a fallen elephant. The very trinket he was being paid to steal had come from that megalithic monstrosity. Twilp didn't know what was so important about this particular bauble anyway; a dagger was a dagger as far as he was concerned. But gold...</p> 
               <p>The ground-floor windows were girded with ornate iron latticework, and the sheer walls defied even the deftest climber. Twilp edged around the square and up to the bead-curtained doorway. The guards blinked lazily, half asleep. The burglar eased down to the ground and squirmed quietly beneath the curtain.</p> 
               <p>Good thing I'm skinny. He rose up inside and scanned the showroom. A woman sat behind a counter, idly polishing a lamp. Twilp grinned. Now for the prize.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190620-GoldenRoad.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190620-GoldenRoad_500.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <p>Upstairs, he found the merchant's bedroom. Two more guards stood at the door, which gaped to allow the breeze to circulate. They didn't even twitch when he slipped past them. Gauzy curtains billowed, the Black Dome and pyramid looming beyond. Some said everything from the inside of the fallen pyramid was cursed, but Twilp didn't believe it. Gold was the only thing he believed in.</p> 
               <p>Twilp tore his eyes away from the view, and skulked over to the merchant's bed. Big enough for six, it currently accommodated only three: the merchant, Lorisi Kepeshka, and two comely men, husbands or toys. Sweat glistened on their skin like the luster of precious metal. <em>Like gold</em>... The dagger hung from the headboard above Kepeshka's tousled black hair, worth enough to keep Twilp happy for months.</p> 
               <p>The halfling examined the serpent hilt and pommel, its fanged head and ruby eyes. Gaudy. As his fingers curled around the scaled hilt, however, the dagger's eyes came alight.</p> 
               <p>"Hello, little thief."</p> 
               <p>Twilp jerked his hand away, unsure for a moment if he'd heard the voice with his ears or in his head. His client, Lady Nikiri, hadn't told him it was haunted. <em>Doesn't matter.</em> As he reached again, a bead of sweat fell from his brow and plopped down right between Lorisi Kepeshka's eyes.</p> 
               <p>Twilp froze.</p> 
               <p>She stirred, one hand reaching up to wipe the drop away, her eyes blinking open. She stared right through the invisible burglar for a moment, then looked up to the dagger. She sighed, smiled, and reached for it.</p> 
               <p><em>Oh, no you don't!</em> Twilp grabbed for it, and their hands touched the scabbarded weapon at the same instant.</p> 
               <p>"Well, this should be interesting," the voice said in his mind.</p> 
               <p>Lorisi Kepeshka's eyes flung wide. "Thief!"</p> 
               <p>Crap! Twilp jerked the dagger out of her grasp, and the weapon became invisible.</p> 
               <p>"The dagger! Thief!" Kepeshka's bedmates lurched up, and the door guards burst in, swords drawn.</p> 
               <p>"Kill her!" the voice said in Twilp's head. "Use me!"</p> 
               <p><em>Bugger off!</em> Twilp backed away.</p> 
               <p>"Someone took the dagger!" Kepeshka vaulted out of bed. "They're invisible! Block the door and sweep the room!"</p> 
               <p>"Is that any way to talk to someone who can make you a god?" the voice of the dagger asked.</p> 
               <p><em>You can hear my thoughts?</em></p> 
               <p>"Yes, and read your greedy little soul, Twilp Farfan."</p> 
               <p><em>Great. Now shut up; I'm busy!</em> He clipped the dagger to his belt and dashed for the window.</p> 
               <p>"Wait! Aren't you going to kill her? You really should, you know."</p> 
               <p><em>I'm a burglar, not an assassin.</em> Twilp leapt and tore through the gauzy curtains.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, but her life force can be yours! I can give it to you!"</p> 
               <p><em>I don't want it.</em> The burglar hit a canvas awning and slid. Anyone heavier would have torn right through, but Twilp didn't. "But it'll make you powerful, invulnerable, immortal!"</p> 
               <p><em>Don't particularly want those either.</em> He flipped off the awning into the street, bowling down a man carrying a basket of flatbread.</p> 
               <p>"What kind of mortal are you?" The dagger sounded incredulous.</p> 
               <p><em>The kind who likes his life the way it is. Now shut up.</em></p> 
               <p>"Thief!" Kepeshka screeched from the window, pointing right at him. "Guards! After that thief!"</p> 
               <p>The two ground-floor guards drew their swords and advanced.</p> 
               <p>Twilp now understood why Lady Nikiri wanted the dagger. Denied the political power of her elder siblings, married to a lesser house, and now aging and bitter, the lure of power and immortality would be irresistible to her.</p> 
               <p><em>I'll settle for gold.</em> Twilp dashed up the street.</p> 
               <p>"Coward," the dagger chided.</p> 
               <p>Twilp ignored it and ran.</p> 
               <p>"There!" one of the guards bellowed.</p> 
               <p>Twilp glanced back and saw the puffs of dust where his feet touched the street. They'd spotted him.</p> 
               <p>The burglar dodged under awnings, over, around, and under displays of goods, but they were hot on his heels, their longer legs doubling his best speed.</p> 
               <p>"Kill them! I'll make you a god!"</p> 
               <p><em>And deal with all that religion crap? No thanks!</em> Twilp sprinted past the auction houses and into the Rose Quarter, trying to keep the dust of his passage down, but to no avail.</p> 
               <p>"There!" The guards were right on him.</p> 
               <p>Desperate, Twilp dodged into Wimiri's Bathhouse.</p> 
               <p>"Look! Footprints!"</p> 
               <p>Twilp glanced back at his dusty tracks on the otherwise spotless tile floor. Damn!</p> 
               <p>"Kill them!" the dagger screamed.</p> 
               <p><em>Shut up!</em> The halfling dodged through a doorway and skidded to a stop inches before falling into a sunken bath crowded with chatting women sipping cool drinks. The guard chasing him wasn't so dexterous.</p> 
               <p>The man slammed into Twilp's back, and they both plunged into the bath. Twilp's head cracked the bottom of the shallow pool hard enough to stun him. He thrashed to the surface, women screaming, and a meaty fist closed on the neck of his jerkin.</p> 
               <p>"Got you, little thief!" The guard lifted him, raising his khopesh.</p> 
               <p>"Kill him!" the dagger bellowed in his mind. "Use me! It's your only chance!"</p> 
               <p>For once, Twilp agreed. He had to get free, and the blade hung at his belt. He drew it and stabbed the man's elbow.</p> 
               <p>"YES!"</p> 
               <p>Crimson light flooded the bath. The dagger's blade shone like a flaming ruby, pulsing with life as it pierced the guard's arm. The man drew a startled breath, eyes wide, not in pain, but in terror.</p> 
               <p>Flesh shriveled on the guard's bones, blood, life, and for all Twilp knew, his soul sucked away into the blade...and into Twilp. The dried husk of flesh crumbled, and the halfling hit the water.</p> 
               <p>The bathers erupted in panic, thrashing to get away from the spreading pall of ashes in the water.</p> 
               <p>"There, now." The dagger sounded satisfied. "Feel better?"</p> 
               <p>Twilp <em>did</em> feel better, his pain gone, his head clear, and he fairly bristled with energy. He felt like he could do anything, like he would live forever.</p> 
               <p>"And you can," the dagger assured him. "Every life you take with me will make you greater."</p> 
               <p>Twilp thought of it, immortality, power, riches, the helpless bathers fleeing around him, and almost puked. He thrashed out of the water and invoked the magic of his ring again, blinking into invisibility. Sheathing the dagger and snatching up a towel, he slipped out of the bathing room, avoiding the panicked patrons. The voice of the dagger rang in his head, urging him to sheath it in flesh, to drink their lives.</p> 
               <p>Quelling the temptation to become a god, Twilp crept into another wing of the establishment. Sheltered alcoves, each with a lidded commode, lined a wall beneath narrow windows.</p> 
               <p><em>Perfect!</em> Twilp hopped up onto a bench and lifted the lid at his feet.</p> 
               <p>"What are you <em>doing</em>?"</p> 
               <p>He thought about what the dagger had promised him, and what someone like Lady Nikiri would do with it. The gold she had promised him suddenly seemed stained with blood.</p> 
               <p>Twilp drew the dagger.</p> 
               <p>"What are you doing?!"</p> 
               <p>"Saving my soul, you filthy piece of crap." Twilp held it over the dark pit.</p> 
               <p>"DON'T!"</p> 
               <p>Twilp released his grip and watched the blade's red glow vanish into the depths. With a wet plop, the crimson light winked out. Hundreds of patrons would bury the weapon deeper. Nobody would ever dig it up.</p> 
               <p>"Some treasures are better left buried." Twilp clambered up the wall to slip through the narrow window into the fresh air. "And some things are worth more than gold."</p>

               <p itemprop="description">This month, the Starfinder Society's second season, the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgks?Starfinder-Society-Year-2">"Year of a Thousand Bites"</a> begins!

               <p>Back in PaizoCon 2018, I had the privilege of a sitting at a table consisting of five Obozaya's and an adopted "Obo-Raia" that went through <a href="/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme"><em>Starfinder Society #1-09: Live Exploration Extreme!</em></a>, as GMed by the scenario's author, Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton. Along with being a fantastic and memorable table, it also helped me select the author for our season opener. Jenny Jarzabski (veteran Starfinder author of <a href="/products/btpy9x0w?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-107-The-Solar-Sortie"><em>Starfinder Society #1-07: The Solar Sortie</em></a> and <a href="/products/btq01vpt?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-129-Honorbound-Emissaries"><em>Starfinder Society #1-29: Honorbound Emissaries</em></a>) showcased her ability to really push the reality TV angle of the scenario. This month's <a href="/products/btq01zn3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-201-Pact-World-Warriors"><em>Starfinder Society #2-01: Pact World Warriors</em></a> takes Jenny's understanding and puts it all into an amazing scenario where the PCs get the chance to play on a variety of game shows to try and improve the Starfinder Society's standing in light of a recent multimedia smear campaign. Beyond the fun theme of the scenario, I'd strong suggest all our players arrange at least one sit down, if only to get an introduction to an important up-and-coming NPC...</p>

               <p><a href="/products/btq01x4r?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1017-On-Sevenfingerss-Sails"><em>Fresh from Pathfinder's Gloomspires</em></a>, author Tom Phillips eagerly picked up June's second scenario and my shameless entreaties to bring his author talent over to Starfinder. Like many scenarios, <a href="/products/btq01zn4?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-202-Waking-the-Past"><em>Starfinder Society #2-02: Waking the Past</em></a>, had its roots planted from casual conversations between members of the Organized Play Team. In this case, I'd just come off playing a popular video game that included a ceaseless force that pursued the player throughout most the game. Combining elements of exploration and survival horror, this month's second scenario really showcases that not all problems can be defeated by pure combat strength—in fact, as a minor spoiler, I'd suggest players for this scenario remember that escape is always an option! From the stories I heard while at Origins, it's safe to say that this is a scenario that makes a lot of long-lasting memories.</p>

               <p>That brings us to the end of this month's preview. Look forward to next month, where we reveal a new introductory quest pack, as well as a higher tier scenario that takes us back into the mysteries of the false moon known as Salvation's End. I can't wait to start delving deeper into our upcoming second season and showing off just exactly where the campaign is heading in the coming months; exciting times ahead, I assure all of you!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>This is one of the largest meta-regions in the book, stretching along the northern coast of Garund from the island of Nuat, across the Obari Ocean and Stonespire Island, to Qadira where Avistan and Casmaron meet. Five nations comprise the Golden Road—Katapesh, Osirion, Qadira, Rahadoum, and Thuvia—and while they all feature wide deserts, they're nevertheless distinct from one another, providing endless inspiration for adventure along trade caravans, teeming bazaars, long-lost pyramids, or hidden oases.</p> 
               <p>In Katapesh, the mysterious Pactmasters maintain their enigmatic rule over the mercantile nation, as implemented by their agent, Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid. In the bazaars of Katapesh, adventurers, collectors, and purveyors of the bizarre can find just about anything they seek, assuming they can effectively barter for it. The nation takes its name from the euphoric drug, pesh, the foundation of the region's black market, and full stats for the drug's refined form are available for players or GMs willing to risk addiction for the pleasure of a little escape. The slavers of Okeno off Katapesh's eastern shore still peddle flesh, despite facing an influx of abolitionist movements on the waters of the Inner Sea and Obari Ocean. While the slave trade has been outlawed in Absalom, it's very much alive in Katapesh, giving liberators and Firebrands a new target in their war for universal freedom.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>In Osirion, Ruby Prince Khemet III has rescinded his policy of welcoming outside explorers to the nation's many ruins, after many of the new discoveries brought more trouble to his land than they brought wealth. In perhaps the most trying event of Osirion's modern history, the Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I rose from his tomb in 4714 to reclaim his ancient empire with a fleet of flying pyramids. Though he was stopped by brave adventurers, upon his defeat, that fleet of pyramids pyramids fell to the ground, causing incredible devastation in population centers like Sothis and peppering the desert with newly unearthed ruins for Osirionologists to explore.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190618-Merab.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190618-Merab_500.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <p>The rise of a new, more capable ruler in Taldor has quieted Satrap Xerbystes II's saber rattling in recent years, but Qadira represents just the eastern tip of the continent-spanning Padishah Empire of Kelesh. Over the millennia, trade and expansionism from the empire have led to many wars and conquests across the Golden Road, including a lengthy rule over Osirion and the religiously-motivated Oath Wars that led Rahadoum to adopt their Laws of Mortality. Though tensions between Qadira and its neighbors may have calmed of late, the nation's military remains under the control of the satrap's vizier, Hebizid Vraj who was appointed by the Padishah Emperor himself, and has the power to overrule the satrap if he leads the nation in directions against the empire's interests. What those interests are and what they may lead to in the future is anyone's guess.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190618-Xerbystes.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190618-Xerbystes_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Illustration by Oksana Federova</p>
               </div> 
               <p>Rahadoum continues its longstanding tradition of eschewing all divine interference by strictly enforcing the Laws of Mortality, which restrict the preaching of religion and the trade of holy texts or symbols. Where other nations might have thriving churches to myriad deities or demigods, the Rahadoumi instead have some of the most advanced schools of arcane magic, science, and philosophy on the Inner Sea. Of special interest to characters who wish to forge their own destinies instead of being pawns to supposedly "higher" powers, the Godless Healing feat allows for augmented healing in the absence of a divine healer.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190618-PureLegion.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190618-PureLegion_360.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <p>To Rahadoum's east, Thuvia stands out for being less a single nation than a confederation of allied city-states. The nation's economy is largely dependent on a single product, the powerful sun orchid elixir, which allows those wealthy enough to purchase a vial extended life and youthful vitality. Though the tradition of alternating which city would host the annual auction for the season's batch of the potent alchemical concoction, recent shifts in the balance of power have some Thuvians worried that the delicate balance may soon come to an end. Agents of all five powerful city-states now advocate for unification into a more traditional nation, though each believes that their city should be the new capital.</p>

               <p>Seven new backgrounds provide new rules options for characters from or associated with the region, allowing members of all ancestries and classes to become black market smugglers, Osirionologists, or secular medics! Furthermore, those adventurers who dabble in the living monolith archetype can transform their bodies into stone in order to better protect the ancient secrets of the region.</p>

               <p>At Origins, there's PACG play in the Franklin Rooms pretty much all the time. If you're here and you haven't seen the new <a href="/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Core Set</em></a> and <a href="/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em></a>, now's your chance to dive in. Plus, you'll be able to play all 4 scenarios of The Fangwood Thieves, the new Season of the Kobolds adventure for Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. (If you've never played PACS before, this is a great place to start!) It's a rollicking good time.</p> 
               <p>I'll be here throughout the weekend, mostly doing my annual nightly broadcast from the Big Bar on 2 with my co-hosts Paul Peterson and Gaby Weidling (remember them?). If you like lots of guests and assorted silliness, tune into the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lonesharkgames" target="_blank">Lone Shark Games Twitch channel</a> each night. Last night's broadcast should already be up!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>And then on Saturday, it's Free RPG Day! As I mentioned in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgki?PACG-Starring-Not-Your-Typical-Goblins">a previous blog</a>, we took this opportunity to write a whole new goblin adventure using the <em>Core Set</em>! <a href="/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes"><em>We Be Heroes?</em></a> is a weird, wild adventure of good-guy gobbos dealing with paladins, undead, and strange chickens. It includes 4 new goblin characters, though you can play it with any of the 159 (!) other PACG characters we've released over the years. You'll like it. Pick it up at any participating store or try it at Origins. If you can't get to one of those locations, though, don't worry—starting July 1, you'll be able to download the FREE PDF or buy a print copy from paizo.com.</p> 
               <p>We're also pleased to announce that <em>We Be Heroes?</em> is officially sanctioned for Pathfinder Adventure Card Society play. Just download this <a href="https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/PZO9500-16-Rules.zip">sanctioning document</a> (218 KB zip/PDF), which describes the adjustments you need to make the adventure PACS-legal. (We will soon be issuing similar sanctioning documents for <em>The Dragon's Demand</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>.)</p> 
               <p>Since We Be Heroes? is for starting characters, it didn't make sense to include roles for our new goblin heroes in that adventure. But we will be releasing them online so you can take them all the way through any Adventure Path—if you can keep them alive, that is. We're doing something very new for these: One of the two roles you can choose for each goblin uses a concept called goblin markers. Here's how they work: Each goblin picks a pattern of marker that's theirs. When various circumstances occur (such as Crimsi examining a barrier or Siathorn stealing an Animal ally from another character), they get to mark their character with one of their goblin markers. Feats allow them to count and spend the markers for all manner of craziness, such as the Kitbasher Crimsi letting a friend examine the top card of a few location decks then move to one of them. (Crimsi's friend will probably take only a small amount of damage in the process; I wouldn't worry about it too much if I were Crimsi.) There are only 7 of each marker in the box, so no goblin can have more than 7—unless you're playing Pizazz, who has a feat that lets him swipe a marker from another goblin to heal himself.</p> 
               <p>It's going to be a fun weekend! Hope to see you at Origins and Free RPG Day!</p>

               <p>I knew it would come for me. My thrice-cursed fate would not be denied: my blood, my birth, and my faith. I knew I would be chosen; my mother all but promised me.</p> 
               <p>"The year thirteen will fall on you, daughter. You cannot prevent it, but you can prepare."</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">Twenty-four black hooves, four iron-rimmed wheels, and fourteen glowing red eyes, the coach and six, the harbinger of my fate, my promise, my doom, glided down the cobbled street toward me without a whisper. The good citizens of Cesca scattered, scuttling into doorways, slamming shutters, scurrying into alleys like terrified rats. I stood and awaited my fate.</p> 
               <p>The ebony coach stopped before me, the driver's burning coal eyes transfixing me like needles pinning a moth in a display. Armor rustled like winter-dead leaves hammered from cold iron as one hand released the reins to delve the driver's cloak. A roll of ebony parchment bound with a blood-red ribbon issued forth, held out in that undying grasp for me.</p> 
               <p>"Your invitation, daughter of Arudora." The voice chilled me like the touch of an icy scalpel.</p> 
               <p>"Of course." I took the invitation in hand, pulled the ribbon, and unrolled the black parchment that sealed my doom. I read, "Marilisa Balcus Arudora," my name, the only words on the page.</p> 
               <p>The armored driver gestured, and the coach's door swung silently open. "Welcome."</p> 
               <p>The midnight coach swallowed me.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Black leather, satin drapes, and pale faces rimed with terror greeted me. I sat and adjusted my skirts. The seat was cold, and the faces colder, six of my kin doomed to the fate we all shared. I only recognized one, a cousin I'd met only once. His eyes took me in with subdued recognition, one hand gripping the head of his walking stick, a silver wolf, teeth bared in rage. The others, two peasants, a tradesman, a merchant, and a trollop, avoided my gaze, resigned to our common fate. A prospect worse than death lurked in their eyes.</p> 
               <p>The coach moved, but I'd not felt it and heard not a sound but the beating of my own heart and tremulous breath. The merchant rocked forward and back, his hands clutched white-knuckled. The trollop withdrew a silver flask from her ample bodice and drew a draught. She caught my eye and flashed a smile.</p> 
               <p>"Drop o' liquid courage, love?" She held out the flask, the scent of brandy heady in the air.</p> 
               <p>"No, thank you." I'd long ago consigned my courage to the flames.</p> 
               <p>"Suit yourself." She drank again and tucked the flask away.</p> 
               <p>"Can't do this...can't do this..." the fidgety merchant muttered.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do shut up, man!" My gentleman cousin eyed him derisively.</p> 
               <p>"Bugger off and leave him be!" one of the peasants snapped, a lip curling back from tobacco-stained teeth.</p> 
               <p>"How dare you speak to—"</p> 
               <p>"Can't do this!" The hysterical merchant drew a stiletto.</p> 
               <p>"Don't!" The word escaped my lips before I could bite it off, but it did no good.</p> 
               <p>The merchant's trembling hand drew a ragged line of crimson across his throat. He cut deep, deep enough to paint the trollop seated across from him with the spray. She swore, fending off his lifeblood with a raised arm. The merchant choked and coughed, shuddering as the torrent slowed.</p> 
               <p>"Bloody fool," my gentleman cousin scoffed. "Death is no escape now."</p> 
               <p>True enough, for as the merchant's blood ceased to flow with the last fluttering beats of his dying heart, only surprise registered on his paling features. His eyes blinked, bloody lips gaping in shock as undeath took him. We could not escape our fate so easily.</p> 
               <p>The trollop withdrew her flask and drained its contents in one greedy draught, her cheeks pale under the cheap rouge and flecks of blood.</p> 
               <p>"Hells and demons," the surly peasant swore, making a sign to ward off evil.</p> 
               <p>"That won't save you either, ignorant fool." My gentleman cousin's nose wrinkled, perhaps at the stench of blood, perhaps in sheer disdain.</p> 
               <p>"Neither will that blade in your cane, sir, enchanted though it be." I don't know why I spoke, but I felt the need to put the pompous ass in his place. "No mortal-forged implement will save you."</p> 
               <p>His eyes narrowed at me. "You seem quite sure of yourself, Marilisa."</p> 
               <p>"I am." I adjusted my skirts again, my hand exploring the folds for my one hope of salvation. Cold metal caressed my palm. "I've known my fate my entire life, Lord Wolthaven. As have you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, and I suppose you've some trick you hope will save you!" He glared at me, dredging courage from anger.</p> 
               <p>"No trick." I gripped my only hope and prayed silently.</p> 
               <p>"Look!" The tradesman pointed out the window at the passing scenery.</p> 
               <p>Ruined buildings, dilapidated cottages, and crumbled towers took on a ghostly radiance, blazing blue with shadows of their former grandeur as we passed through the dead village of Maiserene. I recognized it from my studies. I wondered if anyone outside the carriage could see the apparition or if it existed only for our doomed eyes. Ahead the spectral bridge to our destination coalesced over the dark water of Lake Laroba. Our conveyance paused not as we crossed, silent water roiling beneath us, perhaps hungering for the living or welcoming us to our fate.</p> 
               <p>We plunged through the toothed maw of Bastardhall's gate, the wail of cold iron hinges, gears, and chains a cacophonous greeting. One of the peasants began sobbing. The coach pulled into a vast courtyard and stopped before the grim foyer.</p> 
               <p>Three tall figures awaited our arrival: a woman of pale complexion with white-streaked hair, another woman bearing the sigil of Urgathoa upon her breast, and a hooded shape holding a swaddled bundle in his arms.</p> 
               <p>I knew they had long prepared for this meeting.</p> 
               <p>The carriage door opened and my destiny propelled me forth, my legs steady, teeth clenched against useless screams, and my hand gripping the spike of silver that no mortal hand had forged. The fire of a burning sun scorched my palm as I strode forth to my fate.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Get ready for <a href="http://www.freerpgday.com/" target="_blank">Free RPG Day</a> at retail locations worldwide this Saturday, debuting two great opportunities to play fun adventures and pick up your own free copies at participating game stores. This year Paizo's contributed two RPG products: for Pathfinder the module <a href="/products/btq01x4i?Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-Heroes"><em>We Be Heroes?</em></a> (in which the PCs are heroic goblins helping Lastwall's defenders), and for Starfinder the module <a href="/products/btq01wyj?Starfinder-Skitter-Crash"><em>Skitter Crash</em></a> (in which our plucky skittermanders must escape being mired on a strange planet)! We've attached the download links for the respective sanctioning documents below.</p> 
               <p>You'll find that <em>Skitter Crash</em> functions in basically the same way as Skitter Shot did, though with the 3rd-level pregenerated characters, be aware that the Chronicle sheet is for Tier 3–4.</p> 
               <p>Because production for <em>We Be Heroes?</em> occurred late in the playtest process, that module is written using the latest version of the Pathfinder Playtest rules, which I've linked to for download. However, playing the adventure doesn't award Playtest Points; it instead provides each participant a special Chronicle sheet with several rewards you can apply to a character in the upcoming Second Edition campaign for Pathfinder Society, launching in August 2019. There's no need to report the adventure; just run the adventure, have a good time, pass out the Chronicle sheet, and let people know how to sign up for the organized play programs in anticipation of Pathfinder's second edition.</p> 
               <p>Have a great weekend and excellent Free RPG Day! It's a busy week for the organized play team; Mike and Linda are working on upcoming adventures, while Thursty, Tonya, and I are celebrating the start of Starfinder Society's new year at Origins in Columbus, Ohio!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Very early on in developing the Second Edition campaign for Pathfinder Society, the team agreed that transferring large portions of the First Edition PCs' accomplishments would be disruptive. We wanted to present a level playing field for everyone, beginners and veterans alike. Instead, we looked for ways to provide fun and meaningful ways to recognize your accomplishments from the past 11 years as you're creating characters for the new campaign. We're doing so in a big way through backgrounds.</p> 
               <p>If you checked out the playtest, you'd see that backgrounds in the new edition are quite familiar. Each helps define part of your character's upbringing or past, granting you two ability boosts, training in a specific skill, training in a bonus lore skill, and a skill feat. With few and minor exceptions, all backgrounds grant exactly these benefits, and each PC gains exactly one background, so no one background is necessarily stronger than another. Instead, the differences are in the combination of benefits and storytelling potential.</p> 
               <p>And what potential we have! In 11 years, the Society's accomplished so much, and there's a unique background for each season. All of the backgrounds reflect the Society's accomplishments that year, while also acknowledging the ways that those accomplishments might have inspired and trained new agents. So long as you have earned credit for 5 or more scenarios from a particular season (as a player or GM), you're free to use the associated background for any of your PCs. And if there's a season for which you haven't met that target, don't worry; you're welcome to play some more First Edition scenarios at any time to qualify later.</p> 
               <p>Let's look at a few of these to see what's in store. Keep in mind that there are broad, basic, and slightly ambiguous spoilers for events in Seasons 1, 3, 4, and 9 ahead.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <h3>Shadow War Survivor <span style="float:right;">Background</span></h3> 
                <p>Countless factions have fought for influence in Absalom for millennia, and for decades these groups worked through the Pathfinder Society to better control the City at the Center of the World. Perhaps you were ones of these agents who clashed with other operatives during the so-called Shadow War. Or you might have been an unintended victim of these clandestine clashes, inspiring you to join the Society and stop the conflict from within. Whatever the reason, navigating the Shadow War has left you politically savvy and informed.</p> 
                <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.</p> 
                <p>You're trained in the Society skill and the Absalom Lore skill. You gain the Streetwise skill feat.</p> 
                <p><b>Special</b>: You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 1 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p> 
                <h3>Ruby Phoenix Enthusiast <span style="float:right;">Background</span></h3> 
                <p>Named for the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin, the Ruby Phoenix Tournament occurs once every 10 years in Goka and attracts extraordinary talent from across the world. You might have begun training for the tournament but never participated, or perhaps you entered the tournament only to be defeated by (and inspired to join) the Pathfinder Society. Either way, your dedicated training prepares you for the rigors of the adventuring lifestyle.</p> 
                <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.</p> 
                <p>You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Gladiatorial Lore skill. You gain the Combat Climber skill feat. In addition, you gain access to one of the following uncommon monk weapons: kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, or temple sword.</p> 
                <p><b>Special</b>: You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 3 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p> 
                <h3>Thassilonian Delver <span style="float:right;">Background</span></h3> 
                <p>As archaeologists uncovered and explored ever-larger numbers of Thassilonian ruins, you were among the eager explorers who sought out the Runelords' ancient secrets. You may have been the apprentice to another Pathfinder who perished on an expedition, leaving you their discoveries and notes. Or perhaps you explored several of these sites yourself, quickly learning to parse the arcane secrets before lest the eldritch magic extinguish your life.</p> 
                <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p> 
                <p>You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Thassilonian History Lore skill. You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat. Add Thassilonian to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p> 
                <p><b>Special</b>: You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 4 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p> 
                <h3>Faction Opportunist <span style="float:right;">Background</span></h3> 
                <p>As the Pathfinder Society's influence has grown, so too did many of its factions become wealthier and more powerful. These factions relied on a host of Pathfinders and independent operatives alike to establish trade networks, shape national politics, and more, and you were among the specialists who helped one of these factions realize its goal. These events provided you countless opportunities to develop your own contacts and negotiating skills.</p> 
                <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p> 
                <p>You're trained in the Diplomacy skill, plus either Guild Lore, Heraldry Lore, or Mercantile Lore. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.</p> 
                <p><b>Special</b>: You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 9 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>So as advertised, these are all granting ability boosts, a skill, a Lore, and a skill feat. There are also a few flavorful perks that don't noticeably increase the power level but do help a PC better reflect the background experiences. In this way, Ruby Phoenix Enthusiast gets to walk away with a kama souvenir, the Thassilonian can pick Thassilonion as one of their bonus languages, and the Faction Opportunist gets to choose one of three Lore skills to better reflect the full range of faction-related deeds from Season 9.</p> 
               <p>We hope to see these backgrounds in action, continuing the memorable First Edition stories into the exciting future of Second Edition gaming!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">One of the most wide-reaching events to become the baseline assumption of the Pathfinder setting between first and second editions is the Whispering Tyrant's escape from his centuries-old prison to once again terrorize the nations of the living. The specifics of how he breaks free from Gallowspire and the direct results of that escape play out in the <a href="/tyrantsgrasp">Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path</a>, which wraps up next month with <em>Midwives to Death</em>. Needless to say, things for the lands on Lake Encarthan's western coast are NOT. GOOD.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">One of the most wide-reaching events to become the baseline assumption of the Pathfinder setting between first and second editions is the Whispering Tyrant's escape from his centuries-old prison to once again terrorize the nations of the living. The specifics of how he breaks free from Gallowspire and the direct results of that escape play out in the <a href="/tyrantsgrasp">Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path</a>, which wraps up next month with <em>Midwives to Death</em>. Needless to say, things for the lands on Lake Encarthan's western coast are NOT. GOOD.</p>

               <p>As we've hinted at with the name of the most recent set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures, <a href="/pathfinderbattles/ruinsoflastwall"><em>Ruins of Lastwall</em></a> (available now!), the Knights of Ozem who stood vigil over Gallowspire since the Shining Crusade met an unfortunate end, and are now scattered throughout the Inner Sea region, licking their wounds and trying to muster support for taking the battle back to the Isle of Terror, where Tar-Baphon has made his new headquarters. For more information on what became of Lastwall, check out the Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path. Without giving too many spoilers of the whys and hows, I'll just say that what was formerly Lastwall is now the undead-haunted realm known as the Gravelands. Things sound totally awesome there, right?</p>

               <p>To the south, the conflict between the nations of Molthune and Nirmathas has cooled considerably, thanks to the events of the Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path and the advent of a larger threat in the region. Despite the ceasefire between the warring nations, tensions remain high, and agents of the Whispering Way would certainly love to see the people of both nations return to fighting one another rather than directing their military efforts toward the armies of the undead.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190611-DeadlyRivalry.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190611-DeadlyRivalry_500.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <p>The other notable result of the Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path was the establishment of a new hobgoblin nation in the Mindspin Mountains. General Azaersi rules Oprak from the newly founded capital of Hunthul, but the mountains of Golarion's surface aren't the full extent of the fledgling nation's territory. Thanks to a powerful artifact giving the hobgoblins access to the natural resources of the Plane of Earth, the kingdom also stretches into the elemental planes. Azaersi's expansionist tendencies have been redirected toward mercantile growth, and if she gets her way, Oprak could soon become more of an economic threat to its neighbors than it is a military threat.</p>

               <p>With the fall of Lastwall and the rise of the Whispering Tyrant's third period of rule, the orcs of Belkzen have broken from tradition and refused to rally to the lich's side. That places them in the unfortunate role of being among the first bulwarks against the undead's expansion beyond the Gravelands and will try the governing abilities of the region's new ruler, Overlord Ardax the White-Hair. I'm sure a nation of disparate orc tribes will do fine in uniting to quell the burgeoning threat to their south and east. What could go wrong?</p> 
               <p>Players whose characters hail from this region will find eight new backgrounds including cursed family, onyx trader, and Whispering Way scion, as well as the Lastwall sentry archetype!</p>

               <p>Hello! My name is Chad, and I'm here to talk to you about converting to the Church of... wait, wrong spiel. This is about converting existing PACG materials to the new rules and conventions of the <a href="/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Core Set</em></a> and beyond. The <em>Core Set</em> rulebook includes some guidelines for conversion already, on page 26.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-RulebookPg26.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-RulebookPg26_360.jpeg" alt=""></a> 
               </div> 
               <p itemprop="description">Here, I'll talk about the rhyme and reason for conversion guidelines, and also discuss some new, more specific changes from the new Conversion Guide we just released today. (There's a link to it at the bottom of this blog, but we'd love it if you finish this blog introducing it before you click!) I'm going to touch on several high-level topics in no particular order; let's get started!</p> 
               <p>With the release of the <em>Core Set</em>, we were given a chance to streamline the game a bit and clean up both card and rules text, to remove murky or confusing corner cases. As you probably know, we knew right from the start that we wanted to maintain compatibility with all the previously published Adventure Paths and Class Decks, but we were ok with making some high-level changes, just so long as we could easily explain to everyone how things should be updated—ideally without resorting to a gigantic list of individual card changes.</p> 
               <h2>Recovery</h2> 
               <p>The first of these changes I want to talk about here is <strong>recovery</strong>. When we launched the PACG with <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> in 2013, there were a few areas of the game that could get a little more complicated than we'd hoped. (Who would have thought that adapting a tabletop roleplaying game with thousands of pages of rules and an active human moderator to a card game could lead to complexity?) To help navigate these waters, we eventually shared our <a href="/threads/rzs2q7r0?Some-Thoughts-After-1500-Pathfinder-ACG-Threads">guiding principles</a>.</p> 
               <p>Unfortunately, there was one pretty common situation where it seemed like the principles didn't entirely agree. It had to do with playing cards during an encounter when the card played wanted some extra steps for resolution. This includes nearly all spells, as well as a smattering of effects across other parts of the game. The issue is basically "What do I do with these cards that are ‘in flight'? Do I stop what I'm doing and resolve them, or hold them in abeyance while I finish the task? In the meantime, are these cards in my hand, in my discards, or something else?" The vast majority of the time, things work out exactly the same either way, but when things get really tight (usually because your deck is low and the bane is especially mean), suddenly you can find situations where you really care precisely where those cards are at specific points in time.</p> 
               <p>Our answer to this issue is recovery. When cards that need these extra steps are played, now they go into a special, designated place (so you're no longer wondering where they are), and then they're processed at the end of the current turn. This last part also helps with overall game flow, because the next player rarely needs to wait to start their turn while others are doing recovery. As a nice side effect, it lets us clarify and simplify the wording on spells:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Cure.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Cure_180.jpeg" alt=""></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Cure.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Cure_180.jpeg" alt=""></a> 
                <p>More room for art, more functionality, <em>and</em> clearer wording. Win!</p> 
               </div> 
               <p>Using the former approach, we would tell you to discard the spell, which to most people means "put it in your discards." Then, after playing it, you'd check to see if something happened to make it go somewhere else. Internally, I called this the "banish-discard-or-maybe-recharge" effect, and when that mouthful is the shorthand, you know you don't actually have a winner. That said, when people were learning the game, they'd often go through the process of seeing spells, and then saying "My character isn't a spellcaster, so I don't care about these cards at all...", and then follow that with "wait a minute, I can use these spells as one-shot effects. They're like scrolls!" (In game design, when you can help new players ignore a chunk of the game while learning and later come to understand that it can help them after all, it's nearly always a good thing.)</p> 
               <p>Since we'd been playing with these concepts for many moons, it was clear to us what to do, and thankfully, it was also clear to most of you, most of the time. <em>But</em>... What happens if there's a bane that buries cards from your discards, or counts the cards in your hand? What about a location effect that takes cards that would be banished and instead shuffles them into the location? What about a scenario power that forbids you from recharging cards? As we (and you!) made more and more interesting, varied, special powers, the answer "it works out the same either way" started being untrue more and more often. Eventually, we resolved these questions in an explicit way, but that also required a pretty deep understanding of the game, and practically speaking, usually required one to review the FAQ/errata with a hawk-sharp eye.</p> 
               <p>Starting with Core and <a href="/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a>, spells just tell you how to play them as if they were scrolls, a usage available to everyone. The rules tell you "Hey, after you wring the juicy goodness from that card, just toss it into your ‘clean it up at the end of the turn' pile, and go on about your business."</p> 
               <p>Once we'd implemented this for spells, we also pushed it through to alchemical goodies, which have more prominence from now on thanks to Fumbus, the new iconic Goblin Alchemist. We think this approach is cleaner (that is, fewer murky rules corners) and often results in shorter, clearer wording, so we're also going to use it on other things with similar functionality.</p> 
               <h3>Repetition: the Key to Comedy... and to Bad Gameplay</h3> 
               <p>That gets me to the other big impetus for recovery, something near and dear to my heart as a game designer: avoiding repetitive play. This part is good medicine for making the game healthier in general, and like other medications, it's sometimes a bit bitter, so prepare yourself. There are several ways to express this principle. The one we talk about during PACG development is a statement Mike stole from designer Jonathan Tweet: "Never pay the player to do what you don't want them to do."</p> 
               <p>I'm talking about <strong>repetitive play</strong>—i.e., a situation where game design allows a player to be effective just doing the same thing over and over again. In a game with character- and deck-building elements like PACG, I'm talking specifically about playing the same card repeatedly.</p> 
               <p>In the short term, this can seem great. You get to use your cool, powerful effect every time, and you're mostly flying through the scenario. Over time, though, it's usually bad for the game. You start to view every challenge as a spike to hit with your sledgehammer. You mostly stop caring about new cards that you see, because they're not your sledgehammer (rarely, you find a better sledgehammer, but that's not enough for a bunch of reasons). You stop making decisions because the answer is always "sledgehammer." Sometimes, your sledgehammer takes you all the way to ultimate success, and sometimes it crashes down around you because you run into a sledgehammer-proof wall, but neither outcome is much fun. In general, the job of the game designer is to create challenges for the players to overcome and opportunities for their choices to matter. The sledgehammer is bad for both, so we try to make sure we don't make them. In other words, we try not to create situations where the players get a payoff for always using the same singular tool.</p> 
               <p>This comes up in the concept of recovery (no, I didn't forget). To make this a bit more concrete, let's talk about spells and spellcasters (if you've played a PACG alchemist, you should recognize everything I'm about to say). There are character builds that let you play a spell and then get it back. If you get it back "pretty soon," that's usually ok; you invest in a few different options, and you choose whichever one gives you the most fun and the best chance of overall success at any one point. Awesome. If you get it back "right away," that's less ok. If you get it back "immediately," that quite frequently leads to repetitive play. No bueno.</p> 
               <p>I'm sure that some of you have seen this before in PACG, the Pathfinder RPG, or other games. At first, it seems neat and exciting, but most of the time it becomes boring quickly. Sometimes it leads to an arms race, or a table agreement to soft-ban certain combos, or an update that rebalances relative options. For our cooperative game with physical cards, we spend most of our preventative effort avoiding the problem up-front, and occasionally errata things later (I'm looking at you, <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gk#v5748eaic9rtc">RotR Restoration spell</a>!). In this case, recovery provides us with a useful general tool to avoid "playing the same spell/potion in every encounter." By moving the opportunity to get the card back to the end of the round, we avoid a whole swath of bad-gameplay options.</p> 
               <p>This impacts some pre-Core characters, in that there were ways to build them such that they could potentially play the same spell over and over again within a turn. In general, that ability is removed by the Core rules, which does sometimes hurt the raw effectiveness of those characters. Most of those characters are still playable, and we believe they'll be more fun in the world with recovery. Witches and alchemists need some extra help, though.</p> 
               <p>For witches, recovery interacted badly with temporarily taking their familiars out of play. We were able to use proficiencies and markers to solve the concern. Alchemists are a bit more complicated, as they each have specific wording that resists the creation of general guidelines. During testing, people had little trouble "doing the right thing"—it was just the particular wording that got tricky. While we were adjusting these powers, we noticed that sometimes the former wording had impacts beyond what was appropriate—the powers were turning out too broad, getting things that didn't fit or feel right for the characters. Since we needed to add specific wording for each character anyway, we took the opportunity to clean up some of these concerns. Bottom line, these adjusted alchemist characters aren't always exact mechanical equivalents to their former selves, but we feel that they're a better fit for the character concepts, and the changes result in better gameplay. If we happened to shut down your favorite alchemist "combo" exploit (*cough* Hi, Liz! *cough*), I'm sorry, and you're welcome.</p> 
               <p>It's possible that we'll need to make further small adjustments to other characters to account for recovery, but we feel that most are fine. With that in mind, if you find another character that you feel is severely impacted, please bring it to our attention, and we'll take a look. Thanks in advance!</p> 
               <h2>Proficiency</h2> 
               <p>The next big change I want to talk about is an expansion of the concept of <strong>proficiency</strong>. Proficiencies have been with us since the beginning, where we had just three: Light Armors, Heavy Armors, and Weapons. We picked this set to model the proficiencies of Pathfinder, but with the upcoming changes to proficiencies in the new edition of the RPG, we decided to broaden the concept. Moving forward, there are more proficiencies in the game, and they have an expanded role. Characters can be proficient with card types and with traits. This lets us make characters that are proficient with Alchemical things (including Alchemical items and armors, but not ALL items or armors). Or Arcane things (including spells and wands), or spells (getting both Arcane and Divine spells, but not wands or staves).</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-HeavyShield.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-HeavyShield_180.jpeg" alt=""></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-HornOfBattleClarity.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-HornOfBattleClarity_180.jpeg" alt=""></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-SeekingLongbow.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-SeekingLongbow_180.jpeg" alt=""></a> 
                <p>Better if you know how to take full advantage.</p> 
               </div> 
               <p>On the other end of this change is an expansion of what it means to be proficient. We still can add special effects to cards for proficient wielders, and you're sure to see that going forward. We've also generalized a concept from existing spellcasters and Alchemists that proficiency is what lets you keep a card that would otherwise be banished, like a spell or a potion. This expansion of the concept of proficiency is a better match for the new Pathfinder RPG, and it's incredibly flavorful. For example, bards can have proficiency in Instrument (we approximated this before, but it's cleaner now). Varian can have proficiency in Sword, Drunken Master Sajan can have proficiency in Liquid, and Yoon can be proficient with Fire. The Conversion Guide adds new proficiencies to two dozen characters.</p> 
               <h3>Light Armors</h3> 
               <p>One of the changes to proficiencies we made was to consolidate armor proficiency down from Light and Heavy Armors into just Armor. At the same time, we rebalanced armor boons so that they're more useful for all characters, with extra perks kicking in for characters that are proficient. In a sense, you can imagine that there are now two levels of proficiency with armor rather than three. We think this will result in a better balance for this not-exactly-beloved card type, and in testing, the new approach to armor and proficiency was almost universally liked, so we're optimistic that you'll like it also.</p> 
               <p>This change created one of the most significant conversion issues for pre-Core characters: what to do about characters with armor power feats. In general, our approach for conversion is to make a few general changes, because nobody loves huge lists of card changes—at least, I don't. We looked at several options, and here's where we came down:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>Characters and roles that have a feat for Light Armor proficiency should be given an additional hand size feat instead.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>This is probably the fuzziest change we've introduced via conversion, and it might result in a few odd character builds. We settled on this approach because it gives us a general adaptation, and it's a generally useful feat. The change to gaining role cards one adventure earlier means that characters have fewer power feats that they're "forced" to take on their character cards, so if you really dislike hand size feats, you should just take a power feat on your role card—something that you probably wanted anyway.</p> 
               <h2>Closed Locations</h2> 
               <p>Another big rules change has to do with closed locations. In Core and Curse, locations lost their back "closed" state and gained a rule that cleans them up as you go, pushing characters to move and encouraging interaction in the game in general. In the <em>Core Set</em> rulebook's Transition Guide, we tell you to just ignore effects involving interaction with closed locations. This solution proved to be controversial, I think for a few reasons. We're introducing a different way to handle these that I think will help address some of the concerns, and I'll try to talk about some of the others after. The idea is simple: use the pre-Core rules with pre-Core locations and use the new rules with new locations. More precisely:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>When you would put a location card back into the vault, flip it over. If it does not have a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game logo on the back, it stays in play and local characters do not automatically move. Closed locations are automatically guarded.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>This change supersedes the page 26 rule for these locations, and we think it will prove to be less disruptive for older Adventure Paths, especially those from organized play. (If you play a homebrew scenario with a mix of old and new locations, we recommend banishing the new locations and flipping the old locations.)</p> 
               <p>One common bit of feedback that we've heard about the new rule for closed locations is that established players don't understand why we changed it. In other words, "it's not broke; why did you fix it?" This is a pretty broad question, so my response will also be broad, but I hope it will help nonetheless. My answer is threefold:</p> 
               <ol>
                <li>It was <em>slightly</em> broken.</li> 
                <li>Rarely, it was <em>confusingly</em> broken.</li> 
                <li>It makes a lot of small things a little simpler and a little better.</li>
               </ol> 
               <p>For the first point, it mostly comes down to "You could learn to accept it, but it was often confusing to people learning the game." The second point has to do with a small set of tricky corner cases. Behind the curtain, we use bug-tracking software to deal with issues, errata, etc., and I've been told that the change to banish closed locations immediately closed a shocking number of them. While it may not be obvious, this is good for everyone simply because it lets people spend more time focusing on things more likely to create more fun. The third issue is sometimes part of the other two, and sometimes all its own concern—moving forward, being able to say just "location" rather than "open location" seems like a small change, but when wording around it gets complicated, it still helps. (The move from "temporarily closed" to "guarded" is another such improvement.)</p> 
               <p>In addition to more straightforward wording, the change has the effect of grouping people together more as the game moves toward conclusion. While older scenarios made use of the former approach, this new approach gives us better tools for managing the tension in the game, creating more dramatic effects, some of which comes from increased challenge. At the same time, it increases the impact of player choices during the game—the decisions about which locations to close and when become more important.</p> 
               <h2>...And the Rest</h2> 
               <p>While most of the changes in the Conversion Guide relate directly to recovery, proficiency, and closed locations, there are a few things related to smaller changes, like the one character who cares about cards that don't have adventure deck numbers, and the one monster that cares about the Basic and Elite trait. There really aren't many of those, though.</p> 
               <p><a href="/pathfinder/cardgame/conversion"><strong>Now go ahead and check out the Conversion Guide!</strong></a> It's entirely possible (read: likely) that there are obscure corner cases that we haven't yet found; when we (or you) find them, we'll update the guide, and maybe even write another blog post on the topic. For now, we're all very excited to have you all get a chance to play with the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>. Thanks!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Selik slouched along at the back of the party with Boret and the other archers. "Stupid crusader. Why is he even here? We don't need him. Our god has returned and reunited us with the rest of the clan."</p> 
               <p>Boret grunted. "Dolok Darkfur is a power, no doubt, and without his leadership, we'd still be hiding in the forest. Even so... Ramnos has more practical demon-fighting experience than the rest of us put together. You'll be glad we have his sword on our side when we storm that keep."</p> 
               <p>Their god—a massive, bear-like creature whose bright feathers and intelligent eyes made it impossible to mistake him for an ordinary animal—led the group, flanked by that irritating crusader and the clan's god-caller, Nelket.</p> 
               <p>Selik spat. "The other crusaders left Sarkoris when the Worldwound closed. I don't trust him. Why is he still here? Shouldn't he be riding to the soft southern lands with the rest of his people?"</p> 
               <p>Boret snorted. "The crusaders only turned south because the Whispering Tyrant stirs. Things aren't so soft there."</p> 
               <p>"But why—"</p> 
               <p>"By the Stag Mother's antlers, boy, go ask him yourself if you want to know his reasons! The crusader doesn't confide in me."</p> 
               <p>Selik glared toward the front of the group, his eyes widening when the crusader stopped walking until Selik reached him, then fell into step beside him. "I could not help but overhear your question." His accent was atrocious. "I remain because I took an oath to cleanse your ancestral lands of the Abyssal taint. Some think because the land no longer bleeds demons, our work is done, but I disagree." He paused. "Also, I am very good at killing demons."</p> 
               <p>"Braggart."</p> 
               <p>Ramnos laughed, a sound that irritated Selik to his marrow. "I prefer to think of it as clear-eyed self-regard. I know you are angry, Selik. I don't blame you. Your people have suffered as much as anyone. But I wish your anger wouldn't settle on me. Not all outsiders are invaders. I've developed great affection for your people."</p> 
               <p>"You mean for my aunt."</p> 
               <p>"Starting with your aunt, let us say," Ramnos agreed.</p> 
               <p>"You'll never be part of the Farheaven Clan," Selik muttered. There were precious few of his people left, but Selik bristled at the idea of outsiders traveling with them, or, gods forbid, marrying in.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps not. But—"</p> 
               <p>"We're here," the god-caller said, her voice somehow seeming to whisper in Selik's ear. He stepped away from Ramnos, joining the others on a low rise that looked down on the grim expanse of Carlhon Keep, once home to men and women, now a stronghold of demons, with black clouds swirling unnaturally above its towers and walls.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190606-BrokenLands.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190606-BrokenLands_500.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <p>Selik had grown up in the forests and fields with members of his clan and had spent barely any time under roofs of wood and stone. Carlhon Keep was vast beyond his imaginings. Could his people really live there, if they removed the demonic infestation? "The walls are glowing," Selik whispered.</p> 
               <p>"Demonic runes." Ramnos sighed. "Those walls may need to come down entirely. The taint runs deep into the stone. The lightning worries me more, though." Sick green flashes lit the dark clouds.</p> 
               <p>Dolok Darkfur rose, towering on his hind legs, and Selik could not deny the stirrings of awe within him. With their god at their head, how could they fail? "I fear no lightning," Darkfur said, his voice all rumble and strength.</p> 
               <p>"The rest of us must." Ramnos pointed with his sword to tiny specks moving among the dark clouds and green flashes of electricity. "Those are wrath demons. Vile things. They do a dance—"</p> 
               <p>"They dance?" Selik scoffed. He made a mocking little pirouette.</p> 
               <p>"Their dance brings ruin," Ramnos said. "Few who witness it survive. The demons dance not for pleasure, but as a ritual, to call down evil upon their enemies. That lightning... I fear the fiends know we are coming, and have begun to dance our deaths."</p> 
               <p>"They can't dance if someone bites their legs off," Darkfur growled, and then rushed forward on all fours toward the keep, Nelket and the clan's warriors hurrying after him, swords and hammers drawn.</p> 
               <p>Ramnos watched them run. "It's a good thing we discussed the plan in advance. Ready your bow, Selik."</p> 
               <p>"What?"</p> 
               <p>The crusader pointed again. The specks in the air were getting bigger, and a few swooped toward them. Selik gasped, fumbled with his bow, and nocked one of the blessed arrows. He was one of the best archers in the clan, famed for his ability to shoot birds on the wing, but the things coming for them weren't birds—they were a grotesque cross between men and vultures, trailing feathers and dust.</p> 
               <p>"Better if they do not come close," Ramnos said. "They spew a poisonous cloud."</p> 
               <p>Selik took a breath, sighted, and loosed. The arrow sailed true and caught the approaching demon in its right wing just as it dove toward Darkfur. The demon spun, its other wing clipping the ground, and went down in a sprawl of feathers. The god paused briefly over it to deliver a killing blow, and then loped on. "I got it!" Selik crowed. Other demons fell to the holy arrows loosed by Boret and the other archers, and the rest of the demons in the air retreated back toward the keep.</p> 
               <p>"They were focused on your god, and didn't consider the rest of you threats before," Ramnos said. "Now, they do. Come on!" He rushed forward, and Selik followed, blood singing with something like the thrill of the hunt, but even more potent.</p> 
               <p>The archers stopped within bowshot of the walls and loosed arrows at the twisted figures on the battlements, protecting the warriors in the vanguard. To Selik's annoyance, the crusader stayed by his side, acting as a spotter and calling out targets—he seemed to know which demons were the equivalent of officers, and once Selik had killed a few of those, the lowlier fiends broke and fled.</p> 
               <p>Darkfur reached the keep's gate and rose up, roaring, to slam against the barrier. The runes on the walls flared and burned brighter. The warriors joined their god, battering the gates with their weapons, but the god was a siege engine in his own right, and soon the dark wood began to splinter and crack.</p> 
               <p>"Here." The crusader offered Selik a knife—almost big enough to be a small sword—with a blade that reflected more light than it should have beneath those clouded skies. "Your bow will be less use inside."</p> 
               <p>Selik reached out, scowled, paused, then snatched up the weapon. It felt good in his hand, thrumming with power. "Why are you giving me this? Why are you sticking so close to me at all?"</p> 
               <p>"It is... possible... I told your aunt I would look out for you," Ramnos said, "while she and the other warriors stay close to your god."</p> 
               <p>Selik stomped his foot. "I am not a child in need of a nursemaid!"</p> 
               <p>Ramnos chuckled another infuriating chuckle. "That is fortunate, as I would make a poor nursemaid. I am, however, a capable fighter, and would be honored to stand by your side."</p> 
               <p>"I don't need your help," Selik said. "I can find glory on my own!"</p> 
               <p>"I do not doubt it, but she made me swear an oath." He shrugged. "An oath is an oath."</p> 
               <p>"I don't—"</p> 
               <p>The crusader suddenly shouted and shoved Selik aside as a vulture demon leapt down on them from the battlements. The crusader and the demon went down in a jumble of limbs and feathers, claws and blades, and Selik froze. Shooting arrows at distant shapes was one thing, but now the demon was here, at his feet, stinking and writhing and vile and terrifying. He froze for a long moment, then looked around for help, but the rest of the clan was disappearing into a crack in the gates.</p> 
               <p>Selik shook himself, raised his new blade, and waited for his moment. When he was sure he wouldn't hit Ramnos by mistake, he struck, plunging his blade into the back of the demon's birdlike head. It screamed, the wound smoking, and Ramnos rolled out from under and struggled to his feet. The crusader plunged his sword through the monster's back, ending its shrieks. He plucked a moldy feather from his hair and rubbed at a long scratch on his cheek, but smiled. "You see? You are the one looking after me."</p> 
               <p>Selik nodded. "That's right. You're... lucky I was here."</p> 
               <p>"I never could take care of myself alone. That is why I joined an order of knights in the first place." Ramnos nodded toward the cracked gates. "Shall we teach these demons to dance properly?"</p> 
               <p>"Dancing is soft," Selik muttered, but he followed Ramnos into the keep as lightning began to lance down from the clouds all around.</p> 
               <p>The crusader's answering laughter somehow annoyed him less this time.</p>

               <p>Unlike Absalom, which we examined last week, there have been several adventure paths and standalone modules set in the Broken Lands whose outcomes we've canonically codified into the second edition status quo. Among these are Iron Gods, Kingmaker, and Wrath of the Righteous.</p> 
               <p>In Numeria, the Technic League has fallen from power, leaving Black Sovereign, Kevoth-Kul to kick his addiction to the mind-muddling drugs they'd been feeding him for years all on his own. What erratic behavior may come from the throes of withdrawal, and what political factions may vie to replace the league as the power behind the throne remains to be seen. Perhaps the adherents of the new goddess, Casandalee, will play a role?</p>

               <p>In the River Kingdoms, a new nation rose in the Stolen Lands (conveniently left unnamed so that the kingdom you created in your Kingmaker campaign doesn't invalidate canon) and overtook Pitax.</p> 
               <p>In neighboring Brevoy, a king left at the altar has brought the lands of Issia and Rostland closer to war than ever before. Meanwhile, the previously abandoned and sealed Skywatch presents a new mystery for adventurers uninterested in the feuds of the nation's noble houses.</p>

               <p>Queen Galfrey of Mendev, kept alive with sun orchid elixir to ensure constant leadership against the agents of the Abyss, has been given a well-earned retirement, and has left the nation in the capable hands of Chancellor Irahai. The end of the Mendevian Crusades, however, has left the nation without purpose or common threat, and the chancellor has her work cut out for her in unifying the people to foster a national culture long overshadowed by the threat of war and legions of foreign crusaders calling the northern land home.</p>

               <p>In what was formerly the Worldwound—closed when mythic heroes defeated the demon lord Deskari—demons still lay claim to the tainted wasteland. While before they could count on endless reinforcements from the heart of the Abyss, the surviving demons and cultists are now cut off from their home plane and desperate to survive. The native Sarkorians who once called the land home have begun to return and reclaim their ancestral homeland, but they won't find its current inhabitants particularly welcoming. With the help of remnant crusaders not yet turned south to face the rising threat of the Whispering Tyrant and the strange outsiders that the Sarkorians call their gods, perhaps they can heal the Sarkoris Scar and make it into a stable, fertile land once again.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>In Razmiran, once merely a River Kingdom and now a nation in its own right, life continues as it did before the Whispering Tyrant's escape, its citizens taking solace in the knowledge that their land is protected by a benevolent deity, Razmir. The Living God has not opposed the Whispering Tyrant and a constant stream of "donated" corpses to the lich's armies has ensured a tenuous peace between the two powers.</p> 
               <p>This chapter of the <em>Lost Omens World Guide</em> presents seven new character backgrounds and the Aldori duelist archetype, which allows player characters to master the iconic dueling style of Brevoy's Aldori swordlords!</p>

               <p>On Thursday, be sure to check out the second in our Tales of Lost Omens series of flash fiction, written by veteran Pathfinder Tales author Tim Pratt, who previously explored the region in the pages of the novels <em>Liar's Blade</em> and <em>Reign of Stars</em>. Next week, we'll look at the Eye of Dread along the shores of Lake Encarthan, where the shroud of undeath has once again fallen upon the world.</p>
