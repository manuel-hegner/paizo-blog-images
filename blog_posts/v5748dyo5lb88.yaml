  \ Regional Coordinators—Apply Now!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 2, 2010</p>\
  \ \n   <p>At long last the time has come to open the doors to the wide world of\
  \ Pathfinder Society Regional Coordinators. This plan has been a long time coming\
  \ and thanks to years of player and GM feedback, I think we now have a plan in place\
  \ to turn over some of the responsibilities for organizing and growing Pathfinder\
  \ Society to local and regional volunteers, many of whom have already been doing\
  \ so since the beginning.</p> \n   <p>A few fine-print notes before we get started:</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>1. The Pathfinder Society Organized Play Regional Coordinator\
  \ is a volunteer position. Regional coordinators are not Paizo Publishing employees.\
  \ They are not official representatives of the company. Applying for the volunteer\
  \ position of regional coordinator means you acknowledge these restrictions.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>2. A Pathfinder Society Organized Play Regional Coordinator must be willing\
  \ and able to fulfill a list of monthly volunteer duties as noted below.</p> \n\
  \    <p>3. A Pathfinder Society Organized Play Regional Coordinator must always\
  \ strive to act in a professional, positive, and outgoing manner when functioning\
  \ in their capacity as volunteers for Paizo Publishing.</p> \n    <p>4. You must\
  \ be 18 years of age or older and you must be willing to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement\
  \ (NDA) with Paizo Publishing.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Assuming you're still\
  \ on board, here's the regional coordinator volunteer position in greater detail:</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <h2>What is a Pathfinder Society Organized Play Regional\
  \ Coordinator?</h2> \n    <p>A regional coordinator is a local and regional organizer\
  \ and point of contact for Paizo Publishing's worldwide organized play campaign,\
  \ Pathfinder Society.</p> \n    <h2>Regional Coordinator Volunteer Duties and Expectations</h2>\n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>1. Organize a minimum of <b>two</b> Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play convention or game store appearances per month in your local or\
  \ regional area of responsibility.</p> \n     <p>2. Attend PaizoCon or Gen Con and\
  \ work for Paizo at one (or both) of those conventions annually. Non-USA regional\
  \ coordinators will be expected to attend large local conventions to be named later.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>3. Maintain and update monthly a full report of local game stores including\
  \ contact information, manager's name, what Paizo products they carry, and whether\
  \ or not they're running Pathfinder Society Organized Play events (with or without\
  \ your assistance).</p> \n     <p>4. Build a positive rapport with all local game\
  \ store managers and employees.</p> \n     <p>5. Provide the campaign coordinator\
  \ with frequent feedback from game stores, volunteers, and players in your local\
  \ area or region of responsibility.</p> \n     <p>6. Be a Paizo Publishing product\
  \ expert. Familiarize yourself with all of our product lines and be comfortable\
  \ talking about all of them.</p> \n     <p>7. Game Master a minimum of <b>one</b>\
  \ Pathfinder Society Organized Play session per month.</p> \n     <p>8. Participate\
  \ daily on the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Organized Play messageboards</a> and on the private Regional\
  \ Coordinator messageboard.</p> \n     <p>9. Build and maintain monthly an email\
  \ list of local volunteers.</p> \n     <p>10. To the best of your ability, ensure\
  \ that all Pathfinder Society Organized Play sessions run in your local area or\
  \ region of responsibility are reported and reported accurately.</p> \n     <p>11.\
  \ Be the go-to contact for your local area or region of responsibility; assist local\
  \ game days, game clubs, conventions, or any other such group wanting a Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play presence at their event.</p> \n     <p>12. Ensure that\
  \ all Pathfinder Society Organized Play events in your local area or region of responsibility\
  \ are entered into the event-finder at <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfindersociety\"\
  >paizo.com/pathfindersociety</a>.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <header>\n     Rewards\
  \ for Pathfinder Society Organized Play Regional Coordinators\n    </header>\n \

  \ including free badges, a portion of a hotel room, booth vouchers, and possible\
  \ product rewards. In order to receive the free attendance, the regional coordinator\
  \ must arrange his or her own travel to and from show, must provide for his or her\
  \ own food, and must volunteer for a minimum of eight slots at Gen Con and a minimum\
  \ of four slots at PaizoCon.</p> \n     <p>2. Pathfinder Society Organized Play\

  \ \n     <p>5. Messageboard tag in the Pathfinder Society messageboards: <b>Pathfinder\

  \ posting on the Pathfinder Society messageboards.)</p> \n     <p>6. Special exclusive\
  \ events at PaizoCon and Gen Con.</p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <h2>Local and Regional\
