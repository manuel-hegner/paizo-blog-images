  \        The Black Powder Cadre took a hit in this marathon, and lost one of its\
  \ founding members. Like we said in our last report, author Vanessa Hoskins will\
  \ surprise you. No finger-pointing amongst the team here—we got surprised—plain\
  \ and simple. Before we get to what happened, this daring all-gunslingers project\
  \ has lasted longer than many of us expected, so get caught up if you need to:</p>\n\

  \      <br>\n      <p>Summer marathons are usually grinders for us, and that’s exactly\
  \ what we did for this one. It was too hot for any post-session fire pit gatherings,\
  \ so we just kept playing until enough voices called it. The second day of this\
  \ marathon saw an eighteen-hour run, and came within sight of our record for the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhki?Giantslayer-Marathon-Part-3\"\
  >longest session</a> on the Paizo blog. We even had our friend Joe O’Brien—from\
  \ the <a href=\"https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/\">Glass Cannon Network</a>—\
  with us again, returning as Axayaca, the Beast Gunner from Arcadia. Joe wanted the\
  \ full Order of the Amber Die (OAD) experience this time, so on the day he was here\
  \ we decided to push until O’Brien threw in the towel. We’ll offer this to Glass\
  \ Cannon fans: Joe can grind!</p>\n      <p>If you’ve read our reports from years\
  \ past, you’ll know one of the main secrets to playing the longest sessions in the\
  \ industry is actually our GM. It’s Adam who will drag you long into the wee hours\
  \ of the morning, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1pc77MBdR_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\"\
  >jumping around</a> behind the screen at every natural 20 along the way. He’s just\
  \ been this way since ’87, and we keep making the mistake of thinking he’ll slow\
  \ down.</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Adventure</strong>: <em>Hands of the\
  \ Devil</em></li>\n       <li><strong>Marathon Length</strong>: 63 hours, 40 minutes</li>\n\
  \       <li><strong>Session Hours</strong>: 44 hours, 30 minutes</li>\n      </ul>\n\
  \      <p>It’s for extreme marathons like this one, that we keep a couple of critical\
  \ care nurses in the Order—you probably think we’re kidding. Now we can officially\
  \ welcome our newest member, who can roleplay all day, straight after a night shift:\
  \ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theamberdie/status/1678791647482478594\">Theodora\
  \ Marcantonis</a>! We’re always on the lookout for hardcore gamers, and while vetting\
  \ Theodora, we learned she possessed a platinum trophy in <em>God of War: Ragnarö\
  k</em>, and spent her precious time between shifts playing <em>Pathfinder:</em><em>Kingmaker</em>\
  \ and <em>Pathfinder:</em><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> on PlayStation. SOLD!\
  \ Everyone in OAD gets the team jersey of their choice, and we’re proud to have\
  \ pink as the newest color at our table. Tess Rajani, Way of the Drifter, has moved\
  \ from a cameo in our project to a full-time gunslinger in the Black Powder Cadre!</p>\n\
  \      <h3>Highlights from <em>Hands of the Devil</em>:</h3>\n      <p>□ We finished\
  \ out the last blog on level five, with the party having woken a massive amalgamation\
  \ of discarded flesh and bone. The behemoth surged to life, possessing unexpected\
  \ speed and maneuverability. We opened with a torrent of gunfire from the balcony,\
  \ but it responded with a salvo of its own: shards of bone that tore through the\
  \ Cadre, forcing us into a fighting retreat. We leapfrogged back through the level,\
  \ managing to hold the monstrosity’s advance at a couple of key locations where\
  \ it couldn’t afford to press into our firing line. When our options dwindled, we\
  \ made our final stand on the staircase up to level four. It closed with the party,\
  \ and Vlai plunged his scattergun into its gooey hide. Click – BOOM! The resulting\
  \ explosion caused the behemoth to decompose into a necrotic gas that curdled the\
  \ flesh of the closest gunslingers. You get one Hero Point for an entire day during\
  \ a marathon, and we burned them all here.</p>\n      <p>□ The Laboratories level\
  \ of this megadungeon means you’re really in it now, and level six did more than\
  \ any level so far to put the “Abomination” into Abomination Vaults. Disgusting\
  \ fleshwarps of varying sizes, seugathi researchers performing experiments best\
  \ left off this blog, and even scientific viewing galleries were intermixed within\
  \ the chambers we explored. We use our soundtrack to stay immersed, and there’s\
  \ good reason why we chose Chevelle’s <em>Peach</em> as the song for this level.</p>\n\
  \      <p>□ You know that rule about not stepping into a portal by yourself? Yeah,\
  \ well this is OAD and we’ve always said that there are few absolutes in Pathfinder.\
  \ Tess strode right into a teleporter that landed her in some kind of testing grounds,\
  \ complete with a seugathi taking notes on how quickly its destrachan subject would\
  \ annihilate her. She decided the best course of action was to run like hell and\
  \ lead the reptilian aberration toward our party; after all, we brought guns to\
  \ this megadungeon. As it turned out though, the destrachan brought artillery. It\
  \ let rip with 201 damage to the Cadre in a single area-of-effect blast from its\
  \ Destructive Harmonics, creating a new pedestal of statistics among our enemies\
  \ so far. For the record, you can go through a portal by yourself in this game and\
  \ survive.</p>\n      <p>□ In case you needed more from our “Vanessa will surprise\
  \ you” theme, here it is: there is a tavern in this megadungeon. Yup, full of morlocks\
  \ and such, ready to kill you or crack a beer—your choice. Stay long enough, and\
  \ you’ll end up in a battle of the bands versus Shadow Malice. Think of an all-star\
  \ lineup that only the Darklands can produce: duergar on drums, xulgath on guitar,\
  \ caligni on bass, and ratfolk on vocals. We survived the solo portion of the competition\
  \ due to the adept acrobatics of gunslingers, but the group section was a major\
  \ problem—made worse when Shadow Malice let it rip with “Shout at the Devil” at\
  \ full volume, even out-of-game. It was daunting to try and show them up with just\
  \ one roll and a +8 Performance modifier. That is, until Breen’s natural 20 made\
  \ us the hottest new band of the Abomination Vaults! When the crowd yelled for our\
  \ name, we looked to Zoric, the naming phenom who once accidentally coined us “\
  The Blue Coat Adventurers.” This time, he looked right back at the party and made\
  \ it clear: \"hey, don’t look at me.” The bartender screamed out Zoric’s response\
  \ in Undercommon. Then several other denizens screeched the name in unison: “DON’\
  T LOOK AT ME!” It was too late; Zoric had done it again.</p>\n      <p>□ While confronting\
  \ a seugathi and its latest fleshwarp creations known as dreshkhans, we once again\
  \ met our match in the ballistics department. Dreshkhans have an ability known as\
  \ Needle Spray, or “Death Blossom” as those of us who grew up watching <em>The Last\
  \ Starfighter</em> call it. If it wasn’t for our Player Captain making Risky Reload\
  \ a mandatory feat in this party, we might have needed more word count for the Character\
  \ Death section.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/860169d2-c6e5-46b3-bf8e-b78dd3fcbb02/OoTAD_Level6Angle.png\"\

  \   <h3>Character Deaths:</h3>\n      <p>If you give our GM an assassin with free\
  \ reign to target a single PC, murder will happen. Adam already <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lj63?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons\"\
  >proved it</a> when he was given a carte blanche assassin during Strange Aeons.\
  \ This time it was Maloika the Miserable, our ever-curious goblin, who squeezed\
  \ through an arrow slit into a series of long-unused guardrooms. Inside, lingered\
  \ Siora Fallowglade, the greater shadow and chief assassin of Belcorra herself—\
  determined to slay again after 500 years. Adam claims that, because he acted out\
  \ a kill emote from <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, that’s why he rolled a critical hit\
  \ to open combat against the goblin. At least it was quick.</p>\n      <br>\n  \
  \    <h3>The Arsenal:</h3>\n      <p>Maloika is gone, and it sits hard with us,\
  \ perhaps hardest with his Sniping Duo partner: Zoric. The goblin had grand plans\
  \ to hang up his guns, then use his relationship with the market owner to open his\
  \ own megadungeon collectibles store in Otari. We’re carrying on Maloika’s dream,\
  \ by continuing to take advantage of the organization rules in the <em>Pathfinder</em><em>Gamemastery\
  \ Guide</em>. Our newest followers and lieutenants have overseen construction, which\
  \ was built over the ruins of the Thirsty Alpaca. We’ve already named the store:\
  \ Ayla’s Oddities &amp; Collectibles<em>. </em>We even have plans to haul the giant\
  \ gong out from the arena level, the same one the goblin shot with his harmona gun\
  \ to wake the behemoth. We’ll make sure it rings every morning when the store opens—\
  in honor of Maloika.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Best Quote from Marathon 4:</h3>\n\
  \      <p>(after Vlai managed to hit three party members with one blast from the\
  \ scattergun)</p>\n      <p>Axayaca: “Why do you shoot your friends? Do you derive\
  \ some pleasure from it?”</p>\n      <p>Vlai: “It’s nothing personal.” (reloads)</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Current Situation:</h3>\n      <p>We blasted our way through\
  \ levels five and six, and just set foot on level seven. It smells like soot. The\
  \ temperature feels warmer here for some reason, and runes are carved on the walls.\
  \ Lock and load…</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e64cc7e3-72c9-47f0-8906-58c0c219beef/OoTAD_BehemothL.png\"\
