  date\">Tuesday, June 7, 2011</p> \n    <p>Even in the midst of PaizoCon preparation,\
  \ the design staff just loves those crazy little rules questions that pop up on\
  \ the messageboards, during actual play, or that just randomly stray into our heads\
  \ when we are designing an archetype or putting the finishing touches on a monster.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p>Since I just returned from Comicpalooza in Houston, I had\
  \ a number of those questions come up while conversing with players or that popped\
  \ up during play, and shared those experiences when I returned. Well, no good deed\
  \ goes unpunished. While in the middle of sharing my experiences, Jason quickly\
  \ pointed out that we needed a Design Tuesday blog. So let's look at some question\
  \ and answers involving everyone's favorite subjectâ€”combat maneuvers! Today I'll\
  \ go over a couple of pressing ones. We will get into more minutia next week.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n   </blockquote>\n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"\
  0\" align=\"right\">\n    <tbody>\n     <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9232-TripMonkey.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9232-TripMonkey_180.jpeg\"\

  \   <blockquote> \n    <blockquote>\n     <p><i><b>Question</b>: Standing up provokes\
  \ an attack of opportunity. I can attempt to trip a creature with an attack of opportunity.\
  \ Can I use the trip combat maneuver to keep my opponent down on the ground?</i></p>\n\
  \     <p></p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>In a word, no. By far this was the most\
  \ common combat maneuver question at the show that people asked me. I had folks\
  \ try to use it in the game, and I can understand why. As a tactic, it seems pretty\
  \ powerful. Too powerful, and that's why there are some subtle timing issues that\
  \ are going on when a creature attempts to stand up and provokes the attack of opportunity.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p>When the attack of opportunity is provoked for standing up,\
  \ the creature is still prone, since an attack of opportunity interrupts the action\
  \ that provoked it. Since that's the case, the creature is still prone when the\
  \ attack is provoked, and you cannot trip a prone creature, as it is already prone.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p>Okay, all you trip monkeys out there, don't fret overly much.\
  \ If you want an effect similar to the one you desire, you just have to pay a higher\
  \ action cost. Use the ready action. Just make sure your triggered action is \"\
  after the creature stands up from being prone\" or something similar. I know, it's\
  \ not nearly as sexy (or free) but I have faith you'll find a way to make it work\
  \ to the detriment of those wily monsters.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <blockquote>\n\
  \     <p><i><b>Question</b>: A creature grappling an opponent typically needs to\
  \ make two combat maneuver checks to pin someone (one to grapple, the next to pin).\
  \ If you're pinned, do you also need to succeed at two checks to escape, one for\
  \ the grab and the other for the pin?</i></p>\n     <p></p>\n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>The answer to this question is also no. When a creature is pinned, it gains\
  \ this more severe version of the grappled condition, and the two conditions do\
  \ not stack (as described in the pinned condition). While this means that you do\
  \ not take both the penalties for both the grapple and the pin, this also means\
  \ that pinned supersedes the grapple condition; it does not compound it. For this\
  \ reason you only need to succeed one combat maneuver or Escape Artist check to\
  \ escape either a grapple or a pin.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p style=\"clear:both;\"\
