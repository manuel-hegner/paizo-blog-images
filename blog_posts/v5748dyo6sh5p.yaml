  \ a million souls, Absalom—the City at the Center of the World—has a huge logistical\
  \ burden in feeding its populace. When Aroden, the Last Azlanti, raised the island\
  \ from the depths of the sea, he foresaw this need and blessed it with fecundity\
  \ through the aeon towers and their magical aeon orbs. Even after Aroden’s death,\
  \ these towers nurture what was once barren, submarine rock.</p> \n      <p>However,\
  \ as the influence of Aroden has waned in the century since his death, so too has\
  \ the power of the aeon orbs. What was once a near-perfect cornucopia of growing\
  \ lands for crops and timber—a region virtually untouched by climatic fluctuation\
  \ or soil exhaustion— has begun, in small increments, to creep back toward a more\
  \ mundane environment as the power of the aeon orbs slowly dwindles. The expected\
  \ multiple harvests per year have become unreliable, timber stands are sparse and\
  \ recover slowly from logging, and the soil in some fields has become exhausted,\
  \ forcing farmers to leave them fallow. Some people of the Swardlands— Swardfolk,\
  \ as they call themselves—are on the verge of panic, while others blithely ignore\
  \ the changes around them, insisting any change must be only temporary or imaginary.\
  \ Something has to change, and soon, or the Swardlands will fail. And if the Swardlands\
  \ fail, can Absalom be far behind?”</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>For more\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Unbury the dogma and mythos of the gluttonous demon lord\
  \ Zevgavizeb, god of subterranean horrors, cavern‐dwelling reptiles, and debased\
  \ xulgaths in <em>Zevgavizeb</em> by Amber Stewar</p> \n     <blockquote> \n   \
  \   <p>“Zevgavizeb—the Beast of Gluttondark, Lord of Reptiles, and Sun-Devourer—\
  is a ravenous and cruel demon lord whose followers commit heinous sacrifices and\
  \ engage in long, brutal wars in the name of their deity. Beyond his followers among\
  \ the xulgaths (also known as troglodytes) who form the majority of his congregation,\
  \ Zevgavizeb is little known among mortals, for his interests rarely extend beyond\
  \ his own Abyssal demesne and his insatiable hunger. Most scholarly works describe\
  \ him briefly, pointing to his origins as a qlippoth before his ascension to demonkind\
  \ as one possible explanation for his insatiable hunger and unquenchable bloodlust.\
  \ The Sun-Devourer alternates between periods of genocidal gluttony and torpid slumber,\
  \ with his followers reflecting this pattern of war and peace in their cycles of\
  \ catastrophic collapse and societal elevation.</p> \n      <p>Faithful xulgaths\
  \ believe that each period of Zevgavizeb’s infamous slumber allows the demon lord\
  \ to literally digest and incorporate some portion of the knowledge of those he\
  \ devours and those sacrificed in his name. In this state of torpor, there is little\
  \ to fear from the Lord of Reptiles, and his followers enjoy periods of peace and\
  \ prosperity. When the demon lord’s hunger riles him once more, though, the shock\
  \ waves of his cravings can be felt in the very bones of his devotees, who themselves\
  \ become driven to rage-fueled violence. These “ravenings,” as xulgaths refer to\
  \ the periods of war that coincide with Zevgavizeb’s hunger, have kept his cults\
  \ in eons-long conflicts and stunted the development of their societies for as long\
  \ as they have worshipped the dread demon. His adherents believe that each cycle\
  \ of sleep and rampage progresses the Beast of Gluttondark toward some unknown endgame.\
  \ While other civilizations disregard Zevgavizeb’s followers as brutish cannibals\
  \ and warmongers, they fail to see that the deity’s adherents remain in a state\
  \ of relative unenlightenment only due to the nightmarish culls that fuel their\
  \ ancestral deity’s continuing apotheosis.”</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>For\
  \ more information on Zevgavizeb’s personification, realm, dogma, worshippers, temples,\
  \ shrines, priests, holidays, aphorisms, holy text, relations with other religions,\
  \ and new rules—including a Zevgavizeb-themed background, feat, and spell—devour\

  \     </div> \n     <p>This volume presents a new ancestry, archetypes, monsters,\
  \ and much more in the <em>Adventure Toolbox</em> by Anthony Bono, Jacob W. Michaels,\
  \ Andrew Mullen, Patrick Renie, Alex Riggs, Timothy Snow, and Greg A. Vaughan. Yes,\
  \ there are three new magic items, ten new monsters, the golem grafter and lumberjack\
  \ archetypes, but this volume contains a surprise that I think will bring us all\
  \ delight for years to come — the shoony ancestry!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n  \
  \    <p>“Diminutive humanoids who resemble squat, bipedal dogs, shoonies are sometimes\
  \ mistaken for weak and insular pacifists. However, their sheer perseverance, incredible\
  \ work ethic, and resourceful use of diplomacy make shoonies far from helpless.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>According to shoonies, Aroden created their kind to provide him with\
  \ pleasant company soon after he created the Isle of Kortos. Shoony culture is rooted\
  \ in this myth and its implications, which help to explain the ancestry’s long reputation\
  \ for hospitality, good will, and pacifism. War is antithetical to the shoony way\
  \ of life; shoonies rely on cooperation and persistence to make their way through\
  \ a world that can seem at times hellbent on destroying them. Shoonies are unflappable\
  \ in their optimism and always see the best in others, even when faced with frequent\
  \ subjugation and exploitation that might create bitterness or xenophobia among\
  \ other societies. To shoonies, peace is a goal always worth striving for, and no\
  \ villain is beyond redemption, so they aim to resolve problems with peaceful solutions.”\
