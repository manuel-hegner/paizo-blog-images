  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">My <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43h04?Staff-Change-Update-from-Paizo-President-Jeff\"\
  >public statement</a> on Wednesday was a fundamental expression of Paizo’s commitment\
  \ to diversity and inclusion, values that I share both personally and professionally.\
  \ It was an opening statement—not the final word on the topic by any means.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Words are important. </p> \n     <p>But I also know that actions are\
  \ even more important. </p> \n     <p>As a result, I want to share with you a number\
  \ of actions that address some of the concerns that have been brought to our attention\
  \ over the last week. </p> \n     <p>The welfare and safety of our employees is\
  \ paramount. No employee will ever be fired for whistleblowing or advocating for\
  \ employee safety and wellbeing, and we have never fired an employee for doing so.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Following our return from Gen Con, the Executive Team will schedule\
  \ individual meetings with our managers to give them a chance to share concerns\
  \ directly. In the coming weeks, Paizo will issue an independently managed employee\
  \ engagement survey to provide all employees with an anonymous means to provide\
  \ candid feedback. The information provided through this process is aimed at addressing\
  \ employee concerns and driving change to create a more positive workplace.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We take all claims of harassment seriously. Our CEO Lisa Stevens released\
  \ a statement in 2019 that underscores Paizo’s stance on this matter, and it applies\
  \ today as well. You can read that here: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/guidelines\"\
  >https://paizo.com/community/guidelines</a>.</p> \n     <p>We held staff-wide in\
  \ person anti-harassment training in 2018 and initiated annual mandatory online\
  \ training earlier in 2021.</p> \n     <p>We are currently finalizing a job description\
  \ to fill a vacant full-time HR position. You’ll see this posted in the next few\
  \ business days, and we’ll be looking for a candidate with expertise in diversity,\
  \ equity, and inclusion. It is important to all of us that this professional can\
  \ help us to maintain Paizo’s shared commitment to our values in recruitment, hiring,\
  \ and daily operations.</p> \n     <p>In the meantime, we are encouraging our employees\
  \ to make use of the free independent human resources hotline Paizo initiated in\
  \ 2018, where they can report grievances of any kind in complete confidentiality.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Paizo makes decisions about employee convention attendance based on\
  \ the business and community needs of the show, irrespective of gender or gender\
  \ identity. However, it is time that Paizo evolves from the longtime practice of\
  \ employees sharing rooms during convention and business travel. As such, we have\
  \ enacted a one-employee-per-room policy that will be our standard moving forward.\
  \ Employees can request to share a room if they so choose. </p> \n     <p>We are\
  \ extending Paizo’s existing work-from-home timeline through at least the end of\
  \ the year. Employees that want to work from the office can continue to do so but\
  \ will need to abide by the company’s existing vaccination and mask policies. We\
  \ will continue to follow CDC guidelines and keep our employees as safe as possible\
  \ during the pandemic by offering work-from-home and a safe office space for those\
  \ who prefer that option.</p> \n     <p>Over the last several years, we have invested\
  \ heavily in Project Management to help the company get a better sense of workload\
  \ in the Creative Department, implementing company-wide project management software\
  \ and increasing the size of the project management team. This work has already\
  \ resulted in increased production schedule lead times, and Paizo will continue\
  \ to leverage this valuable resource to provide better work/life balances for our\
  \ employees.</p> \n     <p>In the same period, the creation of additional management\
  \ positions within the Creative Department has also helped give staff better access\
  \ to managers, and to empower those managers to better gauge deadlines and workloads.\
  \ As with our Project Management initiatives, this is an ongoing process, but it\
  \ is already bearing fruit and improving not just Paizo’s products, but the lives\
  \ of the brilliant creatives who make them possible.</p> \n     <p>To clear up some\
  \ confusion that has worked its way into the conversation, freelancer relations\
  \ remains the purview of the Creative Department. Paizo freelancers who appreciate\
  \ their strong relationship with our developers, editors, and art team can be assured\
  \ that we have made no changes on this front. </p> \n     <p>Finally, based on feedback\
  \ from the staff, we changed professional cleaning services in 2017, and the offices\
  \ have been cleaned and vacuumed on a regular basis since then.</p> \n     <p>These\
  \ aren’t the only things we are doing. We are building strategies to address the\
  \ challenges facing the company and will strive to be more transparent about our\
  \ plans as we build stronger lines of communication with everyone at Paizo. We are\
  \ committed to listening. We are committed to continuing to improve based on the\
  \ feedback of our teams. There will be more messages, and more concrete actions,\
  \ to come.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">--Jeff<br></p>\
