  \ Our Blessings: The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Blows Off Gen Con’s Doors</h1>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 27, 2013</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p>Full disclosure: I did not have three and a half hours in the pool.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">That's all it took for Paizo to sell out\
  \ all of its stock of our new Pathfinder Adventure Card Game's base set at the Gen\
  \ Con Game Fair. In fact, an hour before the hall opened to the public, hundreds\
  \ of \"Very Important Gamers\" had queued up to buy their copies. I tried to shake\
  \ all of their hands. Well, one hand per person. So half their hands.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>It often took an hour to get a <i>demo</i>. That is something I've never\
  \ experienced outside of a video game convention. The Pathfinder Society demoers,\
  \ plus my developers Chad, Paul, Gaby, and Tanis, ran tables all weekend, but there\
  \ just wasn't room for everyone. If you tried to get a peek, I hope you got in.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I had to tell most of my friends that no, they could not expect a copy\
  \ from me. I didn't have any copies under the table. Everything went to a fan. We\
  \ were in uncharted waters here.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-MikeDemosToDoubleclicks_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>Mike demos the game to Aubrey Webber of the nerd folk\
  \ duo The Doubleclicks. Photo by the other Doubleclick, Angela Webber.\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>The coolest thing is that we saw people playing the game all over the\
  \ con. They all seemed to be enjoying themselves. They also seemed to be trying\
  \ to grasp exactly what kind of game it was they were playing. The card gamers suddenly\
  \ felt like they were doing something more personal than just managing card combos.\
  \ The RPGers found themselves in an environment where the game was trying to kill\
  \ them, and nobody was there to save them. Eventually, they all seemed to get it.\
  \ This was something familiar, but also something very different.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ got asked a lot of questions. Did a lot of interviews. For example, there were\
  \ these Orrises.</p> \n    <center>\n     <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"\

  \    </center> \n    <p>We were asked over and over whether or not we would make\
  \ more Adventure Paths after Rise of the Runelords. This seemed a little premature\
  \ to me. Weren't you more interested in playing this one than thinking about the\
  \ next one, I asked. But it dawned on me why they were asking. They wanted to know\
  \ whether we were committed to following this out, to making the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game more than just a distraction, more of a lifestyle choice. They wanted\
  \ to know if we embraced it as much as they wanted us to.</p> \n    <p>I'm pretty\
  \ sure we'll keep doing this as long as folks want. I'm not sure what's next, but\
  \ it sure seems like something's next.</p> \n    <p>Meanwhile, let's get to playing.\
  \ A year into the development, I'm ready to open my box and take it for a spin.\
  \ If you're at PAX Prime, let me know if you're playing. I'll try to come by and\
  \ see.</p> \n    <p>And thanks again, Gen Con. It was a heck of a show.</p> \n \
