  \ of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ prepainted plastic miniatures is getting closer and closer! We've already showed\
  \ off 52 of the set's 55 figures, so this week we're going to finish off the set\
  \ with the final three reveals!</p></span> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Seltyiel_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Up first this week is our iconic magus, Seltiyel! This rakish\
  \ eldritch warrior with the open shirt, curved sword, and come hither look first\
  \ appeared representing a prestige class in the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\">Core\
  \ Rulebook</a>, but we liked him so much that we decided to bring him back when\
  \ we did a fighter/wizard base class for real in <a href=\"/products/btpy8k8r\"\
  >Ultimate Magic</a>. This version is from that later source, and honestly I think\
  \ he's one of the best iconic characters we've done yet in prepainted plastic. The\
  \ details on this figure are just amazing. You'll find something new on it every\
  \ time you look. And who doesn't need a cool long-haired dude like this in their\
  \ minis collection? Seltiyel is a rare figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ since I mentioned it months ago and images of it leaked online last week when\
  \ our partners at WizKids included the Hammerhead Shark in their awesome Pathfinder\
  \ Battles San Diego Comic Con display. I recently opened a case of <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> figures and ended up with three of this Large, uncommon\
  \ figure. With the three regular sharks that also came in the case, I have now pretty\
  \ much sealed up my lifetime need for prepainted sharks, and I couldn't be happier\
  \ with the figures. The normal guy is pretty great, but this larger shark is really\
  \ impressive on the game table, and I know you'll be thrilled to have him.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Wasp.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Wasp_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Our final <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</a> reveal is a figure almost no one guessed, the Giant Wasp! From the\
  \ cool clear wings to the shiny carapace, the Giant Wasp is a very impressive figure\
  \ that towers over player characters, threatening a sting you just know you want\
  \ to do whatever you can to avoid! At the uncommon rarity, you'll be able to amass\
  \ a whole nest of this Large figure (or at least a small handful). Just watch out\
  \ for that stinger!</p> \n     <p>That's it for this week's previews, and that's\
  \ it for the entire <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set!\
  \ As I mentioned above, I just cracked an entire case of this set, and was really\
  \ impressed with the production on the figures. I definitely felt like each brick,\
  \ and even each four-figure booster, was a good value for the money, and I'm really\
  \ happy to add the whole set to my personal collection. In just a few short weeks\
  \ you'll have the same experience opening your figures, and I'm more certain than\
  \ ever that you're going to be thrilled with the way WizKids keeps raising the bar\
  \ with each Pathfinder Battles release.</p> \n     <p>Next Friday we'll take a look\
  \ at the final painted version of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xrp\">Gargantuan\
  \ Skeletal Dragon</a> limited-edition case incentive figure, as well as a few group\
  \ shots and other thoughts about the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</a> set. </p> \n     <p>And then we're off to the NEXT set, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>, and we start the whole crazy preview\
  \ cycle all over again with a set that pushes the quality even further into the\
  \ stratosphere.</p> \n     <p>See you then!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
