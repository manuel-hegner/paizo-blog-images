  \ rules to simulate a fantasy setting, one thing that's always been in the background\
  \ in Pathfinder has been the idea that certain monsters, types of armor, and so\
  \ on are more common in some areas than in others. For instance, Pathfinder First\
  \ Edition's rules for the Knowledge skill rely on the fact that some monsters are\
  \ more commonly known, though it doesn't really define which are which. Meanwhile,\
  \ there are circumstances such as the spell <i>Echean's excellent enclosure </i>from\
  \ <i>Rival Guide </i>where knowledge of a spell is closely guarded by its creator\
  \ (in this case, an evil 20th-level wizard).</p> \n    <p>To make it easier for\
  \ players and GMs to engage in worldbuilding, whether playing in Golarion or your\
  \ own setting, we've created a formalized framework for the Pathfinder Playtest—\
  using the categories common, uncommon, rare, and unique—that you can use to help\
  \ determine the tone of a setting, region, or adventure. These are relative terms;\
  \ while we list suggested rarities for various rules elements, they naturally vary\
  \ from place to place even within the same campaign setting. For instance, in the\
  \ playtest, a longsword is listed as common, and a katana is listed as uncommon,\
  \ but in a game focused around Japanese fantasy (or, in Golarion, Minkai or Minkai-influenced\
  \ nations in Tian Xia), a katana would be common and a longsword might be uncommon.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Common</h2> \n    <p>Something is common if it's ubiquitous in its category,\
  \ like any of the core races and core classes, longswords, <i>fireball</i>, <i>bracers\
  \ of armor</i>, and the like. All characters can select common options without restriction.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Uncommon</h2> \n    <p>Something is uncommon if it's a little rarer,\
  \ but still possible to find or use if you are deeply interested in it. These options\
  \ are a bit weirder, more complicated, or known to fewer people, so they haven't\
  \ spread across the world as much. Many uncommon options explicitly become available\
  \ to a character as they proceed along a path that teaches them about that option.\
  \ For instance, all domain powers in the playtest are uncommon spells, but clerics\
  \ are granted access to domain powers through their deities. Characters from a given\
  \ region, ethnicity, religion, or other group in your world might gain access to\
  \ uncommon options associated with it. To go back to our previous example, even\
  \ in a game set in the Inner Sea region of Golarion, if your character hailed from\
  \ Minkai in her background, you and the GM might decide that you should gain access\
  \ to Eastern weapons instead of, or in addition to, Western ones.</p> \n    <p>Story\
  \ events in your game are another way a character could gain access to uncommon\
  \ options. For instance, Stephen previously mentioned in the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkq6?Secrets-of-Alchemy\"\
  >blog on alchemical items</a> that you would have to get the formula for drow sleep\
  \ poison from the drow; it's an uncommon option. But in your campaign, if your alchemist\
  \ was captured by the drow and forced to brew poisons for them, the GM might add\
  \ drow sleep poison and other uncommon options to the formulas available to your\
  \ alchemist! Uncommon options make amazing rewards to find in adventures, and they\
  \ can be found at a much higher rate than rare options, since they are more common\
  \ in the world.</p> \n    <h2>Rare</h2> \n    <p>Something is rare if it's extremely\
  \ difficult to obtain without doing something special in-world to find it. This\
  \ means that rare options involve interplay between the player and the GM, or are\
  \ granted by the GM directly. There's no way to get access to these through choices\
  \ in your character build alone. Rare options are spells known only to the ancient\
  \ runelords, techniques passed down by the grandmaster of an ancient monastery in\
  \ the Wall of Heaven mountains, golem-crafting secrets of the Jistka Imperium, and\
  \ the like.</p> \n    <h2>Unique</h2> \n    <p>Something is unique if there's only\
  \ one. Most artifacts are unique, as are certain monsters, like the Sandpoint Devil\
  \ or Grendel. No artifacts appear in the <i>Playtest Rulebook</i>, so in the playtest\
  \ only a few <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> monsters and hazards are unique.</p> \n    <h1>Uses\
  \ of Rarity</h1> \n    <p>So how is this system useful to you?</p> \n    <h2>Worldbuilding\
  \ and Emulating Genres</h2> \n    <p>First of all, your group can really alter the\
  \ flavor and feel of the game by changing around the commonness of certain elements,\
  \ allowing for a wide variety of genre play and settings through a relatively simple\
  \ system. This is a big tool in your toolkit for worldbuilding. What would a world\
  \ be like where the wizard was uncommon, or where all healing magic was rare? You\
  \ can create a new subgenre or setting simply by shifting around the assumptions\
  \ of what elements are common, uncommon, and rare. The rarities in the <em>Playtest\
  \ Rulebook</em> are meant to show a good baseline for a typical Pathfinder campaign\
  \ and make for a solid default if you're not straying to far from classic fantasy,\
  \ but I can't wait until people start posting their modified schemes for all sorts\
  \ of different concepts, from prehistoric to horror, and from low-magic (all magic\
  \ is uncommon or rare) to super high fantasy mash-up (everything is common!).</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Mechanical Diversity without Cognitive Overload</h2> \n    <p>While\
  \ some groups go for a kitchen sink approach to available options, many groups want\
  \ to allow options from other books but are tend to stick to the core content because\
  \ of the sheer mental load of learning, using, and preparing for all of those options,\
  \ especially on the GM. With rarity, you have a framework for adding more material\
  \ without just opening the fire hose: you start with common content (for a new group,\
  \ probably the things labeled as common in the book) and you expand into mastering\
  \ uncommon and rare content only as it appears in your game. If a particular rare\
  \ spell hasn't shown up in the game, you don't have to worry about how it might\
  \ interact with your character's build or your NPC's plot in the same way you might\
  \ otherwise. A player can bring some desired uncommon or rare options to the GM,\
  \ who can get a feel for the rules involved and decide when and how to introduce\
  \ those options to the campaign. If the PC is interested in spells and items from\
  \ ancient Osirion, perhaps the PCs find a new quest that takes them there, or is\
  \ contacted by an Osirionologist NPC who's willing to trade her Osirian secrets\
  \ for the PCs' help with a different adventure.</p> \n    <p>We love games with\
  \ plenty of options, but we also want to consider fans who've told us that though\
  \ they love new options, they started becoming overwhelmed by just how many options\
  \ there are in Pathfinder First Edition. With the rarity system, you can enjoy the\
  \ best of both worlds.</p> \n    <h2>Awesome Rewards</h2> \n    <p>One thing that\
  \ can be tough in Pathfinder First Edition is giving a reward to a PC whose player\
  \ has already looked up all the options and bought or crafted all the items they\
  \ really want, learned all the spells they really want, and so on, even if some\
  \ of those items and spells really seemed like they wouldn't be available on the\
  \ open market. Rarity allows a GM to give rewards that aren't easily available without\
  \ needing to homebrew a brand new item or ability every time, and allows players\
  \ who gain rarer options to feel special and important.</p> \n    <p>When you emerge\
  \ from a Thassilonian tomb with a rare spell few have seen in millennia, wizards'\
  \ guilds might start salivating over that knowledge. Will you keep it to yourself?\
  \ Will you sell it to select wizards for a pretty penny? Will you spread the knowledge\
  \ to all who desire it, possibly making the spell uncommon or even common in your\
  \ setting? Or will you keep it to yourself to show off for the spellcasters you\
  \ meet who have never heard of it? Only you can decide, giving you the power to\
  \ make a permanent mark on the setting.</p> \n    <p>So how are you most excited\
  \ to use the new rarity system?</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
