  artist: "far the most powerful of Darkmoon Vale's lumber barons has long ruled Falcon's\
    \ Hollow with a clenched fist, feeding on the misery of its common folk. When\
    \ some undetermined and insidious force menaces his interests in the vale and\
    \ leaves a camp of lumberjacks slaughtered in the night, Kreed requires a band\
    \ of brave fools to deal with the threat. Interested in the job? Have a little\
    \ chat with Thuldrin Kreed, Gavel of the Lumber Consortium: \"We all know I'm\
    \ a mean ol' bastard. I bleed these men and women for all they've got, but I pay\
    \ them square, and there ain't no chains on their wrists. You think I don't care\
    \ about these men? Then you're a fool. I need them. Sure I may grind these men\
    \ to paste with years of back-breaking toil, but whatever's out there now is killing\
    \ em. Nobody's puts a knife to my men but me. You go out there and get what did\
    \ this. I'll not have my men slaughtered like pigs. \"Boss Teedum's going with\
    \ you to make sure you succeed. I do not trust a task like this to outsiders alone.\
    \ Those men deserve justice that's for certain, but more importantly I'm not about\
    \ to let anything threaten my interests in the Vale. If you fail, get your bowels\
    \ opened on a blade, find yourself between a monster's jaws, or just plain loose\
    \ the steel in your spine, Pay Day's there to pick up what you drop and see it\
    \ through. I'm not laying down for monsters, stumpy dwarf ghosts or the prancing\
    \ fey. This Vale is mine, and I'll keep it. I'll burn the whole gods-be-damned\
    \ forest to ash before I let someone take it"
