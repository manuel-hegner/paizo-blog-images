  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Celita was busy, as usual, but her colleagues had requested—begged, more accurately—\
  that she attend their holiday gathering. She would never prioritize discussing trivial\
  \ subject matter while intaking excessive amounts of nutrients above completion\
  \ of her duties in the Cortex, but she knew it mattered to the others, so here she\
  \ was.</p> \n       <p>Now, she stood inside a cramped Downlow apartment watching\
  \ a crowd of her acquaintances squabble over plates of food and colorfully wrapped\
  \ gifts. Zigvigix—Ziggy, she reminded herself, feeling an odd flutter in her cardiovascular\
  \ system—had entrusted Celita with a solemn duty: record the gathering with their\
  \ datapad. She agreed that a chronicle of this event would make a perfect addition\
  \ to the Archives.</p> \n       <p>Truthfully, Celita had never attended a party\
  \ like this before. In Kuthonas past, most of the other Starfinders were either\
  \ out on maneuvers or bogged down with solitary tasks of their own. She had spent\
  \ last year in her pajamas, watching the Newspark parade accompanied by cold Castrovelian\
  \ takeout, and the Kuthona before that had been a marathon of endless data entry\
  \ and review. She panned the datapad around the room and zoomed in on Fitch, who\
  \ lifted a parcel wrapped in silver paper out of the reach of the ysoki children\
  \ swarming around her. They grabbed for the gift with insistent paws, their voices\
  \ rising into a barely intelligible din of “please” and “it’s mine!” and “you opened\
  \ the last one!” Celita sighed. Everyone else but her seemed to know exactly what\
  \ to do, and how to react to the surplus of food and gifts presented to them, but\
  \ she had no frame of reference for this situation. At least recording duty gave\
  \ her a convenient excuse to blend into the background. She moved the datapad’s\
  \ camera lens away from Fitch and toward her other colleagues who sat scrunched\
  \ together on a threadbare couch. Arvin and Ziggy chatted amiably, occasionally\
  \ offering each other morsels from their overloaded plates.</p> \n       <p>“Try\
  \ a cookie,” Arvin gestured to a platter full of colorful sugar cookies on a nearby\
  \ table, grinning proudly. “I made plenty.” Panic skittered over the lashunta’s\
  \ face as he scanned the food-laden tables for his contribution. “Wait a minute…\
  I baked two batches. Where did they all go?” He asked.</p> \n       <p>“Mmmph,”\
  \ a muffled voice spoke through a mouthful of cookies. “Sorry. Over here.” Naiaj\
  \ huddled on an armchair in the corner clutching the cookie tray. Celita refocused\
  \ to capture the gnome’s ridiculous outfit. Naiaj wore an oversized, hand-knitted\
  \ sweater of bright green wool decorated with a gaudy pattern of snowflakes and\
  \ red bows. She’d pinned a matching bow, probably from one of the wrapped gifts,\
  \ into her short white hair. She caught Celita’s eye across the room and blushed,\
  \ embarrassed at being caught with her hand in the cookie jar.</p> \n       <p>“\
  Point that thing somewhere else, would you?” Naiaj growled in her usual gruff voice.\
  \ Conversation died down as everyone enjoyed their food, and Celita quickly ran\
  \ out of interesting subjects to catalog. Her stomach twinged, and she realized\
  \ her blood sugar was low. Now that the group was settled, she could gather the\
  \ requisite calories for herself. Without warning, someone shoved a plate at her.\
  \ She fumbled with the datapad, dropping it in surprise, but a scaly hand appeared\
  \ to catch the device before it hit the floor. It was Radaszam, who had appeared\
  \ out of nowhere and now studied her through narrowed eyes. He crossed his arms\
  \ in disapproval.</p> \n       <p>“Eat,” he commanded, “or you will have no energy\
  \ for the games.” Celita recalled that holidays in the Veskarium often centered\
  \ around competitive games, and she paled at the thought of playing harcoló or hoverskate\
  \ racing on an empty stomach. “Exactly,” Radaszam said as if reading her mind. “\
  I’ll take over recording duties for now.”</p> \n       <p>Celita gripped the plate\
  \ in both hands and wandered toward the couch where her colleagues sat. No, not\
  \ only colleagues, she thought; they were also her friends. She cared about them,\
  \ and if they didn’t return those feelings of endearment, they would have never\
  \ included her in this gathering. Feeling a bit more relaxed, she perched on the\
  \ arm of the sofa next to Zigvigix. Their antennae twitched as they sensed her presence,\
  \ and she felt the warmth of their telepathic voice fill her mind.</p> \n      \
  \ <p><em>“Are you having fun, Celita?</em>” Ziggy asked.</p> \n       <p>“Yes, I\
  \ think I am.” She admitted. She took a bite of savory casserole. “Mmm, who made\
  \ this?” Naiaj raised a hand to claim responsibility for the dish. Next, she sampled\
  \ Arvin’s cookies, which were sweeter than she normally preferred but still delicious.\
  \ After she set her empty plate aside, she felt a wordless mental nudge from Ziggy.\
  \ They clutched a tiny box in their clawed hands and held it out to her.</p> \n\
  \       <p>“Is this for me?” Celita asked, feeling heat rise in her face. It was\
  \ uncomfortably warm in the tiny apartment with everyone crowded in here. Fitch’\
  s climate control system probably wasn’t built for this kind of load, she thought.</p>\
  \ \n       <p><em>\"This is my contribution for First Choices. Normally the gift\
  \ exchange is random but…well…I wanted you to have it.</em>” Ziggy gently deposited\
  \ the gift in her open palms. Celita marveled at the intricate wrapping of gold\
  \ foil paper and silver ribbons. She untied the bow gently, not wanting to destroy\
  \ Ziggy’s careful work. She removed the wrapping paper with careful fingers until\
  \ a plain box sat in her palm. “<em>There’s a flap you pull to open it,</em>” Ziggy\
  \ directed telepathically. Celita opened the box, revealing a sunburst-shaped pendant\
  \ strung with a delicate chain of braided silver.</p> \n       <p><em>“My project\
  \ this year was jewelry making,</em>” Ziggy explained in a rush, their words colliding\
  \ into each other and flooding her mind with jittery energy. “<em>One of the best\
  \ things I made was this necklace. Oh! I almost forgot. You can push the button\
  \ there and…</em>” Celita used a finger to apply pressure to a tiny mechanism on\
  \ the underside of the pendant. She gasped as a holo bloomed above it, displaying\
  \ an image of a shirren with their arm wrapped around an android’s shoulders. Both\
  \ faces lit up with smiles as they stood together, a perfect island in the frenzied\
  \ crowd that seethed all around them. She recognized the image instantly from her\
  \ trip with Ziggy to the Strawberry Machine Cake concert. Celita felt waves of emotion\
  \ crash over her, one after another in a merciless tide, and she staggered under\
  \ the weight of them. She was drowning. How could she respond to such a kind gesture?\
  \ What should she say? Her eyes darted around the room, taking in the sight of the\
  \ coworkers who had become her friends, and maybe even something approaching family,\
  \ all laughing and talking together. Others were exchanging gifts and embracing.\
  \ There was so much joy in the cramped apartment that she felt like she might explode.\
  \ It was overwhelming, but it wasn’t entirely a bad feeling. Celita took a deep\
  \ breath to collect her thoughts and exhaled, knowing what she had to do. She clasped\
  \ the necklace around her neck without deactivating the holo, so that the image\
  \ that encapsulated her relationship with Zigvigix broadcasted out into the world.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>“Thank you, Ziggy.” Celita beamed at the shirren and grasped their\
  \ claws with both hands. “This is the best gift anyone’s ever given me.”</p> \n\

  \ \n      <p>Wait, reader, you still have a present to unwrap! As a special gift\
  \ to you, the Starfinder Team would like to share these Pact Worlds holidays to\
  \ add a festive note to your campaigns.</p> \n      <p><b>Newspark</b>: Believed\
  \ to originate with the early abolitionist movement, today many androids throughout\
  \ the Pact Worlds celebrate Newspark. Traditionally, celebrants plan a parade incorporating\
  \ homemade floats, outrageous outfits, and loud music. The parade stops at various\
  \ homes and businesses along its route, receiving gifts of food, drink, or conversation\
  \ from the residents. Newspark is also a popular date for acquiring and showing\
  \ off new personal augmentations. Though the famed Absalom Station Newspark parade\
  \ begins at the end of Kuthona and lasts into Abadius, the celebration isn’t traditionally\
  \ tied to a date. Instead, androids plan Newspark gatherings to spark joy in difficult\
  \ times, and some of the greatest Newsparks in memory occurred during periods of\
  \ economic depression, war, or other strife.</p> \n      <p><b>First Choices</b>:\
  \ This shirren-innovated holiday centers around the exchange of gifts, specifically,\
  \ creations that epitomize your personal style, favorite hobby, or most recent experiment.\
  \ Groups of friends, and sometimes even strangers, gather for a show-and-tell of\
  \ these items. While reciprocal exchange isn’t unheard of, the most common format\
  \ involves a grand choice-buffet accompanied by games to decide who ends up with\
  \ which gifts.</p> \n      <p><b>Reunion</b>: An Akitonian holiday that developed\
  \ in the first century AG emphasizing generosity and kinship despite economic difficulties\
  \ and great distances, as a result of the thasteron bust and mass emigration to\
  \ find work elsewhere. Traditions include sending the gift of a message to distant\
  \ family and friends, then gathering to enjoy a meal with those in your immediate\
  \ circle. Traditionally, Reunion Day meals were prepared with cheap ingredients,\
  \ ingenuity, and lots of love—resulting in outrageous dishes that many Akitonians\
  \ choose to keep on the menu for ironic or nostalgic reasons. </p> \n      <div\

  \ Pelagatti</p>\n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <p>We’ve got two brand new scenarios\
  \ lined up for this month. First, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026df?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-313-Silence-at-Outpost-634\"\
  >SFS #3-13: Silence at Outpost 634</a> takes PCs to a remote outpost to relieve\
  \ a group of Starfinders on a long-term research mission. Unfortunately, there’\
  s no sign of the research team and our heroes must piece together what happened\
  \ to them before it’s too late. This adventure, designed for PCs of levels 1–4,\
  \ was written by Emily Parks.</p> \n      <p>Next, Guidance sends a group of experienced\
  \ Starfinders to retrieve a data fragment on Eox, causing conflict between the Society\
  \ and the sinister Corpse Fleet. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026dh?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-314-Fleeting-Truth-Hollow-Lies\"\
  >SFS #3-14: Fleeting Truth: Hollow Lies</a>, written by Jessica Catalan, is an adventure\
  \ for levels 9–12.</p> \n      <p>We hope you enjoy this month’s scenarios and holidays.\
  \ For those who plan to celebrate: have fun, be safe, and enjoy yourselves. Downtime\
  \ between missions is important!</p> \n      <p>Check back this afternoon for more\
  \ preview goodies, this time of the Pathfinder Society variety.</p> \n      <p>Happy\
  \ Holidays,</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Jenny\
