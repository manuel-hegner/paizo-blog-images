              <h1 itemprop="headline">Parade of Tributes: Wrath of the Righteous Characters</h1>
              <p class="date">Tuesday, March 24, 2015</p>
              <div itemprop="articleBody">
               <p itemprop="description">Today we're going to talk about the character line-up for the next <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game release, </a><a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>. As usual, each character in the set will have a premium character playmat created by our friends at Ultra•PRO. Mats will be available in two packs: one containing the 7 characters from the <a href="/products/btpy9a46"><em>Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</em></a>, and one containing the 4 characters from the <a href="/products/btpy9a47"><em>Character Add-On Deck</em></a>.</p>
               <p>Speaking of the Base Set, here's your first look at the finished box, which features an all-new cover painting by Wayne Reynolds.</p>

                <a href="/products/btpy9a46"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6020_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>We showed off this box for the first time at last week's GAMA trade show and received lots of raves!</em>
               </div>
               <p>On to the characters!</p>
               <h2>Base Set</h2>
               <p><b>Alain</b><br>
                 Alain the cavalier makes his ACG debut in this set, and he comes to the party with a shocking lack of tragedy in his backstory. Alain is an entitled scion of nobility who grew to manhood entirely convinced of his own competence in all things. As a brash young man, Alain gathered whatever funds and personal effects he could carry. He then declared himself a sellsword, setting off for the "crimson poetry of the fray." Today, whether leading soldiers in a suicidal charge or booting serving girls out of his bed in the morning, Alain cares little about the people around him. More than money, love, or lust, Alain cares about his reputation. With every encounter, he strives to increase his own legend, whether as a scoundrel or saint. Perhaps the only creature he truly values is his horse, Donahan. Exceedingly well trained, and having accompanied Alain for longer than any of his human compatriots, Donahan represents everything Alain looks for in a partner: absolute loyalty, absolute trust, and absolute obedience. Donahan is a new type of card called a cohort—we'll explain how those work in an upcoming blog.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Playmat-Alain.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Playmat-Alain_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p><b>Balazar</b><br>
                 Summoner Balazar and his eidolon Padrig make their debuts in Wrath of the Righteous. Balazar grew up in the magical academies of Quantium in Nex after that region's Arclords stole him from his family. More interested in pranks and anarchy than his studies, Balazar was inevitably expelled. He set off on the road to Ecanus, a city infamous for its twisted magical experiments. The masters of Ecanus sought one who could look into a rift known as the Void Chasm and maintain his sanity. As they forced the gnome to stare into the Void, he heard a voice. "I will help you," it said in reassuring tones. "Give me form and allow me to leave this prison, and you and I will become as one." Balazar imagined a huge snakelike creature with a beak, and Padrig took form. Now the gnome and his strange companion wander the world, having fun and causing trouble in equal measure. Like Alain's horse Donahan, Padrig is a cohort card.</p>

               </div>
               <p><b>Enora</b><br>
                 Enora the halfling arcanist makes her ACG debut in this set. She's motivated by a love of knowledge. Enora was a star student at the Occularium, a child of two professors at the august center of arcane learning. While performing field research in a half-flooded temple to Nethys, the god of magic, Enora uncovered a stone tablet that radiated a magical aura unlike anything she had ever encountered before. Touching her hand to the tablet flooded Enora's mind with magical revelations, knowledge beyond her wildest dreams, and a sense of a much vaster world of magical discovery than she had ever imagined. Today, Enora travels the Inner Sea searching for knowledge, be it secular or religious in nature.</p>
               <p><b>Harsk</b><br>
                 ACG fan-favorite Harsk returns for a third time! Few things made young Harsk happier than crouching in a tree stand in southeastern Varisia with his crossbow, listening to the wind through the forest leaves and waiting for deer or larger prey to wander by. After the brutal slaughter of his brother by giants, however, Harsk's view of his place in the world changed. Now the dwarven ranger seeks to forever be the voice of justice in wild places, preserving nature's balance and preventing the sacrifices of noble men like his brother.</p>
               <p><b>Imrijka</b><br>
                 Imrijka the inquisitor makes her Adventure Card Game debut in Wrath of the Righteous. Half-orc orphans aren't a common sight in the church of Pharasma, goddess of fate and death, but Imrijka isn't a common half-orc. She wears a mysterious disk that might hold the key to the truth of her parentage. Taken in by the church's high exorcist and trained as an inquisitor, Imrijka brings judgment to all who would violate the laws of life and death. Imrijka's seen it all, and she faces the future with courage and faith.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Playmat-Imrijka.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Playmat-Imrijka_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p><b>Kyra</b><br>
                 Kyra's third appearance in the Adventure Card Game pits her against demons and heretics, but facing off against long odds is nothing new to this cleric of Sarenrae. Kyra grew up in the shadow of one of the Dawnflower's shrines. When bandits attacked her small town, Kyra watched as the priestesses did their best to reason with them—and when that came to naught, she decided to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately, the bandits were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors. On the smoking ruins of the shrine, she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae. She pledged to protect those who could not protect themselves, vowing not to spare the blade when the time for redemption passes.</p>
               <p><b>Seelah</b><br>
                 Fans of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous">RPG version of the Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> will not be surprised to see our iconic paladin Seelah make her second appearance here. Seelah first encountered warriors in Iomedae's service in the town of Solku, where her family had fled after witnessing horrible atrocities in the land of Geb. When a group of Iomedae's knights arrived to defend Solku from marauding gnolls, Seelah was immediately taken with their beautiful, shining armor. Within an hour, she had stolen a particularly fine helm with a golden bird upon its brow. Days later, Seelah was wracked with guilt and horror as she saw the paladin whose helm she had stolen struck down by a blow to the head from a gnoll's flail. As penance, Seelah joined the knights of Iomedae, hoping to carry on the good work that the fallen paladin might have done. You'll note that one of Seelah's powers mentions the new Corrupted trait—we'll talk about that in an upcoming blog too!</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div>
               <h2>Character Add-On Deck</h2>
               <p><b>Adowyn</b><br>
                 Adowyn the hunter and her wolf Leryn make their first appearance in Wrath of the Righteous. As a girl, Adowyn accompanied her father into the perilous Fangwood on a trading expedition. One night a diseased bear charged into their camp, savaging Adowyn's father before she could even cry out. Using the bow her father had carved for her, she sank arrow after arrow into the beast, tears streaming down her cheeks. At last, the bear fell. The creature was dead—but so was her father. Adowyn spent months in the blighted forest alone, mourning her father and learning to survive by wit and arrow. During her isolation, she rescued a lean gray wolf and nursed it back to health, giving it her father's name as a last measure of grief and farewell. Now Adowyn and Leryn wander the Inner Sea region as bounty hunters, searching fruitlessly for the mother she left behind. Leryn is a cohort card in Wrath.</p>
               <p><b>Crowe</b><br>
                 The Shoanti bloodrager Crowe debuts in Wrath of the Righteous. Crowe was born under an auspicious sign during a thunderstorm that scoured the Storval Plateau one burning autumn evening. As a youth, Crowe often got into fights and then claimed he didn't remember how the scraps had started. He would feel his heart beating against his ribs. He would hear the blood thrumming in his ears, and that would be the last thing he recalled. After these amnesiac rages took the lives of a dozen horses and several of his tribe members one night, Crowe set out on his own with only his rage, his shame, and the power of the storm that coursed through his blood to help him make his way.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-Crowe.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-Crowe_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p><b>Seoni</b><br>
                 Back by popular demand, Seoni makes her third appearance in this set. The tattooed sorceress has long wandered the world, though her goals remain a mystery. Seoni's runic tattoos play an influential role in her personality. Coming from a culture where tattoo magic maintains a strong following, hers are simultaneously a manifestation of her power and a tool to aid in her castings. The sheer number adorning her skin, as well as the similar patterns woven into her clothes, are a mark of status among her tribe, although many of the so-called "civilized" residents of Varisia look upon such body modification with distaste.</p>
               <p><b>Shardra</b><br>
                 Dwarven shaman Shardra Geltl makes her Adventure Card Game debut here. As she grew into adolescence, Shardra discovered that objects could speak to her. The voices of stone and wood kept her company when her outward existence became fraught. They taught her much about the stories and histories of her people. A fall while out walking brought Shardra into an ancient cavern. Her journey into that holy place began her lifelong friendship with a spirit creature resembling a tuatara, whom she named Kolo. With Kolo the crag tuatara at her shoulder, Shardra now wanders the world, uncovering lost treasure and listening to the tales it has to tell. Kolo is a cohort card in Wrath.</p>
