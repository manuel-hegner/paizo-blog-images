  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to the Year of the\
  \ Crit! A lot is happening behind the scenes for all of your favorite Twitch shows\
  \ this January, and we couldn’t be more excited! This 2020 is going to be amazing\
  \ for up and coming live plays and content creators for tabletop rpgs. And we here\
  \ at Paizo are excited to aid those interested in pushing these platforms forward.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>One note to our fans of Oblivion Oath and those who use the point currency\
  \ system in our Twitch chat. We will be converting to the channel points system\
  \ sometime around mid february. So for those who have granted our players hero points,\
  \ boons, and villain points for the GM. Be aware that you will still have the option\
  \ to do so, but with a more integrated system. Along with a lot more options to\
  \ interact with us live!</p> \n     <p>Here is what’s happening this week at <a\

  \ in the shifting political landscape of Taldor. A nobleman, a veteran, a bounty\
  \ hunter, a trained spy, and an old wizard. They joined for an evening’s “work”\
  \ at an elegant gala, and now fight for the future of their nation and their very\
  \ lives. The question every week is simple: Can these five overcome their own differences\
  \ long enough to succeed in this War for the Crown?”</i>\n      <br>-Squiddish\n\
