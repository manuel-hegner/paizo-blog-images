  \ Three</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, June 5, 2009</p> \n   <p><i>3. Do you\
  \ encourage your players to create well-thought-out backgrounds complete with hooks\
  \ that you can insert into your campaign?</i></p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>Lisa Stevens</b>:\
  \ I do, but don't reward. I basically tell my players that if they come up with\
  \ interesting backgrounds, then they'll get more out of my campaign; it will be\
  \ more personal for them, as I'll take their hooks and use them in the plot. If\
  \ you don't create a background, then you'll still have fun, but maybe the story\
  \ won't be as personal for you. Either is fine; I let the players decide what they\
  \ want out of the campaign.</p> \n   <p><b>F. Wesley Schneider</b>: Yes. They don't\
  \ have to write up elaborate histories, but I usually ask them to at least provide\
  \ me with their characters' shticks.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>James Jacobs</b>: Yes,\
  \ absolutely. Absolutely.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>Erik Mona</b>: Doesn't matter. If\
  \ a player is really into that, then I'll take the hooks and weave them back into\
  \ the campaign, but if a player doesn't care then neither do I.</p> \n   <p><b>Jason\
  \ Bulmahn</b>: I'll ask but won't mandate it. I leave it to player discretion. I'll\
  \ definitely reward the effort, in that the story will be tied to their history\
  \ and generally benefit them in some way and be more personal.</p> \n   <p><b>Sean\
  \ K Reynolds</b>: Encourage.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>Joshua J. Frost</b>: Yes, I encourage.</p>\
  \ <b></b>\n   <p><b>James Sutter</b>: Once their concepts are made I like to work\
  \ with them to get them all together, but there are some players who just like to\
  \ show up and go, and that's fine. I think well thought out is more fun, but of\
  \ course sometimes my problem is that I'll create a really long and detailed history\
  \ and then die after one session. (laughs)</p> \n   <p><b>Chris Self</b>: Absolutely.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><i>I've always thought this was one of the best parts of running a campaign!</i></p>\
