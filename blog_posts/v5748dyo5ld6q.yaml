  \ \n   <h2>Chapter One: Honest Travelers</h2> \n   <p>It was a good plan, cunningly\
  \ simple. It just didn't go the way the planner had meant it to.</p> \n   <p>A caravan\
  \ from Egorian arrived in the late afternoon at the heavily fortified caravanserai\
  \ just outside the walls of Elidir. The merchants who had pooled their resources—\
  and defenses—into the cavalcade of fifty mule-drawn wagons and forty pack animals\
  \ intended to remain at the way station until the following midday so that they\
  \ could pick over the best offerings of Elidir's purveyors of precious goods. Those\
  \ exquisitries would be added to the caravan's panniers and coffers that already\
  \ bulged with fine wares from half a dozen lands around the Inner Sea. Then at noon\
  \ the next day, the caravan would move on, bound for the luxury markets of Kerse\
  \ in Druma.</p> \n   <p>While the hauling and carrying beasts rested and the traders\
  \ chaffered, safe within the caravanserai's crenellated walls, half of the sixteen-strong\
  \ complement of horse-archers were granted leave to visit the city's taverns and\
  \ brothels, while the half who had lost the coin toss stayed behind and remained\
  \ vigilant.</p> \n   <p>Three of the liberty contingent went no farther than a raucous\
  \ and crowded establishment just inside the city gates, where they called for a\
  \ keg of strong ale. While they were waiting for the drink to be fetched, they bellied\
  \ up to the board stretched along one wall and filled wooden plates with bread and\
  \ meats spiced with the fiery local sauces. They looked around for seats and saw\
  \ no empty tables, only one long trestle that had half its bench-seats unfilled.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>A trio of travelers were already seated at the table, by their style\
  \ of dress identifiable as a small-scale merchant and his assistants. The former\
  \ good-naturedly waved the guards to take the empty places. A lean, saturnine figure\
  \ seated at the head of the table, wearing a robe marked with obscure symbols, gave\
  \ no indication that he was aware of any of them. His blade-like nose was buried\
  \ in an antique libram bound in red leather and marked with strange devices, and\
  \ he sipped something green from a tall, slim glass without removing his hooded\
  \ eyes from the page.</p> \n   <p>The guards accepted the travelers' invitation.\
  \ They sat, and names and origins were politely exchanged, then the ale arrived\
  \ and some time was spent washing away the throat-dust accumulated between Egorian\
  \ and Elidir. The merchant then leaned forward and raised a finger as if to begin\
  \ a conversation, but was forestalled by the man in wizard's garb, who put down\
  \ his book and directed a question to the guards.</p> \n   <p>\"Your caravan leaves\
  \ when?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Midday tomorrow,\" the senior of the archers answered.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Will it take on passengers?\"</p> \n   <p>\"We usually do. You'll have\
  \ to ask the head men at the caravanserai in the morning.\"</p> \n   <p>The spellslinger\
  \ nodded and, without thanking the guard, returned to his reading. A moment later,\
  \ the first course of his meal was brought by the serving girl, and he addressed\
  \ himself to the food without removing his gaze from the book.</p> \n   <p>Meanwhile,\
  \ the leader of the trio of merchants, who said he was a pearlmonger from Merab\
  \ across the Inner Sea, and now bound for Kerse, asked about road conditions ahead.\
  \ Because the guards had accompanied similar caravans along this route, they were\
  \ able to offer expert advice.</p> \n   <p>The self-described pearl merchant, a\
  \ small and wiry fellow with a narrow brow and eyes that seldom settled in one position,\
  \ said, \"It is good that honest travelers share their intelligence. The roads are\
  \ full of highwaymen and ditch-haunters, desperadoes all of them, who will slit\
  \ a throat for a half-polished button.\"</p> \n   <p>The senior man of the archers\
  \ agreed that it was a sad world, yet not altogether so. \"Were it not for bandits\
  \ and brigands, I would still be pushing a plow and swallowing horse farts in the\
  \ hill country below the Menadors, instead of seeing other lands and drinking good\
  \ ale in amiable company.\"</p> \n   <p>Hearing such an ably argued view, the pearlmonger\
  \ declared himself forced to agree. He proposed a toast, and when the guards hoisted\
  \ their wooden mugs, he insisted that they let him top up their ale with good arrack\
  \ from the big black bottle he had been sharing with his assistants.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ caravan guards gladly accepted, and offered a toast of their own. It was soon\
  \ decided that more of the strong-flavored arrack was needed, and the narrow-browed\
  \ fellow raised an imperious finger to summon the serving maid. Events then settled\
  \ into a repetitive pattern: more healths were drunk, songs were sung, anecdotes\
  \ and spicy stories told, and lasting friendships boozily sworn. Somewhere early\
  \ on in this process, the reader irritably snapped his book shut and left the tavern.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>He also left, barely touched, a spiced apple dipped in plum sauce.\
  \ The alleged pearlmonger scooped the desert toward him and devoured it with two\
  \ quick bites. Soon after, he and his companions declared themselves spent. They\
  \ retired to their rooms, while the archers continued to fill and empty their cups\
  \ from the bottles of arrack the Merabite had kindly left behind. </p> \n   <p>As\
  \ the first gray light of day glimmered over the mountains that separated Isger\
  \ from Druma, the three guards rose, albeit unsteadily, to return to the caravanserai.\
  \ They knew themselves to be well under the spell of strong drink, but that was\
  \ nothing new. They could spend the morning sleeping off the effects of the carousal,\
  \ while their employers chaffered with the merchants of Elidir. By the time the\
  \ caravan set off again, the archers would be able to sit a saddle. And their ability\
  \ to put a gray-fletched arrow into a hand-sized target at a hundred paces would\
  \ be unimpaired.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KrunzleDisguise.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n    <br> \"Never trust a knifeman.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>Halfway between\
  \ the gate and the caravanserai, the first of the guards experienced a sudden shifting\
  \ of his innards, as if a large and liquid weight had decided to fling itself from\
  \ one side of him to the other. He stopped abruptly, and his face assumed an unusual\
  \ aspect that paradoxically combined deep uncertainty with a dread conviction. He\
  \ then walked with a rapid, spraddle-legged gait to a stand of low bushes beside\
  \ the road, his fingers fumbling at the ties and points of his breeches. </p> \n\
  \   <p>The other two archers stopped to make rude noises and offer tactless comments\
  \ at their companion's expense. But after a moment, their smiles collapsed as their\
  \ own faces assumed the same haunted expression they had been mocking. Now each\
  \ of them hurried to find his own bush.</p> \n   <p>Some time later, three pale\
  \ and groaning figures presented themselves at the caravanserai's gates. Idrix,\
  \ the captain of the archers, was called. He examined the men and declared them\
  \ unfit for service. </p> \n   <p>\"A belly flux,\" he said, and ordered them to\
  \ report to the caravanserai's hospice, to be collected when the caravan returned\
  \ on its way out of Druma. Their pay would be docked.</p> \n   <p>\"I will go into\
  \ the city,\" he told his second in command, \"and see what I can find in the way\
  \ of replacements. I don’t want to go up into the mountains under strength.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He was not happy about having to choose from what Elidir had to offer.\
  \ It was common knowledge among fighting men of many nations that the Goblinblood\
  \ Wars had robbed Isger of every warrior who knew which end of a sword to hold,\
  \ and those who were left were either untested youths or haunted-eyed old veterans\
  \ long since lost to drink. As he rode toward the city gate, the captain was thinking\
  \ that he might be best advised to visit the slave market and see if there were\
  \ any well set-up foreigners with military experience for sale.</p> \n   <p>Just\
  \ outside the gate, he reined in as three men in leather and buckram came out. They\
  \ paused to adjust their packs and touch the tips of their staffs together, as travelers\
  \ often did for luck at the beginning of a journey. They were none of them large,\
  \ but each had a hard and wiry look to him, and Idrix could see, even at a casual\
  \ glance, at least eight daggers and throwing knives distributed about their persons.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"would you be Druma-bound, by any chance?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The apparent leader of the trio, a low-browed fellow with restless eyes,\
  \ looked up at him with suspicion. \"What business is that of yours?\" he said.\
  \ \"If you're thinking we three are easy meat for a highwayman on a tall horse,\
  \ here's an opportunity to change your opinion.\"</p> \n   <p>There was a vertical\
  \ post set in the ground near the road outside the gate. Hedvend VI's judges sometimes\
  \ sentenced certain classes of malefactors to be bound there, exposed to the caprices\
  \ of passersby until they thoroughly repented of their offenses or expired—whichever\
  \ came first. The post was untenanted this morning, but within moments of the wiry\
  \ man's words, and after a brief flurry of motions, the wood was suddenly pierced\
  \ by a half-dozen blades, their hilts aquiver from the impacts.</p> \n   <p>\"Impressive,\"\
  \ said the guard captain.</p> \n   <p>The three travelers were already working their\
  \ weapons free of the wood and returning them to scabbards and sheaths. \"It means\
  \ so much to us to have won your high regard,\" said the low-browed one. He tucked\
  \ away a short but wide-bladed throwing knife and turned to face the high country\
  \ to the east.</p> \n   <p>\"Wait,\" said Idrix.</p> \n   <p>The other man turned\
  \ an irritated gaze his way. \"We have a long, uphill walk ahead of us and the sun\
  \ is already above those peaks.\"</p> \n   <p>\"How would you to like to ride instead\
  \ of walk?\"</p> \n   <p>The knife-thrower's look of suspicion only deepened. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"And be paid for it,\" the captain added.</p> \n   <p>\"We are busy men.\
  \ If you have something to say, stop poncing about and say it.\"</p> \n   <p>Idrix\
  \ was not used to being talked to in such a manner, but he swallowed his irritation\
  \ and told them he was three guards short of a full complement and wished to offer\
  \ them employment.</p> \n   <p>The three looked at him with suspicion, then gave\
  \ each other questioning glances. A brief negotiation followed, during which Idrix\
  \ was driven far off from his offering price. Detailed terms of service were also\
  \ haggled over, the leader of the three initially expressing horror at the thought\
  \ that when the caravan laagered for the night, they would have to stand watch on\
  \ the perimeter.</p> \n   <p>\"Well,\" said Idrix, pushing back his helmet and scratching\
  \ his head, \"where would you spend your nights when you're on the road alone?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"We make a fire,\" said the smaller man, \"then move out into the\
  \ darkness and dig shallow trenches, where we lie under a layer of bushes and bracken.\
  \ We watch in turns, and should any night-lurker creeps up to the fire, we silently\
  \ leap up, our finely balanced knives in hand, and\"—he made a whispery sound: whit,\
  \ whit, whit—\"soon he has gained a new and unsought knowledge of life's capacity\
  \ to play cruel tricks.\"</p> \n   <p>Idrix contemplated making a comment, then\
  \ decided not to. Instead he said, \"Night sentry duty is a necessary part of your\
  \ duties.\"</p> \n   <p>The three regarded him without enthusiasm. Then the leader\
  \ said, \"Can we at least stand watch together? We are used to supporting each other.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>The guard captain found that a reasonable condition, and after a few\
  \ more details were worked out, an agreement was struck and he led them back to\
  \ the caravanserai to sign them onto the rolls. Within the fortified compound, the\
  \ traders and their drivers were efficiently repacking wagons and saddlebags, preparing\
  \ to set off at noon. Idrix and his three reluctant recruits wove their way through\
  \ an organized chaos of stamping hooves, swearing men, tangles of harness, and side-stepping\
  \ beasts to the spot where the merchants who had commissioned the whole enterprise\
  \ stood in conversation with some persons from Elidir.</p> \n   <p>A half-dozen\
  \ individuals were gathered around the caravan's owners, seeking to purchase the\
  \ right to join the cavalcade, it being the safest means of crossing the wild lands\
  \ between Isger and Druma, where goblinoids of various sorts still occasionally\
  \ ambushed travelers. As the archer captain and the three new guards came up, one\
  \ of the passage-seekers, a sinewy, grim-featured specimen in an ankle-length robe\
  \ marked with strange runes, turned his head and noticed the trio.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  You!\" he said. \"Do you know you spoiled my dinner and gave me indigestion that\
  \ kept me up half the night? You and those damned archers!\"</p> \n   <p>The low-browed\
  \ one looked anywhere but at the wizard, saying, \"You mistake me, sir, for another...\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"No, I don't —\" began the accuser, but then he broke off and his\
  \ hooded gaze went from the three newcomers to the guard captain, whose brows were\
  \ now knitting up a skein of suspicion. </p> \n   <p>\"Aha!\" the gaunt man said,\
  \ \"I've smoked it! You nobbled the guards so you could take their—\"</p> \n   <p>As\
  \ he'd been speaking, the pearlmonger's face had been showing growing alarm, and\
  \ his hand had been moving smoothly and slowly toward the haft of one of the knives\
  \ strapped to his chest. The man in the figured robe saw the way things were going\
  \ and moved his own hand in a particular motion that ended with the fingers configured\
  \ in precise arrangements. He spoke two syllables. </p> \n   <p>The accused man's\
  \ hand now attained its goal, but when he sought to draw the throwing knife—and\
  \ as his companions made similar attempts—they all found that the blades were fixed\
  \ permanently in their scabbards.</p> \n   <p>A moment of silence and suspension\
  \ occurred. Then the low-browed man said, in a whisper all could hear, \"Run!\"\
