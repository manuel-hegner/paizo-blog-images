  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">A while back, our friends at Stranger\
  \ Comics, creators of the Niobe comic, launched a Kickstarter that had a reward\
  \ level that included a limited-edition Pathfinder book that brought the world of\
  \ Niobe into the Pathfinder rules, allowing fans of the comic and character to play\
  \ within the fantasy world of Asunda. They recently launched a second Kickstarter,\
  \ with the finished Pathfinder book including exclusive new art. I sat down with\
  \ Sebastian A. Jones, Niobe's creator, and talked about roleplaying games and their\
  \ inspiration on the world of Asunda.</p> \n    <p>Here's what Sebastian had to\
  \ say:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2><i>What are your previous roleplaying game\
  \ experiences that were an inspiration for Niobe?</i></h2> \n     <p>Dare I show\
  \ you my LARP outfits over the years?</p> \n     <p>Honestly, I found Niobe, or\
  \ perhaps she found me, some thirty years ago amidst my adolescent fears hidden\
  \ under the invisibility cloak of being too cool for school. People tend to see\
  \ through that crap - she did.</p> \n     <p>Niobe would soon reflect my own ambitions,\
  \ rage, and whatever raw emotions I was feeling. As I grew, she grew with me, a\
  \ mirror of my own design and desire. A being of darkness and light, she would make\
  \ the fantasy world of Asunda I was creating a better place, no matter the cost.\
  \ As an outlet for Niobe and her world I created Stranger Comics, where I could\
  \ tell her stories as well as other tales of conflicted characters. She was first\
  \ introduced in <i>The Untamed</i> painted by Peter Bergting (<i>Lord of the Rings</i>),\
  \ dubbed a \"Frazetta Western,\" and then <i>Niobe: She is Life</i> coauthored by\
  \ Amandla Stenberg (<i>Hunger Games</i>) and now... she is about to be deified in\
  \ Pathfinder! (All of which are available <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1182319554/niobe-returns-in-erathune-she-is-death-and-essessa?ref=user_menu\"\
  >on our current kickstarter</a>, titled <i>Niobe Returns</i>).</p> \n     <p>I mostly\
  \ GM'd, so sculpting Asunda was a constant. MERP and Rolemaster, First and Second\
  \ Edition D&amp;D, and a healthy dose of wielding foam swords kitted out in my Mum's\
  \ bathrobe. (I did eventually level up to thrift store attire).</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ stories (campaigns) I wanted to tell always had grand world changing underlying\
  \ plots, but the seasonal arcs reflected what we would go through—the pain and beauty\
  \ of coming of age, revenge vs. redemption, love vs. lust, and so on. I was usually\
  \ inspired by my personal life and creators across all genres ranging from Kurosawa\
  \ to Kirby, John Lennon to John Coltrane. How could we translate an emotional connection\
  \ to gaming was important, so being in character was second nature, but I don't\
  \ want to sound all melodramatic - we had a boat load of fun!</p> \n     <p>It also\
  \ was apparent as a young mixed kid, that there were little to zero characters that\
  \ reflected folks of color in these worlds I played in, unless they were a fetish\
  \ sidekick, an obligatory dark elf, or the easily seduced Umbar in Middle Earth.\
  \ And the stories told, as amazing as they were, well, I wanted them to reflect\
  \ not only a global audience, but the duality of sinner and saint within us all.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That is who Niobe is, half angel, half demon. The chosen one. And anyone\
  \ can be her, all they have to do is pick up the sword.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \     </div> \n     <h2><i>What are you most excited to see translated into Pathfinder?</i></h2>\
  \ \n     <p>All of it! I think the new races and feats that have been with me, Darrell,\
  \ Josh, and the rest of the Asunda crew—to be able to experience them in an official\
  \ Pathfinder game setting (<i>no house rules lol!</i>) is such a dream. Paizo are\
  \ kicking ass with their designs on everything, I can't wait for folks to also share\
  \ their own experiences in the same world, it has me geeked out. To everyone reading\
  \ this, please check out the Esufey race… our elemental first born fairies, and\
  \ of course Niobe's own paladinic type class, the paragon. Yeah, goosebumps.</p>\

  \     </div> \n     <h2><i>Why did you choose Pathfinder for this project?</i></h2>\
  \ \n     <p>From a mechanic perspective I have played a lot of systems, and Pathfinder\
  \ seems to have nailed down the perfect harmony of simple to complex. You can mold\
  \ the character you want to play, in any way shape and form, while maintaining originality\
  \ in a well-balanced gaming world. I love it! From a social standpoint, I love how\
  \ the team at Paizo clearly believes that representation matters in a most authentic\
  \ way. So, Niobe's world of Asunda fits in perfectly.</p> \n     <h2><i>What are\
  \ you most excited about seeing in the World of Niobe book?</i></h2> \n     <p>Niobe\
  \ herself—and all of the people that can now be her. That is just badass.</p> \n\
  \     <h2><i>What from Erathune do you think would best fit in a roleplaying game?</i></h2>\
  \ \n     <p>MOOOOOOOOOG!!! Moog Thrak Gorbak, our resident Ogre Queen, ain't pretty\
  \ but she will jack you up if you tell her otherwise. She killed enough of us when\
  \ we were gaming. My co-creator Darrell May is responsible for this tons-of-fun\
  \ menacing masterpiece.</p> \n     <p>Erathune, which is also available now in oversized\
  \ deluxe hardcover on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1182319554/niobe-returns-in-erathune-she-is-death-and-essessa?ref=user_menu\"\
  >our Kickstarter</a>, is probably the most gamerish and RPGesque of all our Asunda\
  \ titles (plus it has Niobe in it). Four issues of full-scale war bedlam between\
  \ Macgrom (dwarves) and Grachukk (great orcs) should rattle any roleplayer's senses,\
  \ plus it ties in all of our other titles—and all of this is set in the icy mountains\
  \ of Herfang with art by Hyoung (<i>The Last of Us</i>) and Sheldon Mitchell (<i>Cable</i>,\
  \ <i>Vampire Hunter D</i>).</p> \n     <p>Regarding the question, I think what Darrell\
  \ has created as far as a full town setting above ground as well as below, with\
  \ trade routes, surrounding Isinniel (elven) and Urzoth (barbarian) clans easily\
  \ lends itself to any campaign. Plus, I am excited to finally show off Soul Sunder,\
  \ King Buxton Stonebeard's legendary cursed axe of Madraq (<i>The Goddess of Death</i>).</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Every item across our various books will have runes on them, it is up\
  \ to you to translate. Every race has a story to tell, every town has a past, it\
  \ is up to you to dive in and explore. So click the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1182319554/niobe-returns-in-erathune-she-is-death-and-essessa?ref=user_menu\"\

  \ we're finishing up development of the <i>World of Niobe</i> Pathfinder book and\
  \ hope to have it in backers' hands very soon. I hope you all have enjoyed this\
  \ glimpse into another world.</p> \n    <p>Adam Daigle<br> <i>Managing Developer</i></p>\
