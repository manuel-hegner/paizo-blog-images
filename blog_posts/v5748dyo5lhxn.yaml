  \ of the \"In Hell's Bright Shadow\" SoundPack</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday,\
  \ September 2, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"\

  >Hell's Rebels Adventure Path</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9g0q\">\"In Hell's Bright\
  \ Shadow\"</a>, is a fantastic adventure needing equally fantastic sounds. But where\
  \ exactly does one record a skeleton battle in progress, or an exploding fairy?\
  \ Follow along in the attached video for just a few of the creative ways Team Syrinscape\
  \ brought \"In Hell's Bright Shadow\" to life.</p> <iframe style=\"width: 560px;\

  \ frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n     <h2>Skeleton Battle—<em>Redact\
  \ &amp; Revenge SoundSet</em></h2> \n     <p>\"In Hell's Bright Shadow\" calls for\
  \ a Skeleton Battle. We had drums and a disturbing undead mumbling all sorted, but\
  \ how to do the clinking of rib bones? We can't have skeletons without that sound!\
  \ The secret to making the sound of lots of little bones clinking together is...\
  \ Lego! Yep, with a handful of pink Lego pieces, and a bit of audio processing,\
  \ the result is a sound that's not only peculiar, but creates a sense that something\
  \ not held together in quite the normal way is trying to stab you.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150902-Lego.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150902-Lego_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <h2>Giant Rat Battle—<em>Fair Fortune Livery SoundSet</em></h2>\
  \ \n     <p>This one should've been simple enough to create. Just find some Rodents\
  \ of Unusual Size and record them, right? I tried that—they ate my microphone! And\
  \ sound samples from real-world rats weren't nearly monstrous enough for what awaits\
  \ players in this encounter. The solution here was Australia's Tasmanian Devil,\
  \ whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3RjAh8PRTQ\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >maniacal scream is part of how the animal got its name</a>. Thanks Australia!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Bloodthirsty Rioters—<em>Aria Park Protest SoundSet</em></h2> \n  \
  \   <p>Next, the protest and riot scene challenged us to come up with the sound\
  \ of a lawless rabble. What sort of people sound riotous, disrespectful of order,\
  \ and generally dangerous? Of course, politicians! That's right—these samples came\
  \ from open-source recordings of the English Houses of Parliament. That's what I\
  \ call leadership!</p> \n     <h2>Fan-Sourced Voice Actors</h2> \n     <p>While\
  \ many of Syrinscape's beastly sounds and unique voices come from our own voice\
  \ boxes combined with a lot of fancy audio processing, maintaining variety in the\
  \ audio content is one of our biggest challenges. This year at PaizoCon and again\
  \ at Gen Con, we thought we'd try having gamers contribute their own madness to\
  \ our library of source sounds, and wow, did you deliver! Some of my favorites:</p>\
  \ \n     <ul>\n      <li>The Grimple Cackles in the <em>Fair Fortune Livery SoundSet</em>\
  \ —supplied by Jason Bainter and Nathaniel Bassett at Gen Con. Wow!</li> \n    \
  \  <li>The lemures in the same SoundSet.</li> \n      <li>The chough in the <em>Waspnest</em>.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>And the thugs in the <em>Aria Park Protest</em>.</li>\n     </ul>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150902-Scream1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20150902-Scream1_180.jpeg\"></a> <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150902-Scream2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150902-Scream2_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>THANK YOU, and keep the sounds coming! In fact we are more\
  \ than happy to continue to accept sounds, just email them to <a href=\"mailto:benjamin@syrinscape.com?Subject=Sound%20Submission\"\
  >benjamin@syrinscape.com</a>.</p> \n     <h2>Exploding Fairy—<em>Rebuild the Ravens\
  \ SoundSet</em></h2> \n     <p>Last but not least came the age-old question, \"\
  What exactly does it sound like when a fairy explodes?\" This was indeed the conundrum\
  \ with which I was faced. In the end I settled on a slowed down balloon pop, combined\
  \ with a light sprinkling of sped-up fairy dust wind chimes. If we ever get the\
  \ chance to witness the real thing, I'll make sure I pull out my recorder quick-smart.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I hope you've enjoyed my musings on sound creation, and I hope you enjoy\
  \ our work on this amazing <a href=\"/products/btpy9gcy\"><em>In Hell's Bright Shadow\
  \ SoundPack</em></a>. In particular it's been fantastic to work with the two composers,\
  \ Kyle Johnson and Michael Gordon Shapiro, who have breathed a great breath of fresh\
  \ air into the music available in Syrinscape.</p> \n     <p>For the first time Syrinscape\
  \ is releasing a new SoundPack simultaneously with Paizo's latest Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path. GMs and players who now have access to the latest volume, <a href=\"/products/btpy9g0q\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #97: In Hell's Bright Shadow</em></a>, also have\
  \ the opportunity to experience this latest AP with sound from the get-go with the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9gcy\"><em>In Hell's Bright Shadow SoundPack</em></a>.\
  \ Give it a try with a <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/subscriptions/trial-adventure-path/?paizo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">free 30-day trial subscription</a>, but be warned—after a session\
  \ playing this excellent adventure enhanced with fully immersive sound, your players\
  \ will never want to play without Syrinscape again!</p> \n     <p>Benjamin Loomes<br>\
