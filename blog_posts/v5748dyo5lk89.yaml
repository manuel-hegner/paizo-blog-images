  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">By now, many of you\
  \ have seen the myriad of interesting and incredible creatures found within <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"><em>Starfinder Alien\
  \ Archive</em></a> (and if not, what are you waiting for?), but you might be wondering\
  \ how we went population this book. After all, the galaxy is a very big place, full\
  \ of all manner of beingsâ€”and that doesn't even begin to cover the infinite planes\
  \ of existence.</p> \n    <p>Luckily, we had a few places where we could start.\
  \ When we started thinking about <em>Alien Archive</em>, the Pathfinder RPG had\
  \ already printed five Bestiary volumes (<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9r1y?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 6</em></a> was at the printer at the time) that we\
  \ could mine for ideas. In addition, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8qib?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Worlds\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Worlds</em></a> established a number of\
  \ tentpoles regarding the Starfinder setting, albeit in the distant past. Conceivably\
  \ though, some of the monsters and cultures name-dropped in that volume would still\
  \ be around!</p> \n    <p>However, to truly capture the feel of a weird, science-fantasy\
  \ universe, we also needed brand-new creatures. To that end, several of us here\
  \ at Paizo absconded to a conference room and began filling up a whiteboard with\
  \ ideas: general concepts (space mermaid), cool-sounding names (assembly ooze),\
  \ and specific alien features (ability to break into constituent pieces). The fruits\
  \ of our labor can be seen below.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MountainEel.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MountainEel_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>After all that, we needed to make some hard cuts. We\
  \ knew dragons should be in the book, but we couldn't give them the space that <em>Bestiary</em>\
  \ volumes give them, so we stuck with the evil chromatic dragons. We thought angels\
  \ and devils should be represented, but we could only have one of each. We wanted\
  \ to make sure that each creature type would be represented, and And, of course,\
  \ each of us had our own ideas for the book.</p> \n    <p>I argued that we needed\
  \ at least one starship-sized creature. Rob McCreary noted the Azlanti Star Empire\
  \ with their Aeon Guard was one of the setting's core threats and should be in the\
  \ book. Owen K.C. Stephens persistently urged for the inclusion of the nuar, a nod\
  \ to one of the first things he ever wrote for the world of Golarion. Amanda Hamon\
  \ Kunz wanted to design a creature for the kaiju-infested planet she wrote for the\
  \ core rulebook. Similarly, James Sutter was interested in fleshing out some of\
  \ the races he originally wrote about in <em>Distant Worlds</em>. Some of our other\
  \ coworkers who took freelance assignments for the book (Crystal Frasier and John\
  \ Compton) voiced their own opinions on what it would be fun to write.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>All this information went into several spreadsheets and we organized and re-organized\
  \ it until we hit on a final list, which was sent out to writers, who returned with\
  \ some terrific takes on what were sometimes very odd requests. In the end, I think\
  \ we curated a fine collection of creatures that flesh out the world of Starfinder,\
  \ as well as provide GMs with a wide array of foes for their players and players\
  \ with some exciting new choices for races they can play!</p> \n    <p>Jason Keeley<br>\
