  \ \n      <p>In the square of a chilly town, a girl stares at a board so covered\
  \ in pamphlets and cutouts that she can scarcely see the wood underneath. “Protect\
  \ a caravan from troll attacks, slay a dragon, guard the baron’s son from assassins\
  \ at the summer ball… I don’t think I’m up for any of these.” In her pocket, a painted\
  \ metal egg flaps filigree wings, flitting to the bounty board and knocking gently\
  \ at a worn paper barely visible under an advertisement for a wandering circus.\
  \ “Retrieve a missing necklace, last seen in the town sewers…” the girl reads with\
  \ a note of confidence, “I think I could manage this!”</p> \n      <p>“If you’re\
  \ going into the sewers, be sure to watch out for otyughs. Nasty fever,” a strange\
  \ voice echoes from the girl’s ankles. When the girl sees its source—a small humanoid\
  \ plant that appears to bleed red sap from a dozen cracks on its uncanny wooden\
  \ body—she spins around in fright, sending a pulse of frosty magic into a nearby\
  \ abandoned barrel. The discarded object rushes to life, scrambling on newly grown\
  \ fowl’s legs to put itself between the girl and the plant.</p> \n      <p>“No need\
  \ for that,” the leshy says, “Name’s Hau. Doctor of Pharmacology.” He opens the\
  \ gourd that serves as his head and retrieves a certification and several vials.\
  \ “In any event, I was looking at that job too, and thinking I could use a partner.\
  \ Care to join? I can inoculate us against the otyughs ahead of time.” He squeezes\
  \ an extract into one of the vials with a fizz. </p> \n      <p>The girl looks at\
  \ the array of tools and substances that the small doctor measures before her with\
  \ wonder, “Where did you learn such advanced techniques?”</p> \n      <p>“Oh, you\
  \ know,” Hau says, “I studied for a time in Rahadoum, under a brilliant scientist.”\
  \ He eyes the objects still dancing strangely around the girl. “And where, pray\
  \ tell, did you pick up such unconventional magic?”</p> \n      <p>“Oh, you know,”\
  \ Ivy says, letting the flying egg land in her palm, “from my grandmother.”</p>\n\

  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">We were happy to release the sanctioning for the <em>Advanced\
  \ Player’s Guide</em> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shay?New-Character-Options-for-Pathfinder-and\"\
  >a few weeks ago</a>, but we have another Gen Con release to sanction for you all\
  \ today, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>! Please see the updates to our ongoing <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3j?Pathfinder-Society-Character-Options\"\
  >Character Options blog</a> for these newest additions.</p> \n     <p>While many\
  \ of these options are uncommon or rarer, as they represent the signature teachings,\
  \ items, and ability of legendary figures, we wanted to release the sanctioning\
  \ now to give everyone a chance to see what new options might inspire their characters.\
  \ In the future, be sure to keep an eye out for Pathfinder Society adventures that\
  \ feature these legends and their legacies for further chances to gain access to\
  \ these options</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <h3>Guide Updates</h3> \n \
  \    <p>Today marks the first day of Gen Con Online, which means the launch of <a\
  \ href=\"http://www.paizo.com/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Year 2: Year\
  \ of Corruption’s Reach</a>. A new program year means a new guide. This year, instead\
  \ of dropping the guide the first day of Gen Con and hoping people can access and\
  \ incorporate the information into their characters, we are going to release the\
  \ guide updates next week. There are no major changes to the program, just some\
  \ streamlining of processes and adding clarifying language around sections that\
  \ seemed to cause some confusion for our players. </p> \n     <p>The same holds\
  \ true for the Starfinder Society guide. Unfortunately we weren’t able to issue\
  \ this one when the Year launched in June. It’s ready now and will be available\
  \ for download next week. The new version incorporates new Faction goals and an\
  \ updated Story So Far. The big program change in <a href=\"http://www.paizo.com/starfindersociety\"\
  >Year 3: Year of Exploration’s Edge</a> is the phasing out of boons on chronicles.\
  \ We are using this year to prepare for the launch of Achievement Points in Year\
  \ 4.</p> \n     <p>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society guide changes involve adding\
  \ adventurer’s decks to the guide. Other than that, the program is continuing the\
  \ same as we start <a href=\"http://www.paizo.com/pacs\">Year 7: Year of Reborn\
  \ Strife</a>.</p> \n     <p>The biggest change is a revamp to how we are titling\
  \ the guides. To avoid confusion with the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0233q?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide</em></a> (releasing in October) and to\
  \ add cohesion to the Paizo Organized Play program as a whole, the guides will now\
  \ be <em>Guide to Organized Play</em>. We are also dropping Roleplaying Guild from\
  \ the names of the Pathfinder Society and the Starfinder Society. These are small\
  \ naming convention changes that bring cohesion to the idea of Paizo Organized Play\
  \ and society play as a whole! We’ve included links to each of the guides below\
  \ and plan to have them updated by next Thursday’s blog.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"\
