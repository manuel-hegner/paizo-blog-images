  \ subscribers already have <a href=\"/products/btpy9tok?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Book of the Damned</em></a> in their hands, but I'm not going\
  \ to let them have all the fun talking about what's in this book. Last week I talked\
  \ a bit about some of the rules in <em>Book of the Damned</em>, and today I'm here\
  \ to talk about some of the lore and flavor.</p> \n    <p>While there is some information\
  \ about your rank and file fiends, including handy tables for each type that lists\
  \ the fiends by challenge rating and includes their role, what they like for offerings,\
  \ and what book they can be found in, a big part of this book talks about the movers\
  \ and shakers among the ranks of fiends.</p> \n    <p>Each of the fiendish demigods\
  \ of the demons, devils, and daemons (demon lords, archdevils, Queens of Night,\
  \ Horsemen, and even Ahriman, the Lord of All Divs) gets a spread to themselves,\
  \ complete with full Fiendish Obedience boon information. These despicable beings\
  \ all have an illustration too. Some illustrations are brand new, others already\
  \ existed, but they're all wicked.</p> \n    <p>While the majority of the book deals\
  \ with the \"big three\" families of fiends—daemons, demons, and devils—the remainder\
  \ sheds some light on the lesser known fiends and their small realms scattered throughout\
  \ the Outer Planes.</p> \n    <p>This includes the demigods of other fiends (asura\
  \ ranas, kyton demagogues, oni daimo, qlippoth lords, rakshasa immortals, and sahkil\
  \ tormentors), who all get some more description and flavor, along with the daemon\
  \ harbingers, infernal dukes, malebranche, and nascent demon lords. Each of these\
  \ gets information about their areas of concern, domains, subdomains, and favored\
  \ weapon. With that you can build out enemy cultists and priests, or if you're playing\
  \ in an evil campaign clerics and warpriests for player characters.</p> \n    <p>However,\
  \ as is always the case, it leaves you wanting more. Sadly, not all of these fiendish\
  \ demigods get the full Fiendish Obedience boons treatment, but they do get the\
  \ basics. There is information about the obedience that a worshiper must complete\
  \ each day and the spell-like abilities granted at different levels.</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ addition to all the relevant information important to worshipers of these fiendish\
  \ demigods, Book of the Damned also gives readers an entire chapter of information\
  \ about the fiendish realms over which these fiends rule. In addition to information\
  \ on Abaddon, the Abyss, Hell, and the River Styx that runs through them all, you\
  \ get a look at places like kyton sanctuaries on the Plane of Shadow, rakshasa holdings\
  \ and oni strongholds on the Material Plane, and desolate Xibalba, home of the sahkils,\
  \ on the Ethereal Plane.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ style=\"width: 250px; height: 253px;\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Xibalba, the\
  \ Land of Dread, is formed from the focused fears of billions of mortals, and is\
  \ like a solid island in the hazy and indistinct Ethereal Plane. Different types\
  \ of terrain radiate out from a seemingly abandoned city atop a high hill, all of\
  \ which are studies in fright and terror. At the center of this desolate city is\
  \ a massive black stepped pyramid, home to many of the sahkil tormentors.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Speaking of the bosses of my little fear babies, here's a look at the table\
  \ of sahkil tormentors found in Book of the Damned. (Surprise! They all have the\
  \ Fear subdomain, which is also found in this book.)</p> \n    <blockquote> \n \
