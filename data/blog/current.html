                   <p><em>Pathfinder Quest is a cooperative adventure board game for 1–4 players. Build your character(s) from the ground up by choosing their ancestry, class, and ability cards—or dive right in and play a prebuilt iconic hero! From character creation to combat challenges and exploration, each player’s actions matter, with choices that ripple throughout the entire multisession campaign.</em></p>
                   <p>Pathfinder Quest is available in Standard Edition with pawns for all creatures and characters, and Deluxe Edition with plastic miniatures of the iconic heroes and select monsters. Pathfinder Quest Deluxe Edition is only available via this crowdfunding campaign, so if you’re a mini painter, <strong>don’t miss your chance for these exclusive figures</strong>!</p>

                   <p>Our <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/retail">Retail Incentive Program</a> is intended to benefit those game stores and other venues that host Organized Play games by incentivizing players to make purchases of food and gaming products while playing Pathfinder and Starfinder Society. While Starfinder Society (second edition) launched without support for this program, it is now included!</p>
                   <p>We have grouped Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society (second edition) into one program, as the systems are similar enough to make the benefits work for both games. No changes were made to the Pathfinder Society rewards, we have simply made the language more universal. The RIP programs for Pathfinder Society (first edition), Starfinder Society (first edition) and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society remain unchanged.</p>
                   <p>You can view and download the rewards at the link above or <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Files/Retail+Incentive+Program+v2025.pdf">at this printable PDF</a>. We encourage all organizers to incorporate the program into their regular events and conventions!</p>

                   <h1>Sanctioning Updates</h1>
                   <p>Last week, the first Starfinder (second edition) Adventure Path, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0crq9"><em>Guilt of the Grave World</em></a>, was released! Starfinder Society players may use the character options within, including the elebrian ancestry and corpsefolk versatile heritage, in Starfinder Society play. Please see the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Starfinder Society Character Options page</a> for any restrictions or clarifications.</p>
                   <p>Next month will see a real monster mash incoming with the release of <em>Monster Core 2</em> and <em>Lost Omens: Draconic Codex</em>for Pathfinder, as well as <em>Starfinder Alien Core</em>. Sanctioning for all of those books will be posted on the street date, so look forward to those!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1>GM Recognition</h1>
                   <h2>Campaign Service Coins</h2>
                   <p>Over the past month, several new Campaign Coins have been awarded! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their name and reasons.</p>
                   <p>Congratulations to:</p>
                   <p><strong>Adam Loutzenhiser</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #886</p>
                   <p>and <strong>John Brinkman</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #885</p>
                   <h2>GM Ranks</h2>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as having ran between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had two GMs reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Greg Garcia, Robert Odell</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>

                   <p>A Starfinder Society Scenario designed for 1st- through 2nd-level characters, playable in 2-3 hours.</p>
                   <p>Under the leadership of First Seeker Sarmak, the Starfinder Society has established a fledgling lodge in Akiton’s Sloughscar Hills to study a massive, crashed starship known as the Wreck of the Returned. The Starfinder Society isn’t the only group interested in the Wreck. In addition to countless freelancers and independent salvagers, three prominent factions have arisen and are clashing at every turn: the Aspis Consortium, a coalition of local Akitonian salvagers, and a government sanctioned delegation from the planet Aballon. With an eye to improving relations, Sarmak has invited representatives from each of these factions to meet on neutral ground to come to terms.</p>
                   <p>When danger threatens to disrupt the Sloughscar Summit, it’s up to the Starfinder Society to keep the peace.</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 5th- through 8th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>While the city-states of Iblydos have a long, storied history, the Pathfinder Society has little connection and fewer resources in that part of Golarion. Thus, when Venture-Captain Calisro Bennary has the opportunity to get a lodge set up in Hoimpeia, one of the chief port cities, she races back to Absalom to collect veteran agents for the task. Her contact isn't giving connections and a site for a lodge away for free. Something has been harassing shipping, and while the authorities are happy to let merchants take a longer route, the change has cost a particular merchant dearly. If the Pathfinders can clear up the shipping lanes, the merchant will move heaven and earth to get them a foothold in Iblydos.</p>

However, between devilish plots on one side and eager saboteurs on the other, the Pathfinders will need to keep their heads cool and pay close attention to keep the Tevineg family safe!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hail, Pathfinders!<br>
                     Today we’re catching up with our friends at BKOM Studios while they develop a Hack and Slash adaptation of <em>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults</em>. Talking to their Creative Director Wyatt and Art Director Jonathan, we learned more about what it takes to translate a game from tabletop to video game. And in this case, it was all through the lens of strange and mysterious inhabitants of the Darklands: caligni.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Immersion and Understanding&nbsp;</h3>
                   <p>To bring caligni over to their game, BKOM started with a clear understanding of their identity. Where better to start than the caligni’s tragic history?</p>
                   <p>Once people of the mighty Azlanti empire who reigned over Golarion, they fled underground millennia ago to survive the cataclysmic Earthfall.</p>
                   <p>In desperation, they made a pact with malevolent demigods known as the Forsaken, who transformed them into resilient and merciless subterranean dwellers capable of surviving the Darklands.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>As part of the deal, when a caligni dies, they combust in a burst of light and flame, with their soul energy feeding the Forsaken… a cruel irony, as the Forsaken vanished long ago and no longer watch over them, meaning their souls feed no one!&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>Caligni combatants are split into distinct societal and battlefield roles, such as stalkers, callers, and vanguards, and many other roles.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>The last piece of the caligni puzzle is the owbs, strange ancient beings from the Netherworld who caligni have come to worship and obey. These powerful creatures guide and manipulate caligni to do their bidding. Whether the owbs are manifestations of the ancient Forsaken, or simply imposters, is shrouded in mystery.</p>
                   <br>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1cd34ec6-e172-43de-a63b-9196650f5b84/CaligniSkulker_Watermarked_2000.jpg"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1cd34ec6-e172-43de-a63b-9196650f5b84/CaligniSkulker_Watermarked_2000.jpg" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="An artistic render of a Caligni Skulker, a pale skinned humanoid dressed in a tattered dark clothes, with leather accessories, wielding a large dagger."></a>

                   <br>
                   <h3>Building out Battlefield Roles&nbsp;</h3>
                   <p>With a clear definition of who caligni are, BKOM could start designing their game mechanics. Rather than being regular combatants, they wanted each caligni unit to be cohesive but unusual, challenging players in new ways:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Skulkers:</strong>&nbsp;The prototypical members of caligni forces. They fight like rogues, zip in and out of combat, and whittle away at the heroes. Players will need agility, precision, and teamwork to corner the skulkers and take them out efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vanguard:</strong> These are designed to be slow, powerful juggernauts who shake the battlefield with their heavy greatsword strikes. Their presence forces heroes to maneuver around the battlefield to avoid devastating blows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Callers:</strong>&nbsp;The “support types” of the caligni forces: deadly glass-cannon priests who cripple the heroes with dark magics borrowed from their owb masters, while empowering their caligni allies to greater heights of ferocity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Owbs:</strong>&nbsp;Powerful elite ranged enemies who use their shadowy “Curse of Darkness” to obliterate heroes from afar. Owbs will reposition when approached, hiding behind caligni servants. When an owb is on the battlefield, the heroes must pay attention to its attacks or be wiped out by its shadow magic instantly.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>BKOM noted that these designs will evolve throughout implementation and testing, so we look forward seeing the final versions on the battlefield!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>An Explosive Finale&nbsp;</h3>
                   <p>One of the most defining aspects of caligni is how they die. Thanks to a nasty pact made ages ago, when a caligni falls, they explode in a burst of flame and light.</p>
                   <p>This aspect was key for translating over into the gameplay. When a caligni is defeated, a small AoE preview is displayed that heroes must escape (usually with a dodge) to avoid suffering a burst of damage and crowd control.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>But after playtesting, BKOM quickly saw how easy it is to go overboard with the death blasts! They were constantly stunning, killing, de-buffing, and displacing the heroes. This is especially a problem when swarmed by caligni in the cramped corridors of the Darklands.</p>

                   <p>However, this element was too central to their identity to simply abandon. Instead, the designers carefully dialed down the severity of the death blasts until they provided the right balance of punishment and player agency. Now, taking out a caligni still means being ready to roll out, but won’t lead to being pinballed around into five different explosions while your HP bar empties out.</p>
                   <p>Ultimately, the “combined arms” dynamic and unusual mechanics of caligni are intended to force a new and unique challenge for heroes arriving in the Darklands. Their unusual fighting style should push Pathfinders to try new strategies and master calignis’ strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Art Vision and Pipeline&nbsp;</h3>
                   <p>Switching to the visual representation, Art Director Jonathan Dufresne described the process of bringing caligni to life.</p>
                   <p>Getting the visual design right always starts by looking at the source material. References and inspiration come directly from the books and other Paizo artwork.</p>
                   <p>At the current stage of production, BKOM’s art pipeline is well defined. It starts with reference gathering, then moves to a front-and-back-view sketch. A balance is struck between retaining key elements of the original design while adapting them to the game’s vision.</p>
                   <br>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                   <br>
                   <p>During review, proportions are checked, making sure they’re exaggerated enough to read well from a top-down perspective. Each enemy and character must feel unique in their silhouette for quick recognition by the player. Small details are also minimized to keep the visuals easy to read. Throughout the process, the Art team consults Game Design to ensure the enemy visually matches in-game behavior.</p>
                   <p>The next stage is 3D blocking. The goal here is to validate proportions directly in-game with proper camera angles. As always, reading well in the context of the game is a priority before moving to polish. Animation can also get started using the 3D blocking, before we even get the final models.</p>
                   <p>The last step is the detailed, textured enemy to bring everything together. While there’s room for feedback and minor changes, most of it has already been approved and implemented in previous steps.</p>

                   <h3>Caligni Skulker Design</h3>
                   <p>Applying this process to an example like the caligni skulker shows the method in practice. Taking the original references to inform the concept art, the team matches the original intent closely. Changes mostly take the form of adjustments to the proportions to suit the game’s other enemies and overall art direction.</p>
                   <br>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>Weapons are often deliberately oversized. Even though the original design has a dagger, BKOM’s 3D model is larger to make it easier to see during gameplay.</p>
                   <p>Animation and VFX focused on making the skulker feel nimble and evasive, using effects like the smoke grenade. By this stage, all the pieces come together and bring the character to life.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p id="entry1"><b>1</b><br>
                    Pathfinder is known for its rich world, full of storytelling potential, deep and meaningful character building, and a tactical play experience, and with <em>Quest</em>, we can bring all of that to a wider board game audience. So, while the game will feel immediately familiar to fans of the RPG, we worked hard to ensure that the story and overall mechanics of this game were approachable and easy to learn for new players as well.</p>
                   <p id="entry2"><b>2</b><br>
                    One unexpectedly intricate challenge was designing our set of 17 modular, double-sided map tiles so that they are interesting, reusable in unique ways, line up nicely, and don’t take up too much table space. And there was much triple- and quadruple-checking to make sure no single encounter required you to use both sides of the same tile!</p>
                   <p id="entry3"><b>3</b><br>
                    I can’t wait to hear stories from players about how their character builds, along with the items they’ve found, challenges they’ve attempted, and tactics they’ve used, have combined in truly unique ways to make for awesome gameplay moments. Even when playtesting the same encounters over and over, we never saw things play out the same way, and my favorite thing is watching players find clever and unexpected synergies that emerge from a series of relatively simple choices.</p>
                   <p id="entry4"><b>4</b><br>
                    Our primary goal while making <em>Quest</em> was to shoot for as approachable an adventure board game as possible while giving players the right amount of interesting decisions—not too few as to feel repetitive, but not so many as to overwhelm—and also to make choices matter! You’ll find that as you play out each encounter, each adventure, and indeed throughout the narrative of the entire campaign, your group’s particular makeup and choices through the story leads to their own unique tale.</p>
                   <p id="entry5"><b>5</b><br><em>Pathfinder Quest</em> is a cooperative fantasy adventure board game for 1 to 4 players. In <em>Quest</em>, you will play through a series of adventures, each one consisting of several encounters presented to you in the Adventure Book. Each encounter tells you what challenges you might face, both while exploring the world and while in combat. Challenges often require dice rolls to complete and depending on your result, you will get sent to the Challenge Book to learn your fate!</p>
                   <p>Throughout each adventure, you will be asked to make important choices that shape the overall outcome of the story. At the end of each adventure, you will level up and get ready to take on even more challenging foes and dangers in the next adventure!</p>
                   <p>If you want to learn more, check out our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo71hui?Falcon-s-Hollow-is-Doomed-Without-You">launch blog</a> or go straight to the BackerKit campaign page!</p>
                   <p id="entry6"><b>6</b><br>
                    Finding the right point of balance in a game like this can be tremendously difficult, especially when each combat features new monsters and characters frequently gain new items and abilities. While everybody wants to win, we also want to ensure that the victory feels earned— through clever choices, tactical teamwork, and a little bit of luck. Both the player and monster statistics went through several rounds of revision and playtesting to ensure that we got the sweet spot that we wanted. The fights are tough, but if you play smart and work together, you should win the day.</p>
                   <p id="entry7"><b>7</b><br>
                    This entry is not pointed to by anything, so if you're reading it, you must love secrets—that's great! We crammed <em>Pathfinder Quest</em> full of little surprises, whether it's the achievements you can check off (eventually unlocking a unique item), special uses for your character’s background or class abilities, lots of narrative twists and turns, and maybe even a secret passage. Oh, and when we say you shouldn't look through the item deck? You really shouldn't...</p>

Typically, after things settle down, we get together (remotely if necessary) and chat about everything from our favorite moments of the project to the rooms we wish we had explored.

                   <p>Before we go behind the scenes, you might want a refresher on how our party of gunslingers managed to reach the bottom of Pathfinder’s largest megadungeon:</p>

                   </ul>
                   <p>We’ll start with a glance at the hours, as this campaign clocked in close to some of the six-part Adventure Paths we’ve played. The foremost reason for this is that we roleplayed a ton; there is plenty of story to be found in Abomination Vaults, and we brought a party with a lot of depth. Privately, we set out to prove that just because we all had the same class, that didn’t mean our roleplaying would suffer. Second, we often featured many members of the Black Powder Cadre at each marathon, which meant more players at the table and slower combats. Lastly, we backtracked a bunch, including revisiting old levels to double-check certain areas or comb them again for anything we may have missed. We never did get the teleporters working, and we remember spending the better part of an afternoon being chased through the megadungeon by a flesh golem that always seemed to know where we were.</p>

                   <h2>Misses</h2>
                   <p>□ The luckiest shot of the campaign was the one that never landed. If you’ve read community feedback about Abomination Vaults, you’ve probably heard of the voidglutton on level four. While James Jacobs was kind enough to let it kill a single character so the rest could flee, for groups that <em>should</em> flee immediately but stick around, it’s bait for a TPK. Zoric went first and rolled a 29 to hit. If he had hit, we wouldn’t have known its armor class was insanely high, so we would have stayed – we all agree the project would have ended. The same can be said if Zoric rolled too low and missed. Our character builds weren’t developed enough and we were really struggling at those levels, so we ran on round one and never went back.</p>
                   <p>□ One of the factors that lead to our failure in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Majj1LxZzXc">final encounter</a> was a general lack of understanding regarding Belcorra, Nhimbaloth, and possible ways to defeat the ghost queen. On level three, we missed finding a secret door in the library that contained an important book: <em>The Whispering Reeds. </em>There is no way to overstate how key it was that we failed to obtain this, as it contained highly useful information about Nhimbaloth that might have changed our actions in the final encounter. Worse yet, you saw we missed several rooms the voidglutton was guarding, which contained more lore about Belcorra and the <em>Whispering Reeds</em>. Here is the best part: To make sure we didn’t miss anything, we returned to the library as higher-level characters and searched once more – but our Perception rolls were terrible.</p>
                   <p>□ So there we were on level nine, and we still had only a vague idea of what we needed to do to kill Belcorra permanently. Another bit of hope was lost when we ran into one of the encounters that can shut down and downright abuse a party of gunslingers. A clay golem AND a graveknight emerged from a secret vault together – in close quarters – with little room for our retreat. We were lucky to have survived, and never found the <em>fulcrum lattice </em>that would have helped us better understand what to do with the lenses we kept acquiring.&nbsp;</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Behind the Scenes:</h2>
                   <p>□ What we didn’t say at the outset, was that there had never been a single gunslinger (or equivalent class) in any of our campaigns – not one. We also have no plans, nor any desire to include a gunslinger in our future projects. We absolutely loved this journey and want it to remain a cherished memory. Instead, let this project be appreciated as a testament to the diversity of experiences that can be found within Pathfinder.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>□ There are props that don’t always show up in pictures but are with us throughout. Our favorite was the ammo crate mentioned briefly in the introduction blog. This crate with “OAD” emblazoned on it was at every marathon, whether it was in the studio, on the patio, or around us where we slept. We put dice, books, even Gatorade in it, and you can see it with the Amber Die alongside a set of our own <a href="https://www.norsefoundry.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq5JVcalDU1hu4uFC-1iKS6kNg8S_qF64XI7qXRvbWfFpAYsnq6">Norse Foundry</a> dice.</p>
                   <p>□ With the sheer number of session hours we clocked, we added more new members in this project than any that has come before, bringing the total to thirty-two since 1987. Congrats to Auralee, Theodora, Doug, and Karee! That makes two more nurses, another teacher, and the owner of <a href="https://criticalhitcookies.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqJmJRXEwPKZR-RBC_oOHI-bAkeDSoRv_6wfzHeYvOQfb22Hhz1">Critical Hit Cookies</a>!</p>
                   <p>□ Our projects have a lot more that we can’t always slow down to feature. One of these was every gunslinger’s friend: custom-painted magnetic trackers for whether your gun was loaded, jammed, or empty. Another was the set of bullet dice our GM handed us after the first marathon—one die for each player. The last was Doug’s painting of our favorite scene, which will forever hang on the walls of Fort Rannick (our headquarters) for future members to behold!</p>
                   <p>□ Want to play Abomination Vaults with us? We’ve been known to run the Vaults at <a href="https://tabletop.events/conventions/philadelphia-area-gaming-expo-page-3">Philly Area Gaming Expo</a>. Actually, we still have our character sheets and miniatures in case you want to play a party of gunslingers…</p>

                   <h2>Quote not to forget:</h2>
                   <p>(near the end)<br>
                     Adam: “Alright guys, it’s 5am, just keep that in mind.”<br>
                     Julian: “It’s 5am? We need to beat Belcorra quick, cause I gotta be in homeroom in two hours!”</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Aftermath</h2>
                   <p>The town of Otari wasn’t the same after the Black Powder Cadre failed to emerge from the Vaults that last time. The citizens had already begun to speak of us as the Roseguard reformed, and had no idea they would never see us again. By now, a statue to our first fallen companion—Rome—stood in the center of town. Ayla’s Oddities and Collectibles, a general store started by our companion Maloika, had become the go-to place for just about all your needs. Carman Rajani, the dejected blacksmith, used his acquaintance with us to win the election for mayor, and had promised to rename the town “Rome.” It was a slick move, as the town had been named Otari for the fallen companion of the Roseguard hundreds of years before.</p>
                   <p>When you arrive, you’ll find Otari a dark place, with an empty general store and a careless mayor. Yet, the damage we did to the Abomination Vaults will take Belcorra years to repair as she replaces her forces.</p>
                   <p>Which is just enough time for your group to finish her off.</p>
                   <br>

                   <p>Through this all, the most powerful runelord of them all, Xanderghul, runelord of pride, was ironically and continually caught off-guard. In the end, he was murdered before he could awaken, yet to the most powerful of all runelords, death was but one more indignity. One that only fueled his thirst for revenge against the world that, by all his own accounts, should be his to destroy.</p>

                   <p>In the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurepath/revengeoftherunelords" target="_blank">Revenge of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>, your characters are already mythic heroes—legendary figures who have accomplished more than most do in a lifetime. You’ve each answered a mythic calling and made names for yourselves—enough that you’ve attracted the attention of Queen Sorshen herself. Once one of the runelords, and arguably the only runelord who could stand toe-to-toe against Runelord Xanderghul, Queen Sorshen has seen her fellow six runelords stick to their natures and, time after time, be defeated by this new age’s heroes. Sorshen chose differently, in part after spending thousands of years in magical isolation with her own personal demons, and now she wants to help build societies rather than tear them down. And to do so, she admits she needs help from this era’s heroes—and who better to call upon than Golarion’s newest mythic adventurers?</p>
                   <p>Inside the <em>Revenge of the Runelords Player’s Guide</em>, you’ll find player-friendly, spoiler-free information and tips to help you make an exciting new 12th-level mythic character perfect for the Revenge of the Runelords Adventure Path!</p>

                   <ul>
                    <li>Character suggestions, including recommendations for ancestries, classes, languages, skills, feats, gear, and mythic callings and destinies well suited for this Adventure Path.</li>
                    <li>Six new backgrounds tailor-made to not only set your PC up as a hero of the Saga Lands, but to help explain why and how Queen Sorshen chose you to ask for help.</li>
                    <li>Four new mythic callings tailor made to match Revenge of the Runelords’ themes, as well as brief notes about new mythic destinies designed to fit into this Adventure Path’s story.</li>
                    <li>Advice for you and your GM on how to run Revenge of the Runelords as a follow-up Adventure Path for a previous campaign, be it Seven Dooms for Sandpoint, Myth-Speaker, or something else.</li>
                    <li>A “Recap of the Runelords.” The saga of the runelords is one that’s played out over multiple Adventure Paths and, indeed, multiple editions of the game—this “runelords primer” intends to bring new players up to speed (or to remind established players of what’s come before) in as spoiler-free a way as possible as to who these runelords are and what they’ve been up to.</li>
                    <li>Finally, a brief description of the capital city of New Thassilon, known now as Xin-Eurythinia (once known not so long ago as Xin-Shalast), presents you with a brief gazetteer of the remote metropolis where this campaign begins, but details six unusual downtime activities your PCs can engage in as the campaign begins—or with your GM’s approval—even before!</li>

                   <h3><em>PFS2 #6-00: Salt of the Ocean</em></h3>
                   <p>Hi everyone, I’m Jacob W. Michaels (he/him), one of the writers of PFS Year 6’s <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #</em><em>6-00 Salt of the Ocean</em>, which was my first special. This was a pirate adventure, so I looked at classic pirate stories for inspiration, including <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl</em> (but so many others too; more than I can really list). I had so much fun trying to bring as many nautical and piratical references to the adventure as possible, giving players a great chance for underwater fights and thematic sailing moments—I had a blast creating pirate demons and a demonic pirate ship. I also loved delving into Pathfinder history, too, since this adventure’s background dated to the earliest days of the Society. I hope everyone got as much of a kick out of Averill Quint calling their modern Pathfinders “tomb robbers and demon worshippers” because he thinks they’re trying to loot Pathfinder property as I did. Lastly, shout out to my co-author, Rigby Bendele. This was my first time co-writing a scenario and it was smooth sailing (sorry, couldn’t resist one more nautical reference…) working with Rigby and making sure our two halves of the adventure meshed.</p>

                   <h3><em>PFS2 #6-05: Silver Bark, Golden Blades</em></h3>
                   <p>Hello all, my name is Hilary Moon Murphy (aka Hmm)! One of my favorite scenarios to GM was <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021ce?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-106-Lost-on-the-Spirit-Road"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-06 Lost on the Spirit Road</em></a>, so of course I wanted to create a companion piece for it.</p>
                   <p>My goal was to create a truly repeatable adventure: one that would continue to surprise players no matter how many times they played it previously. Inspired by two ‘make your own dungeon’ adventures in PF1, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9oik?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-807-From-the-Tome-of-Righteous-Repose"><em>From the Tome of Righteous Repose</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0t?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-909-Beyond-the-Halflight-Path"><em>Beyond the Halflight Path</em></a>, I decided to have two separate dungeons, three possible bosses, and to allow GMs to put their monsters and traps anywhere on the map.</p>
                   <p>My favorite part of <em>Silver Bark, Golden Blades</em> was including the Risuchō, the adorable network of squirrel-rabbit mail carriers that are the primary postal service of the Forest of Spirits. Being able to showcase them made me so very happy.</p>
                   <p>If you enjoy my adventures, please look for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0e8yu?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-110-Rites-of-Rekindling"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-10: Rites of Rekindling</em></a>, which will be coming out this November! Join me for whimsy and a solar celebration on the formerly frozen planet of Lajok!</p>

                   <h2>Dave Nelson</h2>
                   <h3><em>PFS2 #6-08: Upon Wheels and Rime</em></h3>
                   <p>Greetings Pathfinders! My name is Dave Nelson, a name you've probably seen on several Pathfinder books throughout the years, but never on a Society Scenario. That changed last year, when I got tasked to write <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario </em><em>#6-08: Upon Wheels and Rime</em>. Starting Golarion's journey towards trains (something I've wanted the setting to have for a while) was both a big honor and tricky task for my first Scenario. However, it seems I did something right, as it is not only the most requested adventure of the year but was also nominated for an Ennie. I want to thank everyone who played and enjoyed the scenario and look forward to seeing how the development of the train progresses (hopefully on chicken legs). If you want to keep up with what I'm doing next you can follow me on BlueSky @davicthegrey.bksy.social and find an up-to-date list of my credits here: <a href="https://davicthegrey.carrd.co/">https://davicthegrey.carrd.co/</a> If you want more adventures from me, you can check out my first Adventure Path in the form of <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0bt00">Pathfinder Adventure Path #218 Titanbane</a></em>, which just released. See everyone again in the next one!</p>

                   <p>Hi folks! I’m Linda Zayas-Palmer (she/her), former development manager for Paizo’s narrative team and current full-time freelancer. For Year 6, I wrote <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario </em><em>#6-09: The Power of Legends</em>. With the release of <em>War of Immortals</em> on the horizon, the org play team tapped me to write an adventure to highlight the new mythic rules. I have fond memories of playing around with mythic abilities in the Destiny of the Sands series for First Edition Pathfinder Society. While Destiny of the Sands features Pathfinder agents in the middle of their careers, Power of Legends takes characters who are among the Society’s strongest and gives them reality-bending powers to strike down their foes. So naturally, the PCs needed some larger-than-life opposition. The main villain’s a doozy, but the other encounters the PCs fight all have their own mythic tricks to them too. The scenario’s runtime is longer than a typical PFS adventure, so if you’re a GM planning to throw this trial at your players, I recommend carving out an extra hour or two.</p>
                   <p>You can find me on my Youtube stream Arcane Mark on Tuesdays at 8pm Eastern and Saturdays at 1pm Eastern (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@arcanemark2562">https://www.youtube.com/@arcanemark2562</a>), and on the Arcane Mark Discord (<a href="http://tiny.cc/arcanemark">tiny.cc/arcanemark</a>). My most recently released works are the Pathfinder Society<em> Battle of Hellknight Hill</em> special event that debuted at GenCon, as well as Roll For Combat’s <em>Battlezoo Bestiary: Elemental Storm</em>, which I developed and also wrote for.</p>

                   <h3><em>PFS2 #6-12: The Burning of Greensteeples</em> and <em>PFS2 #6-99: Under the Eye of the Mantis</em></h3>
                   <p>Welcome back to the fun, friends! You’re just in time for everything to Hells with the coming season of aggression—especially from Cheliax. I’ll be your guide for … no wait… I wrote stuff!</p>
                   <p>I’m Joseph Blomquist (he/him), and you’ve seen my words in the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide,</em><em>Mechageddon!,</em> a bunch of backmatter in various Pathfinder and Starfinder AP volumes, quite a few PFS and SFS adventures, and a slew of other Paizo products and games around the industry. This season, I was tapped for two very different Pathfinder Adventures.</p>
                   <p>The first, #<em>6-12: The Buring of Greensteeples</em> was a return to one of my favorite (and most polarizing) adventures, #<em>3-04: The Devil-Wrought Disappearance</em>. Shay asked if I would be interested in bookending that exploration into Varian Jeggare’s home, and I leapt at the chance. Not only did I get to wrap up some hanging storylines I set up in 3-04, but I hinted at another from #<em>4-02 Return to the Grave</em>, and set up a bit of the overarching theme of Season 7!</p>
                   <p>Then came #<em>6-99: Under the Eye of the Mantis.</em> For this GenCon special, I was paired with one of my favorite people, Michael Bramnik, and found that our styles complement each other perfectly (Good job Devs!). Mike and I wanted to give multi-table players some new experiences in PFS specials, and I think we did a great job, bringing recent storylines together while bringing back classic or forgotten NPCs. It was a ton of fun to work on.</p>
                   <p>You can find me at the blog I never update <a href="http://www.underwearontheoutside.com/">www.UnderwearOnTheOutside.com</a> or as @Doctormono on Bluesky. Stay tuned, I have more Paizo work coming this year, and I can’t wait for you to have a chance to dive in.</p>

                   <h2>Alison Cybe (they/them)</h2>
                   <h3><em>PFS2 #6-15: Lost and Forgotten</em></h3>
                   <p>Hi there, I'm Alison Cybe (they/them, at least for as long as our benevolent UK government allows me to use such pronouns), and I designed <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-15: Lost and Forgotten</em>.</p>
                   <p>When I designed this adventure I wanted to create a light, puzzle-oriented dungeon crawl where the tension wasn’t in whether the party survived, but in how they explored. The aim was flexibility—letting tables approach challenges at their own pace, try things in any order, and focus on interaction and creativity without feeling like they’d “failed” their way out of progress.</p>
                   <p>Some reviewers took this to mean “the rolls don’t matter.” In truth, they matter in the same way a chess move matters—you can play badly and still finish the game, but your choices shape the state of the board. Time pressure, resource attrition, and the shifting initiative bonuses in the second act were all designed to be felt cumulatively rather than ending the scenario on a single failed check. Pathfinder Society scenarios must work for a broad range of tables, so the safety net is intentional—especially in puzzle-centric adventures where a single failed roll shouldn’t brick the experience for everyone else. Likewise, the “helpful” NPC wasn’t there to take over, but to keep momentum at tables where the GM might otherwise have to stall play until someone guessed the One True Answer™. I'm truly sorry that people did not enjoy this adventure.</p>
                   <p>You can find me on Bluesky and Facebook as Alison Cybe, where I post about writing, gaming, and occasionally pictures of my cat pretending to solve riddles better than my playtest groups.</p>

                   <p>Hi, my name is Shan Wolf and I loved being an author on <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-18: Symposium on a Fallen God</em> It gave me a great chance to play with aspects of the Godsrain that I hadn't even thought about, warshards! I felt inspired during the writing of this scenario by both academic debates and rap battles. The ability to use your knowledge and vocabulary to not only educate, but make fun of your opponent in a friendly manner. I was also told I could get to dig into the great rules for the exemplar class to make an enemy and I hope people found the encounter fun. I'd also like to take this opportunity to offer a heartfelt thank you to our wonderful Pathfinder Society Devs, as I'm extremely grateful to be given the opportunity to write adventures for everyone.</p>
                   <p>I hope those who got to play the scenario had a blast, and thank you all.</p>
                   <p>To learn more about me, you can find me at shanwolf.bsky.social where you'll see me muse about various things but mostly social justice topics and how they relate to the world.</p>

                   <h3><em>PFS2 #6-19: What Walks Again</em></h3>
                   <p>I'm Scott D. Young, from Winnipeg, Canada, Paizo contributor and proud father of two amazing teens and one orange cat. My most recent scenario for Pathfinder Society was #6-19, <em>What Walks Again</em>. What a treat to be able to bring back the evil mastermind of a previous Adventure Path, long thought dead. I love being able to work with characters and stories that have history to work around while developing new bits of lore. Trying to create a stat block that was both evocative of the original fiend, and yet made sense with the story, was a real challenge. The Paizo freelance community is wonderful, though, and I was able to get a seasoned team of scenario authors to playtest the final combat. That, plus Shay Snow's development magic, and a storied NPC behind the scenes make for a final encounter that I hope will be memorable.</p>
                   <p>Coming in September, <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-06Magic in the Mist</em> is my first scenario of Starfinder Second Edition, and I'm really looking forward to doing more in the Starfinder Universe in future. You can find me on Discord (gm_lamplighter) and at various online conventions throughout the year.</p>

                   <h3><em>PFS2 Quest #24: Tanuki Trouble</em></h3>
                   <p>Hai tai! Greetings, Pathfinders! I had a lot of fun crafting <em>Tanuki Trouble</em>, and I hope you had even half as much fun playing it! If you haven’t had the chance to play it, <em>Tanuki Trouble</em> is a light-hearted adventure designed for players of all ages, with everything from a raucous party to an opportunity to play matchmaker to exciting combat. As you might expect from the name, it features tanuki, one of Tian Xia’s cutest ancestries and one of my favorite creatures from Japanese folklore. Tanuki are traditionally very whimsical and fun-loving, which made having Kodomi Village embroiled in an out-of-control prank war a natural fit. It also meant that I could ask for art of a tanuki holding a pie-launching crossbow, which makes me smile every time I see it.</p>
                   <p>In other Pathfinder news, I worked on <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Draconic Codex</em>, which is due to come out in about a month. I can’t wait for GMs to introduce players to my draconic children. If you want to find out what I worked on for the book, stay tuned to my BlueSky account @hiromicota.</p>

Now, let’s take a look at the Pathfinder section of the new store.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p><strong>Coming Soon</strong> showcases all announced products that are not yet available for sale for each brand. For example, you won’t find upcoming Starfinder products in the Coming Soon folder in the Pathfinder section, but anything with a Pathfinder logo will be visible here.</p>
                   <p><strong>New to Roleplaying</strong> displays introductory products like the Pathfinder Beginner Box and the Pathfinder Player Core and makes it easier for new players to find the things they might be looking for.</p>
                   <p>The others are self-explanatory, though one thing to note though is that with the new store, products can appear in more than one place. This is especially true of <strong>Pathfinder Partners</strong>, who are licensed partners whose products will appear next to the products they are built for (like the Foundry VTT version of an Adventure Path showing up alongside the Adventure Path).</p>
                   <p>Each section also has its own filters. You can refine products visible to you on a page by clicking a radio button and it will then hide the products that don’t match your search. For example, there is a Brand filter that lets you choose between Pathfinder First Edition, Pathfinder Second Edition, and Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster. There is also one for just Pathfinder, which shows Pathfinder products regardless of what edition you are playing (like pawns, miniatures, etc.).Pathfinder Adventures has filters for Level Ranges; Miniatures has filters for Creature Type (Aberration, Beast, etc.), Material (metal or plastic), Painted (yes/no), Player Character, Rarity, and Size. As you move into specific product categories (like Adventures), the filters change to show only the filter options that exist in that category.</p>

                   <p><strong>Presentation</strong>: New releases for Pathfinder Second Edition and Starfinder Second Edition have extra previews associated with them. Our goal is to provide previews of the covers, table of contents, and a 2-page spread with every release. Each page will also have a “stat block” at the bottom that lists the weight, dimensions, Paizo SKU#, UPC, and page count for the selected product.</p>
                   <p><strong>Variants on the Same Page:</strong> Hardcover, Sketch, Special Edition, and Pocket Edition books will all live on the same page. Clicking the button will change the image that’s displayed as well as change the cost for that book. This makes it easier to show the entirety of the product’s formats in one place and ensure you’re getting exactly the version you want to get. The exception to that are PDFs, which live in a separate <strong>Digital Editions</strong> folder under each category.</p>

                   <h2>What to Expect/What’s Changing</h2>
                   <p>The Paizo ecommerce store has been built over the decades to be very flexible, and we’re going to lose some of that flexibility as we transition to a new store. Here are some changes that are coming directly as a result of the new store.</p>
                   <p><strong>Site Downtime:</strong> Paizo.com will go dark for roughly two days when we start the conversion. During this time, the tech team will be squaring up the data we have in the old store and making sure it’s updated in the new store. That includes things like balancing gift cards, vouchers, Humble Bundle codes, purchase history, subscriptions, your downloads, and a bunch of other data.</p>
                   <p><strong>Sidecart</strong>: The process by which you add items to future subscription orders is changing. We’ll cover that in the subscription blog.</p>
                   <p><strong>Wishlists</strong>: Your current wishlists will be going away with the launch of the new store. If there are lists you want to retain, please copy them all down in the next week or so. You can create multiple wishlists in BigCommerce, such as one for Holiday Gifts, My Next Campaign, or Revenge of the Runelords. You can share a wishlist to make it public for friends and family or keep it private.</p>

                   <p><strong>Foundry VTT:</strong> We’ve been offering two different versions of Foundry VTT products: one that includes the PDF and the code together, and one that offers just the code at a discount for customers who already owned the PDF. The new store unfortunately can’t support gating a product behind PDF ownership, so we’ll be offering our Foundry modules exclusively as code-only items and pricing them similarly to the code-only Paizo products already available for purchase on the official Foundry storefront.</p>
                   <p>While that does mean that our existing PDF + Foundry bundles and discounts for PDF ownership will be going away with the launch of the new store, we fully plan to explore new options in the near future that can offer a similar combined value to customers who invest deeply into digital content.</p>
                   <p>The existing PDF discounts will remain in place until the launch of the new store, so if you already own the PDFs for any FVTT products you've been planning to pick up, you still have a chance to get them at a substantial discount!</p>
                   <p><strong>Preorders</strong>: The preorder window for future products is now limited to 7 days prior to street date. You’ll see the release date under the title, and it won’t give you an option to select any format to make a purchase until the 7-day window opens. If you’re one of the few customers who use preorders (bless you!), we encourage you to subscribe instead. That will grant you the free PDF and allow it to ship early.</p>

Our teams are hunting down pesky gremlins, and we’re doing end-to-end testing on the systems that are currently working. Thank you again for your continued support as we make this big move to a new platform!</p>

                   <p>Her ship—her <em>former</em> ship, she mentally chided herself once again—held so much excitement. More than she and her crew ever expected when they decided not to rob the agents that hired her for transport all those years ago. Piracy was boring in comparison—a realization that vexes her every time she sees her former vessel, and one hitting especially hard today.</p>
                   <p>“Enough o’ this!” she scolded herself. “Eras would laugh like there’s no tomorrow if I was mopin’ like this where he could see.” She’d talked herself back onto the <em>Pixie</em> several times for “joint operations,” but Eras the Needle, the <em>Grinning Pixie</em>’s current venture-captain, had finally had enough of that excuse. She’d accidentally tried to take command too many times, seems like. “Ship’s not mine anymore. Never really was. Faster you get that into your thick skull, Calisro, the faster we can get past it.” She gazed at her reflection in the polished shield in her captain’s stateroom, the closest thing to a mirror she bothered to keep. “You’re a gods-damned pirate, and even if you don’t care for theft like you used to, the sailing’s still in your blood. ’Sides, it’s not like we gave up on the piracy entirely.” A grin crossed her face as she thought of the countless Aspis transports and merchants flying Chelaxian colors she’d hit, and less savory types as well. “Besmara’ll see me drowned if I turn into a dour mess every time that ship’s in port with me.”</p>
                   <p>She looked into the mirrored shield, determination overtaking her features. “The <em>Payoff</em> don’t feel like mine ’cause I haven’t let it. Haven’t given it the chance to be the ship it deserves to be. The crew, too. They’re restless. They stayed out because this Society gig was as exciting for them as it was for me.” She began to pace across her cabin. “I’ll be damned if I spend my time sulking over that ship one more day. If adventure and the unknown is what made that ship feel like mine, then I believe we’ll just have to find some more.” She pulled out her sea charts, looking over ports and routes. “Been there. And there. Dozens of times there. Been all over this whole gods-damned Inner Sea ten times over or more. In <em>that ship</em>.” A realization slowly dawned on her face. “Then we’ll just go beyond.”</p>
                   <p>She dug through her charts, finding some older ones purchased long ago and never used. “Let’s hope that blasted Godsrain didn’t affect these routes too much.” She smiled to herself. “Hells, even if they did, it’ll just make things more interesting. Crew’s been dying for interesting. We’ll be going where the Society’s never been.” She rushed out her door and shouted for her first mate, an old iruxi salt named Ixfial who’d proven his worth countless times after she came into possession of the <em>Glorious Payoff</em>. Much of her crew had stayed from her old days as a Free Captain of the Shackles, but some had left to join that foolhardy assault on the Whispering Tyrant. They never returned.</p>
                   <p>“What’s the word, captain?” the tall, silver-scaled sailor asked, clearly ready to be back on the open sea himself.</p>
                   <p>“We’re set to sail? Water and provisions all aboard? I know we’ve got that kineticist we picked up in Riddleport, but I don’t want all our eggs in one basket.” She looked out over the crew and could sense the same restlessness she was feeling.</p>
                   <p>“Aye, captain. Ready at your command,” he said, grinning at seeing his captain acting more like herself.</p>
                   <p>“Consider the command given. We sail for Iblydos.” Calisro’s gaze was fixed on the southern horizon, opposite the bustle of Absalom to the ship’s north.</p>
                   <p>“Iblydos? But we’ve never…”</p>
                   <p>“Sailed those waters? Of course not! But we’re damned well going to fix that. A little voyage somewhere new wouldn’t cause you to molt on me, would it?” She grinned, chiding her first officer.</p>
                   <p>He recovered, a fierce smile now covering his face. This was the captain he knew. “Of course not, captain!” He turned to the crew and began to shout orders, readying the vessel to sail south.</p>
                   <p>As her crew began the arduous work of preparing the vessel, Calisro walked back to her cabin. “Decemvirate thinks they can just buy me off,” she muttered. “I’m a damned venture-captain, same as Eras. Can set up shop wherever I please. A pirate beyond that. Can plunder where I please. This is my ship, and the <em>Glorious Payoff</em> will see to it that we earn its namesake. No one else at the Society to get in my way, no existing relationships to worry about or scoldings from Eliza or that thrice-damned Decemvirate for ‘causing trouble.’ That lot didn’t seem to mind too much when I captured six Aspis caravels in as many days.”</p>
                   <p>Her old ship now entirely forgotten, she turned back to her charts. “Let’s see what the waters of the Kardaji Bay can offer me. Can’t imagine it’ll be boring.”</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hello Starfinders!<br>
                    You’re formally invited to attend the Sloughscar Summit this month, which is to take place on the planet Akiton! First Seeker Sarmak has scheduled this diplomatic event to strengthen ties between the various groups interested in exploring the mysterious Wreck of the <em>Returned</em>—a massive starship that recently crashed in the region. As these groups have been clashing at every turn, First Seeker Sarmak is looking for Starfinders willing to work security for the event and put in a good word with the bickering factions. Let’s hope all goes smoothly…</p>

                   <p>Meanwhile, on the planet Castrovel, a mysterious spire shrouded in purple mist has been seen in the jungles of Ukulam, blinking in and out of sight over several minutes before vanishing without a trace. These sightings are periodic but persistent, yet scientists, explorers, and tourists have all been unable to reach the site or pinpoint its exact location. Intrigued by reports of the vanishing spire, Venture-Captain Arvin has secured permission to dispatch a team of Starfinders to Ukulam to locate and explore the mysterious structure.</p>

                   <p>Turning our eyes to Pathfinder, we have <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurepath/mythspeaker"><em>Myth-Speaker</em></a>, an AP coming out that is set in Iblydos, a land very similar to earth’s ancient Greece. What kind of program stewards would we be if we didn’t let you run amok there first?</p>
                   <p>While the city-states of Iblydos have a long and storied history, the Pathfinder Society has little connection to and fewer resources in that part of Golarion. Thus, when Venture-Captain Calisro Bennary has the opportunity to set a lodge up in Hoimpeia, one of Iblydos’s chief port cities, she races back to Absalom to collect veteran agents for the task. Her contact isn't giving connections and a site for a lodge away for free. Something has been causing trouble around local trade routes, and while the authorities are happy to let merchants take longer routes, this change has cost a particular trader dearly. If the Pathfinders can clear up the shipping lanes, this merchant will move heaven and earth to get them a foothold in Iblydos.</p>

                   <p>Over in Absalom, there are political rumblings. Lord Gulv Tevineg, recently returned from Cheliax, has called a session with the Grand Council to discuss Absalom’s standing in the current aggressions between Cheliax and Andoran. As Chun Hye-Seung of the First Guard is putting together guard rotations, she realizes she’s short on guards and pulls some strings to borrow some of the Pathfinder Society’s more experienced adventurers to (hopefully) be politically delicate guards for the ambassador and his family. The Pathfinders have their work cut out for them, however, as they face down saboteurs, devils, and a… painting?</p>

                   <h1>Pathfinder Society News</h1>
                   <p>As we <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo713yi?Upcoming-Changes-to-Pathfinder-Adventures">announced last month</a>, some changes are coming to Pathfinder Society Scenarios.</p>
                   <p>Beginning in January of 2026, we will release two Pathfinder Society scenarios per month. These scenarios will be 2–3 hours in length with one band of levels, such as levels 1–2 or 3–4. Each scenario will still award 4 XP, 10 Treasure Bundles, and 4 Reputation with a faction. We will also no longer use Challenge Points; scenarios will instead be presented with a baseline encounter and adjustments to make the encounter easier or harder based on the table. We’ll also be releasing the final Pathfinder Quest in December. You can learn more about these changes, as well as the transition into hardcover Adventure Paths, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo713yi?Upcoming-Changes-to-Pathfinder-Adventures">in this blog</a>!</p>
                   <p>In sanctioning news, two new adventures have been sanctioned! The <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurepath/mythspeaker"><em>Myth-Speaker Adventure Path </em></a>is now available to play for Pathfinder Society credit, as well as the new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0bszx"><em>Pathfinder Game Night: Dawn of the Frogs</em></a>. You can find sanctioning documents for these adventures on their product pages.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1>Starfinder Society News</h1>
                   <p>Starfinder Society’s launch month saw hundreds of tables run worldwide for thousands of players! We hope you’ve all enjoyed our launch scenarios and are eagerly looking forward to the upcoming Invasion’s Edge storyline. I promise you, the Starfinder team has some great things in store for this year.</p>
                   <p>Over the past month we’ve made some changes and clarifications to the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Starfinder Society Character Options page</a>, as well as the <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=Guide-to-Organized-Play:-Starfinder-Society---Second-Edition">Guide to Organized Play</a>, to smooth out some of the wrinkles we encountered at Gen Con and in the weeks following. This will be an ongoing process, but we appreciate your patience as we work to answer your questions and sort out any missing pieces. If you think something on either of these pages is wrong or could be clearer, please don’t hesitate to let us know!</p>
                   <p>This month <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0bt09?Starfinder-GM-Core"><em>Starfinder GM Core</em></a> released; while it has been reviewed and “sanctioned,” in practice this is largely a GM-focused book. As such, the minimal player options in this book, such as vehicles, are not available for purchase or use by default. We’ll be sure to mine this book for subsystems and mechanics to use in upcoming adventures!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1>GM Recognition</h1>
                   <h2>GM Ranks</h2>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had <strong>five</strong> GMs reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2):</strong> Matt Duval, Alexandre Menard, Allan C Ong (UncleFroggy), Loren Schmidt</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Nova</strong><strong>(SFS1):</strong> James Hargrave</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay(at)paizo(dot)com</a>.</p>
                   <br>

While the Pathfinders are moving through the town, they learn of a secret way into the citadel, and though it's not without danger, they could learn&nbsp;<em>so much</em>&nbsp;about the enemy...</p>

                   <p>When a nascent godling called the Newborn was birthed from the planet Aucturn in 324 AG, chunks of its planetary womb and embryonic fluids were cast across the Pact Worlds. Most of this debris—called aucturnite—collected at the outer rim of the system, in a region known as the Gelid Edge. This forlorn field of ice and technomagical debris is a realm of occult power, haunted starship wrecks, and unknown horrors. Yet for all its dangers, the Gelid Edge is a frontier of new discoveries and forbidden knowledge, and many Newborn evangelists, anomaly hunters, and occult researchers have flocked to the region to learn its secrets.</p>
                   <p>When the Starfinder Society is contacted by scientists from Dreamlink Laboratories, who claim to have made an important discovery in the Gelid Edge, Venture-Captain Arvin dispatches a team of agents to investigate. Unfortunately, something has invaded Dreamlink Labs… and time is running short for the lab’s survivors.</p>

One of these pirates is especially overconfident and believes she can win more favor with a direct attack on Andoran’s Augustana shipyards. Coincidentally, the Pathfinder Society is in the market for a new ship, and the heads of Supplies and Procurement are touring the shipyards when the attack begins. As the escorts for Nairaba and Kitsch, the two aforementioned heads of their divisions, it's up to you to keep your charges safe while dealing with the chaos.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Paizo has built itself upon the strength of its adventures—the first offerings we published set in the world of Golarion were adventures of different types, ranging from short encounters with maps and minis included to classic 32-page softcover standalone modules, and of course, the flagship monthly adventure line: Pathfinder. This line’s name became the more specific “Pathfinder Adventure Path” two years later when we launched the Pathfinder RPG, but ever since that first volume kicked off Rise of the Runelords nearly two decades ago, the format has largely remained the same. Even as we’ve recently shifted to a focus on three-part Adventure Paths, the physical nature of the product hasn’t changed from a softcover 96-page monthly softcover book.</p>
                   <p>This format was in part a natural evolution of the monthly magazine subscription model of Paizo’s early days as a magazine publisher, but it was also a necessary side effect of the work and cost it takes to produce an entire campaign. Over the course of 222 months (of which only one was skipped a few years ago when we released the double-sized “Seven Dooms for Sandpoint”), we kept the Adventure Path line going on that regular schedule. But also over the course of 222 months, the world has changed.</p>
                   <p>And it’s time for the Adventure Path to change with it.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Hardcover Adventure Paths</h2>
                   <p>Starting next year, we are transitioning from a softcover, serialized, monthly format for Adventure Paths to a quarterly hardcover all-in-one format. We’re still committed to publishing four Adventure Paths a year, but these will now be published as four separate hardcover books rather than 12 softcover books. This will allow a GM to have the entire Adventure Path in hand from the start, which should help those who are eager to start their new campaigns on “day 1” of release but who have struggled with how to adjust the adventure for their table while not having details for the later parts in hand. It’ll also help friendly local game stores keep entire Adventure Paths in stock and will prevent situations where parts of an Adventure Path go out of print before others, rendering the entire campaign difficult or even impossible for GMs who prefer physical media to collect. And from a creative side, it allows us, the writers and developers of the Adventure Paths, a lot more freedom in how to present the story—no longer do we have the specter of “what if the GM doesn’t have the other book” looming over us, forcing us to make decisions on encounters and plots that limit what happens in that 96-page softcover to resources found only in that particular section of the adventure.</p>
                   <p>A three-part Adventure Path consists of 96 pages of content split over three books, for a total of 288 pages in all. The new format will start at 256 pages. On its face, reducing overall pages by 32 would seem to reduce the amount of content you get in each Adventure Path, but that’s not quite accurate, since a single volume is more efficient in several ways. We don’t have to print multiple tables of contents or multiple ORC pages, and the number of back-of-the-book advertisements overall will drop from 8 to 12 to potentially as few as 2. Adventure Toolboxes will be more efficient, and we’ll have greater flexibility in what sorts of support articles we want to include. In the end, you’ll still have the same amount of actual adventure content in a 256-page hardcover as you did in three 96-page softcovers, but it’ll cost you less overall!</p>
                   <p>Here are some more facts about the new Adventure Path format:</p>
                   <p>• Each volume will be at least 256 pages long—some might be a little longer, but we’re hoping to keep them relatively the same length.</p>
                   <p>• Each hardcover Adventure Path will present 9 to 10 levels of play, the same as we’ve been doing for the past several years. Our plan is to do at least one a year that starts at 1st level, one a year that ends at 20th level, and then with the other two, potentially starting anywhere in between.</p>
                   <p>• We’re doing four a year, but the release schedules will be a bit flexible—one will come out every quarter (so, one in January–March, one in April–June, and so on), but they won’t necessarily be separated by three months each time; this allows us more flexibility internally when an Adventure Path might be more complicated, but also makes it easier to release things in time for conventions or holidays (which don’t always line up in a nice “once every three months” row).</p>
                   <p>• We’ll still be doing free downloadable Player’s Guides for each of them!</p>
                   <p>• Hardcover formats make it much easier for us to reprint entire Adventure Paths if they prove popular, letting us have more time to bring back older out-of-print Adventure Paths (like the recently released Gatewalkers Adventure Path compilation) rather than reformatting recent three-part APs that happened to sell out while still in demand.</p>
                   <p>• A standard hardcover Adventure Path will have an MSRP of $79.99, which is less expensive than the current $89.97 price for three 96-page softcover volumes. The total price is much less when you factor in potential shipping costs split over three books instead of one!</p>
                   <p>In the end, this is a change that I’m not only excited to embrace, but thankful. Adventure Paths are best enjoyed, in my opinion, all at once, and that can only happen if we move away from the older format and embrace the new. It’s certainly a big change, but in the end, it’s a good one! I’ll be lurking around in the comments for this blog and will be eager to answer additional questions folks have, but in the meantime—here’s a teaser of what we’ve got planned for early 2026’s hardcover Adventure Paths!</p>
                   <p><strong>Hellbreakers:</strong> A 1st- to 10th-level campaign involving the outbreak of the war between Andoran and Cheliax. Can your PCs make the difference in this violent clash that threatens two of Golarion’s most bitter rival nations?</p>
                   <p><strong>Hell’s Destiny:</strong> An 11th- to 20th-level campaign that continues the war-torn story from <em>Hellbreakers</em> and can also work on its own as a high-powered campaign. Can your PCs stop a truly diabolical threat from engulfing the Inner Sea region and casting the continent of Avistan into ruin?</p>

                   <h2>Pathfinder Organized Play Scenarios</h2>
                   <p>Greetings, Pathfinders!</p>
                   <p>With the debut of the Year of Battle’s Spark, we’ve made a few changes to our standard Pathfinder Society scenario layout to simplify things for GMs and ensure more efficient development behind the scenes here at Paizo. For example, scenarios will now match our Adventure Path encounter format, with “micro” stat blocks for non-custom enemies and hazards found in the <em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em> or <em>GM Core</em>. This will keep overall scenario sizes more manageable and prevent replication of basic information already presented in the core rules.</p>
                   <p>We’ve already implemented this change, but there are others on the horizon, as well. With the January 2026 release of <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-09: The Chitterwood Walks, Part 1: Scrambling the Tribes</em> by Genevieve Rudat Olejnik, our scenarios will use a single level band, with this scenario set at levels 3–4. You can expect to see two Pathfinder Society scenarios released each month from January onward, with the Year of Battle’s Spark ending with 22 scenarios! Somewhat smaller in size than our most recent offerings, these new-format scenarios are designed to be run in 3 hours rather than 4, making it easier for event organizers to schedule weeknight slots at game stores, where there often aren’t enough hours in an evening to squeeze in our current longer scenarios. (Each scenario will still award 4 XP and 10 Treasure Bundles, as well as 4 Reputation with your chosen faction.) Of course, we’ll continue to endeavor to include juicy roleplaying encounters and other opportunities to flex to longer run-times as needed for conventions and other venues, but the baseline approach will be toward tighter, more-focused adventures.</p>
                   <p>Additionally, we’ll no longer be using challenge points to scale encounters. Encounters will be written for six PCs, and we’ll provide guidance on offering either a “Harder” or “Easier” experience based on the table you’re GMing for! This matches up with changes we’re implementing in Starfinder Society and is intended to help streamline the overall experience at the table and reduce some of the complexity and GM load in preparation.</p>
                   <p>As we’ll be providing more content through the main scenario line, our final quest will be <em>Pathfinder Quest #27: Within the Glacier</em> by Kate Tremaine, debuting this December. Pathfinder Quests were always intended as introductory short scenarios to introduce the campaign to new players, and with nearly 30 of them available, there are plenty to choose from. We plan to use some of the resources currently aimed at Quests for exciting new Pathfinder Society projects that we’ll be discussing in future updates.</p>
                   <p>Thank you for your continued support of the Pathfinder Society campaign and for rolling with these new changes. As the line’s primary developer, I’m excited about the opportunities provided by the updated scenario format and look forward to a bright and exciting future for the campaign!</p>
                   <p>As we continue to introduce additional updates, we’ll be sure to share them here in this space.</p>
                   <p>I’m thrilled for the future of Organized Play and can’t wait to share it all with y’all!</p>
                   <p>Until then, remember the credo of the Pathfinder Society: Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

                   <p>We’re now soliciting volunteers for the show! We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Master</strong>: Run tables of Pathfinder and Starfinder Society quests and scenarios.</li>
                    <li><strong>Board Game Demo GM</strong>: Run demo tables for Pathfinder Quest and Pathfinder Monster Match. Applicants should have strong board game knowledge (both our games and general board games) and preferably have related demo experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headquarters (HQ)</strong>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion</li>

                   <p>Please read this important information before applying:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the PAX Unplugged Organizing Committee. Filling this form out does not guarantee acceptance; you will receive an email with further information from the PAXU committee.</li>
                    <li>PAX Unplugged schedules will be assigned by the committee. You will be asked for your preference of system and level, but you will not necessarily be able to choose the specific scenario(s) you run. The committee’s intention is to assign people to run the same scenario multiple times during the weekend. There is a free-form field at the end of the form to enter specific requests, though there’s no guarantee they will be honored.</li>
                    <li>Reward information is listed in the table below. GMs who do not qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one.</li>
                    <li>Applications will be processed on a rolling basis, beginning no later than September 16. The earlier you get your application in, the more likely it is you’ll get the scenarios you want. Please be patient as we put the final details on the convention internally before we send out GM emails!</li>
                    <li>Please note that we will <strong>not</strong> be providing hotel rooms for GMs. All GMs will need to provide their own accommodation. Parking reimbursement is available for 8+ slot GMs if requested. 
                     <ul>
                      <li>A sub-note on this: the weekend of PAX is <em>also</em> the weekend of the Philadelphia marathon. We recommend GMs make housing/parking arrangements ASAP!</li>
                     </ul></li>
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at paxunplugged@gmail.com</li>

                     Starfinder Society Second Edition has been released into the galaxy and is shining bright! This month, we’re adding two more scenarios into the mix: one set at the heart of the Pact Worlds, Absalom Station, and the other on the fringes of the system in the Gelid Edge. Let’s dive in!</p>
                   <p>When a nascent godling called the Newborn was birthed from the planet Aucturn in 324 AG, chunks of its planetary womb and embryonic fluids were cast across the Pact Worlds. Most of this debris—called aucturnite—collected at the outer rim of the system in a region known as the Gelid Edge. This forlorn field of ice and technomagical debris is a realm of occult power, haunted starship wrecks, and unknown horrors. Yet for all its dangers, the Gelid Edge is a frontier of new discoveries and forbidden knowledge, and many Newborn evangelists, anomaly hunters, and occult researchers have flocked to the region to learn its secrets.</p>
                   <p>When the Starfinder Society is contacted by scientists from Dreamlink Laboratories who claim to have made an important discovery in the Gelid Edge, Venture-Captain Arvin dispatches a team of agents to investigate. Unfortunately, something has invaded Dreamlink Labs… and time is running short for the lab’s survivors!</p>

                   <p>Greetings, Pathfinders!<br>
                     I’m glad to see you’ve all made it through the depths of the August convention season with most of your limbs intact! We’ve got some brand-new scenarios dropping this month as well as the release of last year’s interactive special!</p>
                   <p>With the Hellknight takeover of Citadel Altaerein and their subsequent oppression of the citizens of Breachill, the Pathfinder Society has partnered up with the Andoran military to help get civilians to safety before the historical Battle of Hellknight Hill! During these various rescues, the Pathfinders learn not only about the Bumblebrasher goblins stuck inside the Citadel, but also of a secret tunnel connecting the town to the old ruin. Once inside, the Pathfinders can learn about some upcoming, dastardly Chelaxian plans…</p>

                   <p>Meanwhile, shifting forward a few weeks from 7-01—Tensions are high following the Battle of Hellknight Hill, and while Cheliax hasn't taken any direct action, they've encouraged privateers to attack Andoran shipping. One of these pirates is especially overconfident and believes she can win greater favor by conducting a more direct attack on one of the Augustana shipyards. Coincidentally, the Pathfinder Society is in the market for a new ship, and the heads of Supplies and Procurement are touring some that are available when the attack begins. As the escorts to Nairaba and Kitsch, the two aforementioned heads of their divisions, it'll be up to the agents present to keep their charges safe while dealing with the chaos.</p>

                   <p>And to wrap us up, tumbling way back to the beginning of the Year of Immortal Influence, the Pathfinders went on a large expedition to a historical Pathfinder shipwreck in the Eye of Abendego, only to find information about a strange island only known as the Isle of Claws and Terror. However, a nephilim pirate and xir succubus companion are also on their way to the island with much more nefarious goals in mind! Can the Pathfinders beat them there? Will they withstand the might of Abendego’s Squall? And can Calisro Benarry keep the <em>Snapdragon</em> from crashing among the waves?</p>

Brandon held his own in Pathfinder 2E and lasted to <a href="https://www.runehammer.online/post/the-o-a-d-epiphany">share the story</a> of his first Amber Die marathon. Having an artist along for the ride meant that many of the scenes from our playthrough were sketched out as they happened, so we’ve included our favorite piece with this blog!</p>

                   </ul>
                   <p>Our journey began in the undisputed center of dwarven culture: the Sky Citadel of Highhelm. When we sat down at the table, each of us had a folder waiting for us with our character’s name on it. Inside, our GM had placed four high-quality maps printed from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ehs?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Highhelm">Highhelm hardcover</a>; each map depicted one level of the city: King’s Crown, King’s Heart, Stonebreach, and The Depths. For the entirety of our marathon, we never left the city and never wanted to. We toured some sites that even a family of dwarves who grew up in Highhelm hadn’t seen before, and enjoyed the massive sandbox that this adventure offers. Our goal was to build our clan’s reputation higher before an important festival, and we counted at least a dozen quests that we completed in that pursuit.</p>

                   <h2><strong>Highlights from <em>Mantle of Gold</em>:</strong></h2>
                   <p>□ As Highhelm is the most influential of Sky Citadels, it is connected to the rest of Golarion in ways that make languages essential, and tutors are always in demand. Disa Firecask, known to us as “Mama Disa,” volunteered to become a language instructor at a prestigious school in King’s Crown. Teaching the children of Goldhilt clans is taken seriously, and Disa was expected to submit lesson plans, a pacing guide, and closely follow the curriculum. Disa is a cleric of Folgrit, so the children loved her—yet the stern headmaster insisted on evaluating her skills in the classroom. Disa dropped THREE natural 20s across four rolls to become Teacher of the Month!&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>□ We were made aware of a problem at the Cloudspire Embassy, an important location that secures the connection between Avistan and Garund’s dwarves. Upon arriving, we were told that a cloud dragon brought from Garund for protection was not adjusting well to the caverns of its new home. This dragon, Mharsilekinass the Jewel, presented a challenge we were not wholly prepared for: something akin to a bored teenager. After finding pleasure in ambushing us (with initiative rolled), the dragon challenged us to a game of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eh8?Pathfinder-Elemental-Stones">Elemental Stones</a>; if we won, it agreed to behave, but if we lost, we had to amuse the dragon for a week. We stopped our session, broke out the board game, and our GM proceeded to defeat us. Renck Firecask, our bard, stepped up to entertain. A week later, Renck and “Mharzy” had something to show us: a neck tattoo worthy of a wyrm!</p>
                   <p>□ The sport of basilisk is appreciated in Highhelm in a way that the Philadelphia Eagles fans around our table can identify with. When a star player for the Highhelm Hodags had to drop from the team’s roster, our chances of winning the Avistan Championship were in jeopardy. Tryouts were held, with siblings Thorgreigir and Salthrun Firecask in attendance. While Thorgreigir clutched his rolls and made the team, he now had to perform in front of the whole city. We were down by a score for most of the contest, but with our GM blasting the dwarven version of “Seven Nation Army” and crowd noise in our favor, the championship came down to the last play. Thorgreigir executed a move the team had worked on, and went deep for an over-the-shoulder basket catch. One Hero Point later, we stormed the field as only champions could.</p>
                   <p>□ You think you might know what <em>Sky King’s Tomb</em> Adventure Path is like? Volume one delivered the off-guard condition to our GM, and that’s hard to do. In total, we played a bit over half of <em>Mantle of Gold, </em>which utilized FOUR different subsystems from the <em>GM Core</em>: Reputation, Influence, Victory Points, and Infiltration. One subsystem would have been interesting, two would have had us talking. With four, author John Compton delivered something that changed the flow of our gameplay in a way we’ve never experienced and are still processing—and we loved it.</p>
                   <p>□ There was a truly embarrassing scene that begs description. The forges of the dwarven city were in dire need of assistance due to a recent labor strain. We showed up in the hopes of earning reputation, but knew we were in trouble when the ifrit dwarf in charge of “Burntown” asked to see our hands. She wanted smiths and was sent a family of brewers. We failed check after check, with Torag himself turning his head away from us. Drothgyr Firecask played music for inspiration, but it only resulted in more beer breaks. The crossbow we repaired, well, it fired two feet down and to the left. The shield we crafted, we felt bad even calling it done. As for the fence we tried to build, we told ourselves it probably wasn’t for actual use, right?</p>

                   <h2>The Scions</h2>
                   <p>Every family, every clan, every gaming group that has lasted decades will have its own practices and traditions passed down to its scions. Order of the Amber Die is here all these years later because of what our members have passed down to each other since our inception. The first member to show up with a legal notepad and special pen was Andy; he referred to his session notes as a “log,” and while as kids we had no idea what it was for, it changed our sessions forever. The log was overly detailed, with exact damage numbers for every attack and spell. Still, we found ourselves referring back to it between sessions to keep track of locations, items, or NPCs we had met—the log helped us succeed. In future campaigns, someone would step up to keep notes based on the tradition of Andy’s logs. The log changed forms to suit the player keeping it; some preferred a scrapbook with pictures and quotes from our sessions. While this might seem commonplace today, we didn’t know any other groups in our junior high school that were keeping notes like we were back in 1990. At least a half-dozen members have kept the log since, but the record for the most detail sits with a scion who holds the torch that Andy once lit. Karee Vogrin’s notes for this marathon sit at 9,101 words, are nearly twenty-five pages, and will be posted to our Google Classroom where all players have access to them.</p>
                   <h2><strong>Character Deaths:</strong></h2>
                   <p>□ None, Folgrit watched over us.</p>
                   <h2><strong>Best Quote from Marathon 1:</strong></h2>
                   <p>(a marketing discussion stalls out around the table, ending in a squabble)</p>
                   <p>Renck Firecask: “I can see where the acumen comes from in this family.”</p>
                   <p>Zuls Firecask: “It skips a generation.”</p>
                   <h2><strong>Current Situation:</strong></h2>
                   <p>As the festival approaches, we succeeded in growing the reputation of Clan Firecask, and then some! At the basilisk championship we released our clan’s newest beer, Battle Axe, and became next year’s sponsor. We earned the key to our very own tavern, even if it was overgrown with fungi. We formed new friendships, one with a dwarf named Elbert Glassgrinder who cheered us on and often bought us breakfast. One morning, Elbert told us his name is actually Krohan, and confessed that he had both stolen AND lost the clan dagger of none other than King Taargick, the Sky King. We spit out our beer—<em>come again</em>? Lightly trusting Krohan for now, we are off to recover what he thinks is the lost clan dagger…&nbsp;</p>

The Sagamore ballroom was packed to the gills 18 hours a day with Pathfinder and Starfinder Society games, Pathfinder Quest and Infinity Deck demos, and the Battle of Hellknight Hill! We ran over 1100 games for nearly 6000 players during the weekend, and it was wonderful to get to game with all of you again.</p>
                   <p>If you’d like to join us in 2026, look for a call for volunteers here on the blog in January of next year. Only 352 days until Gen Con!</p>

                   <h1>Starfinder Society News</h1>
                   <p>The Gen Con launch of Starfinder Society (second edition) was a stellar success! We ran nearly 600 tables of Starfinder Society (second edition), and everybody had a blast (off—okay we’re done doing puns now).</p>
                   <p>Prior to the convention, we launched our <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety">updated landing page</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>, <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=Guide-to-Organized-Play:-Starfinder-Society---Second-Edition">Guide to Organized Play</a> and a new <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo71wi9">Player’s Guide for the Invasion’s Edge storyline</a>. We know there are still some hiccups and bumps to be smoothed out on some of these pages, but we’re working hard to get everything corrected. If you see any issues with broken links or outdated language, please let us know and we’ll get things fixed up!</p>
                   <p>One thing I realized we didn’t communicate very effectively ahead of time was our sanctioning process for Starfinder (second edition) adventures other than scenarios. We do not intend to issue chronicle sheets for these adventures, outside of special exceptions like Free RPG Day adventures and other single-session adventures. Players are still free to use the character options in these adventures, provided they own a physical or PDF copy of the product, but there won’t be Organized Play credit for playing or GMing these non-Society adventures.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1>Pathfinder Society News</h1>
                   <p>We’ve got some new character options for Pathfinder Society this month! Our newest release, <em>Pathfinder Battlecry!</em>, is now sanctioned for use. All Pathfinder Society players who own a copy may play as a jotunborn, a commander and/or a guardian, and many other options are available through boons in the boon store. You can find full details on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a> as usual.</p>
                   <p>We’ve also released some brand new boons for expanded wizard schools! Add more spells to your wizard’s curriculum from non-core books with the boons, available for just 10 Achievement Points each.</p>
                   <p>As a reminder, you have three weeks before the September 5th deadline to register your first Starfinder Society (second edition) game and unlock a skittermander character in Pathfinder Society! To help our our play-by-post community, this applies specifically to games <strong>begun</strong> on or before September 5th.</p>

                   <h1>GM Recognition</h1>
                   <h2>Campaign Service Coins</h2>
                   <p>At Gen Con, several new Campaign Coins have been awarded! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their name and reasons.</p>
                   <p>Congratulations to:</p>
                   <p><strong>Greg Garcia</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #912</p>
                   <p><strong>John Kaufeld</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #923</p>
                   <p>and <strong>Kurt Wasiluk</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #924</p>
                   <h2>GM Ranks</h2>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had three GMs reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Randy Cronin, Daniel Hutchinson, James Reeves</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1>Conventions</h1>

                   <p>Commanding this motley crew is me, <b>Jason Keeley</b>, Senior Designer and the design lead on <em>Battlecry!</em> It all began with an idea for a book about the mortal wars occurring in the wake of Gorum’s death and the eventual clash between Andoran and Cheliax that is the Hellfire Crisis. While this is a book that focuses heavily on fighting and has a lot of options for martial characters, I wanted to make sure most other character types could join the battle. I wrote the guardian class and the story of Arianna Dreth’s encounters with Ulka Oathshriek and Grimmyr (with prodigious help from our more journalistic-minded editors). (Fun fact: The name Arianna Dreth came from an anagram of “Dan Rather” with some extra letters thrown in.) I’ve already been hearing a lot of positive buzz about the book—thank you so much! You can find me on Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/herzwesten.bsky.social">@herzwesten.bsky.social</a> if you want to chat about games, books, and dogs!</p>
                   <p>Now it’s time for our battle-tested authors to sound off!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h3>
                   <p>I was excited to contribute the field propagandist archetype to <em>Battlecry!</em> Archetypes like the dandy have always been my favorites, so it was a delight to put my spin on a similar type of design (hat tip to the dandy's designer, Jessica Redekop!). I hope you enjoy playing with it at the table.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Tineke Bolleman (she/her)</h3>
                   <p>Hi, I’m Tineke (she/her), and I’m from the Netherlands. I have been active in the Paizo Organized Play sphere for years, and many of you may know me from the Pathfinder and Starfinder scenarios I have written. For <em>Battlecry!</em>, I brought many of the marvelous troops in this book to life for you. It was amazing to work with others to bring you challenging and diverse enemies to face on the battlefield. I hope you enjoy them!</p>&lt; 
                   <br>
                   <h3>Jessica Catalan (she/her)</h3>
                   <p>Hi, I'm Jessica Catalan (she/her), Senior Developer on the Starfinder team here at Paizo, head of the Starfinder Society, and frequent freelancer for the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs. For <em>Battlecry!</em>, I worked on character options for existing Pathfinder classes, which is a space I always enjoy exploring. I hope you enjoy taking to the battlefield as a summoner with a swarm eidolon, a thaumaturge with a shield implement, or testing out some new feats astride your beloved mount as a champion or cavalier.</p>
                   <p>Take care out there, folks!</p>

                   <p>Hello! I’m Jeremy Corff (he/him). You may remember me from <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-11: Gifts Ungiven</em>, or the <em>Kingmaker Anniversary Edition Companion Guide</em>, <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em>, as well as other work. I was thrilled to have the chance to contribute to <em>Battlecry!</em> My sections included the siege weapons, as well as held magic items and some work on the war mage archetype. Did you know a shocking array of musical instruments played a key part in armed forces before the advent of radio and more advanced communication technology? I did my best to provide a broad selection!</p>
                   <p>You can see more of my work in the upcoming Revenge of the Runelords Adventure Path, as well as yet-to-be-announced projects.</p>

                   <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Hi! I’m John! Besides <em>Battlecry!</em> I contributed to the <em>Lost Omens Tian Xia Character</em> and <em>World Guides</em>, as well as over a dozen other projects for Paizo, Legendary Games, Evil Robot Games, and Evil Genius Games, including <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Collision’s Wake</em>, a special kicking off the release of Starfinder Second Edition at Gen Con this summer. For <em>Battlecry!</em> I wrote the war backgrounds, magic armor, and battle vehicle sections. As a veteran and former sailor, I am particularly excited by several of the entries I contributed. I loved trying to capture the attitude of grizzled soldiers with the veteran background, while the martial musician was inspired by my time in marching bands and drum &amp; bugle corps. Working endless hours in the frigid conditions of Antarctica inspired the creation of the <em>frost furs</em> magic armor, while the <em>eagle wing</em> armor was something I wished I had while flying in helos over Greenland translocating musk oxen. I probably was most excited to bring the ice breaker into Pathfinder after working on three ice breakers all over the globe! Look for me at Gen Con, or reach me at <a href="

                   <p>Hello! I'm Dennis Muldoon (he/him). I've been a Paizo contributor since 2019, and in that time, I've contributed to numerous projects across nearly every line Paizo publishes. For this book, I wrote the munitions master class archetype, as well as some magic ammunition and siege ammunition. I'm really excited for folks to get their hands on this book and to see what sort of epic adventures result! You can find more of my recent work in the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em> (the kalo ancestry), <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #7-13 Ratrod's Revenge</em>, and <em>Starfinder Mechaggedon!</em></p>

                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Приветствую, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m a Russian-speaking Ukrainian-American historian, educator, and author.</p>
                   <p>Now, I’ve been writing for Paizo for a while, so you might say I have a bit of a reputation—the sort that leads our esteemed Jason Keeley to write me out of the blue and ask if I wanted to write ten thousand words on military gaming. I said yes. Actually, I think said something more like “YES!!!” Exclamation marks were involved.</p>
                   <p>In my professional life, I teach a lot of military history—mostly post-industrial stuff (ask me about trench warfare!), but I can expound on most anything at least a bit. This was the perfect assignment in which to inflict military doctrine upon an unsuspecting public, only with added reincarnating harpies and depressed lich-queens. I hope you find it fun, I hope you find it interesting, and hey, maybe even a tiny bit educational.</p>
                   <p>By the by, if you want to see <em>more</em> of my writing, you should head on over to the <a href="https://luminant-age.itch.io">Luminant Age Campaign Setting"</a>, where I am Creative Director. It’s cool, we’ve got teleporting mice.</p>

                   <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling</h3>
                   <p>Hello, all! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, frequent contributor to Paizo. For <em>Battlecry!</em> I did the guerrilla and Iridian choirmaster archetypes; I had fun trying to map particular fighting styles and techniques to game mechanics and updating the Iridian lore a bit for Pathfinder Second Edition. I hope people who liked sniping duo will also like that one! I also got to do the whetstones, little magic items designed to give martials something magical to do with their weapons in a fight. My favorite is the <em>key of unwinding</em>, which lets its user rewrite time itself to avoid enemy attacks. <em>Battlecry!</em> has a lot of other cool stuff in it, also, and I'll be excited to see how folks use it in games.</p>

I’m the Digital Products Lead here at Paizo and a frequent contributor to neat books like <em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em>, <em> Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em> Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em>, <em> Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>, <em> Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>, and numerous others! For <em>Battlecry!</em>, I wrote up a bunch of exciting new battlefield-ready magical weapons as well as a whole slew of new troops to throw at your PCs, and I would like to thank Jason Keeley not only for hiring me for this project, but for not immediately deleting my turnover and never hiring me again when I pitched him a weapon called the chain of command.

I’m now a full-time freelance author writing TTRPG content, primarily for Pathfinder Second Edition and Starfinder. For <em>Battlecry!</em>, I wrote the follower rules, including the captain archetype, as well as some of the new troops. Both sections were good fun, but I especially enjoyed the process of distilling down the feel of iconic character tropes into mechanics that fit into Pathfinder’s companion framework. My most recently released work includes Pathfinder Second Edition conversion of Palaeogames’s <em>Dr Dhrolin’s Dictionary of Dinosaurs</em> and the living spell, bogey, and kraken ancestries for Roll for Combat’s <em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Titans</em>. I stream twice a week on YouTube as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@arcanemark2562">Arcane Mark</a>, together with my game designer husband Mark Seifter. You can also find me on the <a href="tiny.cc/arcanemark">Arcane Mark discord</a>.</p>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">"What did I tell you about these cheap knockoff sonic plugs?” Quig takes the charred scrap in his paw, turning it in front of Iseph so they can see. “They tear like paper under a little arcanospheric turbulence!”</p>
                   <p>Iseph’s expression is always rigid, courtesy of its metallic composition, but now it’s utterly blank, like they didn’t even hear.</p>
                   <p>Quig tries again. “What? That rough landing get to you? You? Hunter of adamantine? Just breathe—wait, no—circulate your arc coolant and loosen up those radial connector bolts.”</p>
                   <p>“You’re rambling,” Iseph observes, “so you’re fine.”</p>
                   <p>Their metallic voice almost sounds annoyed with Quig. Weird. They must really be shaken up, Quig figures. Iseph trudges past the landing pod, shrugging off the orbital dive gear to make their customary initial survey for hostiles.</p>
                   <p>The mysterious Gate of Altyris consumes the horizon with its diameter, framing Quig’s android companion and the rest of the empty landscape. They don’t really know why it exists or where it leads, only that the whole system is counting on them to activate it before the incursion.</p>
                   <p>“Still no idea what this old tech is made of,” Quig says as he scampers after Iseph, his rig clanking away. “But whoever built that big ring sure did carve out all the good alloys from the planet, didn’t they? This ground’s got more holes in it than I’ve drilled into the ship over the years, and that’s saying something.”</p>
                   <p>“Probably unstable,” Iseph mutters. “Watch your step. Not flying down for you again.”</p>
                   <p>“Please. Who do you think you’re talking to, buddy? This magnetic hover field is so good it’ll send <em>you</em> flying if you get too close!”</p>
                   <p>Quig flips a switch on his boots. His jump jets make a soft humming sound, buffeting him a few scant inches off the ground.</p>
                   <p>“Well—maybe not <em>flying,</em>” Quig admits. “But you’ll feel it—oooohhhhh! Look at <em>this!</em>”</p>
                   <p>He skates over the broken earth and stops his momentum only by grabbing hold of a fantastic console webbed with circuitry and control runes, only some of which he recognizes. Sure, there are also beautifully crafted ancient statues standing around it, but those are just decoration. Not his thing.</p>
                   <p>&nbsp;Iseph asks, “Is that the on button?”</p>
                   <p>“Well, it’s made of the same alloy. Scan can’t identify it.” Quig has already made the attempt and stashed his hand-scanner back in his rig. As fast as he can run his mouth, his brain always runs faster. “Similar design. Lemme just pry this panel off—oh, good! That didn’t break anything! Yup, I can see the connector here. Then down that channel, and—yup. Binocs confirm it, straight to the ring. Kinda reminds me of your sub-neural network. You ever mess with the settings on that?”</p>
                   <p>When Quig looks up, he’s surrounded by spare parts and loose hardware strewn across the ancient alien platform where the console sits. Iseph eyes him the way Quig might eye a passing astral leviathan—with increasing concern the longer it lingers.</p>
                   <p>“Well, have you?”</p>
                   <p>Iseph blinks. “Have—what? No? Why—”</p>
                   <p>“Ohhh. That might explain why your joints erode so fast, ‘Seph. I’m not kidding about loosening up those radial connector bolts.”</p>
                   <p>Iseph shook their head. “Makes my combat form imprecise.”</p>
                   <p>“Yeah, yeah, obviously not for combat! But you can swap between modes, you know! Had to learn that myself.” Quig returns to the console, crawling inside to clear out the grime and replace the rusted parts. “When I said goodbye to Scout—boy, I hope he’s okay—I’m sure he is, he’s a clever bot ever since I figured out how to get him sentient—he’ll do great out there, he will, but I think about him sometimes, you know—hand me that spark rotator, will you? No, the spark—oh right. You wouldn’t know what that is—I invented it. That spiky one with the whoosh doohickey over there—no, the—yeah, that one—so, as I was saying, when I designed Munchkin, I realized she’s gotta be adaptable, modular, ready to switch things up at—”</p>
                   <p>An alarm beeps in his helmet. Munchkin springs from Quig’s rig. The turret unfolds behind him and deploys a quickly-heating barrel in seamless parallel.</p>
                   <p>“—a moment’s notice!”</p>
                   <p>Quig rolls into Munchkin’s shadow before an arc ray can blast his tail off. The next shot traces him but strikes Munchkin’s armor plating instead.</p>
                   <p>“See? Zero-latency combat mode initiation!”</p>
                   <p>Only then does Quig poke his nose out from behind Munchkin.</p>
                   <p>The statues surrounding the console step off their platforms, shedding dust from their joints. Under the grime, Quig now sees they’re made of the same alloy as the console.</p>
                   <p>Iseph unloads their guns on one of those mechanical guardians, precise as always, though its chassis absorbs most of the damage impressively.</p>
                   <p>Quig licks his tall front teeth. “Oh, I want some of that scrap when we’re done here!”</p>
                   <p>&nbsp;Iseph shouts, “Can you activate the gate or not?!”</p>
                   <p>Quig tries to finish his repairs, but in his haste, his paw slips, slamming his rotator into a panel. A puff of sparks and ozone-flavored smoke blooms into his helmet.</p>
                   <p>“Oops.”</p>
                   <p>Iseph rounds on him, so Quig clarifies quickly.</p>
                   <p>“Uh, the control panel is in better shape than I expected, but the power core is fuzzed!”</p>
                   <p>Iseph’s opticals snap to the gate the size of a space station. “We have to power <em>that?!</em>”</p>
                   <p>“Oh, not the gate! <em>That’s</em> fine! It’s just the controls—Oi! Could you big hunks of scrap <em>sit still</em> for a sec? I’m working here!”</p>
                   <p>Quig draws his arc pistol to fire at a guardian with a glowing arc blade marching too close for comfort. Nigh simultaneously, Munchkin returns fire at a guardian with a zero cannon, firing frosty energy rounds without prompting.</p>
                   <p>The guardian with the blade shakes off Quig’s shots and advances. That’s when it trips Munchkin’s motion sensor. She swivels a secondary reaction cannon, stopping it in its tracks with an opportunistic blast.</p>
                   <p>“Ha! See? I <em>told you</em> to sit still!” Quig fires again, but this time, he observes how the armoring alloy reacts. His brain races through possible methods to pierce it even as he generates ideas for powering the console. “Maybe with repairs, the landing pod engine could power the console—what do you think, ‘Seph—”</p>
                   <p>The blade guardian closes the distance and swings down at Quig’s head. He blocks with his arc pistol, but the guardian is over twice his weight. Quig topples onto his back. The blade burns, searing his eyeshield hotter and hotter the closer it bears down.</p>
                   <p>One of Munchkin’s frost rounds strikes the cannon guardian in a leg joint, and it wobbles and trips into the chasm. Quig’s round ears perk up at the receding sound of the alloy hitting stone—down—down—down…</p>
                   <p>“Nice lucky shot, Munchkin,” Quig grunts, “but I think you’ve got a better tool for the rest of this job!”</p>
                   <p>Munchkin activates her array shift in response to the neural command from Quig’s exocortex. The blazing barrel recedes, replaced by a barrel with self-protective vibrational dampeners. When her next round strikes the blade guardian, the tip of the ammunition shell clicks and a thunderclap detonates.</p>
                   <p>Sonic ripples vibrate through the guardian’s chassis and crack it at the weakest joints. Then Quig hears a hundred tiny internal mechanisms shattering under sonic shock.</p>
                   <p>It wheels back from Quig and slumps over the console, powering down.</p>
                   <p>Quig springs back up to his hindpaws. “Sonic damage! Great! I can <em>always</em> be <em>louder!</em>” He reaches into his rig for an electromag grenade. “Let’s just make a few adjustments here…! How you doing over there, ‘Seph?”</p>
                   <p>The only response Quig gets is a flurry of gunshots.</p>
                   <p>“You know, you’re not a great conversation partner, ‘Seph.” Quig sticks a thin tool into the grenade’s casing. “I feel like we never talk. I mean, I’d usually chat like this with Navasi or Dae, but this arcanosphere’s sent the comms to the cats—that’s why I didn’t tell you I had it all under control, see, when the pod went down—could’ve saved you a trip—”</p>
                   <p>“We!” Iseph takes another shot. “Are in combat!”</p>
                   <p>“Yeah! What about it?”</p>
                   <p>Iseph doesn’t answer and instead swings around to fend off a guardian approaching from behind.</p>
                   <p>“Must have lost their train of thought,” Quig mutters. “Happens to me all the time! Anyway, I’m glad you <em>did</em>come, ‘Seph, in these circumstances.”</p>
                   <p>Iseph’s gunshot shatters one of the statues’ headplates. They lift their head, heartened...</p>
                   <p>Quig pulls the pin on the grenade. “Who would I talk to if you weren’t here? Sure, there’s always you, Munchkin, I like talking to you, but it’s nice when someone quips back. You know?”</p>
                   <p>Iseph’s face snaps back into a grimace.</p>
                   <p>“Yeah! See? Munchkin says she wants to get to know you better too, ‘Seph. You can talk to us anytime.”</p>
                   <p>“Chuck it!” Iseph shouts at him.</p>
                   <p>“Cheese Louise! You could just say <em>no—</em>oh. Chuck the <em>grenade</em>.” He tosses it over his shoulder just as it starts beeping rapidly. “I was getting there! We were in the middle of—”</p>
                   <p>The words “a heartfelt conversation” vanish beneath an explosion of sound.</p>
                   <p>An earsplitting cacophony buries the following sentence as the vibration of the sonic grenade shudders through the unstable terrain. Cracks lace the ground, each setting off a chain reaction in the rock. Everything apart from the ten-foot-square around the console crumbles, slabs of earth careening into the abyss like dominoes.</p>
                   <p>The guardians still standing plummet into the maw of the planet. Iseph leaps to the console just in time to avoid the same fate, and Quig hits Munchkin’s emergency recall switch, prompting her to fold back into his rig.</p>
                   <p>For the first time since they arrived, they stand in utter silence.</p>
                   <p>That lasts until Quig opens his mouth again.</p>
                   <p>“Phew! That was close!” Quig pats Iseph on the shoulder, now that they’re within reach. “That turned into a bit of a clusterfuzz, didn’t it?”</p>
                   <p>Iseph gives him a withering look and wipes dirt from their opticals.</p>
                   <p>Quig himself frowns, turning toward the open console. “Now, how am I gonna run big enough power cables across that chasm from the pod…?”</p>
                   <p>His eyes rise to the guardian slumped over the console.</p>
                   <p>“Hold on. <em>You</em> must have an independent power source…”</p>
                   <p>Quig yanks the console’s power cables out of its case and pries open the glowing casing over the guardian’s power core. With a few adjustments and an adapter, he plugs it straight into the body.</p>
                   <p>The console lights up, and Quig begins the activation sequence for the gate.</p>
                   <p>“Just like that! Easy cheesy!” Quig smiles at Iseph.</p>
                   <p>Iseph, however, stares at the corpse of the constructed guardian that their companion has fashioned into a battery. “That’s horrifying.”</p>
                   <p>Quig glances between them.</p>
                   <p>“Oh! Sorry! I guess it is, kinda! I didn’t…” Quig points a thumb at the body. “You want me to disconnect and…?”</p>
                   <p>“No. It’s practical,” Iseph says. “So are most of your suggestions. Practical <em>and</em> disturbing.”</p>
                   <p>“Oh.” Quig nods. “Just let me know if I ever, you know, bother you.”</p>
                   <p>Iseph shakes their head. “You just talk too much.”</p>
                   <p>“Probably.” Quig can’t argue with that.</p>
                   <p>Iseph’s internal servos spin.</p>
                   <p>Quig asks, “Seriously, if you’re not comfortable, you can just tell me to shut up—”</p>
                   <p>“I,” Iseph interrupts him. Quig lets them talk. “I… would like your help… with my radial connector bolts. The zero-latency mode shift is impressive. I’d like that edge. But I don’t know how to…”</p>
                   <p>Quig’s whiskered face stretches into a toothy grin. “I’ll show you! Every sentient should get to know their own hardware! Even us meaty ones! I tell you, even my <em>knees</em> have been telling me a lot lately. <em>Everything’s</em> got something to say! If you know how to talk to it, the whole universe opens up to you!”</p>
                   <p>The gate blooms to life on the horizon beyond.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Our volunteer venture officers (VOs for short) serve a variety of functions for the program. Most are involved with organizing games at their local stores and supporting their communities. While this call is geared towards in-person play, we also follow the same structure for our online region and have venture officers focused on virtual tabletop or asynchronous play as well.</p>
                   <p><strong>Venture Agents (VAs)</strong> are the store-level coordinators and often oversee scheduling games at one or two stores. They work with the store owner and employees to share information and speak with their communities to find out what adventures they’d like to play.</p>
                   <p><strong>Venture Lieutenants</strong><strong>(VLs)</strong> supervise Venture Agents, often overseeing a city or town. They also typically take up lead positions for local conventions, helping to schedule games and organize GMs for these events.</p>
                   <p><strong>Venture Captains (VCs)</strong> and <strong>Regional Venture Coordinators</strong> (RVCs) are our top-level organizers. They supervise large cities, states, or multi-state or country regions and help to advise the OP staff on how things are going in their assigned areas.</p>
                   <p>We also have a rich community of online play, both in the independent online region as well as online offerings from many of our primarily in-person lodges. Whether you’re running online or in-person, there’s a role for you in our organization.</p>
                   <p>Venture officers can also join task forces focused on specific objectives, such as the Onboarding Task Force, which creates new player resources, or the Guide Team, which maintains the Guide to Organized Play. Joining one of these groups isn’t required but is another way to support our program if you have the skills and interest.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Benefits of Volunteering</h2>
                   <br>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3306c751-7384-4160-b7af-02de095d8504/Naiaj_1000x1500.png"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3306c751-7384-4160-b7af-02de095d8504/Naiaj_1000x1500.png" width="400px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A pale half elf with a short, silver hair wearing a black and purple space suite, stands with her hands on her hips while looking sternly at the viewer."></a>

                   <br>
                   <p>On top of being part of our incredible community, venture officers receive perks depending on their rank.</p>
                   <p>All venture officers, regardless of rank, receive <strong>free PDFs</strong> of every Pathfinder and Starfinder Society scenario we’ve ever published. No matter what your community wants to play, you’ll have access to that adventure! Venture Captains and Regional Venture Coordinators also receive PDFs of all Paizo products as a thanks for their hard work and time spent with the program.</p>
                   <p>Venture officers also qualify for the <strong>convention reimbursement program</strong>, where they can receive a limited number of Paizo vouchers for organizing conventions in their areas. These events often take more time and effort than simple in-store play, and so we want to be sure volunteers are properly rewarded.</p>
                   <p>At certain major conventions, such as PaizoCon and Gen Con, venture officers also qualify for <strong>increased rewards</strong>based on their rank. Typically, this takes the form of additional vouchers or earlier qualification for rewards like GM badges, but this varies by show.</p>
                   <p>All venture officers are invited to our special <strong>Discord server</strong>! This is used to disseminate information to all volunteers, as well as provide them access to certain resources like images for signs and advance knowledge of scenarios for planning purposes.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>How to Become a Venture Officer</h2>
                   <p>If you’re interested in volunteering your services, reach out to us! You can find your local Regional Venture Coordinator’s email <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/regions">on this page</a>; contact them with your information and where you’re located, and they can connect you with any local networks in the area.</p>
                   <p>You can also start organizing on your own at your local game store! Work with them to find a time that works, post signups, and recruit new players! Anybody can be a store coordinator as long as you’re following the <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/">Guide to Organized Play</a> and reporting your games back to us.</p>
                   <p>Finally, if you don’t have any game stores or volunteers near you, reach out to me! Email me at organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com, and I’ll get you in touch with whoever’s closest to start building out your local network.</p>

                   <p>His comm chirped.</p>
                   <p>"Manticore One, I want her alive and talking." His handler's garbled, grating voice didn't soothe his throbbing head. "You copy?"</p>

                   <p>He scanned the darkened, twisting pipes around him, sensors rendering their outlines clear as day cycle into his HUD. The refinery's heat exchange was a labyrinth: low ceilings, exposed ducts, lots of places an intruder could hide.</p>

                   <p>Shadows slipped from every corner of the room, power armored, elite mercenaries slinking in his direction—all Sopeth grafted for maximum lethality. They silently formed a line behind him, the nearest member placing a hand on his back to signal readiness.</p>
                   <p>Joganer raised his weapon. "Move in on three... two... one..."</p>
                   <p>The team burst into the clearing to find a damaya lashunta crouched over an open panel, the luminous blue tips of her antennae waving gently. She didn't look like much of a threat, but she fit the description they'd been given: short, a fetish for green with a fashion sense like a huffed-out raver. The target wore armor, though nothing anyone might take seriously. The stuffed green plush makiri in her hand matched the accents of the pistol at her hip.</p>
                   <p>"Woooooow..." She looked them up and down. "It's like <em>Operation Ultra Force</em> over here!"</p>
                   <p>Joganer knew the infosphere show well. He hated it.</p>
                   <p>He engaged his helmet intercom. "Raia Danviri, interlace your fingers behind your head and—"</p>
                   <p>"No." She fastened her makiri's hands behind her neck like a kid about to take her favorite stuffie to school and whispered something to it. Then she met Joganer's gaze. "Why don't you tell me who sent you?"</p>
                   <p>"You're not in a position to make demands."</p>
                   <p>She shrugged. "Just trying to do what's best for all of us."</p>
                   <p>With a flick of her fingers, a spell gem appeared in her hand. A word from her lips, and thick grease bubbled up beneath the fireteam's boots. Manticore Three and Four slipped to the ground instantly. Joganer stumbled out of the puddle as Raia snapped the spent crystal into her pistol, grinning wide.</p>
                   <p>"Alaka-blam, boys!"</p>
                   <p>The shockwave of pure force sent Joganer's prone colleagues skidding away on snail trails. Laughing, Raia threw a flare into the grease, turning the path between them into a bonfire. The rest of Manticore Team scrambled backward, terrified to be caught in the flames.</p>
                   <p>Joganer took a shot at Raia as she fled into the shadows, but his stunner rounds only dented the nearby pipes. Fire suppressors popped out of every surface, spraying everyone down with fluorescent blue retardant. The powder clung to Raia's grease, leaving Manticore Team caked up and pissed off.</p>
                   <p>"Get up! She's getting away! Let's go, let's go!" Joganer pulled his struggling team to their feet and wiped his visor. "Two, Three, take left. Four and Five, take right. I'm headed up the center. Do not shoot me."</p>
                   <p>"If you let her get away," came the handler's voice in Joganer's ear, "the consequences will be swift."</p>
                   <p>He sneered as he pressed into the darkness. "She won't. We've got the whole place locked down."</p>
                   <p>Manticore Team moved into the jungle of pipes, rifles at the ready. Their friendly transponders pinged in the distance, flanking alongside Joganer. They were ready this time; she didn't stand a chance.</p>
                   <p><em>You could just tell me who sent you</em><em>.</em> Raia's voice spilled into his mind like a whisper. <em>No need to get hurt</em>.</p>
                   <p>Joganer shook off her distraction. It was nothing more than an old lashunta trick: get him to give away his position without revealing her own.</p>
                   <p>Two pops rang out in the darkness followed by screams from his left flank. Joganer barged through the tangled walkways to find a pair of comrades writhing on the ground, powered joints seizing and visors strobing. Their armor had stopped the shots, but it hadn't mattered. Joganer knelt and tried to free them from their helmets, but the security systems on their gear were totally fried—some kind of virus.</p>
                   <p>Two more shots echoed from the stoneward side of the complex. Four and Five screamed before their comms succumbed to static.</p>
                   <p>"Manticore, sound off!" Joganer stayed frosty, moving away from his fallen friends. "Who's still up?"</p>
                   <p><em>Just us now</em>, came Raia's cheery mental voice. <em>Why not shout out the name of whoever sent you, and I can be their problem instead?</em></p>
                   <p>A signal pinged his acoustic scanner, and Joganer swept his muzzle toward it. Then came another ping and another, resolving into the pattern of a cartoonish, smiling face. She must've hacked his HUD somehow, turning it into a liability.</p>
                   <p>Snarling, Joganer shut down his suit. His limbs dragged like high-grav, but his employer's grafts were more than strong enough to finish the mission. That little pistol of hers couldn't do anything against his composite plating, so the advantage was still his.</p>
                   <p>It'd been so long since he'd hunted another person without the cheats of trackers and scanners, trusting only the purity of his augmented senses. Without stealth compensators, his footfalls hit harder, his gear rustled. Joganer's heart thundered, electrified to finally have a chance to test his newest implants.</p>
                   <p>He laid eyes on Raia, crouched near a junction and mostly obscured by a breaker assembly. She didn't spot him, and he only needed to get closer for a clear shot at the dead center of her back. Joganer advanced, restraining a smile.</p>
                   <p><em>Last chance</em>, she spoke into his mind. <em>Disarm and hand over your boss.</em></p>
                   <p>Cocky little thing. Finally in range, he imitated her spoiled tone with a sneer. "No."</p>
                   <p>Raia turned, bemused, and gave him a finger wave—</p>
                   <p>—then disappeared <em>into</em> the console with a digital whoosh.</p>
                   <p>"Damn it!" He dashed to her position, frantic, and stopped dead when he heard a second whoosh in his wake.</p>
                   <p>Raia's pistol hammer clicked into place behind him as a barrel thunked against the back of his head.</p>
                   <p>"Want the inside of your helmet cleaned out?" He could hear the smile in her voice against the rising whine of her gun.</p>
                   <p>Fine. Let her shoot. It wouldn't penetrate. She couldn't hack his gear without power, and Joganer could probably take her in hand-to-hand.</p>
                   <p>He was about to spin and put her down, but the charging whine grew ever louder. Orange sunlight washed the immediate area, and the back of his neck seared beneath the shielded plates of his armor. Something inside his helmet stank of baking composite.</p>
                   <p>What in the name of the gods was she pointing at him?</p>
                   <p>"Overclocked. Enough to turn your face into nothing more than a bad memory and a worse smell," she said. "Now tell me who sent you before I have to ask your next of kin."</p>
                   <p>"Sorry, Manticore Team," came the voice of the handler. "Can't have that."</p>
                   <p>"What?" Joganer grit his teeth.</p>
                   <p>"You're terminated, immediately. No payout. Thank you for your service."</p>
                   <p>If they weren't going to pay, then he might as well give them up.</p>
                   <p>"Well?" Raia asked.</p>
                   <p>Joganer tried to answer, but his breath wouldn't come. It was like his diaphragm had simply stopped, and the air was stuck inside his lungs. He could only form the S sound, opening and closing his mouth. Terror seized his chest as all of his grafts slackened simultaneously—arms, eyes, lungs.</p>
                   <p>Raia bonked the back of Joganer's helmet with the pistol as he swooned from the lack of air. "Hey. Say something."</p>
                   <p>He slowly turned to her, blurry red shapes forming at the edge of his vision. Judging from the way she recoiled, he didn't look good.</p>
                   <p>"Ss... ss..." He dropped his rifle and groped at his throat before reaching for her.</p>
                   <p>Raia grabbed him and shook him. "Hey! What? No dying!"</p>
                   <p>Joganer's armor grew heavier. Dizziness overtook him. Parched lips and failing tongue curled into formation as he concentrated with all his might. He sank to his knees, desperate to utter one sound before the jaws of death closed about his mind.</p>
                   <p>Raia eased him to the ground, rolling him onto his back. "Look, if you want revenge, you're gonna have to spit it out!"</p>
                   <p>His eyes failed him, and a rattle pushed one final word from his mouth:</p>
                   <p>"Sssopethh..."</p>
                   <p>He listened intently for her response. It was the last thing he could do. In the intimate moment of his passing, Joganer found himself wishing Raia would say something, offer any kindness or justice to rest his soul.</p>
                   <p>Her response was short. "Sorry, I… I didn’t understand that."</p>
                   <p>Joganer gave up.</p>
                   <br>

                   <h2>The <em>Invasion’s Edge Player’s Guide</em>!!!</h2>
                   <p>Dive right into Starfinder Society by downloading the <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Files/SFS+Invasions+Edge+Players+Guide.pdf">Invasion’s Edge Player’s Guide</a>! This free PDF is a quick-start guide to Starfinder Society Organized Play, containing all the information you need to get into the program, create characters, and dive right into a game! So whether you’re an experienced fan or a newcomer to Starfinder, download your copy now!</p>
                   <p>In addition to information on the Starfinder Society Organized Play Program and some handy links for both GMs and players, the <em>Invasion’s Edge Player’s Guide</em> contains in-setting details on the Starfinder Society, including its leadership, training, base of operations at the Lorespire Complex, and current events. Chief among these events is news of a massive starship called the <em>Wreck of the Returned</em> that crashed onto the planet Akiton—the focus of our Invasion’s Edge metaplot scenarios—but that’s not all that the Starfinder Society is digging into this year. (There’s a whole galaxy of adventure out there, after all!)</p>

                   <p>The <em>Invasion’s Edge Player’s Guide</em> also contains brand-new player options!</p>
                   <p>There’s over 20 new backgrounds packed in these digital pages, such as Dataphile, Exo-Guardian, Forum Aspirant, and Lorespire Archivist. Starfinders looking to help explore the <em>Wreck of the Returned</em> will find the campaign backgrounds particularly useful, such as Akitonian Explorer, First Ones Scholar, and Robot Adversary. Fans who participated in the Starfinder Second Edition Playtest can additionally take backgrounds tied to their adventures, such as Alien Hunter, Party Crasher, War-Hardened Hero, and Wheel Winner!</p>
                   <p>There’s also two new ancestries you won’t find anywhere else: lizard-like ikeshtis and giant, four-armed shobhads! Both are native to the planet Akiton and make a great addition to the Starfinder Society for Invasion’s Edge.</p>

                   <p>Hi all, Sen H.H.S. here, and thank&nbsp;you all for your support of <em>Lost Omens: Shining Kingdoms</em>! For those of you who don't know me, I'm a Taiwanese TTRPG freelancer (she/her) who has written for Paizo numerous times, from all the way back in pre-remaster <em>Bestiary 3</em> to more recent works like <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> and <em>Character Guide</em>, and a couple of Adventure Paths. For <em>Lost Omen: Shining Kingdoms</em>, I had the privilege&nbsp;of writing the section of Taldor. Alas, one does not simply venture into Taldor without wading into the history of the entire southern coast of Avistan, so the work was more challenging than imagined. I hope you enjoy what we managed to compile of existing lore, as well as any new or revised content-- be it items, archetypes, or lore. If you want to stay updated on where you can find my writing next (or currently), you can follow me on Bluesky at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/senhhs.bsky.social">senhhs.bsky.social</a>, or keep an eye on my website at&nbsp;<a title="This external link opens in a new window" href="https://senhhs.carrd.co/" target="_blank">https://senhhs.carrd.co</a>. I definitely suggest you keep an eye out during the Gen Con season bec-- *NDArted*</p>

                   <h3>Laura Lynn Horst (she/her)</h3>
                   <p>As a lover of high fantasy since watching my dad perform as Mordred in <em>Camelot</em> when I was 5 years old, I was thrilled to contribute to the lore of the <em>Shining Kingdoms</em>. This is my third publication for Paizo (that I can talk about) and I'm absolutely thrilled with the positive feedback the book has received. I was especially excited to see that my contribution of Ulon being at the heart of a new pantheon (The Tides of Chaos) got turned into a meme! You can't keep a mysterious Azlanti god down. I also contributed to the section on Beliefs of the Shining Kingdoms as well as the 2E revamps to the Goldpebble (who I hope my GM&nbsp;never puts in front of me as I'm absolutely terrified of snakes) and Vovorak&nbsp;in the bestiary. Happy reading all! You can find me on instagram and bluesky:&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nyxfromstyx77.bsky.social">@lauralynnhorst</a> (Insta)&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nyxfromstyx77.bsky.social">@nyxfromstyx77.bsky.social</a> (Bluesky)</p>

                   <h3>Derry Luttrell (he/they and this/that)</h3>
                   <p>Hey all! I'm Derry Luttrell. I'm the host of Dice Will Roll, the Queerest Pathfinder Podcast on the Planet, and a writer, illustrator and founder of Team+, the 3pp PF2 publishing group behind bestsellers like <em>Witches+</em>, <em>Archetypes+</em>, and <em>Tian Xia+</em>. <em>Shining Kingdoms</em> was my first writing credit, and I could not be more grateful for it! I was behind the Shining Kingdoms Today section, the Factions of the Shining Kingdoms, and the Beirean Frosthunt monster. Being able to write about the factions in the Shining Kingdoms was huge for me; first and foremost, I had crazy fun coming up with the dragon-slaying dwarven mech-pilots and salesmen in the Steelwrought Striders, and fleshing out groups like the Lion Blades with Sen and Eagle Knights alongside Matt was fantastic. I was able to help bring firearms into Andoran, which I'm so excited about! But the thing I'm most pleased with is the Wylderhearts; I pitched and developed the original idea, which Michelle baked into an incredible archetype later on. The Wylderhearts are a love letter to my own culture, taking heavy inspiration from the Fianna, the faoladh (an Irish analogue to benevolent werewolves) and Cú Chulainn. TTRPG settings often take Irish ideas and tropes without really paying attention to their origin, so being able to make something authentically Irish was really important to me— and the end result really was special. I hope you enjoy playing wylderhearts as much as I enjoyed making them!</p>
                   <h3>Matt Morris</h3>
                   <p>I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies. I'm currently awaiting the launch of my first Kickstarter, a TTRPG called&nbsp;<a title="This external link opens in a new window" href="https://www.remnantyears.com/" target="_blank"><em>Remnant Years: Tales of a Ruined Land</em></a>. I was lucky enough to traipse through Andoran for this book, and it was exciting to see what's brewing now in the Birthplace of Freedom. (Turns out: Lots of plot hooks, some Eagle Knights, and a bucketful of internal conflict.) Andoran is a great place for adventure when you want to explore what it means to be good, how to hold to principles in difficult circumstances, and what happens in the generations after revolutionaries become the establishment. I hope you&nbsp;enjoy creating stories there! I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my <a href="https://paizo.com/people/MattMorris6uwio">Paizo profile</a>, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to&nbsp;<a title="This external link opens in a new window" href="https://mattmorris.carrd.co/" target="_blank">contact me</a>&nbsp;if you are looking for a reliable writer!

                   <p itemprop="description">“OK, self,” Dae said to their reflection without realizing they were speaking out loud. “You’re about to knock the socks off this planet! You’re one lucky cat, you know, but you’ve also got nerve and plenty of raw talent—the makings of a real star! Now let’s get out there and make Miiyu look even more amazing than she already is!”</p>
                   <p>The pahtra performer closed their eyes for just a moment and took a deep breath, attuning to the vast power of the stars that filled them with inner light. After a long and deliberate exhale, they checked their outfit one last time. Would adding more glitter to their fur would be overdoing it? No, there’s no such thing as too much glitter. They did one more spray, spinning around in the cloud as it covered their guard hairs in iridescent splendor. Beyond the walls, they could hear the crowd chanting for Miiyu in unison with steadily increasing excitement. It didn’t matter that the chant wasn’t for Dae; the energy alone was enough to make them feel as though they could fly. They absently adjusted the woven bracelet on their left arm, smiling widely as they slinked to the curtain, opening it ever so slightly to steal a peek at the audience—</p>
                   <p>—and drew in a sharp breath.</p>
                   <p>There, standing in the front row, was a lizard-like humanoid that was clearly trying to blend in and failing spectacularly. It wasn’t that vesk were unknown or completely unwelcome on this planet; it was her body language that caught Dae’s attention. While she tried to appear as excited as two ysoki hanging off the railing to her right, the expression never quite reached her eyes, which were darting around as she took stock of her surroundings. That’s when Dae noticed the outline of a weapon under her jacket, and a shoulder bag brimming with something that could have been eggs but were more likely to be some sort of explosive devices. A flash of light reflected off what Dae had initially clocked as a piece of jewelry. It was a three-pronged imperial sigil, sharp as the claw of their cruel war god.</p>
                   <p>“A Veskarium trooper in the front row? Oh, come on!” Dae muttered.</p>
                   <p>Another vesk joined the first. He was doing a better job of blending in, but not by much. He’d had the sense to hide his sigil, but he’d shown up with his admittedly stunning black jacquard silk pants tucked into military issue boots, and he was wearing battlegloves with clawed metal joints. The fur on Dae’s neck stood up as they scanned the crowd and spotted another probable vesk trooper entering the theater on the right-hand side of the stage, blending in considerably less than the two directly front and center. This one hadn’t even bothered changing out of their uniform.</p>
                   <p><em>They look out of place and they look armed,</em> Dae thought. <em>They must be after Miiyu! </em>Everybody knew about Miiyu’s rebel activities during the Veskarium occupation of Pulonis. If imperial troopers were here, they probably weren’t fans. There were no security guards in sight, and Dae wouldn’t risk raising an alarm this close to curtain with everyone packed in here.</p>
                   <p>Dae needed a plan that would protect both the star and the audience while avoiding panic. An idea flared up immediately. With absolute confidence, they stepped out from behind the curtain and sashayed toward the crowd. The cheers that burst forth simmered to a buzz as it became clear that Dae wasn’t Miiyu.</p>
                   <p>“Hey, posers!” Dae shouted, directly addressing the two vesk sitting front and center, who looked around at the others in their row as if they hadn’t been directly pointed at. One of the ysoki pointed at himself in utter confusion before pointing at the vesk to his left, who shot him a withering glance before scowling up at Dae. “First of all, there’s no replica weapons allowed at this venue, and second of all, they don’t even match your outfits,” Dae accused. “Not to mention Imperial vesk attire is terminally out of style.”</p>
                   <p>“We’re just here for the show,” the latecomer replied. She wasn’t convincing at all.</p>
                   <p>“Speaking of shows, this one’s about to start!” Dae was pleased when the spotlight landed on them. They began tapping their foot in a steady rhythm as a ribbon of pulsing midnight unspooled from their finger—the manifestation of their solar weapon in graviton mode. Dae flicked the ribbon with a sound like spring thunder and snatched the female vesk’s shoulder bag, pulling it up on stage and spilling its contents. A jumble of wired pipes gleamed under the stage lights. As always, Dae’s instincts were on point.</p>
                   <p>The vesk imposters immediately gave up on their ruse. The man cracked his knuckles and scrambled onto the stage, hefting his bulk in slow motion with a bestial grunt. The woman pulled a baton from under her jacket and squeezed. The baton elongated into a triple-bladed polearm—a doshko with a collapsible design created for smuggling into secure venues like this, used for assassinations ordered by Veskarium military leaders with grudges. Miiyu was in danger.</p>
                   <p>Sparks reflected in Dae’s goggles as they attuned with the blazing creative energy at the heart of every star, turning the dark ribbon into a whip of fire. Dae leapt high into the air with deceptive ease, swirling their ribbon behind them in blazing circles. They landed on the opposite side of the doshko-wielding vesk, smiling as they spun around and lashed the ribbon out like a solar flare. The crowd screamed and cheered as the vesk was engulfed in flames. She staggered stage left and fell to her knees, where black-clad crew tackled her with fire blankets.</p>
                   <p>The male vesk dashed forward, punching wildly with clawed fists as his wicked tailblade sliced the air. Dae gracefully dodged the swings. Every slash, duck, and weave became part of an elaborate dance made up on the spot.</p>
                   <p>Then Dae missed a step. Pain hit Dae like a truck as one of the vesk’s underhanded punches slammed into their face. A second later the vesk shoved Dae hard with both hands. The crowd booed and Dae stumbled back awkwardly, pinwheeling their arms. A tongue of flame shot out as Dae’s nimbus reacted to the assault, but they were already off-balance, their dance streak was ended, and the crowd was beginning to rumble with panic.</p>
                   <p><em>Meyel, help me pretend that didn’t happen</em>, Dae prayed. A comforting warmth spread through them. Dae cartwheeled and called their solar flare, which appeared like an extra spotlight hovering overhead and blasted the vesk who’d shoved them with a ray of sunlight. He tried to flee then, but Dae streaked forward, leaving a contrail of hypnotic light in their path and twirling the burning ribbon like a lasso.</p>
                   <p>By now Dae was getting bored with this interruption and was ready to take on the last target. Though it wasn’t necessary, they couldn’t help but add a few flourishes to their movements—a quick flick of the left wrist in this direction, a more dramatic swoop of the right arm that way. Their left leg swept forward, leading the rest of their body in a graceful slide. Small motes of light first emerged from their core and then glittered down around their body before beginning to gather around their elegantly outstretched hands, quickly compounding into a glimmering, dynamic brightness that drew cheers from the audience. Seconds later, a blast of solar energy erupted from their outstretched hands, firing a searing beam of light into the group of soldiers. Two of the three enemies cried out in shock and pain as the light burned through their defenses. At the same time, Dae felt the deep shifting of the stars within them as photon became graviton, and fire extinguished into pulsing dark.</p>
                   <p>Dae landed with grace, seamlessly going down on one knee in a dramatic bow. Becoming the opening act was completely unintentional. They felt electrified, like they could dance for the next week straight.</p>
                   <p>On cue, the theater went dark. Dae exited the stage and found their position for the main show. The Veskarium saboteurs had been dealt with without any innocent bystanders getting hurt, and the audience was clearly entertained. The night was off to a fantastic start and was sure to only get better.</p>
                   <p>“Nice work,” Miiyu purred as she breezed past Dae. Dae felt as if they smiled any larger, their face would break open.</p>
                   <p>In front of them, the curtain rose as neon pink and teal lights danced over Miiyu. The diva strutted on stage in a shimmering holofiber gown custom made for this song only. The crowd erupted in deafening, delirious cheers. It was going to be a phenomenal show.</p>

                   <p>What, you may ask, is our first major storyline for the Starfinder Society? Eyes to the skies, Starfinders! <strong>Invasion’s Edge&nbsp;</strong>is here!</p>
                   <p>Emerging suddenly from deep space, a vessel traveling at speeds that should have cracked a planet in half slowed long enough to crash into the Sloughscar Hills of Akiton. Curious explorers and opportunistic salvagers descended upon the wreck, among which was a mercenary team in the employ of the Starfinder Society. Within hours, the starship’s automated defenses activated, driving out the explorers and unleashing dangerous monsters and magical effects into the region, including the dreaded illumantula, a terrifying monster of magic, technology, and light. This starship was soon dubbed the <em>Wreck of the Returned</em>.</p>
                   <p>Believing the <em>Wreck of the Returned</em> has a connection to the mysterious First Ones and is but the first step in a devastating invasion of the Pact Worlds, First Seeker Sarmak works to establish a Starfinder lodge in the surrounding Sloughscar Hills. Now, Sarmak has put out a call for brave Starfinders willing to help establish and defend this fledgling lodge and explore the <em>Wreck of the Returned</em>.</p>

                   <p>Hellooooo, Pathfinders!</p>
                   <p>Things are heating up this month, and not just because we’re reaching the high point of summer. We’re also rapidly approaching the final scenario of the Year of Immortal Influence!</p>
                   <p>The Pathfinders found out more about the strange past of Hesla Embersplitter and put a stop to the horrific monster she created out of Deskari’s corpse, ensuring that the people of the small town of Pimatsih in Sarkoris were safe. Her plans to destroy <em>Riftcarver</em> were uncovered during a raid on her home, prompting the Society to relocate the corpse of Deskari’s fallen father, Ingalor, to the Grand Lodge under Zarta Dralneen’s safekeeping. Now it’s finally time to destroy the corpse once and for all, and Zarta’s calling not only on the Knights of Lastwall for assistance, but also every Pathfinder agent within Absalom!</p>

                   <p>In this adventure you play as four Protoframes sent to rescue a spy from a Corpus facility on Orias. <em>Operation: Orias</em> is a taste of the <em>Warframe</em>setting using the Starfinder Second Edition rules, designed to play with friends around the tabletop! Gen Con attendees can stop by our demo area to play a snippet encounter of this full adventure.</p>
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>I’ve been playing <em>Warframe</em> off and on for many years now (11 years, according to the fun sigil I have in game), and I’ve always had a great time with it. There’s not anything quite like jumping around at intense speeds, slamming down with Rhino’s stomp, and completely obliterating a dozen enemies in the span of two seconds. It’s those moments that keep me coming back again and again.</p>
                    <p>I don’t know what possessed me to contact Rebb Ford on that random Monday evening, but I suddenly felt a compulsion to reach out. I’m a Creative Director. She’s a Creative Director. Maybe, just maybe, we could link up and make something cool happen! I was floored with how excited she was by me contacting her. A small meeting occurred shortly thereafter, and I could feel that we were all giddy and excited to come together to make something happen. The only question was what we would be able to make.</p>
                    <p>We wanted something out as quick as we could, but our publishing schedules weren’t built with an unexpected collaboration in mind. Something could happen, but it would have to be slim and precise. We landed on a brief little taste for the universe of <em>Warframe</em>, a mashup between Starfinder and <em>Warframe</em>.</p>
                    <p>I was fortunate enough to be asked to write a little adventure for this collaboration, and I got to work with the inimitable Kengineer to make something cool happen. Bringing <em>Warframe</em> to the tabletop was a fun challenge and I’d like to think that I was able to translate the feel of being on an in-game mission pretty well. Overall, this has been a super exciting and rewarding experience. Working with DE has been nothing but a dream so far, and I hope that everyone enjoys what we’ve put together. Until next time, Tenno!</p>

                   <blockquote>
                    <p>Hiya, it’s Jenny, Creative Manager of Starfinder. I’m not the one who came up with this awesome idea or clenched the deal with Rebb, but Starfinder is my department so I had to get involved at some point. Thurston and Luis arranged the collaboration then suddenly told me they needed me to develop a super-secret crossover project. Of course I was like, “OMG YES! I’m in!” See, Thursty and I have played <em>Warframe</em>together quite a few times in the past. If you’re curious about my history with <em>Warframe</em>, I’m a filthy casual with about 300 hours played with friends on and off over a few years. I play Fashionframe, so I choose Warframes based on aesthetic and vibes just as much as playstyle. My favorites are Garuda, Jade, and Yareli. Anyway! I never imagined I’d get to work with Digital Extremes to create an official crossover for their game. It makes perfect sense though—Starfinder Second Edition and <em>Warframe</em> really mesh! I can’t wait for you to play what Luis cooked up for you and experience <em>Warframe</em> in tabletop form, combined with Starfinder Second Edition rules.</p>

                   <blockquote>
                    <p>Thurston Hillman, Paizo Associate Publisher here! In <em>Warframe</em>, I’m a longtime Caliban main. (This is an inside joke; I actually was a Valkyr main for years but started saying this as soon as Caliban released.)</p>
                    <p>So, there I was, at Gen Con chatting with Luis when he mentioned this fun idea of reaching out to Rebb Ford at Digital Extremes about doing something with Starfinder and <em>Warframe</em>. I said “Absolutely, you should go and do that!” Cut to a few months later, when I’m sitting in a call with Rebb and others from Digital Extremes, and excitedly chatting about potential opportunities together. Hearing that several creative leads at Digital Extremes were in the same Rise of the Runelords campaign brought it full circle, as many of us at Paizo are avid fans of <em>Warframe</em>.</p>
                    <p>From that initial meeting onwards, this collaboration has been a joy to work on, with both sides sharing our excitement of our respective properties. We’ve worked together to make this product that we can’t wait to share with both our communities.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">The fifth time he saw the same grey-furred ysoki hawking her basket of cosmic cratannes (laser-fried dough, hot off the therm, dipped in some kind of sugared orange), Zemir had to admit he was hopelessly lost.

Maybe he’d buy some to bring back upside. Once he figured out where he was in the station. In this version of it, anyway.</p>
                   <p>Most realities had their own Absalom Station, and there had to be one he could draw on for help, ideally where the resident Zemir had some sense of where he was going. Maybe one where the Spike led back up to the Freemarkets, connected by a daisy chain of hatches, vents, and ladders. Or one where part of the Spike was the hub of the station, with signs and vendors everywhere, and if you paid attention you could find a quick way through. He could almost see himself there – confident stride, cloak trailing behind him, trading nods with passersby who respected his age-whitened hair. All he had to do was glance a bit past the here and now, pull from something beyond the world he currently stood in, and—</p>
                   <p><em>stomach lurching, nerves on fire</em></p>
                   <p>A station just like this one, the hallways bitter cold,</p>
                   <p>filled only with the echoed sound of dying</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">A station where the ground beneath his feet</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">was devoured by the emptiness of space.</p>
                   <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: right;">A station where a little girl reached for a snack</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">before something splintered and ripped her apart,</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">turning everything to debris.</p>
                   <p>Zemir blinked the other realities away—once, twice, three times—and did his best to ignore a tiny bit of moisture threatening the corner of his eye. He couldn’t help that girl, he knew he couldn’t, no matter how much he wanted to. He’d learned that lesson years ago, the night he lost his team—his <em>friends—</em>to some trap of reality he would never reach again. Maybe not so different than whatever stalked him now.</p>
                   <p>A feeling of something wrong had been hanging in the air for weeks, sloshing deep inside his guts, making his skin feel too tight<em>—</em> It was what had brought him down here, walking through the maze that was underneath the station, hoping he would figure out where it came from and why. But that flash of realities? That spinning, dizzy whirl of worlds? That was something stronger than the creeping sense of ill at ease. <em>That</em> sent a wave of sick and spin crashing into his body that only his long years of discipline in times of chaos kept him from spilling back out in bits of bile onto the metal ground.</p>
                   <p>Zemir tapped at his chest, felt for his anchor. A small piece of obsidian, singed but unbroken. All that remained from a former life. <em>Touch something real, </em>he thought as it danced beneath his fingers. <em>Shake off the fear and steel yourself. You know that you can do it.</em></p>
                   <p>It was time to go home.</p>
                   <p>Zemir bore right at the next set of hallways, ignoring the ones that slipped out of his vision, filled with the voices from some other dimension, thick and indistinct and always a touch out of tune. Left, then right, then right again, feet firmly beneath him, until the last hallway ended in an unexpected alcove, sparse but still in use, with a cot on the floor and a chair at the wall and clothes hanging from a spigot. The light was dimmer here, somehow, and the air hung stale and heavy, as if it had been folded up and shoved into a corner, waiting for someone to stumble into its maw.</p>
                   <p><em>skin crawling, hard to breathe</em></p>
                   <p>The air thick with a poisonous haze</p>
                   <p>curled around a family’s remains</p>
                   <p>their hands reaching for relief</p>
                   <p>that isn’t going to come</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">The air bitter cold, stealing the breath</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">from huddled bodies grasping tight</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">Leaving nothing but frozen arms</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">And frost-drenched tear-stained faces</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">The air, smells of burning</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">and then, something else.</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">Something delicious.</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">Something warm and hearty and fried.</p>
                   <p>“You really should have tried the cratanne.”</p>
                   <p>The ysoki was there again, behind him. She smiled wide as she offered the basket of fried dough. “They’re best when they’re fresh, you know. Everyone says so. Might have kept you out of some trouble.” Her voice sounded odd. Minor key, a touch out of tune.</p>
                   <p>Zemir grabbed for power before thinking to do it, a gesture as natural as taking a breath, bringing his quantum field to life with the ease of years of practice. Other Zemirs were with him now, flickering in and out of the alcove, in and out of this reality. Some close enough in look to be his twins, at least at a cursory flash of a glance; others, dressed up like they owned the place, and still others looking bruised and beaten by a life of struggle he’d never known. But they were all there, facing down the ysoki chef who still stood in the doorway her teeth bared half between snarl and smile.</p>
                   <p>“Who are you?” Zemir let the voices of all the other Zemirs echo like thunder. No two of them sounded quite the same. Some voices spoke sharp with harsh demands, some were soft and curious, but all were a little out of tune and hollow as struck bells. Just the way the ysoki’s voice sounded. He cleared his throat and began again. “Who are you and what are you doing here?”</p>
                   <p>“The real question is, who are you?” asked the ysoki. “A guard patrolling? A rival shopkeeper snooping?” She backed away as she spoke, trying to get past the reach of his spells.</p>
                   <p>He did not understand, but Zemir knew that he had to take some expanded precautions. Zemir let his quantum field slowly expand as he spoke, putting the ysoki back in its reach. If she noticed, she didn’t let on.</p>
                   <p>“You’ve been <em>following </em>me,” the ysoki said. “Every time I pick some new alcove down here, try to sell my goods in peace, there you are. I’m just trying to find a place to sell my cratannes. I don’t have anywhere else to go. Please just leave me alone!”</p>
                   <p>The more the chef spoke, the more Zemir was sure. She <em>was</em> from Absalom Station, not from this reality. He’d heard of witchwarpers who fully displaced their bodies, or who anchored themselves in someone else’s reality, but usually there was deep magic involved, and it was always dangerous. Sometimes it wasn’t voluntary.</p>
                   <p>Zemir kept his voice calm to mask himself reaching out for more power, casting <em>detect magic </em>to see what it told him. He followed the potentials in his mind—<em>haste</em> and <em>fly</em> would get him out of here if she was dangerous, or <em>lightning bolt</em> if all else failed. But all he detected was a pulse of something warm inside the basket filled with food that she still held. There was more in those cosmic cratannes than fat and fry and flavor.</p>
                   <p>“I wasn’t following you,” he said, though it didn’t seem to matter now. “I just kept running into you. It felt like something drew me toward you. Perhaps those snacks you’re so insistent I enjoy.” Zemir could feel his voice grow tense. He clenched fingers to unleash a bolt in case she moved against him, but something flashed across her face and before he could decide to cast, he saw her in some other place. Some same but different version of this station.</p>
                   <p><em>swallowed laughter, sudden pain</em></p>
                   <p>She is in a kitchen laughing</p>
                   <p>Smells of food and talk of flavors</p>
                   <p>Promises and joking threats</p>
                   <p>Recipes passed down</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">She is in a closet hiding</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">Lights are flashing, klaxons blaring</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">Smoke chokes out the sound of screaming</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">Hands that held her, forced to stillness</p>
                   <p style="text-align: center;">She is all alone</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">She is trapped but won’t go easy</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">Reaching out for some new power</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">Pulled to somewhere safe but different</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">Recipe scrap in her pocket</p>
                   <p style="text-align: right;">Nothing left of home</p>
                   <p>Zemir inhaled sharply as the images—her memories—left his mind, a truth within them that erased whatever he was planning. The quantum field faded. The other Zemirs disappeared. He wondered if one of them was from wherever she came from, and if that version still survived.</p>
                   <p>“Why show me this?” he asked. “Why draw me to your food stand?” Perhaps this was the only way she knew to ask for help.</p>
                   <p>“I didn’t,” said the chef, in a small voice, clear but shaky. “I only tried to put some of the place I’m from into my food. The orange sugar is confectionary from my home. It’s just a bit of magic to connect you to the ones who you break and share your bread with. I can’t go home now so… it’s the next best thing.”</p>
                   <p>“And the visions? The smoke?” He had a feeling she had caused them. She must have some kind of hidden talent. Some reason she’d survived.</p>
                   <p>“I didn’t mean to. I just wanted to show you what happened. That’s it’s all gone.” It wasn’t an apology. It wasn’t a challenge. It was the plain and simple truth of things.</p>
                   <p>Zemir thought back to the feeling of loss, the spinning lack of center, the sickness roiling around in his stomach for weeks. Whatever she had done had hit him harder than intended, but something told him he’d have to search somewhere else to find any way to help her. Or himself.</p>
                   <p>There were questions to be answered, but not in the here and now. He forced his face into a smile, tried to inhale the scent of the treats that she was carrying. They did still smell like his kind of delicious.</p>
                   <p>“I understand,” he said. “About those cratannes… I can introduce you to some people who will buy the whole lot off you right now if you come to breakfast. How do you feel about coffee?”</p>

                   <p>If you’ve boosted your own Lost Omens Lore proficiency over the years, you might already be familiar with Iblydos. If not, don’t worry! Let me share some trivia to catch you up and get excited.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Classical Inspiration, not Replication</h2>
                   <p>I mentioned before that classical Greek myth and history inspired Iblydos, so are we getting stats for Zeus? Not quite like that. When pitching and developing Iblydos, I considered what concepts and themes make ancient Greece exciting before considering how those ideas might manifest on Golarion—especially in a way that integrates with surrounding lands Vudra, southern Casmaron’s coast, and the Obari Crossing sailing route.</p>
                   <br>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>So what might you find?</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>City-States:</strong> Much as Athens, Sparta, and others tried, nobody united classical Greece for long. For much of its history, myriad city-states jostled for influence and even hegemony. Likewise, nine major city-states have ruled Iblydos for centuries, with at least one having collapsed dramatically in the Age of Lost Omens. Some city-states feel strongly Greek-inspired, and that means plenty of other city-states break the mold in exciting ways.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hubris, Hospitality, and Metamorphosis:</strong> Flip open <em>Bulfinch’s Mythology</em> to a few random myths, and you’ll inevitably find some combination of a mortal being braggadocious, a god in disguise being inadvertently snubbed, and that god then transforming the mortal into something ironic. Arachne’s a classic example, and Baucis and Philemon are iconic counterexamples. Iblydos has no shortage of transformation and cautionary tales, even shaping some of the recommended ancestries for this campaign—including awakened animals, beastkin, and more! You’ll also find these themes echoing throughout Myth-Speaker’s narratives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mythological Creatures:</strong> Some of the oldest Pathfinder lore credits Iblydos as the birthplace of myriad creatures like harpies and minotaurs. If there’s a prominent Greek myth about it, the creature’s likely making at least one appearance. In fact, cyclopes play a major role in most cities, having joined forces with humanity ages ago.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glory:</strong> That many fearsome creatures require equally courageous heroes! Homeric heroes chased after <em>kleos</em>, the kind of glory that comes from doing amazing things and ideally being immortalized in stories. Even if the average Iblydan doesn’t intend to wrestle a hydra, they still strive toward excellence in their chosen craft, profession, or other pursuit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demigods:</strong> Classical myth boasted more than a handful of immutable deities. The Olympians, titans, and sundry other gods often philandered with mortals, resulting in a host of demigods. Over time, Greek myths and religion evolved and became regionally personalized, such as Artemis of Delphi diverging from Artemis of Ephesus (causing fandom battles worthy of the modern internet). What really sang to me were these demigods and regional mystery cults, each a unique yet doomed to fade from memory eventually. How might Iblydos achieve that same flavor?</li>
                   </ul>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Myth-Speaking</h2>
                   <p>And that’s where myth-speaking arose. Iblydos doesn’t have local, full-power deities like Desna, Shizuru, or Kazutal. Instead, most Iblydans revere hero-gods—local demigods who were born mortal but obtained mythic power. When a mortal shows exceptional promise, a city’s cyclopes invite them to join a divinatory ritual called myth-speaking. With their magical foresight, the giants prophesy what great deed the mortal might achieve. If the mortal follows through and succeeds, they attain mythic power like the rules you’ll find in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq06sfx?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals"><em>War of Immortals</em></a>. Those same hero-gods grant spells for a lifetime or three before passing away, making room for new hero-gods.</p>
                   <p>At least, that’s how it’s worked for millennia. The Age of Lost Omens undermines cyclopean prophecies, and myth-speaking has become less reliable each year. At this point, Iblydos would experience a record scratch double-take worthy of an Adventure Path if approximately four player characters were to attain mythic power all at once.&nbsp;</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2><a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurepath/mythspeaker">The Myth-Speaker Adventure Path</a></h2>
                   <p>Oh hey, did you hear the Myth-Speaker Adventure Path is a mythic campaign for 1st-level PCs?</p>
                   <p>Yep, even though your characters won’t start the game with mythic power, they’ll attain it during the first volume! From there, they’ll navigate the political excitement that comes from new hero-gods on the scene, wrestle with the mythic power coursing through their bodies (because their bodies weren’t made for so much energy), and unravel the strange circumstances that led to them being the latest additions to Iblydos’s dwindling pantheon. Expect monster-slaying, mythic problem-solving, and voyages throughout the islands (and into realms where no simple ship would sail).</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">The village was scared, that much Grimmyr could sense. While by now he was used to many of the peoples of Golarion being intimidated by his towering form, this fear had nothing to do with him. It had clearly seeped into the community long before he arrived. The faces of the townsfolk were pale and tired. Their movements were slow and languid, as if a heavy weight pressed down upon them. It even seemed to affect the atmosphere—dark clouds gathered overhead, and the flowers ringing the small stone plinth at the center of the village green were wilted and dying. Grimmyr’s heart ached to see such distress.</p>
                   <p>Grimmyr ducked under a hanging sign painted with a tankard of ale and opened the door to what he hoped was a tavern or inn. While his people had no such formal meeting spaces in the Fray, he had learned that these businesses were good places to gather information. Inside, he drew the stares of several residents and a pair of individuals who were as armed and armored as himself.</p>
                   <p>“A fellow mercenary!” shouted the taller of the two, waving over to Grimmyr. Her skin was tanned from long hours in the sun, her blonde hair was cut roughly, and her friendly grin showed more than one missing tooth. “Come to protect the fine people of Northfork from the monsters?” she asked.</p>
                   <p>“Of course he is, Aliss,” said the other. He was stout and bearded, the long reddish hairs twisted into two neat braids. His eyebrows were less groomed, as if left to cover the missing hair on his head. “Look at the size of ‘im.”</p>
                   <p>“Monsters?” Grimmyr asked, his voice surprisingly soft.</p>
                   <p>“Aye,” said the one named Aliss. “Scaly buggers that crawl up out of the well just outside of town from time to time. No one knows what’s drivin’ them into a frenzy, but his holiness Mordruk and me are only gettin’ paid to kill them.” She winked at a scowling Mordruk.</p>
                   <p>“Only been here about a week,” said Mordruk. “But it’s been getting worse and—” he was cut off by the ringing of a bell outside and shouts of “They’re here!”</p>
                   <p>With a chuckle, Aliss picked up the longsword leaning against the wall and strode toward the door. “Best hold your breath, new guy,” she said. Mordruk raised the hood of his white cloak and followed without offering an explanation.</p>
                   <p>Outside, panic gripped the town. From behind closed doors, Grimmyr could hear children crying and furniture being moved to form makeshift barricades. Aliss and Mordruk hurried eastward, alongside farmers armed with pitchforks and shovels, toward the sound of guttural snarls. As Grimmyr passed by the plinth, the sight of the dying flora sent a foreboding chill down his spine.</p>
                   <p>Grimmyr smelled the creatures before he saw them. It was a terrible, musty odor of sweat and stale air that crept into the nostrils and down the back of the throat. He gagged briefly but pushed through the nausea. Some of the farmers weren’t so fortunate, as they stopped to retch. Aliss and Mordruk had already rounded a corner ahead of him, and as Grimmyr followed, he was taken aback by the number of creatures emerging from the well past the edge of town. <em>Will there be no end to them?</em> he thought. Mordruk uttered a desperate prayer under his breath, and Grimmyr sensed that he and Aliss had not yet faced a force of such size here.</p>
                   <p>The creatures were reptilian humanoids with mottled gray scaly hides and bony protrusions the length of their spines made more prominent by their hunching posture. Their heads and tails resembled those of cave lizards, and they wore rudimentary hides and wielded simple clubs, if they carried any weapons at all. Each and every one of them exuded that earthy stench. Many wore necklaces of stone chunks on leather cords; Grimmyr found them familiar but couldn’t place why.</p>
                   <p>The next hour was a grueling struggle against the odds. The townsfolk fought the best they could, holding back the monstrous tide, but it was clear they would eventually be overwhelmed. Aliss cleaved through torsos with her blade, smirking all the while until Grimmyr could see her arms growing weary. Mordruk called down divine magic to keep her and the farmers standing, though even Grimmyr knew such power would not last forever. For his part, Grimmyr waded into the throng of creatures, swinging his flail in wide sweeps and relying on his armor to turn aside claw, tooth, and club. The field became littered with piles of corpses of the creatures… and sadly, more than a few villagers.</p>
                   <p>A bellow drew everyone’s attention back to the well, where something struggled to emerge. Though this new creature shared some similarities to the ones they had been fighting, its hide was the red of fresh clay and it towered over the others, only a foot or two shorter than Grimmyr. It dragged a stone maul behind as it stomped toward a villager.</p>
                   <br>

                   <br>
                   <p>“No! Face me!” bellowed Grimmyr, knowing a strike from that hammer could crush a skull. That got the creature’s attention, and it came charging toward him. He blocked the first blow with the haft of his own weapon, but the second hit him square in the chest, almost winding him. With a grunt, Grimmyr swung his flail in an upward motion against the creature’s chin, snapping its neck. The maul fell to the ground, and the grass around the weapon’s head began to turn brown almost instantly.</p>
                   <p>Grimmyr knew what he needed to do next.</p>
                   <p>He sprinted back into town, toward the village green. With a mighty strike from his flail, he shattered the stone plinth. A small explosion of force sent him stumbling backward. He lost his balance and fell, hitting his head against a tree stump and knocking him out.</p>
                   <p>When he awoke, Aliss and Mordruk were standing above him. “What did you do, new guy?” Aliss asked.</p>
                   <p>“The stone. It was calling to them.”</p>
                   <p>“The fight left ‘em as soon as you smashed it,” Mordruk said. “The townsfolk must have dredged it up out of the well. How did you know?”</p>
                   <p>Grimmyr smiled weakly, the aches and pains of the battle catching up to him. “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I’m here to keep you all safe.”</p>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">Iseph pulled their hand away from their side. Their fingers were sticky and purple with their own synthetic blood. The android winced and calculated the odds of completing the contract: <em>67.3%. Suboptimal. </em></p>
                   <p>This bulk freighter was supposed to be derelict, but the corridors were crawling with bone troopers and starving vacc ghouls. A bone trooper, grinning with its whole skull, perched at the controls of a turret and shot Iseph down as they tried to land in the cargo bay. The android’s integrated force field took the brunt of the impact, but a jagged bit of wreckage pierced Iseph’s side. A medpatch relieved the discomfort of severed processors. A few rounds from their semi-auto pistol took care of the bone trooper. <br><br></p>
                   <p>Iseph dashed down gloomy corridors toward the reactor core, a satchel of explosive charges swinging from their shoulder. The priest of Pharasma on Lucent Station who’d hired Iseph was right—this was a rogue Corpse Fleet vessel, locked on a collision course with the tiny asteroid settlement. An invasion? If so, cracking the reactor apart would prevent untold loss of lives.</p>
                   <p>Iseph found the blast door to the reactor sealed. A grinning skull icon sneered from the display. A quantum pick from their infiltrator kit and a good shove persuaded the cranky door to open. A deep hum throbbed out from the murky reactor chamber and a strong whiff of void energies tickled Iseph’s olfactory sensors. This was no derelict freighter.</p>
                   <p>Three grated catwalks, stacked one above the other, surrounded the hemispherical reactor far below. The blast door spat Iseph out onto the middle deck. Radiation flared the operative’s built-in force field. Levels just below redline, but that wasn’t the problem. The starving pack of vacc ghouls on the catwalk above was.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><em>Recalculating. There is now a 53.5% chance of successfully completing the contract. </em>Lucent Station required better odds.</p>
                   <p>An emaciated ghoul dangled from the cables above, waving a cutlass-shaped grindblade. Iseph sighted it through the sniper scope and blew it screaming to the reactor pile below. Another pair dropped in front of them waving grindblades. Iseph batted one slash away, gritting their teeth as dermal plating took the blow. That ghoul staggered out into midair and vanished. The android flipped their rifle around and bashed the second one, then drew their pistol and fired three rounds into its head. A third ghoul clambered like a spider along the underside of the catwalk right into the last sniper round.</p>
                   <p><em>Recalculating…75% chance of success</em>.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>Iseph’s next target was a tangle of vapor-swaddled conduits that rose up from the core, braided through the catwalk levels. A coffin-like emergency shunt sat on the deck nearby. An explosion there would reverberate up and down the conduits, maximizing a chain reaction.</p>
                   <p>Iseph gripped their side as they limped towards the shunt. A hulking creature emerged from the vapor clouds. Tall as a standard human, but twice as broad, it was composed of hunks of oozing flesh. A blue-and-silver armored coat festooned with the rank badges of an admiral barely contained its squirming flesh. The admiral grinned at Iseph with sharp, rotten teeth and swung a massive grindblade to the ready. A pair of rigor mortics, constructs of raw flesh and armor plating with integrated shields, lumbered into flanking positions.</p>
                   <p><em>Recalculating…50% probability of success.</em></p>
                   <p>Predictably, the rigor mortics charged forward shields first to shove Iseph off the catwalk. The admiral advanced behind them, wheezing in sharp, lungless gasps that the android hypothesized were an attempt at laughter.</p>
                   <p>Iseph grabbed one of the shields and yanked it clean from the rigor mortic’s bony grip, then plunged the zero knife into a visual organ. Silvery-black ichor streamed from the wound. Iseph slammed the pistol to its forehead, pulled the trigger, and sent the undead plunging headless into the reactor.</p>
                   <p>Iseph vaulted over the other rigor mortic, slicing a bundle of cables that festooned the deck. The cut cables vented steam and coolant, twisting on the deck like live serpents. The hapless rigor mortic became entangled in the coils. The android emptied the entire magazine of their pistol into its bulbous head, spattering gore across the deck.</p>
                   <p><em>Ammo depleted. Odds at 52%.</em><br><br></p>
                   <p>Snarling at the demise of its rigor mortics, the admiral lunged at Iseph with the heavy grindblade. Iseph hurled the zero knife and the cold blade buried itself deep in the admiral’s neck. Pus boiled from the wound, but the monster just laughed as it continued to advance.</p>
                   <p>Iseph grabbed one of the cut cables and swung out over the abyss. The grindblade whooshed through the empty radioactive gloom where Iseph had been only moments before.<br><br></p>
                   <p><em>45%. <br><br></em></p>
                   <p>Momentarily clear of the catwalk, Iseph unclipped the incendiary grenade at their belt with a free hand and pulled the electronic pin. Then they tossed the grenade at the admiral. The brute vanished in the explosion, leaving behind only jagged pieces of bone and metal. Iseph swung back to the catwalk and landed safely on deck.</p>
                   <p><em>Increasing probability of success: 89%</em>.</p>
                   <p>Iseph approached the emergency shunt, reaching for a charge. They stopped short at the flow viewport. Inside, instead of a reactor feed there was a humanoid face. The humanoid was young, and softly glowing vermilion arcs traced across their features. An android. Distorted black veins of void energy pulsed in parallel swirls alongside their circuitry. The necrotization of tissue indicated a 35% chance the android was a borai or some other type of undead.</p>
                   <p>Iseph stepped back, still clutching the charges. This “shunt” was nothing more than a sarcophagus hooked up directly to the reactor. What kind of being would need to draw that much power?</p>
                   <p>There was a high probability this android was a necrovite waiting to be reborn in undeath. The android’s eyelids flew open and met Iseph’s searching gaze with their own. Their curious expression melted to pure terror. Though the operative couldn’t hear their cries through the thick portal, the meaning was clear: <em>Help me!</em></p>
                   <p>Iseph glanced at the explosives in their hands. They could help free the android one way—or another. Was this a ruse? <em>Processing new directive.</em><em>Odds for success: Unable to calculate.</em> Iseph placed the charges in standby and back in their bag. They toggled the latches on the sarcophagus. Clouds of vapor smelling like decaying plant matter spilled from the hatch.</p>
                   <p>The creature dropped to their knees and gasped. Trailing wires and tubes kept them connected to the machinery in the sarcophagus. “Thank you,” they whispered.</p>
                   <p>Iseph visualized half a dozen martial strikes to neutralize the kneeling android, but remained still, curiously moved by their stark vulnerability. “What were you doing in there?”</p>
                   <p>The other shrugged. “They t-took me.”</p>
                   <p><em>“Who</em> took you?”</p>
                   <p>“Don’t remember. But I didn’t w-want to go.” The other’s voice was shaky, indicating confusion and anxiety. Iseph considered that. They, too, had once woken up not remembering.</p>
                   <p>“I have a directive to destroy this place,” Iseph advised.</p>
                   <p>The necrotized android regarded Iseph warily. They stood as the umbilical tubes detached with wet pops and examined themself as if for the first time, another familiar act. Something stirred in Iseph.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>“Do w-what you must. I won’t stop y-you,” the other said.</p>
                   <p>“You won’t,” Iseph agreed, strangely conflicted about that answer. They set a charge against the power coupling of the sarcophagus and armed it. Shunt or not, the device was still connected directly to the reactor.</p>
                   <p><em>94% chance of success. </em></p>
                   <p>“I’m Avel.” The other’s eyes glimmered with vermilion light.</p>
                   <p>“Iseph. You should come with me.”</p>
                   <p>Avel arched a glowing brow. “Are you sure? I don’t know to what purpose I’ve been set.”</p>
                   <p>Iseph shook their head and set the rest of the charges. “Then find your own purpose. Everyone should have that chance.” Avel looked around at the cavernous ship of the dead, considering. Calculating their own odds, maybe? Iseph checked their remote detonator and set it on standby.</p>
                   <p>“Let’s leave this wretched place, Iseph,” Avel said with a shudder. They found the escape pods three decks above. No bone troopers or rigor mortics impeded them. Perhaps Avel was repelling them with a secret signal. Iseph opened the pod’s hatch and ushered Avel inside. The other android hesitated.</p>
                   <p>“Will they accept me where we’re going?” Avel asked. Iseph shrugged. The Pharasman priest would likely need to be <em>persuaded</em>. Iseph could handle that.</p>
                   <p>A huge shadow crashed into Iseph, knocking them to the deck. The detonator skittered from their hand. The admiral towered over Iseph, its flesh charred and suppurating from the grenade blast. Its jaw hung loose, enhancing its vicious grin. It held the splintered ends of the grindblade against Iseph’s throat. Avel stepped over to the detonator and picked it up. Was this betrayal after all? Iseph began to calculate the probability. Avel smiled and thumbed the button.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>The deck shook and the admiral toppled back. Iseph kipped up to their feet, feeling their medpatch—and the artificial flesh beneath it—tear open in a new arc of fire. Iseph ignored the painful sensory stimulus and shoved Avel into the pod. They crawled in after, sealing the hatch.</p>
                   <p>The admiral’s howling face appeared at the viewport. Iseph slammed the launch trigger and the escape pod blasted into space. In the distance, the freighter’s hull spasmed as explosions in the reactor tore it apart. Lucent Station, still just a speck of spinning rock in the forward viewport, was safe.</p>
                   <p><em>Mission Complete. </em>Or was it? Avel stared at their destination, expression tight.</p>
                   <p>“I don’t know what they did to me, Iseph. I could be a danger to the ones you saved.” Avel said. Iseph shook their head, wondering at this unexpected deviation from their mission. Avel had not been part of their calculations before, but they certainly were now.</p>

                   <h1>Campaign Updates</h1>
                   <h2>Pathfinder Society</h2>
                   <p>As the war against Cheliax kicks up, new Pathfinder agents find themselves called to join! As of May 23, 2025, the following updates have gone into effect:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>The strix ancestry (<em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em> 132) is now available to all Pathfinder Society characters. Players who have previously purchased a strix ancestry boon from the boon store can re-download the file to gain access to a free resurrection for their strix character(s).</li>
                    <li>The boon for the automaton ancestry (<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> 36) has been reduced in cost from 160 Achievement Points to 80 AcP.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Additionally, at or before Gen Con we hope to add new boons to the Achievement Points store which will allow wizards to expand the spells accessible through their schools. Stay tuned for more information as we have it!</p>
                   <h2>Starfinder Society</h2>
                   <p>Starfinder Society (second edition) launches at Gen Con 2025! In the next few weeks, we should get the Guide to Organized Play out to everyone, along with updates to our landing pages and Character Options pages. In the unlikely event that any of this misses that date, however, I wanted to compile everything you’ll need to know to get started.</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>All Starfinder Society (second edition) adventures are repeatable. Players may play them as many times as they like with a different character each time. A character may <strong>never</strong> have more than one Chronicle from the same adventure, as this breaks the timestream and the hounds of Tindalos start showing up.</li>
                    <li>Starfinder characters may begin their adventuring career at 1st, 3rd or 5th level. Regardless of level, a new character begins with 0 XP. Characters may be freely rebuilt until they reach 12 XP and are played at their next session.</li>
                    <li>Players have access to all options in any Starfinder rules source they own, regardless of rarity. Exceptions include any Unique items, and any options specifically restricted on the Starfinder Society Character Options page.</li>
                    <li>The <em>Starfinder Player Core</em> is the only “core source” for the campaign. Players are not required to own the <em>Player Core</em> to use the options contained within it. Players must own other books, such as the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em>, to make use of their options.</li>
                    <li>Starfinder Society character numbers start at -2701.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Please read our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6znhl?Welcome-to-Starfinder-Society">series of launch reveal blogs</a> for more information on what’s to come!</p>
                   <h1>Sanctioning Updates</h1>

                   <h2>Free RPG Day</h2>
                   <p>This year’s Free RPG Day adventures have also been sanctioned for play! Please note that per our agreement with Free RPG Day, these are not permitted for play until <strong>July 22, 2025</strong>; as such, I have disabled reporting for these adventures until that date.</p>

                   <h1>GM Recognition</h1>
                   <h2>Campaign Service Coins</h2>
                   <p>In the past few months, several new Campaign Coins have been awarded! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their name and reasons.</p>
                   <p>Congratulations to:</p>
                   <p><strong>Bret Indrlee</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #873</p>
                   <p>and <strong>Randy Cronin</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #910.</p>
                   <h2>GM Ranks</h2>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had three GMs reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Star (PFS1)</strong>: Redelia</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Nova (SFS1)</strong>: Ed Emmer, Kishmo</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, Gamers! In the April Tech Update blog, I promised to give you a breakdown of how the upcoming loyalty program will work. Today, I’m here to tell you that at its core, Paizo Plus operates similarly to the current program: spend money with Paizo and unlock free products and discounts.</p>
                   <p>Under today’s Paizo Advantage program, if you subscribe to 4 different lines, you unlock either Starfinder Society or Pathfinder Society subscriptions for free; subscribe to all 6, and you get both for free. Subscribing to 4 lines also unlocks a 15% storewide discount on most Paizo products. Paizo Advantage will be replaced by Paizo Plus when the new store launches.</p>
                   <p>The Paizo Advantage program was designed to be laser-focused on subscriptions, and it has served Paizo subscribers well for many years. However, as our product catalog has grown, we’ve realized that we need a more robust system that better rewards all our shoppers for their dedication in various ways. We needed a program that was more flexible and easy to understand, as well as one that we could modify as we learned what consumers valued most. That’s how Paizo Plus was born, and we can’t wait to share it with you when we launch!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>The Basics</h2>
                   <p>When the new store goes live, you’ll need to opt in to the new loyalty program to start earning gold. If you’ve opted in to receive emails from Paizo, you’ll receive an email about the new program when we launch. And you’ll be able to earn gold right from the start:</p>

                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Join Paizo Plus:</strong> You’ll earn 25 gold upon joining!</li>
                    <li><strong>Leave a Review:</strong> 5 gold with an initial limit of 1 per week (260 gold/year if you write a review every week). You can only write reviews of products you have purchased through Paizo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Birthday Reward:</strong> You’ll earn 25 gold on your birthday. Happy Birthday!</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow us on Social Media:</strong> Up to 25 gold if you follow us on all 5 platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gold on Purchases:</strong> You’ll earn 1 gold for every dollar you spend, and the amount of gold you earn increases as you advance in reward level. More on that below.&nbsp;</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Legal details will be available in an updated <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> when the new store launches.&nbsp;</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2><strong>Refer-a-Friend</strong></h2>
                   <br>

                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7ec2f424-b0d9-42c8-9509-dac7f789e4d3/PaizoPlus_Blog_03.png"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7ec2f424-b0d9-42c8-9509-dac7f789e4d3/PaizoPlus_Blog_03.png" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Refer a Friend!

                   <br>
                   <p>Another way to earn gold is by recruiting friends to make purchases from Paizo. Each time someone takes advantage of your referral by spending $20 or more at Paizo, you’ll earn 25 gold.&nbsp;</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2><strong>Spending Gold</strong></h2>
                   <p>So, on Day 1 if you take advantage of all the ways you can earn gold you’re sitting with 65 gold in your account. What can you get with it? To start, we’ll be offering:&nbsp;</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>You’ll see that you can get a Pathfinder Society or Starfinder Society scenario for $10 off, which will make most scenarios you choose free. You can also see that Paizo is tilting the scales in favor of the gold value for Society purchases, because we genuinely believe that this is an essential program for our players and want to encourage more players to participate.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>Our goal with the new Paizo Plus is to maintain the same value as the Paizo Advantage program. Paizo Plus is slightly better than Paizo Advantage, and these starting values allow us to monitor the program and expand it in the future once we see how everyone is earning and spending their points.&nbsp;</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>We adapted the proficiency system from Pathfinder Second Edition (and now Starfinder Second Edition) and used it as the basis for the tiers that build the programs around.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>Legendary Loot:</strong> From time to time, Paizo will release items that are exclusively available to Legendary reward members. They might cost gold pieces, dollars, or a combination of both. They will likely be available in very limited quantities and for short periods of time.</p>
                   <p>We value our Experts and Masters and will ensure additional rewards are available for all tiers that require both gold and a dollar cost, as well as those that require only gold or other qualifying factors.&nbsp;</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2><strong>Questions and Answers</strong></h2>
                   <p>Here are a few answers to some of the most common questions I anticipate. For the complete legal rules (which take precedence over this Q&amp;A), you’ll need to wait until we launch.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>Will I keep my free subscriptions to Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society when Paizo Plus launches? <br></strong>No, but you will be able to purchase Society scenarios for free using gold.</p>
                   <p><strong>How is gold calculated?<br></strong>Paizo Plus takes the cart total after all discounts have been applied (but before taxes and shipping) and multiplies that amount by your gold multiplier (1, 1.25, or 1.5). For example, if you buy a hardcover book for $60 and use a $20 off coupon, you’ll earn gold based on the $40 purchase (40, 50, or 60 gold depending on your tier).&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>Can I spend the gold I would be earning from a purchase during that purchase?&nbsp;<br></strong>No, you can only spend gold after it has been earned.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>How long do I stay in a membership tier?&nbsp;<br></strong>When you achieve a new tier, you stay in that tier for 12 months. At the end of 12 months, Paizo Plus recalculates your tier.</p>
                   <p><strong>When I reach a new tier, do I need to wait a year before I can advance to the next one?&nbsp;<br></strong>No, when you reach a higher tier, you will be upgraded, and a new 12-month calculation will begin.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>Do I reach a new tier by accumulating gold or spending money?<br></strong>Only by spending money. Gold and dollars are two different pools.</p>
                   <p><strong>Does gold expire?<br></strong>Yes, after 12 months. You always spend the gold with the closest expiration date first. We’ll send an email to notify you about expiring gold if you’ve opted in to receive emails from us.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>Can I earn gold for past purchases?&nbsp;<br></strong>No. Only purchases made after Paizo Plus goes live and you’ve opted in to the program count. You can, however, write reviews for purchases over the last 5 years and earn gold on those reviews.</p>
                   <p><strong>Will Paizo give away free gold?<br></strong>That is a distinct possibility if you’re reading our fantastic emails and following us on social media!</p>
                   <p><strong>What happens if I terminate my account?&nbsp;<br></strong>All gold is removed and cannot be returned.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>Can I give gold to a friend?&nbsp;<br></strong>No. Gold is for your use only and is limited to your account.</p>
                   <p><strong>Does gold have any cash value?<br></strong>No.</p>
                   <p><strong>Do the discounts offered in Paizo Plus stack with store sale discounts?<br></strong>No. You’ll receive the single highest discount available.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2><strong>Sneak Peek of the Store</strong></h2>
                   <p>Here’s a brief look at what the team has been working on in the new store. Still subject to change, of course. Isn’t it pretty?</p>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">This was, Navasi decided, the third worst date she’d ever been on.</p>
                   <p>It wasn’t her datemate’s fault this time, though; things had been going pretty well with Pakelia considering they’d met on Shelyn’s Boudoir. Navasi wasn’t usually one for dating apps, but she’d been recommended that one by <em>Quig</em>, of all people. Probably he was just sick of hearing her complain about her disaster of a love life.</p>
                   <p>So she’d nabbed a reservation at Angelfish, Absalom Station’s hottest new seafood restaurant, and to her surprise, Pakelia turned out to be a real person, not a scambot—and a charming one at that. They’d already moved past small talk by the time their server brought them their menus.</p>
                   <p>Then everything went to hell.</p>
                   <p>As another explosion rattled the chandeliers, Navasi tugged Pakelia further into the cover of their overturned table. The verthani woman’s shoulders were a taut line, soot staining the green silk of her dress; her gaze darted around, seeking an exit. They’d been seated in the back corner, and the attackers were between them and the panicked crowd of diners and staff fleeing out the front door.</p>
                   <p>Navasi glared at the menu lying on the floor by their broken cocktail glasses, its scrolling display of the day’s specials replaced by a sigil of a cat’s paw clutching a scimitar. She knew that sigil. And if Trace was here, it wasn’t because she’d lucked into a table.</p>
                   <p>As the dust cleared, she heard, “<em>Navasiiiii</em>!” echo from the extemporary exit Trace’s grenade had blown in the wall, and any hope she’d had of Pakelia <em>not</em> identifying her as the target of this chaos evaporated. She glanced over but couldn’t read any emotion in Pakelia’s ink-black eyes.</p>
                   <p>A hail of electrical bolts singed holes in the wall behind them. That was definitely Trace’s first mate, Arvann. Navasi muttered a word that would have made her childhood etiquette tutor revoke her vidgame privileges for a week and fished her laser pistol out of the thigh holster strapped under her skirt.</p>
                   <p>“They’re after you?” Pakelia asked, glancing briefly at the gun, then away. Navasi sighed, cursing Trace’s timing. Her lifestyle could be risky, and Pakelia was an accountant, for Besmara’s sake. An accountant she’d inadvertently dropped into a firefight.<em> Oh, I am <strong>so </strong>not getting a second date</em>.</p>
                   <p>“Yeah,” she said. “Sorry. It’s… complicated.”</p>
                   <p>“A soap opera plot is complicated,” Pakelia said. “This is what I’d call a <em>problem</em>.” She peeked over the table. “They’ve got all the exits covered.”</p>
                   <p>Was it her imagination, or had Pakelia’s posture <em>relaxed</em>?</p>
                   <p>“Navasi!” Trace’s voice rang out. “Get out here before I ventilate this ceiling!”</p>
                   <p>“Because you’ve done the décor so many favors already,” Navasi retorted. <em>Disproportionate </em>was the key word for Trace’s reactions to pretty much anything. She’d found it intoxicating, once, before she’d gotten tired of feeling like a moth crisping itself on a flame. She scanned the restaurant for options. Trace’s tendency to bombard first and ask questions later had worked to their advantage in one way, at least; there were plenty of broken chairs and tables to use as cover, and luckily, everyone else seemed to have escaped already.</p>
                   <p>“Dare I ask?” Pakelia murmured in her ear. The scent of her perfume, floral and subtly sweet, cut through the acrid tang of electricity, and Navasi spared a moment of wistfulness for lost opportunities.</p>
                   <p>“Don’t date a Free Captain,” she answered. “And if you <em>do</em> date a Free Captain and then break up with them, don’t take a protection job on her route and foil a score she’s been planning for months.”</p>
                   <p>“Might I suggest,” Pakelia mused, “that perhaps you shouldn’t have let her know who did it?”</p>
                   <p>“My ship’s pretty distinctive,” Navasi said, wondering if she was imagining the hint of amusement dancing on the edges of Pakelia’s voice. She tilted her head at the panorama windows on the other side of the restaurant, which provided a beautiful view of Jatembe Park below. “Okay. See those windows?” The table shielding them disintegrated, another grenade boom echoing through the air. Navasi grabbed Pakelia’s arm and yanked her away from the wreckage. The two scrabbled toward the next overturned table.</p>
                   <p>“They’re our exit,” Navasi finished, brushing splinters off her dress. The purple satin was shredded and stained, probably beyond nonmagical repair. “Damn it, Trace!” she yelled over the table. “This dress was expensive!”</p>
                   <p>“I like your blue one better!” Trace called back. “What happened to the blue one?”</p>
                   <p>Navasi contemplated taking a deep breath and counting to ten. Instead, she popped up long enough to fire a few warning shots.</p>
                   <p>“You borrowed it,” she shouted, in between laser blasts, “and spilled nitro fuel on it. Remember?”</p>
                   <p>“Is that why you broke up?” Pakelia asked.</p>
                   <p>“No,” Navasi admitted, “but it should have been. Would have saved me some time and trouble.” Trace’s response to that was another grenade. Navasi hissed in surprise as Pakelia slid an arm around her shoulders and swept her along to new cover as their second table met the same splintery fate as the first.</p>
                   <p>“Is she trying to kill you?” Pakelia asked. As they ducked behind table number three, her knee only narrowly avoided skidding across the remains of someone’s mango shrimp. The question wasn’t incredulous, but neutral, a mere clarification of fact stated in the exact same tone she’d used to ask their server whether the Castrovelian glowfish sauté had nuts in it. She was handling this better than Navasi would have expected.</p>
                   <p>“Probably not,” she said. Trace had a temper, but she wasn’t <em>that</em> extreme. “If I had to guess, I’d say she just wants to knock us out, steal all our valuables, and call it even.”</p>
                   <p>“Well,” Pakelia said. “I’m fond of this necklace—and also my skull—so I’d prefer to avoid that.” She inclined her head toward the far wall. “Making a break for the windows it is. I assume you’ve accounted for the main problem?”</p>
                   <p>“That we’re five stories up?”</p>
                   <p>“That’s the one.”</p>
                   <p>“Did you see that tattooed vesk guy out there?”</p>
                   <p>“I tend to notice people blasting arc emitters at me, yes.”</p>
                   <p>“He’s got an autograppler on his belt.”</p>
                   <p>“You want us to fight past your angry ex and her crew, snatch an autograppler off one of them, and then dive out of a five-story window?” Pakelia asked.</p>
                   <p>“Pakelia,” Navasi began, her stomach sinking. “I’m sorry I—” She wasn’t sure how she planned to end the sentence—<em>ruined our date? have a chaos gremlin of an ex? am totally cursed when it comes to relationships?</em>—but before she could try, Pakelia grinned.</p>
                   <p>“Sounds fun,” she said, giving Navasi a wink. “I’ll cover you.”</p>
                   <p><em>With<strong> what</strong></em>? Navasi opened her mouth to say, when Pakelia made a graceful motion, her forearm unfolding to reveal a pistol. She decided to file her many questions away for when they weren’t under attack. <em>Time to go</em>. She stood, pointing at Arvann. “Get him!” she called, aiming a laser blast at his arm to punctuate her directive. She didn’t want to kill any of them, but Arvann was sturdy; he could take a few hits.</p>
                   <p>Pakelia sidled around the table, shooting off covering fire as Navasi made a dash for the overturned chair closest to the window. Trace’s vertical pupils were narrowed and her fur bristling, her ears pinned back against the top of her head. <em>Oh yeah, she’s mad</em>.</p>
                   <p>“You got in my way!” Trace hissed. “That score was supposed to set us up for years.”</p>
                   <p>“I just took a job!” Navasi said. “How was I supposed to know <em>you</em> were the one after that ship?”</p>
                   <p>“Like it would have changed anything if you’d known!” Trace lobbed another grenade, but this time Navasi dodged out of the way, nearly tripping on the silverware scattered across the floor.</p>
                   <p>“So what if it didn’t?” Navasi demanded. “You don’t get immunity just because we used to date!”</p>
                   <p>“I’ll keep that in mind should I decide to get up to anything nefarious!” Pakelia called, executing an impeccable tuck and roll to the table on Navasi’s other side. Her shots stayed perfectly steady throughout the entire maneuver.</p>
                   <p>“<em>And</em>,” Trace snarled, her pupils retracting to a line, “you still have my favorite Strawberry Machine Cake t-shirt!”</p>
                   <p>“<em>Seriously</em>? That’s why you’re blowing up the restaurant?”</p>
                   <p>Giving up on reasoning with Trace, Navasi made a dash toward Arvann. She only got halfway there before Trace’s gyrojet pistol unleashed a rocket, slamming her into the wall. Her dazed mind registered the incongruous view in the security cams—the restaurant’s mural of an angel holding a platter of fried calamari overlain by her in her ruined dress, two elegantly painted wings extending outward behind her—before she fell to the ground. She shook her head unsteadily, then looked up in time to see Arvann raise his arc emitter again.</p>
                   <p>“Watch out!” she called to Pakelia, but it was too late; his shot struck her in the leg. Pakelia stumbled, muttering a curse in Vercite under her breath.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Emanuel Pantaleon:</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p><em>Oh, that is <strong>it</strong>.</em> “Leave! My! Date! Alone!” Navasi snapped, scrambling to her feet. She grabbed Pakelia’s wrist, towing her along. Still clumsy from the electrical blast, Pakelia faltered, her ankle turning under her next step.</p>
                   <p>“Hey,” Navasi said, deciding that getting out of here overrode any concerns about being affectionate during a first (calamitous) date. “He barely grazed you.”</p>
                   <p>As they ran toward Arvann, she kissed Pakelia on the cheek. The effect was immediate: Pakelia’s gait quickened, the burns on her leg somehow no longer hindering her. This time, Trace’s shot whizzed past them, obliterating an unfortunate potted plant in the corner. Arvann steadied his stance as they neared him, no doubt expecting Navasi to try to bowl him over—</p>
                   <p>She let go of Pakelia, but she’d needn’t have; her date backflipped right along with her. She snagged the autograppler as Pakelia grabbed one of the overturned chairs and flung it through the window glass. In unison, they swan-dived, Navasi shooting the grappler at the exterior wall and grabbing Pakelia around the waist in one smooth motion.</p>
                   <p>“<em>Navasi</em>!” she heard Trace snarl. “You’ll regret this!”</p>
                   <p>“I’ll mail you your shirt!”</p>
                   <p>The wind rushed past as they dropped, the lights from the surrounding buildings blurring to streaks around them. As soon as the two hit the ground, they both collapsed, sprawling onto the grass. The ceiling’s vid display of a night sky twinkled peacefully above them, in marked contrast with the clusters of bedraggled restaurant patrons and staff gathered on the lawn, patching up minor injuries and calling the Stewards on their comms. In the distance, approaching sirens wailed closer. Navasi knew Trace and her crew would be long gone before they arrived; wiggling out of trouble was what she did best.</p>
                   <p>Navasi took a deep breath, the adrenaline rush fading from her veins. Replacing it was the sense of warmth radiating from Pakelia beside her…and the newfound certainty that her date was no ordinary accountant. “So,” she said. “Do I get to know why you’ve got a hideaway limb with a gun in it?”</p>
                   <p>Pakelia smiled. “I think that’s more of a second date conversation, don’t you?”</p>
                   <p><em>Second</em>—?</p>
                   <p>Relief swept through her. Maybe Trace hadn’t ruined everything. Maybe Navasi had found someone who wouldn’t cut and run at the first sign of trouble.</p>
                   <p>And maybe this date was one of her better ones after all.</p>
                   <p>“Since seafood’s off the menu,” Navasi said, sliding her hand closer so their little fingers brushed, “I know this great noodle place in Sparks…”</p>

Diamond has also sold Pathfinder and Starfinder into Amazon for us.</p>
                   <p>Paizo has stopped shipping products to Diamond. This means that our <strong><em>August releases will not be widely available at major bookstores or on Amazon</em></strong>. While these sites will likely continue to list products for sale or preorder, most orders for these titles will not be able to be fulfilled. To stay up to date with your collection, please stop by <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/locator">your favorite local game store</a> and ask them to order our upcoming releases, purchase them directly here on paizo.com, or <a href="https://paizo.com/store/subscriptions">sign up for one of our subscriptions</a>.</p>
                   <p>We expect Pathfinder and Starfinder products to remain unavailable through book trade channels for several months as Paizo determines our next steps and this matter works its way through the bankruptcy court. The best thing you can do to help Paizo and the 100+ publishers caught up in the Diamond bankruptcy is to order from them directly or go to your local game store and ask them to preorder upcoming releases so you’ll have them on launch day.</p>

                   <p><strong>GO BEYOND THE GATE! </strong></p>
                   <p>On the night of the Missing Moment, thousands stepped through portals across Golarion, seemingly against their will. These so-called gatewalkers returned with strange, paranormal powers but no memory of where they had gone. Can the heroes unravel the mystery of the Missing Moment before the source of their newfound power consumes them? This hardcover compilation includes all three adventures of the Gatewalkers Adventure Path, a worlds-spanning, mind-bending campaign for 1st- to 10th-level characters.</p>
                   <p><em>Gatewalkers </em>is available in standard hardcover, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0c6vz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Gatewalkers-Special-Edition">Special Edition faux-leatherette bound hardcover</a>, and PDF formats, as well as a deluxe Foundry VTT module!</p>

                   <p>The port of Bailax hosts lavish funeral games for a recently deceased hero, inviting all to compete for prizes and glory. When the adventurers investigate an ominous omen that interrupts the festivities, what they find won’t just transform them into mythic hero-gods, but will also incite Bailax to violent revelry and arson. Can the new hero-gods save the city from self-destruction? The Myth-Speaker Adventure Path begins with “The Acropolis Pyre,” a complete adventure for 1st- to 3rd-level characters.</p>
                   <p><em>The Acropolis Pyre </em>is also available as a deluxe Foundry VTT module.</p>

                   <p>Taldor responded to the Godsrain, the death of the war god Gorum, with an attempt to draw in the finest minds in magical study. They've invited scholars from across Golarion to attend a symposium on the Godsrain and the warshards, pieces of Gorum fallen from the sky, and the Pathfinder Society has decided to present their findings from some unique warshards they recovered in hopes of gaining insight from others across the world. The Aspis Consortium, though, finds this an excellent opportunity to gain valuables in the theft of research materials and to harm the Pathfinders by framing them for the theft. The Pathfinders must deal with the Aspis and clear their names lest they leave the symposium not with new knowledge but with a reputation dragged through the mud.</p>

                   <p>Strange earthquakes have been rocking the small town of Pimatsih in Sarkoris, and it seems to coincide with the arrival of Hesla Embersplitter and her newest acquisition: Riftcarver, the scythe that was once wielded by Deskari, the demon lord who ripped open the Worldwound. As the PCs arrive to investigate and help secure the town, a demonic incursion begins, and they must work to help bring the Sarkorians together to keep the town and its inhabitants safe. However, lurking behind the horde, the Split Ember has made the Lord of Locusts walk again, and he turns his hungry gaze and maw toward the Pathfinders.</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Quest designed for 1st- through 4th-level characters, playable in 2-3 hours.</p>
                   <p>Greengold, a port city within the elven nation of Kyonin, is recovering from a disaster, and this gives the Pathfinder the perfect opportunity to set up a lodge within the Elven nation. To do so, though, they must convince some of the leaders and most important people within the Elven nation. The Society has sent a team of its leadership to handle these negotiations, but they've also sent some newer agents to help make an impression of the potential training with the Society can provide. Of course, the Aspis Consortium, longtime enemies of the Pathfinders, have been trying to make inroads in Greengold, and some overzealous agents decide that the PCs would make excellent targets.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">It was with supreme regret that Ulka concluded the younger Blackjackets were looking at her with <em>admiration</em>. Not a revelation she wanted to have on the battlefield, especially while splattered with ghoul blood. She grimaced and wiped the flecks of crimson sludge off her arm, tinting streaks of her green skin black. The length of her polearm usually kept the mess at bay, but these rotbags were full of more fluids than she was used to, and they tended to <em>burst</em>.</p>
                   <p>It would take <strong>hours</strong> of scrubbing to kill any chance of an undead infection, and Lake Encarthan’s waters were probably just as tainted as the battlefield she stood on. Hell on a pike. Where? Where had she gone wrong? The Blackjackets were infamous for their loyalty to Druma and nothing else, and their masters knew the worth of that devotion. High pay, respect and prestige, the best equipment and training, pressed and fitted uniforms made of sturdy cloth, and thick leather boots to ward off the mud. The fashion wasn’t to Ulka’s taste, but she couldn’t complain about the quality. Not even Andoran’s army provided their irregulars with anything close. The skinflints in Druma even managed to keep a decent supply line running, and the Blackjacket’s civilian caravan had done a solid job of handling logistics...</p>
                   <p>The caravan! Screw the gods sideways, that was it, wasn’t it? She and her regulars just <em>had</em> to barge to the rescue when those shadowy forms had descended upon the civilian caravan. Dammit, dammit, dammit! She just had to look the hero, didn't she? She just <em>had</em> to feel a twinge in her black, shriveled lump of a heart at the thought of families and children getting slaughtered by something they couldn’t even touch! Ulka hated the fact civilians were even out here to begin with, but it was inevitable with mercenary groups this large. The fighters weren’t patriots, you couldn’t convince them to put up with the lonely hardships of a mere soldier.</p>
                   <p>Why did it have to be <em>shadows</em>? The caravan might not have needed her help against zombies or skeletons. They had a bold few who’d put up a resistance—Ulka made a mental note to circle around to that sullen little dwarven fletcher when this mess was done—but what could knitting needles and laundry lines do against something with no flesh?</p>
                   <p>Ugh, had she saved someone's husband? A daughter? That wasn’t the kind of devotion she could scare off with her usual tactic of being brutish and blunt. The very <em>last</em> thing she needed was more fresh-faced, bright-eyed whelps deciding they wanted to run along at her heels. From a moral standpoint, they weren’t that much better than the undead they were fighting. War camp hangers-on tended to be the kind of people who would smash in a dying widow’s nose in the rush to loot her family jewel box. But they were still people, and people always made things <em>messy</em>. She’d hear them sing songs around the campfire, watch them toss treats to the dogs, see one dance a little jig with his son. They’d save her the prime cuts of bacon at breakfast, ply her with bottles of Belkzen gin. They’d laugh at her stern grumbles and idle threats. They’d <em>like</em>her. They’d rush to save her on the battlefield and take an arrow straight to the throat.</p>
                   <p>Ulka ground her teeth against the back of her tusks. There was still a fight to be won.</p>
                   <p>She let out a howl that ripped across the battlefield, an undulating cry that an Andoren soldier had likened to a shepherd’s call sung by a wolf. Her scattered soldiers marched up, spears out, to form up around her in the brackish muck.</p>
                   <p>“These ghouls want flesh?” she yelled. “Rip their damned feet off their damned legs and cram them down their damned throats!” Her soldiers laughed as they charged into the fray, like the rotten rat bastards that they were.</p>
                   <p>Ulka followed behind them, assessing the situation. Barring reinforcements from the lake, the battle wasn’t likely to last much longer. The Tyrant might have unfathomable horrors at his command, but those weren’t here. These were nothing more than offal Tar-Baphon had thrown at a hapless village to clear out space in his barracks. Her mercenaries and the Blackjackets would obliterate them, along with anything else unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity.</p>
                   <p>Though perhaps not without casualties. There was a sudden roar from somewhere out on the water, as one of the stilted houses nearby exploded into flames. The shockwave sent the seasoned warriors onto the wrong foot; even Ulka stumbled. A minor error, speaking to their military discipline, yet the dead were not so easily stunned. The ghouls pounced.</p>
                   <p>Ulka gave a shrill whistle, using her polearm to gesture to the caravan behind her. “Artillery fire! Retreat inland!” she commanded. That had almost certainly been a volley from one of the Tyrant's skeletal warships, not that Ulka could see far enough in this quadruple-damned sunlight to confirm. May Sarenrae find a dead rat in her most holy breakfast. If Ulka ever met the goddess, she'd pluck that sunbird like a pheasant and string her up in the larder.</p>
                   <p>The ghouls loped into the Blackjacket front lines as the soldiers began to fall back, rusted blades and rotting nails seeking gaps in their targets' armor. A Blackjacket youth stepped wrong in the loose earth, stumbling as the reedy grass caused his boot to slip. Ulka stepped up beside the man—a boy, in truth—and, in a single smooth motion, swung her polearm up in an arc that ripped through the ground. She ran on swift, simple instinct, the kind that must be earned if one wanted to ply the trade of war and live past twenty. It came with enough force to rip the ghoul’s legs clean off its torso.</p>

                   <p>Ulka snorted as the disparate pieces thudded into the ground, baring her teeth and lowering her spear. A quick glance to the side confirmed her fears. The youth wasn’t just looking at her admiringly anymore. His gaze had gone past awe and settled just on the wrong side of devotion.</p>
                   <p>The orc snarled up at the quintuple-damned sunny sky, where she could only imagine the gods were laughing at her. “I'll hang the lot of you for this,” she mumbled.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, Starfinders!</p>
                   <p>Time flies in the Drift, huh? It seems like just yesterday we released two new classes for you to play around with, and it’s already past time for a wrap up! The Starfinder Second Edition tech class playtest featuring the mechanic and technomancer formally concluded on May 30th. Since then, the Starfinder team has been eagerly and diligently reading every word that’s been submitted on the playtest surveys. And remember: even though the playtest is over, you can still use the playtest mechanic and playtest technomancer until the two classes are officially released, including in Starfinder Society Organized Play.</p>
                   <br>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                   <br>
                   <p>The <strong>mechanic</strong> was overall a hit, but we have some tune-ups planned for the class before the final release. We noticed players had trouble using mines and turrets when fighting flying enemies and in zero gravity environments, so we’re looking into ways to make them a little more three-dimensionally compatible. Many players were confused about how and when turrets can be repaired, deployed, and deactivated and we will be looking into options to make sure that if your turret is stolen by a disgruntled enemy, you can still participate in the fight to retrieve your little buddy. We are also looking into sprucing up mods, potentially opening ways to affect allies’ weapons and making mods last a little longer, but we need to run more internal testing before we can make any promises!</p>
                   <p><strong>Technomancer</strong> requires some significant changes to make the class easier to play, less action starved, and add in more class features they can use with technology. We are currently looking at retooling Overclock Gear, perhaps combining it with more versatile Magic Hacks to highlight each programming language’s gear and shifting the focus of some of its class features away from spellshapes. We are also introducing minions called minibots you can purchase with credits as early as level 1. Minibots can help adventurers of any class with simple tasks, like recording video or carrying a single small item.</p>
                   <p>These are just a few of the potential changes we’re planning to test out internally. We’ve had a blast reading your feedback and hearing about your playtest experiences. Thanks again for your participation in the Starfinder tech class playtest!</p>

                   <p>THE RESERVE, NOW</p>
                   <p>By the time the transport’s wake lights up the drop off point, Obozaya’s already disappeared into the trees.</p>
                   <p>The pilot—a former squad-mate named Sozulak from her cadet days— had clicked his tongue against his teeth in amusement but kept his peace when she commissioned the flight. She read the smug superiority in the way he tilted his head, and while it irked her, expending energy on anything but her mission was a foolish waste.</p>
                   <p>The angry buzzing of the ship breaking atmo gives way to the deceptively gentle hum of semi-sentient flora and megafauna deeper in the jungle, and Obozaya can’t help the shiver of anticipation that ripples through her.</p>
                   <p>She has 12 hours before Solzulak returns. First order of business for the hunt is evening the playing field.</p>
                   <p>She allows herself to be fully armed as she digs the hole, deep and even with sides reinforced with thick branches she collected around the perimeter of the rendezvous. But when that is done, off come the weapons and armor, until she is left in cloth barely thick enough to keep the cold from stiffening her joints, and a doshko made for vesk who still had their egg-teeth.</p>
                   <p>Next, setting up the endgame.</p>
                   <p>The mechanism is as elegant as it is simple, though setting up the tripwire is difficult. The chill of the damp twilight air makes her feel sluggish. It galls her a bit, but she has to admit to herself that she has become accustomed to temperature-controlled environments. This operation, beyond being a tying up of loose ends, is a good reminder to work on lapsed training.</p>
                   <p>Finally, the seeds of victory are sown, and all there is left is to wait.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>THE RESERVE, THEN</p>
                   <p>A hunter’s moon crawling with bred and imported monsters from across the known galaxy, the Reserve was legend to all vesk.</p>
                   <p>Though hazing was officially frowned upon, any cadet wanting to come into active service with some glory to their name was welcome to face the wilderness for 12 hours. Surviving meant well-earned bragging rights, and Obozaya Ymeros’s secret visions of being a battle saint were enough to make up for any holes in her armor.</p>
                   <p>The rules were simple: walk into the jungle and survive until rendezvous, with just your doshko and your wits.</p>
                   <p>When Obozaya took her turn, it was the wet season.</p>
                   <p>As soon as the transport was clear, Obozaya ran into the clearing, shouting as hard as her lungs will allow. The rain was coming down hard enough that she worried maybe nothing would hear her call, but within less than 20 minutes it was clear her worries were unfounded.</p>
                   <p>A whiskered renkroda—female and young but large and vibrating with aggression—leapt from a nearby tree without preamble and nearly knocked Obozaya’s head off. Pivoting toward the change in heat above her, the vesk cadet’s foot slipped in the mud and the claws meant to kill only gouged, and ripped away a small horn.</p>
                   <p>Bleeding and surprised, Obozaya was still a lethal warrior. She managed to slice the beast across the face with her weapon, opening a wound that swallowed one of its eyes.</p>
                   <p>The renkroda was like a demon possessed, and Obozaya was nowhere close to being a battle saint. The fighting went on for an hour in the rain, felling trees and obliterating rocks in the fury of their clash, and Obozaya was forced to do something she had never even considered before: retreat.</p>
                   <p>The beast was not done with Obozaya though, and stalked her for hours, slashing and bleeding her at every turn, until all the vesk could do was use the remains of what must have once been a supply drop to barricade herself into a cave and wait for pick up.</p>
                   <p>The renkroda paced back and forth in front of the barricade, pawing at the debris and huffing aggressively. Obozaya was dead sure it would break in, but as the moon set, they locked eyes, and after a few tense moments, the beast snorted and loped away.</p>
                   <p>When the transport came, though she technically achieved her directive, Obozaya felt that she had left whatever honor she brought with her down on the surface of the hunter’s moon.</p>
                   <p>The bitter truth of the Lost Sage’s words echoed in her mind: <em>To taste of victory, first you must dine on defeat</em>.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>THE RESERVE, NOW</p>
                   <p>Obozaya makes a fire and breaks out her rations. She takes a long, deep breath.</p>
                   <p>Closing her eyes, she reminds herself of the soldier’s guiding principle. <em>For a warrior, the composure of the spirit and the calm of the mind should never be disturbed by the passions of the body</em>.</p>
                   <p>When the food is done, and she has stretched her muscles loose, Obozaya stands, cracking her knuckles, and takes up her simple doshko.</p>
                   <p>Her voice is exponentially louder now as she bellows into the night. Just like the first time she set foot on the Reserve, she does not have to wait long until her call is answered.</p>
                   <p>A horrible hissing growl is all the warning she gets before a shadow descends from the trees, quick as a lightning strike.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>THE RESERVE, THEN</p>
                   <p>While it wasn’t unheard of for a soldier to return for a go at the Reserve, it was incredibly rare, and always as a sort of confirmation of purpose to the Empire.</p>
                   <p>When Obozaya returned, it was barely more than a week after taking her Soldier’s Due, bristling with wounded pride and armed to the teeth with the best gear she could afford.</p>
                   <p>Plasma doshko in hand, bandoleers of incendiary and frag grenades on her armored chest, magnetar rifle slung across her back, she was a vision of righteous vengeance. And if her roar of challenge wavered in the middle, it must have been a trick of the wind.</p>
                   <p>The renkroda that appeared was huge and bold. It prowled into the clearing and met her gaze with one remaining eye.</p>
                   <p>Obozaya grinned and readied her weapon; she knew this beast. “Glad to know it’s personal for us both.”</p>
                   <p>The renkroda lunged and they fought bitterly, splintering trees and chipping rocks. This time though, it was the renkroda who ran, having suffered the loss of a talon and the tip of its tail.</p>
                   <p>Obozaya was relentless in her pursuit, lobbing incendiary grenades to force its path back towards her, shooting into its hide with her rifle to try and slow it down. She set the jungle on fire with her fury and her weapons, showing no mercy.</p>
                   <p>In the end, the renkroda, exhausted and gravely wounded, could do nothing but lie panting on the ground. Standing over her prey, Obozaya raised her humming doshko high, catching her reflection in the creature’s single, frightened eye.</p>
                   <p>Backlit by the fires raging around them, Obozaya looked to herself like a terrible demon towering over a helpless lesser being; it stopped her cold. The words of the Lost Sage came to her mind then: <em>The honor of an action is directly weighed against the cost of that action—with great difficulty comes great honor. No honor can be gotten from ill-intentioned action.</em></p>
                   <p>“There is no honor here.”</p>
                   <p>And, shaking her head, Obozaya gently lowered her doshko.</p>
                   <br>

                   <br>
                   <p>THE RESERVE, NOW</p>
                   <p>Claws strike metal, throwing sparks into the air.</p>
                   <p>Teeth close around flesh, tearing skin and muscle, just missing shearing bone.</p>
                   <p>Heavy bodies thud together with enough force to uproot trees.</p>
                   <p>They lock up for what feels like days, titans of war, and when they come together, the sound of it is like thunder. Their battle rips through the trees and rolls over hills, until they reach the dark heart of the jungle.</p>
                   <p>When they separate, Obozaya understands there is something <em>different</em> about the renkroda. It has the same scarred face, the same scattering of marks where bullets bit into its side, same stunted tail. But there is a nervous frantic energy to the beast now. The renkroda puffs up its body, lunging and retreating, as if to drive Obozaya back towards the path they had carved through the trees—to drive the vesk <em>away</em>.</p>
                   <p>The trap Obozaya laid earlier was behind the beast, though, and while the soldier was enjoying herself this time around, it was time to bring the game to a close.</p>
                   <p>“Sorry, girl.”</p>
                   <p>Straightening to her full height, Obozaya lets out an almost joyful, if menacing, laugh. With a high-pitched scream, the renkroda skitters backwards. Then it turns and runs away at full speed.</p>
                   <p>“Three, two, one—”</p>
                   <p><em>Thwup!</em></p>
                   <p>The snare stops the renkroda so fast it runs in mid-air for a whole second.</p>
                   <p>Stretching a kink out of her shoulder, Obozaya approaches the swinging, shrieking animal. It sounds furious, hissing and swiping at the vesk as she stands just out of reach.</p>
                   <p>“You let me get you at the end there, didn’t you? Are you tired of the game?”</p>
                   <p>The renkroda pants, glaring with its one eye, but seems to calm down as Obozaya walks around it.</p>
                   <p>“Interesting.”</p>
                   <p>Obozaya walks back around, and the beast howls again, swiping at her, then attempting to lunge and bite through its own feet to escape the snare.</p>
                   <p>“Huh…”</p>
                   <p>Looking around, Obozaya sees that just to her left is a felled tree, as big around as she is tall, with a hollow sizable enough to crawl in. She crouches down beside it to peer in, and the renkroda goes berserk.</p>
                   <p>The soldier has an idea of what she’ll find inside, and she is not surprised to see a clutch of half a dozen eggs.</p>
                   <p>Looking back at the bucking and screaming renkroda, Obozaya can’t help but chuckle and shake her head.</p>
                   <p>The nest was well hidden enough that she had missed seeing it when she set up the trap. Incredible.</p>
                   <p>Obozaya doesn’t hesitate. With a heavy sigh, she walks around to the far side of the trapped beast, avoiding its wild claw strikes as she raises her doshko and prepares to strike.</p>
                   <p><em>Bzzzz!</em></p>
                   <p>Her doshko buzzes as she swings and severs the line stretched taut above the renkroda.</p>
                   <p>She backs away as the renkroda lands on her clawed feet. The predator glares back at Obozaya and hisses, but she’s no longer attacking. She’s limping to her eggs. The two predators acknowledge that this is a ceasefire.</p>
                   <p>“Next time.”</p>
                   <p>When Solzulak picks Obozaya up, he is relentless about mocking her lack of trophy.</p>
                   <p>Once again, the words of the Lost Sage come to her mind:<em> The songs that are sung of us are what others claim to know about us, but the honor we gain when no one watches is what we know of ourselves.</em></p>
                   <p>Obozaya says nothing as they shoot up and out among the stars. That she knows is enough.</p>
                   <p><em>“There is no smooth nor easy path to the peak of the mountain known as Honor.”</em><br><em>—The Lost Sage</em></p>

                   <h3>Jenny Jarzabski (she/her/xe)</h3>
                   <h3><em>SFS1 #7-02: Zo! vs. Zo</em></h3>
                   <p>This adventure started out as a conversation in Starfinder team chat. We knew we wanted to create an adventure starring Zo!, so we started brainstorming potential themes and hooks. My colleague Dustin has always wondered about a specific detail of the Starfinder setting: Why does the undead celebrity Zo! share a name with the magnificent Triaxian port city of Zo? Is it coincidence, or some deeper lore? This question was on his mind as we tossed out weird ideas for another televised adventure.</p>
                   <p>Eventually, he brought it up.</p>
                   <br>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f6d3a4df-92a4-4f06-a8c3-d45b5d272550/SFSChat_Screenshot_01.png"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f6d3a4df-92a4-4f06-a8c3-d45b5d272550/SFSChat_Screenshot_01.png" width="40%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A conversations via the Teamwork Chat application.
Dustin Knight: Rescuing Wheel of monsters specimen cactchers? :shrug_tone2: Will the scenario address Zo! vs the city of Zo?
Jessica Catalan: I highly doubt that will be important to the adventure. So unlikely.
Jenny Jarzabski: Yeah, I think of it like Paris, France and Paris Hilton. It happens, lol!
Thurston Hillman: I mean... Doing a Legal Drama of Zo Vs. Zo!
Jenny Jarzabski: HAHAHAHAHA"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/aaca4c11-6f7b-47b3-adb7-ee23c22651bc/SFSChat_Screenshot_02.png"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/aaca4c11-6f7b-47b3-adb7-ee23c22651bc/SFSChat_Screenshot_02.png" width="40%" style="padding: 10px;" alt=" conversations via the Teamwork Chat application.
Thurston Hillman: Actually. Why don't we name the scenario Zo vs Zo! (spoiler, Zo loses)
Jenny Zarzabski: Ok I'm kind of into this idea. Go ahead, jump the holoshark.
Jessica Catalan: Haha. Courtroom drama, with extra drama. In that Case, if anyone has idea for Zo vs. Zo! hit me with those.
Jenny Jarzabski: I'll write it lol
Jessica Catalan: Sold. No takebacksies
Dustin Knight: I love it. Make sense they'd call the starfinder society since the case would involve unearthing ancient histories of the city and/or zo. :reaction: Objection!:"></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>And the rest is history.</p>
                   <p>Beyond this wacky conversation, my inspiration for Zo! vs. Zo included too many hours of Judge Judy, listening to a friend’s retellings of Ace Attorney games, and simply imagining what a TV court drama would look like on a planet with real dragons and semi-legal combat between residents. Triaxus (the planet) has lots of high fantasy themes, so I started thinking about what a typical fantasy concept like trial by combat would be like in Starfinder. I decided literal legal battles would probably be fought by combat lawyers hired to represent their clients. From that, another idea formed: What if the player characters act as Zo!’s combat lawyers in his legal case against the city? I thought that sounded truly outrageous, so that’s how I designed the adventure. If you’d like to experience more of my work, my favorites are <em>Mechageddon!,</em> a Starfinder First Edition Adventure Path about playing a squad of mech pilots defending their home world from kaiju, and <em>A Cosmic Birthday</em>, a Starfinder Second Edition adventure about surviving a disaster on Absalom Station.

                   <p>I am thrilled to have once again contributed to Starfinder Society adventures with <em>7-06:</em><em>Archives of Eternity</em>. I am also, as ever, grateful for the wonderful team who took my submission and improved it in so many ways. It is always amazing to see the art that is produced, as well as what the development and editing teams contribute. This was my first time designing a map, and the difference between what I submitted and the full art version was astounding. Metaplot adventures have their own challenges and bring their own joys. It is fun to be part of a bigger storyline while also writing a complete and independent adventure. Trying to think like and design for an alien culture that I don’t know or understand pushed my creativity. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the new campaign when the time is right. Happy gaming everyone.</p>

                   <p>Hello, all! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, frequent contributor to Paizo. For Starfinder Society this year, I got to return to everyone’s favorite(?) disaster influencer, Envar Tamm, in <em>SFS #7-08: Envar’s Awesome Rescue</em>! Envar’s been plaguingdelighting the Society for a while; my first outing with him was in <em>5-12: Envar’s Expeditions</em>, and it was fun to see how he’s grown (or not, sometimes!) over the years. I do have a soft spot for the guy, even when his judgment is questionable. My favorite parts of <em>Envar’s Awesome Rescue</em> are 1) Envar critiquing the kidnappers’ ransom note and 2) a certain encounter where the scenario’s villain goes old school damsel-tied-to-railroad-tracks on Envar’s poor body double. The scenario was a blast to work on, and I hope you all have enjoyed playing it as much as I did writing it.</p>
                   <p>I also got to co-write <em>7-11: Breaking the Crucible</em>, where Starfinder agents have to stop a group of Hellknights from carrying out terrible experiments against a captive population, which brought back some familiar faces as well! Finally, I helped out with development on 7-09 through 7-14, and it was fun to work on things from the dev side for once. The authors for those all did a fantastic job, giving First Edition Starfinder Society a fitting sendoff!</p>

                   <h3><em>SFS1 #7-09: Clutches of the Vault Lord</em></h3>
                   <p>Back in 2019 when Thurston asked me to work on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn8?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-204-Futures-Fall">Future’s Fall</a> I had no idea it would turn into me writing a multi-adventure tale, and I’m so grateful that he and Jessica let me be a part of it. I have so much admiration for Tom Phillips’ iconic Gloomspires story and this felt like getting to do my own echo of that.</p>
                   <p><em>Clutches of the Vault Lord</em> pulls together all the threads and characters of Salvation’s End in one climactic confrontation with the tyrant. There are callbacks to almost every NPC we’ve met along the way, more mishaps and bizarre vault experiments, a singing and dancing living cartoon complete with theme song, and a final(?) clash with the Vault Lord. I hope the adventure captures all the wacky, imaginative sci-fi we’ve come to expect from Salvation’s End while giving the Starfinders a chance to demonstrate their heroism against a classic villain who delights in their own wickedness. And if that villain leaves no trace of a body in their last moment, rest assured the echoing laughter you hear is only in your imagination…</p>

                   <h3><em>SFS1 #7-10: Rasheen’s Requiem</em></h3>
                   <p>Howdy folks. The name’s Solomon St. John—Sol to my friends, any pronouns are fine—and, in addition to being Paizo’s editing lead for both Starfinder and Pathfinder Society, this season I got to write <em>Starfinder Society Scenario 7-10: Rasheen’s Requiem.</em> Helping wrap up a storyline that’s been running since season one felt like a satisfying send-off to the first edition, even though there were half-a-dozen scenarios to edit between it and the true finale.</p>
                   <p>I’m always excited when I get to use my obscure master’s degree (in “Northern Studies,” a multidisciplinary cultural studies program from the University of Alaska) on the job, which I got with 7-10—the frontier settlement of Requiem Falls is essentially a sci-fi twist on Alaskan bush communities. The NPCs you meet there, Elarora and Naeyri, are likewise amalgamations of a few people I knew while living in Fairbanks, with some science-fantasy twists. The “razor roc” on the cover, meanwhile, is only loosely based on the birds up there, who <em>will</em> fight you but are thankfully much smaller.</p>
                   <p>My next adventure, <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-02: Mystery of the Frozen Moon</em> premiers at GenCon at the end of July with the rest of the Starfinder Society Second Edition kick-off; as you can probably guess from the name, that one also takes some cues from my degree, but you’ll have to wait to find out exactly what.&nbsp;</p>

                   <h3>SFS1 #7-12: Those Who Call</h3>
                   <p>Writing the finale to the season 7 metaplot, <em>#7-12: Those Who Call</em>, was exciting and flattering, but also stressful because I knew I had to really stick the landing. Sarmak, Kinpopo, and Hope-01 have been active participants in the players adventures, more so than the usual quest giver or escort NPC, so I wanted to make them feel like a part of the story while not taking spotlight and agency away from the players.</p>
                   <p>I wrote <em>Those Who Call</em> to be like a multitable special. I wanted players to choose their adventure and feel the impact of the other team of Starfinders on the mission. I also wanted it to feel like an action movie with a high sense of urgency and mustache-twirling evil villains melodramatically monologuing.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>My favorite part of the scenario was designing the factory itself. They say write what you know, so I may have brought a sense of soullessness to a corporate military industrial complex. It’s fine. I’m fine. Everything’s fine. I’m fine. Hopefully the setting reinforced just how evil the First Ones are. If you’ve not played yet, I recommend tackling the Logistics and Planning room.</p>
                   <p>When I’m not writing for Starfinder or managing IT projects, I perform stand-up and improv comedy. My debut stand up special, I Think I Get It Now, is on my youtube channel @BrentBowser1337. And let me know what you think of The Swarm in <em>Starfinder Alien Core</em>.</p>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description"><em>“Hey. You up?” </em></p>
                   <p>Chk Chk’s antenna vibrated as he sent a telepathic message to the group. He could have sensed Dae and Obozaya through their linked vitals, but the whirl of the protection-class security robot’s gripper arm demanded his focus. One moment he’d been chattering with Dae while feeling for secret panels and inscriptions along the wall. The next thing he knew, a robot was waving mechanical pincers in his face.</p>
                   <p>Chk Chk drew his painglaive and repositioned himself further down the cramped corridor, away from the door. He wasn’t ready for another battle. There had been no time to rest since Dae blasted the last of the swarm of observer-class security robots that had chased them through the (allegedly) abandoned space station’s corridors. Less than a minute ago, Obozaya had slammed the butt of her rifle against an escape pod’s electronic lock. Percussive maintenance, she’d said. Then the wall popped open and revealed two robots nestled among the wiring—dormant, then jerking to life. Now one robot blocked Chk Chk’s view of his friends with its hulking white chassis.</p>
                   <p>He stepped back and thrust the painglaive between the machine and his body. The robot’s gripper rhythmically spread and shut, a blunt claw smooth and heavy with thousands of pounds of reserved force. Reserved for his delicate bones. His heel hit a wall, bending polymer with his weight. Not stable enough to push off from, but solid enough to pin him as that claw came for his throat.</p>
                   <p><em>“Chk Chk, you can’t ask that! What will my fans think if this chat leaks?” </em>Dae’s lighthearted response interrupted as he dodged to the side and away from the attack. Suddenly Dae cut the theatrics: <em>“I’m up. Obo’s not.”</em></p>
                   <p>The answer was obvious once Chk Chk took a second to scan their interconnected vital signs. Dae pulsed with the rise and fall of the sun, while Obozaya’s vitality signs had dulled and slowed. Still alive, but unconscious and wounded. He focused on Obozaya—and the claw crushed his shoulder.</p>
                   <p>He tried to pull away, but it held tight and squeezed. Pain exploded and pulsed down his upper arm. The robot stopped crunching his carapace and raised him into the air. The mechanical groans deepened with the effort of lifting him, but his path up remained smooth and constant. As his feet left the ground, he kicked wildly at the robot’s metal chassis, hoping to break something. Even in danger, the grunts of the machine reminded him of a deep bass line somebody could dance to. Before he knew it, his foot was kicking in time to the beat.</p>
                   <p>The pain in his shoulder escalated every moment the claw grabbed him, spiking when he swung in its grasp. A crunch came from his back. He screamed.</p>
                   <p>“Chk Chk!” screamed Dae’s outside voice. Their pitch warbled higher and louder than normal, as though they were moving toward them from far away at incredible speed.</p>
                   <p>And they were!</p>
                   <p>Dae flew across the tiled floor at the speed of a meteorite impact, crashing down in a halo of sparks and broken tile. Their sun-etched arm slammed into the robot’s back. Hydraulics released with a hiss as Dae dragged it backward in an explosion of gravity, ripping the air around Chk Chk and popping the sensors in all his auxiliary antennae at once. The claw opened. Chk Chk fell. He grabbed for a pipe jutting from the wall and missed, scrabbling at smooth metal with his own weak claw, another keeping hold of his weapon.</p>
                   <p>He landed on his back and floundered for a moment. If Dae kept this footage, he swore he’d delete this scene later. But he was out of the robot’s agonizing grip, and at last he could help. Obozaya, slumped in her armor, draped over the twitching body of the other robot. Dae ripped the arm that had just crushed Chk Chk’s shoulder out of his attacker in a spray of sparks, then waved it at the camera drone floating overhead with a cheeky grin.</p>
                   <p>Chk Chk felt for Obo’s vitals. She was safe and stable, but she still needed help. As he scrambled over tiles now slippery with leaking oil, he popped his crumpled shoulder back into place. No time to worry about that. A second shadow was forming under Obozaya where her blood had pooled. Chk Chk’s bond showed him her injuries as though they had been inflicted upon his own body.</p>
                   <p><em>Blunt force to the head</em>, he assessed, <em>laceration on the forehead and possible concussion. </em></p>
                   <p>The edges of Obozaya’s shadow stretched toward him as he pulled her pain into himself. His forehead stung until it felt wet with blood, though it was only the transference of her suffering to him. The wound wasn’t real, but the pain was. Meanwhile, Obozaya’s shadow trickled into her wounds. Flesh grew into scabs and bone fused. Chk Chk sensed her pain vanish, felt the blood returning to her numb limbs. His pain would heal his friend, so he could take it.</p>
                   <p>Obozaya’s eyes shot open.</p>
                   <p>Her lungs opened with a gasp.</p>
                   <p>Chk Chk held her gaze as the dull ache of a head injury melted away from her and into him. Obozaya shifted upward, stood, and walked toward him. She loomed tall as ever, but now he could sense her body was full of pain. Old injuries. New injuries. But she always kept going. So would he.</p>
                   <p>“Chk Chk, you’re getting sloppy,” she bellowed, though she ended with laugh. “Try to keep up!”</p>
                   <p>Chk Chk smiled. He released the pain, laughing weakly at Obozaya’s cheerful bravado. Time began again for him. During the fight, the world hung suspended. No thoughts, no time to process his adrenaline response, nothing. Now, the exhaustion crept into him, deeper than he expected.</p>
                   <p>&nbsp;<em>“I’ll make it up to you,” </em>he responded, too winded to speak.<em> “How about coffee?”</em></p>
                   <p>&nbsp;“Deal.” She said.</p>
                   <p>“Don’t forget me!” Dae added, barely looking up from the robot they were assessing. “Remember, I drink graviton style.”</p>
                   <p>Chk Chk smiled as he pulled his setup from his bag. Dae liked their beans darker than a black hole with zero sweetness or additives, while Obo’s drink of choice was a pepper-and-honey latte, heavy on the honey and steamed milk. As he pulled out his gear, he tested his shoulder by rotating it in the socket. Sore, but not unbearable. He’d apply a medpatch first, enjoy its anesthetic numbness and sharp scent of peppercorns, then he could get to grinding.</p>
                   <p>Brewing coffee in his tiny field press was one of his favorite tasks. He didn’t need to perfectly execute the string of commands Raia taught him to jailbreak the deluxe nanopress machines favored by most cafés. Here, he could tune out and slip into the elegant simplicity of the ritual. Dae and Obozaya had already launched into a post-mortem discussion of their break-in, analyzing the successful approach followed by the accidental activation of hidden security robots, and ending in a blow-by-blow commentary about the fight.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>The grinder growled as Chk Chk inhaled, halfway hearing their talk, which was more technical than he ever wanted to delve. Why spend so much time trying to avoid pain? He didn’t get it, but then again, Obozaya didn’t understand why he sought out mosh pits. And after the dance, or the fight, his calming ritual was to unspool the grinder, measure out and place the beans, then grind any excess adrenaline into fine coffee for the press.</p>
                   <p>Brewing coffee contained the rhythm of a song, with its precise timing and variety of sounds. Growls, plinks, and drips kept the brew moving. Kept his friends going.</p>
                   <p>“Hey, Chk Chk.” Obozaya interrupted his thoughts again, just as he started to visualize how this moment would fit into a music video. “What happened back there? Did you get lost or something?”</p>
                   <p><em>“I was distracted,” </em>he responded telepathically. His throbbing shoulder grated at his attention, making speech undesirable. <em>“It’s my fault. I ended up on the wrong side when the robots ambushed us.”</em></p>
                   <p>Dae cleared their throat, then looked down. Yeah, he had been too busy joking with them to notice the robots lunge at him and Obozaya. A few more seconds and they would’ve been a unified team when the robots popped out from their hiding place.</p>
                   <p>No time to dwell on it. He tipped the beans into the press and activated a quick-heat pouch of water. Perfect temperature in seconds. As it warmed, he placed it over the med patch.</p>
                   <p>“I thought you priest types were good at paying attention,” Obo kept talking, though her eyes were fixed on the waiting press and its steady drip of coffee. “Try to keep that from happening again.”</p>
                   <p>He nodded. The water was warm enough now, though he let it linger on his shoulder for just a second longer. It poured into the upper chamber of the coffee maker, then slowly dripped downward. He unscrewed the metal cups from his mess set, added instant milk to one, and set them to self-heat. At the bottom of his pouch was the bottle of syrup he made before setting out. An ounce into the milk, and all that was left was to wait.</p>
                   <p>“Look at this, bestie!” Dae said, interrupting his reverie by waving the robot arm in his face to show off its twisting knotted snake logo. “Aspis parts.”</p>
                   <p>“You’ll be Aspis parts if you knock the coffee over,” Obozaya grunted. “Good find, Dae.”</p>
                   <p>The press pinged, quieting Dae and Obo with the promise it was finished. Chk Chk poured two drinks, before he set to making his own. Black with a pinch of glitter magically coaxed into color by the drinker’s current mood. It was his favorite barista trick learned in Takoris. He brewed his coffee Fulldark black with extra syrup, the surface swirled with shifting opalescent fire—the sheen of Zon-Shelyn’s sacred gown, and the myriad colors of the Drift, or the colors of his changing heart.</p>
                   <p>He sighed at the bitter aroma and sipped sweet, warm comfort. Soon, they would all be back on their feet and charging through the next door as a team. Until then, coffee.</p>

                   <p>Salutations to all intrepid Pathfinders and Starfinders!</p>
                   <p>The Paizo offices are closed today, June 19th, to pay respects to a crucial day in African American history. Many of you may have associated America’s criminalization of slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation, and this would be partly true. The painful and more devastating truth is that after January 1st, 1863, for 901 more days, thousands of slaves remained in bondage, most completely unaware that these changes were happening mere miles away from them. News regarding the end of the Civil War was intentionally blocked from entering Confederate states, and the slaves in those states were not informed of their freedom until Major Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Texas on June 19th, 1865. That day, colloquially known as Juneteenth, marked the true end to slavery in America and the beginning of a new life for every African and African American on this soil. Although we and other marginalized groups like ours still show resilience daily in our uphill battle for civil rights, we celebrate Juneteenth as one step among many towards true equal rights and equal opportunity.</p>
                   <p>Juneteenth is more than just an automated notification on your calendar. It’s more than just a portmanteau created and maintained in a culture of resistance. Juneteenth means <em>freedom</em>.</p>
                   <p>A great way to show solidarity and to support Juneteenth and our community is by donating time, money, or other resources to a black-focused organization. Here are the ones we recommend:</p>

                   <p>And speaking of warmth, let’s start off with a quest in Kyonin, where the Pathfinders have finally received some warm welcomes after years being on the outs with elven leadership. Between helping deal with a demon problem (apart from Treerazer) in <em>#4-99: Blessings of the Forest</em>, and offering to help in the cleanup of Greengold in the aftermath of Treerazer’s attacks (during the <em>Spore War</em> adventure path), the Pathfinder Society has won no small amount of gratitude in Kyonin, along with the approval of Queen Telandia. They’ve decided to build a lodge in Greengold, but it’s not enough to have the queen’s blessing, the Pathfinders must win over several influential figures in order to get approval for the most suitable sites. The impression your PCs make will determine the quality of the lodge that we end up with. Of course, nothing is ever straightforward when it comes to the Pathfinders. Our old friends the Aspis Consortium are trying to covertly set up shop during the rebuilding efforts, and I imagine they’ll have something to say about the Society setting down roots in the elven kingdom.</p>

                   <p>And now for scenarios. We’ve got a couple great ones this month.</p>
                   <p>First, the Godsrain has left no small amount of chaos across Golarion. Taldor, though, has taken it upon themselves to become a center for scholarly research into the aftermath of Gorum’s death, and the warshards made of his shattered armor that fell to the planet on the day of his demise. They've invited scholars from across Golarion to attend a symposium on the Godsrain and the warshards, and the Pathfinder Society has decided to present their findings from some unique warshards they recovered in hopes of gaining insight from others across the world. The Aspis Consortium, though, again won’t let things be too easy for us. They find this an excellent opportunity to gain valuables in the theft of research materials, and to harm the Pathfinders by framing them for the theft. It’ll be up to you to deal with the Aspis and clear their names lest they leave the symposium not with new knowledge but with a reputation dragged through the mud.</p>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">Like many of his kind, Grimmyr is unable to return home.</p>
                   <p>Grimmyr was born to a family of iivlar keepers of Clan Idrun, one of many small nomadic jotunborn communities within the Fray, that sub-planar realm that lies between the mortal Universe and the Ethereal Plane. A place of silver, shifting sands and insubstantial copies of geographic features and animals of the Universe, the Fray has been the realm of jotunborn and their progenitors for millennia. Grimmyr—and indeed all jotunborn—was told since before the time of his weavingday about the responsibility bestowed upon their ancestors by the gods so long ago: to watch over the mortal Universe that they helped create. This stewardship has been passed down throughout the generations, and during times of chaos and strife, jotunborn must venture to the mortal realms to lend their aid.</p>
                   <p>Grimmyr knew the stories, knew that he might be called upon to redirect a river or replant a forest, but he never expected that it would actually happen. He was happy tending to his family’s colony of iivlars, watching them spin their silk, shepherding them to patches of ethereal grass where they could feast, and gently pushing aside their claws when they got a little too curious. He could see his life’s path stretching before him. He would meet a pretty girl from a passing clan, fall in love, and be joined. They would have a child, and Grimmyr would teach them the ways of iivlar-keeping. Perhaps one day, he would be considered a clan elder and resolve disputes between neighbors and guide the community through the Fray.</p>
                   <p>But then, a god died.</p>
                   <p>The cosmic upheaval of Gorum’s death was felt across the entire multiverse, and the Fray was no different. All jotunborn could feel the havoc being wrought in the mortal Universe deep in their souls, like a spiritual itch that needed to be scratched. Grimmyr was out in a field when the ground began to tremble. Something began to tug at his soul, and he instinctively knew that he was being called elsewhere to fulfill his ancestral duty. Time was short, but the insectile iivlars couldn’t be left unguarded, so he quickly shepherded them back to the clan. His mother and father were waiting there for him. He could see in their eyes that they also knew.</p>
                   <p>The goodbyes were solemn but not despairing. All three of them understood the weight of this obligation, and while a jotunborn leaving the Fray could be gone for weeks or even months, Grimmyr’s parents believed they would see him again soon. His father presented him with a pair of sturdy gauntlets made of molted iivlar shell to keep him safe, and his mother said a brief prayer to Skode, the giant goddess of heroism. Another violent shudder ran through the ground, as if the Fray was impatient for Grimmyr to fulfill the covenant. Grimmyr nodded silently to his parents and gave in to the pull on his soul.</p>
                   <p>Grimmyr appeared among lush jungle greenery, the most plant life he had ever seen in one place at a time. It was night, so he concentrated on the silk woven through his skin, creating a soft glow by which he could see. As he began to get his bearings, he smelled the smoke. He pushed past broad leaves and enormous flowers to find a fishing village on a river, one of its huts engulfed in flames. Before he could react, an arrow pierced his shoulder. Several brown-skinned elves—presumably residents of this settlement—trained their bows upon him, with one nocking another projectile. He held up his hands in a gesture of supplication, but his enormous size and glowing skin must have confused and frightened them, so they loosed a full volley at him. He barely dodged out of the way, an arrow glancing off his gauntlets as he shielded his face.</p>

                   <p>Grimmyr’s flight brought him closer to the river, where other elven village folk formed a line to move buckets of water from the shore to the burning building. They froze in fear at the sight of him, but that allowed Grimmyr to notice what he first thought was a log slide closer to a villager knee-deep in the river. The mud-brown crocodile suddenly surged forward, but Grimmyr had already pushed the villager to one side, and its jaws clamped down on Grimmyr’s arm instead. Prying the crocodile off him, he hurled it back into the river, where it swam off to find easier prey.</p>
                   <p>Though they were initially wary of Grimmyr, they didn’t stop him from carrying barrels of water from the river to help put out the fire. Later, a white-haired elven elder tended to his wounds. She spoke a few words of Grimmyr’s language, and through their conversation, he learned where he was: a settlement on the Vanji River in the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse on the world of Golarion. The elder explained how a piece of burning sky fell from above to cause the fire, a piece of something larger plummeting down far to the southwest.</p>
                   <p>Since then, Grimmyr has been tracking that fallen star, certain that it is the key to what brought him to Golarion. Other fragments of it scattered along its trajectory, causing minor disasters where they landed. After following one such piece to the hideout of a band of river pirates, Grimmyr realized he required more protection than just his gauntlets and pieced together a suit of armor to fit his frame from various sources. Some he purchased, some he scavenged. To defend himself, he added several striking heads to a stone maul, hoping that its intimidating appearance would deter otherwise aggressive foes.</p>
                   <p>Despite all this, Grimmyr hasn’t forgotten about home. He believes that whatever powers brought him to Golarion will be able to return him once he has dealt with the catastrophe he was sent to correct. Until then, he will continue to protect those that need it, much in the same way he kept his iivlars safe.</p>

                   <p>In the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/mythspeaker">Myth-Speaker Adventure Path</a>, the player characters visit the city-state of Pol-Bailax as it mourns the death of an exceptional citizen—one who would have become a hero-god in better times. Yet Iblydans don’t simply weep; they celebrate a life well lived. The PCs’ arrival coincides with spectacular funeral games to celebrate this hometown hero, and it’s a perfect time to join the festivities, discover Iblydan history, and begin the PCs’ own legend. As they do, mythic power is reawakening in Iblydos as not seen in ages. It’s all fun and games for now, but the PCs soon attain mythic power of their own. Will they become the hero-gods Iblydos has long sought? And what is this mythic power, why does it emerge now, and what is the cost of this power?</p>

                   <h2>Starfinder Adventure: Battle for Nova Rush</h2>
                   <p>Welcome to Free RPG Day 2025! Take the leap into Starfinder Second Edition as prisoners of a nefarious pirate captain. When the ship comes under attack by the Corpse Fleet, it’s time to seize your chance to escape! Battle space pirates for control of the Nova Rush, befriend a chipper virtual intelligence, and escape the Corpse Fleet alive in <em>Battle for Nova Rush</em>!</p>
                   <p>This short adventure for 1st-level characters puts players in the role of four iconic Starfinder heroes: Chk Chk the mystic, Dae the solarian, Iseph the operative, and Navasi the envoy! Each character comes with complete pregenerated stats and roleplaying tips for the adventure—and they’ll need to use every tool at their disposal to liberate Nova Rush and their new friend, Captain Concierge, from dastardly space pirates!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Pathfinder Adventure: The Scourge of Sheerleaf</h2>
                   <p>The quiet village of Sheerleaf has always been a place of peace and prosperity, but the rolling hills and herds of sheep have caught the eye of a vicious dragon who demands their subservience. Though they’ve tried to stand against the villainous monster, the village is helpless to fight him when he takes hostages. But Sheerleaf hasn’t given up hope; even if no one in the village is strong enough to take on their foe, surely some traveling adventurers can help!</p>
                   <p><em>The Scourge of Sheerleaf</em> is a short adventure for 10th-level characters where you take on the role of one of four unique dragonblood characters—people who have special abilities in their lineage granted by a powerful connection to a type of dragon. This adventure sets the dragonblood heroes on a mission to defeat a powerful dragon and save the village he’s been tormenting! The four pregenerated characters provide all the information needed to jump right into this Free RPG Day adventure; all you need are your dice and your friends!</p>

                   <p><em>Starfinder Player Core</em> has everything you need to launch a new Starfinder campaign or blast your Pathfinder game into outer space. <em>Starfinder Player Core</em> explains how to create a player character (PC), choose their gear, and prepare them to start in your very own sci-fantasy space epic. Note that all content in this book is compatible with the Pathfinder Fantasy Roleplaying Game. You’ll recognize some familiar rules if you’ve played Pathfinder before, but don’t worry—<em>Starfinder Player Core</em> is packed full of fresh content and rules!</p>
                   <p>So, what’s in the book? Let’s start with the ABCs of character creation: ancestry, background, and class.</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>10 new ancestries, which are also called species in Starfinder.</li>
                    <li>Two versatile heritages, which you can mix with any ancestry!</li>
                    <li>Tons of new backgrounds for characters in the Starfinder setting, like icon and vidgamer!</li>
                    <li>Six new classes designed to help you play your own sci-fantasy hero.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>But wait, there’s more! <em>Starfinder Player Core</em> also contains:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>New skills, plus futuristic Lores.</li>
                    <li>New feats!</li>
                    <li>New equipment!</li>
                    <li>New spells!</li>
                    <li>Rules for playing the game.</li>
                   </ul>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">You and your friends can play out countless hours of adventure with <em>tarfinder Player Core</em>!<br>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>New Ancestries<strong><br></strong>Let’s deep dive into those 10 ancestries, shall we? I love meeting alien nufriends!</p>
                   <p><strong>Android:</strong> Play a synthetic humanoid with an artificial body and a real soul. Androids have enjoyed a few upgrades since the era of Lost Golarion, so even if you’ve already played an android in Pathfinder, you should check out the new options!</p>
                   <p><strong>Barathu:</strong> Have you ever wanted to become an enigmatic alien with a bizarre form? How about a floating blimplike entity that can merge with other creatures and rewrite their own genetic code? Barathus got you covered for weird and wonderful.</p>
                   <p><strong>Human:</strong> These adaptable survivors from Lost Golarion are a legacy ancestry with new options. What more do I need to explain? You’re a human, right? (Aren’t you?)</p>
                   <p><strong>Kasatha:</strong> These traditionalists traveled aboard a worldship called the <em>Idari</em> from a faraway home world. Instead of colonizing the worlds they found, they remained aboard the <em>Idari</em>. Kasathas have four arms, always cover their nose and mouth in public, and sometimes carry puzzleblades, a traditional weapon that’s ritualistically assembled each day.</p>
                   <p><strong>Lashunta:</strong> If you like the idea of playing a humanlike alien, consider a lashunta. They’re psychic humanoids who choose how they evolve at puberty, becoming a burly warrior or graceful enhanced scholar—or perhaps becoming someone entirely different and unpredictable.</p>
                   <p><strong>Pahtra:</strong> Pahtras are cat people from a rebel planet who are known for their achievements in magic and music. Their home world Pulonis just declared independence from the Veskarium empire and joined the Pact Alliance. I’ve heard they don’t put up with any imperial nyansense nowadays.</p>
                   <p><strong>Skittermander: </strong>That’s me, Captain Concierge! We’re energetic, six-armed people with colorful fur who love to give our allsix helping our nufriends and old pals every day! You’ll never regret having a skittermander on your team!</p>
                   <p><strong>Vesk:</strong> Vesk are scaled humanoids with a powerful physique and warmongering reputation. They even think they conquered the skittermander home world, Oeddertchonk, but who are they kidding? I know a lot of vesk who defy that reputation—they can be anyone they want to be, just like you.</p>
                   <p><strong>Ysoki:</strong> Pathfinder players might recognize the clever, flexible ratfolk who tend to love tinkering with technology. Their small bodies make them really comfy with space travel—just like us skittermanders!</p>
                   <p><strong>Versatile heritages</strong> are special heritages characters of any ancestry can take. Anyone can become a borai or prismeni.</p>
                   <p><strong>Borai:</strong> Created by botched resurrections and necromantic experiments, a borai is an undead soul attached to a living body. In addition to fitting in at every goth club in the galaxy, they get creepy abilities from their connection to the grave.</p>
                   <p><strong>Prismeni:</strong> Prismenis are touched by the energy of the Drift, a recently discovered hyperspace plane, or have a deep connection to spectra, the elusive “Drift Angels” who are native to hyperspace. Most of them have rainbow hair, flighty personalities, and become ace pilots.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Starfinder is a team game. Your party should have a mix of different classes, feats, and skills.<br>

                   <br>
                   <h2>New Classes</h2>
                   <p>One of the most exciting parts of any game is trying out new classes! Here’s who you can be in Starfinder Second Edition.<br><br><strong>Envoy:</strong> You’re the face of the party and the self-proclaimed battle leader (or cheerleader, mascot, boss, whatever)! Boost your friends and trip up your enemies by giving out directives, then lead by example to grant your team extra buffs.</p>
                   <p><strong>Mystic:</strong> You have a connection to a primeval force of the universe, and you channel powerful magic and healing through bonds with your allies. You are a healer and spellcaster, with classic Pathfinder spells plus new magic from the future.</p>
                   <p><strong>Operative:</strong> You have a deadly aim and a keen set of tactics to take down powerful enemies. You’re likely a scout, infiltrator, or spy for your party, and you’re a primary damage dealer.</p>
                   <p><strong>Solarian:</strong> You cycle between the powers of gravity and light, manifesting solar weapons and unleashing stellar energy in flashy attacks. You’re a close-quarters combatant relying on your mobility to stay out of danger.</p>
                   <p><strong>Soldier:</strong> You unleash heavy weapons on foes while protecting your allies. Soldiers are close-quarters combatants who use powerful area weapons or two-handed weapons and wear heavy armor.</p>
                   <p><strong>Witchwarper:</strong> You’re a living paradox who can warp reality with powerful spells and manifest the infinite possibilities of the multiverse in your current reality. You’re also a powerful spellcaster with access to familiar favorites from Pathfinder and flashy new magic from the future.</p>
                   <p><strong>Archetypes:</strong><em>Player Core</em> brings you archetype options for each class, plus a new archetype that lets you become a galactic explorer with the famous spacefaring society: <strong>Starfinder Field Agent!</strong></p>
                   <h3>But what about tech classes?</h3>
                   <p>I get it, you want drones and magic hacks and deployable mines! The Starfinder Tech Playtest (April 21<sup>st</sup> to May 30<sup>th</sup>) features the <strong>mechanic</strong> and <strong>technomancer </strong>classes. Mechanic and technomancer will be appearing in a future book which the StarFriends haven’t told me about yet.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3fae1cfe-b919-428a-8500-4ee5a33b45f2/PZO22001_NavasiAdministeringMedicine.jpg"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3fae1cfe-b919-428a-8500-4ee5a33b45f2/PZO22001_NavasiAdministeringMedicine.jpg" width="95%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Art by Emanuel Pantaleon: Navasi the iconic envoy ducks behind cover in a desperate street battle against hovering drones.

                   <h2>New Skills</h2>
                   <p>If you’re going on an adventure in outer space, you need a starship, and it doesn’t hurt to know your way around a computer console. That’s why we’re introducing two new skills, <strong>Computers</strong> and <strong>Piloting</strong>, to represent taking control of a starship or hacking into a secure computer system. Starfinder has a bundle of new Lore skills too—Fashion Lore, Junker Lore, Vidgame Lore, and Technology Lore are some of my favorites.</p>
                   <h2>New Feats</h2>
                   <p>The Starfinder team had fun coming up with cool feats to show off how skills work in Starfinder Second Edition. You can create your own temporary Barricade on the battlefield, become a Phreaker and learn to hack without a toolkit, gain a free augmentation with Augmented Body, and more! Plus you’ll notice many of your favorite feats from Pathfinder Second Edition, like Battle Medicine and Toughness.</p>

                   <p><em>Starfinder Player Core</em> contains an armory of new gear to outfit your character for their galactic adventures. Instead of using magical runes to upgrade your items, in Starfinder Second Edition tech equipment follows an improvement system we like to call CTASEUP. Most characters start out with commercial gear, but gradually upgrade to tactical, advanced, superior, elite, ultimate, and paragon versions.</p>
                   <p><strong>Tech Gear:</strong> Whatever you need for exploration, we’ve got you covered with medical supplies, adventuring equipment, entertainment devices, and more. Chug a sharpshooter serum to improve your aim, use your comm unit as a flashlight, or slap a medpatch on an injury.</p>
                   <p><strong>Armor:</strong><em>Player Core</em> has all kinds of neato options like kyokor plating—that’s armor made from the scaly hide of a kaiju.</p>
                   <p><strong>Shields:</strong> Raising a shield is always a solid tactic on any planet, and you’ll enjoy checking out tech like the retractable irising shield or hardlight phase shield.</p>
                   <p><strong>Weapons:</strong><em>Player Core</em> has everything from laser rifles to dueling swords. There’s some wild weapons in here—a neural lash you control psychically, a cutlass glimmering with stolen lives, a singing spear, and a nasty little number called the painglaive, a motor-powered fangblade mounted to a polearm.</p>
                   <p><strong>Upgrades:</strong> Most armor and weapons are customizable, with slots for one or more upgrades. Upgrades include everything from environmental protections to jetpacks or magical holoprojectors that change your gear’s appearance. <strong>Solarian crystals</strong> are a special type of upgrade that boost a solarian’s solar weapon attacks.</p>
                   <p><strong>Grenades:</strong> Grenades are consumable items that explode in a small radius, dealing different types of damage and creating different effects. In Starfinder Second Edition, throwing a grenade doesn’t require you to make an attack roll. Instead, you chuck it at the target, and any creatures in range make a Reflex save against your class DC. Just be careful where you throw those electromag grenades. They cause tech creatures to glitch out and that could be a problem for your friend Captain Concierge.</p>
                   <p><strong>Magic Items:</strong> Have you ever wanted a special contact lens that lets you peer into the record of all mortal experience? What about a crystal <em>diva’s microphone</em> that amplifies your voice and performance? A pocket dimension in a backpack? Starfinder magic items can do all this and more.</p>
                   <p><strong>Augmentations:</strong> Augmentations are a special type of gear surgically implanted into your body that modifies your anatomy. If you want to breathe fire, just head down to the clinic and get a dragon gland implanted in your throat. Flying is no problem with ultralight wings installed into your arms or other alien appendages. There are different types of augmentations in this book: biotech, magical, magitech, and tech. Augmentations also include apex items that permanently increase your attributes.</p>
                   <h2>New Spells</h2>
                   <p>With two new spellcasting classes in this book, you’ll find a trove of brand new spells plus many of your old favorites from Pathfinder. In this chapter, you can give yourself a <em>glow up</em> or summon a <em>phantasmal fleet</em> of starships to bombard your enemies.</p>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">An arc of electricity shorted whatever communication device the void-eyed figure was wearing as Seltyiel’s sword slid through it, cutting yet another one down. Black shadows clung to his blade, dulling its shine. His face morphed into a mask of disgust for a moment before the sound of shattering glass drew his attention.</p>
                   <p>“I’d like to ask again—where are we and what the hell are these things?” He hissed.</p>
                   <p>“Whenever we have a moment to breathe, I’ll work on an answer.” Kyra’s voice was cool and calm with an edge of humor to it—Seltyiel could tell from the curve of her mouth that she was teasing him in that friendly way of hers. But there was worry in her expression too as she burned a hole through another of the empty-eyed creatures, leaving a smoking, shimmering ember in its core as it fell.</p>
                   <p>“Tsk.” With a snort and a click of his tongue, Seltyiel accepted her answer. The creatures’ faces were identical, and while their bodies seemed solid enough, they melted into shadow when he cut them down. “Copies are never a good sign.”</p>
                   <p>“Neither is this.” Kyra gestured down the hallway the creatures had slunk down, drawing his attention to the path of draining color everywhere they had touched, the imprint of their footsteps growing by inches and degrees. “Especially not if we are where I think we are.”</p>
                   <p>“Oh, you’ve got that answer? That might be the best news I’ve heard since we got here,” Seltyiel quipped. He adjusted his grip on his sword, watching the door at the end of the hall, hearing the distant crashes of destruction.</p>
                   <p>A sigh escaped Kyra’s lips as she uttered a quick prayer, watching the bleached skin melt off one of the foes she’d blasted, revealing a shadowy mass underneath. “Normally, I would agree with you. This place is special—if I am right—and I would be thrilled to find myself here. But to see what these monsters are doing to the Radiant Palace of Possibility? It makes me sick.”</p>
                   <p>The words brushed against a thread of memory: a book on a table years ago, candlelight barely warming the words on the page. A mythological place, said to have been spun into existence by the Radiant Prism themselves, an intersection at the point where all threads of reality met and reflected each other. A boundless demiplane ruled only by love. A horrible place to be shattering under the invasion of same-faced undead.</p>
                   <p>“Divinity’s not much my business—I’ll leave that to you. But I agree that this needs to be stopped.” Seltyiel was not entirely sure how to stop a seemingly endless onslaught of copycat ghosts, though.</p>
                   <p><em>Find their source and rout them out. </em></p>
                   <p>The whispers on the edges of his consciousness urged him forward down the hall, closer to the source of the sounds. Gritting his teeth, Seltyiel gestured with his blade. “Something’s happening over there.”</p>
                   <p>Following the trail of sapped color as panes of iridescent crystal turned dull, murky gray, Seltyiel led the way further into the palace, Kyra watchful at his back. As they approached, the sounds of destruction grew louder, crashing off the walls.</p>
                   <p>So focused on hunting the trail that the whispers were guiding him toward, Seltyiel bit his tongue in shock when Kyra pulled him back behind a pillar of crystal as hurried footsteps approached. She hid them just in time. A priestess, garbed in robes of rainbow silk that seemed to be losing color with each step, streaked out from behind cover and ran for the doorway. She stumbled and was caught by the two ghosts behind her. Her starknife clattered to the floor and she screamed.</p>
                   <p>Before either Seltyiel or Kyra could react, the undead pulled her face from her body, her skin slithering up the figure’s arm to settle atop its own skull, framing the void eyes with the priestess’s final expression of terror.</p>
                   <p>“Join us. Welcome to the fleet. We are one, we are all,” the monster wearing her face said in a thousand voices.</p>
                   <p>The voices that came from the creature’s mouth spoke in unison without feeling. The priestess’s stolen face turned empty and blank as the monster reached down, shadows and void energy pouring into her corpse. The void slid over her body, consuming her and erasing the marred flesh of her face into an empty space.</p>
                   <p>The two creatures pulled her to her feet, one of them handing her another mechanical device—a firearm, but not like one Seltyiel had ever seen—and marching her back to the central chamber. She was now a member of their ranks.</p>
                   <p>“Everlight, keep us safe while we rescue the servant of your beloved Starsong.” Kyra’s prayer was quiet and whispered, her hand gently touching Seltyiel’s shoulder and carrying with it the soft warmth of sunlight. He knew she meant to fight. But first they needed to know more about the enemy.</p>
                   <p>Taking a breath, Seltyiel drew a sigil with his free hand, his body shimmering out of view as he snuck into the central chamber, scoping out the field. A large airship—far more technologically advanced than anything he had ever witnessed—dominated the center of the room, surrounded by dozens of uniform-clad undead wearing the same masked face over empty eyes. Closest to the ship, presumably giving the orders, were several floating heads in glass baubles held aloft by a tiny propeller, with no bodies save for the spindly metal limbs that hung down from their chassis. Strange, angular runes shimmered down one of their limbs as the floating head hissed a spell in a language that sounded suspiciously like Necril, the tongue of undead on his world.</p>
                   <p>The faceless creatures awaited their orders, some platoons already set on destroying the shaped crystal and mirror glass, leaving colorless clutter in their wake. Blood splattered on the floor was the only sign remaining of any resistance, their corpses recruited to join in the very destruction they hoped to prevent.</p>
                   <p>Seltyiel returned to their hiding spot behind the crystalline pillar, expression grim. “I don’t like our odds. Two of us, hundreds of them—and they can just keep making more.”</p>
                   <p>“The surest way to lose is to give up before we’ve started. We are in a holy place—there is power here those creatures cannot hope to understand. We need only reach out and tap into it.”</p>
                   <p>Seltyiel bit back a snarky remark as a shockwave rattled the chamber. One of the crystalline chandeliers collapsed into millions of shards—crushing an entire squad of faceless troopers. None of them flinched. After all, units were expendable in pursuit of the overall goal.</p>
                   <p>“Don’t let those things take my face when I die.” Seltyiel shifted his weight back and forth, adjusting his grip on his sword and waiting for Kyra’s nod before hurrying into the room, leaping into a platoon of the faceless.</p>
                   <p>The glowing arc of Kyra’s scimitar cut through a line of undead as she followed suit, each of them now surrounded by encroaching hordes of empty-eyed, hollow masked creatures with blank smiles on their faces.</p>
                   <p>“Abandon yourself. Become one. Become us. You are nothing. We are all.”</p>
                   <p>The words came from nowhere and everywhere and made Seltyiel’s stomach turn, anger flaring up in the pit of his stomach as he feinted left and swung right, slicing directly through one of the creatures and watching it dissipate into nothing.</p>
                   <p>They were wrong—he wasn’t nothing. But two individuals against a sea of endless copies could only hold out so long.</p>
                   <p>“Looks like we’re late to the party!”</p>
                   <p>An unfamiliar voice sounded from a balcony above. The faceless turned to seek out the new life force, giving both Seltyiel and Kyra an opportunity for a quick series of blows and a moment to breathe.</p>
                   <p>A human woman in sleek diamond armor and a catfolk figure dressed in wildly colorful garb stood on the balcony. Somehow, Seltyiel knew the catfolk wasn’t an amurrun from his world, but a <em>pahtra</em> from somewhere else. The human pointed another strange firearm down at the faceless horde and the pahtra cracked what appeared to be a ribbon made of fire. The glee in their catlike face was unmistakable, sharp teeth flashing in a grin. “Come and get me, Corpse Fleet clones! First one to the mirror gets an autograph!”</p>
                   <p>The pahtra jumped off the balcony with a graceful flip, landing on their feet in front of a trio of mirrors. The moment they landed a rainbow aura surrounded them, making it almost impossible to look away as thousands of different reflections appeared in the mirrors’ faces.</p>
                   <p>Beams of red fire streaked down from above as the human shot her gun—a laser pistol, Seltyiel thought, but how did he know that?—and pointed at her ally’s position with her free hand. “Get over there!”</p>
                   <p>Under the cover of laser fire that singed the air like a spray of <em>blazing bolts</em>, Kyra and Seltyiel dashed across the room past dazed faceless to the mirrors where the pahtra stood. “I’m Dae, that’s Navasi. You look like hot garbage, but I love your ‘fits,” the pahtra said cheerfully. “Are they vintage? Oh, and I hope you don’t mind, but I’m recording right now.” They beamed at a tiny mechanical device hovering overhead that Selytiel had only just noticed.</p>
                   <p>Seltyiel faced the mirror to see what Dae was talking about. He and Kyra were panting, cut up, and bloody. Color had been sapped from their torn clothing. His hair was disheveled and not in a fetching way. Their reflections looked a mess for a moment, but then the images in the mirror began to change.</p>
                   <p>“My name is Seltyiel,” he said. “We appreciate your intervention.”</p>
                   <p>“I am Kyra.” Kyra clasped Dae’s hand. “I can see the Everlight shining in you. Thank you for your help.”</p>
                   <p>The warping visions of himself pulled Seltyiel’s eyes back to the mirrors, and he didn’t notice Navasi dash over to the group, pursued by more faceless undead.</p>
                   <p>“The mirror—” he started to say, but it was already too late. As each hero turned to face the multifaceted, multidimensional crystal wall, they were shocked by what they saw. The mirrors showed more than just their reflections. Infinite versions of themselves borrowed from memories and dreams and other realities fractalized in the shining crystal.</p>
                   <p>Navasi watched herself cock her gun with a wicked smile in one facet, clench bloody credsticks in a robotic fist in another, and press a kiss to a blue-skinned woman’s cheek in a third. In yet another facet, she walked beside a handsome diplomat dressed to the nines as his security detail and date all in one. The many versions of Navasi were all equally complicated and stunning, and she watched with delight as a troupe of her other selves talked their way into—and out of—infinite situations.</p>
                   <p>Every Dae was in the spotlight. They performed old-timey canticles clad in spectacular costume at Golarion World, backflipped into a ribbon spiral in front of a cheering audience, sunned themself in the viewport of a solar yacht, and seamlessly rescued a crowd of fans from armed attackers without missing a step of their dance routine. And of course, Dae’s kaleidoscope included their moody bestie. In one mirror, the two piloted a mech together cutting down colossi with a gigantic chainsword and powered glaive.</p>
                   <p>Seltyiel bit back a sneer as he made eye contact with the many broken, beaten versions of himself—past, present, and future. But there were more facets behind that. He saw a proud man holding an ornate blade, electricity arcing up and down its length; there was a cozy candlelit chamber, Seltyiel’s reflection bent to a book as a beautiful yet unfamiliar man fell asleep beside him, snuggled against his side; Seltyiel stealing a last sharp kiss from a lover turned enemy, her dagger gleaming across his cheekbone as he pulled away to toss a ball of gleaming magic, its trail pointing directly to the heart of the devil it struck. Power, magic, anger, affection, and more feelings than Seltyiel had words for coursed through him as he grappled with his many reflections.</p>
                   <p>Kyra’s mirrored selves were all limned in fire. The Everlight illuminated a glimpse of every world that she had the luck and joy to live in: simple, humble Kyra who served a rural temple in threadbare robes; a radiant woman touched with godhood, fire in her hair and sunlight pouring from her eyes; her scimitar cutting through a ghoul just as Merisiel’s blade found its head, pulling the creature’s body in two directions; Kyra as a blushing bride in ceremonial robes joining hands with the same, now her wife. Though the images had no sound, Kyra could hear Merisiel’s precious laughter in her memory. <em>“Here, you are all infinite. Now you can become every version of yourself.” </em>Kyra recognized the Voice speaking—her goddess Sarenrae, the Everlight, who formed the Radiant Prism with goddesses Desna and Shelyn as a divine expression of their romantic relationship.</p>
                   <p>Curious and compelled, Seltyiel watched Dae, Kyra, and Navasi touch the crystal mirrors. Rainbows swirled around them and their forms blurred. He’d rather die alone than become part of the shadow army pillaging this palace, but those weren’t his only choices. He reached for the mirror. For a moment, all witnessed a sight most mortals could only dream of. The reflections melted away and were replaced by a trio of goddesses, fingers intertwined as they held hands. Anyone in the Universe would know them—Sarenrae, a burning star forged into a woman’s form; Desna, a moth-winged alien with elfin ears and a fickle smile; Shelyn, beauty made flesh with rainbow hair and a tender smile.</p>
                   <p>They blew the heroes a triple kiss that floated on butterfly wings, exploding into a visual cacophony of sparks and mirrors. All the reflections of the heroes poured into them, filling them with light and power.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>The Radiant Prism was gone but their power thrummed in Seltyiel’s veins. He and his allies turned from the mirrors feeling stronger than ever before. Where their footsteps fell, the gray, conforming magic of the invaders was pushed back, replaced with radiant color.</p>
                   <p>Defiant grins on their faces, Seltyiel, Kyra, Navasi, and Dae held their weapons aloft, free hands ready to cast or block. Their very silhouettes seemed to shift and morph, vibrating with the power of their alternate selves as they clashed with the faceless troops, tearing through them with ease. Copies are never a match for the real thing.</p>
                   <p>Seltyiel grinned as the last foe dissolved in a wisp of smoke. Only the bodies of the doomed priestess and siblings of her order remained, slumped on the floor and already stirring as color leeched back into their garments and their faces reformed from emptiness. The airship—or starship, as Dae would correct him later—had blinked out of space, leaving a hole in the palace wall that was already starting to repair itself. Gentle music replaced the harsh sounds of battle and conquest.</p>
                   <p>Seltyiel’s eyelids fluttered as the same music soothed over his mind, returning him to sleep where his body and spirit could slip out of the Radiant Palace of Possibility back to his own home, his own time. Later he’d ask Kyra about the dream, and she’d remember it the same way, down to the last detail. He couldn’t ask Dae and Navasi, but he was sure they were out there somewhere, changed by their adventure.</p>
                   <p>He was sure they must feel it too—the echo of the encounter lingering, a thrumming mantra in his mind.</p>
                   <p><em>In the face of conformity, there is no greater power than being yourself. </em></p>

                   <h2>The Scions</h2>
                   <p>In our previous projects we’ve always put our own spin on things. For The Abomination Arsenal, we tried to reach the bottom of Pathfinder’s largest megadungeon with a party consisting entirely of gunslingers. With The Strange Aeons Experiment, we assembled a team of Pathfinder players who knew nothing about Lovecraft or the Elder Mythos, and sent them through the Strange Aeons AP to see what would happen. The list goes on, but we’ll let you check out each project as you may.</p>
                   <p>The years have gone past and we’ve come far enough to be able to look back across the ground we’ve covered. We’ve grown older together, added new members, said hard goodbyes, and finally stopped to look back at ourselves. This has been a personal journey for us as members of Order of the Amber Die, just as much as it has been a journey through adventure paths in front of the community.</p>
                   <p>This project won’t just be a playthrough of <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/skykingstomb">Sky King's Tomb Adventure Path</a> , it will focus on appreciating time and family. The Sky Scions is about a dwarven family in-game, and Order of the Amber Die as a family ourselves. For this project, Adam has dialed up some of the oldest members of the Order. In each marathon you’ll see a cameo from as far back as 1987, when three 10-year-olds sat in mom’s basement and dreamed up a club centered around their favorite die.</p>
                   <p>We’ve always stuck to the complete rules set, never deviating. As the years went by, our inbox filled with messages asking what house rules we would employ if we ever chose to. With the release of Pathfinder Second Edition and Remaster, we also received requests asking which optional rules we would utilize from the GM Core if we ever chose to. The answer was always simple and quick, but the Will DC increased with each passing year. Around the fire pit at our headquarters, Fort Rannick, we looked at the time visible on each other’s faces and finally decided to go for it.</p>
                   <p>As our house rule for this project, age modifiers from Pathfinder 1E will be adapted to Pathfinder 2E. A player’s age in real life determines their age category (and thus their adjusted attribute modifiers) in-game. We broke down our membership by decade, so the “venerable” age category in-game consists of players that are 50-59 years old out of game, as those are our oldest members. 40-49 in real life is considered “old,” and 30-39 is marked as “middle-aged” for modifiers. While we acknowledge that there are plenty of exceptions to these modifiers in real life, we wanted to create something that distinguished us by age at the table. Each marathon will feature different rosters of dwarves (therefore ages) from the clan. Still, it’s our first house rule across all these years. We must be getting old.</p>
                   <p>As a variant rule in addition to our house rule, we will be employing the “free archetype” from the GM Core. After reading through the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ehs?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Highhelm">Highhelm hardcover</a>, we were reminded of how faith is one of the fundamentals of dwarven culture. We wanted to feel the dwarven pantheon as an ever-present part of our story; thus, we all have the same free archetype: Blessed One. We purposely spread the deities among the characters, so we’ll have a variety around the table at each marathon.</p>

                   <h2>Meet Clan Firecask</h2>
                   <p>We are all playing strong-blooded dwarves of Clan Firecask, a Goldhilt clan from the greatest of the dwarven sky citadels: Highhelm. Our main colors are orange and green, and amber features in various ways, of course. Our accent color is blue topaz, and each of our clan daggers is adorned with the matching stone.</p>
                   <p>We’re not just members of Clan Firecask, we’re directly related to Clanleader Perhill Firecask herself. Which in turn means we’re related to one another, of course. On your left at the table might be your in-game grandparent, and across from you could be your own child or even a sibling. This should make for some interesting roleplaying, and we’ll include a section in each blog to let you know how it goes along the way. When it’s your great-grandchild who just dropped to dying 2 across the battlefield, you might make different decisions than you normally would. As for family spats? Expected.</p>
                   <p>While the Ironhilt and Steelhilt clans of Highhelm might consider us “soft hands,” our dwarven hands are always busy—busy making beer! This wouldn’t be an Order of the Amber Die project without a high level of immersion, but it was a bit tricky trying to figure out how to approach this vital piece of Clan Firecask’s identity. We came up with this: what if we brewed our own beer out-of-game, and learned the process together as a group the same way our dwarves have spent their lives doing? We ran it by one of our friends, Brandon Gillam of <a href="https://www.runehammer.online/">Runehammer</a>, since he was joining us periodically throughout the adventure path. Brandon offered to up things a notch: what if we contacted a brewery and had our own unique beer for this project, label and all? This is where <a href="https://sacredvice.com/">Sacred Vice Brewing</a> in Philadelphia got involved. Brandon drew the label, Sacred Vice made the beer, and our GM dropped the release of Clan Firecask’s newest beer—<em>Battle Axe</em>—right into the actual storyline of our campaign!</p>

                   <h2>Highlights from Preparing Sky King’s Tomb:</h2>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Knowing that Highhelm would feature heavily in our launch marathon, our GM worked closely with <a href="https://www.blackbardstudios.com/">Black Bard Studios</a> to make sure the city appeared as one of our best setups over the years. We’re excited to show you more!</li>
                    <li>Some of our friends from over the years will make an appearance. Ready to see Joe O’Brien of the <a href="https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/">Glass Cannon Network</a> as a dwarf from Clan Firecask? How about Brandon Gillam as Renck, the wise bard and keeper of clan recipes? You might even recognize Brandon’s expert hand as the artist of the portraits in this blog. Stay tuned.</li>
                    <li>Elemental Stones is one of the most popular games of Highhelm. Our GM has already told us to learn it, as he’s making sure it will feature directly in this campaign. You know us by now, so we’ll stop the session and play a real game every time it comes up.</li>
                    <li>Another thing we still love about being around the table is our props. Dwarven coins from <a href="https://www.norsefoundry.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq0ZsZ7Yxexo4cKzbydAlHKE0dTfn1TTJ5uYO5NbQ0tUmih2H0C">Norse Foundry</a>? Pile ‘em up. A dwarven helmet, some quality wooden mugs, and custom clan daggers? Yup. Beard extensions for those of us who dare? Let’s go for it. Growing your actual beard for a year in advance? Jody did it.</li>
                    <li>It’s been a while since we played <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20171216-Beach.jpg">on location</a>, and how awesome would it be to experience the Darklands in an actual cave? Pennsylvania has quite a few caves that are managed for tourists, so our plan is to find one that will let us spelunk in and set up our Pathfinder game!</li>
                   </ul>
                   <br>
                   <h2>What’s Next</h2>
                   <p>We’ll drop a blog for every marathon we play, with a plan to finish this AP in six or seven marathons. As Adam likes to remind us, a TPK ends the project. Expect to hear from us again soon with part one!</p>

                   <p>The nations at the heart of Avistan were once bastions of chivalry, faith, and history.

Don your armor and polish your shield, for bloodstained battlefields and courts alike await! This gazetteer looks at the history, cultures, and current events of Andoran, Druma, the Five Kings Mountains, Galt, Kyonin, and Taldor, accompanied by character details and options to prepare any character for the trials soon to come.</p>

Unable to convince the High Council of Absalom of Hesla's ill intentions, they turn to their agents to look into what's happening at Ember Manor in the Eastgate District and determine what this ancient artifact is and what she could be planning.

                   <p>Years ago, the Starfinder Society suffered a monumental setback during a mission into the region of space known as the Scoured Stars. After a year of rebuilding, the Society returned to the Scoured Stars and rescued its surviving agents, only to be pushed out by an aggressive species known as the jinsuls. Over the course of the next year, the Society built a coalition of allies and defeated the jinsul menace, scattering them and stopping the divine herald Dhurus from consuming the energies of the Scoured Stars’ awakening deity, Kadrical.</p>
                   <p>In the years since, former First Seeker Jadnura has patiently waited within the Scoured Stars onboard his starship, the <em>Perfect Silence</em>, acting as a self-appointed steward of the system and communing with the god Kadrical through deep meditation. Now, a potent celestial event is about to occur within the Scoured Stars—an alignment of the stars and planets poised to create a strong metaphysical bridge that could further empower Kadrical and allow the deity to take another step into reasserting itself within the cosmos. Jadnura has invited the Society’s most senior agents to witness the monumental event alongside him, aboard the <em>Perfect Silence</em>. When disaster strikes, the Starfinders experience echoes from the Starfinder Society’s recent past and endure an encounter with the divine.</p>

                   <p>A Starfinder Society Special designed for 1st- through 4th-level characters (subtiers 1–2 &amp; 3–4).</p>
                   <p>The Szandite Collective is an alliance of seven planets spread across four adjacent star systems in Near Space, connected by a psychic network of szandite crystals. Although the Collective has consisted of seven planets for all of its post-Gap history, long ago, it once numbered eight, as the planet Krethiskar failed to reconnect following the Gap. With only an approximate idea of where the planet existed in relation to the rest of the Collective home worlds, Krethiskar is lost, and progress on its rediscovery is painfully slow.</p>
                   <p>Palivhar Chooser of Hues, a respected scholar, astronomer, and member of the Starfinder Society’s Forum, is a citizen of the Szandite Collective and has long sought the missing planet Krethiskar. After decades of sifting through psychic echoes stored within szandite crystals, leveraging potent divinations, and cross referencing the Starfinder Society’s vast galactic databases—all to meet with failure—Palivhar experienced a vivid, recurring dream of a voice, reaching across time and space, to guide them to Krethiskar. Following their dreams into the unexplored reaches of Near Space, Palivhar discovered the very planet that had eluded them for so long: Krethiskar.</p>
                   <p>Now, Palivhar leads an expedition of Starfinders to Krethiskar’s surface, to survey the planet, locate its szandite crystals, and determine what happened to the citizens of this lost collective. Unfortunately for the Starfinder Society, Krethiskar is a huskworld consumed by the voracious Swarm in ages past. Palivhar’s survey expedition is doomed to become a desperate fight for survival, as the hibernating Swarm awaken. Can you escape the planet alive?</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Ulka knew the warmth of family for less than an hour. Her first cries were a wail of grief for her parents, slaughtered alongside the rest of her hold in a brutal raid by rival orcs. The murderers left the orphaned child untouched among the corpses, prey for wolves or the elements to take, chortling and sporting among each other for their cruelty. Empty Hand scouts found the babe not long after, screaming in defiance at the heavens, as if daring the gods themselves to answer for their sins.</p>
                   <p>The Empty Hand had come to recruit Ulka's people to the banner of their leader, Grask Uldeth. A tiny bundle swaddled in boar skin was not the prize they sought, but they obeyed their orders all the same. Ulka grew up a sullen child in Urgir, troubled and quiet except for outbursts of unprovoked ferocity. Far from considering this inappropriate, the orcs who raised Ulka were impressed by her ferocity, encouraging her to turn her anger into a blade upon the battlefield. Ulka resented them all for this, loathing those who saw her pain as an opportunistic tool. Of course, this bitterness only made her tutors and caretakers prouder.</p>
                   <p>Ulka does not remember how she fell in with Grask’s second-in-command, Ardax the White-Hair. All she recalls is that Ardax had little interest in her temper or even her prowess in combat. Instead, Ardax would ask her questions she didn't have the answer to or challenge her to seemingly simple games that were far more complex than they first appeared. While this led to quite a few tantrums from young Ulka, she appreciated these mental challenges far more than any other lessons the Empty Hand inflicted on her.</p>
                   <p>She was eventually adopted and raised by Ardax’s militant enforcers, the Closed Fist. This upbringing focused on developing her martial prowess, with Ardax personally seeing to her instruction in lessons of strategy and leadership. Ulka excelled in all categories, though she could never quite match the older man’s uncanny prescience. Even now, though Ulka scoffs at the thought of fate or prophecy, she wonders if Ardax sought her out because he sensed something about her. For a while, she even dared to believe she had found her place with him, her future.</p>
                   <p>Perhaps Ulka might have one day commanded her own orc hold. Yet once again, death came to call upon her. Once again, it strode past her without a nod and took everything away from her.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>It came on an evening like any other, when Ulka was standing watch. As the moon hung high overhead, she began to feel a nagging doubt in the back of her mind, so she checked on Grask Uldeth to discover the warlord dead. His body was left on his throne, impaled on multiple swords. Guarding was meant to have been a simple task, and yet she had seen nothing, heard nothing. Such supreme failure, even if the assassination had been the result of powerful magic, would lead to only the direst of consequences for her.</p>
                   <p>Ulka knew her limits. She had no chance of unraveling the truth in her current position, with her current skills and knowledge. Rather than let herself be used as a pawn, to let others make her pain into another tool, she chose to flee Urgir. Ulka would gather allies, finding plenty of orcs and others who were as cast aside and wronged by the world as she was. She would build her power until an opportunity to avenge Grask and reclaim her reputation presented itself.</p>
                   <p>Mercenary work sustained her. It was plenty, and it was Hell. Together, she and her followers clawed a living from troughs of bloody ground. Despite her stern orders and brutal punishments, her efforts left too many orphans, yowling babes left to lament the world's cruelty just as she had. Ulka refused to let her rage consume her, as the Empty Hand had urged her in her youth, but she felt whatever passed as her soul grew scabs and scars. Her commands became louder, more demanding, more vicious. Her troops gave her the surname Oathshriek for her battle cry, which promised violence to her enemies and even greater violence to her gods should she fall in battle.</p>
                   <p>Death came to her again, this time laden with rewards. While orcs could face prejudice among the people of the Inner Sea, many were happy to hire orc mercenaries to slay their foes. Ulka proved herself over and over, earning renown with Nirmathi irregulars, Druman Blackjackets, Isgeri border patrols, and even Andoren Eagle Knights. Her victories soon preceded her, presenting new opportunities with prestigious mercenary groups and local militaries alike. Money flowed into her pockets, and bright young soldiers flocked to her flag. She sent them into combat to their deaths, and they cheered her for it.</p>
                   <p>Gorum's death brought further riches and ruin. Ulka is in high demand, able to pick and choose her jobs as she likes. She knows she could even ride back into Urgir if she wanted, to be welcomed back with open arms. Yet why should she? Nothing different awaits her there, only more bloody battles as Belkzen fights with Tar-Baphon and traitorous holds of orcs. More and more, Ulka knows the only home for her is among the bones and ashes. The fighting blackens her soul, but to lay down her arms would be cowardice. To refuse to fight for the helpless, to let others be slaughtered like her family, would be immoral. And to find peace, to find a home, is impossible. Nowhere in the world escapes the specter of war. Nowhere in the world is far enough to run.</p>
                   <p>Ulka fights, surviving when others fall, waiting for the day a foe finally strikes true and pierces her heart. She waits for the day she can finally spit her dying breath at Pharasma's feet.</p>

                   <h2>James Beck (any/all)</h2>
                   <p>Hello! My name is James Beck (any/all) and I’m a Paizo freelancer, infinite master on Pathfinder Infinite, co-founder of Eldritch Osiris Games, and all-around a geeky person! I know times are particularly tough around the world, especially for those who identify as LGBTQ+, but queer people have always existed and will always exist. I truly believe in a future where everyone can be who they wish to be. Something that I love about Pathfinder and Starfinder is how diverse the people of the setting are. I can always find someone whom I can identify with, which always fills me with joy. As Jews, we are taught about the value of Tikun Olam, to repair the world. While I might not be able to cast a spell and make everything right in the world, I believe we must all strive for a better tomorrow, where everyone is safe to be who they are. With much love - James Beck</p>

                   <h2>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h2>
                   <p>Hey, you. Yeah, you in the corner thinking about what it means to be queer in 2025. You, thinking about if it's worthwhile to come out. I'm here to say: yes, it is. Living my life openly and unabashedly as a trans person makes it vibrant, joyful, and worth living. I spent too much time in the closet and too long detransitioned to say otherwise. It's beautiful, even if I find myself having to carefully manage my exposure to the news to handle my stress.</p>
                   <p>For those of you who are allies, especially cis allies of trans people: I'm not going to chide you or berate you. I've seen too many people want to be lectured for failing to live up to their values. That's for you to manage. Instead, I want you to celebrate with trans people. Give the flowers to the trans people in your life now. Understand that being part of our joy is part of helping us survive. I don't want anyone to look at my work and think that reading it is like taking a gross medicine to help counter transphobia. It's supposed to be fun!</p>
                   <p>When I sit down and design games for you (yes, you, the person reading this!), I think of it as a gift. I'm trying to make the game work as smoothly as possible for you, with as many delightful surprises as I can fit onto the page, and open up an experience that we share across time and space. I can only tell the stories that I can tell. I hope that it's an invitation to understand a bit more about the world, or to explore something you haven't explored before. Even if you don't know me (especially if you don't know me!), my work is an attempt to say "Hello, let's play a game together." I hope that you have fun.</p>

                   <p>It is so important right now to stand up for who you are and to protect the ones you love, and if that means just standing in the middle between the people that make you feel safe, that’s okay too.</p>
                   <p>I have the fortune to share my life right now with multiple partners. One of them is gay, one of them intersex, and one of them trans (all shared with permission). I don’t see any of them as often as I would like, but I would still stand for each of them if any one of them were feeling threatened.</p>
                   <p>I hope you do too, but I’ll stand for you as well if you don’t have the spoons.</p>

Their plushie collection is vast, from sweaters for their loyal service dog, Avalon, to d20, like from their panel at PaizoCon, to enormous snowflakes and Hatsune Miku! They’re also a huge fan of Pokemon, and, despite never having finished a single game, they’ve played each one released (their favorite pokemon is Gardevoir, by the way)! Maya is also your go-to resource for obscure film and soundtracks, and is happy to geek out about either at any given time!</p>

                   <p>This Pride, I’m proud of a variety of things, but I’ll narrow down to just two. Firstly, I recently celebrated my peoples’ (Indigenous Okinawan &amp; Yaeyaman) cultures by getting hajichi, traditional hand tattoos. They are traditionally women’s tattoos, usually done in stages to mark important milestones toward adulthood. They were also legally banned when Japan colonized our islands. But, as a trans femme and nonbinary person, me getting hajichi isn’t just a celebration of my Indigenous heritages or a rejection of Imperial Japan’s colonizer anti-tattoo laws; it’s also a celebration of my femininity and a visible assertion of my status as a femme Uchinaanchu &amp; Yaimapitu.</p>
                   <p>Secondly, I’m so happy that I’ve been performing in shows as a femme performer. I’m an actor-combatant who regularly acts and fights in large shows at Renaissance Faires. And, a year ago, I switched from playing masculine characters to femme ones. It has been thrilling to show large, cheering crowds who I am.</p>
                   <p>Happy Pride!</p>

                   <h2>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h2>
                   <p>Pride holds more meaning for me this year than it has in years prior, given the circumstances in the US and beyond. As systems work to erase hundreds of years of trans history and queer culture, it falls to us to hold those memories and stories within us. By sharing our stories, playing games, building worlds, and imagining futures where trans joy is a staple, not an exception, we lay the foundation for a better world—not only for those of us here now, but for the queer and trans people who follow after.</p>
                   <p>My great joy on a yearly basis now is running TTRPGs for Trans Rights, an itch.io-based fundraiser that benefits trans-focused charities in hard-hit states (Texas, Florida, West Virginia, and Ohio have all been recipients). As one trans person, there’s only so much financial help I can provide, but with the power of community organizing, we can make huge strides! This year’s fundraiser pulled in over $80,000 for TransOhio and Kaleidoscope Youth Center, putting our organization’s total over the $1 million mark, and giving those organizations a much-needed funding boost to continue their important work. Organizations we’ve supported in the past like Latina Trans Texas and Transinclusive Group (Florida) still make use of the funds raised via our program, or programs and infrastructure built using those funds. From an idea in my living room, we built a grassroots fundraising initiative that is making life-changing amounts of money for queer organizations.</p>
                   <p>Beyond the fundraising, it’s also important for me to show queer and trans people in those hard-hit states that they do have community. People care about you and want to see you thrive, even if you don’t get that kind of support locally. And knowing that there is a world out there that loves you as you are is life-saving.</p>

                   <h2>James Jacobs (he/him)</h2>
                   <p>I’ve never been a big fan of parties or conventions or parades or other big social gatherings, and that includes things like organized protests and the like—I just get really awkward and uncomfortable when I’m around a lot of people. I know I’m not the only one with this little quirk, but for those out there who are leading the charge in more obvious and wide-reaching forms of resistance by spreading love and acceptance, thank you. That said, there’s still lots of ways to use stories of queer love, joy, and celebration to protest against oppression, even if in the grand scheme they’re pretty subtle. LBGTQ+ representation in Paizo’s Adventure Paths is one of the ways I’ve been working to share this joy—it was a very deliberate choice in the very first Pathfinder Adventure Path I wrote, “Burnt Offerings,” to include Jasper Korvaski as a local paladin who also happens to be gay, to put into print in the first volume proof that alignment is irrelevant to the discussion. Since then, we’ve included SO many more stories of queer joy and I’m proud of them all. A lot of them are much higher profile than one relatively minor paladin in a small town on the Lost Coast, but even these small stories are important ways to spread love and acceptance. So… thank you to all the amazing writers and developers and designers and editors and artists and more who’ve helped keep Paizo’s games filled with characters and stories that I’m immensely proud to have been a part of all this time!</p>

                   <p>Lin Codega’s article “Playing Games Amidst the Revolution” echoes in the back of my mind a lot these days. I’m a fifty-something queer, chronically ill, invisibly disabled, autistic femme; everything is just so much, the weight of the world so heavy, that some days, simply getting out of bed is a victory. Joy does not come easily.</p>
                   <p>But queer joy <em>matters</em>. It’s how we survive. So I seek joy, do my best to cultivate it, and try to help spread it wherever I can. Games are part of how I do that. My most recent game (which I proudly included in the recent TTRPGs for Trans Rights bundle on itch.io) takes its inspiration from queer history—the tea dance, a non-alcoholic, queer event when same-gender dancing was illegal at venues selling alcohol. The tea dance was defiance wrapped in community and joy.</p>
                   <p>Dan Savage, reflecting on the worst days of the AIDS crisis, talked about going from burying friends in the morning, to protesting in the afternoon, and then out dancing at night. “The dance kept us in the fight because it was the dance we were fighting for,” he explained. “It didn’t look like we were going to win then and we did. It doesn’t feel like we’re going to win now but we could. Keep fighting, keep dancing.”</p>
                   <p>I would add: <em>keep playing</em>. Tell your stories, imagine better worlds, laugh with your friends around the gaming table—and know that you’re not alone.</p>

                   <p>We get married in 2014, before it’s federally legal. We arrive back in Texas, wearing wedding rings and calling each other wife. We lose our few state benefits due to discrimination.</p>
                   <p>We transition in 2016. We look funny, we dress funny, we don’t fit the gender norms. We’re yelled at on the sidewalk outside of the one GAC clinic in Texas.</p>
                   <p>We don’t care. Queer love tastes like fries and carbonation and sea spray. Queer strength feels like freedom and shoulders back and arms that hold and love you forever.</p>

                   <p>Hello, all! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, queer writer and frequent contributor to Paizo. Some of my recent work includes the Cobyslarni section in <em>Pathfinder Rival Academies</em>, <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #209: Destroyer’s Doom</em>, and the Verces section and space pirate archetype from Starfinder Second Edition’s first published book, <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em>!</p>
                   <p>Over the years, RPGs have helped me explore my own identity, and being a part of the queer Paizo community has been a big part of that. With every casual reference to a queer relationship in an adventure, every trans NPC, and every post of the “make it gayer” meme in a Paizo project server, I’m reminded that there a lot of us out there, and we’re not going anywhere. If someone picks up a book with a queer character I made and feels that sense of recognition or belonging, I’ll be proud of that. Pride is a riot—and we’ll need that spirit now more than ever—but Pride is also a party, because who we are is worth celebrating.</p>

                   <h2>Alex Speidel (he/him)</h2>
                   <p>This is not a hypothetical story.</p>
                   <p>There is a game store. It’s on the outskirts of a midsize city. It’s the passion project of its owner, and it’s probably just barely staying afloat, but that’s not what we’re focused on right now.</p>
                   <p>The game store is small, cluttered, does a roaring trade in trading cards, but one night a week, it hosts roleplaying games. Like most game stores, its clientele skews toward cis white dudes. But gaming is for everybody, and the player base has expanded.</p>
                   <p>The thing is, this game store, this midsize city? Politically, they are not in a great place for people who are not cis white dudes. Conservative, in whatever flavor fits the locale. And so you’d think there wouldn’t be any queer people there, because why would there be?</p>
                   <p>But you’d be wrong. Because we’re everywhere. We’re in that town. We’re in that store. And most of the time, you wouldn’t even know we’re there.</p>
                   <p>But every once in a while, you would. Because a Pathfinder scenario asks you to help an NPC get their hands on a <em>serum of sex shift</em>. Or a Starfinder scenario casually has no binary NPCs and a whole host of agender and nonbinary characters using neopronouns. And that queer person? That kid, that teen, that adult who’s just figuring themselves out? They light up. They feel seen, they feel understood, they feel <em>joy</em>, for just a few minutes.</p>
                   <p>This is a story I’ve heard dozens of times. Every time I do, it stokes the flame in my heart just a little bit, and reminds me why I do this.</p>
                   <p>Because I know, every time I hear this story, that the worst people in the world are absolutely frothing mad about it. They are so incensed at the idea of queer joy that they will whip themselves into a frenzy, destroy their lives and livelihoods in a futile effort to snuff out that joy, go roaring into the dustbin of history with nothing to show for it.</p>
                   <p>And we’ll just laugh and keep on. Because if the worst people in the world are mad at you, I think you’re doing just fine.</p>
                   <br>

                   <p>Hello, Starfinders!<br>
                     Here we are. This is it. The time has come. The end is nigh.</p>
                   <p>This month marks the release of the final Starfinder Society Scenario for Starfinder First Edition. In a few short months, we’ll be celebrating the launch of Starfinder Society Second Edition, but for now, let’s focus on the end.</p>
                   <p>When it came time to plan the finale for Starfinder Society, there’s nothing I wanted more than to go back to the beginning, with Scoured Stars. And who better to take us there than Thurston Hillman, fan-favorite author, mastermind behind the Scoured Stars, father of the Starfinder Society itself, and the very first person to hire me as a freelance author, giving me the chance to write for the Starfinder Society. Funny how the tables have turned. Today, Thurston’s our Associate Publisher here at Paizo, but I’ve lured him back into the freelancer seat to pen this final adventure.</p>
                   <p>Thurston’s written an exciting, challenging adventure for high level characters that’s both a retrospective on the Starfinder Society and a capstone adventure to bring your favorite Starfinder’s story to a close. This adventure has the potential to permanently end your adventuring career, even if you survive. You have been warned.</p>
                   <p>So, buckle up. Former First Seeker Jadnura is waiting for you to join him on his starship, the <em>Perfect Silence</em>, in the Scoured Stars. Don’t keep him waiting.</p>

                   <p>It’s been an honor, Starfinders<br>
                     I’ll see you in the future.</p>

                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders!<br>
                     Throughout this year, Absalom has been in an absolute frenzy over Lady Hesla Embersplitter, but with her recent actions in Sarkoris, the Pathfinder Society has more incentive than ever to get to the bottom of her seemingly nefarious plans. While our beloved Venture-Gossip is missing and held for ransom, she was able to have something smuggled to Zarta Dralneen: a shipping manifest signed by the Lady Embersplitter, and from the vague details remaining on the note, it seems that she ordered something… <em>enormous</em>.</p>

                   <p>Meanwhile, the hunt for warshards, the pieces of the dead god Gorum fallen to Golarion, has really heated up. Nations and large organizations alike (the Pathfinder Society included) have been gathering up whatever they can wherever they can. Of course, the Society has devised a way to find certain warshards, and that ritual has led them to a location within the Inner Sea, off the coast of Cheliax.</p>

                   <p>You’ll be part of the expedition of veteran Pathfinders assembled to recover the warshard, but nothing can ever be easy when the Pathfinders are involved. The tracking ritual is leading you straight to a secret Chelaxian weapons laboratory. The site's defenses trap your ship, and while the other members of the expedition hold off the Chelaxian forces, it’ll be up to you and your companions to infiltrate the laboratory to discover what the Chelaxians are fighting so desperately to keep secret, and why exactly the warshard-finding ritual is leading the PCs here.</p>

                   <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them)</h3>
                   <p>안녕, 여러분! I’m going to take this chance to celebrate my mother. While not a leader in any professionally acknowledged way, she’s always encouraged me to approach life unflinchingly and fight for what I stand for. My mother has professionally translated accounts of Korean comfort women, teaches immigrants how to speak English, and, in her youth, was one of many students fighting for the democratization of South Korea. Even now, she’s working on a Ph.D. in linguistics (her second, if you want to know the shoes I’m expected to fill) on the development of DEI language over the past ten years— and she’s told me if the administration attempts to clothesline her work anymore than it has already, she’ll drop the degree immediately.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>I like to joke that, unlike other Korean American kids, I don’t have a mom who wants me to be a doctor or a lawyer. Instead, I have one who pushed me to understand the weight my words carry and who even now encourages me to focus on writing— which is why I get to write for this blog post to begin with! Thanks, 엄마. I’m doing my best to make you proud.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Hiromi Cota (they/she)</h3>
                   <p>This year for AANHPI Month, I have a pair of things I’d like to highlight, and one’s not even a game! I recently celebrated my peoples’ (Okinawan &amp; Yaeyaman) parallel cultures by getting tattoos! In the Ryukyuan cultures, women get hand tattoos to mark milestones towards adulthood, and men get forearm tattoos. As a non-binary &amp; femme person, I got my right hand tattooed with a mix of Okinawan and Yaeyaman styles to celebrate both parts of my Indigenous Islander heritage.</p>
                   <p>The other thing I want to highlight is Tian Xia+, a third-party expansion to the Tian Xia World &amp; Character Guides by Team+. Most of the people working on the book were people of Asian descent—some of the same folks who worked on the official Tian Xia books, in fact. I gave the sai some love, as it’s a traditional Okinawan weapon that’s near and dear to my heart. You can find this sai goodness under the Three-Finger Fist archetype. I also worked on the Minatan Warrior archetype, which was heavily based on Filipino Martial Arts, and the expansion of the Tsukumogami Poppets, because I love those little guys, too!</p>
                   <p>Happy AANHPI Month!</p>

                   <p>content warning: death</p>
                   <p>Hi everyone! I'm Matthew, a Chinese American chemist by day and freelance writer and GM by night. I don't have anything else to promote since the release of NPC Core, but I wanted to take a moment to celebrate and reflect on the lessons that my Po Po (grandmother) instilled upon me. She recently passed, and I have her to thank for who am I as a person. She was generous, kind, and patient, and she showed her love through example, always putting her family before herself.</p>
                   <p>I've always struggled with coming to terms with my heritage, but she always presented Chinese culture in a welcoming and inclusive manner, never pressuring me to accept it if I didn't want to. It's something that I am still at odds with even to this day, but I am eternally grateful for her exposing me to many wonderful customs that I might have disregarded elsewise. Regardless of what I make of it, I can rest easy knowing that her love will always stay with me.</p>
                   <p>Thank you for letting me share my story.</p>

                   <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Hi! I’m John, a multi-ethnic Filipino American gamer, gamemaster, freelancer, and podcaster. I spent my early childhood in Hawai'i and the Philippines and later sailed the seven seas as I started my career.</p>
                   <p>Over the past 5 years, I have written 20 freelance TTRPG projects, including several scheduled for release later this year! I’ve worked mostly for Paizo, but also for Legendary Games, Evil Genius Games, and Evil Robot Games. I produce two podcasts on the Know Direction Network: <a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/digital-divination/">Digital Divination</a>, with Paizo Senior Designer Jason Keeley and D&amp;D Designer Ron Lundeen, and <a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/">Intrepid Heroes</a>, an RPG actual play where we play mostly Starfinder adventures (currently <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq047uk?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday">A Cosmic Birthday</a>). Previously, I produced <a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/presenting/">Presenting - Gamers Making Games</a>, where I interviewed over 100 game designers, developers, artists, and editors about their journey into the industry. I’m presenting a summary of these interviews at <a href="https://www.gencon.com/events/272066">Gen Con</a> this year. In my non-gaming life, I do university research and teaching on entrepreneurship and social enterprise. This summer, I am researching the effects of TTRPGs—feel free to reach out if you are interested in helping!</p>

                   <p>I can’t express the joy and excitement I felt upon realizing that Yoon had a Korean name, and that her heritage was, in fact, my own. Being Korean as a kid was frustrating—I’d always be asked if I was Chinese and where Korea was, anyway. (The 90s were tough.) But things have changed. K-pop, Korean dramas, and barbecue have shaken things up, and I hope to do the same with RPGs. Not just for myself, but for everyone who’s felt a little on the wayside. All my love to everyone who’s had to explain where their country is or answer ignorant questions about their heritage. You matter, and we’re with you.</p>

                   <h2>Demiplane x Roll20 Integration</h2>
                   <p>In case you missed it, we announced at the top of this year that we would launch several Roll20 x Demiplane Integration phases.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><a href="https://www.demiplane.com/blog/demiplane-roll20-integration-update---cross-platform-sync-launches-today-more">The Alpha Release</a> allowed us to pull <em>Starfinder </em>Character Sheets from Demiplane into the Roll20 VTT. Additionally, Paizo was kind enough to unlock <strong>Cross-Platform Sync,</strong> which means if you unlock some game material on Demiplane that also exists on Roll20, you unlock it in both places for no additional cost (and vice versa).&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><a href="https://www.demiplane.com/blog/roll20-x-demiplane-beta-now-available">Our Beta Release</a> followed quickly last month, allowing all Demiplane Character Sheets to be pulled into the Roll20 VTT for a dynamic all-in-one experience.</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Connected Play, Realized: </strong>For the first time, your Demiplane characters aren’t locked in the Demiplane platform. These characters can now exist on Demiplane and Roll20 – all ready to roll! No exporting or rebuilding.<a href="https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/30156598786327-Demiplane-and-Roll20-Account-Integration-Benefits"> Link your account</a> and you’re in!</li>
                    <li><strong>Breaking Down Barriers for More Adventures</strong>:<a href="https://blog.roll20.net/posts/demiplane-roll20-integration-launch/"> We introduced the Cross-Platform Sync and Shared Subscription benefits</a> because we believe players should be able to dive into the fun part without any hassle. These two benefits have been live since February, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. No more jumping through hoops – just more gaming, everywhere, all at once!</li>
                    <li><strong>Built for Every Table: </strong>Whether you prefer in-person games using Demiplane, virtual games on Roll20’s virtual tabletop, or a mix of both, today’s release has been designed to seamlessly fit into any existing game. We already have a campaign in the works, but if you want to try one of the new sheets, it's just a matter of connecting or creating a Demiplane account and<a href="https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/30156598786327-Demiplane-and-Roll20-Account-Integration-Benefits"> linking your characters</a> alongside existing character sheets.</li>
                    <li><strong>A Strong Foundation for What’s Next: </strong>This Public Beta isn’t the end – it’s just the beginning. We're thrilled about the opportunity to bring characters to where you play. We’re excited about the potential of combining Demiplane’s ability to onboard new game systems, rapidly implement and support new game mechanics, and launch new character sheet capabilities. The future is bright, and we can't wait to share it with you.</li>

                   <h3>A New Pathfinder Experience</h3>
                   <p>This integration is beneficial to all players, but especially, right now, to <em>Pathfinder Second Edition </em>players. <em>Pathfinder </em>is one of the most popular systems on either platform. Because of this, we wanted to ensure that you have a seamless, elevated experience that gets out of the way and lets you (and your GM) focus on what makes your games epic.&nbsp;</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Character Tools: </strong>Demiplane offers the most comprehensive, accessible character creation experience, whether you play online or in-person. With cross-linked digital companions, tooltips, and an accessible search, the <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/sources"><strong>Pathfinder NEXUS</strong></a> gives you everything you need. Create your heroes from the ground up, with brilliant, beautiful, intuitive character tools.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Most Up-to-Date: </strong>Demiplane’s patches and releases usually happen on the same day Paizo releases new content, or very soon after, meaning players can always access the newest mechanics, lore, and errata. There's no waiting for releases or information!</li>
                    <li><strong>Expansive Library: </strong>The digital <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/sources"><em>Pathfinder Second Edition </em>library on Demiplane</a> is second to none, and it includes not only rulebooks and sourcebooks, but also the latest adventure paths!&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Platform Sync:</strong> No more purchasing content at full price in multiple locations, and no more switching back and forth. Thanks to Cross-Platform Sync, you can unlock your content once and enjoy it on both Roll20 and Demiplane. It's an integrated experience designed to make your gaming life easier.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Connected to Roll20 VTT: </strong>With the power of the Demiplane Character Tools for <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/sources"><strong>Pathfinder NEXUS</strong></a> and <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/starfinder2e"><strong>Starfinder NEXUS</strong></a><strong>,</strong> plus Roll20's recent upgrades like <a href="https://blog.roll20.net/posts/jumpgate-update-upload-animations-with-ease/">Jumpgate</a> and <a href="https://blog.roll20.net/posts/roll20-foreground-layer/">Foreground Layer</a>, we are thrilled to have you experience this effortless adventure.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Features and In-Sheet Purchases: </strong>We recently implemented<a href="https://www.demiplane.com/blog/you-meet-the-prerequisite-for-these-patch-notes-15">feat pre-requisities, variant rules support</a>, and equipment purchasing. Our incredible dev David has given you the ability to purchase new items and content directly from the sheet in your <em>Pathfinder </em>and <em>Starfinder </em>games! From the item sidebar, click “buy with coin” to enable the option.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>These updates and features are just the beginning. Our Demiplane development team works tirelessly to bring you more all the time, including exciting GM Tools.&nbsp;</p>

                   <h1>GM Recognition</h1>
                   <h2>GM Ranks</h2>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had one GM reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Nova (SFS1)</strong>: James Anderson</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1>Conventions</h1>
                   <p>Summer, and convention season, approach with great haste! Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Conventions calendar</a> for upcoming events in your area.</p>
                   <p>The day after PaizoCon I’ll be hopping on a plane to Birmingham for <strong>UK Games Expo</strong>; if you’re across the pond, I’d love to see you there! Looking for a Paizo staff visit this fall? Drop me an email and let me know about your event; my contemplative gunslinger just might stop by!</p>

                   <p>This year, we’re starting in space with the launch of <strong>Starfinder Society Second Edition</strong>! Alongside our four initial scenarios, we’re releasing a special, double-length adventure that serves as a prequel to our Invasion’s Edge storyline.</p>
                   <p>Emerging suddenly from deep space, a vessel traveling at speeds that should have cracked the planet in half slowed just enough to crash into the Sloughscar Hills of Akiton. You, lucky adventurers, are members of a team of local Akitonian mercenaries and the first to investigate the collision site, explore the alien starship, and plunder its secrets.</p>
                   <p><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Collision’s Wake</em> is a 4-5 hour long scenario for 3rd-level pregenerated characters written by John Godek III. Join us at Gen Con to play this adventure concurrently with other tables and experience the launch of Starfinder Society Second Edition! After Gen Con, purchase this adventure and run it yourself!</p>

                   <h2>Pathfinder Society</h2>
                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders!</p>
                   <p>Debuting at Gen Con 2025, <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-99: Under the Eye of the Mantis</em> is an interactive special for 1st- through 8th-level characters written by Joseph Blomquist and Michael Bramnik.</p>
                   <p>While adventuring in Sarkoris, Pathfinder Agent Khione Thidos went missing, and a strange ransom note that detailed that she’d been taken by the Red Mantis assassins was sent to the Grand Lodge via a unionized printing press. The request for money and the misspelling of the name of the Mantis’s own god was unusual, though, to say the least. Just as Society leadership was preparing a missive to the mysterious guild, however, a member of the Vernai appeared in Ambrus Valsin’s office demanding to speak with Zarta Dralneen and Eando Kline about a favor they didn’t know they owed her.</p>

                   <p>The Pathfinders quickly learned of a strange shipping company based on an island off the coast of Mediogalti Island known as the Red Mantis Dispatch. This organization is run by two extremely secretive leaders, Sotroz and Rowan the Whispering, who have recently started accepting assassination contracts, including on targets the Red Mantis assassins have previously turned down.</p>
                   <p>Talk about killer competition, Pathfinders!</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Finally, we have something entirely new that we’ve never done before!</p>
                   <p>With the release of Battlecry!, we’ll have official skirmish rules for leading armies, and how better to showcase those rules than by letting you take command of the vanguard in the war to come?</p>
                   <p>The Order of the Rack Hellknights have taken over the town of Breachill, in Isger (a town you may remember from the very first Second Edition Adventure Path, Age of Ashes), and are executing citizens to root out what they believe are dissidents hoarding warshards, powerful pieces of the dead god Gorum. The population is terrified. When the Hellknights kill an Andoren citizen attempting to find out what the Hellknights are up to, the country decides to put a stop to these tyrants.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>You will control an Andoren army attempting to free Breachill and retake Citadel Altaerein. The Hellknights have an army of their own, though, and have even called forth a diabolic dragon after conducting some infernal rituals. It won't be an easy fight, but the Andoren forces you’ll be controlling are certainly up to the task!</p>

                   <p>The Battle of Hellknight Hill is an adventure for 5th-level pregenerated troops, designed to run for 1 hour and really showcase what these rules can do. At Gen Con, we’ll have real battle terrain to showcase these fights. It’ll be amazing and unlike anything we’ve done before. I really hope people have a blast with it.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">This encounter takes place on a planet deep in the Vast that’s currently occupied by Azlanti Star Empire forces. Talk to your players about why their characters are there. They might be rebel forces infiltrating or attacking an imperial base, prisoners of war escaping a holding facility, spies sabotaging an imperial operation, or deserters who have decided to strike back against their former empire. Playing these roles isn’t required, but might inspire some fun table banter.</p>
                   <p>The forces occupying this world are Sihedron guards: faceless troopers encased in sleek purple armor who serve their fascist empire without question, cruelly subjugating the peoples of the star systems they conquer. They can’t be negotiated with, and they always shoot first. The Sihedron guards fight to the death to defend their twisted ideology and maintain what they incorrectly believe is their natural superiority.</p>
                   <p>This encounter occurs after a lull in the battle. The PCs know that a Sihedron squad is converging on their position. Prompt the PCs to get into position and set up for battle, then have everyone roll initiative, choosing skills based on how their characters approach preparing for combat.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>Map:</strong> Use the urban side of <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Enormous Battlefield </em>for this encounter.</p>
                   <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> An elite Sihedron commander leads a squad of 8 Sihedron guards into the fray. Starting positions for this battle can be anywhere, but enemies should begin the encounter at least 100 feet away from the PCs. When combat begins, the commander Leads the Charge, ordering a group of Sihedron guards (one per player at your table) to advance. The other Sihedron guards hang back and attack from a distance, repositioning after the frontliners fall with the help of their commander’s Rally the Troops ability.</p>
                   <p><strong>Adjustments:</strong> If you have six or more players at your table, you’ll likely want to add at least two more Sihedron guards to this encounter. These reinforcements begin by hanging back and sniping from a distance. If the party takes out the other targets too quickly, the backup snipers advance into range of the PCs’ abilities. Another squad of Sihedron guards (using the same statistics) patrol the base. If all the players are having fun and want to keep playing, they can ambush the patrol by succeeding at Stealth checks against the squad leader’s Perception modifier (+16), or alternatively, the patrol ambushes the PCs as they’re trying to carry out their mission!</p>
                   <p><strong>Design Notes:</strong> This encounter is intended to test out the tech playtest classes while providing an open map where ranged attacks, distant spells, turrets, and mines can shine. The encounter provides plentiful enemies to give characters a chance to try out using area attacks and spells against a group. Please let us know in the comments or forums how this encounter played out for your group!</p>

Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a&nbsp;manipulate&nbsp;action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.<br><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet <br><strong>Melee</strong> [one-action] dueling sword +18 (analog, versatile P), <strong>Damage</strong> 2d8+7 slashing <br><strong>Ranged</strong> [one-action] boom pistol +16 (boost 1, expend 2, mag 20, range increment 40 feet, reload 1, tech), <strong>Damage</strong> 2d6+3 sonic <br><strong>Terrifying Takedown</strong> [free-action] (emotion, fear, mental) <strong>Trigger</strong> The commander reduces an enemy to 0 Hit Points or critically hits an enemy with a Strike; <strong>Effect</strong> The commander makes a gruesome spectacle of their brutal hit.

All Sihedron guard allies within 120 feet of the commander can use a reaction to Stride up to their Speed. Any Sihedron guards who end their movement adjacent to another Sihedron guard gain 5 temporary Hit Points that last 1 minute, or double that number of temporary Hit Points if they end their movement adjacent to the commander. The commander can’t Rally the Troops again for 1d4 rounds. <br><strong>Tactical Strike</strong> [one-action] (auditory, mental) <strong>Frequency</strong> once per round; <strong>Effect</strong> The commander calls out an enemy within 60 feet then makes a Strike against that enemy, dealing an additional 1d6 precision damage on a hit. If the hit is successful, the commander changes the tide of the battle, inspiring their allies to greater feats of military prowess. All sihedron guards within 60 feet of the commander gain a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls until the beginning of the commander’s next turn.</p>

                     Creative Manager</strong></h3>
                   <p>Hi! I’m Jenny, Starfinder’s Creative Manager, which means I’m the captain of this starship. I’m one part creative director, leading the creative vision for Starfinder as a game and brand; one part manager, coordinating the efforts of the badass crew of designers and developers who call ourselves the StarFriends; and one part developer, concepting, creating, outlining, and writing content for Starfinder, plus upgrading work done by talented freelance contributors.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>I’ve written a ton of adventures for various tabletop games over the years, and I’ve contributed to many Paizo books, but we’re not here to tally my credits. I’m really proud of my latest long-form adventures, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq047uk?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday">A Cosmic Birthday</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq09jzk">Murder in Metal City</a>, and I can’t wait for you to get a taste of my (our!) setting work in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0aipb?Starfinder-Galaxy-Guide">Galaxy Guide</a>. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:jenny.jarzabski@paizo.com">jenny.jarzabski@paizo.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>But now it’s time to introduce you to the fantastic team helping me bring the galaxy of Desna’s Path to life.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3><strong>Jessica Catalan<br>
                     Senior Developer</strong></h3>
                   <p>Hello everyone! I’m Jessica Catalan (she/her), senior developer on the Starfinder Team and head of the Starfinder Society. This month we’re releasing the final Starfinder Society Scenario for first edition, and in a few short months, we’re launching a brand-new program for Starfinder Society second edition! I hope you join us as we bring first edition to a close and embark on this exciting new adventure into the future!</p>
                   <p>In addition to working at Paizo full time, I’m a frequent freelance author for the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs, with over 50 writing credits for Paizo, and many more for other companies and games.</p>
                   <p>I’m Metis and I live in wonderful Winnipeg, Canada. I spend my free time with my family: my husband, daughter, son, and pet rabbit. I love to play TTRPGs, TCGs, and board games, collect far too many sets of dice, and read. (Yes, of course I’ll read all those books on the shelf one day, and yes, I definitely need more…).</p>
                   <p>You can find me on most social media and Discords as d20diaries. If you’re interested in writing a Starfinder Society Scenario, reach out to me at jessica.catalan@paizo.com.</p>
                   <p>All the best, folks! Take care of each other out there.</p>

                     Senior Developer</strong></h3>
                   <p>Hello! I’m Mike Kimmel (he/him), Senior Developer for Starfinder Second Edition. You may recognize me from my prior work as an Organized Play Line Developer for Pathfinder Society, from my freelance contributions to Pathfinder and Starfinder, or as the founder of the Freelance Forge forum community. I’m a proud father, former educator, and author of many adventures. Since joining the Starfinder team in 2023, I’ve been hard at work on our core rulebooks, creating playtest adventures, items, classes, spells, new rules, lots of aliens, and all the other things a science-fantasy game might need. I’ve also taken the lead on some exciting adventure content that we’ve got planned for the new edition. I’m sure you’re already looking forward to the release of our premium box set module, Murder in Metal City, as well as our Free RPG Day adventure, Battle for Nova Rush—I know I am. If possible, I’m even more excited about the other adventures I’m working on, but I’m not allowed to say much on that front yet. We’ll have to keep it a secret… for now.</p>

                   <h3><strong>Dustin Knight <br>
                     Designer</strong></h3>
                   <p><br>
                    Greetings Starfinders! I’m Dustin Knight, Starfinder designer! I’ve always wanted to be a tabletop game designer, so being able to announce that I’m now officially one is literally a dream come true! That said, in the process of becoming one I’ve learned the only real requisite is designing a game, so I do fervently implore anyone reading this who wants to pursue the same career path to start writing now! Wait, let’s read the rest of the blog first! Then make some tea. Then go write.</p>
                   <p>My career really took off with Organized Play. You may have played my first game, <em>Wayfinder Origins</em>, a repeatable scenario that opens with a boat. Or <em>Sundered Waves</em>, a repeatable scenario that opens with a boat. I’m still writing the occasional adventure, like <em>Wheel of Monsters</em>, a repeatable scenario that opens with a boat. But my specialty and focus lie in player-facing mechanics like ancestries, backgrounds, and classes. I love the back and forth conversation between mechanics and lore in a class and level driven game that both inspires and develops multifaceted characters and adventures to create these immersive moments between friends where we play out these fantastic stories. Please feel free to tell me about your characters and the incredible moments, because those memories are worth more than anything I can graph out in excel.<br><br>
                    Outside of work I’m often described as exactly the kind of nerd you’d expect with my job title. I spend my free time sorting tens of thousands of Magic cards into grossly organized binders. I play TCGs online using official apps and Discord. I watch at least five or six new anime a season, on top of trying to tackle my ever-growing watch list. And I love to cook, with my favorite dish still being okonomiyaki. My world travels and conventions have been on hiatus for the past five years, but I’m looking forward to hanging out virtually with everyone during PaizoCon and Gen Con. I’m in an ongoing Starfinder campaign and working to restart my personal Pathfinder campaign. And realizing with each sentence I’m inching closer and closer to talking about Paizo again!</p>
                   <p>You can catch me on any number of social media platforms as Dustin Knight or kitsunewarlock, including Discord and Bluesky. You can also email me at <a href="mailto:dustin.knight@paizo.com">dustin.knight@paizo.com</a>. Thank you all for continuing to play our game, and I wish you all love and peace.</p>
                   <p>And last but not least, allow me to introduce our newest StarFriend!</p>

                   <h3>Aras Yazgan (he/him)<br>
                    Designer</h3>
                   <p>Hello everyone! I’m Aras Yazgan, a Turkish-American game designer by vocation, computer engineer by training, artist by dedication, and forever GM by choice. Gosh, there’s an awful lot of you reading this, huh…? I think I might have page fright! I haven’t had the chance to publish much of anything thus far, but I’ve been working on little else other than TTRPG design for the last two years. My training arc is over and I’m ready to show off the results!</p>
                   <p>It’s difficult to express how excited I am to be working with the incredible Starfinder team. We’ve got some tantalizing projects in the pipeline that I can’t wait to get my mitts on…!</p>
                   <p>You can find my art on Cara @Sketching101. You can reach me at aras.yazgan@paizo.com!</p>
                   <p>From all of us, thanks again for playing Starfinder. We can’t wait to hear about all your adventures in spaaaaaaaaace!</p>

                   <p>On <strong>May 18th</strong>, Mox Bellevue will welcome teams of Seattle-area nerds for a day of friendly competition for a good cause. Funds raised will be going towards the Gamers Engaged <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.org/play-it-forward-fund">Play-it-Forward fund</a>, a low-barrier grant program for nonprofits. We have a treat cooked up for you this year, with the theme of “Feast!” celebrating all things food.</p>

                   <p>On tournament day, we’ll be playing two games that we’ve been allowed to practice, along with a trivia round and a thematic mystery finale which is usually concocted by local game designers. The two announced games this year are <em>Diced Veggies</em> and <em>Sweet Mess Pastry Competition</em>. The former is a snappy game of strategically wielding your cleaver to chop off vegetable dice from the bunch to prepare your recipe cards. <em>Sweet Mess Pastry</em><em>Competition</em> is a bit longer and crunchier, with elements of open drafting and set collection as you try to prepare recipes first to win awards for your top-shelf creations.</p>
                   <p>So, how can you participate? I’m glad you asked! There are multiple ways to join in the Feast. Firstly, you can donate now, either to <a href="https://tiltify.com/+paizo/gauntlet-2025">Team Paizo</a> as a whole or to a <a href="https://tiltify.com/+paizo/gauntlet-2025/campaigns">group member’s individual fundraising campaign</a>. Donations are open through the day of the tournament, and besides going toward the nonprofit grants, they also help our team gain power-ups which we can use for boosts during the games.</p>
                   <p>You can also show your support by watching the tournament! If you’re in the Bellevue area, you can stop by Mox from 11am–7pm to cheer us on. Folks who shop in-store on tournament day and donate to Gamers Engaged at the register will get a 25% coupon as well. If you can’t make it in person, the best way to watch the tournament is online. Streaming will be hosted by BoardGameGeekTV on gauntletofgames.org throughout the entire event.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>We can’t wait to mix it up with the rest of the teams on tournament day and we are incredibly grateful to our generous gaming community for every crumb of support we receive along the way.</p>
                   <p>See you at the tourney!</p>

Each major faction includes a new archetype players can use to create a character with ties to that faction. The galactic tour ends with a database of playable alien ancestries including a telepathic mega-brain with an atrophied body (contemplative), a friendly shapeshifter with a secretly bizarre true form (astrazoan), and more!</p>

                   <p>Delving deeper into the prison, the PCs make their way through ruined cell blocks before finding themselves in what appears to be an idyllic village. The clueless villagers are being preyed upon by their vampire masters, and the PCs need to break the spell and ascend into the Broken Palace to remove the threat of Lady Nalushae once and for all. The Shades of Blood Adventure Path continues with “The Broken Palace,” a complete adventure for 4th- through 6th-level characters.</p>

                   <p>Gods are not meant to die. They’re supposed to be immortal, too powerful to be struck down or wither to dust like the people of Golarion. It has been more than a century since Aroden, god of humanity, met his mysterious doom, and his death ushered in a new era of uncertain prophecy and turmoil—the Age of Lost Omens. Now another god has died, his death broadcast across the skies in a metaphysical projection of his murder, reverberating over any world on which he was worshipped. And from his rent corpse falls the Godsrain, a torrent of the god’s blood and divine essence. Those touched by this rain are blessed—some would say cursed—with a god-spark that imbues them with mythic power.</p>

                   <p>Explore the husks of abandoned starships in <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Derelict Starships</em>. One side of this mat recreates a classic starship used by intrepid adventurers across the cosmos, only long after they’ve been forced to abandon it. You can even use this side as a battle-damaged version of the classic starship featured on <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Starship: Sunrise Maiden</em>. The other side of the mat shows the shorn-off section of a larger warship, where active battles could still be taking place! Both sides work as the setting for a full session of exploration in the depths of space.</p>

                   <p>The Pathfinders travel to the demon-torn Sarkoris Scar in search of more information about Hesla Embersplitter, who's been rumored to have connections to a cult in the area known as the Cult of the Screaming Grub. The agents in the area will need to explore the desolate wasteland to find Deskari's Gullet, a cave system filled with strange connections to other planes. It's there that the Pathfinders will find Hesla's treasure and maybe catch a hint of her ultimate goal, while frosty eyes watch them from afar, counting on their success.</p>

                   <p>Last year, Pathfinders found teleportation circles within Kaer Maga. They've learned the Azlanti wizard Lesolethe created these long ago. She had uncovered a structure older than even Kaer Maga, but abruptly left without warning, magically sealing it all.</p>
                   <p>The up-and-coming agent, self-proclaimed Runelord Zinthyra Tannol, a sprite obsessed with all things Azlanti and Thassilonian, has discovered the key to this lost structure—or at least where to find it.</p>
                   <p>The Decemvirate will promote her to venture-captain if she can successfully direct this mission. Captain Eras will evaluate her. They sail towards Lesolethe’s main lab, hidden in shattered Azlant. If the PCs can find the key, it will grant access to an incredibly ancient site, and the newest venture-captain will owe them big time.</p>

                   <p>Eight years ago, famed junk racer Ratrod was beaten on his own track by agents of the Starfinder Society, tarnishing his reputation and leading to a years-long losing slump. Now, Ratrod’s back and determined to get revenge—by winning a junkrace against everyone he lost against! It’s time to customize your junk racer, buckle up, and show racing fans everywhere that the Starfinder Society still has what it takes to win!</p>
                   <p>When it becomes clear someone's out to get the competition, it's up to you to determine who's to blame! A racer determined to win at all costs? An obsessed fan? Or is Ratrod's revenge a little deadlier than expected?</p>

                   <p>During the Year of Unfettered Exploration, the reappearance of the Planes of Metal and Wood destabilized the Maze of the Open Road, the extradimensional maze the Pathfinder Society uses to transport personnel and goods across vast distances. In trying to stabilize itself, new entrances and exits appeared, one in a Tanuki village in Minkai. The tanuki had some fun pranking travelers in the maze until some Pathfinder agents defeated them at their own games. Now the village is on good terms with the Society, but the Pathfinders would like to have a lodge in the village to oversee this new exit. The tanuki are amenable, but only if the Pathfinders do some favors for them first. Of course, the PCs are the ones tasked with these favors.</p>

                   <p>Emerging suddenly from deep space, a vessel traveling at speeds that should have cracked a planet in half slowed long enough to crash into the Sloughscar Hills of Akiton. Curious explorers and opportunistic salvagers descended upon the wreck, among which was a mercenary team in the employ of the Starfinder Society. Within hours, the starship’s automated defenses activated, driving the explorers out and unleashing dangerous monsters and magical effects into the region, including the dreaded illumantula, a terrifying monster of magic, technology, and light. This starship was soon dubbed the Wreck of the Returned.</p>
                   <p>Believing the Wreck of the Returned has a connection to the mysterious First Ones and is but the first step in a devastating invasion of the Pact Worlds, First Seeker Sarmak works to establish a Starfinder lodge in the surrounding Sloughscar Hills. Now, Sarmak has put out a call for brave Starfinders willing to help establish and defend this fledgling lodge and explore the Wreck of the Returned.</p>

                   <p>Starfinder Society Second Edition launches at GenCon 2025 (July 31–August 3) with the release of a special launch adventure and four Starfinder Society Scenarios.</p>
                   <h2>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Collision’s Wake</h2>
                   <p>Our story begins with <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Collision’s Wake</em>, a special double length scenario for 3rd-level pregenerated characters written by John Godek III. This adventure is a prequel to Invasion’s Edge and casts you in the role of a team of Akitonian mercenaries hired by the Starfinder Society to keep a wary eye out for any strange occurrences or signs of alien invasion. When a strange starship crashes into the nearby Sloughscar Hills, you’re among the very first on the scene to investigate the wreck.

                   <h2>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-01: Invasion’s Edge</h2>
                   <p><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-01: Invasion’s Edge</em> is the first adventure in the Invasion’s Edge metaplot! A new Starfinder lodge is being built in the Sloughscar Hills and you’re among the first Starfinders on site. As rookie Starfinders, you’ll lend a hand in establishing the lodge then head out into the wilderness to examine a piece of nearby debris. This intro adventure is written by Michael Bramnik and is designed for 1st- and 2nd-level characters.</p>
                   <h2>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-02: Mystery of the Frozen Moon</h2>
                   <p>Every year, the Starfinder Society learns of thousands of newly discovered planets, planetoids, moons, and other stellar bodies, many of which sustain life. Each location is closely catalogued, with the most promising marked for future study. The frigid moon of Luvoth is one such location.</p>
                   <p>Known to the Starfinders only as Vast-723-Arctic-Moon, or VAM-723 for short, Luvoth is one of four small moons in orbit around an unexplored gas giant in the Vast. Initial scans of the moon indicate there’s no sapient inhabitants, but there are some artificial structures—an intriguing mystery! Believing VAM-723 could be the perfect jumping off point to explore the local stellar bodies and surrounding system, the Starfinder Society dispatches a team of agents to perform initial surveys of the moon and investigate the structures.</p>
                   <p><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-02: Mystery of the Frozen Moon</em> is a first contact adventure for 1st- and 2nd-level characters written by Solomon St. John.</p>
                   <h2>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-03: Disaster at Dreamlink Labs</h2>
                   <p>When a nascent godling called the Newborn was birthed from the planet Aucturn in 324 AG, chunks of its planetary womb and embryonic fluids were cast across the Pact Worlds. Most of this debris—called aucturnite—collected at the outer rim of the system, in a region known as the Gelid Edge. This forlorn field of ice and technomagical debris is a realm of occult power, haunted starship wrecks, and unknown horrors. Yet, for all its dangers, the Gelid Edge is a frontier of new discoveries and forbidden knowledge, and many Newborn evangelists, anomaly hunters, and occult researchers have flocked to the region to learn its secrets.</p>
                   <p>When the Starfinder Society is contacted by scientists from Dreamlink Laboratories, who claim to have made an important discovery in the Gelid Edge, Venture-Captain Arvin dispatches a team of agents to investigate. Unfortunately, something has invaded Dreamlink Labs… and time is running short for the lab’s survivors.</p>
                   <p>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-03: Disaster at Dreamlink Labs is a horror adventure for 1st- and 2nd-level characters written by Caryn DiMarco.</p>
                   <h2>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-04: The Great Absalom Relay</h2>

                     We’d like to thank our entire community from the bottom of our hearts for the overwhelmingly enthusiastic reception we’ve seen for the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6zwqx">Starfinder Tech Class Playtest</a>!

                   <p>We know you’re eager for new adventure content to playtest with, so we’ve cooked up a little bonus encounter for you to run for mechanics, technomancers, and their allies! Check that out at the end of this blog!</p>
                   <p>Additionally, the team has already received tremendously useful feedback, and we’ve spotted some irregularities in our code that might cause your exocortexes or spell databases to glitch. So before you take off on your next adventure, make sure your mechanic and technomancer are properly patched and updated with the newest addition to the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest/faq">Official Starfinder Playtest FAQ</a>. We’ve included a summary and explanation of some of the changes below:</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/93269716-aedc-41fa-b58c-40f3d36c56e0/PZO7601_Part3_Opener.jpg"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/93269716-aedc-41fa-b58c-40f3d36c56e0/PZO7601_Part3_Opener.jpg" width="85%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Artist Yun Huai Huang; iconics Quig and Raia taking cover behind a door frame from a firing turret"></a>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <h3><strong>Mechanic</strong></h3>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Modify Possession:</strong> Some Starfinders have expressed concern that Modify doesn’t work with grenades, thrown weapons, and exocortexes that leave your possession when used. To fix this, under "Modify" on page 4, replace the line "or leaves your possession" with "or a character other than you, your drone, or your turret attempts to use the item."</li>
                    <li><strong>Modify Drone:</strong> You need the Modify Drone feat in order to modify the weapons on your drone. Remove "and any weapons it wields" from the first sentence of the third paragraph under Drone on page 5.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deploy Mine:</strong> Using an extra action to deploy a mine should only change whether or not you can deploy it in an unoccupied square, not how far away you can deploy it. Replace the text of Deploy Mine with the following: “You deploy a mine, planting it in an unoccupied square within 30 feet. You can increase the number of actions you spend Deploying a Mine to two to instead plant the mine in an occupied square within 30 feet. When you Deploy a Mine, you select whether it will deal fire damage or piercing damage when detonated.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Aucturnite Ammunition:</strong> Transmutative Casing (feat 8) allows you to deal damage as if you were using aucturnite. Aucturnite ammunition and weapons gain the critical (mental) trait.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced &amp; Elite Drone Prerequisites:</strong> Change the prerequisite of Advanced Drone (feat 14) to Refined Chassis. Change the prerequisite of Elite Drone (feat 18) to Advanced Drone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Convertible Chassis:</strong> Replace the text of Convertible Chassis (feat 14) with the following: “Your drone easily converts between different forms. During daily preparations, choose two different chassis for your drone. You can select a different chassis as a 1-hour activity with the concentrate and manipulate traits. Your drone gains the Mobile Reconfiguration action. <strong>Mobile Reconfiguration</strong> [two actions] Your drone changes itself from one of its chassis to another.”</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3><strong>Robot Companion</strong></h3>
                   <p>· <strong>Robot Companion Skills:</strong> Like animal companions, robot companions are always trained in Acrobatics and Athletics, so they don’t need those skills as bonus skill proficiencies. Replace the Agile Chassis robot companion's skill with Stealth, and the Powerful Chassis and Tank Chassis robot companion's skill with Survival.</p>
                   <p>· <strong>Graceful and Burly:</strong> Graceful robot companions use the same adjustments as a nimble animal companion. Burly robot companions use the same adjustments as a savage animal companion.</p>
                   <h3><strong>Technomancer</strong></h3>
                   <p>· <strong>Defensive Measures:</strong> Change the technomancer feature Defensive Measures to increase your proficiency rank in unarmored defense and light armor to expert.</p>
                   <p>· <strong>Electrotether:</strong> The spell <em>electrotether</em> is the updated version of the <em>gravity tether</em> spell from the Starfinder Playtest rulebook. It uses the same statistics as <em>gravity tether</em>, except it has the electricity trait and can target up to two creatures (even if it’s not heightened).</p>
                   <p>· <strong>Spell Transfer Protocol:</strong> The magic hack <em>spell transfer protocol </em>was cut during development. The advanced magic hack for the ServoShell programming language is <em>hardlight simulacrum</em>.</p>
                   <p>While publishing errata for a playtest is unusual, we feel some of these changes dramatically changed how these classes were played and needed to be addressed early on in the playtest process. And if you’re still looking for opportunities to playtest these classes, stay tuned to this blog and check out the games being offered at this year’s <a href="https://paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>!</p>

                   <h3><strong>Artificial Anomalies and the Awkward Attack on Actors (Moderate 1)</strong></h3>
                   <p>Designed by Aras Yazgan</p>
                   <p>This encounter takes place on Akiton, along a trade route between the city of Arl and the settlements of Golden Bay. Talk to your players about what their characters are doing in the area. Some likely options are bandits, performers, or vigilantes patrolling the road. Playing these roles isn’t required, but might inspire some fun table banter.</p>
                   <p>The encounter takes place soon after the emergence of the Newborn (during the events of <em>A Cosmic Birthday</em>). A traveling theater troupe called the Aspiring Acting Aggregate has just started its yearly trip between the cities of the Ridgelands. On the way to Booster City, they were attacked by a group of robots experiencing an existential awakening due to psychic energy released by the Newborn. The robots draped themselves in fabric to appear human, then fired a turret at the troupe to scare them into abandoning their bus.</p>
                   <p>If the PCs talk to the troupe, an older woman named <strong>Madame Garvino</strong> (indignant female human stage manager) explains the situation: “Some upstarts set up a scheme just on the edge of Arlkari Plateau. The gall! They robbed us blind, not only of credits, but of our cloth, our smoke machines… Our everything was in that bus! We’re ruined.” She describes the ambush, explaining how snipers shot at them from a distance while two hooded figures ordered them to leave their bus, commenting, “The youth these days have no respect!”</p>
                   <p>When the PCs investigate the ambush site described by Madame Garvino, they find bits of cloth strewn atop the rocks, made to look like ambushers. An abandoned tour bus with AAA’s logo on the side is parked behind the rocks, emptied of valuables. As they investigate, the PCs notice electronic chittering and movement from the ruins to the northwest.</p>
                   <p>Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:</p>
                   <p>Two twig-thin rusty robots are moving electronics. One stops abruptly and yells, “Darling! Darling! Rumbled! That is what we are!” The other responds with: “You wanna get my kiddo, you’re gonna have to go through me, bucko,” a famous line from an old audio theater show. They drop what they were holding and take aggressive stances.</p>
                   <p><strong>Map</strong>: Use the desert map from <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Alien Ruins</em></p>
                   <p><strong>Creatures</strong>: Two repair-class security robots have been newly awakened into Sentient Robotic Organisms (SROs), but they lack the emotional regulation and sophistication to communicate properly. Each robot starts barely within the view of the PCs arriving from the southeast, one up north and the other to the west. The robots reposition around the rocks to lure the PCs into the turret’s range, which is placed on the slightly elevated plateau surrounded on three sides with rocks. If the PCs attack the turret, the robots desperately try to protect it. If the turret breaks, one stops attacking, drops prone, and spends all its actions yelling “Nooooo!” while the other attacks the PC who last dealt damage to the turret in a frenzy.</p>
                   <p><strong>Adjustments:</strong> If the robots are put out of commission before they can act or lure the players to the turret, one or two more robots emerge from the ruins to keep the battle going.</p>
                   <p><strong>Hazards</strong>: A laser turret is set up behind the wall, hidden by the rocks. It’s surrounded by random knickknacks from the AAA bus.</p>

                    <p><strong>Laser Blast</strong> [reaction] <strong>Trigger</strong> A creature moves within 30 feet of the turret; <strong>Effect</strong> The trap makes a laser Strike against the creature. The trap then rolls initiative.</p>
                    <p><strong>Routine</strong> (3 actions) The trap makes a laser Strike against up to three creatures in range, or multiple Strikes against one creature in range if it has no additional targets.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ranged</strong> laser +9 (range increment 90 feet), <strong>Damage</strong> 1d6+3 fire</p>

                   <br>
                   <p><strong>Development: </strong>A PC who succeeds at a DC 14 Computers or Crafting check realizes the robots are displaying complex behaviors that suggest they have developed emotions, higher thinking, and possibly even free will. A DC 18 Occultism or Religion check correctly determines that the robots have developed souls. The robots aren’t responsive to attempts at diplomacy during the battle, but afterward, they might be repaired and counseled rather than simply scrapped. The AAA troupe’s missing property is scattered around the rocks, set up haphazardly to resemble a crude stage.</p>
                   <p>If the PCs return the bus and equipment to Madame Garvino, she rewards them for their help (or pays handsomely to buy back her goods, if the PCs are less charitable). If the robots were repaired and counseled, she warily agrees to take them on as apprentice actors, admitting that their “performance” was quite spectacular.</p>
                   <p>Thanks for playing!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">As the Year of Immortal Influence comes to a raucously loud close, the leaders of the Pathfinder Society turn their attention to a question that’s been gnawing at the back of their minds since early in the machinations of the past year:</p>
                   <p>Why did Queen Abrogail Thrune II order the destruction of Greensteeples?</p>
                   <p>Though the question was seemingly unimportant as Pathfinder agents were contending with the rise of a demon lord, it’s returned to the focus just long enough for Venture-Captain Brackett over in Almas, Andoran to receive a missive for assistance from Andira Marusek.</p>
                   <p>It’s time for war.</p>

                   <p>Welcome to the Year of Battle’s Spark!</p>
                   <p>With the Inner Sea War beginning to spread across Avistan, it’s time for the Pathfinder Society to decide that enough is enough from Cheliax and to take a stand against them and the tyranny they represent. Throughout this upcoming year, we’ll be exploring the effects of this war across Golarion, with the metaplot arcs of Battle’s Spark and the Hellfire Crisis! These seven metaplot scenarios will be marked with a special metaplot icon on the cover. For more information about the metaplot, upcoming specials, and other new changes, please tune into the News from Organized Play panel at PaizoCon 2025!</p>

                   <p>The metaplot of the Year of Battle’s Spark kicks off with <em>Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Battle’s Spark—Enough is Enough</em>, an adventure for 1st- through 4th-level characters written by Matt Duval! This scenario takes us back to the hometown of Pathfinder Second Edition’s first Adventure Path, Breachill, as the Pathfinder Society assists the Steel Falcons with rescuing the innocent civilians from the town before launching an attack on the Hellknights that have taken cover in Citadel Altaerein! This scenario debuts at Gen Con 2025, alongside the Pathfinder Society special events and one other Pathfinder Society scenario!</p>
                   <p>We can’t wait to see you there, Pathfinders!</p>

                   <h1>Chronicle Sheets</h1>
                   <p>After completing an adventure, you’ll receive a <strong>Chronicle Sheet</strong>, either physically or digitally. Your Chronicle Sheet will contain a summary of the adventure you just completed, along with the following rewards:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Experience (XP)</strong>: What your character needs to level up! Each Starfinder Society Scenario awards <strong>4 XP</strong>. Every time you earn <strong>12 XP</strong>, your character levels up!</li>
                    <li><strong>Credits</strong>: In the Starfinder universe, credits are exchanged for goods and services. Your character will earn the same number of credits for every scenario, based on their level. This represents the Starfinder Society paying you for your efforts. Your character also gets to keep any treasure they find along the way. A first-level character will earn <strong>140 credits</strong> for the successful completion of a scenario, and a second-level character will earn <strong>220 credits</strong>. A full table for all character levels will be made available in the Guide to Organized Play upon release.</li>
                    <li><strong>Downtime</strong>: Starfinder Society characters earn eight days of Downtime after completing an adventure. This can be used for any Downtime activity in the rules, including Earning Income, Retraining, or Crafting.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Character Options</strong>: Each Starfinder Society scenario will award your characters new bespoke content tailored to the adventure! This could be anything: a new feat you can take to represent your time in the wilds, a magic or tech item gifted to you by a NPC, or anything else our authors and developers can dream up.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <br>
                   <h1>Achievement Points</h1>
                   <p>Upon completion of an adventure, you (the player) will <em>also</em> earn Achievement Points (AcP). This is a meta-currency that is tracked on our website after an adventure is reported. For each scenario, players will earn 4 Achievement Points, and GMs will earn 8. Playing or running games at supported events such as conventions or your local game store may also apply a multiplier to these points, allowing you to unlock rewards even faster.</p>
                   <p>Achievement Points are spent in our online boon store on new rewards and options. Some of the rewards will include:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legacy Ancestries</strong>: <em>Starfinder Player Core</em> and <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy Guide</em> contain a whole host of alien ancestries, but we know many of you want to venture into space as an elf, dwarf, or other classic fantasy ancestry. At launch, some of these ancestries will be available in the Boon Store for just 8 Achievement Points, which means that GMing just one session lets you blast off as a space goblin!</li>
                    <li><strong>Condition Removal</strong>: Get hit with a nasty curse? Did an akata implant eggs in your character’s stomach, or did you die in the final boss fight? Achievement Points can be used to remove negative conditions after an adventure and even bring your character back to life!</li>
                    <li><strong>Pathfinder Options</strong>: Versatile heritages, archetypes, and even classes will be made available over time through the use of Achievement Points. Your solar kineticist is just a few GM sessions away from your grasp!</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>We’re always looking for new ways to let you spend your Achievement Points. If there’s something you want, whether it’s a specific option or a whole category of possible rewards, let us know. We just might make it happen!</p>

                   <h1>Changes from Previous Programs</h1>
                   <p>Those of you who have been with Organized Play for a while will notice a couple of conspicuous absences. We wanted to address those upfront and explain why we’ve made the decision not to include them.</p>
                   <p>First, Starfinder Society (Second Edition) does not have factions. You’re a Starfinder, and that’s it—you’re not a member of some secondary subgroup as well. For years, factions have existed as a vestige of old systems, and at the current time, the Starfinder team is more interested in telling the story of the Society as a unified group rather than as a collection of special interests in a holo-trenchcoat. Removing them also eliminates another Organized Play-specific element that new players have to learn about.</p>
                   <p>Additionally, Starfinder Society will not have a GM ranking system akin to the previous system of stars, glyphs, or novas at launch. This <em>will</em> return at a future date in some form, though not necessarily the one you may be used to. We do want to make sure we’re rewarding our dedicated GMs and recognizing those who go above and beyond for the program. However, what we don’t want to even tacitly encourage is the practice of rushing to that top rank and being one of the first GMs with the highest recognition. We’ve seen too many GMs in Pathfinder Society burn themselves out and drop shortly after achieving this goal, and the easiest way to prevent it, in our minds, is simply not to put it in front of you until a later date.</p>
                   <p>Also, to be honest, I’m just not sure what to call this new rank. Rings? Comets? Moons? Donuts? Naming things is hard, so I’m procrastinating.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1>Retail Incentive Program</h1>
                   <p>Now more than ever, it’s critical to support the game stores and venues who host our games. Starfinder Society (Second Edition) will feature a Retail Incentive Program (RIP) just like previous editions. This program will provide characters with additional durability and healing based on the amount of money the table has spent at the venue during the session. About to lose your final hitpoint? A last-minute dice purchase might just give you the tools you need to survive!</p>

                   <p>You know how our Adventure Paths have a free Player’s Guide, available for download here on paizo.com? They’re great; they have primers on the campaign, recommendations for what to play, and even campaign-specific content like new backgrounds. Those are neat! We decided we wanted one, so we’re doing it.</p>
                   <p>Prior to the season launch (likely in July), we’ll be publishing the first Starfinder Society Player’s Guide. Contained within will be everything you need to get started with Starfinder Society, including:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>An overview of the campaign rules and a brief history of the Starfinder Society</li>
                    <li>Exclusive backgrounds, written just for Starfinder Society’s first story arc</li>
                    <li>Playtest backgrounds, available exclusively to players who participated in the Starfinder Playtest adventures</li>
                    <li>Two new ancestries, hot off the presses and immediately (and always) available for use in Starfinder Society!</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>This will be a free PDF download here on paizo.com. We’ll also have printed copies available at Gen Con for all attendees. This will not replace the full Guide to Organized Play on the Lorespire Wiki, which contains the full rules and regulations for the program. Rather, it is intended to be a primer for new and experienced players alike. We hope this will help bring new players into the fold and provide everyone with exciting new options for the campaign.</p>
                   <p>Tune in next week for our final rollout blog, where Jessica will announce our first Starfinder Society storyline for Second Edition! I can’t wait to discover the mysteries of—oops, said too much, gotta go!</p>

                   <p><b>Pathfinder Player Core</b> had small fixes to ensure Learn a Spell adds a spell to a wizard’s spellbook as intended and to clean up some jump-related feats.</p>
                   <p><b>Pathfinder Player Core 2</b> also had jump-related feats changes, plus some other minor changes.</p>
                   <p><b>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</b> has updates to its troops to reflect the <em>Pathfinder NPC Core</em> troop rule changes, updates references to <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em> to new references in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</em>.</p>
                   <p><b>Pathfinder War of Immortals</b> mostly got some fixes to errant action symbols and prerequisites, but included more substantial changes to the exemplar’s <em>victor’s wreath</em> ikon and to actions Silence the Profane and Disrupt Opposed Magic in the avenger and vindicator archetypes.</p>
                   <p><b>Pathfinder Lost Omens Rival Academies</b> had changes to the runelord archetype to fix a spell appearing at the wrong rank and to make it clear how their arcane bond and personal rune work.</p>

                   <p>High-Tech Adventures put technology and magitech at the center! These adventures can be set in technologically advanced cities or space stations—like Absalom Station—or on planets like Aballon, where everything you see is a machine.</p>
                   <p>Characters in high-tech adventures, whether player characters or NPCs, may have a higher likelihood of being androids or having a variety of cybernetic enhancements and augmentations. Classes like the technomancer and mechanic (from our currently-running <a href="https://starfinderplaytest.com/">Tech Class Playtest</a>) are spectacularly well-suited for high-tech adventures, but there’s more than enough space in the augmented reality court for operatives, witchwarpers, soldiers—or maybe even a rogue or ranger, transported from Golarion and left in awe of the technology around them!</p>
                   <p>As you’re building a high-tech adventure, campaign, or character, here are some questions to ask:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>How does technology improve lives for people in this world? Conversely, how is technology making lives difficult?</li>
                    <li>Are the player characters working with or against the technology? Is it a tool in their arsenal or an impediment in their way?</li>
                    <li>Is a new (or newly rediscovered) piece of technology changing the world—for better or worse?</li>
                    <li>What happens when technology that everyone relies on goes awry?</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Install your cybernetics, hack into the mainframe, and get ready for high tech adventures and so much more, coming in <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide!</em></p>

                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders!<br>
                     Way back at the beginning of the Year of Immortal Influence, a very gorgeous, talented, amazing Pathfinder agent by the name of Khione Thidos offered to help look into the strange background of Lady Hesla Embersplitter. Well, her research is finally paying off as she’s located a small settlement by the name of Pimatsih out in Sarkoris that seems to have a small amount of information about Hesla, her background, and her whereabouts. A healer knows that the Cult of the Screaming Grub is responsible for her rise, but it’s up to the Pathfinders to go into the badlands of Sarkoris and search out the ominously named cave system Deskari’s Gullet and see what Hesla’s been up during her absence. However, the agents may find that she’s more prepared to handle cultists than they are...</p>

                   <p>Meanwhile, way out in the Arcadian Ocean we’ve got a follow-up to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq03tyo?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-516-A-Lie-Told-to-Strangers"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-16: A Lie Told to Strangers</em></a>. At the end of that scenario, the Pathfinders were faced with a mysterious door that could not be opened beneath Kaer Maga. Well, someone believes they may have located a key to that door. A self-proclaimed runelord and scholar of all things Thassilonian and Azlanti, Zinthyra Tannol, a sprite granted a field commission for her numerous contributions, believes an ancient Azlanti scholar sealed that door long before Earthfall. She also believes she’s located the laboratory where the key was stored. This contribution, when added to all her previous accolades, would be enough to propel her to the seat of venture-captain, but it’ll be up to you if her mission succeeds. As a test of her abilities, she’s in charge of directing a group of Pathfinder agents, as any venture-captain would be. Will you help the sprite’s dreams come to fruition, or will whatever dangers that were left in the long-forgotten Azlanti laboratory thwart your efforts?</p>

                   <p>And finally, dear Pathfinders, we go back to Minkai, clear on the other side of the world from both of the above adventures. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02f13?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-512-Mischief-in-the-Maze"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-12: Mischief in the Maze</em></a>, a connection from a Tanuki village to the Maze of the Open Road—the interdimensional hedge maze that the Society can use to cross vast distances incredibly quickly—was formed due to elemental instabilities and the tanuki throwing whatever magic seemed interesting at the planar fissure. Now the Pathfinder Society wants to establish a lodge in southern Minkai within that village, but they need to get all the proper permissions. The tanuki are amenable, but the Society needs to help them out with some issues first. Of course, that falls to you and your companions. Before all of this is done, perhaps you’ll even save the village from a danger none were aware of.</p>

                   <h1>Character Creation Basics</h1>
                   <p>In general, you’ll follow the rules as outlined in the <em>Starfinder Player Core</em> to create a player character (PC) in Starfinder Society. For a preview of these rules, check out the <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em>. The following steps will augment these character creation rules:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>When creating your character concept, remember that you are a member of the Starfinder Society. They must be able to work with any other Starfinder and abide by the Society’s motto: “Explore, Report, Cooperate.”</li>
                    <li>Characters may use any ancestry, heritage, background, and class from the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em> or <em>Starfinder Player Core</em>. 
                     <ul>
                      <li>Players who participated in the Starfinder Playtest will have access to exclusive backgrounds based on these adventures. Additionally, all Starfinders will have access to campaign-specific backgrounds in addition to those found in hardcover material.</li>
                     </ul></li>
                    <li>Characters must be adults for their ancestry, and cannot be sanctified to unholy.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <br>
                   <h1>Starting at Higher Levels</h1>
                   <p>In Starfinder Society (second edition), characters may be created at 1st-, 3rd-, 5th- or 7th-level. While we encourage all players to start their first character at 1st-level to help them learn the system, we believe this flexibility will allow for greater ease of scheduling across the board. Characters who participate in an entire plotline from the very start will also find that later scenarios will reward having participated in earlier adventures.</p>
                   <p>Pregenerated characters will be available at 1st-, 3rd-, and 5th-level, though we want to caution you all that 5th-level content won’t appear until close to the end of our first season of play.</p>
                   <p>When creating a character at a higher level, you may select starting equipment using either the lump sum or permanent items as found in the Character Wealth table (<em>Starfinder GM Core </em>59).</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1>Level Cap</h1>
                   <p>We do not intend to publish adventures for characters above 10th level. As scenarios get into higher level ranges, we see diminishing table counts. These high-level adventures are also significantly more involved to design and develop. We’re announcing this cap now to set expectations and to ensure you’re all aware of our plans from the start. We’d hate for you to create a character whose build comes online late in the game, only to find out that you won’t have a chance to play them in the campaign.</p>
                   <p>Those who are interested in play above 10th-level should look to our other published Adventure Paths and Adventure content. Organized Play is a great way to find other players you enjoy gaming with for these additional experiences!</p>

                   <h1>Character Options</h1>
                   <p>Our plan, with a handful of exceptions, is to make as much of our published Starfinder content available to all Starfinder characters without purchasing boons or completing certain adventures. This means that at launch all ancestries, classes, and other options in the <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy Guide</em>, <em>Starfinder</em><em>Player Core</em>, and <em>Starfinder</em><em>GM Core</em> will be available for all characters, and future products will see similarly permissive access. Starfinder Society will not use variant rules such as Free Archetype or Automatic Bonus Progression.</p>
                   <p>Additionally, players will be permitted to use the technomancer and mechanic classes from the Tech Playtest until their release in a future hardcover book! We will have full guidelines for converting your character once we get closer, but expect that any technomancers or mechanics will be required to rebuild into the final rules once they are released.</p>
                   <p>We want you to purchase a Paizo product and be able to use that content immediately, without restriction. One of the core appeals of Starfinder is the cantina of alien options available, and we believe that’s a key component of our Organized Play program as well.</p>
                   <p>With that in mind, what might Achievement Points be used for? And what other rewards might scenarios unlock? Join us next week for more on adventure rewards and other program elements!</p>

                   <p>The <strong>mechanic </strong>is a versatile martial class that uses item mods in tandem with an exocortex, which allows them to control a robot companion, remotely fire a turret, or plant explosive mines!</p>

                   <h3><strong>How to Playtest </strong></h3>
                   <p>We’ll be collecting feedback on the playtest until May 30th, 2025! You can play the mechanic and technomancer using the resources on our <a href="http://www.starfinderplaytest.com/">Playtest Homepage</a>, such as the <em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> and errata found on the Playtest FAQ page. We’re looking for your feedback and comments regarding these classes, but we’re focusing our attention on feedback from play, both online using virtual tabletops (VTTs) or play-by-post and offline, at your friendly local gaming store, convention, or wherever else you can safely play. We recommend using our existing playtest adventures to test out these classes, or even trying out Pathfinder adventures for an out-of-this-world anachronistic saga! Our friends at Demiplane will also be hosting a free preview of their online character-building tools, allowing you to build playtest mechanics and technomancers online! You can visit them at <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/starfinder2e/sources/tech-class-playtest">https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/starfinder2e/sources/tech-class-playtest</a>.</p>
                   <p>We will be watching the results of this playtest carefully and might even change the fundamentals of these classes based on your feedback. We are unlikely to release any supporting errata for this class playtest unless we find a feature that is so overwhelming that it skews the data.</p>
                   <p>Once you’ve had a chance to try these classes, you can submit your feedback in a few ways:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong> Surveys:</strong> Head to <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">http://www.starfinderplaytest.com</a> to find the playtest material and take <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/starfinderplaytest">surveys</a> that will allow us to gather your responses. These surveys will remain open until the end of the playtest.</li>
                    <li><strong> Forums:</strong> On paizo.com, you’ll find <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/secondEditionPlaytest">playtest subforums</a> for the mechanic and technomancer, with threads for discussion and announcements. When you post, look for existing threads on your topic before starting a new one. Remember that every poster is trying to make the game better for everyone, so please be polite and respectful. We will attempt to monitor other channels online, such as subreddits and discord discussions, but paizo.com is the dedicated space where you can be sure we can see your reports.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>We’d like to thank you for participating in the <em>Starfinder Tech Class Playtest.</em> We look forward to seeing what you think and using your feedback to make these classes the best they can be!</p>

                   <h1>What is a Starfinder Society Scenario?</h1>
                   <p>Starfinder Society Scenarios are one-shot adventures designed to be played in the Starfinder Society Organized Play Program. Each scenario is 2–3 hours in length and can be played by groups of 4–6 characters within a specified two-level range. As self-contained adventures, each scenario has problems to solve, villains to combat, challenges to overcome, and a clear ending. Many Starfinder Society Scenarios are also interconnected and form a larger story. While some of these stories are small and span two to three scenarios, others are the focus of many more. The “largest” story of each season is often referred to as the metaplot.</p>
                   <h2>Scenario Cadence</h2>
                   <p>Starfinder Society Second Edition launches at GenCon 2025 (July 31–August 3). The launch scenarios and adventures will be available on <strong>paizo.com</strong> on August 1, and organizers may begin scheduling events as soon as the convention ends on August 3. During this first month, we’re releasing four Starfinder Society Scenarios plus a special launch adventure—for more information on this launch adventure, be sure to drop by and read the Organized Play blog on May 8, 2025. Every month afterwards, we’re releasing two Starfinder Society Scenarios, for a total of 26 scenarios during our first year of the campaign!</p>
                   <h2>Scenario Presentation</h2>
                   <p>Starfinder Society Scenarios are Starfinder adventures.</p>
                   <p>In the past, we created a lot of additions and exceptions for Starfinder Society Scenarios which resulted in scenarios including information, rules, and deviations that other Starfinder adventures did not have. These deviations increased the barrier to entry for people interested in participating in Starfinder Society Organized Play and increased the time staff had to pour into each scenario. Going forward, we’re avoiding unnecessary deviations whenever possible and leading with simplicity and synchronicity. If you know how to read and run a Starfinder adventure, you’ll be able to read and run <em>any</em>Starfinder adventure, from the shortest Starfinder Society Scenario to the longest Starfinder Adventure Path. This change frees us up to create more adventures and more content for Starfinder Society.</p>
                   <p>Of course, some deviation <em>is</em> required! For example, GMs can easily adjust the difficulty of a scenario to be easier or harder using the Adjusting Difficulty sidebars found throughout Starfinder Society Scenarios. This empowers GMs to accommodate and adapt to tables of varying sizes, levels, and experience—a necessity for Organized Play!</p>
                   <p>(To preemptively answer a question many fans of Pathfinder Society Second Edition are likely to ask: Starfinder Society Scenarios in Second Edition do not include appendices, challenge points, treasure bundles, or scenario tags.)</p>
                   <h2>Scenario Levels</h2>
                   <p>Each Starfinder Society Scenario is designed for a specific two-level range. During the first year of Starfinder Society Second Edition, you can expect a lot of scenarios to be level 1–2 adventures or, later in the year, level 3–4 adventures. If your character is either of a scenario’s listed levels, you can play the scenario with that character! If you don’t have a character of the appropriate level, you can still play if you use a newly created character or a pregenerated character. (Yes, you read that right! More on that next week!). You can play every Starfinder Society Scenario as many times as you like, earning full rewards for playing, so long as you play with a different character each time. GMs can also assign credit to a new character each time they run a scenario.</p>
                   <p>You’re always welcome to play a Starfinder Society game!</p>
                   <h1>What’s Next?</h1>
                   <p>Over the next few weeks, we’ll be unveiling more information about the Starfinder Society Organized Play program, focusing on a different aspect of the program in each blog. You can follow along with our schedule below:</p>

                   <h2>The Foundation</h2>
                   <p>Paizo began work on modernizing its backend infrastructure in 2023 to allow us easier and faster access to the boring business analytics and insights that we’ve historically had to assemble by spreadsheets over the years. When completed, it will greatly improve our ability to ensure that we have the right products available at the right time and in the right quantities for our customers, send more timely reports to our business partners, and overall streamline internal processes that are stretched across several systems.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f31fc6c7-f95d-4647-8f5f-c86f9690771e/Tech_Background_1920x1080.png"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f31fc6c7-f95d-4647-8f5f-c86f9690771e/Tech_Background_1920x1080.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A diverse group of aliens all standing and sitting around different consoles"></a>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>Part of this core infrastructure is the rollout of a new warehouse management system. The first part of this is live today, with orders to our hobby and book distributors being picked and shipped from the new system. The next step will be when the new ecommerce store goes live. From your side, you’ll see faster and more accurate orders and trackable shipping details. In addition, Paizo won’t need to shut down for a week every year to do inventory. Instead, the system has us run mini-inventories every week throughout the year.</p>

                   <h2>The New Store</h2>
                   <p>The team is hard at work on a brand-new store experience, reorganizing the entirety of Paizo’s products into more coherent and easier-to-find locations, extracting data from our legacy system, and more.</p>
                   <p>Much of what you see on Paizo.com today has been built internally over the years and is affectionately known as Presto. Back when Paizo began, ecommerce software to handle subscriptions didn’t really exist, so we built our own solution from the ground up. Presto currently does the heavy lifting for the ecommerce store, forums, shipping and package tracking, and more. It also provides a variety of reports that the finance team imports into their accounting software, the sales team uses to track sales, etc.</p>
                   <p>The new store will replace all of the shopping pages on the site: product pages, category pages, and store landing pages–including the subscriptions landing page, providing a more modern, streamlined shopping experience for customers, including a single-page checkout!</p>
                   <p>Areas that will stay the same for now will be the forums, Organized Play reporting, the blog, and a dozen or so landing pages. Here’s a brief rundown of the new things you’ll see at the Paizo Store when it launches.</p>

                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5bc7486e-4ada-48dd-92b9-012f0332b847/PaizoPlusLoyaltyProgram.png"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5bc7486e-4ada-48dd-92b9-012f0332b847/PaizoPlusLoyaltyProgram.png" width="800px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Join Paizo Plus, Yotpo banner"></a>

                   <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/store/subscriptions">Paizo Advantage</a> is our current loyalty program. It gives subscribers access to free Pathfinder Society or Starfinder Society releases if you subscribe to 4 lines and both if you subscribe to 6 or more. It also grants 15% off most of your Paizo.com purchases.</p>
                   <p>The new Paizo Plus program will give you more choices for your rewards. You’ll earn virtual gold on your purchases that you can use for things like coupons for society scenarios, $5–20 off coupons, and the top tier will grant 15% off all your purchases just like today. You’ll also be able to earn gold by writing reviews of your purchases, by referring your friends to the new store, by following Paizo on social media, by joining the new program, and on your birthday!</p>
                   <p>There will be changes vs. how we do things today, of course, but we’ve worked hard to create a program that lets you keep what you want from today’s loyalty program and expand it out to something even better. We’ll be sharing more details on the new Paizo Plus in an upcoming blog.</p>
                   <h3>Library</h3>
                   <p>We’re very excited to be unveiling a new file library when the new store launches as well. This replaces your Digital Content portal that exists today and offers more streamlined search capabilities using filters and a search box, a new look, the ability to download multiple products at once, and more! Everything you currently have in your current Digital Content will migrate to the new Library.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5af28d9c-daa1-4546-82e8-b6e9efb9ca19/BC_DigitalLibrary.png"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5af28d9c-daa1-4546-82e8-b6e9efb9ca19/BC_DigitalLibrary.png" width="800px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Screenshot of the New Digital Library UI"></a>

                   <h3>New Payment Methods</h3>
                   <p>We will be expanding payment methods with the new store. Here are a few that we are targeting for launch.</p>
                   <p><strong>Credit Cards</strong>: American Express, Aura, Diners Club, Discover, ELO, Hipercard, JCB, Mada, Mastercard, RuPay (India), UnionPay, Visa.</p>
                   <p><strong>Digital Wallets</strong>: Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal.</p>
                   <p><strong>Online Bank Transfers</strong>: Sofort</p>
                   <p>Some of these payment methods are region specific (like Hipercard for Brazil or RuPay for India), so you won’t be flooded with options when you checkout. Not all payment methods can be used for subscription payments because some providers don’t allow recurring payments, but you’ll see available options as you go through checkout for subscriptions.</p>
                   <h3>New Subscription Portal</h3>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6404f0a2-c4b3-4d49-8d5b-e5907dabc4b9/BC_SubscriptionPortal.png"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6404f0a2-c4b3-4d49-8d5b-e5907dabc4b9/BC_SubscriptionPortal.png" width="800px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="a screenshot of the new paizo store subscription UO"></a>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>Starting with the launch of the new store, subscribers will be able to manage their subscriptions directly from their dashboard. This will allow you to skip, cancel, or suspend a subscription without the need to contact the customer service team.</p>
                   <p>Subscribers will be able to continue to “sidecart” products into their upcoming subscriptions through what’s now called combined shipping. This is largely the same functionality we have now, but the process for adding items to your sidecart are a bit different. We’ll cover that in a future blog.</p>
                   <h3>So… When?</h3>
                   <p>The date for this launch was written during the Gap and is currently lost to human knowledge. Triune predicts that the date is soon(™), but I dare not tempt the machine gods by uttering a specific date.</p>
                   <p>Stay tuned!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, all! I’m writing this update from my parents’ house in Pittsburgh between conventions. I just finished my attendance at CoSCon, where I had a wonderful time. It’s great to see an area hit hard by the pandemic rebound in such a strong way. I was especially heartened by seeing several kids and teenagers attending with their parents and having a blast. Passing games on to the younger generations is so important for keeping this hobby alive.</p>
                   <p>In a couple of days, I’ll be hopping on the train down to Richmond for <a href="https://galaxycon.com/">GalaxyCon</a>! I’m very excited to see the folks down there, as well as meet the GalaxyCon team in person. We’ve been striking up a relationship with their family of shows, and I’m looking forward to seeing that partnership grow. If you’ve got a GalaxyCon, Animate! or Nightmare Weekend event in your area, you may see Paizo gaming and products there soon!</p>
                   <p>Travel like this can be hard sometimes; I’m spending nearly two weeks away from my husband and cats, and I miss them terribly. However, gaming with all of you reminds me why I love my job. I had one of the most delightful tables of my life on Sunday at CoSCon, and tables like that really rejuvenate me. I’m looking forward to this summer and the launch of our brand-new Starfinder Society program!</p>

                   <p>Yesterday, we published the&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6znhl?Welcome-to-Starfinder-Society">first of five blogs</a> comprising our program announcements for Starfinder Society second edition! Over the next four weeks, we’ll be posting more information about the program. We’ve been working on the plans for SFS2 for nearly two years now, and it’s so exciting to be able to finally share this information with all of you!</p>
                   <p>Please be sure to spread the word about Starfinder Society! We want everybody to be informed as we approach the launch, and we believe that with your help we can have the best launch of an Organized Play program ever. Stay tuned for more information and come ready with your questions!</p>

                   <h2>2025 Major Conventions</h2>
                   <p>Next Wednesday at 9 a.m. Pacific time, player signups will open for PaizoCon Online! <a href="https://paizo.com/paizocon">Buy your badge now</a> and be ready to grab slots in Pathfinder and Starfinder Society games, as well as games run by members of the community and Paizo staff! View all the games available for signup on <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-2025">Warhorn</a>.</p>
                   <p>We are still accepting applications for reserve GMs for Gen Con Indianapolis. If you’re looking to squeeze a slot or two of Pathfinder or Starfinder in amongst everything else at the show, we’d love to have you! Visit the link below to learn more about our GM rewards and apply.</p>
                   <p>Among those rewards is a volunteer t-shirt! I’m thrilled to reveal the new art for this year’s volunteer t-shirts, featuring the brand new Starfinder Society logo and our friendly skittergoblin behind the GM screen.</p>

                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had one GM reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: David Gonzalez</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>

                   <h2>Conventions</h2>

                   <p>The day after PaizoCon I’ll be hopping on a plane to Birmingham for <strong>UK Games Expo</strong>; if you’re across the pond, I’d love to see you there! Looking for a Paizo staff visit this fall? Drop me an email and let me know about your event; my contemplative gunslinger just might stop by!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, Starfinders! Today, Jessica and I are thrilled to officially announce <strong>Starfinder Society Second Edition</strong>, launching at Gen Con 2025!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>What is Starfinder Society?</h2>
                   <p>Starfinder Society is our flagship Organized Play program for the Starfinder roleplaying game. Our goal is to provide players with a fast, easy, and flexible way to play Starfinder by offering games at local game stores, at conventions, and online. You can even play at home with your friends! Every time you play an adventure, you’ll earn rewards for your character such as credits and experience.</p>
                   <p>Organized Play allows you to take the same character from table to table around the world and continue to level them up. No matter what your schedule is, whether you’re a weekly player or a once-a-month-if-I’m-lucky gamer, Organized Play provides a way for you to participate in the campaign!</p>
                   <p>By playing Starfinder Society adventures, you’ll get involved with the Starfinder universe and have a major impact. Each game’s results are reported back to us by your GM, and your decisions will have major consequences. The Starfinder Society has been front and center for many major events in the Pact Worlds including the hatching of Aucturn, the liberation of Pulonis, the Data Scourge, and more!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>The World of the Starfinder Society</h2>
                   <p>In the Starfinder universe, the Starfinder Society is a famous organization of adventurers, explorers, scholars, and xenoarchaeologists dedicated to discovering, exploring, and chronicling all the corners of the galaxy and beyond. Starfinders are incredibly diverse, with countless people, specialties, and life experiences represented. The motto of the Starfinder Society is “explore, report, cooperate.” All of your Starfinder Society Organized Play characters are members of the Starfinder Society.</p>
                   <p>Starfinder agents work in teams and perform missions as assigned by Starfinder leadership, including First Seeker Sarmak, current elected leader of the Starfinder Society. Starfinders record their findings, preserve discoveries, and share their knowledge with the galaxy. Many Starfinders operate out of regional headquarters called lodges, which are maintained by a venture-captain—an experienced Starfinder who acts as a mentor and organizer. The Lorespire Complex is the main base of operations for the Starfinder Society, which is located on Absalom Station, the very heart of the Pact Worlds.</p>

                   <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                   <p>Our program officially launches at Gen Con 2025 (July 31–August 3). The launch scenarios and adventures will be available on paizo.com on August 1, and organizers may begin scheduling events as soon as the convention ends on August 3. In the meantime, get started with these three simple steps:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li><strong>Get an Organized Play ID number</strong> at <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount">https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount</a>. Every time you play a Starfinder Society game, you’ll give this number to your GM to report back to us.</li>
                    <li>Begin to <strong>create your character</strong>! We’ll talk about the specifics of character creation in a future blog, but you can review the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest"><em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em></a> as well as the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq07vsk?Starfinder-Galaxy-Guide"><em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em></a> (releasing next month) to get inspiration for your first player character.</li>
                    <li><strong>Locate your gaming group</strong>! Reach out to your friendly local game store to see if they have Organized Play games, and if not, ask about how to run some! Join our online community at <a href="http://pfschat.com/">pfschat.com</a>, or check out the <a href="https://www.gencon.com/indy">Gen Con event catalog</a> to join one of our launch events.</li>
                   </ol>
                   <br>
                   <h2>New Edition, New Program</h2>
                   <p>Since the summer of 2023, we have been working as a team on the next iteration of Organized Play. We knew that a new edition was going to provide us with a unique opportunity to revitalize and revamp the program for a modern age, and we’re taking the opportunity with all six of our skittermander arms. We’ve put every part of the program under a microscope, from scenario structure to character creation and more, and evaluated what it’s doing and how we can make it the best version of itself. The community’s feedback has been critical to this. Whether you’ve spoken to us about OP at a convention, answered last winter’s community survey, or written something about the program online, we’ve taken your thoughts and input into account.</p>
                   <p>In some ways, the program will look very familiar. In others, it will look radically different. Whether you’re an Organized Play veteran or a brand-new Starfinder fresh out of training, we encourage everyone to approach the program with an open mind. Our primary goals have been to make the program easier to get into, simpler to explain, and focus more on the fun at the table. We’re not doing things just because we’ve always done them that way; we’re taking some risks and breaking down some barriers to make a stronger program for all of you.</p>
                   <p>Narratively, the Starfinder Society is always in the thick of things, uncovering secrets, witnessing major events, averting disasters, driving change, and shaping the ongoing story of the Pact Worlds with their actions. The future is no different. In fact, I hear something big is coming to the Pact Worlds and, while we’re not going to reveal our next major storyline today, we <em>can</em> shine a light on it...</p>

                   <h2>What Are Paizo Subscriptions?</h2>
                   <p>Subscriptions have been Paizo’s foundation since the beginning of our company, starting with our periodical publication of Dungeon and Dragon Magazines and transitioning into Pathfinder Adventure Paths. Paizo Subscriptions have only expanded and improved from there, encompassing product lines like rulebooks, accessories, adventures, and more!</p>
                   <p>By subscribing to any of our product lines, you’ll receive free PDFs alongside your physical copies when they ship. This often means you’ll have access to PDFs two weeks before they release to the public! Plus, the more lines you subscribe to, the more money you save, as multiple subscriptions qualify you for the prestigious Paizo Advantage program.</p>
                   <p>To learn more about our existing subscriptions and join the party, you can <a href="https://paizo.com/store/subscriptions">head over to our subscription page right now</a>!</p>

                   <p>These Legislative Game Days bring together some of our state’s tabletop game companies, game stores, librarians, and others who use games in their work, such as using therapeutic gaming for veterans suffering from PTSD, youth programs, and those incarcerated in the state. Secretary Hobbs and his staff organize these events to get those in the games industry to sit down with state legislators and their staff so they can learn more about our industry, the games we make, and the concerns and challenges we have within our industry.</p>

                   <p>At this gathering, Logan and I were joined by Cosmo Eisele, John Compton, and Jenny Jarzabski. We had two tables set up running brief demos of both Pathfinder and Starfinder. I even brought Elemental Stones, but we were out of table space. We were joined by some of our friends at Green Ronin, Ravensburger, Wizards of the Coast, TinkerHouse Games, and Heart of the Deernicorn, as well as numerous local game stores like The Mystic Game Shop, Around the Table Games, and Mox, and other organizations such as Evergreen State College of Game Design. We were also able to make connections with others in the community, such as talking with the state library rep about how to better incorporate tabletop games into library collections and programming.</p>

                   <p>It was an evening of fun and camaraderie as we got to show off our games to lawmakers and their staff and to catch up with others in the industry.

                   <p>A Starfinder Society Scenario designed for 3rd- through 6th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>First Seeker Sarmak’s archaeological survey of the ancient city of Eternity has been interrupted by Those Who Call, a fanatical cult of robotic anacites determined to draw the mysterious First Ones back to the planet Aballon. Under the ruthless leadership of Supreme-Proclaimant, Those Who Call prepare to destroy Aballon’s government and capital city using a devastating weapon reconstructed from ancient First Ones’ technology.</p>
                   <p>After stealing an artifact known as the&nbsp;<em>Eternity Drive</em>&nbsp;from the Starfinder Society during a violent surprise assault, Those Who Call have all they need to fire this weapon, destroy the nearby megaplex of Striving, and dispatch their intergalactic call to the First Ones! Can the Starfinder Society stop Those Who Call? Or will Supreme-Proclaimant purge the planet of Aballon in a wave of devastation?</p>

                   <p>A small earthquake and landslide near the mining operations of Marivit Kopje, a Kalistocrat of minor standing, have opened a vault long thought lost. Shimia Renveld was an oddity even among Kalistocrats. She collected oddities that held no real monetary value, or at least that was what she thought. Marivit believes that her recently uncovered collection might hold a key to helping turn around his fortunes, and he's promised the Pathfinders everything else in the vault in order to get it.</p>

                   <h2>A Domestic Wizard's Guide to Housekeeping: Dust Bunny</h2>
                   <h3>Felix Dritz</h3>
                   <p>In pursuit of your studies, it’s often easy to ignore daily chores and cleanliness. While those more adept at magic often choose to leave their day-to-day cleaning to a <em>phantasmal minion</em>, it’s crucial to take time in your day to verify your summon’s work. Too often a vague order will lead to them brushing things under cupboards, moving all stray objects into unorganized bins, or placing books on shelves at random. While the disorganization of your possessions is certainly lamentable, it can become frightful if dust is left to collect in neglected corners and under furniture! When this dust collects near magical sources, the debris can gain sentience, becoming a dust bunny.</p>
                   <p>You may find these little creatures charming, but beware. While the creation of dust bunnies can take little thought, their care and maintenance are something that many young wizards lack knowledge of. Those unprepared to take care of a dust bunny had best sweep it into a containment bin, lest their accidental creation consume their study and home.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/080cfa22-cf50-403f-9b29-ce176d265e2a/DustBunny_Art.jpg"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/080cfa22-cf50-403f-9b29-ce176d265e2a/DustBunny_Art.jpg" width="500px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Illustration of a dust bunny"></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Dust Bunny Familiar</h3>
                   <p>If you, despite the warning, desire a dust bunny companion, or perhaps you have one by accident and are willing to care for it, this section is for you. Dust bunnies greatly enjoy company and will often desire to lie on your lap or desk. Wherever they keep you company, ensure the area is regularly cleaned of any new or shed debris; otherwise, another dust bunny may form.</p>
                   <p>To feed your dust bunny, simply keep the collections from your daily housekeeping. However, if you notice they begin growing to an unreasonable size, be sure to limit their portions, as they have been known to grow to the size of large dogs.</p>
                   <p>It's important to remember that having formed of their own accord, dust bunnies are highly independent. While this makes them great companions and assistants, this also makes dust bunnies prone to making mischief, often spreading dirt out of spite or simply by wasting away. One should be vigilant for such things, for more dust and debris creates the perfect environment for new dust bunnies to form, and one can quickly be overrun with an infestation of dust bunnies!</p>
                   <p><strong>Dust Bunny<br>
                      Construct<br>
                      Required Number of Abilities</strong> 4</p>
                   <p><strong>Granted Abilities</strong> construct, independent, play dead (<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</em> 124), skilled (arcana)<br><strong>Kick Up Dust</strong> [two-actions] (manipulate) <strong>Frequency </strong>once per hour; <strong>Effect </strong>Your dust bunny shakes and kicks to stir up dust in a 5-foot emanation. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. A creature that fails its save begins sneezing uncontrollably and is slowed 1 and cannot take reactions for 1 round; on a critical failure they are slowed 2.</p>
                   <h3>Dust Bunny Swarm</h3>
                   <p>Dust bunnies in particular are prone to swarming. This can occur when a large number are left alone for a long period of time and are then disturbed by adventurers or a returning wizard. Other times, a singular dust bunny familiar grows in such numbers (and they will rapidly reproduce!) that a wizard cannot hope to keep them all placated with food and attention. In this situation, they will unionize in rebellion against their master.</p>
                   <p>It is paramount that you do not allow a dust bunny to multiply, for once a swarm has formed, they are nigh impossible to get rid of. While relatively easy to disperse and unlikely to kill anyone, they will re-form within the week unless the area is immaculately cleaned.</p>
                   <p><strong>Dust Bunny Swarm Creature 1<br></strong><strong>Rare, Large, Construct, Swarm<br></strong><strong>Perception </strong>+7<br><strong>Skills</strong> Arcana, Athletics +3, Stealth +7<br><strong>Str</strong> +0, <strong>Dex</strong> +2, <strong>Con</strong> +0, <strong>Int</strong> –4, <strong>Wis</strong> +0, <strong>Cha</strong> +2<br><strong>AC</strong> 13; <strong>Fort </strong>+7, <strong>Ref </strong>+5, <strong>Will </strong>+3</p>

Creatures who enter or start their turn in this cloud must attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a –1 circumstance penalty to skill checks that have the concentration trait and all Perception checks as their sensory organs become impaired.</p>
                   <p><strong>Dust to Dust</strong> When a dust bunny swarm is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days in the area in which it was destroyed unless the location has been significantly cleaned of all dust and debris.</p>

                   <p><strong>Pummeling Dust</strong> [one-action] Each enemy in the swarm’s space takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage with a DC 16 basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save cannot use reactions for 1 round as they sneeze uncontrollably.</p>

                   <h2>Venture-Gossip (Archetype)</h2>
                   <h3>Shay Snow</h3>
                   <p>Venture-Gossip is not only the name of a beloved agent of the Pathfinder Society who has dedicated herself to bringing <em>all</em> of the lurid, gruesome stories to Absalom’s streets—it’s also the name of a popular tabloid newsletter that appears across Golarion, primarily wherever there’s a Pathfinder Society lodge. There isn’t just one venture-gossip: there are hundreds. Hundreds of Pathfinders with loads of stories and rumors that they collect and then forward along to the Ink Worker’s United Printing Press, a unionized printing press based out of Absalom. Formally, only one name is associated with Venture-Gossip: Agent Kitsch of the Office of Supplies and Procurement. However, no one truly believes that she’s behind any of this, as the older ysoki is known to misplace just about everything, from poison flasks to important cursed artifacts.</p>
                   <p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong><strong>4th</strong> Distracting Flattery (<em>Player Core </em>2 195), Gossip Lore (<em>Player Core 2 </em>195); <strong>7th</strong> Fabricated Connections (<em>Player Core 2 </em>195), Party Crasher (<em>Player Core 2 </em>195), Quick Change (<em>Player Core 2</em> 219), Read Shibboleths (<em>Player Core 2</em> 203), Subjective Truth (<em>Player Core 2</em> 219), <strong>8th</strong> Crude Communication (<em>Player Core 2 </em>203)</p>
                   <p><strong>Venture-Gossip Dedication — Feat 4<br></strong> <strong>Archetype, Dedication, Pathfinder Agent<br></strong> <strong>Prerequisites</strong> member of the Pathfinder Society, Pathfinder Agent Dedication</p>
                   <p>Look, the motto of the Pathfinder Society is “explore, report, cooperate” and you’re just reporting what you hear! Is all of it accurate or true? Maybe not, but hey, you can tell a great story and you know how to keep your readers hooked and eating out of the palm of your hand. Ambrus Valsin of the Grand Lodge may disapprove of your methods, but hey, he’s not your real boss.</p>
                   <p>Eando isn’t either.</p>
                   <p>We’ll go with Zarta.</p>
                   <p>Wait, no, Sheila. Sheila appreciates a good gossip column. You’re now from Magnimar. Always have been.</p>
                   <p>You have two identities: your day job as a Pathfinder agent, and your real job, one of the many voices that make up the Venture-Gossip tabloid. If someone attempts to figure out if you’re a venture-gossip, they must use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against one of your influence skills of your choice: Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation. Your DC is 20 + your proficiency modifier.</p>
                   <p>If you are discovered to be part of Venture-Gossip, you can spend 1 week of downtime convincing others that you’ve never even <em>read</em> that tabloid, much less contributed to it!</p>
                   <p>You gain the following action, allowing you to collect more information for your column.</p>
                   <p><strong>Tell Me More</strong> [two-actions] (fortune) <strong>Target</strong> one creature that shares a language you speak; <strong>Requirements</strong> You’re not in combat; <strong>Effect</strong> Just batting your eyes and giving someone a familiar nudge can get them talking, ready to spill the beans about everything and everyone around them. You roll twice on all rolls to influence the target and use the better result.</p>
                   <p><strong>Special </strong>You can select the dedication feat for this archetype even if you haven’t yet gained three feats from the Pathfinder Agent archetype.</p>
                   <p><strong>Verbose Distraction [reaction] — Feat 6<br></strong> <strong>Archetype, Auditory<br></strong> <strong>Prerequisites</strong> Venture-Gossip Archetype<br><strong>Trigger </strong>You are the target of a physical melee attack.<br>
                    You talk so much it can be distracting to your enemies and you’re often quick to remind your enemies that you’re just a little guy! You don’t need to be targeted! You don’t need to be the focus of their frustrations! Have they tried writing to their mom or talking to a local priest of Desna? Ow!<br>
                     You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against the triggering attack.</p>
                   <p><strong>Hey! Over Here! [reaction] — Feat 6<br></strong><strong>Archetype, Auditory<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Venture-Gossip Archetype<br><strong>Trigger </strong>An ally within 30 feet rolls a saving throw against an auditory effect.<br>
                    Hey! Don’t listen to that! That’s bad sounds! Listen to me! Would you like to hear about how the high priest of the Abadaran church in Absalom’s Petals District is having an affair with an Urgathoan cleric? Yeah, I’m thinking about calling the article “Boney Money!”<br>
                    Your targeted ally treats the result of their saving throw as one degree of success better. Once an ally has been targeted by this effect, they’re immune for 24 hours.</p>
                   <p><strong>A Little Bird Told Me... [two-actions] — Feat 8<br></strong><strong>Archetype, Concentrate, Manipulate, Polymorph<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Venture-Gossip Archetype<br>
                    You transform into a small bird, such as a finch or a sparrow, allowing you to eavesdrop on others and gain information you wouldn’t otherwise be able to acquire. You become Tiny, gain the animal trait, and you can’t make Strikes. You can Dismiss the effect to return to your normal shape, and you resume your normal shape automatically if you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points.<br>
                    You gain the following statistics and abilities:<br>

                   <p><strong>Define “Report” [free-action] — Feat 10<br></strong><strong>Archetype, Fortune<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Venture-Gossip Archetype; master in Diplomacy<br>
                    Look, getting caught in a lie is a normal part of venture-gossip life. Sometimes you have to give a sheepish smile and apologize for what you’ve done. When you fail a Deception check, reroll with your Diplomacy modifier. On a success, there are no hard feelings and the other person’s attitude condition doesn’t worsen. On a critical success, you can attempt the Deception again with no consequences.</p>
                   <p><strong>Catch and Kill [reaction] — Feat 12<br></strong><strong>Archetype<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Venture-Gossip Archetype<br><strong>Trigger </strong>A creature within your reach uses a move action, or leaves a square during a move action it’s using.<br>
                    When you’ve decided to quash a story, no one can escape from you with any incriminating information. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. On a hit, the triggering creature is Grabbed, and on a critical hit, they’re slowed 1. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.</p>
                   <p><strong>Muckraking [three-actions]&nbsp;<strong>—</strong> Feat 16<br></strong><strong>Archetype, Auditory, Concentrate, Emotion, Mental<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Venture-Gossip Archetype<br>
                    It seems like your knowledge has come in handy after all and you have your enemy at your feet. Pulling out your fan mail, you read your fans’ scathing remarks about your enemy to their face, letting them feel just how much everyone hates them and everything that they’ve done. They hate the way that they walk, they hate the way that they talk.<br>
                    Your enemy takes 10d10 mental damage, with a basic Will save. On a critical failure, they’re off-guard until the beginning of your next turn and lose all reactions, except to cry, loudly.</p>

                   <h2>Rt5rrmn</h2>
                   <p><em>It seems that every time I roll dice my cat Auryn feels that he must help, same as he loves to type to others when I am working online. So, I decided to put him to work, helping to create a creature based on his adorable face that could hopefully play with others around the world. The result is the creature found below. (Most numbers were decided by him, and all special ability names were decided by him <s>walking across</s> typing on my keyboard.)</em></p>
                   <h3><em>Ivis Flanagan</em></h3>
                   <p>The rt5rrmn is a catlike creature that loves to purr at those they encounter, convincing others to pamper them instead of fight. It would rather be friends than enemies, but if spooked it will viciously attack whoever is in its sights. If they aren’t able to make friends, the rt5rrmn will quickly grow defensive, and leap to attack.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>Rt5rrmn&nbsp;— Creature 8<br></strong><strong>Small, Animal, Fey<br></strong><strong>Perception </strong>+20; scent (imprecise) 60 feet<br><strong>Languages </strong>Common (can’t speak any language)<br><strong>Skills </strong>Athletics +20, Acrobatics +22, Stealth +17<br><strong>Str</strong> +5, <strong>Dex</strong> +3, <strong>Con</strong> +4, <strong>Int</strong> +1, <strong>Wis</strong> +1, <strong>Cha</strong> +6<br><strong>AC </strong>36; <strong>Fort </strong>+15, <strong>Ref </strong>+35, <strong>Will </strong>+22<br><strong>HP </strong>172</p>
                   <p><strong>But I’m Adorable </strong>[reaction] <strong>Trigger </strong>An enemy targets the rt5rrmn with a melee attack; <strong>Effect </strong>The rt5rrmn erkijs, the vibrating sound convincing the enemy to stop hurting it. The target must attempt a DC 26 Will save.<br><strong>Critical Success </strong>The target is unaffected, ignoring the seduction of the erkij.<br><strong>Success </strong>The target is fascinated by the rt5rrmn’s erkij until the end of the rt5rrmn’s next turn.&nbsp;<br><strong>Failure </strong>As success, and the target is slowed 1 as it focuses on the rt5rrmn’s erkij.<br><strong>Critical Failure </strong>As failure, but the target is slowed 2.</p>
                   <p><strong>Extra Reverberation </strong>If the rt5rrmn is targeted with an ability that restores Hit Points, it gains an additional use of But I’m Adorable that lasts until the end of its next turn.</p>
                   <p><strong>Speed </strong>35 feet<br><strong>Melee </strong>[one-action] b9000 (finesse), <strong>Damage </strong>3d8+12 piercing plus Improved Grab<br><strong>Melee </strong>[one-action] g7ujik (agile, finesse), <strong>Damage </strong>3d6+12 slashing, plus rt5rrmn yyumn</p>
                   <p><strong>Pay Attention to Me </strong>[two-actions] The rt5rrmn erkijs again at a creature that is affected by But I’m Adorable. The target must attempt a DC 26 Will save.&nbsp;<br><strong>Success </strong>The target is unaffected.<br><strong>Failure </strong>The target creature drops all of its held weapons.<br><strong>Critical Failure </strong>As failure, but the target must also spend the first action of its next turn petting the rt5rrmn.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><strong>Yidsfh</strong> [two-actions] The rt5rrmn Strides and then makes two g7ujik Strikes at a single target. Both count toward its multiple attack penalty, but the penalty increases only after both attacks are made. The rt5rrmn must be able to move at least half its Speed to yidsfh.</p>
                   <p><strong>Rt5rrmn Yyumn </strong>(disease) <strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude DC 24; <strong>Maximum Duration</strong> 1 week; <strong>Stage 1</strong> sickened 1 (1 hour); <strong>Stage 2</strong> sickened 1 and the creature can't reduce its sickened value below 1 (1 day); <strong>Stage 3</strong> sickened 2 and the creature can't reduce its sickened value below 1 (1 day)</p>

                     March is Women’s History Month here in the United States, and to celebrate and recognize the women who make our games happen, we’ve welcomed Paizo contributors who identify as women (inclusive of trans, cis, and nonbinary identities) to share their experiences, wisdom, and projects on the blog!</p>
                   <p>This year’s theme for Women’s History Month is “Moving Forward Together—Women Educating and Inspiring Generations.” Some of our contributors have used this theme to shape their submissions.</p>

                   <h3>Ivis Flanagan (she/they)</h3>
                   <p>Have you ever looked up to someone and said, “I could NEVER do that?” I know I have.<br><br>
                    I spent years having the boys I hung out with beat into my head that “girls just can’t play RPGs” by repeatedly ensuring my characters died every time I joined them. Then, years later, one of my closest friends, Sean Duncan, pulled me out of a nap and into my first Pathfinder game. I fell in love with it, from the mechanics to the setting—all of it. Then some friends encouraged me to go to my first convention, where I meant Heather Vigil, the first female GM I’d ever seen, and I thought, “Wow, I could never do that.” She and I became fast friends, and she was the one who eventually convinced me I was good enough to GM—which I again fell in love with, soon after becoming a Venture Agent in Organized Play.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>This attitude of “I could never do that” continued to precede me as I volunteered for conventions, then started taking on more and more leadership roles in Organized Play until I became the first female RVC (there's been two more since!). It was through this work that I met some amazing femme people: Hillary Moon Murphy, Kate Baker, Isis Woz, Katrina Hennessy, and Jessica Redekop, to name just a few. They encouraged me to reach out and start sharing my writing, which allowed me to get my foot in the door and contribute to the works of multiple companies, including Paizo.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>Fast forward to last year, when Paizo posted a designer position with the Rules and Lore team. Again, my brain flipped back to the old belief that “I could never do that,” a thought put there all those years ago by that group of gatekeeping guys. However, with encouragement from the same friends who had supported me along the way, and with the support of a few new ones like Alex Speidel and Shay Snow, I decided to throw the proverbial snowball into hell and see where it went. Asmodeus likes snow cones, it seems, because against all the odds in my brain, here I am, the newest member of the Rules and Lore team, loving what I do every day.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>I tell you my journey to say this: gaming is for everyone, and in supporting each other, we will see this space and our representation in it continue to flourish. More than anything, I’ve learned that to properly break down barriers to inclusivity, we can’t just say we support one another—we have to show it. And you know what? It’s true: girls don’t just play games—we run them, we organize them, and we create them, too. If you ever want to reach out, either for encouragement or because you’d like help finding ways to get involved, my DMs are open. You can find me on Bluesky, Discord, and the Paizo Forums as NorthernDreamer.&nbsp;</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Katrina Hennessy (she/they)</h3>
                   <p>I’d like to take a moment or two to highlight some women who have influenced me and helped me to be where I am today.</p>
                   <p>The less open-minded mother of one of my high school friends said to her one day, “I know there is a science fiction convention in town, but you’re not going!” This drove my wonderful, open-minded, and supportive mother to organize a small group of us to attend Swancon 2, the second annual science fiction convention in Western Australia. There, we were introduced to the relatively new game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and met Uma, who was welcoming and supportive of us teens and a gracious example of how to exist in this male-dominated industry.</p>
                   <p>While there were other women along the way, as I played various RPGs through the decades, they were not frequent. In 2017, when I was introduced to Paizo Organized Play, this changed. Dorothy was one of my first GMs and a role model on how to be a firm and fair Game Master while remaining welcoming newcomers and making sure they received appropriate guidance. I also met Hilary, an exuberant and fun GM who was active at spreading Play-by-Post and good at turning insufficient reluctance into an active Venture Officer. There was also Kate, who was not only a great GM but an active freelancer who encouraged others along that path.</p>
                   <p>Over the course of these years, I also came across Vanessa, whom I first met as a roommate at Origins and who has helped me in so many ways to break my own barriers and grow as a community member and as a freelancer. She set an example of hard work and integrity in the games industry as freelancer, Paizo Developer, and now with Wizards of the Coast. I would also like to mention Ivis and Nicole, who actively participated in so much and took on more and more while remaining friendly, supportive, and welcoming. Though life seems to have moved Nicole elsewhere, I observed as Ivis continued to blossom and is now a Paizo developer.</p>
                   <p>I thank each of them and the many others who have had a positive impact on me along the way. I strive to also be welcoming and supportive of all who wish to play, GM, write, or otherwise be involved in our wonderful gaming community.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Sara Jeffers (she/they/he)</h3>
                   <p>Sara Jeffers is a Two-Spirit member of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, in what is now known as Washington and British Columbia. Their heritage and culture influence not only her graphic and narrative designs but also his approaches in problem-solving and community building. She is proud to be a Woman in Gaming and to be helping&nbsp;the next generation of creatives through Girl Scouts.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Lynne M. Meyer (she/they)</h3>
                   <p>When I found out about&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder</em><em>Lost Omens Rival Academies</em>, I jumped at the chance to be Edit Co-Lead. Working on the book was a way of going back to my professional roots. For over a decade, I worked in higher education as an interfaith, service learning, and diversity and inclusion educator—a role that included developing and implementing training programs for students (and sometimes staff) as well as directly supporting students of marginalized identities. Though I enjoyed being in the classroom, what I loved most was working with students one-on-one. When I was in college, I had a mentor whose support changed my life; once I was in the position to do the same for my students, it became the driving force of my career.</p>
                   <p>I left university life years ago, but the relationships remain. I’ve kept every letter and card I received at graduation or other milestones, and I’m still close to several of my former students. Few things bring me such joy as seeing them thrive out in the world as the leaders and changemakers I knew they could be.</p>

                   <p>Spring is coming, the air is warming, the ice is melting, and Cheliax wants to help with all of this, starting in Egorian! The Pathfinder Society receives word from the illustrious Varian Jeggare that his manor is being invaded by a mixture of Hellknights and the Egorian dottari patrol. The Pathfinders will need to sneak into his home and not only recover a few important artifacts, but they’ll also need to save his loyal staff members! While they work to avoid hellish attention, however, some of Thrune’s most canny agents watch them from afar, ready to pounce when the timing is just right.</p>

                   <p>We’ve got an adventure straight out of Druma. Considering how rarely we get out there, it’s a great opportunity for those who love traveling to check another nation off your list. It’s also an excellent chance to investigate an ancient treasure trove newly uncovered by a small earthquake and landslide. It’s a vault long thought lost, located near the mining operations of Marivit Kopje, a Kalistocrat of minor standing.</p>
                   <p>Well, treasure trove might be a matter of perspective. You see, Shimia Renveld was an oddity even among Kalistocrats. She collected odds and ends that she believed held no real monetary value. But Marivit believes that her recently uncovered collection might hold a key to helping turn around his fortunes, and he's promised the Pathfinders everything else in the vault in order to get it. That’s where you come in. Explored vaults sealed for centuries tend to have unknown dangers. I guess what I’m trying to say is “good luck.”</p>

                   <h2>Character Options Updates</h2>
                   <p>Last week saw the release of two major Pathfinder books, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq09mal?Pathfinder-NPC-Core"><em>NPC Core</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq09ho9?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Rival-Academies"><em>Lost Omens: Rival Academies</em></a>. Both books are listed on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>, and boons for some options (including community-favorite <em>500 toads</em>) are available in the Boon Store!</p>
                   <p>We’ve also released sanctioning documents for the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurepath/sporewar">Spore War Adventure Path</a>, which are available on the AP product pages. You can now fight Treerazer and earn Pathfinder Society credit while doing so!</p>
                   <p>The next major Character Options updates will come in May with the release of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq08pw5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Shining-Kingdoms"><em>Lost Omens: Shining Kingdoms</em></a>, as well as the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq07vsk?Starfinder-Galaxy-Guide"><em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em></a>. Two ancestries from the latter, the contemplative and dragonkin, will be available to those of you who have participated in the Starfinder Playtest as outlined on the <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/StarfinderPlaytest_TrackingSheet.pdf">Playtest Tracking Sheet</a>, so we’ll be sure to provide guidance on those options upon release.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had three GMs reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Michael Johnson, David Li, Avram Suson</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Conventions</h2>
                   <p>Spring has sprung, and with it, convention season! Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Conventions calendar</a> for upcoming events in your area. At press time we have more than a dozen events in the next couple of months, all looking for players and GMs!</p>
                   <p>This month, I will be attending <strong>Coscon</strong> in Butler, PA (just outside my hometown of Pittsburgh!) as well as <strong>GalaxyCon Richmond</strong> in Virginia. If you’re in the area for either of these, I’d love to say hi! Additionally, the day after PaizoCon I’ll be hopping on a plane to Birmingham for the <strong>UK Games Expo</strong>. Looking for a Paizo staff visit this fall? Drop me an email and let me know about your event; my contemplative gunslinger just might stop by!</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Until next time adventurers—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And indulge in sin responsibly!</p>

                   <p>I’ll kick us off! I’m <b>Logan Bonner</b> (he/him), Pathfinder Lead Designer and the design lead on <em>NPC Core</em>. I shepherded the crew through pitching and picking levels for the NPCs, and most of my actual writing on the book was stitching things together and occasionally filling in some extra space. The best medium social to interact with me is on Bluesky, where I’m <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/loganbonner.bsky.social">@loganbonner.bsky.social</a>. (Please note that I’m happy to talk about the game, but I don’t answer rules questions on social media!)</p>
                   <p>Now let’s hear from some of our other esteemed authors!</p>
                   <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h3>
                   <p>I am so excited to see <em>NPC Core</em>ending up in your hands! I worked on the NPC Connections subsystem in the appendix. One of the priorities I had while designing that subsystem was making it flexible for a wide range of relationships, especially since some of my most notable gaming stories involved the various NPCs that my group cared for along the way. I hope this is a tool that helps out at your table.</p>

                   <p>Hello, I'm Katina! You might have seen me on the forums as Paizo's Webstore Coordinator, or playing in some of our streamed games. I've also been lucky enough to contribute to several Pathfinder and Starfinder products since 2017, and I was delighted to write the gnomes for <em>NPC Core</em>. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the eccentric rainbow-haired ancestry who blanches if they don't experience enough wonder in life, and I hope that connection shines through in this book. You can find <a href="https://katinawritesstuff.com/FreelanceWriting.html">a full list of my TTRPG writing credits here</a>, and connect with me on Bluesky at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/katinadavis.bsky.social">@KatinaDavis</a>.</p>

By day, they work as Paizo's Marketing &amp; Media Specialist, managing marketing projects and serving as a point of contact for news media, reviewers, and content creators—you've probably seen him around on the Paizo blog and forums! By all other hours, Rue does a variety of freelance and consulting work, including work on the upcoming <em>Daggerheart RPG</em> from Darrington Press! Rue was thrilled to add their voice to the Mystics in <em>NPC Core</em>! As a home practitioner of traditional Romani and Arapaho spiritualism and magic, Rue enjoyed getting to bring some of those elements to the NPCs in this book, as well as add some fun flavor options!</p>

                   <p>Hello again everyone! It was such a pleasure to have worked alongside so many talented writers for&nbsp;<em>NPC Core</em>. Seeing the Phalanx Formation, one of the NPCs that I wrote for this book, on stream was definitely a surprise, but a welcome one for sure! The other NPCs that I had a blast writing were the standard bearer, sniper, and mage knight, and I also wrote the Military Objectives section right after the statblocks. I honestly cannot wait to add all of the NPCs I wrote, in addition to a bunch of the other ones in this book, into my homebrew game.</p>
                   <p>Also, be sure to check out some of the other Pathfinder 2E material that I've written alongside some other fantastic authors at <a href="https://www.eldritchosirisgames.com/">Eldritch Osiris Games</a>!</p>
                   <h3>Katrina Hennessy (she/they)</h3>
                   <p>Hello, all. I am thrilled to have contributed to this book. I hope you enjoy the tengu section. I also hope players will enjoy the language of feathers and tengu expressions finding fun ways to incorporate them into their characters. This was my first Pathfinder assignment for Paizo, though my contribution to <em>Curtain Call</em> made it to print sooner. I have also written some Starfinder Society adventures and made a few contributions to third-party products. I’d like to thank the entire team who made this project a success, particularly Logan Bonner for leading the way. While I am not very active on social media, the best place to find me is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gmnumbat.bsky.social">@gmnumbat.bsky.social</a>. I can also be found playing or running games for Paizo Organized Play.</p>
                   <h3>Sara Jeffers (she/they/he)</h3>
                   <p>Sara Jeffers is a Two-Spirit member of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, in what is now known as Washington and British Columbia. Their heritage and culture influence not only her graphic and narrative designs but also his approaches in problem-solving and community building.</p>

                   <h3>Michelle Jones (she/her)</h3>
                   <p>What's up gamers, my name is Michelle Jones and I wrote several of the villains presented in <em>NPC Core</em>, including the fiend caller, fleshwarper, and hero hunter. I hope you and your tables have many fun, terrifying, horrible times encountering them. Hopefully they don't kill too many of you. Good luck!</p>

                   <h3>Christiana Lewis (she/her)</h3>
                   <p>Hey there! This is my second project with Pathfinder and it's extremely dear to me. As a BIPOC author, getting to write lore about orcs and half-orcs was... healing. When I'm not writing, I'm reading fantasy books bigger than my head, crocheting wonky dragons, and maining Sue Storm on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. I'd like to thank my husband, Josh, for always inspiring me to be brave and ensuring I'm hydrated. And to you, reader—I hope this book brings about some of the best roleplay you've ever seen. May the dice be ever in your favor!</p>

                   <h3>Jacob W. Michaels (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Hi, I’m Jacob W. Michaels. You may know me from such Paizo projects like <em>PFS 5-08: Protecting the Firelight</em> and <em>PFS 6-00: Salt of the Ocean</em>, plus my work in various Pathfinder rulebooks and Lost Omens titles. I got to work on everyone’s favorite goblins for <em>NPC Core</em> and I can’t wait for them to be unleashed on your unsuspecting players! Also, this book has my first published recipe, which you will hopefully like more than my wife did during our many taste tests (fun fact: She only likes pickled cucumbers, while I like everything pickled <b>except</b> cucumbers).</p>

                   <h3>Matt Morris (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few third-party companies. I'm currently awaiting the launch of my first Kickstarter, a TTRPG called <a href="https://www.remnantyears.com"><em>Remnant Years: Tales of a Ruined Land</em></a>.</p>
                   <p>I made friends with some mystics for this book, and I've still got pockets full of wooden beads, iron nails, and garlic! (And only a few minor curses.)</p>
                   <p>I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to contact me if you are looking for a reliable writer!</p>
                   <p>When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

                   <p>Hi, I'm Patchen Mortimer (he/him). Ever since writing the lizardfolk ancestry for <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em> (recently revised in <em>Player Core 2</em>), I'm always <em>thrilled</em> when the Pathfinder team invites me to flesh out our scaly friends a little more. In this book, I wanted both GMs and players to find plenty of fresh hooks to inspire their own play, from new myths and superstitions to musical stylings. And sure, some PCs might get harpooned (trident-ed?) along the way—whoops! As a new father, I'm hard to find these days, but try @patchdj on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/patchdj.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> or <a href="https://x.com/patchdj">Twitter's corpse</a>, or listen to my indie rock radio show most Tuesday nights at <a href="https://wmuc.umd.edu">https://wmuc.umd.edu</a>.</p>

                   <p>Whispered tales passed down through the ages tell of a time when I darkened the hallowed halls of Paizo alongside the esteemed editing team—but that was long ago. My foul deeds have been attributed to many names; the one you likely know best is K. Tessa Newton (she/they). For the <em>NPC Core</em>, I (alongside Michelle Jones) described that cadre of knaves I know best: the villains!</p>
                   <p>This assignment was actually quite a challenge. Villains defined by their “job” (like an evil pirate captain, a corrupt judge, etc.) would go in those other sections instead, leaving us to muse on the fundamental aspects of villainy. We hope you like the evildoers we came up with and use them to ruin players' days for years to come!</p>

                   <p>Приветствую, уважаемые читатели!* My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m a Russian-speaking Ukrainian-American historian, educator, and author. I’ve been writing for Pathfinder for a fair few years now, so if you’ve ever been attacked by a kholo, it’s probably my fault. I’m sorry. (I’m not sorry).</p>
                   <p>For my crimes, I’ve spent a goodly while in academia, and so it was natural that I’d end up writing the Scholars section of this book. In absolute honesty, most of the new NPCs are just lightly fictionalized versions of myself and my old colleagues (I rather fancy that I’m an avuncular professor these days, though I spent many years as an exuberant apprentice).</p>
                   <p>If you find my writing to be amusing and/or traumatic-college-flashback-inducing, you may also be interested to learn that I’m the Creative Director of the <a href="https://luminant-age.itch.io">Luminant Age Campaign Setting</a>. We have plenty of peculiar and particular academic material there, with more on the way. Give it a look!</p>

                   <p>I'm a longtime contributor to Pathfinder and Starfinder (this is about my 60th original release) on projects like <em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em> or the<em>Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</em> for 5e. When I'm not writing or editing for Paizo or various other RPG publishers, I’m a fan of archery and folklore and also support groups for game designers (such as Freelance Forge) and the LGBT community. In <em>NPC Core</em>, I'm proud to have helped this distinguished team with new officers and amurruns (catfolk). My officers are combatants and inquisitives, tricky foes abusing authority (especially the grand inquisitor), or useful allies. The catfolk I imagine as braggart rivals or enthusiastic allies.

                   <p>Hi, my name is <b>Tony Saunders</b>! I am one of the co-founders of Team+, which is where I spend most of my time writing these days. I was an author on <em>War of Immortals</em> and have been credited on Legendary Games titles, <em>Battlezoo Bestiary: Strange and Unusual</em>, the <em>Gardener's Guide to Gaming</em>, and a few other projects. What time I don't spend being a software engineer and father, I spend writing. I wrote for the companion section for this book. Lucky to be a part of such a stacked team of authors.</p>

                   <p>Hi! I'm <b>Joel Southall</b> (he/him), and I’ve had the pleasure of writing for <em>NPC Core</em>, where I crafted stats and lore for a few NPCs, drawing on my studies in Indigenous philosophy and myth, as well as literary influences ranging from Shakespeare and Mark Twain to J.R.R. Tolkien. I also contributed to <em>Starfinder Bounty #9: Burning Ambition </em> and served as a cultural consultant for Paizo on a monster inspired by Ojibwe legend, informed by my Ojibwe heritage and knowledge of Indigenous lore and practices. Additionally, I wrote for the IndieCade 2019 award-winning educational computer game <em>When Rivers Were Trails</em>, which explores Indigenous resilience during the era of the federally mandated General Allotment Act of 1887.</p>
                   <p>With a background in journalism and a Master’s-level education in philosophy, I’ve transitioned into web and software development but remain passionate about game development. I live in Eugene, Oregon, and frequently collaborate on both local and remote game projects.

                   <p>Hello! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her), frequent contributor to Paizo. Some of my recent work has been on <em>Singer, Stalker, Skinsaw Man</em> for Curtain Call, <em>Destroyer's Doom</em> for Triumph of the Tusk, and the upcoming <em>The Acropolis Pyre</em> for Myth-Speaker, as well as a section in <em>Rival Academies</em>! For <em>NPC Core</em>, I wrote the section on elves, and I enjoyed delving into various aspects of elven cultures, from the more woodsy and jungle ranger types to elves of elegant noble courts. The book's stat blocks will definitely be useful to GMs, but I also love the little lore tidbits for the groups and ancestries, which I think will really add a lot of depth to encounters with these folks. My favorites of mine are a small snippet about enemies-to-lovers scholar rivals (some academia gossip crept into this project, too!) and a table of elven banquet dishes that I hope makes you as hungry reading as it did me writing!</p>

I was thrilled to contribute the kobold section for <em>NPC Core</em>, as I love these scheming little reptiles in all their forms.

For this particular project, I had a blast (pun not intended, but now that I see it, I’m leaving it in) writing up a whole bunch of bomb-throwing hobgoblin and steampunky engineer entries, including two of my favorite fantasy archetypes: “dangerous lunatic in power armor with freeze ray” and “even more dangerous lunatic who flies around with the help of a tank of explosive rocket fuel strapped to their back”.

I was particularly excited by this project because my producer Landon Winkler basically gave me a carte blanche to imagine what the school is like. I got to invent its arcane bureaucratic systems, create esoteric areas of research, and visualize the weird architecture of this unusual institution. Plus, I got to toss in some bees.

                   <p>Hi, I'm Laura Lynn Horst! You've seen my work in the recent <em>Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</em> where I focused on the Azlanti gods and Urgathoa. I am so excited for the release of <em>Lost Omens Rival Academies</em>. Working on this latest Paizo project was so fun and I can't wait for you all to enjoy the spoils of our hard work. I hope you all enjoy the Synostosis representative, Zenda Modic. I thoroughly enjoyed writing her.</p>

                   <p>It’s me again! For <em>Lost Omens Rival Academies,</em> I was tasked with bringing Messida Vost, an NPC who debuted all the way back in a first edition adventure, forward to second edition in her new role as the Acadamae's Dean of Summoning. I think it’s safe to say that of all the faculty they can meet in this book, your players might just find Vost the most abrasive. (Although, who among us hasn’t known a teacher like that?) She does, however, come bearing some ambitious—if dangerous—ideas about how best to solve the Sarkoris Scar’s demon problem. If you end up using her in your game, I’d love to hear all about it on social media (@breadbutt) or Discord (breadbutt_).</p>

                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Дорогие читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m a Russian-speaking Ukrainian-American author, educator, and renegade academic. Having plumbed the depths of the Dark Archive, I thought I was safe. But no. There is no safety from academia.</p>
                   <p>I was responsible for the University of Lepidstadt in this book, because for some peculiar reason everyone looked at the creepy gothic school and immediately went “this is a Mikhail thing.” It is possible I have a reputation. We will politely skip over what sort. In any case, like any proper school, Lepidstadt has its share of secret passages, ghosts, mysteries, crumbling papers, unresolved murders, ghosts, architects who entombed themselves within their own work, hoary old secrets, raven statues, ancient cursed relics, Prof. Nefritius-Sincoth, ghosts, evil books, disappearing rooms, and most terrifying of all—university politics.</p>
                   <p>Also ghosts. Just, like, so many ghosts.</p>
                   <p>In the event that you survive your term at Lepidstadt with psyche and/or bank account intact, you may try the post-graduate course at the <a href="https://luminant-age.itch.io/">Luminant Age Campaign Setting</a>, where I happen to be the Creative Director. We have a medical student dissecting angels over there. It's going about as well as you'd expect.</p>

                   <p>I’m Erin Roberts, previously seen in books including <em>Divine Mysteries</em>, <em>Firebrands</em>, <em>Highhelm</em>, and <em>Godsrain Prophecies</em>. I currently teach at a university, so I was thrilled to get a chance to be a part of the hallowed halls pages of <em>Rival Academies</em>. I wrote the Academy of the Reclamation, getting the assignment just as I was settling into a writing residency in Homer, Alaska alongside five writers working on reclamations of their own, from memoirs of half-remembered childhoods and stories about the echoes left by those lost to violence to a new work of art made using traditional techniques in an act of cultural restoration. Those experiences lingered as I wrote this section, inspired by the ways we can be shaped by what we’ve lost, take strength from what we’ve held on to, and build toward what we dream of against all odds. Also the delicious snacks. I always write better with snacks.</p>

                   <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3>
                   <p>Hello, I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, frequent contributor to Paizo and erstwhile academic—I did a master's degree for library science and loved it, I but staunchly shooed off anyone who suggested I go for the PhD. (For the curious, I went to school in London, did my dissertation on the interplay between libraries and imperialism in 19th-century Britain, and took four months after graduation to stop defaulting to UK spellings.)</p>
                   <p>Given all that, I was delighted to be asked on for <em>Rival Academies</em>! I did the Cobyslarni section of the book, where I had a great deal of fun working in fey weirdness and shenanigans. Cobyslarni has fascinated me ever since its first mention in 1e, and expanding on it was a dream assignment. My love of libraries definitely influenced the Echo Repository, home of (literally) forgotten knowledge, and the art for Murrou, an awakened emu grad student with excellent sartorial taste, is one of my favorite pieces in the whole book. I hope you all enjoy the chance to explore the school—and maybe even form a pact with Cobyslarni himself!</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone! I’ve been a contributor to Paizo since 2023, and while this is my first book with Pathfinder, I’ve been a writer and storyteller in many forms for most of my life. For this project I had the honor of creating one of the invitees—Nochtli Tlatoa, your new favorite distractible arcane botanist—as well as her luminescent toadstool. I hope you find her as brilliant (get it!) and helpful as I intended! When I’m not writing, I’m working as a therapist by day and an actual play performer and voice actor by night (and you can find more of my work <a href="https://beacons.ai/ohheyitsgina_">here</a>!).

                   <h3>Tan Shao Han (he/they)</h3>
                   <p>Appropriately enough, I'm writing my author blog for <em>Lost Omens Rival Academies</em> during my commute to teach across several, here's the title drop, rival academies, in Singapore.</p>
                   <p>As the years murmur one after another, I find myself shifting from ambivalence to acceptance in my academic role. Some of these aspirations and tensions are nestled inside my words; for example, my emotions are echoed within the indulgences and affectations of the narrator's pride, in the section on the Monastery of the Unbreaking Waves.</p>
                   <p>On Water; a little allegory about the Lessons of Perfection.</p>
                   <p>The more things change...</p>
                   <p>As a child, I was neither a competent nor confident student; my grades were poor, and my self-esteem poorer still. I am grateful I was somehow accepted into university, where I found solace in study, reading and listening to voices, present and bygone, sharing and discussing knowledge we've built and lost.</p>
                   <p>In these voices, I sometimes beheld kindness and wisdom; I can only hope, in some way, to be a similar voice to students struggling amidst today's demands and pressures, in societies often so intensely indifferent and unforgiving.</p>
                   <p>Appropriate, perhaps, for Water’s Lessons of Perfection.</p>
                   <p>…the more things stay the same?</p>

                   <h3>Esther Wallace (she/her, zhe/zher)</h3>
                   <p>Hi y'all! I'm Esther, and I'm so delighted that I had the opportunity to write for this book. This was my first-ever assignment for Paizo, and I had the joy of writing Aesara Fleethoof! Since Aesara is from Iblydos, I took a lot of inspiration from Homeric epic for her background, character, and patterns of speech. If you ever use her in a campaign setting, feel welcome to tag me on social media and tell me about it—I’m <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dungeonminister.bsky.social">@dungeonminister</a>on Bluesky. I had such a blast writing on this book alongside so many amazing authors, and I can’t wait to dig into the setting and material myself. Cheers to all who helped this project come together!</p>

                   <p>Treerazer’s plans have been disrupted by heroes, and the fiendish war against the elves isn’t going as swiftly as the demon hoped... which makes him all the more dangerous.

The Spore War Adventure Path concludes with “A Voice in the Blight,” a complete adventure for 18th- to 20th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>“A Voice in the Blight” is also available as a deluxe module for Foundry VTT.</p>

                   <p>The Pathfinder Society secured friendly relations with the dragon Valashinaz over a year ago, and now seeks to call upon that connection. They’ve recovered several warshards large and small, and their powers seem varied and unpredictable. The latest warshard recovered, the largest yet, seems even stranger. The Society has brokered another agreement with Valashinaz to use her not-inconsiderable skill honed over centuries of appraising fantastic items to appraise these shards. Among the tribute required, though, is a task.</p>
                   <p>An upstart dragon set up his lair near Valashinaz’s territory. He has avoided her wrath mainly because she’s been preoccupied with the literal fallout from the god slaying. This is the perfect opportunity for her to get someone else to take care of him, though, and so she has tasked the Pathfinders with getting this upstart out of her territory “by any means necessary.”</p>

                   <p>The Starfinder Society recently completed a year-long excavation of an ancient hobgoblin ruin on the planet Flentil, a colony of the Marixah Republic. Flentil has long been a point of contention between the Republic and their interstellar neighbors, the warmongering Gideron Authority. When a contingent of Hellknights from the Order of the Crucible invades Flentil, these Starfinders are caught in the crossfire and taken captive.</p>
                   <p>Celita, leader of the Dataphiles faction, dispatches a team of Starfinders to Flentil to rescue the captured Starfinders, retrieve the data they gathered, and determine what the Order of the Crucible is up to—all without dragging the Starfinders into an intergalactic war! And if it’s nefarious? Oust the Order! Break the Crucible!</p>

A group of bandits found it much easier to sate their violent tendencies during the rule of the prior queen. Now they're causing trouble both in Irrisen and in settlements on its western border. It's up to the PCs to put a stop to their banditry.</p>

                   </div>
                   <p>If you’re excited about playing Starfinder Second Edition, you probably want to learn more about the setting–the fictional universe the game takes place in. <em>Galaxy Guid</em>e is a tour of Starfinder’s setting that’s sure to inspire countless games. It’s also a sourcebook full of tools for Game Masters (GMs) and players, whether you’re planning to play a prewritten adventure or create a homebrew campaign of your own!&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em> builds on existing lore from Starfinder First Edition, providing updates to the setting following major events like the<a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder/driftcrisis"> Drift Crisis</a> and the recent explosion of Aucturn, which featured in<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq047uk?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday"> A Cosmic Birthday</a>. Epic struggles are unfolding between the despotic Veskarium and the ruthless Azlanti Star Empire, beginning with<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq07flb?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-Empires-Devoured"> Empires Devoured</a> and sparking consequences that ripple across the galaxy—and that’s only a taste of the dramatic events in <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy Guide</em> that might shape your Starfinder games!</p>
                   <p>This book is packed full of exciting new lore, including some wacky sectors of space you’ve never explored before. Get ready to launch into Kazmurg’s Absurdity, an unexplored sector of the galaxy created by former Starfinder Managing Creative Director Thurston Hillman. Kazmurg’s Absurdity is a vast, magically warped territory that can only be traversed using traditional maps. The Absurdity contains realms full of rich resources and bizarre cultures warred over by conniving empires, cruel daemons, and ruthless megacorporations. It’s the perfect place for an adventuring party interested in exploring uncharted space and discovering new worlds filled with ancient secrets and unimaginable treasures.</p>
                   <p><em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em> is designed as a toolbox to help GMs tell different kinds of stories using the Starfinder rules and setting, but it’s full of content for players, too. Six new ancestries and six new archetypes provide plenty of options for creating characters. Get to know the most powerful and influential factions in the galaxy, tour major ports of call where you might spend downtime in your campaign, and visit local hot spots where narrative hooks to draw characters into the setting wait around every corner. <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy Guide</em> is your preview of the Starfinder galaxy–it is fuel to launch your campaign into Second Edition, or to blast your Pathfinder campaign into strange new worlds.</p>

                   <p>Still with me? I should sum it up, gree? <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy Guide</em> contains….</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>A 2-sided poster featuring a political map of the Desna’s Path galaxy and an infographic of the Pact Worlds system, designed by Kyle Hunter.</li>
                    <li>Tools for telling common types of stories (like dystopian and horror) in your Starfinder campaigns and incorporating common elements such as high fantasy or advanced technology into your Starfinder or Pathfinder adventures.</li>
                    <li>Tons of new backgrounds designed for characters from the Starfinder galaxy!</li>
                    <li>Introduction to major and minor factions in the galaxy.</li>
                    <li>Six new archetypes.</li>
                    <li>Six new playable ancestries.</li>
                    <li>Gorgeous art, new lore, and inspiration for countless adventures!</li>
                    <li>The answers you’ve been waiting for about special topics like what happened to those corporate dark elves that lived on Apostae. (And perhaps other burning questions about the new ORC space frontier!)</li>
                    <li>AND THE BEST PART: All the rules in this book are fully compatible with Pathfinder Second Edition!!! That’s right; get ready to send your Pathfinder party through a portal to a faraway planet, or to give your Starfinder group a time machine. Or maybe you’d rather crash another spaceship into Golarion, Numeria style. The galaxy’s your oyster now.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Still not enough for you? Okay, then let’s take a closer look at some of the content in this book and show off some spoilertastic art!</p>
                   <h3>Ancestries</h3>
                   <p>There’s six new ancestries in this book. That’s right, that means that technically you’re going to have 16 ancestry options available to you in August, not to mention the two versatile heritages and Pathfinder legacy ancestries you can choose. Not bad, huh? Let’s talk a little more about those ancestries.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6e1d4fac-fcae-4feb-b1f9-0ffea956aace/WitchwarperContemplative_5.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6e1d4fac-fcae-4feb-b1f9-0ffea956aace/WitchwarperContemplative_5.png" width="400px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="This is a contemplative, an enormous brain with green tubes sticking out of it and an atrophied body dangling below it. The contemplative’s casting a spell that warps reality"></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">“You know how some characters in your party don’t have two braincells to rub together? This contemplative doesn’t have that problem.”)</p>
                   </div>
                   <p><strong>Astrazoan:</strong> A shapeshifter who physically reshapes their own anatomy using specialized musculature rather than using magic to change forms. Sometimes they don’t get all the details of the change quite right—see if you can spot all the astrazoans in this book!</p>
                   <p><strong>Contemplative:</strong> An engorged brain with a vestigial body whose ultimate tools are a superior intellect and psychic powers. Contemplatives live underground on Akiton where they ponder mathematical and metaphysical questions or convene in psychic forums.</p>
                   <p><strong>Dragonkin:</strong> A humanoid dragon hybrid who can form a deep spiritual bond with one other creature. Dragonkin come from Triaxus and are the heart of the Skyfire Legion, a troop of bonded warriors who defend their planet alongside dragon allies.</p>
                   <p><strong>Kalo:</strong> A graceful aquatic humanoid from Kalo-Mahoi, a watery moon orbiting Bretheda. An average kalo is both athletic and creative, and most are known for their outrageous but practical fashions.</p>
                   <p><strong>Sarcesian:</strong> A humanoid spacefarer with energy wings who can survive in the void of space. Sarcesians live in isolated communities in the Diaspora or travel solar streams to distant locations.</p>
                   <p><strong>Vlaka:</strong> A wolflike nomad from Lajok with an incredible sense of smell and unusual sensory adaptations. Vlakas who witnessed the rebirth of their dying sun, Sota, are marked with starburst patterns that match their natural blessing to kindle light.<br><br></p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Archetypes</h3>
                   <p>If you think the factions in <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em> are really cool, this book also contains six archetypes that let you play as a member of one of them! Here’s what the Starfinder team cooked up.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/32d3424c-1b72-4cb5-b925-582af51a05f0/Pahtra_Xenowarden.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/32d3424c-1b72-4cb5-b925-582af51a05f0/Pahtra_Xenowarden.png" width="400px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="a pahtra dressed in green and brown robes,casting the verdant code spell, a spell that calls forth living flora from machinery."></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">“This pahtra is a member of the Xenowardens faction, who is also trained as the xenodruid archetype. The spell they’re casting is verdant code, a spell that calls forth living flora from machinery.”)</p>
                   </div>
                   <p><strong>AbadarCorp Rep: </strong>Climb the corporate ladder as an AbadarCorp rep—if you think you have what it takes for the job.</p>
                   <p><strong>Space Pirate:</strong> Pillage and plunder as a spacefaring freebooter! You’re probably one of the Free Captains, but you might be a lone captain or a lowly deckhand dreaming of commanding your own crew.</p>
                   <p><strong>Hellknight: </strong>Become a ruthless warrior as fearsome as Hell itself and live by the Measure and the Chain. As a Hellknight, you belong to an ancient institution from Lost Golarion, but you’re free to embrace modernity, especially heavy armor and munitions.</p>
                   <p><strong>Knight of Golarion: </strong>Protect your companions and unleash your righteous spirit while preserving the history and cultures of Lost Golarion. You might be a follower of the god Iomedae, a gallant knight, or a historian obsessed with pre-Gap antiquity.</p>
                   <p><strong>Xenoarcheologist: </strong>Explore and catalog ancient ruins and priceless artifacts. Many xenoarchaeologists work for the Starfinder Society, but some are free agents or have ties to other factions.</p>
                   <p><strong>Xenodruid:</strong> Form a mystic bond with a planet and unlock nature’s potential. Most xenodruids are pledged to defend the galaxy’s wilds as a Xenowarden. <br><br></p>

                   <h3>The Necromancer</h3>
                   <p>We got a lot of great feedback from all of you about the new mechanics this class implemented. This proved to be a very popular class fantasy, with playtest necromancers even briefly beating out “human fighter” in Demiplane characters made over the course of the playtest. Many of you found that thralls were a fresh, fun take on battlefield control while also evoking the feeling of controlling an undead army. However, there are a few areas that could use some improvement.</p>
                   <p><strong>Moving Thralls<br></strong> The largest amount of feedback we got was requests for an easy way to move thralls. We’re conscious of the potential for mass minion control to slow down gameplay and thus did not include many thrall movement options. We’re exploring this further moving forward.</p>
                   <p><strong>Martial Necromancers<br></strong> One of the options we wanted to gauge in this playtest was player interest in martial options for the necromancer. From the responses, we found that many people were interested in a more martial-leaning necromancer but ultimately were disappointed with the current options. While we intend to keep the necromancer firmly as a spellcaster rather than pushing it to “gish” territory, we will be looking into ways to make the occasional scythe attack more engaging.</p>
                   <p><strong>Spell List<br></strong> Choosing a spell list for the necromancer was not an easy task, as many of the core elements of necromancy were separated into many spell lists. We are ultimately happy with the choice of the occult list. However, we’ll be implementing options to gain access to some iconic necromancy-themed spells that are not normally available to occult casters to ensure the necromancer feels like a true master of life and death magic.</p>
                   <p><strong>Pets<br></strong> During the playtest, we primarily wanted to test the thrall mechanics and thus left out options we already had plenty of play data on, like familiars. We do plan on including some undead familiar options in the final release of the necromancer</p>

                   <h3>The Runesmith</h3>
                   <p>Since this class uses a brand-new approach to magic, the playtest runesmith was focused on testing a few different options to see which ones were most engaging in play. Many people enjoyed the runesmith’s core fantasy and the tactics of setting up a number of runes before activating them, but there were a few kinks to work out with this system.</p>
                   <p><strong>Tracing &amp; Etching <br></strong> In our team’s internal playtest of runesmith concepts, we realized pretty early that we didn’t want the runesmith to exhaust all their decisions during daily preparations, and that they’d need a way to dynamically make runes in combat as well. Most respondents stated that they found the balance of “pre-combat” etched runes and “in-combat” traced runes to be satisfying, so we’ll be fine-tuning rather than reworking this distribution moving forward.</p>
                   <p><strong>Rune List <br></strong> Since this was a playtest, we were focused on collecting data on a smaller number of runes as test cases for various play styles (damage rune, defense rune, movement rune, etc.) rather than creating an exhaustive list of options. As always, we’ll have a wider list of runes in the final version of the class. Though we don’t intend to do away with direct-damage runes like <em>atryl, rune of fire</em> altogether, we do intend to rebalance <em>some</em> (<strong>some</strong>) of the runes’ power away from direct-damage effects, having your runesmith increase the team’s damage output through buffs and support instead.</p>
                   <p><strong>Diacritic Runes &amp; Composite Invocations<br></strong> These presented two ways to combine your runes to sum up to a unique effect. Both of these options were seen as very interesting, with many people feeling like this gave you the ability to freely script/sculpt your magic. However, they were noticeably complex, and many respondents felt that it was too difficult to get satisfying combos off in play. We’ll be looking at ways to keep the fantasy of personalizing or combining your runic effects while keeping the benefit worth it to set up. We also expect a fuller list of runes to give a greater number of ways to set up combo effects.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>There will be of course other tweaks, changes, and additions made as these classes go through post-playtest revisions. I hope you’re all as excited as we are for their eventual release in 2026!</p>

                   <p>Happy February, Pathfinders! <br>
                     We’re going back to Tian Xia as the literal fallout from the Godsrain continues. The Society has gathered several warshards, the fallen pieces of the dead god Gorum, but their nature is still largely a mystery. The Pathfinders do have one ally who, if anyone can, could shed some light on these mysterious deific fragments—the dragon Valashinaz. Though the Pathfinder Society established friendly relations during the Equal Exchanges incident (check out <em>PFS scenarios </em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02esl?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-504-Equal-Exchanges-Necessary-Introductions"><em>5-04</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eyt?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-509-Equal-Exchanges-Skymetal-Hoard"><em>5-09</em></a>), the cooperation is scarcely a year old, and Valashinaz does nothing for free.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Among the tribute required is a task. An upstart dragon set up his lair near Valashinaz ‘s territory. Due to her being preoccupied with the literal fallout from Gorum's death, she has yet to deal with him. This is the perfect opportunity for her to get someone else to do it, and so she has tasked the Pathfinders—that’s all of you—with getting this upstart out “by any means necessary.” While a trivial matter for an ancient dragon, this mission is sure to be a tad more difficult for our intrepid agents.</p>

                   <p>Meanwhile, we’ve got another quest for you, so we go clear to the other side of Golarion. Given that many of you all are in the throes of winter yourself, it feels appropriate to spend some time in Irrisen, the land of winter witches and endless snow.</p>
                   <p>Not everyone in Irrisen has been happy with the rule of Queen Anastasia. A group of bandits found it much easier to sate their violent tendencies during the rule of the prior queen. Now they're causing trouble both in Irrisen and in settlements on its western border. It’s become enough of a problem that adventurers from the Pathfinder Society (once again, that’s you) have been called in. The young Queen needs allies and, so far, the Pathfinders have been proving themselves just that.</p>

                   <h2>Character Options Updates</h2>
                   <p>Last week, we released the remastered version of Guns &amp; Gears. While most options didn’t change much in this refresh, the sanctioning has been updated and is available on the Character Options page. Most notably, we’ve simplified the access requirements for many of the uncommon options in this book, thus defeating my least-favorite part of this page.</p>
                   <p>We also took this opportunity to refresh the rest of the page! In addition to updating the layout, we also went through many of the old books and updated things that had changed because of the Pathfinder Remaster or otherwise needed a refresh. The full changelog is available on the Character Options page, but I’ll include it below for your reference.</p>

                   <h2>The Future of Starfinder Society</h2>
                   <p>Since our last update, the product page for the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0a2hx?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-714-Final-Assessment">final Starfinder Society adventure for first edition</a> has been posted! This grand finale, written by Thurston Hillman, is an unquestionably epic to the Starfinder Society’s eight-year journey. We recommend veteran players take careful note that this scenario is intended as a finale for your characters and may permanently remove them from play. Be sure their to-do list is cleared before sending them into the Scoured Stars one final time! Tables of this adventure will be available at PaizoCon Online and Gen Con.</p>
                   <p>As First Edition draws to a close, we know you’re all hungry for information about Starfinder Society for Second Edition. We’re just as excited to share the information! Tune into the Paizo blog for a weekly series on Starfinder Society Second Edition—beginning on <strong>Tuesday, April 8</strong>—where we’ll begin rolling out the interstellar carpet for our newest program. SFS2 will launch at Gen Con 2025, so get your badges now for our launch event!</p>

                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had three GMs reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Nova</strong><strong>(SFS1)</strong>: Josh Ericson, Sandra Wilkinson</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Star (PFS1)</strong>: Colin Chen</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Conventions</h2>
                   <p>As we move into spring, the convention season begins once again! This weekend is a federal holiday in America, and we have six conventions running several hundred tables this weekend alone! Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Conventions calendar</a> for upcoming events in your area.</p>
                   <p>I’m also excited to announce that, this March, I will be attending <strong>Coscon</strong> in Butler, PA (just outside my hometown of Pittsburgh!) as well as <strong>GalaxyCon Richmond</strong> in Virginia. If you’re in the area for either of these, I’d love to say hi!</p>
                   <p>Until next time adventurers - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And get those GM applications in!</p>

                   <h2><strong>Basil Wright (he/they/xe)</strong></h2>
                   <p>Labor is not a singular effort. We each have our own role to play, and now, more than ever, is it important to find those around us who are willing to put in the labor required to make the world a brighter, stronger, safer place. We can accomplish more when we work together and make connections. If you're not certain who you can connect with, then you may need to do a bit more research or even put out the call yourself.</p>
                   <p>In the spirit of making connections, one project Basil is immensely thrilled to be a part of is the Griot anthology, "a zine celebrating the brilliant work of black TTRPG game designers." Xe truly cannot wait to reveal what they’ve all been working on. <a href="https://thoughtcrimegames.itch.io/griot-anthology">You can find that project here</a>!</p>
                   <p>You can find xeir own work <a href="https://kobanya.itch.io/">here</a>!</p>
                   <p>We’d also like to put a few more of our Black content creators and performers from the Pathfinder and Starfinder community in the spotlight! The shows on this list feature Black hosts, GMs, players, and/or producers, so please give them a listen and support them throughout the year!</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 9th- through 12th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>The Godsrain has caused chaos throughout Golarion, but it has also caused opportunity. The rain of pieces of Gorum's Armor, the Warshards, has led to a race between various groups to collect these artifacts, either for study or more nefarious purposes. The Pathfinder Society has collected several themselves and learned of a way to find more. When they employed this ritual, though, it pointed to the Netherworld within the Gravelands. A piece of surpassing size and power lies within the reach of Tar Baphon, the Whispering Tyrant. Fortunately, the Society has a plane-hopping airship gained in its defeat of the hag Aslynn, as well as some strange fruit empowered by the silver rain that can grant the power of mythic heroes. But will that be enough to retrieve this item of power before the Whispering Tyrant claims it?</p>

                   <p>A Starfinder Society Scenario designed for 7th- through 10th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>The legendary explorer Jelev Rasheen was one of the first to set off into the Drift in search of fame and fortune. After her mysterious disappearance, dozens of alleged children, partners, and adventuring companions began spreading one final tale about Rasheen: that she was last seen commanding a fleet of ships laden with treasure. Over the past few years, the Starfinder Society has joined the hunt for Jelev Rasheen’s fabled treasure, following a series of beacons from site to site, and recreating Rasheen’s final journey.</p>
                   <p>Now, the coordinates point to Pan, the only planet orbiting the star Ixo in the Tabori Cluster Nebula. The PCs travel to this badlands frontier in search of vast treasure barges or the next leg of Rasheen’s journey, only to discover a crashed starship half-buried in the earth, and no treasure to be found. What was so important about this wreck? And, more importantly, did Rasheen ever make it off this planet alive? The nearby town of Requiem Falls might hold the answers…</p>

                   <p>On the border of Numeria and Ustalav, there sits an abandoned manor filled with strange technology and shuffling undead named the Crushed Meteor. Once a stronghold of the Technic League, it has fallen into the hands of the Whispering Way, and the Pathfinder Society has successfully lobbied with Kevoth-Kul to finally handle the building and exterminate those within. However, a leader of the Whispering Way sits inside the building, considering its many secrets, and offers the Pathfinders a choice: let her finish her research and gain information on an enemy, or perish. It's up to the agents within to make a choice that may sacrifice the values of the Society for valuable knowledge!</p>

                   <h1>PaizoCon Online 2025</h1>
                   <p>PaizoCon Online 2025 will take place online May 23–26, 2025. New content at this show includes the final scenario for Starfinder Society first edition and new Pathfinder Society scenarios.</p>
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Master</strong>: Run tables of Organized Play Scenarios, Bounties and Quests</li>
                    <li><strong>Headquarters (HQ)</strong>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Please read this important information before applying:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the PaizoCon Organizing Committee. Filling this form out <strong>does not guarantee acceptance</strong>; you will receive an email with further information from the PaizoCon committee.</li>
                    <li>PaizoCon Online schedules will be <strong>assigned</strong> by the committee. You will be asked for your preference of system and level, but you will not necessarily be able to choose the specific scenario(s) you run. There is a free-form field at the end of the form to enter specific requests, though there’s no guarantee they will be honored.</li>
                    <li>Reward information is listed in the table below. GMs who do not qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one if they wish to play games.</li>
                    <li>Applications will be processed on a rolling basis, beginning no later than <strong>March 1</strong>. The earlier you get your application in, the more likely it is you’ll get the scenarios you want. Please be patient as we put the final details on the convention internally before we send out GM emails!</li>
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out this form and then follow up by emailing <a href="mailto:paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com">paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com</a>. Anybody interested in running games outside of the Organized Play offerings (such as Infinite content, homebrew content, or games from other publishers) will be able to propose events once tickets go on sale. Stay tuned for future information!</li>
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at <a href="mailto:paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com">paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com</a>.</li>

                   <p>I’ll bet some of you read about Urwal’s trouble in our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6xj3l?Godsrain-and-Gardening">blog post Godsrain and Gardening</a> and wondered if that meant mythic scenarios would become a thing. Well, I’d certainly hope we were giving you mythic powers if we sent you after one of the pieces of Gorum that somehow ended up in the netherworld of the Gravelands in the hands of a mythic lich. The important thing to remember is if Urwal offers you food, you take it.</p>

                   <p>You’ll definitely want to have whatever abilities those berries grant you as you ride into the heart of the Whispering Tyrant’s territory on a planes-hopping airship we took, I mean liberated, from the hag Aslan. I just hope that the boost is enough for you all to get that warshard before someone far, far worse can claim it.</p>

                   <p>Along the border of Numeria and Ustalav lies an abandoned manor called the Crushed Meteor, filled with lost research and technology from the fallen Technic League. Honorary Venture-Captain Lovkiy has finally received permission from Numeria’s ruler, Kevoth-Kul, to send in a squad of Pathfinders to see what remains and keep these findings out of the grasping hands of the Whispering Way, but on two very important conditions:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>The barbarian ruler gets the first option to choose among any weapons left behind.</li>
                    <li>The Pathfinders eliminate any undead found within the building.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>However, someone within the Crushed Meteor may have information that the Pathfinders are willing to break their promises for.</p>

                   <p>In celebration of his life, and to help his family in this difficult time, Paizo is discounting the digital editions of his first two Pathfinder Tales novels, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8iqp?Pathfinder-Tales-Plague-of-Shadows"><em>Plague of Shadows</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy92f3?Pathfinder-Tales-Stalking-the-Beast"><em>Stalking the Beast</em></a>, through the end of February. All proceeds from these sales will go directly to Howard’s family via a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-call-to-help-howard-andrew-jones-and-his-family">gofundme campaign</a> set up last year when he announced his illness and prognosis. Additionally, two short stories Howard wrote to promote these novels are available for free on paizo.com: <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/fiction/tales/serial/theWalkersFromTheCrypt">“The Walkers from the Crypt”</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/fiction/tales/serial/bellsForTheDead">“Bells for the Dead.”</a> We hope that you enjoy Howard’s work as much as we have, and that through that enjoyment, his memory will live on.</p>
                   <p>We’ll miss you, Howard. Thanks for the memories and for lending a small part of your talent to our world.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>When human civilization clawed its way out from the Age of Darkness thousands of years ago, the Magaambya was one of the first flickers of light. Founded by Old-Mage Jatembe and his Ten Magic Warriors in the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, the school still embraces their legacy as the Inner Sea region’s oldest school of magic.</p>
                   <p>The school has recently begun to take a more active role in the wider world. Magaambyans see the Convocation as part of that broader effort, an extension of their teachers’ efforts in offering aid to the scattered Sarkorian people and helping gather their stories.</p>
                   <p>All five of the school’s branches of study are represented among the Magaambyan delegates. Although the school sees these branches as part of the same whole, the branches take on very different roles in the Magaambya and at the Convocation. The storytelling Uzunjati branch is the best known outside the school, but Emerald Boughs are prepared to navigate social situations while Tempest-Sun Mages gear up to fight a different continent’s demons.</p>

                   <p>Magaambyan students have set to growing a symbol of their teachings to remain on the Convocation grounds long after their masks and artifacts are returned to their homes. Although the tree might look out of place in the north’s harsh winters, the stories told beneath its boughs know no seasonal boundaries.</p>
                   <p>The Uzunjati presence at the Convocation can be felt strongly in other ways, as they pass on their stories and the magic contained within them. They even return a tale of old Sarkoris, brought to life by that story and their magic, as a gift to their hosts.</p>
                   <p>But all five branches of the Magaambya do share a common teaching in the wizardly <b>School of Rooted Wisdom</b>. Beyond the shared teachings of Old-Mage Jatembe, each branch has grown from it in a different direction over the millennia, whether exploring the theory of magic as a Cascade Bearer or the boundaries of the physical world as a Rain-Scribe.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>As one of the Houses of Perfection, the Monastery of the Unbreaking Waves seeks enlightenment and martial inspiration in one of the elements. In their case, it is the flexible and unyielding progress of water, flowing around and wearing away all obstacles.</p>
                   <p>For centuries, only three Houses of Perfection stood in Jalmeray, representing air, earth, and fire. The Monastery of the Unbreaking Waves had been destroyed by one of its rivals and pulled into the sea by a great tsunami. It’s only recently that their teachings were returned to the surface with the help of the Pathfinder Society. Although still rebuilding toward its original heights, that history has brought this monastery to the Convocation to prevent such a tragic loss from repeating itself.</p>
                   <p>Beyond this philosophical connection with the elements, each House of Perfection learned many of their techniques directly from the genies associated with their element. In the Unbreaking Waves’ case, they learn from faydhaan, who are known for their diplomatic nature and flexible thinking.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>As the buildings and membership of the monastery are rebuilt, so are its techniques. Recovered ancient scrolls, once thought lost forever beneath the waves, offer a foundation to rebuild on, but new blood and ideas are revitalizing the school’s curriculum.</p>
                   <p>The core techniques of the Unbreaking Waves are still practiced by monks, empowering themselves with understanding of water and breath. Always metaphorical and philosophical, the waves can also become crushingly real in the hands of an experienced monk. But, even among the order’s traditional monastic practices, new blade stances and techniques aim to challenge their old rivals among the Monastery of Untwisting Iron.</p>
                   <p>The new approaches can be seen most clearly among those studying the <b>Resurgent Maelstrom</b>. Combining faydhaan spells and techniques with mortal ingenuity, a magus can use the power of water to turn any tool into a weapon and embrace their transience by shattering them against their foes.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>The University of Lepidstadt, despite being at the forefront of medical and technological advancement, is not always well regarded in its native Ustalav. Many would call it a home of graverobbers and monstrous experiments, although the medical students find the results quite educational.</p>
                   <p>The university students, even those focusing on less controversial fields of study, find the Convocation a breath of fresh air. Certainly, the Kith are noisy and the Magaambyans may have uncomfortable questions about what exactly is inside the Lepidstadt exhibit, but the constant pressure and automatic judgment is lessened. Sadly, it can’t last forever, and eventually the students will have to return to their dimly lit halls and sinister rumors.</p>
                   <p>Some students have an additional cause to celebrate. The university once accepted Sarkorians fleeing the demons who overran their land, although Ustalav at large was by no means welcoming, and many descendants of Sarkorian refugees among Lepidstadt’s delegation are able to visit their ancestral homeland for the first time.</p>

                   <p>Law, theology, and even wizardry are all taught at Lepidstadt, but it’s best known for medicine. Lepidstadt surgeons are among the best in the world, both as healers and in theoretical understanding. They attribute this to the hands-on experience of dismantling cadavers and practicing on volunteers. Whether the newest techniques can be used to open an enemy’s veins or stir dead flesh to a parody of life is a question best left for campfire tales.</p>
                   <p>The School of Science has also begun to make a name for itself, although it’s beset with its own controversies. A number of Stasian coils, covered with arcing electricity and interacting with subtler occult energies, have been smuggled into the school for experiments. The most recent breakthroughs involve using those coils to treat glass, creating a variety of gadgets that can drive off otherworldly beings or steal away part of a target’s aura.</p>
                   <p>Perhaps their most complicated work is their exhibit, a scientific and occult marvel that takes the shape of a heavy cabinet spiked with Stasian coils. The electricity, through shapes and symbols and a crackling voice, seeks to answer questions posed to it. Although even the Lepidstadt students aren’t necessarily sure what’s inside it, they do ask that people stop trying to exorcize it.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Each school, whether a sponsor or an uninvited guest, is introduced by one of their own in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq09ho9?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Rival-Academies"><em>Lost Omens Rival Academies</em></a>. So, whether you’re wondering what it’s like to take classes at the Academy of the Reclamation or want to know why the Sihedron Spires were late for the party, you can find out right from the students themselves.</p>
                   <p>This extends into the rest of the book, including guides to Mendev and Sarkoris for attendees who leave the safety of the Convocation grounds. Even as a player, you should be able to sit down and read cover-to-cover without running into the secret answers to questions your character wouldn’t even know to ask.</p>
                   <p>Or you might flip through to see what spells and feats your school teaches. No judgment there! Obviously, all this studying should teach characters how to do new things. There are new archetypes, spells, feats, items, and character options for the schools. Whether a character is attending the Convocation or dropped out to chase adventure, you’ll find some new options for them.</p>
                   <p>Wrap it all up with a bit of GM advice at the back for running a Convocation campaign, like how to reward forming bonds with other schools, and you’ve got yourself a whole package. I hope you all enjoy it when it comes out on March 5th!</p>

                   <p>We’d like to invite you to be part of the excitement by volunteering as an Organized Play GM! Our volunteer GMs are the best of the best, the cream of the crop, the most helpful skittermanders in the galaxy. Last year, our volunteers ran over 1000 games online and in person, and we’re looking to exceed that in 2025!</p>
                   <p>If you love our games so much that you want to introduce new players to them, and you’re ready to GM on the biggest stages we can offer, then we want you to join the team! Even if you’ve never run Pathfinder or Starfinder Society before, our support team will make sure you have everything you need to run your best games ever.</p>
                   <p>All GMs who run games at Premier or Premier Plus events will receive a $15 paizo.com voucher per block, which can also be spent in the Paizo booth at Gen Con in Indianapolis. Those who volunteer for more blocks may receive badges to the show, PDF or print products, or hotel rooms based on their commitment.</p>
                   <p>At this time, we’re accepting GMs for <strong>Gen Con Indianapolis</strong>. We’ve also included information from our friends at <strong>Origins</strong>; while Paizo won’t have an official presence there, we’re recognizing them as a Premier event, which means additional rewards for GMs and players. Who knows, maybe you’ll even see some Paizo staff at the event!</p>

                   <h2>Gen Con Indy 2025</h2>
                   <p>Gen Con Indianapolis will take place in Indianapolis, Indiana from July 31-August 3, 2025. New content at this show includes the launch of Pathfinder Society Year 7, the new Pathfinder Society Special and, of course, the global launch of Starfinder Second Edition!</p>
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Master</strong>: Run tables of Organized Play Scenarios and Quests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headquarters (HQ)</strong>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demo GM</strong>: Run quick demos for new players, giving them a short Pathfinder/Starfinder experience before quickly turning the table over for the next group. Our Demo GMs may receive an Exhibitor badge in compensation for the fast and furious nature of the position, subject to availability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Board Game Demo GM</strong>: Run demo tables for Goblin Firework Fight and Elemental Stones. Applicants should have strong board game knowledge (both our games and general board games) and preferably have related demo experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Academy GM</strong>: Run games for young children (under 18) and their families and provide a safe, welcoming environment for our youngest gamers. This position requires proof of a completed background check (employment in education, public service, or similar may be accepted as verification that you have completed a background check).</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Please read this important information before applying:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the Gen Con Organizing Committee. Filling this form out <strong>does not guarantee acceptance</strong>; you will receive an email with further information from the Gen Con committee.</li>
                    <li>Gen Con Indy schedules will be <strong>assigned</strong> by the committee. You will be asked for your preference of system and level, but you will not necessarily be able to choose the specific scenario(s) you run. The committee’s intention is to assign people to run the same scenario multiple times during the weekend, to minimize the amount of preparation required. There is a free-form field at the end of the form to enter specific requests, though there’s no guarantee they will be honored.</li>
                    <li>Reward information is listed in the table below. GMs who don’t qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one.</li>
                    <li>Volunteers will be accepted on a rolling basis, and schedules should be assigned within two weeks of your application. Once your schedule is assigned and you confirm, you are considered to be committed to attending the event.</li>
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out the volunteer form and then follow up by emailing genconleads@gmail.com. Please note we have a limited number of tables, and the schedule is fairly locked-in at this stage, but we’ll do our best to get you slotted into your scenario if it’s on the schedule.</li>
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at <a href="mailto:genconleads@gmail.com">genconleads@gmail.com</a>.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h2>A Note on Starfinder Second Edition</h2>
                   <p>We’re very excited to begin rolling out information about Starfinder Society for Second Edition! We have blogs planned in future weeks to discuss some of the particulars of the program, but in order to effectively recruit GMs for Gen Con, we’d like to share the following information with all of you now.</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Starfinder Society scenarios for Second Edition will be 2-3 hours long, and will cover a two-level range. All scenarios releasing at Gen Con will be for 1st-2nd level characters.</li>
                    <li>We will also release a special scenario, #1-00, at Gen Con. This will be a four-hour adventure for pregenerated third-level characters only. This adventure is a prequel to the first year’s metaplot, and will be run on Thursday night only.</li>
                    <li>Our intention is to release two scenarios per month, for a total of 26 scenarios released in Year 1 of Starfinder Society.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>GMs should be aware that we will be scheduling SFS2 scenarios in back-to-back three hour blocks at Gen Con. The expectation is that GMs will finish their tables in 2-2.5 hours; any time before the next game starts is your break time. If you are not confident in your time management skills, we invite you to join us for PFS2 scenarios or the SFS2 special on Thursday night!</p>

                   <h2>Origins 2025</h2>
                   <p>Ohio Org Play would love for you to join us at Origins Game Fair from June 18-22, 2025 at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.</p>
                   <p>For those who have not been to Origins in the past, the convention runs from mid-day Wednesday to mid-day Sunday, for a total of 12 slots of events. We set our scenario-length slots up as 5 hours of gaming with 1 hour meal breaks to give our GMs plenty of time between sessions to eat and re-energize. More about Origins can be found here:&nbsp;https://www.originsgamefair.com/</p>
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Master</strong>: Run tables of Organized Play Scenarios, Bounties, and Quests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headquarters (HQ)</strong>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Volunteer applications will be reviewed by the organizing committee. Filling the volunteer form out does not guarantee acceptance. As this is a large con with many moving parts, GM schedules will be assigned by the committee and sent out in order of volunteering. <strong>Volunteer early to lock in your preferences!</strong> Once your schedule is assigned and you confirm, you are considered to be committed to attending the event.</p>
                   <p>We value each of our volunteers who help to make this event happen. As a reward, we have Ohio Org Play shirts, bags, badges, accommodation for you or your vehicle, and bonus Achievement Points to send your way. But, wait, there’s more! Paizo has generously stepped in to provide voucher rewards to our GM volunteers this year, and free product for those who volunteer for more slots. Here’s a grid to keep track of everything:</p>

                   <p><strong>MARCH OF THE DEMONS! </strong></p>
                   <p>War is coming to the elven nation of Kyonin! From within Tanglebriar, a blighted land that spreads like a sickness along Kyonin’s southern border, the demon Treerazer is prepared to launch his first major attack on his enemies in centuries. Can a new group of heroes stand against the demon armies? The Spore War Adventure Path begins with “Whispers in the Dirt,” a complete adventure for 11th- to 13th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>Whispers in the Dirt is also available as a premium module for Foundry VTT.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p><strong>GO BEYOND LEGENDARY! </strong></p>
                   <p>A god has been slain and nothing will ever be the same again! As war and destruction spread across the world, new heroes must rise to the occasion and take up arms to protect its mortal inhabitants. Lay claim to your own spark of divinity and charge into battle as a mighty exemplar or call upon the power of spiritual allies as a wise animist. Alongside these new classes are rules for running mythic games, archetypes for playing legendary characters, and a wide array of new items, spells, and monsters to tell stories straight out of myth!</p>
                   <p>The pocket edition presents the same contents as the standard edition in a smaller sized softcover for a lower price and better portability.</p>

This side also matches up perfectly to <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Basic Terrain</em>, allowing you to construct an even larger station. The other side of the mat is a grimmer station or research outpost, filled with the leftovers of deadly experiments and gruesome battles. Both sides can be turned into a set piece for almost any science-fantasy adventure!</p>

Before the book releases on March 5th, it’s time to let everyone in on a few school secrets.</p>
                   <p>The Convocation is ultimately an exhibition of what these six sponsor schools have to offer and a place to exchange knowledge so it outlives its discoverers. But far be it for any academic to accept that their exhibit wasn’t the most groundbreaking or that their plan for eradicating demons fell behind their rival’s!</p>
                   <p>So, the Convocation’s six schools have come together in a spirit of learning and competition, alongside their invited guests. But who are these schools, where do they learn the rest of the year, and what secrets have they brought with them?</p>

                   <h2>Academy of the Reclamation</h2>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Academy of the Reclamation campus by Mirco Paganessi.</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>The Academy of the Reclamation may seem a strange host for this gathering of scholars. Located on the edge of the demon-haunted lands of Sarkoris, it’s so new that it’s just now celebrating its first graduating class. Its position in the fortress-city of Nerosyan does provide some surprising benefits, however, with old crusader barracks becoming temporary lodging for guests and the weapon racks of armories being replaced with bookshelves.</p>
                   <p>Still, the academy’s existence can’t be separated from the nation’s history. The people of Sarkoris were scattered for a hundred years, their lands overrun by endless swarms of demons from the Worldwound. Only once that portal to the Outer Rifts was closed could the process of healing the lands and people truly begin.</p>
                   <p>The Academy of the Reclamation seeks to gather the knowledge that dispersed along with the Sarkorian peoples. The magic—and even the names—of the land’s old gods must be reclaimed alongside all the stories, crafts, and traditions that defined the clans of Sarkoris. Somewhat controversially, the academy also embraces what the descendants of old Sarkoris learned during their long flight, even going so far as to establish a new school of wizardry.</p>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>It’s an easy mistake to see the Academy of the Reclamation as mired in sadness and loss. Although the work ahead for returning Sarkorians and their allies is vast, only a few years ago the demonic ranks and foul energy of the Outer Rifts were truly endless. Every day is now a step forward, with each demon killed or plot of land purified marking real progress toward the nation’s healing.</p>
                   <p>Spreading this hopeful message has mostly fallen to <strong>Diarra Romagne</strong>, who is making a rare appearance at the Convocation, spending most of her time traveling wherever the descendants of Sarkorian refugees can be found. Although not everyone is at a place in their life where they can join the academy, few can resist sharing their family’s story when presented with a smiling face and a plate of cookies.</p>
                   <p>Perhaps the academy’s proudest step thus far is rediscovering the rites of Isthralei, an old god of Sarkoris dedicated to protecting travelers in exchange for their stories. The <strong>campfire chroniclers</strong> who practice these rites have become an unofficial group of representatives, accepting the visiting students as their charges in Isthralei’s place.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Cobyslarni Campus by Bastien Jez.</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>No school gathers as much attention on the grounds of the Convocation as Cobyslarni. A massive elephantine creature simply arrived one day, the school atop his back, and settled into a convenient part of the Convocation grounds. This ancient creature, also named Cobyslarni, is the rarely heard headmaster of the school along with being its literal foundation.</p>
                   <p>The school spends most of its time in the fey realm of the First World, with excursions to other planes as suits the headmaster’s unexplained plans. Cobyslarni’s students are likewise gathered from the across the planes, but largely represent the fey. Its curriculum focuses on the magic of the fey, particularly the power of oaths and agreements. The most basic of these agreements, between students and their mentors, form the basis for Cobyslarni’s structure, as loose and chaotic as it may seem to outsiders.</p>
                   <p>With so many students visiting the mortal Universe for the first time, the culture shock is quite extreme. Time and terrain can seem suffocatingly rigid while death looms as an actual threat to fey students. Meanwhile, other attendees are left wondering whether the bird critiquing their exhibit is a professor offering honest feedback or someone’s familiar babbling random insults.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>Along with countless smaller student exhibits of fey magic and artistry, Cobyslarni has also opened access to the Echo Repository, an extradimensional archive filled with things plucked from forgotten dreams. Although the smiling librarians are quick to offer cryptic guidance, even the students of Cobyslarni often find gremlins and mist-shrouded nightmares before they locate forgotten rites or stories lost to time.</p>
                   <p>That is not the only source for information that Cobyslarni brings, of course. The school travels through distant realms, its students learning strange secrets and gathering pacts with mysterious beings. Many students become witches by finding a single powerful being willing to enter a pact, with a chosen few even managing to catch the headmaster’s direct attention.</p>
                   <p>Students who dig deeper into the magic of pacts generally become pactbinders, tying themselves magically to many beings or even abstract concepts. The pactbinders of Cobyslarni have gathered many pacts from the Eldest to simple individual fey through their school’s long travels.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>The empire of Taldor has been a force to reckon with for thousands of years, and Kitharodian Academy is dedicated to retelling that history through songs, poetry, plays, and operas. As Taldor is a military and mercantile power in the Inner Sea, Kitharodian is a cultural power.</p>
                   <p>However, the academy and its patron are tied together through thick and thin. Taldor has declined over the centuries, becoming more insular and more focused on its past glory, and Kitharodian has followed suit. A handful of tales are told and retold, polished until they shine like gold. Meanwhile, students are compared to the centuries of artists who came before them.</p>
                   <p>While publicly staging grand productions of past emperors’ stories, it’s an open secret that many Kitharodian students turn their acting to serve the present empress, Eutropia. Although the school will carefully deny it, particularly at international events like the Convocation, many of its students go on to work as spies among the Lion Blades after graduation.</p>

                   <p>The Convocation has presented a rare opportunity for Kith, as the students call themselves, to expand into new subject matter. These include stories from far-off lands, but also more recent events like the sealing of the Worldwound. They also have a chance to show their polished work to people who haven’t seen those stories a thousand times.</p>
                   <p>Sharing these stories and the techniques behind their telling is a pressing mission for Kith who wonder how long the empire’s relevance will last. But perhaps even then the stories still capture their larger-than-life personalities, from the heroic to the darkly comedic. The finest of Kitharodian’s students can truly inhabit those roles, like living vessels for the emperors of the past.</p>
                   <p>Retelling the same stories has fostered a strange sort of innovation, driving endlessly toward the freshest inspiration and the newest tools. While the inspiration found in moonlit trysts and raucous parties is an ephemeral thing, the workshops’ tools are useful in the shadows as often as on the stage.</p>

                   <h2>And More to Come!</h2>
                   <p>Alongside the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6w1ux?Meet-the-Schools-of-Lost-Omens-Rival-Academies">other three sponsor schools</a> we’ll be visiting next time, the Convocation is also playing host to the Sihedron Spires of New Thassilon and representatives of a dozen other schools. Story information and character options, from a new spell brought by a researcher to archetypes passed down through generations, can help you bring the schools to life in a campaign anywhere their students and graduates may travel.</p>

This precipitating event leads to the birth of monsters and mythic heroes alike, shaking the world of Golarion to its very core.

                   <p>A god has been slain and nothing shall ever be the same again! As war and destruction spread across the world, new heroes must rise to the occasion and take up arms to protect its mortal inhabitants. Two brand-new classes provide new ways to engage with mythic themes! Lay claim to your own spark of divinity and charge into battle as a mighty&nbsp;exemplar, or call upon the power of spiritual allies as a wise&nbsp;animist. Alongside these new classes are rules for running mythic games, archetypes for playing legendary characters, and a wide array of new items, spells, and monsters to tell stories straight out of myth and legend that fit perfectly into the remastered Pathfinder rules!&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>The influence of all-powerful deities is felt in every corner of the Lost Omens setting. Whether you're a valorous champion calling the righteous power of your patron down upon wicked foes or a sneaky rogue asking the god of thievery for a blessing on your next heist, faith and the forces behind it are key to every character's identity. Within this volume, you'll find details on the gods and non-deific faiths of the Age of Lost Omens from the perspective of their clergy and lay worshippers. The book also grants a glimpse into the machinations of a god, exploring how a new god rises, why a god takes worshippers in the first place, and what occurs when a god dies.</p>

                   <p>From Paizo Games Designers Jason Bulmahn and Joe Pasini, <em>Pathfinder Elemental Stones </em>is a pattern-building game with hidden role mechanics! Play as an elemental lord seeking to control the board with patterns of your element—and learn the cycle of the elements as you play!</p>

                   <p>Take on the role of an elemental sovereign, shaping the very nature of reality in this fast-moving board game!</p>
                   <p>2 to 4 players take turns to draft and play colorful (and colorblind-friendly) hexagonal tiles to match specific patterns and meet their own secret objective. With several dozen pattern cards, variable objectives, and a game state that's constantly in flux, you'll never play the same way twice. Simple setup, easy-to-learn rules, and a short play time of around 30 minutes means there's always time for one more game…</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>While the entire team is heads down analyzing your contributions and reactions, we wanted to share some of the changes we’re currently implementing to help give you a sample of the comprehensive improvements you’ll find in <em>Starfinder Player Core </em>(coming this summer). These notes assume you have been following our errata, <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest/faq">all of which can be found on our FAQ page</a> and the latest of which are <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6xq1l">summarized here</a>.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Adventures!</h2>
                   <p>We’ve learned a lot about how certain effects work in our adventures. One thing you’ll see is that the team will be judicious in the use of creature resistances and Hardness in adventures. We’ve also seen some good feedback on shorter adventures for Organized Play and are excited to explore the 2–3 hour time slot more. Expect to hear more on the adventure front in the months to come.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Ancestries</h2>
                   <p>Good news for skittermanders who want to jump rope and wield a flamethrower at the same time: you are now going to be able to perform actions and use items with your other hands, but you can only <em>wield</em> items (such as shields and weapons) with your active hands.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Traversal</h2>
                   <p>One new element we'll be introducing is the traversal trait. This new trait mostly applies to player-facing rules that reference Stride. When it applies, traversal allows the use of alternative movement types (burrow, fly, and swim) to be used in place of land Speed, akin to how Sneak works. Expect to see this greatly impact some abilities used by the envoy and solarian (to name a few).</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Weapons</h2>
                   <p>Most weapons have been… upgraded *puts on shades*. These include bigger magazines and damage, along with lower prices, bulk, and expend values. Some weapons have adjusted functions, including using modular as a way to switch traits on the fly, and a modular weapon with a nonlethal configuration.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Envoy</h2>
                   <p>Envoys are becoming even more tactically diverse, with bespoke directives for each leadership style. Oh, and after analyzing the reaction to our bold experiment, we’ve decided that Get ’em! should be a bonus instead of a penalty—flanking’s back on the menu!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Mystic</h2>
                   <p>We have streamlined the mystic experience by removing the transfer cost from most feats, and introduced a scaling cap to Transfer Vitality that helps balance the amount of healing you can provide. We’ve heard your requests and are also switching out some connection-granted spells!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Operative</h2>
                   <p>Operative is a solid class, but we've made a few changes and buffed many specializations. We also took away Hair Trigger's ability to disrupt actions, and it's now a 6th-level feat. But operatives will be happy to see we’ve also buffed many specializations!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Solarian</h2>
                   <p>Solar Flare is now a martial ranged weapon in the brawling weapon group that doesn’t take up a hand and will scale with solarian weapon crystals instead of by level. We’re also going to shift the solar nimbus into something that helps take the place of the very enticing Reactive Strike.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Soldier</h2>
                   <p>We are exploring new ways to allow close quarters combat soldiers to use all those nifty area fire feats with their melee weapons. The changes we mentioned about weapons are going to have a big impact here, and we’re excited about where soldiers are headed.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Witchwarper</h2>
                   <p>Quantum fields are now bigger, and all witchwarpers get Quantum Pulse at level 1, allowing them to Warp Reality as a free action when they roll initiative. We’re also building Quantum Transposition into the early level class abilities instead of as a feat you need to select. Instead of anchoring actions, anchors now provide automatic benefits when you Sustain your quantum field. Overall, the changes make quantum fields more effective and easier to use.</p>

                   <p>There are so many other exciting changes in our final edition of the game, both detailed and broad! Be sure to stay alert so you aren’t caught off guard! The new edition of the game launches this summer at Gen Con 2025, and our first Second Edition book, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq07vsk?Starfinder-Galaxy-Guide"><em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em></a>, is available this spring.</p>

                   <p>In the Spore War Adventure Path, your characters begin as new heroes of the nation of Kyonin and are called upon by Queen Telandia Edasseril to represent Kyonin’s interests in an upcoming diplomatic summit with the nations that border Lake Encarthan. The Whispering Tyrant’s growing threat cannot be ignored, but as the meeting between diplomats gets underway, it isn’t long before everyone realizes there is a much more imminent danger to the elven way of life. Treerazer is poised to strike Kyonin’s heart, and the heroes who find themselves standing against him must be stronger than ever before!</p>
                   <p>Inside the <em>Spore War Player’s Guide</em>, you’ll find player-friendly, spoiler-free information and tips to help you make an exciting new 11th-level character perfect for the Spore War Adventure Path. While this campaign is exceptionally well suited to a party that consists entirely of elven characters, Kyonin is welcoming of all ancestries.</p>

                   <h3>Carlos Cisco</h3>
                   <p>My name is Carlos Cisco. I’m a TV/Film and TTRPG Writer with credits most recently on <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>, Pathfinder, <em>Daggerheart</em>,<em>Candela Obscura</em>, and <em>Draw Steel</em>. I have a deep and abiding love of horror, fantasy, sci fi, and collective action, and a deep and abiding hate for the ravages of late-stage capitalism… which fed into how I approached working on Abadar, a god of civilization, trade, and capital. Gods of money are complex beasts, and I wanted to explore how bad actors might manipulate his words and doctrine for personal gain. This work also fed into my work on the Death of the Divine, which embraced a new and complicated layer to Abadar’s story.</p>

                   <h3>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h3>
                   <p>Now that <em>Divine Mysteries</em> is out in the world, I'm even more proud to have contributed to this amazing book! As a freelancer, I've worked on a handful of Paizo products including <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, the Curtain Call Adventure Path, and some forthcoming books! For <em>Divine Mysteries</em>, I was overjoyed to write the article on Pharasma, Lady of Graves. As an unrepentant goth, and someone for whom life, death, and fate are all very important, Pharasma has always been my favorite deity, and getting to add my voice to her body of work is something I'm very thankful for! A thousand compliments to the developers, editors, and art team for making this book a phenomenal guide to all things holy (and unholy)!</p>

                   <p>Hi! I’m Drakoniques (or just Drak for short) and I wrote the Lamashtu and Giant Gods sections. I’ve always been a huge fan of deities and the myths/legends that follow them. You can tell a lot about a society by the gods they worship and the lessons their legends hold, so getting to create and add to that for the world of Golarion was wonderful! Writing Lamashtu was especially exciting for me because my first Pathfinder character was a sorcerer who worshipped Lamashtu! Writing her section felt like a perfect full circle.

                   <p>Hello! I go by Aoife Ester. <em>Divine Mysteries</em> is my first project working with Paizo, and I'm beyond thrilled with how the book turned out. For my contribution, I channeled an enduring love of weird fiction into Yivali's report on the Outer Gods &amp; Great Old Ones, and am proud to introduce all-new deity Izuyaku, the Strength and Serenity, to the world of Pathfinder. It was a uniquely fun experience to jump from writing about deities that embody the cold and uncaring nature of the universe to writing about one who cares deeply about their followers. If you are determined to seek me out, you can do so on Twitter (<a href="https://x.com/breadbutt">@breadbutt</a>) or on Discord (breadbutt_).</p>

                   <p>Hey, my name is Tomas Gimenez Rioja. I am a Latino game designer, writer, project manager, actual player, SW engineer, and many other things from Argentina. I got to work on projects like <em>Seas of Vodari</em> and <em>Under the Seas of Vodari</em>, where I was in charge of a big part of the monster design, and personal projects like <em>Goth Borg</em> and the system agnostic setting in development <em>Magnolia: The City of Marvels</em>. For <em>Divine Mysteries</em>, I got to bring in my love for monsters and the way these gods affect culture for the goblins and goblinoids; through these gods, I sought to bring depth to goblins, which are often overlooked in many fantasy stories and roleplaying games. Additionally, if you have been following Teki Stronggut, you will find a great surprise in this new book. I hope you get to enjoy these new changes and additions to the gods of Golarion.</p>

                   <p>Hey, I’m Alastor Guzman, your local Mexican game designer. I’m a freelance designer and writer, and I’ve worked on Pathfinder, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Magic: The Gathering,&nbsp;<em>Tales from the Gods</em>, and other indie games. The last time I worked with Paizo was on&nbsp;<em>Knights of Lastwall</em>, and I’m thrilled about my work on&nbsp;<em>Divine Mysteries</em>. You can find my writing in the Asmodeus section and the Qlippoth Lords. I’m especially proud of my contributions to the followers and church of our favorite Lord of Darkness and Law, and the introduction of a new Qlippoth Lord, Nyuo-Ogh, the Always Observing. Besides freelancing, I’ve also worked on smaller Mexican projects like&nbsp;<em>Tezca Sentai</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tales from the Gods</em>. I enjoy creating new settings and creatures. You can find me on Bluesky and most social platforms as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alastorgv.bsky.social">@alastorgv</a>.

                   <p><em>Divine Mysteries</em> was my first foray into freelancing and my first assignment with Paizo. I'm relatively new to the lore of Pathfinder, so I had such a great time immersing myself in the history of Golarion and how their deities have changed over time. As a lover of all things tabletop, I was particularly excited to revisit the Azlanti gods and my personal favorite undead queen, Urgathoa. I hope to work on more projects in the future! "May you dine forever."</p>

                   <p>My direct work on this book was pretty small—I wrote up the entries for Desna, Treerazer, and Zyphus. That said, many of the deities in this book are ones I created decades ago for my homebrew, and watching them grow and evolve and become something more amazing than I ever could have done on my own thanks to the input and imagination of so many other talented creators has been one of my favorite parts of working on Pathfinder. Thank you to everyone who worked on this book to help make it a reality!</p>

I’m a regular freelancer for Paizo, and have contributed to a number of rulebooks, Lost Omens, and adventures (you can find my full list of credits at <a href="https://paizo.com/people/JacobWMichaels">paizo.com/people/JacobWMichaels</a>). For <em>Divine Mysteries</em>, I contributed to the avatar forms and the mortal herald archetype (I didn’t know mythic was coming when I wrote it, so credit Paizo for those cool parts!). I also wrote the Shelyn entry, which was a lot of fun—there’s nothing like writing about love and beauty to put you in a good mood. Hopefully she inspires you go to out and spread the same, which the world (any world you play in!) truly needs.</p>

                   <p>Hey all! Erin here. After writing about the deaths of several gods in The Godsrain Prophecies, it was great to have the opportunity to bring some of them to life. To me, writing gods is an amazing opportunity to take aspects of the human experience and make them larger than life, and I deeply enjoyed having a chance to celebrate wanderlust and love across distance with Obari, write about the strength needed to persevere through both heartache and oppression with Embaral, and get back to my (fictional) murderous ways with Norgorber. I hope you enjoy them all!

In D<em>ivine Mysteries</em>, I was thrilled to create a brand-new deity embodying darkness in a different sense than we usually see. I love deities and mythology, and despite working on a lot of different books at Paizo, I happened to not have a chance to write a new deity until now, so I'm beyond excited!

                   <p>Hey all, I'm Isis Wozniakowska and I wrote both the Battle Harbinger and the new article on Nethys. I've always loved magic and fantasy and most especially wizard nonsense so it was a treat to work on this project and get to work with magic and the divine. I got into my field of Comparative Literature from an early fascination with mythology and so tales of the divine hold a very special place in my heart, and I hope I managed to let that shine through here. I was super excited to tackle Battle Harbinger since I was, early on, someone who really wanted a more martial combat ready style of cleric. I'm currently making my way through an MA so I don't have too many active projects right now but I am occasionally on Bluesky under <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wozenstein.bsky.social">@wozenstein</a>, where I mostly talk about books I read and sometimes video games that I like.</p>

                   <p>Hi, I’m&nbsp;Sebastian Yūe, an award-winning game designer, writer, and editor. I’m proud to have put my spin on Calistria and Irori for this book. I sought to bring themes of queer and trans self-expression to these deities; though vastly different, they both encourage the embracement of the authentic self. Pathfinder 1e was the first TTRPG I ever played and my first character was a paladin of Irori. It’s been a joy to revisit the god of self-perfection after a long journey of my own.&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</em>&nbsp;is my first title with Paizo. When I’m not writing TTRPGs, I’m publishing them as the publishing coordinator at Hit Point Press, and when I’m not working at all, I’m teaching myself to draw, going on hikes, or writing short stories with original characters.

And we fully intended to do so!</p>
                   <p>Then the Remaster happened instead.</p>
                   <p>That workload was fast and furious, and didn’t really leave time for other tasks like finding errata, vetting the changes, and producing the public pages for them. Even after the books, we were catching up with projects that had their schedules thrown into disarray, and could release some Remaster compatibility errata only when the first of the core books came out, over a year ago.</p>
                   <p>This blog marks us returning to the intended schedule of two updates per year.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Today’s Updates</h2>
                   <p>The new errata and clarifications are <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq">up now on the FAQ page</a>, identified with “Fall 2024” and the printing of the book they apply to. For example, “Player Core Errata (Fall 2024, 1st Printing).” This set includes a pretty extensive set of updates to make the initial Remaster books as accurate as possible. Future sets of updates likely won’t be this lengthy. Also, because we previously put out errata when a book was being reprinted, we typically had the final wording on hand. In this new system, the challenges of text layout make it possible that some of these updates might not match the exact final text when we reprint a book. We could have to revise them later, keeping the same mechanical changes but adjusting the wording a bit.</p>
                   <p>So what books are we covering?</p>
                   <p><em><b>Pathfinder Player Core</b></em> has been out long enough for people to have found a lot of minor errors, which make up the bulk of these updates. We covered some fixes that veteran players familiar with the legacy books could likely figure out, but that new players would lack the context for, such as stray mentions of “ability modifiers.” Several feats got improvements to be more appealing for the characters they’re meant for.</p>
                   <p>One of the notable changes you’ll see is an update to the <em>sure strike</em> spell. The spell could be very strong, with the reroll effectively making a much larger bonus than most abilities can grant. This benefit was usually in control at low levels when characters had few spell slots, but it could become disruptive and repetitive at higher levels on characters built to gain a huge number of copies of the spell and use it constantly. We’ve added temporary immunity to the spell, with the intent that it can still be very strong to create intense moments, but that there’s little incentive to use more than a handful of spell slots on it.</p>
                   <p><em><b>Pathfinder GM Core</b></em> had some minor changes, mostly to cover side effects of the Remaster process and the introduction of <em>reinforcing</em> runes being missed in a couple places.</p>
                   <p><em><b>Pathfinder Monster Core</b></em> had a variety of small changes. The one that affects the most creatures is fixing the scaling on the <em>demonic pact</em> and <em>diabolic pact</em> rituals.</p>
                   <p><em><b>Pathfinder Player Core 2</b></em> saw a few changes, including changing the incorrect action symbol on You’re Next to a reaction, giving the champion multiclass dedication the champion’s aura ability, and fixing the damage on <em>live wire</em>.</p>
                   <p><em><b>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</b></em> already received updates for Remaster compatibility, but we’ve added some more updates. The main one is to allow the magus to use spells that don’t require spell attacks. This made part of the Expanded Spellstrike feat obsolete, but that feat can still be taken by players who want to affect areas. Studious spells were missed in the previous pass, and are now updated.</p>
                   <p>Other changes to <em>Secrets of Magic</em> include several fixes to individual rules elements and repeating the elemental themed changes and expansions that were detailed in <em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>, making them easier to find for people who don’t have that book.</p>
                   <p>In addition, we’ve put out our lost album! That’s to say, the long-absent <em>Secrets of Magic</em> 1st printing to 2nd printing errata is now on the FAQ page as well.</p>
                   <p>For <em><b>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</b></em>, we’ve updated a few levels and prices for some of the beast armaments so they are more in line with their runes. We’ve made a few targeted changes as well—gone are the days of the minotaur rogue also scaring all their teammates with Alarming Disappearance, which no longer affects allies who have spent significant time with you.</p>
                   <p>For <em><b>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</b></em>, a few pieces of missing information were added, namely the Speed entries for the sarangay and yaksha ancestries, which are both 25 feet.</p>
                   <p><em><b>Pathfinder War of Immortals</b></em> got the few changes that were previewed in the <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/PZO12006AlternateMythicRules.pdf">Alternate Mythic Rules</a> document added to the FAQ page.</p>
                   <p>We hope these changes will make your games play more smoothly and clear up a few points of confusion! We’ll be keeping an eye out for other potential errata that come up between now and spring.</p>

                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders!<br>
                     For the winter season, we’ll be traveling up north to Irrisen to speak with Her Majesty, Queen Anastasia! The strange queen from another world has a peculiar idea that she’s decided to try and introduce into her new home in order to better connect all the citizens of Irrisen: a locomotive. Her current drawback is that, well, no one in her kingdom, nor most of Avistan, seems to know anything about trains or whatever a “combustion engine” may be and she certainly doesn’t have the education to even begin explaining how the steam is made nor how the train gains the ability to whistle so loudly when crossing bridges. But she does know how to draw and how to call on others for their knowledge and assistance! With the Pathfinder Society being one of the most traveled organizations in Golarion, she asks for their assistance in judging the models that have been presented to her from prospective engineers, though perhaps one of those engineers is less interested in trains as they are in thrones…</p>

                   <p>The Tskikha iruxi enclave has long been a staunch ally of the Pathfinder Society. Their enclave's location near some elementally attuned Azlanti ruins has given the Society a wealth of research opportunities while allowing them to protect the iruxi from the dangers in the ruins, which tend to cause trouble, as some of you no doubt might recall, especially anyone who’s played <em>The Blackwood Lost</em>. Recently, these ruins seem to have attracted some elemental scamps, which are causing mischief and chaos throughout the enclave in their attempts to “help.” At their wits end, the Tskikha have once again called upon their allies—that’s all of you—for help.</p>

                   <p>Against all odds, the fractious orcs of southern Belkzen have united, thanks in part to the PCs’ insight on how to subdue the region’s terrifying ancestor storms. Now Belkzen has mustered an army to quash an undead uprising and punish the treacherous orcs who enabled it. The PCs must in­filtrate the enemy city of Wyvernsting before the siege begins. Only then will they uncover the undead apocalypse’s true master. “Destroyer’s Doom” is an orc-focused Pathfinder adventure for four 9th-level characters.</p>

                   <p>Within Irrisen, Queen Anastasia has spent the better part of a decade testing the boundaries of her rulership and seeing where she can and cannot make change. After enough research and discussion with fellow leaders, she's finally decided full steam ahead on the first of many plans she has developed to help bring her new home to the forefront of Avistani politics. Seeking insights from those who have to travel over a wide variety of landscapes, she's called upon the Pathfinder Society for their opinions on the platform of her new venture. Her meeting with Society agents and contractors goes off the rails, however, when a group of frost goblins looking to let off some steam launch an attack conducted by a disappointed fey. The Pathfinders will need to catch those goblins and defeat the fey in order ensure that Queen Anastasia's plan doesn't get derailed!</p>

                   <p>Ever since the Starfinder Society first established a presence on the false moon of Salvation’s End, its agents have continued to slowly but surely uncover new information about the megacomplex’s internal machinations and the dangerous Guiding Intelligence seemingly at its head. But they’re not the only ones interested in Salvation’s End…</p>
                   <p>Deep within the false moon, the tyrannical Vault Lord conquers vault after vault, spreading their influence and subjugating the residents of every vault in their path. Now, the free residents of Salvation’s End have come to two conclusions: the Vault Lord must be stopped, and they’ll need to work together to defeat them.</p>
                   <p>Join the Starfinder Society, the free citizens of Salvation’s End, and the mysterious Guiding Intelligence in a joint attack against the Vault Lord within the very heart of their realm: the vault of Xin-Tsalash!</p>

                   <p>The Tskikha iruxi enclave has long been a staunch ally of the Pathfinder Society. Their enclave's location near some elementally attuned Azlanti ruins has given the Society a wealth of research opportunities while allowing them to protect the iruxi from the dangers in the ruins, which have a tendency to cause trouble. Recently they seem to have attracted some elemental scamps, which are causing mischief and chaos throughout the enclave. The Tskikha have once again called upon their allies for help.</p>

Necromancers have all kinds of ways to sacrifice their thralls for their own gain, whether that’s by devouring their essence to replenish a Focus Point using the Consume Thrall ability, or by detonating one into a deadly spray of phalanges with the <em>bony barrage</em> grave spell!</p>

                   <p>Equal parts artist, scholar, and warrior, the <b>runesmith</b> devotes themself to the study of mystical symbols. These support-focused martial combatants diligently etch runes of every magical tradition onto their (and their allies’) gear, or even directly onto their foes. These runes can be applied even in the heat of combat: use feats like Engraving Strike to stamp <em>ranshu, rune of thunder</em> onto an enemy before Invoking it to call down lightning, or Trace <em>zohk, rune of homecoming</em> in light onto an ally’s boots to ensure their path back to you is always a little shorter.</p>

                   <p>This <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest">playtest</a> will run for eight weeks, beginning December 9th (today!), and continuing through January 31st. In addition to playtesting these classes in your home games, you’ll be able to try them out in our organized play program by making your own Pathfinder Society characters using the rules located in the Guide to Organized Play. The necromancer and runesmith classes and all related options are available to all players during this playtest.</p>
                   <p>Our friends at Demiplane are also hosting a free character builder for the necromancer and runesmith classes, available at <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/sources/impossible-class-playtest">www.pathfindernexus.com/playtest</a>, for those of you interested in taking advantage of their digital toolset to generate your characters.</p>
                   <p>Once you’ve had a chance to get a feel for the new classes, please be sure to leave your feedback at <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ImpossiblePlaytestSurvey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ImpossiblePlaytestSurvey</a> and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ImpossiblePlaytestOpenResponse">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ImpossiblePlaytestOpenResponse</a> to let us know what you think of them and where you think they could be improved! We also have <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/pathfinder/second/impossiblePlaytest">dedicated playtest forums here on paizo.com</a> to discuss these classes and options with your peers. We’re looking forward to hearing what you have to say! We’d also love to see stories of your adventures with these classes on social media!</p>

If you’re at the show, stop by our space on the gaming floor to say hi and grab an advance copy of the necromancer &amp; runesmith playtest classes.

                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2>
                   <p>These adventures will be available on December 18, 2024. PAX Unplugged attendees will have the chance to play these adventures early!</p>
                   <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3>

                   <br>
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2>
                   <p>Another month, another book of divine content! In both senses of the word, really. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02oal"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Divine Mysteries</em></a> is now <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions#lodm-sanctioning">sanctioned for Pathfinder Society play</a>! This includes <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6xc5n">the web supplement of deities</a> published on the Paizo Blog last month.</p>
                   <p>This book contains a number of options for divine-focused characters and tells the tale of many gods who are now dead or missing as a result of the War of Immortals. Speaking of which…</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Rule Updates</h2>
                   <h3>Newly Removed Deities and You(r Characters)</h3>
                   <p>The following deities have been removed from Pathfinder Society legality and may not be selected by new or existing characters:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Anubis</li>
                    <li>Ashukharma</li>
                    <li>Cernunnos</li>
                    <li>Grundinnar</li>
                    <li>Horus</li>
                    <li>Isis</li>
                    <li>Lubaiko</li>
                    <li>Ma’at</li>
                    <li>Mother Vulture</li>
                    <li>Osiris</li>
                    <li>Ra</li>
                    <li>Sekhmet</li>
                    <li>Sturovenen</li>
                    <li>Thoth</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Any character with an option that relied on worship of a newly removed deity, such as a cleric, gets a free rebuild <strong>immediately</strong>. Your characters may be played as written until the end of the year, but after January 1 you will need to use this rebuild to remove any mechanical effects of worshiping that deity.</p>
                   <h3>Hireling Translators</h3>
                   <p style="font-weight: 400;">The Hireling Translator boon has been updated so the second sentence now reads as follows:</p>
                   <p style="font-weight: 400;">“This ally speaks, reads, and understands Common as well as two additional languages of common rarity <strong>or that you have access to,</strong> chosen when this boon is purchased.”</p>
                   <p style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent update to the Guide to Organized Play also granted all Pathfinders access to all Uncommon languages. Go forth with your new and improved translators!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had two GMs reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Nova</strong><strong>(SFS1)</strong>: Elizabeth Nold, Solatra Harving</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>
                   <h2>Conventions</h2>
                   <p>The holidays typically mean events slow down, but we’ve still got some December events to celebrate the season! Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Conventions calendar</a> for upcoming events to get your Paizo fix in.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Until next time adventurers - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And have a happy new year!</p>

                   <p>It’s November, and that means here on Turtle Island in the United States, we celebrate Native American Heritage Month! This cultural heritage month was first observed in 1990, after being signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. Native American Heritage Month honors the Indigenous people of Turtle Island, recognizes the damage colonization wreaked on these many and varied nations, and celebrates the achievements of Native people throughout history.</p>
                   <p>This year’s theme is “Honoring the Past, Recognizing the Present, Making Stories for the Future,” with a focus on preserving Indigenous culture and heritage by passing it down to new generations and encouraging Native youth. Some of our contributors used this theme as inspiration for their submissions!</p>
                   <p>Content warning: Some submissions discuss anti-Native racism, residential schools, and cultural trauma.</p>

                   <h3>Basil Wright (he/they/xe)</h3>
                   <p>One benefit of getting is older is that you truly just stop giving a damn about what others think about you. When I was in elementary school, I was a lot more open about being Black and Seminole and was subjected to a lot of abuse, resulting in me hiding away my Indigenous heritage.</p>
                   <p>Now, I design my own games and write my own stories, which means I want them to reflect parts of my lived experiences. I do my best to incorporate more of my heritage into my work, such as my writing work in <em>Backchannels</em>, or directly working with my friend Robin Perera to create an Indigenous character in <em>Spellbound: a magical mystery</em>.</p>
                   <p>It's my hope that doing this not only helps other Indigenous folx out there, but reaches back to my younger self and gives them a tight hug of support. Indigenous people aren't just a symbol of the past. We're here, we're living, we're thriving. We'll continue to do so.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>David N. Ross (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>You might know my work from the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path (I loved the social maneuvering as much as the set-piece fights), Pathfinder Adventure Path: Abomination Vaults (5E), or any of the dozens of sourcebooks I've contributed to. As a longtime Paizo freelancer of mixed Ojibwe and Euroamerican roots, my mixed-race experience has long informed the way I think about designing mixed ancestries going back to my work on the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder</em><em>Advanced Race Guide&nbsp;</em>and other First Edition supplements. I was also happy to adapt the baykok of Ojibwe legend for&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder</em><em>Bestiary 3</em>.</p>
                   <p>In the coming months, I'm looking forward to the release of some articles drawing on the stories of my Ojibwe family for <em>Drintera® Magazine</em> in January and February, which you can find out more about over here:</p>

                   <h3>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h3>
                   <p>Being a reconnecting Native is at once a beautiful and deeply painful experience, especially when my grandfather’s “adoption” records weren’t unsealed until I was an adult. Many Native people experience this disconnect from our homes and cultures because for much of the United States’ history, we were forcibly removed by residential schools, adoption programs, and discriminatory laws. But as more and more of those boxes are being unsealed and tape is being cut, we can experience the joy of knowing where we come from.</p>
                   <p>I consider myself very lucky to live in an area with a thriving Native population—and a Native Community Center!—because being in community is one of the most healing things a person can experience. Recently, I’ve been attending beadwork classes, learning from elders and master crafters, and while I’m far from that, I’m proud to have finished several pieces since my first class. Learning the arts and skills of our elders is matched only in importance by learning their stories, so our cultures can continue to live and thrive.</p>
                   <br>

                   <p>Someday, I hope to be someone Native youth look to for inspiration and joy—or at least someone who helped write stories they can see themselves in.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Sara Jeffers (she/they/he)</h3>
                   <p>Sara Jeffers is a Two-Spirit member of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, in what is now known as Washington and British Columbia. Their heritage and culture influence not only her graphic and narrative designs but also his approaches in problem-solving and community building.</p>
                   <p>In writing <em>Starfinder Bounty #10: Those who were Taken</em>, Sara was reminded of the horrific abuses that their family members underwent in the Tribal Schools programs in the 20th century. The idea that these innocents were being abducted, abused, and reprogrammed unless saved resonated with the stories she'd heard growing up about attempted school rescues and the children never forgotten. When they explained to a family elder what the Starfinder adventure was about, they got a tired but warm smile. "It is good to save the children."</p>
                   <p>That mantra drives her, and the desire to be in community with others, something that Jeffers took for granted as a youth, led him to create Meadowlark Productions, a TTRPG channel focused specifically on raising money for various charities, saving the children one game at a time. In December, Meadowlark will produce an entire month of games that benefit Project Hope.

The book is the best source for all things related to deities and the divine, featuring insights into the workings of divine power, new character options for characters of all kinds, and of course, details on the various gods of Golarion.</p>
                   <p>Speaking of gods, there were actually too many gods to fit in the book! Once you cover the core deities of the Inner Sea, other notable gods of the regions, demon lords, empyreal lords, monitor demigods, and the rest, it turns out your book is fully packed! Even with 328 pages, we didn’t have enough space for every god featured in Pathfinder Second Edition! Even with the many gods we’ve featured in the game so far, we didn’t want to leave some of you without an option to worship your favorite god under our remastered rules.</p>
                   <p>Luckily, Yivali, the psychopomp author of <em>Divine Mysteries</em>, is very thorough in her work and was able to collect a listing of all the gods she encountered in her research! If you wanted to know the sanctification for Balumbdar or needed to see if Ragdya’s favored animal is the monkey (it is), then this web supplement is for you. Any god that has been featured in Pathfinder Second edition so far is included here! The supplement also contains all of the gods featured in <em>Divine Mysteries</em> to help make this a convenient source for all things divine. We hope you enjoy the fruits of Yivali’s labors!</p>

                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders!<br>
                     This month, we’re traveling to Nirmathas to check in on Ashfall Lodge since Oraiah Tolal left! Three new faces have stepped up in her place: Anemone, Pattypan of Gold Bits, and Bog’s Companion, and the three of them have noticed some strange rumblings within the forest. It seems like Compost’s Watch, a town that looks over a sacred leshy graveyard, is being attacked by undead forces and necromantic energies. It’s up to the Pathfinders to travel through the eerie trees and bushes of the Compost Forest, find out what’s going on, and put a stop to it!</p>

                   <p>After that, we travel far to the south and east to Nex, where one of the warshards (shards of the dead god Gorum, which rained down after he was slain) landed in an ooze being transported outside of Oenopion. This ooze, now divinely empowered, was last seen headed toward the Mana Wastes. The creature has proven to be more than a match for Nexian forces, and so Nex has resorted to hiring mercenaries. That’s where you come in. The Pathfinder Society doesn’t want to pass up this chance to get their hands on another warshard, and it’ll be up to you to see that they do.</p>
                   <p>Of course, you’ll first have to earn the right to take it. Other mercenaries have come seeking fortune, or the shard, or both, and some of them might even be from a nation on not-so-good terms with the Society. What's more, the Mana Wastes themselves aren't going to make this mission any easier, and no one yet understands the full impact that warshards have on creatures, so there's no telling what this shard-empowered ooze might be capable of. All in all, it should make for a memorable tale—if you’re able to make it back and tell it.</p>

The book also includes details on hundreds of gods and philosophies common throughout the Lost Omens setting and exciting character options for adventurers of all types, regardless of their divine gifts, so you can take up the weapons and magic of your deity!</p>

                   <p>Deep in the Fangwood Forest in war-torn Nirmathas sits an isolated leshy village called Compost Watch surrounded by a sacred leshy graveyard: the Compost Forest. Working in tandem with the Ashfall Lodge, Compost Watch has kept up their vigil and maintenance of the primal space for generations. However, after a recent distress signal from the trees of the Fangwood, no one's heard from the little town. It's up to the PCs to enter the Compost Forest and see what's upsetting the balance of life, death, and nature!</p>

                   <p>Envar Tamm is in crisis! Or, more accurately, his body double is. Envar is a friend of the Starfinder Society and host of the popular extreme travel v-log&nbsp;<em>Envar’s Expeditions</em>. Days ago, mercenaries mistakenly kidnapped Envar’s body double while filming reshoots, rather than Envar himself. Possessing more bravery than good sense, Envar immediately hatched a plan to rescue his double and stream the footage.</p>
                   <p>Worried that Envar is going to get himself killed, Ilia Tamm, Envar's mother and CEO of Arch Energy Consortium, has contacted the Starfinders to bail him out. The mission? Accompany Envar on his absurd rescue mission and ensure he survives. While you’re at it, you might as well rescue Envar’s body double.</p>
                   <p>It’s time for Envar’s Awesome Rescue!</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 7th- through 10th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>When Gorum died, shards of his divine being rained down. One of these warshards landed in an ooze being transported outside of Oenopion. The newly empowered creature escaped its confines and headed south toward the Mana Wastes. The Nexian forces haven't be able to deal with it, and have turned to hiring mercenaries. The Pathfinder Society learns of this chance to get their hands on another warshard, and has an arclord ally get them on the short list of candidates.</p>
                   <p>The PCs must prove their mettle over the other candidates before tracking this newly divine war ooze along the borders to the waste. What's more, the Mana Wastes aren't going to make this mission any easier, and since no one yet understands the full impact that warshards might have on creatures, there's no telling the capabilities of this war ooze.</p>

                   <h2>Organized Play Community Survey</h2>
                   <p>Paizo Organized Play is seeking feedback on our programs as we look to Starfinder Second Edition and beyond. Whether you’ve been playing Organized Play for years, have just joined the Society, or haven’t yet played a game with us, we’re looking for your thoughts on our programs.</p>
                   <p>The survey below should take 5-10 minutes to complete, and the data will be invaluable to the future of our programs. Please take the survey and spread the word! It won’t be open for very long, so don’t be like me and open it in a tab expecting to get back to it later.</p>

                   <h2>Sanctioning Update</h2>
                   <p>Big month for sanctioning! You could even say it’s…<em>mythic</em>. I mean, I wouldn’t, but you could. <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/warofimmortals"><em>Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></a> was released last week and is <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">now sanctioned for Pathfinder Society play</a>! The exemplar and animist classes are freely available to all Pathfinder Society characters (whose players own the book, anyway), and the exemplar archetype is available as a one-character-only boon in the Boon Store. Go forth and enjoy your mythic power*!</p>
                   <p>Sanctioning documents for the Curtain Call Adventure Path have also been posted on the product and landing pages, for those of you in an operatic mood. This month, expect to see the sanctioning of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02oal/discuss?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Divine-Mysteries"><em>Lost Omens: Divine Mysteries</em></a>, filled with more information on gods than you can shake a <em>wand of bless</em> at!</p>
                   <p><em>*Some restrictions apply, see scenarios for details, results may vary, do not consume mythic berries without first consulting your healer.</em></p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Guide to Organized Play Revisions</h2>
                   <p>After soliciting community feedback, the Guide to Organized Play has been updated with the following changes:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>“Run as Written” has been retitled to “Run Prudently,” and its restrictions have been clarified and loosened.</li>
                    <li>The “Permitted Table Adjustments” section has been added to the Game Master’s portion of the guide, copying much of the same text.</li>
                    <li>Pathfinder Society agents now have access to all uncommon languages, where previously they only had access to certain uncommon <em>regional</em></li>
                   </ul>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>
                   <p>This month, one new Campaign Coin was awarded! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and reasons.</p>
                   <p>Congratulations to <strong>Tom Gross</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #866.</p>
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had <strong>six</strong> different GMs reach their fifth rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Gerald Colliou, Michael Morairty, Willis Sloat, Don Treadway</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Nova</strong><strong>(SFS1)</strong>: Charlene (Half the Sky), Darrel Curry</p>
                   <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Conventions</h2>
                   <p>Convention season may be winding down, but we’ve still got plenty of local conventions on the horizon! Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Conventions calendar</a> for dozens of upcoming events to get your Paizo fix in.</p>
                   <p>We’re also still seeking GMs to <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6wi29?Call-to-Volunteer-PAX-Unplugged-2024">join us at PAX Unplugged</a> in December! Run three games for us, and you’ll get a free badge into the show. This show will be the first chance for you to try out the new Pathfinder Quest board game, and you won’t want to miss that!</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Until next time adventurers—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And don’t forget to fill out the survey!</p>

                   <p><strong>WHO CONQUERS THE CONQUERORS?</strong></p>
                   <p>A group of heroes from the Pact Worlds has arrived to witness the political event of the century: the signing of a treaty between the warlike Veskarium and the ruthless Azlanti Star Empire. The two galactic powers have agreed to coexist on a backwater world called Kehtaria, where both empires have established bases of operations. Hoping to avert future devastating wars between the pair of superpowers, champions of the Pact Worlds attend the negotiations to ensure the birth of a new interstellar alliance and take part in the first steps toward lasting peace in the galaxy. That is, until it all goes wrong.</p>
                   <p>A treacherous political conspiracy threatens to disrupt the diplomatic proceedings when a surprise invasion by a new power shakes the planet. An armada of Azlanti forces calling themselves the Sihedron Guard attack Kehtaria, targeting Azlanti forces on the ground, their Veskarium allies, and anyone else unlucky enough to get in their way. If the heroes can survive this orbital bombardment and help defeat the invaders, they will discover evidence of another plot—a plot not to gain territory or resources, but to destroy them. It’s up to the heroes to save the galaxy, or to bear witness as it’s devoured.</p>

                   <p>Four veteran adventurers—the barbarian Amiri, the wizard Ezren, the cleric Kyra, and her wife, the elven rogue Merisiel—witness the Godsrain and, with their newfound mythic power, find themselves on the trail of fell forces looking to capitalize on the chaos sown by Gorum’s death. Using their unique skills, nascent god-sparks, and even the firsthand blessings of one of Golarion's most potent deities, they must race against time and fate to prevent the greatest threat to Golarion from escaping an impenetrable prison. From fan-favorite author Liane Merciel (<em>Hellknight</em>,&nbsp;<em>Nightglass</em>,&nbsp;<em>War of Immortals</em>) comes a truly iconic adventure of high fantasy set in the award-winning world of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Follow the heroes from the desert bazaars of Osirion to the heart of the permanent hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego and watch as they come to terms with their own mortality, the tenuous powers of the immortal gods, and the new world that unfolds before them in the wake of the Godsrain.</p>
                   <p><em>Godsrain: A Pathfinder Novel </em>is also available in audiobook format.</p>

                   <p>Mined on the frigid planet of Vesk-8, shimmerstone is a psychically active crystalline ore known to have a calming effect on emotions. After a wave of powerful cosmic energy ripples across the galaxy, shimmerstone changes, suddenly becoming unstable as it resonates with the psychic cries of a strange new god.</p>
                   <p>All across Vesk-8, shimmerstone mines suffer disaster after disaster. While many corporations react with attempts to sweep these events under the metaphorical rug, Shim-Tek desperately seeks outside agents to visit their shimmerstone mine, investigate the disturbance, and rescue any imperiled miners still on site.</p>

                   <p>Silvertree Village is a small settlement within the Forest of Spirits that’s not far off the Spirit Road, the trade route tracing the southern coast of the forest. It's a smaller river crossing, but it’s often used when Ohira's inns are full, and some travelers even prefer using it. Or they did, until they found access to the village cut off by a mysterious fog. Word has reached the Pathfinder Society of this strange phenomenon, and they have resolved to investigate the issue, as the Society has also had cause to rest in Silvertree when transporting relics between Hongal and Minkai.</p>
                   <p>The PCs are tasked with finding out the cause of the fog. Before their work is done, they'll face challenges set upon their path by a kami and must learn what has upset them—and in doing so, perhaps uncover something much more dangerous.</p>

                   <p>Welcome to Arniselle, an aquatic world where colorful morlamaws once worshipped cosmic horrors—or did they? Local Starfinder Hinevera is determined to prove that her people’s ancient past isn’t all foul cosmic entities! Years of extensive research and fieldwork have led her to multiple promising ancient ruins that could shed light on the broader history and beliefs of ancient morlamaws. But as the tides turn and Hinevera and her team fail to make contact, one thing becomes clear: something is wrong.</p>
                   <p>Travel to the planet of Arniselle and explore ancient ruins while on a rescue mission submerged beneath the waves!</p>

                   <p>Some disgruntled citizens in Kintargo, who preferred things as they were under Chelaxian rule, have stolen some very sensitive information concerning the Pathfinder Society's trade dealings and trade routes. In the hands of their enemies, this could put many agents at risk. Cheliax barely tolerates the Society on a good day, and if these thieves-who-would-be-spies can get the encrypted information into the hands of real Chelaxian intelligence operatives, Cheliax would likely relish its ability to deal incalculable harm. It's up to the PCs to infiltrate the thieves' base of operations and steal the information back before these rabble rousers can send it off. Keeping things quiet will be key, though, as the heads of Supplies and Procurement definitely don't want to tip the thieves off to the importance of what they really have.</p>

                   <p>Hello! I'm <b>Steven Hammond</b> (he/they). I've been a contributor to numerous Pathfinder books and scenarios. I wrote the entry on Vulot for <em>War of Immortals</em>. Folklore is very near and dear to me, and I tried to lean into it when writing Vulot. I wanted to communicate the menace and danger of them in a way that felt organic, like it had been discovered in some dusty cabinet in Sandpoint. I'm really proud of the result, and I'm so honored to have been part of the fantastic team that worked on this book.</p>

                   <p><b>Steven T. Helt</b> has been a Paizo contributor since 2013 when he won that year's RPG Superstar talent search. Since then, he's contributed to a number of products as author, designer, developer, and editor. Most of his credits are in the role of Famine of the Four Horsemen group, with dozens of products under his belt. His Paizo credits since Pathfinder Second Edition include the Kingmaker Adventure Path and <em>War of Immortals</em>, where he designed the apocalypse rider mythic destiny and the terrifying Weaver of Webs.

I wrote the broken chain mythic destiny, and I loved every little piece of lore and crunch that went into it, so I hope it shows. As a Latin American author, the topic of revolution and standing up to tyrants permeates our collective history, and even still our present in some LatAm nations, so I had a lot to draw from. If you liked the broken chain, you might like <a href="https://www.ajneuro.com/pf2freecontent">more stuff I've written for Pathfinder Second Edition</a>, and if you're looking for a GM, I run online games through Foundry, some of them in <a href="https://www.ajneuro.com/ex-nihilo">my setting of Ex Nihilo</a>.

                   <p>Hi, my name is <b>Tony Saunders</b>! I am one of the co-founders of Team+, which is where I spend most of my time writing these days. I have been credited under several Legendary Games titles, <em>Battlezoo Bestiary: Strange and Unusual</em>, the <em>Gardener's Guide to Gaming</em>, and a few other projects on DriveThruRPG and Pathfinder Infinite. What time I don't spend being a software engineer and father, I spend writing (mostly for TTRPGs). I wrote the beast lord mythic destiny, which was a lot of fun to write since I am a huge fan of companions and familiars in Pathfinder. Lucky to be a part of such a stacked team of authors.</p>

                   <p>Happy fall, Pathfinders!<br>
                     We’ve got two excellent adventures for you this month: a scenario and a quest.</p>
                   <p>First, we go to Silvertree Village, a small settlement within the Forest of Spirits in northern Tian Xia, not far off the Spirit Road—the trade route following the outskirts of that forest. It's a smaller river crossing, but is often used when the larger Ohira's inns are full, and some travelers even prefer using it. Or they did until a mysterious fog prevented anyone from reaching it. Word has reached the Pathfinder Society of this strange phenomenon and agents (that’s you) have been dispatched to investigate and resolve the issue. That’s easier said than done, though, as there will be challenges put for by a kami themselves, and in order to learn what has upset this being, something much more dangerous will be uncovered.

                   <p>Then we go to the other side of Golarion in Ravounel. Some disgruntled citizens in Kintargo, who preferred things under Chelaxian rule, have stolen some very sensitive information concerning the Pathfinder Society's trade dealings and routes. In the hands of enemies, this could put many agents at risk. Cheliax barely tolerates the Society on a good day, and if these thieves-who-would-be-spies can get the encrypted information into the hands of real Chelaxian intelligence operatives, Cheliax would likely relish its ability to do incalculable harm.</p>
                   <p>It's up to some intrepid Pathfinder agents (again, that’s you) to infiltrate the thieves' base of operations and steal the info back before these rabble rousers can send it off. Keeping things quiet will be key, though, as we definitely don't want to tip them off to what they really have.</p>

And while you’re at it, get one for yourself too! Paizo offers a variety of subscription options across our brands for rulebooks, adventures, accessories, and more.</p>
                   <h2>How Do Paizo Subscriptions Work?</h2>
                   <p>Paizo Subscriptions ensure you receive every release in the lines that matter most to you! When you subscribe to a line, you are given the option to start with the current release (the most recently released book) or the next release in that sub. You won’t be charged for your subscription until the product ships—giving you ample time to skip a release if you need to!</p>
                   <p>Some subscription lines, like Pathfinder Adventure Paths, release monthly, while others release on a slower schedule, usually 3–4 products per year. If you need to step back, Paizo Subscriptions can be canceled at any time by contacting Customer Service.</p>
                   <h2>Subscription Benefits</h2>
                   <p>Paizo values our subscribers as the backbone of our business, and we want to ensure they feel appreciated! We offer a number of perks for subscribing—with greater benefits applied for each sub you have.</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Early access and free PDFs: Subscribers receive free PDFs of any book they subscribe to. These PDFs are granted to their paizo.com account when the physical product ships—sometimes as early as two weeks before the&nbsp;street date!</li>
                    <li>20% off Society Scenarios: Pathfinder and Starfinder Society subscribers get 20% off the cover price of scenarios when they subscribe.</li>
                    <li>30% off Pathfinder Battles: Pathfinder Battles subscribers receive their miniatures at a 30% discount off Paizo’s prices.</li>
                    <li>Subscribing to four or more lines gives access to Paizo Advantage!</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3>Paizo Advantage</h3>
                   <p>Paizo Advantage is a 15% discount available to anyone subscribing to four or more qualifying lines. Paizo Advantage also includes a free subscription to either Pathfinder Society Scenarios or Starfinder Society Scenarios—with both Society subscriptions included for free if you subscribe to six or more lines!</p>

Larger than life mythic heroes demand equally terrifying threats, and we made sure to load some up for your adventures.</p>
                   <p>First, there’s a variety of mythic role templates. These role templates are based on four of the base road maps for monster creation presented in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eok?Pathfinder-GM-Core"><em>GM Core</em></a>, to help make it easy to create your own mythic monsters from scratch, but they can be applied to any existing monster. Each of these templates is also presented with a pre-templated monster to show what it looks like in practice, so in addition to the monsters I’ll be talking about next (which have tons of story elements and hooks included), you also have stat blocks for the mythic gogiteth, mythic ogre boss, mythic lich, and mythic griffon to show simple examples of mythic monsters across a variety of levels.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6f4562b9-4430-4569-a087-3eaadcf0475f/PZO12006_OliphauntsRampage_2000.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6f4562b9-4430-4569-a087-3eaadcf0475f/PZO12006_OliphauntsRampage_2000.jpg" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Art by Sandra Posada: a large oliphaunt rampaging through a battlefield "></a>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>However, truly mythic monsters are terrifying forces whose impact shapes the world itself, and we’ve packaged up seven of the most wondrous creatures imaginable to expand your games with. Each of these monsters includes a couple pages of lore and fiction showcasing them in the game world, as well as examples of how to deploy them in adventures across all levels of play. A party of 5th-level characters likely won’t face the demon lord Vulot directly in combat, but his activities can steer the course of their destinies even at that humble point in their careers!</p>
                   <p>Some mythic monsters, like the beautiful and ephemeral creatures known as sublime breaths, might use their mythic powers to evade the party. Relatively weak as a combatant, a sublime breath might dance forever out of the party’s reach while possessing an essential key to whatever plot they seek to unravel. Only by outwitting and outmaneuvering one of these elusive fey will the party be able to truly overcome the challenge they represent.</p>
                   <p>Other terrifying monsters like the kaiju Agyra might be engaged with as a disastrous series of hazards at lower levels, only for a party that survives an encounter to grow in power and finally face Agyra in true combat. Wielding mythic weapons, clad in mythic armor, and enshrined in mythic power, will your party be able to cut through Agyra’s conjured hurricanes and strike down one of the most massively monstrous creatures to ever terrorize Golarion?</p>
                   <p>To match might and wits with these mystical mythic monsters, be sure to preorder <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq06sfx?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals"><em>War of Immortals</em> product page</a> today!</p>

                 <div itemprop="articleBody">
                  <div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;">
                   <a href="/image/content/Blog/PZO12006_Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/PZO12006_Preview_500.jpeg"></a>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">A couple of weeks ago we answered the question, “What is Mythic?” That answer spoke to the foundational mythic rules you can find in <em>War of Immortals</em>, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only possible answer to the question.</p>
                   <p>The base system for mythic characters tracks alongside your character’s level. At low levels, mythic power is explosive; though highly limited in its applications, it provides a significant change in outcome when it’s applied. As you level up, your mythic power becomes more predictable and you gain access to a wider array of possible applications, but the degree to which it shifts the dial of success normalizes somewhat, reflecting the character’s growth into a mature mythic figure capable of reliably battling mythic threats. This was not the only concept for how mythic rules could be deployed, however. While working on this project, we imagined several alternative ways people might want to experience the mythic system.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5d778361-06a0-4a48-963a-74630049c1ae/PZO12006-HC_StarstoneCathedralTransformed_2000x1320.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5d778361-06a0-4a48-963a-74630049c1ae/PZO12006-HC_StarstoneCathedralTransformed_2000x1320.png" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Art by Sandra Posada.

                   <br>
                   <p>What if you wanted to have an experience where you had one mythic character surrounded by a group of highly competent non-mythic characters, a la cult classic cartoon <em>Mighty Max</em>? What if you want the pacing of the mythic elements of your story to exist separately from standard level-based progression, either having your mythic power grow more slowly or instead having your mythic power outpace your level for more high-risk/high-octane adventures?</p>
                   <p>While we think that the mythic rules published in <em>War of Immortals</em> represent the ideal version of the system as we would like people to experience it, we wrote all kinds of alternate ideas that didn’t match that experience and didn’t fit inside what was already an impressively meaty book. Rather than letting those ideas gather dust in an untouched folder, we thought we’d share them with you!</p>
                   <p>On the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq06sfx?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals"><em>War of Immortals</em> product page</a>, you’ll find a link to a web PDF product titled “<a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/PZO12006AlternateMythicRules.pdf">Mythic Variant Rules</a>” that gives you a variety of new ways to play with the mythic system in your home games! These rules aren’t necessarily as stable a table experience as the ones we printed in the main book, but we expect that the right group might find them invaluable and a great way to push the boundaries of the game. We’ve also made sure to attach the ORC license to this product, to ensure easy use of these alternate rules and ideas by any 3pp contributors out there!</p>
                   <p>Pop on over to the product page, preorder <em>War of Immortals</em> if you haven’t already, and download this free expansion product today! You’ll also notice that while we were putting this PDF together, we went ahead and slipped in a handful of clarifications onto the final page to make your battles in the War of Immortals just a little bit smoother and easier to use.</p>

                   <h2>Chapter 2: Ancestries</h2>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Barathu</strong>: Manifold Evolution only lets you select lower level feats.</li>

                   </ul>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Chapter 3: Classes</h2>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Envoy:</strong> Effortless influencer is higher level, and Distant Feint gives Feint the emotion trait.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mystic:</strong> You know the Hit Points totals of your bonded allies, you regain all your Vitality Network when you Refocus, Transfer Vitality always heals void creatures, you become expert in Perception at level 11, Group Chat now gets you Network Spell (and it’s stronger), Force Connection is now a feat, shadow connection works against darkvision, Adaptive Defense has a transfer cost, and elemental mystic’s <em>elemental weapon</em> spell now scales properly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operative:</strong> You begin Expert in Will, Snipers now ignore unwieldy all the time, Strikers can now use unarmed Strikes and should be able to use their melee weapons with most Operative features and feats, Hair Trigger now only applies to your last Aimed enemy, Relentless Aim now ricochets, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Double Draw</span> Twin Draw gives you an Aim, and you can no longer quality for Twin Shooter with an Ancestry feat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solarian: </strong>Let there be the light trait (while photon-attuned). You can also pick up two-handed solar weapons, your class DC scales better, and Black Hole/Super Nova no longer cycle. You also no longer get armor specialization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soldier:</strong> Primary target now Strikes before you hit with an area attack or automatic fire, decreasing the target’s successful save into a failure. Run Hot will overheat your gun. Hammer the Nail now knocks prone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Witchwarper:</strong> Witchwarper gets Quantum Pulse as a class feature at 1st level. Restorative Recollection has been revised. Infinite Magic can’t be used with 10th-rank spells.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Chapter 6: Equipment</h2>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Neural lash has the analog trait. Force needle has 1 upgrade slot. Crossbolter is in the crossbow group.</li>
                    <li><strong>Armor Upgrades:</strong> Explosive Defense unit grants resistance instead of non-stacking save bonuses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weapon Upgrades:</strong> Nothing can stop you from deploying your advanced tripod as much as you want.</li>

                   </ul>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Chapter 7: Spells</h2>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong><em>Adhere: </em></strong>We have separated the Reflex save from <em>adhere</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Akashic Revival:</em></strong><em> Akashic revival</em> is a ten minute spell.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Analyze Target: </em></strong><em>Analyze target</em> grants a status bonus.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Atomic Blast: </em></strong><em>Atomic blast </em>uses a basic Reflex save, and the radiation uses your Spellcasting DC.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Void Whispers:</em></strong><em> Void whispers</em> uses all three actions to move.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Vibe Check</em>: </strong>After checking its vibe, we’ve removed the incapacitation trait from<em> vibe check</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Elemental Weapon:</em></strong><em> Elemental</em><em>weapon</em> now scales properly.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <br>

                   <br>
                   <p>We know there are other areas that need attention, but some of those require more systemic changes that aren’t appropriate midstream and need tinkering “in the workshop.” Here are some elements on our radar we want people to know about but aren’t not quite ready to act on yet:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>reviewing overall mechanics for grenades and missiles</li>
                    <li>envoy getting some abilities to Size Up in combat</li>
                    <li>solarian Solar Shot becoming more like a weapon that works alongside weapon crystals; change to range increment instead of range</li>
                    <li>punching up effectiveness on Disharmony trait abilities for the solarian</li>
                    <li>looking at the size of the quantum field, as well as baking in Transposition to be part of the base class chassis</li>

                   <br>
                   <p>Empires Devoured is our mid–high level adventure that starts at 10th level and places the PCs right at the signing of a peace treaty between the Azlanti Star Empire and the Veskarium on the conflicted world of Kehtaria in the city of Atuity (somewhere showcased in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02egv?Starfinder-Ports-of-Call"><em>Starfinder Ports of Call</em></a>). It’s a historic moment, with the PCs arriving in system on the acclaimed <em>Sunrise Maiden</em> starship to act as observers from the Pact Worlds. Everything is going great… until it’s not.</p>
                   <p>See, there’s been some upheaval in the Star Empire, and as the adventure progresses, the PCs quickly learn about a new Azlanti leader. This leader (a fellow we’ve previewed on the <em>Starfinder GM</em><em>Core</em> cover) doesn’t quite have intergalactic peace as part of their grand vision, and they unleash their armada and armies to put an end to the peace treaty. It’s up to the PCs—well, when is it not up to them, really?—to step up and protect Atuity from attackers.</p>
                   <p>Some diehard Pathfinder First Edition fans might notice some similarities between a particular creature summoned by the Azlanti and a divine herald confronted long ago during a <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8we6?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-4-26-The-Waking-Rune">notable Pathfinder Society Scenario</a>. What can I say, I love a good lore deep cut.</p>

                   <p>Of course, protecting a world from the nascent war of two interstellar powers isn’t enough. No, there’s a lot more going behind the scenes that the PCs are going to need to suss out and then confront head on. That threat might want to explode a chain of suns, so it’s a BIG deal.</p>
                   <p>However, along the way, there may be casualties… pour one out for everyone’s favorite starship.</p>

                   <p>That covers it for big spoilers for the adventure. <em>Starfinder</em><em>Empires Devoured</em> is about setting up the future for Starfinder in Second Edition, as well as giving the players a chance to be “big damn heroes” during a major galactic event.</p>
                   <p>As part of the playtest period, this adventure is also a chance for us to get more people playtesting Starfinder Second Edition. Speaking of which, stay tuned for tomorrow, when the Starfinder team will be unleashing the next wave of errata, along with more extensive updates focused around some of the classes—can you say, hello two-handed weapon solarians?</p>
                   <p>Thanks all! I really hope you enjoy this monumental adventure that I got to write.</p>

                   <p>Not including mythic feats and mythic items, there are two types of mythic magic presented in <em>War of Immortals</em>: mythic spells and mythic rituals.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Mythic spells can only be cast by mythic characters, and they require expending a Mythic Point as part of their casting. These spells cover all four traditions and cover all spell ranks from 1st to 10th. They span the gamut from the whimsical 3rd-rank <em>travel by turtle</em>, which summons a massive turtle that can eventually carry you and an entire army across oceans, to devastating spells of ultimate power, like the 10th-rank incarnate spell <em>summon Oliphaunt of Jandelay</em>, which brings forth a manifestation of one of the most fearsome avatars of annihilation to obliterate your foes.</p>
                   <p>Mythic rituals take longer to cast, requiring a primary caster capable of making a given check at mythic proficiency and a number of supporting casters, but their effects are even farther-reaching and typically more permanent. The terrifying 8th-rank <em>awaken curse</em> ritual imbues a curse with life and sentience, transforming it into a predatory force resistant to being counteracted and capable of spreading itself to new victims. The potent 9th-rank <em>ocean’s roar</em> ritual can bring a great body of water to life, transforming a lake or sea into an elemental capable of causing tsunamis and choosing who it allows to travel across, under, or through it.</p>
                   <p>These spells and rituals aren’t the only tools your magical characters can find in <em>War of Immortals</em>; there are also mythic feats like Mythic Magic and destinies like the limitless Wildspell.

He decided Skyreach needed a rooftop garden all on his own when he’d chided Sorrina Westyr, the Master of Spells, that the building itself was lacking in nature’s presence.

It took years, but the project was finally bearing fruit—literally.</p>
                   <p>He decided that its presence should be unknown to the rest of the organization, until the time was right. A garden atop the building should have been noteworthy of notice, but it surprised him just how rarely people looked up. Likely those who did just assumed it was supposed to be there. Though the garden was not a neat and tidy thing and instead resembled a sort of wild thicket in the sky, bordered by magically strengthened brickwork to keep the soil in. There was, of course, a reason for each plant and a purpose for their placement, but Urwal saw no need to share such things. He believed that anyone with the talent and patience to study the stars would understand why he does whatever he does. Though recent events had left even the pillar of self-assuredness that is Urwal incredibly shaken.</p>

                   <p>It was not long ago that an incredible and terrifying sight filled the sky: Achaekek slew Gorum, and parts of the now-dead god rained down upon Golarion. Urwal had been going more often to this garden after seeing that spectacle and hearing reports of its effects across the world. This garden was a place of calm for him, where he hoped to find clarity to help guide the Society forward, but even that was failing him now. “I should have seen something in the stars.” He sighed, expressing his frustration to the immobile plants atop the otherwise empty rooftop. He continued quietly to himself, “Omens may be lost, but I’ve seen many hints of things to come before. But this Godsrain, I saw no sign of it. Gave no preparations. Agents were in danger and I did not prepare them.” He paused, looking over his garden. “I must do better.”</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Urwal’s bright yellow scales shone in the afternoon sun as he went to water the various plant life he’d nurtured atop the grand spire, finally finding some mental peace. He even allowed himself a chuckle as he thought of the reaction Ambrus Valsin, the venture-captain in charge of day-to-day operations in Skyreach, would have when this garden was revealed. “It’ll need to happen when Ambrus is in a good mood. He’ll complain about it, but he’ll come around.” As he moved to water a rather healthy raspberry bush, he noticed an unnatural shine coming from the berries upon it. It reminded him of the silver that rained from the sky the day Gorum fell.</p>
                   <p>“What have we here?” he asked himself as he quickly finished watering the remainder of his garden before moving to examine the berries more closely. His troubles forgotten, he spent the remaining afternoon into the evening studying the altered fruit. Bringing the full suite of his knowledge to bear, Urwal was able to determine a few things. First, the berries now held divine power within them. He’d heard stories of those who were touched by the silver rains gaining power, but it was strange that only the berries seemed affected and not any of the other myriad plants he’d raised. “Might be the water choice,” he mused as he considered the various springs he’d transport water from. “It’s possible any one of those could be the source,” he thought aloud, recalling the complex web of watering choices largely determined by his astrological readings. Second, these berries did not ripen further or seem to change at all once removed from the bush. “Maybe I didn’t notice the coming of the Godsrain, but it would seem I made preparations all the same.”</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>The coming days were filled with experiments and tests, until Urwal decided that he wasn’t going to learn anything significant without some risk. He ate one of the berries. The effect was immediate. It wasn’t so much that he grew stronger as it was that he was more himself than he’d ever been. The confidence he’d always felt concerning his path almost glowed within. “This is… divinity?” An ember of power glowed within him, though he could feel that its power was temporary. “Oh my. These, these must be kept close and safe. I will find a way to use them. The stars will know. This time, I will be better. I will see that they’re prepared for whatever it is that would have our agents needing such power.” A grin crossed his lizard-like face. “After all. I planted these for a reason. Now I need only find out what that reason is.”</p>

                   <p>The Holds of Belkzen have tenuously come together thanks to the vision and martial prowess of their leader, Ardax the White-Hair, to stand against Tar-Baphon. However, this peace is fragile as ambitions stir and conspirators whisper against the current leadership. Aware that a nation divided can’t stand against its foes, Ardax has invited a group of dignitaries to a special event: Torrentmoot, where old grudges will be soothed, and history will be made!</p>
                   <p>The PCs are among these dignitaries, working to further their own ambitions and hoping to witness the historic formation of a truly unified Belkzen. But not everyone is interested in peace, and some would prefer to drag the worst parts of the orcs’ history out of the past and into the present.</p>

                   <p>This year’s theme is “Pioneers of Change: Shaping the Future”—a focus on Hispanic and Latine people paving the way for future generations. As part of our call for contributors, we asked folks who those pioneers were in their own lives!</p>
                   <p>But enough from me. Let me turn it over to some of our lovely Latine writers!</p>

                   <h3>Joseph Blomquist (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>¿Qué es la que hay? For those who don’t know me, I’m Joe, a Nuyorican freelancer known for scene-stealing ambiance and annoyingly attractive NPCs (just ask my devs). But today I get to talk about one of the pillars in my family: my granduncle, Rudy.</p><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/59b0470c-1450-4de8-b011-4b715adaf322/rudy-hernandez-pic4.jpg"><img width="350px" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/59b0470c-1450-4de8-b011-4b715adaf322/rudy-hernandez-pic4.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Baseball card for Rudy Hernandez, Pitcher for the Washington Senators"></a>
                   <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                   <p>In 1960, the Washington Senators (eventually the Minnesota Twins) signed the first Dominican-born pitcher in Major League Baseball, Rudy Hernández (beating Juan Marichal by two weeks). Rudy grew up in New York, with our family avoiding much of Trujillo’s reign in the Dominican Republic (despite a few of El Jefe’s diplomats coming from our family). In those days, most of the Dominican and Puerto Rican players were close, playing in the Caribbean winter leagues, and it was his friend, Roberto Clemente, who finally convinced Rudy to become a pitcher. After pitching for both incarnations of the Washington Senators, Rudy continued in Triple-A baseball throughout the 60s. Eventually, he became a scout for the Orioles and Cubs and returned to Puerto Rico to coach for the Department of Sports and Recreation, for Orlando Cepeda’s baseball school, and to run his own baseball camp in San Juan. He passed in 2022.</p>
                   <p>Baseball wasn’t my sport, but that never mattered to Tío Rudy. For as little time as I got to spend with him, his tireless cultivation of Caribbean Latine talent for the sport he loved inspired my own desires to help grow our community with new and diverse voices. He taught me to persevere despite setbacks and how to set my goals high while still being flexible enough to change the game as needed.</p>

                   <h3>Carlos Cabrera (he/they)</h3>
                   <p>Hi everyone! For this year’s theme, I wanted to focus on the person who helped set me on my path: my late father.</p>
                   <p>To begin, I can say I definitely got my sense of humor from him. We are a mixed-race family, and he used to say that he was Cornucopian because he was so many things and that he came from Cornucopia. In my childhood, I grew up with a younger sister and two older brothers. It wasn’t until much later that I found out I had even more siblings, but back when it was just the four of us, my brothers and I each had a separate video game console. I had an Intellivision, Felipe had a Vectrex, and Esteban (we all call him Rico) had a Colecovision. Later, when I upgraded to an NES and then the SEGA Genesis, I found the game that made me decide what I wanted to do with my life— <em>Flashback: The Quest for Identity</em> (womp womp).</p>
                   <p>There’s a lot I wish I could show my dad nowadays, but most importantly of all, I want to tell him that it worked. At least part-time, anyway. I’m sure for him it would be more than enough.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Welcome friends! We are now <em>checks watch</em> about 26 days away from the release of <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02oar">War of Immortals</a></em>, and there’s an important question I wanted to answer for all of you. Namely, “What is mythic?”</p>
                   <p>For those of you who played Pathfinder First Edition or Owlcat’s CRPG conversion of the Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path, you might have an idea. In those games, mythic was an extra layer of power and resource that sat on top of your normal character, elevating and enhancing them to incredible levels of power via mythic paths, which were not entirely dissimilar to Pathfinder Second Edition’s archetypes (assuming you use the free archetype variant rules, and all the archetypes were super juiced with options that kick the ceiling off the base game!).</p>
                   <p>For <em>War of Immortals</em>, we went back to the roots of all the inspirations that went into the previous iterations of mythic rules and reimagined them from the ground up as a unique storytelling tool to enhance the narrative abilities of Pathfinder Second Edition.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8445b2cd-7e08-445c-8dc7-c53bbab6a1c0/PZO12006_AMythicStory_2000x1333.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8445b2cd-7e08-445c-8dc7-c53bbab6a1c0/PZO12006_AMythicStory_2000x1333.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Illustration by Oleksii Chernik: Iconic heroes, Samo and Nahoa, sitting around a fire with a group of orcs telling stories"></a>

                   <br>
                   <p>Mythic adventures take their inspiration from legends, folktales, and other storytelling traditions around the world. These tales use wordplay and rarefied prose to convey moral lessons and tell stories that often defy logic. Mythic heroes and villains, even at lower levels of play, possess fantastical powers that are unbound by physics, and their ability to impact the narrative of the game world is often much more profound than is typical for a PC or NPC. To tell these stories we use five essential elements: Mythic Points, mythic proficiency, Callings, mythic feats, and mythic destinies.</p>
                   <p>When you first gain mythic power, this is expressed by your mythic Calling. Your calling gives you a unique way to spend and regain Mythic Points, makes you exceptionally hard to kill, presents you with a set of edicts and anathemas related to the purpose of your mythic power, and gives you the special Rewrite Fate ability, which allows you to use a Mythic Point to reroll a skill check or saving throw at mythic proficiency.</p>
                   <p>Mythic proficiency is a proficiency tier beyond legendary. Where legendary proficiency gives you a proficiency bonus of +8, mythic proficiency gives you a proficiency bonus of +10, and you might be able to use your mythic proficiency in specific ways as early as 1st level, allowing you to overcome challenges that would normally be far beyond a character of your level!</p>
                   <p>Mythic feats give you new ways to utilize your Mythic Points. Many of these expand the types of checks or other rolls you can make at mythic proficiency. Others, like the Divert Destiny mythic feat presented below, allow you to seize control of the narrative and dictate how your story unfolds.</p>

                    <p>You defy the fate before you, calling on wells of mythic vitality to sustain your life and allow you to persevere. You expend 1 Mythic Point and survive the triggering attack or effect, lose the wounded or dying conditions entirely, don’t increase your doomed condition, and are conscious and standing with a number of Hit Points equal to 10 + your level, regardless of how many Hit Points you had before.</p>

                   <p>The final element of the new mythic rules, mythic destinies, gives you even more fantastic abilities and helps enshrine your character with an eternal place in the game world. Characters inclined toward cruelty or entropy might gain the apocalypse rider mythic destiny and spread war or famine across the world. Benevolent characters might instead become an ascended celestial, joining the heavenly ranks as an angel or azata to fight evil for all time. Characters with stronger ties to the mortal world might become prophesied monarchs or eternal legends, mighty leaders who are constantly reborn when the world needs them most. A rare few might even seek to complete the mythic destiny of a godling, joining the ranks of ascended deities like Irori and Iomedae!</p>

                   <p>We’ve got a quick update for you this month, so I wanted to highlight a couple of things here at the top. Every year I see people ask for spooky scenarios for October, so Rue put together a collection of some of our spookiest, creepiest, and downright scariest adventures <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6x7ix?Fall-Frights-and-Delights">on the blog</a>!</p>
                   <p>As some of you with keen eyes noticed, I did some poking around in the backend a couple of weeks ago to start setting up Starfinder Society (second edition). In doing so, I temporarily moved the Acquisitives faction into the new program. I have put it back where it belongs and I don’t believe any characters were harmed in the process, but if you notice lingering issues, please do let me know!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2>
                   <p>These adventures will be available on October 30, 2024.</p>

                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2>
                   <p>A quiet month on the sanctioning front! We did manage to get Pathfinder adventure <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq03w9w?Pathfinder-Adventure-Prey-for-Death"><em>Prey for Death</em></a>’s sanctioning documents out even before last month’s blog was posted, so you can now enjoy assassinating some folks and earning credit for PFS in the process! The Pathfinder <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/curtaincall">Curtain Call </a><a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/curtaincall">Adventure Path</a> is just about ready to be posted at press time, so keep an eye out for that as well.</p>
                   <p>This month, of course, the big news is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq06sfx?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals"><em>Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></a> and its two new classes. We’ll have that ready for you on its delayed street date, October 30 (sorry, shipping issues!). <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq07ouo?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Divine-Mysteries"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</em></a> is also chugging along and will be posted in November upon release.</p>

                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month we had five different GMs reach their fifth rank!</p>

                   <p>Our last marathon of Abomination Vaults was everything you’d hope from the finale of an Adventure Path. The sheer number of hours we clocked dwarfed all previous marathons of this project. We hardly slept, played our hardest, and even Golarion’s pantheon took notice. Rovagug delivered a 4.7 earthquake that shook our miniatures on the opening day, followed by Sarenrae and Tsukiyo providing us a solar eclipse after a 22-hour session to close out. Across the last decade of our Pathfinder projects, this marathon will always rank among the best, and you just had to be there.</p>

                   <p>After eighteen months of real time, our party of gunslingers had worked its way down through ten levels of Paizo’s largest megadungeon! We managed to get the doors open to some kind of temple that felt like it predated the construction of the Abomination Vaults themselves. This had to be it. This was the bottom level.</p>

                   <br>
                   <h2>Highlights from Marathon 7:</h2>
                   <p>□ Let’s start with the adult black dragon that we mentioned in the last blog. Never have we laid waste to any dragon in the fashion that we did here. Terrain was in its favor but irrelevant: Standing knee-deep in a swampy cavern doesn’t matter if your only actions are shoot, reload, shoot. Zoric, our unexpected sharpshooter, redefined the Black Arrow for Pathfinder when he landed a critical hit with his arquebus for 102 damage. Still, the dragon got a nice breath weapon off, along with a couple other attacks. We suppose it did take two rounds to bring it down – that’s just being respectful. About as respectful as cueing up “Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun” on our soundtrack while we sorted through its treasure.</p>
                   <p>&nbsp;□ We had to face a horde of Urdefhan to get their <em>Emerald Fulcrum Lens</em> and progress deeper into the Vaults. They had already summoned daemons, as you can see in the photo. The problem though, was that the author allowed our GM to decide if their current summoning ritual was successful or not. Of course it was, and Adam had a leukodaemon show up. Still, the bloodsuckers wanted bloodshed, and blood is what they got. Ever blow a hole through a transparent creature? It’s pretty cool.</p>
                   <p>□ The bottom level of the Abomination Vaults came complete with encounters that drew from all our experiences in the levels above. A month before the marathon, our GM gave us an assignment in the campaign’s Google Classroom: We had to submit three of our moments of success, along with three of our moments of failure throughout the campaign. The Path of Pleasant Memories on level ten thus became a fun tour through our favorite moments, remembered with fondness and smiles. The Path of Failure, however, was anything but. Adam turned this into a GM roast of the players with our lists of shortcomings – embellished further to his glee – and we had to take it in stride.</p>
                   <p>□ There are scenes in classic westerns where the protagonists get surprised by a circle of enemies on a ridge. We entered a room with a surrounding upper gallery that had a bunch of slits in the walls. It took us a second to realize the gallery was occupied by undead with blowguns, and the slits were for firing lanes – at us. What encounter could be more suited to a party of gunslingers than what the author himself described as a shooting gallery? Our steely performance here would have made those who had to settle for the O.K. Corral jealous. Everyone did their job, concentrated their fire on individual specters, and we pulled through with just a few pin pricks.</p>
                   <p>□ A bunch of glass golems were guarding an old section of Nhimbaloth’s temple on level ten. There was fantastic original art for them, and we guessed this might be a serious encounter for some groups. Asking us to shoot out windows with our BB guns that bypass physical resistance 10? Come on. This one was over so fast, including a competition to see if anyone could top the highest damage total in the campaign. Lady Sniper’s 82-damage shot was outdone by a 92-damage critical hit with Spellsling from our beast gunner. We couldn’t decide on whether Mazatl and his Penetrating Fire double-critical-hit counted.</p>

                   <h3>Character Deaths</h3>
                   <p>□ Deep in the cavern complex that comprises dungeon level nine, Belcorra seized another opportunity to ambush us. We’ve heard plenty of players over the years say “yeah, <em>phantasmal killer</em> is decent I guess, but they have to miss BOTH saving throws.” Vlai, founder of the Black Powder Cadre, missed both saves.</p>
                   <h3>The Arsenal</h3>
                   <p>Our goal with this project was to prove that you didn’t need balance or any specific role in a party to be successful in Pathfinder. We’re proud to have accomplished that goal. The outcome of the last encounter had nearly everything to do with prior decisions our players made on level ten, and very little to do with our characters or party composition. We have a lot of data and behind-the-scenes material to release in the wrap-up blog to come, which will help tell a larger story of how stable the game of Pathfinder 2E truly is – even with a severely unbalanced party of gunslingers. For now, we’ll celebrate another successful project in the books!</p>
                   <h3>Best Quote from Marathon 7</h3>
                   <p>(a trap goes off in a small room, and gas begins to fill the chamber)</p>
                   <p>Adam: “There are seven holes in the ceiling, each no larger than the size of a human finger.”</p>
                   <p>Theodora: “Okay, we could stick our fingers in the holes?”</p>
                   <p>Jody: “Just don’t use your trigger finger.”</p>
                   <h3>The Final Fight</h3>
                   <p>There she was, the ghost queen herself, flying high in one of the most impressive chambers we’d come across in this megadungeon. Accompanying her were four soul feeders: elite dread wisps we had unknowingly sent to the final battle from a previous encounter. Needless to say, we were sweating bullets. So much so, that we opened up with a fusillade of vicious anti-aircraft fire. Grundak began with his barricade buster, also known around the table as the 20mm cannon. Critical hit. The rest of us continued our blaze of glory, and with scrolls of <em>ghostly weapon </em>the results were staggering. The queen of the vaults suffered so much damage that she had no choice but to return fire with her nastiest spell first: <em>phantasmal calamity. </em>Breen, our medic, rolled a natural one and went down hard. We exchanged shots while the dread wisps surrounded us and began to use their Feed on Despair ability to devastating extent. It’s key to mention that we came in with many characters having been drained by an encounter with an isqulug, which allowed the wisps to use Feed on Despair from the start. Mazatl, Way of the Spellshot, held his breath one last time and zeroed in on his target. Critical hit to the incorporeal dome, completely destroying the ghost queen! Dropping Belcorra Haruvex in barely three rounds will always have a place in the annals of Amber Die history, but it didn’t stop the wisps from adding us to the pile of legends too. We weren’t exactly sure what we needed to do with the <em>fulcrum lenses</em> we had acquired in the levels above, and now Belcorra was gone. Tess Rajani, Way of the Drifter, made a last stand and tried everything she could to invest the lenses into what was left of Belcorra’s essence in the room, but to no avail. Yet, for everyone at the table who took our radical party of gunslingers through hundreds of hours of encounters, this was just a single fight.</p>
                   <p>Even though Belcorra won – so did we.</p>

                   <br>
                   <h2><strong>NEW FEATURES GALORE!&nbsp;</strong></h2>
                   <h3><strong>PDF EXPORT</strong></h3>
                   <p>One of the most frequently requested features—the ability to export Pathfinder Nexus characters to a PDF—is live and available for both <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/starfinder2e">Starfinder</a> and <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e">Pathfinder Nexus. W</a>hether you want to show off your own character or your favorite iconic, build your character in minutes and have them ready in an editable PDF in seconds.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3><strong>PREGEN CHARACTERS</strong></h3>
                   <p>The life of an adventurer is a dangerous one, so feel welcome to choose from one of many pregenerated characters to tackle danger head on! Whether you’re looking to leverage <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/character-sheet/637b5ac4-750c-414b-8f51-0c60d65161bf">Valeros’ fearlessness</a> or Cutie Killstuff’s deceptively bright smile, pregenerated characters are only a few clicks away. Want to make edits? Every pregen can be tweaked to your heart’s desire—this allows new and experienced users to take advantage of “recommended builds” from official Pathfinder 2e content to get into the game quickly. Pregen characters are available on both <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/starfinder2e">Starfinder</a> and <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e">Pathfinder</a>Nexus and are kept up to date as more and more content is released.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3><strong>CROSS-SYSTEM SUPPORT</strong></h3>
                   <p>Ever wanted to see what it was like to take the fiercest barbarian in Golarion and have them pilot a starship or find a missile launcher? Never let go of your dreams! You can select Pathfinder 2e content in Starfinder Nexus (and Starfinder 2e Playtest content in Pathfinder Nexus) during character creation.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3><strong>CRAFT, INVEST &amp; REST</strong></h3>
                   <p>Each character on Pathfinder Nexus can now track crafting projects, invested items, and rest/recovery rules:</p>
                   <h4><em>CRAFTING</em></h4>
                   <p>Start a new crafting project following Pathfinder 2e rules. Start a new project, select an item to begin building, roll for results, and select your degree of success. We’ll let you know the number of days spent, the total amount of funds spent, and even allow players to spend additional days on the project if needed. Didn’t roll well? Did Bandits disrupt your crafting efforts <em>again</em>? Save your project for later, and we’ll store it until you’re ready to try again.</p>
                   <h4><em>INVESTING&nbsp;</em></h4>
                   <p>Characters can now invest and track invested items on their character sheet. Not sure which treasure of yours can be invested? We’ve got it covered for you. You seek out the loot, and we’ll handle the logistics with the investment drawer. Don’t want to be constrained by the rules? Override the maximum number of invested items and walk around like the bedazzled kobold you’ve always wanted to be—we won’t stop you.</p>
                   <h4><em>RESTING</em></h4>
                   <p>Finally, we’ve finished our Rest &amp; Recovery system, which allows players to quickly see the benefits of rest and select any additional rest options relevant to their character, be it resting without shelter, sleeping in armor, or resetting all your prepared spells. With the Rest &amp; Recovery system completed, all relevant notes, penalties, or benefits should also be tracked for your review (we’re looking at you and your 2 hour ‘standby state,’ automatons).</p>

                   <p>Hail and well-met Pathfinders! I’m Alan Miranda, CEO of Ossian Studios, and I am excited to introduce you to our new Paizo-licensed RPG video game, <em>Pathfinder: The Dragon’s Demand</em>. Over a year in the making, it’s a single-player, turn-based game that features deep character customization, a faithful adaptation of the remastered Pathfinder Second Edition Core rules, and an enhanced tabletop minis-style play. It's all about miniatures in a tabletop-style world—the world of Pathfinder!</p>
                   <p>Playing tabletop many years ago made a huge impact on me. It was the most exciting time I’d ever had with a game, like a fantasy book coming alive from my own choices and dice rolls. It felt magical. It’s those memories that inspired me to work at BioWare as a producer on the <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> and <em>Neverwinter Nights</em> games. And that’s when I realized I was always trying to recreate that same pen-and-paper magic in the RPGs I worked on.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/09a523a2-e1a2-4cb8-9104-473a77e67dce/PF_TheDragonsDemand_ExplodingZombies.gif"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/09a523a2-e1a2-4cb8-9104-473a77e67dce/PF_TheDragonsDemand_ExplodingZombies.gif" width="600px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="gameplay footage of a zombie exploding"></a>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>So that’s what we’re doing with <em>The Dragon’s Demand</em>: going back to our tabletop roots to recreate that magic in a single-player, turn-based video game, with miniatures. It looks like a beautiful tabletop diorama but does all the things that aren’t possible to show on a physical tabletop, so it’s like an “enhanced tabletop.” And it uses a faithful adaptation of Pathfinder’s Second Edition rules for players to interact with the world in some very refreshing ways.</p>
                   <p>We’ve been building a prototype of this enhanced tabletop game for over a year. That includes nailing down the right art style on a solid technical framework, as well as integrating the remastered ruleset in an ongoing process.</p>

                   <p>So, what are some of the cool things you’ll see in <em>The Dragon’s Demand</em>? Well, when it comes to miniatures, we have adaptive poses based on actions, including grab poses, dynamic body postures for different inclines, but most importantly, a 3D grid system. Instead of grid squares, we’ll be using grid cubes, which give characters the incredible freedom of movement to climb ropes, walls, and trees, levitate, fly, swim deep underwater, and more.</p>
                   <p>And our environments will have dynamic weather that impacts the world, visual effects that obscure visibility, and a ton of skill-based environmental interactions like taking cover and sneaking, squeezing through really tight spots, throwing your own ropes to climb, and forcing open doors and windows with a crowbar.</p>

                   <p>The CRPG will be based on 2013’s Pathfinder adventure<em> The Dragon's Demand</em>, a Pathfinder First Edition dungeon and wilderness adventure for 1<sup>st</sup> level characters. Written by Mike Shel, it delves into the Dark Tapestry—the darkness between the stars where powerful entities and madness lurk. We’ll be expanding that adventure with new areas to explore, lots of intriguing side quests, and a brand new, personal story for player characters that delves into the darkness of the Dark Tapestry.</p>
                   <p>The return of a legendary dragon long vanquished sees the town of Belhaim once again under dire threat. The game will present a huge, interactive world to explore, with hundreds of characters and dozens of quests that react to the player’s choices. A cast of colorful companions, including iconic characters such as the goblin alchemist Fumbus, will be on hand to join the player’s party, each featuring their own motivations and backstory.</p>

                  </div>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">“Auntie, below you!” Nahoa’s spear crackled, lightning scouring its barbs free of blood and gristle as he pulled it from a spined skull. The boat rocked under his feet as the creature spasmed and slid below the waves.</p>
                   <p>Samo shifted her feet in response to Nahoa’s warning. The spirits of Valmdas Bay, each a tiny wrasse made of water, responded so quickly that it was almost like they’d predicted her signal, and in a spray of mist, they carried her across the seafoam. A second set of needle-sharp jaws erupted right where Samo had been, but they caught only water.</p>
                   <p>Nahoa sighed in relief. He’d seen the wise practitioner rend undead under blades of light and convince the very earth to spit its burning blood forth, but Nahoa had been taught to always take care of his elders. It was why he’d insisted they splurge on a boat across the bay instead of hiking the long way around—less to save time, more to make sure that the ferryman and his grandson would be safe in these monster-infested waters. Nahoa looked down to check on them, only to find the pair clearly in their element, the old man with a hand on the tiller and the boy bailing water from the boat.</p>
                   <p>As he turned back to the ocean, Nahoa found himself facing the sea serpent’s maw. <em>Oh.</em> His next thought was of how beautiful the clouds looked, his body turned skyward as he skipped across the water in the wake of the serpent’s blow before he crashed into a rocky outcropping. Nahoa’s head reeled a bit from the impact… no, not the impact. Nahoa looked at where the beast’s fangs had sunk into his shoulder, and even through his tattoos, he could see his veins begin to darken with venom.</p>
                   <p>Nahoa wasn’t worried. He’d been wounded before, by something much greater than this, and he’d left the encounter not just with his life, but something more. He reached deep into his soul, drawing forth his spark of divine power, and pushed it into his body, the scar on his chest beginning to glow with light. <em>That</em> had been a wound, one that would stay with him forever—this was barely a scratch by comparison. The scar blazed, and as light rippled outward from it across Nahoa’s skin, his wounds closed, without even a break in his tattoos where the fangs had been.</p>
                   <p>In the distance, the sea serpent reared its head back to strike at the boat. Samo danced in the air, her magic growing into roots and vines to pull the boy to safety. The old ferryman was left on the boat, though, and Samo wouldn’t be able to reach him in time.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f7a8d274-14b4-4faa-ada9-06b81b89a3f4/Nahoa_IconicEncounter_2000x1333.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f7a8d274-14b4-4faa-ada9-06b81b89a3f4/Nahoa_IconicEncounter_2000x1333.jpg" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Nahoa and Samo battle sea serpents.

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>The spark pulsed as its energy coursed over Nahoa before coming to illuminate the eyes in the stone owl mask at his waist. <em>Be brave</em> it said, pulling the young man forward. The waves between him and the serpent were too broad to cross, but he crossed them anyway. The serpent was too large for him to possibly grab, but he grabbed it anyway, his belt filling his body with divine strength as he wrestled the beast away from the ferryman. Was this how it felt, to be above mortal concerns? Like all you needed to do to cut an enemy down or to be where you wanted to be was simply to will it, to simply <em>make it happen</em> and have it be done? Nahoa flung the serpent back into the water as Samo’s vines pulled the ferryman to safety. Then, the moment of transcendence passed, and Nahoa was mortal once again.</p>
                   <p>The waters went still. Nahoa flipped his spear underhand and watched the waves. A spine cut the surface and Nahoa lashed out, but the serpent dove below before he could pierce it. A tail emerged on the other side of the boat, and once again Nahoa’s arm was too slow. Coils began to surround it from below the water, out of reach, and without the steady hand of the ferryman, the boat lurched dangerously.</p>
                   <p>Samo approached to lend aid, but Nahoa extended a hand as he dropped his spear. If he couldn’t find the creature, he’d just make sure he didn’t have to. He drew his power inwards, back from his relics, and there was silence. Like the tide drawing out far enough to leave the corals exposed, before the wave crashed down. Like the tradewinds driving up the mountain cliffs, before the rains fell. Like a voice grew quiet, before it let loose a great confession. Nahoa’s power grew and grew as it spiraled within him. He had seized that spark of gods high in the sky, and in this moment, the sky would bend to his command.</p>
                   <p>Nahoa laughed as he spun his arms, and his cry echoed like thunder as the sky opened. To the north, spring lightning seared the sky. To the east, summer monsoons churned the water’s surface. To the south, red leaves sliced in melancholy. And to the west, hail drove deep into the water. Then, Nahoa’s laugh and the storm’s howl faded, and a moment later, the serpent’s body floated to the surface, each section bearing different wounds.</p>
                   <p>Samo returned to the boat, the ferryman and his grandson in tow. As the sage returned, Nahoa had only one question for his traveling companion. He pointed to the water, where a few hailstones still floated on the surface.</p>
                   <p>“What are those?”</p>

                   <p>Meanwhile, across the Inner Sea,</p>
                   <p>Rahadoum, a land that abhors the gods, at first found Gorum’s death to be a cause for celebration. However, the Godsrain that followed brought only uncertainty, filling some members of a populace who hate divine power with that same power and causing suspicion toward these individuals to boil over. Amid all this turmoil, Kassi Aziril, a renowned medical researcher, found that several of her apprentices became empowered after the Godsrain and are now facing growing prejudice, persecution, and uncertainty. She’s turned to the Pathfinders to get her students out of Manaket and Rahadoum safely, but a radical element within the city guard has other ideas. If they Pathfinders succeed, though, they might just gain access to incredibly rare medical techniques that only Kassi’s students would otherwise be able to learn…</p>

                   <p>But it’s not just the content of this bundle that’s timely. Proceeds from the Pathfinder Second Edition Bundle of the Dead will support <a href="http://takethis.org/">Take This</a>, whose mission is to decrease the stigma of, and increase the support for, mental health in the game enthusiast community and inside the game industry. While they’d be a worthy cause to support at any time, Take This <a href="https://www.takethis.org/2024/08/take-this-is-in-danger-of-closing-forever/">announced at the end of August</a> that they were in dire need of help to keep from shutting down entirely. There’s literally no better time for you to support their cause, and this bundle provides just such an opportunity.</p>

                   <p>Take This has provided support, community, information, and tools to support mental wellness for people who make and play games <a href="https://www.takethis.org/10th-anniversary/">since 2012</a>. Through programs that serve the game community and the game industry, the organization strives to build an environment that fosters and celebrates mental wellbeing through games, communities, and workplaces built for thriving.</p>
                   <p>Take This’ three tentpole programs provide concrete support to people who make and play games while uplifting everyone who is part of this community.</p>
                   <p>The <a href="https://www.takethis.org/accelerate/">Take This Accelerate Program</a> is an initiative fueling the next generation of games and mental health experts. While supporting the professional development of creators, game developers, and researchers, Accelerate is building a critical mass of ethically trained, knowledgeable early-career professionals to advance the work of building a game industry focused on digital thriving, prosocial interaction, and safety by design.</p>
                   <p>The <a href="https://www.takethis.org/programs/afk-rooms/">Take This AFK Room</a> is a staffed, relaxed space at conventions and events designed for anyone who feels overwhelmed and needs a place to regain their calm. It is run by local volunteers and clinicians, trained by Take This, to moderate and maintain the atmosphere. The program offers education, resources, and a non-therapeutic listening ear to convention attendees, allowing them to find respite and fully enjoy their convention experience.</p>
                   <p>The <a href="https://www.takethis.org/2024/05/accepting-nominations-for-the-2024-mental-health-in-games-awards/">Take This Mental Health in Games Awards</a> honors digital and tabletop games which represent excellence in compassionate, non-stigmatizing portrayals of mental health, normalize mental health challenges, and uplift the mental wellbeing of the game community. These awards recognize excellence in compassionate, non-stigmatizing portrayals of mental health and mental health challenges in both video and tabletop games - games that go above and beyond in portraying the cornerstones of the Take This’ mission: mental health issues, healing, and hope.</p>
                   <p><strong>Why this bundle, right now?</strong></p>
                   <p>Right now, Take This is facing a serious financial reality: You may have noticed the organization’s <a href="https://www.takethis.org/2024/03/february-2024-newsletter/">plea for financial support earlier this year</a>. As hard as they’ve worked to make up that gap, the organization still needs significant help. Without everyone’s support, Take This and all of its impactful programs will cease to exist - <a href="https://www.takethis.org/2024/08/take-this-is-in-danger-of-closing-forever/">unless they raise $80,000 by the end of September</a>. Luckily, to help them make up the gap, <strong>Take This has received a commitment from an anonymous donor to match up to $50,000 of all donations made during this month</strong>—including from this bundle! So, you can double the impact of your gift just by purchasing the bundle. And if you can’t purchase the bundle, please consider supporting the awesome work of Take This <a href="https://www.takethis.org/support/donate/donation-form/">directly</a>.</p>

One side of this mat displays the interior of a futuristic space station, such as Absalom Station, the center of the Starfinder setting. The other side depicts the concrete streets of one of countless urban sprawls found throughout the galaxy. Both provide a blank canvas to draw any terrain or adventure set piece a Game Master might need. Combine this with the upcoming Starfinder Flip-Mat: Planetary Terrain Multi-Pack, and you’ll be set to run all the futuristic adventures you want!</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 5th- through 8th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>Rahadoum is a land that abhors the gods, and while the death of Gorum was cause for celebration there, the Godsrain that followed brought only uncertainty. Kassi Azaril, one of the most outspoken opponents of divine magic and renowned medical researcher, found several of her apprentices empowered after the Godsrain, and they now face growing prejudice from other citizens, stoked by a radical element within the city guards of Manaket.</p>
                   <p>Kassi does not want to abandon these students. She knows the Pathfinder Society would love to get their hands on some of her finest trainees, and so has called upon them to get her students out of Manaket and to safety. But some higher ups in the Manaket guard have decided to take matters into their own hands.</p>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">The local apparitions were increasingly inhospitable as Samo and Nahoa made their way to the feet of the mountains and into the sun-blasted wastes that the orcs of Belkzen claimed as their hold. Though her grandmother’s spirit was with her as always, the little spirits she knew best from the north—those of river and wave or those who hid in the shade of the taiga—had stayed behind in the places to which they were accustomed when Samo headed south.</p>
                   <p>She had reached out to the spirits of this unfamiliar place looking for aid and information only to be met by a recalcitrant and surly apparition who seemed to chase away any other local entities. He was Orc and he was Battle, though Samo doubted he was any particular orc or specific battle; rather, he seemed an amalgamation of the most prominent attributes of this hard place. Her grandmother’s presence had retreated to the back of her mind as she made this new spirit the primary focus of her meditations, seeking to establish a bond that would allow her to draw upon their knowledge of their environs. The spirit warred and wrestled with her as they communed, though she sensed no malice; it seemed instead that the spirit’s language was simply one of conflict. Perhaps, she quickly realized, fortunately so.</p>
                   <p>A pair of spine-covered, wild-eyed boars snorted their challenge from a nearby rocky protuberance, the hard-edged nails of their feet tearing troughs in the earth.</p>
                   <p>“Nahoa,” Samo cried, “watch out!”</p>
                   <p>The large man smiled a grim smile as he looked up at the bristle boars. Samo felt an echo of approval from the orcish battle spirit she had been entreating, the apparition’s former reticence slipping away as their knowledge of battle and Belkzen filled her mind, along with some other interesting information.</p>
                   <p>“Do you see there, up behind them, Nahoa?” Samo’s question was met with a nod from her mighty companion, though he did not take his eyes off the dangerous creatures.</p>
                   <p>“I do.” Nahoa’s hands gripped his spear tightly before he thrust down into the ground. “Piglets, it would seem. Food in the mountains must be scarce for them to have brought their whole family to hunt and scavenge this far in search of it. Maybe...”</p>
                   <p>Without finishing his thought, the former farmer reached into his pack, feeling around until his fingers closed on a leaf-wrapped package. Pulling it forth, he carefully unsealed it, revealing a cluster of smoked tubers he’d prepared a few days earlier. He threw the bundle carefully toward the boars, hoping the food might be enough to persuade them to stand down. His offering was perhaps too late or too aggressively delivered, however, for as the tubers sailed through the air, so too did the spine-covered bodies of the two boars.</p>
                   <p>Samo reached for her magic to fling spears of light and spirit at the boars only to find the battle apparition all too eager to respond with their own power instead. Magic of joyful aggression whirled through her, and before she realized it, she was springing into battle alongside Nahoa. The large warrior had left his carved spear behind, clearly hopeful that his great strength could subdue at least one of the beasts without orphaning their young and stranding them to a slow death by starvation.</p>
                   <p>As Nahoa and the larger of the two boars crashed to the ground in a tumble of red-stained dust, Samo’s war gavel spun in her hand with remarkable lightness, crashing into the other beast with a strength and impact beyond what her slight frame should have been capable of. She turned with the impact, letting the boar’s quills scratch along the wooden plates of her armor as she prepared another strike. The battle spirit’s magic guided her, and she howled out a word in Orcish—no doubt the spirit’s language coursing back through their bond—that caused her war gavel to strike with unnatural accuracy, amplified by a power that enabled the gavel to tear soul as much as flesh.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>The boar squealed in pain and danced away as Nahoa surged up from the ground, lifting his own boar over his head and hurling the creature back toward the outcropping from which it had first approached. Both boars, in quite unboarlike fashion, fled back to their young, one snatching up the bundle of tubers as it went. Samo unleashed a mighty Orcish war cry, proclaiming her victory, as the magic of the battle apparition finally left her.</p>
                   <p>As she turned sheepishly toward Nahoa to apologize for the display, she realized that her companion was more badly wounded than had been initially apparent. Even as the mighty young man cast her a weak grin of confidence, he collapsed to the ground, his body covered in brutal tears and punctured through with dozens of quills. Samo rushed to his side, pulling the quills from his flesh using the techniques taught to her long ago. As she did so, she concentrated on pushing the battle apparition aside to allow her grandmother’s nurturing spirit to flow through her once more. The war spirit gave ground grudgingly, and Samo laid aside her clan hat as sweat dripped down her brow, finally pushing the battle apparition to the back of her consciousness and allowing her grandmother to reassert herself in Samo’s soul. As she did so, healing magic from their bond flowed freely through Samo and into Nahoa’s wounded flesh.</p>
                   <p>When the last of Nahoa’s wounds sealed closed, the big man opened one eye to look at Samo.</p>
                   <p>“How about next time, I go first, and you hang back and protect me with your magic, eh? I’m getting tired of waking up to you covered in my blood.”</p>

                   <p>Hi, I’m Alison Cybe (they/them), and this year I’ve created <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-02: The Blackwood Lost</em>and <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-16: A Lie Told to Strangers</em>. If you didn’t like them, I’m sorry, I’m to blame. If you did, feel free to let me know. Both of these adventures deal with people in risk or dangers and cast the characters with their rescue. I didn’t want to brush too far beyond what is generally comfortable for people with these, as they’re my first step in creating Pathfinder adventures for folks, given that my history is much more in Starfinder. But at the same time, my writing style for adventures tends to emphasize a big range of diverse NPCs who I hope will remain memorable for players, interesting and unusual landscapes, and some dramatic punch here and there. I hope some of the work I’ve created has been able to entertain at least a few of you at some points. Anyway, you can find me on most social media sites under my name, so don’t be afraid to say hello.</p>

                   <p>Hello all, I'm Hmm. <em>Heidmarch Heist</em> originated when Josh Foster came up with the idea of a theft at Heidmarch Manor. Designing the mystery for this adventure was just plain fun. I spent time considering how to cater to both the hard-core mystery buffs and the potentially clueless, so the mystery includes ample handouts and a chance to explore. I had so much fun writing this overall, that I could not pick out a favorite bit. I'll leave that as an exercise for readers of this blog (under spoilers, of course!).</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone, I’m Jacob W. Michaels (he/him), the author of PFS Year 5’s <em>Protecting the Firelight</em>, which was my first repeatable scenario. I had so much fun trying to create as many variations as I could, and I literally can’t figure out how many times you could play this without repeating the scenario exactly (seriously, I remember learning the mathematical formulas back in high school, but that knowledge has been pushed out of my brain by Pathfinder encounter math). I was thrilled developer Shay Snow, who’s of Indigenous heritage, entrusted me with this piece, which had a number of Native themes. I really enjoyed diving into the research—the foods that may get prepared during one part of the adventure are all based on real Native dishes, as are other aspects of the traditional ritual—and working with Shay to come up with a villain that evoked a legend from their culture. I also paid homage to a friend and fellow Pathfinder player who died unexpectedly days before I began working on the adventure. And finally, a pre-teen NPC evokes my niece and nephew and all the wonderfully assertive children of the world! Thanks as always to Paizo for letting me play in their world, and to everyone who enjoys the adventures we create.</p>

                   <p>Hey all, I'm Isis Wozniakowska (she/her), and I wrote <em>Cleansing the Flame</em>. Personally, I'm super proud of it and have a great time running for cons whenever I get the chance, as I've always had a particular enjoyment of orc cultures and how they've been written in second edition. And I'm especially excited to see a new era of orc gods going forward from here into Godsrain. One thing I really wanted to show in this adventure is how orcs can have a culture built up around the importance of strength and combat and how displaying that to others is such a major part of it, but to do so in such a way that isn't inherently tied to a toxic culture of survival of the fittest like was previously shown in orcs before. And as someone who struggles treating an occasionally debilitating autoimmune disease these days, several parts of the adventure (many of which I won't spoil for those of you who haven't played it) are things I was particularly excited to learn I would be able to portray for everyone. Organized Play also just means a lot to me in general, and I spend a lot of time running my own local event and popping into various cons online and locally. I hope you all enjoy it, and I hope you'll see me around at various online cons occasionally running it for people.</p>
                   <p>I'm not on social media as much as I used to be since I went back to grad school, but you can find me on BlueSky as @wozenstein, but mostly I lurk on there and Insta. I don't have any upcoming personal projects, but I can always use the support in trying to get through my Comparative Literature MA. I study Italian literature, primarily medieval and Renaissance, and currently am looking at the relationship between medieval literature and modern fantasy literature (including looking at TTRPGs as a form of literary study).</p>

                   <p>The pitch to me for <em>The </em><em>Winter Queen’s Dollhouse</em> was “poppets trapped in a dollhouse that get awakened.” From there, I thought the most fun would be a bunch of displaced workers banding together to overcome their boss, with the players helping them to organize. I’m sure there were headlines somewhere that inspired this idea. Lol. #solidarity.</p>
                   <p>While everything I create is something I cherish, Sweeper, a stuffed sloth poppet and the main NPC, will always be my darling. I wanted her to be cute enough to appeal to kids of all ages, but self-assured enough to be the perfect leader for the mini-rebellion. Watching people's reactions to her, it seems I’ve done just that. Big shout-out to Bruno Cesar (@bcesart on Instagram) for doing an amazing job bringing her to life with his art.</p>

                   <p>Hello everyone, my name is Lucas Servideo. I was honored to be asked to write<em> The Dacilane Academy's Show Must Go On</em>, not only because this would be my first time writing for Paizo, but because it was an “All Ages” Quest that would be used in the Academy at Gen Con, a program that lets families play Pathfinder and Starfinder together.</p>
                   <p>My favorite part of this experience was to add a piece of myself to Absalom by making the history behind the Muse of the Rose theater and also building on the Dacilane Academy saga of scenarios by adding in NPCs of my own and those of others into the story. I hope everyone has a chance to enjoy this quest.</p>
                   <p>To see what I am up to, you can check my Instagram @lucasringmaster, or my BlueSky @smartgoblin.bsky.social. On either, you will usually see my current miniature project, drawings, photos, or thoughts that pop up.</p>

Because they’ve consistently topped the list, and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers lists.

                   <p>Thank you for helping us find some of these problems. We’d like to thank everyone for their involvement in the playtest so far. We know there are other areas that could use some attention, but we want to ensure that the data we receive from the feedback remains consistent at this stage. We’ll be issuing some later errata in the future to address some directions we’re leaning and some other concerns (like a certain Hair Trigger issue). Please continue filling out surveys as that is the best way to ensure we hear you, and remember you can continue submitting and revising submitted surveys for the Starfinder Playtest until December 31st!</p>

Specifically, I’m going to talk to you about some of the new character content we’ve got coming your way.</p>
                   <p>Class archetypes have been something that have existed, at least in theory, since the beginning of Pathfinder Second Edition. These are a type of archetype that is taken at 1st level, requires you to take a specific 2nd-level feat, and often trades out some specific portion of your class features (whether adding or removing a class feature entirely, requiring you to take a specific version of a class feature, or some similar adjustment). <em>War of Immortals</em> introduces a new set of class archetypes to the game, so let’s dive into talking about those!</p>
                   <br>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6b5801be-f0e7-4157-9db1-560a5094da62/PZO12006-HC_Avenger_ClassArchetype_1500x2100.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6b5801be-f0e7-4157-9db1-560a5094da62/PZO12006-HC_Avenger_ClassArchetype_1500x2100.png" width="450px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Art by Kendal Gates.

                   <br>
                   <h3>Avenger</h3>
                   <p>The first of the new class archetypes I’m going to talk about is the <b>avenger</b>. This class archetype for the rogue was inspired by the iconic of a Pathfinder First Edition class, the slayer. This iconic, Zadim, was a potent dual-wielding combatant who worked for a splinter branch of Sarenrae’s faith. For <em>War of Immortals</em>, we wanted Zadim and the avenger class archetype to be very representative of the type of rogue character who would get involved in godly affairs.</p>
                   <p>This rogue class archetype requires you to choose a deity, adjusts your starting skills, gives you a special avenger racket, and replaces the rogue’s surprise attack class feature with the Hunt Prey action. It also makes some adjustments to your sneak attack, allowing you to sneak attack with your deity’s favored weapon. Avengers excel at combatting enemy priests while wielding the favored weapons of their chosen deities, making them deadly and feared warriors during a time when gods and their servitors are at war!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">The bloodrager Trzikhun. Art by Kendal Gates.</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Bloodrager</h3>
                   <p>In Pathfinder First Edition, the <b>bloodrager</b> was a class that mashed together the sorcerer and the barbarian to create a bloodline-oriented warrior with rage and limited spellcasting. We wanted to reimagine this class for Pathfinder Second Edition into something that better embodied the name and that tied more tightly into our game world, which is what we’ve done with this barbarian class archetype. With that reimagining, we brought a new character in to represent the concept: Trzikhun, Reaper of Ukuja, a Matanji orc who is part of a tradition of orcish demon-slayers who drink the blood of shadow demons to gain magical power.</p>
                   <p>Bloodragers have some modified skills and must choose the bloodrager instinct, which gives them blood rage. Blood rage allows the bloodrager to inflict persistent bleed damage while raging and applies their additional damage from rage to their spells. Their dedication feat at 2nd level gives them spellcasting and adds the rage trait to the spells they gain from this archetype while they are raging, as well as giving them the Harvest Blood action, which allows them to refresh their temporary Hit Points and boost their saving throws against the magical attacks of enemies who they have used Harvest Blood against. This ability plays into later feats like Spelldrinker, which allows them to temporarily add spells to their repertoire when using Harvest Blood based on the type of target creature, such as granting them the <em>wall of thorns</em> spell when they use Harvest Blood against a fey enemy!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">The vindicator Imrijka. Art by Kendal Gates.</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Vindicator</h3>
                   <p>The final class archetype we’re going to talk about today is the <b>vindicator</b> class archetype, which alters the ranger class. This class archetype requires the ranger to choose a deity, is automatically trained in Religion instead of Nature, and is trained in their deity’s favored weapon, gaining deadly simplicity if that weapon’s damage dice is smaller than d6 and treating the weapon as martial for the purposes of proficiency if the weapon is advanced. They also gain a special hunter’s edge called the vindication edge and learn their warden spells as divine spells, as well as gaining the ability to select domain spells as appropriate to their deity. They gain their deity’s sanctification and have some other adjustments to class features like trackless journey and masterful hunter to make them better fit with the other changes.</p>
                   <p>This class archetype is represented by Imrijka, who was the iconic inquisitor in Pathfinder First Edition. As part of her update to Pathfinder Second Edition, Imrijka’s outfit is now done in Pharasma’s holy colors, and she is known as a vindicator; only vindicators of evil deities are called inquisitors.* This class archetype allows characters like Imrijka to combine the ranger’s strong skill and combat chassis with the potent focus spell casting supported by the vindication edge, making vindicators well-rounded characters who excel at hunting down monsters who lurk among the faithful of their chosen religion. With powerful focus spells like <em>vindicator’s mark</em> and <em>vindicator’s judgment</em>, the vindicator can mark their prey, hunting them down and dealing devastating damage. With feats like Call the Hunt, vindicators make their hunted prey off-guard if they and at least one of their allies are both adjacent to the target, and the vindicator can share their divine sanctification with their allies!</p>

                   <p>With these three class archetypes (which are not the only new class archetypes in the book!), we’ve brought a couple old friends forward from Pathfinder First Edition and enabled some new character concepts that weren’t quite able to be fully realized to our satisfaction in Pathfinder Second Edition. We’ve also added powerful new warriors to our players’ arsenals that each have their own particular motivations to participate in the War of Immortals. We’re looking forward to seeing you unleash them when the book drops this October!</p>

                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2>
                   <p>Last week, we released the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq03w9z"><em>Lost Omens: Tian Xia Character Guide</em></a>! This is an incredible book, packed to the brim with exciting new character options. It’s also <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">sanctioned for Pathfinder Society play</a>! You can find boons for the uncommon and rare ancestries in the Boon Store, as well as some other uncommon or rare archetypes. Note that a lot of the uncommon content in this book is accessed simply by creating a character from Tian Xia; you won’t find boons for these options, as you have other ways to access it!</p>
                   <p>Speaking of which, when we were working on the two Tian Xia books, we noticed an issue with the World Traveler boon. This boon allows you to select a second region to treat as a home region for character options…but it didn’t actually include Tian Xia. Whoops! We’ve updated this boon as a result to future-proof it. The new text is below, and it remains available in the Boon Store for just 20 Achievement Points.</p>
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>&gt; <strong>World Traveler</strong> (Slotless): You have traveled widely, spending a considerable amount of time in a distant region and absorbing the local customs. When you assign this boon to a character, select a country or city on Golarion. You qualify as being from that city or country, as well as any regions which contain it, for the purpose of fulfilling the Access prerequisite of uncommon character options, in addition to any other access benefits you have from other sources. For example, a character who selected Alkenstar fulfills access requirements for Alkenstar as well as the Mana Wastes and the Impossible Lands, and a character who selects Hwanggot fulfills requirements for Hwanggot and Tian Xia.</p>
                   </blockquote>
                   <p>We’re a little behind on adventure sanctioning right now, but we’re working hard on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq03w9w?Pathfinder-Adventure-Prey-for-Death"><em>Prey for Death</em></a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/curtaincall">Curtain Call </a><a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/curtaincall">Adventure Path</a>. In just a few short weeks, at the end of October, we’ll see our next major rulebook release in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02oar"><em>War of Immortals</em></a>, and we hope you’re all excited!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>New Pathfinder Society Year</h2>
                   <p>The Year of Immortal Influence is officially upon us, and with it comes some new updates! First of all, the <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=pfs2guide._.Introduction">Guide to Organized Play</a> has been officially updated to version 6.00. This version of the guide does not contain major rules changes, but there has been a major reorganization to make it more usable and bring it in line with the Guide for Starfinder Society. If you wish to leave feedback, you can do so in <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs4voaf?Official-PFS2-Guide-to-Organized-Play">this forum thread</a>, which also has a summary of the changes.</p>
                   <p>Additionally, we have released <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02evu">new pregenerated characters</a>! This update adds pregens for the eight Player Core 2 classes (alchemist, barbarian, champion, investigator, monk, oracle, sorcerer and swashbuckler), as well as the kineticist from Rage of Elements. The previous pregens have not been updated or altered as part of this update.</p>
                   <p>As all legacy pregenerated characters have been updated, Pathfinder Society players must use the Remastered versions going forward. Please leave any errors or comments on the product page!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>
                   <p>While attending PaizoCon Europe last month, I awarded three Campaign Coins to outstanding volunteers! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; so if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay@paizo.com with their name and reasons.</p>
                   <p>Congratulations to:</p>
                   <p><strong>Frank Richard</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #916</p>
                   <p><strong>Damien Monnier</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #917</p>
                   <p><strong>"Mr. Fred" Frederic Meulenijzer</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #918</p>
                   <p>Unfortunately, due to my busy travel schedule, I did not have time this month to catch up on GMs who have earned their 5th rank. My sincerest apologies to those GMs who are waiting patiently; I promise you will all be celebrated in next month’s blog.</p>
                   <h2>Conventions</h2>
                   <p>Convention season may be on the tail end, but we’ve still got some fantastic events coming up in September and October! You can (and should!) check out our <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">conventions calendar</a> to see events with a Paizo Organized Play presence near you.</p>
                   <p>Earlier today, we began soliciting volunteers for PAX Unplugged! Last year’s show was an incredible success and we’re looking to make the show bigger and better this year. We’re looking for talented GMs to run Pathfinder Society quests and scenarios, as well as Starfinder Playtest scenarios. If you’d like to join us this December in Philadelphia, you can find all the information in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6wi29?Call-to-Volunteer-PAX-Unplugged-2024"><b>yesterday's blog</b></a>!</p>
                   <p>Alright, that’s enough from me. Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy some chocolate. You deserve it.</p>

                   <ul>
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the PAX Unplugged Organizing Committee. Filling this form out does not guarantee acceptance; you will receive an email with further information from the PAXU committee.</li>
                    <li>PAX Unplugged schedules will be assigned by the committee. You will be asked for your preference of system and level, but you will not necessarily be able to choose the specific scenario(s) you run. The committee’s intention is to assign people to run the same scenario multiple times during the weekend. There is a free-form field at the end of the form to enter specific requests, though there’s no guarantee they will be honored.</li>
                    <li>Reward information is listed in the table below. GMs who do not qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one.</li>
                    <li>Applications will be processed on a rolling basis, beginning no later than September 16. The earlier you get your application in, the more likely it is you’ll get the scenarios you want.

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">“Nahoa, can you help me dig another ditch before planting season?”</p>
                   <p>“Nahoa, the pigs have gotten out again—can you help me round them up?”</p>
                   <p>The Olehala people, third of the four great nations of the Okaiyo Ocean, had many heroes. Kolea the Wanderer, or Uncle Midnight, or the Tideweaver. But Nahoa’s village, on a small island in the easternmost reaches of Olehala’s archipelago, had none. It didn’t need any; the village had plentiful rain and bountiful harvests, the seas were calm and the currents easy. But for whatever small problems might crop up—a ripped sail here, a sick child in need of watching there—Nahoa was always first to pitch in. The young man was no hero, but he worked hard on his family’s taro farm, sharing whatever was left over with his neighbors, and he played harder, stone-bowling with friends or lava-sledding down the slopes.</p>
                   <p>The years were joyful. Planting and harvesting, watching his little sisters grow up. The New Year’s games and feasts. Lazy summers swimming in the falls with that navigator from the nearby Taotake islands, before she led her merchant canoes east to distant Arcadia. For many years, all was well.</p>
                   <p>Until Pāmalō returned. The Olehala’s chants told of the demon, a massive creature of shadow and smoke, its wings silent as an owl and its belly insatiable as a shark’s. Once a generation, it would appear in the skies above their island, roost on the highest mountain for one day and night, and then feed. As the creature alit and the skies darkened, the people did what they had always done and hid: some in caves, some in the forests, and some in the distant reefs. With luck, Pāmalō would take mostly livestock, and leave.</p>
                   <p>Nahoa couldn’t understand. How could they let this happen, generation after generation? The last time Pāmalō had come, Nahoa had been too little to remember much, but the fear of black wings against the sun had been seared in his mind, the same as everyone of the nameless, easternmost island. Someone had to do something. His heart was telling Nahoa to do something.</p>
                   <p>No… it was Calling.</p>
                   <p>The Call had rung out for decades, and whether the others could not hear it or could not answer, Nahoa did not know. Without words, it implored someone to help. Nahoa was no hero… but he always helped those in need, and so he did what he always did when asked to help.</p>
                   <p>That night, Nahoa bathed in the waterfall and tidied the garden. He prepared some of his sisters’ favorite food, leaving it near the cooking pit for them to find in the morning, and he picked flowers to circle the stone that remembered their mother and father. Lastly, he went to the path that led up the mountain, digging stick in hand. Nahoa sat on a stump, the farming tool over his knee. <em>So my sisters can grow up without fear</em>. He cut a notch into his digging stick. <em>So Uncle doesn’t go hungry this winter</em>. Another notch. <em>So that nice Taotake girl doesn’t encounter it on the seas</em>. With each reason to face the creature, he cut. When he’d finished counting all his reasons, his digging stick was a barbed spear. With it, he climbed the mountain to Pāmalō’s roost, and he cried out a challenge as dawn broke.</p>
                   <p>Pāmalō paid no regard. Of course it didn’t. It was ancient, the subject of songs and dances every young Olehalan learned from their grandparents, its face carved into warding stones generations ago. Nahoa was no hero. The creature snatched Nahoa in its talons, and the two left the earth behind.</p>
                   <p>High in the sky, Nahoa fought Pāmalō. He may as well have been an ant attempting to fight the tide, for all the difference it seemed to make. Nahoa thrust his spear forward and it skittered along the demon owl's slick, black feathers, to fall to the raging waves below; he seized its wing to force it to earth but found it unyielding as a koa tree. He gave a great shout and it looked back at him, at this insignificant thing that dared to fight back, and it cocked its head. Nahoa didn’t even have time to let out a gasp as his chest tore under its beak.</p>
                   <p>As pain filled him, Nahoa despaired—was this all he really could do? He hadn’t expected to defeat Pāmalō, or even survive, but he had hoped he might at least wound the creature, to buy a few years’ peace for his island. To show his people that this ancient horror could bleed, that it could be opposed, that it didn’t have to be accepted as the price for the turning of the years. But it was for naught. Demonic shadows flooded into Nahoa’s chest like a venom, and as Nahoa looked up at the sky above him, red filled his vision.</p>

                   <p>No, it didn’t. The sky above him was indeed red as blood, but it was not Nahoa’s. In the distance, Nahoa saw an impossible vision of two figures—a beast and a warrior as well—standing miles tall, bodies stretching from below the horizon to above the sky. <em>The gods</em>, Nahoa thought in shock, moments before one bisected the other, cutting immortality short. The heavens wept as the divine blood of the warrior god rained through the sky in a shower of sparks.</p>
                   <p>The sparks screamed past Nahoa and Pāmalō in streaks of red and silver. One landed on Pāmalō’s wing, and in a rush of speed, the sea below was replaced by the red desert of the distant mainland. Another landed, and the desert was replaced by ocean anew, though a strange one, studded through with the remnants of shattered land and ruined towers.</p>
                   <p>A spark screamed through the air, shining with light, and its speed matched Pāmalō and Nahoa’s as they flew. The demon tore into Nahoa once more, and Nahoa clung desperately to consciousness as bone crunched. He looked to the spark. He had been Called to protect his island, to face this beast, to <em>do something, anything</em>, but intention was nothing without the power to see it through. Power that hung in the air now, right before him. Nahoa reached for the spark with his right hand, but Pāmalō held him in place. He reached again, and his flesh tore to beak and talon. With a cry of pain, Nahoa reached a third time, and he seized divinity.</p>
                   <p>The spark flooded deep into Nahoa’s soul. He felt death flee from his bones as divine power chased the shadows from his veins, burning them into his skin as tattoos. His power, now, as well. Nahoa wrestled Pāmalō’s talons open, finding them brittle in his grasp, and he reached out for a weapon, finding the spear dropped half a world ago in his grip once more. As he yelled a challenge anew to the creature that had terrorized his people, he felt the tiny spark of divine power within him blaze, an ember fanned into a bonfire by this single moment of glory. Nahoa thrust the spear deep into Pāmalō’s breast, and the might of gods coursed down his arm and through the weapon to detonate in a peal of light and thunder. As the demon’s torn body fell to earth, Nahoa fell with it, careening toward a strange, icy shore.</p>
                   <p>Nahoa was no hero, not yet. But as consciousness slipped from his grasp, the Calling rang out around him, clearer than ever, and he knew it was what he was destined to be.</p>

They're not the only important Absalom-based faction there however, as the event is filled with lords and ladies and socialites of all kinds, including the Peacebuilders, a group dedicated to ensuring the Pathfinder Society pays for any of its mistakes. In the middle of dinner, evidence of a strange ritual is found, and the Pathfinders must investigate before dinner becomes a murder mystery!</p>

                   <p>The River Between is a rushing waterway contained within a cylindrical containment field that winds through the Diaspora, connecting hundreds of asteroids and sarcesian crèche worlds in an endless loop. For years, the River Between’s current has slowed, and its waters have darkened, becoming fallow and murky. Now, the River Between is drying up, and all signs indicate it’s an act of sabotage perpetrated by notorious space pirate Alera Okwana, captain of the Riveters. Grab your laser pistol, plot a course for the Diaspora, and raid a pirate stronghold in your quest to save the River Between!</p>

It’s therefore no surprise when the academy calls upon the Pathfinders to help make sure nothing terrible happens during the play that the students will be performing at a nearby theater, the Muse of the Rose. Recently, performances there have seen unfortunate accidents. No one has been seriously injured, but the performances were all ultimately ruined. It's up to the PCs to ensure that the Dacilane Academy's performance doesn't suffer the same fate, even if they have to prevent disasters backstage during the show itself.</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Special designed for 1st- through 8th-level characters (subtiers 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &amp; 7-8).</p>
                   <p>The Pathfinder Society is approached by the Queen of Kyonin for their assistance in investigating a demon-obsessed elf noble and his ominous plans for an isolated town within the forests of Kyonin, in exchange for allowing the Society to once again operate within the nation. The travel there is treacherous, and once the Pathfinders arrive, the town is besieged by a power beyond any one elf no matter his plans and ambition. The teams of Pathfinders must work together effectively and quickly to prevent the corruption of the forest and the town!</p>

                   <p>When we started the Tian Xia project back in 2022, we knew we couldn’t do it alone—only by pooling the passion, knowledge, and shared experiences of our stellar cast of writers and designers could we bring the (now gold ENNIE award winning!) <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> to vibrant life or dream up the spooks and frights of the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path. <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6to7l?Meet-the-Tian-Xia-Authors">You might have heard from some of our authors back in April</a> with the release of the <em>World Guide</em>, but we wanted to give everyone a chance to talk about their inspirations in the <em>Character Guide</em> as well. Hear from some of them below!</p>
                   <p>From all of us, thank you for supporting Tian Xia! This vast continent is yours to explore, and we can’t wait to hear what sort of stories you tell!</p>

                   <p>안녕하세요! It's Eren again. I'm absolutely thrilled to have written the new dokkaebi goblin heritage! It's been a complete joy to turn the goblin creatures of my childhood into something I hope you will delight in. If you ever come across a pot randomly at the side of the road, make sure to leave a little treat for the dokkaebi napping inside!</p>
                   <p>As always, you can find me chatting about my writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erenahn.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> and everything else on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/chromathesia">Twitter</a>. Hope to see y'all around!</p>

                   <h3>Jeremy Blum (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>I worked on both the Tian Xia World and Character Guides, and it was a joy to contribute to both. For the <em>World Guide</em>, I took Amanandar into a new era and turned it into Linvarre, and I also wrote bios for the Avistani gods worshipped in Tian Xia, as well as new info on our favorite estranged tengu lovers, Hei Feng and Lady Jingxi. For the <em>Character Guide</em>, I wrote Tian innovation feats for the inventor class. Can you spot all the references I stuffed in there? There's Double Dragon, Dragonball, G Gundam, Street Fighter, the '70s Japanese Spider-Man TV show (EMISSARY FROM HELL!), Megaman, and Voltron!</p>
                   <p>When I'm not working on Paizo books, I'm a co-designer on <a href="https://www.threesailsstudios.com/mappamundirpg"><em>Mappa Mundi: An Exploration + Ecology RPG</em></a> for Three Sails Studios. It's a TTRPG about exploring the wild and observing the behaviors of monsters like a naturalist, and it takes place in a fantastical world vaguely inspired by Eurasia. If you like Tian Xia, please check us out, since I've just finished writing up the lore for our Chinese-inspired region of Zoumung!

                   <p>I am so ecstatic to have worked on the Samsaran ancestry with Kienna Shaw! We both wanted to create a world that thrived on cooperation, even in the frigid lands of their homeland Zi Ha. It's a brilliant ancestry that incorporates some fundamental aspects of Buddhism—samsara, reincarnation, impermanence, karma, and enlightenment—and while adapted to a fantasy setting, we tried to ensure that we drew authentically from this way of life. Their power comes from the beginningless cycle of rebirth and attainment of knowledge as a result. It is truly humbling to have been able to incorporate a way of life and teachings that has so greatly influenced my own.</p>

                   <p>Haitai! Wannee Hiromi yaibiin! I’m Hiromi, and my main contribution to the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> was the tsukumogami poppet heritage. For those unfamiliar, tsukumogami are tools and other household objects that have gained a spirit through use and/or age. They’re one of my favorite creatures in Japanese folklore. As a playable heritage, tsukumogami have characteristics that reflect their original utility, as well as feats to customize their abilities. As living objects, they're cute and a little spooky.</p>
                   <p>My favorite part of the section is a feat called Minuscule Mentee, which allows your tsukumogami character to have their own poppet familiar, which they will presumably mentor and look after. It’s a lovely way to expand the tsukumogami community and gain a little buddy to help your character in their travels. I look forward to seeing players try this out and potentially create all-tsukumogami parties!</p>
                   <p>I had loads of fun working on Tian Xia, and I still have more fun Pathfinder things coming! Once I can talk about them, you’ll see details on my Bluesky account <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiromicota.bsky.social">@hiromicota</a> or my <a href="https://hiromicota.com/">website</a>.</p>

The <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> was my second Paizo contribution and certainly the one I'm most excited about. I had a blast bringing my love of Asian weaponry into the <em>Character Guide</em>. It is such an honor to be part of such a diverse team of Asian creatives who have worked so hard to bring life to Tian Xia! Fun fact, some of my fellow freelancers and I started a home game to test out many of our contributions during the development period!</p>

                   <p>I'm a freelance writer, artist, GM, producer, editor, and TTRPG performer who just can't say no. I had the absolute pleasure of writing the backgrounds in the <em>Character Guide</em> and the nue in the <em>World Guide</em>. Tian Xia holds such a special place in my heart and I'm so glad to finally share that. A fun little fact, two of the backgrounds are based on my late grandmothers!</p>

                   <p>Hi! I'm Collette Quach and I'm a Chinese-Cambodian designer and writer. The <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> is my first Paizo publication but you might have seen my writing in <a href=" https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6syqx?Tian-Xia-Days-Study-Hall">Tian Xia Days: Study Hall</a> where I explored the Indraracha Institute of Tang Mai. I wrote and designed the hungerseed ancestry and the text about the jorogumo. I had a blast researching the mythology of our world and incorporating it into Tian Xia. I wanted to showcase the things that make us love them but also add a level of complexity that makes interacting with them much more engaging at your tables. I hope you all enjoy my little spider friends and shooting beams of energy out of your third eye!</p>

                   <h3>Shahreena Shahrani (she/her)</h3>
                   <p>Marhaba, hello, everyone! I’m Shahreena, a Malaysian-American gamer, freelance writer, cultural consultant, and educator. I have previously worked on a number of Pathfinder (and Starfinder) books such as <em>Rage of Elements</em>, <em>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em>, and <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em>. For the <em>Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</em>, I had fun contributing lore inspired by the folktales I had grown up with.</p>
                   <p>In my non-gaming related life, I am an educator actively promoting diverse voices and experiences. I deliver lectures/presentations on regional and cultural studies of the Middle East and North Africa. I also bring together artists, writers, scholars, and experts to present on topics relating to Kurdish Studies in an online Speaker Series (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZahraInstitute">https://www.youtube.com/@ZahraInstitute</a>).</p>
                   <p>If you’re looking for a Middle East and North Africa specialist for your next project, you can reach me via email (shahreena_s [at] yahoo [dot] com). You can also find my retelling of world folk tales on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@storytimewithauntienina5783">https://www.youtube.com/@storytimewithauntienina5783</a>).</p>

                   <h3>Kienna Shaw (she/they)</h3>
                   <p>Hi there! I’m Kienna, and I had the pleasure of reimagining the samsaran ancestry alongside Alyx Bui. As a worldbuilding nerd, it was an exciting creative challenge to expand the lore of this beloved ancestry, ground it within the new version of Tian Xia, and bring it up to date with the play philosophy of Pathfinder Second Edition. I wanted to delve into what “enlightenment” means for the samsarans, making it a concrete goal that can be achieved through many different paths. Whether your samsaran aims to fully understand the world through studying a niche subject, mastering a skill, or exploring the wondrous dangers of the continent, I hope you’ll find the ancestry’s story and roleplay opportunities as rich and rewarding as I did.</p>
                   <p>Writing the samsarans for the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> along with the gods Yaezhing and Jin Li in the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> was a fantastic experience from start to finish. You can find me and my other TTRPG work on Twitter as <a href="https://x.com/KiennaS">@KiennaS</a>, Bluesky as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kiennas.bsky.social">kiennas.bsky.social</a>, or on my website <a href="https://kiennas.com/">https://kiennas.com/</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Tan Shao Han</h3>
                   <p>I'm happy the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> will reach you soon! Working on Tian Xia for Pathfinder Second Edition has been the highlight of my freelance career so far!</p>
                   <p>My <em>Character Guide</em> contributions include designing the yaksha ancestry, lore and consulting for the wayang ancestry, and hybrid studies and an archetype inspired by wuxia and xianxia.</p>
                   <p>As a SEAsian Buddhist, yaksha stories have interested me since youth, alongside tales of nagas (whose lore I also got to consult for in <em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em>). These yakshas I've created are inspired by different stories, filtered through my own perspective as a devotee. While you won't find the yakshas in Tian Xia as analogous of any one yaksha tradition, my hope is that our work will be true to the ethos and themes of these spirits.</p>
                   <p>I am also happy to create new lore for the wayangs. I tried to recenter SEAsian perspectives by integrating integrated elements of Javanese mysticism (kejawèn) as well as themes of SEA's history of anti-colonial struggle. One day, we shall all be free! Well, in closing, it is my hope to inspire you to find out more about SEA's history and culture through our games. Thank you!</p>

                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders!<br>
                     Now that we’ve all returned from Gen Con (and showered and slept and recovered and received our complimentary Paizo-branded post-convention drinks) it’s time to draw everyone’s attention toward what’s releasing this month!</p>
                   <p>The Year of Immortal Influence kicks off this month with a grand fundraiser dinner, hosted by Lady Hesla Embersplitter in order to benefit the Knights of Lastwall! She’s eager to see their crusade against Tar-Baphon get underway and wants to do everything she can to help, including inviting the elite of Absalom’s nobility all into the same room at once! Surely nothing can go wrong! The Pathfinders receive an invitation and, while rubbing elbows with some of the most influential people in Absalom, they learn that something isn’t quite right at the dinner…</p>

                   <p>Meanwhile, the Three Gates Lodge over in Kayajima needs some routine maintenance of its leyline wards. It’s a perfectly safe task, and you really shouldn’t worry about it. I mean, what do you expect, a god to die just as you are about to get the details of your routine task? His ichor and essence raining across all Golarion–including Kayajima? Causing immeasurable chaos and leaving you and your companions as the only ones who can deal with the aftermath, tasked with a friendly dragon of seeking out a dangerous power that has come to rest at the mountain’s peak?</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">In July, we terminated Paizo’s longstanding Community Use Policy and replaced it with a new Fan Content Policy. This was an error, and we’re taking steps to rectify that today.</p>
                   <p>We are reinstating the <a href="https://paizo.com/licenses/communityuse">Community Use Policy as it has existed for over 15 years</a>, with a few minor updates and clarifications intended to make using the policy even easier. We have removed both the Approved Products List and Community Use Registry and clarified some elements that were previously in FAQs or simply not addressed (like being able to use our art and logos in black and white products). We have not changed the permissions granted by the policy. The specific language in the Community Use Policy declaration you need to include in your project has changed to reflect a new URL for the policy on <strong>paizo.com</strong>, and we have added the provision that you provide contact information somewhere on your product in lieu of the now-removed registry. This change will allow existing Community Use Policy projects to continue to operate as they have for over a decade.</p>
                   <p>We still fully intend to provide additional permissions for community creators to monetize their creations under limited circumstances. For the time being, <a href="https://paizo.com/licenses/fancontent">the Fan Content Policy</a> allows this, and we’re making no changes to that policy today—it exists alongside the Community Use Policy. With the Community Use Policy restored, we can refine the Fan Content Policy to more clearly define what commercial uses are allowed under what conditions and using which elements of our intellectual property. We will make our intended revisions and updates to the Fan Content Policy and let the community know when the new version is available.</p>
                   <p>Paizo’s community is the foundation of our success, and we deeply appreciate all of the hard work and passion you bring to our spaces. We apologize for this misstep and look forward to a long, bright future for community projects inspired by our work. Thank you for all of your outreach, feedback, and difficult conversations throughout this process. And above all, thank you for being a part of our community.</p>

Over a dozen schools are attending, with each getting to show off its stories and teachings, but six sponsors are taking the main stage, so we thought we’d introduce them to you here!</p>
                   <p>These academies get to show off more of what they’re best at—not to mention, teach their secrets to player characters—whether that’s archetypes, gadgets, spells, wizard schools, or something else entirely. The six sponsors come from vastly different backgrounds, momentarily united in the dual goals of supporting a new academy at the edge of the devastated Sarkoris Scar and spreading some of their knowledge so that it cannot all be lost in a single disaster.</p>
                   <p>As with most academic gatherings, rivalry underscores the Convocation’s shared missions. In addition to sparking exhibits and clashes of wits, theories are tested daily on the demons that still linger in the lands of Sarkoris. With honest competition and underhanded dealings alike raising tensions, it’s important to know what side you’re on.</p>

Normally found wandering through the fey realms of the First World, Cobyslarni’s teachings focus on the magical power of oaths and agreements. With their headmaster temporarily residing on the Convocation grounds, many of their students are having their first taste of the mortal world.

                   <p>In addition to the six schools sponsoring the Convocation, various invitees from all across Golarion are in attendance, from Absalom’s own Dacilane Academy to the Indraracha Institute in Tian Xia’s Tang Mai. Each is ready with their own perspective, as well as an item, spell, or some other piece of knowledge to contribute. One school we’re sure many will recognize is the Sihedron Spires, who bring with them their knowledge of rune magic and the (now fully remastered) runelord archetype!</p>

                   <h2>Meet our Writers!</h2>
                   <p>It was up to the authors of this book to bring these schools and other attendees to life, giving each their own voice and beliefs that you can embody through PCs and NPCs alike. I’d like to thank Sharang Biswas, Jeremy Blum, Carlos Cisco, Aoife Ester, Laura Lynn Horst, Andrew Mullen, Kendra Leigh Speedling, Stephanie Lundeen, Mahpiya, Collette Quach, Mikhail Rekun, Erin Roberts, Navaar Seik-Jackson, Shahreena Shahrani, Gina Susanna, Tan Shao Han, and Esther Wallace.</p>
                   <h2>Developing the Looks</h2>
                   <p>Lastly, an important part of bringing these schools to life was their look. While we had a good number of references for the look of the Magaambya and Lepidstadt, some of our other schools just haven’t had much time in the spotlight (and the Academy of the Reclamation is brand new!), so let me show you a bit of how they look around the Convocation in this concept art from our very own Kent Hamilton.</p>

                  <p>“Don’t wander into the trees by yourself or you’ll be taken by the little-men-in-the-woods!”</p>
                  <p>Samo had heard such warnings her entire life, repeated in fireside tales and stories told to pass the hours when her people left the summer fishing camps to travel to their inland lodges closer to Icemark’s caribou herds for the winter. Samo was spirit-touched, born with the mark of the elk, an angel’s golden eyes, and unusual insight. The cautionary stories always seemed to be directed at her, specifically, when it was her father’s turn to tell the tales, as though her gifts would be more likely to lead her astray than the other children. Perhaps there was some merit to that worry.</p>
                  <p>It wasn’t that she didn’t believe the stories on that summer day when she crept down to the shoreline by herself. Her father and uncles had been gone for several weeks now, taking her grandmother to Seer’s Home, where the elderly woman would live out the rest of her days among the Varki elders, now that her aged hips and back could no longer handle the nomadic migrations between fishing camps and hunting lodges. Samo wanted to be the first to greet her father on his return, and she was twelve years old now, nearly an adult by her reckoning, and she was accustomed to the little spirits warning her of dangers before others ever became aware of them.</p>
                  <p>Thus, it was particularly surprising when a cold, slimy paw wrapped in dank fur clutched her from behind, covering her mouth. Her screams were completely muffled, and all she could do was struggle in terror as she realized what had grabbed her: a kushtaka! Part man, part otter, the soulless creatures would drag her back to their village where they would cast her soul from her body and transform her into one of them! Worse yet, there were nearly twenty of the fearsome creatures quietly slipping from the waters around her. An entire kushtaka raiding party had come, doubtless here to take the encampment and disappear with them before anyone could so much as raise an alarm.</p>
                  <p>Despite all the terror she already felt, Samo discovered that things could still get worse. For every kushtaka that slipped from the waves, the insubstantial, sad-eyed form of a human walked beside them. Among the lost souls, she saw her father and uncles. Thrashing desperately, Samo thrust her small hand out towards her father’s spirit, and the ghostly figure reached out to her in response. As their fingertips brushed, it felt like lightning struck.</p>
                  <p>The kushtaka holding Samo screamed in agony, the sound finally awakening the people in the nearby fishing camp. Her father’s ghostly figure was nowhere to be seen, but the monster’s body changed and contorted, its otter’s fangs and fur falling away as its bones stretched to reveal her father’s features.</p>
                  <p>Samo used the opportunity to run towards the camp, where she snatched up one of the nets laced with dog bone that had been left there to repel just such an incursion. Dashing towards the kushtaka, she saw the spirits of the lost Varki moving to aid her, and she swung the net about, pulling the spirits together with the soulless bodies that had once belonged to them, triggering transformations like the one that had happened with her father. The sounds and cries of battle finally drew the rest of the village to her side, and Varki men and women with spears and daggers did what they could to fend the remaining kushtaka away while herding as many as they could towards Samo and her net.</p>
                  <p>Though over half of the kushtaka escaped back into the waves, Samo managed to save her father, her uncles, and a handful of other Varki from neighboring encampments. As Samo’s people gathered around, her father knelt down before her. “You do not belong here anymore, beloved. Your gifts must be nurtured by those who understand them.”</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Samo joined her grandmother at Seer’s Home and helped care for the Varki elders there while they taught her everything they knew of her people’s legends, traditions, and magic. In her early twenties she had a brief, passionate love with a handsome young man named Nankou who also resided at Seer’s Home for a time, but their duties called them apart more often than they drew them together.</p>
                  <p>Samo’s ability to see what others could not made her into a healer and counselor, the person others called on when they suspected that unusual events were the doings of unquiet spirits. When fires raged, she spoke to the spirits of flame and calmed them. When people disappeared along the coastline, she would accompany the hunters who sought out the kushtaka villages hidden nearby, speaking to the apparitions that dwelt in the rivers and ocean waves to help guide them to those enclaves of lost souls.</p>
                  <p>It seemed to Samo that hardly any time at all had passed between that day on the beach where she returned her father and uncles from the kushtaka and the day when she looked into a small hand mirror and realized that many silver strands now danced amid the raven-wing black of her hair. Where had the days gone? Samo did not regret her service, but she envied the stories she heard of her old friend Nankou and his adventures slaying linnorms and rescuing would-be heroes.</p>
                  <p>One night, Samo sat amid the grove of Seer’s Home. Her grandmother had passed almost twenty years before, but the woman’s spirit still lingered in that peaceful grove, appearing to Samo’s eyes as a majestic elk woven from the leaves and grasses of the grove itself. That evening, they conversed as they had so many times before, but unlike those previous occasions, their conversation was interrupted by a spectacular and terrifying sight.</p>
                  <p>Two great figures battled in the sky, gods of the southern lands. One, covered in armored spikes, was struck down, his body ripped asunder. As red and silver droplets rained from the sky, Samo’s spiritual sight and physical sight crashed together.</p>
                  <p>As the god died above, she saw another battle: a powerful young man from a distant land fighting a fearsome demonic owl, until both were struck by the droplets of falling god-blood. The twined pair were spun a great distance through the air until Samo’s spirit sight faded and she saw that they were both truly there, in the flesh, crashing to the ground on Icemark’s shores.</p>
                  <p>A Calling thrummed within her. She knew this was a moment where all that she was and all that she had learned would be tested, when her choices and actions would determine not just the future of Icemark, but perhaps that of all the Inner Sea. Perhaps more.</p>
                  <p>She dashed to her home, and pulled on her well-used armor of bone, hide, and driftwood. She slid her clan hat down over her antlers, so that whoever she met would know that they faced a Varki woman of standing and power. Her grandmother’s apparition flowed into her, filling her with the peaceful magic of healing and quiet places.</p>
                  <p>Moving swiftly towards the shoreline and the fallen figures, her grandmother’s thoughts echoed her own. Let us go, the women thought. <em>This Calling is for us, this time is ours, and whatever may happen next, the world will know the power of the women of the north</em>.</p>

The <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/StarfinderPlaytest_TrackingSheet.pdf">Starfinder Playtest tracking sheet</a> is now available at <strong>starfinderplaytest.com</strong>, ready for you to track your participation in the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/society/s2Playtest">two playtest scenarios</a> as well as the published softcover adventures. Let us know what you think in the playtest surveys!</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                  <p>As Gen Con is our biggest stage, we took the time to do quite a bit of recognition of our volunteers!</p>
                  <h3>Order of the Wayfinder</h3>
                  <p>In addition to the Campaign Service Coin, we also have one other award: the Order of the Wayfinder. This award is given out only once per year, and it recognizes a member of the community who has provided exceptional service. Typically, we give this award to individuals who have taken on a particular project and knocked it out of the park. Previously, this award has been awarded to the head of our Additional Resources review team and our Regional Venture-Coordinator for the Online region, among others.</p>
                  <p>This year’s recipient, awarded at Gen Con, was <strong>Lucas Servideo</strong>. Lucas is a longtime volunteer with Paizo Organized Play and currently serves as the Regional Venture-Coordinator for the Northeast region. Over the past several years, Lucas has been dedicated to the Pathfinder Academy program, which is our program for younger players and new Pathfinders. Bringing new players into the program is crucial, and Lucas is a warm, welcoming, and dedicated first point of contact for our youngest Pathfinders. He has been a crucial advocate for this program, and I was thrilled to award him with the Wayfinder this year while he was dressed as his contemplative character. That’s just how we do things around here.</p>
                  <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>
                  <p>Additionally, I awarded two Campaign Service Coins at Gen Con! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay@paizo.com with their name and reasons.</p>
                  <p>Congratulations to:</p>
                  <p><strong>David Malkiewicz</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #908</p>
                  <p><strong>Darrel Curry</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #909</p>
                  <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                  <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                  <p><strong>5th Star (PFS1): </strong>Jason Belter</p>
                  <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2): </strong>John Brinkman, David Malkiewicz, Mykal Merrill</p>
                  <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p>
                  <p>That’s quite enough from me! I’m off to PaizoCon Europe to eat cheese and chocolate—and probably do some gaming somewhere in there. Until next time: Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the summer sunshine (or winter sunshine, for our southern hemisphere friends)!</p>

                  <p>At the $30-or-more digital tier, you’ll also receive two complete Starfinder Adventure Paths themed around the Drift Crisis, which was the first major cross-product meta-event Paizo ever produced, the precursor to such events as Pathfinder’s current War of Immortals event, or the sweeping setting changes coming to Starfinder with the advent of Second Edition. This tier includes the following (asterisks indicate products with Hero Lab Online character creation material unlocked alongside the PDF): the entire Drift Crashers Adventure Path (<em>Starfinder Drift Crashers Player’s Guide</em>, <em>The Perfect Storm, Nightmare Scenario</em>, and <em>Masters of Time and Space)</em>, the entire Drift Hackers Adventure Path (<em>Starfinder Drift Hackers Player’s Guide</em>, <em>A Light in the Dark</em>, <em>Clockwork Demons</em>, and <em>Into the Dataverse)</em>, <em>Starfinder Drift Crisis*</em>, <em>Starfinder Adventure: Drift Crisis Case Files</em>, <em>Starfinder Near Space*</em>, <em>Starfinder Ports of Call*</em>, and <em>Starfinder One-Shot: Before the Storm</em>.</p>

                  <p>That’s a $666 value (a coincidence, we assure you!) in digital products alone, including over $120 in Hero Lab Online character creation assets, all for $30! If a discount of more than 95% weren’t enough to entice you, consider the $40 physical tier: a hardcover copy of <em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em>. This book retails for $44.99 by itself, so not only are you getting the book at a discount, but you’ll get all the digital content as well. When you redeem your Humble Bundle codes on paizo.com, the book will be added to your cart at no cost; you simply pay shipping and handling at checkout.</p>

                  <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p itemprop="description">Last year, we released an exclusive module called the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-tokens-bestiaries">Pathfinder Tokens: Bestiaries</a>, a token pack that offered high-quality portrait and token artwork for all 1207 actors in the three Bestiaries released for Pathfinder Second Edition. We were overwhelmed by the positive response to that module and we’ve been eager to follow it up with another token pack ever since, even as we’ve been working on other projects. Since then, we’ve been hard at work on new modules, like our conversion of the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-kingmaker">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a> adventure path, all while continuing to push the potential of the core software even further forwards, with the release of <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/releases/">Foundry VTT Version 12</a> bringing in a whole new suite of exciting features.</p>
                  <p>In that time, a lot has changed in the Pathfinder ecosystem too: the Pathfinder system has been remastered, playtesting has begun for a Starfinder Second Edition, and Paizo recently released a <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq056kl?Pathfinder-Tokens-Monster-Core">Monster Core token pack</a>, which expands on the Pathfinder Tokens: Bestiaries module by providing artwork for the new creatures released in the remaster.</p>
                  <p>However, for all that’s changed, one thing hasn’t—the need for more tokens! And so we’re incredibly excited to announce the release of a brand new token pack, the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-tokens-characters">Pathfinder Tokens: Character Gallery</a>, which is planned to release on Wednesday, August 21.</p>
                  <p>In this blog post, I thought I’d start by introducing the Character Gallery, and talk about some of the reasons we’re so excited for it to release, as well as share a few behind-the-scenes peeks at the development of the module.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Module Features</h2>
                  <p>Pathfinder Tokens: Character Gallery is a brand-new token collection, comprising ~1200 unique portraits, each accompanied by a hand-crafted character token. Our intention is for this pack to cover a wide range of playable ancestries, making it an ideal tool for filling the ranks of previously faceless NPCs, or for picking out the perfect portrait for a heroic adventurer.</p>
                  <p>The module includes:</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>~1200 high-resolution portraits and tokens depicting characters of a variety of ancestries, professions, and classes, including high-profile named characters from the world of Golarion</li>
                   <li>Seamless compendium image replacement for ~100 actors from the Pathfinder Second Edition game system</li>
                   <li>Built-in support for Foundry VTT's Dynamic Tokens functionality</li>
                   <li>A bespoke new application that can be used to browse and filter the artwork from within Foundry, searching for assets by name or filtering by tags like ancestry, equipment, or armor</li>
                   <li>Integration with the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-tokens-bestiaries">Pathfinder Tokens: Bestiaries</a> module, allowing it to add its artwork to the Character Gallery application when both modules are active, with the potential for this integration to be used by other modules in the future</li>
                   <li>Detailed datasheets filled out with relevant metadata for each imageset, facilitating their sorting and filtering by the application</li>
                  </ul>

                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>The format and scope of the module should be readily familiar to anyone who knows our previous token project, the Pathfinder Tokens: Bestiaries module. The new pack features about as many tokens as the Bestiary pack, and we were delighted to bring back Ian Hildebrandt as our artist, ensuring that the tokens are created to the same—or better—standard that you’ve come to expect.</p>
                  <p>We’ve also taken full advantage of some new core innovations to push the features of the module even further. For instance, at release, the Character Gallery tokens will be fully configured for use with Foundry VTT’s new <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/dynamic-token-rings/">Dynamic Token Rings</a> framework, which means they’ll be readily compatible with any special features or visual effects that other content creators and module developers might implement.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps of greater significance to the average user, though, is a brand-new custom application, developed specifically for this module, which provides a means to search and filter the collection of artwork with ease from within your game world. For more information on the features of the Character Gallery application, you can check out the module’s <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-tokens-characters">package page</a>, but I thought I might also share some behind-the-scenes stories of how we first began designing and implementing the feature!</p>

                  <h2>Story Time: Creating the Character Gallery Application</h2>
                  <p>Ever since working on the Bestiaries token pack last year, we’ve been considering various ideas for what a follow-up token pack might look like. The idea of an NPC-focused pack was always one of our favourites, but one obstacle we had to solve before we could justify it was finding a way to deliver the art in a convenient and user-friendly way, from within the application. With the Bestiaries, we could map the artwork straight to the creatures inside the system compendiums, all configured and available without any effort required, but with an NPC or PC-focused pack, we weren’t initially sure how to provide a similar level of quick access. We didn’t want the module to just be a folder of assets—even incredibly gorgeous assets—that the user had to organise and manually assign to characters themselves. We needed a better solution.</p>
                  <p>The idea that ended up becoming the Character Gallery application first was actually first explored when working on our module for the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-kingmaker">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a> adventure path. When we were implementing the settlement-building subsystem, I had developed a very simple application that users could use to browse the different building assets and place them onto a scene to represent their growing village. The idea struck me as a good way to solve the very similar problem with delivering NPC artwork, so I worked on a quick, hasty mock-up during our next Free Project Friday—a team-wide tradition where, on the last Friday of each month, we work on individual passion projects or crazy ideas and pitch them to the rest of the team.</p>
                  <p>Just for fun, I thought I’d share a rare screenshot of that initial prototype as it looked after only one day of work. As you can see, the idea of a central grid view where the artwork thumbnails were displayed in big “cards” was always a core part of the vision—I wanted you to be able to see what you were picking. The filtering functionality on the left-hand side, meanwhile, was inspired by Pathfinder’s own traits mechanic, and echoes some aspects of the PF2E system’s compendium browser.</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1c67223c-d599-4b68-bda0-74ae06037ed1/240814_Foundry_timeline.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1c67223c-d599-4b68-bda0-74ae06037ed1/240814_Foundry_timeline.png" width="85%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A triptych depicting three stages of evolution for the idea that would become the Character Gallery, from the application that inspired it, to its very first prototype, to the version of it that exists today."></a>
                   <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                   If you can look past the rough exterior, and the fact that many of the buttons didn’t work, it showed promise—and it’s kind of remarkable, now, to see simultaneously how little and how much the application changed in its journey to the final product we have today. 
                  <br>
                  <h2>Where does that data come from?</h2>
                  <p>All the metadata about each piece of art—the tags, the source, the label—are loaded from a datasheet, provided by the module, which contains a range of useful information about each imageset. These datasheets are what allow the app to filter and search the entire collection for the exact piece of art you need at any moment.</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c7a08d00-a61c-40fe-830b-e2e521376db3/240814_Foundry_forest-guide.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c7a08d00-a61c-40fe-830b-e2e521376db3/240814_Foundry_forest-guide.png" width="85%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A screenshot taken within Foundry VTT, showing the Character Gallery application being used to search for characters in the “explorers” family and wielding bows. The user has elected to replace the artwork of their current character, and a dialog window is open, previewing the change and awaiting confirmation."></a>
                   <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>As you can see, the application also has a tab for searching for artwork of companions, as well as player characters. For the Character Gallery, that mostly means the sprites and leshies, but for users with the Bestiaries token pack installed, they’ll see various animals, crawling hands, and other creatures populating that tab as well!</p>
                  <p>This is possible thanks to a hidden but powerful feature of the application—it can load more than one datasheet at once, allowing other modules to create a datasheet of their own which allows their artwork to be loaded into the application. It’s our hope that, by including module support in this way, we’re creating opportunities for future modules—both ours and those developed by other creators—to integrate with the Character Gallery. In fact, the ease of module development on the Foundry VTT platform means that this functionality is in reach of many end users, as well, if they’re interested in creating and loading their own custom datasheets into the module.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>I could go on, but I should save some surprises for the module’s release. I’m very excited for people to get their hands on it, and I hope that it lives up to the vision we set out with! If anyone has any questions, I or some of my colleagues will surely be replying in the comments, and there’s also an FAQ on the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-tokens-characters">module’s page</a> on our website with a little more information.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description"><b>Wow! What a Gen Con!</b></p>
                  <p>Hello everyone! It’s been over a week since Gen Con wrapped up and the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">Starfinder Playtest</a> went public. What a year these past two weeks have been, eh?</p>
                  <p>First off, the Starfinder team wants to extend our most sincere appreciation to everyone who’s engaged with the playtest since its release. Along with tables diving right into <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez5?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday"><em>A Cosmic Birthday</em></a>, we’ve also got feedback streaming in from those of you who’ve taken part in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02jnz"><em>Shards of the Glass Planet</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02jo2?Starfinder-Playtest-Scenario-2-It-Came-from-the-Vast"><em>It Came From the Vast!</em></a>. There’s really nothing quite like seeing hundreds of tables participating in demos and playtest games at the show and knowing even more are happening at tables across the world. So once again, thank you all for your participation!</p>
                  <p>In the coming weeks we’ll be providing some additional FAQs and Errata, as well as more blogs detailing our thoughts on how the playtest is going and some directions that we’re looking to steer components of the game into. We’re not going to dive into any of those today, as we’re still eager to get some unvarnished feedback on the game as we’ve released it, but expect more content in the coming weeks as we identify critical issues.</p>
                  <p>For now, please keep submitting your feedback about the next edition of Starfinder over at the surveys listed on <a href="https://starfinderplaytest.com/">StarfinderPlaytest.com</a>. Even if you don’t have answers for everything now, you can always go back into your surveys right up until the playtest period ends at the end of December.</p>
                  <p>For a little bonus, for those of you who missed our Starfinder Keynote panel at Gen Con, we wanted to once again reveal the cover art for <em>Starfinder GM Core</em>, done by Paizo’s own Kent Hamilton. <em>Starfinder GM Core</em> is set to release in 2025 as part of the full Starfinder release. We’re so excited to dive into the future (of Starfinder)!</p>

                 <blockquote>
                  <p itemprop="description">Among piles of stacked books, Marbrook heard the tingle of the front door chimes. The front door whose OPEN sign clearly faced inward. The pair of entrants, a goblin in goggles and a human with a coat and cane, made themselves at home browsing the bookstore’s shelves. Or they were casing the joint to rob. If they were going to rob her later, they would be the second most audacious thieves Marbrook had ever witnessed. The most audacious thieves, meanwhile, were those the two would be if they were to rob her in this very inconvenient moment.</p>
                  <p>The bookseller suppressed a huff, feeling her bleaching subside from the annoyance. There were greater challenges at hand. Ages ago, someone had rearranged her entire store’s inventory. While it was a hilarious prank, Marbrook would rather eject her soul back to the First World than run her shop out of alphabetical order. This created her current impasse: ignore the intruders or stop replacing the books momentarily.</p>
                  <p>The choice was obvious. Marbrook let the intruders be, as they were entranced by the books floating about the store and seemed to pose little immediate threat. The spectral assistants responsible for that spectacle, which she remembered neither hiring nor requesting, were both a blessing and a curse. They were handy at keeping the shop tidy, and less so in put the books back in order.</p>
                  <p>The human of the pair waved at the spectral figures. “Hello! Pardon our intrusion.” The spirits said nothing back. “I don’t think they can help us,” the human concluded, stroking a trimmed beard.</p>
                  <p>“Not for talking. For cleaning, maybe?” the goblin guessed.</p>
                  <p>“The store <em>is</em> spotless. Maybe she planned a holiday,” said the human. “They are moving the books about rather… unnecessarily, however.”</p>
                  <p>The goblin pointed to the corner furthest away. “Fumbus will start over there.” The human watched Fumbus skitter away before realizing the goblin meant to search for the source of these ethereal spirits. Following his example, the human strolled to the other far corner. With this division of labor, Marbrook reckoned she had three minutes before she needed to decide which of the two tomes immediately at hand would best suffice as a weapon: the <em>Revised History of Taldor, 28th Edition</em>, or <em>Encyclopedia Chelaxia</em>, volume 18.</p>
                  <p>Long before that time came, Marbrook heard the familiar squeak of the floorboard from the center of the shop. She did not suppress her huff this time. She meant to fix that loose board, except books happened.</p>
                  <p>“Quinn!” Fumbus shouted, probably meaning the human. Quinn strode over, footsteps crisp and measured. This was followed by whispers, then the rustling of a backpack, then the groan and splintering of floorboards. Quinn vocalized dismay. Fumbus oopsed.</p>
                  <p>Marbrook stood like a war god roused to battle. She watched from behind her book pile as Quinn reached into the new hole in her precious floorboards to pull out a bowl of… blue stuff. Marbrook had not put that bowl there. Or rather, she did not remember doing so. Maybe her bleaching caused a memory lapse, but somehow, that blame felt misplaced.</p>
                  <p>“A ritual.” Quinn drew a sharp breath. “For… spirit custodians?”</p>
                  <p>“It can last a year.” Fumbus poked the inside the bowl and made a face at the squish. The goblin then sniffed the bowl, and made a different face. Finally, Fumbus licked the blue stuff. A wide smile appeared. “This one is fresh. Three months.”</p>
                  <p>“That lines up. Now, until the duration expires, the spirits continue their task unless ordered otherwise. If I recall correctly, it usually gave you one, two, three…” Quinn trailed off. There were only three assistants to count. “Fumbus, have you heard any gossip lately?”</p>
                  <p>Marbrook did not know why Quinn changed the subject, but she did sheathe her inner war god. Reorganizing the books had kept her indoors and away from the gossip on the street for too long. Long enough she suspected she had bleached a shade. If these intruders were about to share some juicy secrets, she would very much like them to continue. She might even forgive them for the floorboards.</p>
                  <p>When Fumbus replied “I have. I saw some,” Marbrook rejoiced. The bookseller crept out of her book fortress, adjusting a small pile of rummaged paperwork as she passed.</p>
                  <p>Quinn sounded equally delighted. “Excellent! What have you heard?”</p>
                  <p>“Orange worms!”</p>
                  <p>The goblin looked expectantly at his companion, whose blank stare rivaled Fumbus’s own emotionless goggles. It gave Marbrook time to settle in for a good view, and put more paper away. “You don’t say?”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, while <em>you </em>were talking to the jeweler about whatever, <em>I </em>was listening to the gardeners tending the shop’s flower box. And do you know what Fumbus heard? The orange worms are back, and <em>that </em>means the ebon rooks will be back, and you know what <em>that </em>means!” Quinn clearly didn’t, but while he had initially tried to ignore his yammering companion, the passion with which Fumbus recounted the tale pulled him away from his distractions. Marbrook was equally rapt. What could the goblin be going on about?</p>
                  <p>For the better part of five minutes, the goblin barely paused to take a breath as he led Quinn and Marbrook down a roundabout stream of consciousness—some overheard, some observed, and much seemingly coming from the random recesses of his overactive mind. Rooks. String. The best cucumbers to pickle in this part of the country this time of year. An annoying Isgeri folk song stuck in his head. Some alternate lyrics to that song. Something about soil composition. Bird droppings (employing rather rude language, if Marbrook was being honest).</p>
                  <p>When he reached what seemed the logical conclusion of his line of reasoning, he once again stared intently at Quinn. After a long, expectant moment, Quinn said, “Yes, I see.”</p>
                  <p>Fumbus’s mouth gaped open. “You do <em>not </em>see, Quinn! The orange worms mean the soil is especially rich in phosphorus, and the <em>droppings—</em>” (again with the language) “—of the rooks after they <em>eat </em>the worms makes the perfect reagent for longer burning <em>fire</em>.”</p>
                  <p>“Ah,” Quinn interjected, clearly hoping this was the end of it. Marbrook got the sense that this was not the sort of “gossip” he’d had in mind when he inquired, and it certainly wasn’t what she’d hoped to overhear.</p>
                  <p>“But!” Fumbus jabbed a finger at his friend. “This isn’t the first time Quinn has missed something so obvious to Fumbus.”</p>
                  <p>Quinn, clearly wanting to escape the conversation, held up the bowl. “So, rituals need help—"</p>

                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>Fumbus, like a flame running out of fuel, lowered his arm and deflated, finally pausing to catch his breath. “Was… that enough?”</p>
                  <p>“More than enough. You did great.” Quinn squeezed out an assurance. “I think we know now which one of our friendly spirits here is the gossip-loving grandmother. I saw some papers instead of books being moved.” Quinn turned and looked straight at Marbrook. Into Marbrook.</p>
                  <p>“Also flinched when I swore.” Fumbus too met her gaze. The red-tinted googles reflected… nothing. No bleachling gnome, nor gossip-loving elderly bookseller. Just red glass with a spot of ethereal blue light.</p>
                  <p>A blush of embarrassment, of being caught eavesdropping, washed over Marbrook. Then came an emptiness—ethereal, spirit, void, death. Cold reality sank, disbelief hollowed. Blurred emotions unnamed, the swirl reverberated like a bell toll echoing <em>dead, dead, dead</em> in crescendo.</p>
                  <p>Marbrook screamed.</p>
                  <br>
                  <center>
                   <hr width="50%">
                  </center>
                  <br>
                  <p>Goosebumps ran up Quinn’s arm as the moan crawled under his skin. Beside him, Fumbus strangled a shriek. The ghost of Marbrook the bookseller, now in her shape in life, closed the distance. Quinn saw a missing eye, a slashed throat, and through the translucent body, a stab wound in the back. Such death would make a ghost of anyone, and make them want to forget it happened.</p>
                  <p>Crash! Glass shattered upon the ghost. Drops sizzled on the floor. Fumbus had retreated a distance, then improvised some acid from among his carried reagents to throw. Quinn was thankful the alchemist’s aim spared him, still beside the ghost, from collateral damage. He was also thankful Fumbus didn’t throw his usual alchemist fire. Not that it mattered against the ghost. Neither would have worked.</p>
                  <p>Quinn made his own retreat, thinking. They were ill-equipped and without backup. No blessed weapons, no holy water, no cleric. How do you fight a ghost under such circumstances? An intimately familiar voice in his mind answered, <em>“you don’t fight if you can help it; you try talking</em>.”</p>
                  <p>What should one talk to a livid ghost about? Hello there, may I inquire why you are a ghost? What tragedy befell you? With this bookstore, there were no signs of a struggle, no blood suggesting violence, not even a corpse. The shop was immaculately clean without even a speck of dust— unless it had not always been so.</p>
                  <p>The custodians. Their erratic shelving of the books. Quinn looked for the spirits. All three were gathered about the acid damage and broken glass, prodding at the stains and sweeping. Fumbus was right. The ritual <em>was</em> for cleaning. Cleaning up evidence, specifically. What “clean” means beyond stains and messes can be ambiguous. In some languages, clean also conveyed “to tidy” or “to organize”. One command, and you could not only erase evidence of a crime, but also make a store look as if its owner was still about, just… reorganizing inventory.</p>
                  <p>This was no normal crime, nor an average criminal. This was a professional.</p>
                  <p>Across the room, Fumbus shrieked with a gurgle, running away from a pursuing Marbrook as he downed a vial of red liquid. Quinn stowed the rudimentary criminal profile away. The plan for the immediate moment: One, talk Marbrook down from violence; two, ask questions without prolonging her suffering; three, leave this place alive with Fumbus.</p>
                  <p>Just in case, Quinn made an alternative plan which skipped to step three. There were some rook droppings he needed to make sure Fumbus had a chance to collect.</p>

                  <p>A Starfinder Second Edition Playtest adventure designed for 1st-level characters.</p>
                  <p>For millennia, Birnam’s Bubble has been a planet untouched by outsiders, fully encapsulated in an impenetrable shield of unknown energy and protected by powerful automated defenses. Through this barrier, explorers and surveyors have glimpsed pristine settlements, verdant flora, and inexplicable magical emanations—yet no fauna or citizens populate the world’s surface.</p>
                  <p>As in many other parts of the galaxy, the Drift Crisis changed everything. Now, the energy barrier surrounding Birnam’s Bubble cracks like shattering glass, and shards of this solidified energy have begun to fall through the atmosphere to the planet’s surface, causing significant destruction. Enter the breach and uncover the secrets of the lost civilizations of Birnam’s Bubble before they're lost forever!</p>

                  <p>A Starfinder Second Edition Playtest adventure designed for 5th-level characters.</p>
                  <p>Countless derelict and abandoned starships litter space, some damaged beyond repair, some containing valuable cargo, and others empty save for the dead. The Xenowarden starship&nbsp;<em>Bloom</em>&nbsp;is one such ship. During a routine survey mission to a newly discovered dwarf planet in the Vast, the crew of the&nbsp;<em>Bloom</em>&nbsp;collected a variety of biological and environmental samples, secured the samples for further study, and departed, plotting a course through the Drift to a mobile research laboratory in the Pact Worlds.</p>
                  <p>The&nbsp;<em>Bloom</em>&nbsp;that emerged in Pact Worlds’ space was much changed—unresponsive, careening out of control, and with no sign of the ship’s crew. Explore the biomechanical corridors of the&nbsp;<em>Bloom</em>&nbsp;to uncover the fate of its missing crew and face off against a dangerous, alien predator that can’t be allowed to survive.</p>
                  <p>The&nbsp;<em>Bloom</em>&nbsp;is haunted. That’s the least of your problems.</p>

                  <p>With clues from around Jalmeray and Niswan, Venture-Captain Safa has been able to determine where the mysterious Benefactor lives in the city. It's up to a group of Pathfinders to break into the enormous mansion to confront her, all while avoiding her underlings and trying to find evidence of her wrongdoings. A secret plot to undermine the powers that be in Niswan is discovered, and there's only one place left to corner her: her private quarters.</p>

                  <p>Tabrid Minor is a planet on the brink of devastating ecological collapse. While the planet’s government refuses to alter course or change policy, hope is not lost. The Coenocopi Foundation works hard to rekindle ancient copaxi magical traditions in the belief that their spread would cause many citizens to adopt a more ecologically responsible way of life, turning the tide of destruction. Unfortunately, these magical traditions have been lost to time and government erasure.</p>
                  <p>Enter the Starfinder Society! Explore the rotating ruins of Gadrathar Fortress, a shattered citadel floating many miles above the surface of Tabrid Minor, while on a quest for ancient wisdom and magical secrets.</p>

                  <p><strong>Aucturn explodes!</strong> That’s right, everybody; we’re kicking Starfinder Second Edition off with a bang and blowing up one of the Pact Worlds! For those who weren’t keeping up, Aucturn is the most distant, mysterious planet in the sun’s orbit (kind of like Pluto), except it has a toxic atmosphere and is crawling with monsters like orocorans and carrion wheels. Yikes! To make things worse, most people who live on Aucturn are cultists of eldritch gods. That said, though it was a pretty weird place, nobody expected it to explode!</p>
                  <p>Many people in the Pact Worlds believed Aucturn was really an egg. There was even a cult dedicated to nurturing the eldritch being inside it, and it’s rumored that the planet’s ruler drank his power from the unborn monstrosity. Well, it turns out they were right—Aucturn <em>is</em> an egg, and it just hatched. As you can imagine, this immediately caused problems in Pact Worlds space and across the whole galaxy. Magic went haywire, planets got knocked out of orbit, people experienced bizarre visions, and a strange new god called the Newborn emerged into cosmic consciousness. The weirdness isn’t going to end anytime soon, but it all starts with the playtest. Play<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez5?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday"><em>A Cosmic Birthday</em></a><em>, </em>a playtest module for 1st-level characters, if you want to experience the disaster/miracle of the Newborn’s emergence firsthand.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>Pulonis declares independence! </strong>Pulonis (formerly known as Vesk-6) was defeated and occupied by the Veskarium for a long time, but its war for freedom never truly ended. While Veskarium forces were stretched thin during the Drift Crisis, Pulonis finally achieved independence. Soon after, Pulonis joined the Pact alliance as the first full member not located in the Pact Worlds system. Starfinder Second Edition is celebrating Pulonis by adding pahtras as a core ancestry and Meyel the Dancing Fury (their patron god) as a core deity. Surely this won’t upset the Veskarium, right? Well, speaking of that…</p>
                  <p><strong>Azlanti Star Empire challenges the Veskarium!</strong> It’s the war we’ve all been waiting for—let them fight! The Pact Council must have been feeling pretty smug about the Veskarium getting distracted right after the stunt they pulled with Pulonis, until they realized that an interstellar war has far-reaching consequences even for those who aren’t involved. If you want to be part of Starfinder history and experience the beginning of this war, play<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq047ul?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-Empires-Devoured"><em>Empires Devoured</em></a>, a playtest module for 10th-level characters.</p>

                  <p><strong>New gods join the core pantheon!</strong> You’ll notice that old favorites like Oras and Triune have been joined by some new divine faces. We’ve added the patron gods of the Azlanti Star Empire and Pulonis, as well as two completely new deities that emerged after recent cosmic events, to the list of core deities. Now your character can be a rune-scourged follower of Lissala, a graceful warrior of Meyel, study the enigma of the Newborn, or channel pain into art for Zon-Shelyn. You can read more about all the gods, old and new, in the<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez4"><em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em></a>.</p>

During our last visit, a team of heroic Starfinders forced the planet’s government to realize an important truth: to save Tabrid Minor and prevent a devastating ecological collapse, they would need to cease industrialization and dedicate time and resources to the healing of their world. Surely the government took our advice and the planet is taking the first steps toward a brighter, healthier future! Right? …Right?</p>

                  <p>Hello Pathfinders, and welcome to yet another heat-filled summer month!</p>
                  <p>(At least for those of us in the northern hemisphere.)</p>
                  <p>(How’s your winter going, southern hemisphere?)</p>
                  <p>Anyway! As we’re preparing for Gen Con and the start of the Year of Immortal Influence, we don’t have too much to show off, which means that our finale scenario of the Year of Unfettered Exploration takes center stage!</p>
                  <p>This month we’re returning to Jalmeray and infiltrating the manor home of the Benefactor, a rakshasa mastermind who seems to have several plots up her beautiful, billowing sleeves! The Pathfinders must search her home during a gathering of her underlings, looking for evidence of any future plans and schemes. Rather quickly, one scheme becomes very obvious: a notable figure in Niswan is in big trouble, but also the list of artifacts that the Benefactor seems to own is disturbing yet tantalizing.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description"><em>You step hesitantly into a musty cellar crowded with alchemical glassware, stone crucibles, and the occasional metal antenna crackling with electricity. Strange-colored fluids in uncovered beakers bubble and smoke near jars that hold the remnants of failed experiments floating in formaldehyde.

Is Finished!”</em></p>
                  <p>Hello! Pay no attention to the man in the intro. He was laughed out of the university for his unorthodox research. But his theories—and some healthy doses of mutagenic mixtures—have led the way for a Remastered version of the alchemist class coming in <em>Player Core 2</em>!</p>
                  <p>The alchemist can craft chemical concoctions that can aid in all manner of situations. From deadly poisons to life-saving elixirs to explosive bombs, an alchemist can whip up the perfect item, provided they have the formula. The <em>Core Rulebook</em> version of the class had limited resources each day that could be used in multiple ways. However, while this was flexible, it created very complex decisions based on guesswork, which often ended up disappointing. We wanted to smooth out these choices while retaining the core functions of the class.</p>
                  <p>To that end, instead of having a large batch of infused reagents at the start of the day that require the alchemist to choose how many they are using with advanced alchemy and how many to save for Quick Alchemy, these two resources are now separate. Infused reagents are gone! At the start of each day, an alchemist makes a certain number of alchemical items that they can keep for themself or hand off to friends; remember that these items are only good for 24 hours, so be sure to use them!</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/4b3ccba7-b169-48a9-966e-9ba896dbc084/20190523-Encounter.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/4b3ccba7-b169-48a9-966e-9ba896dbc084/20190523-Encounter.jpg" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Art by Federico Musetti: Pathfinder iconic Alchemist, Fumbus, delightedly tossing a bomb behind him as he runs from large humanoid rats"></a>
                   <p style="font-size: 13px;">Fumbus, the iconic alchemist, blows stuff up real good.<br>
                     Art by Federico Musetti</p>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>In addition, an alchemist also has a number of what we’re calling versatile vials, which are small mixtures of fast-acting chemicals that can be easily turned into other consumables. On their own, versatile vials can be thrown as acidic bombs, and with the Quick Alchemy action, an alchemist can turn a versatile vial into an alchemical consumable they know the formula for; this item remains potent until the start of the alchemist’s next turn. Each research field presents a unique way for the alchemist to use their versatile vials. For example, a mutagenist can drink one of their versatile vials to temporarily suppress the drawback of one mutagen they are under the effects of. And a chirurgeon can hurl a versatile vial at a willing ally within 20 feet for some distance healing!</p>
                  <p>The number of versatile vials an alchemist has isn’t a finite daily resource. They can replenish their vials over time as they gather alchemical ingredients during exploration mode. If things start going poorly, an alchemist can also whip up a temporary versatile vial using Quick Alchemy, though it can’t be used to make a different kind of item. And the 2nd-level Improvise Admixture feat allows the alchemist to scrounge together enough materials for a few extra ready-to-use versatile vials once per day as a single action.</p>
                  <p>We found the space in this book for toxicology, a research field that was introduced in the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>. It’s included here in all its noxious glory, and poisons created by such an alchemist deal acid damage instead of poison damage if that would be more detrimental. The toxicologist’s 13th-level greater field discovery causes a victim of one of their injury poisons to spray that toxin onto an adjacent creature, exposing them to the same poison. Not a fun time for the toxicologist’s enemies!</p>
                  <p>Finally, we know a lot of you are curious to hear more about the alchemist’s attack proficiencies. Some of the other designers didn’t want me to tell you this, but I’ve slipped some soporifics in their morning coffees, so they won’t even notice. Alchemists are still getting their alchemical weapon expertise at 7th level, but they now also receive alchemical weapon mastery at 15th level. Get those bombs ready!</p>
                  <p>We are very excited for you to see the class when <em>Player Core 2</em> releases… soon! So soon, it’s making me a little anxious. Perhaps one of these mysterious elixirs left behind by that scientist will calm me down… Oh no, what have I done? I feel… What is happening to me?!?</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Regurgitate Mutagen [one-action] Feat 4</h3>
                  <p><strong>Alchemist, Manipulate</strong><br><strong>Requirements</strong> You are under the effects of a mutagen.</p>
                  <p>You redirect a mutagen within your body to spit a stream of stomach acid at a foe. A creature within 30 feet takes 1d6 acid damage for every 2 levels you have, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. On a failure, the creature is also sickened 1 (or sickened 2 on a critical failure). The mutagen’s duration immediately ends.</p>

                  <h2>How We Playtest</h2>
                  <p>The easiest way to playtest is to explore the material, cooperate with other players, and report back using our surveys! There will be four surveys: the <strong>Class Survey</strong> asks specific questions about your character choices and experiences, the <strong>Class Open Response Survey </strong>that allows for more freeform feedback about each of our six classes, the <strong>Game Feedback Survey</strong> that lets you provide feedback about any other material in the <em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em>, and the <strong>Adventure Feedback Survey</strong> where you can share your experiences and feedback about our playtest adventures!&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>You can find the playtest and all supplementary information at<a href="http://www.starfinderplaytest.com/"> StarfinderPlaytest.com</a></p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>When We Playtest</h2>
                  <p>The <em>Starfinder Playtest Second Edition Rulebook</em>, our first two playtest adventures, and the playtest surveys go live on August 1 at 10 a.m. EST. The Playtest Rulebook PDF is free and the necessary rules from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej2?Pathfinder-Player-Core"><em>Pathfinder Player Core</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eok?Pathfinder-GM-Core"><em>Pathfinder GM Core</em></a> can be found online with our partners at <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/">Archives of Nethys</a>. The playtesting period lasts until December 31, 2024, when the surveys officially close. You can go back and modify your survey at any point during the playtest period, so don’t wait until the last minute thinking you’ve tried every class or run every adventure.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>What We Playtest</h2>
                  <p>We’re releasing two Starfinder adventures and four scenarios during the playtest period that help support the playtest itself. These adventures and scenarios feature a wide variety of challenges and encounters as the playtests focus on player facing options. We won’t spoil anything here for our players who want to avoid spoilers, but you can read more about each adventure on their accompanying product pages!<br><br><strong>Playtest Scenarios</strong> are one-shots that should take roughly 2 hours to play, but can be used as a launching point or side quest during a longer ongoing campaign.<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02jnz?Starfinder-Playtest-Scenario-1-Shards-of-the-Glass-Planet"><em>Starfinder Playtest Scenario #1: Shards of the Glass Planet</em></a> by Mike Kimmel is a 1st-level scenario,<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02jo2?Starfinder-Playtest-Scenario-2-It-Came-from-the-Vast"><em>Starfinder Playtest Scenario #2: It Came from the Vast!</em></a> by Jessica Catalan is a 5th-level scenario,<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq03kpi?Starfinder-Playtest-Scenario-3-Wheel-of-Monsters"><em>Starfinder Playtest Scenario #3: Wheel of Monsters</em></a> by Dustin Knight is a 10th-level scenario with variable encounters coming out September 25,<em> and</em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq04v06/discuss?Starfinder-Playtest-Scenario-4-Rescue-at-Shimmerstone-Mine#1"><em> Starfinder Playtest Scenario #4: Rescue at Shimmerstone Mine</em></a>by Jenny Jarzabski is a 15th-level scenario coming out late October.</p>
                  <p><strong>Playtest Adventures</strong> are longer self-contained adventures that should take multiple sessions to complete and take characters across multiple levels. These adventures are great introductions to the Starfinder setting and help players experience two major events taking place in our setting.<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez5?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday"><em>Starfinder Second Edition Playtest Adventure: A Cosmic Birthday</em></a> by Jenny Jarzabski begins at 1st level, and<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq047ul?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-Empires-Devoured"><em> Starfinder Second Edition Playtest Adventure: Empires Devoured</em></a> by Thurston Hillman begins at 10th-level and will be released in October<em>.</em></p>
                  <p><strong>Home game</strong> data will be immensely helpful during the playtest process. GMs are highly encouraged to use monsters and other threats from the playtest adventures or Pathfinder Second Edition sources like <em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em>. Additional guidelines to running adventures during the playtest can be extrapolated using <em>Pathfinder GM Core</em>. We suggest avoiding variant rules during the playtest period, such as free archetype rules or proficiency without level.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Who We Playtest</h2>
                  <p>When building characters, stick to the official character creation guidelines as much as possible. We will have pregenerated characters for every class available during the playtest, with character sheets you can print out at home that include all the information you need to play each character.</p>
                  <p>Players should avoid using Pathfinder Second Edition ancestries, backgrounds, classes, equipment, and feats that aren’t explicitly included in the playtest. Note that most of the skill feats and some class feats from <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> have been included in the skill feat tables and are part of the playtest. Spells should be selected from the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> and <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em>. While these options are available, we encourage players to try the new feats and spells from the <em>Starfinder Playtest Core Rulebook</em> to provide us with new data.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Where We Playtest</h2>
                  <p>Gen Con and other major conventions, both in person and online, provide ample opportunity for playtesting. Finding a local or online Starfinder Society lodge is a surefire way to find people interested in playtesting, and you can find out how all these adventures fit into our Organized Play Program<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6uw6x?Starfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Playtest"> here</a>.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Why We Playtest</h2>
                  <p>The entire team is grateful for everyone’s enthusiasm and excitement as we venture into this new era of adventure! Paizo has a long tradition of playtesting new material, and the data you provide playing our games is critical to our process and morale (after all, nothing encourages a game developer like hearing about people playing our games)! While we prioritize the data we get from the playtest surveys, the Starfinder team actively reads and welcomes your thoughts on many social media platforms and communities including our own<a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/secondEditionPlaytest"> Second Edition Playtest Forum</a>!</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">Today, we’re excited to launch a new landing page featuring all the information fans, content creators, and other publishers need to legally use Paizo’s intellectual property—game rules, setting details, artwork, logos, and other copyrights and trademarks—in their own products. Whether you’re looking to make an online rules database using the ORC license, a setting compatible with Pathfinder Second Edition, an adventure set in the Pact Worlds system, an actual play podcast, or a series of handmade plushies of iconic heroes like Valeros, Seoni, and Lem, we’ve got everything you need at <a href="https://paizo.com/licenses"><strong>paizo.com/licenses</strong></a>.</p>
                  <p>Along with this new hub of information, we also made a few updates and revisions to our existing licenses, both for ease of use and to bring them up to date with the current state of our games and brands. You can find out more about these specific licenses on their respective pages on the site.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Paizo Compatibility License</h2>
                  <p>With Pathfinder (and soon Starfinder) in its second edition, we were starting to get a bit of a glut of system-specific compatibility licenses. So, we consolidated what was previously two distinct Pathfinder RPG Compatibility Licenses and a Starfinder Compatibility License into a single Paizo Compatibility License. Using the new license, a publisher can declare compatibility with any of our games and use the appropriate logo, and we don’t have to constantly maintain the list of products and game systems you can use it for.</p>
                  <p>We also got rid of the registration process by which publishers had to inform us they were using the license. Now, you agree to the license when you publish something using it, the same way you do for the OGL or ORC. Your use of one of the Compatibility Logos or our proprietary Pathfinder-Icons font aren’t locked behind any red tape. Just create your content, ensure you’re following all the rules of the license, and you’re ready to go.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite</h2>
                  <p>In October, on the eve of the Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster Project launch, we announced that the ORC license wouldn’t be usable on our Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite community content publishing platforms. While this initially caused a bit of confusion, in the months since, we’ve seen publishers continue using both platforms with great success, accessing Paizo’s IP via the Infinite License alone.</p>
                  <p>Next month, with the release of <em>Pathfinder Player Core 2</em>, we’ll have completed the 18-month task of divesting our core game from the OGL, and thus, starting on September 1, 2024, publishing of new OGL content on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite will cease; publishers wishing to release game content on either platform will need to use the Infinite license exclusively.</p>
                  <p>This means that until Starfinder Second Edition is officially out in just over a year, Starfinder content on the platform is going to need to be free of rules (setting lore, fiction, art assets, etc.) but once the new edition of the game is out, we plan to relaunch Starfinder Infinite in style. It also means that Pathfinder First Edition content, or Pathfinder Second Edition content based on OGL material, will also sunset from the platform in just over a month. So, if you have a Pathfinder product in the works featuring chuuls, the eight schools of magic, or yes, even drow, you have until the end of August to release them. We won’t be removing OGL-based content from the marketplace in September, but you won’t be able to release new material using the OGL after that point.</p>
                  <p>The Infinite FAQ and End User Licensing Agreement on the marketplaces will be updated closer to the date of the actual change, but consider this your fair warning.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Fan Content Policy</h2>
                  <p>As of today, Paizo’s Community Use Policy has been replaced by the Paizo Fan Content Policy, which serves a similar role, but with different provisions.</p>
                  <p>First, the Fan Content Policy will allow you to sell merchandise using our IP. Yes, for money. You will also be able to monetize other content using Paizo’s IP, like putting a live play of one of our Adventure Paths behind a Patreon paywall. There are restrictions to this, however, so make sure you read the license carefully before you put in your order with the factory to make high-end poster maps of Golarion. Anything you sell needs to be made by you and sold directly by you to the consumer. You can’t upload a bunch of our art to one of those print-on-demand shops that will let anyone put the art on whatever hat or mug or shirt they want. You can screen print shirts or sew your own plushies and sell them on an Etsy storefront you operate or at conventions, but not mass produce either or sell them through external services or storefronts. But those Pathfinder Society faction dice bags you have been making because you love them? You can totally start selling those now instead of just giving them away for free.</p>
                  <p>Most of what you could previously do with the Community Use Policy is still permitted under the Fan Content Policy except for making RPG products, which you’ll need to release through the Pathfinder or Starfinder Infinite storefronts (even for free if you want) from now on. So, you can’t use art from the blog or setting material from Golarion to make your own rulebook or adventure under this license. If you’re currently using the OGL or ORC in conjunction with the Community Use Policy, in order to be compliant with the new Fan Content Policy you’ll need to either remove any game rules that would require you to use cite those licenses or remove any non-rule content you accessed via the Community Use Policy.</p>
                  <p>We know that all this legal stuff can be intimidating and confusing for many fans, and for that, we apologize. It’s our hope that these changes largely improve the community’s ability to create and engage with our brands, our games, and each other, even if they’re different than what we’ve offered in the past. Be sure to check out each license’s FAQ for more information, or pose your questions in the forums or comments below. We’ll do our best to answer them in as timely and clear manner as possible.</p>
                  <p>Now go out there and start creating! We can’t wait to see what you have in store for us.</p>

                  <p>Hello, Starfinders!</p>
                  <p>The Starfinder Second Edition Playtest is ready for launch—but before we begin the countdown (t-minus <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">two weeks</span> and counting!) we’re sending out a transmission across the galaxy. The Pact Worlds needs those most celebrated heroes: playtesters! Are you ready to answer the call?</p>
                  <p>When the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez4">Starfinder Second Edition Playtest Rulebook</a> releases at GenCon 2024, we invite you to hop right into the action. Get your hands on the playtest rulebook, roll up some characters, and get playing! To support the playtest, we’ve got three tools waiting on standby! Download <strong>pre-generated</strong><strong>characters</strong>, play the <strong>demo</strong> at a convention, and purchase the <strong>Starfinder Playtest Scenarios</strong>!</p>
                  <p><strong>Pre-generated characters</strong> (better known as pregens) are official sample characters available as a free download on <a href="http://starfinderplaytest.com/"><em>starfinderplaytest.com</em></a><em>.</em> These pregens encompass all six of our playtest classes and are available at level 1 and level 5. Each pregen includes a character sheet and accompanying reference sheet which includes all the details a player needs to play that character. Our playtest pregens include: Navasi the human envoy, Chk Chk the shirren mystic, Iseph the android operative, Dae the pahtra solarian, Obozaya the vesk soldier, and Zemir the human witchwarper.</p>

Of course she wouldn’t voice any such complaints. That’s not what heroes did.</p>
                  <p>Last year she was saved by the real deal, when that weird planar nexus had trapped the Tskikha iruxi enclave along with some Pathfinder initiates–herself included. It was all she could do to keep her wits about her in that crisis, but the agents sent to rescue them did more than that–they got everyone home. After that she had redoubled her efforts, achieved her confirmation, and was even recognized by Kreighton Shaine for her part in helping those Pathfinder agents resolve the Blackwood Crisis. She nervously grasped the wayfinder he’d gifted her, feeling its weight. “And now I’m the hero,” she thought to herself.</p>

                  <p>Of course, heroism would have to wait. Newly confirmed agents were rarely sent on the most dangerous of missions and this was no different: routine maintenance on the leylines of Kayajima to keep the Three Gates Lodge properly protected. Still, she could hope. She risked another bout of nausea as she glanced around at her fellow Pathfinders. A few—like Kisuke, a kitsune sorcerer, and Tara, a human with aspirations to be a swordlord—were well known to her. Their goading was at the root of most of her misadventures resulting in angry lectures or extra chores during her time as an initiate. The tanuki sitting with them, Mochi, was apparently field commissioned after some incident in the Maze of the Open Road. Nixret didn’t really know the details, but wilder rumors spoke of a dance-off, and that couldn’t be right.</p>
                  <p>Noting her gaze Kisuke gave a grin, “Didn’t think kobold scales changed color, but I swear yours are looking even greener.” Nixret shot the kitsune a withering look, but the sight of the horizon bobbing up and down behind him sent her stomach reeling. Though her friend meant well, she was not enjoying this part of adventuring. Where were the dragons? The beasts barring her path? The artifacts of power they all would need to race to collect? She sighed and gave voice to her thoughts. “Weren’t we supposed to be adventuring, not doing cleaning and maintenance over some leylines that our predecessors already made safe?”</p>
                  <p>Her three companions nodded in understanding, but Tara calmly noted, “we can hardly be expected to be handed responsibility right after our Confirmations. I’m sure greater challenges will come. Besides, the task is important or else Venture-Captain Mukai wouldn’t have requested our help.” Nixret envied her friend’s ability to remain calm and composed–even when egging Nixret on to break curfew–but had to admit that she had a point. Besides, who knows when a routine mission could turn into a crisis? If nothing else, the events back in the Blackwood Swamp proved that without a shadow of a doubt. “Sometimes I just wish these routine tasks could turn into something much more epic,” she said with a sigh.</p>

                 <blockquote>
                  <p itemprop="description">“Fire,” the professor whispered. His hands shook as he traced the runes etched onto the walls.</p>
                  <p>The Taldan scholar—bald and stooped, somewhat like a pale turtle—had intricate tattoos coiling up his arms, neck, and cheek, like her own but of a different style. On their first night together, she had asked about the markings. <em>Irezoko</em>, he said they were called, borrowed from her own Varisian tradition and a sign of his rank in Absalom’s College of Mysteries, the rank of enigma.</p>
                  <p>Seoni frowned and scanned the long tunnel. Various support beams of the same smooth stone as the walls buttressed its length, and script she did not recognize covered the entirety. The symbols were old and worn, done long ago, but she looked for inhabitants anyway. There were no signs that the lizardfolk or giant beasts from the surface had found this place.</p>
                  <p>“The runes?” her tengu companion Korakai asked, prancing forward with a hop. As he did so, the various vials, scroll cases, paper talismans, totems, and baubles affixed to his robes and chain shirt clinked and slapped musically. An orb of liquid blue light followed at his shoulder. Korakai cocked his corvid head one way then the other, peering at the writing. “They say ‘fire,’ do they? How ominous. What else do they say?”</p>
                  <p>“It—it will take days,” the scholar said with awe, “perhaps weeks, to decipher. This is ancient script, you understand. More than ancient. From the Age of Serpents, I suspect!” He turned to them dramatically, his voice echoing in the tunnel.</p>
                  <p>At his declaration, Korakai tilted his head back the way, and Seoni stared unmoved. None of them spoke for several heartbeats. The professor sighed in disappointment at their reactions and turned back to the wall. “But see here,” his knobby finger tapped one rune. “This says ‘fire,’ I’m sure of it. And look there, and there, and here. It’s repeated, see?”</p>
                  <p>“Fire, fire, everywhere,” Korakai chuckled nervously. His robes and feathers fluttered in the faint breeze that always surrounded him. He tapped the butt of his elaborate staff on the floor. The oracle’s fidgeting made noise incessantly. “What do you think it means, Seoni?”</p>
                  <p>“That is why we have the professor,” she said simply, shrugging.</p>
                  <p>If the old man, Enigma Rodos, heard her, he was too preoccupied to respond. Muttering, hands touching each symbol reverently, he combed over the walls everywhere Korakai’s light illuminated them.</p>
                  <p>“He’s a funny one, isn’t he?” The oracle tapped his staff and jingled his way over to Seoni’s side. She thought he was smiling, but it was difficult for most humans to decipher a tengu’s expressions, even after several weeks together. As Korakai drew nearer, the breeze surrounding him plucked at her cloak and skirts.</p>
                  <p>“Indeed. As I told you, we did not need to bring Valeros for this part. The perils were in getting the professor here. Other than dying of boredom, I do not see any danger from these forgotten tunnels. No need to fear, Korakai.”</p>
                  <p>“If you say so, Seoni,” her companion looked left and right, <em>tap-tap-tapping </em>with the staff, which was topped by a stylized, silver eye. “Embrace life’s mysteries, yes? Even when they’re in a dark, unexplored ruin. It will be fine, you say.” He did not sound convinced.</p>
                  <p>Seoni nodded once, and the two of them watched Enigma Rodos work. After several minutes, the professor paused to deliberately pull a parchment, quill, and inkwell from the pockets of his robes.</p>
                  <p>“Do you really think it will take days?” Korakai whispered.</p>
                  <p>“Mmm.” She frowned. “Perhaps we can light a torch and leave him to it. He paid us to find this place and we have done so. We have no expertise here. Let him do…” she made a vague gesture with one tattooed arm, “whatever it is scholars do.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, yes, yes, leave this place, good,” Korakai jangled as he unshouldered his backpack and began rummaging through it. “I have one. Professor! We are going to light you a torch and head back to camp, yes? You can find it easily enough? We will be close if you need anything.”</p>
                  <p>Rodos looked up, confused and blinking, as the words slowly sank in. “Yes, that will be fine.”</p>
                  <p>“Flint and steel, here we are,” Korakai said, balancing his staff in the crook of one arm. With taloned hands he struck once, twice, three times, and a spark lit the animal fat on the end of the wooden torch.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the flame ignited, several of the runes around them flared in bright orange light. Then others, spreading out like an infection.</p>
                  <p>Or perhaps a wildfire.</p>
                  <p>Rodos gasped. “What—what did you do?”</p>
                  <p>“Fire?” Korakai laughed anxiously, waving the torch. “You must be right on that translation! Keep up the good—Aaaiiiggghhh!” He jumped back on four-toed taloned feet.</p>
                  <p>Flames filled the chamber with a great <em>WHOOOSH!</em> Rodos scrambled away on hands and knees, nearly engulfed. As Seoni watched, wide-eyed, the flames coalesced into distinct shapes, each moving independently while still part of the same conflagration. It took her a heartbeat to realize that she faced not one raging blaze, but a dozen smaller ones, each in the shape of a halfling-sized humanoid. The fiery figures prowled forward, moving like a pack of wolves.</p>
                  <p>“Professor! Away!” she barked. “Get Valeros and the others, quickly!”</p>
                  <p>Seoni dashed to one side of the tunnel, her arms weaving symbols in the air. Instinctively she plunged her consciousness inward, where a roiling mass of memories awaited her. Images and voices from experiences before her birth flooded her mind. In her childhood, this sort of bombardment threatened to overwhelm her. Now, she utilized her tattoos; for her they were not a sign of rank but instead a map, a reminder of her ancestral blood and the thousand generations of spellcasters who preceded her. Power flowed through her. Power and knowledge. And Seoni channeled it through the detailed patterns across her skin, focusing the chaos into her spells.</p>
                  <p>“Frost and ice!” she called to Korakai. “Quench the flames!” As she said the words, an orb of biting cold formed around one of the fiery figures. Steam filled the tunnel as the elemental screeched like a teakettle.</p>
                  <p>“You mean to fight?!” the oracle gasped. “But… oh, bother.”</p>
                  <p>Korakai tamped his staff to the ground and the silver eye atop it flared. Geometric sigils, triangles and circles of blue light, spun around the head of the oracle’s weapon and, as they did, his free hand swirled with liquid, azure energy. The tengu had explained to Seoni that he could glimpse the First Storm that existed before creation, when the planes were nothing more than a roiling sea of lightning, wind, and rain. It was these fleeting glimpses, he speculated, that allowed the many gods and goddesses of weather to grant him their blessings.</p>
                  <p>The oracle reached out with his tempest’s touch, the water leaping from his outstretched talon to the nearest figure. More steam and high-pitched screeching let Seoni know that Korakai’s attacks were as deadly to these creatures as her own orbs of frost.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Small arcs of lightning etched at random intervals across his robed form, and he moved to attack again. The breeze surrounding him was now a gale, buffeting Seoni’s hair and clothes. For all his fear, a true force of nature raged, barely contained, within her companion.</p>
                  <p>Their opponents breathed gouts of flame in response. The collective experience of Seoni’s ancestors guided her every movement as she raised a round shield of energy. Arcane sigils around her hands glowed blurrily in the steam. To her right, in a divine battle cry, Korakai let forth a mighty crow’s call as the tempest around him roared in response.</p>
                  <p>Seoni smiled fiercely, the light of fire dancing in her eyes.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">Now that the dust of battle has cleared and all your survey responses are in, we can examine the intel you’ve given us to help refine and perfect the <strong>commander</strong> and <strong>guardian</strong> classes. We appreciate all your feedback, and while we’re still sifting through the more detailed notes, we can give you some quick insights into some ways we’ll be moving forward.</p>
                  <p>First, Michael Sayre will talk about the commander, and then Jason Keeley will fill us in on the guardian.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>The Commander</h3>
                  <p>Michael Sayre here, talking about where we might be headed with the commander class post-playtest.</p>
                  <p>One of the big things we saw in the playtest feedback was that by and large, people were really happy with the class as it stands. When we see numbers like this, one of the takeaways is that we want to focus on polishing what we’ve got rather than taking apart something that people are already really enjoying.</p>
                  <p>With that in mind, there’s a few things I think we’re highly likely to be doing going forward.</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li><strong>Tactics:</strong> A big thing we want to do, obviously, is adding a bunch more tactics, especially in the expert, master, and legendary tiers. For the playtest, we had two tactics to choose from at each of these tiers, and we’re looking to increase that number significantly. With more tactics to choose from, we have room to expand the number of tactics the commander can have in their folio, and we can look at giving them a slight bump to the number of tactics they can have prepared. In addition to modifying the number of tactics available (both while building your commander and while playing them), we’re looking at some adjustments to the tactics themselves. In particular, making the master tactics all function on a once-per-10-minutes frequency and the legendary tactics all function at a once-per-day frequency can help make deciding when and how to deploy the various tactics in your folio a bigger part of your strategies across the day, without raising the cognitive load of play too high.</li>
                   <li><strong>Traits: </strong>The use of “banner” as both a class item and as a trait was sowing a bit of confusion, so we’re looking at replacing the banner trait with a “brandish” trait to make it a bit clearer that those abilities require you to have your banner held in hand and able to be waved about.</li>
                   <li><strong>Feats: </strong>We’re not anticipating a lot of changes here, but we’re looking at some opportunities to polish and expand some of the functionality presented in the commander’s feats. One of the possible changes we’re considering is swapping out the commander’s mount for a more versatile “mascot” pet and adding in a class-specific capstone feat for said mascot.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We know that folks really loved this class during the playtest, so hopefully this opportunity to polish and elevate it further makes it even more satisfying when the final iteration rolls out with the release of <em>Battlecry!</em> next year!</p>

                  <br>
                  <h3>The Guardian</h3>
                  <p>The majority of you felt that the concept of the guardian was worth exploring but needed a little more polish to really sing. We couldn’t agree more. Some of the class’s main features might be able to interact with one another more cleanly, and we might be able to present them in a way that shows that the guardian’s abilities are a set of tools that each have their particular uses. We’re considering some larger overhauls to ensure that the guardian is fun and exciting to play.</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li><strong>Intercept Strike:</strong> Many of you responded that needing to be adjacent to an ally to protect them could sometimes be difficult to engineer. We’re thinking about adding some mobility to this core reaction, allowing to the guardian to move a little bit before getting the in the way of the blow; after all, who doesn’t want to fling themselves at the frail wizard as an archer’s arrow flies toward their heart, dramatically screaming “Nooooo!”?</li>
                   <li><strong>Taunt:</strong> We wanted to test an extreme version of this ability so we could get your opinions, and we got them! In the current version, the bonus the target gets to attack the guardian essentially negates the advantage of their increased armor proficiency; for the less extreme revision, we’re considering focusing the ability on the penalty it confers to attacking the guardian’s allies. Whether or not this final version operates off of a saving throw or something else depends a lot on the specific implementation, so we’ll be reviewing some possible directions.</li>
                   <li><strong>Armor Specialization and Resistances:</strong> The concept of armor specialization might seem to fit the guardian very well, but that game element was designed to mesh with the abilities of other classes. After playtesting and going through the feedback, we feel it could be a little confusing that the resistance granted through Intercept Strike was different than the armor specialization resistance, so we’re looking at giving the guardian their own generalized resistances that apply in multiple situations!</li>
                   <li><strong>Feats:</strong> With the changes noted above (and some others we’re working on), some of the guardian’s feats will need a bit of reworking and recontextualizing to cohesively fit together in the final version. And, yes, I know Hampering Sweeps is too good for this world! But I’m hoping the idea of it will live on...</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Of course, there will be other tweaks that we’ll make to the class as it goes through its post-playtest revisions. We’re sure that the final guardian will be fun and exciting to play for all of you who want to portray a character who goes to great lengths to protect their allies in a fight!</p>

With the launch of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez4">Starfinder Second Edition Playtest</a> right around the corner, it won’t be long until you can dive in, build characters, and try the new classes for yourself. Still, we couldn’t resist one last, brief glimpse into the sixth class from the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em>: we’re talking, of course, about the witchwarper!</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Witchwarpers are reality-bending spellcasters whose lives are defined by a paradoxical event that forever warped their existence. Origins in an alternate reality? A trip along a parallel timeline? A quantum experiment gone awry, or a malfunctioning alien device? The Gap itself? Whatever the cause, each witchwarper’s exposure to paradoxical reality has given them tremendous magic abilities.</p>
                  <p>Beyond affecting reality with mere spellcasting, witchwarpers can create a reality-warping <strong>quantum field</strong>. In another reality (which is to say, in Starfinder First Edition, insert wink emoji here), witchwarpers had to expend spell slots to use their reality-altering infinite worlds ability. Witchwarpers had to choose between altering reality through spells, or through infinite worlds. Later, in Starfinder Enhanced, the enhanced witchwarper gained additional spell slots to use for infinite worlds.</p>
                  <p>While a witchwarper’s spellcasting and quantum field are still mechanically intertwined, we’ve taken a new approach. In Starfinder Second Edition, witchwarpers can use the <strong>Warp Reality </strong>action as often as they want. This brings their quantum field into existence, and the effects of this quantum field depend on the <strong>paradox </strong>that defines the witchwarper’s magic power. Witchwarpers gain additional abilities through their paradox (and feat selections) that allow them to manipulate or interact with their quantum field, whether by moving it, applying additional <strong>zone</strong> effects to it, or targeting creatures inside it with reality-altering powers.</p>
                  <p>Of course, warping reality requires focus. While witchwarpers can create their quantum field as often as they like, they must Sustain it if they want it to stick around. Thankfully, witchwarpers have a new option at their disposal: abilities with the <strong>anchoring</strong> trait, such as a witchwarper’s focus spells, signature spells, and certain feats, automatically sustain the quantum field in addition to any other effects they may have.</p>
                  <p>If you think you’ve heard the concept of an “anchor” somewhere in Starfinder before—you’d be correct! An anchor was an important part of the time-bending precog class from Starfinder First Edition. Precog is part of the witchwarper class now—in fact, precog is one of the paradoxes you can choose for your witchwarper character! <strong>Anchors</strong> aren’t just for precogs anymore: every witchwarper has an anchor, which is a memory, concept, or object that keeps them grounded in true reality. A witchwarper can sustain their quantum field through a special “anchoring action” granted by their anchor, granting them greater flexibility from round to round, rather than forcing them to sustain their quantum field by casting specific anchoring spells. Witchwarpers can even gain the ability to anchor their quantum field through their Strikes!</p>
                  <p>Witchwarpers have a big impact. Conjuring zones of otherworldly darkness. Infusing spells with energy from another reality, or even borrowing spells and ancestry feats from other realities. Altering the flow of time. Erasing enemies from existence. When every reality is at your disposal, the possibilities are infinite.</p>
                  <p>We’re especially keen to receive your feedback on the witchwarper class, as it’s gone through multiple different realities during the course of development. The <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">Starfinder Playtest</a> site is the place to watch for news and info about the playtest and feedback process, and we’ll have more Starfinder Second Edition news at GenCon 2024. Which is to say—quite soon!</p>

                  <h2>Starfinder Society Playtest</h2>
                  <p>This month, Jessica released the rules governing rewards for participating in the Starfinder Playtest this fall! Players will be able to earn rewards for all three active and future programs when they complete the Starfinder Playtest Scenarios and Adventures. Full details are available <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6uw6x">in the blog</a>! We hope you’re all looking forward to this playtest; we can’t wait to see it hit the table in just a few weeks.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2>
                  <h3>Errata Updates</h3>
                  <p>At the end of May, the Pathfinder design team issued a new batch of errata. We’ve finally had time to look through this and make updates to the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Character Options page</a>! Largely, this is removing some clarifications that are now enshrined in the errata, but a couple of options, like the magnetic suit from <em>Guns and Gears</em>, are now available. Enjoy!</p>
                  <h3>Free RPG Day</h3>
                  <p>We hope you all enjoyed the lovely poppet adventure at this year’s Free RPG Day! Sanctioning documents for that adventure will be posted with the product page whenever it goes live. Remember, you cannot run the adventure until <strong>July 22, 2024</strong>, as part of our agreement with Free RPG Day. After that day, release the poppets!</p>
                  <h3>Wardens of Wildwood</h3>
                  <p>Unfortunately, due to our incredibly busy summer schedule, we missed street date sanctioning for the Wardens of Wildwood Adventure Path. We’re hard at work on it now and should have it out to you soon! Rest assured that the adventure will be sanctioned, and you’ll be able to get access to all sorts of new nature-themed options for playing it as usual.</p>
                  <h3>Player Core 2</h3>
                  <p>Gen Con sees the release of <em>Player Core 2</em> and the eight newly-Remastered classes! As I write, we’re working on the guidelines for adjusting your characters based on the new classes, and we’ll do our best to get those to you as far ahead of Gen Con as possible. You can expect it to follow a similar format as the first Remaster guidelines; you’ll be able to use your old characters without updating them, or rebuild characters into the Remaster rules using your previously granted rebuild. We’ll have guidance on how to handle some trickier situations once we finish going through the rules ourselves.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Convention News</h2>
                  <h3>Gen Con</h3>
                  <p>Have I mentioned Gen Con is coming up soon? We’ve got a few last-minute holes we need to fill due to late GM drops, so if you’re going to Gen Con and want to join us as a GM for a slot or two (or seven…), contact us at <a href="mailto:genconleads@gmail.com">genconleads@gmail.com</a> and let us know your availability. We’d love to have you!</p>
                  <p>All our scenarios will take place in the Sagamore Ballroom as normal. This year, we’ve been given additional space and are now taking up the entire center third of the ballroom! We’ve got nearly 80 tables for Pathfinder, Starfinder, and board game play, along with a Character Creation Station and ancillary booth. It’ll be a ballroom jam-packed with Paizo fun!</p>
                  <h3>PaizoCon Europe</h3>
                  <p>If gaming in the garden is more your speed, why not join us for PaizoCon Europe? The event will be held August 15-18 2024 outside of Geneva, Switzerland. Come join me and the European community for four days of casual Pathfinder and Starfinder gaming on the banks of the river! More information is available in<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6uw70?Get-Ready-for-PaizoCon-Europe-2024"> last week’s blog</a>.</p>
                  <p>We’re still putting the finishing touches on the fall convention schedule, so stay tuned for more convention news soon! You can expect to see us at PAX Unplugged as well as a few other conventions in the back half of the year.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                  <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>
                  <p>This month, a new Campaign Service Coin was awarded at Origins! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and reasons.</p>
                  <p>Congratulations to:</p>
                  <p><strong>Angie Valente</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #907</p>
                  <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                  <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                  <p>This month, we had four GMs earn their 5th rank!</p>
                  <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Jim Fleury, Cordell Kintner, Mike Bramnik</p>
                  <p><strong>5th Star (PFS1)</strong>: Jason Kelly</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And stay cool out there!</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">I see it in the flickering of my monitor. I hear it in the cawing of the seagulls fighting over a bagel outside my window. I smell it in my coffee from down the street (not the coffee from up the street—the coffee from the other street, or the coffee from the corner; this is Seattle, after all). For the oracle, coming in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej5?Pathfinder-Player-Core-2"><em>Pathfinder Player Core 2</em></a>, is Remastered.</p>
                  <p>Oracles are divine spellcasters who draw their power not from prayer or devotion to a deity, but from a firsthand connection to the great mysteries of the universe. This connection is a double-edged sword, though, as gazing too deeply into these mysteries results in terrible backlash in the form of a divine curse. While this unique relationship with the divine and its “power at a price” theme offer strong and appealing roleplaying hooks that are very Golarion (what <em>is</em> the role of an oracle in a world where prophecy is lost?), the original oracle was often thought of as intimidatingly complex or as a class that made the player jump through hoops to unlock its potential. The Remastered oracle has been changed in ways both large and small to reduce its complexity and pain points, while still allowing players who want to risk fate to draw upon their curse to gain power.</p>
                  <p>The big change: instead of an oracle’s curse giving them a large suite of abilities, some of which are buffs, some of which are debuffs, and some of which might go either way, the oracle’s curse now just strictly debuffs the player. We’ve done it—no, no, no, come back; I promise this made the class stronger!</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f0feafe2-d7eb-4430-bb98-0dce123f1bb2/Korakai_FinalSacrifice_2000.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f0feafe2-d7eb-4430-bb98-0dce123f1bb2/Korakai_FinalSacrifice_2000.png" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="The iconic oracle, Korakai, fends off a giant squid with his Remastered magical power."></a>
                   <p style="font-size: 13px;">Art by Christoph Peters.</p>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>Because the classic oracle’s curses boosted some stats while lowering others, it could be unclear whether being cursed was a benefit you were trying to get ASAP or a price you had to strategically work around. In the Remaster, they’re always a price, which lets us significantly dial up the power that you get for paying it and keeps the trade-off simple to understand: “Cheat the rules of creation for power, and you get cursed.” The new oracle’s <b>cursebound trait</b> appears not on their focus spells, but instead on specific feats and other actions that have a notable advantage over similarly leveled feats, like cheating the action economy, letting you automatically learn about your target without a skill check, or other similar benefits. Each mystery grants a cursebound ability at level 1 to let them draw on this power, like Foretell Harm.</p>
                  <h3><b>Foretell Harm [free-action] — Feat 1</b></h3>
                  <p><b>Cursebound, Divine, Oracle</b><br><b>Frequency</b> Once per round<br><b>Requirements</b> Your previous action was to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that dealt damage.</p>
                  <p>Your magic echoes ominously as you glimpse injury in the target’s future. At the beginning of your target’s next turn, it takes damage equal to twice the triggering spell’s rank as a seemingly random and minor misfortune finds it. The damage and type of misfortune is of a type matching the spell; for instance, if you dealt fire damage, a flame might spontaneously ignite on them or they might burn a hand on their torch. The target is then temporarily immune to Foretell Harm for 24 hours.</p>
                  <p>However, whenever you use a cursebound ability, your <b>cursebound condition</b> increases in value. This is a unique condition that appears only in the oracle class. As your cursebound condition increases, the deleterious effects of your curse increase as well, like giving you a penalty to certain saving throws or a weakness to certain damage types. Like the classic oracle, the remastered oracle can tolerate higher and higher cursebound values as they increase in level, letting them use more cursebound abilities.</p>
                  <p>While most of these curse effects are relatively simple, we do know that a lot of oracle players enjoyed the more disruptive curse effects that could really throw variety into your battle. We’ve kept many of these as cursebound feats, like Meddling Futures (where sprits vie for control over your body) or Thousand Visions (where visions of the future grant you great perception within a short range, but overwhelm your senses beyond it), which are now selectable by any mystery. Now, oracle players who want to opt into this complexity can do so, and oracles who want more straightforward benefits can keep it simple.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Other Changes</h3>
                  <p>We’ve also made several smaller changes throughout the oracle! In no particular order:</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>We’ve made it easier to tailor your oracle's spell list to your mystery. Each mystery now grants three thematic spells to an oracle’s repertoire, and all oracles automatically gain a divine access class feature about halfway through their career that lets them expand this list further.</li>
                   <li>We’ve doubled the number of available domains for oracles who want to harness domain magic. All mysteries now grant four related domains—now your battle oracle might gain the destruction domain, or your cosmos oracle the star domain!</li>
                   <li>We’ve added dashes of ominous, portentous, delirious flavor throughout the class to really make you feel like you’re channeling otherworldly powers.</li>
                   <li>With more streamlined mysteries and curses, we had room to add a greater number of unique oracle feats, a thing that was often cited as lacking in the classic oracle. Take a look at a unique feat for ancestors or battle oracles: The Dead Walk!</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <h3><b>The Dead Walk [two-actions] — Feat 10</b></h3>
                  <p><b>Cursebound, Divine, Oracle</b><br><b>Prerequisites</b> ancestors or battle mystery</p>
                  <p>You beseech warrior spirits to come forth and aid you. Two ghostly warriors manifest within a 30-foot emanation of you and each attempt a Strike against an adjacent enemy, using your spell attack modifier, and then disappear. The warriors’ Strikes each deal 4d6 spirit damage, and the warriors can flank with one another and with you and your allies. If you are cursebound 2 when you use The Dead Walk, you instead summon three warriors, and if you are cursebound 3, you instead summon four warriors. The warriors disappear at the start of your next turn.</p>
                  <p>We’re getting close to the release of <em>Player Core 2</em>, with ancestries, archetypes, and more, so be sure to subscribe to the Rulebook line, pre-order the book, or make a note to swing by our booth at Gen Con to check things out—and keep an eye on the future for the last of our Remaster class previews!</p>

                   <li>Clarification that you cannot use lethal grenades and missiles non-lethally by just taking the standard penalties.</li>
                   <li>Many clarifications to <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>, including narrative starship combat, the enhanced Solarian, explosive danger, concentrated cloud, and how living holograms stow items.</li>
                   <li>Clarifications and changes to gear, including a 24-hour immunity clause added to timeskip crystals and attablossoms, clarification on the skipshot pistol, the radiation of abysium ammunition, degenerator weapons, robe of communalism, and if you don't like the new gear changes, the draining finisher gear boost and tech smasher archetype!</li>
                   <li>Updates to <em>Alien Archive</em>, including the requirements to wield dragon glaives.</li>
                   <li>Updates to magic, including the <em>void whispers</em> and <em>grasping branch</em> spell, <em>junk armor</em> spell, the <em>school spirit</em> spell, the hive mind connection, esotericist, and the expert artificer.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Most of these changes are minor housekeeping that shouldn't impact how most games are run but help ensure less variation across multiple tables and clarify the intent of our design. This should help make it easier for players transitioning from one group to another or who want to try out fun character options in organized play!</p>

                  <p>The city of Kintargo has a long tradition of art, even when it chafed under the oppressive rule of House Thrune. Now that its nation of Ravounel has seceded from infernal Cheliax, though, the time is nigh for the artists and performers of Kintargo to step up to the grand stage that is the Inner Sea region. While politicians maneuver complex plots and merchants work to secure new trade, it falls to a band of famous heroes fresh off a legendary adventure to bring what might be the Next Big Thing to the stage.</p>
                  <p>Surely, things will all go according to plan.</p>
                  <p>Surely, something unexpected won’t happen.</p>
                  <p>Surely, you’ll all soon be stars!</p>
                  <p>In the Curtain Call Adventure Path, your characters are asked by a famous director to aid in translating your adventures into an opera—a production that could well bring even greater fame and fortune to your group, but only if it’s done exactly right. Of course, there’s more afoot in the town of Kintargo than what’s coming soon on stage, and as the production swings into high gear, unexpected and dangerous complications are sure to make themselves known. Fear of performing on the stage will soon be the least of your worries!</p>
                  <p>Inside the <em>Curtain Call Player’s Guide</em>, you’ll find player-friendly, spoiler-free information and tips to help you make an exciting new 11th-level character perfect for the Curtain Call Adventure Path. Welcome to show business!</p>

                  <p>Of course, we can’t talk about solarians without shining the spotlight on Dae, the new iconic solarian. In fact, Dae has already had their blog debut, and you can read all about them in our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6ufzl?Meet-The-Iconics-Dae">Meet the Iconics: Dae</a> post from June. They’d appreciate it if you like, comment, and subscribe.</p>
                  <p>Solarians are solar knights who harness the powers of light and gravity to manifest powerful armaments in their quest to understand the cosmic forces of the universe.</p>
                  <p>Designing solarians for Starfinder Second Edition presented the team with an opportunity to reexamine the solarian toolset. In Starfinder First Edition, solarians had a key choice at first level when selecting whether their solar manifestation would be armor or a weapon. As the solarian leveled up, they chose stellar revelations, special powers they could use while attuned to gravitons or photons. Some powerful revelations could be used only if the solarian spent enough time building up their attunement points to become “fully attuned.” To match the mechanics to solarian beliefs about the cosmic cycle, First Edition solarians were encouraged to select an equal number of graviton and photon revelations.</p>
                  <p>With Starfinder Second Edition’s three-action economy in mind, the team took a new approach to solarians. We wanted the narrative of the Cycle to continue to match the mechanics while still offering solarians flexibility, both in their character build and in their round-by-round action economy. To that end, solarians in Second Edition don’t have to choose between armor or a weapon: from level 1, they can manifest a <strong>solar flare</strong> (ranged attack), <strong>solar nimbus</strong>(defensive reaction), and <strong>solar weapon</strong> (exactly what it sounds like—a melee attack). Each of these manifestations has a different function based on whether the solarian is graviton-attuned or photon-attuned.</p>
                  <p>So, what major choice do Second Edition solarians make at level 1? That’d be their <strong>solarian arrangement</strong>! All solarians have personal beliefs, practices, or training that cause them to gravitate (pun intended) toward a specific aspect of the Cycle, whether that’s gravitons, photons, or balance. This arrangement grants them <strong>revelations</strong>, which (like in First Edition) are special abilities that interact with the different states of attunement and, in many cases, interact with their targets’ Hit Point totals, enemy positioning, the solarian’s mobility, and so on.</p>
                  <p>Okay, so if solarians choose a solarian arrangement that focuses on gravitons, are they going to spend all their time attuned to gravitons? Doesn’t that go against the narrative of the “Cycle” and balance between stellar forces? This is where we’ve made what is possibly the biggest change to solarians: their attunement works differently now. Gone are the days of tracking attunement points: you’re either attuned to gravitons, photons, or neither. Furthermore, we’ve introduced a new type of ability: those with the <strong>cycle </strong>trait, which—you guessed it—cycle your attunement! Using a cycle ability while graviton-attuned means that you resolve that ability (applying any additional effects from being graviton-attuned), and then immediately become photon-attuned. If you want to be graviton-attuned again, you’ll need to use another cycle ability or take the Attune action, which attunes you to your favored attunement state. If you want to play a solarian who does lots of attunement swapping and has greater attunement flexibility, you’ll want the “balanced” solarian arrangement, because (among their other fun abilities) the Attune action lets you pick either graviton or photon!</p>
                  <p>This round-by-round decision-making process based on each ability’s unique attunement effects has played out quite well in both internal and public playtests, and we can’t wait for you to try it out. Players seem to enjoy the rush of cycling between graviton and photon attunement, and the “combos” they can create with a solarian’s abilities. You might not need to take the Attune action during combat at all if you’re intentional about how and when you use your cycle abilities, but if you really want to make an impact, you’ve got another exciting new type of ability: actions with the <strong>disharmony </strong>trait have a big effect, then completely end your attunement. You’ll need to spend an action to Attune again after using a disharmony ability—otherwise, you can’t manifest your solar shot, nimbus, or weapon. Then again, by that point, the battle might be over!</p>
                  <p>Okay, we’ve talked about the cool things solarians can do, but one big question we get a lot is how solarians will work as primarily melee-focused characters in an otherwise ranged-combat “meta.” We’ve mentioned their solar flare, a fun way to attack enemies at a short distance; it’s a great ability to fire off while closing the gap. Speaking of closing the gap, solarians have a plethora of options when it comes to battlefield positioning, whether that’s gaining a big speed boost or taking a more direct approach and moving enemies around with gravity powers. You might need to work a little harder than the sniper in your party when it comes to tactical positioning, but the cinematic combos you can pull off while getting into position will be a blast! If you’re worried about what might happen to your Hit Points while you’re moving in, you’ve got options there, too: <strong>Solar Shield</strong>, a level 1 feat, allows you to manifest a stellar shield that floats nearby. You’ll also likely have a decent AC and a fair number of Hit Points to rely on. Because your key attribute is Strength and the damage of your primary ranged attack (solar flare) uses Strength as well, you’ll likely be able to make room in your build for attribute boosts to Dexterity, Constitution, or both!</p>
                  <p>We’re excited to see what kinds of solarian builds you create during the playtest. In our own internal playtesting, we’ve built solarians who focus on big speed boosts to get in close and deal tons of damage, others who stay in the front lines to fight like a tank, and still others who pin enemies down as masters of battlefield control. Every solarian we’ve playtested has felt different. Most importantly, though, each of them has felt very much like a solarian.</p>
                  <p>Remember to keep an eye on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">Starfinder Playtest</a> site for more news and info about the playtest and feedback process. We’ll have lots more Starfinder Second Edition news to announce at GenCon 2024, when you’ll finally be able to purchase the Starfinder Playtest Rulebook (or download the free PDF)!</p>

                  <p>Titles are ranked by an average of units sold and revenue earned and presented in alphabetical order. Asterisks indicate titles that have been on a best-seller list previously. Because they’ve consistently topped the list, and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers lists. This will allow newer publishers or book series to get more attention. Thanks, all!</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">Thorny points menaced Jirelle from all directions. Her buckler and dagger turned them away for what felt like the hundredth time in half as many steps. Sadly, these were <em>not</em> enemy blades, which she would have preferred by far. Those she could beat, parry, catch, disarm, and finally answer with her own winning thrusts. Not so these hanging, coiling vines and branches. So lazy, yet so stubborn! Where was the energy, the impassioned back-and-forth between skilled players? This wasn’t daring play, but pure <em>drudgery</em>.</p>
                  <p>Of course, even if the trees did rise to the challenge, she was hardly prepared to meet them in a duel. Not an impressive one, at any rate. A swordless lunge lacked a certain something.</p>
                  <p><em>Blasted belaborin’</em><span lang="EN">, an old shipmate might’ve said. <em>Damnable detour!</em></span></p>
                  <p>With those thoughts, she gave the thicket a moment of undeserved, unrequired mercy and turned on her companion instead. The rebuke she’d swallowed several times over finally made its escape. “You realize I may never forgive you for this?” she said, only half-joking.</p>
                  <p>Sajan was probably less penetrable than the jungle. The monk appeared indifferent to the grabbing flora and buzzing flies. Not even the yellow paint on his shaved head ran in the humidity. Still, Jirelle’s comment managed to hoist his brow a bit.</p>
                  <p><span lang="EN">“Charging inland was not <em>my</em> idea,” he reminded her.</span></p>
                  <p>No, <em>his</em> idea had been to make peace with their losses. Adapt and carry on while the impertinent thieves carried <em>off</em> their shiny treasures. By the time he’d relented and joined in the pursuit, the criminals had a fair head start. The aiuvarin swashbuckler and qi-fueled monk rivaled one another in swiftness, but not even they could chase a winged quarry up waterfalls. Hence their current climb through choking roots and broadleaves.</p>
                  <p>But before all that… well, yes. Maybe if she had taken Sajan’s advice to ignore them, the creatures swarming the riverboat like seagulls might have, in fact, lost interest. Instead, she became defensive when the nosy things started hopping and flapping around the party’s gear. Sajan had retained his characteristic focus, gently accusing Jirelle of attaching too much importance to her possessions. It was possible he had a point. In trying to drive the thieves away, she had only fanned their interest. Curious picking and prodding became bold, giggling pilfery. Jirelle could appreciate a bit of provocative showmanship… when <em>she</em> was the one onstage. The role of an inactive audience didn’t suit her, let alone that of a helpless victim.</p>
                  <p>“Well, it’s clear I value <em>my</em> sword more than you value yours,” she sniffed before pressing on.</p>
                  <p>“Possibly,” he said as he padded quietly behind her. “Although you shouldn’t mistake my calm for indifference. I <em>do</em> feel frustration; I just deny it control. In time it diminishes, like an unfed fire.”</p>
                  <p>“Then I’m merely… feeding… my frustration?” Jirelle gasped, wrestling with the green creepers. They clung to her ankles and threaded through her slashed sleeves. Surely, she’d stumbled into an actual snakes’ nest! Thank the Lucky Drunk she’d left her cape behind.</p>
                  <p>“Which do you value greater?” the monk continued, arms relaxed behind him as if this were a beachside stroll. “Your favorite sword or the commission that awaits us?”</p>
                  <p>“Rather difficult to protect that nervous venture-captain without our weapons.” Jirelle paused before a particularly solid knot of branches blocking their way. She sighed. “Or to cut through these bloody tangles.”</p>
                  <p>“Hmm,” Sajan purred through a ghost of a grin. Clearly, he sensed another opportunity to impart some sage wisdom—or what his companions had taken to calling “Sajan advice.”</p>
                  <p>Jirelle decided to head off another lecture. “I suppose you want to move <em>with</em> the forest rather than against it. Glide across the top, perhaps?” That couldn’t be too terribly dissimilar to a masts-and-rigging balancing act, come to think of it. Climbing aloft might not be a bad idea.</p>
                  <p>Sajan considered this, too, then surprised her by shaking his head and stepping up to the natural barrier. She motioned for him to be her guest. He planted his feet in a wide, low stance and cupped his fingers like claws. His breath went in and out with a blur of motion too fast to follow. Sharp cracks rang in Jirelle’s ears, but only after the twisting arms of wood exploded away, splinters flying. Soon the debris settled; the path was clear. The monk turned and offered a bow, meaning both <em>you’re welcome</em> and <em>after you</em>.</p>
                  <p>Jirelle smirked at the showiness, but he couldn’t fool her. Swagger was <em>her </em>style, not his. His approach was direct, practical, and purposeful… not to mention effective. Clearly losing a favored weapon hadn’t hindered him to the extent it had her.</p>
                  <p>“Why don’t <em>you</em> go first?” she said with strained sweetness.</p>
                  <p>“Again, this particular detour was not <em>my</em> idea.”</p>
                  <p>“So it wasn’t. Then when we find our swords, I suppose you won’t be claiming yours?”</p>
                  <p>There was that hint of a smile. “Touché, madam.”</p>
                  <p>Jirelle laughed.</p>
                  <p>Soon they breached the worst of it and hastened their pace. A gap in the foliage and the undergrowth exposed dewy sky, and the jungle noise gave way to a low, distant rumble. They had returned to the river above the cataracts, which they’d overshot. This was only a small tributary to their vessel’s waterway.</p>
                  <p>“Must drop off ‘round the bend there,” Jirelle said, pointing left along a rocky bank. She searched right. The river wandered down from a purple fog of mountains. The landscape was peaceful, still, undisturbed. She doubted the thieves had fled any further inland, but they were nowhere to be seen. Might they have doubled back to the main river, followed it back to sea? That made sense. All while Sajan and she stumbled through the forest.</p>
                  <p><em>Blasted belaborin’!</em></p>
                  <p>A strange, spicy odor tickled her nostrils then, tempting a sneeze.</p>
                  <p>“Oh dear,” she heard her companion say, and found him staring almost sheepishly at his open hands, slick with something moist. A little apprehensively, Jirelle sniffed her own and recoiled quickly, eyes watering. Even her buckler wafted a hot stink.</p>
                  <p>“Monkey tree oil!” she gagged. “Must’ve run afoul of it back there. Better wash it off before it draws every predator in half a league.”</p>
                  <p>Sajan chuckled, apparently impressed that the forest had fought back.</p>
                  <p>The river’s current wasn’t too strong or deep and the water not at all cold, but its bed was slippery with moss and stones. They picked their way to the middle to give any oil on their feet a good rinsing. Then they scrubbed their forearms. Jirelle was just about to suggest they immerse themselves completely, for good measure, when a wet sound reached her over the rumbling downstream, a splashing that hadn’t come from them. Sajan went alert, too.</p>
                  <p>They realized they now had a better view around the bend. White spray indicated the tributary’s drop-off, but it was split by a wedge of moss-blanketed boulders. The sound had come from the tiny creatures crowding that wedge. They leaped into it from the water like flying fish bouncing off a ship’s hull, then flapped around like yellow bats, only to dive and start the process over again.</p>
                  <p>Jirelle and Sajan had found the thieves!</p>
                  <p>“Why are they acting like that?” the monk wondered softly.</p>
                  <p>These annoying, aquatic, fin-headed gremlins usually kept to the sea and the coast, but Jirelle assumed they’d been drawn in by the riverboat. Now the bright green, almost glowing boulders distracted them. <em>Why</em> didn’t interest her, because there were their weapons, her rapier and the monk’s temple sword, momentarily forgotten among the rocks.</p>
                  <p>Sajan must have sensed her coiling like a spring. “Remember what happened last time.”</p>
                  <p>“I know. If they think I want it…”</p>
                  <p>“Yes. And we’re too exposed here. Too slow. Better to slip around.”</p>
                  <p>He began to do just that, then looked back with an expectant stare. <em>Are you coming?</em></p>
                  <p>There came a sickening metallic scratch. Downstream, Jirelle’s rapier was slipping, soon to fall into the spray and probably down the falls. Sajan’s expression was one of pity, but she felt her own resolve form into a confident smile. She decided her companion had had the right idea before when he cut through the trees.</p>
                  <p>The direct approach.</p>
                  <p>Her first few strides were indeed slow. Grounded. But soon she picked up speed and momentum, feeling lighter and lighter. Her feet touched shallower and shallower, recovering faster and faster, until they were completely free of the water, slapping the surface rapidly as she raced across it.</p>
                  <p>Sajan’s strangled grunt of surprise was extremely gratifying.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Jirelle bent forward, focused only on reaching her property before it disappeared or the gremlins grabbed it again. A timely somersault carried her off the water and over her sword; her hand closed inside the guard. Landing gracefully on the wedge of boulders, she flourished the blade with an extravagant bow of her own.</p>
                  <p>Sajan nodded back, his head tilting only slightly toward her: <em>Impressive!</em></p>
                  <p>Satisfied, Jirelle figured it was high time they rejoined their riverboat party. If that venture-captain’s fear of vengeful Aspis agents proved warranted, it wouldn’t do to miss out on the fun—<em>or</em> the commission.</p>
                  <p>There was no need to menace the gremlins, whose strange fascination with the boulders broke under Jirelle’s demonstration. They scattered and dove down the cascading steps of the falls. Jirelle wished them good riddance and stooped to recover the monk’s sickle blade from the rocks—which moved.</p>
                  <p>She froze. Looking closer, she realized the moss under her feet wasn’t just moss, but a scaly hide lit like a lantern from within. The heavy weight underneath shifted again, then began to rise. A long neck emerged, dripping from the stream. A face like a horse’s skull turned to inspect its passenger, sharp teeth flared hungrily</p>
                  <p>Jirelle’s dismount was far less graceful. She backpedaled upstream, kicking big splashes this time, until Sajan was by her side again. The river monster, even larger than it had seemed, greeted them with a crocodilian hiss. It lashed its tail and gave off a stronger greenish glow than before. Jirelle was glad they had their weapons back, though she had the horrible notion she was about to understand those gremlins’ dangerous enthrallment.</p>
                  <p>Damnable detour!</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Keskodai’s adventures and beliefs had a profound impact on the larval Chk Chk. As a child, the aesthetics and rituals of Pharasma’s faith awed him. As he grew older, he practiced his father’s faith but felt a restless yearning for something different (ironically, Chk Chk’s questioning mirrored his father’s adolescent rebellion many years ago). As Chk Chk stood on the cusp of self-discovery, the universe provided a brutal catalyst that would change his life forever.</p>
                  <p>When Aucturn exploded, every telepath under the Fullbright** sun suddenly lost control of their psychic projections. Every intrusive thought, destructive impulse, and damning secret became public as a mysterious psychic contagion spread. Chk Chk was sipping a cappuccino and shopping at the local market when he heard the screams. People all around him–some of them friends and neighbors–were screaming and venting their psychic stress or fighting each other with fists and makeshift weapons.</p>
                  <p>Panicked, Chk Chk began a prayer to the Lady of Graves but couldn’t recall the sacred words. Keskodai burst into the shop and Chk Chk felt the psychic whiplash of doubt and fear pouring from his father’s spirit. He felt Keskodai remember the pain of believing he’d lost his only child in the crash-landing long ago mixed with his current dread at seeing their neighbors wracked by fear and pain. Instead of resisting the intense feelings, Chk Chk embraced the emotional hemorrhage. As the pain washed over him, he mentally composed a poem. When someone tore the shop’s roof off, the harsh sun brought Chk Chk’s shadow into harsh relief. His shadow changed and spread, growing into tendrils that protected him and his father from the glaring sun. Chk Chk spoke another stanza, and soothing shadowy arms wrapped around his panicking neighbors. Thanks to Chk Chk’s unconventional prayer, the chaos calmed as quickly as it began.</p>
                  <p>That’s when Chk Chk realized there’s more to the soul’s journey than life and death. Destruction and creation, pain and healing, light and shadow–these dichotomies exist in every spirit. Chk Chk stayed up night after night studying philosophy, listening to music, and writing poetry in his sacred journal, driven to compose a pure expression of the beauty of contradicting unity.</p>
                  <p>Chk Chk broke his social isolation to join a group of artists he met at a nonstop café in Takoris. At first, Chk Chk got a job as a barista so he could attend the meetings without attracting attention. As he improved his skills at writing dark poetry and brewing dark roast (both topped with colorful sprinkles), Chk Chk gradually became the spiritual glue holding the group of misfit artists together. One night during a midnight jam, the group had a religious experience, feeling a surge of bliss as Zon-Shelyn Embraced them and their work. Zon-Shelyn called on Chk Chk to become their minister by nurturing creativity and creating a safe space for artists to gather. The tiny cafe was consecrated as one of Zon-Shelyn’s first temples (they still serve coffee), but Chk Chk was inspired by the idea of ministering in a new place, feeling the same wanderlust as his father before him.</p>
                  <p>With his father’s letter of recommendation in one hand and his poetry journal in the other, Chk Chk got an internship with the Starfinder Society at the busy Lorespire Complex. Being on Absalom Station expanded his social horizons, too. He found a new coffee shop to sling beans at, quickly meeting others who felt the Embrace of Zon-Shelyn. He learned how to use a painglaive from a sculptor who creates impressive wood carvings with the weapon.</p>
                  <p>Chk Chk met his best friend Dae at a pop-up dance party in the Vesk Quarter. The pair bonded the first time they met. Dae’s performance inspired Chk Chk to write a poem***. The poem didn’t do the dance justice, so Chk Chk tore the page from his notebook and threw it away, but Dae found the discarded poem, read it, and confronted its moody author. Now Chk Chk always wears the friendship bracelet Dae gave him. Since meeting Dae, Chk Chk’s opened up about sharing his art with others—you can read part of one of his poems below!</p>
                  <p><br>
                   *Chk Chk only lets members of his mystic bond call him Chkoresk, and usually prefers Chk Chk. After all, Chkoresk is the full name his family used when discussing serious or unpleasant matters.<br><br>
                   **Fullbright is the scorching, rural desert region of the tidally locked planet Verces. Chk Chk’s family lives in a shaded encampment in Fullbright.</p>
                  <p>***The following is a part of the poem Chk Chk wrote after dancing with Dae.</p>
                  <p><em>A prismatic kaleidoscope burns the shadow patchwork wrapped around my heart.</em></p>
                  <p><em>We are dancing lights that shine within a cold and empty void, eternal.</em></p>
                  <p><em>Will your searing brilliance chase away my shadows?</em></p>
                  <p><em>Or will your light be eclipsed by my spirit’s umbral shroud?</em></p>
                  <p><em>Your warm silhouette reaches for my neck,</em></p>
                  <p><em>Only to wipe away my bloody tears.</em></p>

                    Each year, the United States celebrates LGBTQ+ Pride Month in June in honor of the protests that took place at the Stonewall Inn, a queer club in NYC. The first Pride was a riot, and every Pride going forward is a protest. We’re here, we’re queer, we have always existed, and we will always exist.</p>
                  <p>This year’s theme for Pride Month is “Reflect. Empower. Unite.” with a focus on coming together as a community, standing up for ourselves and each other, and learning from the trials of our predecessors. Support has always been a central pillar of queer communities, and as we face new waves of bigotry and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, lifting each other up is more important than ever.</p>
                  <p>We’ve invited LGBTQIA+ Paizo employees and contributors to share their words with us for this community blog!</p>
                  <p>Also, Paizo is proud to be participating in Seattle Pride this Sunday, June 30<sup>th</sup>! If you’re in the area, come to the parade and cheer on the Paizo kobolds in the parade!</p>

                  <p>Hi all, I’m lead editor at Paizo and a nonbinary trans man. Being queer has been part of my life for as long as I can remember, even if I didn’t have words for it when I was young. As time has gone on, being queer exposed me to the world of social justice and activism, and I am a firm believer that no one is free until we all are free. Queer people are actively under attack in our current political climate. This is why it’s so important to me to center queer experiences in my work. At Paizo, we have the opportunity to spread awareness of queer identities to a large number of people, as well as making queer people feel seen in our books. So Paizo will continue to be queer as heck, and I’m proud to be part of that.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Basil Wright (he/they/xe)</h3>
                  <p>I know that the fight for equality, freedom, and safety by my Indigenous community in the States is being echoed elsewhere, whether it's in Palestine, the Congo, Sudan, or in the United States of America. As Juneteenth goes by, I am reminded about the power of community, of the strength of those who stand beside you and uplift you and work towards a common cause. We are all stronger together. More often than not, I have found community with Indigenous creators, with Black creators, with queer creators (and many of us holding all these identities together, such as myself). I want to continue to create games and stories that highlight the importance of community, of belonging, of togetherness. We are better, together.</p>
                  <p>If you'd like to support my work, two of my games best exemplify the theme of community: Mouseia and Well Wishers, which you can find on my Itch.io page (<a href="https://kobanya.itch.io/">https://kobanya.itch.io</a>). I also have a Ko-Fi (<a href="http://ko-fi.com/kobanya">ko-fi.com/kobanya</a>).</p>

                  <p>In honor of reflecting over this past year, in 2023 I wrote that it gave me strength/I was jealous that my World of Darkness character was doing multi-gender polyamory better than me. This year I am happy to report that we are now equals! I would like to give a very special thanks to my partners for giving me their love and their time whenever able.<br><br>
                   Looking at the year ahead, you will be able find my upcoming work as developer for the Welcome to Night Vale RPG by Renegade Game Studios. Things are about to get <em>weird</em>.</p>

                  <p>I'm Caryn DiMarco (she/they) and you can find some of my recent work in books like&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Highhelm</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Howl of the Wild</em>. I'm proud to be a contributor to those books, and to a world like Golarion where LGBTQ+ stories, themes, and characters are the norm. TTRPGs have always been an escape for me, and&nbsp;seeing my identity and experiences reflected in the pages of my favorite gaming system is a comfort and a joy.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Thank you to all my fellow authors, our wonderful devs at Paizo, and the many gamers I share tables with for coming together to show that diversity is natural and equality is attainable. Our real-life magic may be the stories we tell together, and our real-life dragons look more like bills and endless to-do lists, but the possibility of a better world is not a fantasy. Sitting down to play (or run) games with my community always reminds me of the potential within every one of us.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Happy Pride, Paizo! Connie Chang here (they/he/she). I wrote Quain for the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>and a flash fiction about gay Grandmasters. Outside of Paizo, I'm the Game Master for Transplanar RPG, an all-transgender, people of color-led dark fantasy actual play channel telling stories in a noncolonial, antiorientalist multiverse. Transplanar is an ENNIE-nominated, CRIT Award-sweeping channel that has been featured in Polygon, Dicebreaker, and Gizmodo and discussed on NPR, The New York Times, and Dropout TV.</p>
                  <p>I'm thrilled to announce Transplanar's first-ever IN-STUDIO series, GODKILLER: LAST HOPE! LAST HOPE is a two-person, eight-episode show about Litany, the titular Godkiller forged for a single purpose: to slay the Immortal Emperor of Heaven—and their mother’s sister. After a monumental failure, Litany teams up with a heroic cultivator and travels across a richly layered fantasy world inspired by my diasporic Chinese heritage, learning what it means to truly become.</p>
                  <p>LAST HOPE utilizes my original holypunk duet game,&nbsp;<em>GODKILLER</em>, which is being published by Evil Hat Productions. If you're a fan of Tian Xia's Asian fantasy setting and/or queer interrogations of divinity, then tune in June 29 for the premiere of GODKILLER: LAST HOPE on Transplanar RPG's&nbsp;<a href="http://twitch.tv/transplanarrpg">Twitch</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://youtube.com/@TransplanarRPG">YouTube</a>!</p>

Not only has gaming been an activity I shared with my gay friends and even my now husband, but living outside gender and relationship norms has been a common experience connecting me to many fellow game designers.</p>

                  <p>Pride is a protest. All love is valid. Nothing I expose here can come close to supplanting these powerful words, but in the past year I’ve felt such a deep connection to these two ideas as I’ve grown to learn more about what I am and what it means to be a part of both the LGBT+ and Paizo community. You must learn to love yourself before you can properly love another. And that means being proud of yourself and your accomplishments, even though it feels like you are fighting a voice deep inside you that hates you for what you are. All love is a valid form of protest. And learning to love yourself despite what the world’s hate has planted deep inside is the ultimate act of defiance, and one I have only been empowered to face thanks to the unity of this incredible community.</p>
                  <p>Proud to Love Myself.</p>

                  <p>Hello! My name is James Beck, I am a freelancer whose work you'll primarily find over on Pathfinder Infinite, where I have several Infinite Masters titles with Eldritch Osiris Games. One thing that I absolutely love about Golarion/the Pact Worlds is how much I can see myself in it. I love seeing fellow LGBTQ+ people that populate the world! I've been out and proud about my identity since 7th grade and one of the big draws of Pathfinder/Starfinder has always been how welcoming it is to me. Not only have the universes of Paizo been welcoming but so has the Paizo community, from fellow freelancers to Paizo staff and the broader community at large. I wish everyone across the world a happy&nbsp;pride! Be yourself!</p>

                  <p>The previous 12 months since last year’s&nbsp;Pride&nbsp;blog have been busy as we’ve navigated the frenzied switchover of Pathfinder from OGL content to the Remastered rules. That’s mostly all behind us now from an in-house production standpoint, and it’s a relief to be back on track exploring brand new stories. One of those tales I’m really delighted to see hit the shelves, though, isn’t an adventure or even a game. I’m talking about Liane Merciel’s upcoming novel,&nbsp;<em>Godsrain</em>. It’s the first novel Paizo’s published in a long time, and it’s helping to kick off the War of Immortals plotline, but the part I’m delighted most by is that my favorite iconic Merisiel and her wife Kyra are front and center to the plot. Bisexual representation is something I’ve been passionate about since the start of Pathfinder, with Merisiel being my chosen heroine for this quest. I can’t wait for you all to see what adventures she and the others up to while they’re also saving the world!</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Katina Davis (she/her)</h3>
                  <p>Representation is important year-round, but during Pride month I feel especially compelled to step forth from the shadows like a bisexual vampire to celebrate queer stories. I don’t always feel qualified to speak on queer topics because I’m married to a man and could easily be mistaken for straight. Then I remember how I once felt under-represented and less sure of my identity, and how isolating that can be. It’s taken me years to understand myself enough to find peace and joy in who I am. If I can reflect that queer joy back to even one person who might feel lonely and confused, that’s worth it to me. Just imagine the power of entire communities full of that energy!</p>
                  <p>My years working and freelancing for Paizo have been instrumental to my queer identity because they’ve introduced me to a diverse and supportive group of people that I’m incredibly grateful for. It makes sense given that we’re all tied by our love of a cooperative game—this community is one big adventuring party. We roll initiative together.</p>

                  <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3>
                  <p>Hello, all! I'm Kendra, frequent Paizo contributor. You might have spotted my name most recently on <em>Howl of the Wild</em> and <em>Treasure Vault</em>. I've also got two Adventure Path volumes coming up that I'm excited to see hit people's tables: <em>Singer, Stalker, Skinsaw Man</em> for Curtain Call and <em>Destroyer's Doom </em>for Triumph of the Tusk. Part of what helped encourage me to be open about being queer was seeing others in the TTRPG community do the same, especially those whose identities more easily fly under the radar. "Unite" is the last part of the blog theme for this year, and every time I see (or write!) a queer NPC in an adventure or lore book, it gives me a sense of belonging. We're here, we're not going away, and as in any good adventuring party, it's important to have each other’s backs. Happy&nbsp;Pride!</p>

                  <p>My name is Kyle Raes (he/him, she/her) and I’m pansexual and bigender. I’ve been contributing on and off again to Pathfinder for years alongside maintaining my daily blog that analyzes the various options available to characters in both Pathfinder and Starfinder.</p>
                  <p>It was seeing the sort of community that Paizo has attracted through these games that actually helped afford me the self-reflection to realize my own preferences and identity.</p>
                  <p>This community, both the players and even the writers and other staff at Paizo stayed true to themselves even with pressures out there trying to deny them that, and for that I am forever grateful, rocky times and all.</p>
                  <p>Right now, I’m between major projects, but I just this past month published my first submission on Starfinder Infinite!</p>
                  <p><em>Elemental Experts</em> is a book with five archetypes for Starfinder giving both casters and non-spellcasting classes a way to go all in and specialize in a particular damage type as masters of that element! The book has all commissioned art by absolutely brilliant artists!</p>

                  <h3>Lynne M. Meyer (she/they)</h3>
                  <p>It’s impossible to talk about my queerness without talking about games, because they’ve been interwoven from the outset. I was introduced to TTRPGs by an actor friend (now spouse) who’s been playing and running games since the 1980s. Sure I’d love it, he invited me to join his upcoming campaign. I was hooked almost immediately.</p>
                  <p>I was&nbsp;<em>also</em>starting to come out to myself around this time.</p>
                  <p>All the characters I’ve played have explored queerness in some fashion. As I say in Thom James Carter’s book&nbsp;<em>They Came to Slay: The Queer Culture of D&amp;D</em>, games—specifically, inclusive games with good queer rep—gave me a safe space to figure myself out and unpack years of comphet.</p>
                  <p>Icon Marsha P. Johnson said, “No pride for some of us without liberation for all of us.” This month, I’m part of&nbsp;<a href="https://itch.io/b/2506/queer-games-bundle-2024-with-10-option">Queer Games Bundle 2024</a>—a bundle of nearly 500 games, software, and zines from 271 queer creators across itch.io. The organizers put it best: this bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way, and help nurture the diverse queer games community.</p>

                  <h3>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe), Marketing &amp; Media Specialist</h3>
                  <p>It’s me, your friendly local nonbinary circus goth! Over the last fifteen years, I’ve cycled through a variety of labels—nonbinary lesbian, ace lesbian, nonbinary bisexual, trans man, nonbinary trans man, the list goes on—but through all of that change, I have had the love and support of my partners, my close friends and family, and my community. Queer community is vital—in some cases, it is literal lifeblood when bigotry causes institutions to abandon us.</p>
                  <p>Love is powerful. Love in a world that tries to shame you and hide you away is a protest. And love is a fire that cannot be snuffed out.</p>
                  <p>Last year’s Pride blog was one of the first projects I took point of here at Paizo, and I’m proud and elated to have continued the tradition through our various community and culture blogs full circle back to Pride. Even “small” acts of solidarity like this give hope and voice to people who have historically been silenced.</p>

                  <p>And, for a special Pride preview, have a sneak peek at one of the items coming in <em>Player Core 2</em>: the Elixir of Gender Transformation! This item was written by Avi Kool, Lead Editor.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>Elixir of Gender Transformation Item 1+<br></em></strong><strong>Alchemical, Consumable, Elixir<br></strong><strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;held in 1 hand;&nbsp;<strong>Bulk</strong>&nbsp;L<br><strong>Activate</strong>&nbsp;[one-action] (manipulate)</p>
                  <p>This clear, bitter liquid can be ingested to change certain secondary sex characteristics. Different formulations create different changes—for example, one variety might cause the voice to deepen and promote body and facial hair growth, while another might cause fat redistribution around the hips and the growth of breasts. These changes tend to be accompanied by shifting of the fat in the face, sometimes dramatically or sometimes more subtly changing the user’s appearance. Changes from this elixir take place gradually over the course of months or years, depending on the type.</p>
                  <p><strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;lesser;&nbsp;<strong>Level</strong>&nbsp;1;&nbsp;<strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;1 gp<br>
                    The elixir must be taken every week, and changes occur over the course of a year or more.</p>
                  <p><strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;moderate;&nbsp;<strong>Level</strong>&nbsp;3;&nbsp;<strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;8 gp<br>
                    The elixir must be taken once a month, and changes occur over the course of a year.</p>
                  <p><strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;greater;&nbsp;<strong>Level</strong>&nbsp;6;&nbsp;<strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;35 gp<br>
                    The elixir must be taken once, and changes occur over the course of 6 months.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>From our tables to yours, happy Pride from Paizo!</p>

                  <p>The European Organized Play volunteers have joined together and are pleased to invite you to four days of Pathfinder and Starfinder gaming. Games will be offered in various languages, both in person in Geneva, Switzerland, and across multiple online VTTs, hopefully with something to suit everyone.</p>
                  <p>The event will feature the current season’s specials for both Pathfinder Second Edition and Starfinder:</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>PFS #6-00: Salt of the Ocean (levels 1-8)</li>
                   <li>SFS1 #6-99: The End Awakens (levels 1-4)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In addition, there will be a range of games across Pathfinder Second Edition, Pathfinder First Edition, Starfinder First Edition, and the playtest adventure for Starfinder Second Edition.</p>
                  <p>We will use two parallel events with two separate Warhorn events:</p>

                  <p>We’ve written each playtest adventure and playtest scenario to be like the adventures you’ve come to love from Paizo. They feature narratives and encounters that showcase how we can use the new Second Edition rules to create evocative stories in the Starfinder setting. These include all-new art and major setting events, and it’s our hope that these adventures remain relevant long after our playtest is over and we’re well into the new edition.</p>
                  <p>That said, these adventures are not specifically built for Organized Play. So how does Organized Play fit into all of this?</p>
                  <p>So happy you asked!</p>

Each time you play one of the Starfinder Second Edition Playtest Adventures or Starfinder Second Edition Playtest Scenarios listed on this sheet, check off the associated box. By checking off these boxes, you’ll unlock rewards in our Organized Play campaigns! Earn Achievement Points in Starfinder Society (first edition), gain access to exciting alien ancestries from the wider galaxy in Starfinder Society (first edition) and Pathfinder Society (second edition), and gain access to campaign-exclusive backgrounds themed to the events of these adventures in Starfinder Society (second edition). No need to select which rewards you want most—you get them all!</p>
                  <p>For the purpose of Starfinder Society (first edition), these adventures are considered repeatable, meaning players and GMs will earn Achievement Points every time they play or run them. Characters do not earn in-game rewards such as credits or XP for these adventures.</p>
                  <p>We hope this encourages players engaged in our Organized Play campaigns to enjoy these adventures and to participate in the Starfinder Second Edition Playtest!</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">The swashbuckler is swinging into <em>Pathfinder Player Core 2</em> with a fresh coat of paint to show off their style and swagger like never before!</p>
                  <p>Swashbucklers fight fast on their feet with flair. They dart between foes, gaining and expending panache to execute powerful and flamboyant finishers. When a swashbuckler hits their stride and lands their rolls, they create wonderful, memorable moments on the battlefield. However, this could be difficult to do consistently based on the encounter. In some low-threat encounters, swashbucklers easily dance around the battlefield, able to gain and use panache freely, but in severe and extreme fights, they often struggled to gain panache and use their class abilities. Additionally, many swashbucklers heavily relied on Tumble Through as their primary way to obtain panache, which led to less satisfying uses of Tumble Through instead of an exciting way to move dynamically around the battlefield.</p>
                  <p>Our primary aim with the swashbuckler’s remaster was therefore to increase the consistency of the class to allow for more stylish moments.</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f026ad28-d05f-4db2-aea1-8b4c0945444a/PZO90193_AdventureOpener_1500x2000.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f026ad28-d05f-4db2-aea1-8b4c0945444a/PZO90193_AdventureOpener_1500x2000.png" width="500px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Jirelle, the iconic swashbuckler, fights an angry dwarf.

                  <br>
                  <p>One way we’ve done this is through the new bravado trait, which you’ll see in several places in the class. Bravado is not only a bit more reliable for getting into panache, but the trait also lets us give more actions the ability to grant panache, allowing for more diverse options in combat. For instance, many of your swashbuckler styles might state that certain actions gain the bravado trait.</p>
                  <p><strong>Bravado:</strong> Actions with this trait can grant panache, depending on the result of the check involved. If you succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain panache, and if you fail (but not critically fail) the check, you gain panache but only until the end of your next turn. These effects can be applied even if the action had no other effect due to a failure or a creature's immunity.</p>
                  <p>Not all swashbucklers fight with honor, though. We’re introducing the new <strong>rascal</strong> swashbuckler style in the remaster! Rascals aren’t afraid to use underhanded tactics on the battlefield to show off their skills and thoroughly embarrass their foes with a Dirty Trick or two. They do what they need to do to gain the advantage and are happy to let their opponents drop their guard before striking fast, leaving their foes in their dust before finishing them off, perhaps with a Twirling Throw.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Twirling Throw [one-action] — Feat 4</strong></h3>
                  <p><strong>Finisher, Swashbuckler<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Flying Blade<br>
                    Your thrown weapons seem to defy physics as they soar through the air and spin back to you after a strike. Make a thrown weapon attack, ignoring the penalty for making ranged attacks within the second and third range increment. The weapon returns to your hand after the attack unless you critically failed on the attack roll.</p>
                  <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej5">Pathfinder Player Core 2</a></em> is full of exciting remastered ancestries, classes, spells, and more to allow you to truly make the most of your games. Look forward to more previews of other remastered classes in the near future!</p>

                  <p>The enigmatic being known simply as the Thane, one of the more powerful denizens of the First World, on rare occasions grows weary of solitude and holds a grand party. Invitations are scattered throughout the planes, and simply interacting with one in any manner will suddenly see a “guest” whisked away to the feast. Further, the Thane warps time in their realm, making each day last a decade. The celebration continues for a week of these decades. Mortals taken find themselves seventy years older with only a week having passed outside, if they even survive decades of partying.</p>
                  <p>Recently, the Thane has again become bored and sent out invitations. Some citizens of Jol unfortunate enough to have stumbled upon these were whisked away. It’s up to the PCs to free them—and likely the PCs themselves— before even more years pass in the twisted time of the Thane's realm.</p>

                  <p>A demonic cult recently performed a ritual to great success, part of its leader's greater schemes. Her work near Nerosyan complete for now, she left a token force to guard the site, no longer needing it, and prepared to travel elsewhere for grander plans. This activity, though, has been noticed. The ritual site was supposed to be completely abandoned, but a group of traveling merchants became aware of the strange activity. This was reported to the Nerosyan leadership, who in turn have pressured Venture-Captain Jorsal of Lauterbury to get involved. Jorsal has decided to send the PCs to investigate the site itself, assuming that a place so near the city likely isn’t much of a threat.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">When Quinn needed to work, he liked to get out. It was amazing what a walk, a chat with a neighbor, or a fresh environment would do to dislodge stray thoughts or connect fresh insights. Of course, that wasn’t the only reason Quinn found himself at his usual corner at Amberlight, his table covered in ledgers, timetables, and a map of the city. The Merrymead Menace had struck again. There were only a few more days until the festival, and the thief was taking it upon themself to rob a different restaurant or inn every night.</p>
                  <p><em>Not that they’d bother hitting here</em>, Quinn thought. <em>Target pattern: establishments with occupancy over one-hundred-twenty-five guests, catering primarily to out-of-town clientele</em>. The exact opposite of this cozy cafe. The Merrymead Menace was clearly looking to separate some wealthy tourists from their valuables, then blend back into a crowd. If it weren’t for their seemingly impossible scale of activity and a certain flair for the dramatic—last night’s inn had seen every single safe box emptied, jewelry and gold and letters of banking replaced by a single dull copper coin in each—they’d would hardly stand out against the lost purses that inevitably happened around the winter holiday’s raucous pub crawls and outdoor parties.</p>
                  <p>With one last look around the room for his favorite barista—<em>Odd... New scent in the air.</em>—Quinn turned back to his work, tapping his pen against the alchemical flask sitting on the table in the hope the damn thing would change colors. No luck. He scratched another region off the map. <em>Not from the Looms, either, then. </em> While Quinn appreciated knowing he wouldn’t have to spend the rest of the day canvassing up and down the clothing district’s notorious hills, he’d have preferred to know where <em>to</em> look, rather than where not to. A bit of flattery and a fresh lemon cake from the local bakery had bought Quinn a favor with the local constabulary’s evidence department, but he’d been able to borrow only enough of the mud collected from a windowsill to run one more test. Quinn furrowed his brow as he shook another vial.</p>
                  <p><em>He always</em> was <em>better at this sort of thing.</em> Quinn split his thoughts, setting the majority of his mind on the notes in front of him. But with one part, Quinn drifted to the past. He’d met Arlo right when he’d been getting his start as a freelance detective. He’d needed a consult on the case of the vanishing coins, and several recommendations had pointed him in direction of a talented forensic chemist. Frankly, Quinn had disliked the man when they first met, with his adherence to protocol, but he’d identified the solvent used in the case with nothing more than a cursory glance, so Quinn resolved to work together.</p>
                  <p>Time and shared ambitions have a way of bridging the gaps between even the most different people. Waiting for lab work or a long stakeout left plenty of time to talk. Talks of the theater turned into a date to see <em>Echoes of Everfall</em>; talks of the virtues of Taldan white wines compared to Chelaxian reds flowed into a weekend getaway to the vineyards of Carpenden. Talks of a longer partnership turned naturally into a marriage, and for a time, everything was perfect.</p>
                  <p>But time can separate two ambitious people when their aims begin to diverge. First it was a canceled dinner here or there, spurred on by a breakthrough in a case (both men understood that you had to strike when a breakthrough came). Then it was a few weeks’ deployment to investigate this village or that town. When they did talk, it was less and less of theater or wine, more and more of work. By the time Arlo was scouted by the Qadira division of the Society of the Scales and Quinn had received that offer in Andoran, there wasn’t any doubt that it was a parting. They were two brilliant detectives at the height of their careers—they could deduce how things were going to end.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>A footstep to Quinn’s left, intentionally loud enough to be audible but not so much to be alarming, pulled him back to the present. Without turning his eyes from his notes, Quinn smiled as he moved his hand to clear a spot on the table. “Quinn, you know the only person I let do alchemy in my establishment is the chef.” Rhys placed a cup of (unordered) coffee on the table. “I can’t be making exceptions, even for my favorite customer.”</p>
                  <p>Quinn hastily noted the color in the vial before moving it back to his bag. “They have me on the case of the Merrymead Menace,” the investigator said as he attempted to piece together some numbers in a ledger before he became too distracted. Rhys nodded. “This residue narrows the culprit down to either the riverbanks, central square, or old ironworkers’ quarters, but there’s too many establishments to cover.”</p>
                  <p>“Maybe you could investigate during the festival?”</p>
                  <p>Quinn shook his head. He tried to keep business and pleasure as separate as possible, these days—and turned to Rhys. “By that time, the culprit—"</p>
                  <p><em>Apron steamed two days earlier than normal. Fresh haircut. That same floral scent.</em></p>
                  <p>“Roses.” Quinn didn’t need to look behind the man’s back to notice the bouquet. “You’re going all out decorating this year, aren’t you?”</p>
                  <p>Rhys coughed a bit, taking the bouquet out from behind his back. “I… thought they’d look nice along the bar?”</p>
                  <p><em>Slight flush. Eyes turning to door. A charming vocal hitch.</em> “Or maybe they’re for a gentleman you’re planning on asking to a Merrymead party?”</p>
                  <p>Rhys laughed, and the sound warmed the cafe. “Really, Quinn, nothing gets past you. I enjoy the big night out with the group as much as the next guy, but I was thinking a quieter festival for two might be nice this year.”</p>
                  <p>Quinn agreed—he was about the same age as Rhys, and by now a quieter Merrymead for two sounded nicer than a loud party. Two people enjoying a walk along the river, two cups of spiced wine, two… Quinn bolted to his feet. “Say that again.”</p>
                  <p>Rhys stood up, smoothing out his apron and running a hand through his hair, tightening his grip on the bouquet slightly enough that even Quinn’s finely honed senses didn’t notice. “I was saying a quiet festival for two might—"</p>
                  <p>But Quinn was already shoveling his notes into his bag. “Exactly! For two—two of them! That’s how they’re covering that much space. Identical build, height, weight as well—it’s the Extrina Twins back in town, I’m sure of it!” He dashed for the door “Perfect! Absolutely perfect! Thank you!”</p>
                  <p>It was only when the chill of winter’s air touched Quinn’s face that something clicked in his mind, something obvious that he should say. He opened the door again, locking eyes with the barista.</p>
                  <p>“Good luck on your date!”</p>
                  <p>Rhys sighed to himself as the master investigator’s coat swept out into the streets. “Really, Quinn, nothing gets past you.”</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">I’ve known Gorum longer than anyone else. Although he’s changed and developed in ways I never considered, he was created for my homebrew setting back in the very early 90s, as I was rounding out my campaign setting in preparation for a big campaign I was going to run for several friends in my college dorm.</p>
                  <p>He wasn’t the first, second, or third divinity I created for my setting (those honors go, in order, to Yamasoth, Treerazer, and Desna), but he was part of the larger group of two-dozen or so gods I invented once the world-building bug bit me. I wanted a deity in my setting who was someone like Crom, someone non-clerics like Conan could pray to or curse to before, during, and after a fight. Unlike Crom and Conan, though, I wanted this god of war to be fully armored and armed in iron and steel. And so the idea of a god who presents as an animated suit of armor was born into my setting.</p>
                  <p>When it came time to build Golarion, we were very pressed for time. We had to simultaneously close out the magazines and then jump right into producing our own RPG content without skipping a month, due to the realities of the subscription-based promises and methods Paizo had been built on. It’s very difficult to build an adventure in a world without proper nouns. You can make that up as you go, but that runs the risk of rushing an important job. So as I was put in charge of the Pathfinder Adventure Path line, I made the decision to draw from my then 15-year-old setting for much of that lore. Which included the deities.</p>
                  <p>We wanted to do 20 “core deities” from the start because it was a fun number to aim at (this being a d20 game), but also because that allowed us to create two different types of deities for each of the 9 alignments, with 2 left over to pad the numbers (one of those went to Neutral to create a “best choice” deity for druids, and one of those went to Lawful Good to create a “best choice” deity for paladins).</p>
                  <p>Gorum ended up making the jump from my homebrew at that stage into the public by being one of the two chaotic neutral deities chosen, and for the next 17 years, he would serve as Golarion’s god of war.</p>

                  <h2>Roleplaying the Grim Reaper</h2>
                  <p>When we decided it was time to shake things up in the Lost Omens setting, the death of a god made the most sense. We’d done this at the dawn of the campaign with the death of Aroden—even though his death took place a century earlier, it still was a huge part of our world’s lore. But killing off someone no one knows about is very different than killing off someone who some folks have known for 17 years (or in my case, closer to 34 years). We had a lot of discussions about which of the core 20 deities we wanted the metaphorical Grim Reaper to visit. We didn’t want to kill off an evil deity, since that would have less emotional impact, but we also didn’t want to take out a deity we had strong plans for in the future, or whose role in the setting was significantly load bearing.</p>
                  <p>In my homebrew in the early 2000s, I killed off Abadar as part of a plot where the world was slipping into entropy and the PCs had to step up to help prevent more gods from being killed, and he was thus my first nomination. But he’s also someone who’s a handy non-evil villain to have around, and beyond that, he had a role in the future in Starfinder. Other folks suggested other deities, but in the end, we all settled on Gorum. Here was a god who wasn’t evil, who was part of the core 20 but didn’t have a particularly strong role in the lore, didn’t represent a specific ancestry or character class, but who was still popular enough that his death wouldn’t feel hollow. It would still sting. It would still be noticeable. And it would absolutely change the setting—especially when we decided that the death of the god of war wasn’t going to make war go away, but instead let war run rampant.</p>

                  <h2>Witness Him!</h2>
                  <p>Unlike Aroden’s death, which was and will remain shrouded in mystery, we aren’t being coy about Gorum’s death. The specific methods by which he dies will be spelled out in print, and your PCs will be able to take part in multiple adventures impacted by the event—an event known as Godsrain, and which begins a period historians will refer to as the War of Immortals. We’ll have information about what your clerics of Gorum can do next, particularly in adventures where the event takes place after you’ve already potentially started playing clerics of Gorum. We hope the specific details of how and why will resonate with everyone in the same way they do with me and everyone on the editorial team at Paizo!</p>
                  <p>During PaizoCon last month, we revealed more details about where and when Gorum dies, as well as how you can read those details as a GM, how your PCs can take part in those details as they play out in the course of play, or how you can experience them in the form of fiction. Those who want light spoiler information about where you can find out more, read on. Those who want to be surprised about the event when it happens in your game—I’ve already said too much!</p>
                  <details>
                   <summary>SPOILERS</summary>
                   <p>Gorum’s death is described in detail in the upcoming standalone adventure, <a href="“/products/btq02eyz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Prey-for-Death”">Prey for Death</a>. Where that event takes place during the adventure, I won’t say more now, but GMs who read the adventure will find that information front and center. How much the players learn, and when that learning happens, depends on the choices they make during play, of course!</p>
                   <p>The <a href="“/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/curtaincall”">Curtain Call Adventure Path</a> will be starting in a world before these events take place, but by the end of that three-part, high-level campaign, Gorum will be dead. While the direct impact of this will be less than it was in Prey for Death, other developments rising from the event will be on full display. Again, the timing of where and when Godsrain falls during Curtain Call isn’t something we’ve revealed, but it will become obvious once the first volume (and its short summary of the campaign’s three chapters) is published.</p>
                   <p>After that, <a href="“/products/btq02oar?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals”">War of Immortals</a> presents additional information about the rules involved with these events, <a href="“/products/btq02oal?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Divine-Mysteries”">Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</a> spends some time exploring the way the gods of the setting are changing, and the novel <a href="“/products/btq02sx8?Pathfinder-Godsrain”">Godsrain</a> chronicles some in-world fiction involving some familiar iconic heroes as they experience certain developments caused by the death of Our Lord in Iron.</p>

                  <p>After these, we’re not simply going to let the topic go, of course. The Godsrain may be over, but the War of Immortals is only beginning. And while we’ll soon reveal the exact event in which Gorum dies in print for you to read, there are other new mysteries that event sets up. Mysteries we have plans for. These events—Gorum’s death and other still-unrevealed-complications that death creates—will continue affecting the Lost Omens setting from this point forward, much in the same way that the re-introduction of the runelords in the very first Pathfinder Adventure Path continues to have ripple effects, the closing of the Worldwound allows for the exploration of new stories, and the secession of Ravounel sets up brand new narratives to experience. The War of Immortals is larger in scope and scale than all of those, though, make no mistake. You’ll see the aftermath of the Godsrain play out in the <a href="“/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/triumphOfTheTusk”">Triumph of the Tusk Adventure Path</a> later this year, and it has some ripple effects that help kick things off in next year’s just-announced Spore War Adventure Path as well. Not every adventure will be focused on these events—the one after Spore War won’t, for example—but just as we’re still telling stories about runelords or the aftermath of the Worldwound or the fate of Ravounel, what goes down during the War of Immortals is here to stay.</p>
                  <p>Unlike Gorum.</p>
                  <p>But do not weep for him! Instead, maybe the next time your PC slays a dragon, defeats an evil warlord, or simply earns a new weapon or suit of armor, raise a sword in his memory.</p>

                  <p>Greetings, Pathfinders!<br>
                    The Pathfinder Society has been so busy lately, including carrying out various missions for the Waterfall as they search into her past. The last time we heard from her, she revealed her original identity to a select few Pathfinders and was ready to step forward into her future. But first, a group of senior agents must travel into her mindscape to eliminate her final connection to her captors. But a strange cloth flaps in the wind of a mysterious library, sending shivers down the spines of all who look upon it.</p>

Birds sang in the background, but the clearing was otherwise silent, except for…</p>
                  <p>“Amiri, can you please lie still,” Seelah’s voice was firm, and only a touch strained, “for just a few minutes more? Once I have finished the rite of the blade, I can heal you again, and then recite the prayer of—”</p>
                  <p>“I’m <em>fine</em>.” Amiri’s voice was laced with frustration. “You don’t need to finish any rites, and I certainly don’t want to wait for one of your endless prayers. I don’t need any more healing than you’ve already provided, Seelah. I’m ready to take on whatever else is out here.”</p>
                  <p>Seelah shook her head and continued her rite. She had already cleaned her longsword with the eleven small cloths she carried for that purpose and now needed to put it all away mindfully, treating the cloths and her sword with the honor and respect they deserved as instruments of justice.</p>
                  <p>“We don’t know that, because we don’t know what’s out here.” Seelah kept her tone even and her eyes focused on what she was doing. “Certainly, more giant ticks like that one,” she indicated the two halves of the monstrous insect that had attached itself to Amiri before the duo had cut it apart, “could have either killed the hunting party or sickened them enough they can’t make it back to the village. But they’re locals, and the villagers called these ticks a common threat; I wouldn’t expect a well-equipped party of four men and two hunting dogs to have been overwhelmed so easily.”</p>
                  <p>Amiri shrugged but managed to lie still, screwing her eyes shut to block out distractions. “All true,” Amiri said, “but no one and nothing likes ticks—especially ticks the size of badger-hounds. So, since they thrive here, these woods are unlikely to have anything tougher than them in them, or that <em>tougher thing</em> would have killed off the ticks. It’s one reason I insisted on coming and checking this hunting trail while the others waste time looking through the village records.”</p>
                  <p>Seelah tried to suppress a smile.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, and since you insisted on coming out here, someone had to come with you in case you needed backup. And as your backup, I want you fully healed before we get any deeper into the woods.” Seelah carefully placed her ritual kit next to her backpack, then laid her sword on the ground within arm’s reach. “Now, are you going to allow me to ensure you are at your best?”</p>
                  <p>Amiri took a deep breath and forced herself to relax.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, go ahead. We might as well, at this point.”</p>
                  <p>Seelah knelt next to her ally and placed her left hand over where the vile tick had dug into Amiri and begun draining her blood. “<em>Inheritor</em>,” Seelah prayed silently, “<em>please heal this mighty warrior whom I have seen face the greatest foes with valor, and ready her to stand against injustice in all its forms</em>.”</p>
                  <p>A golden light formed around Seelah’s hand and silently poured into Amiri’s remaining wounds like glowing, liquid amber. The puncture mark from the tick’s attack, already half closed from Seelah’s first effort at healing it, disappeared entirely, leaving no sign the wound had ever existed. Amiri’s eyes popped open, and she grinned at Seelah.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>“Right, now let’s get the rest of the way up the trail and—”</p>
                  <p>Seelah shook her head.</p>
                  <p>“I know I’ve already strained your patience, Amiri, but if you just wait a little longer, I can—”</p>
                  <p>“Shh!” Amiri interrupted, holding up a finger. “Listen.”</p>
                  <p>Seelah stopped talking and cocked her head to pick up whatever noise Amiri had heard. The woods were filled with susurrant shuffling, the sound of dead leaves brushing over thick grass and, farther away, bird noises that seemed more like short, concerned chirps rather than the songs they’d been singing earlier.</p>
                  <p>Seelah shook her head. “Other than some bird sounds, I don’t hear anything but the rustling of leaves.”</p>
                  <p>Amiri stood, lifting her enormous sword into a ready stance. “Yes, the leaves are rustling… but the wind has died.”</p>
                  <p>Seelah’s eyes widened in realization, and she quickly turned to strap her shield firmly to her forearm. Amiri was right, of course: the wind had stopped, but the sound of rustling leaves was growing louder and closer. Amiri leaped off the ground, already ten paces ahead by the time Seelah was standing and fully ready, but she swiftly stopped her advance, large sword held high as she peered into a dark copse of trees that seemed to be the source of the rustling. Seelah knew her eyes were not as keen as Amiri’s, and she carefully glanced around them as she closed the distance to her companion. It would not do to be caught unaware if a threat attacked from another direction.</p>
                  <p>From the dense woods to the side of the hunting trail, figures shambled toward them. Three were humanoid in shape, but moved with a slow, unsteady gait. As they stumbled into the light, their faces came into view, showing rictus grins and sagging, yellowed flesh. The arms and legs of each were twisted and curled, as if locked in awkward positions they could only barely control.</p>
                  <p>Beside the shuffling corpses, two smaller figures moved jerkily forward, crawling on all fours. Once, they had clearly been hunting dogs, but jagged wounds ran the length of one’s ribcage, and the other’s throat was missing. Both had blank, white eyes.</p>
                  <p>Amri turned to Seelah, her nose wrinkled in distaste.</p>
                  <p>“What in iron are those?!”</p>
                  <p>Seelah’s expression darkened. “Zombies. Freshly risen, from the looks of them.”</p>
                  <p>“But zombie… dogs?!” It was clear from Amiri’s tone that she felt such abominations were worse than the bipedal undead shambling along beside them.</p>
                  <p>Seelah nodded grimly. “Anything living can be perverted to undeath one way or another. This is almost certainly the missing hunting party. Whatever killed them visited this further indignity upon their corpses, an indignity I will not allow to go unche—”</p>
                  <p>Amiri bellowed a challenge, charging the nearest zombie hound. Seelah knew that cry and the expression of pure fury on Amiri’s face.</p>
                  <p>There would be no retreat in this battle.</p>
                  <p>Amiri’s charge brought her to within reach of the zombies, and a single swing of her massive sword felled one of the undead hounds. Seelah rushed to protect Amiri’s flank as the zombies clumsily surrounded her companion. Their slow movement kept the undead from overwhelming Amiri, but the remaining zombie hound bit at Amiri’s boot and tried to pull her to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Seelah hefted her shield as she reached the once-dog,. She slashed it with her own sword, watching as the blade peeled its flesh apart as easily as a canvas sail. Amiri was exchanging blows with the zombie hunters, and just as the undead hound collapsed, one of them caught her with a powerful blow to her chin. Blood flew, and Seelah whispered a hasty prayer to Iomedae to lessen the attack while ducking under Amiri’s massive sword to split the zombie’s skull with her gleaming longsword.</p>
                  <p>A fist smashed Seelah’s shield, cracking the wood and bruising her arm, but then suddenly there was only one zombie left. Seelah deflected another blow with her shield, then she and Amiri struck it as one, dropping the corpse back to the earth, skewered and sliced by the pair’s steel.</p>
                  <p>Seelah saw Amiri scanning the woods and trusted her to be alert for any danger, while the paladin ensured all the undead were truly destroyed.</p>
                  <p>“Well, ticks didn’t do that,” said Amiri.</p>
                  <p>“No,” Seelah agreed. “Whatever created these horrors is either new to the area or willing to make itself known in a way it hasn’t before. Unless it has, which is a thing that might be recorded in the village’s records.”</p>
                  <p>Amiri frowned, then nodded. “All right, so we should go back and see if the others have found anything. Right after we take whatever time you need to heal us both. But I’m going to stay standing this time.”</p>
                  <p>Seelah began unstrapping her shield, assessing the damage it had sustained during the fighting in the process. “And why is that?”</p>
                  <p>Amiri grinned grimly. “Because the villagers said four hunters went missing, and this only accounts for three.”</p>
                  <p>A cold wind blew from the woods, bringing a chill that no longer felt tied to any natural season.</p>

                  <p>Juneteenth celebrations date back to 1866—the first year following the freeing of slaves in Texas. Beginning with Texas in 1938, Juneteenth was eventually recognized as a state holiday by all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In 2021, Juneteenth National Independence Day became a federally recognized holiday in the United States.</p>
                  <p>Black communities around the United States and Mexico celebrate Juneteenth in a variety of ways, from rodeos and picnics to poetry readings, music festivals, and more. Above all, Juneteenth is a celebration of Black art, music, culture, and freedom.</p>
                  <p>To see if a Juneteenth event is happening near you and get involved, take a look at the <a href="https://www.juneteenth.com/worldwide/">Worldwide Event Listings</a> on Juneteenth.com.</p>
                  <p>If you can, donating time, money, or other resources to a Black-focused organization is a great way to celebrate Juneteenth! Here are some recommended organizations actively working to support Black communities:</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li><a href="https://www.nbcdi.org/">National Black Child Development Institute</a></li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>Take a moment today to reflect on what freedom means—and how that freedom was granted to different groups of people over time. In the words of Black feminist and activist Fannie Lou Hamer, “Nobody’s free until everybody’s free.”</p>
                  <p>In solidarity,</p>

                 <blockquote>
                  <p itemprop="description">Once, very long ago, a traveler walked a lonely road, lost and afraid. Though the path seemed to stretch on forever, they could not say where it took them, nor were they entirely certain of where they hoped it might go. All they knew was that they could not stay where they had begun.</p>
                  <p>They had set out with purpose, but the hardships they faced had worn their spirit down, leaving them weary and alone. As the night grew darker still, the traveler ruminated on the trials of the world, their own and those of others, and despair settled around their shoulders like the heaviest of mantles.</p>
                  <p>As they climbed a tall and wooded hill, each strained step slower than the last, they gradually became aware of a gentle sound: <em>shh</em>, <em>shh</em>, <em>shh</em>. The weary traveler peered ahead, unable to make out anything in the feeble starlight, and gripped their walking staff tighter in case of trouble.</p>
                  <p>A small, white butterfly ghosted across the path before them and flitted up over a fallen menhir they hadn’t yet noticed in the dark. A delicate tune floated back in its wake. Their fear assuaged and their exhaustion temporarily muted by curiosity, the traveler clambered over the stone slab and followed the butterfly’s path to the top of the hill.</p>
                  <p>They didn’t expect the scene that awaited as they emerged from the trees. Several rough stone pillars, arrayed in what might once have been a circle, ringed the summit of the grassy hill. Nestled against the biggest stood a wide, flat stone platform covered in many colors of faded threadbare cloth that were surely vibrant long ago. Small rock cairns, candles burnt to their wicks’ ends, a bedraggled feather, and a few other small tokens littered the rock’s surface.</p>
                  <p>It might have looked forlorn and abandoned, save for the three women merrily tending to it. One, a Tian woman with pale skin and short, dark hair, was setting out fresh candles, the flame reflected in her dark eyes. The second, a Varisian woman with warm brown skin and multicolored ribbons threaded through her long, wavy hair, was the source of the tune that echoed into the trees; she continued to hum cheerfully she painted the stone pillar with delicate designs. The third figure, a Garundi woman with skin nearly as dark as the night around them, danced as she swept the ground around the shrine, the beads in her cloud of black hair like miniature sisters of the stars. <em>Shh</em>, <em>shh</em>, <em>shh</em>, the broom whispered to the stones.</p>
                  <p>The third woman—clearly a priestess of Desna—spotted their guest first as the ghostly butterfly alit on a nearby cairn. “Welcome, traveler,” she called with a smile, her warm voice gentle as she set the broom aside.</p>
                  <p>The first woman—surely a priestess of Sarenrae—rekindled a dwindling log with a gesture. “You look cold,” she said, her voice strong and clear. “Come, share our fire.”</p>
                  <p>The second woman—undoubtedly a priestess of Shelyn—ceased her song and beckoned the traveler closer. “You are welcome among us.”</p>
                  <p>The traveler, overwhelmed at their kind and unexpected greeting, assented with quiet thanks, sitting near the now-blazing campfire and accepting a warm mug of tea from Shelyn’s acolyte.</p>
                  <p>“You look troubled, friend,” said Sarenrae’s priestess as she sat down across from the traveler.</p>
                  <p>The traveler looked into their tea for a long moment before meeting her gaze. “The road has been long, and uncertain,” they said, and soon found themself telling the women all about their struggles, from the personal queries of identity and belonging to the endless communal work toward justice and liberation.</p>
                  <p>“I’m afraid I’m tired, and lost,” they admitted. “I see a brighter future, but I don’t know how to get there. It’s hard not to feel hopeless, and alone. Though I guess I’m less so, at the moment.”</p>
                  <p>Desna’s acolyte smiled again, looking to her companions. “We are always ready for unexpected friends,” she said, and the others nodded. “And as for being lost or unsure, the only step in any journey that matters is the next one.”</p>
                  <p>“The dawn brings new light,” Sarenrae’s acolyte added. “You may find you see more clearly after rest. There will always be good causes to fight for, but we cannot do so alone and weary. Even the boldest among us must seek rest and community to nourish our spirits.”</p>
                  <p>“I find creation helps,” offered Shelyn’s acolyte, gesturing to the paintbrush now tucked behind her ear. “Love and beauty belong to all, and help to keep hope alive in each other when we might otherwise falter.”</p>
                  <p>“But everything has changed!” cried the traveler. “So many are suffering, and nothing is as I expected it to be. How are we supposed to cope with the uncertainty?”</p>
                  <p>“Change is unavoidable,” said the priestess of Sarenrae. “But it brings new opportunities to right old wrongs. We must face change head-on. Together, we can find courage.”</p>
                  <p>“Change is beautiful,” said the priestess of Shelyn. “Instead of fearing it, we can learn to dance with it.”</p>
                  <p>“Change is the only way we see new horizons,” agreed the priestess of Desna, smiling at her companions and taking their hands in hers. “But as the union of the Radiant Prism has shown us, even in the face of change, some things endure.”</p>
                  <p>As the women joined hands, the traveler saw a new scene before them. Instead of a dark hilltop, there was a peaceful woodland glade with a small creek warmed by afternoon sunlight. Three women rested together in the soft grass, but they were not the acolytes—or had they been the acolytes all along? Two of the women now had wings, one the thin veined membranes of a butterfly, the other the powerful feathers of an angelic raptor, her hair now shining gold as if it contained the sun’s own light. The third woman was crowned in flowers. She sang softly, a comforting ballad of loves’ triumphs, her long hair now threaded with all the colors of the rainbow.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>The traveler slept then, the cares of the road eased, for a while. When they awoke on the hilltop, the women were gone, but they no longer felt quite so alone. The embers still glowed in the fire, and a wren’s morning song filled the air. Above them, starlight twinkled in the friendly dawn sky.</p>

                 <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px">About the Windsong Testaments</p>
                 <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the Windsong Testaments—parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>

                  <h2>Pathfinder Adventure: The Great Toy Heist</h2>
                  <h3><strong>DON’T TOY WITH US! </strong></h3>
                  <p>There’s always someone up to no good in the Chelaxian capital of Egorian, and this time it hits a little too close to home! A corrupt banker discovered there was something magical about The Terrific Toyshop beyond just the magnificent creations within. Greedy and unprincipled, this wealthy noble found a loophole in the diabolically complicated laws of the city and exploited it to seize the deed to the toyshop and threaten to boot the toy maker and his lovely creations out on the streets. What are sentient toys to do in the face of such reprehensible actions? Break in and steal the deed back, of course!</p>
                  <p>In <em>The Great Toy Heist</em>, you take on the role of one of four unique poppets—living toys with strong wills of their own. While your gentle creator is beside himself with worry, you and your friends enact a risky plan to save your home and livelihoods with stealth, subterfuge, and no shortage of luck!</p>

                  <h2>Joseph Blomquist (he/him)</h2>
                  <h3><em>SFS1 #6-03: Project Dawn</em> and <em>SFS1 Special #6-99: The End Awakens</em></h3>
                  <p>This season, I had the opportunity to put my stamp on two adventures that couldn’t be more different.</p>
                  <p>For the first one, <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-03: Project Dawn</em>, I was given the chance to dive back into the nostalgia of my gaming youth when Shadowrun was my game of choice. <em>Project Dawn</em> is truly intended to be a standard espionage run against an evil corporate entity and was a ton of fun to write. Jess even let me bring back an NPC from my first ever SFS adventure! In all honesty, using a simple subsystem to create tension while sneaking around the Dayside Inc. head office was a treat unto itself.</p>
                  <p><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-99: The End Awakens</em> brought entirely different obstacles and opportunities. As a special, its needs were far different than a standard SFS adventure. Fortunately, I was working alongside the dev of some of my favorite PFS adventures, Mike Kimmel. While our styles are very different, they complement each other well, which just shows Jess’s high Wisdom score in pairing us together. One of my goals was to bring a lot of the big moments and decisions back to the table instead of solely allowing the house to have all the fun. And we got away with it! We had forking paths, aid tokens based on table decisions, and even a big moment to understand Krethiskar that occurred at a table level! But more importantly, I got to return to terrorizing Starfinders with bugs, as happened in my somewhat infamous adventure <em>Illegal Shipment</em> from four seasons ago. Starfinder tears really do taste so sweet…</p>
                  <p>Anyway, for more about me, check out the blog I never update at www.UnderwearOnTheOutside.com or on social media under the name DoctorMono. Or better yet, pick up <em>Mechageddon!</em> and get to know what makes me tick (spoilers: Mechs vs. kaiju).</p>
                  <p>See you in Second Edition!</p>

                  <h2>Charlie Brooks (he/him)</h2>
                  <h3><em>SFS1 #6-09: Ridgerock Rescue</em></h3>
                  <p>Hi everyone! My name is Charlie Brooks, and my pronouns are he/him. I had the privilege of writing <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-09: Ridgerock Rescue</em>, which was my first Starfinder publication and an opportunity to engage with this season’s metaplot by revealing the truth behind the Organization.</p>
                  <p>My gaming group loves “adopting” cute and unusual creatures. Since I was going to involve them in the playtest for this scenario, I made sure to add some elements that would make them smile. A big piece of that picture was the skittermander Baazo and his “burnydooms.” Jessica Catalan provided sage advice in crafting this encounter, leading to a sidebar with sample “chitter-chatter” and placing Baazo in a control center so particularly quick groups wouldn’t wipe him out in a single round. In playtesting, the encounter went exactly as I hoped, which is a rare thing in any game for me.</p>
                  <p>Writing a revelation scene in an RPG adventure is different from doing it in a novel, since you don’t have control over the characters and their reactions. The end of <em>Ridgerock Rescue</em> features a lot of exposition about the Organization. I tried to use Ongie’s voice in a compelling way so players felt like they were unraveling a mystery.</p>
                  <p>Outside of the RPG sphere, my recently-released novel <em>Meddling Heroes</em> mashes up a hard-boiled detective story with Silver Age super-heroics. You can find more about that and my other projects at www.ChBrooks.com.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Alison Cybe (they/them)</h2>
                  <h3><em>SFS1 #6-10: The Death of Kortus IV</em></h3>
                  <p>In <em>The Death of Kortus IV</em>, your characters enter a region to evacuate citizens facing the threat of genocide, proactively interceding against the forces trying to destroy them. Starfinders are not a military faction, but they possess enough strength, expertise, and allies to be a positive force for change in the galaxy.</p>
                  <p>The Starfinder Society has been shown to possess corruption, and no small number of agents have gone rogue; this isn’t a utopian setting. But at the same time, they’re the protagonists and can act heroically.</p>
                  <p>And I don’t believe that any true hero, any group on the side of good, would stand by idly while an entire country or planet is subject to genocide. At the time I wrote this adventure, that wasn’t a heavily political statement to make. Things have changed. My position has not. All genocides are an act of raw, unfiltered evil and must be acted against unilaterally.</p>
                  <p>I’m aware that the adventures I’ve written are highly political; I include transgender characters where I don’t have to and make political stances very clear. I strongly believe gaming can be used as a means to discuss, explore, and unify ourselves. I’m also well and able to make a load more of these; ask the devs, loudly and repeatedly, to give me more. You do that, you’ll get more queer and political adventures like this.</p>

                  <h3><em>SFS1 #6-11: Gifts Ungiven</em></h3>
                  <p>Hello! I’m Jeremy Corff (he/him) and I wrote <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-11: Gifts Ungiven</em>. Inspired by a few antics from my own childhood, as well as classics like <em>Home Alone</em>, I tried to set a light tone while still keeping to the “well-meaning disaster” theme. Without giving away spoilers, I think my favorite part of the adventure is the running gag of Big Cherry Goo-gurt (tm). No doubt available at all respectable space ports in the Pact Worlds and beyond! I just hope folks have enjoyed the scenario half as much as I enjoyed writing it.</p>
                  <p>If you’d like to find out more about other projects I’ve worked on, you can find me on Blue Sky at @solorunstudio.bsky.social or at my Starfinder blog https://solorunstudio.com/ where I post weekly homebrew Starfinder content.</p>

                  <h2>Hilary Moon Murphy</h2>
                  <h3><em>SFS1 #6-12: Yesteryear’s Hope</em></h3>
                  <p>Hello, I’m Hilary Moon Murphy, also known as Hmm. I wrote <em>Starfinder Scenario #6-12: Yesteryear’s Hope</em>, a whimsical and hope-filled repeatable adventure that can be summed up as a party on a bug planet. It takes the Starfinders back to Elytrio, home of two very thought-provoking early scenarios by Jason Keeley (<em>#1-03 Yesteryear’s Truth</em> and #<em>1-21 Yesteryear’s Sorrow</em>).</p>
                  <p>There are so many things to mention about this scenario. I had a chance to return to the delightful ghibrani and give them a brighter future, while showing Elytrio in all its radiation-blasted glory. Fans of the earlier scenarios will find many callbacks to the earlier storyline.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after getting the scenario assignment, my dear friend, Jack Brown, died. I made a request to my developer, Jessica Catalan. Could I write Jack’s favorite PC, Lucius, into <em>Yesteryear’s Hope</em> as a special tribute? She said yes (with the approval of Jack’s family). The scenario is dedicated to his memory. In writing this story, I felt that I had come full circle. <em>Yesteryear’s Truth</em> was the first Starfinder Scenario that I GMed, and Jack and I had prepped it together for GenCon, learning the starship combat system as we did. I think Jack would be very happy to see Lucius returning to the planet where his career had gotten its start.</p>

                  <h3><em>SFS1 #6-16: Dawning Fate</em></h3>
                  <p>Hi folks! I’m Linda Zayas-Palmer (she/her), former development manager for the Organized Play team and current full-time freelancer. I was delighted to have the opportunity to write <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-16: Dawning Fate</em>, the epic finale to the machinations of the villainous Order of Dawning Fate. Jessica Catalan and the authors of previous scenarios stretching all the way back to the Order’s first appearance in <em>Starfinder Society Special #3-00: The Last Bite</em> gave me plenty to work with. Storming the stronghold of an organization that has been reading and twisting fate for over a century is no easy task, but the Starfinder Society isn’t going to back down. To avoid spoilers, my favorite parts of the adventure are the lasers and the timey-wimey stuff. I’m excited to see what people think!</p>
                  <p>You can find me on my twitch stream Arcane Mark [link] twitch.tv/arcanemark [/link] on Tuesdays at 8pm Eastern and Saturdays at 1pm eastern, and on the Arcane Mark Discord [link] tiny.cc/arcanemark [/link]. My next project is a Pathfinder Second Edition conversion of Dr Dhrolin’s Dictionary of Dinosaurs, which will launch soon on Kickstarter [link] https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/palaeogames/pathfinder-second-ed-dr-dhrolins-dictionary-of-dinosaurs [/link]. Produced by paleontologists, it features detailed and scientifically accurate information alongside dozens of new stat blocks for Mesozoic dinosaurs and reptiles, plus plenty of new player content.</p>

                  <p>‘Way! Hello! I’m Sara Jeffers (she/they), and I’m the author of <em>Starfinder Bounty #10: Those Who Were Taken</em>. I really enjoyed pulling inspiration from personal experiences and cultural influences to create a banal evil, a thoroughly unremarkable force that can permeate quietly—something that has directly impacted my lives and the lives of my family. It was freeing to channel that, and now I can repeatably defeat it in a variety of exciting ways! The anacites are one of my favorites in the whole game because the idea of self-modification to become who you truly are and need to be is something I feel to my core. The idea that each individual is not only allowed to but is celebrated for their uniqueness is something I staunchly and stubbornly support. You can catch me on Twitter @BabaYagaQuest, Discord @babayagacreative, and on Twitch with Enchanted Sorcery Productions in a Murder Mystery Monster of the Week game set in Thedas. <em>End of Love</em> airs all summer on Thursday at 7:30 PM Pacific!</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">With <em>Pathfinder Player Core 2</em> releasing at the start of August, we know players are anticipating the remastered versions of some of their favorite classes! In a series of blogs starting right here, we’ll be alternating between talking about the changes to four of the classes and showing off some fun fiction and art starring the iconic characters of <em>Player Core 2</em>.</p>
                  <p>The champion is the premier divine warrior, with some of the best armor and defenses in the game. They’re devoted to their deity and their tenets. One of the major changes to the remaster was dropping alignment, which the champion has always featured heavily, so we know everyone expects big changes to the class!</p>
                  <p>We’ve already put basic compatibility rules for the champion in the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq">Pathfinder FAQ</a>—see <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> Errata (Remaster Compatibility)—but the <em>Player Core 2</em> version will present a much more thorough overhaul. So what do fans of this class have to look forward to?</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bf96939a-6c8c-49bd-a84e-bdbfb8a63dd1/PZO2103_Duels_2000.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bf96939a-6c8c-49bd-a84e-bdbfb8a63dd1/PZO2103_Duels_2000.jpg" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Seelah, the iconic champion, battles a tyrant devil.

                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>Before the remaster, a champion’s alignment and their choice of champion cause established a strict set of hierarchical rules to be followed. Each good and evil alignment had a cause tied to it, like the lawful good paladin, chaotic good liberator, and neutral evil desecrator. The remastered version still has a cause, but the focus has shifted away from being so strict and static. Now we use edicts and anathema tied to different character choices to guide your roleplaying.</p>
                  <p>Let’s take the paladin as an example. They used to follow the two tenets of good, two tenets of the lawful good paladin cause, and any edicts and anathema for their deity. A champion under the remastered rules would choose the justice cause. They would follow the edicts and anathema of their deity, plus the following from the cause of justice.</p>
                  <p><strong>Edicts</strong> follow the law, respect legitimate authorities or leadership</p>
                  <p><strong>Anathema</strong> take advantage of another, cheat</p>
                  <p>More emphasis on edicts rather than an unbendable code loosens some of the restrictions on their roleplaying to allow more well-rounded, nuanced characters. There’s a better balance over “should nots” instead of all “must nots.”</p>
                  <p>A champion can optionally choose a sanctification. If you’ve read <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em>, you’re familiar with holy and unholy sanctification—a choice based on your deity that lets you commit yourself to the battle for souls between the holy planes and unholy planes. Champions can choose sanctification based on their deity, though unholy sanctification is an uncommon option. Each sanctification gives you another edict and anathema, and adds the holy or unholy trait to all your Strikes.</p>
                  <p>Some, but not all, champion causes require a certain sanctification. Justice, mentioned above, does not. The Player Core 2 causes are justice, liberation, and obedience (open to all); desecration and iniquity (open only to unholy champions); and redemption and grandeur (open only to holy champions). If you are already playing a champion and want to update them to the new options, you’ll probably be able to keep the core of that character. Though you can always shake things up with the new grandeur cause, which is based on the brilliant splendor of celestials.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Other Changes</h3>
                  <p>This class has seen a huge number of other changes we think will make it more satisfying to play, but we don’t want to keep you here all day with one blog post. So here’s the short version!</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>You now have a defined champion’s aura for your reactions, aura feats, and other abilities, which lets other rules alter and refer to the range of your divine abilities more easily.</li>
                   <li>The divine ally ability has been changed to blessing of the devoted, and the mount has moved to a 1st-level feat. You can instead choose the blessed swiftness option to move faster—whether you’re mounted or not.</li>
                   <li>Feats saw a ton of change, like the new Defensive Advance feat and updated structure for Mercy. We focused on broadly useful feats plus maintaining some backward compatibility, but we did run out of room. You’ll see oath feats moved to <em>Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</em>. We’re hoping to find a book in which it would make sense to remaster litanies at some point, but we don’t have one that can hold them yet.</li>
                   <li>You choose a focus spell based on your deity’s divine font options. As before the remaster, you can choose <em>lay on hands</em> if your deity allows the <em>heal</em> divine font or <em>touch of the void</em> (formerly <em>touch of corruption</em>) if they allow the <em>harm</em> divine font. However, there’s also a new option for a deity with any font, specially made for defense-minded characters. Introducing <em>shields of the spirit</em>!</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <p><strong>Shields of the Spirit [one-action] Focus 1</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Uncommon, Champion, Concentrate, Focus, Sanctified, Spirit</strong><br><strong>Requirements</strong> You are wielding a shield.</p>
                  <p>You Raise your Shield, causing ephemeral spirit shields to float within your champion’s aura. The shields last until the start of your next turn or until you’re no longer raising your shield, whichever comes first. While one of your allies is in your champion’s aura, the shields grant them a +1 status bonus to AC, and each time an enemy makes an attack against the ally, the enemy takes 1d4 spirit damage (even if it misses).</p>
                  <p>The benefit applies only while an ally is in your aura, ending for any ally that leaves and applying to any that enters later. As normal, you don’t count as your own ally and therefore don’t get the benefits of the spirit shields yourself.<br><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The damage increases by 1d4.</p>

                  <p>We’ll have a lot more intel from the feedback front once the playtest closes. It’s too early to note what exactly we’ll be tweaking and how we’ll be changing it, but here are a couple little tidbits of information.</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>The commander will receive more tactics for a diverse set of playstyles, especially master and legendary tactics!</li>
                   <li>We saw that there was some confusion about the Hardness and statistics for the commander’s banner, so we’re already looking to make sure that will be clarified.</li>
                   <li>Similarly, we have noticed a few wording issues with the guardian’s threat technique and have flagged that class feature for future work.</li>
                   <li>We’re also closely examining the numbers of the guardian’s Taunt ability, with the hopes of creating something that will really sing.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <br>
                  <p>I’d also like to share a couple of anecdotes from my own playtests of the guardian! The first, which occurred over PaizoCon weekend, saw a 4th-level party dealing with a “swamp witch,” who was just an ogre glutton and a boggard swampseer working together. The guardian of that party used Area Cover to turn a successful basic Reflex save into a critical success, preventing the group’s fighter from taking any damage! For the second playtest, we put together some 16th-level characters to face an ancient adamantine dragon! The guardian’s ability to withstand damage was put to the test, but he stood firm against the threat and even managed to grapple the fearsome opponent for a round. Overall, these playtests have allowed me to see the classes in action and better understand how people might play them, which will help the team better refine their mechanics.</p>
                  <p>We don’t yet have sketches for our new iconics but rest assured that Wayne Reynolds is in the trenches producing his usual stellar art. Personally, I’m so excited about what we’ve got in store for these two characters. Now, you might be able to guess some facts about one of the iconics, but I’m certain you’re going to be surprised by the other one! If you’ve got some theories, I’d love to hear them in the comments!</p>

                   <p>Dae (they/them)* is a sparkly celebrity from a free planet in the Veskarium, a nearby star system ruled by a warlike empire. Dae was born on Pulonis, the pahtra** homeworld—a magical jungle world wracked by intense magnetic storms that degrade technology and bless the planet with spectacular aurora displays. Born last in a large litter from a remote agrarian village, Dae has always loved to make a dramatic entrance, and their birth was no exception.</p>
                   <p>A magnetic storm raged over Pulonis during Dae’s birth, and coils of lavender, rose, and golden light fractured the sky over their village in slow, chaotic waves, shutting down power in every household and scrambling comms as tech infrastructure suddenly failed—a disaster for a pahtra ending a long labor by delivering a runt the midwife thought might be stillborn.</p>
                   <p>Dae asked the old folks about it later, and they said the storm was Meyel tearing the sky apart as she danced for joy.Dae fought through the storm of the century alive, dragging a souvenir of the event with them: a tiny orb of starfire that blazed like a miniature sun.</p>

                   <p><strong>Dae is a solarian.</strong> At the time of their birth, they miraculously manifested a stellar mote. At first, Dae’s family believed they’d imagined seeing it, as the mote was a speck and appeared for only a second; it was surely a trick of the light. Then the spark emerged when Dae cried out in hunger, or flared into being when the baby woke up alone in their cradle. Somehow, it could never be captured on video, even when everybody thought they had seen it.</p>
                   <p>Dae’s mote became more stable as they grew. Soon they learned how to command it, shaping it into armaments: a dazzling sword of starlight, a flaming ribbon, a shield made from the aurora they were born under. As Dae practiced forging their mote into new shapes, they discovered its attunement with gravitic energies. Cycling between these extremes helped them keep control of the reckless stunts they performed, using their mote as an anchor to keep balance or as a flashlight to see down dark tunnels.</p>
                   <p><strong>Dae is a famous performer</strong>, and they have wanted to be seen from the moment they scrambled out into the world. From dancing to executing dangerous stunts and elaborate dramatic scenes, Dae has always been down for whatever it takes to draw a crowd. Showing off was always the norm for them (their aunties and littermates could tell you some wild stories), and they grew up performing at local cultural festivals and winning awards at regional talent shows.</p>
                   <p>For a long time, Dae uploaded their vids for a small but loyal following on local infospheres. Then serendipity—or Meyel herself—struck again: they met Miiyu, a pahtra celebrity pop star. Scrambling to dodge the paparazzi, Miiyu ducked into a local café, ran for the back door, and nearly smacked right into Dae, who was performing a stunt in the café’s back alley in view of their live-recording camera drone. After recovering, clocking the live feed, and seeing Dae’s dance moves, Miiyu invited them to costar in a music video. The video was a hit, and Dae later joined Miiyu as a backup dancer for her sold-out world tour.</p>
                   <p>Miiyu’s no-strings-attached endorsement boosted Dae’s career. But that was months ago, and Dae’s only just begun to shine. Next up, they want to see the galaxy outside the Veskarium. They’ve used their pay from Miiyu’s tour to book their own personal “tour” to the Pact Worlds system, starting with the space station at the center of the galaxy.</p>
                   <p>Now, Dae’s a rising star hoping to do fame their way. They’re not looking to line the pockets of some greedy exec or get tied down with fine print; they care about putting on a show and exploring the galaxy, which is why they vibe so well with Chk Chk. After meeting as interns working for the Starfinder Society, the pair became the best of friends. They’ve even traded friendship bracelets (Dae wears theirs every day) and have shared a mystical bond that lets them speak straight into each other’s minds (with permission).</p>
                   <p>Where will Dae go next? That’s up to you! Stay proud and playtest. &lt;3<br><br></p>
                   <p>*Dae, like many pahtras*, is agender, a nonbinary gender identity that isn’t male or female. Dae uses they/them pronouns. So, when you see “they” and “them” used in place of gendered pronouns like “she” or “him” referring to Dae, that’s why.</p>
                   <p>Dae is an alien stellar knight and space pop star who doesn’t care what you think of their gender, but real people with agender and/or nonbinary identities <em>do</em> care if you maliciously misuse their pronouns or make fun of their gender expression, so please act in the spirit of fun and kindness when gaming with people in your community.</p>
                   <p><strong>**Pahtras</strong> are bipedal felinoid aliens (they’re alien cat-people who walk on two legs) from Pulonis, a planet in the Veskarium whose people have been fighting a brutal war for independence from the vesk-run empire. Pulonis recently achieved freedom and joined the Pact Worlds, a federation of independent planets dedicated to maintaining peace and prosperity in the galaxy. The Veskarium is currently at war with the Azlanti Star Empire and has yet to retaliate against the former colony.</p>

                  <h2>Sanctioning &amp; New Options</h2>
                  <p>We’ve got a whole mess of new player options for both campaigns this month, let’s take a look!</p>
                  <h3>Sanctioned Content</h3>
                  <p><em>Howl of the Wild</em> and <em>Mechageddon!</em> were both released last month, and both are now sanctioned for use in their respective campaigns! Boons are available for <em>Howl of the Wild</em> ancestries and other uncommon content, and sanctioning for <em>Mechageddon!</em> is posted on its product page. This marks the last content release for Starfinder first edition, but the playtest is just around the corner!</p>
                  <h3>New Boons</h3>
                  <p>Both campaigns also have new boons available! In Pathfinder Society, we’ve created an Avid Collector boon for uncommon items from the <em>GM Core</em>. We’ve also created a new Special Materials Access boon, which will allow your characters to purchase or craft items, armor and weapons of a special material. Full text of both of these boons is available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq">Pathfinder Society FAQ</a>.</p>
                  <p>Starfinder Society also has two new boons to celebrate the launch of Year 7! Starfinders can now have finitrium augmentations installed, unlocking new abilities, and can become First Ones Scholars which should be useful in our upcoming Year of Era’s End. Check them both out on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq">Starfinder Society FAQ</a> and in the boon store.</p>
                  <h3>Release the Poppets!</h3>
                  <p>Finally, as announced in our Organized Play Updates panel at PaizoCon, all Pathfinder Society players now have access to the poppet ancestry! This comes just in time for our upcoming poppet-themed Free RPG Day adventure, releasing later this month. Previously-purchased poppet boons also have gained the traditional free resurrection ritual.</p>

                  <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                  <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>
                  <p>This month, a new Campaign Service Coin was awarded! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and reasons.</p>
                  <p>Congratulations to:<br><strong>Kate Baker</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #904</p>
                  <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                  <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                  <p>This month, we had three GMs earn their 5th rank!</p>
                  <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Philip Newton, Travis St. Ames, Travis Zimmerman</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And I’ll see you on the road!</p>

                  <p>The Black Powder Cadre met its match!</p>
                  <p>It took eight levels of the Abomination Vaults to finally run into something that not only exposed a severe weakness in our party, but also exploited it. Again, and again. Let’s see, what could possibly shut down a party of mostly human gunslingers? Magical <em>darkness</em> should be near the top of the list. Make it heightened <em>darkness</em>, just to mess with those darkvision elixirs. How about a community of creatures that can throw <em>darkness</em> back at our desperados like a box of bang snaps? Well, the caligni we encountered on level eight did exactly that, and hit us from so many directions in the dark that we had to snag a high Perception DC just to find our own wounds. Then we learned there was another community of caligni below us on level nine. Yeah, this was a rough marathon.</p>
                  <p>To get to level nine we had to get past level eight, and we were in new territory here. We had switched authors from Vanessa Hoskins to Stephen Radney-MacFarland—a grizzled veteran whose plethora of work in this industry takes us back to when our own veterans had a lot more hair. In fact, level eight of the Abomination Vaults paid homage to an adventure module that carries plenty of nostalgia around our table: <em>Against the Cult of the Reptile God</em>. We first played it in ‘96, and our GM liked it so much that he ran it again for us in 2005 and 2009. Level eight of the Vaults even hinted at some of our favorite scenes from the soggy, humid dungeon we remember: the infamous “mud room,” the off-limits door with a very clear warning on it, boats to traverse the level, and even the naga boss you can only reach by water.</p>

                  <p>For this marathon we were joined again by Joe O’Brien from the <a href="https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/">Glass Cannon Network</a>, rocking the same Beast Gunner archetype as before. Joe wanted more of our typical marathon experience this time, which means playing fourteen or more hours in a day, crashing on an air mattress near the table, then doing it all over again at 6:00 a.m. when Adam blasts our soundtrack to wake the team. You’ll eat well though, and there’s always a bonfire at the end of the weekend. To Glass Cannon fans, we’ll say that Joe handled the extreme playtime pretty well, and is starting to stack up some session hours for that Order of the Amber Die membership!</p>

                  <h2>Highlights from Marathon 6:</h2>
                  <p>□ On level eight we found ourselves surrounded in a temple by caligni stalkers and their endless <em>darkness</em>. Put it this way: we got good at flat checks. As if things couldn’t get worse, something called an owb showed up. A creature with a background as shadowy as the caligni themselves, this thing can turn you from our cadre’s shared blue colors to drab gray—and even turn your gun gray, which is where we drew the line. Joe came through with the Beast Gunner, landing a couple of devastating shots from his drake rifle that allowed us to walk away alive and most importantly, blue.</p>
                  <p>□ If you’ve followed our projects over the years, then you know we despise gugs, in-game and out. We came across another one, which held something called a <em>fulcrum lens</em> that we unfortunately needed. One of our snipers, Mazatl, practicing the Way of the Spellshot and wearing what Erick calls “dungeon camo,” crept into position. Erick is even known to wear a ghillie suit at the table to mimic his <em>cloak of elvenkind</em>. Can you find Mazatl in the photo? The sniper aimed for the head and landed the first shot, but the gug still tore into us for six rounds before we put it down.</p>
                  <p>□ Think you can predict what a Pathfinder megadungeon has in store for you? Enter level nine, with its 10-foot scale in the original version of the adventure. We’re going to have to lay this one out on the patio to get a full pic for the next blog. It’s also level nine where you really get a sense of just how interconnected this megadungeon is to the Darklands that surround it, which is evident as the worked stone in the levels above has now shifted to caverns. Since we’ve delved <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8yqx?Pathfinder-Module-The-Emerald-Spire-Superdungeon">The Emerald Spire</a> and measured its square footage, we can say that level nine is what helps the Abominaton Vaults achieve its title as the largest megadungeon in Pathfinder history!</p>
                  <p>□ A massive dungeon level just meant more reach for our shooters. We’d been waiting nine levels to see the 150’ range on both the harmona and arquebus truly rip, and honestly, in a dungeon we never thought we’d see it. When Breen spotted four ceustodaemons on some kind of guard duty, it just meant long range fun. We opened initiative, and one was on the ground before they heard the shots.</p>
                  <p>□ Level nine was full of towering bioluminescent fungi, which meant breaking out the blacklights for the truest experience. It also meant getting ourselves into a fungal forest firefight with reaper skull puffballs. Don’t be fooled by the name like we were; these things are badass. Go look at the illustration inside <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024xm?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-165-Eyes-of-Empty-Death">Eyes of Empty Death</a> and tell us that the miniatures we had to represent them weren’t darn near perfect, too. Better yet, an exploded puffball is worth 150 gp! Zoric, the cadre’s Unexpected Sharpshooter, scored both money shots and made it rain.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Character Deaths</h2>
                  <p>□ None, but everyone in this party owes another thank you to Breen, Way of the Pistolero. When you’re surrounded by hostiles and bleeding out, it’s our pistol phenom that will pull you to safety and cauterize your wounds—popping off rounds in the process.</p>

                  <h2>The Arsenal</h2>
                  <p>Order of the Amber Die doesn’t have a session zero before our campaigns begin. We start somewhere around session negative eight. In one of those meetings, our player captain had us brainstorm ways that we might cause awkward encounters throughout an Adventure Path by making an entire party of gunslingers. No one suggested anything close to what we came across on level eight of the Vaults. We encountered some drow who took us to their outpost on the level below, packed with none other than the Darklands equivalent of our own gunslingers: the Drow Shootist archetype and their repeating crossbows. We hit it off almost instantly, and soon we were sharing stories over a game of cards, including tales of the best and luckiest shots we’ve landed during our time in the Vaults. Even the art for Quara, their leader, showed her with a bandolier and a set of dueling boots that matched plenty of members in our cadre. She also had a scar across her face from—guess what—a gug. Naturally, we ended up at their firing range, where they allowed Vlai to have his dwarven scattergun (with large bore modifications) for a friendly competition. With all three targets destroyed in a single 15’ radius hit, we won.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Best Quote from Marathon 6</h2>
                  <p>(fierce battle in a caligni temple)</p>
                  <p>Adam: “Caligni stalker is near death, cornered, attacks Axayaca. Gotta go to the Amber Die for this one.”</p>
                  <p>Matt (to Joe): “This is when the Amber Die usually goes off.”</p>
                  <p>Joe: “...”</p>
                  <p>Adam: “First attack hits… Second attack… 20! Attack you again, agile, -8 penalty… NATURAL 20!”</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Current Situation</h2>
                  <p>Well, we’ve made it to the final game of the season—this next marathon is the last one either way. We’re trying not to let the pressure get to us; we keep telling ourselves it’s just another marathon. If we do succeed in defeating Belcorra, then drow aid must be accounted for. Not only are they a source of items, trade, and safety, but the drow have become our friends—we certainly don’t have many on the surface. From conversations with their scouts, we’ve learned of a dragon’s lair on level nine. The drow avoid it. Which, of course, meant that we took a party vote to fight it.

                  <p>Hello, Pathfinders!</p>
                  <p itemprop="description">So, I’ve been pulled back and forth in a million directions this season! First, I was assigned all the way up in Irrisen to look at some new gadget or something, so I was <em>trying</em> to find a fashionable winter coat, until I was informed that I was “desperately needed” on the grounds of Absalom.</p>
                  <p>Which, let’s be honest, isn’t Absalom where I do my <em>best</em> work?</p>
                  <p>Alright, news on the street:</p>
                  <p>First of all, the Knights of Lastwall are BROKE. Like B-R-O-K-E, broke! At least, that’s what it says on all of the posters put up around the city centers advertising a charity dinner and upcoming carnival. There have been some preemptive donations made toward the campaign to fund them against the Old Baphy war, but according to my insider source in the Coins District, someone recently made a HUGE contribution from a strange account in the north. Maybe Ulthun’s new girl?</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Next, it looks like we’ll finally have some new leadership over in Nirmathas! As I was sorting out archival mail, I learned that Agents Anemone, Bog’s Companion, and Pattypan of Gold Bits have been filling out paperwork and starting to help get everything back into shape after Oraiah left. Good for them!</p>
                  <p>And for a very serious note, one of my sources says there’s been strange movement at the docks, with ships coming in from Mediogalti Island. There’s only ever a bare bones crew, and they seem to have no idea what’s stored in the bright red crates. The crates are collected by a different person each time, and they sign with a stamp that sort of looks like a scythe, but also looks like a messed-up bug, but also looks like a squashed book. It’s a pretty bad stamp.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Gary Teter came to Paizo way back in 2004 at a pivotal point in the company’s history. We started off as a magazine company, and the process of inputting subscriptions and renewals was eating up the small profit that magazines made back then, so we decided to try to do it through a website. But this was in 2004, and there just weren’t any website options you could purchase, so we considered building it ourselves, which was a daunting task.</p>
                  <p>Gary was brought in as we were struggling to figure out what to do. He brought vision and hard work to the table, and lo and behold, we launched paizo.com and brought subscriptions online. Once the magazines went away, that same subscription service morphed into one of the financial backbones of the company. I’m not sure Paizo would be here today if Gary hadn’t started working for us. Since then, he kept the machine going for twenty years!</p>
                  <p>Gary also brought a sense of humor to Paizo. Remember “Talk Like a Pirate Day,” when Gary made it so everything you posted turned into pirate language? Or the secret Smurf thing where your avatar changed into a Smurf whenever you mentioned them in a post? That was Gary.</p>
                  <p>I loved working with Gary during those early years of paizo.com. The website was a blank page, and we could dream about what we wanted it to be. Some things were instant successes, like side carts. Others were left on the cutting room floor (I’m looking at you, Paizooties). But through it all, Gary had a love for the customer and did his best to make their experience on paizo.com a great one. He would spend late nights trying to shave off shipping costs just to save folks a little more money.</p>
                  <p>Gary will be missed at Paizo.</p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;">Lisa Stevens<br><em>CEO</em><br></p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Gary Teter was never among the most well-known employees at Paizo, but if you’ve ever interacted with paizo.com in any way, you’ve felt his influence. And if you’ve ever noticed some feature here that no other website has, Gary almost certainly played a major role in creating it.</p>
                  <p>Gary was Paizo’s third-longest tenured employee, after Erik Mona and James Jacobs. Paizo’s original webmaster, Rob Head, hired Gary in March 2004, while Paizo was still just publishing magazines.</p>
                  <p>When we hired him, paizo.com was mainly a collection of static pages, one for each of our magazines, plus a sidebar for brief news updates. You could subscribe, purchase back issues, and not much else. Twenty years ago, Gary was working furiously on changing that, adding message boards in August, and launching a real web store offering thousands of gaming products in November. While the site has evolved over the years, the paizo.com you know today is still built on the foundations Gary and Rob created two decades ago.</p>
                  <p>But as important as Gary’s contributions to the website were, his role in shaping the paizo.com community was in many ways even more impactful. With the launch of the message boards, Gary took on the role of “PostMonster General,” acting not just as the community’s first moderator, but helping to set the tone for all interactions on paizo.com.</p>
                  <p>Gary was serious about his work and always interested in the ways that evolving technology could be used, from the <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2h5ok?The-Loaf-Question">utterly confusing construction that is ents and loaves</a> to <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43srn?Using-a-chatbot-to-design-a-mystery-game">using a chatbot to turn an ordinary deck of cards into a mystery game to play with his son</a>.</p>
                  <p>Gary strongly believed in doing things the right way with a customer-first attitude. Whenever I would approach him with a complicated idea that I thought our customers would appreciate, he would explain the inherent difficulties that kept every other website from doing it, and then he’d figure out how to make it happen, and he’d usually do it quickly and do it well.</p>
                  <p>Gary also always approached things with humor. He once demonstrated a new feature in our back-end software to our sales manager, who flippantly complained that it had one flaw: not enough pancake bunnies (referencing a then-current meme involving a Japanese rabbit known for balancing baked goods on its head). So Gary added “Pancake Bunny Mode” to the tool, in which lines of animated rabbits loaded up with syrupy goodness marched across the screen—a feature that you could toggle on or off… unless you were the sales manager, in which case there was no off switch.</p>
                  <p>Gary was occasionally courted by companies that offered him much more money that Paizo ever could, but he genuinely loved paizo.com and the paizo.com community, and he told me several times over the years that he never wanted to work anywhere other than Paizo for the rest of his life. Gary’s contributions to Paizo were foundational and crucial, and I’m greatly saddened that he won’t be here to help guide paizo.com into its third decade.</p>

                  <p>I remember the change that crept through Paizo after Gary came aboard so many years ago. From over in the editorial department, his influence was subtle at first, but then Smurfs started showing up on the message boards. To me, those little blue gremlins were probably the most visual (and unexpected) of the manifestations of the glory that was Gary. But beyond the boards and the machinery of the virtual world, Gary was someone I always felt welcome to chat with, be it a happenstance greeting in a breakroom that developed into a full-on conversation, a discussion at a work gathering about the intersection of internet and gamer culture, sharing quirky cat-themed anecdotes, or just some good old reminiscing about the early days of Paizo. His presence in the very early Paizo chat rooms was always welcome and comforting, as was his sense of humor. He put humanity into Paizo’s infrastructure in ways I expect I’ll still be discovering, marveling at, and appreciating for years to come. I’ll miss you, my friend.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>I first met Gary, like many who interacted with him, online. I first found my way to this community through the message boards, and Gary was the guy running the show back then. He had an interesting way of moderating conversations and keeping the community entertained and on point. It was this community and the people in it that led me to freelancing, and though it sounds weird for someone in the tech side of the company being responsible for a word jockey starting his career, that’s the case. Gary was not only fun to chat with, he was also supportive. In the way-back times, a few of us started a chat room that served as a somewhat real-time version of the message boards where regulars would hang out and keep up with each other. I was in that chat room all the time and so was Gary, who was the first Paizo staffer we asked to join. It was in that chat room where I really got to know Gary. From the Smurf “prank” to the odd threads and experiments that went way over my head, Gary was always up to something interesting, and I swear, half the time you could see the twinkle in his eye even through text. When I finally joined the company and moved out here, it was nice seeing a familiar face in the office that was outside of my immediate department. We even lived in the same apartment complex, so I’d see him around outside of work too. Gary was a delightfully strange man, with a head full of concepts, ideas, and plans that I couldn’t even fathom with my puny word-focused brain. So, thank you for all the education and entertainment. We’ll miss you, Gary!</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Gary Teter was a passionate developer with a soft spot for retro hardware and clicky keyboards. When we were still in a physical office, it wasn't unusual to see Gary rolling by my window atop his Solowheel on his way home at the end of the day. Once we all started working remotely, Gary lamented the loss of the day-to-day impromptu conversations that would happen just by virtue of having desks near each other. Those conversations could be about anything from how we might solve a particular technical challenge to why we didn't have more (or any) pneumatic tubes in the office.</p>
                  <p>Professionally, Gary loved solving complex or tricky problems and took great delight in a satisfying solution. He made a lasting impact with his creativity and dedication to his work. I especially appreciated the sense of whimsy he injected into our daily conversations and many of the things he did. His depth of knowledge and creative ideas will be missed. He was a one-of-a-kind personality who will always be remembered at Paizo.</p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;">Rei Ko<br><em>Vice President of Technology</em><br></p>
                  <p>It's difficult to share memories of a coworker and feel like you did them justice. Working together is such a specific context that you can spend years with someone and never feel like you got the full picture of who they truly were. So I will resist the urge to lay out some sort of comprehensive, definitive statement on Gary Teter. I’m not qualified to do that. I will simply tell what I can, in the hopes that others will fill in the gaps in my telling to form a more complete picture.</p>
                  <p>Gary was a wizard. If you told him you needed something built, he would go read the book on that thing and come back having built it. He would build his own tooling so he could have exactly what he needed to get his job done. He would cast magic with code.</p>
                  <p>Gary was one of the most customer-oriented colleagues I've ever worked with. Regardless of the other factors in play, he was always deeply grateful to the people who purchased Paizo products—the people who enable so many of us at the company to do what we love for a living. Every feature he implemented had an eye towards surprising and delighting customers, as well as treating them fairly and honestly, whether they found out about it or not. It was a matter of personal principle. He couldn't <em>not</em> do that.</p>
                  <p>Gary believed that learning was a lifelong process. Twenty years into working on the code-base for Paizo, he was still researching new algorithms, frameworks, and techniques—either for use on the job or just for fun. He always had a handful of pet projects at home to work on after he'd signed off for the day: an audiophile amplifier here, a spectrum analyzer there. A few years prior to the pandemic he learned to ride an electric monowheel because, in his own words, "I just decided that I wanted to be the kind of person who could ride a wheel, mostly because it looked awesome, and I’ve always thought that sort of thing would be impossible for me, and that it was time I let go of preconceived notions about what I could and couldn’t do."</p>
                  <p>Gary was a trailblazer. If you needed to get 30 people from <em>here</em> to <em>there</em> across all manner of difficult terrain, he’d figure out the exact route to take. Perhaps someone else would have to arrange the provisions, and another person would need to load and balance the wagons, and a third person would keep the caravan together along the way. But the path itself? The guy with the machete hacking through the underbrush 50 yards ahead, shouting back, "It's this way!"? That was all Gary. It wasn't until I reached the end of this paragraph that I realized that there's another name for that person:</p>
                  <p>Gary was a Pathfinder. And now he's gone.</p>
                  <p>And Paizo is the lesser for it.</p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;">Brian Bauman<br><em>Software Architect</em><br></p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Gary was one of the first people I spoke to on my first day at Paizo, and I distinctly remember thinking, “Oh, right, I work in the TTRPG industry now. Of course I’ll be working next to a bespectacled, bearded ponytailed guy named Gary with an esoteric sense of humor.”</p>
                  <p>That was only my first impression, of course; over the next six years, he made countless others. He was an old-school geek who embodied the absolute best of classic <a href="https://idlewords.com/2007/04/the_alameda_weehawken_burrito_tunnel.htm">weird</a> online and programmer culture. He was the owner of a desk that resembled the Iron Throne if it had been built from 20 years of Paizo products. He was the guy in our weekly Zoom meetings who always had a wall of oscilloscopes or something that looked like a half-built robot on a workbench behind him somewhere. And, like others have said, he was an incredibly smart and talented coder who cared tremendously about his work and what it meant to the Pathfinder and Starfinder communities. It didn’t matter whether he was working on code to save customers money by shipping in as few packages as possible, an uncheatable die roller for the play-by-post boards, banishing spambots to an endless Sartre-esque digital labyrinth, or some shamelessly goofy forum feature; he approached every projects with the same level of deadly seriousness and took enormous pride in ensuring that it was done right, no matter how ridiculous it was.</p>
                  <p>It's hard to imagine a paizo.com without Gary and his contributions, and his passing will leave a tremendous void not only on Paizo’s tech team, but in the company as a whole. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones, and I am proud and grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him for as long as I did.</p>

                  <h3>THE LAST STAND OF KARNATH! — CR 6</h3>
                  <p>After catching Firefight’s notice playing Valko Derby, the PCs were invited to step out of the valkopods and become the real huzkars by joining the New Valor Defense Force. NVDF training is comprehensive for all recruits, regardless of prior vocation, to prepare them for military duties and potential challenges from combat training and mech repair to physical fitness and aircraft piloting. All potentially dangerous training occurs in simulated environments utilizing some of the galaxy’s best virtual reality technology. As a result, NVDF training pods are a familiar sight to every NVDF recruit, even if they aren’t offered many chances to train in the simulated valko cockpits. But with the placement exam schedule communicated well in advance, the prevailing mood is a flux of excitement and anxiety as everyone hopes for the chance to prove themselves. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>Commander “Raptor” Wano’s voice issues a disembodied message as his training assistant, Lieutenant Bastian-5, helps the recruits into individual cockpits in the training center’s testing chamber. “Recruits! Today is your placement exam. Do well and you might find yourself in the 3rd battlegroup as the 13th, 14th, or even 15th Valko squadron under my command! Thanks to an agreement with Storyteller Productions, today’s exam will feature colossi from the popular Kaiju Riot holovid series. As you know Lt. Bastian-5 is a huge fan of those movies—time to make them proud. Today you get to be the heroes!”</p>

                  <h4>Culture or Profession (Charisma-based) (Recall Knowledge)</h4>
                  <p>The <em>Kaiju Riot!</em> series of films is well-known on Daimalko and has small cult followings all over the galaxy. NVDF recruits have likely seen one or more of the films and that film knowledge could help them in the upcoming simulation. For more benefits of watching these films, see <strong>Trivial Knowledge</strong>, below.</p>
                  <p><strong>10+:</strong> The <em>Kaiju Riot!</em> series follows the often-terrible exploits of a lone colossus, Gadrakor. In early films, Gadrakor brutally destroyed several Daimalkan settlements. Critics applaud these early films for teaching the benefits of environmentalism through cinematic media. Eventually, Gadrakor became a hero, defending Daimalko against unspeakable horrors.</p>
                  <p><strong>15+:</strong> Pop star Jollys Vass got her start with the hit <em>Don’t Fall</em>, a ballad written from the perspective of two damai lovers who were separated during Gadrakor’s rampage in <em>Kaiju Riot! 1</em>. In that film, Gadrakor’s characteristics were based on questionable information about an illusive colossus called a drakogor. In the years since, groundbreaking field research about real drakogors has provided new material for the sequels.</p>
                  <p><strong>20+: </strong>In <em>Kaiju Riot! 3: The Doom from Beyond,</em> Gadrakor teams up with a nearly invulnerable mechanical version of himself from the previous film, Mechagadrakor, to face a demonic version of himself, the space emperor colossus King Gadrakor.</p>
                  <p><strong>25+:</strong> Gadrakor and his iterations have all the same abilities as a real drakogor: they can absorb energy attacks to power their breath weapons, which deal sonic damage, and have a hardened mantle that adds to their natural armor. Encourage the PCs to swap out their simulated mechs’ weapons to avoid giving the enemy an advantage.</p>
                  <h4>The Mission</h4>
                  <p>The PCs’ simulated mechs begin in the center of Karnath, an ancient Daimalkan city lost to colossi attacks long ago. The simulation completes almost instantly, finalizing the holographic details of a breezy spring afternoon with streets empty except for the PCs. A Daimalkan orb rests in a hollow built into the bronze statue the PCs’ mechs are positioned around. Four wide streets wind in all four cardinal directions leading away from the monument. Tall office buildings and empty residences line each block except for the planetary transit landing pad northwest of the PCs.</p>
                  <p>When the PCs are ready to begin, Commander Wano’s voice gives the final orders before the simulation begins. “The Gadrakors have only one goal: Destroy the orb. To pass this exam, you only have to stop them. Defeat all your enemies and protect the orb. Good luck, recruits.”</p>
                  <p><strong>PCs and Mechs:</strong> This encounter is designed for four level 2 PCs. As part of their ongoing training at the NVDF Academy, the PCs have been learning the ins and outs of various mech configurations to better prepare them to their assignments as huzkars in the new modular Apex valkos, or as support crew for others who are assigned that role. As a result, players should create Tier 2 mechs for their PCs using the rules in <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Map:</strong> This simulation uses the monument side of <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Metropolis.</em> The PC’s mechs begin the encounter huddled in the middle of the map around the monument. 1 square represents 10 feet of terrain.</p>
                  <p><strong>Trivial Knowledge:</strong> Watching the <em>Kaiju Riot! </em>film series has given the PCs prior knowledge of their opponents’ capabilities. The PCs can attempt the normal Recall Knowledge checks to identify their foes’ abilities prior to the beginning of the encounter. They may attempt these checks using Culture or an appropriate Profession skill instead, using the same DCs.</p>
                  <p><strong>Creatures</strong>: The three holographic colossi the PCs face are inspired by the popular holovid, <em>Kaiju Riot 3: The Doom from Beyond</em>. The three kaiju begin the encounter near the edges of the map and have a single goal in mind: destroy the orb at the center of the monument the PCs are protecting. The colossi act well as a team, contrary to their adversarial roles in <em>Kaiju Riot 3</em>. King Gadrakor relies on its roar and fearsome presence to throw the PCs off, while Gadrakor tries to draw them away from the monument or take them out with its breath weapon. Mechagadrakor is the key to their strategy. If nobody attacks Mechagadrakor, it moves adjacent to the monument and spends the next two turns attacking the orb. The other two eventually attempt the same tactic until the PCs target them with attacks. All three colossi fight until they are destroyed.</p>

                  <p><strong>Development</strong>: The orb has 100 Hit Points. If it takes enough damage to reduce it to 0 or below, the orb is destroyed and the simulation ends in failure. If the PCs manage to defeat their foes, the simulation ends in victory the moment the last Gadrakor falls and the opening chords to Jollys Vass’ triumphant <em>Don’t Fall</em>start to play.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                  <p>If the PCs successfully protect the orb, when the simulation ends they are formally offered spots in the NVDF’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Battlegroup as huzkar recruits. The next step in their training will be piloting brand new Apex mechs! If the simulation ends in failure, the PCs can enter remedial training before attempting the placement exam again, or accept positions in Valko Support, Infantry, Tank command groups, or even as Skywatch air support pilots. At this point, the group is ready to level up once more and begin their <em>Mechageddon! </em>campaign.</p>

                  <p>Of course, this book had its own crew in the form of wonderful writers and designers who each brought a taste of the wild to the project and were sure to keep the writers’ room well supplied with animal gifs and links to nature documentaries.

                  <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h3>
                  <p>When James pitched <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, I was immediately hooked! I want to bring a sense of embodiment to TTRPGs so that players and GMs have tools to understand what it might be like to live in a world so fantastic, so I was looking forward to focusing an Attenborourgh-style lens on Golarion’s natural world. While working on my sections—the athamaru ancestry, holdfast, some of the big game siege weapons, and the Warden of Caverns and Burrows—I hoped to make the world seem fantastical from its skies to its lowest depths. This book is going to be a great tool as I continue to run my own games and design adventures, and I can't wait to see how everyone uses it in their games.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Chris Bissette (he/they)</h3>
                  <p>Hello! I'm Chris Bissette, a game designer from the UK. Writing for Pathfinder has been a dream of mine for over a decade at this point, and I'm delighted to have finally had the opportunity on <em>Howl of the Wild</em>. Monsters were my first love in RPGs and getting to put together the dischorans for this book was some of the most fun I've had writing games.</p>
                  <p>When I'm not writing for Pathfinder, I can usually be found working on my free and very imaginatively titled dungeon crawler <a href="https://loottheroom.itch.io/a-dungeon-game">A Dungeon Game</a>. On socials, you can find me on Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/loottheroom.bsky.social">@loottheroom.bsky.social</a>.</p>

                  <h3>Jeremy Blum (he/him)</h3>
                  <p>I wrote the ostilli host archetype for <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, the anti-behemoth weaponry (anybody catch the Godzilla reference in there?), and the decapod dinghy, which is basically Catbus as a giant crab. Contributing to this wonderful celebration of nature's finest offerings was a nice shift, as it immediately followed the work I did to redesign Linvarre for the <em>Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>, which should now be in everyone’s hands. I've also penned some rad stuff for the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> and have several unannounced Pathfinder contributions in the pipelines.</p>
                  <p>Outside of the Paizo sphere, my biggest project is <a href="https://www.threesailsstudios.com/mappamundirpg">Mappa Mundi: An Exploration + Ecology RPG</a> for Three Sails Studios, a small three-man company based in the UK. It's a TTRPG about mapping the wilderness, studying monsters like a biologist instead of fighting them, and returning the art of storytelling to a voiceless world. Our recently released playtest could be used in conjunction with <em>Howl of the Wild</em> to run a gorgeous, monster-observing campaign that spans Golarion and beyond, since the themes are quite similar! Mappa Mundi's full release will crowdfund in 2025, so if you're interested, please follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelGrotto">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pixelgrotto.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> for the latest news.</p>

                  <p>Hey folks! I’m Brite (pronounced Bright), a TTRPG freelancer and prop maker. You might have seen my recent Pathfinder Quest, <em>The Winter Queen’s Dollhouse</em>, among other works. I had a blast writing a narrative section for <em>Howl of the Wild</em> and trying to capture Baranthet’s unique voice. He is so inquisitive and adventurous, yet simultaneously levelheaded. I hope you all enjoy meeting the crew of the <em>Zoetrope</em> and all the other wonders hidden in this book. I also hope your players “enjoy” the marp and its adorable gold-eating habits.</p>
                  <p>When not writing for or playing games, I make and sell hand-crafted props and accessories for TTRPG, cosplay, and LARP.

                  <p>Hello, hello! I've been around the Paizo blog quite a bit this past year since joining the marketing team, but I'm super excited to be dropping myself into this blog—because <em>Howl of the Wild</em> is the first Pathfinder project I’ve ever written for! A thousand thanks to James Case for scooping me out of the river for this project and giving me an opportunity to work on Pathfinder. It's opened a number of doors for me, and I love getting to be a part of the game I love (and market, haha). For Howl, I worked on the hexmoth and the zoophonia muse, and I look forward to seeing what everyone does with the cool stuff in this book! Please feel free to @ me on socials about your Howl stuff. I want to see it!</p>

                  <h3>Matthew Fu (he/him)</h3>
                  <p>Hi everyone! I first wanted to say that it was a fantastic experience to be able to work on this project alongside so many other talented writers. Getting to see so much positive feedback on the creatures that I wrote (apothecary bee and hardhead mole) has already done numbers to lift my spirits, and seeing someone refer to my beastmaster feats as "swanky AF" really made my day. I wanted to give a quick shoutout to James Case and the rest of the Paizo team for having me on this project and allowing me to pour my heart and soul into this project. I can't wait to see what kind of characters my friends and the community at large come up with given the sheer quantity of high-quality work that can be found in this book.</p>
                  <p>Also, be sure to check out some of the other Pathfinder 2E material that I've written alongside other fantastic authors at <a href="https://www.eldritchosirisgames.com/">Eldritch Osiris Games</a>!</p>

                  <p>Hello everyone! I'm Steve Hammond, and I wrote a few beast items, the tardigrades, and had the distinct pleasure of writing the surki ancestry! They are the first ancestry I've written, and my time working on them was really special. The response to them so far has been great, and I can't wait to see more of the characters you create with them!</p>
                  <p>I'm not really on social media these days, but I pop up in a few books here and there. Most recently, I worked on <em>War of Immortals</em>. Thank you all for your lovely words and praise for the book. Everyone on this team did incredible work, and I cannot wait to work with them again.</p>

                  <h3>Dustin Knight (he/him)</h3>
                  <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! I'm Dustin Knight, Starfinder developer and proud freelancer for the incredible tome of beasts and critters that lies before you! Working on the swarmkeeper archetype was a blast and fulfilled one of my long-time bucket-list entries of designing an insect-themed archetype. While I've yet to incorporate my own swarm of creepy-crawlies, I'm a big fan of bugs, especially bees! If you'd like to help your local pollinators, you can find resources such as Lawns to Legumes that can help turn your yard into a pollinator's paradise.</p>
                  <p>I also wrote some of the spells in <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, including <em>antlion trap</em>, <em>summon stampede</em>, and <em>summon warden of the wild</em>. You can catch me on dozens of different Paizo-adjacent Discord servers, including my own for <a href="https://discord.com/invite/JBERvMFVtJ">Pathfinder Infinite creators and fans</a> under the username KitsuneWarlock. You can also catch me at PaizoCon on the Paizo Events Discord where I'll be answering questions, posting memes, and participating in some panels! I'd love to answer as many of your questions as I can and hear about the insects you'll be using with your future swarmkeepers!</p>

                  <p>Greetings and salutations! This was my first ever TTRPG writing experience, and I’m so grateful to James Case and the whole team for their support. I had the unique privilege of writing up the <em>Zoetrope</em>’s design and seeing it be brought to life by the artists was an incredible experience I’ll never forget. Working with Paizo really set the standard for what I expect as a freelance writer. I can’t wait for everyone to get their hands on this special book.</p>
                  <p>I’m currently working on some other TTRPG projects, all of which will be announced in time on <a href="https://twitter.com/carpechristi">Twitter</a>. You can find me at @carpechristi on all socials. In the meantime, I love streaming TTRPG Actual Plays with my friends (which, let’s be real, are just paid opportunities to flirt with each other), collecting special edition novels, and crocheting absurdly long scarves.</p>

                  <p>Howdy! I'm Jonathan, and I wrote the rumindrol and the beast guns for <em>Howl of the Wild</em>! This book was my first experience writing for Pathfinder and Paizo in general, and I'm happy to say I thoroughly enjoyed the creative spirit and collaborative nature of working on this book alongside so many talented people! I hope you use the rumindrol to remind players who think nothing of stepping into the dark, forbidden places of the world that there is a reason we fear the unknown, and I hope that the beast guns help you attain the gunslingin', yeehawin', fantasy-anime-nonsense vibes so many of us enjoy. You can find me nerding out and/or yeehawing over on <a href="https://twitter.com/ry0masa">Twitter</a> (I will never call it anything else) or reach out through my <a href="https://ryomasa.carrd.co/">website</a>.</p>

                  <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3>
                  <p>Здравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m a Russian-speaking Ukrainian-American historian, educator, and author. I’m also a Pathfinder author of long standing—if you’ve suffered at the hands of a kholo, been lost in the <em>Dark Archive</em>, or had to dodge a laser-bear, that is my fault. I regret nothing.</p>
                  <p>In this particular venture, I was responsible for writing the merfolk ancestry, the sky fisher, and the character of my beloved buggy protégé, Ten. The merfolk ancestry was a particularly interesting challenge—usually, the trick with ancestries is filling them out, but here, we had a veritable buffet of myth, legend, and pop culture to choose from. If you want to weep tears of pearl, lure sailors to their doom with your voice, or merely stroll down the harbor walk with your new pair of legs, <em>Howl of the Wild</em> has you covered.</p>
                  <p>And if you like the sky fisher, well, would you like to know where you can find even more horrific beasties? It just so happens that I am also the creative director for the Luminant Age Campaign Setting, and we have a small bestiary of vampire dogs and teleporting rats over at <a href="https://luminant-age.itch.io/">https://luminant-age.itch.io/</a>. Check it out!</p>

                  <h3>Kai Revius (he/they)</h3>
                  <p>Hello everyone! I’m Kai, and contributing to the <em>Howl of the Wild</em> team as a freelancer was my first foray into professional writing. I had a blast and hope to do it again in the future!</p>
                  <p>It was my joy and privilege to help bring Dr. Gulnara Pom to life, as well as provide some new animal companions, beast armor, and beast armaments. As a child, I was heavily influenced by Brian Jacques’ <em>Redwall</em> series and jumped at the opportunity to create my very own badger. As a Forever DM/GM, my approach for the items and animal companions was to provide players with interesting or surprising things that I would love to see at my own table. Personally, I’m looking forward to seeing art of a giraffe in full barding or anything flying squirrel related! As far as items go, my favorite was a particularly stinky maul. I love when I can utilize a piece of equipment for roleplaying! The best place to find me is <a href="https://twitter.com/KeenKoala">@KeenKoala</a> on Twitter/X.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Simone D. Sallé (she/they)</h3>
                  <p>Hi, fellow nature enthusiasts! I'm so excited for you all to tag along with Baranthet and the crew of the <em>Zoetrope</em> on their quest for the wardens of the wild. This has been my favorite book to work on so far, both as a writer and an edit lead, and I can't wait for everyone else to dive in (or burrow, if that's more your Speed). In addition to co-creating Baranthet with James, I got to write Baranthet's narrative introduction, conclusion, and the climactic chapter of the crew's adventure! I also upheld my contractual obligation to seed mushrooms into everything I do by way of the primal witch patrons. There are such fun new creatures, lore, and player options in this book, and I know I'm not the only one ready to build at least six new PCs.</p>
                  <p>I'm difficult to track down on social media these days, but you can always send notes to Almas University, c/o Baranthet Zamendi—he'll know where to find me.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3>
                  <p>Hello! I’m Kendra, frequent freelancer for Paizo (credits at <a href="https://klspeedling.com/">klspeedling.com</a>). For <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, I did the bio for Charikleia, the Techniques and Tricks story, the sharks (my favorite ocean creatures!), and the Warden of Peaks and Skies.</p>
                  <p>When writing, I had to decide the type of contest to choose the new warden. A sky race made sense for flying creatures, but I didn’t want it to be that straightforward. I thought about what qualities the wardens might value, and one that jumped out to me was the interconnection of the natural world; while nature can be harsh and unforgiving, nothing within it exists in isolation, and I felt the wardens would be mindful of that. Maybe the true test would be the candidates’ willingness to aid others and accept help in turn. I wondered if it was too trite, too saccharine. But I decided that if I often need the reminder that assistance isn’t cheating or failure, just a part of existence, well… maybe someone else might need that, too.</p>
                  <p>The storm’s rough out there. Help others fly if you can, and don’t begrudge yourself the need to shelter under someone else’s wing for a while.</p>

                  <h3>Kyle Tam</h3>
                  <p>Hello everyone! I'm Kyle, a writer from the Philippines, and this is my first time writing for Paizo! For this book, I had the pleasure of introducing everyone to your favorite navigator, Lythea, and writing the thunder snake! I've written my own tabletop RPGs as well as writing for other people’s games, and I've also published my fair share of short stories, all of which you can find at <a href="https://whatkylewrites.carrd.co/">https://whatkylewrites.carrd.co/</a>.</p>
                  <p>I LOVE mermaids, so it is with absolute joy that I took on the task of bringing Lythea to life! She's basically the kind of character I'd love to play in a campaign of exploration, at one with the land, sea, and sky thanks to adaptive technologies giving her the best of all worlds. The thunder snake concept came to me by looking at electrical cords and adjustable lamps, watching the way coils and wires moved—so you can imagine it like a giant electrical plug!</p>
                  <p>Thank you so much for supporting <em>Howl of the Wild</em>!!!</p>

                  <h3>Ruvaid Virk</h3>
                  <p>Good day, friends! Ruvaid Virk, sometimes Paizo contributor, here. It's so wild that they keep letting me on these books, but I'm super grateful for it. First, I'd like to say how proud I am to have contributed to this cool book alongside other fantastic authors. Field biology was one of my favorite undergrad classes, and seeing this book come together has brought me an untold amount of joy. Only one thing could make this better for me, and that's if all of you would share your favorite parts of the book. Now, maybe you're wondering, "That's cool, Ruvaid, but what did you work on?"</p>
                  <p>Surprise, dear reader, for I have seeded a trail to answer that very question—one that can be found by tracing steps back through these sentences of mine.</p>
                  <p>That's right, it was the griffon section! Well, that, and some of the beast armaments and alchemical items.</p>
                  <p>I hope you guys enjoy this awesome book. There's a ton of cool things in here that I can't wait to play with for myself.</p>
                  <p>Should you want to know more about me or my works, you can follow me on the bird site at <a href="https://twitter.com/Darth_Ruvaider">@Darth_Ruvaider</a> or the sky site <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/darthruvaider.bsky.social">@darthruvaider.bsky.social</a>.

                  <p>Hello! I’m Andrew, Paizo’s digital products lead and contributor to such projects as <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>Rage of Elements</em>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02jo3?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-201-Pactbreaker">the first volume of an Adventure Path</a> that just so happens to go <b>great</b> with all of the new character options you’ll find in <em>Howl of the Wild</em>! For this book, I had the amazing opportunity to write a bunch of weird new alchemical items, the ethereal wildlife section, six new dinosaurs, and the werecreature archetype. I absolutely loved working on this project, and I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to the designers who not only gave me all these awesome assignments but who also let me put a devil T-Rex that shoots unholy fire beams out of its eyes into their nature book.</p>

                  <p>Under surprising new leadership, the Wildwood Lodge begins a campaign of violence. Shocked, the PCs and their allies form a new lodge in exile to oppose this new regime.

If the PCs are to prevail, they will need to track down one of the Verduran Forest’s most dangerous inhabitants and convince her to aid their cause—or ensure she cannot aid their enemy.</p>

                  <p>For years, Zo (the city) and Zo! (the bombastic undead media mogul) have been engaged in a legal dispute over their shared name. Finally, both parties have agreed to a trial on the planet of Triaxus to put the matter to rest for good. In a bold move, Zo! calls in a favor from the Starfinder Society, requisitioning a team of Starfinders to represent him in the trial. Make your case to the jury, ready your counterargument, participate in a trial by combat against a team of crack combat-lawyers, and smile for the camera in the live broadcast of the decade!</p>

                  <p>Poorer citizens of Kaer Maga, the City of Strangers, have been going missing, and while many think they've simply left to emigrate to New Thassilon, a purported haven for outcasts, an independent journalist feels that there's something unsavory going on. Kaer Maga doesn't have much in the way of authorities, and those who hold any power aren't taking her seriously, so she's turned to the Pathfinder Society. The PCs need to figure out what's going on, and if it is unsavory, perhaps put a stop to it.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">The Infinite Masters Program with <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/browse.php?filters=100178_0_0_0_0_0_0&amp;src=paizoconinfiniteblog">Pathfinder Infinite</a> and <a href="https://www.starfinderinfinite.com/browse.php?filters=100178_0_0_0_0_0_0&amp;src=paizoconinfiniteblog">Starfinder Infinite</a> is a group of skilled and incredibly creative individuals. Over the years, the Infinite Masters have provided some of the best-in-class titles to pair with your adventures.</p>
                  <p><em>“One of my greatest joys each month is getting to write a blog showcasing the top performing and newest releases on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite. The Infinite creators have such amazing ideas, and I’m always looking forward to what they’re cooking up next.” –</em>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe) | Marketing &amp; Media Specialist</p>
                  <p>The Infinite Masters Program is currently by invitation only; DriveThru and Paizo take suggestions from the community about who would be great fits for the program. Infinite Masters offer support to one another, giving suggestions and constructive criticism, and fostering collaboration that has been part of our best sellers in recent years.</p>
                  <p><em>“Despite the vast amount of content for Pathfinder and Starfinder we generate at Paizo, our long production timelines and resource limitations mean that we can neither be as nimble or prolific as our community sometimes demands. Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite allow the community to meet their own demands for MOAR! and with much more responsive timelines. Seeing the professional and inspired creations of the Infinite community are a great joy, and provide an incredible amount of encouragement to all of us here at Paizo.”</em> –Mark Moreland (he/him) | Director of Brand Strategy</p>
                  <p>There is no end to the Infinite community’s imagination; Masters continue to surprise us with every single release. The group has grown since its inception, with new creators invited every few months. They generate some of the coolest content to pair with your Pathfinder and Starfinder adventures and we’re grateful for not only their creativity, but their willingness to be so communicative and open about their hopes about the program.</p>
                  <p>While this is only a handful of Infinite Masters in this Infinite Masters Spotlight, we hope that you check out all the Infinite Masters and take their incredible releases with you on your next journey!</p>

The Godsrain Contingencies were inspired by the Godsrain Prophecies released in the lead up to the War of Immortals. I already wished I could do something for the event but knew I had to wait for materials—but then this stellar story by Erin Roberts came out.

                  <p>Originally designated “Pacific/Asian American Heritage Week” in 1977, AANHPI Month was codified into the American calendar of holidays and heritage months in 1992. Each year, the Federal Asian Pacific American Council (FAPAC) dedicates a new theme for AANHPI Month, giving a focal point to how we celebrate the contributions of Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders. The theme of this year’s AANHPI Month is “Advancing Leaders Through Innovation.”</p>
                  <p>According to the FAPAC press release, this theme “pays homage to the visionaries and trailblazers who have shaped our AANHPI history and continue to influence our collective future.” Anyone can help uplift these current and future leaders by supporting organizations that foster AANHPI creatives, support AANHPI mental health, and provide opportunities to AANHPI youth. The following list is non-exhaustive, but a good start for people looking to volunteer or donate:</p>

                  <h3>Valko Derby — CR (varies)</h3>
                  <p>Valkopods—more often called mech pods in the Pact Worlds—are specialty game consoles found at high-end arcades, military recruitment centers, trade shows, and in the homes of some affluent collectors. The 6-foot half-globe pods are constructed of durable plastics with transparent aluminum and structural steel frames. The pods are programmed to simulate the experience of being in the cockpit of a mech, starship, or other war vehicle. Hyper-realistic terrain and foes generated by the simulation provide a challenge for the operator, and the simulation provides a score based on the operator’s reactions and maneuvers.</p>
                  <p>Valkpods aren’t just for fun. A form of this technology is used for military training in the Pact Worlds, Veskarium, and on Daimalko, where the tech was initially tested. Networking connections allow many pods to sync simulations for large-scale experiences while the simulated feeds are broadcast to viewing terminals, betting houses, and infosphere sites. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene.</p>

                   <p>Holos blast a hypercolored message above a row of globular arcade cabinets, each large enough for a person of any conceivable anatomy to fit comfortably inside. “Mech pods—Play Now!” The signs repeating flash is accompanied by booming music and the roar of simulated laser cannons. A humanoid pilot dressed in a red and white suit stands outside the massive cabinets. A crowd of excited people bustle around her. “Hey there! Ever ride in a mech before?” She calls. “Now’s your chance. Our sponsor, Apex, installed this set of networked valkopods—you call them mech pods in the Pact Worlds. Apex engineers programmed a special simulation just for today: A demolition derby! Want to play?”</p>

                  <p><strong>Resa "Firefight"&nbsp;Prosst</strong> (LN female ifrit) is a decorated pilot. After acing her training, she was promoted quickly to squad leadership and earned a role as DCVG (Deputy Commander Valko Group) of the 3rd Battlegroup of the New Valor Defense Force, a military sworn to protect the city of New Valor from rampaging colossi. She’s not just here for public relations—she’s tasked with recruiting high-scoring players to join up with the NVDF.</p>
                  <p>On Daimalko, huzkars (the local name for mech pilots) are minor celebrities as well as military personnel. Most Daimalkans regard mech pilots as heroes since many are injured or even perish defending cities from colossi, terrifying monsters that move through populated settlements like unstoppable forces of nature. Without mechs, Daimalko would be unlivable; in fact, the entire planet was decimated by the colossi’s first emergence many years ago. Rebuilding has only been possible because of organizations like the NVDF.</p>
                  <h3>Derby Rules</h3>
                  <p>Once the derby program loads, the PCs find themselves virtually piloting humanoid-shaped Daimalkan mechs within a massive digital stadium divided into zones by glowing markings. Each team begins the match in the goal zone that matches their team’s colors. The PCs are blue and begin in the southern zone. Enemy players’ mechs are red and begin in the northern zone.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the starting siren sounds, the teams can move around the map and engage their foes. Roll initiative to determine the order in which players and enemies act. Teams score points in two ways. If a mech makes it to the opposing goal, the pilot scores 2 points for their team. If a pilot scores a final blow on an enemy mech (destroying it), they score 4 points for their team. If a mech is destroyed, it cannot score points even if it is already inside the enemy goal, and that player (PC or enemy) is out of the battle for the remainder of the match. During the match, a glowing holographic display above the simulated stadium displays each team’s current score. Once all mechs on one team have been defeated or six rounds have passed, the match ends. The entire field glows in the winning team’s colors as a victory celebration and final scores are displayed.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Map:</strong> This simulation uses the digital side of <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Stadium</em>. One square on the map represents 10 feet to accommodate the Huge combatants. The programmed terrain simulates a massive sports arena. Once the match begins, the tiered bleachers are filled with a simulated audience. Any mech that moves into (or is forced into) spaces outside the play area and into the crowd suffers an automatic system failure based on the chart found in <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution </em>page 114. Enemy mechs forced into the crowd are staggered until they return to the play area.</p>
                  <p>The glowing circle in the middle of the arena temporarily boosts a mech’s movement speed. Whenever a mech begins its turn inside the circle, the mech’s base speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
                  <p><strong>PCs and Mechs:</strong> This encounter is designed for four 1st-level characters. The mech pods are programmed to use simulated representations of dozens of different mechs, but for this program, all players use the same type of mech: the duello class valko. For the duration of the simulation, the PCs’ mechs have blue glowing stripes to differentiate them from their opponents, which are red. If you’d prefer to adapt the simulation for different mech models, the PCs can instead build tier 1 mechs using the rules in <em>Tech Revolution</em>.</p>
                  <p>The basic duello class mech is detailed below.</p>
                  <h3>Duello Class Valko — Tier 1</h3>
                  <p>Huge skirmisher<br><strong>Operators</strong> 1; <strong>PP</strong> 1 (2/turn, max 6)<br><strong>Speed</strong> 60 ft.<br><strong>Senses</strong> blindsense (vibration) 30 ft., darkvision 120 ft., low-light vision</p>
                  <p><strong>DEFENSE</strong><br><strong>HP </strong>19; <strong>SP</strong> 5; <strong>Hardness</strong> 0<br><strong>EAC</strong> 19; <strong>KAC</strong> 20<br><strong>Fort</strong> +3; <strong>Ref</strong> +4<br><strong>Immunities</strong> construct immunities</p>
                  <p><strong>OFFENSE</strong><br><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong> +8<br><strong>Melee</strong> scythe (upper limb—1d6+5 S)<br><strong>Ranged</strong> laser rifle (frame—1d6+1 F; critical burn), missile battery (frame—1d4+1 F&amp;P)<br><strong>Space</strong> 15 ft.; <strong>Reach</strong> 15 ft. (20 ft. with scythe)<br><strong>Strength</strong> +4</p>
                  <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> The simulation always pits teams against their each other in even numbers. So, for each PC, one opposing duello mech appears with red glowing stripes inside the opposing goal. The enemy mechs are piloted by other players in their own valkopods networked together with the PC’s valkopods.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the sirens denote the start of the derby, the two duello opponents on the outside edges of the opposing team run up the sides of the arena. They intend to get to the blue goal as fast as possible and lend fire support to their allies from there. The remaining enemy mechs choose individual targets, focusing on PCs who lead the charge across the arena. They use up as much ammo as possible from a distance before switching to scythes for melee combat. All enemy mechs fight until destroyed.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Red Team Duello Mech — CR 1</h3>
                  <p>XP 400<br>
                    N Huge construct<br><strong>Init </strong>+2; <strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; <strong>Perception</strong> +5<br><strong>DEFENSE HP</strong> 20</p>
                  <p><strong>EAC </strong>12;<strong> KAC </strong>14<br><strong>Fort </strong>+1; <strong>Ref</strong> +1; <strong>Will</strong> -1<br><strong>Immunities</strong> construct immunities</p>
                  <p><strong>OFFENSE<br></strong><strong>Speed </strong>60 ft.<br><strong>Melee</strong> scythe +9 (1d6+5 S)<br><strong>Ranged</strong> laser rifle +6 (1d6+1 F; critical burn 1d4) or missile launcher +6 (1d4+1 F&amp;P)<br><strong>Space</strong> 15 ft.; <strong>Reach</strong> 15 ft. (20 ft. with scythe)</p>
                  <p><strong>STATISTICS<br></strong><strong>Str</strong> +4; <strong>Dex</strong> +2; <strong>Con</strong> -; <strong>Int</strong> +1; <strong>Wis</strong> +0; <strong>Cha</strong> +0<br><strong>Skills</strong> Athletics +10, Piloting +5<br><strong>Languages</strong> Common<br><strong>Other Abilities</strong> unliving</p>
                  <p><strong>Development</strong>: If either team moves all surviving mechs into the opposing goal zone, the simulation ends and that team wins. If either team defeats every enemy mech, they win by default. If both teams end the derby with an equal number of combatants in the opposing goal, the simulation resets, allowing all players to return and try again.</p>
                  <p>When the match ends, the PCs exit their valkopods and notice a crowd watching a holovid of their match. Firefight’s eyes are intent on the screen as she takes notes on a datapad. She gets the PCs’ attention as soon as she notices them.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>GREETINGS HUZKAR! YOU HAVE BEEN RECRUITED BY THE NEW VALOR DEFENSE FORCE</h3>
                  <p>Firefight takes note of players who show enthusiasm and skill during the simulated battles. She sees the PCs’ potential and eagerly tries to recruit them. If the PCs beat their opponents, she plays to their egos, praising them and saying that “New Valor needs your help,” or “all of Daimalko is in danger!” If they lost the match, she asks if they’d like another shot at winning, but “for real this time.” She answers the PCs’ questions about her organization, explaining that they’re a military corps who defend the city of New Valor from colossi attacks. They’re based on the distant planet Daimalko (unless the PCs begin this encounter on Daimalko, they’ll need to take a shuttle there for further training). If the PCs are interested in joining, she sets up an appointment for them at a nearby recruiting office where they can fill out formal applications and complete their physical assessment.</p>
                  <h3>VALKO DERBY COMPETITIVE PLAY</h3>
                  <p>If players are interested in using the Valko Derby rules for PVP matches, replace the NPC mechs with even teams of players. If there’s an odd number of players, include an NPC to fill the empty slot.</p>
                  <p><strong>Map:</strong> Firefight specifically programmed this Valko Derby to reference her love of the sport kaijuball, but any map can be holographically recreated for a battle. Throwing in cover and level-appropriate hazards or traps isn’t just an option, it’s encouraged!</p>
                  <p><strong>Mechs:</strong> The duello class valkos are perfect mechs for low-level PCs, but if your players want to customize their own, build mechs appropriate to the average level of the PCs using the rules in<em> Tech Revolution</em>. Both sides should build their mechs with the same amount of Mech Points in their pool and should limit movement to ground based for a fair challenge.</p>

                  <p>Well, good news! We’ve got a slate of errata for you. Right about now, you should find some new entries over at <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq">https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq</a> for <em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Firebrands</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. I’ll let you read those entries to see the specifics, but some highlights include a broad update in the <em>Ancestry Guide</em> entry for re-standardizing the flight feats of certain ancestries like sprites and strix to bring them more in line with the new standard we’ve set for ancestries with inherent flight following the Remaster. We’ve also got a swath of minor updates to combination weapons to align with the new standard set by the swap function of the Interact action in the Remaster, and some much requested clarifications for <em>Rage of Elements</em>.</p>

                  <p>This also marks the beginning of a return to normalcy for us following the flurry of activity around the OGL events of last year and the need for us to pivot to the Remaster project and the introduction of the ORC license. With all of that in the rearview mirror and a clear road leading into a bright blue horizon ahead, we’re looking to get back on track for the annual errata cycle we had announced right before those plans got altered. As part of this pivot, we want to set some clear expectations for what the future we’re working toward is going to look like for FAQs and errata.</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li><strong>Hardcover Rulebooks: </strong>This includes books like <em>Player Core</em>, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>Rage of Elements</em>, etc. Our goal for this product line is for it to receive two errata and FAQ cycles per year on an as-needed basis, one in the spring/summer and one in the fall/winter. This current drop is the spring/summer cycle, so you can expect one more errata update before the end of the year!</li>
                   <li><strong>Lost Omens Books: </strong>This line of books will receive one errata and FAQ update cycle per year on an as-needed basis, coinciding with one of the two hardcover rulebook cycles.</li>
                   <li><strong>Adventures: </strong>Our Adventure Path line is a monthly periodical and the player content produced in it is intended for use with the associated adventures. The standard for player content presented in adventures is that it is of uncommon or rare rarity and directly tied to the story it is presented with; using this content outside of the associated adventure inherently requires GM review and approval (or appropriate sanctioning for use in Pathfinder Society organized play). We do not currently have any plans at this time to include adventure content in a scheduled errata cycle. We may still do errata around particular reprints, such as when compiling an adventure for a hardcover release.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>So, that’s our roadmap for the errata and FAQs going forward! If you’re planning on playing some Pathfinder Society games at PaizoCon, make sure to check for any updates your character might have received!</p>
                  <p>Catch you next time!</p>

                  <p><em>Most people take life too seriously, and you want to change that. Your muse may be a great comedian, someone who can effortlessly lift the spirits of those around them, or even the concept of humor itself. Art inspired by a vaudevillian muse is often absurdist and irreverent, though it can also contain biting satire or scathing criticism of the powers that be.</em></p>
                  <p><em>As a bard with a vaudevillian muse, you support your allies by lifting their spirits and combat adversaries with lighthearted antics.</em></p>
                  <p><em>This new muse adds seven new feats allow you to make pratfalls, modify casting certain spells, and find hilarious new ways to mock your enemies while the three new focus spells will really leave your foes with pie on their faces!</em></p>

                  <p>Greetings Pathfinders!</p>
                  <p>This month we’re heading out west, with one scenario set in Kaer Maga, a place we haven’t been for some time, and another off the coast in waters near the Ironbound Archipelago.</p>
                  <p>To start off, it seems poorer citizens of Kaer Maga, the City of Strangers, have been going missing, and while many think they've simply left to emigrate to New Thassilon, a purported haven for outcasts, an independent journalist, Nellie Bow, feels that there's something unsavory going on. She’s found her investigation hampered by rumors spread by an unknown party. Without any other options, she's turned to the Pathfinder Society. It’ll be up to you to figure out what’s going on, and put a stop to anyone taking advantage of any desperate dreamers in the City of Strangers.</p>

                  <p>Meanwhile, our next scenario has its roots beginning years ago, with the return of Xin Edasseril from its exile outside of time. A ship off the coast of the reappearing city was somehow caught up in the eddies of released time. Though it’s been years, rumors have slowly spread and the Pathfinder Society has heard reports of a ship sighted over and over, apparently following the same path before vanishing each week. This is that same unfortunate ship. It seems it is somehow stuck in time, repeating the same week over and over. The crew has tried everything to escape this fate, and gave up years of the same week ago. You must find a way to return things to normal and save the crew from an eternity of this single week.</p>

                  <p></p>Commander Vadien “Raptor” Wano (LN male damai soldier) acts as commanding officer for the PCs and Tempest Squadron during their training and throughout their careers as huzkars—the Daimalkan name for a mech pilot or operator. Raptor is a seasoned huzkar, having piloted his mech against colossi and on mercenary missions in local systems. He was one of the first pilots selected for the launch of the program that became the New Valor Defense Force. Raptor is one of eight huzkars who fought every skirmish in the Month of Fire campaign and survived.

                  <h3>THE ENEMY</h3>
                  <p>Daimalko has been under attack by colossi—the Daimalkan name for kaiju, or giant monsters—for generations since the Awakening devastated the planet. Colossi come in a variety of forms, some more vicious and destructive than others. Recently, there seem to be more frequent attacks; something is causing aggressive behaviors to increase across species of colossi. Perhaps finding the cause will give your heroes an upper hand in the battle to save Daimalko?</p>

                  <h3><strong>THE TECH</strong></h3>
                  <p><em><br></em>But Raptor doesn’t expect you to fight alone! Throughout this campaign, you level up two characters: your hero and your mech—known on Daimalko as a valko! Eventually, you might add a starship form to that list. Most encounters in<em>Mechageddon!</em> are designed for mechs, but there are plenty of opportunities to show off your pilot’s abilities, too.</p>
                  <p>Everyone begins with a basic mech, choosing one of the lynkor models provided by the NVDF or a fully custom version if you prefer. Check out the <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/240503_PZO7253_Mechageddon_PlayersGuide.pdf"><em>Mechageddon! Player’s Guide</em></a> for more information about creating a hero, choosing a mech, and picking a callsign and squad name!</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">Hiya, Starfinders! It’s Jenny Jarzabski, Starfinder Senior Developer and Sparkly Space Princess. It’s no secret that <em>Mechageddon!</em> was my dream project, but I’m not the only one who feels that way. A group of amazing authors teamed up to make this project a reality, much like the squad of mech pilots you’ll be playing in your <em>Mechageddon!</em> campaign. What we created together is special not just because of its epic story, unforgettable characters, gorgeous art, high CR encounters, and new rules content; it’s special because the whole team is so passionate about <em>Mechageddon!</em> and poured their hearts and souls into its creation.</p>
                  <p>This passion was evident in the extracurricular hangouts, playtests, and planning meetings the authors scheduled with and without me. To prepare for the writing phase, the writing team got together for a few movie nights. We watched a lot of epic anime and cheesy 80s movies, bonding over our shared passion for mecha media. It was important to us to highlight certain tropes and themes, and our time together created synergy between the adventures and backmatter articles. But don’t worry, <em>Mechageddon!</em>isn’t all anime sparkles and action movie schlock. (Not 100%, anyway.) The authors each brought their own perspectives to the project, pulling inspiration from their lived experiences, favorite media, and more.</p>
                  <p>On the surface, a tabletop campaign like <em>Mechageddon!</em> is a fun way to pass the time playing a game with your friends. But for many of us, it’s also a way to escape our problems and worries for a few hours. The magic of tabletop storytelling is that it can be a way to explore our dreams, desires, and fears in a safe setting, or a way to play out scenarios that imagine better worlds or tell cautionary tales of timelines gone wrong. In that respect, <em>Mechageddon!</em> can be whatever you want it to be, but here’s what it means to us.</p>

                  <h3>Joseph Blomquist (he/him)<br>
                    Adventure 1 Author</h3>
                  <p>I was ten years old, the ideal age for mecha indoctrination, when <em>Robotech</em> hit American shores. Sure, I’d already enjoyed Americanized anime in <em>Battle of the Planets, Voltron</em>, and <em>Tranzor Z</em>, but <em>Robotech</em> was different. For the first time, there was character-driven, dramatic storytelling in an animated show about alien attacks and giant robot combat, and halfway through the first season, my favorite character died! This was a big change for cartoons in the states, and I was sold—hook, line, and sinker.</p>
                  <p>From there, my media interests changed. I immersed myself in the anime that were the basis of <em>Robotech: Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, Genesis Climber Mospeada,</em> and most importantly, <em>Super Dimension Fortress Macross</em>. My interests grew to encompass the <em>Fang of the Sun Dougram</em> and <em>Gundam</em>. While my friends identified with their heroes from He-man, GI Joe, and Thundercats, my tastes involved giant robots piloted by the types of heroes that propaganda movies could be made about. And don’t even get me started on kaiju!</p>
                  <p>My interest in games followed suit with a love of <em>BattleTech</em>, <em>Mekton</em>, and <em>Heavy Gear</em> taking up a great deal of my playtime. So, when my D20-based RPG of choice began building towards mecha stories, I knew I wanted to be a part of it. But I was lucky; I’d already written for Starfinder, and I had been running games for Paizo Organized Play since the beginning—I was a known quantity. Regardless, when Jenny asked if I would be interested in contributing to the project, there was nothing that could have kept me away.</p>
                  <p><em>Mechageddon!</em> is one of the most fun projects I could ever have hoped to be a part of. For “research,” I watched a lot of movies, like <em>Pacific Rim</em> and <em>Robot Jox</em>, in addition to diving deep into some of the anime I’d missed over the years—especially the later <em>Macross</em> stuff (oh, how I missed you, <em>Macross</em>). There was a timely renewed interest in <em>BattleTech</em>, <em>Heavy Gear</em> got a new edition, and I had the opportunity to seed some of the tropes and brilliance of the shows I loved into my writing.</p>
                  <p><em>Mechageddon!</em> is a love letter to the anime, films, and media that came before it. The adventure is full of dramatic moments and enough giant robot combat to whet any appetite. It’s an adventure where the people you meet matter and where encounters are harrowing and full of meaning, dropping hints and plot points for the future. It’s like no Adventure Path you’ve seen before. For my part, I worked alongside two of the best authors in the Paizosphere, and the three of us even met outside of our shared server to put together something of a story bible to inform our tale that could seed dozens more adventures! I envy you, fearless reader, for the journey you will get to experience and the stories you will tell.</p>
                  <p>Until that day, New Valor stands!</p>
                  <p>Oh, and I can be found rarely ever writing on my <a href="http://www.underwearontheoutside.com/">blog</a>, or on social media under the name DoctorMono.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Dennis Muldoon (he/him)<br>
                   Adventure 2 Author</h3>
                  <p><em>Mechaggedon!</em> Oh, what a joy! Over the last few years, I’ve written for nearly every line Paizo publishes, but this is without a doubt the biggest, most challenging, and most exciting project I’ve ever worked on. I love how Starfinder allows us to tell so many different types of stories, and the mech rules are one of my favorite tools in the GM toolbox. My own love for mechs dates to my childhood watching <em>Transformers</em>, <em>Voltron</em>, and of course, that seminal classic, <em>Robot Jox</em>.</p>
                  <p>For <em>Mechaggedon!</em>, I wrote the middle volume, the space where the plucky heroes get to catch their breath after the initial rush, take stock of their new careers as mech pilots and heroes of New Valor, and find their place in the wider universe. What could go wrong? This volume presents the players with choices to make, opportunities to build relationships and earn allies, and space to truly make their mechs their own. I’m particularly proud of the variety of missions presented in this volume, as they draw inspiration from sources ranging from space operas to westerns to real-world corporate labor politics, before ultimately tying together to lead to something bigger. I can’t wait for you all to play it!</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)<br>
                    Adventure 3 Author</h3>
                  <p><br>
                   I wish I could sit down and tell you every little detail I included in my volume of&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em> However, since I wrote the final book, that mean sharing major spoilers for the plot. Since I can't do&nbsp;<em>that</em>, I'd instead talk about my inspirations!</p>
                  <p><em>Devilman</em>&nbsp;is one of the most influential works of art I've ever experienced. It is also deeply weird and even unenjoyable at points, with a complex lore and timeline that honestly hurts my head to think about too much. For my adventure, I drew much on what I found meaningful about&nbsp;<em>Devilman</em>, from its corruption narratives, to the feelings of apocalypse it conveys, to downright weird demon designs.&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>(at least my section) is also deeply informed by my experience as a queer person, my relationship to religion, and the strange ways that religion might function in a world where you could meet many of the gods. My volume is in part about trying to fight an apocalypse you don't want to be in, but also about what it means to want love from a god who will never love you back. In that way, it's also about work, and about how many people believe that a job you love can never love you back.</p>
                  <p>Mech stories are also tied into stories about bodies. I finished writing&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>the day before I underwent gender-affirming surgery. In my section, there's many kinds of bodies and relationships to them: kaiju bodies, bodies that have changed (positive), bodies that have changed (negative), big robot bodies, and more. You also may be thinking, "Wow, Rigby, that's doing a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>!" Well, yes—but this adventure is also a deep dive into the mech genre and will be hopefully played across hundreds of hours with your friends. Many of these things end up naturally intertwined. The demands on the body are often the demands of capitalism, or the demands of patriarchy, or the interpolation of white supremacy into our own desires.</p>
                  <p>Okay, okay, that's the big philosophy. It's also about punching demons while being in a mech suit, the relationship you have with other pilots, and saving the world! The point is this: it’s going to be fun,it's going to be big, and it's going to be a story you'll remember!</p>

                   Hello! I’m Kate Baker, and I can’t wait for you to experience <em>Mechageddon!</em> I couldn’t resist contributing to an Adventure Path that lets the PCs run around in giant mechs. What could be better? I enjoyed watching <em>Pacific Rim</em>, <em>Robot Jox</em>, and even the dubious <em>Robot Wars</em> (on MST3k) to get inspiration. I worked on backmatter, creating both a mech that you’ll encounter and a Side Job you can go do for some extra cash. Just don’t forget to bring your mechs! You can follow more about what I’m up to on BlueSky at @katebakerGM.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Mechs are rad.Anyone who’s known me for any amount of time knows that I am a mecha fan, so taking part in&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>was an opportunity I immediately jumped at. I can distinctly remember walking into a bookstore in New Orleans in 1995, seeing this cool mech book on the shelf, and realizing that <em>MechWarrior&nbsp;</em>was more than just a one-off of the distant past.&nbsp;Many years later, a resurgent&nbsp;<em>Macross’&nbsp;</em>newest series helped to remind me that everyone loves giant robots no matter what flavor they come in. They have a magic to them that can be used to tell unique stories and lift spirits. In that way,&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>was something of a dream come true to work on, especially as I was able to design new mechs and had the opportunity to bring the city of New Valor to life. I hope that what we’ve put together can lift your spirits, wherever you are, and help you to remember love as you strive to defend New Valor.</p>

                    Contributing Author</h3>
                  <p>Hey there! I'm Mikko, a cloud architect by day and a game designer when the stars come out. My journey as a Paizo freelancer began in 2014, and since then, I've left my creative mark on around 50 fantastic products. For&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em>, I wrote a Side Job in which you and your trusty mechs venture to a planet of dinosaurs. Get ready for high-speed thrills, breathtaking views of wind-kissed hills, steamy jungles, and fiery volcanoes, plus a hearty dose of head-banging riffs courtesy of Abysshead—the undisputed overlords of the Pact Worlds music scene. Hope you have a blast playing it!</p>
                  <p>My fascination with mechs and towering robots goes way back. My earliest influences came from shows like <em>Power Rangers</em> and <em>Transformers</em>, and who could forget that iconic moment when Ellen Ripley hops into a power loader and takes on a xenomorph queen? Legendary stuff. A newer fascination of mine is Scythe, a world that seamlessly weaves diesel-punk mechs into a reimagined 1920s setting.</p>
                  <p>Let me wrap up with a story. Flashback to 2017, when Paizo presented me with an intriguing challenge: writing an interactive special named&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom"><em>Assault on Absalom</em>&nbsp;</a>for the Pathfinder Society. One of the missions in that adventure involved unearthing an ancient weapon, and my imagination was on fire. What if this weapon took the form of a gargantuan construct? What if the players could pilot it, controlling distinct limbs and weapons? And so, Gulgamodh emerged—a sentinel that dutifully guarded Absalom and perhaps inspired the seeds of future mech wonders.</p>

                  <h3>Chris Wasko (he/him)<br>
                    Contributing Author</h3>
                  <p>I had a ton of fun writing an alien, a mech, and a Side Job for&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em> The first came easily after I found a video of a starfish walking along the beach. The creature's form was so familiar and yet so alien, so I thought of how I'd stat it if I turned it upside down and made it mech-sized. Considering its&nbsp;environment reminded me of the long history of otyughs as both violent monsters and a source of curious social encounters, a perfect fit for my armored junkyard behemoth. The latter two took some time, and ultimately became homages to my online Roll20 campaigns that withered as life got complicated.</p>
                  <p>My&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy94qz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-79-The-HalfDead-City"><em>Mummy's Mask</em>&nbsp;</a>campaign fell off right after Book 5, when the PCs encountered the flying pyramids of ancient Osirion. Not having those mythical structures as some form of airborne vehicle in the Starfinder setting's distant future struck me as a ripe design space, especially for a book about mechs. Meanwhile, my&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyFreeOrDie"><em>Fly Free or Die&nbsp;</em></a>campaign wound down in the middle of my own installment, <em>Crash and Burn</em>. The party was composed of eight people with variable schedules that usually led to split sessions of four PCs each, so I would write concurrent homebrew adventures alongside the published content so the two groups could swap stories offline. One of those original adventures involved an ecological mission to Osoro to study the irokirois, one of my favorite&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Alien Archive</em>&nbsp;</a>creatures, which&nbsp;I adapted into what appears in <em>Mechageddon!</em> I hope you enjoy our work!</p>

                    Contributing Authors</h3>
                  <p>Nick and Fox have been writing together since Nick Wasko won Paizo's RPG Superstar Season 9 contest. Nick inspired Fox's interest in Pathfinder and Starfinder, and together they enjoyed creating new mechs for this Adventure Path. Nick and Fox drew upon their backgrounds in health care for the&nbsp;idea of the Hecatomb, which draws upon the operator's life force to function. High-level characters have plenty of health, so sacrificing hit points to power a mech made a better thematic and mechanical fit for a high-risk, high-reward playstyle among low-level players.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, the Terrotodile started out as a thought experiment for mechs designed for purposes other than combat. Its original intent was to protect laborers mining for resources, but like so many inventions meant for the betterment of society, it was repurposed for battle. Nick and Fox enjoyed this opportunity to explore a departure from the high-powered war machines often seen in this genre. Since they’ve recently struggled to make time for tabletop gaming, they are especially excited for the opportunity to contribute to this project. You can find more of Nick's work with Paizo <a href="https://paizo.com/people/NickWasko">here</a>, or his academic&nbsp;writing <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=nicholas+wasko">here</a>.

                  <p style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve always enjoyed robots and mechs. I’ve been a huge <em>Transformers</em> fan since I was small, and I regularly build Gundam models (as well as watch the shows), so creating a mech was an opportunity I was excited for. I wanted to make something a little more unique, different from a robot with a theme. One of the best toy lines on the market, in my opinion, are the Diaclone Reboot figures. They’re super modular, so it’s easy to swap parts and make your own creations. I really like that, so I wondered: What if I could do that for a Starfinder mech? With that, the Mobile Disunion was born. Just like the Diaclone Reboot figures, the Mobile Disunion can be customized by players and their characters. Swap out the legs, the arms, the head—whatever you want! Like with a <em>Transformer</em>, you can even change the configurations in combat. I hope everyone enjoys playing with the Mobile Disunion as much as I enjoyed creating it (and playing with some of my toys while I did)!</p>

                    Narrative Lead and Contributing Author</h3>
                  <p><em>Mechageddon!</em> is a love letter to one of my favorite things in all the universe: mechs. But you knew that. Now listen up, because I’m about to tell you a secret! I wasn’t really into mechs growing up. I know, I know; it’s SACRILEGE! But listen, the mecha media in the United States at that time targeted a more masc audience, and I was more of a princesses and ponies type of kid. If Sailor Moon had summoned a sparkly mech and fired its moon tiara magic laser, I would’ve been all in, but alas, that wasn’t on offer at the time. It wasn’t until much later in life that I discovered the joy of mechs that transform and power up to catchy music using the power of friendship.</p>
                  <p>One day a friend showed me a video clip from what would become my favorite mecha anime, <em>Macross Delta</em>. In the video, a group of magical girls team up with military mech pilots to defend a city from an alien attack, and they do it by <em>singing</em>. I desperately wanted more context for this video, so I dove into the show headfirst. Fast-forward to now: I’ve become a <em>Macross</em>superfan, a player of <em>MechWarrior</em>, a builder of model kits, and an all-around mecha enjoyer.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>What really draws me to mechs, though? First and foremost, mecha as a concept is inherently both badass and ridiculous, and there’s as many wonderfully absurd gems out there as there are epic, grimdark treatises on the realities of war and the nature of humanity. But I’ve identified some themes most mecha media shares, regardless of where they fall on the spectrum from military drama to super sentai. I’m inspired by these themes of friendship, loyalty, courage, and hope in the face of doom. And who among us wouldn’t hop into a gigantic robot and help their friends save the world if they had the chance?</p>
                  <p>Now’s your chance!</p>
                  <p>I should clarify that we’re not actually saving <em>the</em> world, but that we are going to save a planet in a TTRPG adventure. And for the record, while saving the real world isn’t part of this campaign, I encourage you to do your best at that, too.</p>
                  <p><strong>From all of us on the writing team, we truly hope you enjoy the book we made for you! Use it well. </strong></p>

                  <h2>Programming</h2>
                  <p>We’ve got a handful of exciting on-site panels and live shows happening at Gen Con this year! For folks who can’t attend, these live events will be recorded and uploaded onto our YouTube channel after Gen Con.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.gencon.com/events/252097"><strong>A Drift Through Space-Time—Starfinder Second Edition Playtest Live Show</strong></a> <br><strong>Thursday, Aug 1st at 2:00pm EST<br></strong> Thurston Hillman, Creative Director of Starfinder, leads a party of Pathfinder AND Starfinder Second Edition heroes through an adventure that crosses the boundaries of space, time, and magic.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.gencon.com/events/255655"><strong>Starfinder Second Edition Roadmap Panel</strong></a><br><strong>Friday, Aug 2nd at 1pm EST</strong><br>
                    Join the Starfinder development team for a journey through the cosmos and a look into the future! This panel will reveal upcoming products in the Starfinder line as we embark on the exciting journey of Starfinder Second Edition!</p>

                    As we kickoff the Starfinder Playtest, the Starfinder development team presents a panel about what makes a good playtest! This panel will discuss how playtest rulebooks differ from standard releases, what makes for good playtest feedback, and how to get more involved.</p>
                  <p>On top of these on-site panels and events, Paizo will also be hosting a handful of panels on <a href="http://twitch.tv/officialpaizo">twitch.tv/officialpaizo</a>.

                  <br>
                  <h2>Gaming</h2>
                  <p>As always, all our gaming will take place in the Sagamore Ballroom! We’ve expanded our space from the previous few years, allowing us to squeeze in more game tables, a character creation station, a VTT demo area, and even a satellite booth!</p>
                  <p>You can view all our gaming offerings <a href="https://www.gencon.com/events?host=Paizo+Inc"><strong>at this link</strong></a>. Here are some of our featured spotlight events!</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Pathfinder Second Edition</h3>
                  <p>At Gen Con, we’ll be closing Year 5 of Pathfinder Society with our finale adventure for high-level characters. We’ll also be launching Year 6: Year of Immortal Influence with two brand-new scenarios that are fully compliant with the Remaster ruleset! Bring your new Player Core 2 characters and jump right into the action!</p>
                  <ul>

                  <p>Our Pathfinder Special is always a packed house, and this year, we’re getting nautical! Characters from 1st through 8th-level can join us for our Saturday night marquee event. This event absolutely will sell out, and while we’ll try to seat as many walk-ups as possible, we make no guarantees. Note that we have pregenerated characters only up to 5th-level, so those playing at 7-8 tables must bring their own characters or be reseated.</p>
                  <ul>

                  <p>We’ll also be offering a limited number of Pathfinder Quests! These shorter adventures have more seats reserved for walk-up players, though we have some early tickets on sale as well. Dip your toe into Golarion and join us at one of these tables!</p>
                  <ul>

To give you some insight into the process of creating a new edition of Starfinder, the Starfinder team has released four Field Tests so far. These small snapshots of our work in progress have previewed three classes (the envoy, mystic, and soldier) as well as new ancestries. For our fifth Field Test, we’re doing something a bit different: encounters! So, it’s time to make some Starfinder characters, if you haven’t already.

                  <p>Field Test #5 includes two encounters, one for 1st-level characters and one for 5th-level characters. Each encounter includes everything a GM needs to throw their party right into the action: a basic narrative setup, a battle map, multiple enemy stat blocks, and enemy tactics. We’ve even included the text of our new weapon traits so you know how the enemies’ weapons work, and some discussion of our encounter design principles so you can see what we’re going for.</p>
                  <p>The first encounter tasks the player characters with defending a data center from Corpse Fleet privateers. If the initial encounter isn’t enough for you, there’s a bonus stat block for groups who want an extra challenge against a tough enemy! (Spoiler alert: some of you may die.)</p>

                  <p>You’ll need 5th-level characters for the second encounter, which pits the player characters against a group of Aeon Guard troopers. Careful! Rumor has it that they’ve got some sort of ferocious beast protecting them. I’m sure it’ll be fine, though. You’re going to make an amazing Field Test character. And they totally absolutely won’t die. Definitely not!</p>
                  <p>In all seriousness, please feel free to use this content in whatever way you like. The Field Tests are only snapshots, and we realize that you can’t really create a full Starfinder party yet, unless you double up on some of the classes we’ve previewed so far. That’s okay! This content is meant as a preview. Have fun with it. Mix it up. Maybe give enemy stat blocks to the players and let them play out a Corpse Fleet vs. Aeon Guard battle royale!</p>
                  <p><strong>What’s next? When’s the playtest?!</strong><br>

                  <p itemprop="description">Paizo’s made a name for itself on its adventures—even before the rise of the Pathfinder RPG, we were creating standalone adventures and Adventure Paths. There’s an old industry adage that “adventures don’t sell,” and while it’s true that a product like an adventure, which is aimed only at the GM, will sell less than a product aimed at players, I’ve never agreed with the theory that creating and publishing adventures is a waste of resources. To me, adventures are the whole point of an RPG—without adventures, GMs have nothing to run and players have nothing to play.</p>
                  <p>While a custom-created adventure by your own GM will always be able to speak to your table’s gaming preferences, creating adventures takes a lot of work. With published adventures, a GM can not only save a lot of time in preparing for a game or a campaign, but also find inspiration in them or learn how adventures are written, both of which help a GM get better at their craft. And when you don’t have a group to game with, even the simple act of reading a published adventure can help you feel that you’re still connected to your hobby until you find a new group to game with.</p>
                  <p>Published adventures have another advantage as well—they create shared experiences for gamers to talk about. It’s one thing to be at a convention or go online to talk about an adventure your PCs went on and how you barely made it out of the dungeon alive, but when you’ve done this with a published adventure, other gamers out there in the world who have been on the same adventure feel a connection to your game, and a greater discourse can be born out of that experience much in the same way as talking with friends about a recent movie or video game everyone’s been watching or playing.</p>
                  <p>As big a part of Paizo’s history as adventures are, it’s no surprise that we have several categories of adventures to choose from—and with the recent adjustments to our Adventure Path lengths and the formats of our standalone Adventures, I figured it’s time to chat a little bit about how Paizo’s three categories of published adventures are different, so you can figure out which category works best for your current campaign. Adventures are broken down into three size categories: Small, Medium, and Large.</p>
                  <h2>Small: Scenarios and Quests</h2>
                  <p>Our shortest adventure offerings are Scenarios and Quests. These PDF-only products give you a shorter game experience meant to play out over the course of two hours or so (in the case of a quest) or a single game session (a scenario). These are all part of Paizo’s Organized Play program, but they work just as well for a home game that needs a quick encounter or a short filler adventure in between longer storylines. You can think of a Scenario or a Quest as a short film.</p>

                  <h2>Medium: Standalone Adventures</h2>
                  <p>Our standalone Adventures have recently undergone an upgrade—from this point onward, starting with the upcoming adventure <em>Prey for Death</em>, our standalone adventures will be hardcover 128-page books. A standalone Adventure will typically present a single storyline that covers several sessions of gaming—as a general rule, you can expect your characters to gain somewhere between 3 to 6 levels over the course of a single standalone Adventure. This format allows us to explore larger storylines that need more room than a single volume of an Adventure Path to play out, but that don’t require the commitment to a three-part campaign—and also allow us to get a bit more experimental (such as with <em>Prey for Death</em>, which expects the players to all be Red Mantis Assassins—or at least closely allied with them!). We’ve got some more fun experiments in the works going forward for this line, so stay tuned! You can think of a standalone Adventure as a feature-length movie.</p>

                  <h2>Large: Adventure Paths</h2>
                  <p>Our Adventure Paths have been going strong for over 200 volumes, and while we’ve made some adjustments to their length (shifting from six-part campaigns down to three-part ones), this line of adventures isn’t going anywhere. An Adventure Path is published in three volumes that come out monthly; it can cover months or even years of gaming. You can expect your PCs to gain about 10 levels over the course of an entire Adventure Path. This format lets us tell long, sprawling stories that cover a wide range of themes, to explore ongoing events in the world of Golarion, and to present new parts of the world in great detail. You can think of an Adventure Path as a season of episodes for a television series.</p>

                  <p>Though, a new socialite has arrived in Absalom, Lady Hesla Embersplitter. She has no family, no background, no claim to fame, and yet, she’s entranced the hearts of the people and leaders of the community, including two very powerful forces: the Peacebuilders and Watcher-Lord Ulthun II. However, something seems... <em>off</em> about Hesla. And the weather across Golarion seems to be shifting, as though some dark change is on its way.</p>

                  <p>There are seven Pathfinder Society Scenarios that influence the Year of Immortal Influence’s metaplots, and each will be marked with a special metaplot icon on the cover. More information about the metaplot, as well as upcoming locations and characters, will be revealed during the News from Organized Play panel at PaizoCon 2024!</p>
                  <p>The Year of Immortal Influence’s first metaplot scenario kicks off with Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Immortal Influence, an adventure for 1st- to 4th-level characters written by Rigby Bendele. This scenario takes place during a fancy charity dinner, hosted by Lady Hesla as she seeks to raise money to fund the Knights of Lastwall. This scenario debuts at Gen Con 2024 with one other Pathfinder Society scenario.</p>
                  <p>This year is about uncovering secret plots and plans to unravel one of the most vulnerable areas in Avistan, even as the enemy wears a pretty face!</p>

                  <p>Speaking of… I’ve got quite the travel schedule this summer: PaizoCon in late May, Origins in mid-June, and then a quick turnaround to go to the ALA Expo with our Community Manager a few days later. I’ll have a few weeks of rest in July and then it’s off to Gen Con and PaizoCon Europe in August! Hopefully my cats will remember me by the time I’m back.</p>
                  <p>Before we jump into the blog, I want to shout out the Mox Gauntlet! Team Paizo is raising money for charity and participating in this annual board game tournament. If you donate to me you can get cat pics, a Harrow reading, or even a one-shot GMed by me! You can learn more and donate <a href="https://events.gamersengaged.org/participant/1252">on my participant page here</a>.</p>

                  <h2>SFS Year 7 Rule Updates</h2>
                  <p>Starfinder Society Year 7 launches at PaizoCon at the end of the month! Upon commencement of the convention (May 24), the following species will become always available for play:</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>barathu (<em>Alien Archive</em>)</li>
                   <li>borai (<em>Pact Worlds</em>)</li>
                   <li>ghibrani (<em>Starfinder #5: The Thirteenth Gate</em>)</li>
                   <li>morlamaw (<em>Alien Archive 3</em>)</li>
                   <li>prismeni (<em>Starfinder #49: A Light in the Dark</em>)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Players will still need to own the indicated sourcebook but will no longer require a boon to play any of these species.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, two new boons will be available for purchase that week! I won’t give any spoilers just yet, but they’re the direct result of player actions over the past year of play. Stay tuned for those at the convention!</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Death of a God</h3>
                  <p>On our livestream last month, we announced the first major god who will die in the upcoming War of Immortals meta-event. Obviously, this death will have an impact on the Pathfinder Society campaign. Developer Josh Foster wrote a blog to talk about the exact rules surrounding the god’s death; <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6tabl">check it out here</a>!</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2>
                  <p>The sanctioning machine is back in full swing! Last month we posted <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Seven+Dooms+for+Sandpoint+Sanctioning.pdf">sanctioning for the </a><a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Seven+Dooms+for+Sandpoint+Sanctioning.pdf"><em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint Adventure Path</em></a>, as well as the brand-new <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions#lo-txwg"><em>Tian Xia World Guide</em></a>!</p>
                  <p>We’re hard at work on the major May releases, <em>Howl of the Wild </em>and <em>Mechageddon!</em> We aim to have them both ready for PaizoCon so you can play your new awakened animals and centaurs right away. GMs, prepare to make the hallways larger!</p>
                  <p>After that, it’ll be pretty quiet until July, when <em>Player Core 2</em> crashes in for Gen Con and the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>follows a mere month later. Hope you’re all ready!</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                  <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                  <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                  <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th rank!</p>
                  <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Zachary Davis</p>

                  <p>There seem to be two entries, one related to elemental birds, the other to unicorns! Let’s see what he has to say.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Elemental Birds and the Power of the Storm</h3>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/aafcdd65-8b00-4824-8ef2-c08ce0fd360d/ScientificIllustration_ElementalBirdFeathers_2000x1333.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/aafcdd65-8b00-4824-8ef2-c08ce0fd360d/ScientificIllustration_ElementalBirdFeathers_2000x1333.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Art by Luca Sotgiu : A scientific illustration of a variety of chaos falcon feathers."></a>
                   <p style="font-size: 13px;">A scientific illustration of a variety of chaos falcon feathers. Art by Luca Sotgiu.</p>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p><em>The elements have a life of their own. I have always believed that birds embody these elements particularly well—phoenixes, thunderbirds, and tidehawks to name a few—but each of these creatures is so different from one another. They make their homes in different habitats and approach life with such different philosophies that they rarely meet without clashing.</em></p>
                  <p><em>My question, dear reader, has always been about the connection between these birds. Most sources say there is no doubt the three creatures have a common ancestor. What could that creature be? And does it still live?</em></p>
                  <p><em>I needed to trace the birds back to their commonalities for an answer. The Zoetrope could not take us back in time, but my studies could, and I soon found several similarities within a handful of creation myths. In ages past, the world was said to be in an everlasting tempest. Volcanoes spat fire into the sky, lightning jumped between clouds of ash, and sharp ice fragments whipped through the wind. It was the storm from which all other storms were born. How fitting would this primordial tempest be as the birthplace of the species of elemental bird from which the others evolved?</em></p>
                  <p><em>I searched volcanoes for the creatures known as chaos falcons, waiting for a violent eruption to give me a glimpse into the world of the past. It was in the Kullan Dei mountains that I at last found it.</em></p>
                  <p>This journal entry was written for <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em> by Caryn DiMarco.</p>
                  <p>How odd, it seems Baranthet also included some notes about the chaos falcon’s “abilities.”</p>
                  <h4><u>CHAOS FALCON — CREATURE 10</u></h4>
                  <p><b>Dive-bomb</b> [two-actions] (earth, fire, primal) <b>Requirements</b> The chaos falcon is Flying; <b>Effect</b> The chaos falcon Flies twice straight down. If they reach the ground or a similarly solid object at the end of this movement, their landing shatters that surface into sharp shards, and droplets of molten stone deal 4d6 fire and 3d8 piercing damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save) to all other creatures within 20 feet.<br></p>
                  <p><b>Storm Bolt</b> The chaos falcon's bolt Strike always deals the damage type of their storm nexus aura.</p>

                  <h3>A Sanctuary for Unicorns</h3>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f6a7833e-dd44-48e8-a084-c79c6320653c/ScientificIllustration_UnicornHerd_2000x1333.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f6a7833e-dd44-48e8-a084-c79c6320653c/ScientificIllustration_UnicornHerd_2000x1333.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt=" Art by Luca Sotgiu : A scientific illustration of unicorns grazing, drinking water, and frolicking in a field."></a>

                  </div>
                  <p><em>During our journey, we were lucky to stumble into the Monkeros Sanctuary, a hidden forest doubling as both a nature reserve and home for a small herd of unicorns. Of course, I will not share its location—indeed, publicizing the location of any unicorn poses a terrible danger to them. With that in mind, many who support the sanctuary do so without ever seeing the unicorns they protect. A rare few academic visitors are allowed along with a handful of mercenaries, both vetted through the churches associated with Monkeros and further by the unicorns themselves.</em></p>
                  <p><em>Although unicorns have the capacity for speech far surpassing my own eloquence, their nervousness around outsiders makes direct interviews difficult. It was only by enlisting the aid of ten-year-old Theom, the son of a visiting scholar, that I was able to establish something of a dialogue with the most outgoing of the unicorns. Theom knew the unicorn as “Periwinkle,” which she seemed happy to accept—much like our own Ten has adopted their moniker. Even in the oldest stories and tales, the true name of a unicorn is always missing. It seems too much of a coincidence that this detail is so persistently lacking; I’m left to believe that unicorns must have a very good reason to protect the secrecy of their true name.</em></p>
                  <p>This journal entry was written for <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em> by Jessie “Aki” Lo.</p>
                  <p>Another note—perhaps Baranthet has found a system of denoting abilities across the wide variety of Golarion’s wildlife... Apparently, unicorns comprise not just the eponymous species, but many others as well, such as the flying alicorn.</p>
                  <h4><u>ALICORN — CREATURE 15</u></h4>
                  <p><b>Draw in Magic</b> [reaction] (arcane, concentrate) <b>Trigger</b> A creature within 30 feet of the alicorn Casts a Spell; <b>Effect</b> The alicorn attempts to counteract the triggering spell (counteract modifier +28, counteract rank 8th). If successful, the alicorn can choose to gain the effects of the triggering spell as its sole target.</p>

The nations of Golarion clash over border disputes, natural resources, and ideological differences. For such grand conflicts (as well as your typical dungeon encounters), we introduce two new classes who can help turn the tide of any battle.</p>
                  <p>The commander is an Intelligence-based tactician with unparalleled authority over the battlefield. By drilling specific tactics with your allies during your daily preparations, you can signal them with your unfurled banner during a fight to take additional actions. Call for a Defensive Retreat to allow each of your squadmates to Step up to three times (away from enemies, of course) as a free action. Using the Double Team tactic to allow a squadmate with an opponent in reach to Shove or Reposition that foe as a free action. If they are successful and move that creature adjacent to you or a different squadmate, you or that squadmate can Strike that opponent as a reaction. The commander is no slouch in the fight themself, being trained in martial weapons and all armors, so if you want to lead your fellow adventurers to victory, be sure to playtest the commander!</p>

                  <p>The guardian is a Strength-based protector who excels in the use of armor, both for their own benefit and the aid of others. You gain the effects of armor specialization at 1st level, and you can also Intercept Strikes meant for your allies, taking the hit but gaining resistance against that damage. Because of your armor, you’ll be a little more difficult to hit than your friends, so what’s to stop monsters from simply ignoring you? Your Taunts! By Taunting a foe, you make yourself a more tempting target and impart penalties to their attacks on anyone else. If you are the type of player who enjoys keeping others safe from harm, be sure to playtest the guardian!</p>

                  <p>Titles are ranked by an average of units sold and revenue earned and presented in alphabetical order. Asterisks indicate titles that have been on a best-seller list previously. Because they’ve consistently topped the list, and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers lists.

                  <p>The Monstercology Galatica is an attempt to catalog and describe all of the many and varied creatures that we share the galaxy with. We understand that with millions of stars and billions of worlds – plus those that visit the galaxy from other planes – this is a nearly impossible endeavor. But if we do not try it, then we can never succeed. This is but one small excerpt of the greater Monstercology Galatica, focusing on creatures most often seen during the later parts of the year.</p>

                  <h3><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/429388/Space-Cowboys-Arsenal?affiliate_id=2791261">Space Cowboy’s Arsenal</a>*</h3>
                  <p>A certain type of adventurer resides in the vast frontiers of space—wayfarers and drifters, hunters whose next meal rides on their cunning, their aim, and the price on their bounty's head. They carve out their existence beyond the fringes of civilization; the easy life is as alien to them as another man's gun, and just as fickle. They prefer the unpredictable and uncharted, far from prying eyes and folks what ask too many questions. Never tied to one place, these vagabonds stay strange and savvy, doing what they can to keep alive. When the galaxy needs a job done, they call for the rough and tumble Space Cowboy.</p>

                  <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them primarily)</h3>
                  <p>안녕하세요, 여러분! My name is Eren, and I had the incredibly fun opportunity to refresh Daikitsu and Lao Shu Po for the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> as well as contributing some lore around the mystical imugi. As someone who loves exploring the relationship between mortality and divinity, it was an absolute dream to have the opportunity to expand on Tian Xia's pantheon. I hope you all fall as deeply in love with the Lady of Foxes and Old Rat Woman as I did while writing them.</p>
                  <p>You can find me sporadically talking about my writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erenahn.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> (by the time you're reading this, I'll have posted more detailed threads on my contributions for this book, if you're interested in reading about my process) and talking about everything else on <a href="https://twitter.com/chromathesia">Twitter</a>. You will also see me in a couple of months for the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>!</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Alyx Bui</h3>
                  <p>Hear ye, hear ye! Here come the imperial dragons of Tian Xia! I had the pleasure of crafting and writing on the Imperial Dragons and the peoples and land of Zi Ha! This was a massive collaboration between so many talented writers and artists—Basheer Ghouse to place Arindham, a forest dragon within the Valashmai Jungle, with Jay Zhang to place Luong Phung, a sea dragon within Xidao, with Jacky Leung to place Shen Ra, a sky dragon within Po Li, with Kevin Thien Vu Long Nguyen to place a sovereign dragon, Pham Duc Quan within Xa Hoi, and Grady Wang to place an underworld dragon, Zhu Long, within Chu Ye.</p>
                  <p>For Zi Ha, it was brilliant to connect with Kienna Shaw, as we placed the samsaran peoples and their origins in this magical land. We wanted to make sure that we inserted a non-colonial view of this world. I wanted joy and wonder to come out of these harsh, wintery lands—from bioluminescent fungi and large, carnivorous plant hunting to festivals that honor the mountain peaks, dragon cycles, and the long day and night phases. Enjoy the epic lore of Shei Long, a Sky Dragon, and the moon deity Tsukiyo! Continue the conversation with me on X (Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/daredevilalyx">@daredevilalyx</a>!</p>

                  <h3>Banana Chan (she/they/he)</h3>
                  <p>I'm Banana and I wrote a bunch of stuff for Tian Xia, but what I need EVERYONE to know about is the Great Flood, based on the creature Xiangliu. It's one of my favorite mythical creatures because of how silly it looks in drawings, but if you could see it in real life, it would probably be a body horror disaster. It has the body of a giant snake or eel with nine human heads attached to it. I'd been wanting to write about the Xiangliu for the longest time, so I'm extremely grateful that Paizo gave me that opportunity.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Connie Chang (they/he/she)</h3>
                  <p>Hey there! I'm Connie Chang, and I wrote Quain, a location full of wuxia fantasies, grandmasters, and cultivation! As a queer and trans diasporic Chinese person, I'm a huge fan of the wuxia and xianxia genres as a way to explore historical fantasy beyond western imaginations—so of course I jumped at the chance to help create something with Paizo. I'm especially interested in seeing the stories that will bloom from centuries-old, deeply complicated rivalries between grandmasters!</p>

                  <h3>Hiromi Cota (they/them)</h3>
                  <p>Hai tai! Wanne Hiromi yaibiin! Hi! I’m Hiromi! For folks unfamiliar with me, I’ve worked on over a hundred books and games, usually as a writer or game designer. I’m excited to have worked with Paizo, as I’ve wanted to for years. I’m even more excited to say that I also got to work on the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> and pen the tie-in fiction <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sii3?Tian-Xia-Days-The-Matsuri">The Matsuri</a>! Hopefully, I’ll have more opportunities to work with Paizo in the future. If I do, you’ll find out about them from my Bluesky account <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiromicota.bsky.social">@hiromicota</a>!</p>
                  <p>For the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>, I worked on Kwanlai. I had fun providing an in-world explanation as to why Kwanlai is principally populated by tengu (a Japanese creature) but has a Chinese name. The answer, in short, is colonialism. In real life, Japan colonized Uchinaa and foisted the exonym “Okinawa” upon my people. So, it was natural for me to depict the Lung Wa conquering the nation of Ootoya and foisting the exonym “Kwanlai” on the Ootoyans. Another fun tidbit in the writeup is takoyaki (battered and fried octopus) becoming a popular snack due to Wanshou (a nation ruled by a kraken) attacking Kwanlai.</p>

                  <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her)</h3>
                  <p>Dana Ebert (nonchalant female human writer) is a common author to find credited in Pathfinder publications, and the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> is no exception. Known for fanciful and often extravagant prose, her work reimagining Minata is most evident in phrases like "swallowing dragons like krill" and "churned the sea like a mortar and pestle." In addition to authoring the chapter on Minata, she contributed substantial Minata-adjacent content to the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>.

                  <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3>
                  <p>Hi! I’m John, a mixed-race Filipino American gamer, gamemaster, freelancer, and podcaster. For the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em> I wrote the Oceans of Tian Xia as well as several new Tian ships, along with Yamatsumi the mountain god and General Susumu. I was very excited to work on these as I spent my early childhood in Hawai'i and Philippines, and later sailed the seven seas as I started my career.</p>
                  <p>As a freelance game designer, I’ve written mostly for Paizo but also some for Evil Robot Games and Legendary Games. As a gamemaster, I earned my 5th Nova in 2021 and have volunteered at dozens of gaming conventions. As a podcaster, I produce three podcasts on the Know Direction Network: <a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/digital-divination/">Digital Divination</a>, with Paizo Senior Designer Jason Keeley and D&amp;D Designer Ron Lundeen; <a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/">Intrepid Heroes</a>, an RPG actual play where we just completed the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk">Devastation Ark</a> AP and soon begin a <a href="https://evilhat.com/product/scum-and-villainy/">Scum and Villainy</a> adventure run by Jason Keeley; and <a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/presenting/">Presenting - Gamers Making Games</a>, a podcast where I have interviewed over 100 game designers, developers, artists, and editors. In addition, I am also GMing a <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix">Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</a> campaign and playing <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/outlawsOfAlkenstar">Outlaws of Alkenstar</a> and <a href="https://dndstore.wizards.com/us/en/product/820944/planescape-adventures-in-the-multiverse-digital-plus-physical-bundle">Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse</a>. In my non-gaming life, I am a university professor teaching entrepreneurship and social venture creation in the Seattle area.</p>

                  <p>Hello! My name's Daniel! I'm the co-host of the Asians Represent Podcast and am a freelance game designer and cultural consultant with over 40 games credits! The <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> is my second Paizo contribution and certainly the one I'm most excited about. I had a blast bringing my love of weapons, horror, and mythology to life for the project. It is such an honor to be part of such a diverse team of Asian creatives who have worked so hard to bring life to Tian Xia! Fun fact, some of my fellow freelancers and I started a home game to test out many of our contributions during the development period!</p>

                  <p>Hey, everyone! I'm Jacky Leung, and it's been a while since I worked freelance for Paizo. Tian Xia was an amazing experience to revisit as a player and a creator. I had the pleasure of writing for Po Li and expanding life in a country ruled by the theologic elite and how people governed by oracles thrive despite its previously sheltered portrayal in earlier works. I had the opportunity to provide faces to the extremely secretive Oracular Council that governs Po Li, introduce the equally secretive Lapis Watchers, and expand new iconic locations for players to explore such as Tuotuo, the Enlightened City—a historical education center containing special archives housing racks of prophecies and oracular writings. Beyond the nostalgic glamor lies also the Emperor's Footprint, a site rumored to contain mystical properties, a supposed asteroid, and stunning panoramic beauty—just highly dangerous and full of monsters, I'm sure it's fine. I hope folx gets to experience the social and political dissonance that awaits them when adventuring through Po Li; it was a fantastic challenge.</p>

Goblets and Gays is an award-winning, Pathfinder 2e Actual Play podcast.

                  <p>Hello friends! I'm so excited for you all to sink into this beautiful world. For many of you it will be a marvelous opportunity to immerse yourself in a land rich with cultures perhaps outside your own. I'm right there with you. This was my first contribution to Pathfinder's rich world, and I never expected to go so deep into exploring my own culture and heritage through the lens of Wanshou's horror and paranoia. Just remember, if anything bad happens to your party while exploring this flooded land, it's definitely not a coincidence and probably your party member's fault. You know which one I'm talking about.</p>
                  <p>I work on all kinds of TTRPG content, so if you're into grand adventure with a bit of horror, then we'll get along great!

I'm Tan Shao Han / 陈绍涵 (family name Tan/Chen, 陈; generational name, Shao 绍; personal name, Han 涵), a TTRPG creator, lecturer, and cultural consultant from Singapore, Southeast Asia. I'm proudly part of the RPGSEA TTRPG design movement based in Southeast Asia! I grew up a steady diet on wuxia media (movies, books, TV series, manhua), and am happy to re-imagine and create settings (the histories, lands, and peoples of Goka and Songbai) in the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> to inspire the telling of new wuxia-influenced stories in your Pathfinder games! It has been an absolute privilege to work on the Tian Xia books, alongside great colleagues and supervisors whom I now have the pleasure to call my friends.</p>
                  <p>Outside of freelancing with Paizo, I also run an indie TTRPG company, <a href="https://www.curiouschimeras.com/">Curious Chimeras</a>.

                  <p>Hello, y’all! Ruvaid here. You may have seen my name in previous Paizo books such as <em>Dark Archive</em>, <em>Impossible Lands</em>, and <em>Rage of Elements</em>. For the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>, I wrote the entry for the nation of Hongal. I have a deep appreciation for Mongolian culture from which Hongal draws inspiration, and I endeavored to bring as much respect to my words as possible. I sincerely hope that you enjoy reading about Hongal as much as I enjoyed writing about it.</p>

                  <p>Howdy, I'm Grady and my work on Chu Ye in the <em>World Guide</em> was my first-ever assignment for Paizo! I'm so excited that it's finally out! This nation has incredible potential for grand stories, from its historical contributions to medicinal knowledge to the present-day four-way clash between its greedy oni ruling class, a scrappy humanoid rebellion, an underworld dragon out for revenge, and a jealous god. I was also thrilled to be able to draw upon my Chinese and Taiwanese heritages to expand Chu Ye’s culture and its experiences under occupation.</p>
                  <p>My next contribution will be in the <em>Character Guide</em> coming later this year, which contains Tian Xia’s unique takes on medicine. You can also find me online at The Gallant Goblin where my partner and I review TTRPG products on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thegallantgoblin">https://www.youtube.com/thegallantgoblin</a>, sell kobold plushies at <a href="https://www.gallantgoblin.com/heroplush/">heroplush.com</a>, and produce expanded content for Pathfinder at <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/">https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/</a>, where we just released the first community print-on-demand product, <em>Adventures in Jalmeray</em>, which is an anthology of three adventures set in Jalmeray (<em>Lost Omens: Impossible Lands</em>) designed by an all-Desi team of writers!</p>

                  <p>The annual Greenwood Gala—a convention for primal power brokers and a festival associated with the Green Faith—is ruined when saboteurs assassinate several of the region’s eminent leaders. To keep tensions from erupting into more bloodshed, the PCs must maintain order long enough for the Wildwood Lodge to choose a new leader and restore peace. The Wardens of Wildwood Adventure Path begins with “Pactbreaker,” a complete adventure for 5th- to 7th-level characters.</p>

                  <p>A Starfinder Society Scenario designed for 7th- through 10th-level characters.</p>
                  <p>For a century, the villainous Order of Dawning Fate has operated in the shadows, remaining anonymous and untouched despite extensive criminal activity, political manipulation, and espionage. Thanks to the efforts of countless Starfinders and their allies across the galaxy, the Order of Dawning Fate is crumbling—their members are exposed, their holdings are under investigation, their proxies are moving to cut ties, many of their highest-ranking members are dead or arrested, and their supply of the rare starmetal finitrium has been cut off. Yet a threat remains…</p>
                  <p>Zhaneni, founder and mastermind of the Order of Dawning Fate, has evaded capture, retreating to her personal demesne on the planet Kax to wait out the turmoil alongside her closest ally and fellow founder of the Order, Evethriel. As the Stewards, Veskarium, and numerous other galactic bodies move against the Order’s now-exposed agents and holdings within their respective jurisdictions, First Seeker Ehu Hadif and Ixthia the Unbreakable dispatch Starfinders to confront Zhaneni and destroy the last remnants of Project Dawn—the hybrid machine that amplifies Zhaneni’s natural precognitive abilities, enabling her to see and shape the future.</p>

                  <p>The Pathfinder Society is running low on a critical alchemical catalyst, and all their usual suppliers have run dry. The Supplies and Procurement Division is desperate and has put a call out directly to agents. They know of one alchemist skilled and knowledgeable enough to make the catalyst: Tragshi the Herbalist, master of the Daggermark Poisoner's Guild. The Society has used what contacts they have remaining in Daggermark to arrange a meeting, but the chief poisoner isn't one to give things away for free. The PCs will need to do several errands for her, proving the Society's worth to the guild and to Tragshi herself.</p>

Unfortunately, there have been strange attacks on Freedom Town as of late. Desperate for answers and hopeful for assistance, Uirch reaches out to the Pathfinder Society to investigate the mysterious attackers and see if their flames belong to the Whispering Tyrant or to another enemy lying in wait. The Pathfinders will need to investigate the town while ensuring that an enemy of mythical proportions doesn't see their plan succeed and interrupt Mahja's Crucible.</p>

                 <blockquote>
                  <p itemprop="description">New Year’s first fireworks danced across Changdo’s night, their exuberant sparks half-reflected upon the Sea of Ghosts. Ling Zhiyu, courtesy name Wenhan, Sixth-Rank Clerk of the Ministry of Truth, Junior Secretary of the Lower Oracular Council, set down his brush to admire the distant pyrotechnics.</p>
                  <p>This far from the city, the celebrations looked almost peaceful. Whenever possible, Zhiyu spent New Year here, at this shoreside teahouse, preferring to stay away from the devotees jostling to light the auspicious incense to welcome the Eternal Emperor’s spirit, away from wending swells of dragon dancers bearing the throne’s five colors, and most of all, away from the Ministry of Faith’s magically amplified, self-congratulatory platitudes for yet another year of Po Li’s glory.</p>
                  <p>The Sea of Ghosts’ lapping waves broke the oracle’s reverie, their leisurely cadence not unlike the murmuring of some unknown tongue. Zhiyu smiled despite himself. <em>No point thinking such dour thoughts during New Year. You'll invite Heaven’s displeasure... and more importantly, spoil everyone’s mood here. They’ve suffered enough.</em></p>
                  <p>Facing the vacuous waters, Zhiyu spoke loudly and clearly to no one at all.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, elders. Happy New Year to you too. May your heart realize ten thousand desires, may your descendants lead long and healthy lives, may the Eternal Emperor hasten your reincarnations for your loyal service. You can see, Changdo still stands, bright with lanterns, altars, cooking fires, and fireworks. You did not fight the War of Widow-Makers in vain; every New Year is your everlasting gift to us all.”</p>
                  <p>The currents settled. His invisible audience seemingly placated, Zhiyu returned to his table’s reports, and was pleasantly surprised to find the teahouse’s proprietors had discreetly left some fried niangao and a fresh pot of aged Tuotuo tea. These refreshments were not unwelcome; there was much to attend to, from goiter and beriberi coinciding with recent fads of grain diets emulating the Eternal Emperor’s piety; stirring instability in the West with Lingshen and Quain; troubling developments on the East with Hwanggot and Bachuan. So much to do! But for now, tea and rice cakes. Zhiyu sipped gratefully, smiled his thanks to the teahouse’s owners, and returned to his paperwork, as fresh fireworks and celebratory songs filled the night.</p>
                  <hr width="50%">
                  <p>“Oracle Ling looks tired. He’s always working so hard, even on New Year.”</p>
                  <p>“You know how it is, my beloved. There are some oracles who work very hard, because there are so many who don’t...”</p>
                  <p>“Close your mouth, my foolish husband. These things! You shouldn’t even think them, let alone speak them... nobody, especially us, can afford to pay the price.”</p>
                  <p>On this solemn note, the teahouse owners’ whispered conversation reached a brief lull. Fireworks flared above, in the shape of a celestial peach tree; a sign of life’s renewal and promise. Husband and wife contemplated the sky together, a shared silence; then, both spoke abruptly at the same time.</p>
                  <p>“Do you suppose we can ask Oracle Ling...”</p>
                  <p>“Maybe it’s as good a time as any to ask Oracle Ling...”</p>
                  <p>They laughed quietly at this simultaneous blurting of their hearts’ nervousness. Who could blame them? They were but humble merchants without clan or fame, whose usual clients were fishers who plied the Sea of Ghosts for minnow and perch. Oracle Ling was by far their most prestigious guest, a virtuous official without outrageous demands or haughty airs, who paid in full and tipped well.</p>
                  <p>To ask an extra favor of him, and especially on this New Year, when families traditionally would have their Reunion Dinners, and officials would vie to fete the Ministers in grand court banquets... Oracle Ling must be truly busy to forsake those commitments and opportunities. What right would they have to disturb his schedule with such a selfish request?</p>
                  <hr width="50%">
                  <p>Zhiyu yawned as he completed his report on the Gokan trafficking of false Po Lian relics and rubbed the poultice of chrysanthemum and wolfberry over his tired eyes.</p>
                  <p><em>I suppose it's time.</em></p>
                  <p>The waves stirred, as if in assent.</p>
                  <p>Zhiyu forced a smile, trying to let the wisdom in his mind fade away, to return from realms of divine insight dwelled by praiseworthy sages. He stood up quietly and tiptoed to the teahouse.</p>
                  <hr width="50%">
                  <p>“Excuse me.”</p>
                  <p>The proprietors nearly jumped from shock. Zhiyu reprimanded himself; he had not wanted to cause any disturbance, but alas, that was exactly what had happened. <em>Ah well, let's get on with it.</em></p>
                  <p>“Good sir, good madam, I understand you would like my help with something. I understand you have a child, of the right age for a Test of Fate, and you would like to see what the Heavens are willing to reveal about your child’s destiny.”</p>
                  <p>This time, the proprietors were truly in shock. How did the esteemed guest know all these? But then, he was an oracle...</p>
                  <p>“I understand your grandparents were from Lingshen and Quain, who fought here to defend the Imperial City during the War of Widow-Makers...”</p>
                  <p>The wind hissed, like a thousand knives drawn all at once.</p>
                  <p>“...and your parents stayed behind, but Changdo has not treated you all that well. Due to the present... succession disputes. Of things much bigger than you or me, our politics, histories, cultures...”</p>
                  <p>The wind stopped abruptly, A sleeping waterbird woke in surprise, and uttered a mournful cry.</p>
                  <p>“...and so, you have no lands, no clans, no names, no sponsors; no choice but to take on the regrettable work of doing business on your own. And you wonder... will your child inherit the same fate?”</p>
                  <p>Wife and husband nodded as one, their eyes red-rimmed and knuckles white-edged.</p>
                  <p>“If you will permit me, I will perform the Test of Fate for your child, and let his destiny be revealed in Heaven’s gaze. I apologize I must inconvenience you to visit my residence, because my luopan, almanacs, yarrow stalks, and other divinatory tools are at home.”</p>
                  <p>The couple fell to their knees in gratitude; Zhiyu stepped forward to help them back up. As they ambled to the oracle’s tiny manor, the night sky above Changdo seemed lighter somehow, and not just for the fireworks that flooded its inky expanse.</p>

                  <p>In the heart of the Verduran Forest, the largest woodlands in Avistan, druids and Green Faith adherents gather annually to share what they’ve learned from the natural world at an event called the Moot of Ages. Nearby, other forest denizens gather for the Greenwood Gala, a festive three-day event filled with feasts, games, and exuberance held on the river’s banks. The gala ends with a symbolic renewal of the Treaty of Wildwood, an agreement that has allowed a modicum of peace between those who call the forest home and those who harvest resources from it.</p>
                  <p>This doesn’t stop people from airing their grievances, yet the tone of such disagreements tends to be respectful. This year is different. Resentment has grown so deep and toxic that attendees are wielding their grudges like a keenly honed axe. Anyone stepping up to calm the situation is going to be forced to pick a side.</p>
                  <p>Inside the Wardens of Wildwood Player’s Guide, you’ll find player-friendly, spoiler-free lore and tips to create an exciting character suited for the Wardens of Wildwood Adventure Path. Contents include:</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>An overview of the Verduran Forest, the Wildwood Lodge, and the annual Moot of Ages.</li>

                  <p itemprop="description">Hello! Ben, the CEO and Creative Director of <a href="https://syrinscape.com/">Syrinscape</a> here. My favorite adventure of all time is Red Hand of Doom, which I've run four times—once in its original 3.5 system, and three times adapted for Pathfinder. The first and second SoundSets I ever built for <a href="https://syrinscape.com/">Syrinscape</a> are named "Bugbear Battle," after the very first encounter in Red Hand, and "Witchwood," after the spooky dangerous forest where much of the opening adventure takes place.</p>
                  <p>I am VERY excited to run <a href="https://syrinscape.com/store/613-seven-dooms-sandpoint-one/">Seven Dooms of Sandpoint</a>! This amazing adventure was co-written by James Jacobs. I'm a not-so-secret über-fan of James, so I’m always excited to see new stuff from him.</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">

                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>Let’s jump from the first two Sandpoint <a href="https://syrinscape.com/store/613-seven-dooms-sandpoint-one/">SoundSets</a> created for Syrinscape to the latest two. Number 1,081 (“Bones and Ashes”) and Number 1,082 (“Strange Times in Sandpoint”) were built to support the opening of this fantastic NEW adventure. Nowadays Syrinscape has a few more content creators than just me; while it’s still much of my music in there, Chris Körding built these sounds AND contributed even more rich evocative music of his own.</p>
                  <p>Back in 2009, Chris was playing <a href="https://syrinscape.com/store/?q=rise&amp;order=featured&amp;game-system=pathfinder&amp;type=everything">Rise of the Runelords</a> when, as he describes it, "Syrinscape came along and released the official soundscapes (SoundSets) for the adventure I was playing and I was blown away by the richness and textures and what it provided to the gaming table. Needless to say, <a href="https://syrinscape.com/">Syrinscape</a> became a permanent addition to every gaming session.”</p>
                  <p>Chris adds, “Fast forward to 2024 and Adventure Path 200! But this time I get to bring it to life for Syrinscape. Expanding from the original adventures and sounds, what could I do to propel it to the roaring 20s?" Nowadays, Syrinscape is more powerful—it can run more channels of sound, with individual reverb units set for every channel, and run sounds which are positioned binaurally for an increased sense of immersion. So, what has Chris done with these new capabilities? He’s had fun, that’s what!</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">

                  <br>
                  <p>Syrinscape supports all the key locations in this “new” Sandpoint with specifically crafted ambiances. Traps and dramatic events are meticulously crafted for maximum shock and affect. Encounters feature dramatic music to help keep everyone focused and specifically voiced creatures to trigger all those subconscious fears! And of course, as always, <a href="https://syrinscape.com/">Syrinscape</a> is 100% customizable.</p>
                  <p>When it comes to the music we have created, Chris says, “Don’t want piano hits? Just stop the element. Need some extra choir sounds? Just hit play on THAT element and you have your angelic voices. All of this can easily be done with the power Syrinscape puts into your hands.” With a <a href="https://syrinscape.com/subscriptions/3-supersyrin/">SuperSyrin</a> sub, you can even compose your own music and upload it to play along with the ambiances we designed. Syrinscape’s support for the Seven Dooms for Sandpoint Adventure Path is rich, specific, and immersive.</p>
                  <p>If you haven’t used Syrinscape at your table before, now might just be the time to give it a go! And if you are playing remotely with a team of headphone-wearing warriors, Syrinscape has you sorted with our new <a href="https://app.syrinscape.com/">Web Player</a>, which lets you share your audio with any of your friends ,wherever they are, with just a simple link they can open in any browser. We hope you love what we have <a href="https://syrinscape.com/store/613-seven-dooms-sandpoint-one/">built for this adventure</a>. We believe that using Syrinscape in your <a href="https://syrinscape.com/pathfinder/">Pathfinder</a> and <a href="https://syrinscape.com/starfinder/">Starfinder</a> games will deliver a world-class gaming experience so everyone in your game will have an amazing time, including you!</p>

                  <p>Greetings, Pathfinders!<br></p>
                  <p>It turns out that all the various consumables handed out on missions require a pretty solid support network, and now a supplier of a rare catalyst aiding in mass production is retiring, leaving the Society to turn towards a more troublesome source–Tragshi the Herbalist, head of the Daggermark Poisoners’ Guild. Fortunately, Tragshi is open to the idea, as the Outlaw Council, a meeting of various leaders of the River Kingdoms, is happening in Daggermark soon, and Tragshi has agreed to supply what the Society needs if they can be seen taking orders for her, letting her show off politically. She says there will also be other sundry tasks that need doing as well, but there’s a pretty good chance that the Pathfinders might end up dragged into an internal power structure within one of the most dangerous organizations in the Inner Sea.</p>

                  <p>The Burning Sun orc hold calls for the Pathfinder Society’s assistance in protecting the corpse of Mahja Firehair as she continues to undergo the Crucible. Lately there have been strange attacks on Freedom Town, centered on the house protecting her body and filled with signs of sulfur and occult magic. While the council of Freedom Town suspects the Whispering Way, Uirch has other concerns and requests that the Pathfinders investigate to find out who might be at the root of this chaos and find out their intentions with Mahja’s body, never suspecting that <em>he</em> may also be the target of this strange attacker.</p>

The Pathfinder Society has long desired a closer relationship with the Magaambya, and Kreighton Shaine has finally gotten a chance to achieve that. He’s selected some of his finest students to show the instructors at that storied institute of magical learning just what Pathfinder can do.

                  <br>
                  <p>Greeting Pathfinders,</p>
                  <p>By now you’ve all learned which of the core 20 will be dying—Gorum. Many of you may have characters that through one way or another draw power from Our Lord in Iron, and I can imagine that you’re all wondering what this means for those characters going forward. Our setting is one where dead gods don’t grant spells, no matter how fervent their remaining believers. We’re also running the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign in a living setting, and that means that setting-altering impacts will happen, and that they will matter. So, starting <strong>at Gen Con, August 1st 2024</strong>, Gorum will no longer be alive to grant his faithful power.</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bd64be30-c5c5-4858-9bf2-82c10b8cf254/PZO9303_GORUM_1600x2000.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bd64be30-c5c5-4858-9bf2-82c10b8cf254/PZO9303_GORUM_1600x2000.png" width="400px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="The armored god Gorum menacingly wields a sword, the glow of his eyes the only thing visible within his helm"></a>

                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>What that means is that any character with an option than relied on Gorum, such as a cleric, gets a free rebuild <strong>immediately</strong>. You don’t have to use it right away, but if you want to play your character on or after August 1st, you won’t be getting power from Gorum. I know many of you have characters intensely devoted to the gods they follow, and I’ve seen some really incredible Gorumites in my time volunteering for Pathfinder Society and since coming on as a developer. You don’t have to erase that fervor though. Just as we allow the reporting conditions for our scenarios to shape our setting, changes to the setting can be a part of your character’s story. We have some of the most creative players out there, and I look forward to seeing how you incorporate this twist into the characters you play.</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">

                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>The death of Gorum is going to hugely impact the setting, but we’ll also be releasing some Godsrain scenarios, so you’ll be able to play through some of the setting-altering aftermath of Our Lord in Iron’s demise. I know some of you will still be disappointed that a character you’ve put a lot into has to change, but we can’t keep our promise of a living setting if we don’t have those setting changes impact everyone. Though Gorum will be gone, your characters’ stories will continue. And I can’t wait to show you some of the scenarios we’ve shaped around this massive event, stories you’ll be able to contribute to because this is a living setting.</p>
                  <p>But that’ll have to wait for another blog. So, to reiterate, as of August 1st, Gorum will be dead, and any option explicitly receiving power from him won’t work. Any character using such an option, like a cleric, will receive a free rebuild. Until then, play your Gorumites’ hearts out.</p>
                  <p>Happy gaming everyone. It’s been a blast watching everyone’s theories and reactions throughout this announcement process.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Our Lord in Iron, Gorum! Now, the how, when, and why of this deific death are elements of War of Immortals we’re not quite ready to talk about yet, but we promise: Gorum is going to die “on screen” in an adventure in which your player characters play a role. We’ll have more details about that as the adventure’s release approaches. In the meantime, let’s take a brief look at the slate of products coming in the second half of 2024 in which Gorum’s death and the larger War of Immortals metaplot will play out!</p>
                  <p>First on the list are an adventure and adventure path that have already been announced. In July, we’re releasing <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eyz"><em>Pathfinder Adventure: Prey for Death</em></a>, a 128-page hardcover adventure for 14th-level characters, written by former Paizo Developer Vanessa Hoskins. In this adventure, you’ll play members of the Red Mantis, the notorious and mysterious assassins guild and cult of the mantis god, Achaekek, who must clear their names when treachery threatens to besmirch their honor. Not only is <em>Prey for Death</em> the first tie-in to the War of Immortals storyline, but it’s also the debut of the new ongoing format of the Pathfinder Adventure product line!</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Also in July, we’ll kick off our 40th Pathfinder Adventure Path (!!!), entitled Curtain Call, with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez2"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #204: Stage Fright</em></a> by veteran designer Richard Pett. <em>Stage Fright</em> starts characters as 11th-level adventurers who, over the course of the AP, help to produce an opera based on their own prior adventures while simultaneously facing a new threat that only the most powerful of heroes can stop. The connections between a theater-based campaign and the death of one of Golarion’s most powerful deities may seem tenuous, but you’ll have to trust us on this: the ramifications of Gorum’s death and the ensuing Godsrain affect all aspects of the world. And players of the Curtain Call Adventure Path will have a front row seat!</p>

                  <p>In September, we’ll be releasing the first of a pair of e-book short fiction collections exploring the event, a compilation of Erin Roberts’s smash <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/theGodsrainProphecies">web fiction series</a>, <em>The Godsrain Prophecies</em>, complete with additional material exploring the identity and motivations of the mysterious seer who first penned the prophecies.</p>
                  <p>In October, we’ll publish <em>Before the Godsrain</em>, an anthology of short and flash fiction featuring four Iconic characters: the barbarian Amiri, the wizard Ezren, the cleric Kyra, and elven rogue Merisiel. These stories—mostly previously published on the Paizo Blog—explore the characters’ origins, character, and prior adventures and set the stage for something we’ll chat about a little bit later.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Also in October, Paizo is proud to announce the tentpole release of the War of Immortals event, the aptly named <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02oar?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals">Pathfinder War of Immortals</a></em>hardcover rulebook. This 240-page hardcover (also available in special edition, retailer-exclusive sketch variant, and forthcoming pocket edition) will introduce mythic rules to Pathfinder Second Edition, as well as two brand new classes—the first original classes built on the remastered foundation of the <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em>—the animist and exemplar! In addition to loads of new character options, <em>War of Immortals </em>also explores Gorum’s death and the ramifications. Most notable among these is the Godsrain: a literal shower of the slain god’s blood, shattered armor, and divine essence that falls upon Golarion and every world on which he was worshiped, leaving war and mythic power in its wake. A book called <em>War of Immortals </em>would hardly be doing its job if it didn’t explain the selfsame conflict, an extended period of conflict in which gods struggle to survive a slew of divine deaths and mortals vie for the newly available god-sparks upsetting the balance of power.</p>
                  <p>October also brings our second War of Immortals tie-in adventure path, Triumph of the Tusk, beginning with <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02sxe?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-207-The-Resurrection-Flood">Pathfinder Adventure Path #207: The Resurrection Flood</a></em>, by Brian Duckwitz and John Compton, and adventure for 3rd-level characters. Triumph of the Tusk is a three-part monthly campaign in which an eclectic band of dignitaries become battle-hardened survivalists fighting for the orcs’ homeland and independence. “How does this tie into the larger War of Immortals?” you might ask. Well, let’s just say that Gorum isn’t the only god who’s going to die during this event, and some ancestral pantheons are going to get hit harder than others. For more info, you’ll just have to wait until October!</p>

                  <p>In November, we round out the products we’re announcing today (though the consequences of the Godsrain and War of Immortals will continue into 2025 and beyond) with two exciting new releases. The first, <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02oal?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Divine-Mysteries">Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</a></em>, explores, well, the divine mysteries of the setting and provides an overview of the gods and faiths common throughout the Age of Lost Omens, reflecting the changes to the setting brought about by the War of Immortals. You’ll notice that Arazni is featured prominently on the cover, and that’s because she’s graduating into the ranks of the Core Twenty to fill the vacancy left with Gorum’s death. While she won’t take on his mantle of war, she will nevertheless rise to more and more prominence within the setting as a new status quo materializes.</p>

                  <p>Finally, November also sees the return of long-format Pathfinder fiction to print with the much-anticipated <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02sx8?Pathfinder-Godsrain">Pathfinder Godsrain</a></em> by fan-favorite author Liane Merciel. Unlike previous novels published under the Pathfinder Tales brand from 2010 to 2017, <em>Godsrain </em>will debut as a deluxe hardcover with wraparound dustjacket and will feature Pathfinder’s popular Iconic heroes as its protagonists. In this exciting tale, Amiri, Ezren, Kyra, and Merisiel will witness Gorum’s death, receive their own nascent god-sparks, and even meet one of their patron deities as they take on a desperate quest to prevent the greatest threat Golarion has ever known from escaping an ancient prison. Can they use their unique talents, newfound mythic power, and the blessings of the Dawnflower to maintain the seal on the Dead Vault? You’ll just have to read and find out!</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>The advent of the War of Immortals on Golarion will necessitate seasoned warriors, and we’re answering that call with the newly announced Battlecry! Class Playtest, launching on April 29, 2024. During this public playtest, players will have the chance to put two new war-themed classes through their paces before their release in an as-yet-unannounced product coming in 2025. The commander is a martial support class that can issue commands to her allies, granting them extra movement, actions, reactions, and more. The guardian is an armored tank, who can taunt opponents and maximize the effectiveness of heavy armor to be a bulwark against nearly any threat. Be sure to try these exciting new classes out in just a few weeks!</p>
                  <p>That’s all the announcements we have for now, but we’ll have a lot more to say about these releases and more in the coming months, beginning at PaizoCon in May. Until then, you can catch up on yesterday’s stream on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PaizoInc">Twitch or YouTube</a> and join the conversation here, on the Paizo Forums, or any of the many social media communities where Pathfinder fans congregate.</p>

                 <blockquote>
                  <p itemprop="description">One of my favorite places aboard the <em>Zoetrope</em> was the menagerie, where I would tend to the flora and fauna we’d taken aboard temporarily for further study. Unfortunately, things were decidedly less peaceful this evening as I raced up the steps to the upper deck, pausing to catch my breath before a small blue creature scampered past me along the ship’s outer railing, giving me a dreadful start.</p>
                  <p>“She’s still not eating, Baranthet.” Charikleia came around the side, gingerly navigating the narrow space between the railing and the <em>Zoetrope</em>'s menagerie. Through the structure’s glass walls—perfect for letting in natural light—I could see our other specimens settling in for the evening amid the lush vegetation, under ballast rocks, or near the drinking pond. The little blue creature, however, swiveled her enormous amber ears in my direction as Chari spoke, resolutely ignoring the seedcake in Chari’s hand.</p>
                  <p>“Hmmm.” I leaned down and peered at our guest, who chirped plaintively at me in a way that sounded like speech. “Chari—”</p>
                  <p>“I agree,” she said, already scribbling notes. “That sounded like language. Can you understand us, little one?”</p>
                  <p>The creature surveyed us solemnly, then without warning sprang from the railing and scrambled through a window.</p>
                  <p>I let out a rather undignified yelp of surprise and hustled to the nearest door, Chari following soon after. Dr. Pom was at the helm this evening (she was always a bit more alert at night), and the <em>Zoetrope</em> was well underway; we couldn’t have our small guest accidentally falling overboard!</p>
                  <p>The tiny patter of paws overhead led us upstairs to the mess deck, where, sure enough, the creature perched in the doorway to Grefu’s kitchen, sniffing the air with a disappointed look.</p>
                  <p>“Well now, who’s this?” Grefu turned from a simmering pot and looked from the creature to us. “I didn’t set a place for an honored guest.”</p>
                  <p>She emitted the sound—a word?—again, but Grefu looked as nonplussed as the rest of us.</p>
                  <p>“Well, it’s not Jotun or Thalassic,” muttered Chari, surely making a mental note for our records. Before I could reply, the creature shot between the legs of the chairs and dining table and tore back downstairs. Grefu shrugged and returned to his work as Chari and I gave chase.</p>
                  <p>The creature was perched on a crate as we came downstairs to the storage area but looked almost disapprovingly at us before scrambling down the stairs to the next flight. We heard a “Goodness! What—?” from Dr. Pom as the creature chirped at her and continued down another level, then a clang a few seconds later. She must have already reached the engine room on the next deck down.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>&nbsp;“Hey; I need that!” called Ten as the creature emerged clutching a small gear in her hands. She chirped at them, placed the gear gently on the ground, and took off once more.</p>
                  <p>“She’s very energetic,” I observed to Chari, pausing to catch my breath.</p>
                  <p>“And she’s not speaking Surki either,” said Chari, who seemed unaffected by our unexpected evening exercise. “Oh no!”</p>
                  <p>We heard a distant splash and ran down another level to find the creature sputtering and pulling herself out of the access pipe leading down to the aquatic deck. She looked rather affronted as Lythea swam up the pipe and broke the surface, inadvertently splashing a few droplets onto the creature’s head.</p>
                  <p>“So sorry, little one,” our navigator said, holding out a hand. “How can we help?”</p>
                  <p>The creature instead clambered up onto Chari’s arm, flicking water from her ears. She chirped again. It sounded so familiar! I was increasingly convinced that lyrical chirp was, in fact, a word in a language I’d heard before.</p>
                  <p>“I’m going to stop for my notes before we go back up,” Chari called over her shoulder, turning down the hall toward the crew quarters. I followed her, thinking to peruse my own small collection and check again for any clues as to this creature’s identity.</p>
                  <p>“Professor, is that you?” Telero opened the door at the end of the hall, emerging from the shuttle bay just as I stepped into my own room. “Hey, who’s this?”</p>
                  <p>The creature, catching a glimpse of the darkening sky through the branches of the shuttle bay door, squawked and leapt from Chari’s shoulder to her head, climbing up one of her horns and chattering at Telero. He quickly closed the door behind him and approached slowly. “Hey there, it’s okay, friend,” he said. “You’re safe. What’s your name?”</p>
                  <p>The creature blinked at him, then chirped that same familiar syllable.</p>
                  <p>Telero frowned in confusion. “Gold?”</p>
                  <p>I’d become distracted while opening the door to my own room, bemoaning the untidy stack of scrolls and maps I’d meant to organize the previous day, but I turned at this. “Wait, did you say—?”</p>
                  <p>The creature leapt from Chari’s head and shot into my cabin, papers flying as she disappeared under my desk. I crouched at once to see her clutching my long-missing volume of <em>The Thrilling Tales of Spiridendra</em> (so that’s where it had gone!). She chirped once more.</p>
                  <p>“She’s saying ‘gold’ in Fey,” Telero said, he and Chari crowding in behind me.</p>
                  <p>“Of course,” I breathed, looking back up at Chari.</p>
                  <p>“A marp!”</p>
                  <p>“They usually communicate in both Common and Fey, but perhaps this one is too young,” I reasoned, reaching out for the book as she began to lick its gold embossing experimentally. “Wait, please! I’ll trade you.” I slowly reached into my pocket and withdrew a gold piece. “Would you like to return to the menagerie? We’ll make sure you’re well fed!”</p>
                  <p>The marp reluctantly relinquished her grip, but cheered up when she grasped the gold piece with her small hands. We climbed back up to the menagerie, the marp riding on Chari’s shoulder and crunching happily.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the crew gathered around to exclaim over our guest and her unique menu. (Ten dashed off and returned with an armful of metal scraps to see if the marp found anything else to her liking, but as you’ll see in Charikleia’s notes, gold remains the preferred meal.) As I looked around at my companions, the moonlight streaming through the menagerie’s glass dome, a wave of joy overcame me, as it has so often done on this journey—the joy of discovery, of reaching shared understanding, and of building communities. The joy of belonging.</p>
                  <p>The <em>Zoetrope</em> hummed quietly under our feet, whisking us away to our next adventure.</p>

                    Baranthet Zamendi cultivated his love of the natural world at a young age, enamored with his grandmother’s awe-inspiring tales of the legendary Wardens of the Wild. He briefly attended Almas University before returning home to rebuild Droon’s public library, eventually becoming its head archivist. His upcoming book on the crew of the <em>Zoetrope</em> and their search for the wardens is his first, but he’s already planning his next adventure.</p>

                  <p>Good morning, explorers! While we’ve taken a look at the crew you’ll see throughout <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, we realized there’s one more character we still needed to introduce: the <em>Zoetrope</em> itself! This unique airship serves as a home to our eccentric crew as they search Golarion for the Wardens of the Wild and features its own onboard menagerie, darkroom, research deck, and aquarium for all their exploratory needs.</p>

                  <p>It's hard to believe our foray through the Zoetrope logs is at a close. But this is just a taste of Baranthet’s story, and we hope that you’ll want to take part when <em>Howl of the Wild</em> releases next month. Look forward to seeing some more tidbits about all the creatures, options, items, and more coming in the book, and let us know what sort of expedition <em>your</em> characters are thinking about going on!</p>
                  <p>But that, explorers, is a story for another day.</p>

                 </div>
                 <p><strong>What is a game jam?</strong><br>
                   A game jam is an event designed to create something from scratch during a timed period. In this case, all entries will be due no later than <strong>May 1st, 2024.</strong></p>
                 <p><strong>What is the game jam theme?</strong><br></p>
                 <p>The theme marries with the PaizoCon 2024 theme: <em>Educate, Entertain, and Inspire!</em></p>
                 <p><strong>Who can participate?</strong><br>
                   Anyone! All you need is a customer account for DriveThru sites.</p>
                 <p><strong>Why should I participate? </strong><br>
                   Aside from it’s a blast to jam together with the community, you’ll get promotions from Paizo, DriveThruRPG, and Pathfinder/Starfinder Infinite; you will be providing a very cool option for GMs to bring to their table; and you’ll be challenging yourself as a creator or bringing an idea from your table to life.</p>
                 <p><strong>What are the rules?</strong></p>
                 <ul>
                  <li>Must fit one page, double sided. <em>(Technically, it will be two pages of a single-page PDF or a two-page spread. When someone prints it out, they’ll have one sheet with information front and back)</em></li>
                  <li>Must be uploaded to Pathfinder Infinite or Starfinder Infinite before <strong>May 1st, 2024</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Must follow the <a href="https://help.pathfinderinfinite.com/hc/en-us/categories/12777144310039-Community-Content-Creator-Questions">Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite Guidelines</a></li>
                  <li>When you’re finished setting up your title, please keep it <strong>private</strong>. We will turn all of them to be available for purchase slightly before PaizoCon.</li>
                  <li>Email <a href="mailto:meredith@roll20.net">meredith@roll20.net</a> with a link to your private URL, your customer email, and a two-sentence synopsis.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p><strong>Do you have a font size restriction? </strong></p>
                 <p>No. You’re welcome to make the font any size you’d like, but we recommend at least 9.5 for readability.</p>
                 <p><strong>Do I have to put artwork in?</strong></p>
                 <p>Not a requirement! We recommend keeping it simple so people can easily print it out. You’re welcome to also make a printer-friendly version to upload alongside your submission (so, two files!) if your submission needs color, art, and flourish!</p>
                 <p><strong>I submitted my title. Now what?</strong></p>
                 <p>Pathfinder Infinite/Starfinder Infinite will notify you when it is live and when Paizo posts a “round up” promoting it the week of PaizoCon.</p>
                 <p><strong>Can I make changes? Won’t that cause problems for the URL I send?</strong></p>
                 <p>You are welcome to make changes to your submission—the PDF(s), the description, title—at any time.</p>
                 <p><strong>Can I charge for this?</strong></p>
                 <p>Absolutely! Infinite Masters are recommending at least 99 cents. You are not required to charge but we always recommend it because you should charge for the work you did!&nbsp;</p>
                 <p>We cannot wait to see what you create!</p>

                 <p itemprop="description">Hello, everyone! Today we’re giving you a sneak peek into our two upcoming multi-table interactive events for the 2024 Paizo Organized Play season!</p>
                 <p>Every year, Pathfinder Organized Play and Starfinder Organized Play each release one multi-table event that can be played with as few as three tables and well over 150+ tables at the world’s largest gaming events. These are intended to be epic adventures where players work alongside each other to accomplish monumental feats and battle great evils. In the past, these events were tied to key story points for Organized Play. In recent years, our special events have been standalone adventures that tell exciting but isolated stories, making them usable at conventions and special events for many years to come. This year, we’re continuing this trend, with two exciting interactive events that are standalone, so they can be enjoyed by anyone at any time.</p>
                 <p>Debuting at PaizoCon 2024, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ezb?Starfinder-Society-Special-699-The-End-Awakens"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-99: The End Awakens</em></a> is an adventure for 1st- through 4th-level characters written by Joseph Blomquist and Mike Kimmel.</p>
                 <p>Every year the Starfinder Society dispatches agents to perform initial exploration and surveys of hundreds of worlds, identifying resources, cataloging biological samples, mapping terrain, and initiating peaceful contact. This year is no different. …Or is it?</p>
                 <p>Respected Starfinder Palivhar Chooser of Hues, has recently discovered a planet they believe to be Krethiskar, a “missing” planet in the distant Szandite Collective that failed to reconnect after the Gap. Keen on investigating further, Palivhar leads an expedition of rookie Starfinders to Krethiskar’s surface, to conduct initial surveys and routine testing.</p>
                 <p>Unfortunately for the Starfinder Society, Krethiskar is a huskworld consumed by the voracious Swarm in ages past, and this mission is anything but routine. Palivhar’s survey expedition is doomed to become a desperate fight for survival, as the hibernating Swarm awaken. Can you escape the planet alive?</p>
                 <p>I hope you join us on Krethiskar for this year’s interactive special!</p>

                 <p>Premiering at Gen Con 2024, <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-00: Salt of the Ocean</em> is an adventure for 1st- through 8th-level characters written by Rigby Bendele and Jacob W. Michaels.</p>
                 <p>As the year turns over and different events start to pick up across Golarion, two things of interest are discovered as the Eye of Abendego, the massive hurricane off the coast of the Mwangi Expanse, shifts and turns. The first is a shipwreck of an old Pathfinder ship, <em>the Whippoorwill,</em> and the second is an island of legend spoken only in the stories of the crumbled Ghol-Gan empire, the Island of Teeth and Terror.</p>
                 <p>Hurricane Queen Tessa Fairwind has reached out to the Pathfinder Society to inform them of both discoveries, prompting an expedition to see what can be found on both the ship and the island. However, the Island of Teeth and Terror is also the goal of the notorious pirate Sharkskin, spurred on by xir companion and mentor, Enava, who has her own plans for the nephilim and the island.</p>
                 <p>Can the Pathfinders put a stop to these nefarious plans? Can you survive the threats within the Abendego Ocean?</p>
                 <p>Gather your sea legs, Pathfinders!</p>

                 <p itemprop="description"><em>Despite my apprehension at reading about the deaths of so many of Golarion’s gods and my continuing belief that these </em>Godsrain Prophecies <em>cannot be taken at their word, I still feel a bit wistful about reaching the end of my analysis. While it is certainly possible that there are other prophecies in this vein, this is the last that I will read before delivering the collection to my Lady. </em></p>
                 <p><em>I am not sure why I feel so hesitant to put this work aside. Of course, there is something satisfying about feeling like you are a part of important research, even if the experience of it is less than pleasant. (I think here of those who have documented the beliefs of faiths that are somewhat more difficult to understand, as in</em> To Scream Is Divine: My Year at a Nidalese Temple <em>and its somewhat more uneven follow-up,</em> Kuthite Lullabies<em>.) Beyond that, though, I believe I will miss the gods themselves—or at least the insights into them that these texts have given me, even when I don’t believe a word that I am reading.</em></p>
                 <p><em>After reviewing the entirety of the</em> Godsrain Prophecies<em>, I am confident in one thing and one thing only: that the author has been made privy, whether through prophecy or otherwise, to the fact that one of Golarion’s gods will die. The preoccupation with the subject of a dead god, accuracy of some of the smaller details, and feeling of anticipation throughout are compelling evidence in favor of my theory. With all the contradictions and confusions in the text, though, I do not believe that the author knows which god, how they die, or why. </em></p>
                 <p><em>Unfortunately, this is where my certainty ends, as there are several different reasons why the author may have taken this information and used it to create the prophecies. It is possible that they feared what might happen and wrote these prophecies as a warning, attempting to prevent the dangers they dreamed up. It is also possible that they hope the death will be a destabilizing event, and that they intended for these prophecies to weaken faith and trust in the gods, making them easier to abandon in the aftermath of a catastrophe. There is no way to know, as I will admit to my Lady; I hope that in her wisdom, she can discern the truth.</em></p>

                 <h2>The “Death” of Rovagug</h2>
                 <p>The chant starts as a whisper—an idle piece of pillow talk on nights Sarenrae cannot sleep, her fingertips gone marching on the canvas that is Shelyn’s back, her hands casting surging shadows onto Desna’s resting arm. She weaves a tale of how to win the battle that she hungers for, imagining alliances that span across the Great Beyond and speaking life to victory until the passion of her dream becomes a shared ambition. All three lovers make mention of it, idly, to those who share their interests, pitched in a tone and timbre meant to echo in the listener’s chest. The message drums with nostalgia tinged with rage and thirst for justice long delayed, and it is passed along from ear to ear until it finally circles back, a call to action with the deadly urgency of war.</p>
                 <p><em>Imprisonment is not enough. Rovagug must die.</em></p>
                 <p>There are more gods now than there were when Rovagug was sealed away, and many sign up for the quest to kill the Great Destroyer, to stand alongside Abadar and Gozreh and Calistria. Some do so to show their mettle, some to gather bragging rights, and some to reassure themselves that if there is something to gain, they won’t leave empty-handed. Sarenrae worries, privately, that many do not understand the danger they’ve signed up for, but she takes the names and notes the skills and hands the roles out all the same—rear guard to those who fear but fight, support for those who dwell in hope, melee for those who want to feel the blood beneath their fingers.</p>
                 <p>At first, it seems too easy. Asmodeus unlocks the seal that leads into the Dead Vault and gods pour through in something like a line. Wrackworms turn from feasting on the Rough Beast’s flesh to face them, but fall to sword and spell and scythe as if they were an afterthought, slicking the ground around themselves with remnants of their dying. After the cheers and murmurs fade, a gnawing silence fills the air, thick and dank and hungry, and for a moment, no one moves, a huddled mass of godhood waiting for something to happen.</p>
                 <p>Then Rovagug is everywhere—suddenly, impossibly. Rending, clawing, tearing open, shoveling exalted flesh into his waiting mouths. Apsu’s wing is torn asunder. Hei Feng’s feathers fall like rain. Grandmother Spider holds her own, her arms a whirling blur of blades, but watches as Thamir falls still, body crushed beneath a claw, and Hanspur drowns a second time, awash in his own blood. But Rovagug, despite his power, cannot overcome them all, and soon the tide of battle changes, rattling the prison’s walls as gods press their advantages, slamming his body side to side—an endless, rhythmic dying.</p>
                 <p>With each impact on the Dead Vault’s walls, Golarion is shaken. Buildings tumble into streets. Rivers shift to find new banks. Old trees flatten forests. Volcanoes long thought dormant, from Taldor to the Five Kings Mountains, spit dense ash into the sky, blanketing the life around them and blocking out the sun. The Eye of Abendego expands twofold, turning the Mwangi Expanse into newly Sodden Lands. When Rovagug is finally still, Sarenrae standing by his head with her arms held high in victory, the gods emerge from the Dead Vault to find a world that thinks the end has come.</p>
                 <p>After all the dead are mourned, no one agrees on what comes next. The aftermath grows tense and bitter, victory turned vicious. With Rovagug no threat to them, godly alliances feel heavier, a burden to be shrugged off or set down and ignored. How to rebuild a ruined land becomes the stuff of smaller wars—Abadar feuds with Erastil, Irori shuns Iomedae, Sarenrae feels the weight of blame hurled at her from every corner, and Norgorber sides with anyone who might advance his cause. But while they bicker here and now, the gods may yet unite again, as deep in Avistani soil, disturbed by distant tremors, the worst of Rovagug’s spawn have felt their prison falter and ready for destruction that would make their sire proud.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 13px;">While imprisoned, Rovagug maintains the peace between the gods, but in his absence, what prevents war between the immortals?</p>

                 <p><em>That is certainly one way to end things. If I am being honest, the idea of Rovagug trapped within the bowels of Golarion has always made me a bit nervous, but it seems it may be better than the alternative! Which gives me one final idea as to why these prophecies exist—perhaps they argue against change and tell those who read them that, even for those gods whom you might fear or hate, the status quo is better than anything new that you might long for—a desperate version of a wish that, no matter what they have seen coming, it would be best for things to continue as they are. Sadly for the author, change, I believe, is inevitable. I hope only that we are ready and that we meet it, heads held high and wings outstretched, however and whenever it comes.</em></p>

                 <p itemprop="description">From first light to sunset, the Indraracha Institute bustles with activity. The docks continually ferry people in and out of the campus. Meal, study, repeat—every day is a routine at the academy, a routine strengthening the minds and sharpening the skills of the future sorcerers and politicians of Tang Mai.</p>
                 <p>For one young boy, though, things were different. School was just school. Sometimes, all he wanted to do was to just run around, not bury himself nose-deep in a book about the nation’s history. One morning, he was doing just that—running through the halls of the Institute, weaving between his classmates that filled rooms and corridors studying all things magical.</p>
                 <p>Asok’s circuit ended in one of the many gardens. Resting under a tall banyan tree, the boy began to doze off. He snapped his eyes open when he heard a familiar voice.</p>
                 <p>“What are you doing here?” A tattooed young man strode over, a basket of herbs in hand.</p>
                 <p>“Thanom!” The boy scrambled up to his feet, putting his hands together in a greeting. “I’m just on my way to study hall... unless you need help in the gardens?” He gave a wide grin.</p>
                 <p>“And take you away from your studies? Your instructors will have my head! And if I’m gone, there will be even fewer people who tolerate your behavior.” He pulled out a mangosteen and handed the fruit to Asok. “Now go to class. Next time I need help, <em>I’ll</em> come to <em>you</em>. When you’re not trying to hide from your instructors.”</p>
                 <p>Asok gave another huge grin to the alchemist before rushing off to his class, conveniently located in a quieter corner of the Institute. He tucked himself alongside his classmates as they all settled in, twisting open the mangosteen and eating the meat inside. Mali, his seatmate, glared. In return, he smiled and offered a piece to her, but she turned her head away in annoyance.</p>
                 <p>“Remember, students, placement tests are coming up soon. While you all are young, it’s important you take your exams seriously.” Teacher Chai walked around, handing out textbooks. “We want to make sure you all end up learning subjects you enjoy and excel at.”</p>
                 <p>Asok opened the book to the lines, “Sorcerer diplomats provide the Chaophaya counsel and identify magical phenomena to aid them in their rule. Following the precepts of the Indraracha Institute, diplomats must be impartial...” The text was dizzying.</p>
                 <p>“Aiyyyyy, I’m tired,” he groaned.</p>
                 <p>“Shhhhh!” Mali nudged him. “Stop complaining. You’re going to get us in trouble.”</p>
                 <p>“It’s hot and it’s sooooo boring.” Asok began fanning himself with the textbook.</p>
                 <p>“It’s always hot,” the girl reminded him, “and you say everything is boring.”</p>
                 <p>Asok nudged her back. In a huff, they both started jostling each other, though mostly in jest.</p>
                 <p>Their instructor eyed them with suspicion, but before he could say anything, sparks coalesced in the air.</p>
                 <p>“Teacher Chai!” An illusion of an older student sprung into being. “Apologies for the disturbance—we could use some assistance with an artifact in the south research laboratory.”</p>
                 <p>“Of course. Right away.” The instructor turned to the class, saying, “Now, students, be diligent while I’m gone,” before hurrying out.</p>
                 <p>In the heat and humidity, diligent self-study didn’t last long. Mischievous as ever, Asok got to his feet and reached for the magic within him. A small flame sparked to life in his hand.</p>
                 <p>“Asok, stop,” Mali chided. “You shouldn’t be doing that.”</p>
                 <p>“Come on, we’re studying, right?” Asok juggled the flame between his fingers. “If we don’t break anything, it’s fine. Unless you’re a scaredy-cat?”</p>

                 <br>
                 <p>“Am not!” She frowned before standing up, a spell coming to her as easy as breath. “You know I’m sooooo much better than you at casting.”</p>
                 <p>Students discarded their textbooks and started chatting among themselves. In a moment, the alcove filled with all sorts of spells. A young nagaji girl conjured a bubble of water and began shaping it into a flower. Another student drew a monstrous face on a nearby stone before levitating it to chase their classmates through the alcove.</p>
                 <p>Between the two rival factions, a heated competition quickly drew the class’s attention. Mali shot her hand up in the air, spraying an array of bright colors. The crowd was mesmerized with the lights. She gave her opponent a playful grin.</p>
                 <p>Asok huffed, “It’s just colors—isn’t this so much cooler?” He caught the ember in his fist before shooting it out. The small burst of fire cut through the rainbow. The boy puffed his chest in pride.</p>
                 <p>The “oooohs” from the crowd turned to a giggle as Mali wiggled her fingers and a second image of Asok appeared next to him. While crude, the illusion was unmistakably of the boy. It hopped around, flexing in an exaggerated manner. Asok frowned at his double, which frowned back.</p>
                 <p>Not to be outdone, Asok threw his memory and being back into his blood, finding the might of elementals. He breathed in deep before releasing a gust of flame that spilled from his lips and billowed outwards. The fire dispersed the illusion before launching upward to the sky. Asok was careful to not let it hit Mali or their classmates, but the size of the breath was growing larger than he could control. The expanding heat licked the roof of the outdoor galleries that surrounded their study area, lighting up small pieces of foliage.</p>
                 <p>“Asok! Look what you did,” Mali yelled, taking a step back from the sparks.</p>
                 <p>“I didn’t mean to,” Asok stammered, ashamed about his mistake. “I—I’m sorry!”</p>
                 <p>&nbsp;“Come on, we have to stop this before Teacher Chai comes back.”</p>
                 <p>The nagaji student guided her water magic to the fire. While it extinguished some of it, the flames were spreading faster than she could handle. The class chipped in with various spells, with little impact.</p>
                 <p>Suddenly, a chill wind gusted through the alcove, frost trailing in its wake and collecting on the stones. The winds roared across the roof, blowing the fires out as easily as candles, making Asok and Mali shiver and clutch their arms close despite the fires and the Tang Mai sun. Turning around, the students saw Teacher Chai with an expressionless face, magic still trailing from his fingers as his incantation left him.</p>
                 <p>“Spellcraft is not allowed without instructor supervision at your age.” Teacher Chai said sternly as he walked toward the panicked students. “I expected as much from you, Asok. But you, Mali...”</p>
                 <p>“I—I—I’m sorry, Teacher!” Mali bowed her head, “We tried to stop it ourselves. We know it was wrong, but—”</p>
                 <p>The teacher put a hand up to stop the student. “While you all showed responsibility in fixing your mistakes, magic is volatile. One misstep, one wrong incantation, can cause chaos. Now, back to your studies.”</p>
                 <p>As the young students began to quiet down and shrink themselves back into their texts, Teacher Chai looked at Asok and Mali. “Though, I must admit it was quite the impressive feat. You two have the makings of incredible sorcerers.”</p>

                 <p>The mods at r/Pathfinder2e saw a need to help bring Pathfinder to new players, and thus Beginner Box Days were born! This year, events will be running <strong>between April 13th and April 21st</strong>. Using the power of the internet, we have been able to connect new players hungry to try Pathfinder Second Edition with experienced GMs. So, how can you get involved?</p>
                 <div class="blurbCenter">
                  <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/2338a9e6-f843-4c5f-a098-ce1375c189c9/BeginnerBoxDay_Splashimage_2024.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/2338a9e6-f843-4c5f-a098-ce1375c189c9/BeginnerBoxDay_Splashimage_2024.png" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Beginner Box Days: April 13th to the 21st - BeginPF2.com"></a>
                  <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                 </div>
                 <br>
                 <p><strong>RUN A GAME!</strong> GMs can register their game at RPGChronicles.net using event code <strong>2716006</strong>. Once you set up events for both the Upper and Lower levels, players will be able to join your game starting TODAY! You can run games in your local time zone or even in a non-English language to help introduce the next generation of Pathfinder players to the game. Just make sure to get a Beginner Box module version for your VTT of choice or request a FREE PDF copy from Paizo through our form at <strong>BeginPF2.com</strong>.</p>
                 <p><strong>PLAY A GAME!</strong> Starting TODAY players can register themselves for both levels of Paizo’s remastered Beginner Box adventure: <em>Menace under Otari</em>! Each level is designed to slowly introduce the player to important aspects of the game, from combat to skills to puzzles! The Upper Level is the starter level, where you’ll investigate Tamily Tanderveil’s basement to investigate who (or what) is stealing her fish. This level is best for people who are brand new to playing Pathfinder or any TTRPG. The Lower level introduces more challenges as you begin to uncover the menace under the logging town of Otari, putting your new skills to the ultimate test! Players can play one level, or both, by finding a slot that matches their availability and signing up on <strong>BeginPF2.com</strong>.</p>
                 <p><strong>EARN SOCIETY CREDIT!</strong> Both GMs and players can earn society credit that you can use on your first official character. The Beginner Box is played in Adventure Mode so you can try any class or ancestry that your GM will allow, or play any of Paizo’s remastered pregenerated characters if you just want to get rolling! To earn society credit, simply add your Paizo Organized Play number on RPGChronicles when you create or sign up to a game. We will be reporting all sessions, but it is not necessary to join Pathfinder Society to participate in Beginner Box Days.</p>
                 <p>Paizo has also given us a stack of vouchers we’ll be raffling off to players and GMs, which we’ll distribute after all games are reported. Also, <em>Rise of the Rulelords</em> podcast <em>and </em>Team + Publishing are giving away 3 physical remastered Beginner Boxes, and Team + will be raffling away bundles of their best-selling class expansions! <strong>So don’t wait! Begin your next adventure, or help someone start their own at BeginPF2.com!</strong></p>

                 <h2>Convention News</h2>
                 <p>Convention season is in full swing! There are dozens of local conventions happening this spring around the world and online. Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Paizo Conventions Calendar</a> for details on everything going on in the months to come.</p>
                 <p>Of course, the convention looming largest on my mind is PaizoCon! We’re less than two months away from Paizo’s first major convention of the year, and I cannot wait. <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sijd?Get-Your-Tickets-for-PaizoCon-Online-2024">Badges are on sale now</a>; stay tuned to the blog later today for more news on signing up for events.</p>
                 <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2>
                 <p>The Pathfinder Remaster has gained another pillar! Last week we released <em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em>, available now on paizo.com or at your FLGS (with an exclusive sketch cover!). Sanctioning for <em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em> has also been added to the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions#monster-core">Pathfinder Character Options page</a>, though the vast majority of this content is only relevant for those of you with summoning spells.</p>
                 <p>Additionally, the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> got a slight tweak thanks to the Remaster. Any deity who grants <em>dreaming potential</em> instead grants their followers <em>illusory scene</em>, effective immediately.</p>
                 <p>Unfortunately, I botched the calendar, so the sanctioning documents for <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em> have been delayed slightly. At press time for this blog, they’re not ready yet, but I expect them to be available very soon!</p>
                 <p>This month sees the release of the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>, the first of our two Tian Xia-focused books, to be followed by the Tian Xia Character Guide at the end of August. I expect sanctioning for this book to go live on street date! After that, May sees two exciting releases with <em>Howl</em><em> of the Wild</em> and <em>Mechageddon!</em>, the final Adventure Path for Starfinder First Edition.</p>
                 <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                 <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                 <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                 <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th rank!</p>
                 <p><strong>5th Nova (SFS1)</strong>: Joel Hager</p>
                 <p>That’s all from me this month, folks! Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the eclipse!</p>

                 <p><em>Unfortunately, this need for clarity means that I must dismiss (or at least deemphasize) one of the more exciting ideas I have come up with thus far: that these are a collection of the gods’ fears. I have noted throughout these pages that there are responses to the gods’ deaths in each of the prophecies that seem out of character, either for the other gods or their followers, but I don’t believe this lack of consistency is due to these being reflections of what a god would worry over. In truth, I am not sure that gods fear anything at all. Is fear not driven by a sense of mortality, or at least, the potential for one’s role in the world to change or end at a moment’s notice? I wonder if, instead, the “prophecies” are intended to help the gods develop fear, to remind them that they are not beyond the reach of death and give them a small taste of mortal terror. Though to what end, I do not know. Who would want to give a god a nightmare?</em></p>

                 <h2>The “Death” of Irori</h2>
                 <p>Irori is not one for dying. Death is common. Death is normal. Death is there for mortals who have not yet mastered how to reach new levels of perfection, who have not willed themselves into attaining the divine. Death might take some weaker god if given the right circumstances, starting with those cheaters who let the <em>Starstone</em> grant them power, grabbing godhood like some prize for drunks and thieves and zealots. But for a god like him, who’d worked and willed himself to godhood? Death is something of the past and he is moving forward.</p>
                 <p>Irori’s never rested long, no matter his successes. There’s always some new path to take at any well-earned milestone, some new technique to master, some new knowledge to find. Yes, it was good to be a god, if for no other reason than to share new possibilities with those who’d turn their will toward doing better with their lives. But he is one of many gods—some virtuous, some indolent—and so there must be something more, some way that he can still evolve. Some new route toward perfection.</p>
                 <p>Irori works with diligence, the way that he has always done, reaching beyond the world he’s known to better what he has become. Until one day, he grasps it all—the spaces in the sum of things, the power in the truth of everything that was or will be. And though total enlightenment is only for a moment, slipping between his fingers like a cloud of windblown sand, he still can feel the barrier between himself and something more, as pliable and thin as what once kept him from divinity. While he has it in his reach, he passes through the boundary, as bracing and as easy as a step through falling water. Irori, once a mortal, is now much more than deity.</p>
                 <p>Irori savors everything, if only for a moment. He takes a breath in every plane, his heartbeat now a multiverse, and feels the coursing power as it crashes through his veins. But he has departed our reality, has left a tear along the border of the way of things, and everything, on every plane, begins to shift toward him, as if he were a beacon for something within the Great Beyond—a single life, a single god, become a singularity. Gruhastha is the first to fall, the Keeper’s arms stretched uselessly, hands grasping at the emptiness he finds beside Irori’s feet. He’s swallowed by a void that somehow still contains a multitude, his body torn asunder in a bright and blissful darkness, his lips mouthing his gratitude, his throat choking on screams.</p>
                 <p>Irori is a magnet now, pulling those closest to him; Chaldira’s luck lost in a cry while Magrim’s runes go tumbling, some force dragging them both to places even he can’t follow. All he can do is close the gap before it sunders everything, using the power that he holds, still far beyond what it once was, to fix whatever he has done (or is doing or one day will, time half-unraveling in his hands). As he repairs the barrier, still dripping with the power that he touched from passing through it, Zon-Kuthon comes to stand beside him, image of the blinding void reflected in his longing eyes, and Nethys tries to touch the power nestled just beneath his skin, hands clawing unknown patterns of magic in the air. Both soon become his shadows, hounding every move he tries to make, Zon-Kuthon chasing memories and Nethys seeking answers, with Torag always close behind, holding his brother Magrim’s blade with vengeance on his mind. Some of Irori’s followers also trail behind him; those who were deep in prayer at the moment that he moved beyond, unable to unsee the void, dedicate themselves to its return, doing whatever they can to hasten the end of all things.</p>
                 <p>But Irori has a new path now, divinity left far behind as he masters the power that’s now deep within his bones. He sees things now—beneath the ground, between the breaths, inside the skin—and knows that they will take him where Gruhastha and the rest have gone, that what tore them apart will help him make himself anew. If there are prayers for him to hear, he is no longer listening. If rakshasas take his guise and use his faith to build their power? If Urgathoa’s clerics tell his followers that next time he will end the world and they should eat and drink and die with no thought for tomorrow? How can he care when there’s a new path for him to gain perfection? And if the world unmakes itself, if he had to unmake the world, if that brings him enlightenment, then that’s what it must be.</p>

                 <p><em>Well, that was certainly involved. Multiverses? Singularities? Bright voids? And yet, in all of that, I almost see a pattern. I have tried not to reference other prophecies in my notes here; if my Lady chooses to read them out of the original order that I chose, I would hate for her to learn a piece of information in these notes that would be better divulged by the original text. Still, I am reminded of the prophecy regarding Desna, which also mentions a void. And there are similarities between this prophecy and the one for Nethys, not only in their reciprocal mentions but in their fascination with the fundamental properties of our universe. Perhaps instead of looking at the prophecies individually, I should be looking for these types of commonalities—could things that are repeated be elements of some underlying message, or a hint as to what among these “prophecies” might be true amidst the overstatements and suppositions? If there was ever a time to make a chart, that time is upon us.</em></p>

                 <p itemprop="description">The next morning dawned bright and clear, no trace of the previous day’s storm left on the horizon. Dr. Pom joined me on the research deck for our customary morning tea, sipping in companionable silence until we’d finished our first cup and were contemplating our second.</p>
                 <p>“How are you feeling, Baranthet?” she asked kindly as she held out her cup for a refill. “That was an intense day of travel yesterday.”</p>
                 <p>“Quite well, thank you,” I said as I poured, reveling in the wisps of aromatic steam rising from our mugs. “How are you? Are you used to storms like that where you’re from?”</p>
                 <p>She took a moment to consider this, her eyes following the gulls soaring over the cliffs. “We did have some mighty storms, yes, but it’s different now,” she said thoughtfully. “The instinct to seek shelter is the same, of course, but there’s... a deeper appreciation, I suppose. A sense of thinking about the past and the future, whereas before there was only the present moment. I find joy in their beauty and feel appreciation for the sheer primal power of the skies. Though,” she said with a laugh, “I never expected to be <em>flying</em> in those skies in the middle of one!”</p>
                 <p>“Neither did I,” I admitted, grinning. “A humbling and awe-inspiring experience, to be sure!”</p>
                 <p>We sat in comfortable silence for a while as the others drifted in for breakfast or set about their tasks for the day. I wondered idly where my <em>Spiridendra</em> book had gone and what we might find next in our journey as I watched Telero and Ten examine one of the ship’s wings—they’d been busy checking and recalibrating this and that after the flight through the storm the day before. For my part, it was nice to have a slower morning before returning to the expedition.</p>
                 <p>“It’s wild, isn’t it,” Dr. Pom said softly, “looking back on the changes you’ve weathered in your life?” Her eyes met mine, and though we were close in years, I sensed she wasn’t talking merely about aging.</p>
                 <p>“I certainly never thought I’d go from ink-stained librarian to bold explorer,” I said fervently, and she chuckled, her small spectacles slipping down her striped snout. “When you awakened, did you ever plan on having such adventures?”</p>
                 <p>“It was hard to make plans at all, at first.” She adjusted her glasses and looked back out over the cliffs. “Awakening is... a turbulent time, for most. There’s a lot of information to process all at once, and many of us are overwhelmed by the concept of a vaster and more specific future than what we’d previously had the capacity to consider. But I always felt called to be a healer,” she added, and smiled again. “I know what it’s like to be hurt, and afraid. It gladdens me to provide comfort and support where I can.”</p>
                 <p>I reflected on this as I watched Telero hoist Ten higher up the wing, where they began to hammer at one of its joints. Suddenly, tension released in an explosive pop, the wing springing back into place… and catapulting our mechanic overboard, falling past Telero’s arms to land with a thud and a yelp in the water below.</p>
                 <p>“Goodness, not again!” Dr. Pom and I were on our feet at once, tea abandoned. Grefu surfaced in the waves near our mechanic (no doubt he was enjoying his morning constitutional), and swam Ten over to the research deck, hoisting them aboard. Their eyes blinked rapidly at us as we gathered around.</p>
                 <p>Dr. Pom knelt next to them, illuminating the lamp at her shoulder and setting her bag down as she looked them over.</p>

                 <p>“It’s my fault, Professor,” Telero said in anguish. “I tried to catch them—”</p>
                 <p>“It is not his fault; the wing was badly jammed from the storm; it was more badly misaligned than I thought,” Ten chirped in their customary staccato tone, their eyes glittering as Dr. Pom shone her light in one and then the other. “Do not fret; I feel fine; and that should be the last of the repairs!”</p>
                 <p>“I keep telling you to use your safety lines when you’re doing repairs,” said Dr. Pom, ignoring this tale of triumph as she peered into her patient’s eyes. “You seem coherent, but I’d like to confirm, please. What’s your name?”</p>
                 <p>“Whose Antenna Is Askew,” they replied promptly, wiggling the appendage in question. “You know me; I am the ship’s mechanic; you’ve patched me up many times before.”</p>
                 <p>Dr. Pom smiled wryly and looked up at me. “They’re all right.” She rummaged about in her belt, retrieving a slip of paper and weighing several powders and herbs onto it. “Take this before you tuck in tonight. It should help your carapace mend.”</p>
                 <p>An aggrieved Telero relaxed slightly next to me as Ten withdrew the frayed checkered cloth that was always at their toolbelt and dried their face. “Telero; now the repairs are done; do you want to check the cliffs for geodes?” they said, pointing at the shore.</p>
                 <p>Dr. Pom and I left the young friends to their explorations as they boarded the airskiff for shore, but I checked in on our mechanic later that evening. They were in the engine room, as usual, cleaning various gears and leaning close to the engine to listen to its steady hum.</p>
                 <p>I knocked on the doorframe. “Doing all right, Ten?”</p>
                 <p>They jumped and dropped what appeared to be an armful of wrenches, the tools clanging on the floor and narrowly missing their feet. “So sorry; you surprised me; please come in; hello.”</p>
                 <p>“Oh! The fault is mine,” I said, crouching down to help them collect everything. “You’re still feeling well?”</p>
                 <p>Ten nodded. “My carapace is very tough; it’s held up through worse falls; I am fine; thank you.”</p>
                 <p>I smiled at their earnest assurances. “I’m glad to hear it! And the <em>Zoetrope</em>? Everything running smoothly?”</p>
                 <p>“Running like a dream,” Ten said, casting their expert eye over the complex machinery that made our expedition possible. “The good kind of dream; the ones with friends; and cookies; and adventures. Like what we have.”</p>
                 <p>How had I been so fortunate as to find such bright, kind, brave, and talented companions? “Like what we have,” I agreed, handing over the last of the wrenches. “A dream come—”</p>
                 <p>“Come quick!” a voice yelled from above. “One of the specimens has escaped from the menagerie!”</p>

                 <br>
                 <p>Hi everyone! James here again to talk about the last two ancestries featured in <em>Howl of the Wild</em>. We’ve saved the awakened animal and surki for last, as they’re quite different from the ancestries we’ve put out so far! Each uses its heritage in a pretty different way than any ancestries we’ve published previously, so we’ll be previewing those here instead of some feats.</p>
                 <p>&nbsp;The awakened animal freely chooses their size (from Tiny to Large) as a part of character creation, which also determines their starting Hit Points. Afterward, they choose a heritage that represents their general body plan. Your heritage will usually give you some suggestions for an unarmed attack that replaces the fist attack that most ancestries get, but given how broad the animal world is—some aquatic animals have wing attacks, after all—these are treated as suggestions to work out with your GM rather than as hard restrictions. The climbing animal heritage showcased below is great for a bipedal animal, like Dr. Pom.</p>
                 <h3>Climbing Animal Heritage</h3>
                 <p>You are an animal whose limbs are adapted to grab, climb, and brachiate. You might be dexterous and ready to use tools like a chimpanzee or otter, or you may simply be a quick climber like a bear, raccoon, or sloth.</p>
                 <p>You have a land Speed of 20 feet, a climb Speed of 20 feet, and one animal attack of your choice (typically claw, fist, or jaws; see the animal attacks sidebar).&gt;[?</p>
                 <p>Surkis also approach heritages in an unusual way. Surkis absorb magic as larva and young adults, which accumulates in nodes throughout their bodies. All surkis freely choose a tradition of magic at character creation that represents the type of magic they most consumed as a larva, which affects the tradition of their magical abilities (plus a few others). Then, they also choose a heritage. A surki can then, later in life, undergo metamorphosis to develop these nodes into unique magic-projecting organs. Each surki heritage has a base ability as well as two possible directions they can evolve the ability later by taking feats such as the 9th-level Grand Metamorphosis. Surkis can even gain multiple heritages or change their heritage late in life with various feats as well! We can take a look at this with the light-emitting lantern surki heritage below:</p>
                 <br>
                 <h3>Lantern Surki</h3>
                 <p>The nodes in your abdomen are particularly luminous. You can use an Interact action to shed light from your abdomen in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet). This is a magical light effect with a level equal to your own. You can change the color of the light or extinguish it with another Interact action.</p>
                 <p><b>Evolution</b> Your abdominal nodes have evolved into a pair of secondary limbs that project a magical focusing lens. You gain the Lantern Beam action.<br><b>Lantern Beam</b> [one-action] (light, fire, magical) <b>Requirements</b> Your lantern light is shining; <b>Effect</b> Your lenses focus your light into a searing beam. You deal 5d4 fire damage to all creatures in a 30-foot line, with a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. Your lantern light then extinguishes, and you can’t use this ability or use your lantern light again for 1d4 rounds. At 11th level and every two levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.</p>
                 <p><b>Evolution</b> Secondary light emitters grow from your shoulder nodes that flash in time with your lantern. You gain the Lantern Strobe action.<br><b>Lantern Strobe</b> [two-actions] (light, magical, visual) <b>Frequency</b> once per hour; <b>Effect</b> As you pulse your lantern, your emitters flash erratically, disorienting your opponents that see it. Each opponent in a 15-foot cone must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher). On a failure, the creature is dazzled for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1 round and dazzled for the following round.</p>
                 <p>“But wait,” you might be asking. “My explosive surki sorceress, Blastrellina, isn’t just a surki; she’s also a nephilim because she fed upon the lingering unholy magic of the Worldwound! How will these ancestries interact with versatile heritages?” We know that versatile heritages are very popular, and so if you want to take one with either an awakened animal or a surki, you can! In this case, you still select a heritage purely to define your character’s story and cosmetic appearance, and you gain some basic benefits but not their specialized heritage abilities. However, you can take either the Late Awakener or Secondary Adaptation feat later to gain these benefits.</p>

                <p>It’s been so fun that I’ve started stashing <em>anything</em> I’ve deemed April Fools–worthy, to the point where if someone else deems it worthy of The List, I’m summoned to add it immediately. Around a month ago, I added to the goblins’ ever-full dance cards by releasing The List into the wilds of the Paizo Chat. So with a year’s worth of out-of-context inspiration, the goblins responded to me with this year’s foolish wonders!</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;">Maryssa Mari<br><em>Web Content Manager</em><br></p>
                <h3>Wordsmith</h3>
                <p>With every strike of a wordsmith’s hammer, a new onomatopoeia is formed. They swiftly grab the word as it flies off the anvil before nailing it to the pages of our favorite comics. <em>POW! WHAM! SPLAT!</em> The hammer crafts each and every sound. The humble wordsmith is often overlooked by their artisan peers, whose pictures are the primary focus of readers. However, many don’t realize that while pictures can be sent to the printing press, sounds are not captured so easily on the page and must be hammered into place by a skilled wordsmith.</p>
                <p>While most wordsmiths are content to forge their words out of sight of the public, they are fierce defenders of their work and are quick to fight anyone who belittles it. They know the pen is mightier than the sword, but the hammer is mightiest of all, and they use it mercilessly to <em>SMASH!</em> through their foes.</p>
                <p>Though many wordsmiths are dwarves, they come from all kinds of backgrounds, each bringing their own unique sounds and noises from their culture. Tengu wordsmiths particularly favor onomatopoeias similar to bird calls like <em>caw</em>for crows or <em>okalee</em> for red-winged blackbirds. Meanwhile, leshy wordsmiths favor sounds inaudible to most non-plant creatures, such as the <em>tr-tr-tr</em> that reflects the sound of a plant growing.</p>

                <blockquote>
                 <p>Armiger Khelum,<br>
                   If this letter comes across my desk one more time, I’ll be reporting you to Lictor Stought. I understand the fear one carries when confronted with the possibility of hags, but I can reassure you that the <em>Bloddey Glass Hag</em> is not one to fear because she <em>does not exist</em>.</p>
                 <p>“You are now cursed!! You must copy this letter and send it on or you will be killed!!! In a fortnight at twilight the Bloddey Glass Hag will crawl out from under your mattress! This isn’t a joke! She will stab your chest and pull out your eyeballs with a fork and if you don’t have eyeballs she will pull out your liver and if you don’t have a liver she will pull off your skin and use it to make a newe dress! And then she’ll take your corpse and she’ll stuff it under your bed or she’ll put you in the closet! What will your Maralictor tell your family??? It won’t be funny then! Send this letter to ten other Hellknights to break the curse! Remember, the Bloddey Glass Hag is watching you sleep!!!”</p>
                 <p>This is ridiculous, armiger.</p>
                 <p>I’ve sent copies of this to my fellow Paralictors, the Master of Blades, the Maralictors, and the Paravicar of our Order, just so they also have copies of this... ghost story of yours. I don’t want to see it again.</p>
                 <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Signed,<br>
                   Paralictor Shudi Osra<br></p>

                 <p>Kreighton,<br>
                   Never let it be said that I’m not grateful for the random bits and bobs that you’re able to submit to the archive that tell us more about pre–Age of Darkness Kyonin. But this one does seem a little... strange. Perhaps you could provide more context?</p>
                 <p style="margin-left: 20px;">— Gorm</p>
                 <p>“I was dining with my youngest child at the Viridian Crystal, and we had the most wonderful little cakes. I asked the chef’s familiar if we might have the recipe and the little jay twittered and said that while he couldn’t give away the lady’s recipe, I would be able to purchase it. Of course, being quite sensible I requested the price and was told ‘two pieces.’ This seemed very reasonable, so I accepted, and I was told it would be added to my bill.</p>
                 <p>The next day, I was going through my letters and found my bill from the Crystal, and I was being charged two platinum, 32 silver. Of course, 20 silver for dinner, 12 silver for the lovely crystal tiara I purchased for my child, but apparently the two platinum were for the recipe for the little cakes! Well, I threatened to take this up with the Edasseril family, only to be told that I could put the recipe wherever I wanted, so here I am. I’m sharing this recipe with everyone I know and hoping that they’ll send it to everyone they know, and I hope that Chef Avie Vandlade enjoys her comeuppance!</p>
                 <p>Viridian Crystal Cakes</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li>1 and a quarter cups flour, weighed</li>
                  <li>Three-fourths cup and two tablespoons fine white sugar</li>
                  <li>Three-fourths teaspoon baking powder</li>
                  <li>One-fourth teaspoon baking soda</li>
                  <li>One-fourth teaspoon salt</li>
                  <li>Six tablespoons unsalted butter, soft</li>
                  <li>Two tablespoons oil (vegetable)</li>
                  <li>One whole egg and one egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
                  <li>One and one-half teaspoons vanilla</li>
                  <li>One-half teaspoon butter flavor</li>
                  <li>One-half cup soured cream, room temperature</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>Activate your fire elemental and put your oven at cake temperature. Well grease a half-foot round pan.</p>
                 <p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt gently in a medium bowl. Add softened butter and oil and mix until it looks like delicate sand.</p>
                 <p>In a small bowl, combine egg, yolk, vanilla, butter flavor, and soured cream. In batches of three, add the wet to the dry and beat until smooth. Scrape the bowl for any pockets of dry goods and make sure everything is fully combined. Once all thirds are in, beat for another half-minute until fully incorporated.</p>
                 <p>Pour into round pan, bake for around 40 minutes, or until a skewer comes clean. Cool in the pan for ten minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Cut into small circles or squares. Top with chocolate frosting.”</p>
                 <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Dearest Gorm,<br>
                   Yes, of course, I realize this letter was slightly obtuse. Cake temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
                   With care,<br>

                <br>
                <p>Omen dragons are tied to the occult tradition, granting them strange powers. In the case of omen dragons, those powers are connected to prophecy and fortune-telling. Although proper prophecy no longer works in the world, short-term fortunes like those explored via <em>augury </em>still function. Beyond that, fortunes become less accurate, but might still have nuggets of truth within them. It’s these short- to medium-length fortunes in which an omen dragon dabbles.</p>
                <p>Every omen dragon is constantly seeing glimpses of possible futures. These dragons’ occult nature compels them to share what they see with the relevant parties, regardless of the people involved or the nature of the future glimpsed. The dragon usually shares this future through their prophetic wings. An omen dragon’s wings have a reflective inner portion that is much like a mirror. The dragon can use their ability to allow another person to glimpse their future, sometimes months into the future, within the wings. Since an omen dragon has no other information beyond what it shares in the glimpse, they leave the task of deciphering the vision and dealing with the future to the people involved.</p>
                <p>Omen dragons have a number of additional abilities tied to the fate and prophecy. Every omen dragon is unbound by the restrictions of fate, making them immune to fortune and misfortune effects except when the omen dragon chooses to be subject to them. They can also twist the immediate future to force misfortune on foes who attempt to attack the dragon. Even the breath weapon of an omen dragon is tied to fate and future. An omen dragon’s breath grants victims a small taste of an omen dragon’s power, inundating the victim with countless visions of possible futures that can overwhelm.</p>
                <p>As they’re always seeing these future glimpses, omen dragons often collect items and treasures related to the future. Omen dragon hoards tend to be smaller than that of a typical dragon, but most omen dragons maintain several hoards at once. Most of these hoards hold items of some future importance, such as a weapon that will strike down a great power or a relic that can save an entire village. People who want or need these items can speak with the dragon in an attempt to claim the items, but doing so can be a difficult feat!</p>
                <p>That’s the omen dragon, and with that we’ve finished our look at all the dragons in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core"><em>Monster Core</em></a>! The book has been out for a few days now and I’m sure some of you reading this already had access to your PDFs or received your physical copies and learned about the omen dragon. In a way, you got to see the future before others, making you not unlike an omen dragon! I want to thank everyone who followed these draconic previews and I hope you’ve had a good time reading them. Also, special thanks to Kent Hamilton for his incredible work and being a great collaborator in helping create these dragons. These dragons wouldn’t be what they are without him!</p>
                <p>As the author for the new dragons, I’ve been excited to talk about them, but I’m more excited to hear how everyone uses them in their games. I look forward to exciting stories in the months and years to come!</p>

                <p>Okay, so first off: there’s mutterings about sending a group of Pathfinders up to Freedom Town. <em>Apparently</em> Old Baphy is sending more undead to harass them, so I’m hoping this means we’ll be seeing more of Mr. I’m So Handsome Uirch!</p>

                <p>Also, I was out and about at the Grand Bazaar, like I usually am on my off hours, poking around who knows what and who knows where and I saw a certain <em>watcher-lord</em> shopping with a fancy lady! Now, we all know there’s been certain glances between this lord and an acting leader, but it seems those may have just been glances, because her arms were <em>very firmly</em> around his (well-built) upper arm.</p>
                <p>Oh, and the biggest news is that Eando Kline was seen storming out of a meeting with all of leadership and the Waterfall! He’s extremely displeased about something, and you know I’m on my way to find out! I tried to peek in and see what was occurring, but Old Muttonchops sent me on my way, <em>as usual</em>.</p>

                <p><em>The warning theory is of particular interest to me because it reflects an ongoing scholarly debate about the ability to prevent a true prophecy. As noted in</em> Beyond Aroden <em>(which I believe I have already mentioned in these pages), there are some who believe in the Fate’s Chain theory, which holds that any action taken to prevent a foretelling only hastens its speed and effects. Conversely, others believe that all prophecy presents the opportunity to exert free will. In the words of one notorious scholar, “those who lie down in front of the hooves of prophecy instead of taking the reins of their lives deserve to be trampled to dust, even if only metaphorically.” Fiery words, and ones I am not sure I believe, but given the gravity of this particular set of prophecies, I do like the idea that this might be an opportunity to shift the course of the future. </em></p>

                <h2>The Death of Desna</h2>
                <p>The thing about journeys, especially the good ones, was how easy it was to lose track of the past. Hard to move forward while looking behind you. Desna had always believed that. Each new night, each new step, had something new to offer up—a bit of knowledge to excite her, a dark horizon to invite her, a way for love to keep her grounded as she wandered from place to place.</p>
                <p>But something else was out there. A threat that she’d forgotten from the void between the stars, seeking only to expand its brutal, ceaseless silence. Not an enemy that could be caught or stopped forever, but something she’d held at bay as it consumed star after star, by making them anew as she had done since the beginning. Back then she’d set the stars like jewels, each a perfect piece of art, and now they were a chorus that only she could truly hear, gentle bells that softly chimed and brought new hope to dreamers.</p>
                <p>Except with so much journeying, she’d let the task slide down her list, forgetting to replace the stars that steadily winked out. She hadn’t heard their quiet ringing slowly growing quieter, as something more than silence brought new fury to its form. And by the time it reached her ear, that music wasn’t quite as rich, and starlight twinkled that much less, and butterflies flapped weakly. Absence had turned to abscess turned to deep vulnerability, and what was of the past became the killer of the present. In one fell swoop of emptiness, no longer held back by her lights, something of the Dark Tapestry she thought she’d left behind took her and Cynosure as one, and with her all the stars that filled the skies above Golarion.</p>
                <p>Desna was loved by many, and all stepped up to play a part and try to build a new world in the space left by her death. Cayden Cailean raised cups “to Desna and to freedom” (though he stayed still for many months, sometimes with Kurgess by his side, drinking to his memories and running up his tab). Shelyn offered welcome to those who sang in Desna’s name, collecting songs and poems so she would not be forgotten. (And when they sounded out of tune, as if something was missing, she called them Desnal melodies and blessed those who repeated them, ignoring art’s new promise for the haunting elegies). Sarenrae sought her vengeance but had no one to strike out against, and so she turned to healing in its place (by never letting hurt inside, and building walls around her heart she dared Shelyn to climb).</p>
                <p>No one could prove the daytime light was any different than before, but even on the fairest day, there was something in the air—a stagnant sort of thickness that weighed upon the spine. Scouts moved slowly, and travelers lingered though they knew to hurry (to get themselves to safety long before the starless night). With no means by which to navigate, sailors called off voyages, reduced to tiny odysseys that kept the shore in sight. And while the feeling dissipated, slowly easing day by day, everything about the world felt dormant for a time.</p>
                <p>Even as the pace picked up, no stars returned to fill the sky. At night, only the moon shone down, and paths forward could change in ways unlucky and impossible; more often did travelers disappear from the shadowed roads ahead. And while some blamed her ancient nemesis, Ghlaunder, who was emboldened by Desna’s demise, or Zon-Kuthon, who reveled in the new depth of the darkness, only Desna would have known that what killed her waited, determining its next advance, growing in the spaces left within a starless night.</p>

                <p><em>The Dark Tapestry? It has been some time since I thought about that void of space, which has long been reported to be the home of godlike beings far beyond my comprehension. Maybe this is why I am the most intrigued about Desna’s seeming knowledge of the place and its dangers. It is the first I am hearing of a potential connection, though that may simply be because I do not attend the right discussion groups. Whether or not this prophecy turns out to be true (or, again, maybe a warning that my Lady might be able to give to Desna to prevent this outcome), I will add a note about the possible link between Desna and the Dark Tapestry to my collected papers covering her works as a deity. I am not sure when or if I will have the time to publish any of the works I have begun to write, or if there will be room in my papers for all of the data I now have, but I am glad that I have at least begun collecting information. If these prophecies make nothing else completely clear, my own takeaway is this: it is important to understand what you know (and don’t) about the gods.</em></p>

                <p>A Starfinder Society Scenario designed for 11th- through 14th-level characters.</p>
                <p>The Azlanti Star Empire is a vast union of diverse species, worlds, and star systems under the tyrannical dominion of humans who left Golarion for the stars long before the Gap. Under the leadership of Star Imperators Iorian and Yridela Ixomander, the Azlanti Star Empire seeks to bring all inhabited worlds under its hegemony, exploiting their knowledge, labor, and resources for the good of the empire. With a navy rivaling that of the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium combined, its ruthless legions of gem-augmented Aeon Guard pose a terrifying threat to the inhabitants of the galaxy. Most systems—including the Pact Worlds—have forbidden their citizens from entering Azlanti space, lest they draw the Imperators' covetous eyes.</p>
                <p>Yet, a foe as powerful as the Azlanti Star Empire can’t be ignored, and numerous factions have dispatched agents into the Star Empire to operate in secret, acting as the eyes and ears of the Pact Worlds—a first line of defense against invasion.</p>
                <p>When an undercover Starfinder broadcasts an emergency call for extraction from New Thespera, at the heart of the Azlanti Star Empire, Venture-Captain Naiaj dispatches a team of highly experienced Starfinders to answer the call. Infiltrate the Azlanti Star Empire, retrieve a Starfinder in peril, and escape with your lives—if you can!</p>

                <p>The Maze of the Open Road has mostly been stabilized, and yet agents are still ending up at the wrong destination. While no one has been hurt, Venture-Captain Sigvard Tornkvist fears that it might be a matter of time until injury or worse results. She tasks the PCs with investigating the cause of these mishaps, and dealing with it, if possible. Little do the PCs know what they’ve gotten themselves into, but there’s a nonzero chance they’ll find themselves in a dance-off before their mission is complete.</p>

                <p>Illegal gas mining operations are nothing new on the enormous Pact Worlds gas giant Liavara, but mining platform pilot Alana Eledin thought she had a foolproof plan to get past the mining syndicates’ and the Confluence Agents’ watchful gaze. She and a crew of desperate fortune seekers would power up a derelict platform they used to work on and take it down into the depths, to the limit of the structure. Of course, no plan is perfect, and reactivating the maneuvering systems on the old rig sent out an alert. Now a Confluence Agent, with Deep Station’s troubles still fresh in mind, has assembled a team of deep pressure specialists and the PCs to, if possible, rescue the derelict and learn what sent it plunging into the clouds. What no one involved has realized is that there’s a greater danger than the immense pressure facing everyone involved.</p>

                <p>The simple mission is: deliver a letter. However, upon entering the magical hedge maze to do so, the Pathfinders find that two of their sticky-fingered friends have arrived at the same time and intend to hide a powerful elemental artifact within the Maze of the Open Road! This completely realigns the keystones of the maze, leading to planar interruptions and wild disruptions to operations. It's up to the Pathfinders to realign the keystones, calm down an angry genie, and help everyone who's been misplaced along the way! (And just maybe get that letter delivered!)</p>

                <h2>What is Infinite?</h2>
                <p>Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite is a program that allows you to create content (adventures and locations; monsters; character classes, archetypes, and backgrounds; fiction; etc.) based on Paizo’s intellectual property (IP), including Pathfinder’s Lost Omens campaign setting, and to make some money while you’re at it. Your work might even be recognized by the community and earn you an invitation into the Infinite Masters elite creator program.</p>
                <p>For more info on Pathfinder Infinite, Starfinder Infinite, and how to get started, <a href="https://help.pathfinderinfinite.com/hc/en-us/categories/12777144310039-Community-Content-Creator-Questions">check out the FAQs</a>!</p>

                <h2>February’s Top Performers</h2>
                <p>Titles are ranked by an average of units sold and revenue earned and presented in alphabetical order. Asterisks indicate titles that have been on a best-seller list previously. Because they’ve consistently topped the list, and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers lists. This will allow newer publishers or book series to get more attention. Thanks, all!</p>

                <p>The All-Seeing Eye is often derisively referred to as the "god of wizards." While that's not entirely wrong, it isn't exactly&nbsp;<em>right</em>, either. <em>Faith's Reward—Nethys</em> examines the influence of Nethys as the god of magic, including new spells, new feats, new items, new archetypes, and a new spell research subsystem to allow you to build or modify spells!</p>

                <p>When Yivali held death in her talons, she feared delivering such terrible warning without also hope.

                <p>This product contains a&nbsp;<strong>handful of player options for each scenario</strong>. While there is a primary focus on the fall out for followers of each god, there are options for many types of players. The&nbsp;<strong>centerpiece is the&nbsp;</strong><em>return to service&nbsp;</em><strong>ritual</strong>&nbsp;and how&nbsp;<strong>each god’s death leads to which potential successor gods</strong>, what that new relationship looks like, and providing which potential benefits.</p>

               <blockquote>
                <p itemprop="description">It’s 30 minutes until midnight and the river’s delta is gleaming with bits of gold dust coming off the tips of the fires scattered about. Dragon-tailed lanterns illuminate the paths as multi-generational families recount raucous stories.</p>
                <p>Overheard, a gravelly voice mixed with sincerity comes from an elderly kobold: “Do you remember that time when...”</p>
                <p>Cut off, an innocent yet bright voice coming from a toddler yells, “We’ve already gone over this, ông nội! I wasn’t even born yet! You and grandma met <em>ages</em> ago...!”</p>
                <p>A family of seven bursts out into loud laughter as they filter into the streets, seamlessly mixing in with the noises of carts carrying crafts and garments, silks and spices; from afar, melodies of wood, wind, and percussion firmly grace the air.</p>
                <p>It’s the second day of the Festival of the Loss: Xa Hoi’s yearly celebration of the lives of the recently deceased, but also the ancestors that have been watching over the collective for centuries.</p>
                <p>Bordering each side of the river, home cooks, restaurant chefs, and food stall owners squat, cooking fragrant foods on portable stoves and fires. Closer to the water are tables draped with lucky red fabric, used year after year, dishes placed carefully. The food is surrounded by burning incense that wafts up to the heavens:</p>
                <p>· Pillowy, perfectly cooked rice next to crisped, barbecued game glazed with a translucent, sweet red sauce that reflects all the lanterns and lights.</p>
                <p>· Bowls of fragrant broth, simmered for a full day prior to pull the flavor from livestock bones and aromatics into the perfect infusion, filled with tender noodles and garnished with fresh herbs.</p>
                <p>· Beautiful golden pancakes still sizzling on the griddle, loaded with glowing leaves and minced meat, folded into half-moon parcels.</p>
                <p>· Rice paper rolls stuffed to the brim with fresh vegetables, herbs, noodles, and steamed prawns caught and delivered just the morning prior, served next to a sweet, crunchy peanut sauce.</p>
                <p>· A three-layered bean and jelly parfait drizzled with a viscous cream, multicolored glutinous rice dumplings in a ginger syrup, and big, round fried pastries covered with seeds, filled with a mixture of locally harvested sweet beans.</p>
                <p>Yet, no one has approached the tablescape. Though outsiders might be curious why this mile-long spread adorning the riverside isn’t being touched, for the people of Xa Hoi, it’s because it’s tradition. You see, the dead always eat first.</p>
                <p>Legends have been told of ancestors who moved to the afterlife and existed miserably because they were forgotten. Instead of joining those who've moved on peacefully to look over their family’s health and luck, these now-lost souls are cursed for eternity. Wondering why their families have forgotten them they manifest as bad luck, nightmares, or even come to our mortal plane themselves, seeking attention and respect.</p>
                <p>This is why the dead always eat first. The meals are put out under the full moon of the Festival of the Loss to invite those who protect Xa Hoi to join in celebration, feast, and remembrance.</p>

                <br>
                <p>As the hour and minute hand of clocks join at midnight, there’s one more moment of silence. A single, unified prayer. One big breath inhaled together with hands pressed close to the hearts—families are sending final well-wishes to their loved ones. Then, as if on cue, the chaotic symphony of music and laughter and joyous conversation rises back to fill the streets along the river as families take turns making their plates and enjoying the delicious, jubilant dinner.</p>
                <p>As some folks go back for seconds, many start making their way toward the center of the city of Ngon Hoa, where the rivers meet. Shining brighter than the lanterns that line the river, a stage next to the water is covered with vibrant tapestries lined with golden trim. Embroidered into the curtains are stitched portraits of dragons and warriors and empresses and flowers, seamlessly flowing into each other like scenes from a play, draping across the fabric.</p>
                <p>Though performers have been rotating throughout the night, in and out of the larger festival grounds, with lighter crowds watching and cheering them on, now, people start to enter en masse, staking their place on the damp, grassy ground with blankets and stools to see the annual water puppetry show, Múa rối nước. On stage, the orchestra sets up gongs, wooden flutes, drums, chimes, and string instruments rarely seen outside of Xa Hoi. At the stage’s edge, closest to the water, lie ornate hand-carved wooden puppets, ranging from humans to dragons, merfolk, and nagaji, mirroring the crowd that has gathered around.</p>
                <p>The spotlights bolt up and down, right to left, finally converging to shine over the river, and the water seems to slow down. The Sorcerer Storytellers rise enchantingly from below the surface and begin the show to roaring applause. They recount stories over the water to tell of this year’s troubles and successes, their magic manipulating not only the puppets from the stage, but shaping the water itself with swipes of their hands like a timeless dance that’s both familiar and not from this world. Their silken garments, meticulously crafted by masterful seamstresses, almost seem to enhance their dragon-blooded magic, each embroidered stitch exuding small glimmers of light as they perform. Dramatic scenes reenact wars with swelling, cacophonous music and powerful imagery, these darker moments interwoven with flashes of occasional victorious triumphs while plumes of water fly high to the sky in unison with the music.</p>
                <p>As the show ends with a magnificent finale, swirls of iridescent water whipping around in a display of elegant magic, the festivities start to wane. At a glance across the river, the ornate and lavish outfits start to dwindle as workers change into their ordinary uniforms. The next day's tasks still must be done. The incense has burned down to the bottom, leaving small piles of gray ash at the base of ceramic bowls. Performers start packing up their instruments and tear down their festival stages. Carts that once held celebratory candies and toys are stowed away for household wares and common fabrics—the tables’ lucky red clothes are folded up and stored for next year’s celebration, too. Farmers head back toward their plots to tend to the crops and livestock. Store owners start opening shops for the last few hours before the sun starts to rise once more in Xa Hoi.</p>
