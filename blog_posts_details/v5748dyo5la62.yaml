  artist: "Planet Stories, City of the Beast couldn't be more perfect for the line.\
    \ First off, you've got Michael Moorcock, arguably one of the most important sword\
    \ and sorcery authors of all time, the man who created the original fantasy anti-hero,\
    \ Elric of Melnibon√©, and popularized such concepts as the \"multiverse.\" Now\
    \ add in the fact that City of the Beast, the first in Moorcock's Kane of Old\
    \ Mars trilogy, sends this aspect of his Eternal Champion to the red planet in\
    \ an epic homage to Edgar Rice Burroughs, and you've got the makings of an epic\
    \ sword and planet romp. In City of the Beast, an accident in a high-security\
    \ government lab sends top physicist and expert fencer Michael Kane hurtling through\
    \ space and time to a Mars of millions of years ago, in an age when the planet\
    \ was still rife with life. There he meets the beautiful princess Shizala, as\
    \ well as the merciless blue giants who besiege her home. Using the sword training\
    \ of his youth and a tactical mind earned in the jungles of Vietnam, Michael Kane\
    \ bolsters the city's defense against the barbarians, earning the respect of the\
    \ locals with his quick wit and wrist. But when Shizala is betrayed by one of\
    \ her own and kidnapped by the giants, Earthman Michael Kane must set out across\
    \ a hostile planet in order to bring her home. With fantastic cover art by Andrew\
    \ Hou and an introduction by Kim Mohan, former editor of Amazing Stories, City\
    \ of the Beast is a work of love by a master of the field. Watch for it here and\
    \ in stores everywhere this September. James Sutter Editor, Planet Stories"
