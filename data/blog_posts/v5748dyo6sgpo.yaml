  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Very early on in developing the Second Edition\
  \ campaign for Pathfinder Society, the team agreed that transferring large portions\
  \ of the First Edition PCs' accomplishments would be disruptive. We wanted to present\
  \ a level playing field for everyone, beginners and veterans alike. Instead, we\
  \ looked for ways to provide fun and meaningful ways to recognize your accomplishments\
  \ from the past 11 years as you're creating characters for the new campaign. We're\
  \ doing so in a big way through backgrounds.</p> \n     <p>If you checked out the\
  \ playtest, you'd see that backgrounds in the new edition are quite familiar. Each\
  \ helps define part of your character's upbringing or past, granting you two ability\
  \ boosts, training in a specific skill, training in a bonus lore skill, and a skill\
  \ feat. With few and minor exceptions, all backgrounds grant exactly these benefits,\
  \ and each PC gains exactly one background, so no one background is necessarily\
  \ stronger than another. Instead, the differences are in the combination of benefits\
  \ and storytelling potential.</p> \n     <p>And what potential we have! In 11 years,\
  \ the Society's accomplished so much, and there's a unique background for each season.\
  \ All of the backgrounds reflect the Society's accomplishments that year, while\
  \ also acknowledging the ways that those accomplishments might have inspired and\
  \ trained new agents. So long as you have earned credit for 5 or more scenarios\
  \ from a particular season (as a player or GM), you're free to use the associated\
  \ background for any of your PCs. And if there's a season for which you haven't\
  \ met that target, don't worry; you're welcome to play some more First Edition scenarios\
  \ at any time to qualify later.</p> \n     <p>Let's look at a few of these to see\
  \ what's in store. Keep in mind that there are broad, basic, and slightly ambiguous\
  \ spoilers for events in Seasons 1, 3, 4, and 9 ahead.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n\
  \      <h3>Shadow War Survivor <span style=\"float:right;\">Background</span></h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Countless factions have fought for influence in Absalom for millennia,\
  \ and for decades these groups worked through the Pathfinder Society to better control\
  \ the City at the Center of the World. Perhaps you were ones of these agents who\
  \ clashed with other operatives during the so-called Shadow War. Or you might have\
  \ been an unintended victim of these clandestine clashes, inspiring you to join\
  \ the Society and stop the conflict from within. Whatever the reason, navigating\
  \ the Shadow War has left you politically savvy and informed.</p> \n      <p>Choose\
  \ two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability\
  \ boost.</p> \n      <p>You're trained in the Society skill and the Absalom Lore\
  \ skill. You gain the Streetwise skill feat.</p> \n      <p><b>Special</b>: You\
  \ can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First\
  \ Edition scenarios from Season 1 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Ruby Phoenix Enthusiast <span style=\"float:right;\">Background</span></h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Named for the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin, the Ruby Phoenix Tournament\
  \ occurs once every 10 years in Goka and attracts extraordinary talent from across\
  \ the world. You might have begun training for the tournament but never participated,\
  \ or perhaps you entered the tournament only to be defeated by (and inspired to\
  \ join) the Pathfinder Society. Either way, your dedicated training prepares you\
  \ for the rigors of the adventuring lifestyle.</p> \n      <p>Choose two ability\
  \ boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Gladiatorial Lore skill.\
  \ You gain the Combat Climber skill feat. In addition, you gain access to one of\
  \ the following uncommon monk weapons: kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, or temple\
  \ sword.</p> \n      <p><b>Special</b>: You can select this background only if you\
  \ have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 3 of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p> \n      <h3>Thassilonian Delver\
  \ <span style=\"float:right;\">Background</span></h3> \n      <p>As archaeologists\
  \ uncovered and explored ever-larger numbers of Thassilonian ruins, you were among\
  \ the eager explorers who sought out the Runelords' ancient secrets. You may have\
  \ been the apprentice to another Pathfinder who perished on an expedition, leaving\
  \ you their discoveries and notes. Or perhaps you explored several of these sites\
  \ yourself, quickly learning to parse the arcane secrets before lest the eldritch\
  \ magic extinguish your life.</p> \n      <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must\
  \ be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Thassilonian History Lore skill.\
  \ You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat. Add Thassilonian to the list of additional\
  \ languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p> \n      <p><b>Special</b>:\
  \ You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First\
  \ Edition scenarios from Season 4 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Faction Opportunist <span style=\"float:right;\">Background</span></h3>\
  \ \n      <p>As the Pathfinder Society's influence has grown, so too did many of\
  \ its factions become wealthier and more powerful. These factions relied on a host\
  \ of Pathfinders and independent operatives alike to establish trade networks, shape\
  \ national politics, and more, and you were among the specialists who helped one\
  \ of these factions realize its goal. These events provided you countless opportunities\
  \ to develop your own contacts and negotiating skills.</p> \n      <p>Choose two\
  \ ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability\
  \ boost.</p> \n      <p>You're trained in the Diplomacy skill, plus either Guild\
  \ Lore, Heraldry Lore, or Mercantile Lore. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Special</b>: You can select this background only if you have earned\
  \ credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 9 of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society organized play campaign.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>So as advertised,\
  \ these are all granting ability boosts, a skill, a Lore, and a skill feat. There\
  \ are also a few flavorful perks that don't noticeably increase the power level\
  \ but do help a PC better reflect the background experiences. In this way, Ruby\
  \ Phoenix Enthusiast gets to walk away with a kama souvenir, the Thassilonian can\
  \ pick Thassilonion as one of their bonus languages, and the Faction Opportunist\
  \ gets to choose one of three Lore skills to better reflect the full range of faction-related\
  \ deeds from Season 9.</p> \n     <p>We hope to see these backgrounds in action,\
  \ continuing the memorable First Edition stories into the exciting future of Second\
  \ Edition gaming!</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play Lead Developer</i></p>\
