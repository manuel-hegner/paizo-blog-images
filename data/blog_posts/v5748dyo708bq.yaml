  \      <h2>Pathfinder Society</h2>\n      <p>As the war against Cheliax kicks up,\
  \ new Pathfinder agents find themselves called to join! As of May 23, 2025, the\
  \ following updates have gone into effect:</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li>The strix\
  \ ancestry (<em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em> 132) is now available to all Pathfinder\
  \ Society characters. Players who have previously purchased a strix ancestry boon\
  \ from the boon store can re-download the file to gain access to a free resurrection\
  \ for their strix character(s).</li>\n       <li>The boon for the automaton ancestry\
  \ (<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> 36) has been reduced in cost from 160 Achievement Points\
  \ to 80 AcP.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Additionally, at or before Gen Con we hope\
  \ to add new boons to the Achievement Points store which will allow wizards to expand\
  \ the spells accessible through their schools. Stay tuned for more information as\
  \ we have it!</p>\n      <h2>Starfinder Society</h2>\n      <p>Starfinder Society\
  \ (second edition) launches at Gen Con 2025! In the next few weeks, we should get\
  \ the Guide to Organized Play out to everyone, along with updates to our landing\
  \ pages and Character Options pages. In the unlikely event that any of this misses\
  \ that date, however, I wanted to compile everything you’ll need to know to get\
  \ started.</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li>All Starfinder Society (second edition) adventures\
  \ are repeatable. Players may play them as many times as they like with a different\
  \ character each time. A character may <strong>never</strong> have more than one\
  \ Chronicle from the same adventure, as this breaks the timestream and the hounds\
  \ of Tindalos start showing up.</li>\n       <li>Starfinder characters may begin\
  \ their adventuring career at 1st, 3rd or 5th level. Regardless of level, a new\
  \ character begins with 0 XP. Characters may be freely rebuilt until they reach\
  \ 12 XP and are played at their next session.</li>\n       <li>Players have access\
  \ to all options in any Starfinder rules source they own, regardless of rarity.\
  \ Exceptions include any Unique items, and any options specifically restricted on\
  \ the Starfinder Society Character Options page.</li>\n       <li>The <em>Starfinder\
  \ Player Core</em> is the only “core source” for the campaign. Players are not required\
  \ to own the <em>Player Core</em> to use the options contained within it. Players\
  \ must own other books, such as the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em>, to make use\
  \ of their options.</li>\n       <li>Starfinder Society character numbers start\
  \ at -2701.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Please read our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6znhl?Welcome-to-Starfinder-Society\"\

  \      <h1>Sanctioning Updates</h1>\n      <p>Since our last blog, the following\
  \ rulebooks and adventures have been sanctioned for Pathfinder Society play &amp;\
  \ use!</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq08pvw\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Treasure Vault (Remastered)</em></a></li>\n       <li><a href=\"\

  \ can find out more on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Character Options page</a>.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Free\
  \ RPG Day</h2>\n      <p>This year’s Free RPG Day adventures have also been sanctioned\
  \ for play! Please note that per our agreement with Free RPG Day, these are not\
  \ permitted for play until <strong>July 22, 2025</strong>; as such, I have disabled\
  \ reporting for these adventures until that date.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Scourge+of+Shearleaf+Sanctioning.pdf\"\

  \ <h2>Campaign Service Coins</h2>\n      <p>In the past few months, several new\
  \ Campaign Coins have been awarded! We award these coins to members of the community\
  \ who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community\
  \ at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone\
  \ in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture\
  \ Officer), send an email to <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>\
  \ with their name and reasons.</p>\n      <p>Congratulations to:</p>\n      <p><strong>Bret\
  \ Indrlee</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #873</p>\n      <p>and\
  \ <strong>Randy Cronin</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #910.</p>\n\
  \      <h2>GM Ranks</h2>\n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a\
  \ 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the\
  \ 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios\
  \ and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p>\n      <p>This month we had three GMs reach their\
  \ fifth rank!</p>\n      <p><strong>5th Star (PFS1)</strong>: Redelia</p>\n    \
  \  <p><strong>5th Nova (SFS1)</strong>: Ed Emmer, Kishmo</p>\n      <p>If you believe\
  \ you’ve completed your 5th rank but haven’t been announced yet, please email me\
  \ at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>\n\
  \      <h1>Conventions</h1>\n      <p>Gen Con is just on the horizon, but it’s also\
  \ time to start planning your fall schedule! Check out the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\"\
  >Conventions calendar</a>for upcoming events in your area and be one of the first\
  \ to experience Starfinder Society for second edition.</p>\n      <p>Until next\
  \ time adventurers - Explore! Report! Cooperate! It’s off to the stars with us!</p>\n\
