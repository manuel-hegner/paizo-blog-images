  description\">The weather’s taken a dramatic turn here in Seattle. Just a week ago\
  \ it was bright sunshine and beautiful skies, but now things are dark, gloomy, dramatic,\
  \ and chilly. It’s the <em>perfect</em> weather to curl up inside with your friends\
  \ and family and play some games! We’ve got some great spooky scenarios for you\
  \ this season, and some wintery adventures coming up to chill your bones. Let’s\
  \ get into it!</p> \n     <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> \n     <p>These adventures\
  \ will be available on October 25, 2023.</p> \n     <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3>\
  \ \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02enx?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-505-The-Island-of-the-Vibrant-Dead\"\

  \ of a subscription</p> \n     <h2>PAX Unplugged</h2> \n     <p>We're just under\
  \ two months until PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia! Today we’re excited to let you\
  \ know that pre-signups for our scenarios will open this coming Tuesday, October\
  \ 9. You can register for the Warhorn and get ready for signups <a href=\"https://warhorn.net/events/pathfinder-starfinder-pax-unplugged-2023\"\
  ><strong>here</strong></a>.</p> \n     <p>Note that we are offering only a limited\
  \ number of early signups for our scenario tables. Per PAX guidelines, demo offerings\
  \ such as Pathfinder Bounties, board game demos, and Starfinder 2 demos are strictly\
  \ on a walk-up basis. We’re also reserving a couple of seats at our scenario tables\
  \ for walk-up players as well.</p> \n     <p>We’ve still got room for a few more\
  \ volunteers as well! If you’re interested in helping us show off our games to the\
  \ PAX Unplugged audience, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sidm\"\
  >get all the info and register to volunteer here</a>.</p> \n     <h3>Organized Play:\
  \ Now Streaming on Foundry VTT</h3> \n     <p>To show off our brand-new Society\
  \ Foundry modules, the marketing team decided to put together a couple of very special\
  \ liveplays for you! The first episodes of both our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-XjuVtHRNE\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDNi7NQNFHI\"\
  >Starfinder Society</a> liveplays have already aired, featuring a colorful cast\
  \ of Paizo staffers capably led through our adventures by GM Jason Keeley! You can\
  \ catch the conclusion to those adventures this Tuesday, October 10, and next Tuesday,\
  \ October 17, on our Twitch or YouTube channel!</p> \n     <p>We hope you enjoy\
  \ them—and hey, if you let my boss know you like them, we might get away with running\
  \ some more…</p> \n     <h2>The Perks of Board Gaming</h2> \n     <p>As Paizo continues\
  \ to release board games, as well as bring new licensed partners and their games\
  \ into the fold, we thought we should look at how to reward players who own or play\
  \ these games! As such, we’ve added a new category to the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay/perks\"\
  >Accessory Perks page</a> for board games!</p> \n     <p>Each current program has\
  \ a listed benefit, and players who own a game and bring proof may select this benefit.\
  \ However, to encourage actually <em>playing</em> the games, any participant in\
  \ a session of a Pathfinder or Starfinder board game gains the benefit for 24 hours\
  \ following the session. Why not get in a quick game of Goblin Firework Fight before\
  \ your next convention slot?</p> \n     <h2>Toys of Boundless Wonder 2023</h2> \n\
  \     <p>For the past two years, the Northern Virginia lodge has organized a Toys\
  \ for Tots event, bringing in the League of Aroden last year. This year’s event\
  \ has just been announced, and they’re hoping to make it bigger and better than\
  \ ever! If your local store or lodge is interested in helping to support a wonderful\
  \ holiday program, and getting a chance to run this year’s Pathfinder Society special,\
  \ read up on the event on the <a href=\"https://leagueofaroden.com/2023/09/17/its-time-to-launch-the-toys-of-boundless-wonder-2023/\"\
  >League of Aroden's blog</a>.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n\
  \     <h3>Order of the Wayfinder</h3> \n     <p>In addition to the Campaign Service\
  \ Coin, we also have one other award: the Order of the Wayfinder. This award is\
  \ given out only once per year, and it recognizes a member of the community who\
  \ has provided exceptional service. Typically, we give this award to individuals\
  \ who have taken on a particular project and knocked it out of the park. Previously,\
  \ this award has been awarded to the head of our Additional Resources review team\
  \ and our Regional Venture-Coordinator for the Online region, among others.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This year’s Wayfinder was awarded at Gen Con Indy, but <em>apparently</em>\
  \ I neglected to announce it widely until today. This year’s recipient was <strong>Heather\
  \ Vigil</strong>. Heather has been the lead on our Gen Con Committee since before\
  \ I was hired, and I’m not exaggerating when I say that I couldn’t run the show\
  \ without her. Her depth of knowledge keeps the show running smoothly every year,\
  \ and her dedication to the program is unmatched. On top of Gen Con, she runs two\
  \ other conventions in Cincinnati each year, and finds time to make beautiful custom\
  \ dice bags for the volunteers. She’s an absolute treasure to this organization\
  \ and I’m so pleased to recognize her with this award, even if she’ll never forgive\
  \ me for it.</p> \n     <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3> \n     <p>This month, one\
  \ new Campaign Service Coin was awarded at a local convention. We award these coins\
  \ to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional\
  \ program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations;\
  \ if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or\
  \ not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com\
  \ with their name and reasons.</p> \n     <p>Congratulations to:<br> <strong>Gary\
  \ Bush</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #884</p> \n     <h2>GM\
  \ Ranks</h2> \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in\
  \ any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone,\
  \ a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10\
  \ special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n     <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their 5th\
  \ rank!<br> <strong>5th Nova (SFS1)</strong>: Noah Posthuma<br> <strong>5th Glyph\
  \ (PFS2)</strong>: Stephan V</p> \n     <br> \n     <p>That's all from me! Until\
  \ next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And play some games!</p> \n     <p style=\"\
