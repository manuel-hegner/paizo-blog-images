  \ at upcoming products, revealing new art and details, and diving deep into the\
  \ day’s focus with a livestreamed Marquee Event panel and Q&amp;A session. Today’\
  s Marquee Event panel focused on Paizo’s exciting Organized Play programs. This\
  \ blog is a recap of some of the reveals covered in that session. Don’t forget to\

  \ \n     <p>Starfinder Society’s Year of Exploration’s Edge kicks off in just three\
  \ weeks at <a href=\"https://www.originsgamefair.com/origins-online\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Origins Online</a> (June 19–21)! The new season takes place in the first\
  \ period of real stability that the Starfinder Society has enjoyed since the campaign\
  \ began. Of course, that doesn’t mean things will be easy for Starfinders. Emphasizing\
  \ shorter bouts of exploration instead of a single, overarching metaplot, the upcoming\
  \ season offers exciting new ventures into unexplored locales in the Pact Worlds,\
  \ Near Space, and even far into the Vast, taking us farther afield and exploring\
  \ more of the setting than we’ve ever seen before!</p> \n     <p>Looking to explore\
  \ the uncharted regions of the Vast with a fancy starship (maybe with some accompanying\
  \ content from the <em>Starfinder Starship Operations Manual</em>)? How about seeing\
  \ those places recently detailed in <em>Starfinder Near Space</em> up close with\
  \ some new characters? Or perhaps you’d fancy a mind-altering visit to the one Pact\
  \ World we’ve not yet seen in a Starfinder adventure? (Hint: it’s Aucturn—the planet\
  \ that might be a Great Old One.)</p> \n     <p>Year of Exploration’s Edge is the\
  \ perfect opportunity to start enjoying Starfinder Society, or even to pick up as\
  \ bonus content for your already ongoing Starfinder campaigns when you need that\
  \ fun “planet of the week” diversion. While we’re not as focused on a major overarching\
  \ metaplot, there are three unique multi-part stories that PCs of all level ranges\
  \ can still enjoy and should scratch that ongoing story arc itch.</p> \n     <p>All\
  \ this content (and more!) is just around the corner, with the Year of Exploration’\
  s Edge releasing two new scenarios every month starting in June. Finally, dedicated\
  \ Starfinder Society fans across the world can look forward to the upcoming multi-table\
  \ interactive, Starfinder Society #3-00: The Last Bite, arriving in the coming months.\
  \ This big-ticket event is set to bring a climactic conclusion to last season’s\
  \ Year of a Thousand Bites storyline and provide an unforgettable experience to\
  \ gaming events across the world! We look forward to sharing all this great content\
  \ with you in the coming months.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\

  \    </div> \n     <p>We’ll be wrapping up the current season, Year of the Open\
  \ Road, with an awesome special in the form of Pathfinder Society Special #2-00:\
  \ The King in Thorns, by authors Kate Baker and Dennis Muldoon. An ancient fey monster,\
  \ a long-sealed demiplane, and a hero from the past will all take the stage as the\
  \ Pathfinders fight their way through a horde of deadly plants and First World assailants\
  \ in the first interactive special of Pathfinder Second Edition!</p> \n     <p>Pathfinder\
  \ Society’s first Second Edition season, the Year of the Open Road, focused on rebuilding\
  \ and rediscovering the Pathfinder Society in the wake of the world-shattering events\
  \ that heralded the end of the first edition storyline. Now, with the Society rebuilt\
  \ and refocused on their principles of exploration and discovery, the Pathfinders\
  \ are set to embark on a new mission: creating a new Pathfinder lodge in Iobaria\
  \ and delving into the ancient secrets that have lain dormant on the Inner Sea’\
  s northeastern border for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.</p> \n     <p>Iobaria\
  \ is home to ancient cyclopean ruins, deadly dragons, and mysterious monstrous denizens\
  \ seldom recorded in the annals of the Inner Sea. As a centuries-old ritual unfolds,\
  \ a looming presence stalks the abandoned cities and forlorn forests of the haunted\
  \ northland, threating to ignite the wilderness into a conflagration of devastation\
  \ and otherworldly evil. Agents of the Pathfinder Society are going to need to come\
  \ prepared, as even the mightiest adventurers will find themselves pushed to the\
  \ brink of certain doom on the desolate frontier.</p> \n     <p>This season we’\
  ll also be rolling out some innovations to scenario format, taking the feedback\
  \ we’ve received over the last year and assembling it into an improved template\
  \ we think is the best yet for our program. We’ll also be swapping out our traditional\
  \ Pathfinder Society Quest short scenario format for a new approach we’re calling\
  \ Pathfinder Bounties. These 1-hour adventures answer the question “What does a\
  \ Pathfinder do when the Society doesn’t have a job for them?” Unlike our quests\
  \ and scenarios, bounties don’t assume that the players are members of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society, and the adventures presented therein might be anything from a dragon\
  \ hunt on the Crown of the World to saving a Druman farmer’s prized alpaca herds\
  \ from predacious chupacabras. Bounties are designed to provide exciting entry points\
  \ for any adventurer looking to start their career, and they’ll all be repeatable,\
  \ making them a perfect option for game store owners and volunteer coordinators\
  \ looking to introduce their community to Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> \n    \

  \ <br> \n     <h3>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society: Year of Reborn Strife</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>PaizoCon Online sees the launch of the first ever interactive developed\
  \ specifically for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, adventure #6-99: Tyrant of\
  \ the Harrow. An ill-fated fortune telling pulls the heroes into the Harrowed Realm,\
  \ a mystical realm populated by a host of storybook characters. They must find a\
  \ way back home before being sacrificed to fuel the plans of an evil mastermind!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society’s new season, Year of Reborn Strife,\
  \ starts in just a few months! The first half of the new season runs from August\
  \ to December, with a new storybook releasing every month. The season’s early action\
  \ takes the PCs to a swarming ancient metropolis filled with mysteries and intrigue.\
  \ Kaer Maga, City of Strangers, is a haven for outcasts, misfits, rebels, and wayfarers\
  \ from across the dangerous land of Varisia. Anyone is welcome on its shrouded streets,\
  \ so long as they don’t ask too many questions or interfere with the freedom of\
  \ their neighbors. </p> \n     <p>But a new threat rises to upset this delicate\
  \ balance. Among the city’s more unusual denizens are zombie servants, kept in check\
  \ by control amulets that prevent them from rampaging through the streets. A group\
  \ of Pathfinder agents is on the scene when these amulets begin to fail, creating\
  \ an undead menace. It falls to these Pathfinders to root out the source of the\
  \ disruption. Along the way, they’ll meet several representatives of Kaer Maga’\
  s iconic and eclectic factions, delve dangerous caverns, and uncover ancient secrets\
  \ at nearly every turn!</p> \n     <p>The Year of Reborn Strife launches at <a href=\"\
