  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi friends! I spent the past five days in Fort\
  \ Wayne, Indiana, attending the Winter Fantasy Convention hosted by Baldman Games.\
  \ What a blast! With a small but dedicated Pathfinder presence, we played lots,\
  \ laughed lots, and rolled quite a few dice. I enjoyed introducing new players to\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>. The offerings included\
  \ all <a href=\"/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/replayableScenarios\">three evergreen\
  \ scenarios</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\">#6-98: \"Serpents Rise\"</a>, <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9cu6\">#6-99: \"True Dragons of Absalom\"</a>, and most of\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/season7\">Season 7's scenarios</a>. The\
  \ <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Adventure Card Guild</a> launched the <em>Season of the Runelords</em>\
  \ with resounding success—one group even came back three days in a row to work their\
  \ way through the first adventure. I took Gronk the Druid through the entire adventure\
  \ as well, avoiding death and leveling him to Tier 2.</p> \n    <p>Next weekend,\
  \ I’m off to Con of the North in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. As Con of the\
  \ North features both the Roleplaying Guild and Adventure Card Guild, I will offer\
  \ Adventure 1 for Adventure Card Game players and preview the soon-to-be-released\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9e8d\"><em>Barbarian Deck</em></a>. Ostog, you’re my only\
  \ hope! The Con also features a full slate of Season 7 offerings, as well as <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9cu7\">#7-00: \"The Sky Key Solution.\"</a></p> \n    <p>And\
  \ on another note, judging for the Miniature Painting Contest closed last Friday,\
  \ and what a fantastic display of Pathfinder Society members' art! I saw so many\
  \ great pieces to choose from. Thank you to everyone who entered and to all those\
  \ Pathfinders who voted for their favorite miniature. In the end though, our voters\
  \ couldn’t make up their minds, resulting in a three-way tie. So instead of a first\
  \ prize and three runners-up, I am adding a bit to the prize pot so each winner\
  \ tied for first receives $25 in paizo.com store credit and the runner-up receives\
  \ $15.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20160114-Dolgar.jpg\"\

  \ are—<em>drumroll please</em>: </p>\n    <ul> \n     <li>\"Dolgar\" by Christine\
  \ Brockley-Blatt, Venture Captain</li> \n     <li>\"Prunette\" by Lady Gragra</li>\
  \ \n     <li>\"Mortimer Raven\" by Quadstriker</li> \n    </ul> And the runner up\
  \ is—<em>more drumrolls please</em>: \n    <ul> \n     <li>\"Goblin Chief Effigy\"\
  \ by Fomsie</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p></p> \n    <p>Our next contest kicks off mid-March!\
  \ There’s just about a month of preparation time in case the category gets your\
  \ creative synapses firing. Really excited since I know our group makes cool stuff!\
  \ The theme of the second competition is: <strong>Best Handmade Adventure Card Guild\
  \ Accessory</strong>. The category includes, but is not limited to: dice rolling\
  \ devices, play mats, dice trays, or character deck bling. Pretty much anything\
  \ that improves the atmosphere of your <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Adventure Card Guild</a>\
  \ playing experience will qualify.</p> \n    <p>The prize? Gift certificates to\
  \ paizo.com! First place will win $25 and three runners up will get $15 each. The\
  \ crunchy bits for entering: </p>\n    <ul> \n     <li>You may only enter once</li>\
  \ \n     <li>All submissions must be by the item’s owner.</li> \n     <li>Entries\
  \ must be submitted to contest@paizo.com</li> \n     <li>Include a photo of your\
  \ accessory. Photos may be resized or cropped to better show off the mini for voting.\
  \ We suggest trying to send the biggest possible resolution to retain details for\
  \ resizing. Any image format is acceptable!</li> \n     <li>Include your paizo.com\
  \ username</li> \n    </ul> <strong>Do not send your entries yet!</strong>. Anything\
  \ received before the official entry opening date in March won’t count—think of\
  \ this as a bit of free divinatory magic on your behalf.\n    <p></p> \n    <p>Off\
  \ now to catch a plane back to Seattle. Take care and remember: </p>\n    <blockquote>\n\
