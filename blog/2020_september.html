		<blockquote>

        <p itemprop="description">First, you realize you are floating.</p>
        
        <p>Have you always been floating? That feels both accurate and also not quite true. The concept of floating is certainly core to your experience, but perhaps not core to who you are.</p>
        
        <p><em>“We are many things.”</em></p>
        
        <p>The thought is not yours, but it comes from within you. You are concerned, certainly. But not fearful. You are neither surprised by this not-yours thought coming from within yourself nor frightened by it. Why does an unknown thought not frighten you?</p>
        
        <p><em>“You are clinging to the I. You know you are just one of many. We are more than the sum of our parts, but we were less without you.”</em></p>
        
        <p>Intellectually, you suspect that you should not be comforted by the fact that more thoughts you do not recognize are coming from within the concept you accept as your ‘self.’ But the ideas have a familiarity. They are not threatening or alien. You have thought them before… or at least felt them being thought.</p>
        
        <p>You are not seeing or hearing. Just feeling. Feeling the gravitational pull of a far-away body that gives you a sense of down, though that is counteracted by something within you. Thus, the floating. You have a sense of your body, but cannot quite envision what form it takes. Do you have eyes, ears? Is your hide soft and thin, or thick and rough?</p>
        
        <p><em>“Our hide is what we need it to be. You understand this.”</em></p>
        
        <p>You realize this is true. Your body is not a static thing, not a rock anchored in the mountain of a single form. Your flesh and mass and the gasses within you are a set of possibilities. Options, guidelines, and possibilities are compressed into every part of you. If you wanted to reach out, your tendrils could reach this far or, if you desired, this much farther…</p>
        
        <p><em>“Recce?”</em></p>
        
        <p>That is <em>also</em> not your thought, but it does <em>not</em> come from within you. The word is more than a word, it is a concept. A name. A name you should know, that should be familiar, but isn’t. Not anymore. How many origins of throughs <em>are</em> there in and near your mind?</p>
        
        <p><em>“Recce is an old concept. You know this. There is no mere Recce anymore,”</em> the within-you thoughts think.</p>
        
        <p><em>“But… they are in there, aren’t they?”</em> The outside-you thought responds.</p>
        
        <p>You feel annoyance. Isn’t this <em>your</em> mind? Why are there so many other thoughts wandering around within it, having a debate without you? And shouldn’t they respect your ownership of this mental space?”</p>
        
        <p><em>“No.”</em></p>
        
        <p><em>“Yes, of course!”</em></p>
        
        <p>That didn’t help.</p>
        
        <p><em>“When we were separate, we did warn you her presence would confuse us. You insisted on having her here. We predicted she would make things more difficult.”</em> The inside-you voices make a good point.</p>
        
        <p><em>“I’m not making things more difficult!”</em> You are unsure if the outside-you voice is correct. <em>“I am… was… Recce’s friend. You told us this would be a complex process. They’ve been away so long, spent so much time with us. Recce wanted me here, so now you should want me here.”</em></p>
        
        <p>You do want Ellethyr here.</p>
        
        <p><em>“Why?”</em></p>
        
        <p>She is your friend.</p>
        
        <p><em>“Still?”</em></p>
        
        <p>You feel doubt, but only briefly. Yes, still. Ellethyr is your friend, so she is the friend of everything that contains you. Everything you will become. Everything you choose to be part of.</p>
        
        <p><em>“We share your mind, but we are not convinced. Why are you so sure she is still our friend, when we are now so different?”</em></p>
        
        <p>You explore the body connected to your mind once more, and sounds join the sensation of floating. A low, steady hum you know to be an air skimmer’s antigravity engine. You don’t worry about how you know that. The quiet sound of your own tendrils—ones you recognize and also many that feel new and different to you—swaying and brushing past one another. Even, steady breathing that doesn’t match the sensation of air being taken into your own body.</p>
        
        <p>You realize it’s Ellethyr’s breathing. She is close enough for you to hear her breath.</p>
        
        <p>You focus on the idea of your breath, and now you add smells to the physical and aural sensations you can perceive. The distinctively clean, slightly disinfected smell of a sealed environmental system’s air. A hint of worn resin and woven biosilk brings the concept of an insectile haan immediately to your mind. The smells of a mid-range air-skimmer, which you know you have smelled hundreds of times before. But also something else, something out of place among the scents of fittings manufactured from haan materials.</p>
        
        <p>It is flowery, herbal, faint but distinct. Not a smell normally to be found among the haan, or in a mid-range air skimmer. You know it is a scent connected to Castrovel. A storm blossom, your mind helpfully offers, which you know is common in the wild but also grows in vast greenhouses in the lashunta city-state of Komena. There it is pressed to create an oil which is often used to maintain equipment and weapons. Used by lashunta soldiers, mechanics, and…</p>
        
        <p>And Ellethyr.</p>
        
        <p>The scent connects to a forgotten place in your brain, the physical chemicals that combine to lock the smell into brain cells and allow you to access a flood of set-aside memories.</p>
        
        <p><em>You are exploring the ship that will be your new home for weeks, perhaps months. You glide into the cargo bay, where a short, stocky lashunta woman is unpacking weapons from a crate. The smell of storm blossom oil fills the air. She turns and looks you dead in your largest eye. Unflinching, she offers a hand in greeting. “I’m Ellethyr, the hired gun of this outfit.” </em></p>
        
        <p><em>Ellethyr stands beside you in a corridor. Laser bolts flash from the corridor’s far end, but she steps in front of you, into the path of the deadly beams. Her armor absorbs much of the energy, but not all of it. You trust Ellethyr will protect you as you hack the escape hatch’s access codes.</em></p>
        
        <p><em>You hover near a table, where several bipeds with bilateral symmetry are sitting, eating, laughing. Ellethyr is one of them. She pours a dark liquid from a bottle into a mug and offers it to you. You extend a tendril out to accept, but it is the gesture that matters, not the drink.</em></p>
        
        <p>You feel the other motes of consciousness sharing your body and your brain follow you to the wave of memories unlocked by the trace scent. They take each memory in turn, savoring them like delicacies, and sorting them among the memories brought by other pieces of what is now the greater <em>you</em>. The integration of these thoughts brings with it integration of identity and purpose.</p>
        
        <p>The air skimmer’s passenger compartment contains just your collective—a mass of tendrils, organs, and biological chemical factories much larger than the one part of you known as Recce used to be—and a slightly-concerned looking lashutna woman in heavy armor that suits her sturdy frame well. The canopy containing the compartment is clear, revealing a vast city of floating rings, intricately linked supports and slowly spinning structures, all floating in a vast sea of pink, purple, and crimson clouds.</p>

        <p>Ellethyr’s expression shifts into her trademark lopsided grin.</p>
        
        <p>“You okay, Recce-and-friends?” You had forgotten the sound of her voice, firm but not hard. Or, at least, you had misplaced the memory of the sound.</p>
        
        <p>Speech feels awkward. You switch back to telepathy.</p>
        
        <p><em>“We are fine, friend Ellethyr. Any time a collective joins with one that has clung to individuality so long there is a process of… adjustment. That will take time, but it is going well.”</em></p>
        
        <p>Her mental communication is as firm as her voice.</p>
        
        <p><em>“And, do you still think this was a good idea? I know you had concerns about some of the things we found in our travels…”</em></p>
        
        <p>Your Collective brings the knowledge of the part of you that was Recce into focus and combines it with the knowledge of the half-dozen other barathus that make up your whole. Ancient runes. A shattered weapon that killed suns. Fold gates torn apart millions of years ago. Each fact itself holds only modest interest, but when combined with the knowledge of all the barathus who had gone out to gather knowledge, all returned and joined into your new form…</p>
        
        <p>A chill runs down the tendrils of your whole collective, and you make a decision that you shall be known as Harbinger.</p>
        
        <p>Your thought to Ellethyr is tinged with worry.</p>
        
        <p><em>“Less a good idea than a necessary one. We hope we can count on you in the days ahead, as Recce did.”</em></p>
        
        <p>“Why,” Ellethyr asks aloud. “What’s coming?”</p>
        
        <p>You form a new mouth to speak a single word.</p>
        
        <p>“Devastation.”</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, Oct 4, 1:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        
        <p>Eando Kline, faction leader of the Vigilant Seal, looks up at the orange-streaked faces of two of his junior Pathfinders. “Explain.”</p>
        
        <p>One gestures to a bucket of clay spheres at her feet. “Well, sir, we found these artifacts in dig site 23B-2, and Jaci here opened one to survey its contents. They’re inkwells! It turns out that some pressure had built up and—”</p>
        
        <P>“In the field.”</p>
        
        <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

		<p>“Without checking it for hazards.”</p>
        
        <p>“Well…”</p>

		<p>“We’re in a Cyclopean ruin, surrounded by explosive trees, a Pathfinder’s just gone missing, and you didn’t think to assess them for risk?!” Eando’s voice raises slightly, before he rubs the scar over his eye and turns back to the Pathfinders with a warmer voice. “I’m just glad that this time, all you got was a face-full of old ink, not mind-controlling spores. Seen it before. Now, get going—leave those here and I’ll see that they get to their proper place.”</p>
        
        <p>There’s a shuffle at the door as the junior Pathfinders scurry out and are replaced by a team of Vigilant Seal agents carrying a small chest. “Correspondence from the <em>Glorious Payoff</em>, sir.” </p>
        
        <p>Eando waits with anticipation to hear word from his colleague as his agents pass several magical and alchemical tools over the crate, each reacting in turn.</p>

		<p>“Curses: negative.”</p>
        
        <p>“Toxins: negative.”</p>
        <p>“Volatiles: negative.”</p>
        <p>“Auras: negative.”</p>
        
        <p>Only once proper procedure has been observed does Eando open the chest, revealing maps, journals, and a sealed letter. Also revealed is the inscription of a mouth on the underside of the chest’s lid, which immediately animates, letting out an extremely loud and extremely off-key rendition of Ulfen drinking song “Set Sail with Me to Valenhall” in Calisro Benarry’s voice. Eando flicks a hidden blade into his wrist and scratches out the inscription before Calisro’s recording can get to the high part. “I thought you said no auras.”</p>
        
        <p>“Apologies, sir, but all Captain Benarry’s correspondence is considered pre-cleared for level-two scanning protocols only.”</p>
        
        <p>“Please move her to level three in the future, her singing warrants at least that level of hazard.” Eando unfurls a map from the chest and strokes his beard. “It sounds like she and Bjersig should be landing in Arcadia shortly. To think, a lodge on the other side of the sea! What I’d give to see this legendary Ulfen settlement on the far shores...” Looking around the Cyclopean ruins as Pathfinders excavate artifacts and mark dig sites, Eando sighs and shakes his head. He’s right where he’s needed—best leave the exploring to the young.<p>
        
        <p>“Start reloading the chest for a return voyage and include a full report on what’s happened here so far. The faction leaders need to know that something’s brewing in Iobaria.” Eando looks at the scratched-out magical inscription on the chest, pauses, and picks up one of the clay inkpots left behind, a rare smile flickering across his face. “Put one of these in for the captain, as well.”</p>

  <p itemprop="description">It sure sounds like the Starfinder Society’s resident intelligence, Guidance, has something going on! Well, that’s probably because it’s preparing for our upcoming September releases. First up, author Rigby Bendele brings us <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zd">Starfinder Society #3-07: Strike at Zone 78</a>, which takes a group of Starfinders back to the copaxis homeworld of Tabrid Minor to investigate an area stricken by strange storms and gravitic anomalies. Meanwhile, we kick-off our high-level series of adventures with Kendra Leigh Speedling’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zf?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-308-Fleeting-Truth-The-Darkside-Depository">Starfinder Society #3-08: Fleeting Truth: The Darkside Depository</a>, which begins an investigation into a thread of the Society’s history and that has wider implications for the entire Starfinder setting!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">It sure sounds like the Starfinder Society’s resident intelligence, Guidance, has something going on! Well, that’s probably because it’s preparing for our upcoming September releases. First up, author Rigby Bendele brings us <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zd">Starfinder Society #3-07: Strike at Zone 78</a>, which takes a group of Starfinders back to the copaxis homeworld of Tabrid Minor to investigate an area stricken by strange storms and gravitic anomalies. Meanwhile, we kick-off our high-level series of adventures with Kendra Leigh Speedling’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zf?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-308-Fleeting-Truth-The-Darkside-Depository">Starfinder Society #3-08: Fleeting Truth: The Darkside Depository</a>, which begins an investigation into a thread of the Society’s history and that has wider implications for the entire Starfinder setting!</p>
            
            <p>On a personal note, I’m excited to be attending <a href="http://www.skalcon.org/" target="_blank">SkålCon</a> in the coming weeks. There, I’ll be running a few sessions of the latest installment of my mysterious “Into the Perplexity” series. As with many conventions out there, SkålCon has made the change to the online space, so I highly encourage people to check out this great charity event!</p>
                     
            <p>Until next time,</p>

		<blockquote>

        <p itemprop="description">At least this time, Newt knew the firestorm he was heading toward.</p>
        
        <p>It was Johenn’s fault. It was always Johenn’s fault. What was worse, Newt owed him a favor. So when the longshank had discovered him in the middle of some research at Forae Logos, the largest library in Absalom, the uncharacteristically erudite monkey goblin found himself recruited.</p>
        
        <p>Within the hour, they returned to the safety of the Grand Lodge and made their way into the lowest level of the gardens. Still a few too many longshanks to make Newt comfortable, but at least there were fewer stares, fewer glares. Here, at least, he knew he belonged, and he had the wayfinder to prove it.</p>
        
        <p>The first to spot Johenn was a young woman in a fancy, blue and white dress, her light brown hair tied in a playful braid at the back of her head. Her eyes brightened as she recognized the young man and perked in excitement. She did a quick double-take upon seeing Newt, but her attention was fast to return to the young man, and her voice rose to greet him.</p>
        
        <p>“<em>Please</em> tell me you found it.”</p>
        
        <p>Johenn flashed her a playful grin as he hopped the last stair, answer in itself. With his usual flair for the dramatic, the dark-haired man reached into his long overcoat and revealed a large, leather-bound book. He pranced over to where the young woman sat, sweeping the journal in an arc to rest before her.</p>
        
        <p>“Tonight’s selection for the lady,” he crooned as she accepted it. “Hadagaskar’s <em>Recollections on the Lost Kingdoms</em>. Might I suggest a pairing of some blackberry wine or perhaps a dessert plate?” Not waiting for an answer, he turned his attention to another nearby companion. This elder human held himself proudly, his copper-and-white beard carefully braided and ringed.</p>
        
        <p>Reaching into another pocket of his longcoat, Johenn withdrew a scroll case, twirling it expertly in one hand before presenting it with a flourish. “And for the distinguished gentleman, a light palate cleanser: <em>From [Horn] to [Chair-with-Raised-Staff]: a Refresher on Pre-Giant Logograms. Volume 3.</em>”</p>
        
        <p>The man nodded, taking the scroll case, gently releasing its protective latch and sliding the contents into his eager, gnarled hand.</p>
        
        <p>“And, my friends, please allow me to introduce to you the sharpest mind I know.” Johenn motioned towards the dark blue monkey-goblin. “My old friend and adventuring companion, Newt.  Newt, might I present to you Lady Zaya—“</p>
        
        <p>“Just Zaya,” she corrected.</p>
        
        <p>“—just Zaya, and her beloved hound, Alouicious.” The gray mutt looked up upon hearing his name, took quick account of the surroundings, and laid his head back down.</p>

		<p>“Ranger,” Newt said with a nod, and was met with a delighted smile.</p>
        
        <p>“Well spotted,” Johenn grinned. “Our dear lady is with the Horizon Hunters, and a forward scout for her team when she is not taking her leisure among us.”</p>
        
        <p>Newt was amused to find Zaya rolling her eyes – something which he himself had done at Johenn’s dramatics many times.</p>
        
        <p>“And our be-robed gentleman is Cromberly,” Johenn continued. The elder’s age-clouded eyes were already darting eagerly over the scroll; he raised a gnarled hand, distractedly waving a greeting.</p>
        
        <p>“Cromberly here has a heart for adventure to put shame to us all,” Johenn smiled. “And an impressive knack for survival, I hear.“</p>
        
        <p>“Fine to meet you both,” Newt acknowledged, “but let’s get right to the import of it. Johenn’s only started telling me about your mystery, and I’m keen to help. Catch me up.”</p>
        
        
        <div class="blurbCenter">

        <p>Zaya considered where to begin. “We discovered Five Eyes by accident; my team was originally sent to the Impossible Lands, off the coast of Jalmeray.”</p>
        
        <p>“Following up on Padiskar?” guessed Newt.</p>
        
        <p>Zaya chuckled. “That’s what Cromberly guessed too. But no, Padiskar’s old news.”</p>
        
        <p>Without looking up, Cromberly entoned, “Padiskar was built around the ruins there, with strict laws and lots of borders to make sure no one intrudes on the creature down there. It was even reviewed by the Vigilant Seal and is considered safe for now.”</p>
        
        <p>Zaya agreed. “Padiskar’s in the north, and we were off Jalmeray’s southern coast. We were there to investigate an environmental phenomenon: the sudden appearance of odd-shaped trees, fully formed and emerging straight from under the water.”</p>
        
        <p>Newt nearly interrupted with a question, but then stopped himself. <em>Impossible Lands</em> indeed.</p>
        
        <p>“Their sudden arrival attracted a number of pilgrims, who claim the appearance of these trees was the dying wish of their old, benevolent god, Five Eyes. The trees themselves seem harmless, and the pilgrims have been peaceful. We’re keeping an eye out. Since I’m here, I’ve been taking the opportunity to look more into Five Eyes.” Zaya lifted the tome Johenn just gave her.</p>
        
        <p>Newt nodded thoughtfully, his golden eyes shifting to Johenn as the dark-haired man continued the story. “I’d really just meant to assist our beautiful ranger in her research” – another eyeroll from Zaya – “but, through fate or folly, my own recent adventures seemed tied to hers.”</p>
        
        <p>He paused for a moment, allowing the silence to stretch. And stretch.</p>
        
        <p>“Johenn,” Newt said distastefully, waving his hand. “Performance later. Details now.”</p>
        
        <p>Johenn grinned sheepishly, caught in his old habit. “Of course, of course. Forgive me. My most recent assignment was in the Menador Mountains, in Old Cheliax. We were sent there to investigate some newly-discovered caves in the area. Imagine my surprise when we discovered our old <em>friend</em> there.”</p>
        
        <p>This time, Newt <em>did</em> understand the meaningful pause. He hissed a quiet name. “Alden.”</p>
        
        <p>Johenn nodded somberly. “Apparently, the Aspis Consortium also heard of this potential find. It got….<em>tricky</em>. It became less of a careful expedition and more of a race to find and catalogue everything we could before Alden and his team got a hold of it or destroyed it.”</p>
        
        <p>Newt grumbled, and Johenn nodded empathetically. “We’d discovered a series of old cave paintings, sculptures, and inscriptions… Newt, it was <em>amazing</em>.”</p>
        
        <p>The goblin asked the more pressing question: “Was anyone hurt?” <em>Again</em>.</p>
        
        <p>Johenn shook his head, and Newt released the breath he didn’t remember holding.</p>
        
        <p>“It was close,” Johenn admitted. “But we got out safely. The fool demolished the cave to get at something beyond the wall. We held the area as long as we could, while I combined all of our bookthief brew. We copied everything we could, but there was so much. It was nearly impossible to figure out which paintings were the most important. With a fight incoming, we had to make a lot of guesses. I’d been taking tracings of some of the inscriptions, but there wasn’t time to complete them.”</p>
        
        <p>“You did well,” the goblin rumbled. “Agents first.”</p>
        
        <p>Johenn nodded, though Newt could tell that the loss of the information hurt the archivist keenly. “We got out with what we could. I made copies of what we were able to save with the brew…seems to be a series of writings on an enormous creature…”</p>
        
        <p>“…with five eyes,” Newt finished the sentence, guessing. Johenn arched his brows in ascent.</p>
        
        <p>“Zaya and I have been pooling our resources since then. Some of my saved pages caught complete phrases, so we’ve been able to translate those. With the rest, well…that’s where Cromberly comes in. He’s got a knack for languages.”</p>
        
        <p>“Got it,” Newt nodded. “So what do you have so far?”</p>
        
        <p>“It’s patchy,” admitted Zaya. “Johenn’s team did a fantastic job saving what they could. But that still leaves us with only snips of information and a lot of guesswork.”</p>
        
        <p>Johenn offered his journal to Newt. The goblin accepted it and sat down a few paces from Zaya. The monkey-goblin grunted as he paged through the scribed, translated pages. “Five Eyes Awakened…mm-hmm…old wrongs set right…unbound, unfettered, unrestricted…the dying wish…”</p>
        
        <p>“There were a lot of those symbols repeated on the lost cave wall,” Johenn offered, reading over the goblin’s shoulder. “Especially mentions of Five Eyes, and a lot of repetition about his dying wish.”</p>
        
        <p>“Hm. What’s this part here, about ‘no dragon remains, only bones’? And here, where it’s paired with the dying wish.” Newt squinted at one of the pages critically, tucking a pinky into the book to save his spot while he looked back a few pages. A grunt of annoyance passed his lips as he found another passage; his tail snaked around to help him hold the extra page.</p>
        
        <p>“Hm. Here.” His tail pointed to one page. “It’s talking about Five Eyes ending the age of dragonkind. And here, again. Is that part of this ‘dying wish?’ Or was that maybe how he himself died…?”</p>
        
        <p>“I’m not sure,” Zaya admitted.</p>
        
        <p>“It all reads like a prophecy,” grunted Newt, the last word dripping, poisonous.</p>
        
        <p>“Well. At least <em>that</em> would be nothing to worry about,” chuckled Johenn with a sardonic smile. “Prophecies are reliably unreliable these days.”</p>
        
        <p>“True,” acknowledged Cromberly, finally looking up from his scrolls. “But it’d be folly to ignore what we found, even if it’s a legend we’re researching. The sudden trees in Jalmeray means <em>something’s</em> happening. Best if we went in prepared.”</p>
        
        <p>Newt nodded and continued paging through Johenn’s sketches. Something nagged at him. “Tell me more about the trees you discovered, Zaya.”</p>
        
        <p>The woman nodded, reaching into her satchel and drawing out her own field notebook. “The trees were petrified. Each had its own root system extending below the water, with tendrils lost in the ocean floor.” She turned a page. “All these trees had a spiraling grain along the wood, but each spiral was grown over itself. It looked like veins, really.”</p>
        
        <p>Zaya turned another page and flipped the book around to show Newt a rough sketch. “None of the trees had any growth or sign of life. Just…a copse of petrified, swirling trees.”</p>
        
        <p>Newt blinked a few times. “I don’t know if you meant to do so, but your sketch certainly makes those trees look like pointed teeth to me.”</p>
        
        <p><em>Root System. Veins. Teeth.</em></p>
        
        <p>And that was what he needed to remember. He snapped his fingers. “Several months ago, I was part of an investigative crew in the thick of the Mwangi Expanse. We were looking into the theft of relics from a local museum. The thieves completely bypassed some of the more obvious and lucrative targets, instead opting to take the petrified remains of an ancient, mostly unknown creature.”</p>
       
        <p>“What did you learn about it?” prompted Cromberly.</p>
        
        <p>“There were more questions than answers. The display was of several petrified teeth the length of a human arm, and a few, sharp-ended scales that belonged to a creature only called <em>Ko’kquali</em>, so named for the formation of its teeth. There wasn’t much more to learn about it – it’s largely a mystery – but professors believed the creature to be the apex predator of its time, feasting on dragons as easily as today’s dragons feast on sheep.”</p>
        
        <p>“Oh, my.” Cromberly had grown pale</p>
        
        <p>“I see your friend speaks the dialect,” the goblin ventured. </p>
        
        <p>Nodding, Cromberly spoke up. “Ko’kquali. Five <em>points</em>. Not eyes.”</p>
        
        <p>“So…” Johenn swallowed. “So hear me out here. It seems like Zaya here discovered a newly-formed place, set for worship by pilgrims for Five Eyes. A place that looks like petrified, stony teeth.”</p>
        
        <p>Zaya nodded.</p>
        
        <p>“Some ancient remnants of an old creature that <em>ate dragons for a teatime snack</em> have been stolen. And that creature was named Five Points.”</p>
        
        <p>Newt nodded.</p>
        
        <p>“…and my team just found a whole bunch of cave paintings – literally writing on the wall! – about Five Eyes, how the age of dragonkind will come to an end, and how there’s some dying wish.”</p>
        
        <p>A long silence hung over the agents. Johenn reached for his journal, and Newt handed it back wordlessly. </p>
        
        <p>Johenn lifted the book and asked one last, quiet question. “What if this isn’t a legend, isn’t a prophecy… What if these are <em>instructions</em>?”</p>
        
        <p>Newt cleared his dry throat. “Then I’d say that we have a long journey ahead of us, Johenn. Let’s get the word out, and then we have a lot of answers to find. And <em>quickly</em>. Before we find out what the Dying Wish can do to Golarion.”</p>

High-level play can be challenging for a GM in any system, and Starfinder is no different, but Starfinder also poses some specific concerns.</p>
        
        <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3a303d6f-1fbf-4818-a7b6-031e47059dcc/092220_StarstoneBlockade.jpg"><img width=85% src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3a303d6f-1fbf-4818-a7b6-031e47059dcc/092220_StarstoneBlockade.jpg" alt="Starfinder Iconcics battles a large green dragon-like creature with wings and a spiked tail"></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>
        
        <h3>Require Abilities, Don't Block Them</h3>
        <p>High level characters have access to story-breaking abilities. They can safely perform reconnaissance with arcane eye or infiltrate a base with perfect shape-changing disguises. They can read the minds of their enemies or cast <em>dominate person</em>. They can banish powerful outsiders to their home planes and even teleport to another planet. And, of course, they can come back from the dead.</p>
        <p>It’s tempting to design adventures that prevent the PCs from using these abilities, inserting <em>walls of force</em> that block teleportation, for example, or zones of antimagic to prevent divination spells. After all, that makes the adventure much easier to write and more like the adventures we usually read and play through—but that’s exactly why we shouldn’t do it. High level play should feel special. Your players have worked their way up through a dozen levels, over months or even years of play, in order to get access to these special abilities—let them use them!</p>
        <p>Instead, write the adventure so that the PCs <em>must</em> use these abilities to succeed. To give just one obvious example, the PCs might need to reach a computer located in a room that is inaccessible to ordinary people. It’s buried 100 feet down in solid rock, with no doors, no windows, no access at all. But a group of PCs with <em>clairvoyance</em> and <em>teleport</em> can get there, and now you have an adventure where only high level characters can succeed, which is exactly what your players want.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h3>Be Ready To Improvise</h3>
        
        <p>As characters progress in level, they gain access to more and more abilities; it soon becomes impossible for the GM to keep track of these abilities or anticipate them. So don’t try! When the PCs are high level, you can create a problem without knowing for certain how the PCs will solve it—just trust that they’ll come up with something and be open-minded when they do. For example, let’s go back to that room surrounded by solid rock. What if the PCs don’t have <em>teleport</em>? Well, they’ve got plenty of other abilities, and the credits to spare. There’s probably a way they can tunnel through the rock, go incorporeal, or otherwise get into this “impossible” room. You don’t have to worry about how they’ll get in; let them figure it out, and then reward them when they do.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h3>Skill DCS</h3>
        <p>As characters advance in Starfinder, their skill bonuses improve, but operatives get better at skills than every other class. Inevitably you’ll reach a point where a skill DC that is challenging for an operative—one in which the player has to roll a 15 or better to succeed—is impossible for everyone else. Even if your player characters include an operative, keep an eye on these skill DCs and set them at a number your player characters can reasonably hit. Be generous with aid another attempts, so that even when the other characters can’t hit the DC themselves, they can at least contribute to the operative’s check. </p>
        
        <p>There’s a lot more that could be said about high level adventures for Starfinder, but the tips here should get you started making and running solid stories for your players, in the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/devastationArk">Devastation Ark Adventure Path</a> and beyond!</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, Sep 27, 4:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>All our podcasts are true actual play, recorded in real-time with no scripted events, no fudging rolls to make the story go where it needs to go. We also often get into in-depth discussions of the nuts and bolts of the rules to help other GMs who might want to run these same adventures and players who wish to learn some of the more nuanced rules. We play “rules as written” while keeping all of our games fun and loose.</p>
        
        <p>Our cast of characters for this adventure will be as follows; you can find more complete bios of <a href="http://rollforcombat.com/the-players/" target="_blank">the players</a> and <a href="http://rollforcombat.com/the-characters/" target="_blank">these characters</a> at our website:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Chris Beemer</b> as Lo Mang, tiefling orc monk</li>
        <li><b>Seth Lipton</b> as Gomez, goblin sorcerer</li>
        <li><b>Jason McDonald</b> as Basil Blackfeather, tengu investigator</li>
        <li><b>John Staats</b> as Cadet Dougie McDougal, human… something (it’s a bit of mystery)</li>
        <li><b>Stephen Glicker</b> as the GM</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Our first episode will debut on Friday, September 18th, with new episodes releasing every Friday. Our primary means of distribution is <a href="http://rollforcombat.com/episodes/" target="_blank">as a podcast</a>, but we also make a copy of the show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU4p5Dgq5G8cA2OMU1SLpXw" target="_blank">available on YouTube</a>. If you like what you are hearing, there’s even an option to get the shows early or listen live by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rollforcombat" target="_blank">subscribing to our Patreon</a>. However you might choose to listen, we hope you’ll drop in and check out the show.</p>
        
        <p>Roll For Combat has a long history of running both standalone adventure as well as the much longer adventure paths. <b>Agents of Edgewatch</b> follows the players as members of the titular town guard of Absalom during a once-a-generation Radiant Festival. The party members join as new cadets on their first day of duty. The adventure will follow them as they go from breaking up tavern brawls and finding lost puppies to unraveling deeper mysteries and thwarting dangers to the entire city of Absalom itself!</p>
        
        <p>At this point, it feels right to briefly acknowledge the real-world challenges of playing an adventure path that revolves around the theme of law enforcement, given the events unfolding across the country. We at Roll For Combat would mostly echo our version of <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh9r?Agents-of-Edgewatch-Update">Erik Mona’s statement on the matter</a> – we understand why such an adventure may be difficult for some listeners, but we felt the overall story the authors created was compelling and would be interesting to play. All we can do from there is to do the best we can at our gaming table to make our version of that story a respectful one while we attempt to entertain, and we welcome your feedback if we fall short of that goal.</p>

		<p itemprop="description"> Let's get this out right away: It's an awesome feeling to complete an Adventure Path.

        <p>Author Thurston Hillman gave us everything we wanted in the final volume: enormous creatures, complex battles (some underwater), deadly magic, a climactic final encounter, and the powerful items we had patiently climbed so many character levels to see. All we had to do was find a way through the gathering army of ulat-kini, locate the secret facility know as the Compass, and stop a veiled master from setting off a doomsday weapon. No prob! </p>

        <p>To help bring the marathon experience to life, we were joined from Seattle by OAD member <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldj9?Meet-the-Intern-Savannah">Savannah Broadway</a> in the live-NPC role of Imiolana, a pure-blooded Azlanti. We also contacted our friends at <a href="https://www.blackbardstudios.com/">Black Bard Studios</a> for their help in creating a 3D setup for the final encounter, along with the custom lusca and seashell buildings you see below. The talents of <A href="https://www.facebook.com/geordiejohnstudios">Geordie John Studios</a> were used to create much of the beautiful colony display, and the artists of <a href="http://bluetablepainting.com/">Blue Table Painting</a> did the fantastic paint work on our character minis. </p>
        
        <p>The end of this Adventure Path also saw two new players achieve 100 hours at our table and become full members of Order of the Amber Die. The first was Julian Dappolone, son of OAD member <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5ljda?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons">Michael Dappolone</a>; the second was Robert Pontious, also of <A href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2019/10/joining-order-of-the-amber-die/">Know Direction</a>, who flew in from Rhode Island. Congrats to Julian and Rob, and welcome to the Order!</p>

        <h3>Highlights From <em>Beyond the Veiled Past</em></h3>
        
         <p>We boarded our <em>apparatus of the crab</em> one final time, cranked up the music (Borgore's <em>Dolphin Attack</em>), and launched an amphibious assault against the massing forces of the veiled master. These fights saw us facing units of the "troop" type from Bestiary 6, a monster mechanic we look forward to seeing again in Pathfinder 2.0!</p>
		<p>Like <em>ioun stones</em>? You'll get plenty of them in this Adventure Path. You'll also get a CR 17 ioun golem, which can steal your stones--absorb their power--and fire them back at you. Just plain awesome!</p>
        
        <p>The Amber Die said farewell to this campaign the best way it knew how: by gracing everyone in the room with a 20-20-20. If you've seen it happen, you'll never forget it.</p>
        
        <p>While defending the colony's new tavern, Valeros squared off against Sharopech, an ulat-kini fighter older than the fall of Azlant itself. In a slugfest that would have made Foreman and Ali jealous, the two threw out more than four hundred damage in three rounds. When it was over, the skum was face down and the beer was safe.</p>
        
        <p>We recovered an <em>unholy</em> sword made of <em>throneglass</em>, a material once part of the Imperial Palace in Azlant. Kyra grasped the blade (known as <em>Empire's Fall</em>), and used her prestige capstone ability to seek Sarenrae's aid in performing a miracle. The weapon was reborn as <em>Dawnflower's Hope</em>, and was with us to the end. </p>

        <h3>The Odyssey</h3>
        <p>Getting to plan, develop, and defend our own colony made this Adventure Path unique. We watched proudly when the first stone structure was erected with the help of our <em>stone shape</em> and </em>ant haul</em> spells. Alongside colony-building, crafting alliances and relationships with many of the communities we encountered turned out to be one of the defining features of this Adventure Path. In fact, by the time we reached the final encounter, our odyssey wasn't even about us so much anymore, it was about the NPCs who stood alongside us for volumes of play and ultimately outnumbered us in the party.</p>
        
        <h3>Character Deaths</h3>
        <p>As the party tried to broker a peace between the colony and nearby locathah, several ugothol assassins were present in disguise. The author's deadly expertise with stat blocks was evident here, leaving us to deal with the bodies of Kyra, Imiolana, and Valeros.</p>
        
        <p>Once inside the secret Azlanti facility, there was the small matter of dealing with some of its still-active defenses, which included intelligent clockwork soldiers; unfortunately, they had already taken out Koloshkora before we understood the threat they posed.</p>

		<h3>Best Quote From Marathon 6</h3>
        <p>(talking down a yarahkut inevitable and two clockwork leviathans)<br />
		<b>Adam (GM)</b>: "Go ahead and bust out the best Diplomacy check of your career."<br />
		<b>Dan (Kyra)</b>: "Ummm...(rolls, silence)...(more silence)...forty-three?"<br />
		<b>Adam</b>: "Dude, that's awesome, why did you mess with us?"<br />
		<B>Dan</b>: "Because I rolled a six."</p>

		<h3>How it Ended</h3>
        
        <p>Thoughts of previous final performances upped our anxiety as we gazed across a stone catwalk toward the doomsday device we had long sought. Opposing us was the veiled master Ochymua, accompanied by two aboleth wizards--yet that's not what made the fight difficult. The entire room was a sphere of water with air in the center, and the water was fair game as passable terrain. Our aquanaut and locathah guide swiftly dove in and were upon the aboleths in short order. The battle turned into high-level Pathfinder's version of synchronized swimming, where your character's speed and method of locomotion determined your role. The encounter was further complicated by the arrival of Jazradan, a fated Azlanti leader in ghost form who wasn't exactly on our side. OAD history was made, with an astonishing fourteen <em>disintegrate</em> spells firing back and forth as we struggled over the doomsday weapon. Things looked pretty bleak for a while with three characters trapped in <em>maze</em> spells, but Paizo developer Eleanor Ferron gets a nod here for designing such a competent companion in Imiolana, whom ended up bringing down both Ochymua and Jazradan before the device went off.</p>
        
        <p>It was the cleanest victory we've had in our years on the Paizo blog, but Kyra said it best regarding everything about The Azlant Odyssey: "We didn't just win. We succeeded." </p>
        
        <p>Lastly, a sincere thank you to Managing Developer Adam Daigle for his support throughout this project. There is a great deal of patience and effort required to present an entire Adventure Path on the Paizo blog, and he's been with us through three of them now</p>

		<p itemprop="description">Several years ago, as part of the program assessment made at the time of the Pathfinder (second edition) Playtest, the team embarked on a huge initiative spanning several years: digitization. This year, with Covid-19 pushing us into our homes and away from our traditional spaces, we are both pleased to have started the process and dismayed that our timelines aren’t aggressive enough. But we’ve gotten through Phase 1 and we thought it would be a good time to talk over some of the items we’ve completed, as well as what Phase 2 looks like. </p>
        
        <p>We are also making a huge plea to our GMs to report games and asking players to encourage their GMs to do so as well. Reported games give us our program data - how many people participated, what types of games did they play (scenarios/quests/bounties/Adventure Paths), where do they play (conventions, home games, FLGS). All of this data is necessary to plan for the program. We can’t argue we need to make more scenarios, for example, without the data that X number of people play scenarios. We’ve incentived the reporting through AcP, but we need the community to help us help them!</p>
                    <br clear="all"/>
        <details>
 		<summary><em>So where are we at with each program and where are we going?</em></summary>
		<p><b>Pathfinder Society (first edition)</b>: Its foundations lay in paper Chronicles, reporting sheets, character sheets, and boons. The emphasis on physical documentation made sense, as smartphones weren’t commonplace and computers expensive (and often not-portable). But as technology progressed, we stayed with paper, as that was what had been done. Twelve years on, we aren’t looking to change how we process Pathfinder Society (first edition) data. There is no benefit in trying to upload thousands of chronicles and boons. But we don’t want to limit those players that want to use digital tools. So we will maintain the hybrid state of the campaign, where you can either use digital or paper options and paper records (or digitized versions) remain the standard.</p>
        
        <p><b>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</b>: As with Pathfinder Society (first edition) we have years of paper records for PACS. While the game is continuing in digital spaces during Covid, it is meant to be played in a physical environment. At this point, we don’t think bringing the records online is a necessity. If players wish to scan their Chronicles and boons to have a digital version, they are welcome to do so, but the program will continue within the hybrid environment. We will publish a Guide 7.0 via pdf that is in line behind the Pathfinder Society guide and should be sorted out in early October. At this time, there are no major program changes, so the guide will be a compilation of blogs.</p>
        
        <p><b>Starfinder Society</b>: This program started under the Pathfinder Society (first edition) format but is now existing alongside Pathfinder Society (second edition) and we want to shift them to be inline under organized play processes. This adjustment will happen by the launch of Year 4 and will do so in several chunks. We just issued Guide version 3.0 as a pdf, but Guide 4.0 is intended to be digital. We are phasing out boons and boon-slotting will end as of Year 4. Chronicle boons are moving online, as are Game Rewards, which take the place of Faction boons or other benefits that unlock once criteria are achieved. We will also be building an Achievement Points - SFS category that functions like the PFS version but draws on points earned for playing or GMing Starfinder games. We are not getting rid of Chronicles, but we will open up other methods of digital tracking. As we now have the bandwidth to correct reporting errors, including fixing factions, restoring deleted characters, adding missing AcP and refunding erroneous boons, we are confident we can keep our digital records clean. </p>
        
        <p><b>Pathfinder Society (second edition)</b>: We’ve already implemented many of the items that Starfinder Society will embrace this year. Now that we have, we can remove some of the paper tracking that exists. The guide is online and had a facelift. Playing and GMing earns AcP-PFS and rewards for purchase appear on the Boons tab of your My Organized Play account. Chronicle Rewards are in and will go live next week. We’re converting the Faction Boons part of the guide to Game Rewards, which will be operational sometime in October. When it is ready to go live, we will let everyone know via blog and also how to convert boons purchased by Fame. We’ve simplified the Chronicle and the new version will appear in October scenarios. We plan to go back and put the simplified version into Year 2 by the end of 2020 as well as update all Year 1, though that is a larger project that will take longer due to resource need. The guide changes include language on how to track character progress. Chronicles will be one way, but a player may choose to track items via spreadsheet or other tool and keep that as their proof of play alongside their character sheet, making Chronicle sheets backups and relevant only to correct errors in the database. We’ve removed personally identifying information from the Chronicles as well (no more player name or GM signature) to help with player security and to make online completion easier.</p>

 		<summary><em>What does this mean for the Pathfinder Society (second edition) Guide?</em></summary>
        <p>It will be available next <b>Wednesday, September 23rd</b>, after we wrap PAX Online/TPKon. This puts the release in the middle of the week instead of on top of major conventions. The guide underwent a major structural facelift in preparation for Year 2. While moving things around, we cut out duplicate text, revised the organization to make it read smoother, moved reference points/examples/longer descriptions to appendices, reformatted references to reflect publishing styles, and hyperlinked all of it. Once we know we don’t need to make further substantial changes, we will also manually compile a set of PDFs to go with it. While we will be able to update the digital guide, due to the amount of work involved, the PDF will not be updated throughout the year.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, we are migrating the Guide from static pages to a Wiki-format to make finding items even easier. If everything goes well, we hope to have this ready for version 3.0 next GenCon. After a small period of testing and configuration, we should then be able to turn on the automated print to PDF feature, allowing the PDF of the Guide to be updated every time there is a significant change.</p>

 		<summary><em>What are the major program changes appearing in the Pathfinder Society (second edition) Guide v2.0?</em></summary>
        <ul>
        <li>Tiers/subtiers are now levels/level ranges</li>
        <li>Faction reputation system like in the Gamemastery Guide</li>
        <li>Removal of boon slotting from the beginning of play. Some boons (advanced, minion, promotional) have limits.</li>
        <li>How to use AcP to purchase Boons.</li>
        <li>Pathfinder training is now simplified and has a chart for benefits.</li>
        <li>Call out to slow track milestone leveling with less zeroes that does not reset.</li>
        <li>Removal of Fame. </li>
        <li>Characters gain Reputation with an individual faction and Total Reputation over all factions. </li>
        <li>GMs have a Challenge Point reference section</li>
        <li>Treasure Bundle Table</li>

        <p><em>Fame is going away. As a GM, should I give out Fame on Pathfinder Society (second edition) Chronicles?</em><br />
        Short answer: <b>No, GMs should not be adding Fame to any Chronicles earned. </b><br />
        <details>
        <summary><em>Longer answer: </em></summary>
        <p>From Year 2 launch forward, Pathfinder Society adventure (or sanctioned adventure) do not award Fame. With AcP as a purchasing currency, we don’t believe the added complexity of tracking Fame necessary. We are working on how to convert already purchased Fame items into the digital environment as well as making sure we have AcP or Faction benefits that cover items that used to be available to purchase with Fame, such as Restorations or Infamy removal. We will have more information on how to convert Fame in an October blog.</p>
        </details></p>
       
       <p>Wow, that was quite a bit of information. As always, we are working towards delivering a quality organized play program and value input from our community. We do ask for any feedback to be constructive and that it be posted in forums or emailed so that we can see and respond</p>
       
       <p>Until next week, when we preview our September Society scenarios (say that five times fast)<br />
- Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

And as promised in that blog, we have a few changes to announce. </p>
        
        <p>First off, James Case is stepping into Mike’s position as the Pathfinder Organized Play Developer. This means that he’ll be the lead on the Pathfinder Society line, shaping the direction of the Pathfinder Society’s overarching plots and schemes going forward. James is always brimming with new ideas, both for entertaining stories and for ways to improve the way we do our jobs. It’s been a pleasure working with James, and I’m looking forward to being part of what he comes up with next!</p>
        
        <p>And of course, with someone leaving, it's time to bring in someone new as well. I’m excited to welcome Jenny Jarzabski to the Organized Play team. You all might already know Jenny for the numerous projects she’s written for Paizo, including many top-notch scenarios for both Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society, or from her active presence in the community as a frequent convention volunteer and 5-star GM. Thanks for joining us, Jenny!</p>
        
         <br clear="all"/>
         
         <p>In all of the shuffle that’s been going on lately, Tonya reminded me that I hadn’t announced my own title change from a few months back. Whoops! I’m now officially the manager of the other organized play developers, and my title changed to Organized Play Managing Developer.</p>

         <center><hr width="50%"></center>
        
		<p>Hi everyone, James here! As Linda said, I’ll be taking over the Pathfinder Society (insert witch cackle here). One of the things I love most about organized play is the feel of the living campaign—how the actions of all of the players can affect the storylines and world—and how our digital-first products free us to quickly move adventures from an idea to everyone’s game tables. I’m excited to step into the role of sending the Society on new adventures to new places, and I look forward to continuing to build out the world of Golarion with all of you!</p>

          	<p>Howdy! I’m Jenny Jarzabski, and I’m happy to announce that I’m joining the Organized Play team! I’ve been a Paizo freelancer for the past six years designing adventures, setting, and rules for Pathfinder and Starfinder. Most recently, I authored The Devastation Ark: Waking the Worldseed and the Starfinder Society Season 3 Interactive Special, The Last Bite.  </p>
            
            <p>Before I was a freelancer, I was a volunteer. I played my first game of PFS in 2012 at the Dallas-Fort Worth (Texas) Pathfinder Lodge. I played every slot I could sign up for and soon stepped up to GM at local cons. PaizoCon 2013 was the real game changer for me, though. I enjoyed it so much that I hopped on a plane and volunteered for 8 GM slots at GenCon a month later. I’ve been a regular attendee of big conventions ever since.</p>
            
            <p>Considering my history with the Org Play program, I’m thrilled to take my place as a Developer working on Starfinder Society alongside my old pal Thursty. I know we’re going to make an excellent team, so you can expect plenty of weird and wonderful space shenanigans coming your way!</p>
            <clear="all"/>
            
            <p>When I’m not playing games, I’m probably outside. I love the great outdoors—cycling, hiking, and rock climbing are some of my favorite activities. I also dabble in cooking, fermentation, and home brewing, and my greatest quarantine accomplishment was the perfection of a two-day sourdough baking ritual. You can follow my real-life adventures on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/jenjski" target="_blank">@jenjski</a>. </p>

       <p>Check back later today to read about our vision for the organized play program as a whole (and an update on the Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society!).</p>

		<blockquote>

        <p itemprop="description">Propped on his black toenails, Fumbus craned to see the bearings on the pretty brass compass. He swiveled an expectant grin back and forth between the wizard and the wayfinder, not sure which face was harder to read. Colder still was the reinforced door before them...though not for long. The fuse on the goblin’s bomb was hissing shorter, apparently outside Ezren’s notice.</p>

		<p>“Through here?” Fumbus hoped.</p>

		<p>Ezren opened his mouth to answer—too late. The fuse’s hissing was sucked into that exciting split-second silence before detonation. Then the bomb and Fumbus’s eyes blossomed red all at once. A concussive ripple showered the companions in sparks and shards. The door had blown ajar, the iron frame bent and peeled widest at the goblin’s height. Ezren would have to squeeze.</p>

		<p>The wizard shook the soot out of his white hair. “I suspect so,” he coughed.</p>

		<p>“Suspect?”</p>

		<p>“The previous inscription led here,” Ezren admitted, ducking sideways through Fumbus’s opening. “But I hoped it wasn’t the last.” He ignited a torch mounted inside the door and looked around. “Oh,” he sighed, letting his staff and compass droop.</p>

		<p>The door had been reinforced for good reason. It guarded a haphazard treasury, its golden texture illuminated in piles spread under the torchlight. <em>Half</em>-hazard, more like—the reflective glow made up only the left side of the chamber. Nesting comfortably in its midst was a chest larger than Fumbus, who thought it odd that so many coins lay outside the container. It was as if it had burst its seams. An impressive find to be sure, but the long-faced longshanks looked hungry for something else.</p>

		<p>“Mushrooms?” Fumbus offered helpfully. He’d collected them for their brewing potential, but they made a swell snack in the meantime.</p>

		<p>Ezren only arched an eyebrow at the blue fungi in the goblin’s outstretched palm.</p>

		<p>“Isn’t brain mold after all,” Fumbus reassured him. “I’m pretty sure.”</p>

		<p>“Never mind,” the wizard said. “It seems we’ve traced the writing to its underwhelming and predictable conclusion.”</p>

		<p>“Drawings,” Fumbus reminded him for the tenth time.</p>

		<p>“Er, yes.” Ezren pointed at the cords of tokens around Fumbus’s neck. “Like those, I suppose?”</p>

		<p>The little alchemist patted the tokens, each scratched with runes to depict his formulas. Their satisfying clicks were music to his ears. Ezren had tried persuading him that symbolic pictures and “writing” were the same thing, but the goblin knew better. “Exactly,” he said, and swallowed more mushrooms.</p>

		<p>He noticed then that he was stuck. Slime stretched between his foot and the flagstones. He wasn’t sure if it was reagent residue from his bomb or drool dripped while he snacked.</p>

		<p>Ezren had begun pacing in the meantime, ignoring all distractions any shorter than the wayfinder open in his hand. He let it lead, thinking out loud, “The inscriptions disappeared with each reading. Ending here? Yet there’s no…affirmation.” He paused, stepping back to take in the whole chamber.</p>

		<p>“Not mine after all,” the goblin muttered to the string of goo hanging from his fingernail.</p>

		<p>“Fumbus, what does the light in this chamber remind you of?”</p>

		<p>“<em>Someone</em>’s spit, though.”</p>

		<p>“Fumbus?”</p>

		<p>“Huh?” Fumbus followed Ezren’s back-and-forth gestures comparing the glowing side of the room to the shadowy side. “Oh. It’s like that face the Master of Spells prays to.”</p>

		<p>“Indeed…” Ezren mused. He resumed his pacing, this time straight toward the shadowed half. “A striking duality. Perhaps a clue that all is not what it seems. Because, point of fact, the coordinates don’t end at that door, but—” His next step triggered a faint, metallic ring that echoed around the empty slot in his wayfinder. He froze as if afraid, thrilled in fact, and spoke an incantation. A familiar blue glow spread in response, illuminating an unseen ledge and the zigzag of stone steps leading up to it. The glow’s source was a new inscription, and even Fumbus marveled at how much larger and longer it was than the previous puzzles.</p>

		<p>“Hmm…” the wizard purred proudly. “I can read the writing on the wall.”</p>

		<p>“Drawings,” Fumbus corrected him.</p>

		<p>Ezren gave no argument, already ascending the first landing on his way to the ledge. Fumbus had been fascinated to watch him decipher the other inscriptions, but the ritual had grown repetitive. He was suddenly less concerned with the meaning behind the magic and more interested in the mucus carpeting the chamber floor. It coated the gold coins like paste. When one yielded to his tugging, he became suspicious whether it really was a coin at all, but rather some kind of shed scale. He prepared to bite it to find out for sure, then stopped with his cheeks spread wide.</p>

		<p>The chest was smiling at him.</p>

		<p>He blinked and looked again. No, it had been his imagination. The golden trim around the lid followed a curved pattern, maybe even meant to resemble a sneering creature, but he was sure it was resemblance only. Pretty sure.</p>

		<p>From the ledge, Ezren gave a triumphant shout. “A conjurer’s imprint! Of course. It’s the same inscription, traveling each time. Relocating...”</p>

		<p>Fumbus now had his nose close to the mucus trail, sniffing and tracking it. Soon he stood knee-deep in sticky coins. The chest was even larger up close; he could almost see his reflection in its viscous sheen.</p>

		<p>He yelped then, high-pitched and giddy, because the chest’s golden lips parted and a pink tongue lashed out. Long and twisted like a wet blanket, it snapped in the goblin’s face and sent him stumbling backward.</p>

		<p>Not his imagination!</p>

        <p>The chest shuffled toward him with eerie silence, as if it would maintain its camouflage. Without taking his eyes from the creature, Fumbus called to his companion. Ezren only hushed him back. This inscription was longer, more complex than the others, and he needed time to unravel it. Fumbus cursed the human’s unassailable focus.</p>

		<p>The creature noticed it, too. It must have decided Ezren himself was extremely assailable as a result, because it changed course, crawling toward the stairs on at least eight tentacles.</p>

		<p>Fumbus admired its cleverness. To disguise itself and then prey on the distracted wizard? Maybe it was more intelligent than he assumed. He knew from experience what a second chance could mean to a misunderstood monster. A possible future flashed before his goggles: shaking tentacles with the creature; taking it in; feeding it pickled whatevers; definitely requiring it to wear a bell; putting its sticky mucus to good alchemical use…</p>

		<p>But now the creature slithered up the stairs, almost close enough to grab Ezren from behind. Fumbus downed an elixir, which tasted like that feeling when your foot falls asleep, and leaped over the creature onto the second landing. It reached for him and he pelted it with bombs almost faster than he could light them. Each stuck first and exploded second, like orange geysers erupting on the creature’s hide. But tongue and tentacles kept whipping.</p>

		<p>“Drawings…” Ezren muttered up on his ledge.</p>

		<p>The creature turned toward the unsuspecting wizard again, craning like an actual chest on stilts.</p>

		<p>In a panic, Fumbus prepared something different, injecting a spongy pellet with a rolling chemical mixture. The sponge instantly swelled four times larger and hardened in reaction, now a brittle shell filled with something hot and hungry. Even so, the goblin risked a delay and even an accidental discharge: He hid the ball behind his back and whistled at the creature, hoping it would take the bait.</p>

		<p>It did. Mouth open wide to expose not treasure or goodies, but rows of jagged teeth, it flicked its tongue and stretched its pseudopods at Fumbus...who moved. Like a toad with a fly, the creature snatched Fumbus’s bomb from midair and stowed it in its chest-mouth. First the split-second silence; then it stretched wide with a muffled pop. Its tentacles shuddered. Its tongue spilled out like steaming entrails, shriveled and white with acidic burns. Its body oozed off the stones and down the stairs.</p>
		<p>Fumbus sucked his teeth mournfully. “Not so smart, I guess.”</p>

		<p>“Oh, that seems a bit harsh,” Ezren said, turning away from the wall at last. “Though I do owe you my thanks.”</p>

		<p>The goblin shrugged and fiddled with his dogslicer, both pleased and embarrassed.</p>

		<p>The wizard’s wrinkled scowl softened into a smile and he pointed. “Drawings.”</p>

		<p>Fumbus clutched his formula tokens. “Huh?”</p>

		<p>“Drawings! You were right after all. The inscription isn’t an affirmation or command, but a combination lock. Read the runes wrong and they relocate, growing longer. But shuffle them correctly and…”</p>

		<p>One by one he touched his staff to the magically bright symbols, but in a seemingly random order. Each glowed brighter as he did, until the entire inscription had been activated. It shifted then, rearranging in the order Ezren designated. The arched pattern swirled and bled together until the runes were gone, merged into a single shape: a yawning portal. A milky film of magic disguised where it led, but Fumbus had a feeling it wasn’t to the other side of the wall.</p>

		<p>That metallic ring echoed off Ezren’s wayfinder again. He studied it, nodded resolutely, and clapped it shut. “Right. On we go! But maybe less noise on the other side, eh, Fumbus? Never know what creatures might be lurking.”</p>

		<p>The goblin opened his mouth to reply...and filled it with blue mushrooms instead.</p>

       <p><b>Heart of Stone</b><br />
       The heroes travel to Absalom Station to warn the Pact Worlds government of a fast-approaching threat from beyond the stars! But before they can fully prepare, the titanic spacecraft arrives and shuts down the fabled Starstone Reactor—Absalom Station’s source of power—plunging the entire station into darkness and chaos. The heroes must find a way to bring the power back online while aiding panicked citizens and dealing with Azlanti spies, angry outsiders, and confused spirits. Can they save the heart of the Pact Worlds and take the fight to the strange alien vessel?</p>

        <p itemprop="description">The <B>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</b> is coming in July 2021! This six-part, monthly Adventure Path takes characters from 1st to 20th level. It’s set in the Magaambya magic academy in the Mwangi Expanse, the oldest and most prestigious magic school in our world. We’ve been looking to tell a “magic school” story for a long time, and we’re thrilled to tell a non-Western magic school story set in the Magaambya. In Strength of Thousands, the characters start as students, become teachers, and ultimately hold the fate of the school in their hands.</p>

       <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/34dd42eb-92c7-42ec-a126-3287ec82bf2c/091020_9-Magaambya.png" target="_blank"><img style="max-width:95%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/34dd42eb-92c7-42ec-a126-3287ec82bf2c/091020_9-Magaambya.png" alt=" "></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Magaambya by Tomasz Chistowski</p></div>
       
       <p>The name of this Adventure Path comes from a school motto; each teacher and student stands on the shoulders of thousands who have come before, so the weight of reputation and responsibility rests squarely on the heroes’ shoulders.</p>
       
       <p>Strength of Thousands is open to characters of all kinds, but it’s a <i>magic</i> school, so some spellcasting ability is necessary. If you like playing fighters or monks or other non-spellcasting classes, don’t worry! We’re layering on additional spellcasting ability to all characters in this Adventure Path, so if you can’t normally cast spells, you get a little bit of spellcasting. If you are a spellcaster already, you get a little more. This makes the characters slightly more powerful than normal, but lets them feel like students in the world’s premiere magic school. </p>
        
         <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6a5f8d61-6cad-4c89-bb84-74c43ca239b6/091020_13-Celebration.png" target="_blank"><img style="max-width:95%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6a5f8d61-6cad-4c89-bb84-74c43ca239b6/091020_13-Celebration.png" alt=" "></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Celebration by Tomasz Chistowski</p></div>
         
         <p>The adventures initially focus on the Magaambya, but soon expand to take place all over the Mwangi Expanse (and even beyond, in an interplanetary excursion!). The teachers at the Magaambya are also diplomats and guardians of the world, and we want the players to really feel that. You’ll undertake diplomatic missions in the dangerous city of Mzali, stage a rescue in the Sodden Lands, and uncover secrets lost for thousands of years.</p>
         
         <p>Strength of Thousands gets tons of support in supplemental articles in each volume, including rosters of fellow students and faculty members and an academia downtime subsystem so characters get more skilled throughout their academic years as students (and as teachers). We expect Strength of Thousands to span many in-game years and thrill real-world players for a long time!</p>

        <p>We’ve established a diverse and talented team of authors for the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path. Rather than talk about them, let’s have them tell you who they are in their own words!</p>
        
        <p><b>Kindled Magic</b>, by Alexandria Bustion and Eleanor Ferron<br />
Allie Bustion is an award-winning freelance narrative designer and writer who has worked on their own indie titles, like HEIST and Misbehavin', as well as Sea of Legends. You can find their name in recent and upcoming books from Paizo and others, including the Mwangi Expanse world guide, the Starship Operations Manual, and Lost Omens: Legends. More often than not, they can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/madpierrot" target="_blank">Twitter (@madpierrot)</a> taking a lot of pictures of their cat or analyzing popular media or on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/MadPierrotTV" target="_blank">Twitch (MadPierrotTV)</a> playing Apex Legends and Final Fantasy XIV. More of their work can be found on <a href="https://madpierrot.design/" target="_blank">madpierrot.design</a>, <a href="https://madpierrot.itch.io/" target="_blank">madpierrot.itch.io</a>, and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/madpierrot" target="_blank">patreon.com/madpierrot</a>.</p>

		<p>Hello! I'm Eleanor Ferron, a mixed-race author, artist, and Developer here at Paizo. Along with my fabulous colleague Luis Loza, I work on the Lost Omens setting guides for Pathfinder 2E. I’ve also illustrated several RPG products, such as the role-playing card game and campaign assistant, Short Order Heroes. Both Luis and I have been working hard on coordinating an incredible crew of authors for the Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse book that will accompany the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path, and so I am incredibly excited to see that setting come to life for players and GMs to explore!M.o</p>

        <p><b>Spoken on the Song Wind</b>, by Quinn Murphy<br />
		My name is Quinn Murphy. I’ve been doing freelance design and publishing my own games for a little over a decade, and have been in love with RPGs for most of my life. Over the years I’ve done design work for Dungeons & Dragons (4th Edition), Marvel Heroic Roleplaying, Misspent Youth, Trinity Continuum: Aeon, and more. I’ve been working with Paizo since last year, starting with the Pathfinder Society Quest Archaeology in Aspenthar and other projects. I am really excited to be working on the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path, where we can introduce players to wonders and teachings of the Magaambya firsthand!</p>
        
        <p><b>Hurricane’s Howl</b>, by Michelle Jones<br />
		I'm Michelle Jones, author of Hurricane's Howl and contributor to World Guide: Mwangi Expanse. I've been a Paizo freelancer for about 4 years now, and I'm so excited to finally write for an adventure path. Since most of my Pathfinder work up until now was on the Player Companion line, I always had to ask myself what new rules players would find exciting. It was always a fun challenge, but working on Hurricane's Howl and the World Guide gave me the opportunity to do what I'm really passionate about. The opportunity to tell a story, introduce new characters, and explore a part of the world that really deserves some love. So read World Guide: Mwangi Expanse and play Hurricane's Howl; I promise you are in for a good time. Find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/AleshaKills" target="_blank">Twitter @AleshaKills</a>.</p>
        
        <p><b>Secrets of the Temple-City</b>, by Luis Loza<br />
		Luis Loza is a developer at Paizo Inc. working on Pathfinder Second Edition. His work includes rules, campaign setting material, and adventure development for Pathfinder. As a writer, he takes inspiration from a variety of places including folklore from his Mexican heritage, books, movies, and video games. He lives in Seattle with his wife and a cat that should really be more cuddly if you ask him. You can learn more about him and his work at <a href="https://www.luisloza.com/" target="_blank">luisloza.com</a>.</p>
        
        <p><b>Doorway to the Red Star</b>, by Michael Sayre<br />
		Hello! My name is Michael Sayre and I’m a designer and former Pathfinder Society developer here at Paizo. I was born and raised in Alaska, where my family is from for as far back as anyone can trace! I’m of primarily Tlingit and Irish descent, and my family are shareholders in the Goldbelt Corporation, a company formed for the Tlingit and Haida people of southeast Alaska following the Alaska Native Claims Act. Pushing the boundaries of the stories we tell beyond Golarion’s Inner Sea has been both a professional goal and a personal passion of mine since I started work at Paizo, and without giving any spoilers as to the particulars of my contribution to this project, that’s definitely something this adventure has allowed me to do!</p>

		<p><b>Shadows of the Ancients</b>, by Saif Ansari<br />
		Saif Ansari thought he had created role-playing games while making up stories with his brother in India. After emigrating to the US, he realized a whole gaming industry existed and has been running games ever since. Saif has published short fiction and short plays, appeared in anthologies, written for games, and was nominated for an ENnie back in 2017. He runs games in New York City and also lives there with his wife and two children.</p>

        <br>

		<p><em>Mwangi Expanse</em> will be exploring various subjects that make the region what it is today. You’ll get to learn about the events that shaped the history of the Expanse, like the rise and fall of the serpentfolk empire and Old-Mage Jatembe’s rediscovery of magic. Learn about the dozens of cultures and people of the Expanse—from Alijae elves to Zenj humans. You’ll also get to understand the role of faith in the Mwangi Expanse and learn about the different gods of the region, which include established deities like Grandmother Spider as well as newer deities like Adanye, the catfolk deity of imagination and protection.</p>
        
           
		<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e5e4c11c-e8ef-4416-821d-0599e42a012f/091420_GrandmotherSpider.jpg"><img width=500 src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e5e4c11c-e8ef-4416-821d-0599e42a012f/091420_GrandmotherSpider.jpg"  style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Grandmother Spider, an elderly Mwangi woman with multiple arms, sits and weaves a scarf"></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Grandmother Spider, Art by Valeria Lutfullina</p></div>
        
        <p>Beyond the peoples and beliefs of the Mwangi Expanse, we’ll get to show you the region itself, traveling along the waterways of the area and trekking into its misty rainforests. The book will also take you to the various important cities of the region, like Nantambu, home of the fabled Magaambya academy, and Mzali, the temple-city home of the evil god-child, Walkena. Finally, we’ll get to experience the dangers of the Mwangi Expanse by showcasing some of the region’s nastier monsters, including old classics like chaura-kas and new threats like corpse-eating karina.</p>
          
		<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6b385a75-f475-4caf-b741-1e5f06c586cb/091420_Anadi.jpg"><img width=350 src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6b385a75-f475-4caf-b741-1e5f06c586cb/091420_Anadi.jpg"  style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="An anadi, a spider-like humanoid, stands in a friendly pose, waving."></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Anadi, Art by Alexander Nanitchkov</p></div>
        
        <p>Of course, the book will also include new rules options to play characters from the Mwangi Expanse. These include cultural items like Song’o fighting sticks or the magic masks that Alijae elves use to chronicle their genealogy. It also includes the player rules for those new deities to worship that I mentioned. Most exciting of all, I feel, are the new ancestries featured in the book. This book features six new ancestries: anadi, conrasu, gnoll, golomas, grippli, and shisks! These six represent a good mix of classic ancestries and new ancestries that we know fans have been wanting to see.</p>
        
        <p>We hope that everyone out there is as excited as we are to check out <em>Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</em>. Look forward to learning all about it next summer!</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, Sep 20, 4:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Greetings, Starfinders! Earlier today, we published the brand-new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9vlp?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide">Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society</a>. While the update for Year 3 includes a number of minor changes, typo fixes and so forth, I’m here today to highlight some of the more important changes.</p>
        
        <p><em>Disclaimer: I’m writing this blog post based on a working version of the SFS Year 3 Guide. I am also human and make mistakes. If there is a difference between text as printed here and as printed in the Guide, the Guide is correct.</em></p>
        
        <h3>Legal Table Size</h3>
        <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shci?Organized-Play-Table-Adjustments">As we announced recently</a>, we’ve adjusted the legal table size at Starfinder Society tables. Tables with only two players may add two pregenerated characters of an appropriate level in order to fire, and higher-level tables where pregens don’t exist may play in “hard mode” with three players as long as all players consent. The Guide also reflects the recent change in emphasis on seven-player tables, from a scheduled option to only when absolutely necessary with organizer consent.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h3>It Comes With Lore</h3>
        <p>Each faction’s goals have been updated to reflect how they dealt with the events of Year 2: Year of a Thousand Bites, as well as their goals moving into Year 3. Careful readers may notice some hints to upcoming story arcs! Appendix 3 also contains updated summaries of the storylines featured in Years 1 and 2 of the Starfinder Society campaign.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h3>New Character Options</h3>
        <p>I know this is the part that everyone wants most, so let’s get into it.</p>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        
        	<li><h4>New Races</h4>
            	As a result of players’ actions in the previous two years of Starfinder Society play, legacy races and the izalguun became always available for all players. As we teased in our panels at PaizoCon Online so long ago, they are now official. We’ve also added a few others. The following races are now always available for any player, provided they own the accompanying sourcebook:<br />
				<em>Alien Archive 1</em>: draelik, formian, ikeshti, kalo, maraquoi, nuar, rhyphorian, verthani, witchwyrd</li>
            <br>    
            <li><h4>New Languages</h4>
            	The following languages are now available for any character to take anytime they would learn a new language:<br />
				<em>Alien Archive 2</em>: Bolidan, Daimalkan, Embri, Ghoran, Orrian, Osharu, Pahtra, Quorlu, and Vlakan (Spoken, Signed and Tactile)<br />
                <em>Alien Archive 3</em>: Accaran, Akan, Brenneri, Dirindi, Dromadan, Espraksi, Hortaa, Iji, Izalguun, Koshorian, Lumos, Morlamaw, Perani, Raxi, Sazaron, Shimreen, Spathinaem and Telian</li>
           <br>
           
		<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/44e9c4bb-8ab5-45ce-9234-6d5ebdaa177d/091020_Ehu.png"><img width=250 src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/44e9c4bb-8ab5-45ce-9234-6d5ebdaa177d/091020_Ehu.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Ehu Hadif"></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
        
            <li><h4>New Faction</h4>
            	In the events of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021b9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-207-Four-for-the-First"><em>SFS 2-07: Four for the First</em></a>, Starfinders met four candidates for the First Seeker position, as nominated First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo had announced her retirement. Players were able to vote for their favorite candidate, and in a narrow election, Ehu Hadif Ko’ra Amares of Clan Tolar, House Zye, tenth devotee from the line of Ahmu, was elected. His faction, Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif), is now available for selection and boons are available for those who choose to champion his agenda of exploration. </li>
           <br>
		<br clear="all"/>
        
        <li><h4>Capstone Boon</h4>
           In addition to the capstone boon for the new faction, another capstone boon has been added that experienced Starfinders of all factions should find interesting.<br />
           <b>Starfinder of Note</b> (Slotless Boon)<br />
          	Your exploits inspire others to follow you.<br />
			<b>Prerequisites</b>: Any Faction Tier 4<br />
			<b>Cost</b>: 4 Fame<br />
			You are in contention for a leadership role in the Starfinder Society. Once you purchase this capstone boon, you are encouraged to send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with a subject line of “Starfinder of Note.” Include your character’s race, class, name, character number, and a description of 75 words or less in the body of the e-mail. That character is entered into a drawing to become a future in-world venture captain, member of the Forum, or even the First Seeker.
           </li>
           </ul>
           
           <h3>Boon</h3>
           
           <p>We included new boons in the guide, but we’ve mentioned phasing out boons. So how does this work? Well, we are starting the transition to the online Achievement Point system for boons, but that will take some time and won’t be implemented until Year 4 launches. While we haven’t made a decision on how to make the transfer of boons purchased with Fame, that is on the team’s list as part of our Year 4 planning, along with how to streamline some of the organized play specific portions of the program. The learning curve for a new player is steep and we are looking at ways to make it easier for first-time Starfinders to get involved in our program!</p>

			<p>That about covers the major changes! We hope you all enjoy the new options opened up with this update. We’re taking a short break from these conversations before getting back into updating the Guide for Year 4. Our hope is that by starting the process earlier, we won’t have the delays we faced this year.</p>

       		<p>Until next time: Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

		<p itemprop="description">Before you sit down to play a tabletop RPG like Pathfinder or Starfinder, you need a character. I mean, sure, you could play one of our nifty pregenerated characters for a while. But sooner or later, you’re gonna want to let your own imagination roam, making characters that help you tell the stories you want to be part of. But where to start? Here are four sources of inspiration that work well for me and other people I’ve played with.</p>
            <ol>
		<li><b>Inspiration from Media</b>: Who are your favorite characters in books, movies, TV shows, video games, comics, etc. and why do you like them so much? Is it their attitude? Their personality? Their style and flair? Their aesthetic? The way they approach challenges? Thinking about why you like certain characters is a useful springboard to come up with characters that capture the fun of an idea without directly copying them. The characters you use as sources could come from modern works or from traditional legends. <br />
		You might want to play a character based off a general archetype that appears in many stories, like an absentminded detective, a wise sage, or a master archer. Inspiration can also arise from arts of all sorts that aren’t tied directly to a specific narrative, such as drawings, paintings, clothing, and music.</li>
                <br>
			<li><b>Inspiration from Lore</b>: More specifically, the setting lore information in Pathfinder and Starfinder books is designed to help you and your GM build fully realized characters that have a place in the game world. Knowing information about the setting helps inspire answers to key questions about your character’s history and motivations. Where did your character grow up? What is their personal philosophy, and how does that compare to the philosophies of others around them? What are their formative experiences? Which organizations they are affiliated with? What are their goals, and how do they plan to achieve them?</li>
                <br>
			<li><b>Inspiration from Mechanics</b>: This could be as straightforward as wanting to play a character that fills a particular role in the party. Perhaps you want to play a strong character that deals a lot of damage, or a character who is a master of noticing dangers of all kinds. Maybe you want to try out a new character class you haven’t played yet. Or maybe you’ve found a combination of rules that lets you express a new idea. Pathfinder and Starfinder are chock-full of mechanics that interact in all sorts of interesting ways. There are so many ways to mix and match the rules, so look for mechanics that fit your play style.</li>
                <br>
			<li><b>Inspiration from Players</b>: I’ve found that the best ideas are ones that draw on the creativity of more than one person. Consider making characters that have connections to other player’s PCs and collaborating on backstory elements. You can also use what you see other players doing to help fill in the blanks of your character’s story. </li>
		</ol>
            
             <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/cf448523-b607-4753-b0e8-cc29ce6350e2/091020_Leshy.png"><img width=350 src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/cf448523-b607-4753-b0e8-cc29ce6350e2/091020_Leshy.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="A small leaf leshy with birch tree-like skin"></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
             
        <p>Once you have identified points of inspiration, you can start chaining them together. Here are a couple examples of my character creation process. The first is my first PFS character, Trade Princess Natani Copperlock.</p>
             
		<p>"Well, I haven't really played this Pathfinder system yet, but rogues don't have spells, so they're probably easier to throw together quickly before the next convention slot. A treasure-loving halfling's a pretty classic archetype for a rogue, so let's go with that. Always looking to prove herself...where in this new setting book do they like money...how about Druma? If she was poor during her childhood in Druma, that would have a particular impact on her worldview. And the Qadira faction likes money too, so maybe she wants to establish herself through trade and diplomacy, but isn't above ‘liberating’ goods from their former owners to help gain an advantage." </p>
        
		<p>My most recent one that is more than an amorphous blob of GM credit, Kragrak, with leshy companion Oak Sprout followed the same process.</p>
            
		<p>"Leshys are awesome, and I want one to basically be my character in social situations. How about a taciturn leshy warden druid with a gregarious leshy companion? And to give the
warden some plant theming despite not being a plant, well, plants grow into ground, so how about an oread with little cacti sprouting out of his shoulders? He uses them to fasten his cloak.
And with cactus-shoulders, he probably grew up in a location with deserts...what if he was raised among the Pahmet dwarves of Osirion? Middle-aged oreads often feel an irresistible pull to travel, which would be a great reason to leave his comfort zone as a member of a relatively insular culture and seek membership in an organization like the Pathfinder Society." </p>

<br clear="all"/>

		<p>I’ve shared a couple of my character seeds. What are your favorite sources of inspiration for character building? Do you have tons of character ideas you’d love to play, but there’s never enough time to play them all? Please share your thoughts and ideas in the comments below.</p>

		<blockquote>

        <p itemprop="description">“We can do it.” </p>
        
        <p> The words reverberated through the cramped but well-furnished captain’s cabin of the <em>Glorious Payoff</em>. Eando Kline, leader of the Pathfinder Society’s Vigilant Seal, spoke excitedly and with conviction. “With the Seal deployed to prevent any fey forces from moving up from the south, the rest of the factions should be able to overwhelm the forces nearest to the portal. We can open the door, claim or seal whatever’s inside, and then beat an orderly retreat while they’re still reeling from the first assault!”</p>
        
        <p>As the famed Pathfinder slapped a hand down on the table to emphasize his point, Fola Barun—a tall Ekujae elf skimming through the pile of scrolls at the far end of the table—raised a doubtful eyebrow and cleared her throat, the quiet noise and simple gesture readily commanding the attention of her peers. </p>
        
        <p>“And what if it doesn’t go as smoothly as you say? Shall we trust that fate and fey magic shall both play out as we expect and gamble with the lives of those who have put their faith in us? I am not interested in a plan that involves the loss of scores of Pathfinder lives as one of its potential outcomes.” </p>
        
        <p>Fola’s eyes drifted back to the scrolls in front of her, though the other Pathfinder strategists knew she was still acutely aware of the ongoing conversation.</p>
        
        <p>“That’s where we come in," interjected the tightly-muscled half-orc woman perched on the table’s edge, former pirate and current leader of the Horizon Hunters, Calisro Benarry. “I’ve got a few of my hunters scouting the eastern ridgeline here, where the trees thin out; they’ll signal us if it looks like anything is about to go awry.” </p>
        
        <p>As she leaned over the table, her keen eyes darted across the map, double-checking the markers and flags that indicated the positions of the various Pathfinder forces, as well as the locations of the myriad pockets of fey monsters infesting the area. She raised her glance to the last of her companions. “Anything to add, Gorm?”</p>
        
        <p>“Oh, I suspect that we’ve got it well in hand.” The metal clasps in the dwarf’s braids jingled as he tilted his head, quietly assessing the map. “I’ve got the best bards, wizards, and clerics the Grand Archive has in its ranks spread throughout our deployed teams. If things get ugly, they’ll make sure to provide the magical support we need for a clean escape, and they’ve gone over every record we have of the area. Hopefully that will keep surprises to a minimum, and if we don’t see something coming, they’ll have the best chance we can hope for to make the right decisions and adapt.”</p>
        
        <p>Eando looked around the room again, meeting the eyes of each of his fellow Pathfinders in turn. “We’re agreed then? It’s time to march?” </p>
        
        <p>One by one, the others nodded their heads. Without further discussion, each left to take command of the Society agents assigned to their teams. </p>

		<p>Eando emerged from the cabin first, leaping onto the back of a waiting hippogriff that would ferry him to shore before it and its rider resumed their aerial scouting duties. Gorm muttered a few quick words and flicked his fingers in a rhythmic motion, his body slowly fading away in a cloud of glimmering lights. Fola left captain’s quarters turned perpendicular to the ship’s rail, striding toward the edge as though she were unaware the deck ended only feet in front of her. Casually, she stepped over the ship’s railing as a calm ocean wave crested to meet her foot, bearing her weight as sturdily as the deck had, and whisked her away to the nearby shoreline. </p>
        
        <p>Calisro knew her place was aboard her ship, and she had no intention of abandoning her as the others had.  Donning her tricorn hat, she left the briefing room, quietly shutting and locking the door behind her before she climbed to the deck to stand beside the helmsman.</p>
        
        <p>“Hard to starboard!” Calisro cried, her powerful voice cutting over the ocean waves and silencing the chatter of her crew. “Ready the catapults! We’re going to start this thing off by doing what we do best! And what is that?”</p>
        
        <P>With her final question, the sailors scurrying about the deck paused just long enough to yell, “blow something up,” before resuming their tasks. As the ship came about, its port armaments lined up to the shore, Calisro raised a small whistle to her lips and blew. Though no audible sound emerged, Calisro knew that her compatriots on land would receive the signal. </p>
        
        <p>She needed wait only a moment before her expectation was proven accurate. On the nearby shore, a team of Pathfinders burst from behind a veil of magical invisibility, hurling jars of alchemical fire at what looked like a clump of old and gnarled baobab trees. A mere second later, the trees burst to terrifying life, uprooting themselves and charging toward the attacking Pathfinders. </p>
        
        <p> “FIRE!” At Calisro’s scream, her bombardiers unleashed their deadly barrage, sending whistling orbs of magically augmented metal arcing first through the ocean breeze, and then the wooden bodies of the singed arboreal guardians. The captain took in the destruction, and the efficiency with which the Glorious Payoff’s crew had brought it upon the Society’s enemies. A slow smirk curled the her lips as she turned to issue more orders. “So far, so good!”</p>
        <center><hr width="50%"></center>
        <br>
        <p>Deep in the coastal jungle, Eando fought a desperate battle against a pair of redcaps. The twisted little fey looked like caricatures of muscular gnomes, each wielding a scythe with a three-and-a-half-foot long blade. As the first swing came at his left flank, Eando quickly tossed his sword from his right hand to his left to deflect the blow high. </p>

        <p>The second redcap stepped in and swung low from the right, hoping to separate the Pathfinder from his legs while he was distracted. No novice to battle, Eando used the momentum from his initial block to his advantage, letting the force of the first redcap’s blow carry him into a twisting somersault over the second attacker’s whistling blade. Turning his body nearly parallel to the ground, Eando flipped his sword back to his right hand, catching the hilt midway through a forward thrust. The blade parted the second redcap’s filthy beard and emerged an instant later from the back of its neck, silencing the murderous fey’s cackle with a staccato gurgle. </p>

        <p>Completing his somersault and landing in a three-point stance, Eando kept his left hand on the ground for balance as his right swept back around in a second attack. Even as the remaining redcap raised its scythe to block, Eando switched sword hands once more, springing forward from his crouched position as he caught the blade in a left-handed grip.</p>

        <p>The redcap’s eyes, still looking where the blade had been just a second before, widened in surprise before turning down to see Eando already withdrawing the length of the blade from the fey’s chest. </p>

        <p>Without a hint of hesitation or fatigue, Eando flicked the blood clear of his blade and dashed further into the woods, yelling to draw an angry dryad’s attention away from a beleaguered group of Pathfinders wrapped in clinging vines.</p>
        <center><hr width="50%"></center>
        <br>
        <p>Mere yards from the site of Eando’s incredible feat of swordsmanship and agility, Gorm stood ready under the shroud of invisibility. He chuckled in quiet amazement, dropping his hands and dismissing the magical energy he had been holding to blast a redcap with darts of magical force had Kline needed aid. The dwarf moved deeper into the jungle, following the sounds of battle. </p>
        
        <p>It didn’t take long for Gorm to find Fola Barun, the shaman’s hands raised in the air, magically commanding the jungle’s fauna. A bramble of thorny vines whipped through ranks of surprisingly fearsome pixies while ancient ferns raised their wide fronds to deflect bursts of magical water launched by naiads away from the Pathfinder forces. </p>
        
        <p>Gorm quickly unslung his harp and began playing a tune he’d written himself some years back, a lullaby he thought to call <em>Sleep of the Petal Maidens</em>. Hearing the ensorcelled notes through the din of combat, the pixies and naiads began to nod and blink drowsily; the distraction wasn’t enough to lull the fey to sleep, but it did slow them just long enough for Fola to shred the nearest of them with her magically controlled vines and send the others scurrying into the forest.</p>
        
        <p>“Well done!” Gorm cried, dismissing his invisibility and stepping up beside Fola. A moment later, Eando emerged from the nearby trees, smiling roguishly and brushing what looked like sawdust off his sleeve. Other parties of Pathfinders joined them, and soon the small expeditionary army was almost completely assembled.</p>
        
        <p>“Now the hard part,” Eando said gazing into the jungle depths ahead. “A long march through trackless jungle toward an enemy who knows we’re coming, armies of fey hidden in every valley and copse of trees between us and our destination, and then we just need to open a magical door no one’s ever opened and hope whatever’s inside doesn’t kill us all.”</p>
        
        <p>“You’re absolutely right,” Gorm replied. “I <em>do</em> so love being a Pathfinder!”</p>

            <ul>
            <li>The <b>magus</b> combines spells with attacks. The classic concept of the warrior-mage hybrid lives here. The test will show whether this class outshines martial characters or spellcasters, or whether it balances its two sides in a satisfying way that feels special. The magus gets fewer spell slots, though the slots’ spell levels get as high as a wizard’s!</li>
            <li>The <b>summoner</b> is for the player who wants to adventure alongside a cool sidekick! A powerful entity called an eidolon holds a supernatural connection with the summoner, sharing health and working in tandem. This class also casts spells but has fewer per day than other spellcasting classes.</li>

            <center><h3><a href="https://paizo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/SecretsofMagic_Playtest.pdf">Download the Playtest!</a></h3></center>
            
            <h2>How to Playtest</h2>
            
            <p>The playtest will run until October 16, 2020. We’re looking for your feedback, comments, and criticisms regarding these classes, but we’re focusing our attention on feedback from play. Make new characters, use them as PCs or adversaries, and run a few game sessions or encounters incorporating them!</p>
            
            <p>Anything can change based on the results of the playtest! These are early iterations of the new classes; some abilities might be a bit extreme or stretch some assumptions of the game, and the best way to find out if we’ve gone too far (or in the wrong direction) is for us to deliver these classes into your hands. We don’t expect to release any changes to these classes during the playtest itself, only in the final version of the book.</p>
            
            <p>Once you’ve had a chance to try these classes, you can submit your feedback in the following ways.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><b>Surveys</b>: Head to <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SoMClassSurvey "target="_blank">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SoMClassSurvey</a> and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SoMOpenResponse " target="_blank">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SoMOpenResponse</a> to take surveys that will allow us to gather your responses. These surveys will be available starting Tuesday, September 8, 2020, and they will remain open until the end of the playtest.</li>
            <li><b>Forums</b>: On paizo.com, you'll find a <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/pathfinder/second/secretsofMagicPlaytest"><em>Secrets of Magic</em> playtest subforum</a> with threads for discussion and announcements, plus threads for each of the two new classes. When you post to the forums, look for existing threads on your topic before starting a new one. Remember that every poster is trying to make the game better for everyone, so please be polite and respectful.</li>
        
            <p>We’d like to thank you for participating in the Secrets of Magic playtest. We’re looking forward to seeing what you think and using your feedback to make these classes the best they can be!</p>

            <p>If you haven’t yet, test out a nanocyte or mech build in a home game (or a nanocyte in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shbj?Tech-Revolution-Playtest-Organized-Play">Starfinder Organized Play</a>), and then share your thoughts via our surveys or playtest forums. Links to both of those options, plus more information about the Tech Revolution playtest, are <a href="http://www.starfinderplaytest.com/">available here</a>! Remember that you can always come back and update your survey responses later if you get more information or your feedback changes!</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, we're already poring over the feedback you've sent us so far and discussing the ways we might improve both the nanocyte and mechs—thank you! Based on what you've told us, especially via the surveys and playtest forums, there are a few design aspects we already know we'll address (though these are far from the only community-driven changes we're making!).</p>
            
            <p>For the nanocyte, it’s clear that the system of nanite investment for the nanite gear array is in need of revision or reconsideration. For mechs, we have heard the call for a simplification of formulae, as well as for more options when building a mech—both are high on our list of priorities. Of course, these design concerns just scratch the surface of the possibilities for the final versions—and there's still time to make your voice heard.</p>
            
            <p>For those who have already participated in the playtest, we thank you, and to those who plan to still send us feedback: we eagerly await your thoughts!</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, Sep 13, 4:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <h1>September Update— Volunteering, Stars, Spotlights and Conventions!</h1>

   <p itemprop="description">I joined Paizo’s Organized Play team in September 2015. Looking back over the past 5 years, I’ve collected several happy memories, made wonderful friends, and achieved important milestones. I’ve also learned a few hard lessons in communication and process implementation along the way. I’ve cried with some of you, laughed with more of you, and would happily do it all over again if I could.</p>

			<h2>OPM Musings</h2>
            <p itemprop="description">I joined Paizo’s Organized Play team in September 2015. Looking back over the past 5 years, I’ve collected several happy memories, made wonderful friends, and achieved important milestones. I’ve also learned a few hard lessons in communication and process implementation along the way. I’ve cried with some of you, laughed with more of you, and would happily do it all over again if I could.</p>
            <br clear="all"/>
            <p>Before accepting my position, I served as an Organized Play volunteer for 2 years. Some of the best gaming experiences I’ve ever had occurred while volunteering. I met people from around the globe, attended Gen Con—talk about crossing an item off my bucket list!—and sparked enthusiasm among my fellow gamers. I believe that volunteering brings people who love games even closer together. If you want to experience the benefits of serving as an Organized Play volunteer firsthand, check out our blog from last week on <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcr?Volunteering-with-the-Organized-Play-Foundation">how to volunteer with the Organized Play Foundation</a>. </p>

            
            <h2>Sanctioning</h2>
            
            <p>While no new character options were sanctioned in the past month, you can now earn Organized Play credit for <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcm?Free-RPG-Day-adventures-now-on-paizocom">Paizo’s Free RPG Day adventures</a>:  <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024ys?Pathfinder-Adventure-Little-Trouble-in-Big-Absalom">Little Trouble in Big Absalom</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024yr?Starfinder-Adventure-Skitter-Home">Skitter Home</a>. Such credit can be retroactively earned from games played on Free RPG Day. GMs should contact their players to issue chronicle sheets.</p>
            
            <p>Last week, James Case also <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcs?Rarity-and-Availability-in-Organized-Play">wrote a blog</a> explaining how rarity and access in Pathfinder Second Edition works in Pathfinder Society play. James’s thoughts should help explain our philosophy on less common options.<p>
            
            <p>Looking forward, we are actively working on three Adventure Paths: <em>Tyrant’s Grasp, Extinction Curse</em>, and <em>Threefold Conspiracy</em>. As we finish them, we will update you in future blogs.</p>
            
            <h2>Guides</h2>
            <p>To avoid conflict with the conventions this weekend, we scheduled the <em>Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society</em> upload for next week. An upcoming blog post will summarize the changes.</p>
            
            <p>The <em>Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society</em> is being actively revised and has an estimated publication date of September 15th. It will once again be housed online and we intend to provide a downloadable option as well. We will post the links in a blog once they are live.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, the <em>Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</em> is in the works and should be posted shortly. There are no program changes for Year 7, but we plan to include the adventure deck options first published in blogs so we have all the options in one place.</p>

            
            <h2>Achievement Points (AcP)</h2>
            <p>It’s been three weeks since ya looked at me, cocked your head to the side, and... oh wait, this isn’t the place for singing songs. Focus!</p>
            
            <p>We launched the boon purchase part of AcP just before Gen Con and are busy working out the bugs. The first step was to move the chronicle boons from the Year of the Open Road into the system so that we had digital versions as well as paper ones. This has caused some oddities to pop up, such as Chronicle Boon points appearing in the point total section. We are pausing the input process while we track down some of these number issues. Hopefully, fixing them will resolve the residual AcP challenges as well.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Volunteer Recognition</h2>
            
            <p>We awarded one new Campaign Coin at PaizoCon Francia this month. The following recipient is one of the longtime members of the Swiss venture-crew responsible for organizing many events. Congratulations to…</p>
            
            <p>Christopher Clark <b>839</b></p>
            
            <p>Thank you for all the effort you put into Organized Play, Christopher!</p>
            
            
            <h2>Stars/Novas/Glyphs</h2>
            
            <p>One GM received their fifth star in the last month. Doing so indicates a commitment to Organized Play, as to achieve this milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach five stars is 650 hours!</p>
            
            <p>Congratulations to <b>Patrick Berndt</b> for earning their fifth star!</p>
            
            <p>All five-star GMs should now see their stars listed by their name on the forums, as well as in their My Organized Play tab. If you are a five-star GM and your status is not visible on the forums, please email organizedplay [at] paizo [dot] com and let us know!</p>
            
            <p>We’re working through some technical snags before we can get caught up on our five-nova GMs, but we hope to have them ironed out soon. We’re also watching the climb to five glyphs with great interest, as many GMs have taken advantage of the online environment.</p>
            
            <p>There’s been some discussion about the requirements for evaluation games, so we want to clarify. Two main points. One, GMs should work with their RVC to get their evaluations completed in a method that works for the GM. If the RVC is not responsive, please reach out to the OP team for assistance. Two, the GM should complete the reviews in their usual medium, but if circumstances don’t allow, then they should choose a different platform they feel comfortable with – VTT, webcam, slides, etc. Any RVC/VC comfortable completing an evaluation in the GMs chosen method may do so. There is one caveat to this second piece.  A GM should only ask the Online region RVC/VCs to evaluate one of their games.  </p>
            
            <p>We think this will cover most issues, but if it does not, please communicate with either your RVC or the org play team so that we can find a solution to your particular issue.  We cannot write rules to cover every corner case, but we can work to find a way around impediments.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, there is a known bug where glyphs don’t display next to a username in the forums. We’ve asked the tech team to address this issue. Thank you to those who reached out to let us know there is a problem.</p>
            
            
		
			<h2>Convention Listing</h2>
            <p>If you don’t see a convention on the list that you think should be there, contact the event organizer and ask them to register their event for Organized Play support!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Meleeka drops into a ready stance. Legs spread slightly more than shoulder-width apart, left knee touching the ground, the ball of her right foot raised and poised to launch her in any direction at a moment’s notice. She begins slowly sweeping her arms in broad, circular movements, fingers curled like grasping talons as she channels her rage and negative emotions out of her body, giving them shape as flickering flames shrouding her hands.</p>
            
            <p>The soft clap from outside the training area is all the signal she needs. Meleeka launches herself off her right foot, throwing her body into a twisting spin to add momentum to her first blow, shattering a wooden training dummy into shards of smoking wood. Landing on her left foot, she kicks off the ground immediately, throwing herself into a backflip that takes her over the next nearest training dummy. Coiling her hands together into a hammer of fire, she reduces that target to shards as well. Eyeing the last target, a stone statue known to the initiated as One-Who-Waits, Meleeka charges forward, flames shrouding her feet and giving her extra momentum for her final leap. Arms outstretched, body turning from a vertical whirl to a horizontal spin, she latches onto the statue with her fingers, using her strength and momentum to sweep the heavy stone off the ground, overhead, and bringing it crashing back down in a fiery explosion.</p>
            
            <p>Looking at the wreckage, Meleeka is surprised to find that, unlike a few months previously, the fires had not stoked the anger in her heart, but consumed it, leaving her with a relaxed sense of peace that was entirely unfamiliar to the young and very talented martial artist.</p>
            
            <p>“You are ready.” The words come from one Rashmivati Melipdra, a jovial but imposing woman who had taken Meleeka under her wing, untwisting the young woman’s spirit while teaching her discipline and friendship. “You may not see it, but I do. I have no need for an apprentice who has learned all I have to teach.” Rashmivati says the words with an empathetic smile, her pride in her protégé plainly written on her face. “The rest of what you have to learn, you must learn for yourself.”</p>
            
            <p>“Where shall I go?” Meleeka asks.</p>
            
            <p>“Absalom first,” Rashmivati replies. “You should meet Ambrus, and Sorrina, and all the rest. In the Grand Lodge, you will encounter many people who see the world through eyes different from your own. Learn from them, and let their wisdom show you the next path in your journey.” Rashmivati pauses for a moment in pleasant reflection before continuing. “And tell my brother Shristi that it has been too long since he last visited home. Tell him he is missed, and that I trained you as a disciple. He may have more to teach you!” Rashmivati takes the young woman in a hug as she finishes. Meleeka’s body stiffens for a moment, still unused to Rashmivati’s displays of affection, before melting into the older woman’s arms.</p>
            
            <p>“What shall I do?” Meleeka whispers into the silken scarves covering her mentor’s shoulders.</p>
            
            <p>“Whatever you wish my child. Go, and make this world your own.”</p>

            <p>Hey everyone, Michael Sayre here! It’s with a mixture of sadness and excitement that I announce my departure from the Organized Play team. I’ve accepted a new position here at Paizo that will take my career in a direction I’ve always wanted to go and I’m excited about this new opportunity. But I will miss planning, outlining, and developing these adventures that we’ve all shared over the last two years! I’ve learned a lot from Linda, Tonya, John, Thursty, James, Alex, and everyone else who’s been a part of the Organized Play family during my time in this department. But don’t worry! I’m leaving you all in excellent hands, and Linda will be following up in a bit to let you know about the rest of the changes to the team.</p>
            
            <p>Thanks so much for allowing me to be part of this community, and hopefully I still have many more opportunities to join you all at a table in the years to come. You’re all awesome. And just in case this is the last time I get to say it…</p>
            
            <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

		<blockquote>

        <p itemprop="description"><p>“This <em>may</em> be it,” Aliyama stated carefully, consulting her wayfinder.</p>
        <p>The jungle was oppressively hot and humid, yet the elf showed no signs of it. She wore a purple, quilted doublet over silk sleeves, her cerulean cloak held by a golden pendant. Her hair, immaculately braided, was pulled back from her angular face revealing pointed ears adorned with yet more gold. She looked as fresh as if she were off to a meeting at the Grand Lodge.</p>
        
        <p>“’May?’” Reynold sputtered. In stark contrast, his brown hair was plastered with sweat, his Taldan finery wrinkled and stained. “’May!?’ There is no ‘may’ about it! Fola said the lost Pathfinder would be in a serpentfolk ruin in the middle of the bloody Mwangi Expanse. Sigvard sent us here to find the ruin. What do you bloody think <em>this</em> is?!”</p>
        
        <p>Aliyama looked up, arching an eyebrow. Her human compatriot was gesturing insistently with outstretched hands to the towering stone archway in front of them. It was flanked by enormous statues of hooded cobras, and the stonework was mas-terful, full of whirling, intertwined lines ornately framing an entrance into the overgrown hillside. If doors had once stood in the archway, they were long gone. Only a darkened rectangle of shadows stood between them and the interior.</p>
        
        <p>“Much as I hate to admit it, I agree wit’ Reynold here. This has gotta be the place,” Thri said, planting fists on hips. The fresh-faced dwarf’s topknot barely came to her companions’ ribs. “Let’s get in and find our missin’ Pathfinder, yeah?”</p>
        
        <p>
“Quite right,” Reynold nodded. “In we go! Then back to Sigvard and her endless chores. And then, blessedly, a ship back to glorious, civilized Absalom.”</p>

		<p>Aliyama held up a hand. “Abadar says that the world is filled with two kinds of people: the impulsive and the wealthy,” she said calmly. “We must examine the facts and think.”</p>
        
        <p>“I think,” Reynold pointed, rolling his eyes. “That the big overgrown temple with snakes outside is a serpentfolk ruin.”</p>
        
        <p>Thri snorted.</p>
        
        <p>The elf sighed. “Perhaps. But consider: the serpentfolk were one of the oldest civilizations in Golarion. They preceded even the Azlanti. Yet do these carvings appear worn away by the ages? Do they look as if they survived Earthfall?”</p>
        
		<p>Reynold opened his mouth, then snapped it shut, frowning.</p>
        
        <p>“Recall that I grew up in the Mwangi,” she continued. “Left unattended, the jungle claims everything. Everything. Were this truly an ancient serpentfolk temple, it would be nothing but vines. The Pathfinder agent that Sigvard originally sent here was a serpentfolk scholar and would have known this. No, surely this is not the place.”</p>
        
        <p>“So what’re ya sayin’?” Thri asked, cheeks flushing with anger. “What’s this, then?”</p>
        
        <p>Aliyama turned to face her. “Most likely the remnants of a misguided dragon cult of Dahak. Kobolds, charau-ka, boggards, or somesuch. These cults are common here, spawning and dying off constantly. Nasty business. But most certainly not some-thing actually created by the serpentfolk.”</p>
        
        <p>Thri exhaled, disappointment flooding her voice. “So we haven’t found it yet. No chargin’ in to rescue a lost Pathfinder.”</p>
        
        <p>Aliyama lay a gloved hand on the dwarf’s broad shoulder. “Do not worry, young one. I know this is your first excursion with the Pathfinder Society and you wish to make your mark. Yet take heart! This is the life of an adventurer. We explore, thoughtfully and with consideration. Abadar himself is a traveler, yes? Yet he is not hasty. He is slow and relentless, as the gears of civilization are slow and relentless. So too must we step carefully, always moving forward. We will find our missing Pathfinder agent, Thri Redbarrel. With patience, and by Abadar’s hand.”</p>
        
        <p>Thri accepted the lecture with a short nod, then shrugged. “Let’s keep lookin’. I hope we fight somethin’ soon, though. This heat is makin’ me cranky.”</p>
        
        <p>Aliyama smiled. “Battle too is an inevitable part of adventuring. Though this structure is not our destination, we are close. Let me consult my wayfinder again.” The elf flipped open the circular lid and began peering down at its face.</p>

		<p>A full minute passed, the elf consulting her wayfinder and muttering. The dwarf watched her, then scanned the surround-ings. All around them the jungle hooted and sang with life.</p>
        
        <p>“Uh... Ali?”</p>
        
        <p>“One more moment, please Thri.”</p>
        
        <p>“It’s just—” </p>
        
        <p>“Thri, please. Patience.”</p>

        <p>“Okay. It’s just that Reynold’s gone.”</p>

        <p>“I see. Well... What!?” Aliyama looked up, startled. “Where is he?”</p>

        <p>“I, uh. I’m thinkin’ maybe he went in.”</p>

        <p>They both stared at the ten-foot, darkened doorway.</p>

        <p>“Ridiculous, infuriating, impulsive, sneaky, dandy of a human,” the elf muttered. “He is always—”</p>

        <p>A cry echoed from deep within the hillside.</p>

        <p>“Yep, that’s him.” Thri pulled the double-bladed battle axe from her back.</p>

        <p>“Just hold a moment. We must—”</p>

        <p>Reynold burst from the shadows, wide-eyed. In one hand he held his shortsword. In the other, a coiling, golden figurine of a snake.</p>

		<p>“This is it! Bloody help!” he cried.</p>

		<p>“What did you do?” Aliyama demanded.</p>

		<p>“No time! Help!”</p>

		<p>Three tall, scaled humanoid figures in green robes spilled from the dark opening. At first Aliyama thought they might be iruxi. But instead of lizard-like heads, these figures bore the heads of hooded cobras. Long, whip-like tails thrashed as the figures moved sinuously into fighting formation. One of the creatures hissed and drew a curved blade the length of its forearm.  </p>

		<p>“Impossible,” Aliyama breathed.</p>

		<p>As Reynold scampered past one of the large, hooded statues, a sound of grinding stone filled the clearing. The mossy, guardian cobra turned its head, following the fleeing thief.</p>

		<p>“Look out!”</p>

		<p>Reynold dove to one side and rolled. The cobra’s head snapped its jaws together with a sharp CRACK! where his head had been. Reynold continued his roll smoothly and was back on his feet in an instant.</p>

		<p>“There are no more serpentfolk in the Mwangi,” Aliyama stated numbly. “They are in the Darklands, not on the surface. Kline’s report was thorough…”</p>

		<p>With an enthusiastic cry, Thri stepped forward and met the lead creature. Battleaxe and curved dagger clashed.</p>

		<p>“Our scholar is in there,” Reynold said, panting. “Pinned to the wall in the entry like some sort of warning. These figurines are in the nooks in the walls. I only snagged one before those things noticed me.”</p>

		<p>Aliyama glared at him. “Why are you grinning, thief?”</p>

		<p>“It just occurred to me that when this is over, you get to tell me I was right and you were wrong,” he winked. With a whoop, he dashed to flank the serpentfolk battling Thri.</p>

		<p>Shaking her head, Aliyama snapped her wayfinder shut and raised her arms, beginning a prayer to Abadar, Master of the First Vault. </p>

		<p>A single bead of sweat trickled down her forehead.</p>

  <p itemprop="description">I began a 12-week leave of absence at the beginning of February, during which life at Paizo, the games industry, and pretty much everywhere else changed due to the advent of COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns.

            <p itemprop="description">I began a 12-week leave of absence at the beginning of February, during which life at Paizo, the games industry, and pretty much everywhere else changed due to the advent of COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns. When I returned from leave at the end of April, I, like everyone else, was working from home and the to-do list I had left for myself in January suddenly needed to be rewritten.</p>

       <p>One of the first new priorities on the post-COVID list was to help support the thousands of players who were now restricted to playing Pathfinder and Starfinder exclusively on virtual tabletop programs like Roll20, Fantasy Grounds, D20Pro, Astral, and others. While our partners running these programs have done a great job of getting as much Pathfinder and Starfinder content as they could up on their respective marketplaces, I was tasked with figuring out how we at Paizo could provide more to our customers directly.</p>
       
       <p>Today, I’m happy to announce that we’re taking the first step in doing so, by updating the file format of our digital map products. Beginning with the September new releases, all digital versions of new Pathfinder Flip-Mats, Pathfinder Flip-Mat Classics, Pathfinder Flip-Tiles, Starfinder Flip-Mats, and Starfinder Flip-Tiles products will contain the PDFs our customers are used to as well as VTT-friendly JPGs ready for upload and use on the virtual tabletop platform of your choice.</p>
       
       
       <p>With over 200 existing Pathfinder and Starfinder map dating back nearly two decades, it is going to take us some time to add these JPG assets to our back catalogue, but we’re going to start that process this week as well. We plan to update a handful of Flip-Mat, Flip-Tiles, and Map Pack products each week with VTT-ready JPGs, working backwards from the August 2020 releases. Customers who own digital map products will receive an email alerting them to the changes to their downloadable assets when they are updated.</p>
       
        <br clear="all"/>
        
        <p>We’re still working with our partners to make these maps (as well as many other Pathfinder and Starfinder products) available for purchase natively in each platform’s content store, but in the meantime, enjoy your Pathfinder and Starfinder map products in whatever campaign you’re running on the VTT platform you like best.</p>
        
        <p>Let us know how else we can support you and your fellow players in this new digital gaming landscape, and we’ll see how long my to-do list becomes</p>

  <h1>Starfinder: Devastation Ark Adventure Path Trailer</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2020-09-01T18:15:00Z">Sep 1, 2020, 11:15 am</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">The discovery of a series of millennia-old ruins sets off a chain of events that puts an ancient titanic spacecraft on course to the Pact Worlds. When the vessel—which belongs to an evil, warmongering civilization long thought dead—begins destroying all other ships in its path and attacking important resources to increase its power, the heroes must rescue millions of lives from destruction and find a way to stop the ship and all aboard it. Will the heroes be triumphant? Or will the alien species take the Pact Worlds as its new home and conquer the galaxy?</p>
