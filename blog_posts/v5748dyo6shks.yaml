  \ or they/them)</h3> \n     <p>Allie Bustion is an independent and freelance narrative\
  \ and tabletop <a href=\"https://madpierrot.design/\" target=\"_blank\">game designer</a>,\

  \     <br> \n     <h3>Devinne Caples (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>My name is Devinne\
  \ and I am the HR Generalist for Paizo. I am also a wife and mom to three children.\
  \ I wear a lot of hats. I enjoy working in Human Resources and working at Paizo\
  \ has given me the opportunity to work in a very diverse work environment. Working\
  \ at Paizo has opened my eyes to the RPG world and how beneficial it can be to be\
  \ part of such a community, especially during these uncertain times. These communities\
  \ connect individuals and provide a means to still feel a part of something bigger\
  \ than themselves while in isolation. I admire what we do here.</p> \n     <div\

  \ “Rabbit” Lionel (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>Travis, circa 1994. Writer, gamer, black\
  \ guy. Growing up, I was always told I wasn’t black enough or I was trying too hard\
  \ to “act white” due to my hobbies and interests. I always loved games like Final\
  \ Fantasy and became invested into tabletop games such as Magic: The Gathering and\
  \ Pathfinder 1st Edition by the beginning of high school. However, I never let these\
  \ things stop me from loving my blackness, my history and my hobbies no matter how\
  \ far removed. Okay, that’s partially true; I did have some identity issues. Now,\
  \ I’m in a position to not only show that black people can participate in these\
  \ hobbies, but centralize themselves into the hobby as well. I was blessed with\
  \ the opportunity to work with Paizo on Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse in 2020.\
  \ I wanted this to be a chance for an African inspired setting to have a black voice\
  \ on it as often we have so few chances to make African settings anymore than mud\
  \ huts. I also wanted to show little black children that tabletop games and other\
  \ hobbies are not the exclusive domains of white people and that everyone is welcome.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I love love love, 2nd Edition Pathfinder and I hope to continue playing\
  \ and working on it in the future. In addition, you can find me on Twitch (<a href=\"\
  https://twitch.tv/eightbitrabbits\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitch.tv/eightbitrabbits</a>)\
  \ giving lots of opinions about games of both the tabletop and video variety here.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Erin Roberts (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>I'm a new(ish) freelancer\
  \ for Paizo, but I have been a writer for some time, telling stories of impossible\
  \ magic, maybe-one-day technology, and all-too-real things that go bump in the night\
  \ (feel free to check me out on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nirele\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@nirele</a>). I am also a child (and current resident) of East\
  \ Coast cities like New York and DC, with roots in the Deep South and Panama, who\
  \ grew up in a family that ensured that the lessons and pride and continued journey\
  \ of Black history were a fundamental part of who I am.</p> \n     <p>One of the\
  \ reasons that I enjoy writing so much is that I love to tell a good story, but\
  \ also that I love to think about the story beneath the story, the iceberg that\
  \ the tales we spin are only the very tip of. After all, even the silliest, most\
  \ ridiculously fluffy pieces of creative work teach you a little something, from\
  \ who gets to shape the world to what places make interesting backdrops to which\
  \ stories are worth telling. Part of why I love my creative work is that I have\
  \ the opportunity to bring who I am to the page, to add the people and places and\
  \ stories that I know from my experience as a Black woman to the undercurrents of\
  \ the collective tale we’re telling, and to lift up the power of community, the\
  \ fight against injustice, the distinction between race, culture, and destiny, and\
  \ the deep importance of collective joy.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Isis Wozniakowska\
  \ (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>I’m one of Paizo’s newer freelancers. I’ve written for\
  \ the upcoming Secrets of Magic book and my first Starfinder scenario, <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq027ms?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-321-Frozen-Ambitions-Renewals-Blight\"\
  >#3-21: Frozen Ambitions: Renewal's Blight</a>, was just announced. I’ve been involved\
  \ with Organized Play off and on for five years, but I’ve really become a more active\
  \ member within the past two. I also both play and GM Paizo APs and adventures regularly.\
  \ You might have even heard me in the most recent Starfinder Society special voicing\
  \ Luwazi Elsebo, a role which I’d be happy to reprise anytime (wink wink).</p> \n\
  \     <p>I’m the daughter of a Black woman and a Polish immigrant man. My mother\
  \ is a Blues musician, and a former belly dancer, which ended up giving me a Black\
  \ music and musical history education in my childhood. She has also always been\
  \ a major science fiction and superhero movie nerd. She and her siblings loved watching\
  \ Star Trek as kids and seeing a Black woman like Uhura on screen each week inspired\
  \ all of them.</p> \n     <p>The first time I showed my mother a picture of a Black\
  \ elf in one of my Pathfinder books she got so excited that she bought elf ears\
  \ for herself for Halloween because she’d never seen a classic fantasy race that\
  \ looked like her. I’ve gotten my passion for science fiction and fantasy from her,\
  \ and I can only hope to recreate more moments like this for her and other Black\
  \ people in the future through my time spent participating in Organized Play, and\
  \ through further work in writing for RPGs.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
