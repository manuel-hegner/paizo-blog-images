  \ Unchained</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April 16, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We've all been there. We've faced\
  \ the sad crossroads when we realized that our favorite magic item just wasn't cutting\
  \ it, and we couldn't justify keeping it instead of equipping the new and shinier\
  \ item the party just found instead. But what about the blacksmith who becomes a\
  \ hero fighting with her father's sword? Or the halfling who found a strange item\
  \ early in his career that turned out to be more than it seemed? That's where the\
  \ scaling magic items from <a href=\"/products/btpy97vo\"><em>Pathfinder Unchained</em></a>\
  \ come in. These items scale as you level, allowing them to be an important part\
  \ of your character (these sorts of items are called wonders) or a small and handy\
  \ tool throughout your career (these are called baubles) or something in between.\
  \ The math is all worked out to allow GMs to use a few different systems for the\
  \ advancement, including automatic advancement (in which case, it's recommended\
  \ to dole out less treasure if you want to keep the party at about the same power\
  \ level) or advancement using rituals and gold (the easier method for someone running\
  \ a published adventure). Scaling items have starting and ending levels for scaling,\
  \ so I've included two of the most wondrous of the wonders: wonders that scale all\
  \ the way up to 20th level!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Robe of the Faerie Queen</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Price</b> 4,800\
  \ gp<br> <b>Slot</b> body; <b>CL</b> 6th; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.<br> <b>Aura</b> strong\
  \ transmutation; <b>Scaling</b> wonder</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb120\">\n   \
  \   <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1131-RobeFaerieQueen.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1131-RobeFaerieQueen_120.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">When donned, this sheer, sleeved cape fades to\
  \ near invisibility. It grants the wearer a +4 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy,\
  \ Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against fey. On command, the mantle glows\
  \ in delicate faerie fire of any color, and a second command word ceases its glow.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>8th Level</b>: The mantle magnifies and sharpens\
  \ the wearer's beauty such that her +4 competence bonus now applies to all Charisma\
  \ checks, Charisma-based skill checks, and Sense Motive checks against creatures.\
  \ Against fey, the bonus increases to +6.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>10th\
  \ Level</b>: The mantle's wearer becomes manipulative and eloquent in social situations.\
  \ Whenever she converses with creatures, she can insert a suggestion (DC 14 Will\
  \ save negates) for every 10 minutes of conversation by succeeding at a DC 14 Perform\
  \ (oratory) check. If she ever fails the Perform (oratory) check to use this ability,\
  \ all creatures who witnessed her misstep are immune to this ability for 24 hours.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>12th Level</b>: Once per day, the wearer can\
  \ release the glow within the mantle in a single coruscating burst of color. This\
  \ blinds creatures in a 10-foot radius (Reflex DC 19 negates) for 1d4 rounds and\
  \ completely dispels any darkness spells of 6th level or lower whose source is within\
  \ its area.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>14th Level</b>: The wearer grows\
  \ a pair of gossamer wings. The wings are delicate and weak, carrying the wearer\
  \ only with difficulty. She gains a fly speed of 30 feet (poor maneuverability).</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>16th Level</b>: The wearer's wings grow stronger,\
  \ more agile, and more beautiful, as iridescent patterns trace along them. Her fly\
  \ speed increases to 60 feet (good maneuverability), and she gains a +5 competence\
  \ bonus to Fly checks.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>18th Level</b>: The\
  \ wearer gains a small domain in the fey realm. She can access her domain from any\
  \ location, creating a silvery gateway. Treat her domain as a mage's magnificent\
  \ mansion except that its size is equal to 20 10-ft. cubes/level, the domain appears\
  \ as a natural wilderness instead of a mansion, and the servants are tiny fey instead\
  \ of nearly-transparent liveried servants.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"\
  ><b>20th Level</b>: The wearer's type changes to fey, and she gains DR 10/cold iron.\
  \ If the wearer's type was already fey and she already possessed DR/cold iron, her\
  \ DR increases by 10 and magic weapons with enhancement bonuses of +3 or greater\
  \ do not count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing her DR.</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-breaker\">Construction</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Requirements</b>\
  \ Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor, faerie fire, fly, mage's magnificent mansion,\
  \ sunburst, suggestion, creator must be fey; <b>Cost</b> 132,000 gp</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-title\" style=\"margin: 24px 0 0 0;\">Crystal Tiara</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Price</b> 1,000 GP<br> <b>Slot</b> head; <b>CL</b>\
  \ 3rd; <b>Weight</b> â€“<br> <b>Aura</b> moderate conjuration; <b>Scaling</b> wonder</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">Despite its fragile appearance, this intricate\
  \ ice crystal tiara has hardness 12 and 10 hp. Its wearer gains the effects of endure\
  \ elements against cold conditions only.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>5th\
  \ Level</b>: Once per day, the wearer can summon a small ice elemental as summon\
  \ monster II.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>7th Level</b>: As a standard\
  \ action, the wearer can launch an icicle at a foe within 30 ft. as a ranged attack.\
  \ On a hit, the icicle deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold\
  \ damage. The wearer can walk across icy ground without slipping.</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>10th Level</b>: As part of her move action, the wearer\
  \ can step into the air, creating crystalline stairs beneath her feat, adding new\
  \ steps in whichever direction she travels, and melting away behind her. If another\
  \ tries to climb the steps, they crumble away, leaving only the portions beneath\
  \ the wearer's feet intact. This otherwise acts as the air walk spell. She can use\
  \ this ability each day for 10 minutes per level, divided any way she chooses in\
  \ 10 minute intervals.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1131-CrystalTiara.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>12th Level</b>: Once per\
  \ day, the wearer can call forth an ice storm. When she uses the tiara to summon\
  \ ice elementals, she can either summon 1d4 small ice elementals or 1 medium ice\
  \ elemental as summon monster IV.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>14th Level</b>:\
  \ Once per day, the wearer can travel to a safe, very familiar location, as if she\
  \ had cast ice crystal teleport on herself. When she uses the tiara to summon ice\
  \ elementals, she can also choose to summon 1d3 medium ice elementals or 1 large\
  \ ice elemental as summon monster V.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>16th\
  \ Level</b>: The wearer can use the tiara to call up a tower of ice, exactly as\
  \ an instant fortress except that the tiara does not transform into the tower, the\
  \ tower takes 1 minute to rise instead of 1 round, the walls of the tower only have\
  \ 12 hardness, like the tiara, and damage to the tower does not carry over upon\
  \ multiple uses of this ability.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>18th Level</b>:\
  \ When the wearer calls forth a tower of ice, if there is enough open space, she\
  \ can also choose to call forth a small palace instead, 100 feet square at the base\
  \ with 20 foot tall rooms, with a central tower 20 feet square and 100 feet high.\
  \ At will, she can spend 5 rounds to transform into a flurry of snowflakes that\
  \ can move at incredible speed. Treat this as wind walk except she gains vulnerability\
  \ to fire. It normally takes 5 rounds to transform back into her normal shape. However,\
  \ she can revert to her original form early as a standard action. If she does so,\
  \ she cannot transform into snowflakes again for 24 hours. When she uses the tiara\
  \ to summon ice elements, she can also choose to summon 1d4+1 medium ice elementals,\
  \ 1d3 large ice elementals, or 1 huge ice elemental as summon monster VI.</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>20th Level</b>: The wearer gains cold resistance\
  \ 30. When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can also choose to summon\
  \ 1d4+1 huge ice elementals, 1d3 greater ice elementals, or 1 elder ice elemental\
  \ as summon monster VIII. She can create ice stairs without a daily limit, and if\
  \ she wishes, they last for 1 minute before melting, even if another creature tries\
  \ to climb them. If she chooses to make them last longer, she can dismiss the stairs\
  \ behind her as a swift action, potentially causing creatures climbing the stairs\
  \ to fall.</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p class=\"stat-block-breaker\">Construction</p>\

  \ including one of my personal favorite sections in the book, a narrative variant\
  \ of magic item creation, complete with strange quirks that your item might develop\
  \ (\"My sword is sprouting tentacles!? Aberrant bloodrager, I knew we shouldn't\
  \ have listened to your gut!\" \"Hey, the tentacles are helping, man!) Tune in next\
