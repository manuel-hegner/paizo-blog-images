  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We've been pretty vocal (I hope!)\
  \ about one of the big changes to the rulebook line with the introduction of significant\
  \ amounts of world content from Golarion in the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide\"\
  ><em>Adventurer's Guide</em></a>. In fact, we've been relaxing the \"world-neutral\"\
  \ element of the rulebook line for some time, as far back as <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures\"\
  ><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> where we abandoned the generic names for planes\
  \ like the Boneyard and just used the Golarion/Great Beyond names in there. By lifting\
  \ this self-imposed restriction, we're not fundamentally changing the type of content\
  \ we're putting in rulebooks, but it does allow us to make our own rulebooks work\
  \ even better with our own campaign setting.</p> \n    <p>Golarion is, after all,\
  \ the setting used most overall by Pathfinder players. Gamemasters who run Pathfinder\
  \ games set in other settings already had to decide how to incorporate flavor into\
  \ their campaigns, changing names as needed, so whether or not they're changing\
  \ the name of something called a \"Red Mantis\" or \"Crimson Killer\" or a \"Scarlet\
  \ Slayer\" or whatever, by using the Golarion name we're making it more elegant\
  \ and obvious how it fits into the vast majority of everything else Paizo publishes.\
  \ But in order to standardize things for those who wish to reference names that\
  \ remain our product identity, the Rules index for <em>Adventurer's Guide</em> lists\
  \ alternate names as appropriate. So, if you want to use the Aldori swordlords in\
  \ your game, you can either make a name up that fits your setting, use the \"Aldori\
  \ swordlord\" in your setting, or go with our suggested \"world neutral\" name.\
  \ So for example, the \"Aldori defender\" archetype becomes the \"sword duelist\
  \ defender\", the \"Aldori dueling sword\" is merely the \"dueling sword\", and\
  \ so on.</p> \n    <p>But there's another element in <em>Adventurer's Guide</em>\
  \ that does something a little different, and this should specifically appeal to\
  \ and intrigue fans of Golarion. When we were deciding what organizations to include\
  \ in this book, there were a few that were no-brainers—Hellknights, Red Mantis,\
  \ and the Pathfinder Society to name a few. We also knew we wanted to explore some\
  \ of the concepts we've come up with more recently, like the Rivethun. But there\
  \ was another category that was a bit trickier—organizations that we debuted and\
  \ explored in our Adventure Paths. In many ways, these groups have become some of\
  \ the most well-known organizations, because they've been the focus of entire campaigns.\
  \ I'm talking about groups like the Council of Thieves, the Silver Ravens, the Cyphermages,\
  \ and the Lantern Bearers—groups that were created for an Adventure Path first.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Perhaps the most famous of all these groups are the Gray Maidens—and\
  \ in this case, they were absolutely created for an Adventure Path. Until the events\
  \ of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of the\
  \ Crimson Throne</a> occur, there are no Gray Maidens at all in Golarion. But of\
  \ all the groups in the setting, the look of the Gray Maiden has hit more eyes than\
  \ ANY other group… because we put the iconic image of a Gray Maiden (created by\
  \ the ever-talented Eva Widermann) on the back of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> itself.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So how can we present information about an organization that might well\
  \ not even exist yet?</p> \n    <p>The answer was to make the assumption that the\
  \ content of the <em>Adventurer's Guide</em> exists in a world after the events\
  \ of those campaigns have played out. This allowed us to not only include groups\
  \ like this in the book, but to explore how the events of their campaigns changed\
  \ and shaped them. In the case of the Lantern Bearers in particular, this change\
  \ is incredibly significant. In the <a href=\"/pathfinder/advenutrePath/secondDarkness\"\
  >Second Darkness Adventure Path</a>, the Lantern Bearers were a puppet group manipulated\
  \ by a shadowy conspiracy. In <em>Adventurer's Guide</em>, the assumption is that\
  \ the Lantern Bearers have come out from that shadow and are well on the way to\
  \ recovering and redeeming themselves. They still seek to stem the evil of demon\
  \ worship and threats from the Darklands, but do so in a way more aimed at redeeming\
  \ lost sisters and brothers and saving them from themselves rather than via shadowy\
  \ stealth ops or conspiracy tactics. This results in a far more interesting group\
  \ with less cliche and more growth to build upon.</p> \n    <p>We've made every\
  \ attempt to avoid spoiling adventure paths from which these groups came from, of\
  \ course, with the goal of having this content serve almost like a movie trailer;\
  \ you won't learn everything there is to know about the plot of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves\"\
  >Council of Thieves Adventure Path</a> by reading the Council of Thieves chapter\
  \ in <em>Adventurer's Guide</em>, but if we've done our job right, you'll be intrigued\
  \ and perhaps want to play or run Council of Thieves as a result. The bulk of the\
  \ new rules options for these groups are all brand new, so if you're a GM you can\
  \ use the prestige classes and archetypes and items and spells and options in <em>Adventurer's\
  \ Guide</em> to enhance an Adventure Path as you run it, perhaps even by giving\
  \ out options to PCs as rewards for progressing through the story. You can also\
  \ use them to bolster elements in an ongoing campaign, of course.</p> \n    <div\
