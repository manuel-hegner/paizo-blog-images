  \ Edition</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 20, 2008</p> \n   <p>Sometimes\
  \ it truly amazes me how things work in real life. Most of the time, there's a strategy\
  \ behind our product releases. Many months of scheming and preparation go into each\
  \ Paizo product. Sometimes, though, there's a project like <a href=\"/titanicGames/v5748btpy82cx\"\
  >Falling</a> that... falls into our laps. </p> \n   <p>A few months ago we were\
  \ sitting around the conference table brainstorming new products for the Titanic\
  \ Games line. Somebody, I think it was Mike Selinker, said \"What about Falling?\"\
  \ That was all it took!</p> \n   <p>\"Let's set it in Golarion!\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Let's use goblins!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yeah, goblins falling from the sky!\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Goblins falling from the sky and fighting! We can make another goblin song!\"\
  </p> \n   <p>That turned out to be a perfect fit! A re-envisioning of one of James\
  \ Ernest's most popular card games, now out of print for many years, was suddenly\
  \ slated to be our next release. </p> \n   <p>Coming up with the idea is sometimes\
  \ the easiest step in producing a great product. Really, it's the quality of the\
  \ writing or the style of the art that makes or breaks a game. In this case we knew\
  \ that it was crucial that the art style spoke to the fun and silly aspects of the\
  \ game while keeping true to the world we were building in Pathfinder. Fortunately\
  \ for us, we had just the guy to stay true to our vision. Our own in-house Drew\
  \ Pocza did a tremendous job on our Christmas card last year and we knew his cartoonish\
  \ style would work perfectly for our version of Falling. Drew jumped at the chance,\
  \ and the rest just fell together. </p> \n   <p>Here are another couple of cards\
  \ from <a href=\"/titanicGames/v5748btpy82cx\">Falling: The Goblin Edition</a>.\
  \ We hope you like them!</p> \n   <div align=\"center\"> \n    <img src=\"/image/content/secondary/PZOTGL3001-Push_500.jpeg\"\
