  \ we mentioned in our Starfinder Society edition of this blog, we wanted to give\
  \ our wonderful digital adventure authors a chance to brag about the awesome scenarios\
  \ they wrote during the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. We hope you enjoy hearing\
  \ from them and that you’re looking forward to our new metaplot, the Year of Boundless\
  \ Wonder!</p> \n     <h3>Alex Speidel<br> <em style=\"font-size: 15;\">Organized\

  font-size: 15;\">Pathfinder Bounty #12: Somewhere Below</em></h3> \n     <p>The\
  \ inspiration came from the prompt provided by Mike Kimmel who was the Organized\
  \ Play Developer back then. Along with a few too many ghost stories that I’d been\
  \ reading at the time, and Indiana Jones (for the NPC), Somewhere Below was born.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Favorite Part: it has to be the haunt at the end. Ghosts reaching out\
  \ from beyond the veil to drag you across will always be a great visual, and it’\
  s not often you get to combine that with a bunch of crawling claws or deal negative\
  \ damage at 1st level. A particular challenge for the adventure though was to make\
  \ one of the other encounters variable so the adventure could be run multiple times.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Plugs: I’m currently working on a Starship heist adventure for Starfinder,\
  \ that I hope to put out on Starfinder Infinite in the not-too-distant future. It’\
  ll work as both a 0-level adventure and a hook or lead-in to both Dead Suns and\
  \ Drift Crashers. The heroes perform an “Ocean’s 11” style theft of a starship on\
  \ behalf of a crime boss that they know. They get to keep the ship afterward instead\
  \ of rolling it up during character creation—and it comes with something special.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>If you’re ever interested in what I’m up to, regardless of whether that’\
  s for Pathfinder, Starfinder, or something else, I have a small publishing outfit\
  \ over at <a href=\"https://www.beyond-the-horizon-games.com/\">https://www.beyond-the-horizon-games.com/</a></p>\

  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-08: Foundation's Price</em></a> for the Year\
  \ of Shattered Sanctuaries. For my inspiration, I like to dive deep into the lore\
  \ of a region, time period, or monster to get ideas and connect things together,\
  \ so when they appear together in the story, the connections feel natural. Besides\
  \ that, I tend to dust off anything and everything that even tangentially relates\
  \ to the focus of the adventure, like old books or music that could help me capture\
  \ its feel. My favorite part of Foundation’s Price is without a doubt the marketplace\
  \ section. In my home games (as a forever DM) I love giving players a chance to\
  \ interact with the world and get to know the people in it, so writing this section\
  \ and coming up with different ideas was a lot of fun.</p> \n     <p>My twitter\
  \ is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Letterio_DM\">@Letterio_DM</a>, where I should\

  \ <em style=\"font-size: 15;\">PFS #3-09: The Secluded Siege</em></h3> \n     <p>Hello\
  \ all! My author contribution to the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries was <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02api?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-309-The-Secluded-Siege\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-09: The Secluded Siege</em></a>. When I first\
  \ received the project outline for The Secluded Siege, I was thrilled to learn I\
  \ had been assigned to “shatter” the Sandswept Hall, a Pathfinder Lodge with a long,\
  \ less than wholesome, history. Researching a wealth of past adventures, I poured\
  \ as much of them into The Secluded Siege as word count would allow. Within its\
  \ pages, veteran Pathfinders must not only overcome hordes of undead, but also face\
  \ deadly defenses, gnawing rumors, and perilous locations drawn from the Lodge’\
  s storied past, each of which dates all the way back to <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy87os\"\
  >Season 0 of Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>, before the first edition of\
  \ the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game had even seen print!</p> \n     <p>After turning\
  \ in my draft of The Secluded Siege, I soon became thrilled once again. I received\
  \ a new project outline where I had been assigned to “shatter” another notable sanctuary,\
  \ one with a long, less than wholesome, history. You will have to pour into the\
  \ pages of last month’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d6k?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-505-BoomBlock-Gambit\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #5-05: Boom-Block Gambit</em></a> to find out what threats\
  \ from the past veteran Starfinder agents must face within the Adamantine Bastille.\
  \ I had so much fun researching the Adamantine Bastille that the prison setting\
  \ became the subject of <a href=\"https://www.starfinderinfinite.com/product/405803/The-Adamantine-Bastille-The-Once-Unbreakable-Prison-of-the-Starfinder-Society?affiliate_id=378893\"\
  >my very first offering</a> for Starfinder Infinite! </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jacob\
  \ W. Michaels (he/him)<br> <em style=\"font-size: 15;\">PFS #3-14: The Tomb Between\
  \ Worlds</em></h3> \n     <p>Greetings Pathfinder Society agents, I’m Jacob W. Michaels\
  \ (he/him), the author of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0o?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-314-The-Tomb-Between-Worlds\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-14: The Tomb Between Worlds</em></a>. Knowing\
  \ I was going to be working in an undead-filled pyramid and playing with the Shadow\
  \ Plane, I wanted to try to make as sandbox-y a dungeon as possible, with lots of\
  \ opportunities for PCs to jump back and forth between planes, because who doesn’\
  t love a little plane hopping, especially at lower levels? The Shadow Plane has\
  \ so many great options, and adding a velstrac felt like a perfect, unexpected challenge\
  \ amid all the undead. The fact that he just wants to be friends (or does he just\
  \ maybe have an ulterior motive?) made him even more delicious, and I hope I gave\
  \ players some moral quandaries to figure out (and fun for the GM to roleplay).\
  \ I was also thrilled to include the cu sith–which I created in my first second\
  \ edition assignment (for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022kx?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-153-Life-s-Long-Shadows\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #153: Life’s Long Shadows</em></a>), but which I\
  \ don’t think had been part of any Paizo encounter until now. (Lastly, I recognize\
  \ the final fight’s been polarizing. I’m sorry for those whose characters died,\
  \ since I know how frustrating that is, and appreciate those who really enjoyed\
  \ being pushed to the limits before triumphing in the end.)</p> \n     <br> \n \

  \ and I was delighted to write both <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ne?Starfinder-Society-Intro-2-For-the-Factions\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Intro #2: For the Factions</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3m?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-315-Cavern-of-the-Sundered-Song\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-15: Cavern of the Sundered Song</em></a>. These\
  \ represent the extreme ends of the level range for Society products, with For the\
  \ Factions serving as an introductory scenario for first and second level PCs and\
  \ Cavern of the Sundered Song releasing as the first 9-12 scenario for Pathfinder\
  \ Society! Both were lots of fun to write, in very different ways. With Intro 2,\
  \ I wanted to make sure that even a brand-new group of players would be successful,\
  \ while I knew only very experienced players would take on Cavern of the Sundered\
  \ Song and they would expect a challenge! My favorite part of For the Factions is\
  \ the interview and getting to hear the neat backstories and talents of all the\
  \ PCs. My favorite part of Cavern of the Sundered Song is the NPC who shows off\
  \ his crystal collection (strike a pose!).</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Brent Bowser<br>\
  \ <em style=\"font-size: 15;\">PFS 3-16: Escape from Oppara</em></h3> \n     <p>I\
  \ love Taldor, so when I got the chance to write <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-316-Escape-from-Oppara\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-16: Escape From Oppara</em></a>, I immediately\
  \ dove back into the deep history of the country. Reading that the First through\
  \ Eighth Armies were recognized for their conquests, I had a pretty solid idea of\
  \ who The Ninth Army was. Writing them was cathartic. Narratively, I enjoyed writing\
  \ the spy games between Lady Gloriana and The Peddler and exploring Taldor in the\
  \ aftermath of War for the Crown. Mechanically, it’s very important to me that I\
  \ wrote a scenario where everyone who gets dispatched into the completely random,\
  \ unorthodox, and oftentimes illogical party composition for a Pathfinder Society\
  \ mission had a chance to contribute to the skill tests. I also wanted to push some\
  \ boundaries of monster design, so I hope everyone enjoyed the final encounter.</p>\
