  \              <p>Most of the time when you're adventuring, you're exploring. Whether\
  \ you're examining a dusty tomb, blazing trails through a dense jungle, or disguising\
  \ your way into an enemy fortress, exploration is all about discovery. It takes\
  \ place on a fluid time scale, ranging from roughly 10 minutes to hours, or even\
  \ days for a long overland expedition. It's dangerous to go alone, especially when\
  \ you don't know if you'll have an important skill you need to brave the perils\
  \ of a dungeon, but fortunately you'll be part of a team. If you're an expert or\
  \ better in a skill, you'll be able to help your allies with that skill while exploring,\
  \ by coaching your less athletic teammates up the cliffside and spotting the worst\
  \ of the climb, using hand gestures to sneak your louder allies past the guards\
  \ at the best moment, and more!</p>\n              <p>In addition to a handful of\
  \ exploration actions characters can take while in this game mode, the book also\
  \ presents a number of skills that can be used while exploring.</p>\n          \

  \ alt=\"Text inset: SKILL EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES. Chapter 4: Skills include numerous\
  \ additional exploration activities, which are summarized here.  \r\nBorrow an Arcane\
  \ Spell: You use Arcana to prepare a spell from someone else's spellbook (page 241).\r\
  \nCoerce: You use Intimidation to threaten a creature so it does what you want (page\
  \ 247).\r\nCover Tracks: You use Survival to obscure your passing (page 252).\r\n\
  Decipher Writing: You use a suitable skill to understand archaic, esoteric, or obscure\
  \ texts (page 234).\r\nGather Information: You use Diplomacy to canvass the area\
  \ to learn about a specific individual or topic (page 246).\r\nIdentify Alchemy:\
  \ You use Craft and alchemist's tools to identify an alchemical item (page 245).\r\
  \nIdentify Magic: Using a variety of skills, you can learn about a magic item, location,\
  \ or ongoing effect (page 238). \r\nImpersonate: You use Deception and usually a\
  \ disguise kit to create a disguise (page 245).\r\nLearn a Spell: You use the skill\
  \ corresponding to the spell’s tradition to gan access to a new spell (page 238).\r\
  \nMake an Impression: You use Diplomacy to make a good impression on someone (page\
  \ 246). \r\nRepair: With a repair kit and the Crafting skill, you fix a damaged\
  \ item (page 243).\r\nSense Direction: You use Survival to get a sense of where\
  \ you are or determine the cardinal directions (page 252).\r\nSqueeze: Using Acrobatics,\
  \ you squeeze through very tight spaces (page 241).\r\nTrack: You use Survival to\
  \ find and follow creatures’ tracks (page 252).\r\nTreat Wounds: You use Medicine\
  \ to treat a living creature’s wounds (page 249). \">\n              </div>\n  \
  \            <h2>Encounter</h2>\n              <p>When every action matters, your\
  \ characters enter an encounter, proceeding turn by turn, action by action. These\
  \ crop up in the middle of exploration, putting your travels on hold so you can\
  \ deal with an immediate danger or opportunity. Combat encounters are the most typical\
  \ encounters, taking place on a scale of mere seconds between life and death, but\
  \ all encounters share a common structure: you roll initiative to determine turn\
  \ order, then you take turns, performing your actions and determining what happens.\
  \ In a combat encounter, each turn you get one reaction and three actions you can\
  \ spend however you want. For instance, on her turn in combat, a sorcerer might\
  \ spend all three actions to unleash a deadly barrage of <em>magic missiles</em>\
  \ while a fighter might raise his shield and then use a Sudden Charge to rush an\
  \ enemy and attack.</p>\n              <p>It's during encounters that most player\
  \ characters will bestow conditions upon their foes, or gain a condition as the\
  \ result of the conflict. To make the wide range of conditions that can come into\
  \ play easier for new players to learn, we provide a full-page list of them without\
  \ any of the associated rules. This allows someone to quickly reference what it\
  \ means to be stunned or stupefied, and tell the difference between being undetected,\
  \ invisible, or concealed.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  \ alt=\"Text Inset: CONDITIONS. These conditions appear often in the game and are\
  \ defined in detail in the Conditions Appendix on pages 618-623. Here’s a brief\
  \ summary of each.\r\nBlinded: You’re unable to see.\r\nBroken: This item can’t\

  \ heroes sometimes need a break from the incredible stress of an adventuring life!\
  \ During downtime, you can earn money, craft items, swap out old character choices\
  \ for different options, or just take a rest and carouse with the locals. You take\
  \ your downtime when you return to the safety of a town or home base, usually after\
  \ completing an adventure. While downtime in general flows quickly through days\
  \ or weeks at a time, depending on the choices you make, new options might open\
  \ themselves up to you as the GM sprinkles special downtime events into your chosen\
  \ downtime activity, zooming in temporarily to highlight interesting or unusual\
  \ occurrences when you're not out on an adventure.</p>\n              <p>Downtime\
  \ gets the least amount of space of the three game modes, but it's an incredibly\
  \ rich design space built into the core of the game that may lead to new innovations\
  \ over the lifespan of Second Edition (some of which we're already working on).\
  \ As in Exploration Mode, players can utilize some of their skills for downtime\
  \ activities.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <img\

  Text inset: SKILL DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES.\r\nChapter 4: Skills includes several downtime\
  \ activities, which are summarized here.\r\nCraft: Using the Crafting skill, you\
  \ can create items from raw materials (page 244).\r\nCreate Forgery: You forge a\
  \ document (page 251).\r\nEarn Income: You earn money, typically using Crafting,\
  \ Lore, or Performance (page 236).\r\nSubsist: You find food and shelter in the\
  \ wilderness or within a settlement (page 240).\r\nTreat Disease: You spend time\
  \ caring for a diseased creature in the hope of curing that creature (page 248).\"\
  >\n              </div>\n              <h2>Treasure</h2>\n              <p>While\
  \ many adventurers risk their lives due to heroism or a sense of duty, treasure\
  \ is a major motivator for others. And let's be honest, even when playing an altruistic\
  \ PC, it's still a lot of fun to find a cool magic item for your character. In Pathfinder,\
  \ your characters will find a fairly steady stream of magic items, ranging from\
  \ simple <em>healing potions</em> to the mighty <em>skyhammer</em>. Some of the\
  \ more inexpensive items are consumable, meaning they can be used once, like alchemical\
  \ elixirs you drink, scrolls you read, and special talismans you can attach to your\
  \ other items. Others, like magic weapons or enchanted clothing and tools, serve\
  \ you again and again as you adventure. You could wield a <em>storm flash</em> rapier\
  \ arcing with electricity and wear a <em>dread blindfold</em> to strike fear into\
  \ your foes! You can also find magic runes you can etch onto weapons and armor to\
  \ build all kinds of powerful combinations!</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ guard while it’s wielded. When out of its sheath under an open sky, the blade\

  \nWhen tied over your eyes, this ragged strip of black linen gives you a +3 item\
  \ bonus to Intimidation checks and darkvision. You can see through the blindfold,\
  \ but only using darkvision. \r\nThe first time a particular creatures sees you\
  \ in a day, it must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be frightened 1. This is an\
  \ emotion, fear, and mental effect, and your allies become immune to it after about\
  \ a week.\r\n\r\nActivate command; Frequency: once per minute; \r\nTrigger: You\
  \ damage a creature with a Strike; Effect: Your target is gripped by intense fear.\
  \ This has the effect of a DC 37 phantasmal killer spell, but it is an enchantment\

  \    <p>In Pathfinder, you learn from your adventures, both your triumphs and your\
  \ failures, growing more powerful and gaining fantastic new abilities. We measure\
  \ that progress with Experience Points (XP), and typically the more impressive and\
  \ insurmountable the challenge for your character, the more XP you gain for overcoming\
  \ it. Once you earn a total of 1,000 XP, you reach a new level, opening up new options\
  \ for your character. Next week we'll go into detail about leveling up!</p>\n  \

  \ alt=\"Three characters sitting on the grass in the shade under an old, very leafy\
  \ tree. The weather is partially cloudy. Kneeling on the left is Kyra, a cleric,\
  \ is holding up a glowing idol in both hands and looking at it intently. She is\
  \ wearing long flowing blue and white garments with gold dotted circular designs.\
  \  She is facing away from the group, to the left of the picture. In the center\
  \ and further back, Lem, a halfling bard, is sitting barefoot, wrapped in a short-sleeved\
  \ cloak or jacket. He is playing the flute with his eyes closed. On the far right,\
  \ Ezren the wizard, a human male with long white hair, is studying from two open\
  \ books floating in front of him. He has one hand on the pages of each book, and\
  \ his hands are glowing. The book on the left has a glowing circle of glyphs surrounding\
  \ his hands\"></a>\n               <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration by\
