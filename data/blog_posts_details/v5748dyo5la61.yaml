  artist: "investigating the powers of air. Not surprisingly, this set includes a\
    \ number of magic items with an air theme, and those presented here are just a\
    \ sample. Of course, air has long been associated with storms, wind, and lightning,\
    \ so you might just find a few weapons and suits of armor with what appear to\
    \ be those qualities in the set as well. Mystery of Air: With a wind of 42 mph,\
    \ what is the farthest that a flying air mephit could be blown in 1 round, without\
    \ it moving at all under its own power or attempting to resist? All answers for\
    \ the Mystery of Air are due by 12:01 PM Pacific Standard Time on Thursday, July\
    \ 26th. Make sure to put the phrase \"Mystery of Air\" in the subject line of\
    \ the email. Good luck! Jason Bulmahn, GameMastery Brand Manager"
