  description\">When souls pass from the Material Plane to the Great Beyond, most\
  \ speed through the Astral Plane on their way to final judgment and placement with\
  \ in the fantastical outer planes. Other souls take a detour. Highly charged emotions\
  \ shake them out of the stream of souls, and toward the esoteric gravity of the\
  \ Negative Material Plane. Tragically, many of these souls are transformed into\
  \ horrifying and dangerous undead creatures who haunt the multiverse unleash their\
  \ malice and hate upon living creatures they encounter. A select few are able to\
  \ pull themselves out of this horrid free fall. These phantoms push their way back\
  \ through the Ethereal Plane until they find a psychically attuned individual to\
  \ serves as anchor and sanctuary for their spirit.</p> \n    <p>These psychic anchors\
  \ are called spiritualists, but they are much more than a psychic haven for the\
  \ phantom. The relationship between a spiritualist and its phantom is mutually beneficial.\
  \ While the phantom is confined within her mind, it grants the spiritualist focus\
  \ with skills tied to the phantom's powerful emotions, as well as powerful protections\
  \ against mind-affecting effects. Furthermore, the spiritualist can manifest her\
  \ harbored spirit partially or fully in either incorporeal or ectoplasmic form,\
  \ gaining access to a powerful combat ally and scout. Coupling this relationship\
  \ with spellcasting focusing on life, death, spirit, and ectoplasm manipulation,\
  \ clearly a spiritualist commands forces beyond the pale.</p> \n    <p>During the\
  \ <em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em> playtest, it became clear that our list\
  \ of phantom emotional aspects was incomplete. Especially missing was a powerful\
  \ emotion that tied the phantom to the spiritualist in a closer, more intimate way.\
  \ While we avoided making emotional focuses that were very positive in nature (after\
  \ all, it's typically very strong negative emotions that makes a soul drift toward\
  \ the Negative Material Plane), we added a dedication emotional as a companion to\
  \ the zeal aspect helping fill the niche for those desiring to play a spiritualist\
  \ that didn't entirely dwell within the super-negative spectrum of emotions. We\
  \ also added despair to that list, as that emotion was a good fit for the more negative\
  \ side of the spectrum. Aside some bits of minor fine-tuning, and a restructuring\
  \ of the bonded manifestation ability, we took a close look at the phantom's ability\
  \ to scout in incorporeal form via the etheric tether class feature. While an incorporeal\
  \ phantom can still scout while outside of line of effect from its spiritualist\
  \ master, the amount of time it can do so is much shorter than the playtest version\
  \ of the class.</p> \n    <p>In the end, the spiritualist is a class that allows\
  \ you to channel forces from beyond the grave, and some of the more spooky aspects\
  \ of psychic magic. Next week, we will delve into different <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"\
  ><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> class, so stay tuned.</p> \n    <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br>\
