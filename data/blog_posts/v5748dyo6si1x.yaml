  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Last year, we at Game\
  \ to Grow were featured on Paizo’s blog as part of Autism Awareness Month. Some\
  \ autistic members of our community shared their own experiences learning and growing\
  \ while playing RPGs. This May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and we’re happy\
  \ to be back with more from the frontiers of gaming therapy. </p> \n      <p>In\
  \ the past year, Game to Grow has continued to rise to meet the emerging needs of\
  \ individuals worldwide. We’ve broadened our RPG-based services to serve a wider\
  \ group of individuals and address a new range of challenges. Specifically, we’\
  ve expanded our youth program to serve youth in the foster care system and youth\
  \ in hospitals, and we have new groups specifically for LGBTQ+ youth. We’ve also\
  \ expanded our adult programming to provide RPG groups focused on empathy, empowerment,\
  \ and personal exploration. Our individual counseling program now has even more\
  \ geek-friendly therapists steeped in the language of game lovers to facilitate\
  \ personal growth. Game to Grow’s training program has had over 1,000 professionals\
  \ trained in the Game to Grow Method, multiplying the number of people around the\
  \ world who can continue to grow with games. </p> \n      <p>So how does it work?\
  \ How are RPGs such a powerful tool for insight, growth, and change for so many\
  \ people?</p> \n      <p>When using RPGs as a tool for growth, Game to Grow and\
  \ our trainees leverage some of the built-in benefits of playing RPGs to help players\
  \ gain new insights, build new skills, and develop social confidence. Below are\
  \ <em>some</em> of the benefits you might consider the next time you play. In our\
  \ training program we call these the “Core Capacities.” The next time you play,\
  \ we encourage you to think about each of these as a muscle. The more you work and\
  \ flex the muscle, the more you can build strength! </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \   <br> \n      <p><b>Regulation</b><br> When playing games like Pathfinder, there’\
  s a 5% chance a player will roll a 1 any time they roll their d20. As all players\
  \ know, this can be <em>incredibly frustrating</em>! Because RPGs are so unpredictable,\
  \ they’re wonderful opportunities to build the skill of regulation: the ability\
  \ to handle both unpleasant and pleasant stress. Playing RPGs helps to build the\
  \ ability to stay regulated, even to <em>enjoy</em> the peaks and valleys of triumph\
  \ and disaster.</p> \n      <p><b>Collaboration</b><br> RPGs like Pathfinder are\
  \ games of fellowship. No one character—no matter how meticulously a player has\
  \ created them—is capable of handling every obstacle alone. RPGs remind us that\
  \ we are stronger when we work with others and build on each other’s ideas. This\
  \ is true on and off the RPG table!</p> \n      <p><b>Planning</b><br> When players\
  \ are given an opportunity to solve problems together, they can plot, plan, and\
  \ scheme. This is more than just looking before leaping, this is using logical sequencing\
  \ and critical reasoning to construct plans based on facts and evidence. (Plans,\
  \ of course, never go as planned. See why regulation is such an important skill!?)</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Perspective-Taking</b><br> Though our characters might be, none\
  \ of us are mind-readers. We have to actively work to communicate and understand\
  \ the thoughts, feelings, and desires of others. In RPGs, this is built into the\
  \ game! We are, but also aren’t, our characters. We’re constantly navigating player\
  \ knowledge and character knowledge and communicating about both with our fellow\
  \ players. Communicating clearly about our internal state, and confirming our assumptions\
  \ of others’, is an incredibly valuable skill!</p> \n      <p><b>Pretend Play</b><br>\
  \ Something often overlooked, especially for adults, is the life-enriching magic\
  \ of play. Play is when our imaginations come to life, when we lose track of being\
  \ perfect rule-followers, and when we become fully-engaged agents of change in our\
  \ own lives. Play isn’t just important, it’s essential, and RPGs provide such a\
  \ bounty of opportunities for true play! </p> \n      <p>These Core Capacities are\
  \ just the beginning! To learn more about our methods or to join a group, please\
  \ visit us at <a href=\"http://www.gametogrow.org/\">www.gametogrow.org</a>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>We also always like to ask players themselves: What have you learned\
  \ about yourself through playing RPGs? How have they helped you learn, grow, and\
  \ change? Let us know in the comments!</p> \n      <br> \n     </blockquote> \n\
