  artist: "rolling initiative, of course) took turns choosing until all of the chambers\
    \ were parceled out, then took their best shots. The resulting mishmash of horror\
    \ was then edited, judged highly entertaining, and pronounced ready to be Paizo's\
    \ first GenCon delve. But somewhere in the early stages of the project, an idea\
    \ began to form. Suppose someone had a really good time with the delve, and wanted\
    \ to take it home to their own party? What if we could have an adventure module\
    \ there at the show that incorporated most of the delve, plus a bunch of extra\
    \ material? The decision was made, and I was tapped to give form and structure\
    \ to our cruel meat grinder of a dungeon. It wasn't always easy. A delve, for\
    \ instance, needs only the barest plot—when each party's only playing for a few\
    \ minutes, it's hard to get much roleplaying in. For a writer like me who is,\
    \ admittedly, more of a story fan than an out-and-out brawler, it was an interesting\
    \ challenge. Where in our world, for instance, could adventurers reasonably expect\
    \ to find such a varied an eclectic collection of rooms? The answer, as it turns\
    \ out, is the anarchic squatter's paradise of Kaer Maga, a cliff-top city housed\
    \ inside the walls of an enormous Thassilonian artifact. Possibly the freest of\
    \ Varisia's fiercely independent cities (if the most morally questionable), the\
    \ background material on Kaer Maga remains my favorite part of this module—so\
    \ much so that we return to it in the third installment of the Pathfinder's Journal.\
    \ But more on that next week. Even with a location, however, we still needed a\
    \ story capable of tying fiendish dinosaur-riding goblins to eladrin warriors\
    \ and vampire bladepriests. Once we figured out that Tirana was trying to combine\
    \ the weapons of the Runelords' ancient champions for her own personal gain, it\
    \ seemed to me that the natural setting for such a bold experiment would be in\
    \ a secret, abandoned research facility. Armed with that knowledge, the next step\
    \ was to trim off the rooms that just didn't fit and retool the ones to make them\
    \ work together as a unit. Following that came the writing of the new rooms—because\
    \ you didn't think we'd just repackage the delve, did you? No, if you get a chance\
    \ to go to GenCon and see the massive tables covered with three-dimensional dungeon\
    \ terrain, be sure to keep in mind that all of those rooms amount to about half\
    \ of the actual adventure. For many of the extra chambers, I enjoyed playing up\
    \ the research facility aspect, complete with incinerators, recycling units, turbines\
    \ for proper air circulation, and laboratories with strange new monsters run amuck.\
    \ And, of course, no module set in a city is complete without at least one gang\
    \ turf war. All told, writing D2 was a unique experience, and I hope that those\
    \ of you who read through it have as much fun as I did. Next week I'll be back\
    \ with a bit more information about Kaer Maga. James Sutter Assistant Editor,\
