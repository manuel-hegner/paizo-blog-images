  \ class=\"date\">Wednesday, November 10, 2010</p> \n   <p>As a miniatures fanatic,\
  \ I'm always encouraging other people to try painting. Many people complain they\
  \ don't have enough time, it's hard to paint at home because they have kids or don't\
  \ have space, and so on. For a time, we had a weekly painting group meeting in the\
  \ evening after work, but since Gen Con 2009, the move to the then-new building,\
  \ and due to the frantic pace of publishing increasingly popular books, that fell\
  \ by the wayside. Recently we started up a lunchtime painting get-together, meeting\
  \ every Tuesday from noon to 1 in the upstairs conference room. Why Tuesday? Because\
  \ my <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/exilesOfZirnakaynin\">high-level drow game</a> is\
  \ on Tuesday nights, and this gives me an opportunity to get some last-minute painting\
  \ done for the upcoming game!</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n\

  ></a>\n  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Clockwise from the lower left we have Ross\
  \ (painting some 40K marines), Liz (painting a serpentfolk for the Serpent Skull\
  \ Adventure Path), Crystal (working on a Privateer gun-toting troll), Sara Marie\
  \ (painting her PC for Rob's game), Rob (painting his badger mini an appropriate\
  \ shade of \"<a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5laxi\">Rummy Tum Tugger</a> purple\"\
  ), Andrew (showing his art skills on a Reaper imp), Hyrum's hand (also working on\
  \ some 40K marines), and the back of my head (applying some metallic base coats\
  \ to some deep ones).</p> \n   <p>It's nice to work in a place where painting weird\
  \ monsters is normal. It's also nice to have a regular schedule to get some painting\
  \ done, even if it's just a little bit. Even if you don't work for a game company,\
  \ maybe you can find a time and place to paint. And you might get someone else interested\
  \ in gaming!</p> \n   <p>Sean K Reynolds <br>Developer</p> \n  </blockquote> <!--\
