  \ Marathon: Part 5!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Sunday, August 9, 2015</p> \n  \
  \ <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I just got back\
  \ into the office mid-week from crazy whirlwind of GenCon, and one of my highlights\
  \ was getting to meet the Order of the Amber Die in person at the show. I first\
  \ met the guys outside of the dealer hall on the day the show opened and then they\
  \ sat in the front row of the Pathfinder Adventure Path Q&amp;A panel we had on\
  \ Friday. Later that day, I spent one of my breaks from the booth talking with them\
  \ in a quiet environment outside of the bustle of the convention center. They shared\
  \ some more stories about their Giantslayer project and we talked a bit about what\
  \ they want to do for their next big endeavor. I even got a chance to game with\
  \ Sterling on Saturday night! They are truly enthusiastic about the game and great\
  \ ambassadors of fun.</p> \n    <p>Enough about my stories from last weekend, let's\
  \ get into the meat of this thing. What follows is the fifth report from the Order\
  \ of the Amber Die as they took on <a href=\"/products/btpy9et7\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #95: Anvil of Fire</em></a>. As always, this blog is going to contain\
  \ some spoilers, so proceed with caution if that kind of thing affects you.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Order of the Amber Die is back with the fifth update\
  \ on our ambitious endeavor to complete the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/Giantslayer\"\
  >Giantslayer Adventure Path</a> in just 6 months.</p> \n     <p>Coming off of our\
  \ enormous success in marathon 4, there was a bit of nostalgia knowing that we were\
  \ entering the last third of our journey. With this in mind, we wanted to make sure\
  \ and set the right mood for delving the fire giant stronghold and dormant volcano\
  \ known as Ashpeak. We set up a few lava lamps around our play area and decided\
  \ they would remain our only lights during the nighttime hours of this 75-hour marathon.\
  \ We also tapped two additional members of our Order to play the live-NPC roles\
  \ of Thoon the doppleganger and Jagrin Grath during this adventure, with one flying\
  \ from Maine to NJ for the chance to fight a fire giant king.</p> \n     <p>Strong\
  \ builds with our ACG classes helped us put on a display of high-level power to\
  \ be etched into the annals of Pathfinder lore. Zadim delivered an incredible 316\
  \ points of damage with a full attack. Quinn put up a DC 59 perception check. Oloch\
  \ tripped 4 giants with Gorum's Thorn overall, and managed to dish out 190 points\
  \ of damage in one round. Crowe reached a new high with 143 points of damage in\
  \ a single hit. Should we mention that we were one level underpowered for the adventure?</p>\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Highlights From our Experience With Anvil of Fire</h2>\
  \ \n     <ul>\n      <li>The giants played a sturdy defense and used better tactics\
  \ than we have seen so far. Our foes set ambushes, employed hell hounds to scent\
  \ through invisibility, and grouped up to try and overwhelm us. It didn't matter.\
  \ We carved through more than 60 of the big folk as we pushed into the steaming\
  \ caverns of Ashpeak.</li> \n      <li>We faced our first Gargantuan foe: an extraplanar\
  \ giant known as a gigas, born from the footsteps of titans. The gigas also faced\
  \ our slayer, and it fell like the rest.</li> \n      <li>We kicked so much butt\
  \ in this adventure that we even had several giants cowering from Oloch's Dazzling\
  \ Display and Disheartening Display combined with <i>fear</i> and <i>aura of doom</i>\
  \ spells to escalate their conditions.</li> \n      <li>Our GM gave the Amber Die\
  \ a rest after throwing down 16 natural 20s with it, but we shook the house when\
  \ not long afterwards he tossed a 20-20-20 for the second time in this Adventure\
  \ Path.</li> \n      <li>It's only fair to note that Pathfinder still has ways of\
  \ putting the overconfident party in its place. We found out that even though we\
  \ slay giants very well, we still run from dragons—especially a rookery of them.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Thanks to author Sean K Reynolds, we got to shake hands with a fire\
  \ giant queen as she offered us an ending that we never saw coming: single combat\
  \ against King Tytarian and his retinue—one for one. We held a team meeting at the\
  \ same time that our GM prepared his strategy, and tensions peaked when we found\
  \ out that we would fight the monarch in front of a court that included some of\
  \ Golarion's most infamous giants. Crowe took on the fire giant king himself, and\
  \ Tytarian landed a blow that should have finished the bloodrager—were it not for\
  \ his defy death bloodline ability. With only one round to down the king and secure\
  \ the win, the Shoanti made it happen.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Skirkatla\
  \ the graveknight queen from \"Ice Tomb of the Giant Queen\" made a deadly return\
  \ in the beginning of this marathon. She was accompanied by her most powerful lieutenant,\
  \ a unique svathurim dullahan known as the Decapitant Lord. Kurst Grath tried to\
  \ slow the charge of the undead, but fell at the end of a lance powered by eight\
  \ hooves.</li> \n      <li>As the fight against Skirkatla dragged on, the graveknight\
  \ cornered Zadim and swung down with a full attack that packed more than enough\
  \ damage to avenge her first loss against the party.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <h2>Current\
  \ Situation</h2> \n     <p>The Champions of Trunau proved the stronger team time\
  \ and time again in this adventure, and we are now headed into the finals of this\
  \ AP. Despite the excitement, anxious thoughts of confronting Volstus the Storm\
  \ Tyrant are in the back of everyone's mind. We are still under-level, but our equipment\
  \ has held up well, and we are now in possession of the most powerful artifact discovered\
  \ thus far: the <i>Hammer of Thunderbolts</i>. It's time to write some stories around\
  \ it.</p> \n     <h2>Best Quote From Marathon 5</h2> \n     <p>Louisa (Thoon): <i>\"\
  Do you think it would confuse the giant if I dopplegang into Crowe? I just want\
  \ to dopplegang something!\"</i></p> \n     <h2>More Content</h2> \n     <p>Read\
