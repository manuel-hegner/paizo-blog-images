  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Evey Brett</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: Crimson Flowers</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">\"He's resting,\
  \ although not comfortably,\" Chakori said. She'd taken Anandi into the foyer outside\
  \ Ravi's room, although they left the door cracked open. \"I've done what I can\
  \ for him. The rest he's going to have to do on his own.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi handed\
  \ her another purse. </p> \n    <p>She tucked it away in her pocket. \"Tell me again\
  \ why you're going to such trouble over this one?\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's business.\
  \ Besides, if I'd left him behind, he would have been killed.\" <i>And he still\
  \ might, if the Maurya-Rahm find out what he told me.</i></p> \n    <p>\"Do I sense\
  \ your icy heart melting a little?\"</p> \n    <p>He eyed her, discomfited by her\
  \ bluntness. \"A courtesan doesn't love. You know that.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's\
  \ your own stupid rule. Besides, I never said you had to. It's just...\" She gestured\
  \ to her patient. \"He's pretty. Or he will be, at least.\"</p> \n    <p>\"He's\
  \ a low-caste orphan, raised in filth. It doesn't matter whether he's pretty or\
  \ not. He can't stay here.\" <i>Even if I weren't afraid for his life.</i></p> \n\
  \    <p>\"You're just worried that the Maurya-Rahm will hear you're consorting with\
  \ a pirate's brat, which will keep you on their bad side.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't\
  \ go there.\"</p> \n    <p>She just stared at him. \"You're an intelligent, capable\
  \ man, but you can be so damn blind, sometimes.\"</p> \n    <p>Before Anandi could\
  \ think of a reply, she walked away.</p> \n    <p><i>Damn her. And damn Ravi. Once\
  \ Asa answers my request...</i></p> \n    <p>Although there was no guarantee Asa\
  \ would get his message at all.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗\
  </p> \n    <p>Anandi was sitting at Ravi's bedside when the half-elf woke, none\
  \ too happy to see him.</p> \n    <p>\"Damn you.\" Ravi's expression was wild with\
  \ hatred. \"This ain't what I wanted. You didn't even <i>ask</i>. This is torture.\
  \ The captain was never so cruel.\"</p> \n    <p>\"He left you in that awful little\
  \ cabin to lie in your own filth and then he let his crew treat you like an animal.\
  \ Tell me, did you enjoy being used and ridden like a pony?\"</p> \n    <p>\"He\
  \ didn't... they didn't... Damn you.\" Ravi clenched his jaw, anger mingled with\
  \ grief. </p> \n    <p>\"I plucked you out of hell and set you down in paradise.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Some paradise, keeping me locked up in here. Get me some wine, at\
  \ least.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not until you tell me who paid the captain to kill me.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Ravi laughed. \"How the hell should I know?\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi\
  \ hadn't known anyone so frustrating other than the Maurya-Rahm. \"You told me you\
  \ did.\"</p> \n    <p> A bitter smile twisted Ravi's lips. \"You brought me here\
  \ for nothing, fancy man. Cap kept it a secret.\"</p> \n    <p>The nickname was\
  \ growing irritating. So was Ravi's attitude. \"My name is Anandi. You may address\
  \ me as <i>Master</i> Anandi.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi caught his wrist in a bruising\
  \ grip. \"Master of what?\"</p> \n    <p>Taking a bit of enjoyment in his patient's\
  \ discomfort, he said, \"I'm an instructor of courtesans.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi's\
  \ face went slack. He sank back against the pillows, looking even more wan and exhausted.\
  \ \"I should have known what kind of a fancy man you were when you started feeling\
  \ me up back there in that cave. Most men are rough, but you...\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I'm not the kind that gets a man drunk and drugged in order to sleep with him. Neither\
  \ do I beat him to make myself feel better.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're a self-righteous\
  \ son of a bitch.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And you're an annoying little bastard.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Go to hell.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You first.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi threw a\
  \ pillow at him, but missed. \"I'm the captain's boy. Not yours. Take me home.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"He'll kill you. He tried, remember?\"</p> \n    <p>\"He was after\
  \ you. Not me.\" A second pillow followed the first. This time, it hit Anandi on\
  \ the shoulder. Ravi's laugh was bitter and chilling. \"I know why you brought me.\
  \ You just want the same as everyone else, <i>Master</i> Anandi. I've heard the\
  \ whispers. You only got your position because you used to be—\"</p> \n    <p> \"\
  Shut up.\" Anandi clenched a pillow, barely resisting the temptation to use it to\
  \ smother the insolent youth.</p> \n    <p>Ravi's face tightened into a mask of\
  \ hatred. \"What are you waiting for?\"</p> \n    <p>\"For you to realize I'm not\
  \ your enemy.\" He threw the pillow back at Ravi and stalked toward the door.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>From behind him came the sound of either choked laughter or sobbing.\
  \ Anandi didn't bother to see which it was.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Later that evening, Anandi had his answer from Asa.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"He will not see you, but he bade me give you this.\" The Maurya-Rahm handed\
  \ him an envelope sealed with Asa's mark along with a small, silk-wrapped item.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Anandi waited until she left to open the envelope. The card inside was\
  \ scented with Asa's favorite cologne.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Dearest\
  \ Ari,<br> Your service to Jalmeray has not gone unnoticed. This is but a small\
  \ token of my regard.</i></p> \n     <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><i>A.</i></p>\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Anandi walks the razor's edge between love and politics.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The terse, emotionless message in Asa's hand dashed the last\
  \ of his hopes. Anandi opened the package. Inside the silken wrappings was a wooden\
  \ box containing the dried fragile petals of a white flower, the kind found in the\
  \ gardens near the thakur's palace. The two of them had spent hours there, laughing,\
  \ talking, and making love. Once, Anandi had teasingly plucked a bloom and tucked\
  \ it behind Asa's ear. </p> \n    <p>This, he was sure, was the same flower. He\
  \ dumped the petals into his palm, heartbroken by the gift, and feeling whatever\
  \ love he'd once had harden into an impenetrable ball. Anything he'd once shared\
  \ with Asa was finally, definitely over.</p> \n    <p>He sank down onto his bed,\
  \ suddenly exhausted. The trip had been a death sentence. That was all. Likely Asa\
  \ hadn't even known he was gone.</p> \n    <p>A cramping pain shot through his hand\
  \ and fingers. Anandi cursed and flexed his fingers, which were sluggish and slow\
  \ to respond. Inspecting his hand, he saw that one of the petals had turned crimson\
  \ around the edges. Anandi pushed it aside to see blood welling from a pinprick\
  \ in his palm. <i>How...?</i></p> \n    <p>A sudden, agonizing pain lanced up his\
  \ arm. A moment later, it receded and he drew in a shaky breath. His hand had gone\
  \ numb and frozen in a fist that crushed the fragile petals.</p> \n    <p>Panicked,\
  \ Anandi surged to his feet just as a new cramp flared through his chest, so excruciating\
  \ it took his breath away. Whimpering in pain, he staggered into the hallway toward\
  \ Ravi's room.</p> \n    <p><i>Oh, gods. Irori spare me. Why would Asa...</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>But Anandi knew his former lover too well. Asa would never poison him,\
  \ but the other Maurya-Rahm would. </p> \n    <p>The guards took one look at him\
  \ and paled. \"Help...\" Anandi croaked. One guard caught him as he collapsed. The\
  \ other raced toward the healer's quarters. </p> \n    <p>The cramps came more frequently,\
  \ jabbing at his gut. Numbness spread throughout his body until it was all he could\
  \ do to keep breathing.</p> \n    <p>\"Fancy man?\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi could just\
  \ make out a blurry figure crouched beside him. </p> \n    <p>Ravi took the guard's\
  \ place and slapped Anandi's face, causing it to burn and sting. \"Did you eat something?\
  \ Touch something?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The box...\" It would have been easy to conceal\
  \ a needle.</p> \n    <p>Ravi pried the box from Anandi's hand and used the silken\
  \ wrapping to hold it for inspection. \"Damn.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi couldn't answer.\
  \ He could barely drag air into his uncooperative lungs.</p> \n    <p>Ravi set the\
  \ box aside and laid Anandi flat on his back. \"Breathe, damn it.\" He curled his\
  \ fingers together, one hand atop the other, and placed the heel of his hand in\
  \ the center of Anandi's chest. He pushed down. Hard.</p> \n    <p><i>Oh, hell,\
  \ that hurts.</i></p> \n    <p>Ravi kept up the compressions. \"Don't leave me here\
  \ alone, you bastard. You owe me.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi supposed he did, but it\
  \ was a little late for that, now. Poor Ravi. The Conservatory would throw him into\
  \ the streets if the Maurya-Rahm didn't kill him first.</p> \n    <p>Footsteps pounded\
  \ down the hall. \"What have you done, you filthy devil?\" Chakori's sharp cry cut\
  \ through Anandi's rapidly fading awareness. \"After all he did for you...\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I didn't!\" Ravi protested. \"I ain't the kind to poison a man!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>So what kind are you?</i> Anandi wondered as blackness swallowed him.</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>From the angle of the\
  \ sunlight, it was late morning when Anandi woke. His aching body felt too heavy\
  \ to move.</p> \n    <p>\"Easy,\" Chakori said. She was sitting in a chair next\
  \ to his bed. \"I almost lost you. In fact, I would have, if it weren't for...\"\
  \ She nodded at Ravi, who hovered nearby, looking uncomfortable.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Thanks.\" It wasn't enough, but he was too tired to say more. </p> \n    <p>\"We\
  \ know who did it. We traced her through her operative, and when she was interrogated,\
  \ she panicked and tried to make a run for it. I don't know what kind of pressure\
  \ the Maurya-Rahm who conducted the interrogation put her under, but she confessed\
  \ to forging Asa's note and copying his seal in order to poison you. Seems she'd\
  \ overheard Asa mention how much he missed your company, and given the success you've\
  \ made of yourself at the Conservatory, decided to eliminate you before your influence\
  \ grew any stronger. The Maurya-Rahm—how shall I put it?—have one fewer member in\
  \ their prestigious ranks this morning.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi winced. At least that\
  \ meant Asa still cared about him. \"Leave us,\" he said to Chakori. When she was\
  \ gone, Anandi asked, \"How...?\" </p> \n    <p>Ravi shrugged. \"Cap seen a lot\
  \ of men stuck by a lionfish and taught me what to do.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Why?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jaw set, Ravi said, \"I ain't the kind to let a man die if I can help\
  \ it. Even if it's a man that kidnapped me.\" After a while, he sighed and took\
  \ the chair vacated by Chakori. \"You were right about Cap, you know. I thought...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You thought he loved you.\" <i>Like Asa loved me until he couldn't\
  \ and sent me away to keep me safe.</i></p> \n    <p>Ravi nodded and slumped in\
  \ defeat. \"What happens now? I ain't any use to you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not true.\"\
  \ Anandi gazed at the young half-elf, past the flushed face, seeing once again the\
  \ inner strength and intelligence that had allowed Ravi to survive for so long.\
  \ \"You're my diamond in the rough. Once I get you cut and polished, you'll shine\
  \ like few other men do.\"</p> \n    <p>As he'd hoped, Ravi's eyes glittered with\
  \ desire. \"Why me? Why not some other poor pirate's brat?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'll\
  \ show you.\"</p> \n    <p>He summoned a djinni who procured Ravi a set of silk\
  \ pantaloons, a matching vest, and sandals. Ravi already had a gold hoop in his\
  \ ear, which Anandi left, but he hung a thick gold chain around Ravi's neck. Then\
  \ Anandi sat Ravi on a stool, had the djinni fetch his cosmetics with which he added\
  \ color to Ravi's cheeks and eyes and drew long, intricate designs to highlight\
  \ his features.</p> \n    <p>When he was done, he turned Ravi to face the mirror.\
  \ \"There. That's a man who can have anything in the world that he wants if he knows\
  \ how to get it.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi was silent for a long time as he stared at\
  \ his reflection. \"Like you? Do you have everything you want?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I did, once.\" </p> \n    <p>\"And now?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Now...\" he shrugged. He\
  \ ached for Asa's touch, but it was gone, never to be his again. He took Ravi's\
  \ hand in his. \"Now I have a diamond. The question is, how brightly will you shine?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Brighter than all the stars in the sky,\" Ravi said, and squeezed.</p>\
