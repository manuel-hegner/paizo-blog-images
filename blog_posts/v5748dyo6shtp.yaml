  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello,\
  \ Pathfinders and Starfinders! I wanted to take a moment here to discuss our current\
  \ sanctioning status for both programs. We’ve had a lot of stuff roll out recently,\
  \ and a lot more to come, so I wanted to get it all in one place.</p> \n     <h2>Update\
  \ of Sanctioning Documents</h2> \n     <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shrt?Organized-Play-Update-Increased-Rewards-for\"\
  >we announced a retroactive chance to some sanctioned adventures</a>, and I promised\
  \ we’d be getting sanctioning documents updated shortly thereafter.</p> \n     <p>Well.\
  \ We’ve had…a busy few weeks. So I have not quite done that <em>yet</em>, at least\
  \ not all of them. I am happy to report that the following adventures have updated\
  \ sanctioning documents ready for download:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventures: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering\"\
  ><em>The Slithering</em></a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k1?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari\"\
  ><em>Troubles in Otari</em></a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence\"\
  ><em>Malevolence</em></a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023dx?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em></a></li> \n      <li>Pathfinder Adventure Paths:\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/extinctioncurse\"\
  ><em>Extinction Curse</em></a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationvaults\"\
  ><em>Abomination Vaults</em></a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsoftherubyphoenix\"\
  ><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em></a></li> \n      <li>Starfinder Adventures:\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01wy7?Starfinder-Beginner-Box\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Beginner Box</em></a></li> \n      <li>Starfinder Adventure Paths: <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationark\"><em>The\
  \ Devastation Ark</em></a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyfreeordie\"\
  ><em>Fly Free or Die</em></a></li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>The rest of the files\
  \ are waiting on the art team to have time to make some changes I need from them.\
  \ These updates aren’t as simple as “swap out text;” in most cases, we need to insert\
  \ additional pages or rearrange what’s already there, which is a task that requires\
  \ art’s expertise. So, we’ll keep plugging away at them as the art team has time\
  \ between making the beautiful books we love. In the meantime, the blog post linked\
  \ above takes precedence regarding the total rewards to be given out.</p> \n   \
  \  <h2>New Boons</h2> \n     <p>Eagle-eyed players (and those who I pointed it out\
  \ to) will notice that along with the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic\"\
  ><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a> sanctioning, some new boons were added to the Boon\
  \ Store for uncommon spells and archetypes, as well as some uncommon items from\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide\"\
  ><em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em></a>. If you didn’t notice, well, that’s why I’\
  m pointing them out now!</p> \n     <p>Going forward, it is my hope that we’ll be\
  \ able to release these boons at the same time as the books are sanctioned. I don’\
  t want to promise anything; sometimes we have a lot going on and it’s all we can\
  \ do to get the book out close to street date [<em>eyes the upcoming October Monster\
  \ nervously</em>], but it’s a goal of mine.</p> \n     <h2>Coming Soon to a Character\
  \ Options Page Near You</h2> \n     <p>For my fellow Starfinders, the newest rulebook,\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029v8?Starfinder-Tech-Revolution\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Tech Revolution</em></a>, has already been sanctioned and is now available on\
  \ the Character Options page! Head over there and revolutionize your tech already,\
  \ I don’t have a lot of other news for you yet. Next on the list will be <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq027rz?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic\"><em>Galactic Magic</em></a>,\
  \ more on that as we approach street date.</p> \n     <p>For the Pathfinders among\
  \ us, obviously October is a double-punch of books, with the twin threats of <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029xo?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em></a>. Let me set expectations up front: I do not\
  \ anticipate that both books will be ready on October 13 when they release.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We’re only human, our volunteer review team is also only human, and\
  \ we gave them a lot to do all at once. Our first priority is to get <em>Guns &amp;\
  \ Gears</em> sanctioned so you can start slinging guns and inventing gadgets. I\
  \ will say that while both of the classes are uncommon, all Pathfinders will have\
  \ access to them. After that, we’ll be aiming to get LOGB out the door as soon as\
  \ we can, and we’ll keep you updated on its progress. Luckily, after this we get\
  \ to rel—oh, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027u2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em></a>? <em>And</em> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021bz?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens\"\
  >the Absalom book</a>? Both in December, you say? Okay, well. We’ll do our best\
  \ on those! More on that as we have it.</p> \n     <p>Finally, Free RPG Day arrives\
  \ on October 16th! The sanctioning documents for both of this year’s adventures,\
  \ <em>Threshold of Knowledge</em> and <em>The Starfinder Four vs. the Hardlight\
  \ Harlequin</em> are in their final stages, and we fully intend to have them up\
  \ before the event. Keep in mind that while these adventures can be run on the 16th\
  \ in conjunction with a participating local game store, they will not be available\
  \ to the general public until one month later. If our sanctioning schedule slips\
  \ on this, we’ll be sure to inform you all.</p> \n     <p>I think that’s all the\
  \ news I had to share! Before I go, I just want to thank everybody who makes the\
  \ sanctioning possible: our volunteer Additional Resources team, who review the\
  \ rulebooks and find all the ways to break our lovely game; Linda and the OP developers\
  \ who review the AR feedback with me; and our art team who put together the PDF\
  \ sanctioning documents for adventures, and who are really the unsung heroes of\
  \ the process. I know I’m out here talking about the process most of the time, but\
  \ it’s really a team effort, there’s no way I could do it on my own.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Alright, that’s quite enough from me. Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate!\
  \ And go build a weird new character!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
