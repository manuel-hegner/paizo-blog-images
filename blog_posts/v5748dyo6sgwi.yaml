  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Our first stop is at Absalom, home of the Starstone Cathedral\
  \ and a little group known as the Pathfinder Society. Among the various tools of\
  \ the trade for Pathfinders are their iconic <i>wayfinders</i>. Before the formulaic\
  \ <i>wayfinders</i> of the modern day became commonplace, the Society created each\
  \ <i>wayfinder</i> individually and some of these older <i>wayfinders</i> are still\
  \ found here and there. Along with the <i>archaic wayfinder</i>, visitors to Absalom\
  \ may take one of the backgrounds available, like the Pathfinder Hopeful background,\
  \ and the Pathfinder agent archetype! </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\
  \ href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-archaicwayfinder.png\"\

  \ alt=\"Archaic Wayfinder, Item 2. Uncommon, Evocation, Magical. An archaic wayfinder\
  \ functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cangtrip cast into it.\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>From Absalom, we head to the northeastern reaches\
  \ of Avistan and arrive in the Broken Lands. The area is known for the countless\
  \ independent states of the River Kingdoms, the fractured politics of Brevoy, the\
  \ mystifying technology of Numeria, the glory of Razmiran, the blighted Sarkoris\
  \ Scar region, and the crusaders of Mendev who now have a chance to rest with a\
  \ closed Worldwound. Characters from the Broken Lands might take the Sarkorian Reclaimer\
  \ background if they wish to reclaim the Sarkorian homeland from the demons that\
  \ wander there or even learn the storied and ancient tradition of the Aldori swordlords\
  \ by taking the Aldori duelist archetype. Of course, how can you be a swordlord\
  \ without the Aldori dueling sword?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ alt=\"Aldori Dueling Sword, Item 1. Uncommon, Finesse, Versatile(P). An Aldori\
  \ dueling sword is a slim, single-bladed dueling sword with a slight curve and a\
  \ sharp, reinforced point.\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Next, let’s head southeast\
  \ to the Eye of Dread, a land marked by recent devastation and war. The rise of\
  \ the Whispering Tyrant and his armies meant bad news for the Hold of Belkzen, Lastwall,\
  \ and Ustalav, while the rise of the Ironfang Legion caused disruptions among Molthune\
  \ and Nirmathas, culminating in the founding of the hobgoblin nation of Oprak. While\
  \ characters from the Broken Lands might choose to take the fight to ol’ Tar-Baphon\
  \ by taking the Lastwall sentry archetype, you might be more inclined to play a\
  \ hobgoblin from Oprak (using the hobgoblin ancestry from the upcoming <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide\">Lost\
  \ Omens Character Guide</a>). For you hobgoblin players out there, consider taking\
  \ the Onyx Trader background.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ with many, but you are one of the lucky few to be permitted into the heart of\
  \ the nation.\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Now we head further south to the wonders\
  \ of the Golden Road. This is land full of cosmopolitan cities with bustling marketplaces\
  \ and ancient ruins holding lost secrets and treasures. From the countless tombs\
  \ of Osirion, to the Night Stalls of Katapesh, to the miraculous sun orchid elixir\
  \ of Thuvia, to the great caravan cities of Qadira, or the mechanical innovations\
  \ of Rahadoum, there is adventure to be found.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>The Golden Road features a number of exciting new rules.\
  \ If your character is looking to sneak off with the relics from the region, you\
  \ might consider taking the Black Market Smuggler background. If you want to be\
  \ tough as nails, you might take the living monolith archetype. PCs that want to\
  \ live forever could consider trying to claim the sun orchid elixir for themselves\
  \ or just enjoy a bit of pesh. Rahadoumi characters can even consider taking the\
  \ Godless Healing feat to improve the power of science and medicine on their own\
  \ bodies.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-godlesshealing.png\"\

  \ your Wounds or use Battle Medicine on you.\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>We then\
  \ set sail from Rahadoum out to the open seas. The High Seas region is home such\
  \ areas like the Shackles, Hermea, and Medoigalti Island, but not all locales here\
  \ are at sea level. In fact, you can visit underwater settlements like the aquatic\
  \ elf city of Irim or the algolthu settlement of Gholinom. PCs looking to visit\
  \ these sites might do well to get a set of swim fins to help their swimming or\
  \ a jellyfish lamp to help navigating the dark depths of the ocean. Such PCs will\
  \ probably take the Undersea Enthusiast background. PCs that prefer to stay on dry\
  \ land could choose to set out to Mediogalti Island and join up with the Red Mantis\
  \ Assassins, taking their archetype in the process. The archetype grants proficiency\
  \ with sawtooth sabres and at later levels even allows you to transform into a mantis\
  \ yourself!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-mantisform.png\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>If we travel into the Inner Sea and head east, we\
  \ eventually reach the Impossible Lands. So named because of the impressive and\
  \ awe-inspiring nations it bears, the Impossible Lands region is home to Geb, Nex,\
  \ the Mana Wastes, and Jalmeray.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ a number of impressive options to choose. You could choose to join one of the\
  \ Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray, taking the student of perfection archetype in\
  \ the process. The archetype features an option for each of the Houses of Perfection’\
  s four monasteries and is a great pick for anyone who is an expert in unarmed attacks.\
  \ You could instead seek the secrets of the archmagi Nex by taking the Eye of the\
  \ Arclords feat or Nexian Mystic background.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ we head inland, we reach the Mwangi Expanse. This vast jungle is home to the people\
  \ of Vidrian, the nation formerly known as Sargava, the flooded ruins of the Sodden\
  \ Lands, and the dozens of city-states that dot the Mwangi Expanse. Characters from\
  \ the Mwangi might be lizardfolk (again, see the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i>!)\
  \ or one of the Mwangi orcs that takes the Blessed Tattoo feat to defend themselves\
  \ from the influence of the demon lord Angazhan. Of particular note is the Magaambya,\
  \ the oldest arcane academy in the Inner Sea region, located in Nantambu. Characters\
  \ who are members of the Magaambya might take the magic warrior archetype or the\
  \ Magaambya Academic background.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ \n     <p>Returning to Avistan, we land in the region known as Old Cheliax. This\
  \ region is home to one of the oldest nations on Avistan as well as one of the oldest.\
  \ Visitors to Old Cheliax can go see Isger, Nidal, Ravounel, and, of course, Cheliax.</p>\

  >Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Characters from the\
  \ Old Cheliax region have plenty of backgrounds to choose from, such the Thrune\
  \ Loyalist background or the Chelish Rebel background for those who aren’t as happy\
  \ with Queen Abrograil and her rule. The region’s archetype is the Hellknight armiger,\
  \ which represents a Hellknight in training. Characters can take the archetype as\
  \ early as second level. A fun fact about the archetype is that it is designed to\
  \ dovetail into the full-fledged Hellknight archetype that is premiering later in\
  \ the Lost Omens Character Guide.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ training teaches you to terrorize others into compliance, but you also study the\
  \ stricture and hierarchy of Hell.\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>As we continue\
  \ north, we reach the Saga Lands. The Saga Lands region is one of the most storied\
  \ areas in Pathfinder’s history and is home to the newly-founded New Thassilon,\
  \ the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, Irrisen, and Varisia.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-eurithina.jpg\"\

  >Illustration by Ainur Salimova</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>With so many lands steeped\
  \ in magic, it’s no surprise that the region offers a number of magical options.\
  \ Saga Lands characters could be a time-displaced character from New Thassilon with\
  \ the Thassilonian Traveler background. Those with ties to the witches of Irrisen\
  \ might look forward to the return of the <i>snowball</i> spell. Of course, you\
  \ might not have innate magic, especially if you have the Mammoth Speaker background.\
  \ No worries, my magicless friends! You can now take the runescarred archetype,\
  \ which requires no spellcasting prowess whatsoever, and cover yourself in magical\
  \ runes to gain new magical abilities!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ runes on your body grant you several magical abilities.\"></a> \n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>Finally, as we wrap up our mechanical tour, we arrive in the Shining Kingdoms.\
  \ It doesn’t get more traditional high fantasy than this region! With areas like\
  \ Druma, Kyonin, the Five Kings Mountains, Galt, Andoran, and Taldor, the Shining\
  \ Kingdoms are perfect for games starring knights in shining armor. Characters from\
  \ the region could be from the wilds of the Verduran Forest with the Wildwood Local\
  \ background or be a more sophisticated, city type with the Taldan Schemer background.\
  \ Fans of intrigue might consider taking the Lion Blade archetype. Not all of the\
  \ content here is fun and exciting for players, though, as is evident with the entry\
  \ for Galt’s <i>final blades</i>. If you’re the type who wants to be a hero for\
  \ the people, you could even consider joining the Eagle Knights of Andoran!</p>\

  \ Inner Sea Region and we just scratched the surface on what’s available in the\
  \ <i>Lost Omens World Guide</i>! If this taste of dozens of backgrounds, ten archetypes,\
  \ and so much more was enticing, consider picking up the book! I’m excited for all\
  \ players, be they Pathfinder veterans or newcomers to Second Edition, to check\
  \ out this book. Golarion is an exciting for games, so go and tell some great stories!</p>\
