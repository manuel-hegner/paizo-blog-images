  \ adventure of the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path, <em>To Bloom Below the Web</em>,\
  \ arrives with hints of spring and hope in the new year! Of course, as I’ve mentioned\
  \ in previous blogs, this Adventure Path is filled with more surprises and plot\
  \ twists than most, and this final adventure is one that’s especially tricky to\
  \ talk about without spoiling those developments. Folks have been great about helping\
  \ to keep the campaign’s twists secret as well, and though I expect that we’ll talk\
  \ more openly about the narrative stunts and risks we pulled with this Adventure\
  \ Path sometime in the future, that time isn’t quite here yet.</p>\n      <p>Of\
  \ course, we wouldn’t have been able to pull this off at all without having such\
  \ an amazing group of authors working on the adventures and their support articles.\
  \ So instead of dancing around spoilers and trying to figure out what to say about\
  \ this final adventure without revealing too much, let’s hear from two of the authors\
  \ for this book!</p>\n      <p>(A final note about the art I’m featuring in this\
  \ blog post—none of it is technically from the adventure itself, but from support\
  \ articles, so there shouldn’t be anything in these images that will particularly\
  \ spoil things for anyone who’s eager to discover Season of Ghosts’ surprises as\
  \ players!)</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\

  \      <br>\n      <h3>Jeremy Blum</h3>\n      <p>I'm Jeremy Blum and my articles\
  \ in Season of Ghosts volumes 3 and 4 will be my first published Paizo projects!\
  \ For volume 3, I got the chance to flesh out nindorus based on James Jacobs' initial\
  \ notes, and detailing the intricacies of a delicious new fiend variant was a blast.\
  \ As for volume 4, let's just say that I was able to write up character options\
  \ inspired by aspects of Buddhism. I look forward to seeing how players use them!</p>\n\
  \      <p>Aside from Season of Ghosts, I've penned portions of the upcoming <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens Tian Xia</em><em>World Guide</em> and <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>as\
  \ well as <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>. I've also designed Pathfinder conversions\
  \ for the Korean-themed Undying Corruption setting by Nine Heavens Press, contributed\
  \ lore to the Chinese-inspired Banner Clans faction in Three Sails Studios’ miniatures\
  \ wargame <em>Margrave: The Marcher Lords</em>, and most recently worked on several\
  \ Renegade Games Studios projects that are still under wraps. Check out my portfolio\
  \ and feel free to follow me (I use the name Pixel Grotto on Twitter and Bluesky)\
  \ to share stories of how nindorus have made your life miserable.</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h3>Liane Merciel</h3>\n      <p>I was both super excited and nervous to\
  \ be asked to contribute to this Adventure Path.</p>\n      <p>Like a lot of you,\
  \ I have been a Forever GM for a... well, forever, basically. I think the last time\
  \ I got to be a PC was, uh, 2006 maybe? No, wait, I did get to play Fumbus for 20\
  \ glorious minutes at PaizoCon 2019. So yeah, that’s the last time I was a player\
  \ in a tabletop campaign.</p>\n      <p>Possibly because of this (vengeful? Me?\
  \ Never!), my home campaigns are skewed heavily toward horror in all its many and\
  \ glorious forms. If my players aren’t white-knuckling it and/or grossed out at\
  \ least once per story arc, I believe that I have failed.</p>\n      <p>Trying to\
  \ pull off a horror game as a published adventure, though, was a totally different\
  \ kind of challenge. My GM’ing style is reactive: I see how the players respond\
  \ to NPC X or Encounter Y and tailor the interaction accordingly. Writing an adventure\
  \ for players I’ve never met, at tables I’ll never see, using a set of rules that\
  \ was in flux at the time, was probably more terrifying than anything I’ve ever\
  \ inflicted on my PCs.</p>\n      <p>But I look forward to putting them through\
  \ the game later, just to make sure.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  \ we’re excited to announce we’ve entered into an official partnership! Beginning\
  \ with Season of Ghosts, Michael and his team of award-winning composers will be\
  \ composing all-new original soundtracks uniquely tailored to accompany selected\
  \ past and future Pathfinder Adventure Paths!</p>\n      <p>We’ll have plenty more\
  \ to say in the weeks to come, but for the time being, we’ll leave it at this: players\
  \ who like to incorporate music into their games can expect a lot of exciting auditory\
  \ surprises in store!</p>\n      <p>Actually, you know what? That’s not fair. We\
  \ can’t just tell you about this amazing music and not give you a sample to whet\
