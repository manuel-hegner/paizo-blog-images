  \ 6</h2> \n      <p>The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si8h?Starfinder-Society-Year-6-Announcement\"\
  >Year of Fortune’s Fall</a> is upon us, Starfinders! This month, Jessica announced\
  \ the theme for Starfinder Society Year 6, launching at PaizoCon Online at the end\
  \ of May. When a mysterious and powerful criminal syndicate, dubbed the Organization,\
  \ enacts a bloody attack within the Pact Worlds, First Seeker Ehu Hadif vows to\
  \ bring an end to their predations. Yet, this attack is only the opening salvo in\
  \ a plot destined to doom millions.</p> \n      <p>It’s up to you to unravel the\
  \ plans of the Organization and bring the group’s leaders to justice! This Organization\
  \ has been waiting in the wings for years, but now they must be stopped before it’\
  s too late!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Replays</h2> \n      <p>One of the most-requested\
  \ features in my time here has been the ability to replay scenarios. Whether it’\
  s because you have another character who would fit perfectly into an adventure or\
  \ just because you want to help make a table fire, this has been something players\
  \ and GMs have asked for constantly. I’m delighted to tell you that, thanks to the\
  \ tireless work of our tech team, this is now possible!</p> \n      <p>If you check\
  \ your Organized Play account, you will see that you now have Replays available\
  \ for Pathfinder Society (both first and second edition) as well as Starfinder Society.\
  \ Here are the rules governing these Replays, which will be added to the Guide to\
  \ Organized Play during the next update:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>All players\
  \ (current and future) start with 2 replays. Current players may have obtained additional\
  \ replays as a thanks for your patience while we got the system up and running.\
  \ [1]</li> \n       <li>GMs will earn one replay for each GM rank they achieve.\
  \ Additionally, on January 1st of each year we will run a report to grant GMs one\
  \ replay per GM rank for each active system. [2]</li> \n       <li>Additional replays\
  \ for PFS2 and SFS can be purchased at a rate of <b>40 Achievement Points per replay</b>.\
  \ This cost does not increase over time. Players must purchase a replay prior to\
  \ completion and reporting of the scenario they are replaying.</li> \n       <li>Players\
  \ must indicate to their GM when they are using a replay. When reporting a replayed\
  \ scenario, the GM should check the “Consume Replay” box next to the character’\
  s information so they earn full credit for the scenario.</li> \n       <li>Players\
  \ who replay a scenario earn full rewards as a result of their playthrough. They\
  \ get access to any boons and items on their Chronicle Sheet, as well as gold, XP\
  \ and Reputation, all subject to the outcome of the scenario. </li> \n       <li>Replays\
  \ are not used when GMing a scenario; GMs will continue to earn table credit and\
  \ AcP for GMing a non-repeatable scenario.</li> \n       <li>Replays can be used\
  \ on sanctioned content that is scenario-length or shorter, such as One-Shots, non-repeatable\
  \ Quests and Free RPG Day adventures. Replays cannot be used on long-form content\
  \ such as standalone modules or Adventure Path volumes.</li> \n      </ul> \n  \
  \    <blockquote>\n       <p>[1] The formula for additional replays is 2 replays\
  \ for every 50 games played or GMed in the program prior to February 18, 2023.<br>\
  \ [2] This functionality does not exist yet, tech is currently assessing the feasibility\
  \ of doing so, but I'm confident in our/their abilities. If it is infeasible to\
  \ do so automatically in a short timeframe I will investigate manual solutions.</p>\n\
  \      </blockquote> \n      <p>As a reminder, per the rules in the Guide to Organized\
  \ Play, players <em>mus</em>t inform their GMs when they are replaying a scenario,\
  \ whether it’s because they are using a Replay or because it is a Repeatable scenario\
  \ they have played before. Players replaying a scenario should not use metagame\
  \ knowledge to ruin the experience for first-time players.</p> \n      <p>GMs are\
  \ explicitly permitted to limit signups to their tables based on non-discriminatory\
  \ criteria, such as limiting a run of a scenario to first-time players if they prefer.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>We’re also aware of some minor issues with reduced Achievement Points\
  \ or table credit that occurred as a result of this code update. We’re digging into\
  \ the exact causes but hope to have fixes rolled out very soon. In the meantime,\
  \ if you have any questions about incorrect counts of any points, including Replays,\
  \ don’t hesitate to email orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com. Thank you for your patience\
  \ as we made these technical updates, and enjoy the new Replays!</p> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <h2>Starfinder Errata Updates</h2> \n      <p>Last month, the Starfinder\
  \ team announced <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si8j?Starfinder-FAQ-and-Errata-Update\"\
  >a host of new errata and updates</a> to the core Starfinder rules. Any rule changes\
  \ like this are always considered to apply immediately to Starfinder Society play,\
  \ so these changes are now in effect at our tables.</p> \n      <p>Additionally,\
  \ some of these changes address the initial reasons we did not allow certain character\
  \ options for play in Starfinder Society. We’re pleased to announce that the following\
  \ options are now legal in Starfinder Society play:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><em>Starfinder\
  \ Armory</em>: all garottes and vibrogarottes</li> \n       <li><em>Starfinder Pact\
  \ Worlds</em>: mature xenolash</li> \n       <li><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em>:\
  \ thasphalt blaster</li> \n       <li><em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em>:\
  \ Devastating Throw, Draconic Shot, Hurl Ally, ink gland augmentation, linnormling\
  \ creature companion</li> \n       <li><em>Horizons of the Vast</em> Adventure Path:\
  \ Zeitgeist mystic connection</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Starfinder Society Character Options page</a> has been updated to reflect these\
  \ changes, as well as to remove some additional clarifications that are now part\
  \ of the core rules.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n      <p>Last\
  \ week, with the release of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eav?Pathfinder-Treasure-Vault\"\
  ><em>Treasure Vault</em></a>, we sanctioned the options for Pathfinder Society play!\
  \ Delve into the vaults and discover your new favorite items! Sanctioning is posted\
  \ on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Character Options page</a>as usual, and boons are available in the Boon\
  \ Store.</p> \n      <p>This month, we’ll be taking a look at <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Firebrands\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: Firebrand</em></a><em><u>s</u></em> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy2?Starfinder-Adventure-Drift-Crisis-Case-Files\"\
  ><em>Drift Crisis Case Files</em></a> for Starfinder, with the goal to get sanctioning\
  \ for both ready for street date.&nbsp; After that, while we prepare for <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02e4y/discuss?Starfinder-Ports-of-Call\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Ports of Call</em></a> in May, we’ll be working on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftHackers\"\
  ><em>Drift Hackers</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/gatewalkers\"\
  ><em>Gatewalkers</em></a> Adventure Paths.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2>\
  \ \n      <h3>GM Ranks</h3> \n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving\
  \ a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the\
  \ 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios\
  \ and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n      <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th\
  \ Star for Pathfinder Society (first edition).</p> \n      <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>:\

  \ enjoy revisiting some favorite scenarios!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
