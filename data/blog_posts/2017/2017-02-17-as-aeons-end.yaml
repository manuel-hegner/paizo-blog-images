               <p>This month the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> wraps up, and by the time this blog goes live some subscribers will have already dug their claws into the adventure while others have to wait for stores to put them on the shelves next Wednesday.</p>
               <p itemprop="description">Over the course of this Adventure Path, readers have seen how subtle corruptions can boil over into dangerous territory, leaving those that witness them to gestate further horrors in their own minds that can threated the world at large. Within this Adventure Path, we got a look at the Great Old Ones and Elder Gods that make up the Elder Mythos. We explored Hastur's cult and had a glimpse into what might happen if that Great Old One was to rise as an Outer Gods. We got to look deeper into the vile evil of the Necronomicon, and explored the strange world of the Dreamlands. We ventured to forgotten locations in Golarion and stepped beyond the gap between worlds to set foot on lost Carcosa. In the Adventure Path bestiary, we got to show you new statistics for a Great Old One in each installment, as well as a double handful of other Mythos creatures throughout. It's been a strange journey to say the least.</p>
               <p>I'm terrible at picking favorites, be it a favorite color, favorite song, favorite food, whatever. However, since I had so many great writers on this Adventure Path, I felt the need to pick my favorite thing that they created in each of the six adventures. Like always, it's difficult picking my favorite things that I liked about each one, so in some cases I just went with my gut when picking from my lengthy lists. Here goes!</p>

               <h2>The Sounds of Madness</h2>
               <p>Today we're also excited to announce that our partners at <a href="/companies/syrinscape">Syrinscape</a> have released the first Strange Aeons SoundPack! Ben has, yet again, worked his magic on bringing <a href="/products/btpy9r6p?Syrinscape-Strange-Aeons-1-In-Search-of-Sanity-SoundPack">"In Search of Sanity"</a> alive in all of its delightfully creepy beauty. After listening to it at my desk, I nabbed Wes so he could get a chance to hear the demented sounds of his adventure. This SoundSet really captures the fear and uncertainty of trying to survive an asylum that has descended into monstrous chaos. I loved hearing the sounds for the argus wall, and the encounter with what Debis Lieklan has become is especially unnerving. Listening to this also made me realize that I need to put more dialog in adventures, as it was great hearing the NPCs in this adventure come to life.</p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>The first volume in the new Strange Aeons Adventure Path, "In Search of Sanity", is a fantastically intense and ghastly adventure needing equally fantastic and horrible sounds. You can get a peek at the process behind how the Syrinscape team worked their magic to bring this adventure to spine tinglingly disturbing 3D life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSSh9w0Ge7I" target="_blank">on our YouTube channel</a>. (<em>Who would have thought you could voice a Nightgaunt with a fur seal?</em>)</p>
                <p>With the <a href="/products/btpy9r6p?Syrinscape-Strange-Aeons-1-In-Search-of-Sanity-SoundPack"><em>In Search of Sanity SoundPack</em></a> you'll be able to carefully and finely tune your player's discomfort. Subtly ramping up or down from one so-called "Tension Level" is simply a matter of touching a single button. Your players probably won't even notice just how intensely immersed and involved they've been in the adventure session. Not until you stop Syrinscape to take a break and the mood weirdly drains from the room will they know just how you've been masterfully you've been controlling the ebb and flow of this horror adventure with a few subtle mostly subliminal tones.</p>

               <h2>Crossing the Streams</h2>
               <p>For those of you who want more Call of Cthulhu chocolate in their Pathfinder peanut butter (or vice versa—it's your metaphor to manipulate as needed), James Jacobs worked up a clever system in the Continuing the Campaign article to merge your Strange Aeons characters with investigators working against the sinister machinations of the Mythos in this final Strange Aeons Adventure Path volume, <a href="/products/btpy9qcm?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-114-Black-Stars-Beckon"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #114: Black Stars Beckon</em></a>.</p>
               <p>When using this system, at the climax of the Adventure Path, the PCs don't return to Golarion, but instead a magical vortex opens in Carcosa that blasts their consciousness out to the stars where they arrive in the minds of humans on a planet with a strong connection to Carcosa—Earth.</p>
               <p>This provides an option to play adventures with the <a href="/store/byCompany/c/chaosium/byProductType/roleplayingGames/callOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game</a> where the investigators have the spirit essences of the characters the players controlled throughout the Strange Aeons Adventure Path inhabiting their minds on Earth. These spirit essences want to return to Golarion, but can't make the transition until they achieve some goals on Earth such as preventing the rise of eldritch forces and fighting against Mythos influence. With enough successes, the characters' spirit essences are freed from the human investigators and can safely return to their selves on Golarion.</p>
               <p>This is an interesting approach to merging two different games and campaigns, and I'm interested in seeing how folks use it.</p>
               <p>This month's Pathfinder Adventure Path closes out the Strange Aeons Adventure Path and I hope that you've enjoyed the weird ride as much as we've enjoyed bringing to you. Stay tuned to this blog for deeper looks into the Adventure Path as we bring you more reports from the <a href="/paizo/blog/tags/orderOfTheAmberDie">Order of the Amber Die</a> as they run marathon sessions of the remaining adventures in this campaign. You're not getting this Adventure Path out of your head that easy.</p>
