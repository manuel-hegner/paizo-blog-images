  \ As Halloween and the Remaster approaches, one question burns in our minds: who’\
  s going to torch all these undead while simultaneously healing the entire party?\
  \ As you can probably guess, that’s still going to be the party’s cleric, but let’\
  s dive into some changes.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ width=\"400px\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"Pathfinder 2e iconic cleric, Kyra\"\
  ></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <p>The cleric\
  \ remains defined by their god, so before we get into the cleric, we should talk\
  \ about the Remaster’s changes to deities and the cosmos. While the Remaster sees\
  \ the removal of the nine alignments, edicts and anathemas still provide descriptions\
  \ of a god’s desires and prohibitions to guide their followers’ behavior at a much\
  \ finer level than alignment. But there’s still an endless struggle over the souls\
  \ of the planes. The new system of divine sanctification (whether holy or unholy)\
  \ represents a dedication to join that fight. Some gods now allow for sanctification—\
  even when serving a goddess like Sarenrae who rose through the angelic ranks, joining\
  \ her in the fight is ultimately a personal choice—where some gods now require that\
  \ their clerics swear allegiance actively, like Asmodeus and Iomedae.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Alignment damage used to be a major tool here, but it sometimes got in the\
  \ way of the cleric’s story. A cleric of Lamashtu might have dealt evil damage to\
  \ scatter those standing up against the Mother of Monsters, but that often didn’\
  t reflect the god’s will. Some gods were neutral, and all gods had enemies who opposed\
  \ to their beliefs but weren’t of an opposite alignment. The Remaster’s new spirit\
  \ damage type lets gods’ wrath manifest much more broadly, harming anything with\
  \ a spirit, down to oozes that need to be scoured away. Clerics who undergo divine\
  \ sanctification can infuse many of their spiritual abilities with holy or unholy\
  \ power, so a <em>divine lance </em>cast by a holy character will still damage almost\
  \ anyone, but it will also trigger the weaknesses of demons and devils. On the flip\
  \ side of the coin, <em>divine wrath </em>excludes the allies who are helping a\
  \ cleric do their god’s work, even if the alliance is a little peculiar.</p>\n \
  \     <p>Beyond these changes, we also took the opportunity to smooth out some rough\
  \ edges. All clerics will see their divine font simply give them a number of bonus\
  \ <em>heal</em> (or <em>harm</em>) spells regardless of their Charisma score, giving\
  \ clerics a little more flexibility in how they allocate their attributes. The warpriest\
  \ got improved weapon proficiencies where it could, raising martial weapons to expert\
  \ at 7th level and their deity’s favored weapon to master at 19th. Along with Focus\
  \ Point recovery becoming a bit easier for everyone in the Remaster, quite a few\
  \ domain spells were improved or replaced, like <em>pulse of civilization </em>now\
  \ giving wide access to the lore of nearby cities rather than one public fact and\
  \ <em>ignite ambition </em>working as a reaction that the target notices only on\
  \ a critical success.</p>\n      <p>A lot of the remastered classes have gotten\
  \ a few new feats to help tell their stories better. Even with its changes, the\
  \ cleric didn’t get left out on this front. As a powerful cleric, your god might\
  \ protect you so dearly that they punish those who harm you, or you might reinforce\
  \ your shield with the strength of your divine font. But there are also smaller\
  \ miracles, like blessing the area around you to heal your allies out of combat\
  \ or presenting your religious symbol to protect against the world’s varied hardships.</p>\n\
  \      <blockquote>\n       <p><b>Raise Symbol [one-action] — Feat 4</b></p>\n \
  \      <p><b>Cleric</b><br><b>Requirements</b> You are wielding a religious symbol.</p>\n\
  \       <p>You present your religious symbol emphatically. You gain a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus to saving throws until the start of your next turn. While it’s raised, if\
  \ you roll a success at a saving throw against a vitality or void effect, you get\
  \ a critical success instead.</p>\n       <p>If the religious symbol you’re raising\
  \ is a shield, such as with Emblazon Armaments, you gain the effects of Raise a\
  \ Shield when you use this action and the effects of this action when you Raise\
  \ a Shield.</p>\n       <br>\n       <p><b>Sacred Ground — Feat 4</b></p>\n    \
  \   <p><b>Cleric, Consecration, Divine, Exploration</b><br><b>Prerequisites</b>\
  \ harmful font or healing font<br><b>Frequency</b> once per 10 minutes</p>\n   \
  \    <p>You pray continuously for 1 minute to call a subtle shadow of your deity’\
  s realm over a 30-foot burst centered on you. It lasts for 10 minutes, and a creature\
  \ that remains in the area for the entire 10 minutes regains Hit Points equal to\
  \ your level.</p>\n       <p>If you have a healing font, this activity has the healing\
  \ and vitality traits and heals living creatures. If you have a harmful font, this\
  \ activity has the healing and void traits and heals undead creatures (or other\
  \ creatures with void healing). Clerics with Versatile Font can choose either or\
  \ both. It can’t damage creatures in any case.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>Even\
  \ my personal favorite cleric feat, Channeled Succor, spent some time in the fires\
  \ of the Remaster to rise again as Restorative Channel, which interacts with the\
  \ new, broader curative spells like <em>cleanse affliction </em>and <em>clear mind</em>.\
  \ I’m stoked to have a new toolbox to channel all my new healing goodies. Especially\
  \ with those spells all still helping when the counteract check doesn’t quite come\
  \ through, it’s a good time to be freeing your friends from vexing conditions.</p>\n\
  \      <p>I hope you enjoy all these new options next month when <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eoj?Pathfinder-Player-Core\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Core</em></a> is released. In the meantime, may your injured\
  \ party be surrounded by a horde of low-level undead.</p>\n      <p>Cheers!</p>\n\
