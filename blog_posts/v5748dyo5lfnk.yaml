  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">December's Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ release is <i>The Hook Mountain Massacre</i>, the third Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure Deck. In this chapter of the story, the stalwart heroes are asked to\
  \ investigate Fort Rannick, a ranger outpost near Hook Mountain. Fort Rannick is\
  \ home to the Order of the Black Arrows, a cadre of rangers that have kept the local\
  \ ogre problem at bay for decades, but now the outpost is ominously silent.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Striding boldly (or not) into the foothills near Rannick, the players\
  \ quickly find themselves in conflict with the first of the area's \"looming troubles.\"\
  </p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>Let's take a moment to dig into the first scenario of\
  \ the adventure, Them Ogres Ain't Right—a card that still regularly wins Mike's\
  \ vote for \"Best Card Title\"—and preview some of its giant-sized participants.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-1a.jpg\"\

  \   </div> \n    <p>Though you might not normally associate an ogrekin matriarch\
  \ with necromancy, Mammy is happy to change your mind. Ancient Skeleton henchmen\
  \ aren't a major threat to the characters at this point, but every little bit hurts,\
  \ and Mammy's habit of using the <i>dimension door</i> spell to escape the fight\
  \ and heal up doesn't help.</p> \n    <p>From a mechanical standpoint, we don't\
  \ often ask you to remember specific details from turn to turn, but Mammy provides\
  \ a rare exception. Though you may not remember if you tried to recharge that Lightning\
  \ Bolt spell last turn, we're pretty sure you'll remember whether or not the gracious\
  \ Ms. Graul has already escaped your best efforts.</p> \n    <p>Of course, Mammy's\
  \ going to want some help, and not just from some puny skeletons; luckily, there\
  \ are plenty of Graul Ogrekin to go around. In fact, there are so many Graul Ogrekin\
  \ that we didn't think a single static card would do them justice.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-4.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-4_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>When you're bred (and re-bred, and re-re-bred) from fine stock\
  \ like most ogrekin, you're bound to see a few… <i>changes</i>… pop up here and\
  \ there. You never know exactly what to expect from a Graul Ogrekin. Some have especially\
  \ thick skin, while others have massive, oversized arms. A few have an extra head\
  \ or even a vestigial twin keeping an extra 1d3 eyes out for trouble. One thing\
  \ is pretty common to the Graul Ogrekin, though—they live in small groups, so when\
  \ you've beaten one, there might still be another cousin, nephew, or really ugly\
  \ relative waiting just around the corner.</p> \n    <p>Next up in our giantkin\
  \ parade, let's look at the current occupants of Fort Rannick itself, the Kreeg\
  \ Ogres. In case the ogrekin you've already seen weren't big enough, \"Pappy\" Jaagrath\
  \ Kreeg has brought you some new friends to play with.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-2.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-2_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Combining all the fun of a whirling barbarian\
  \ with the sheer entertainment value of an ogre (and showing off our basic ogre\
  \ power, the ability to hurt everyone at its location), Jaagrath also has a special\
  \ hate-hate relationship with humans. He's not so bad to start, but once his rage\
  \ kicks in you might need to dig deep for that Combat 23 check, especially since\
  \ you might have already lost a card from your hand.</p> \n    <p>Lest you think\
  \ Hook Mountain Massacre is just about simple giantkin doing what simple giantkin\
  \ do, there are always a few subtler opponents moving around behind the scenes.\
  \ Given that the Graul Ogrekin and the Kreeg Ogres have been held at bay for decades\
  \ by the work of the Black Arrows—and the on-again, off-again Kreeg-Graul feud—\
  you might wonder why things have suddenly changed.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-5.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-5_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>If you ever find yourself lacking for temptation\
  \ with just a touch of silver-tongued treachery, look no further than the friendly\
  \ local lamia matriarch. These shapechangers are known for their malice as well\
  \ as for their spellcasting prowess. Lucrecia's presence definitely suggests something\
  \ more than ogres run amok.</p> \n    <h2> Good News from the Front</h2> \n    <p>Luckily,\
  \ it's not all bad news on Hook Mountain (heh). In addition to the new playmates,\
  \ there's also some potent new help on offer, including members of the Order of\
  \ Black Arrows themselves.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-7.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-7_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Jakardros is a grizzled veteran of the Black Arrows, and with\
  \ his help, anyone can have a little ranger-flavored assistance. Whether you're\
  \ trying to make your Ezren more of a team player, or just trying to make Harsk\
  \ win all the battles from the next location over, Jakardros can lend a bow. He's\
  \ lived in Fort Rannick long enough to learn to hate giants of all types, a talent\
  \ that I promise will not go to waste. For those of you who enjoy the story of the\
  \ Adventure Path, Jakardros has a not-so-public relationship with someone you have\
  \ probably already met… someone who might even be with your party at this point.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>While rangers are all very well and good, we all know that if you want\
  \ a job done right, you do it yourself, <i>with magic</i>. If that's more your speed,\
  \ I have a little something for you.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-6.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-6_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This one works for both kinds of spellcasters,\
  \ Country <i>and</i> Western... I mean Arcane and Divine. Swipe's versatility doesn't\
  \ stop there, oh no! It can be used to help out a comrade in a fight, to put up\
  \ a decent fight of your own, or to seal the deal on that nice weapon, armor, or\
  \ item that you just happened across. That's plenty of potency for our part-time\
  \ finger-wagglers who might have spent some attention on other shiny things (looking\
  \ at you, Lem!), while still rewarding the dedicated magic-is-my-life spellslingers.\
  \ It's a great way to make your blaster a little more party friendly, or to pick\
  \ up that Vicious Trident +1 for your friendly bear.</p> \n    <p>Finally, just\
  \ to reinforce the idea that every cloud can have a silver lining, and anything\
  \ with a silver lining can be stripped for parts and sold, I bring you a blessing\
  \ from the God of Greed:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-8.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-8_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Sure, Norgorber has a dark side—or 3, or 4—but who's counting?\
  \ You know who likes acquiring boons? <i>You</i> do. And everyone else does, too.\
  \ When you break out the PACG and play over the holiday, this card will help you\
  \ get that gift that you <i>really</i> wanted.</p> \n    <p>That's it for <i>The\
  \ Hook Mountain Massacre</i>. I hope you enjoyed reading about it, and I hope that\
  \ you enjoy playing it! Thanks again!</p> \n    <p>Chad Brown<br> <i>Pathfinder\
