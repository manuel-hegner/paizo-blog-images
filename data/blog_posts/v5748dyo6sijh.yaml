  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>One of the\
  \ theories that I intend to run by my Lady in my compilation of these so-called</em>\
  \ Godsrain Prophecies <em>is that they may be warnings of some kind. This is a relatively\
  \ new addition to my admittedly large list of potential reasons for their existence,\
  \ which range from sensible hypotheses to outlandish theories, including one recent\
  \ concern that this has all been a test by my Lady to discern whether I am trustworthy\
  \ and analytical enough to handle some of her more complex research needs. I know\
  \ she would never do such a thing, in truth, but after a particularly vivid dream\
  \ (involving my being back in one of Lorminos’s classes and asked to deliver a talk\
  \ about a research paper I had somehow forgotten to do), my anxiety briefly took\
  \ hold.</em></p>\n      <p><em>The warning theory is of particular interest to me\
  \ because it reflects an ongoing scholarly debate about the ability to prevent a\
  \ true prophecy. As noted in</em> Beyond Aroden <em>(which I believe I have already\
  \ mentioned in these pages), there are some who believe in the Fate’s Chain theory,\
  \ which holds that any action taken to prevent a foretelling only hastens its speed\
  \ and effects. Conversely, others believe that all prophecy presents the opportunity\
  \ to exert free will. In the words of one notorious scholar, “those who lie down\
  \ in front of the hooves of prophecy instead of taking the reins of their lives\
  \ deserve to be trampled to dust, even if only metaphorically.” Fiery words, and\
  \ ones I am not sure I believe, but given the gravity of this particular set of\
  \ prophecies, I do like the idea that this might be an opportunity to shift the\
  \ course of the future. </em></p>\n      <p><em>–Yivali, Apprentice Researcher for\

  75%\">\n       <br>\n      </center>\n      <h2>The Death of Desna</h2>\n      <p>The\
  \ thing about journeys, especially the good ones, was how easy it was to lose track\
  \ of the past. Hard to move forward while looking behind you. Desna had always believed\
  \ that. Each new night, each new step, had something new to offer up—a bit of knowledge\
  \ to excite her, a dark horizon to invite her, a way for love to keep her grounded\
  \ as she wandered from place to place.</p>\n      <p>But something else was out\
  \ there. A threat that she’d forgotten from the void between the stars, seeking\
  \ only to expand its brutal, ceaseless silence. Not an enemy that could be caught\
  \ or stopped forever, but something she’d held at bay as it consumed star after\
  \ star, by making them anew as she had done since the beginning. Back then she’\
  d set the stars like jewels, each a perfect piece of art, and now they were a chorus\
  \ that only she could truly hear, gentle bells that softly chimed and brought new\
  \ hope to dreamers.</p>\n      <p>Except with so much journeying, she’d let the\
  \ task slide down her list, forgetting to replace the stars that steadily winked\
  \ out. She hadn’t heard their quiet ringing slowly growing quieter, as something\
  \ more than silence brought new fury to its form. And by the time it reached her\
  \ ear, that music wasn’t quite as rich, and starlight twinkled that much less, and\
  \ butterflies flapped weakly. Absence had turned to abscess turned to deep vulnerability,\
  \ and what was of the past became the killer of the present. In one fell swoop of\
  \ emptiness, no longer held back by her lights, something of the Dark Tapestry she\
  \ thought she’d left behind took her and Cynosure as one, and with her all the stars\
  \ that filled the skies above Golarion.</p>\n      <p>Desna was loved by many, and\
  \ all stepped up to play a part and try to build a new world in the space left by\
  \ her death. Cayden Cailean raised cups “to Desna and to freedom” (though he stayed\
  \ still for many months, sometimes with Kurgess by his side, drinking to his memories\
  \ and running up his tab). Shelyn offered welcome to those who sang in Desna’s name,\
  \ collecting songs and poems so she would not be forgotten. (And when they sounded\
  \ out of tune, as if something was missing, she called them Desnal melodies and\
  \ blessed those who repeated them, ignoring art’s new promise for the haunting elegies).\
  \ Sarenrae sought her vengeance but had no one to strike out against, and so she\
  \ turned to healing in its place (by never letting hurt inside, and building walls\
  \ around her heart she dared Shelyn to climb).</p>\n      <p>No one could prove\
  \ the daytime light was any different than before, but even on the fairest day,\
  \ there was something in the air—a stagnant sort of thickness that weighed upon\
  \ the spine. Scouts moved slowly, and travelers lingered though they knew to hurry\
  \ (to get themselves to safety long before the starless night). With no means by\
  \ which to navigate, sailors called off voyages, reduced to tiny odysseys that kept\
  \ the shore in sight. And while the feeling dissipated, slowly easing day by day,\
  \ everything about the world felt dormant for a time.</p>\n      <p>Even as the\
  \ pace picked up, no stars returned to fill the sky. At night, only the moon shone\
  \ down, and paths forward could change in ways unlucky and impossible; more often\
  \ did travelers disappear from the shadowed roads ahead. And while some blamed her\
  \ ancient nemesis, Ghlaunder, who was emboldened by Desna’s demise, or Zon-Kuthon,\
  \ who reveled in the new depth of the darkness, only Desna would have known that\
  \ what killed her waited, determining its next advance, growing in the spaces left\
  \ within a starless night.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \      <p><em>The Dark Tapestry? It has been some time since I thought about that\
  \ void of space, which has long been reported to be the home of godlike beings far\
  \ beyond my comprehension. Maybe this is why I am the most intrigued about Desna’\
  s seeming knowledge of the place and its dangers. It is the first I am hearing of\
  \ a potential connection, though that may simply be because I do not attend the\
  \ right discussion groups. Whether or not this prophecy turns out to be true (or,\
  \ again, maybe a warning that my Lady might be able to give to Desna to prevent\
  \ this outcome), I will add a note about the possible link between Desna and the\
  \ Dark Tapestry to my collected papers covering her works as a deity. I am not sure\
  \ when or if I will have the time to publish any of the works I have begun to write,\
  \ or if there will be room in my papers for all of the data I now have, but I am\
  \ glad that I have at least begun collecting information. If these prophecies make\
  \ nothing else completely clear, my own takeaway is this: it is important to understand\
  \ what you know (and don’t) about the gods.</em></p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
