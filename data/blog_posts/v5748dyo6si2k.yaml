  \ I’m Know Direction’s Everyman Gamer and the Master of Ceremonies of Know Direction\
  \ Beyond, as well as the publisher of Everybody Games. I also write for Paizo and\

  \ product that details kitsune ethnic groups from across Golarion. I’m also thrilled\
  \ that my first Adventure Path volume, <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #51: Into the\
  \ Dataverse</em>, was announced a few weeks ago at PaizoCon. Finally, I’m proud\
  \ to be celebrating my first Pride as biromantic and of my new partner, who’s been\
  \ amazingly patient with me as he and I work to figure out my feelings. If you are\
  \ questioning or ever start to question yourself, please give yourself the time\
  \ and kindness to figure it out in whatever capacity you need. Sometimes the answer\
  \ is simply acknowledging the feelings you had at the start, and that can be scary.\

  \ \n      <p>Community is what will save us, and I've seen my community come together\
  \ over the past several years. Whether it's been mutual aid programs, labor solidarity,\
  \ or activist communities, I've seen those around me step up and mobilize to protect\
  \ each other. I've also worked to be someone my community would be proud of, especially\
  \ when it comes to ensuring I don’t leave vulnerable members behind.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>As I look to the future and continue to see a cycle of advances in rights\
  \ and then backlash, standing together is vital. While living under cissexist oppression\
  \ has been hard and there are never any guarantees of what the future holds, it\
  \ is always worthwhile to put in the effort. I owe so much to those that organize\
  \ movements. I can never repay that debt; I can only try.</p> \n      <p>I guess\
  \ this is where I talk about my own work, and how much I’ve done this past year\
  \ or what my upcoming releases are. If you’re interested in that, you can find my\
  \ work in the recently released <em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em> and in the upcoming\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Travel Guide</em>, <em>Starfinder\
  \ Interstellar Species</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Society Special #3-98: Expedition\
  \ into Pallid Peril</em>.</p> \n      <p>I also run a free newsletter about LGBTQIA+\
  \ speculative fiction (mostly sci-fi and fantasy). If you want to hear my thoughts\

  \ their worth. I mustered up the courage to tell my boss, “Treat me fairly, or I’\
  m going elsewhere.” Here I am now, living my best life in a new job, recording a\
  \ stand-up comedy special, my first Organized Play Scenario coming out this month\
  \ (PFS: #3-16: Escape From Oppara), and an editor of The <a href=\"https://jod4hap.com/\"\
  >Journal of Dungeoneering For Hip and Attractive Professionals</a>. From Starbucks\

  \ \n      <p>Hi, my name is Carlos Cabrera and I identify as bisexual. I have written\
  \ for Pathfinder in both first and second editions and have done some additional\
  \ voice acting work. My latest credit to date is the voice of Ashasar for the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Special #3-99: Fate of the Future</em>, which played at GenCon last year!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The thing I am proud of most in the last year is my willingness to\
  \ diversify my career and follow my freelancing work wherever it takes me. Not only\
  \ did I decide to start pursuing voice acting after stumbling upon it in the Seattle\
  \ indie video game scene, I have two board game projects currently in the works\
  \ and one has been picked up by a publisher!</p> \n      <p>I look forward to wherever\
  \ my career takes me next and should be returning to writing more content for Pathfinder\
  \ soon as well. You'll be able to find all of my upcoming project announcements\

  \ on a lot of Paizo stuff I’m proud of this year, but instead of those, something\
  \ else I’m proud of is making my first forays into professional media translation\
  \ and translating some anime, including both an episode with a ton of puns and an\
  \ episode that made my roommate go “wait why hasn’t that character stopped talking\
  \ yet it’s been like a minute and I don’t think she’d breathed.” Between this and\
  \ the RPG thing, middle school James would be proud. I also (with my stepmother’\
  s help) figured out how to stop messing up a few recipes that had been giving me\
  \ trouble this year, which I’m proud of too! All this and more can be found on the\

  \      <p>Hi! I'm Caryn (she/they). I write marketing content as my day job, but\
  \ the much cooler answer to \"what do you do\" is my recent experience freelancing\

  \ I've put in over the years, and also a new opportunity to learn and grow as a\
  \ writer. On a more serious and somber note, I'm also proud of the resilience and\
  \ resistance of the LGBTQ+ community recently. I wish it wasn't necessary. But speaking\
  \ truth to power, doing what you can to make your community better, and even just\
  \ living your truth even though others are hostile to it are all accomplishments.\

  \ (most recently to <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>) and proud trans girl.\
  \ ^_^</p> \n      <p>This year is a pretty big deal for me. In addition to contributing\
  \ lots of content to the aforementioned <em>Knights of Lastwall</em>, I’ve gotten\
  \ started as a freelance editor for works like Queerfinder on Pathfinder Infinite,\
  \ among several others, and I’m pushing myself to make editing a full-time gig.\
  \ In addition, after many long years and struggles, I’m finally making an effort\
  \ to leave my hometown and move somewhere more affirming and supportive, where I\
  \ can have a real community and my own life. It’s going to be tough, but I’m hoping\
  \ it will really pay off in the end!</p> \n      <br> \n      <table class=\"image\"\

  \ \n      <p>Hi y’all! I’m Esther Wallace (she/her, zhe/zher). I’m a queer/bisexual,\
  \ genderfluid, disabled creator and game designer.</p> \n      <p>My biggest point\
  \ of pride in the last year is finishing my graduate degree, where among other things\
  \ I studied tabletop as a form of ritual and meaning-making. Right now, I’m extremely\
  \ proud of designing my first game, Front Porch. It’s a worldbuilding game about\
  \ gossip and gossip’s power to create and unravel social bonds and social worlds,\
  \ and it will hopefully drop in July 2022. </p> \n      <p>I’m also the GM of Chromythica,\
  \ a trans and queer-led Pathfinder 2E actual play. Our story focuses on two gnomes,\
  \ a tief-elf, and a talking dog who stumble on a vast plot of Draconic intrigue\
  \ and Infernal meddling, learning in the process that they’re fated to shape the\
  \ destinies of dragons and the course of history. I’m immensely proud of everything\
  \ we have accomplished as a trans and queer cast! Together, we imagine a story where\
  \ trans and queer people not only survive, but thrive. I’m proud of us for telling\
  \ the stories that we most want to encounter in this world. We’d be delighted for\
  \ you to join us in our story if you’re just finding out about us!</p> \n      <p>Finally,\
  \ I’m proud to have created #tabletopaccess, a hashtag for disabled gamers to share\
  \ our experiences in the tabletop community. </p> \n      <p>You can find me on\
  \ Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dungeonminister\">@dungeonminister</a> (or\
  \ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chromythica\">@chromythica</a>) and on the web at\

  >Queerfinder</a> on Pathfinder Infinite in January 2022 as an in-world travel magazine\
  \ featuring queer-friendly stories, NPCs, locations, and plot hooks as imagined\
  \ by queer creators. The magazine celebrates existing industry talents, such as\
  \ Paizo contributors, as well as up-and-coming designers and artists trying to break\
  \ into the industry. We're so proud of our passionate and talented team, who not\
  \ only strive to elevate each other but to improve industry conditions through advocacy\

  \ were also thrilled that our band of rainbow kobold adventurers, originally conceived\
  \ as a Pride Month fundraiser for GLSEN in 2020, are making the leap into the real\
  \ world as huggable plushies. After over a year of development, we launched our\
  \ new <a href=\"https://kobold-plushies.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders\">Hero Plush</a>\
  \ brand on Kickstarter and are so proud it became one of the top 40 plush Kickstarters\
