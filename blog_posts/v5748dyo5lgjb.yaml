  >Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> serves many purposes, among them the opportunity\
  \ for a group to sit down and play a short adventure. Most scenarios have a run-time\
  \ of 4-5 hours, but even that can be a little too long for some people, schedules,\
  \ and venues. Sometimes it's just a matter of finishing one game early and needing\
  \ something quick to play to pass the time until the next convention slot begins.\
  \ Over three years ago, the campaign introduced a solution: <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/quests\"\
  >Quests</a>. The first was \"Ambush at Absalom,\" which appeared in <a href=\"/products/btpy8jvn\"\
  ><i>Kobold Quarterly #17</i></a>, followed a little over a year later by \"Urge\
  \ to Evolve\" in the publication's <a href=\"-\">final issue</a>, #23. Since then,\
  \ the campaign has produced several <a href=\"/products/btpy8q4o\">series of demos</a>\
  \ released at major conventions or as part of a <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox\"\
  >major product release</a>.</span></p> \n    <p>These have worked really well as\
  \ introductions for new players of any age, yet the feedback I've heard is that\
  \ they're not an attractive option for more experienced players. Is that an issue?\
  \ Thinking back to myriad discussion threads inquiring about adding more Tier 1â€“\
  5 scenarios to the schedule, I believe the answer is yes. Any chance to sit experienced\
  \ players with newer ones is an opportunity to build the community, share tips,\
  \ and impart good roleplaying values. To facilitate this, the experience should\
  \ provide an incentive to make it more immediately worthwhile for the veterans as\
  \ well as sufficiently appealing for the beginners to keep playing. The feedback\
  \ I received about previous Quests was that no matter how fun they were, they provided\
  \ no gold, XP, or Prestige Points to participants. No rewards meant virtually no\
  \ use.</p> \n    <p>So what should a successful set of Quests do?</p> \n    <ul>\n\
  \     <li>Deliver a Society-friendly RPG experience that lasts about one hour</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Provide a solid introduction (i.e. diverse, fun, and generally nonlethal)\
  \ for new players</li> \n     <li>Reward participants with gold, XP, and Prestige\
  \ Points</li> \n     <li>Serve as a testing ground for new authors.</li>\n    </ul>\
  \ \n    <p>These were my goals when assigning and developing the latest batch of\
  \ Quests, a six-part series called <a href=\"/products/btpy98nh\"><i>The Silverhex\
  \ Chronicles</i></a>. While working on the outline, I also remembered conversations\
  \ I had with venture-captains over the past year, requesting 2-hour adventures that\
  \ could be played on a weekday evening yet had enough substance to warrant traveling\
  \ to a game day. Changing the 1-hour model was unlikely, but it was possible to\
  \ link the Quests to one another loosely as part of a longer, flexible story that\
  \ participants could experience in any order.</p> \n    <p>Balancing the rewards\
  \ structure was tricky. If the Chronicle sheet were to provide only gold or Prestige\
  \ Points but not XP, then a PC could complete the adventure and get ahead of the\
  \ wealth curve. If the Quests were to provide minimal gold and Prestige Points with\
  \ 1 XP, then veteran players would consider them suboptimal and avoid them. Instead,\
  \ the Chronicle sheet provides scaling rewards depending on how many of the Quests\
  \ one finishes before starting a different scenario. It's even possible to play\
  \ the Quests over multiple sessions or with different groups and still get the full\
  \ rewards. What's more, these Quests are replayable.</p> \n    <p>Of course, I had\
  \ to find authors for the series, so I took this as an opportunity to draw upon\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/getinvolved\">Open Call</a> submissions. I wasn't\
  \ disappointed. Josh Foster, Scott Sharplin, and Walter Sheppard did a great job\
  \ of working together to integrate their adventures and vary the types of challenges\
  \ presented so that these Quests provide a wide range of combat, roleplaying, and\
  \ puzzle-solving opportunities.</p> \n    <p>The series was a blast at Gen Con.\
  \ It was a hit at PAX. Now it's available as a <a href=\"/products/btpy98nh\">free\
  \ download to the public</a>. Let us know what you think!</p> \n    <p>Happy gaming!</p>\
