               <p>It's especially fitting because of the recent American Thanksgiving holiday that I give thanks for the consistently excellent <a href="/rpgsuperstar">RPG Superstar</a> finalists who have contributed to the <a href="/products/btpy93m0"><em>Destiny of the Sands</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9am4"><em>Scions of the Sky Key</em></a>, and the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9huv"><em>Faithless and Forgotten</em></a> series. I am consistently impressed with the quality of their turnovers, and it's telling that their names continue to appear in recent Pathfinder products. There were two authors that quickly came to mind for these two tough projects: Mikko Kallio and Mike Kimmel, finalists in <a href="/rpgsuperstar">RPG Superstar</a> 2014 (the third finalist Robert Brookes handled <a href="/products/btpy9gwx">one of the adventures last month</a> and recently concluded a Kickstarter for <a href="http://www.aetherarpg.com" target="_blank">a new campaign setting</a>).</p>

               <p>With <a href="/products/btpy9hgx"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-10: The Consortium Compact</em></a> by Mike Kimmel, the organized play campaign publishes its third evergreen Tier 1-2 scenario since the First Steps series. In <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li7w">a recent blog</a>, assistant developer Linda Zayas-Palmer provides an initial preview and explains what makes an evergreen scenario. This week I'd like to introduce you to Magali Delroya, an informant with growing sympathies toward the Pathfinder Society. Look forward to meeting her for this assignment in Diobel, on the western coast of the Isle of Kortos. Get your new characters ready to stick it to the Aspis Consortium!</p>

               <p>Mikko Kallio had the tricky task of picking up the ongoing Scarab Sages metaplot and continuing a story that goes back several seasons. <a href="/products/btpy9hgy"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-11: Ancients' Anguish</em></a> is (to the amusement of many) a Tier 7-11 adventure that begins in Katapesh with Venture-Captain Roderus and takes us to the desert of northern Nex, where a member of the Jeweled Sages fled millennia ago. Recent divinations have picked up his trail, and the PCs brave the stinging sands to uncover secrets from a rarely explored time period in a rarely explored region. This is a story that I've had rolling around in my head since we first introduced the sage jewels, and I'd hate to spoil the surprise by saying much more. I am really happy with how this adventure turned out, and Mikko not only respected the outline but also breathed some great flavor into the adventure. To preview just one of those additional elements, take a look at The Dark Iris.</p> 
               <p>As the end of the calendar year approaches, I'm spending more and more time outlining and assigning scenarios for Spring 2016 and beyond—including several really fun special events. I can hardly wait to share what's coming up.</p>

                 <br><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i>
                </div> 
                <p>Lazzero Dalvera, the eldest child of an officer in the Molthuni army and a priest of Abadar, was born under an auspicious moon with a full head of bright red hair. Everyone assumed he would earn respect and fame as an army officer like his mother. His training began as soon as he could walk, and he attended the best military academies to which his parents' money and connections could win him entrance.</p> 
                <p>But the boy was not a strong child, and he lacked the temperament to hone his martial skills. Instead, bullies perfected their own abilities at his expense, both in formal sparring matches and between classes. Rather than retaliate with violence, Lazzero kept tabs on the children who picked on him, recording their secret transgressions—cheating, lying, petty theft, and other such behaviors common among privileged youth. When he had amassed a sufficient amount of dirt on his rivals, he ensured his teachers found it—anonymously of course—and laughed to himself as the bullies got their just rewards for their wrongdoings.</p> 
                <p>Despite his skill at countering his rivals, Lazzero still didn't excel in his martial studies, and by the age of 12 had washed out of every military academy in which his parents had placed him. With their hopes in their son dashed, they sent Lazzero to be trained by the Abadaran clergy, who counted his father among their number; if he couldn't fulfill his destiny as a military commander, he would do so in service to the Master of the First Vault.</p> 
                <p>In this endeavor Lazzero finally succeeded, for he found prayer and contemplation came naturally to him. Now among the top initiates in the Abadaran monastery, Lazzero took on the role of bully and tormentor. He didn't need to study as much as his less studious peers did, and could use the time not spent poring over religious texts making life harder for those weaker than himself. In addition to overt hazing, Lazzero maintained even more thorough records of his enemies' activities, which he took pride in turning over to his superiors—publicly this time—so that they would receive punishment for their transgressions.</p> 
                <p>While he couldn't ensure that justice was served, Lazzero believed he was doing Abadar's work. How, he asked, could his peers expect to teach Abadar's ways if they couldn't themselves follow his laws? Was he not complicit in their wrongdoing if he allowed their crimes to go unpunished? With such justifications, Lazzero convinced himself that what he did was right, that it would set him apart from his so-called equals in the eyes of his teachers and Abadar. He didn't recognize, however, that he had started down a slippery slope that would ultimately lead to his fall from grace—for Lazzero had begun to twist the law to meet his needs. The law was now a weapon he used to keep those he didn't like beneath him.</p> 
                <p>By graduation, Lazzero had distinguished himself as one of the most gifted acolytes, though he had made no friends and garnered his share of enemies, many of his teachers among them. For his apprenticeship, Lazzero traveled from Canorate to Cettigne—an inglorious posting not befitting his high marks and honors. Lazzero was to serve as the acolyte at the local temple along with a fellow graduate, a woman named Laureth. The pair were highly competitive, each aspiring to rise in the ranks of the church quickly and find a permanent placement in a more prestigious temple than Cettigne's.</p> 
                <p>Although Lazzero was the more talented cleric, Laureth was more favored, receiving a prominent position within the temple and taking on greater responsibilities. Unwilling to accept a position beneath his rival, Lazzero began plotting and spying on Laureth in the hope of catching her falling short of the high standards expected of Abadar's clergy. Laureth provided him no opportunities, however, behaving as a paragon whom all faithful of Abadar should aspire to emulate.</p> 
                <p>Frustrated and bitter, Lazzero prayed for a means of turning the law against Laureth, but Abadar provided no guidance. Rather, a different voice echoed in the recesses of Lazzero's mind, offering honeyed promises of providing all Lazzero could imagine and more. It spoke of deceptions and lies as a means to an end, of the weak serving the strong, and of always having the upper hand. Lazzero liked these words, and though he knew he would no longer be true to Abadar if he were to follow them, he did so anyway. He would see Laureth humiliated, no matter the cost.</p> 
                <p>Prompted by his mysterious new divine patron, Lazzero began committing minor crimes himself and staging evidence to point toward Laureth. Fabricated trade records for transactions under her jurisdiction, false testimony written in her hand, and unbalanced ledgers month after month with no explanation into the shortfall all built a case against his rival. Through subterfuge and sabotage, Lazzero ensured that Laureth could never be solvent in the eyes of Abadar's code. Best of all, he brought about her ruin through the very laws and regulations that had for so long kept him from achieving his own lofty goals.</p> 
                <p>When Laureth was convicted and sentenced to a life of servitude rather than clerical service, Lazzero said a prayer of thanks to the Keeper of the First Vault, asking for a blessing from his patron. Asmodeus answered in his stead, revealing himself to have been the orchestrator of Lazzero's revenge upon Laureth. In that moment, Lazzero knew that the path to his prophesied glory lay not in continuing in his father's footsteps in the temple of Abadar. The Prince of Lies had shown him the power of deceit and the means through which he could always ensure the law worked in his favor.</p> 
                <p>That night, Lazzero left Cettigne, his vestments and holy symbol left folded neatly on his modest cot, and headed south to Cheliax. He forsook all his Abadaran vows and proclaimed his faith in Asmodeus, and sought a church of his new patron. No longer did Lazzero worry that he would not achieve greatness. He was content to enter an Asmodean temple as a lowly adept with faith that his dedication would quickly raise him to the upper echelons of the church. Thus did Lazzero begin his true journey—a quest for power and glory achieved by following the Prince of Darkness.</p>

              <p class="date">Tuesday, November 24, 2015</p> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">We've been admittedly pretty quiet since we showed the game at Gen Con and then PAX back in August. There's been a fair bit of speculation about it. So I guess first I'll clear some stuff up.</p> 
               <p>We won't be releasing the game in fall 2015... and that's a good thing!</p> 
               <p>Time for context!</p> 
               <p>Back when we started this project, I worked out the scope of the game with the execs at Obsidian. André Nguyen created a great mockup of gameplay in Flash that helped get everyone at Obsidian and at Paizo on board (I may share some screens from that version at some point). We agreed on a pretty limited set of features to begin with—enough so that you could play through the Base deck of <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>. I knew a three-scenario game would be enough to prove the game out, but not enough to bring to market. As development continued and our confidence in the product grew, we kept building upon what we had piece by piece, carefully increasing the scope over time. With each additional piece, we added a lot more content and improved presentation—well beyond our original plans.</p> 
               <p>So that brings us up to today, and more importantly, a release date that we're moving to early 2016. Why is that a good thing?</p> 
               <p>Well, behind the scenes at Obsidian, we are now planning a better, stronger launch than ever before. And I gotta tell you, I'm excited! There are so many cool things in the works, including some that will let you experience the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game in new ways. First, there's this cool new...</p> 
               <p class="tiny"><i>Feargus (CEO, Obsidian Entertainment): Davis! Not yet!</i></p> 
               <p>Ah, right. There's a whole plan for talking about this.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, I think there are some new things I can "leak."</p> 
               <p>We've been working closely with Paizo and Lone Shark to make this game as awesome as possible. In most cases, that means staying true to the original rules and intent. There are times where the limitations of interface (over a tabletop) mean it's better if we change the mechanics of the card to fit our game. A simple example of this comes from the "Cloud" spells.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-ToxicCloud.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-ToxicCloud_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-ToxicCloud.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-ToxicCloud_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>"Don't you know that you're toxic?" ...yep, the card game blog got a Britney reference.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>From a mechanics perspective, we removed the "when a character encounters" part of the spell and made it work more like other displayed spells such as Strength and Glibness. It’s a minor change in functionality, but a large benefit for our interface: instead of stopping gameplay whenever a bane is encountered in order to see if the character with this spell wants to play it, it’s now available before or after an exploration or on a combat check. You’ll also notice that we've made some changes to the card layout; for the most part, we've done this to give the card art a bit more room. We also introduced icons for the different card types, as there are places where our user interface really benefits from that. And Paizo has updated the wording where appropriate.</p> 
               <p>The folks at Paizo have also given us opportunities to add cards here and there that are unique to the digital game. Here are some of my favorites so far:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-ChainMail.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-ChainMail_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-RustedChainMail.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-RustedChainMail_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-MasterworkChainMail.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-MasterworkChainMail_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Rusted Chain doesn't care about your armor proficiency.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The original game has a lot of standard chain mail. We switched out some of them with minor mechanical changes and art revisions. As you know from playing the game, anything that adds to the thrill of discovery is a good thing.</p> 
               <p>And speaking of thrilling, our artist, Lindsey Laney, was inspired to create the art for a new card in her free time. I can only describe it as a move for gender equality.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ShopkeepersDaughter.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ShopkeepersDaughter_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-BlacksmithSon.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-BlacksmithSon_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>In case you ever wondered what a half-orc with high Charisma looks like.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Now let me tell you about who's playable in the tutorial...</p> 
               <p class="tiny"><i>Feargus: Davis! Back to work!</i></p> 
               <p>Alrighty! Gotta go! More information to come.</p>

              <p class="date">Monday, November 23, 2015</p> 
              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Just as many people consider one place home no matter where they live now (every so often, I still find myself saying “home” as shorthand for Georgia), I’ve met many gamers who have what they consider their "home group" even when life’s circumstances and opportunities take them to opposite ends of the state, country, or planet. Fortunately, the quality of low-cost virtual tabletop programs and communication software improves every year, and it’s easier than ever to run a game when friends are thousands of miles apart. Even so, there’s something really special about reuniting the band in person.</p> 
               <p>My home group first formed about 16 years ago—and I now realize has been together for more than half my life—and has involved perhaps a dozen different players over the years. We were always close, but we became especially close thanks to the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> campaign. Playing scenarios as a home group soon led to our volunteering at Dragon*Con, after which we began serving as store liaisons and traveling a much broader convention circuit as a team. When the final installment of the <em>Eyes of the Ten</em> story was about to come out, Mike Brock ran us through all four parts in one weekend, making us (as I still understand it) the first group to finish the entire series. Together, most of us hit 5-star status, and even those who haven’t yet GMed selflessly and ferociously at countless events over that 30-month golden age. As you may guess the story goes, I was the one who broke up the band by moving across the country to work for Paizo. Earlier in 2012, we had begun the “post-retirement” tradition by playing <a href="/products/btpy8l3i?Pathfinder-Module-Academy-of-Secrets">Pathfinder Module: "Academy of Secrets"</a> with Joe Caubo as our GM. About a week before I flew out to Seattle, Georgia’s current venture-captain Dan Cornett oversaw <a href="/products/btpy8j5y?Pathfinder-Module-Tomb-of-the-Iron-Medusa">Pathfinder Module: Tomb of the Iron Medusa</a> as a last hurrah, and since then we had wistfully wondered when our –1 characters might tackle <a href="/products/btpy8ssi?Pathfinder-Module-The-Moonscar">Pathfinder Module: "The Moonscar"</a>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151123-WebsterWedding.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151123-WebsterWedding_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <em>Congratulations to Colin and Jen Broyles! The wings of the dragon miniature Nani Pratt painted as their cake-topper are in the bottom left.</em>
               </div> 
               <p>When two of the members Colin Webster and Jen Broyles first announced their wedding engagement, we celebrated the happy development. As the excitement subsided, it both shames and amuses me to say that we paused and then simultaneously suggested reuniting our gaming group to thrash some demons on the moon. Given they had first met at our Pathfinder Society game, it felt appropriate. You can see some earlier pictures of Colin and me in a <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lbgw?Battle-in-Kelmarane">blog that featured our Legacy of Fire game</a>—more specifically Nani and Kyle Pratt’s amazing 3-D Battle Market.</p> 
               <p>We left the honor of recruiting a GM to Jen and Colin, and they picked a winner: the husband-wife co-GMs Sterling and Jessica Metz from the Georgia area. I had met both of them on separate occasions; Sterling was at a game day I stopped by last December, and I had the pleasure of GMing Jessica’s underfoot monk through part of <a href="/products/btpy8tb0?Pathfinder-Online-Thornkeep">Thornkeep</a> at a convention this past January. This weekend they brought their A-game by presenting high-level threats. They were also exceedingly gracious when we routinely demolished whatever tried to hurt us. It was a great time, and we all walked away with some great stories.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151123-MoonscarGame.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151123-MoonscarGame_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <em>From the left, Sterling Metz, Jessica Metz, Colin Webster, and Jen Webster</em>
               </div> 
               <p>Including Sterling, whose two natural 20s in a row resulted in my alchemist’s first death ever. I understand he is currently building a small shrine to house the die that killed the developer’s main character. AC 55, Sterling! You’d think that would be enough!</p> 
               <p>Thank you to Sterling and Jessica for running a great game and being patient as our characters wasted countless hours catching up with one another, recounting past deeds, and reigniting old rivalries. Cheers to our old team, whose characters have adventured together for five years now. Congratulations most of all to my dear friends Colin and Jen Webster.</p> 
               <p>Now just to figure out when we’re playing through <a href="/products/btpy8go0">"The Witchwar Legacy"</a>...</p> 
               <p>Has Pathfinder helped you reunite your dream team and spend time with cherished comrades? Perhaps you’re participating in a play-by-post with old pals, or you met at Gen Con and have always shared a table for the interactive specials. We often think of how Pathfinder Society facilitates pick-up games, but I’d love to hear about how special events have brought far-flung friends back together.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">It's been a crazy week here at Paizo as we put the final finishing touches on the <a href="/products/btpy9hj7"><em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue</em></a> hardcover before sending it to the printer. That coupled with the fact that we're "between sets" and I don't have any digital sculpts to show off for the next set yet OR photos of production figures from <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, this week's Publisher Preview is going to be a bit of an outlier.</p> 
               <p>First, I want to follow-up on some questions resulting from <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li8l">last week's preview blog</a>. When listing the components of the frankly incredibly cool <a href="/products/btpy9ehn"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn Bar Case Incentive</em></a>, I mentioned that each set would come with three (3) long barfront sections. Eagle-eyed readers noticed that the accompanying photo, which used pieces from two case incentive sets to create a cool diorama, actually had five (5) bar sections. So, how many straight barfront sections are in the incentive? I've confirmed with WizKids that each will indeed have THREE long barfronts, as I stated in last week's blog. So that, as they say, is that.</p> 
               <p>Since I don't have any NEW minis to show you this week, I did want to circle back and show off all of the <a href="/pathfinderbattles/singles/promos">special limited edition promotional figures</a> we've released this year, all of which are now available for purchase on paizo.com. These figures were given out at conventions throughout 2015, and now that the convention season is over, we're offering the remaining figures for sale here on the site. They make great stocking stuffers for the gamers in your life. Because these figures are NOT available in sets, even a lot of hardcore <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> collectors probably do not have them. Let's take a look!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/products/btpy9f5g"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71815-8-46-PR_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>From the moment I first saw the gold-hued Burning Brazier from <a href="/products/btpy9bc6"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>, I knew we had to order up a promotional repaint. I asked for this one in silver, figuring folks would want numerous "normal" braziers offset by the rarer golden version, perhaps as a special focus of a ritual or something. The standard <a href="/products/btpy9f5g">Burning Brazier</a> is long sold out, but we've got plenty of <a href="/products/btpy9f5g">the promotional version</a> available for all your holiday dungeon dressing needs.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/products/btpy9h8s"><img src="/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOWZK2015-01_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This sweet <a href="/products/btpy9h8s">Red Dracolisk</a> was available free with purchase at Paizo's Gen Con booth, and made subsequent appearances at other conventions throughout the summer. I've always been taken aback by the quality of this sculpt, and for my money the red version is even cooler than the standard <a href="/products/btpy9eni">Dracolisk</a> from <a href="/products/btpy9bc6"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>. Encountered alone or in a pack of several, this guy is sure to send shivers down the spines of your player characters just as effectively as the Krampus. Plus he's red. You know, for Christmas.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/products/btpy9h8t"><img src="/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOWZK2015-02_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Until the <a href="/products/btpy9h8t">Fire Beetle</a> hit paizo.com a few weeks back, the only place to get it was by playing in one of the <a href="/pathfindersociety">Pathfinder Society Specials</a> at Gen Con. One of my favorite annual traditions is going from table to table in the immense Sagamore Ballroom and handing out free minis to all of the event's 1000+ participants. We're so honored that so many folks enjoy and play our game, and it's fun to give back and personally thank everyone for their support. If you missed the event, don't fear, we've got plenty in stock just in time for the holidays.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/products/btpy9h8u"><img src="/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOWZK2015-03_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Another Gen Con debut, the <a href="/products/btpy9h8u">Duergar Soldier</a> is a fantastic repaint of the <a href="/products/btpy9enn">Dwarf Barbarian</a> from <a href="/products/btpy9bc6"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>. He works great as a singular villain or as one of several duergar mooks. And "best" of all, we spelled his name incorrectly on the base, so... collector's item!</p> 
               <p>We've also got several promotional figures for previous years still available, such as the <a href="/products/btpy9ao4">Lava Lurker</a>, <a href="/products/btpy9ao3">Shadowfire Elemental</a>, <a href="/products/btpy9ao2">Bloodbriar Goblin Raider</a>, <a href="/products/btpy96s9">Hellfire Wisp</a>, <a href="/products/btpy96s8">Albino Wererat</a>, <a href="/products/btpy96s7">Slaver Demon</a>, <a href="/products/btpy96s6">Goblin Raider</a>, <a href="/products/btpy909o">Reta's Bridesmaid</a>, and <a href="/products/btpy909n">Konkrud</a> the goblin. Get 'em while we've got 'em!</p> 
               <p>The Publisher Preview Blog (and all of Paizo, for that matter) will be closed next Friday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Paizo.com, of course, will still be open during that time, so while you're knocking off holiday gifts for friends and family, please take a moment to check out our <a href="http://paizo.com/store/sale/november2015/">Pathfinder Accessories Sale</a>, which includes a lot of great deals on Pathfinder Battles miniatures, like $20 off the suggested retail price for the <a href="/products/btpy91sj"><em>Red Dragon Evolution</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy8yj4"><em>White Dragon Evolution</em></a> boxed sets.</p> 
               <p>It's a Christmas miracle!</p> 
               <p>See you in two weeks!</p>

               <p>Dominating against the Pakalchi Sahkil, the Wyrmwraith emerged the victor in our battle royale! This CR 17 incorporeal undead has a terrifying array of powers at its command, making you long for the days of "just" fighting a dragon for its wealth. Not even dragons are safe from the wyrmwraith, for as much as this undead hates the living, it hates those that remind it of what it lost the most.</p>

               <p>It's November, and you all know what's special about this month, right?</p> 
               <p>No, not turkey. (Though I guess eating an evolved dinosaur is pretty cool, in a "mammalian pride" sort of way.)</p> 
               <p>No, not elections, either. I mean, democracy's great and all, but let's get our priorities straight here, people.</p> 
               <p>No, November's special because <b>this is the month when <a href="/products/btpy9gou">the first issue of <em>Pathfinder: Hollow Mountain</em></a> releases!</b></p> 
               <p>I'll give you a moment to catch your breath and clean up the coffee mug you just dropped in your excitement. Ready? Okay.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description"><a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain"><em>Pathfinder: Hollow Mountain</em></a> is the new comic series from Dynamite, written by me, Wes Schneider, and Erik Mona. We're the same team who brought you <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/origins"><em>Pathfinder: Origins</em></a>, but this time instead of doing six mostly independent stories from the iconic team's past, we're hopping back to the present and taking them on a brand new adventure.</p> 
               <p>But where to take them? When we got the go-ahead to pitch a new series arc, we pretty quickly came up with two key criteria. First, the series should involve a dungeon—given how central the idea of a dungeon is to our game and to RPGs in general, it seemed like we were well overdue for a true dungeon crawl. And second, we wanted to do something continuity-heavy—something that a lot of fans of the game would recognize. After all, one of the advantages of having three of Pathfinder's lead creators writing the scripts meant that we could probably be trusted to play with some of the big toys. We wanted a megadungeon that would be instantly recognizable to longtime players of the game.</p> 
               <p>Immediately, our thoughts turned to Hollow Mountain. That giant face on the side of a mountain had been taunting us since <a href="/products/btpy7zkr"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #1</em></a>. While we'd already published a high-level overview of it in <a href="/products/btpy8lv5"><em>Dungeons of Golarion</em></a>, we'd never actually sent characters face-to-face with its horrors. Plus, the chance to illustrate Runelords in the comics? Hell yes!</p> 
               <p>Yet as much fun as it is to see some of our most notorious villains come to life in the pages of issue #1, the biggest appeal for me was much more personal.</p> 
               <p>See, back before <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain">the comic series</a> and the <a href="/pathfinder/legends">Big Finish audio dramas</a>, the only time we ever got to hear the iconics actually <i>talk</i> was in the little chapter opener fiction snippets in the hardcover books. And with a handful of exceptions, I've written every one of those for the last 6 years. (If you've ever wondered why the characters seem to be constantly making fun of each other, it's because I find it hilarious!) So after spending more than half a decade helping to develop the iconics' personalities in 100-word bursts, it was a joy to finally get to write scenes with the whole team, showing how they work together in combat, express affection for each other (under that armor, Valeros is a big ol' softy)—and, yes, make fun of each other at every possible opportunity.</p> 
               <p>Of course, it's not just the main iconic team I'm excited to write. There are some other very familiar faces you're going to be seeing over the course of this series. But I'll let Wes talk about those next month...</p> 
               <p>See you all at the comics shop!</p>

Such is the enthusiasm and self-reliance of our Pathfinder Society brethren, despite the government closing the site down and the convention being officially cancelled, games still happened. Karim &amp; helpers found two sites across town and coordinated games all day. Not only did they play scenarios in the afternoon, they organized five tables for the interactive special <em>7-00: The Sky Key Solution</em>. For the hardiness of the attendees and the efforts of Karim &amp; crew, vivat!</p> 
               <p>Also this weekend, I participated in a game of <em>7-09: The Blackros Connection</em>, via Google Hangouts. As of a few weeks ago, Ross Tait, Venture-Lieutenant of Edmonton, Alberta, had run the required amount of games and special events. The only requirement left was to GM for a Venture-Captain. Unfortunately, there was none within a 4-hour drive. So after some discussion, we decided I would act as observer. He got a group together and we linked in players from North Bay, Edmonton, and Seattle. I enjoyed myself and found that modern technology allows for all sorts of opportunities. If you are geographically separate from a gaming group, I encourage you to contact Venture Captain Jesse Davis, who coordinates the online program, and ask about games. He has GMs that run a variety of platforms, including play by post (pbp), virtual tabletops (VTTs), and videochat.</p> 
               <p>Traveling around the area gives me ample opportunity to participate in PFS activities. So far, I've made it to 4 game stores in the greater Seattle area and plan on getting to a few more in the next two weeks. I enjoy getting out and chatting with the players, as well as keeping up with my GM skills. I'm even getting a chance to play. Last weekend found me playing at a table of <em>6-12: Scions of the Sky Key Part 1</em> at Extra Life Con in Spokane, Washington. I also ran two games and played a session of the Season of the Shackles ACG. We had a meet and greet over breakfast and coffee, where we discussed some concerns and shared information with some of the con attendees. They raised over $100 for charity, which was extra awesome because it was the inaugural event. Preston Hudson, Venture Captain of Northeastern Washington/Idaho, called the event a success and plans on making it an annual item.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Finally, last week saw Tanis and I teamed up with the dynamic duo at Know Direction podcast. It was my first recorded interview and while there were a few technical issues the interview went off without any real problems. If you want the full scoop of what we talked about you can view the whole podcast <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/knowdirection/v/25329901" target="_blank">here</a>. I hope to come back in a few months, this time with the whole PFS Team, to talk about Season 7. While most of the reveals are at the PaizoCon Preview banquet, we may have a few things we can share.</p> 
               <p>This is my 48 day recap and a look to the future. What have you been doing in the past 6 weeks? Has anyone gone to some of the conventions? What about home games? I would love to hear in the comments below!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Do you have a favorite bar? I do. It's called <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, and it's coming your way in prepainted miniature form in January!

               <p>I have not yet revealed the final version of the special limited edition case incentive. I'm happy to correct that now with this amazing image, courtesy of our friends at WizKids:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151113-RustyDragonInn.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151113-RustyDragonInn_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This image includes two complete case incentive sets, plus a lot of figures and some dungeon dressing from the full set. The final piece list for a single case incentive box is:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>3 Long Barfront Sections</li> 
                <li>1 Corner Piece</li> 
                <li>2 Bar Shelf Sections</li> 
                <li>1 Table</li> 
                <li>6 Bottles (2 sets of 3)</li> 
                <li>2 Barrels</li> 
                <li>1 Small Keg</li> 
                <li>4 Stools</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>The table and barrels are alt-deco repaints of the standard table and barrel from the main set. Everything else is a new sculpt unique to the case incentive. I'm very excited about the look of this incentive, and I hope that it will bring life and excitement to your fantasy RPG campaigns.</p> 
               <p>Canny readers will also notice a couple of familiar faces from earlier sets among the assembled crowd in this image—Feiya, Human Witch, and King Irovetti. Both of these figures are intended as replacements for previously released figures that simply did not meet Paizo or WizKids's quality standards.</p> 
               <p>I have confirmed that these two replacement figures will be inserted together randomly into boosters in the set, at an intended rate of 1 pair per brick. These replacements will not replace any figures (the booster they are in will contain 6 figures).</p> 
               <p>Finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about singles, and particularly singles on sale here at paizo.com. For past sets, we have stocked a very large number of single figures for sale on our website. We still have stock on hand for many older figures, allowing customers to pick and choose and to take their time in deciding which specific figures they would like to purchase.</p> 
               <p>Starting with <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, we're changing the way we offer singles for sale on paizo.com. We will have a limited selection of figures available for roughly the first two weeks after release, but following that we will not be offering any singles for sale for this set. You will likely be able to get them from other retailers, if you must, but I want to give an early warning that supply for <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> will likely be significantly lower than in previous sets. No longer will we be offering enough figures to last several years. If you prefer to "pick and choose" your <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> figures, I HIGHLY recommend that you do so as close to the set's official release as possible. I definitely cannot guarantee you will be able to wait and choose. In fact, I can guarantee you that you won't be able to, at least here at Paizo.com.</p> 
               <p>As with previous sets, the best way to ensure that you do not miss a single figure is to <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">set up an ongoing case subscription</a> or <a href="/products/btpy9er4">preorder a case</a> today.</p> 
               <p>We'll be back next week with a look at more miniatures goodness. For now, it's Friday evening, and I'm headed to the bar for a drink!</p>

Spawn are under the command of the wyrmwraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they become free-willed dread wraiths.

                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Divine Dispelling (Su)</strong> When a wyrmwraith strikes a creature with one of its claws, that creature is also affected by a targeted <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic-greater"><em>greater dispel magic</em></a> (CL ??th) that can dispel only divine spells.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Ectoplasmic Shift (Su)</strong> A wyrmwraith can push through the ectoplasmic veil to temporarily assume a physical form made of ectoplasm. As a swift action, the wyrmwraith can become corporeal for ?d? rounds. It can return to its incorporeal form as a free action. Once its ectoplasmic form’s duration ends, the wyrmwraith can’t assume that form again for ?d? rounds. While in ectoplasmic form, the wyrmwraith loses the incorporeal ability (including its deflection bonus to AC) and gains a +?? natural armor bonus to AC, DR ??/—, a Strength score equal to its Dexterity score, and the phase lurch ability. The AC for a typical wyrmwraith in ectoplasmic form is ??. When in ectoplasmic form, its attacks are <strong>Melee</strong> bite +?? (?d?+?? plus energy drain), 2 claws +??

                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Phase Lurch (Su)</strong> A wyrmwraith in ectoplasmic form can pass through walls or material obstacles. It must begin and end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it’s moving through. It can’t move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Positive Energy Transference (Su)</strong> Whenever a wyrmwraith succeeds at a saving throw to resist positive energy damage but still suffers damage, the wyrmwraith can immediately transfer that damage to any dread wraith spawn of its choice with ?? feet that it controls. The wyrmwraith takes any excess damage beyond the spawn’s hit points. Even if the wyrmwraith has no spawn under its control, when it succeeds at its save against a positive energy effect that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes one quarter damage.</p>

               <p>The Wyrmwraith tore through the Deep Merfolk like me at a sushi bar, crushing it by a 2-to-1 margin to win. With a veritable host of abilities at its disposal, not to mention the ability to phase through solid objects, the Wyrmwraith is a mighty opponent, and not one to trifle with.</p>

                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Easy to Call (Ex)</strong> Sahkils count as having 4 fewer Hit Dice (minimum 2) for purposes of spells or effects that call outsiders, such as planar binding. However, they receive a racial bonus equal to 1/2 their Hit Dice on Charisma checks to break free of <em>planar binding</em> spells and similar effects, and their spell resistance counts as if it were 5 higher for the purpose of breaking free of <em>planar binding</em> spells and similar effects.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Emotional Focus (Ex)</strong> Whenever a sahkil casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability or effect with the emotion<sup>UM</sup> or fear descriptors that allows a saving throw, the DC is increased by 2.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Entangling Train (Su)</strong> Creatures adjacent to a pakalchi must succeed at a DC ?? Reflex save or become entangled in its vines for ? rounds, and count as tethered. Entangled creatures take vine damage automatically each round they’re entangled. Creatures are no longer entangled if the pakalchi moves away. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Look of Fear (Su)</strong> A creature affected by a pakalchi’s gaze is panicked for ? rounds and shaken for ?d? rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is only shaken for ? rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Thorns—injury; <em>save</em> Fort DC ??; <em>frequency</em> ?/round for ? rounds; <em>effect</em> ?d? Wis damage; <em>cure</em> 3 consecutive saves. A creature with Wisdom damage from a pakalchi’s poison hears paranoid whispers warning of betrayal. It can’t treat any other creature as an ally or be a willing target for a spell or effect. This is an emotion<sup>UM</sup> effect.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Skip Between (Su)</strong> Many sahkils can shift between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane as a move action. This ability is otherwise identical to <em>ethereal jaunt</em> (CL ??th).</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Spirit Touch (Ex)</strong> A sahkil’s natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had the <em>ghost touch</em> weapon special ability.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Sudden Strike (Ex)</strong> Once per round, a pakalchi can extend the reach of one claw or thorned vine by ? feet as part of a single attack. It can use this ability to threaten additional squares to cause an enemy to provoke an attack of opportunity.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><strong>Thorns (Ex)</strong> A pakalchi can fling a volley of poisonous thorns as a standard action (make an attack roll for each thorn). This attack has a range of ??? feet with no range increment.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>The power of cute was not strong enough to save the Lotus Leshy, and the Pakalchi Sahkil crushed it with the power of its floral arrangement. Against the Wyrmwraith, the Pakalchi's spirit touch will be a great aid against the incorporeal Wyrmwraith—but will it be enough?</p> 
               <p><strong>Customer Service Representative Diego Valdez</strong>: "No contest, the Wyrmwraith wins. The Pakalchi may not be afraid of the undead, incorporeal, dragon because it is immune to fear, but it should be. <em>It should be</em>. A bit of damage resistance barely slows down a dragons jaws."</p> 
               <p><strong>Designer Mark Seifter</strong>: "The pakalchi might have barely knocked off the lotus leshy, but she’s bitten off more than she can chew with the wyrmwraith. As she unloads her attacks against her foe, she finds that it’s basically immune to her entire repertoire, from fear, to mind control, to poison. Bet she wishes she hadn’t given up on that whole psychopomp thing now; she might once have been a morrigna, and then she would have stood a better chance against undead. The best thing she can do here is step between to run away and forfeit the match. Meanwhile, the wyrmwraith’s first breath attack has left her enervated and badly hurt. There’s no chance she’ll survive the wyrmwraith's full attack!"</p>

               <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Jen "Iammars" McTeague, and I like tinkering with board games. It's very rare that I get heavily invested into a board game and don't end up tinkering with it. You may have seen some of my work with Mansions of Madness (<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/72193/completing-circle-fan-made-scenario" target="_blank">seen here</a> and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/77864/chromatic-crackpot" target="_blank">here</a>, which led to a consulting gig with FFG on its <a href="/products/btpy8v5y?Mansions-of-Madness-Call-of-the-Wild-Expansion" target="_blank">Call of the Wild</a> expansion. Since I've recently become addicted to the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, I've been looking at it with an eye toward writing material and tinkering with it.</p> 
               <p>Everyone has a favorite monster or two—it's hard to play this game (or any RPG) for too long before you settle on the monster or two that you <i>really</i> like fighting. And for me, there's one monster that stands out above the rest. It's pictured just below these words. Why don't you go and click on it and bask in its great glory?</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ShadowDemon.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-PR-PigFromHell_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Aw... Look at the cute fire-breathing pig!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>BAM! Shadow Demon! Bet you didn't see that one coming! And that's the beauty of a shadow demon. You don't know he's there at first, but then suddenly people start disappearing, outsiders know all of your battle plans, and friends start turning on each other. Once it's obvious that the havoc is coming from inside the house, the scenario becomes a witch hunt as you interrogate your allies, trying to get them to screw up. Those who aren't as friendly with you may take your questioning as a challenge and come to blows. In the end, you find the "traitor" only to have a black smoky form come out as its flesh puppet falls unconscious, cackling at all the chaos it has caused.</p> 
               <p>If you're only familiar with PACG Shadow Demons, you may be wondering where this is coming from, since card-game shadow demons can't actually do this. Well, that's the thing. In the PACG, they're vanilla incorporeal servitor demons that do a bit of damage if you're in an Abyssal location, while in the Pathfinder RPG, <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/demon.html#demon-shadow">they're super cool</a>. I think these guys deserve to have their time in the sun—let's put them center stage in their own scenario!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ShadowDemon.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ShadowDemon_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Maybe "time in the sun" wasn't the best choice of words...</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Now that I've gotten my impassioned rant in defense of shadow demons out of the way, let's determine what we want the scenario to do, stripping it down to the important points:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>Chaos is being caused inside friendly lines</li> 
                <li>We interrogate various allies to figure out who is causing the problem</li> 
                <li>Once we find the possessed soldier, exorcise and defeat the shadow demon.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>That first point can be modeled by choosing locations that are mostly friendly, but have a decent number of monsters. The final point can partially be covered by making the Shadow Demon a villain, but we need it to not show up until we've beaten its host. To solve the middle point, we'd really like a henchman that can defeated by either Diplomacy or Combat, and we'd really like one of the henchmen to spawn our Shadow Demon at some point.</p> 
               <p>Looking at those points, we can start to lock down some parameters about the scenario. The Shadow Demon needs a Combat 20 to defeat, which puts it on the higher end of the Adventure Deck 2 villains, which means that this likely wants to be an AD2 scenario. (It's certainly much closer to AD2 than AD3, and the only part of the demon's powers that make the check harder is requiring the Magic trait. That's not trivial in AD2, but it's not hard either.) At this point in the game's power curve, the only henchman that has both a Diplomacy and a Combat check to defeat is the Corrupted Soldier. Since there's only one of him in the box, we'll have to use a proxy, much like the <a href="/pfsacg">Adventure Card Guild</a> scenarios. It's ugly, but it'll do. <i>[Tanis: Welcome to my world.]</i></p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-CorruptedSoldier.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-CorruptedSoldier_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-CorruptedSoldier.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-CorruptedSoldier_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ShadowDemon.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-CorruptedSoldier_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>It's like a shell game, but if you lose, hundreds of people die.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Spawning the Shadow Demon is going to have to be part of the scenario mechanics, since there's no other place to put it. What we want is a way to randomly pick which one of the Corrupted Soldiers in the scenario is actually a Shadow Demon. Whatever method we devise must not fail to produce a Shadow Demon if all the Corrupted Soldiers are encountered and defeated, which means we'd prefer a random event that was dependent on previous events (such drawing cards from a pile without replacement) as opposed to an independent event (such as a die roll). Stack of cards it is then!</p> 
               <p>If we place one Corrupted Soldier in each location, we need a stack of cards with 1 Shadow Demon and (# of locations - 1) other cards. When we defeat a Corrupted Soldier, we flip a card from the stack. If it's a Shadow Demon, then we shuffle it into the deck of the Corrupted Soldier we just defeated. If it's not, then maybe we banish the card to the box and we can attempt to close the location as usual. While I was brainstorming and writing the scenario, the extra cards were blessings. As I wrote up the scenario for initial playtesting, they became allies that you automatically acquired for a couple of reasons. First, having a second deck that mostly consisted of blessings next to the scenario card sounded confusing. The second reason was thematic. Shadow Demons are all about confusing you as to who your allies are. Gaining an ally when you defeat a Corrupted Soldier reinforces the idea that you are eliminating the ally as a suspect for the demonic possession. This does mean that it's possible that your crusader ally was a Wolf all along, but that's funny and I stopped worrying about being 100% thematic every time a bell fell on me in the Forest during Rise of the Runelords.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-FallingBell.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-FallingBell_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>I assure you, it made a sound.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>At this point, we have the meat of the scenario written down and we're just filling in details. Locations are the biggest detail we haven't filled in yet. We want locations that have positive or neutral benefits for the characters, but still have monsters in their deck lists, and we want locations from Adventure Deck 2 or lower. That leads us to Cathedral of St. Clydwell, Citadel, Dark Forest, Laboratory, Watchtower, Defender's Heart, Tower of Estrod, Celestial Beacon, and Paradise Hill. Of these, Defender's Heart and Citadel both play on the allies theme we've got going on and will definitely see use in the scenario, whereas Cathedral of St. Clydwell and Paradise Hill will definitely not see play, given how powerfully friendly they are. Most location picking is more art than science, guided by the idea that this is your base that's being assaulted.</p> 
               <p>Finally, our reward. As an optional scenario for an Adventure Path, we can't have this give out a feat, as that would throw power levels in later scenarios out of whack. (Well, not by much in Wrath, but still.) Since we're borrowing a trick from the Adventure Card Guild in scenario setup, we're going to do it again in the scenario reward. The scenario has given you an ally for all but 1 of the Corrupted Soldiers you defeated, which is already pretty strong. We could give another ally for completion, but that's boring. Instead, let's grant a cohort for use in a later scenario. <i>[Tanis: In published designs, we avoid asking you to remember something for a later scenario; we call this "the memory issue."]</i> Luckily we have the world's first and foremost expert on shadow demons available to us: Sir Ilivan!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-SirIlivan.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-SirIlivan_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Confused? Play Adventure 2!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Well, that's the basic design done. Now comes writing everything up so that other people can read it. I try to word things as best I can before playtesting to give myself an extra editing pass. I went through multiple iterations to make it clearer, and I had to change the proxy card when I realized that I would need 8 Corrupted Soldiers but only had 7 Cultists of Baphomet.</p> 
               <p>No scenario is complete without playtesting. One thing that my playtesting showed was that when you put that many ally-heavy locations in the scenario, the locations get closed really quickly—perhaps a little quicker than I'd like. I don't really have any room on the scenario card to adjust anything, so I needed to swap a few locations. The Cemetery replaced the Laboratory, and the Gray Garrison replaced the Watchtower. Fortunately, the core of the scenario worked fine. Which leaves us with this:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO60XX-FriendsAndEnemies.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO60XX-FriendsAndEnemies_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO60XX-FriendsAndEnemies2.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO60XX-FriendsAndEnemies2_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>[Vic: Even after tightening up the text, the art box on this card is a little bit smaller than we like in a printed product. It's hard to make scenarios that fit in the allowed space!]</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Well, that about wraps up this article. I hope you enjoyed a look at one person's methods of adapting a RPG situation to the PACG, and a glimpse at how rough a Shadow Demon can actually be.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">November is upon us again, which means it's time to release a new evergreen mission for the latest crop of wide-eyed <a href="/pathfindersociety">Pathfinder Society</a> agents. These low-level, replayable scenarios are designed for new players and veteran players alike. For new players, they include context and pointers for the PCs on a level that would feel out of place in a 1–5 scenario, with 5th level characters receiving advice meant for trainees. They are evergreen, tied to the Pathfinder Society's mission as a whole, so they stay relevant and focus on the information that is useful background regardless of the season. For our most prolific players, replayable scenarios are a way to bring characters through level 1 without expending the limited resource of scenarios they have not yet played. We expect that some people will play an evergreen scenario many times, and so it's important that we make sure that the scenario has surprises in store for people on their 5th playthrough. The replayable scenarios have randomized elements and other GM options to introduce variety and support multiple approaches that the PCs might take. With each replayable scenario (including this month's new release), we've increased the number of ways that the GM and players can customize their experience. My favorite part of evergreen scenarios is the way that they bring new players and experienced players together. Anyone can grab a first level pregen, pull up a chair, and join in.</p>

               <p>People often ask how the "replayable" part of replayable scenarios works. If you were wondering that too, check out the spoiler below.</p>

                <div class="spoiler-text"> 
                 <p>A player can play a replayable scenario an unlimited number of times with 1st-level characters, and once with a 2nd-level character. Similarly, a GM can apply credit for a running a replayable scenario multiple times to as many of her 1st-level characters as she likes, and she can apply credit to a 2nd-level character once.</p>
                </div>
               </div> 
               <p>Our first replayable scenarios were the scenarios of the <a href="/products/btpy8jor"><em>First Steps</em></a> trilogy. With the shake-ups to the factions that have happened since then, the <em>First Steps</em> trilogy became a bit dated, and there was widespread sentiment that three scenarios was a bit long for our spotlight introduction to the game. That being said, we have heard the feedback that people would like to see First Steps Parts 2 and 3 unretired, and we are looking into that idea as a team.</p> 
               <p>Two years ago, we released <a href="/products/btpy92ci"><em>The Confirmation</em></a>, a mission that takes trainee Pathfinders out of the heart of Absalom on a journey to prove themselves that is far too dangerous for one agent to handle alone. The following year, we released a new 1-2 evergreen scenario, <a href="/products/btpy9a1y"><em> The Wounded Wisp</em></a>. In the <em>Wounded Wisp</em>, the PCs travel all over Absalom to unlock a mystery from the Society's earliest years. In the process, they uncover information that is particularly relevant to a story arc in Season 6.</p> 
               <div style="margin-bottom: 2px;">
                <b>To keep this scenario fresh, we've released an update</b> 
                <input type="button" value="Show" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)">
                <div class="spoiler-text"> 
                 <p>The update is to the secret journals that the PCs uncover at the end of the adventure, which reveals some of the secrets of an upcoming Season 7 scenario. We know that some people may prefer to use the existing handout to foreshadow events in Season 6, so rather than replacing the handout in the scenario itself, we've added a new file to the scenario download that includes both the Season 6 information and the Season 7 information. We will be updating this handout each season with more secrets for your beginning Pathfinders to discover.</p>

               <p>This month's new evergreen, the <a href="/products/btpy9hgx/"><em>The Consortium Compact</em></a>, pits the PCs against one of the Society's time-honored rivals—the Aspis Consortium. With the help of insider information, the PCs have the chance to pull the rug out from under the Aspis and stop them from carrying out a reprehensible plot.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Today I've got the final three figure previews for January's <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set of prepainted plastic <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a>, and by a happy coincidence, it's easy to use all three to create a mini-encounter set in the hold of a ship! Two of these items are "dungeon dressing," while the third is an oft-requested character that I consider one of the strangest figures we've done to date. Let's take a look!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Crate.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Crate_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>First up this week is the Crate. It's a crate. WizKids has added a nice ink wash to pull out the wooden details here, and if you can somehow figure out how to get a bunch of them (I suspect—but do not know for sure—that there will be as many as 2 per case), you'll be able to create a cool warehouse scene, or dress up a basement, a bandit lair, or just about any encounter with some handy terrain. The Crate fits nicely on the Wagon and Cart figures that also fill out the "dungeon dressing" offerings in <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, so while it's a simple "wooden" box, there's a lot of versatility here that I suspect will make the Crate a popular piece.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Barrels.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Barrels_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Next we have the Barrel. It's a barrel. Very much in place at an inn or a tavern, the Barrel is another versatile piece of dungeon dressing I've been trying to get into a set since the idea of terrain pieces first crossed our mind about a year ago. Is it filled with booze? Explosives? I dunno! That's up to you!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Ranzak.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Ranzak_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Last up this week is the perfect accompaniment for crates and barrels in a ship's cargo hold, Ranzak, the goblin pirate! First introduced as a <a href="/products/btpy96ie">playable goblin character</a> in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, Ranzak is a delightfully psychotic little wretch who has been demanding representation in <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> almost since the day he was created. Seriously. Dude has been carving his name into my office door with his hook hand. He's very ill-behaved. This, of course, makes him a great addition to a Pathfinder campaign, whether at the head of a group of goblin scallywags, or as a unique "oddball" crewmember for the party's next ocean voyage. Ranzak is a Small, rare figure.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> previews! We've significantly revised (for the better) the bar case incentive for the set, and between now and next Friday I hope to get new shots to show off the increased size and versatility of the set.</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain...</p>

               <p>In all seriousness, my working title for this product when outline it was "nice things for martials," and a note with that phrase sat on my monitor as a guiding principle through the project's development. Weapon-focused characters don't generally need help hitting foes or dealing damage, but they can find themselves with fewer options to just be interesting in new and unexpected ways. Given the breadth of history in Golarion there are lots of opportunities for sword-swingers and axe-hurlers to learn surprising techniques not available to run-of-the-mill warriors, and this book highlights the ones we thought were the most exciting.</p>

               <p>Mortal flesh meant immortal doom for the Twilight Pitri Manasaputra, and the Deep Merfolk triumphed, though not as overwhelmingly so. The outcome of this match-up between the Wyrmwraith and the Deep Merfolk is going to be in the dark—after all, they are rather sensitive to the light...</p> 
               <p><strong>Accountant Ashley Kaprielian</strong>: "Two creatures of darkness enter this battle. Will the Wyrmwraith’s hate light the way to the merfolk’s demise? Or will the merfolk lead the Wyrmwraith down a false path and give it what it needs the most—the end of its undead existence."</p> 
               <p><strong>Customer Service Representative Diego Valdez</strong>: "A giant green, glowing, skeleton dragon!? Good thing merfolk are good swimmers! I bet undead dragons aren’t bad swimmers themselves though, what with the being undead and not needing to breathe. Goodbye Deep Merfolk!"</p> 
               <p><strong>Designer Mark Seifter</strong>: "It looks like the Deep Merfolk is trying to use its semitransparency ability to hide, but the Wyrmwraith’s lifesense gives it the advantage. While the Deep Merfolk might still manage to get in a lucky sneak attack, all the Wyrmwraith has to do is change from ectoplasmic to incorporeal form for a sure victory."</p>

               <p>The Lotus Leshy won out against the Roiling Oil, and is now head to head against the Pakalchi Sahkil—it's a Battle of the Flowers! The sahkil's poison won't affect the leshy, but will the leshy's aura be enough to deny the sahkil?</p> 
               <p><strong>Ashley</strong>: "This leshy might be small, but it could be the only thing able to sooth the nightmare of this Pakalchi into a sweet dream. The Pakalchi’s thorny vines might squeeze all of the hope out of our little leshy before that’s possible though. This will be a knock-down, drag-out fight between the breaker and the unbroken!"</p> 
               <p><strong>Diego</strong>: "The Pakalchi has those terrifying vines with all the thorns, but really, look at the Leshy. Can even an NE creature bring itself to tear apart something that adorable!? While the Pakalchi is cooing at the cuteness, the Leshy will serenely tear it to bits."</p> 
               <p><strong>Mark</strong>: "The pakalchi is a terror in more ways than one, but the leshy is proving a thorn in her side. The cute contemplative is immune to her fear aura and dominate power, and so it's keeping its distance from her entangling train, dealing with the minor damage from her ranged thorns and pelting her with dream pollen. Eventually she’s going to fall asleep, so I’m tentatively calling this one for the leshy!”</p>

Here's a look at each location discussed in the book's second chapter:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <h3>Center for Psychogenic Advancement</h3> 
                <p>This remarkable university is one of the crown jewels of Hermea's capital city of Promise. Through careful study, experimentation, and practice, the center's faculty and staff hope not only to unlock the secrets and powers of the mind, but also to discover the catalyst for a new stage of human development. Critics believe that graduates use their honed psychic abilities to spy on other Hermeans; the center's administration firmly denies this accusation. The PCs can find the center's mysteries unravel before them while probing the disappearances of people with psychic talents across the Inner Sea region. The truth is that the missing individuals were invited to attend classes at the center. Some have even since reappeared, but their memory of the time they spent missing is altered, leaving the PCs to discover what is exactly going on and why.</p> 
                <h3>Denebrum</h3> 
                <p>Lurking deep in the Darklands region of Orv, Denebrum is home to the neothelids, a species as ancient as the Vault Builders who supposedly created that forbidding realm. How the neothelids came to exist here is a mystery, but legends suggest they burrowed into this area from beyond the Dimension of Dreams, or perhaps even from the nightmare realm of Leng. Whatever the truth, the neothelids continue to meticulously carry out numerous complex plots designed to bring them to the pinnacle of power so that they might rule all of Golarion, as they believe is their right. PCs can find themselves entangled in the neothelids' plotting when investigating a squabble in Korvosa among the Sczarni, various professional guilds, and other legitimate organizations. All threads lead to a vicious worm that walks, who leads them deep beneath the surface to neothelids whose plans to subjugate Korvosa have been in motion for centuries.</p>

                 <br> <i>Illustration by Vavilov Konstantin</i>
                </div> 
                <h3>Grand Sarret</h3> 
                <p>Once the summer retreat of Vudrani nobility, most believe that this remote island in Jalmeray is abandoned, its palace in ruins. In truth, the carefully maintained air of disrepair cloaks one of Golarion's most elite educational institutions: the Conservatory, where spies are trained to infiltrate the world's courts, governments, and other centers of power. After graduation, the spies are provided with cover identities as nobles, bards, seneschals, and consorts, and sent forth to further Jalmeray's interests through covert means. PCs can get an introduction to the Conservatory when investigating a traveling sage who visits Magnimar, calling himself the Master of the Third Eye, after a woman complains that he has taken control of her husband's mind.</p> 
                <h3>Temple of the Sunken Sign</h3> 
                <p>In the drowned swamps and jungles of the Sodden Lands, hidden among the ruins of a complex built by the ancient Ghol-Gan cyclopes, the Temple of the Sunken Sign twists the legacy of the lost kingdom of Lirgen with the insanity of an ancient cult of Azathoth. The maddened sect of Saoc Brethren who dwell here point their telescopes toward the stars, work corrupt rites, and wait to become one with their unspeakably alien patron. On the streets of Sothis, a crazed seer babbles about the coming of the darkness, and her family asks the PCs to investigate how a sedate, well-respected member of Osirian society became a wild-eyed prophet after participating in an archaeological expedition to the Sodden Lands.</p> 
                <h3>Vergan Forest</h3> 
                <p>Fifty years ago, this dark and musty region served as cover for guerilla forces loyal to the powerful wizard Razmir while he conquered the region—and mercilessly slaughtered those who refused to bend their knees. Today, those unquiet souls infuse the Vergan Forest with latent psychic power with which is primary inhabitants must contend. Razmiri dissidents and anarchists alike now use the forest to hide from authorities, but they are not alone; also lurking in the forest are driders, giant vermin, assorted undead, and a terrible ancient power that could bring ruin upon the whole region. A paranoid scholar in Thronestep hires the PCs to stop the ancient power's escape from a cave deep within the forest. However, things are complicated when it turns out that a band of rogues and their Razmiri prisoner already inhabit the cave—and that the being's machinations may be too advanced to stop without paying a terrible price.</p> 
                <h3>Zi Ha</h3> 
                <p>The samsaran nation of Zi Ha, perched upon the remote peaks of one of Tian Xia's mountain ranges, is an alluring mystery to scholars. To visitors, it is a place of serenity and meditation, where one can gaze out on pristine vistas and discuss the mysteries of reincarnation with one's samsaran host over a warm cup of tea. For the human children of its residents, it is a reminder of the parents who cast them off in order to contemplate their quest for enlightenment. When a powerful spellcaster hires the PCs to escort her into the dangerous mountains of Zi Ha and help her track the parents who abandoned her as an infant, the adventurers are unwittingly drawn into a tragic knot of broken family ties and vengeance that endures across lives and generations.</p>

                <br> <i>"Can do! Can do!" This forum says the horse "can do."</i>
               </div> 
               <p>After listening to all sides of the debate for several months, we decided to make a change. As of <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9u1q">today's post</a> on the <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4">Wrath FAQ</a>, the power has been rewritten as "Recharge <i>a weapon or an armor</i> (▢ or put it on top of your deck) to search your deck or discard pile for a card that has the Mount trait and add it to your hand." That slows Alain down, though not so much that he doesn't get anything out of the power.</p> 
               <p>Similarly, we saw <a href="/threads/rzs2szf2">an exploit with Imrijka</a> that we didn't like much either. So we <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9u1o">fixed that too</a>. That only took us a month to consider.</p> 
               <p>"Wait," you say, "did you say '<i>only</i> a month?'" Uh-huh. Sometimes we don't make changes until months after we see the first signs of a problem—usually after Vic writes a quick response that starts with the word "Sigh." We don't panic, because you guys are smart. We expect you to make it through house-ruling it your own way, obeying the social contract while you prompt us for answers. We're not coming to your house and writing on your cards.</p> 
               <p>Instead, we begin a process. Some people don't understand why it takes as long as it does. The reason is that unlike the rulebook—which we've committed to being a living, breathing, evolving document—our cards don't just update themselves. There's a real overhead to errata that you, the player, have to hold in your head. So we don't change something unless we need to. And when we do, there are several types of FAQ entries we could write. We treat them very differently from each other. Here they are.</p> 
               <h2>Type 1: It's So Trivial, We're Not Even Gonna Mention It</h2> 
               <p>We have several human beings that proof our cards. Human beings miss things. Usually pretty trivial things. So maybe we forget how to spell the name Eustoyriax midway through editing an adventure or even a single card. Or maybe there's this extremely little problem on Infinite Rod.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-GauntletOfRuin.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-GauntletOfRuin_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-Eustoyriax.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-Eustoyriax_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-InfiniteRod.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-InfiniteRod_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Eustoyriax is happy to to see you.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>See that line "You may discard this card to to add 2 dice to any check to defeat a barrier?" You can probably see the double "to" glaring you in the face now. Well, we didn't see that when we were proofing. So when I did spot it, we just fixed it in our file and never mentioned it on the <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4">Wrath FAQ page</a>. When we fix mistakes that have no meaningful impact on the game itself, we don't feel a need to bring it up. But if we ever print that card again, it'll be correct.</p> 
               <h2>Type 2: It's Dumb, but Meaningful, and We Should Just Fix It</h2> 
               <p>Sometimes we just bollix up some words. We might <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9tzn">banish a card we mean to discard</a>, for example, or <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9tzq">call something an Item</a> when we meant an Object. An easy example is <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gk#v5748eaic9tye">the Horsechopper +1 entry</a>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-PR-Horsechopper.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-PR-Horsechopper_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Seems like something got chopped.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>We forgot the Polearm trait. Since Raz and Tontelizi have powers that care about the Polearm trait, it's a meaningful omission. It's an easy fix, so we make it as soon as we can. If the card has already been released, we do it right away, and if the card isn't out yet, we put it in a queue to add to the FAQ on release. (The "change the Item trait to the Object trait" entry was in the queue for seven months before the cards it affected were released.)</p> 
               <p>Quite honestly, we hate these things. There shouldn't be any of them. But we have thousands of cards, and we screw up some words sometimes. When we mess up, we fess up.</p> 
               <h2>Type 3: It's Bizarre and Maybe We Should Fix It</h2> 
               <p>With thousands of cards, we try hard to see how they will all interact. Sometimes you guys find things that surprise us. Really strange things.</p> 
               <p>Another <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gk#v5748eaic9u1n">errata we issued today</a> was for <a href="/products/btpy921l"><em>Rise of the Runelords Adventure 4—Fortress of the Stone Giants</em></a>. A <a href="/threads/rzs2s4nu">particularly bizarre combination of cards</a>—the scenario The Ancient Library, the henchman The Headless Lord, and Kyra's Fireflower role in the <a href="/products/btpy97ia"><em>Cleric Class Deck</em></a>—produces a situation where, if you can defeat the Headless Lord with a weapon that has the Sword trait, you might be able to put all the armor from the game box into your deck.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-Kyra.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-Kyra_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-AncientLibrary.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-AncientLibrary_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-HeadlessLord.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-HeadlessLord_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Miss Kyra in the Library with the Sword.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>This is the kind of thing we have to think about before acting. We'll consider how likely it is to occur, how damaging it is, and how much fun it sucks out of the game. In this particular case, we almost didn't make the change. But then we looked at some of the armor that's showing up in our class decks and realized that's not something we want to see just pop into your hand. So we killed it.</p> 
               <p>But then sometimes we don't. An unthinkable card combo made us question what would happen if you Disintegrated the undefeatable dragon turtle henchman Hirgenzosk in the scenario Into the Runeforge—which, y'know, is never gonna happen—and we figured that wouldn't ever get to the step of shuffling Hirgy into his location deck, but then we had to look at the Jorgenfist Stone Giant, which also worked and then we—man, even I'm confused. Anyway, it all worked as intended so we left it alone because for criminy's sake, we have better things to do with our days.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Hirgenzosk.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Hirgenzosk_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Disintegrate.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Disintegrate_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6006-IntoTheEye.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6006-IntoTheEye_120.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <h2>Type 4: It's Bad and We Know How to Fix It, So We Will</h2> 
               <p>By far, the largest number of entries in the FAQ are clarifications, not corrections. They come from us not completely understanding what you will do when you read what we wrote. Here's a recent example, once again about cards that have the Mount trait.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-RidingHorse.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-RidingHorse_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-Griffon.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-Griffon_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-DireGriffon.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-DireGriffon_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>All aboard! No, really, all aboard.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>These four-legged friends seemed fine to us. But you guys <a href="/threads/rzs2sd9p">thought</a> they <i>required</i> another character to move with you for you to use their power. We didn't want that, so we quickly came up with another wording: "Discard this card at the end of your turn to move; you may also move another character at your location to your new location." We applied that to all the cards as soon as they came out.</p> 
               <p>If only it was always that easy.</p> 
               <h2>Type 5: It's Bad, but We Don't Know How to Fix It, So We'll See What We Can Do</h2> 
               <p>This category includes the majority of the issues that are still open in our bug tracking database. (Yep—we deal with these issues <i>exactly</i> the same way that software developers track bugs.) Sometimes the discussion goes on for a while. We know something has to change, but changing it could cause other problems. So we keep working on it until we have an ironclad answer.</p> 
               <p>We're still trying to figure out what happens when you <a href="/threads/rzs2sb6g">fail to defeat a villain at the Abyssal Rift</a>. We're still dealing with ripple effects from <a href="/threads/rzs2s9kb">Fringes of the Eye</a> and <a href="/threads/rzs2rsrq">Teleportation Chamber</a>. The spell <a href="/blog/v5748dyo5lhqs&amp;page=2?The-Big-Reveal-Demons-Heresy#51">Steal Soul</a> might be causing us to look at all of our Golem monsters all over again. And so on.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-AbyssalRift.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-AbyssalRift_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-FringesOfTheEye.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-FringesOfTheEye_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6014-TeleportationChamber.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6014-TeleportationChamber_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6809-StealSoul.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6809-StealSoul_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Y'all are working my one good nerve.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>There's always something vexing us. Don't worry. We'll eventually figure it out. But it can take months. Sometimes, issues that seem small have bigger effects on things we're working on for future sets, so we have to consider (and sometimes redesign) piles of cards you haven't seen yet before we consider the problem solved. A few of these issues have been open for over a year, and a few of them have been closed and reopened more times than I care to remember. Big games can have lots of little holes.</p> 
               <h2>Type 6: It Wasn't Broken Until We Fixed Something Else, and Now We Have to Deal With It</h2> 
               <p>We used to think the powers box wasn't something you'd ever need to look at when you played the Runelords spell Summon Monster. You'd just pull a monster out, look at its difficulty, and throw it at whatever you were facing. But then it became clear that <a href="/threads/rzs2rhtq">the Veteran trait might matter</a>. If you pulled out a Mercenary in Adventure 6, you wouldn't want him to have a difficulty of 10. And what if you pulled out a Giant when the Giant Lair was in play? We needed to address that in the rules.</p> 
               <p>So we made a rule that made "passive" difficulty mods work—that is, not those that happened before, while, or after you acted. That ruling was nice and clean, but <i>every single Lycanthrope</i> was worded in a way that didn't work with this change. And that meant there were now eight cards to errata. So we did it in <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gu#v5748eaic9sqa">one sweeping FAQ entry</a>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6005-SummonMonster.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6005-SummonMonster_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-WerecrodileOld.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-WerecrodileOld_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-WerecrodileNew.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-WerecrodileNew_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Gaby just grinned and doesn't know why.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>These sorts of changes are likely to become more common as the game becomes deeper. For example, we're going to put the Electricity trait on Lightning Elemental and Comozant Wyrd from Skull &amp; Shackles, and it isn't because there's anything wrong with that set. It's because it will matter next year when Mummy's Mask comes out. It will matter a lot.</p> 
               <h2>Type 7: It's Bad, but The Real Problem is Something Else</h2> 
               <p>This is a tough type of problem. Players think they have found a problem, but the thing that they think is at fault is working just fine. It's something else buried in the system that doesn't work, and we need to figure out what.</p> 
               <p>At the risk of causing some cardiac events, let's talk about The Elven Entanglement. It's probably your least favorite scenario, at least until you beat it. It's part of a very hard set of B scenarios for Wrath prompted by continued statements from players that the B scenarios in our previous two sets were too easy. So we built a set with a different power curve, one that was hard at the start, but if you beat it, you were well prepared for what was coming your way in adventure 1.</p> 
               <p>The problem was, The Elven Entanglement—the second scenario in the whole game—looked really broken. Nowhere on either the scenario or the henchmen was there a way to close a location. That meant winning the scenario was super-difficult. So people assumed we meant for the Tangle Traps to have "close the location" text, but we didn't. We intended the Tangle Traps to be "passive" henchmen; they're just vines, so they don't let you close the location. The problem wasn't with them. It was with the cohort Vinst.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ElvenEntanglement.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ElvenEntanglement_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-TangleTrap.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-TangleTrap_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Vinst.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Vinst_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>All tangled up.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The intent here was that you couldn't close the locations the normal way. Instead, you'd sacrifice an exploration to fight a Fiendish Tree; if you beat it, your buddy Vinst would show up. If he was around when you beat a Tangle Trap, you could auto-close the location, and then Vinst would scamper away. Rinse, repeat. That would have worked... except Vinst was worded as "When you would <i>attempt</i> to close a location," and that attempt would never happen. So people didn't see the point of Vinst in the scenario and never went for the Tree.</p> 
               <p>It took six months for us to realize what the problem here was. <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9u1r">Now we've fixed it.</a> Enjoy your Fiendish Trees.</p> 
               <h2>Type 8: It's Not Necessarily Bad, but Some People Really Don't Like It</h2> 
               <p>And while we're on that subject, let's address the elephant in the room: Are the B scenarios in Wrath really too hard? Well, some people love the increased peril, and they tell us that we finally gave them the challenge they wanted. But other people hate it; they write about unfairness and random damage. They specifically focus on these three cards.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ArborealBlight.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ArborealBlight_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-CarrionGolem.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-CarrionGolem_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-DemonicHorde.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-DemonicHorde_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Everyone's favorite cards.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>So what to do when some people want one thing and others want another? Well, maybe there's a way we can have our cake and eat it too. We're introducing a new type of errata today: the optional kind. <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9u1s">This entry</a> has a different flavor to it. It offers a set of changes that involve swapping some cards from one deck to another, and yes, maybe even giving Tangle Traps the ability to let you close locations. We're not going to make an errata deck for these cards, because we're not requiring you to play this way. (Also, Vic notes, the "close the location" text won't actually <i>fit</i> on the Tangle Trap card.)</p> 
               <h2>Type 9: It's Bad, but Some People Really Love It</h2> 
               <p>I speak often about the dual approaches to game design being the "dessert bar" approach and the "salad bar" approach. Dessert bar games give you very few impediments to success and are pretty much empty calories. Salad bar games are a lot less sweet for you, but you might actually be around longer if you play them. PACG is obviously a salad bar game.</p> 
               <p>But sometimes we give you too much dessert. In very rare cases, we have to think about "nerfing" something. Nerfing is the process of taking something that is written exactly how we intended but causes a potential power imbalance in the game. It's not something we can just ignore (unlike, say, the asinine Headless Lord thing above), but changing it means actually worsening the play experience for some people. Or at least it means something they've played with won't be the same when they play with it again, and usually "in the house's favor."</p> 
               <p>We've only done this a few times. Our tone is often very different when we make a change like this. For example, <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gk#v5748eaic9rtc">Restoration</a>. We know you don't want to play in a manner that doesn't advance the game at all until you win it in one mirthless sweep. But because of organized play and just general courtesy, we can't let <i>anyone</i> do that. So we nuked it from orbit. <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gv#v5748eaic9ted">Arabundi</a> had a problem like this, and so did <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gv#v5748eaic9sfx">Radillo</a>. We nuked those too. But not till after we spent a long time debating whether we wanted to nerf something that some players enjoyed exploiting and other players enjoyed using as intended.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-Restoration.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-Restoration_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6804-NatureAdept.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6804-NatureAdept_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-ArcaneCollector.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-ArcaneCollector_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>It's nerf or nothin'.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>That brings us back to Alain and Imrijka. After weighing what people were doing in play and then testing them over and over ourselves, we decided the game would be better if people were playing a different way. So Alain can't do all of his mounted shenanigans any more, and Imrijka can't ignore the blessings deck entirely. Those were tough choices, but we made the decisions to nerf them and move on.</p> 
               <p>This won't be the last time we errata something. We've done it before and we hope to have to do it less over time. But whenever we do it, we make sure we're ready to do so before we post anything. Because the last thing we want is someone playing incorrectly because we need to errata our errata.</p> 
               <p>And I want to end on this note. None of this happens without your help. Your posts to the forums have helped us clarify and correct and just really understand the colossal game we've unleashed on the world. Everyone on the design team really appreciates it... even Vic, no matter how often you make him sigh.</p>

                  Art started in the Pathfinder Society at Gen Con 2007. From there, he immediately began organizing conventions and spread PFS to the greater NY area - Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York. After being appointed VC in October 2010, he concentrated on recruiting VCs from Maine to Washington, D.C., leaving him to focus on New York City and surrounding areas. Art received the 5th Campaign Coin, making him Pathfinder Society #705, at Origins. Says Art, "I ran Midnight Mauler as a special so many times I have run it from memory 3 times or more."

                  Dan started playing PFS at Gen Con 2009 and then in the local Pathfinder Society group in Washington, DC. He became the first Venture-Captain of the greater Washington, DC/Northern Virginia/Southern Maryland area in October 2011. When he moved near Baltimore, MD in 2012, he was appointed as the first Venture-Captain for that region. In less than a year, he moved back down to Alexandria, VA and became the VC of Washington, DC again, a post he has held for the past 2.5 years. Dan was awarded my Campaign Coin at PaizoCon 2015, and has attended numerous Gen Cons and PaizoCons, as well as PaizoCon UK in 2014.

He was instrumental in the early growth of the Chicagoland area received a promotion to Venture-Captain in April of 2011. He has since relocated to Central Illinois, where he continues to promote local play, organize regional events, and mentor new Venture-Officers. Bob is one of the original five-star GMs, and has been invaluable in helping to organize some of our largest events including PaizoCon and GenCon. He was awarded a Campaign Service Coin in 2014.

He received a Campaign Service Coin on August 1st, 2015. In describing himself, Jason writes, "I am a guy that just really likes games. My favorite happens to be Pathfinder, so I play it a lot". You may have seen him at conventions—he's the overweight guy with a beard. If you walk up to him at any time, ever (even if you catch him at work) and ask him to play a scenario, he will drop whatever he is doing to join in. Jason enjoys movies, long walks on the beach, and terrifying players by running whatever monstrosity Richard Pett has authored recently.

                  Auke played his first PFS games at GenCon UK 2008 and after two years of flying to foreign conventions to play the game, he decided to set up local play in the Netherlands in 2010. It could be coincidence, but a month after his request for support, the Venture Captain program was announced. He was appointed one of the first thirteen Venture Captains and has made it a habit to meet up with other Pathfinder players from all across the globe. So if you are ever in the Netherlands, send him an email and he'll try to set up a game for you!

                  Dave is a Welshman, not an Englishman, who started GMing Pathfinder Society games when Organized Play was set up in 2008. He convinced enough people to help him create PaizoCon UK in 2009 and it has grown into an international convention. He was selected to be one of the original 13 Venture-Captains in October 2010. As a UK Venture Captain, he has brought Pathfinder Society gaming to various events and encouraged others to take up venture officer roles for England, Scotland and Ireland. Paizo, Inc. recognized Dave as a Volunteer of the Year 2013-14. He continues to GM Pathfinder as often as possible at conventions and also enjoys terrifying GMs by signing up at the last minute to play Pathfinder Society games.

                  Stephen is a proud gaymer involved with RPGs since the early 80s. I first GMed Pathfinder at Free RPG Day in June 2007, and started supporting Pathfinder Society in Season 0 as he traveled Melbourne's con circuit. He GMed at GenConOz the year Jason Bulmahn visited Brisbane to launch the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and when GenConOz cancelled the following year at short notice, I co-organized the first PaizoConOz with Venture-Captain-Sydney Al Rigg. Stephen is one of the 13 original Venture-Captains appointed in October 2010, one of the earliest 5-Star GMs, and in March 2013 became the third recipient of the Campaign Service Coin. Stephen jokes, "Many local players joke that I had been demoted from VC Australia to VC Melbourne with the appointment of VCs in other States, but under their capable stewardship, you'd be unlucky to visit an Australian city and not find somewhere you could enjoy a game of PFS. In the meantime, I believe I've once again inherited the largest geographic PFS region with the inclusion of New Zealand, Singapore, India, East Asia and Hawaii. I'm looking forward to working with VCs in the Asia-Pacific Region, and will of course be campaigning tirelessly for more PFS excursions into Tian Xia, Vudra and... Sarusan!"

               <p>I would also like to recognize the GMs that have earned their 5th star since Gen Con 2015. To qualify as a 5-Star GM, you have to run 150 games, including 10 specials and 50 different scenarios, and run a game observed by a Venture-Officer. It takes many hours to achieve and shows dedication to Pathfinder Society Organized Play. Many congratulations to the following GMs!</p>
