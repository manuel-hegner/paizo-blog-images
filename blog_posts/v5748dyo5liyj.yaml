  \ Time flies when you're having fun! So many little pieces needing to come together,\
  \ but we are well on the way. Fingers flying! Ink splotching! Brains whirring! Watch\
  \ out world!!! Through the combined might of many people here in the office, we\
  \ are on track to get everything done. Hopefully in time for a good night sleep\
  \ before we pack up and make the trek to Indianapolis. A huge thanks to everyone\
  \ here, for getting things done, and to our volunteers that are busily preparing\
  \ all those things for Gen Con. Speaking of volunteers, if your missing anything\
  \ like scenarios, badges, or hotel assignments, let me know asap so we can get you\
  \ taken care of. Let's make it the best four days in gaming!</p> \n    <p>By the\
  \ way, if you haven't gotten tickets yet, there are still some available. Come on\
  \ out, say hi, and play a few games of Pathfinder Society. Ya know you wanna! Hot\
  \ events include the Thursday night and Saturday night Specials, the Adventure Card\
  \ Guild component of our interactive special, and the launch of Season 8. For you\
  \ early risers, or those that just don't go to bed, we are giving an extra prize\
  \ token during our morning slot. All the Pathfinder Society offerings may be found\
  \ at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">gencon.com</a>.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ before Gen Con, I am off to Birmingham, United Kingdom, where I have the privilege\
  \ to attend PaizoCon UK. In fact, tonight is packing and final prep, as I board\
  \ the plane tomorrow. So exited! Not only is it a chance to visit Merry Olde England,\
  \ I get to play Pathfinder while doing it. Publisher Erik Mona is also attending\
  \ and we have some treats for con attendees, including a retired scenario ran by\
  \ <i>moi</i> and the next chapter in the Spire of Nex! If you've ever fancied traveling\
  \ and seeing the world, I recommend you put PaizoCon UK on your radar!</p> \n  \
  \  <p>I would usually have many more words to say, but I've tapped my brain at this\
  \ point working on Guide revisions, packing lists, emails, and all the other tasks\
  \ that go into getting the convention together. As long as I remember to eat, drink,\
  \ and pack my toothbrush, I'll be okay...</p> \n    <p>Next week, John is taking\
  \ us through the last of the Season 7 offerings—<a href=\"/products/btpy9m04\"><em>#7-27:\
  \ Beyond Azlant Ridge</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9m03\"><em>#7-28: Ageless\
  \ Ambitions</em></a>, and the conclusion of the new Seeker Arc—<a href=\"/products/btpy9m02\"\
  ><em>#7-29: All for Immortality, Part 3: Serpents Fall</em></a>. Maybe, if we ask\
  \ really nice, he will give a hint of what is coming up in Season 8!</p> \n    <p>So,\
  \ come one everyone—grab your character, sharpen your pencil, and meet me in Indy!\
  \ Or if you can't make it, find a game near you and post here about your local Pathfinder\
  \ Society activities!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
