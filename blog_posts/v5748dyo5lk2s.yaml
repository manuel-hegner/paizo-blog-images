  ></a>\n   </div> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">The Best 4 Days of PACG</h1> \n\
  \   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, August 24,\
  \ 2017</p> \n    <p>The Paizo and Lone Shark teams just got back from an <del>exhausting</del>\
  \ exhilarating Gen Con, and much Pathfinder Adventure Card Game was played!</p>\
  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We ran our third ACG Open! Our valiant leader,\
  \ Mike Selinker, wove a grand tale called \"The Vampire Devolutions,\" focusing\
  \ on the <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2e\"><em>Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</em></a>\
  \ characters Radovan and Varian, and their would-be nemesis, the vampire Prince\
  \ Kasiya. Thank you to all our teams who made it to the Open! I know our final two\
  \ teams had fun, since I got a chance to chat with them, and we'll put up some pictures\
  \ of our finalists in a future blog post. (In previous years, the Opens had complicated\
  \ designs that made them very difficult to release to the public. This time, the\
  \ Open is much easier to set up and publish. I'm hoping to do a couple minor tweaks,\
  \ then see if we can get it played at a lot more venues after the Tales deck comes\
  \ out next month. Keep an eye out: we don't want to let the vampires win.)</p> \n\
  \    <p>Gen Con also featured our second Adventure Card Guild Interactive Special,\
  \ <em>9-00: Assault on Absalom</em>, kicking off the storyline for Season of Factions'\
  \ Favor. This year's special inextricably wove the Adventure Card Guild and Roleplaying\
  \ Guild together, with each guild tackling many of the same encounters in their\
  \ own fashion, with each contributing jointly to the success of the endeavor. I\
  \ wasn't able to see the Special last year, so I snuck onto a table to see how things\
  \ went. This was a complex event, and there were some hiccups that we hope to improve\
  \ on. That said, when there was an announcement of an achievement and we all got\
  \ to pull extra cards from the box, or another table sent Reinforcements to our\
  \ table, it felt awesome. It's very different playing PACG as a collaboration between\
  \ many (many, many) tables! I encourage you to check it if it comes to a convention\
  \ or game day by you: it's got some great stories and scenarios.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0900E-Reinforcements.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0900E-Reinforcements_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>We've taken cooperation to the next level—or at least to the next\
  \ table.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Season of Factions' Favor also premiered at Gen\
  \ Con, with our fine Pathfinders chasing after one of the villains from Assault\
  \ on Absalom. Your travels take you to Katapesh's harbor city of Okeno, where you\
  \ join up with members of the Liberty's Edge faction to infiltrate a group of slavers.\
  \ Each adventure in this season highlights a different faction within the Pathfinder\
  \ Society, so we've introduced a new type of support card that gets shuffled into\
  \ the blessings deck. Adventure 4-1 is rolling out to Venture Officers and participating\
  \ retailers now, and will be available for sale in mid-September.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0401E-LibertysEdgeFavor.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Wait, you mean <b>good</b> things can happen when we discard a blessing!?</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>After that, we're doing something completely different to support\
  \ our upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o\"><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck\
  \ 1</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjy\"><em>Deck 2</em></a>. The characters\
  \ in Hell's Vengeance are not the nicest kids on the block. They do somewhat mean\
  \ things to their comrades, like play with their discard piles, or discard cards\
  \ from the top of their deck, or maybe they just enjoy standing around drinking\
  \ in the sweet screams of their pain. You know: usual evil stuff. So we're going\
  \ to release some special promo scenarios that help explain why the Pathfinder Society\
  \ might want to work with these characters. On one hand, they're generally evil\
  \ folks, but on the other hand, you're going after some <i>specific</i> evil folks,\
  \ and they're really looking to get their vengeance on. Maybe you can stick together\
  \ for a few adventures, for the greater good. At least till they (predictably) betray\
  \ you.</p> \n    <p>Finally, on Sunday, John Compton, Mike Selinker, and I stumbled\
  \ gamely into the PACG panel to make some announcements and talk to our fans. Unfortunately,\
  \ Vic Wertz—the guardian and keeper who keeps this line sane, wasn't there to help\
  \ out. Fortunately for you, he also wasn't there to keep us in line observing secrecy\
  \ protocols. So what did we let slip?</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>The <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2e\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</em></a> is chock-full of all-new allies, and\
  \ they have some amazing synergies when you get characters from the same Tales together.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>The <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o\"><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck\
  \ 1</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjy\"><em>Deck 2</em></a> characters love\
  \ Corrupted boons like those in Wrath, and benefit from a few unfriendly mechanics\
  \ that synergize well together.</li> \n     <li>The <a href=\"/products/btpy9sxh\"\
  ><em>Hunter Class Deck</em></a> covers the wide spectrum from tree hugging to rampaging\
  \ through nature and includes some hard-to-pronounce savage weaponry, plus dinosaurs\
  \ to ride. Dinosaurs! To! Ride!</li> \n     <li>The <a href=\"/products/btpy9teh\"\
  ><em>Occult Adventures Character Deck 1</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9u08\"\
  ><em>Deck 2</em></a> use some of our most <del>crazy</del> inventive mechanics yet,\
  \ including new awesome uses for Fortitude and Perception and wild mechanics for\
  \ Erasmus and Mavaro.</li> \n     <li><em>Ultimate Combat</em>, <em>Ultimate Magic</em>,\
  \ <em>Ultimate Intrigue</em>, and <em> Ultimate Equipment</em> follow those, and\
  \ are filled to the brim with boons to complement other class decks. The iconic\
  \ characters in these decks are the samurai Hayato, the arcanist Enora, the vigilante\
  \ Aric the Red Raven, and the ninja Reiko.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Terbutje_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>The terbutje. Don't even try to pronounce it. Certainly, don't make\
  \ Mike try.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>That release schedule takes us just about to\
  \ Gen Con 2018. Now, Mike was very clear that these next two products are going\
  \ to take us a while, and they may or may not be ready for that show, and may not\
  \ even appear in 2018 at all. There's still a lot undecided about them. But this\
  \ is what we're playing with now.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>We are looking at a new\
  \ core set that serves as a starter set for every adventure path going forward,\
  \ providing a baseline of banes, boons, and locations that every set (and every\
  \ PFSACG season) needs. We'll be looking to optimize your experience with this set,\
  \ but in no way, shape, or form will it invalidate any existing product.</li> \n\
  \     <li>The first Adventure Path we're working on for that new core set is <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</a>. The Crimson Throne RPG Adventure Path is dear to me, as I've run it\
  \ three times, including a game I ran for PACG designers Chad Brown and Tanis O'Connor,\
  \ and I've been itching to work on a PACG version of it for ages. It's full of Harrowing\
  \ deeds and dire investigations all set in your (morally grey) home base of Korvosa,\
  \ and we'll talk a lot more about it... down the road.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1021_360.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n     <p>They may claim to be the good guys, but Fantasy Rules of Fashion beg\
  \ to differ.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>It was great getting a chance to meet and\
  \ play with some of you at Gen Con, and I'd like to again thank our volunteers and\
  \ Venture Officers for all the work they do to make PACG events happen. Thanks for\
  \ reading, and if you're in Seattle next week, look for our team members at PAX!</p>\
