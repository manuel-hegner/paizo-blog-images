  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Creating a playtest process\
  \ for a game as complicated as Pathfinder has been a challenge unto itself. While\
  \ we knew that we needed robust play data from all of you, which took the form of\
  \ <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, we also wanted to grab wider-ranging feedback based on\
  \ not only your experience at the table, but also your time spent reading the book,\
  \ building characters, and dreaming up new adventures.</p> \n    <p>So, today we're\
  \ launching the first of our Game Feedback Surveys, starting with the Ancestry and\
  \ Backgrounds Survey and the truly massive Class Survey. But before you go rushing\
  \ off to take these surveys, there are a few things you should know.</p> \n    <p>First\
  \ off, you should note that you can take each of these surveys only once, though\
  \ you can choose to leave a survey and come back to complete it later (until we\
  \ close the surveys at the end of the playtest). This might be useful for the Class\
  \ Survey in particular, which is quite lengthy and could be difficult to finish\
  \ in one sitting, and which is also divided into sections for each class.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Second, you don't have to answer every question in these surveys. The Class\
  \ Survey asks you if you want to give feedback on a class before displaying those\
  \ questions, allowing you to skip classes entirely if you find that you don't have\
  \ any feedback on their theme or mechanics. You can also skip questions that you\
  \ find aren't relevant to your experience (although we've tried to provide response\
  \ options for you to clarify this as well).</p> \n    <p>Finally, while you don't\
  \ have to answer every question, it's still important that you go all the way to\
  \ the end of the survey, as there are several important questions that come later\
  \ on.</p> \n    <p>So, if you think you're ready, go on over and take these surveys\
  \ using the following links! We're looking forward to hearing what you think!</p>\

  \ your view on various game mechanics and monster design!</p> \n    <h2>A Note on\
  \ Playtests</h2> \n    <p>Just to recap some of what we talked about on the Paizo\
  \ Twitch stream on Friday, I wanted to take a moment to talk about the playtest\
  \ as a process. Some of you have begun to notice that the <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>\
  \ adventure feels a bit different that the adventures you're used to seeing. This\
  \ is intentionalâ€”each part of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> is specifically designed to\
  \ stress test one or more facets of the game. This means you might see encounters\
  \ with the same theme repeated multiple times at various challenge levels, or that\
  \ every encounter in one part of the adventure might share a common element. It\
  \ might also mean that some of the fights are beyond challenging.</p> \n    <p>Making\
  \ the best version of Pathfinder that we can means finding where the current system\
  \ breaks. In some cases, we need you to do that, so that we can figure out where\
  \ the line actually is. But it's equally important to the data collection process\
  \ that playtesters not know what those goals actually are until the test is over,\
  \ since to do so any other way would bias the results.</p> \n    <p>The design team\
  \ offers our sincerest thanks to everyone for helping us with this rigorous process.\
  \ We promise to pay for resurrections and therapy for your poor PCs when this is\
  \ all over.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p> \n\
