  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The concept of the beginning\
  \ of a year is a bit of a strange one for those of us on the Organized Play team.\
  \ The turning of a year on the calendar is far less prominent in our workflow than\
  \ the beginning of a new season of Organized Play adventures.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ process of making an Organized Play season starts long before we release the first\
  \ hints of its overarching plotline. In fact, the first seeds are often planted\
  \ years in advance, written in the haziest and most tentative of chalk lines as\
  \ developers build in adventure hooks that they’d love to follow up on in the future.\
  \ More formally, though, the planning process begins about 4 months after the start\
  \ of the previous Organized Play year. The developer in charge of the line outlines\
  \ an overarching metaplot, decides roughly how many scenarios it should include,\
  \ and does research into existing products to make sure that their plans fit well\
  \ into the canon. This outline undergoes several rounds of discussion and refinement.\
  \ After it receives approval from all of the stakeholders, we set about giving the\
  \ year its key identifying features: a name, a logo, and a defining piece of art\
  \ to represent it. </p> \n     <p>Once we’ve got a broad sense of what the plan\
  \ for the year is, it’s time to refine it and fit it to the adventure schedule.\
  \ This process starts with making a plan for what levels of adventure should release\
  \ each month. There’s a balancing act between producing more of the broadly accessible\
  \ low-level content that helps to bring experienced and new players together, and\
  \ producing higher-level content that lets dedicated players enjoy their PCs’ growth.\
  \ Levels and story beats work together to help make adventures; the sorts of plots\
  \ that are appropriate for 1st-level PCs are rarely suitable for 8th-level ones,\
  \ and vice versa, so getting a schedule in place requires a dance between these\
  \ two considerations.</p> \n     <p>Another factor we consider when plotting adventures\
  \ is providing diversity of type, theme, and location. In addition to searching\
  \ lists of scenario locations for places we haven’t given a lot of attention, we\
  \ like to mix things up. To name a few of the balances we consider, we look at offering\
  \ both urban and wilderness adventures, both roleplay-heavy adventures where skills\
  \ come to the forefront and combat-focused dungeon crawls, and both scenarios that\
  \ provide unambiguous victories and those that leave dangling hooks for us to pick\
  \ up in the future or pose questions for players to ponder. On top of these considerations,\
  \ we also want to be sure that there are adventures that appeal to PCs in each of\
  \ the major factions. When the metaplot steers us heavily toward particular types\
  \ of scenarios, we use adventures that aren’t part of the metaplot to fill in the\
  \ gaps.</p> \n     <p>For all this planning, though, the digital nature of Organized\
  \ Play adventures gives us significant flexibility. If a developer wants to completely\
  \ change an adventure to respond to unexpected data from reporting conditions, or\
  \ goes on a walk and comes back with a great story idea, then there’s plenty of\
  \ room to adjust. If an author comes up with an amazing NPC that would make a compelling\
  \ recurring character, we have space to make that happen. With no printer deadlines\
  \ to worry about, nothing is canon until the first PDF hits a fan’s inbox, and we\
  \ make the most of that potential.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
