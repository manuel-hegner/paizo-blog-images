  \ No Pathfinder class more exemplifies this truth than the champion, whose sacrifices\
  \ for her beliefs bring her incredible power, and no character better embodies the\
  \ spirit of a champion than Seelah, the iconic paladin. Enjoy the following piece\
  \ of short fiction from James L. Sutter in the next entry into our series of Iconic\
  \ Encounters—brief vignettes of the iconic characters showcasing the myriad stories\

  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>The spirit in Seelah's blade sang, an angelic chorus\
  \ that only she could hear. It surged triumphantly as she blocked another devil's\
  \ glaive strike, paeans like invisible hands supporting her weary sword arm.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Around her, Hell seethed, its flaming pits and spiked chains everything\
  \ the canon had described. Blistering winds heated her armor until it burned like\
  \ a brand wherever metal touched exposed skin. Blood ran freely from dozens of cuts,\
  \ the last of her strength trickling from infernal wounds that refused to clot.\
  \ She was tired—so, so tired.</p> \n      <p>But there could be no rest. No retreat.\
  \ Just ahead, Merisiel's unconscious body bobbed as if floating on a sea of devils.\
  \ Seelah wasn't about to abandon the elf, even if it meant her own death.</p> \n\
  \      <p>After all, she'd followed her friends into Hell itself—compared to that,\
  \ what was one more battle?</p> \n      <p>She grinned fiercely at the thought and\
  \ shoved forward, knocking another wicked glaive aside with her shield. Above a\
  \ beard of writhing barbs, the devil's eyes widened.</p> \n      <p>\"Iomedae!\"\
  \ Seelah screamed and slammed her sword into the devil's chest.</p> \n      <p>Light\
  \ burst from the strike, flowing over the devil in radiant fire. It stumbled sideways,\
  \ skin flaking and disintegrating into holy illumination. The goddess's power clung\
  \ to the fiend like honey as Seelah moved past it, striking left and right with\
  \ righteous fury, making one last push to reach her friend.</p> \n      <p>The devils\
  \ carrying Merisiel saw the paladin coming, their fellows falling like wheat before\
  \ the reaper as she carved a path to them.</p> \n      <p>The one holding the elf's\
  \ feet dropped them. Snarling something in the tongue of the damned, it raised its\
  \ glaive, reversed it, and slammed the point home into Merisiel's chest.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Or tried to. As the blade descended, light shot from the crossguard of\
  \ Seelah's sword, sliding between the murderous glaive and Merisiel's undefended\
  \ chest to wrap the elf in a paper-thin shield of blazing glory. The glaive's tip\
  \ slid sideways.</p> \n      <p>The devil looked up just in time to see Seelah's\
  \ blade scythe in. Severed beard-tendrils scattered as the devil's head left its\
  \ shoulders, bouncing down the endless steps toward the flaming chasm that had spawned\
  \ it.</p> \n      <p>It was enough. The other devils broke at last, dropping Merisiel's\
  \ body and scrambling up the steps toward the safety of their blackened keep.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Seelah knelt, putting a radiant hand to Merisiel's chest. The elf's\
  \ eyes flickered open.</p> \n      <p>\"Seelah?\" Merisiel stared up in surprise.\
  \ \"You came back for me?\"</p> \n      <p>Seelah smiled. \"You should have more\
  \ faith, Merisiel.\"</p> \n      <p>Somewhere above them, a horn sounded. Then another.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Seelah's smile faded. She stood, every muscle in her legs screaming,\
  \ and hauled the elf to her feet. Merisiel hissed as her injured knee took the weight,\
  \ and Seelah draped one of the elf's arms across her armored shoulders.</p> \n \
  \     <p>\"Come on,\" she said, as they began hobbling back down the stairs. \"\
  Let's see if the goddess has one last miracle for us...\"</p> \n     </blockquote>\
