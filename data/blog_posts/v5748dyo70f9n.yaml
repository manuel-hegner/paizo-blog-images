  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">As Lost Omens lore solidified\
  \ early in Pathfinder’s first edition, the distant islands of Iblydos appeared briefly\
  \ and rarely—often just a mention listed among other realms or an apocryphal sidebar\
  \ pondering the origins of minotaurs. As a reader, I could tell Iblydos wanted to\
  \ evoke classical Greek culture and myth, yet there was precious little to find.\
  \ Thankfully, I didn’t just get to read about Iblydos; I wrote the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9gro?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Shores\"\
  >gazetteer for Aelyosos</a>, a major port city and fans’ first window into what\
  \ makes this archipelago special. And now a decade later, we’ve returned in a big\
  \ way: the Myth-Speaker Adventure Path, a mythic campaign for 1st-level characters!</p>\n\
  \      <p>If you’ve boosted your own Lost Omens Lore proficiency over the years,\
  \ you might already be familiar with Iblydos. If not, don’t worry! Let me share\
  \ some trivia to catch you up and get excited.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Classical\
  \ Inspiration, not Replication</h2>\n      <p>I mentioned before that classical\
  \ Greek myth and history inspired Iblydos, so are we getting stats for Zeus? Not\
  \ quite like that. When pitching and developing Iblydos, I considered what concepts\
  \ and themes make ancient Greece exciting before considering how those ideas might\
  \ manifest on Golarion—especially in a way that integrates with surrounding lands\
  \ Vudra, southern Casmaron’s coast, and the Obari Crossing sailing route.</p>\n\

  \   <p>So what might you find?</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>City-States:</strong>\
  \ Much as Athens, Sparta, and others tried, nobody united classical Greece for long.\
  \ For much of its history, myriad city-states jostled for influence and even hegemony.\
  \ Likewise, nine major city-states have ruled Iblydos for centuries, with at least\
  \ one having collapsed dramatically in the Age of Lost Omens. Some city-states feel\
  \ strongly Greek-inspired, and that means plenty of other city-states break the\
  \ mold in exciting ways.</li>\n       <li><strong>Hubris, Hospitality, and Metamorphosis:</strong>\
  \ Flip open <em>Bulfinch’s Mythology</em> to a few random myths, and you’ll inevitably\
  \ find some combination of a mortal being braggadocious, a god in disguise being\
  \ inadvertently snubbed, and that god then transforming the mortal into something\
  \ ironic. Arachne’s a classic example, and Baucis and Philemon are iconic counterexamples.\
  \ Iblydos has no shortage of transformation and cautionary tales, even shaping some\
  \ of the recommended ancestries for this campaign—including awakened animals, beastkin,\
  \ and more! You’ll also find these themes echoing throughout Myth-Speaker’s narratives.</li>\n\
  \       <li><strong>Mythological Creatures:</strong> Some of the oldest Pathfinder\
  \ lore credits Iblydos as the birthplace of myriad creatures like harpies and minotaurs.\
  \ If there’s a prominent Greek myth about it, the creature’s likely making at least\
  \ one appearance. In fact, cyclopes play a major role in most cities, having joined\
  \ forces with humanity ages ago.</li>\n       <li><strong>Glory:</strong> That many\
  \ fearsome creatures require equally courageous heroes! Homeric heroes chased after\
  \ <em>kleos</em>, the kind of glory that comes from doing amazing things and ideally\
  \ being immortalized in stories. Even if the average Iblydan doesn’t intend to wrestle\
  \ a hydra, they still strive toward excellence in their chosen craft, profession,\
  \ or other pursuit.</li>\n       <li><strong>Demigods:</strong> Classical myth boasted\
  \ more than a handful of immutable deities. The Olympians, titans, and sundry other\
  \ gods often philandered with mortals, resulting in a host of demigods. Over time,\
  \ Greek myths and religion evolved and became regionally personalized, such as Artemis\
  \ of Delphi diverging from Artemis of Ephesus (causing fandom battles worthy of\
  \ the modern internet). What really sang to me were these demigods and regional\
  \ mystery cults, each a unique yet doomed to fade from memory eventually. How might\
  \ Iblydos achieve that same flavor?</li>\n      </ul>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Myth-Speaking</h2>\n\
  \      <p>And that’s where myth-speaking arose. Iblydos doesn’t have local, full-power\
  \ deities like Desna, Shizuru, or Kazutal. Instead, most Iblydans revere hero-gods—\
  local demigods who were born mortal but obtained mythic power. When a mortal shows\
  \ exceptional promise, a city’s cyclopes invite them to join a divinatory ritual\
  \ called myth-speaking. With their magical foresight, the giants prophesy what great\
  \ deed the mortal might achieve. If the mortal follows through and succeeds, they\
  \ attain mythic power like the rules you’ll find in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq06sfx?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals\"\
  ><em>War of Immortals</em></a>. Those same hero-gods grant spells for a lifetime\
  \ or three before passing away, making room for new hero-gods.</p>\n      <p>At\
  \ least, that’s how it’s worked for millennia. The Age of Lost Omens undermines\
  \ cyclopean prophecies, and myth-speaking has become less reliable each year. At\
  \ this point, Iblydos would experience a record scratch double-take worthy of an\
  \ Adventure Path if approximately four player characters were to attain mythic power\
  \ all at once.&nbsp;</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2><a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurepath/mythspeaker\"\
  >The Myth-Speaker Adventure Path</a></h2>\n      <p>Oh hey, did you hear the Myth-Speaker\
  \ Adventure Path is a mythic campaign for 1st-level PCs?</p>\n      <p>Yep, even\
  \ though your characters won’t start the game with mythic power, they’ll attain\
  \ it during the first volume! From there, they’ll navigate the political excitement\
  \ that comes from new hero-gods on the scene, wrestle with the mythic power coursing\
  \ through their bodies (because their bodies weren’t made for so much energy), and\
  \ unravel the strange circumstances that led to them being the latest additions\
  \ to Iblydos’s dwindling pantheon. Expect monster-slaying, mythic problem-solving,\
  \ and voyages throughout the islands (and into realms where no simple ship would\
  \ sail).</p>\n      <p>To help get the ideas churning, check out the <a href=\"\
