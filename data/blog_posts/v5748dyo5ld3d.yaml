  date\">Tuesday, February 7, 2012</p> \n    <p>It’s time to address some FAQs! These\
  \ answers will be added to the official FAQ later this week.</p> \n    <p><b>How\
  \ is the negative energy affinity monster ability (<a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"\
  ><i>Bestiary 2</i></a>, page 299) supposed to work?</b></p> \n    <p>The intent\
  \ of this ability is that the creature is healed by negative energy (like an undead)\
  \ and harmed by positive energy (like an undead); this is automatic and has nothing\
  \ to do with the intent of the target or the energy-wielder. However, as written,\
  \ the ability is a bit confusing because of the phrase “reacts to,” which doesn’\
  t have a clear definition. This ability will be changed in the next printing of\
  \ <i>Bestiary 2</i>.</p> \n    <p><b>Update:</b> Page 299—In the description of\
  \ the Negative Energy Affinity ability, replace the current entry with the following:\
  \ </p>\n    <blockquote>\n     <p><b>Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)</b> The creature\
  \ is alive, but is treated as undead for all effects that affect undead differently\
  \ than living creatures, such as cure spells and channeled energy. <i>Format:</i>\
  \ negative energy affinity; <i>Location:</i> Defensive Abilities.</p>\n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Is the aquatic sorcerer bloodline (<a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Players Guide</i></a>, page 136) supposed to get <i>geyser</i> as a\
  \ bonus spell at sorcerer level 9, even though that’s normally a 5th-level sorcerer/wizard\
  \ spell and unavailable to sorcerers before caster level 10?</b></p> \n    <p>Yes,\
  \ and the sorcerer learns it as a 4th-level spell. Note that <i>geyser</i> is also\
  \ a 4th-level druid spell (available at character level 7), so the aquatic sorcerer\
  \ gaining it at character level 9 as a 4th-level arcane spell isn’t too powerful.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Can a magus use spellstrike (<a href=\"/products/btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Magic</i></a>, page 10) to cast a touch spell, move, and make a melee attack with\
  \ a weapon to deliver the touch spell, all in the same round?</b></p> \n    <p>Yes.\
  \ Other than deploying the spell with a melee weapon attack instead of a melee touch\
  \ attack, the magus spellstrike ability doesn’t change the normal rules for using\
  \ touch spells in combat (<a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>\
  \ 185). So, just like casting a touch spell, a magus could use spellstrike to cast\
  \ a touch spell, take a move toward an enemy, then (as a free action) make a melee\
  \ attack with his weapon to deliver the spell.</p> \n    <p>On a related topic,\
  \ the magus touching his held weapon doesn’t count as “touching anything or anyone”\
  \ when determining if he discharges the spell. A magus could even use the spellstrike\
  \ ability, miss with his melee attack to deliver the spell, be disarmed by an opponent\
  \ (or drop the weapon voluntarily, for whatever reason), and still be holding the\
  \ charge in his hand, just like a normal spellcaster. Furthermore, the weaponless\
  \ magus could pick up a weapon (even that same weapon) with that hand without automatically\
  \ discharging the spell, and then attempt to use the weapon to deliver the spell.\
  \ However, if the magus touches <i>anything other than a weapon with that hand</i>\
  \ (such as retrieving a potion), that discharges the spell as normal.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Basically, the spellstrike gives the magus more options when it comes to delivering\
  \ touch spells; it’s not supposed to make it more difficult for the magus to use\
  \ touch spells.</p> \n    <p>Sean K Reynolds<br> <i>Designer</i></p> \n   </blockquote>\
