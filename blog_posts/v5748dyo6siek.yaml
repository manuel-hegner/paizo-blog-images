  \   </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello, there!\
  \ I’m Logan Bonner, Pathfinder Lead Designer, here to discuss some of the changes\
  \ to spells and spellcasting in the remastered books, especially <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eoj?Pathfinder-Player-Core\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Core</em></a>. James recently went over some <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sieh?Player-Core-Preview-The-Wizard-Remastered\"\
  >details about the remastered wizard,</a> and I’m going to cover the changes to\
  \ spellcasting overall.</p> \n      <p>If you want to read some more on the subject,\
  \ the <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/RemasterCorePreview.pdf\">Core Preview\
  \ file</a> goes into detail about the term “spell rank” replacing “spell level,”\
  \ the removal of spell schools, the new spell format seen in the following examples,\
  \ and some more information about focus spells and the remastered Refocus action.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Spellcasting</h3> \n      <p>As we’ve mentioned in several places,\
  \ we’ve removed spell components from spells for several reasons:</p> \n      <ul>\
  \ \n       <li><strong>They were highly tied to OGL content.</strong> We’re moving\
  \ away from them.</li> \n       <li><strong>They were mostly redundant with traits</strong>.\
  \ Though there were some shades of nuance here, most of the time, the player needed\
  \ to remember that material, somatic, and focus components added the manipulate\
  \ trait to a spell and verbal components added concentrate. The new system adds\
  \ those traits directly and cuts out the middleman (the components).</li> \n   \
  \    <li><strong>There were a <em>ton</em> of exceptions to make classes play as\
  \ intended</strong>. You can see in the sidebar on page 303 of the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook</em>that the bard, cleric, druid, and sorcerer all had exceptions\
  \ for how their components work. This removal lets the classes work as intended\
  \ without having to learn the system and then having to learn which parts of that\
  \ system you could ignore.</li> \n       <li><strong>Classes wanted more freedom\
  \ to define how they cast spells.</strong> As the game has grown, both over the\
  \ course of 1st Edition and 2nd Edition, more class concepts came up that wanted\
  \ to cast spells with different particulars and presentation. Ultimately, we decided\
  \ we preferred to let the classes define how they cast and let the theme dictate\
  \ their mechanics rather than to have a “consistent” system that must either restrict\
  \ classes or be undermined by them.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c478fa49-8988-4c14-9f16-a0c6b4b98c94/PZO2121_wallofthorns_2000x1333.png\"\

  \    </div> \n      <h3>Spell Statistics</h3> \n      <p>If you’ve looked at the\
  \ <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/WarOfImmortalsPlaytest.pdf\"><em>War of\
  \ Immortals</em> playtest classes</a>, you may have noticed that the animist is\
  \ “Trained in spell attack modifier” and “Trained in spell DC.” Why doesn’t it say\
  \ “divine?” This represents a change to spellcasting for all characters who get\
  \ spells, whether it’s from a class, innate spells, an archetype, or any other source.\
  \ You no longer need to track proficiency separately for each tradition; there’\
  s just one proficiency now. To update an existing character, you’ll simply use the\
  \ highest proficiency you already have for all your spells. Why has this changed?</p>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li><strong>Reduce tracking.</strong> Having multiple proficiencies\
  \ could be annoying to keep track of, especially for a complicated character.</li>\
  \ \n       <li><strong>Enable interesting character concepts.</strong> Though you\
  \ might think it would be fun to play a cleric with a bard archetype, the spell\
  \ statistics could be so much worse that it wasn’t worth pursuing.</li> \n     \
  \  <li><strong>Let the attributes do the work.</strong> We already have another\
  \ way that the secondary spells you acquire can be worse—they likely use different\
  \ attributes. In the above example, you’d still need Wisdom for cleric spells and\
  \ Charisma for bard spells. That’s enough of a difference to account for without\
  \ tossing in a gulf between proficiencies that pushes the stats further apart. It\
  \ also allows you to eliminate the gap entirely if you choose options that use the\
  \ same attribute.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Cantrips</h3> \n \
  \     <p>We’ve made several revisions to damaging cantrips, with the broadest change\
  \ being to use only damage dice rather than adding an attribute modifier. Like with\
  \ most changes we made to the system, this was decided after examining multiple\
  \ factors that were causing problems together.</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><strong>Consistency\
  \ with how other spells work.</strong> Most spells deal just dice for damage, and\
  \ cantrips were an outlier. Making spells look and function more consistently across\
  \ the board helps in understanding the rules, especially for new players.</li> \n\
  \       <li><strong>Match their damage to our intended spell benchmarks.</strong>\
  \ One-target cantrips were supposed to deal around 6 damage, with focus spells and\
  \ spell slots dealing a bit more. Adding the spellcasting attribute modifier pushed\
  \ all the damage numbers off their baseline.</li> \n       <li><strong>Avoid penalizing\
  \ characters who have damage cantrips from innate spells or multiclassing twice.</strong>\
  \ Characters who got damaging cantrips from multiclassing or as innate spells from\
  \ ancestry feats or the like often have a lower attribute modifier than a dedicated\
  \ spellcaster and were dealing with both a lower chance of success and lower damage\
  \ if they hit. This is a smaller issue, but often led to players being unhappy with\
  \ their character options.</li> \n       <li><strong>Cleaning up how cantrips work\
  \ for monsters.</strong> This is another smaller issue, but a pain point for GMs.\
  \ It was unclear how to apply the spellcasting attribute modifier for monsters with\
  \ cantrips.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>A good example of a cantrip built in a\
  \ new manner is <em>caustic blast</em>, which now uses a burst and works a bit more\
  \ like other spells rather than having a player need to learn how splash damage\
  \ works for the purposes of a single spell the way <em>acid splash</em> did.</p>\
  \ \n      <blockquote> \n       <p><b>Caustic Blast [two-actions] Cantrip </b></p>\
  \ \n       <p><b>Acid, Cantrip, Concentrate, Manipulate</b><br> <strong>Traditions</strong>\
  \ arcane, primal<br> <strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Area</strong> 5-foot\
  \ burst<br> <strong>Defense</strong> basic Reflex<br> You fling a large glob of\
  \ acid that immediately detonates, spraying nearby creatures. Creatures in the area\
  \ take 1d8 acid damage with a basic Reflex save; on a critical failure, the creature\
  \ also takes 1 persistent acid damage.<br> <strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The\
  \ initial damage increases by 1d8, and the persistent damage on a critical failure\
  \ increases by 1.</p> \n       <p>We’ve also revamped many of the non-damaging cantrips.\
  \ Here you can see both <em>read aura</em>, which needed adjustment due to the removal\
  \ of spell schools and now speaks more directly to identifying the item, and <em>light</em>,\
  \ which incorporates both parts of the original <em>light</em> spell and the removed\
  \ spell <em>dancing lights</em> to provide players with an alternative that allows\
  \ for more creativity and flexibility.</p> \n       <br> \n       <p><b>Read Aura\
  \ Cantrip 1 </b></p> \n       <p><b>Cantrip, Concentrate, Detection, Manipulate</b><br>\
  \ <strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, divine, occult, primal<br> <strong>Cast</strong>\
  \ 1 minute<br> <strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 object<br>\
  \ You focus on the target object, opening your mind to perceive magical auras. When\
  \ the casting is complete, you know whether that item is magical. You (or anyone\
  \ you advise about the aura) gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Identify Magic on the\
  \ item. If the object is illusory, you detect this only if the effect’s rank is\
  \ lower than the rank of your <em>read aura</em> spell.<br> <strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong>\
  \ You can target up to 10 objects.<br> <strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can\
  \ target any number of objects.</p> \n       <br> \n       <p><b>Light [two-actions]\
  \ Cantrip 1</b></p> \n       <p><b>Cantrip, Concentrate, Light, Manipulate</b><br>\
  \ <strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, divine, occult, primal<br> <strong>Range</strong>\
  \ 120 feet<br> <strong>Duration</strong> until your next daily preparations<br>\
  \ You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim\
  \ light for the next 20 feet) in a color you choose. If you create the light in\
  \ the same space as a willing creature, you can attach the light to the creature,\
  \ causing it to float near that creature as it moves. You can Sustain the spell\
  \ to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it from a creature as\
  \ part of this movement.<br> You can Dismiss the spell. If you Cast the Spell while\
  \ you already have four <em>light</em> spells active, you must choose one of the\
  \ existing spells to end.<br> <strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> The orb sheds light\
  \ in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet).</p> \n      </blockquote>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Focus Spells</h3> \n      <p>We’ve already mentioned\
  \ and shown several changes to how Focus Points work in the Core Preview document.\
  \ Mainly, the number of points for your focus pool is always equal to the number\
  \ of focus spells you know, to a maximum of 3, and you can Refocus for 10 minutes\
  \ to regain 1 Focus Point regardless of how many points you’ve already spent. If\
  \ you want to see the new Refocus rules for yourself, take a look at the <a href=\"\
  https://downloads.paizo.com/RemasterCorePreview.pdf\">Core Preview</a> document.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>This alone should make focus spells more dependable and simpler to\
  \ use and track. Additionally, we’ve taken a look at a few of the focus spells that\
  \ didn’t function well as focus spells and tuned them up. Let’s look at waking nightmare,\
  \ for example. It can now make a creature paralyzed instead of fleeing and can make\
  \ the creature take extra mental damage.</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p><b>Waking\
  \ Nightmare [two-actions] Focus 1</b></p> \n       <p><b>Uncommon, Cleric, Concentrate,\
  \ Emotion, Fear, Focus, Manipulate, Mental</b><br> <b>Range</b> 30 feet; <b>Targets</b>\
  \ 1 creature<br> <b>Saving Throw</b> Will; <b>Duration</b> varies<br> You fill the\
  \ creature’s mind with a terrifying vision. The target must attempt a Will save.\
  \ A creature frightened by this spell takes 1 additional mental damage each time\
  \ it’s hit by a Strike.<br> <b>Critical Success</b> The target is unaffected.<br>\
  \ <b>Success</b> The target is frightened 1.<br> <b>Failure</b> The target is frightened\
  \ 2. If it’s asleep, it wakes up and is paralyzed for 1 round.<br> <b>Critical Failure</b>\
  \ As failure, but frightened 3.<br> <b>Heightened (+1)</b> The mental damage increases\
  \ by 1.</p> \n       <p>Many focus spells with longer casting times, like <em>read\
  \ fate</em> and <em>safeguard secret</em>, have had their casting times reduced,\
  \ so you can use them in the middle of an encounter or scene.</p> \n      </blockquote>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>What About Normal Spells?</h3> \n      <p>So, you’ve\
  \ heard about cantrips and focus spells, but what about all those other spells?\
  \ For the most part, spells cast from slots work similarly to how they did before.\
  \ Let’s look at a couple of those spells! First is <em>thunderstrike</em>, which\
  \ replaces <em>shocking grasp</em>. It starts off with lower damage, but it becomes\
  \ ranged instead of being a melee spell and heightened versions increase its damage\
  \ output.</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p><b>Thunderstrike [two-actions] Spell\
  \ 1</b></p> \n       <p><b>Concentrate, Electricity, Manipulate, Sonic</b><br> <b>Traditions</b>\
  \ arcane, primal<br> <b>Range</b> 120 feet; <b>Targets</b> 1 creature<br> <b>Defense</b>\
  \ basic Reflex<br> You call down a tendril of lightning that cracks with thunder,\
  \ dealing 1d12 electricity damage and 1d4 sonic damage to the target with a basic\
  \ Reflex save. A target wearing metal armor or made of metal takes a –1 circumstance\
  \ bonus to its save, and if damaged by the spell is clumsy 1 for 1 round.</p> <b>Heightened\
  \ (+1)</b> The damage increases by 1d12 electricity and 1d4 sonic.\n       <p></p>\
  \ \n       <p>Second, we have <em>tree of seasons</em>, which we’ve previously mentioned\
  \ in streams and such. It’s taking the “explosive seeds” spot formerly held by <em>fire\
  \ seeds</em>, but with a bit more variety, higher damage, and the option to create\
  \ the tree farther away from you.</p> \n       <br> \n       <p><b>Tree of Seasons\
  \ [two-actions] Spell 6</b></p> \n       <p><b>Concentrate, Manipulate, Plant, Wood</b><br>\
  \ <b>Traditions</b> primal<br> <b>Range</b> 60 feet<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 minute<br>\
  \ You cause a Small tree to instantly sprout in an unoccupied space on the ground.\
  \ Four seedpods grow from the tree, each filled with the magic of a different one\
  \ of the four seasons. A creature can Interact to pluck one of the pods and can\
  \ then either throw it up to 30 feet as part of the same action or do so with a\
  \ separate Interact action later. When thrown, a pod explodes in a 5-foot burst,\
  \ dealing 6d6 damage with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. The damage\
  \ type depends on the season of the pod: electricity for spring, fire for summer,\
  \ poison for autumn, or cold for winter. When the spell ends, the tree withers away\
  \ and any remaining pods rot, leaving behind non-magical seeds.<br> <b>Heightened\
  \ (+1)</b> The burst’s damage increases by 1d6.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n   \
