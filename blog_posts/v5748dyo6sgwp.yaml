  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The horns were blowing in her dreams again.</p>\
  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In her dreams, they all sounded together: the\
  \ alarm and the battle march and the frenzied call to retreat. The calls overlapped\
  \ into chaos, yet Veldrienne heard them all distinctly, and she understood with\
  \ the perfect, crazed, crystal logic of dreams that of course the battle march was\
  \ wild with panic, and of course the first call to alarm was a dolorous cry played\
  \ over the bloody field of a lost battle, and of <i>course</i> it all began and\
  \ ended with a weak, wounded note that broke on the thrust of a dead man’s spear.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Because this was Lastwall, where the knights of her order had trained\
  \ for nearly a thousand years to meet the Whispering Tyrant’s threat, and where\
  \ the Tyrant had destroyed them effortlessly. Every battle worthy of the name had\
  \ been lost before the Watcher-Lord’s armies had mustered. They’d been defeated\
  \ before they’d begun.</p> \n     <p>That hurt the worst of all. All their pride,\
  \ all their valor, and they’d never had a chance.</p> \n     <p>And so Veldrienne\
  \ dreamed, again and again, of a call to arms that was a call to mourning, and of\
  \ battlefields she would never see.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ \n     <p>She kicked off the blanket covering her legs. Watery gray sunlight,\
  \ the only light that shone on the Gravelands anymore, filtered through the burned\
  \ rafters of the farmhouse they’d sheltered in overnight.</p> \n     <p>Yeran held\
  \ up a battered kettle. He’d been up for a while, long enough to have warmed water\
  \ and made an attempt at shaving. “Porridge?”</p> \n     <p>“Thank you.” Veldrienne\
  \ spooned the stale mush out of the kettle. They didn’t have any bowls left. “Save\
  \ any of that wash water for me?”</p> \n     <p>Yeran nodded. He’d missed a few\
  \ patches, shaving with just that dented kettle for a mirror. The stubble was white\
  \ in the weak light. It made him look old, and almost as worn down as Veldrienne\
  \ felt. “Plenty to go around, now that there are only two of us left.”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Two. Out of a full company. Veldrienne shook her head. They were the last\
  \ two left, and yet they still pretended to uphold the niceties of their order.\
  \ Yeran still tried to keep clean-shaven. Veldrienne still polished the pins of\
  \ rank on the filthy rags of her uniform.</p> \n     <p>She wasn’t sure why they\
  \ bothered. Habits died harder than people, evidently.</p> \n     <p>Veldrienne\
  \ paused, the spoon halfway to her mouth. There was smoke on the wind. Wood smoke.\
  \ The Tyrant’s rotting minions had no need to cook, and certainly never washed.\
  \ They didn’t light campfires.</p> \n     <p>“People.”</p> \n     <p>Yeran was already\
  \ buckling on his sword. He’d smelled it too. “East?”</p> \n     <p>“East.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Together they walked through the weed-choked fields and abandoned hovels\
  \ to the last intact farmhouse in town. It was where Veldrienne would have sheltered,\
  \ if she’d had to shelter here. If she hadn’t known that ghouls, and worse, hunted\
  \ these grounds.</p> \n     <p>She knocked at the door. “Veldrienne of Vigil and\
  \ Yeran Dhoskan, Knights of Lastwall.” It almost didn’t hurt to say that last part\
  \ anymore. “Is anyone living here? Can we aid you?”</p> \n     <p>Scurrying inside.\
  \ Hushed voices, fear and hope warring between them. Then a woman’s voice: “Can\
  \ you… can you get us somewhere safe?”</p> \n     <p>Veldrienne closed her eyes\
  \ so she wouldn’t have to see Yeran’s look. “Yes. If you trust us.”</p> \n     <p>They\
  \ came out. A man, a woman, six young children. Plainly the children were not all\
  \ theirs by blood. Just as plainly, they were by necessity. Veldrienne’s determination\
  \ hardened, looking at the family that the Tyrant’s menace had driven together.\
  \ If these people had managed to protect their children this far, she wouldn’t see\
  \ them fail now.</p> \n     <p>“We can get you to the camp at Kassen,” she told\
  \ them, “and from there you can take a boat to Vellumis. The Tyrant’s creatures\
  \ don’t hold the water as fiercely as they do the land.”</p> \n     <p>“Thank you,”\
  \ the woman said. </p> \n     <p>The man hesitated, then drew out a pendant he’\
  d hidden inside the seam of his coat sleeve. He offered it to Veldrienne, who shook\
  \ her head. “I can’t take your money.”</p> \n     <p>“It isn’t money. It’s… I was\
  \ a jeweler. Before all this.” He laughed bleakly. “I thought I’d use some of my\
  \ pieces to bribe our way out of the Gravelands, but there’s no bribing the dead.\
  \ I want you to have it, instead. I can’t buy safety. None of us can. But I can,\
  \ at least, offer this. Please. Take it and tell me that—that you understand.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Veldrienne took the pendant. It was an octagon of rose gold, holding\
  \ a pressed flower under glass in a ring of white seed pearls. The flower was familiar.\
  \ Star alyssum. It had bloomed around the Watcher-Lord’s palace and spilled from\
  \ the window boxes of Vigil’s tidy whitewashed homes, perfuming the city in summer.\
  \ If she closed her eyes, she could almost breathe its delicate, honeyed sweetness\
  \ again.</p> \n     <p>“I made them for crusaders traveling up to the Worldwound,”\
  \ the man explained. “For them to remember the homes and loved ones they left behind.\
  \ I never thought that crusade would be won, or that I’d need to preserve the memory\
  \ of Vigil on its own ground instead. But — look. The back.”</p> \n     <p>Veldrienne\
  \ turned the pendant around. In the back, under a panel of rose gold inscribed “\
  Vigil’s blessing,” was a compartment full of tiny black seeds.</p> \n     <p>Mendev\
  \ and the Sarkoris Scar were dotted with battlefield graves where star alyssum bloomed.\
  \ Veldrienne knew those marked the final rest of knights from Lastwall, but she\
  \ had never considered who carried the seeds there, or what it meant for a knight\
  \ to lie beneath a bier of flowers on ground so grimly sanctified.</p> \n     <p>Now,\
  \ holding the pendant, she understood. “Thank you.”</p> \n     <p>The man started\
  \ to say something else, but Veldrienne held up a hand. “Quiet.” She’d smelled something\
  \ on the wind. Not the remembered fragrance of alyssum.</p> \n     <p>Ghouls. The\
  \ stench was unmistakable. The Tyrant’s minions didn’t breathe, and thus had no\
  \ sense of smell — that was why Veldrienne had scented the family’s woodsmoke first,\
  \ and why the ghouls’ foulness didn’t incapacitate their fellow undead — but they\
  \ could see well enough, and the weak sun in the Gravelands didn’t cow them. They\
  \ must have seen the smoke rising from the chimney once the family was too distracted\
  \ to fan it away.</p> \n     <p>“Get inside,” Veldrienne ordered, drawing her sword.\
  \ She could see the ghouls coming now, loping feral and hideous through the crumbling\
  \ town. Yeran fell in beside her, and she was glad to have him at her side. There\
  \ was no better feeling than standing beside a fellow knight, true and trustworthy,\
  \ against a clear-cut foe.</p> \n     <p>She’d been wrong earlier. There <i>were</i>\
  \ still battles worth fighting in the Gravelands. The knights of Lastwall hadn’\
  t been utterly defeated. They hadn’t lost everything yet.</p> \n     <p>Not yet.</p>\
