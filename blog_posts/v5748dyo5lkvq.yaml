  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">My travels take me to many conventions during\
  \ the year. I enjoy them all, mostly because I get a chance to meet our volunteers\
  \ and fans. But Origins holds a special place in my heart. I had never attended\
  \ Origins before joining the organized play team at Paizo, but I'm glad it is now\
  \ a staple of my convention tour.</p> \n    <p>Why do I enjoy it so much? Several\
  \ key reasons, I think. First, while it is one of the biggest conventions in the\
  \ United States outside of the Comic Cons and PAX events, it still has a small convention\
  \ feel. I believe this is due to the compact nature of the hotels and convention\
  \ center that make up the core of the event. It is a 5-minute walk from my hotel\
  \ room to the Franklin Ballrooms, where we hold most of the Paizo events. I can\
  \ get to the food court in 5 minutes. Ditto to getting to the Exhibit Halls, where\
  \ the vendors and open gaming tables are located, to the Drury meeting rooms for\
  \ GAMA meetings, and to the show offices. Oh, and the Starbucks is just across the\
  \ hall from the Org Play space. Great for my coffee needs!</p> \n    <p>My second\
  \ reason is the volunteers. Our volunteers at Origins are among some of the best.\
  \ We had a few scheduling issues and the volunteers stepped up every time to cover\
  \ tables. They flexed on what games they ran, which allowed us to respond to shifting\
  \ demand for Starfinder and Pathfinder games. The HQ staff works well together,\
  \ using their skills to compliment each other and support the GMs.</p> \n    <p>Finally,\
  \ I love the convention attendees. I view our players as friends I haven't met yet\
  \ and love the fact I got to add a few more names and faces to my friends known\
  \ list. We talked characters, scenarios, likes, and dislikes, favorite things… this\
  \ list goes on. Getting to talk to our players recharges my batteries and makes\
  \ the hours of back office planning and work worthwhile. Thank you, everyone, who\
  \ came and shared your stories. I look forward to continuing our conversations at\
  \ events in the future.</p> \n    <p>I'm not the only staffer that attended Origins\
  \ 2018. We had a team of 5 running games and introducing the Pathfinder Playtest\
  \ to attendees. Cosmo went on to the American Libraries Conference the weekend after\
  \ and so didn't get a chance to chime in and Thurston put his thoughts into last\
  \ week's <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkve?New-Scenarios-Renkroda-Heartlove\"\
  >Starfinder Society scenario preview blog</a>, but both designer Mark Seifter and\
  \ organized play lead developer John Compton share their thoughts.</p> \n    <p>From\
  \ Mark:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>This was my first Origins ever, and it\
  \ was quite an exciting show! With nonstop Pathfinder Second Edition demos layered\
  \ on top of runs of The Rose Street Revenge, Origins gave me my first chance to\
  \ show the new game to gamers of wildly disparate gaming backgrounds and play experiences\
  \ (as opposed to the deeper Pathfinder fans who tend to attend PaizoCon) and to\
  \ learn…they all like this new game I've been working on, they like it a lot. The\
  \ universal excitement was contagious, and an important reminder to me of just why\
  \ I love what I do. One of my highlights was hearing from our crack team of volunteers\
  \ (who did an amazing job!) how their demo runs had turned out, only to discover\
  \ that they and their players were as excited as I was; in fact, one of the volunteers\
  \ for 3 out of 5 days enjoyed the Pathfinder Second Edition demos so much that she\
  \ asked to fill up the rest of her days with demos instead of playing.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Finally, as Owen pointed out when I returned to the office, Starfinder's\
  \ victory as fan favorite at the Origins Awards means I am now an Origins Award-winning\
  \ designer. I hadn't thought of it because to me, the ultimate reward is having\
  \ people love the games and books I work on, and the award is just a manifestation\
  \ of that.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>John's thoughts on the event:</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>This was my first Origins since 2006, which was far\
  \ before I knew anything about organized play. Columbus puts on a fun show with\
  \ a great community, and it was a delight to meet the Ohio crew as well as Paizo\
  \ enthusiasts from many states beyond. I split my time between running shorter demos\
  \ of Pathfinder's second edition, running preregistered tables of the 5-hour<i>Rose\
  \ Street Revenge</i>second edition quest experience, and wandering the Franklin\
  \ ballroom to check out the action. Particularly impressive was all of the Starfinder\
  \ Society energy, especially when we debuted the first ever Starfinder Society multitable\
  \ interactive special <a href=\"/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion\"\
  ><i>#1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</i></a> by Mikko Kallio. He and Thurston Hillman\
  \ put together a great experience, and the Origins GMs and HQ volunteers made it\
  \ all possible.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>So if you haven't been to Origins\
  \ before, I suggest you consider coming out to Origins 2019! If you're already planning\
  \ on attending, I'll see you there!</p> \n    <p>Check back next week for our first\
  \ of the month \"Stars, Cons, and More\" blog!</p> \n    <p>Until next time - Explore,\
  \ Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Manager</i></p>\
