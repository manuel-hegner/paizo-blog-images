  \ Volunteer GMs and Assistants!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April 16,\
  \ 2009</p> \n   <p>Hello!</p> \n   <p>This is the official call for volunteer GMs\
  \ and assistants to help Paizo Publishing run events at Gen Con 2009. (If you're\
  \ looking for the Origins volunteer thread, click <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/general/callForVolunteerOriginsGMsForPathinderSocietyAndMore\"\
  >here</a>.) In order to be sure that Gen Con 2009 is the best possible play experience,\
  \ I need a minimum of 42 volunteers (54 volunteers total on Friday and Saturday\
  \ night) with no maximum—I'll keep taking volunteers until the slots are filled!\
  \ Below you will find the reward structure for volunteering as well as the events\
  \ and slots for which I need volunteers. This year, I'm also creating a new \"Volunteer\
  \ Assistant\" position for the show—these two folks will aid me in all manner of\
  \ things and will be my right and left hand man/woman throughout the entire show.\
  \ They will be rewarded handsomely for their time. Speaking of our rewards, we've\
  \ DOUBLED the voucher amounts you get for volunteering this year and increased the\
  \ number of hotel rooms available for Tier 1 volunteers. By doing this, I hope to\
  \ see even more people working for us at Gen Con.</p> \n   <p>Tell your friends!\
  \ Tell your family! Tell everyone in your game group! We need volunteers!</p> \n\
  \   <p>One last thing to keep in mind: you're volunteering for a slot, not a specific\
  \ event. I'll assign people to events inside the slot they've volunteered for and\
  \ won't take requests.</p> \n   <p><b>Volunteer Tiers and Rewards</b></p> \n   <p><b>Volunteer\
  \ Assistant</b><br> The volunteer assistants will work closely with me every day\
  \ of the show from 8 A.M. to 10 P.M. to help muster slots, gather tickets, answer\
  \ questions, and run HQ. The volunteer assistants may also be used as gophers, lunch-gatherers,\
  \ or errand-runners. Reliable, punctual, and guaranteed-to-be-at-the-show applicants\
  \ ONLY please. This position is limited to two volunteers and will be assigned on\
  \ a first-come, first-serve basis, though I reserve the right to select volunteers\
  \ I've worked with in the past (i.e., at Gen Con 2008 or Gen Con UK 2008). Volunteer\
  \ assistants will only be used as GMs to cover GMs that are MIA. Volunteer assistants\
  \ receive:</p> \n   <p>A FREE 4-day badge<br> A FREE 1/4 of a hotel room<br> A $150\
  \ voucher for the Paizo booth (to be used in the Paizo booth on Sunday only)<br>\
  \ A FREE black &amp; white photocopied version of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\
  \ <i>Core Rulebook</i> before the show after signing an NDA<br> A FREE autographed\
  \ copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game <i>Core Rulebook</i> hardcover at Gen\
  \ Con Wednesday evening<br> A FREE limited edition Paizo Publishing Gen Con 2009\
  \ T-Shirt</p> \n   <p><b>Tier 1 GM Volunteers</b><br> Tier 1 GM volunteers are my\
  \ workhorse, every day GMs. They are invaluable to making the show a success! Tier\
  \ 1 GMs must select and volunteer for a MINIMUM of 8 slots. Tier 1 GMs may feel\
  \ free to volunteer for more than 8 slots if they so desire. I only have room for\
  \ 18 Tier 1 GM volunteers so don't delay in volunteering for this tier. Volunteers\
  \ will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, though I reserve the right\
  \ to select volunteers who have previously worked for Paizo over new volunteers.\
  \ Tier 1 GMs receive:</p> \n   <p>A FREE 4-day badge<br> A FREE 1/4 of a hotel room<br>\
  \ A $10 per slot voucher for the Paizo booth (to be used in the Paizo booth on Sunday\
  \ only)<br> A FREE black &amp; white photocopied version of the Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game <i>Core Rulebook</i> before the show after signing an NDA<br> A FREE autographed\
  \ copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game <i>Core Rulebook</i> hardcover at Gen\
  \ Con Wednesday evening<br> A FREE limited edition Paizo Publishing Gen Con 2009\
  \ T-Shirt</p> \n   <p><b>Tier 2 GM Volunteers</b><br> While the rewards for volunteering\
  \ for this tier are smaller, the majority of my volunteers will come from Tier 2.\
  \ Tier 2 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 4 slots. Tier 2 GMs receive:</p> \n\
  \   <p>A FREE 4-day badge<br> A $10 per slot voucher for the Paizo booth (to be\
  \ used in the Paizo booth on Sunday only) <br> A FREE black &amp; white photocopied\
  \ version of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game <i>Core Rulebook</i> before the show\

  \ level. Tier 3 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 2 slots. Tier 3 GMs receive:</p>\
  \ \n   <p>A $10 per slot voucher for the Paizo booth (to be used in the Paizo booth\
  \ on Sunday only)<br> A FREE black &amp; white photocopied version of the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game <i>Core Rulebook</i> before the show after signing an NDA<br>\
  \ A FREE limited edition Paizo Publishing Gen Con 2009 T-Shirt</p> \n   <p><b>Volunteering\
  \ for One Slot</b><br> While we will gladly accept anyone who wants to run just\
  \ one slot during the show, there are no rewards for doing so other than our thanks.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Events by Slot</b><br> When volunteering, please be specific about\
  \ what slot you are volunteering for. I will assign folks to scenarios on an as-needed\
  \ basis, so you really only need to tell me the slot(s) you're volunteering for\
  \ (since I won't take requests). I will update the needs in the Gen Con volunteer\
  \ thread on the Pathfinder Society messageboards as I receive volunteers, so you\
  \ may refer to that thread in order to remain up to date on where we still need\
  \ help.</p> \n   <p>Slot 1: Thursday 8 A.M. to 12 P.M.<br> <b>Need</b>: 42 volunteers</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Slot 2: Thursday 1 P.M. to 5 P.M.<br> <b>Need</b>: 42 volunteers</p> \n\
