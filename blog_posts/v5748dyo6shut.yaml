  \      <p><em>Taking a much-needed relaxing break in between escapades, four gun-toting\
  \ adventures post up in a dingy bar in one of Alkenstar's entertainment districts.\
  \ Right across the street at a theater, people flood inside to catch the premiere\
  \ of a highly-advertised play, but what comes out of the theater is far more dangerous.\
  \ As people scatter to safety in the dusty streets, it’s up to the group of gunslingers\
  \ in the bar to set things right.</em></p>\n     </blockquote> \n     <div class=\"\

  https://twitter.com/ChelseaBytes\" target=\"_blank\">Chelsea Bytes </a></h4> \n\
  \     <p>ChelseaBytes is a singing, fun-focused, conversationalist who has a passion\
  \ for tech, games, and anime, among many other things. Soon after she started streaming\
  \ on Twitch 3 years ago, many viewers were surprised to find that she was a Computer\
  \ Scientist, saying that she was too “loud” and “fun”. This Twitch Partner aims\
  \ to show the world that Computer Scientists don’t look and act the way most people\
  \ imagine.</p> \n     <p>ChelseaBytes plays a large variety of games over on her\
  \ channel, but when she's not smashing heads in God of War or winning lane in League\
  \ of Legends, her stream becomes a daytime TV show. This means cosplaying, hosting\
  \ giveaways, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and cooking gourmet meals for her community,\
  \ the ByteCommand. Nothing describes Chelsea's stream better than \"Variety\", and\
  \ that variety is made up of ALL of her interests. Chelsea's performance doesn't\
  \ stop at her own Channel. She is an official host of AMC's FearHQ Twitch channel\
  \ (Re-Watching Dead, Play Dead, TWD Watchalong, etc.) and Amazon's Crown Channel\
  \ (Fight Night, Chasing the Crown: Dreamers to Streamers, Clicksport-1, etc.), and\
  \ has hosted events for companies such as Red Bull (Solo Q Tournament Series), Intel\
  \ (Unboxing+PC Build), Netflix (TUDUM co-stream), and DTS (Multiple PC Builds/Giveaways),\
  \ to name a few. </p> \n     <p>Not to be limited to her own stream/hosting, Chelsea\
  \ spends any extra time guesting. She has had several appearances on D&amp;D Actual\
  \ Play series like PixelCircus’ \"Damsels, Dice, and Everything Nice\" and INDG’\
  s \"Dungeons &amp; Durags\". She was also invited as a Guest/Attending Professional\
  \ to Dragon*Con 2021 where she co-hosted multiple panels focused on Digital Media.\
  \ Not one to shy away from causes close to her heart, Chelsea has guested for several\
  \ charity streams for important causes like \"Color of Change\" and \"Rise Above\
  \ the Disorder.\" Regardless of what genre she's in, what channel she's hosting\
  \ for, or what event she's at, ChelseaBytes always throws herself fully into whatever\
  \ she's doing.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <br> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c7535ee6-46ed-4b9f-a07f-db600de613c2/102721_MichelleNBradley_Headshot.jpg\"\
