  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>For those that didn’t see today’s earlier blog, check\
  \ out our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh8g\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society releases for May</a>.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">First Seeker\
  \ Luwazi Elsebo examined the datapad with a jubilant smile.</p> \n     <p>“It gives\
  \ me great honor to confirm Zafeldrin’s appointment to the role of venture-captain.”\
  \ Luwazi spoke aloud to the crew members diligently working their stations. “He’\
  s worked hard on Triaxus, and there were no voices on the Forum opposing this appointment.\
  \ Besides, it should be interesting to have a full-blooded dragon venture-captain\
  \ in our ranks!”</p> \n     <p>A flash of holographic data stole Luwazi’s attention,\
  \ bringing her back to the moment. She examined the data with a raised eyebrow before\
  \ directly questioning the crew, “Still no signal or report from the asteroid?”\
  </p> \n     <p>One of the science officers responded, “No, ma’am. The entire site\
  \ seems eerily quiet. Should we send in the first wave of ships?”</p> \n     <p>Luwazi\
  \ pondered the dangerous question as she reviewed one final addendum to the datapad.\
  \ It appeared that Zafeldrin was already hoping to employ several groups of Starfinder\
  \ field agents for a mission into the abandoned Triaxian region of Cadascon, a region\
  \ known for its strange crystalline growths. A bold endeavor, and one that could\
  \ surely expand the Society’s influence on Triaxus and perhaps skyrocket Zafeldrin’\
  s influence.</p> \n     <p>“Good luck then...” Luwazi mused while approving the\
  \ mission and stowing the datapad.</p> \n     <p>“Ma’am?” the science officer queried,\
  \ unsure if Luwazi’s statement was a reply to his question.</p> \n     <p>Straightening\
  \ in her command chair, Luwazi Elsebo directed her full attention to the officer,\
  \ “Not yet. We’ll divide the ships into tactical assault groups and make sure that\
  \ we go in together. This mission could put an end to Datch and her campaign against\
  \ the Society, so I want it done correctly.”</p> \n     <p>“Understood!” the officer\
  \ half-shouted a response, “I’ll get to re-organizing our ships immediately. Also,\
  \ the senior field agents are on standby for their briefing in the requested meeting\
  \ chamber.”</p> \n     <p>Almost leaping from her seat, Luwazi looked around the\
  \ command deck of the ship, “Then I’ll leave the rest to all of you. I’ll go brief\
  \ our premiere agents on this mission. When I return, we’ll begin the first phases\
  \ of the operation.”</p> \n     <p>Taking a single step away from the command chair,\
  \ Luwazi paused. With a smile, she half-turned and reached to a wooden container\
  \ she had kept just under her console. Plucking one of many similar objects from\
  \ the container, Luwazi strode to the nearest bridge exit.</p> \n     <p>Staring\
  \ at the shiny red apple she had withdrawn from the basket, Luwazi flashed a devil’\
  s smile.</p> \n     <p>“We’ve got you now, Datch.”</p> \n     <p>She took a bite.</p>\

  \ out in May, wrapping up the main arc of Starfinder Society’s Year of a Thousand\
  \ Bites. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023cw?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-223-The-Edge-of-Cadascon\"\
  ><em>Starting with Starfinder Society #2-23: Edge of Cadascon</em></a> by Emily\
  \ Parks, the PCs travel to the Pact World of Triaxus and take part in a major expedition\
  \ to a mysterious region of the planet. In <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023cx?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-224-Cornered-Rat\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #2-24: Cornered Rat</em></a> by Mikko Kallio, the PCs take\
  \ charge of an all-out assault on a hidden installation used by the nefarious ysoki\
  \ mastermind, Datch. This important mission could put an end to the multimedia smear\
  \ campaign used to besmirch the Starfinder Society throughout the Pact worlds!</p>\
