  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Gazing past his easel\
  \ at the bustling Commerce District of Niswan, Thaleon’s thoughts wandered once\
  \ again. They rarely stayed put, but life would hardly be any fun if they did. There\
  \ were so many delicious new sensations to take in, from the kites dancing overhead\
  \ to the tempting sizzle of vegetable wraps from a nearby food stall. He observed\
  \ the colors of the market, his eye lingering on a small shrine where a priest was\
  \ drawing the rose of Shelyn in colored powders. The Rahadoumi elf didn’t worship\
  \ to any gods himself, of course, but he had nothing but respect for the old priest’\
  s lifelong devotion and mastery as his fingers effortlessly scattered a vibrant\
  \ green around the rose’s exterior. Thaleon turned back to his own easel to paint\
  \ with his mind’s eye, the emotions of the market his palette. He blended the vibrant\
  \ gold of a cunning merchant’s intellect with the frustrated red of the customer\
  \ she had just outwitted in a battle of bargains. Now for some green as well, the\
  \ color of growth, flexibility, potential... </p> \n      <p>Thaleon frowned. He\
  \ sensed a green, but it was of an altogether unpleasant, oily variety, coming from\
  \ a woman in pristine robes, her ravenous eyes scouring the market. Wanting to get\
  \ closer, Thaleon steadied his mind and searched his feelings until he found the\
  \ one he needed. Calmness, boredom… no, listlessness. The drabbest of grays, utterly\
  \ unremarkable. Without so much as an incantation, Thaleon cloaked himself in the\
  \ emotion and vanished from sight. Quick and quiet as a shadow, he slipped through\
  \ the marketplace. Most would struggle to navigate a crowd, even invisibly, without\
  \ bumping into a customer or jostling a cart, but Thaleon had decades of practice\
  \ slipping by unnoticed and had long ago learned the consequences of getting caught.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The woman’s eyes found their target, and a predatory grin spread across\
  \ her face. The crowd before her instinctively parted, and within moments, she held\
  \ her prey in her grasp, her nails digging deep into the priest’s shoulders. As\
  \ blood pooled in their wake, the woman whispered a single word, “Watch.” Her eyes\
  \ flashed that oily green, the unmistakable swirl of magic about them. Thaleon saw\
  \ nothing, but he felt the man’s terror, pure white and primal as the priest gazed\
  \ with horror at a nightmare no one else could see. He fell to his knees and pushed\
  \ the nearby offering basket, filled with flowers and a few coins. “Please, not\
  \ them. Take what you want from me, just don’t….” His words were cut short as he\
  \ vomited onto the cobblestones. The woman scowled with disgust. “This is your final\
  \ warning.” With a regal nod, she strode away, splitting the crowd in her wake.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Thaleon’s hands trembled. He wanted to soothe the priest’s terror\
  \ and pain, but he knew the man couldn’t find peace while the monster’s threat loomed\
  \ over him. He reached for compassion—blue, tranquil as a cloudless sky—and sent\
  \ it flowing into the priest, calming the man and closing his wounds. The priest\
  \ glanced about, seeking the source of the swirling colors. </p> \n      <p>“Don’\
  t worry, Father,” Thaleon whispered from the empty air, “you’re not alone.”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>He quickened his pace and strode after the woman. From that display,\
  \ it was clear what manner of monster she was. All Thaleon needed was a chance,\
  \ away from the market stalls where so many innocents walked, to show the fiend\
  \ exactly what he felt about her threats. As fortune would have it, it didn’t take\
  \ long before she chose to turn down a secluded alleyway.</p> \n      <p>Thaleon\
  \ didn’t need to search for his fury, it was right at his fingertips, and he used\
  \ it to paint a simple blade in the air, the shape of the blade he’d been given\
  \ when he left home. As the blade shot towards the woman, red fury burned away the\
  \ tranquil gray that had kept Thaleon invisible, but he wasn’t afraid to let the\
  \ monster see his face. With a feline growl, she rolled out of the blade’s path,\
  \ scuffing her robes, before spinning toward Thaleon. Her hands spun too, twisting\
  \ backward, and weaving shadowy threads of magic. </p> \n      <p>An agonizing scream\
  \ echoed within Thaleon’s mind, reverberating and tearing. He steeled his will against\
  \ the oncoming tide, instinctively countering each wave of psychic sound until silence\
  \ prevailed once again. Definitely a rakshasa, then. And one who underestimated\
  \ him too, having chosen to attack him on the battlefield of the mind. Thaleon felt\
  \ a surge of pride; if she wished to play with occult magic, she’d picked the wrong\
  \ opponent.</p> \n      <p>As the rakshasa leapt forward, Thaleon transmuted his\
  \ pride into certainty and fortitude, summoning a disc of force in the air. Claws\
  \ met the barrier and cracked it like glass, but Thaleon’s brow furrowed as he poured\
  \ more will, more certainty, into the spell. More translucent shields sprung into\
  \ being, and though the rakshasa’s claws shattered two of the discs, they could\
  \ do no more than carve a groove into the third. She rebounded back, and Thaleon\
  \ released a stream of chaotic emotion that collected around the rakshasa’s feet,\
  \ dragging her to the ground, but not before she wove shadows into a bolt of flame\
  \ that clipped Thaleon’s side.</p> \n      <p>Arm throbbing, Thaleon’s fury blotted\
  \ out all thought, bursting forth as the air shook with color. While the rakshasa\
  \ was getting to her feet, he painted again, pouring out his heart to form not just\
  \ one rage-blade, but an entire storm of them hovering above the alleyway. </p>\

  \ of thought. Art by João Fiuza</p> \n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <p>With\
  \ an oily green flash of the rakshasa’s eyes, a sickening vision filled Thaleon’\
  s mind—a group of rakshasas savoring a platter of roast meat unmistakably elven\
  \ in origin. For an instant, the artist’s stomach churned before he recognized the\
  \ intrusion and broke the enchantment. This twisted scene was the rakshasa’s dream,\
  \ not his. Still, if she expected him to be sick... he retched loudly, hoping the\
  \ monster’s pride would dull her suspicions. Right on cue, she charged, claws extended,\
  \ running at full speed until she was just below the hanging blades. Thaleon rose\
  \ from the ground, and with a last exertion, let the blades fall, each sharper and\
  \ more jagged than the last.</p> \n      <p>The rain lasted for only a moment, but\
  \ when it was finished, Thaleon’s fury subsided, replaced by relief and sorrow for\
  \ the fiend’s past victims. No more rakshasas threatened Niswan that day.</p> \n\
