  \ <br> Erik Mona's odd T-shaped map that would eventually become the Inner Sea Region\
  \ of Golarion.\n    </div> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As 2007 dawned,\
  \ Paizo had a lot of work to do. The final issues of <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ were coming in August, and we had already started thinking about what we were\
  \ going to do once they had run their course. Wizards of the Coast wanted to make\
  \ an announcement about the magazines coming to an end sooner rather than later,\
  \ but we knew that this announcement was going to cause an uproar with a fury usually\
  \ reserved for new editions of D&amp;D—maybe even bigger—and when people came to\
  \ us with questions, we wanted to have answers. Once again, Wizards was gracious,\
  \ and allowed us to make the announcement on our own schedule.</span></p> \n   \
  \ <p>Our customers were used to getting something from us every month and we didn't\
  \ want that to end. But starting a new magazine was not the way to go. Even if we\
  \ had wanted to try to replace our venerable magazines, we just didn't have the\
  \ cash reserves needed to make it happen. Besides, the magazine industry isn't what\
  \ it used to be, and the profit margins on magazines are razor thin; I was very\
  \ tired of fighting all the inefficiences of that product format.</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ we took the thing that was working the best—the Adventure Path concept—and reshaped\
  \ it into a 96-page softcover book that would provide a full AP over six consecutive\
  \ monthly volumes. The front half of each book would be the Adventure Path, while\
  \ the back half would house support articles and a short piece of fiction. In many\
  \ ways, the front was <i>Dungeon</i> and the back was <i>Dragon</i>. The new book\
  \ had the same number of pages as an issue of <i>Dungeon</i>, but since it didn't\
  \ have all the advertisements, we actually had more content to develop each month.\
  \ Also, it took 12 issues of <i>Dungeon</i> to complete an AP, and we were now attempting\
  \ to do it in half the time. This task was going to be a tough one.</p> \n    <p>After\
  \ much brainstorming, we eventually gave it the name \"Pathfinder.\" (See the sidebar\
  \ below for a look at how we came up with the name.)</p> \n    <table align=\"center\"\

  \ and much of it survives unchanged in the final Adventure Path.</td>\n      </tr>\n\
  \     </tbody>\n    </table> \n    <p>We also had to think long and hard about pricing.\
  \ The printing quotes we'd received on 96-page full-color softcover books suggested\
  \ that we needed to charge $24.99, a big jump from the advertising-subsidized $7.99\
  \ cover price of <i>Dungeon</i>. And in order to survive, we needed to capture as\
  \ many <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> subscribers as we could, and that meant\
  \ we needed to make a compelling case to our subscribers. </p> \n    <p>Instead\
  \ of $24.99, we set the retail price at $19.99. Then, to entice people to subscribe,\
  \ we set the subscription price at $13.99 plus shipping, with the additional benefits\
  \ of a free PDF and a discount on almost everything we sell at paizo.com. While\
  \ it still cost more than <i>Dragon</i> or <i>Dungeon</i> did, we knew that we were\
  \ providing amazing value, and we believed that once people saw the finished product,\
  \ they'd understand that.</p> \n    <p>Another big problem we had to deal with was\
  \ our subscriber debt. Even though we had stopped offering long-term subscription\
  \ options the year before, and had recently switched entirely to month-to-month\
  \ subscriptions, we had still taken a lot of money over the years for issues that\
  \ would never come out. Some customers had purchased subscriptions extending for\
  \ a frankly startling number of years into the future. I put together a big spreadsheet\
  \ that looked at how many issues of each magazine we owed to each subscriber past\
  \ the last issue, and how much the refunds we owed each of them would be. We looked\
  \ at the cost for making an AP volume and shipping it to various places in the US\
  \ and around the world, and then we had to make a gut-wrenching decision—how many\
  \ volumes do we want to offer subscribers for the remaining value of their subscriptions?\
  \ If we made an offer people couldn't refuse, not only would we not have to give\
  \ a refund to that customer, but we'd get the opportunity to show them that we were\
  \ making a product worth the asking price; hopefully at least some of them would\
  \ keep their Pathfinder subscriptions beyond those volumes. </p> \n    <p>We ended\
  \ up valuing these copies at such a low price that we actually lost money on almost\
  \ all of them. That is, it cost us more to make and ship each copy than it would\
  \ have cost to give refunds to the same people. But there was a benefit in addition\
  \ to the chance to woo them over to Pathfinder: the cost of fulfilling those volumes\
  \ to subscribers was spread over many months. If we'd had to write everyone refund\
  \ checks all at once, that would have put us out of business. We also mitigated\
  \ this problem by offering people the ability to fulfill their remaining issues\
  \ from our stock of back issues, and by offering the option of taking a higher amount\
  \ of store credit—120%—instead of cash.</p> \n    <p>My budget had around 20% of\
  \ our subscribers taking the Pathfinder AP volumes instead of a refund check. I\
  \ assumed about 30% would take the store credit option, with the remaining 50% asking\
  \ for the refund check. I hoped we'd do better than that, that maybe closer to 50%\
  \ would take the AP volumes, but I budget for what I feel is the most likely course.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We also offered a special messageboard tag for people who committed to\
  \ an ongoing Pathfinder subscription before they even saw the first volume (not\
  \ just transitioning issues from their <i>Dungeon</i> or <i>Dragon</i> subscription,\
  \ but making an actual commitment beyond that). These early supporters received\
  \ the Pathfinder Adventure Path Charter Subscriber tag, which they'll keep for as\
  \ long as they keep their AP subscription going. Charter subscribers who stop their\
  \ subs for even a single volume lose their charter status, so the number of charter\
  \ tags slowly decreases over time; there are just 1,075 as I write this. The trust\
  \ and ongoing support of our charter subscribers means a lot to us.</p> \n    <p>With\
  \ our plans in place, we set a date with Wizards of the Coast to announce the end\
  \ of <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>. April 19, 2007 was going to be a nerve-wracking\
  \ day for the Paizo staff as we unveiled our new plans and then sat back to see\
  \ what would happen. Would it be the end of our company, or the beginning of a whole\
  \ new adventure? Would unhappy subscribers come to our offices with pitchforks and\
  \ torches? As always, the power rested in the hands of our customers.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>At 9:00 AM PST, the paizo.com website was taken down for the first time other\
  \ than to do maintenance; you can see the page we put up <a href=\"/teaser\">here</a>.\
  \ We were down for approximately two hours while we readied all of the press releases,\
  \ subscription offerings, FAQs, and such, and when the website came back up at 11\
  \ AM, in addition to the <a href=\"/paizo/news/dragon/pressReleases/v5748eaic9kh0\"\
  >press release about the magazines</a> there was <a href=\"/transition/publisher\"\
  >a message from Erik</a> and we soon added <a href=\"/transition/ceo\">a message\
  \ from me</a> on the front page. We explained about the magazines, and we explained\
  \ about Pathfinder. Then we watched, interacted with everyone posting on the messageboards,\
  \ and waited. And the most remarkable thing in my history in the industry happened.\
  \ People came out of the woodwork to support us and stick by us. In the end, close\
  \ to 66% of all subscribers ended up taking us up on our offer to send them Pathfinder\
  \ AP volumes in place of their refund, better than double my budget. (The largest\
  \ number of AP volumes received in lieu of a refund: 44!)</p> \n    <p>Also on that\
  \ day, we launched the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2007/april/v5748dyo5la7m\">Paizo blog</a>,\
  \ which has now become a daily dose of Paizo news! We introduced Varisia on day\
  \ 1, and the goblins on <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2007/april/v5748dyo5la7l\">day 2</a>!\
  \ In the days leading up to the launch of the Pathfinder AP at Gen Con, we unveiled\
  \ the new iconics, talked about the non-adventure content, and basically tried to\
  \ keep up everyone's interest as we headed to launch. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  /image/content/Blog/20120726-Packages_90.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> Postage\
  \ for the first Pathfinder subscription shipment pours out of our label printer\
  \ in August 2007. (Our label runs are much more organized now.) And the same shipment\
  \ neatly packed up and waiting for the Post Office.\n    </div> \n    <p>Of course,\
  \ there was a still a lot of work that needed to be done. With the magazines, we\
  \ simply generated an Excel spreadsheet which we then uploaded to our printer, and\
  \ they took care of all of the logistics of sending issues to subscribers. Starting\
  \ in August, we were going to have to do that ourselves for the first time. We weren't\
  \ exactly rookies at shipping products to people; we'd been running the paizo.com\
  \ store for a few years, and it had grown to a pretty decent sized business. But\
  \ the sheer volume of a single subscription run dwarfed any amount we had ever shipped\
  \ at one time thus far. We needed to be able to print out massive numbers of labels\
  \ at one time—check out the pictures of our first label run in this blog—and then\
  \ have the manpower to pack them all as quickly as possible. It was \"all hands\
  \ on deck,\" and even Jeff Alvarez and myself spent many a long hour packing and\
  \ shipping Pathfinder AP volumes that year.</p> \n    <p>But the APs weren't the\
  \ only new line of products. In February, we had announced our line of GameMastery\
  \ Modules launching in June with Nicolas Logue's now classic <a href=\"/products/btpy7yqz\"\
  >Crown of the Kobold King</a> adventure. Our first Free RPG Day product was <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy82r0\">Hollow's Last Hope</a>, a lead-in adventure for Kobold King\
  \ that we also gave away as a free PDF on our website as a way of enticing folks\
  \ to try out the new line of adventures. Follow-up adventures by Jason Bulmahn and\
  \ James Sutter rounded out the GameMastery Modules launch titles leading up to Gen\
  \ Con.</p> \n    <p>In March, we announced the Planet Stories line. The result of\
  \ Erik Mona's love of old sword-and-planet fiction, Planet Stories was all about\
  \ bringing out-of-print classics to a new generation of fans. We launched with a\
  \ super strong line-up of Robert E. Howard, Gary Gygax, Michael Moorcock and C.L.\
  \ Moore. Our hope with this line was that we could gain a foothold into bookstores\
  \ with a product type they were used to carrying, and then leverage that into our\
  \ RPG products. We also wanted to establish a line of products that weren't tied\
  \ to our RPG business in case that didn't work out as well as we'd hoped. </p> \n\
  \    <p>Our other GameMastery products started to really take off in 2007. We had\
  \ been selling Steel Sqwire's existing Flip-Mats for a few months before we released\
  \ the first of our own designs, <a href=\"/products/btpy8krp\">Flip-Mat: Tavern</a>.\
  \ We've released a new Flip-Mat every other month since then. Our biggest GameMastery\
  \ release for the year, though, was a product that has since become a gaming table\
  \ staple—the <a href=\"/products/btpy872f\">Critical Hit Deck</a>. Masterminded\
  \ by Jason Bulmahn, the Critical Hit Deck has perhaps put more characters in the\
  \ ground than any accessory in gaming history and has been a consistently great\
  \ seller for Paizo.</p> \n    <p>Of course, we still had the final issues of both\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> to deliver, and we planned to go out with a bang!\
  \ The final issues of <i>Dragon</i> had a slew of Demonomicons and Core Beliefs\
  \ articles, as well as the world of China Miéville, the World Serpent Inn, and a\
  \ super-sized final issue returning to some of the most iconic articles in <i>Dragon</i>'s\
  \ storied history, capped off with a cover by Larry Elmore!</p> \n    <p><i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ finished off the Savage Tide adventure path with a return to the Isle of Dread\
  \ and a faceoff with the prince of demons, Demogorgon himself! In addition, Nick\
  \ Logue returned to Scuttlecove one more time and Jason Bulmahn penned his infamous\
  \ \"Kill Bargle\" adventure in the final issue.</p> \n    <p>One of the best things\
  \ about publishing <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines was the ability to\
  \ constantly try out new talent. It's really hard to try out new talent without\
  \ risking the destruction of your production schedule if the new guy screws up his\
  \ assignment. Matter of fact, trying out new talent was the very reason that the\
  \ Class Acts section of <i>Dragon</i> was created. With the magazines going away,\
  \ Paizo was going to need to find a new way to cultivate design talent. </p> \n\
  \    <p>I was ruminating on this problem when an idea came to me. Vic and I are\
  \ fans of American Idol; I love the fact that talented unknowns can become overnight\
  \ stars by winning that competition. Could we do the same thing for RPG designers?\
  \ And thus was RPG Superstar born. Anybody could enter by designing a wondrous item,\
  \ and our esteemed panel of judges (that season, Wolfgang Baur, Erik Mona and Clark\
  \ Petersen) would hand-pick the top 32 before our community voted to winnow that\
  \ number down via various design challenges until we had a winner. The prize was\
  \ a paid gig to write a 32-page GameMastery Adventure. More than 1,000 people entered\
  \ the contest that kicked off late that year, with the winner being crowned in early\
  \ 2008.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120726-Stonehenge.jpg\"\

  \ James Ernest.\n    </div> \n    <p>Our Titanic Games line released its most ambitious\
  \ product in May. <a href=\"/products/btpy7vq5\">Stonehenge</a> was not just a board\
  \ game, but a flexible toolkit that could be used to create a wide variety of new\
  \ board games, sold with rules for five different Stonehenge games from the world's\
  \ best game designers. We published a sixth game from Paul Peterson called \"Stonehenge\
  \ Rocks\" in the July issue of <i>Knucklebones</i> magazine, and launched the Stonehenge\
  \ Library on paizo.com, where game designers of all stripes could easily publish\
  \ rules for their own games and anyone could download them as a fully formatted\
  \ PDF. To date, 42 different games have been posted there for free download!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Gen Con 2007 was one of the most memorable in Paizo's history. Not only\
  \ were we sending <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> off with epic final issues, but\
  \ we were putting the Pathfinder Adventure Path into the hands of customers for\
  \ the first time. I felt like an expectant parent waiting for the doors to open\
  \ on Thursday morning. We'd decorated the booth with large banners of Karzoug, Valeros\
  \ and Seoni. We were running a delve in the booth based on the Seven Swords of Sin\
  \ module, crafted by the evil minds of the combined Paizo staff as we each tried\
  \ to outdo each other in killing the most characters. Stats were kept throughout\
  \ the convention; Phil Lacefield Jr, collected the most overall kills, while Erik\
  \ Mona's vrock chamber was the single deadliest room.</p> \n    <p>Gen Con has always\
  \ been a place where Paizo has made some of our biggest announcements, and this\
  \ year it was the impending release of the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting\
  \ in early 2008. With the launch of the Pathfinder AP and the GameMastery Modules,\
  \ everyone was clamoring to know more about the world we were setting them in. Erik\
  \ and Jason had already began throwing around ideas for filling out the world around\
  \ Varisia, but that's a story for next year...</p> \n    <p>At the ENnie Awards\
  \ that Gen Con, Paizo won 2 golds and a silver. The awards received were:</p> \n\

  \ \n    <p>Sales during the convention were brisk, and the feedback we received\
  \ from our customers was nothing short of fantastic. And we needed all that good\
  \ karma, because we were dealt another blow when Wizards of the Coast announced\
  \ at the show that D&amp;D 4th Edition was coming in August 2008. We had just launched\
  \ two new lines of 3.5 compatible products, and it seemed that they could already\
  \ be on a deathwatch towards obscurity. Sometimes it seemed as if every time we\
  \ got up, there was something to knock us down again.</p> \n    <p>However, after\
  \ talks with our colleagues at Wizards of the Coast, we were cautiously optimistic.\
  \ There was talk of getting together when we were back in Seattle and running through\
  \ a playtest of the current rules. We were also promised that there would be a third-party\
  \ license, similar to the OGL, really soon. </p> \n    <p>When we got back to Seattle,\
  \ we anxiously awaited the opportunity to playtest 4th Edition, but that never materialized,\
  \ and the license that eventually became the GSL was delayed month after month.\
  \ Meanwhile, the more the public learned about 4th Edition, the more our community—\
  and our gut—was telling us not to go there.</p> \n    <p>One of the largest threads\
  \ on the paizo.com messageboards began in October, when Erik announced that <a href=\"\
  /forums/dmtyzaad\">Paizo Is Still Undecided</a>. The lack of any information from\
  \ WotC and the seemingly overwhelming support for us to stay put were making us\
  \ lean towards sticking with 3.5, but it would be suicide to produce support products\
  \ for a game that no longer has core rules in print. So if we wanted to stick with\
  \ 3.5, we knew that we'd have to release some sort of rulebook.</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ the end of 2007 neared, we still held out hope that things might work out for\
  \ 4th Edition. But we were already planning the Pathfinder Adventure Path that would\
  \ begin shipping the same month that Wizards was releasing 4th Edition, and the\
  \ deadline for soliciting August 2008 products to our distributors was rapidly approaching,\
  \ so we needed to make a decision, and fast. </p> \n    <p>As the year ended, our\
  \ new product lines were well-received, and the new Paizo was looking healthier\
  \ than ever. But the decision about 4th Edition was now reaching a critical stage\
  \ and the new year would again test our mettle. Fortunately, Jason Bulmahn had started\
  \ tinkering on his own time with some ideas he had for a 3.5 revision, a project\

  \ In the lower left-hand corner, \"Path\" and \"Finder\" are conveniently near each\
  \ other. Coincidence?\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Naming Pathfinder</b></p> \n    <p>With\
  \ the name Pathfinder so prevalent in everything we make nowadays, it's almost hard\
  \ to believe that six years ago, we were struggling with what we were going to call\
  \ our new line. If you've ever been involved in a brainstorm for naming something,\
  \ you'll know that it's an agonizing process. We gathered the Paizo creative staff\
  \ into the conference room and started to brainstorm words that we associate with\
  \ adventures. Here we see the notes Wes Schneider took from our brainstorm. Once\
  \ we had a list of words, we started combining some of them to make potential names,\
  \ so if we had the words crypt, morning, crawl, star, and sword, we'd try names\
  \ like like Starsword, Morningstar, Cryptcrawl... After three long meetings, nobody\
  \ was entirely happy with what we'd come up with. The leading candidate for quite\
  \ a while was actually \"Kobold,\" because we like the little buggers, and because\
  \ we thought it would be a neat homage to <i>Dragon</i> Magazine (it turns out that\
  \ Wolfgang Baur had a similar thought process when he named his new magazine). Pathfinder\
  \ was one of the names that made the finalist list, but it took us a while (and\
  \ a successful trademark search) to convince us that we'd found the path we were\
  \ seeking.</p> \n    <p>Lisa Stevens<br> <i>CEO</i></p> \n    <h2>Chris Self: His\
  \ Account of Things</h2> \n    <p>In summer 2007, Paizo wasn't even on my radar.\
  \ I had looked at the website once or twice, mostly looking for dice, but I didn't\
  \ have any ties to the company at the time. I wasn't a fan of the magazines, all\
  \ of my adventures were homebrew, and I didn't have enough money to buy much of\
  \ anything, let alone do it through an online store I'd never heard of anyone else\
  \ using.</p> \n    <p>Earlier that year, I had packed up my books and my cats in\
  \ an old station wagon, given away all of my furniture, quit my job, and moved to\
  \ Seattle. I had always promised myself that I would get out of Albuquerque, and\
  \ now that I had finished my degree and had a few years of work under my belt, I'd\
  \ decided it was time to make good on that promise.</p> \n    <p>Once I arrived\
  \ in Seattle, I threw around some applications and resumes, found a place to live,\
  \ all the normal things you do when you move to a new city on a whim. </p> \n  \
  \  <p>When I got the email from Lisa that she wanted me to come in for an interview,\
  \ I was surprised. I had sent in my resume weeks earlier and had, in fact, accepted\
  \ and been working another job for several weeks. But I was not about to turn down\
  \ a chance to interview for a game company. So, in for the interview I went.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The offices were a surprise. I don't know what I was expecting, but it\
  \ wasn't boxes of magazines scattered about, product stacked on shelves in offices,\
  \ and an office open but mostly deserted after 6 pm. Once I finally tracked down\
  \ Lisa and started my interview with her and Paizo's corporate accountant, Dave\
  \ Erickson... that's when the magic of Paizo struck me for the first time.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The vision that Lisa laid out for the company was... enticing. A magazine\
  \ publisher for D&amp;D who was also rolling out a series of science-fiction classics\
  \ and expanding their gaming product lines sounded like exactly the type of company\
  \ I wanted to work for. When Lisa offered me the job, there was no hesitation, despite\
  \ the hefty cut in pay I was taking to take the job.</p> \n    <p>My first day in\
  \ the office is also my most memorable. I had been set up in a desk in a cul-de-sac\
  \ in the hallway, straddling the area between sales, accounting, Lisa's office,\
  \ and the editorial pit, and with a view straight down the hallway to see all of\
  \ the offices that it wasn't adjacent to. This gave me an excellent view of a certain\
  \ PMG putting an Amazon package on the desk of a certain other employee (who will\
  \ remain nameless). This also gave me an excellent view of said employee opening\
  \ this box. This box contained a spider. An electronic spider. A remote controlled\
  \ electronic jumping spider. And a certain PMG held the remote. The best view, though,\
  \ was of a large man screaming like a little girl and running, cussing, from his\
  \ office.</p> \n    <p>Yeah, that first day let me know that I had really made the\
  \ right choice in choosing to work at Paizo.</p> \n    <p>That decision has proven\
  \ a wise one over the last five years. Paizo has been the first job that I've looked\
  \ forward to coming to every morning. The people I work with are remarkable, every\
  \ single one of them; the company is amazing; I believe in the product; and I feel\
  \ valued every day.</p> \n    <p>Since this is my moment in the spotlight on the\
  \ blog, I would like to close with one note: Dave Erickson, the accountant whom\
  \ I initially worked under at Paizo, was an excellent accountant, and one of the\
  \ most scrupulously ethical people I've ever met. I learned a great deal from him,\
  \ and learned even more from him once I shouldered his duties after his passing.\
  \ You are missed, Dave. </p>\n    <p>Chris Self<br> <i>Finance Manager</i></p> \n\
