  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, September 1, 2011</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\"\
  >\n    <img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOCUP001E_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  >\n    <br> Check out our <a href=\"/communityuse/package\">Community Use Package</a>!\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>So some of you may or may not know that we updated some parts\
  \ of our Community Use Package the other day. Some of you may or may not know what\
  \ that even <i>means</i>, which is a darn shame, since we put out some really cool,\
  \ really <i>free</i> stuff that people don't even know about. In addition to the\
  \ Player's Guides for each new Adventure Path we put out every six months, below\
  \ is a list of some neato things that we put on our site that you can use for free\
  \ under our <a href=\"/paizo/about/communityuse\">Community Use Policy</a>.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Reference Document</b><br> At Gen Con,\
  \ I realized that a lot of people didn't know that you don't even need to buy most\
  \ of our products to enjoy them, and that <i>we put up all our rules on our own\
  \ website for free</i>. It's kind of this insane marketing scheme we have, where\
  \ we like our customers so much that we give you all the rules you need to play\
  \ our game for free, and it totally works. It's called the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/\"\
  >Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Reference Document</a>, and it's a giant archive of\
  \ all our rules, so that you can play the game without even opening your book up.\
  \ It's searchable, official, totally free, and updated often.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n\
  \   <p><b>Community Use Package</b><br> The <a href=\"/communityuse/package\">Community\
  \ Use Package</a> consist of files we provide freely on our website, including big\
  \ ol' maps of our world, symbols to put on your own maps, character sheets, and\
  \ other cool icons and logos to use as you may. We're pretty down with our fans\
  \ using things we make to express their appreciation for our products, and you can\
  \ use a lot of our campaign setting stuff for your own needs as long as you comply\
  \ with our <a href=\"/paizo/about/communityuse\">Community Use Policy</a>.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Pathfinder Society Introductory Scenarios</b><br> Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play is getting pretty popular. We just kicked off <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/season3\"\
  >Season 3</a> of Pathfinder Society a couple months ago, and to commemorate the\
  \ event we released three free full-length scenarios to introduce new and veteran\
  \ players alike to the exciting world of our organized play campaign! Scroll down\
  \ to the bottom of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/season3\">the linked page\
  \ here</a> and check them out! In addition, you can get yourself a free copy of\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy84k4\">Guide to Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play</a> on our website as well.</p> \n   <p><b>Free RPG Day</b><br>\
  \ If you don't know about <a href=\"http://freerpgday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Free\
  \ RPG Day</a> already, you've been missing out. But that's okay! Because you can\
  \ still download the products we release on these esteemed occasions on our website.\
  \ Our last Free PRG Day product was the module <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8j5w\"\
  ><i>We Be Goblins</i></a>, which is an absolute blast, and in the past we've put\
  \ out the much-acclaimed <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8ey4\"\
  ><i>Master of the Fallen Fortress</i></a> module and the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88x4\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Bonus Bestiary</i></a>, which includes plenty of baddies to throw\
  \ at your players.</p> \n   <p>Patrick Renie<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n  </blockquote>\
