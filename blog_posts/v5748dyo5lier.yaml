  \ where I was a guest at <a href=\"http://www.s-c-a-r-a-b.com\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >SCARAB</a>, a gaming convention with a very strong Pathfinder Society presence\
  \ operated by Regional Venture-Coordinator Delbert Collins II. This was my fifth\
  \ year making the trip, and it's always a really great opportunity to see familiar\
  \ faces, play a few adventures, and shout my throat raw while GMing. The kill count\
  \ stayed relatively modest, barring two gentlemen laid low during <a href=\"/products/btpy9hgy\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-11: Ancients' Anguish</em></a> who acknowledged\
  \ their characters' demise with admirable grace and both came back to life in order\
  \ to finish what they had started. I also enjoyed my first chance to actually play\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-98: Serpents\
  \ Rise</em></a>, as presented by Venture-Captain Matt Polkowsky.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ two slots on Monday were eerily repetitive yet uniquely enjoyable because I first\
  \ played then GMed <a href=\"/products/btpy9hh0\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #7-13: Captive in Crystal</em></a>. The first table (expertly run by Venture-Lieutenant\
  \ Landon Hatfield) had some of the most bizarre characters, including a kitsune\
  \ cleric of Daikitsu who stayed in Tiny fox form, a body-building monk/paladin of\
  \ Kurgess (for some reason I never considered Kurgess as a patron of paladins, but\
  \ it was fun), and an extraordinarily plucky investigator/swashbuckler fashioned\
  \ after Nancy Drew—all teamed up with my \"cleric\" of the reformed Church of Razmir.\
  \ When I ran the same adventure a few hours later, I had the pleasure of introducing\
  \ a player's black blade magus to his intelligent sword (\"What's your blade's agenda?\
  \ Oh, would you like me to help you come up with one? Oh good...\"), which kept\
  \ whispering promises about something called \"the Reclamation.\" We figured out\
  \ that the chaotic good scimitar has somewhat cutthroat dreams of destroying Taldor\
  \ and conquering it in Qadira's name, and by the end of the adventure, the magus\
  \ had secured substantial resources that might fuel Kelishite aggression against\
  \ their northern neighbors.</p> \n    <p>All in all, it was a great deal of fun.\
  \ If you have a chance to make the trip to SCARAB in the future, I strongly encourage\
  \ you check it out.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\" style=\"width:380px !important;\"\

  \ the meantime, why not plan ahead to experience some new stories together? This\
  \ month we have two new adventures debuting this week. The first launches a three-part,\
  \ Tier 1-5 series called \"Faithless and Forgotten,\" in which infernal Cheliax\
  \ opens its borders once more to Pathfinder explorers. During <a href=\"/products/btpy9huv\"\
  ><em>Let Bygones Be</em></a>, the PCs are among the first sanctioned Pathfinders\
  \ to travel Cheliax in decades, and their first destination is a relic of the Chelish\
  \ civil war. In order to get there, they'll need to travel through the fortified\
  \ port of Corentyn, where the streets are dangerous despite—or perhaps because of—\
  the brutal regime's guards. It's up to the PCs to make a good first impression and\
  \ make the most of this preliminary foray. Of course, the last time we traveled\
  \ to Cheliax on official business, the Pathfinder Society had an official liaison\
  \ to that nation: Paracountess Zarta Dralneen. Always one for formality, Cheliax\
  \ has issued a new liaison to the Grand Lodge. As you can imagine, Zarta is going\
  \ to be so thrilled to meet her replacement. This was also a great opportunity to\
  \ revisit some known locations and personalities in Corentyn, including one Zefiro\
  \ Balinger who plays a rather central role in the upcoming adventure.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>About three years ago, the organized play campaign retired the Lantern Lodge\
  \ as a playable faction, and it's certainly easy to assume that the Lantern Lodge\
  \ itself (an estate in Goka) just faded into obscurity. In fact, the faction retired\
  \ largely because it had fulfilled its goals of achieving recognition and resources\
  \ for the Society's exploration of Tian Xia. I like to revisit the continent several\
  \ times a season, and this month we're doing something a little different. Rather\
  \ than just letting the players know that Venture-Captain Amara Li is still in charge\
  \ of a thriving lodge, this time the PCs are working for her directly to hunt down\
  \ an Aspis Consortium aggressor. What's more, this adventure has special metaplot\
  \ opportunities for former members of the Lantern Lodge faction. That's not the\
  \ only unique element in <a href=\"/products/btpy9huw\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #7-15: The Deepmarket Deception</em></a>. We're also exploring a hitherto unseen\
  \ part of that metropolis: the Deepmarket tunnels that crisscross the city's foundation\
  \ and overflow with smugglers and illicit commerce. Prepare for a Tier 3-7 challenge\
  \ that expands on the events of <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"><em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Special #6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a>!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
