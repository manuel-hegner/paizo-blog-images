  >traders</a>, precision is one of the subthemes of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask\"\
  >Mummy's Mask Adventure Path</a> for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. This topic\
  \ doesn't get as much attention because it's not quite as flashy, but we like it\
  \ because it's a different type of challenge. In this blog, I'll let you know where\
  \ the idea came from and how it ended up.</p> \n   <p>Early on, Lone Shark designers\
  \ Gaby, Paul, and Liz locked in on a key feature of the Pathfinder RPG version of\
  \ the Mummy's Mask Adventure Path. Right at the start of the <a href=\"/products/btpy94qz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-79-The-HalfDead-City\"\
  >the first volume</a>, you participate in a lottery to win the right to explore\
  \ and effectively loot tombs in the Osirian city of Wati. The priests of the Grand\
  \ Mausoleum have a set of three rules that restrict how much collateral damage your\
  \ adventuring can inflict.</p> \n   <p>\"Remember How This Came to Pass\" is a reminder\
  \ that the necropolis remains a holy place. \"Every Slave's Hut Is a Memorial\"\
  \ instructs explorers that willful and unnecessary destruction of tombs will not\
  \ be tolerated. \"Honor the Departed\" requires that the dead be treated with respect.\
  \ These rules are enforced by a militant group within the church of Pharasma known\
  \ as the Voices of the Spire.</p> \n   <p>We modeled that in a simple mechanic:\
  \ If you achieve too high a number in your roll to defeat a bane or acquire a boon,\
  \ you break something you shouldn't. This makes the Voices of the Spire angry, and\
  \ they wail on your heads for it.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>You break it, you buy it.</p>\n   </div> \n   <p>There are places\
  \ you should also tread carefully. The Scorched Obelisk is a jittery lightning magnet.\
  \ The Alchemical Laboratory is filled with fragile flasks of acid, so watch where\
  \ you swing that greatclub. And Ptah knows how you're supposed to guarantee threading\
  \ the needle in the pottery-littered Sculptors' Lair.</p> \n   <p>Even your allies\
  \ don't let you get away with bashing about unchecked. The Stained Glass Elemental\
  \ shatters at a moment's notice, taking the top card of the blessings deck with\
  \ it.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-ScorchedObelisk.jpg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-StainedGlassElemental_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    <p>Good news! If you close the unstable Sculptors' Lair, you can get\
  \ an equally unstable Stained Glass Elemental.</p>\n   </div> \n   <p>We've offered\
  \ up several banes that care about the number you roll. The Shasalqu will freeze\
  \ you with cold if you hit it too hard. The Thriae Soldier will sting you with poison.\
  \ The Shocking Chest will zort you with electricity. The Yellow Jelly will scorch\
  \ you with acid. We expect you will fall prey to all those elements at one point\
  \ or another.</p> \n   <p>The barrier Collapsing Scaffolding has an even trickier\
  \ challenge. You must attempt two Dexterity, Acrobatics, or Perception checks, but\
  \ if the result of your first check exceeds the result of the second, you get smashed\
  \ by the scaffolding. You'll be tempted to shortchange the first check, even though\
  \ you only need to hit a 4, maybe by trying that Perception check you never make.\
  \ And then when you fail that check...</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \
  \  <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Shasalqu.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>I admit I am not sure how to pronounce \"Shasalqu.\"</p>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>Henchmen and villains get in on this act. If you overroll, the henchman\
  \ Neqet won't bother damaging you himself; instead, he'll call a zombie buddy to\
  \ rough you up. In Adventure Deck 4, the villain Half-Fiend Sphinx and the henchmen\
  \ Userib and Cultist of Areshkagal damage you if you are too overbearing.</p> \n\
  \   <p>The Mining Construct goes the other way, offering you an item if you defeat\
  \ it by 5 or less. The henchmen in the delightfully named scenario Tomb Raiders\
  \ Gone Rogue are particularly touchy. Most raiders let you attempt to close your\
  \ location only when you defeat them by less than 5; otherwise, you've got a lot\
  \ more exploring to do. But if you do hit under their threshold, you can get a bunch\
  \ of boons, so moderating your thuggery can pay off in the tombs.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ lamia villain Jamirah also gives you something for hitting a narrow window above\
  \ what you need to defeat her. (Actually, you get to draw the card even if you roll\
  \ too low to defeat her, but intentionally losing to a villain is not something\
  \ we recommend.)</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-Heqet.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>Hmmm. I wonder if she's related to the Wrath of the Righteous villain\
  \ Shamira?</p>\n   </div> \n   <p>Debuting in Adventure Deck 6 is the Glass Boat,\
  \ the first and only instance of a new type of support card called a barge. When\
  \ you're in the boat (and the scenario Crypt of Water will make you want to be),\
  \ being very precise can get you a free Alchemical or Liquid item. Being a lumbering\
  \ ox means no potion for you.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>We're gonna need a bigger boat.</p>\n   </div> \n   <p>Fear not,\
  \ though! We've provided several new ways to get those numbers where you want them.\
  \ Obviously, there are lots of ways to add static numbers to your checks. Reducing\
  \ the number of dice you roll while increasing the static number you add will stabilize\
  \ your roll, giving you some control over your result.</p> \n   <p>You can't beat\
  \ the ability to adjust your number after you roll. We highly recommend shifting\
  \ your object of worship to the law deity Maat. A Feather of Maat is a Luckstone\
  \ that runs both ways, and the later Effigy of Maat gives you even more versatility.\
  \ The Blessing of Maat not only allows you to add or subtract 3, but even change\
  \ all your dice to d8s if that's what you need.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>Who ever thought that you'd like seeing the word \"subtract\" on\
  \ a card? Maat did.</p>\n   </div> \n   <p>You melee types might want to pick up\
  \ the Scorpion Whip. Any spellcaster can pick up the Symbol of Fortune, which will\
  \ add or subtract 3 after the roll. The loot item Tablet of Languages Lost is good\
  \ for adding to or subtracting from your Charisma check, especially if you're playing\
  \ a Sorcerer blasting your way through the catacombs; so's the Silken Ceremonial\
  \ Armor.</p> \n   <p>The item Jet of Anubis can either add or remove a whole die.\
  \ Trust me, you haven't lived till you remove the 12 you rolled on your d12. Similarly,\
  \ the Blessing of the Lady of Graves lets you roll your Wisdom die and subtract\
  \ it from your result.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-ScorpionWhip.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>I can't play Symbol of Fortune without imitating a game show audience.</p>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>Your friends can also help. The Cleric of Nethys can add or subtract\
  \ 2 from your roll, while the half-orc ally Magha Threefingers adds 3 or subtracts\
  \ 2. The banshee Ausetitha can add or subtract 5. (Fun fact: The designers are still\
  \ snickering about Magha's power.)</p> \n   <p>Meanwhile, the promo ally Miau Pakhet\
  \ lets anyone at your location reroll a die, which is quite useful when you need\
  \ to be precise. Plus that second power is nothing to flick your tail at.</p> \n\
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-MaghaThreefingers.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>Dude, you have weird friends.</p>\n   </div> \n   <p>Then there are\
  \ the more unhinged decisions you can make. If your party has a Remove Curse spell\
  \ (or if you're Alahazra), you could even pick up a Curse of Withering. Replacing\
  \ all your dice with lower-size dice can keep those high numbers under control.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>If you're in the Garden of Ossumentals, consider adding the Bludgeoning\
  \ or Fire trait—or both! The first can add a die, and the second can remove one.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>You might consider trying to get all your dice to be small. A Wand of\
  \ Scorching Ray might not seem great to you Arcane casters, except when <i>not</i>\
  \ rolling that Arcane d12 is what you want. Suddenly just rolling 4d6 is interesting.\
  \ Especially if you're playing in The Dragon's Garden...</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  \ our favorite—and what might be <i>your</i> least favorite—use of precision in\
  \ the whole game. Just like the villain Tef-Naju giving you his Trove only if you\
  \ roll 35 or less to defeat him, the dragon trader Shardizhad is not impressed easily.\
  \ She will only trade with you if the result of your check to acquire a boon is\
