  \ are pleased to offer the most thorough genealogical services in all of—oh, you're\
  \ a sorcerer.</p> \n     <p>No, no! Don't say anything. You're screaming it loudly\
  \ enough already, from that tacky dragon tattoo to the gaudy \"gold\" embroidery\
  \ on your robe. Who even wears a robe in the summer? I just want one month to go\
  \ by without seeing one of you deadbeats in here!</p> \n     <p>Let me guess? You\
  \ know a few fire spells, some scales on your tuckus, and you daddy's cousin's great-aunt\
  \ claims she spent a sweaty summer night with Mengkare. And now you want me to dig\
  \ up some proof of their salacious interspecies gambol so you can embrace your destiny\
  \ or claim your family fortune or settle a drunken bet?</p> \n     <p>Well you know\
  \ what? <i>You're paying up front!</i> I'm tired of getting stiffed when you lot\
  \ find out there's not a drop of dragon blood in your veins, and storm out in a\
  \ huff!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Oh, what's that? You say \"Mom had\
  \ a tail, so grandma must've been a dragon!\" Pssht! Dragons are a half-step down\
  \ from gods, and you're about three square meals better than a goblin. And I know\
  \ you know that; that's why you want me to tell you you're really half-dragon. But\
  \ a dragon wants to make babies with you about as much as you want to make babies\
  \ with your rose bush! Sure, there might be a few weirdoes out there, but that takes\
  \ some pretty low self-esteem or a legendary quantity of whiskey!</p> \n     <p>Oh,\
  \ but you're so sure you're the exception, are you? Ha, I say! Ha! Remember when\
  \ I said they were close to gods? They change all the rules. Make 'em <i>funny</i>.\
  \ They don't need carnal relations to leave their mark on the world. Maybe your\
  \ grandpappy was a loyal servant for some wyrm, and just picked up a little taint\
  \ to his blood hanging around so much—happens to kobolds all the time! Or maybe\
  \ your great aunt helped slay an ancient wyrm. Or was standing too close when someone\
  \ else did. Maybe your mom built her farm over the grave of some long-dead dragon's\
  \ hoard. There was a lass in here last Rova, we figured out she wound up a sorcerer\
  \ because her alchemist dad got addicted to dragon's blood! Never met a dragon his\
  \ whole life; just bought the blood from a shifty-eyed dwarf, then his daughter\
  \ winds up with claws and spells and a hankering for rubies.</p> \n     <p>Wouldn't\
  \ have happened in my day.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ Lance Red</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>It's not all bad. So you can't order your\
  \ dragon grandma to lay waste to your enemies or claim some legendary pile of gold.\
  \ Most folk can't! But see dragons impact everything they brush up against, not\
  \ just people. They leave knowledge and magic and treasure wherever they go, and\
  \ weirder bits, too. Dragons change the way the world works, and if you study them,\
  \ you can too! There are these eccentrics in Katapesh can draw out dragon magic\
  \ by worshipping dragons like gods—even turn into dragons, from what I hear! And\
  \ Druma has these witches, they learn their magic by gathering up hoards of gold,\
  \ no spooky deals with the powers-that-be required. Heck, we got a gladiator in\
  \ this city who claims she learned to fight from a linnorm, and to see the way she\
  \ tears open anyone that hits her, you'd believe it. You think you're limited without\
  \ dragon blood, but the truth of the whole deal is that you're never limited just\
  \ by your blood.</p> \n     <p>That's why being a genealogist is better than being\
  \ well-bred!</p> \n     <p>Of course, you're still limited by your gold. Secrets\
  \ don't come cheap, whether they're family indiscretions or secret techniques to\
  \ tame a drake. One advantage to the many, many egotistical sorcerers who walk through\
  \ those doors and hire me to peek into draconic history is that I have become quite\
  \ the tidy expert of the subject—Probably the foremost in this city, at any rate—\
  and I just happen to keep a copy all of my notes in this <a href=\"/products/btpy9nfl\"\
  >conveniently portable little folio</a>. It's certainly a good deal cheaper—and\
  \ less disappointing—than paying me to plot out your family tree on the off chance\
  \ you have some scaly kin lurking around.</p> \n     <p>And look at the bright side:\
  \ If you buy <a href=\"/products/btpy9nfl\">the folio</a>, you never have to grapple\
  \ with the existential dread that comes with discovering you're descended from a\
  \ kobold.</p> \n     <p>Crystal Frasier<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n    </div> <!--\
