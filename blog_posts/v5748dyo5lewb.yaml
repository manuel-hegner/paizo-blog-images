  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #71: Rasputin Must Die!</i></a>, where the PCs find\
  \ themselves in Russia in 1918 facing off against animated tanks, headless Cossacks,\
  \ and the \"Mad Monk\" himself, Rasputin! The adventure contains several encounters\
  \ with large numbers of World War I-era Russian soldiers. Rather than treating each\
  \ soldier as an individual foe, they're combined into units with a single stat block\
  \ and new subtype: troop. Encounters with troops aren't meant as studies or simulations\
  \ of modern tactical warfare; rather, by condensing many individual soldiers into\
  \ a single stat block, you can concentrate on the atmosphere of the adventure without\
  \ bogging down every combat round with dozens of die rolls. To whet your appetite\
  \ for early twentieth century adventure, here's a preview of the new troop subtype\
  \ that appears in <i>Rasputin Must Die!</i></span></p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \  <h2>Troops</h2> \n    <p>The troop subtype represents an organized group of trained\
  \ soldiers that act as a unit, rather than as individuals. A troop is something\
  \ of an abstraction, in that the component creatures that make up the troop are\
  \ mostly irrelevant; only the troop as a whole matters for the purposes of combat.\
  \ A troop is similar to a swarm, but is normally composed of Small or Medium creatures.\
  \ Large groups of Tiny or smaller creatures should use the normal swarm rules.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Troop Subtype</b>: A troop is a collection of creatures that acts\
  \ as a single creature, similar to a swarm, but typically as part of a military\
  \ unit. A troop has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A troop\
  \ has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a\
  \ single speed, and a single Armor Class. A troop makes saving throws as a single\
  \ creature.</p> \n    <p>A single troop occupies a 20-foot-by-20-foot square, equal\
  \ in size to a Gargantuan creature, though the actual size category of the troop\
  \ is the same as that of the component creatures. The area occupied by a troop is\
  \ completely shapeable, though the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately\
  \ reflect the teamwork of trained military units. A troop has a reach equal to that\
  \ of the component creatures based on size or armament. A troop can move through\
  \ squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the troop\
  \ provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A troop can move through any\
  \ area large enough for its component creatures.</p> \n    <p>The exact number of\
  \ a troop's component creatures varies, but in general, a troop of Small or Medium\
  \ creatures consists of approximately 12 to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form\
  \ troops, but the area occupied by such a troop should increase proportionally according\
  \ to the size of the component creatures.</p> \n    <p><b>Troop Traits</b>: A troop\
  \ is not subject to flanking, but it is subject to critical hits and sneak attacks\
  \ if its component creatures are subject to such attacks. Reducing a troop to 0\
  \ hit points or fewer causes it to break up, effectively destroying the troop, though\
  \ the damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist\
  \ attack. A troop is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also,\
  \ a troop cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, except by area effects that\
  \ include such effects. A troop can grapple an opponent.</p> \n    <p>A troop is\
  \ immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including\
  \ single-target spells such as <i>disintegrate</i> and multiple target spells such\
  \ as <i>haste</i>), though it is affected by spells or effects that target an area\
  \ or a nonspecific number of creatures (such as <i>fireball</i> or <i>mass hold\
  \ monster</i>). A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects\
  \ that affect an area. If a troop is rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal\
  \ damage, it disperses and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal\
  \ damage.</p> \n    <p><b>Troop Attack</b>: Creatures with the troop subtype don't\
  \ make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature\
  \ within reach or whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack\
  \ roll needed. A troop's stat block has \"troop\" in its Melee entry with no attack\
  \ bonus given. The amount of damage a troop deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown\
  \ in the table on page 313 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.</p> \n    <p>Unless stated\
  \ otherwise, a troop's attacks are nonmagical. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce\
  \ a troop attack's damage to 0 or other special abilities can give a creature immunity\
  \ (or at least resistance) to the troop's attacks. Some troops also have other special\
  \ attacks in addition to normal damage. Troops threaten all creatures within their\
  \ reach or within their area, and attempt attacks of opportunity as normal with\
  \ their troop attack.</p> \n    <p>Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting\
  \ or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires\
  \ a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience\
  \ and concentration requires a successful DC 20 Will save.</p> \n    <h2>Russian\
  \ Rifle Troop</h2> \n    <p>The following stat block represents an average troop\
  \ of Russian soldiers encountered in <i>Rasputin Must Die!</i> A Russian rifle troop's\
  \ troop attack is a combination of small arms fire, bayonets, trench shovels, and\
  \ other close-combat attacks. In addition, <i>Rasputin Must Die!</i> presents some\
  \ variant troops equipped with additional weapons and special attacks, such as chemical\
  \ warfare troops, flamethrower troops, machine gun troops, and mortar troops.</p>\

  \ \n     <p><b>Fusillade (Ex)</b> Rifle troops can fire a fusillade of rifle bullets\
  \ as a standard action. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range\
  \ of 200 feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's\
  \ space. All creatures in one of these lines' areas of effect take 6d10+6 points\
  \ of bludgeoning and piercing damage (Reflex DC 23 for half). The save DC is Dexterity-based,\
  \ and includes the bonus from the troop's Ability Focus feat.</p> \n     <p><b>Gas\
  \ Masks (Ex)</b> The soldiers of a rifle troop are all equipped with gas masks.\
  \ This makes the troop immune to inhaled poisons and other nonmagical airborne attacks\
  \ that require breathing, and grants it a +2 bonus on saving throws against magical\
  \ cloud or gas attacks.</p> \n     <p><b>Grenade Volley (Ex)</b> Rifle troops are\
  \ equipped with grenades. As a move action, a rifle troop can target a single square\
  \ up to 60 feet away with a volley of fragmentation grenades. A volley deals 12d6\
  \ points of piercing and slashing damage in a 30-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 21\
  \ for half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Rob\
