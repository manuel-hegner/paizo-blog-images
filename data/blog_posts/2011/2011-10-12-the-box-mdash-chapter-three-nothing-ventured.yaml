  \ <h1>The Box</h1>\n            <p>by Bill Ward</p>\n            <h2>Chapter Three:\
  \ Nothing Ventured</h2>\n            <p>The girls were, by any objective standards,\
  \ far too beautiful for the Point. But in the dim glow of the dockyard lights they\
  \ did the trick. Silently the trio gestured, gyrating hips that would make the women\
  \ of the Keleshite Emperor's harem seem bony lads in comparison, their impossible\
  \ skin as smooth and silver as the moon above. Their black tresses—tinged with a\
  \ seaweed green—hung in long clinging strands that managed to suggest more than\
  \ they concealed. They were, when it came down to it, completely irresistible.</p>\n\
  \            <p>If you were born yesterday, Kostin thought with a smirk.</p>\n \
  \           <p>The pair of Shoanti thugs guarding the old rum joint moved toward\
  \ the gorgeous trinity like fish pursuing a hooked worm. When they passed through\
  \ the darkest and narrowest part of the alleyway, Kostin struck.</p>\n         \
  \   <p>He slipped in behind the leftmost guard and smashed across the base of his\
  \ skull with a lead-filled sap. The man dropped.</p>\n            <p>Opposite him\
  \ in the dark a giant figure loomed up, felling the second Shoanti with a single\
  \ blow from a sledgehammer fist.</p>\n            <p>\"Nice hit, Gyrd,\" Kostin\
  \ said, gritting his teeth as his voice came out too loud.</p>\n            <p>At\
  \ the end of the alley, the three nymphs gave a silent cheer, flinging their arms\
  \ up and bouncing on their heels like schoolchildren.</p>\n            <p>Kostin\
  \ swiftly bound the arms of the unconscious Shoanti with rawhide tethers and gagged\
  \ them with wads of cloth. Gyrd stepped in when he was finished, reeking of sour\
  \ sweat and stale mead, and threw a guard over each broad shoulder. The Ulfen's\
  \ chainmail jangled under the load. Kostin pointed further down the alley and the\
  \ big northerner stomped off with his cargo to dump them where they would not be\
  \ found until morning.</p> \"Enough with the girls,\" Kostin said through clenched\
  \ teeth, noting that the illusory threesome was now engaged in activity fit to make\
  \ a Calistrian blush. With a final, sensuous wave they winked out of existence—\
  and a child-sized figure vaulted onto a nearby stack of discarded casks and gave\
  \ a bow. \n            <p></p>\n            <p>\"Not too bad, yeah?\" Her voice\
  \ was the very model of gnomish enthusiasm. \"I actually <em>met</em> a sea-nymph\
  \ once, you know. And so I took her likeness and this tavern girl that Gyrd used\
  \ to know—well, <em>everyone</em> used to know, apparently—and—\"</p>\n        \
  \    <p>\"Yes, Shess. But we need to keep quiet—\" Kostin was interrupted by the\
  \ sudden flaring of a light behind him.</p>\n            <p>Whirling around and\
  \ drawing his sword in the same motion, he saw Aeventius and Taldara walking up\
  \ from the opposite end of the alley. A glow like daylight emerged from the wizard's\
  \ left hand, from the onyx and platinum ring that bore his family seal and was an\
  \ integral part of his magic.</p>\n            <p>Aeventius held up his other hand\
  \ before the livid Kostin could speak. \"There are no watchers outside, no windows—\
  the light is safe. But just to keep you from making faces...\" The wizard—dressed\
  \ more appropriately for a night at the opera than a raid into a dockside gang's\
  \ stronghold—cupped his hand over the ring and brought the daytime radiance back\
  \ down to something approaching a dim lantern.</p>\n            <p>\"What's she\
  \ doing here?\" Kostin stage whispered, gesturing at Taldara.</p>\n            <p>The\
  \ half-elf stepped between Aeventius and Kostin before the wizard could answer.\
  \ \"Why is that the first thing everyone says when I show up? You got me into this,\
  \ Kostin—\"</p>\n            <p>\"Not this!\"</p>\n            <p>\"Yes, this. The\
  \ box, the Shoanti—staying up all night and watching them try to save your father's\
  \ house. Don't think it's all about you—he was a father to me long before I ever\
  \ met mine. Besides,\" Taldara smirked, raising the crossbow she held at the ready,\
  \ \"this is better than sketching the Irespan all day.\" Her badger, wobbling where\
  \ it clung to her right shoulder, chattered agreement.</p>\n            <p>\"She\
  \ followed me,\" Aeventius added.</p>\n            <p>\"You aren't hard to track—\
  and a city isn't so much different than the wilderness, especially the city where\
  \ I grew up.\"</p>\n            <p>Just then Gyrd reappeared like some vast berg\
  \ of steel and flesh.</p>\n            <p>Aeventius let out an audible sigh. \"\
  Of course, where the imp goes, the ogre follows. You smell like an alehouse latrine.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"That's where we found him!\" Shess piped up, bouncing to\
  \ Aeventius's side. The wizard flinched away.</p>\n            <p>Gyrd, bearded\
  \ face impassive behind a tangle of red and gray hair, took a long pull from a leather\
  \ drinking skin. The raw, almost chemical odor of potent spirits rolled out from\
  \ him like an aura.</p>\n            <p>\"None of this!\" Kostin said, snatching\
  \ the bag from Gyrd before the giant could react. \"You can have it back when we're\
  \ done.\"</p>\n            <p>\"What did you think of my casting, Aevy?\" Shess\
  \ gazed up at the wizard through a shock of emerald green hair.</p>\n          \
  \  <p>Kostin interrupted, clearing his throat. \"Enough talking. Come.\" He moved\
  \ back down the alley toward the old rum house.</p>\n            <p>\"Too beautiful,\"\
  \ Aeventius said to the gnome as he turned to follow Kostin. \"And do not ever call\
  \ me that.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Of course!\" Shess said, skipping in stride with\
  \ the wizard. \"I always knew you liked your women short and green!\"</p>\n    \
  \        <div class=\"blurb360\">\n             <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_taldara.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n             <br>\n              \"It seems Taldara picked up a number\
  \ of new skills in her years away from home.\"\n            </div>\n           \
  \ <p>Taldara moved to Kostin’s side. \"Aren't you going to introduce me to your,\
  \ um, 'gang?'\"</p>\n            <p>\"Certainly. Forgive my manners,\" Irritation\
  \ creeping into his voice, Kostin turned back around. The group halted.</p>\n  \
  \          <p>\"This here is Shess, the best little sneak thief in Magnimar.\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>The gnome, beaming, gave a mock curtsey. She was dressed in a patchwork\
  \ of styles and colors, resembling something like a collision between a Chelish\
  \ noble, a Tian merchant, a Sczarni blade, and an Ulfen minstrel.</p>\n        \
  \    <p>\"And Gyrd here is, um...\"</p>\n            <p>\"Blacksmith,\" the giant\
  \ answered, no expression on his ruddy, heavily scarred face. His chainmail hauberk\
  \ gleamed dully in the light, and he held a battle-dinted round shield in his left\
  \ hand. Gyrd looked as if he had just stepped out from a shieldwall—and was aching\
  \ to get back.</p>\n            <p>\"Really?\" Kostin asked, surprised. \"Well,\
  \ ah, everyone, this is my oldest friend, Taldara, who is some sort of big deal\
  \ Pathfinder now.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Ooh,\" said Shess, eyes round with interest\
  \ as she studied Taldara. \"But I thought Aevy was your oldest friend.\"</p>\n \
  \           <p>\"I thought I was his only friend,\" Aeventius said blandly.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Taldara smiled and opened her mouth to reply, but Kostin grabbed\
  \ her arm and tugged her along behind him. \"Plenty of time for all of this later!\"\
  \ he said over his shoulder. The rest followed.</p>\n            <p>Aeventius was\
  \ correct in that there were no signs of observation from the rum house. It was\
  \ as Kapteo Giuleppeschi had said—the place was boarded up and abandoned. The Sczarni\
  \ boss had come through for him that afternoon, granting him not only his silver,\
  \ but valuable information about the Shoanti hideout. Kostin had modified his original\
  \ plan to storm their front door in favor of this one—to come in undetected through\
  \ the secret back entrance the Shoanti used to slip in and out along the shore side\
  \ of the Point. Further west of here was the Wyrmwatch lighthouse, marking the spot\
  \ where the great Indros had battled the sea dragon. South and east, and you had\
  \ a tumble of smugglers' wharfs along the mouth of the Yondabakari leading down\
  \ into the slums of Rag's End. It was a good location for a pack of robbers and\
  \ thugs.</p>\n            <p>\"Door is clear,\" Aeventius said behind him, and Kostin\
  \ turned to see the wizard's eyes glowing with an eldritch blue light.</p>\n   \
  \         <p>The guards had not had any keys on them. \"Alright. Shess, you're better\
  \ at this than me. Get us in there.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Yes, sir!\" Shess, saluting\
  \ Kostin ridiculously, leaped onto Gyrd's back. Drawing her sword, the gnome leveled\
  \ it at the door like a cavalry officer ordering a charge. \"Smash it, Gyrd!\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>Before Kostin could react the Northman—Shess still clinging to his\
  \ back—raised his shield and launched himself shoulder-first at the door. It crashed\
  \ inward with a splintering boom.</p>\n            <p>\"'Best little sneak thief\
  \ in Magnimar,'\" said Taldara, covering the door with her crossbow. Aeventius snorted\
  \ in amused agreement.</p>\n            <p>Kostin, sword drawn and teeth clenched\
  \ in annoyed disbelief, entered after the mad gnome and the half-drunk warrior.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Inside it was dark and empty. A few sprung and moldering casks rested\
  \ against the walls, and the odd sliver of wood or twist of ship's rope littered\
  \ the ground. On the far wall a doorless portal yawned blackly.</p>\n          \
  \  <p>\"So far it's as the kapteo claimed,\" Kostin said. \"The old cellar of this\
  \ place abuts the sunken warehouse. From there we’re right at the shaman's quarters.\
  \ Most of the Shoanti should be on the other side, in the warehouse proper. We nip\
  \ in, take down Azahg, get the box, set some fires, and get the hell out again.\
  \ Questions?\"</p>\n            <p>Shess raised her hand and Kostin pushed it back\
  \ down. The others shook their heads.</p>\n            <p>\"Alright, then. Let's\
  \ go.\"</p>\n            <p>The way ahead was easy to see—years of wear had left\
  \ a path of dirt and scraped stone for them to follow. The blocks of the cellar\
  \ wall had been pried out to form a crude doorway into the domain of the warehouse—\
  a shoddily built structure that had sunk and partially collapsed at its south end\
  \ and had long been abandoned by any legitimate concerns. Scrabbling through the\
  \ wall and into the building, they followed a sloping and precarious floor upward.\
  \ Kostin wiped sweat from his eyes; the air in the warehouse was close and redolent\
  \ with the stench of mold and decay.</p>\n            <p>A flickering light ahead\
  \ caused Aeventius to clamp a hand tightly over his radiant ring.</p>\n        \
  \    <p>There were two of them, talking animatedly in the guttural cadences of the\
  \ Shoanti. Gyrd tensed as if to spring forward, but Taldara clapped a hand on his\
  \ shoulder and bade him be still. With her other hand she held a finger to her lips,\
  \ urging them all to stay quiet.</p>\n            <p>After a brief exchange, both\
  \ Shoanti moved off down the corridor.</p>\n            <p>Taldara turned to the\
  \ group. \"They say Azahg and his wives have been a night and a day in his sanctum,\
  \ and they worry. They wish to know what powerful treasure he has discovered in\
  \ the box, but also do not know if they should counter his orders and try to enter\
  \ his rooms.\" Taldara shrugged. \"At least that's the most I could get out of it.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"You speak Shoanti,\" Kostin said, impressed.</p>\n      \
  \      <p>\"They aren't all bad, you know. I think they may have had to come to\
  \ the city to turn into this.\" Taldara scratched her badger behind the ear. Lifting\
  \ it gently from her shoulder, she nuzzled it before placing it on the ground.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Mordimor will scout they way for us,\" she continued as the badger\
  \ zipped off down the corridor. Taldara closed her eyes and drew a shape in the\
  \ air.</p>\n            <p>\"Tal, are you—\" Kostin stopped at a sudden smack on\
  \ the arm from Aeventius, who gestured for silence.</p>\n            <p>The badger\
  \ returned as swiftly as he had left, and Taldara muttered a few words in a language\
  \ Kostin had never heard, one different from the ancient tongue of magic he had\
  \ listened to Aeventius utter on so many occasions.</p>\n            <p>Mordimor\
  \ leaped into Taldara's arms, and the two commenced to have the strangest conversation\
  \ Kostin had ever witnessed.</p>\n            <p>\"He says it's clear, but he gets\
  \ a bad feeling about the shaman's door. Or, maybe, what's on the other side of\
  \ it.\" Taldara plopped the badger back up on her shoulder. It still muttered at\
  \ her ear and Taldara cocked a playful smile. \"He also says the wizard should go\
  \ first.\"</p>\n            <p>\"A woodland wit,\" Aeventius said, scowling.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Kostin led the way, stalking ahead with barely a sound. Shess followed,\
  \ moving silently with little effort. Taldara and Aeventius came next, creeping\
  \ forward with careful steps. Gyrd shuffled in the rear, heavy one-handed sword\
  \ drawn, armor tinkling despite his apparent caution.</p>\n            <p>They paused\
  \ at the door for a time while Aeventius and Shess examined it—the wizard scanning\
  \ for magical emanations and the thief checking for traps.</p>\n            <p>Shess,\
  \ now wearing a ridiculous pair of spectacles devoid of their lenses, gave a thumbs-up,\
  \ while Aeventius murmured something incomprehensible under his breath. Finally,\
  \ he turned to Kostin. \"I can open it, whenever we’re ready.\"</p>\n          \
  \  <p>Kostin surveyed his team. Gyrd, wicked smile on his face and skin flushed\
  \ with battle lust and booze, had positioned himself at the door, ready to storm\
  \ in. Taldara was beside him, eyebrows knit in concentration, crossbow leveled to\
  \ cover Gyrd's flank. Shess bounced on her heels, eager as a child at the fair,\
  \ her blade gleaming silver and naked in her tiny fist. Aeventius waited patiently,\
  \ back straight as any aristocrat, a slender black wand in his hand.</p>\n     \
  \       <p>Kostin moved into position next to Gyrd, and took a deep breath in an\
  \ attempt to strike a mental deal with his heart to stop thundering in his chest.\
  \ He loosened his grip on his sword and bent his knees slightly. A cold serpent\
  \ of sweat trickled down his spine.</p>\n            <p>\"Do it,\" he said, left\
  \ hand poised above the door's handle.</p>\n            <p>A word from Aeventius\
  \ and the door lock opened with an audible clack.</p>\n            <p>Kostin flung\
  \ open the door to the shaman's sanctum—and a horde of creatures burst forth.</p>\n\
