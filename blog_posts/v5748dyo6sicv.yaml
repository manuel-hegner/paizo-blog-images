  \ partners like Roll for Combat, who—in addition to streaming high quality Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder actual-play podcasts and running the RPG Superstar design talent\
  \ competition—publish their own line of Pathfinder Second Edition rulebooks and\

  \     </div> \n     <p>The adventure begins with the heroes on the hunt for the\
  \ other half of an ancient pirate treasure map that belonged to the city’s legendary\
  \ founder, and it leads through numerous twists and evolves into an action-packed\
  \ finale with bigger battles and higher stakes than ever before, with the entire\
  \ Indigo Isles at stake! Our publisher likes to describe it as <em>Guardians of\
  \ the Galaxy</em> meets Indiana Jones in a fantasy pirate setting.</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ are a lot of amazing adventures available for Pathfinder Second Edition, but we\
  \ feel that <em>Jewel of the Indigo Isles </em>stands out not only because of the\
  \ amount of art but also because of the attention to detail and interconnectivity\
  \ throughout the adventure brought to you by industry veteran adventure authors\
  \ and current or former Paizo developers Patrick Renie, Ron Lundeen, and Linda Zayas-Palmer,\
  \ who have collectively developed hundreds of Paizo adventures and written over\
  \ a dozen Paizo adventure path volumes. Throughout the adventure, <em>Jewel of the\
  \ Indigo Isles</em> takes into account multiple approaches and outcomes, including\
  \ the possibility of failing if the heroes are vanquished at different points along\
  \ the way. Six unique backgrounds allow the heroes to tie themselves directly into\
  \ the story, with special payoffs that occur along the way for each background so\
  \ that as the ongoing adventure’s overall story unfolds, so does each hero’s personal\
  \ story.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://battlezoo.com/products/jewel-of-the-indigo-isles-for-foundry-vtt?variant=40493989363812\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>None of the opponents is a standard beast found in mainstream\
  \ bestiaries. Found either in the adventure itself or the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>,\
  \ every encounter in J<em>ewel of the Indigo Isles</em> is a new surprise that requires\
  \ the heroes to learn as they go along, with multi-stage battles, large-scale assaults,\
  \ dynamic chases, environmental effects, and more! The Foundry module has absolutely\
  \ everything you need for all those monsters, from statistics down to art assets\
  \ (and quite a few of the creatures have a unique art asset for the adventure rather\
  \ than reusing the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary </em>art); there’s no need to purchase\
  \ the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary </em>module in order to run it.</p> \n     <p>The adventure\
  \ supports the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em> monster parts system, allowing the heroes\
  \ to effortlessly craft new magic items out of the parts of monsters they overcome\
  \ while also providing all the information necessary to run a game using only the\
  \ standard rules. You decide!</p> \n     <p>The titular setting for <em>Jewel of\
  \ the Indigo Isles</em> is a small island chain that can be inserted into just about\
  \ any fantasy setting, including Golarion, with ease, though it has hints of its\
  \ own new setting as well. Rather than being filled with familiar ancestries like\
  \ humans, elves, and dwarves, the Indigo Isles are home to brand-new, never-before-seen\
  \ ancestries. Parrot-like g’mayun, who are the most common in the adventure’s starting\
  \ city, recovered from the brink of being converted into demons long ago, while\
  \ porcine orpok, whom the heroes visit later on, work hard, play hard, and have\
  \ a vibrant food culture. All in all, there are seven new ancestries and heritages\
  \ that make up the majority of the inhabitants of the isles, and thus of the cast\
  \ of characters the heroes will encounter... and that’s not taking into account\
  \ the brand new wild dragons who live side by side with other ancestries!</p> \n\

  \ major settlements in the isles. The first is Rumplank, a raucous, festive, rough-and-tumble\
  \ city that has come to be the largest and most influential in the Indigo Isles\
  \ and is where the story begins. The second is Seaview, a city populated mostly\
  \ by orpok with a thriving food scene, which plays an important role in the second\
