              <h2>Chapter Four: Revenge Is a Dish...</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> <span itemprop="description"><p>Marcov spotted the modest hut to which the priest had directed him, spent a moment invoking the haunting spirits, and broke into a sprint. He leaped, hurling his whole weight against the shuttered window nearest the front door. Wood burst inward, splinters flying—all in utter silence, for the ghosts of that long-dead village had spread their intangible substances through the surrounding air, muting all sound.</p></span> 
               <p>A trio of animated skeletons—Marcov guessed they'd been chosen over fleshier undead so as to cut down on the stench—lurched and staggered from across the room. Bone fingers wrapped around cheap swords, or curled into tearing claws. The clacking and clicking probably would have been disturbing, if he could hear any of it.</p> 
               <p>Marcov spun, sweeping the legs from under the nearest corpse. Bastard sword held high, he parried a stroke from the second, then brought the heavy pommel of the weapon down in a diagonal arc. The skeleton's collarbone shattered, causing the undead to stagger and nearly topple.</p> 
               <p>With a quick yank on the thing's opposite shoulder, Marcov removed "nearly" from the equation. The animated bones fell atop the first skeleton, pinning it down just as it tried to rise. Marcov reversed his grip and plunged the blade through both rib cages and deep into the wooden floor. Neither skeleton would be getting up anytime soon.</p> 
               <p>The third and final guardian was just clever enough to lunge, taking advantage of the intruder's newly disarmed state. It seemed a good idea, right up until Marcov pounded the thing into a heap of splintered bone with a small end table that had been standing in a corner.</p> 
               <p>A few additional swings took care of the two pinned to the floor. Marcov retrieved his sword and continued, still wrapped in silence.</p> 
               <p>Doubtless the skeletons had been intended to scare away any potential intruders, and delay an attacker long enough for Khydol to prepare. Except Khydol hadn't heard a peep.</p> 
               <p>The cleric stood in the next room beside a makeshift shrine to Calistria, surrounded by rickety shelves of mementos—crockery, books, children's toys, candlesticks—presumably lost by those displaced during the General's purge of clerics from Touvette. The tome he'd been perusing fell open to the floor, its pages crumpling, as Marcov appeared in the doorway.</p> 
               <p>The half-elf's eyes widened at the sight of the unnaturally stealthy intruder. He raised holy symbol wrought of pewter and began to intone a prayer to his goddess.</p> 
               <p><i>Sorry</i>, Marcov mouthed around a vicious grin, then raised his blade and advanced at a saunter.</p> 
               <p>He was halfway through cleaning his blade when the silence lapsed and the room abruptly filled with the whisper of cloth on steel. A moment later, he heard the faint crunching of someone climbing in through the broken shutters.</p> 
               <p>"Marcov?"</p> 
               <p>"Next room!" he called back. "You're a little late, Loursa."</p> 
               <p>"Khydol's dead?" Her footsteps, drawing nearer the open doorway, weren't quite loud enough to mask the peculiar tone of her question.</p> 
               <p>"Dead as Aroden. Figured I'd ask him a couple of—"</p> 
               <p>It was pure luck that saved him. Had Loursa arrived before the ghosts had dismissed the unnatural hush, or had his struggle with the skeletons not scattered so many chips of wood and bone, she'd have been on him with no warning at all.</p> 
               <p>As it was, Marcov heard the sudden rush across the debris and was able to hurl himself aside. The blow that would otherwise have punched through his hauberk and into his back instead left only a fiery trail of blood and pain across his ribs.</p> 
               <p>"What the <i>hell</i>? Loursa—"</p> 
               <p>The guard kept coming, her blade thrusting as fiercely as it had against the bandits. Marcov, wincing at every blow, found himself barely able to parry despite his heavier sword.</p> 
               <p>For a moment there was only steel on steel and shuffling feet. Marcov retreated as far as Khydol's body, then leaped over it, putting a bit of distance between him and his traitorous opponent.</p> 
               <p>"So what is it, then?" he growled. "Just waiting until you didn't need me anymore to get rid of me?"</p> 
               <p>"Something like that," she told him softly.</p> 
               <p>He mumbled briefly under his breath. Then, "Lovely show of gratitude, Loursa."</p> 
               <p>Again she came at him, teeth bared in a feral snarl.</p> 
               <p>Marcov clenched his left fist. Wisps of shadow, phantom limbs invisible to mortal senses, swirled.</p> 
               <p>Khydol's body floated up into Loursa's path just as she made to step over it.</p> 
               <p>Marcov lunged, burning with betrayed fury. Flesh and bone parted, and his former companion deflated with a soft sigh before sliding from the tip of his blade. For an instant, Khydol's floating body held Loursa upright, then both corpses thumped awkwardly to the floor.</p> 
               <p>He'd actually grown comfortable, letting someone fight at his side again. <i>Should've known better. Stupid, stupid...</i></p> 
               <p>Again he cleaned his sword, then leaned it aside and knelt over the bodies. He began to call upon the surrounding spirits, prepared to ask them to revive Khydol's memories long enough to get some answers...</p> 
               <p>And paused. His gaze flickered to Loursa's slackened face, a bitter spring of pain bubbling unexpectedly to the surface of his anger.</p> 
               <p>When his hand came down, he felt the ghosts moving, but it wasn't into the body of the priest he directed them.</p> 
               <p>Loursa's jaw twitched. Her unfocused eyes turned toward him.</p> 
               <p>"Why did you try to kill me?" He cursed himself for the plaintive tone he couldn't quite banish.</p> 
               <p>"Ellithir... tells me... you want to harm her, as... you have so many others. I... have to... kill you first."</p> 
               <p>"Who's Ellithir?"</p> 
               <p>"My dearest... friend."</p> 
               <p>A horrible suspicion began to crawl on millipede legs up Marcov's spine. "How long have you known her?"</p> 
               <p>"Few hours."</p> 
               <p>"Then why are you such dear friends?"</p> 
               <p>"Words. She speaks... strange, pretty words."</p> 
               <p>The brutal simplicity of the dead. Marcov rose, staggered backward until he thumped against the nearest shelves. Several dishes and other trophies fell, shattering around his feet. He didn't notice.</p> 
               <p>Loursa hadn't liked him; he'd known that from the beginning, and hadn't cared. But she'd fought beside him. She <i>hadn't</i> betrayed him, not intentionally. Marcov knew magic when he heard it.</p> 
               <p>And he'd killed her for it.</p> 
               <p>Marcov rubbed at his forehead and looked back at the corpse, but it was once again an empty, lifeless husk.</p> 
               <p>"I'm sorry." His voice was oddly hoarse, the words dusty from years of disuse.</p> 
               <p>Marcov slung his blade over his shoulder and stalked out into the street, his rage growing hot once more. Someone in this town knew who Ellithir was, and Marcov felt more than ready to make whoever it was tell him.</p> 
               <p>∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>A few customers wandered the aisles of the general store when Marcov arrived. For several minutes, as he pulled goods aside and hunted for hidden secrets, the patrons stared at him in confusion. When one of them confronted him, asking what he thought he was doing, the gaunt foreigner was only too happy to let his ghosts toss a few objects around the room until he'd sent everyone into panicked flight.</p> 
               <p>It took some doing, and nearly ten more minutes; that damn mosquito-repelling herbal smoke, which seemed to be everywhere he went in the River Kingdoms lately, had given him a right headache by the time he was through.</p> 
               <p>Finally, however, with the spirits subtly guiding him when he got too far off track, he located the hidden trapdoor behind the counter.</p> 
               <p>He was forced to duck, walking at almost a crouch down the upper portion of the stairs, until he was deep enough below the ceiling to stand straight.</p> 
               <p>The chamber was earth and soil, barely supported by sagging beams of wood. A stone-rimmed pool sat within, a granite pillar protruding from its center. Both the stink of acrid incense and a faint glow that was the cellar's only illumination spilled from a pair of braziers. Marcov saw no one else here, heard no one, but a lifetime's instincts screamed of lurking danger. Again, he began whispering to the ghosts, asking them to guide his strikes, to warn him of attack, to—</p> 
               <p>The shadows at the chamber's far end shifted and lightened, revealing a slender silhouette. A voice hissed something only vaguely like words, and Marcov's sword began to glow. He heard skin sizzle even before he felt the searing pain, and threw the weapon aside with a startled shout. It scraped the edge of the pool, settling point-first in the water. Steam hissed upward to join the clouds of incense.</p> 
               <p>Marcov ran, and not an instant too soon. A thunderous crash shook the chamber, centered where he'd been standing. Dirt fell from the ceiling and water sloshed over the edges of the font. The burst of noise hit him like a physical blow, staggering him, making his ears ring; he could only imagine how much worse it might have been had he suffered the brunt.</p> 
               <p>Another three paces and Marcov jumped for the low ceiling. A brilliant beam of light flashed beneath him, so close he could feel the heat of its passing. Had gravity taken its normal course, his leap would not have stopped him from plummeting into the path of the ray.</p> 
               <p>He felt a phantom current wrap around his fingers and feet, holding him to the ceiling. Hanging upside down above the pool like a humanoid spider, he began scurrying sideways.</p> 
               <p>The darkened figure emerged somewhat from the gloom, revealing a golden-haired elf whose features might have been deemed soft, had they not been twisted in a rictus of anger and hate.</p> 
               <p>"Ellithir, I presume?"</p> 
               <p>She grunted an affirmation. "And you would be Draeven. You're a damned nuisance, you know that?"</p> 
               <p>"So I've been told. What's this all about?"</p> 
               <p>Ellithir didn't answer, but the flicker of her eyes toward the granite pillar was all the confirmation Marcov needed. He knew a shrine when he saw one, even if he didn't recognize the deity.</p>

               <p>He was stalling, and he knew that <i>she</i> knew he was stalling, but still she answered. "Khydol was useful, as was his faith." She shrugged. "His grudge was genuine. I just... encouraged him to expand his horizons."</p> 
               <p>"To what end? All this bloodshed and suffering... For what?"</p> 
               <p>"Bloodshed and suffering is the end, Draeven! We—"</p> 
               <p>Ellithir flung out her hand in the midst of speaking, clearly hoping to catch him unprepared.</p> 
               <p>Marcov hurled himself forward and leaped from the ceiling, wondering what fell invocation he'd avoided. Even as he landed, his sword flew from the pool into his waiting grasp, cool to the touch once more. He swung.</p> 
               <p>The sword crashed into a glimmering aura that sprang into life around the elf, the blade stopping inches from her skin.</p> 
               <p>Again, Ellithir screeched something that was only vaguely a language. This time Marcov recognized a word—or perhaps a name?—repeated from her first incantation: <i>Gyronna</i>.</p> 
               <p>The elf's right eye bulged, suddenly bloodshot and grossly swollen, as if pushed partly from her skull by the rage and magic within her. She slapped a hand against his armored chest.</p> 
               <p>Agony drove him to his knees. Worse than any wound, any illness he'd endured, it felt as though something ate away at him from within.</p> 
               <p>Then something wriggled, a wet and flaccid tickle that brushed the <i>inside</i> of his ribs and burrowed toward his gut, and he realized that was precisely what was happening. It was all he could do not to retch, then to scream his horror until his mind was gone.</p> 
               <p>"Idiot!" Ellithir kicked him in the face, sending him sprawling. "We are a plague! We are as the worms consuming your flesh! You haven't stopped me. Even if you'd killed me, you could never—"</p> 
               <p>The murdered souls that haunted Marcov could do nothing against the unnatural parasites that riddled him. But as they'd guided his limbs before, granting him strength, so did the spirits enable him to act now—more slowly and feebly than he would have preferred, but far more effectively than Ellithir could have anticipated. He stumbled upward.</p> 
               <p>Again, the glimmering aura prevented a killing stroke.</p> 
               <p>"Remember how you fought," Marcov whispered, coughing, to the spirits surrounding him. "Remember the men who swept over you, over your families, your children. Remember how you fought..."</p> 
               <p>Wisps of nothingness swirled, blended, assumed substance and form—until a plain longsword, chipped and battered and vaguely transparent, hung behind the elven cleric.</p> 
               <p>Ellithir gasped as the blade plunged between her shoulders, unhindered by her aura. She staggered forward, this time into Marcov's waiting grip.</p> 
               <p>A simple touch was all it took. Flesh split, blood flowed, muscles burst beneath the ghosts' fury.</p> 
               <p>Ellithir fell, first to her knees, then to one side. Ever thirsty, the earthen floor drank the growing pool of blood around her.</p> 
               <p>Marcov, too, collapsed once more, panting, shuddering in pain. "A drink and a whore if I live through this," he mumbled, though whether to himself or the spirits was unclear. "Not necessarily in that order."</p> 
               <p>"Cel—celebrating?" Ellithir's words emerged as a burbling, blood-soaked cough. "Don't. We—we are everywhere. The River Kingdoms belong to us! The flesh is filth. The world is pain. To see is to hate. And the Hag... the Hag sees..."</p> 
               <p>A final rattle, a pinkish froth, and Ellithir was gone.</p> 
               <p>Moments later, the agony of the worms began to fade, and Marcov nearly wept in relief. He felt as though he'd just swum the Inner Sea while suckling a mewling vampire, but the worst of the pain was gone.</p> 
               <p>Then, with the image of Loursa's dead face floating before his mind's eye, he realized he was wrong. It was only the physical pain that had ebbed.</p> 
               <p>Groaning, he dragged himself upright, leaning on his sword like an old man's cane. His gaze flickered first to the strange stone shrine, then to the dead priestess at his feet.</p> 
               <p>He thought of Ellithir's dying words—of cults like this spread throughout the River Kingdoms—and the spirits stirred within him.</p> 
               <p>Just this once, maybe he wouldn't mind the job that lay ahead.</p>

               <p>In addition to answering these sorts of questions and more, this Player Companion hosts a <i>bunch</i> of super-cool new ways to practice worship and religion while also allowing characters to try out entirely new ways of finding spiritual enlightenment. In no particular order (just kidding, it's alphabetical), here's a list of the features in this book I'm most excited about:</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li><b>Codes of Honor</b>: Ever wonder how you could get in good with the Knights of Ozem? How about the Red Mantis Assassins? Wonder no more! The new codes of honor in this book tie in perfectly with the rules for honor in <a href="/products/btpy8x64"><i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</i></a>, and provide guidelines for gaining prestige within many of Golarion's most fabled organizations.</li> 
                <li><b>Meditation Feats</b>: Now your monk has a reason to sit and ponder while the wizard prepares her spells and the cleric prays to his deity! By meditating every day, any character with a couple of these feats can unlock powerful new abilities that allow you to channel your insight into perilous situations, shield your body from deadly blows, and even slow down time as you perceive it!</li> 
                <li><b>Pantheons</b>: This book delves into the unique sets of deities worshiped by groups such as the Hellknights' Order of the Godclaw and Taldor's zealous nationalists and even details some of Vudra's thousands of deities! The pantheons discussed in this book provide a slew of ideas for characters that worship more than one deity, and the new Pantheistic Blessing feat grants believers some impressive divine powers should they uphold the tenets of their diversified faith.</li> 
               </ul> 
               <p>I'd hate to spoil too much more, so I'll just leave you all with a single piece of the awesome art that appears in this book. Polish your holy symbols and get ready to cast some bones, because <i>Faiths &amp; Philosophies</i> ships soon!</p>

               <p>Already I can hear the hissed intake of breath from some worried readers. We've read, heard, and sometimes even personally made the argument that replay opens the door to myriad forms of abuse. I agree that unlimited replay of more than just Tier 1 scenarios and Tier 1-2 modules would be disruptive. I still remember meeting a Pathfinder Society player who proudly boasted that he and his group had just run through <i>The Godsmouth Heresy</i> six times in the course of a weekend simply to level-grind a host of characters to 2nd level. Campaign leadership has been very careful in exploring replay so that we might avoid classic pitfalls.</p> 
               <p>What tipped the balance for us was realizing that replay might also address an ongoing push to expand rewards for GMs who have dedicated their time to the campaign. In my estimation, most GMs who have at least one star have had to "eat" a scenario by preparing and GMing it before having the chance to play it. In my experience, those who habitually GM for organized play also have considerable practice when it comes to suppressing personal knowledge. In my time as a volunteer and employee, I find that those who GM first and play later are also among the most dedicated to wanting the whole group to have fun and enjoy experiencing a scenario without spoilers. That got the gears turning.</p> 
               <p>When Version 5.0 of the <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i> goes live, campaign participants who have been recognized for their efforts as a GM by receiving GM stars will be able to replay or "re-GM" a limited number of scenarios—specifically one scenario for each star earned. In this way a participant may earn a third Chronicle sheet from a given scenario: one for playing, one for GMing, and one for either playing or GMing that scenario a second time. No character may ever have two of the same Chronicle sheet, so one must apply each sheet to a different character each time. When earning a third Chronicle in this way, the GM should write "GM Star Replay Credit" on the Chronicle sheet.</p> 
               <p>Let's say you're a two-star GM—thank you for your help, by the way. You can now replay or re-GM (for credit, that is) two scenarios once each. Perhaps you thought <i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3–14159: Death by Pie</i> was amazing when you played it the first time, but you are sad to have missed the opportunity to play it with your pastry totem barbarian who took the mathematical prodigy trait. You replay it for credit using one of your replay credits, and now you have one replay left. If you later use that to replay <i>#5–513: The Doppelganger's Prey</i>, you are now out of replays until you earn that third star. Only then would you be able to replay <i>#4–117: All the Doors are Trapped</i> for credit.</p> 
               <p>At this time, the Guide does not say anything about gaining more replay credits each season. For now that's alright by me; let's see how this works for one season before making promises about what will happen a year from now. As many as five replays won't be enough to make a character completely unbalanced. Instead I envision this being for those who have played/GMed almost everything, managed tables for most of a convention, and saved the last slot to just play.</p> 
               <p>There may be other rewards tied to GM ties in the Guide, but we'll just have to wait to see those when the new document goes live next week.</p>

                <br>Amiri and Ezren are both replaying the scenario pictured above, and our iconic barbarian is trying to remind the wizard not to spoil what's about to happen next for the other players. Ezren is just aghast that all of the other characters put on the masks without first discovering the black lotus extract smeared on the interiors. What a great (nonexistent) scenario...

               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Seltyiel.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Seltyiel_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up first this week is our iconic magus, Seltiyel! This rakish eldritch warrior with the open shirt, curved sword, and come hither look first appeared representing a prestige class in the <a href="/products/btpy88yj">Core Rulebook</a>, but we liked him so much that we decided to bring him back when we did a fighter/wizard base class for real in <a href="/products/btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic</a>. This version is from that later source, and honestly I think he's one of the best iconic characters we've done yet in prepainted plastic. The details on this figure are just amazing. You'll find something new on it every time you look. And who doesn't need a cool long-haired dude like this in their minis collection? Seltiyel is a rare figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Hammerhead.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Hammerhead_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have one of the set's worst-kept secrets, since I mentioned it months ago and images of it leaked online last week when our partners at WizKids included the Hammerhead Shark in their awesome Pathfinder Battles San Diego Comic Con display. I recently opened a case of <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> figures and ended up with three of this Large, uncommon figure. With the three regular sharks that also came in the case, I have now pretty much sealed up my lifetime need for prepainted sharks, and I couldn't be happier with the figures. The normal guy is pretty great, but this larger shark is really impressive on the game table, and I know you'll be thrilled to have him.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Wasp.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Wasp_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Our final <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> reveal is a figure almost no one guessed, the Giant Wasp! From the cool clear wings to the shiny carapace, the Giant Wasp is a very impressive figure that towers over player characters, threatening a sting you just know you want to do whatever you can to avoid! At the uncommon rarity, you'll be able to amass a whole nest of this Large figure (or at least a small handful). Just watch out for that stinger!</p> 
               <p>That's it for this week's previews, and that's it for the entire <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set! As I mentioned above, I just cracked an entire case of this set, and was really impressed with the production on the figures. I definitely felt like each brick, and even each four-figure booster, was a good value for the money, and I'm really happy to add the whole set to my personal collection. In just a few short weeks you'll have the same experience opening your figures, and I'm more certain than ever that you're going to be thrilled with the way WizKids keeps raising the bar with each Pathfinder Battles release.</p> 
               <p>Next Friday we'll take a look at the final painted version of the <a href="/products/btpy8xrp">Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon</a> limited-edition case incentive figure, as well as a few group shots and other thoughts about the <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set. </p> 
               <p>And then we're off to the NEXT set, <a href="/products/btpy909j">Legends of Golarion</a>, and we start the whole crazy preview cycle all over again with a set that pushes the quality even further into the stratosphere.</p> 
               <p>See you then!</p>

Dance with Squealy Nord will be released in the November 2013 issue of <i>Game Trade</i> magazine. The remaining six will be sent to retailers, one every two months starting in August, matching our bimonthly release schedule for the Base Set and follow-up Adventure Decks. We'll also be inserting them into randomly selected <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo">paizo.com</a> orders during the month that they're available at retail.
               <p></p> 
               <p>But if you'd like to make sure you get your hands on <i>all</i> of them, subscribe to the Adventure Card Game! Each subscription shipment will include the cards associated with that month's release, so Fire Sneeze and the August promo card, Poog of Zarongel, will go out with the Base Set next month; the October promo card, Blessing of Zarongel, will go out with The Skinsaw Murders Adventure Deck in October, and so on. So make sure your raspiest singing voice is good and out of tune and get ready to make some noise with the goblins of the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i>, marching on your game store this August!</p>

                <h2>Demon Lord Traits</h2> 
                <p><b>Demon Lord Traits (Ex, Sp, or Su)</b>: A demon lord is a powerful, unique demon that rules a layer of the Abyss. All demon lords are chaotic evil outsiders that are, at a minimum, CR 26. Demon lords have a particular suite of traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry) as summarized here.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>A demon lord can grant spells to its worshipers as if it were a deity. A demon lord's domains are Chaos, Evil, and two other domains relevant to its theme and interests. Like a deity, a demon lord has a favored weapon.</li> 
                 <li>A demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</li> 
                 <li><i>Abyssal Resurrection (Ex)</i> A demon lord rules an Abyssal realm, a vast world that not only serves as its home but provides it with power. If a demon lord is slain, its body rapidly melts into corruption (leaving behind any gear it held or carried), its soul returns to a hidden location within its realm, and it is immediately restored to life (as <i>true resurrection</i>) at that location. Once this occurs, a demon lord can't use this ability again until a full year has passed. A demon lord realizes it is vulnerable during this time and usually doesn't risk further battles for the remainder of that year, relying on the defenses of its realm and its legions of minions to protect it. A demon lord that is slain again during this year or is killed by unusual methods (such as by a true deity or an artifact created for this purpose) is slain forever—its remains appearing somewhere deep in the Abyss among other dead demon lords from the ages. A demon lord who does not control a domain does not gain this ability.</li> 
                 <li><i>Frightful Presence (Su)</i> A demon lord can activate its frightful presence as a free action as part of any attack, spell-like ability, special attack, or by speaking aloud.</li> 
                 <li>Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, charm effects, compulsion effects, death effects, energy drain, and petrification.</li> 
                 <li><i>Regeneration (Ex)</i> Only epic and good damage, or damage from a creature of equal or greater power (such as an archdevil, deity, demon lord, or protean lord) interrupts a demon lord's regeneration.</li> 
                 <li>Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30.</li> 
                 <li><i>Summon Demons (Sp)</i> Three times per day as a swift action, a demon lord can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success, and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.</li> 
                 <li>Telepathy 300 feet.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <h2>Abyssal Realms</h2> 
                <p>Demon lords' realms range in size, but even the smallest are as large as a continent, and the greatest are larger than some planets. The realms' environments, themes, and traits are as unique as the demon lords themselves, presenting unusual challenges and dangers to creatures trying to explore them. Yet despite the close connection a demon lord has to its realm, it does not exert total control over the realm, and powerful adventurers can infiltrate such realms and accomplish goals without arousing the lord's anger—if they're careful.</p> 
                <p>A demon lord gains the following additional powers while in its realm (the statistics presented on the following pages do not include these abilities):</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Mythic</b>: A demon lord functions as a 10th mythic rank creature, including the mythic power ability (10/day, surge +1d12). It may expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic versions of any spell-like ability denoted with an asterisk (*) just as if the ability were a mythic spell.</li> 
                 <li>Use of the following spell-like abilities at will—<i>demand</i>, <i>discern location</i>, <i>fabricate</i>, <i>major creation</i>, and <i>polymorph any object</i> (when used on objects or creatures that are native to the realm, the polymorph duration factor increases by 6).</li> 
                 <li>Use of the following spell-like abilities once per day—<i>binding</i>, <i>miracle</i> (limited to physical effects that manipulate the realm or to effects that are relevant to the demon lord's areas of concern)</li> 
                 <li><b>Heightened Awareness (Ex)</b>: A demon lord gains a +10 insight bonus on Perception checks and Initiative checks.</li> 
                </ul>

              <h2>Chapter Three: An Array of Evils</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> <span itemprop="description"><p>Loursa moved to Draeven's side, limping, sword dragging point-first through the dirt. "I thought you said there'd only be a few of them!"</p></span> 
               <p>"I did," he said. "Didn't figure every last one of them would be up and armed at midnight, either."</p> 
               <p>Understanding pounded over Loursa thicker than the falling soil. "They knew we were coming."</p> 
               <p>"We did, at that." From the mass of ragged but uncomfortably well-armed brigands, two figures advanced. Loursa knew instinctively that the one in the lead was the "Zarred" Draeven had mentioned. Steel breastplate over leather, an axe that looked like it had actually seen professional care, scars on top of scars... A bandit chief if ever there was one.</p> 
               <p>The other, the speaker, was a scarlet-haired half-elf who wore his chainmail awkwardly. His sleeves shone gold in the brigands' torchlight, and his left hand fiddled absently with a silver pendant that dangled from his neck.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Zarred.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Zarred_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br>Zarred is a bandit chief if there ever was one.
               </div> 
               <p>"How?" Draeven demanded. </p> 
               <p>The half-elf shrugged. "Message from a friend."</p> 
               <p>"But—"</p> 
               <p>"You stupid, Khydol?" This from Zarred. "Son of a bitch is stalling, is all. Let's just get it done, yeah?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I'd have liked to know why this fellow's interfering, but I suppose it doesn't matter. Go ahead."</p> 
               <p>Zarred barked. Almost a dozen bandits raised crossbows. Loursa sucked in a deep breath, determined to at least die with dignity. Pity it had to be in this bastard's company.</p> 
               <p>And Draeven, after a moment of muttering to himself... laughed.</p> 
               <p>A chorus of low howls thickened the air around the condemned pair. Dirt kicked up and fallen twigs flew, yet not a single gust touched Loursa. Triggers clicked. A flock of bolts flew toward the pair and were just as swiftly hurled aside by the spectral forces. None even came close.</p> 
               <p>The bowmen recoiled, crying their dismay, but the half-elf—Khydol, Zarred had called him—advanced. Shouting, he raised the pendant around his neck. Loursa could just make out its three-pronged engraving, and while she knew little about magic of any sort, she recognized a spell when she saw it.</p> 
               <p>Whatever power Khydol hoped to invoke, however, was just as swiftly lost. Draeven raised his own hand in a peculiar hooking gesture. The tenor of the howling changed, ever so faintly, and the amulet tore itself from the chain around the half-elf's neck and hurtled through the phantom gale into the foreigner's waiting grip.</p> 
               <p>Khydol gawped, apparently having been stripped of language skills along with his pendant. Not so for Zarred. "Kill them!" thundered the bandit leader.</p> 
               <p>Loursa met the first of the attackers, blade clashing on blade. She allowed herself to be pushed back, retreating, watching as his strikes fell into a pattern common to the vicious but untrained. Strike, parry, step, strike, parry...</p> 
               <p>The guard from Kelbran delivered a short, swift kick, catching the bandit's ankle in midair with an audible crack. He'd barely begun to howl when her sword took him in the throat.</p> 
               <p>Loursa's withdrawal had taken her away from the man's companions, granting her an instant to catch her breath. She shot a quick glance behind to see how her own unpleasant companion was holding up...</p> 
               <p>She nearly choked. Draeven was staggering, reeling from blows that skittered across his hauberk or rang from his blade. The blood of several shallow cuts ran down his arms, dripped from between his fingers. He retreated before the enemy, worked to parry any weapon that came too close, but otherwise seemed lost in his own little world. The bulk of the gang was focused on him, Zarred included, and it was nothing more than simple geometry—only a few could reach him at any given time—that kept Draeven from being overwhelmed.</p> 
               <p>Another brigand, an ape of a man whose face was all beard and rotten teeth, demanded Loursa's undivided attention with his falling mace. His first blow numbed her arm from knuckles to elbow, nearly knocking the sword from her hand. A third attacker appeared from around the mace-wielder, jabbing with a spear. Loursa spun aside, dropped an arm over the shaft and twisted. The weapon flew from the bandit's grip, but by then the big guy was closing again, mace blotting out the sun...</p> 
               <p>An unearthly screech, high-pitched and keening, echoed over the village. Loursa was startled enough, but her foes seemed shocked into near paralysis; she disemboweled the nearer of the two bandits with a quick swipe before turning to see what had just occurred.</p> 
               <p>Draeven hung in the air a dozen feet above his opponents, slowly rotating in a phantom whirlwind Loursa could sense but not see or hear. His jaw gaped, distended almost to the point of breaking, yet the scream—only now beginning to fade—was not in his voice and seemed to come from around him as much as from within. Blood slid from his blade, painting an abstract pattern of spatters on the upturned faces of his foes.</p> 
               <p>Without warning, he dropped back into the bandits' midst, a blur of flashing steel and fists. As Loursa had witnessed back in Kelbran, ghostly arms seemed to guide Draeven's blade, driving it into organs. No matter the ferocity of the enemy that confronted him, he attacked with relentless resolve. Strokes that should have spilled his blood, even dismembered limbs, turned aside at the last moment, repelled by invisible forces. Brigands began to fall.</p> 
               <p>Screaming in rage—and perhaps a touch of fear—Zarred burst from between his men, axe hurtling in an arc that might have split a healthy bole in a single blow. Draeven crouched, spinning, so that the heavy blade passed clear overhead. Halfway through the turn he rose, sword outstretched.</p> 
               <p>The bandit chieftain was fast. Instead of being spitted, Zarred yanked himself from the sword's path.</p> 
               <p>It didn't help. Draeven thrust out his empty hand, slapping it against Zarred's chest.</p> 
               <p>Spirits groaned. Zarred screamed. And then he... withered. The flesh of his arms and face shrank against the bone, his eyes dulled in sudden pain; even his hair seemed to go limp.</p> 
               <p>It wasn't lethal, whatever the foreigner had done. But the next time Draeven's hand-and-a-half came around, it plunged clean through Zarred's chest with no hint of resistance.</p> 
               <p>The remaining bandits fled so quickly their own horses might have had trouble keeping up. Khydol was gone as well, apparently having run after he'd lost his pendant.</p> 
               <p>This time, Draeven didn't bother to pursue the survivors. Instead, after looking about to ensure no more bandits remained, he wandered over to the nearest house, shoved the door open, and vanished inside.</p> 
               <p>Loursa followed. She found Draeven slumped in an old chair beside a scarred and food-stained table. He gulped deep breaths of air—whether from physical exhaustion or because of something else, she could not tell.</p> 
               <p>"Why did you let them beat on you like that?" It wasn't the question she wanted to ask; she was working up to that one.</p> 
               <p>Draeven shrugged. "I can hear the ghosts' thoughts in my mind, but they don't read mine. I have to explain what I'm asking of them. Sometimes takes longer than might be convenient."</p> 
               <p>"Who the hell are <i>they</i>? Draeven, what <i>are</i> you?"</p> 
               <p align="center">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>Marcov hadn't planned on answering the questions. He never had before, and Loursa certainly wasn't the first to have asked. A curse was already squirming on his tongue.</p> 
               <p>It died unborn, smothered by a low moan deep in the recesses of his soul—a moan that only grew louder, more oppressive, the longer he kept silent.</p> 
               <p>"You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me!"</p> 
               <p>The moan became a shriek, nearly knocking him from the chair. The legs of the table began to vibrate.</p> 
               <p>"All right, <i>all right</i>!"</p> 
               <p>He steadied himself, only to notice Loursa staring at him. She looked as if she were trying desperately to figure out which of them had actually gone mad.</p> 
               <p>"Apparently," he growled, "they <i>want</i> me to tell you. No idea why, but I'm getting disgustingly used to that.</p> 
               <p>"I was a sellsword, and a damn good one. Did most of my work as part of a mercenary band, led by a guy named Craddek. Real bastard, the kind whose own mother would travel a week out of her way to avoid. But then, so were the rest of us."</p> 
               <p>"I'd never have guessed," Loursa said dryly.</p> 
               <p>Marcov ignored her. "It was back in early '08. We hit a town called... Shit, I don't remember <i>what</i> it was called. Not sure I ever knew, come to think of it. Few miles east of Saringallow, down in Isger. No war, no part of any contract. Just something we did occasionally between jobs to keep the purses full and the urges sated."</p> 
               <p>He grinned without humor as Loursa gasped and stepped back. "Not all that worldly, are you, ‘m'lady'? Most who earn a living with steel? Not much different than the men we killed earlier. They're just the bad guys when it's <i>your</i> home they're hitting."</p> 
               <p>A long silence, then. Marcov, despite his fatigue, rose from the chair and began to pace. "Things got out of hand this time," he said finally. "Peasants fought back harder than we expected. Killed a couple of the boys before we subdued them. Craddek was <i>pissed</i>, and the rest of us not much calmer.</p> 
               <p>"We killed them. <i>All</i> of them. The whole town was muddy with the mess, and when we were done, there wasn't a man, woman, or child left breathing."</p> 
               <p>The color drained from Loursa's cheeks.</p> 
               <p>"The thing of it is," he continued, "being dead didn't keep them from being angry. Really, <i>really</i> angry.</p> 
               <p>"I don't know why they picked <i>me</i> out of everybody there. Maybe it was random. Maybe I killed someone special. Hell, maybe it's 'cause I was born in Ustalav; we've got a whole culture built on ghost stories. Damned if I know, and they're not talking."</p> 
               <p>He stopped at the table, leaned on his knuckles. "I remember a howl, like a hurricane, and then screams... Countless screams, echoing forever. When I woke up, Craddek and the others were long gone—and I had myself a <i>new</i> band of traveling companions.</p> 
               <p>"I haven't lived my own life in years. They're with me constantly, Loursa. Every minute of every day, every second of every dream. They don't speak, unless it's through the bodies of the dead, but they're not shy about letting me know what they want me to do. They'll help me accomplish my ‘assignments'—you've seen them manifest their powers—but they don't <i>ever</i> take no for an answer.</p> 
               <p>"I wasn't in the River Kingdoms for you people. I was in Daggermark, trying to find Craddek. Keep hoping that if I can find him and the others, kill them, just maybe the damned ghosts'll be satisfied. You want to know why I showed up here? Why I give a tarnished copper about a few towns in Touvette? Because <i>they</i> do. Not the first time they've gotten me involved in this sort of crap, either. Guess it reminds them of, well, them."</p> 
               <p>He looked up into his companion's face, pale as the dead of whom he spoke, and wondered briefly what his own looked like. He'd never told the story before, couldn't even begin to separate and identify the emotions it stirred up now.</p> 
               <p>"<i>That's</i> who I am, Loursa. That's <i>what</i> I am. So you want to stand there looking horrified at me? Or shall we discuss what we can do to keep any more of Touvette's peasantry from joining the ghosts themselves?"</p> 
               <p align="center">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>"I'm terribly sorry, Master... what did you say your name was?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you got me," Marcov said. "I deliberately didn't mention it earlier, but you've tripped me up with your clever ruse. How <i>did</i> I let you outsmart me like that?"</p> 
               <p>The priest's scowl deepened the already severe crags of his aged face. "Whatever. I'm afraid I haven't the slightest idea who you're—"</p> 
               <p>"Must we? Half-elf. Goes by the name Khydol. Priest of Calistria."</p> 
               <p>It had been easy enough to figure out that much in the aftermath of yesterday's struggle at Alvren. Even if Zarred's corpse hadn't told them as much, the holy symbol etched into the stolen pendant was blatant enough.</p> 
               <p>Calistria, goddess of—among other things—retribution. So yeah, made sense that one of her priests might seek revenge on Touvette for the expulsion of the churches, especially if he or those he cared for were among the displaced. Loursa, given her attitudes toward religion in general, had been quick to accept that explanation.</p> 
               <p>Marcov was less convinced. He'd known a few Calistrians, back in his mercenary days. They could be savage when wronged, sure, but slaughtering whole villages of peasants—that seemed a little hard, even for them. And he still couldn't help but wonder who'd warned Khydol that he and Loursa were coming.</p> 
               <p>Conflicted and uncertain—Zarred knew only what he'd been paid to do, not why—they'd followed the dead bandit chief's directions to Khydol's home, a ramshackle town just across the border in Pitax. Once there, they couldn't split up fast enough for Loursa's tastes. Marcov almost smiled at her eagerness to seek out Khydol through the town's social gatherings, while he took the religious tack.</p> 
               <p><i>It's almost as if my story made her dislike me or something.</i></p> 
               <p>Now Marcov stood in a slope-roofed wooden structure built more like a northern feast hall than a church. Still, it was a sight one would never see in neighboring Touvette. Rows of kneeling cushions and blocks on which to sit faced a generic shrine over which draped an array of altar cloths, each embroidered with the symbol of a different god.</p> 
               <p>It was the town's only center of worship. Marcov knew it, and the priest <i>knew</i> Marcov knew it.</p> 
               <p>"There's zero chance," Marcov concluded, "that you don't know a fellow priest in a flyspeck like this one. So can we just skip all the denials?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I know Khydol," the priest admitted, tone as stiff as his back. "We forbade him from leading prayers here. He was stirring up trouble, preaching violence against Touvette."</p> 
               <p>"Decided to do more than preach it, holy man."</p> 
               <p>"Maybe so. But I'll still—" They both paused as a village matron strode through the door and knelt beside the shrine. "Still not deliver him to a thug like you!" the old man continued, his voice lowered.</p> 
               <p>Now Marcov <i>did</i> smile. "Sure you will."</p> 
               <p>"If you think you can intimidate me into—"</p> 
               <p>"Khydol is responsible for the destruction of half a dozen villages in Touvette, and the deaths of hundreds. You live near the border; you must know how the General's knights respond to those who threaten their people."</p> 
               <p>"We're safe here," the priest insisted, though his face had blanched. "King Irovetti—"</p> 
               <p>"Irovetti," Marcov interrupted, "is desperate for people to take Pitax seriously as a kingdom, rather than a den of thieves and beggars. If he were told that a nothing little community like yours was harboring an enemy of Touvette, at about the same time the General's men showed up looking for a little payback, you think he wouldn't grant them permission to do what they want with the ‘criminals'?"</p> 
               <p>The clergyman's jaw sagged; his hands visibly shook.</p> 
               <p>"Khydol dies either way, priest. Only question is, you want everyone else here to go with him?"</p> 
               <p align="center">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>"Can I help you, miss?"</p> 
               <p>Loursa gave a tired smile as she allowed the door to swing shut behind her. "Hope so. I'm looking for a man by the name of Khydol. People tell me he frequents your establishment."</p> 
               <p>"He certainly does," Ellithir said, her grin equally friendly. "Why don't you come in, and I'll see what I can tell you."</p>

               </div> <span itemprop="description"><p>Remember when Paizo first announced the new 64-page format for the module line back in November 2012? I recall mentally comparing it side-by-side with the 32-page modules from the perspective of a Venture-Lieutenant, store liaison, and event organizer. Those 32 pages were already pretty tough to squeeze into a one-day event. 64 pages would certainly be impossible. I remember thinking back then that Mike and Mark would have to do some clever thinking to find some way to sanction the module for Pathfinder Society Organized Play. I shrugged and just assumed that I would end up writing the boons for the Chronicle sheets but nothing more.</p></span> 
               <p>Soon after I started work at Paizo in February, they both asked me what my plan was for sanctioning <a href="/products/btpy8yvy"><i>Dragon's Demand</i></a>. My how things change over the course of a few months.</p> 
               <p>The new module format is an exciting opportunity to explore new ways of sanctioning adventures that were not written with Pathfinder Society in mind. On one end we have the 32-page modules that are sanctioned in their entirety, allowing players to earn 3 XP and experience a complete story. On the other end we have the Pathfinder Adventure Path line, which gets sliced up a bit during the sanctioning process to provide players and organizers with a fairly contained play experience that might fill the same amount of time as a 32-page module. Players can experience Adventure Paths in "campaign mode," in which the players just play the Adventure Path as they like and get Chronicle sheets in the end, or they can play in "module mode," in which the players only play the sanctioned sections. I love the versatility that these two options give groups, but I also love knowing that players have experienced the full story that an Adventure Path has to offer.</p> 
               <p>With 64 pages there's just enough material that it seems in need of trimming, but at the same time the length is so tantalizingly accessible that I wince at the thought of irreverently carving it up for a waiting crowd of Pathfinder Society players. Also the idea that a character could progress a full six levels in one module is both exciting and daunting; it both means that players can zip ahead to enjoy higher level content, but it also means that they can level up a character far faster than is intended. That would probably also mean making six Chronicle sheets!</p> 
               <p>Well, let me get the bad news out of the way first: Playing through all of Dragon's Demand will not grant a Pathfinder Society character six levels of credit. Now let's talk about everything else, which is all positive.</p> 
               <p>You can play through Dragon's Demand in either "campaign mode" or "module mode." In module mode, the module is broken into three large chunks that grant respective Chronicle sheets, cover about 75% of the module, and can be played stand-alone. As usual, one can play any legal, level-appropriate character in each sanctioned section—even playing a different character in each.</p> 
               <p>In campaign mode, one can play through the whole module with a single character (Pathfinder Society legal or not, just like in Adventure Paths). During the adventure, you level up your character following normal Pathfinder rules, just like in a home game. If you play through the whole thing, you not only get the three Chronicle sheets, but you also gain a fourth sheet. Each one represents 3 XP and 4 Prestige, so playing the whole story not only means that you get to enjoy the whole story; it means your character's XP value in Pathfinder Society more accurately reflects the challenges you overcame.</p> 
               <p>I'm sure someone will ask, so here are the planned level ranges for the Chronicle sheets and sanctioned portions.</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Chronicle sheet 1: Level 1–3 </li>
                <li>Chronicle sheet 2: Level 3–5 </li>
                <li>Chronicle sheet 3: Level 5–7 </li>
                <li>Bonus Chronicle sheet: Level 2–6 </li>
               </ul> 
               <p>Enjoy the scenario, and you'll have a 4th-level dragonslayer with a Chronicle sheet ready to apply once you gain a level.</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> <span itemprop="description"><p>So those of you who've had a chance to check out our newest adventure module, <i>The Dragon's Demand</i>, have doubtless noticed changes to the module format. The biggest change is, of course, the expansion in size from 32 pages to 64 pages, but there's other changes as well. Each module will contain a two-sided poster map, for one—<i>The Dragon's Demand</i> features a poster map of the town of Belhaim on one side and the town's amphitheater (mapped out at minis scale) on the other. We'll be presenting more than one new monster in each adventure, and each adventure will also come with a longer support article for a region, location, organization, or the like (in <i>The Dragon's Demand</i>, this is a four page overview of the town of Belhaim, including a huge chart of what most of the buildings in town are for, who lives there, and how well they interact with each other and with PCs).</p></span> 
               <p>But there's another thing, and that's the one I'm here to introduce.</p> 
               <p>There are a lot of quests your PCs can undertake in <i>The Dragon's Demand</i>—24 of them, in fact. Each one of these quests grants experience points and, often, gold or magic or other rewards for completing them. In order to help the GM track these quests, we've summarized all 24 of them on page 3 of the adventure, including when the PCs should gain the quest and what they need to do to finish the quest.</p> 
               <p>But what about the players, you ask?</p> 
               <p>That's where Pathfinder Cards: The Dragon's Demand comes in! This deck of cards contains item cards of key treasures you'll find in the adventure and face cards for all of the important NPCs, but about half of the cards are a brand new type of card—quest cards!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO3032-SampleCard3.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO3032-SampleCard_180.jpeg" border="0"></a> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO3032-SampleCard.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO3032-SampleCard2_180.jpeg" border="0"></a> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO3032-SampleCard2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO3032-SampleCard3_180.jpeg" border="0"></a> 
               </div> 
               <p>We're showing off three of these quest cards here. When your party reaches a point at the adventure where an NPC sets you on a quest, or where you discover something in the course of play that serves as the start of a quest, the GM simply gives you a copy of the appropriate quest card. There's blank space on the backside of each quest card for your group to track notes, and when you finish the quest, you can even record the reward here. With these quest cards, you won't have to worry about forgetting to follow up on opportunities for more adventure!</p>

               <p>Not a knitter? The charts could easily be adapted for crochet or needlepoint. And for those who got the original pattern at the crafting circle, this version fixes an error in Row 8 of the washcloth (good catch, Kalyna Conrad!), and simplifies the decrease rows of the hat.

               <p>We're going to cover five miniature reveals this week, as we have to get cracking to preview the whole set before its release. I've got piles and piles of figures and images from the next two sets I'm also dying to show you, but that will come after Gen Con and the release of the <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-LadyGhoul.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-LadyGhoul_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up first this week is the Lady Ghoul, a common figure you've already seen as an <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lewf">Undead Horde Builder Series</a> repaint. Here we have the original article in all her bloody glory. Teamed up with the ghouls from the <a href="/products/btpy8zd9">Undead Horde</a> and <a href="/products/btpy8rqs">Rise of the Runelords</a> sets and you've got more than enough figures to make a really compelling series of ghoul encounters.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-SandaraQuinn.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-SandaraQuinn_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>A fellow crewmember shanghaied aboard a pirate ship with the PCs in the very first <a href="/products/btpy8rcc">Skull &amp; Shackles adventure</a>, Sandara Quinn is one of the most important NPCs in the entire Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path. WizKids did a great job with the magical effect on her hand, and I dare say this is the best pipe-smoking pirate yet produced in prepainted plastic. Sandara Quinn is an uncommon figure, as she also works to bulk up pirate crews and would make an interesting choice for a player character figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Luccaria.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Luccaria_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This shadowy seductress is Luccaria, high priests of the evil god Norgorber. This ally of the Cheliax faction has plenty of nasty surprises for your player characters. While the campaign features only one Luccaria, we put her at the uncommon rarity because we think she makes a cool-looking cultist in general, and you can never have enough of those.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-DaughterOfImerta.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-DaughterOfImerta_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Some of the ladies in the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path are not so alluring, at least visually speaking. Daughters of Imerta are cyclopean fiendish harpies, and what they lack in looks they make up for in captivating songs sure to drive your player characters to distraction. The Daughter of Imerta is a Large rare figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-IsabellaLocke.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-IsabellaLocke_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Last up this week is Isabella Locke, a foul pirate captain who just happens to have a treasure map tattooed on her skin. I confess that when I added her to the list of figures for this set, I had no idea how and even if WizKids could pull off the map tattoo effect. It's not tremendously visible from the photos, but they managed to absolutely nail the visual effect, and you can actually see the point on her back where X marks the spot on a little island. Oh, and the figure also has a super-cool clear plastic spell effect on one of her hands. This is definitely one of those figures that gets cooler ever time you look at it, and in terms of complexity of design, the tattoos make it one of the highlights of the set. Isabella Locke is a rare figure. </p> 
               <p>That's it for this week! Join us next week as we finish off reveals of all the standard figures in the Skull &amp; Shackles set!</p> 
               <p>Until then,</p>

               <p>For the greater part of a year, we've had to keep much about the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game under wraps. After a while, all I wanted was to show the game to someone—anyone—outside the walls.</p> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">In the last couple weeks, I got my wish. First at the GTS Distribution Come and Play Day, then at PaizoCon, we took the shrinkwrap off our new creation. The first reaction from everyone was, "Wow, that's a big box." As I showed the game with all of its expansions nestled in the tray, everyone started to appreciate the intricacy of the planning on this game. Over 1,150 cards and all of their containers fit nicely in the box.</span></p> 
               <p>Which is all very well and good. But the real test would be people's reactions to how it played. At PaizoCon, my developers Chad, Gaby, Tanis, and Paul ran the game alongside a group of Pathfinder Society volunteers, and the tables were always hopping. Folks came away from our demos with a desire to play the real game, one we happily indulged. Reports from the field were highly positive.</p> 
               <p>But if you weren't at those demos, you're probably wondering how you can find out how the game works. Well, here, at long last, is <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">the rulebook</a>. Now you can flip through it and see what awaits you next month when the game debuts for sale at Gen Con.</p> 
               <p>There's a lot in this rulebook. We weren't content to just give a sequence and examples of how to play. We loaded it up with strategy sidebars, prebuilt characters, and tips on making your own cards. (More on that last bit in a month or two.) There's also a fairly long list of playtesters, without whom this game would not have half the awesome that it does.</p> 
               <p>But maybe you don't want to read about it. Maybe you want someone to demo the game for you, just as if you were at PaizoCon. OK, we can handle that. From the GTS event, here are Chad and myself joining Watch It Played's Rodney Smith for a full demo of the game.</p>

               </center> 
               <p>It's a pretty stellar video, if I do say so myself. And I hope to run into you at Gen Con and PAX Prime next month, where my team and I can show you the game ourselves. Because, y'know, we finally get to do so.</p>

              <h2>Chapter Two: Worse Than the Disease</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> <span itemprop="description"><p>The faintest shower of sleet, scarcely more than an icy fog, began to fall over the battlefield that had been the town of Kelbran. Just another instance of the peculiar freezes and unnatural weather afflicting eastern Touvette in recent months, but this time—as visibility grew cloudy and the churned muck of the earth thickened—it almost seemed a harbinger of the oncoming stranger.</p></span> 
               <p> They heard his approach before he appeared; citizens, bandits, corpses—all turned toward the clatter and splash of a warhorse thundering across the frost-kissed grass. Pounding in from the north, it grew louder, then louder still, until it was joined by the wordless cry of a warrior seeking blood.</p> 
               <p> All of which left the brigands more than a little bewildered when the mounted figure appeared from the <i>west</i>, bursting through the flimsy curtain of sleet in absolute, almost phantasmal, silence. Dark of hair, dark of armor, he wielded a massive blade from atop a russet stallion that appeared to be all muscle and resentment. The man swung his sword with a walloping force that seemed beyond the ability of a normal man. Striking like steel lightning, his blade sliced through the mist, hewing down foes as the warhorse bulled ahead. Four of the bandits fell, life gushing into the soil, before the others could even guess at the unbound fury that faced them.</p> 
               <p> Loursa had no idea whom their savior might be, and for the moment, she wasn't about to question. Instead, with a cry, she led Kelbran's survivors in a renewed attack on their assailants.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Loursa.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Loursa_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br>"Loursa leads Kelbran's survivors against the enemy."
               </div> 
               <p> Even fighting for her life, she couldn't quite take her eyes off the stranger. Whoever—<i>whatever</i>—he was, he was no more natural than the walking dead, and not merely for his abnormal strength. Blade and bludgeon veered at the last instant, sliding past rather than biting into his flesh or even the steel protecting it. In his wake, men who had fallen to seemingly nonfatal wounds twitched, shuddered, and died all the same. He lashed out with his empty hand, as well as his sword, and those he struck fell screaming, limbs withered or skin split.</p> 
               <p> Perhaps of greater import than any of his eerie abilities was his utter lack of fear. Against one foe or a dozen, living or undead, his arm never wavered, his expression never changed. Where even the bravest of Loursa's companions hesitated to draw near the bandits' shambling allies, the newcomer mercilessly drove his mount to close, his blade filleting desiccated flesh from rotting bone.</p> 
               <p> When the last handful of surviving bandits fled into the falling sleet, the citizens of Kelbran gave a ragged cheer, Loursa loudest of them all.</p> 
               <p> Not the stranger. Apparently unsatisfied still, he wheeled his horse and charged after the raiders. Loursa cringed as the din of slaughter and unanswered pleas sounded long after the lot of them had disappeared from sight.</p> 
               <p> The guard and her neighbors exchanged uncertain glances, then set about gathering the wounded. They'd been at it for perhaps five minutes when the horse reappeared at a walk. The rider dropped from the saddle, sword leaning on one shoulder. As he neared, Loursa could see that nothing about him other than that sword seemed to be in any worthwhile shape, and that the sleet melting down his skin was probably the nearest he'd come to bathing in weeks.</p> 
               <p> "Draeven," he announced in a bored tone, as though common courtesies were a burden he could do without. "Marcov Draeven. Who commands here?"</p> 
               <p> Loursa shrugged. "I suppose I do, now. My name is Loursa—"</p> 
               <p> "Fine." Draeven spun his blade, drove it point-first into the soil and left it standing. He stretched, arching his shoulders and craning his neck to one side. The resulting crack rivaled a small siege engine. "Anything to drink around here?"</p> 
               <p> "I'm sure we can find you something," Loursa said through clenched teeth. "I want to thank you for—"</p> 
               <p> "Don't. I didn't do this for you, and I don't especially want to be here." Then, before she could reply further, he idly kicked an arm that had, until recently, been attached to a shambling corpse. "Walking dead. I never heard anything about your bandit problem being an undead problem."</p> 
               <p> "Neither had we. I think this is the first time those—those <i>things</i> appeared. Maybe because Kelbran is the first town those bastards couldn't take on their own."</p> 
               <p> "Maybe." For the first time, his expression changed, sliding into a nasty grin. "Bet you're wishing about now that you hadn't booted <i>all</i> the clerics, aren't you?"</p> 
               <p> Mutters rippled through the citizens, and Loursa drew herself up rigid. "The churches turned on Touvette. They were a bad element. We've been better off since the General ousted them and set up the charities in their stead."</p> 
               <p> "Oh, yeah." The man allowed his gaze to fall heavily upon the moaning, crying wounded. "I can see that. They look <i>much</i> better off."</p> 
               <p> "I appreciate your help, Draeven," she said coldly, "but unless you've been granted a traveling pass, I think maybe it's time you left. Or would you rather I escort you to the nearest judge and you can explain to him why you're not a spy and shouldn't hang?"</p> 
               <p> Draeven waved his hand dismissively. "Lost it in battle, I'm afraid. But I have a feeling you'll be issuing me a new one shortly, Loursa. Otherwise, you'll never find out who's been launching these attacks, and I won't be able to send him to the nearest convenient hell. I'm not leaving without an answer. Or that drink."</p> 
               <p> "You didn't leave anyone alive who could <i>provide</i> any answers!"</p> 
               <p> Again, Draeven offered that ugly, crooked smile. "That's not too much of an inconvenience, really."</p> 
               <p> After a brief and apparently perfunctory examination, the foreigner knelt beside a deceased bandit. The man had fallen from a nasty slash through his ribs; Loursa grew more and more puzzled as Draeven prodded at the corpse's mouth and head. He looked for all the world like a gourmand examining a haunch of beef.</p> 
               <p> She grew more bewildered still when Draeven said, "All right, you bastards. Make yourselves useful and get in there." Not only did it not make sense, but his head was twisted to one side while he spoke, as if he addressed neither the dead body nor Loursa herself, but some nonexistent entity between them.</p> 
               <p> Loursa staggered, unable to repress a startled breath, when the dead man's jaw creaked open of its own accord. Horrified gasps and angry murmurs ran through the gathered townsfolk. Loursa wondered briefly if some of them weren't actually planning to attack Draeven.</p> 
               <p> She listened with rapt attention as they talked, these two unnatural creatures. Draeven spoke under his breath, his words intended for the corpse alone. The sounds that emerged from the body itself scarcely seemed to be words at all. Soft wheezes and croaking whispers, kneaded by dead lips into shapes that only vaguely resembled syllables, occasionally wafted to Loursa's ears, but she was too distant to make any sense of them. The sleet ceased falling, the wind stilled, and gradually the low drone of those voices became the world's only sound.</p> 
               <p> When Draeven finally concluded his "conversation" and stood, it was all Loursa could do not to either draw her sword or back away. Both urges were only strengthened when she realized that the man's hair, and the sleeves of his tunic, billowed in the unmoving air.</p> 
               <p> "You know Alvren?" he asked.</p> 
               <p> "I—what?"</p> 
               <p> Draeven sighed. "Alvren. Do. You. Know it?"</p> 
               <p> "It's a small hillside community," Loursa replied, now definitely leaning more toward the "draw her sword" option. "It's about fifteen miles north, on the border with Pitax."</p> 
               <p> "Good. Let's go."</p> 
               <p> "Why the hell you'd believe I'd go <i>anywhere</i> with you—"</p> 
               <p> "Because," he drawled, "I need a local to guide me. And like it or not, you owe me for saving your hide." Then, just as she was drawing breath to retort: "And we want the same thing. At least, I assume so. You <i>do</i> want these raids to stop, right? I'm not giving you too much credit, there?"</p> 
               <p> "No." That single word was icier than all the fallen sleet.</p> 
               <p> "Then can we get moving already?"</p> 
               <p> Spitting curses, more than a few of which called upon or profaned gods her people no longer worshiped, Loursa stalked back into Kelbran to gather supplies.</p> 
               <p align="CENTER">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>The basement was pungent with soil and mildew, a stench utterly unconcealed by acrid fumes of ceremonial incense. Walls of damp earth bulged, supported by a haphazard array of mold-covered wooden beams that sagged, exhausted, under the heavy load. An equally rickety staircase slouched up to a trapdoor that was the cellar's only exit.</p> 
               <p> Well, its only <i>nonmagical</i> exit.</p> 
               <p> The inhabitants of the chamber sat, crouched, or sprawled around the cellar's peculiar centerpiece: a circular well of granite, sunk deep into the earth and filled to overflowing with filthy, stagnant water. A stone obelisk, rough-surfaced but perfectly cylindrical, rose from the precise center of the foul pool. Only if viewed from directly above would the peculiar monument appear as a representation of a staring, disembodied eye.</p> 
               <p> Ellithir leaned back from the edge and brushed a stray lock of hair behind a pointed ear. Over the simple woolen tunic and leggings with which her customers in the store above were familiar, she now sported a voluminous black tabard, torn ragged around the hems. "Well, sisters." She waved idly at the images that were only now fading from the pool. "What do we make of this?"</p> 
               <p> "Death swaddles him." This from a figure hunched in the shadows across the dark water, a silhouette that might or might not have been human. Her voice was dull, monotonous, like a woman entranced. "An infant's blanket and a burial shroud, both at once. He walks with ghosts. They ride him, as a stallion newly broken."</p> 
               <p> "Yes, dear, I think we all got that." It was a third who spoke now, a long and lanky shape whose height and proportion, though generally humanoid, were clearly anything <i>but</i> human. "I could barely see the morsel, for all the phantom energies swirling about him. But I believe our sister's <i>point</i> was that we ought really to decide what to <i>do</i> about him."</p> 
               <p> "More or less what I meant, yes," Ellithir said. "We didn't plan for anyone like him, but we knew <i>someone</i> would interfere eventually." The coven had summoned a host of foul creatures through a variety of spells—some far worse than the undead Khydol had raised—and set them loose along the highways of Touvette. They'd kept the General's knights nicely distracted from the bandits, but the coven knew well that their diversions couldn't last indefinitely.</p> 
               <p> "Do we call it done, then, dearie? Leave the cleric and his thugs to their fate? The bloodshed's already been heavier than we could have demanded. Perhaps we've accomplished enough for now."</p> 
               <p> "The priest's wrath rages hot, still," the other shadowed woman droned. "We can burn plenty more, before the conflagration dies."</p> 
               <p> Ellithir nodded. "I'll send a warning to Khydol, making sure he thinks the message came from some supposed ‘survivor' of the Kelbran battle. He and the rest of Zarred's bandits should be more than enough for this newcomer, once they know he's coming."</p> 
               <p> The larger figure shifted, stretching. "And if they're <i>not</i> enough?"</p> 
               <p> "Mm. Can the two of you assist me in renewing the weather magics before you depart? Wouldn't do to have the ‘punishment of the gods' suddenly let up."</p> 
               <p> "Those spells shouldn't require renewing until the day after tomorrow."</p> 
               <p> "No, but I intend to be busy for the next few days. Contingencies, in case—as you suggest—Khydol and Zarred don't come through. One way or another, ghosts or no, it behooves us to ensure that this Draeven is just another corpse on the pile.</p> 
               <p> "The flesh is filth, my sisters," she concluded, her tone abruptly formal, ritualistic. "The world is pain. To see is to hate."</p> 
               <p> From the others, in unison, "And the Hag sees all."</p> 
               <p align="CENTER">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p><i>Slipping, Marcov, you wretched fool. Should have known this was too easy...</i></p> 
               <p> Should have known—and would have known, only a few years ago, when his arm and eye were honed by a life behind the sword. Before the fury and frustration. Before the drink.</p> 
               <p> Before the ghosts.</p> 
               <p> They'd reached Alvren quickly enough, stopping only for a few hours to rest up after the battle at Kelbran. It proved an easy journey, over open fields with only the occasional rolling hill, and often across trails tramped flat by years of passing feet, human and animal alike.</p> 
               <p> And they'd taken every precaution. Marcov had learned much from the corpse he'd interrogated. He knew that the bandit leader—named Zarred—had depopulated Alvren and taken it as a base camp for his band. He knew there were several dozen men left in that band, but Alvren should house only a fraction of them at any given time. He knew the band had been hired by someone to make these raids, though presumably only Zarred and his immediate lieutenants knew who.</p> 
               <p> What Marcov <i>hadn't</i> known, Loursa had. Familiar with the geography and—though he would never deign to admit it—possessed of a sharp sense of tactics, she'd planned a nighttime approach that kept them hidden behind Alvren's own houses and barns.</p> 
               <p> Between their swords and what advantages Marcov could squeeze from the souls who rode him, they'd cut down a trio of riders patrolling near the hill, and a pair of sentries at the edge of town. They'd been so silent, in fact, that the choir of frogs and crickets—those that had survived the recent freeze—hadn't been sufficiently disturbed to cease their calls.</p> 
               <p><i>So why, why, after battling a throng of bloody undead, was I too stupid to check for magical defenses?</i></p> 
               <p> It had erupted from the earth, a blast of thunderous force that shattered the night, nearly deafening him even as it hurled him and Loursa from their feet. Soil and splinters rained around them, and the world seemed subtly tilted as Marcov struggled to rise.</p> 
               <p> Now, cursing himself for an idiot and the phantoms for dragging him into this mess, he finally staggered to his feet. One more abrupt lean almost sent him sprawling again, and then the earth righted itself enough for Marcov to see what he faced.</p> 
               <p> "Well... shit."</p>

               <p><b>What does choosing to pick up at Gen Con mean?</b><br> Shortly before the convention we will charge your card and, where appropriate, give you access to the corresponding PDF. (This will happen at the same time as subscribers who aren't picking up at Gen Con—your PDFs won't be delayed by choosing to pick up at Gen Con.) For convention pickup, 7% sales tax will be added to your order—but you won't pay any shipping fees. To guarantee availability of your subscription items at Gen Con, you must pick up your subscriptions from the Paizo booth by Saturday, August 17th when the exhibitor hall closes.</p> 
               <p><b>When do I have to pick up my subscription by:</b><br> In order to make sure you are able to get all of your subscription items, we recommend picking up your subscriptions as soon as possible once you get to Gen Con. We are only able to ensure availability of subscription products through Saturday when the exhibitor hall closes. You can still come by for subscription pick up on Sunday, but we can't guarantee the subscription items availability.</p> 
               <p><b>What do I need to pick up my subscription items?</b><br> Bring your ID, and make sure you know what email address you use for logging into Paizo.com.</p> 
               <p><b>What happens if I choose to pick up at Gen Con but end up not being able to pick up my items?</b><br> If you select the option on the website to pick up subscriptions at Gen Con but do not actually pick them up at the show, the sales tax will be credited to your account, you will be charged for shipping and we will ship your items to you as soon as possible.</p> 
               <p><b>Is there anything else I might want to keep in mind when deciding if I want to pick up my subscriptions at Gen Con?</b><br> There is a lot of items that can be picked up this year! If you subscribe to multiple subscription lines, you'll want to keep in mind how much room you have in your suitcase, especially for the Adventure Card Game which is a very big box (14.25 x 12.75 x 4 inches)!</p> 
               <p><b>I can't make it to Gen Con, can my friend, family member, partner, husband/wife pick up my subscriptions?</b><br> Nope, subscriptions must be picked up by the account holder. We will not release subscription pick ups to anyone but the subscriber.</p> 
               <p><b>What if I have more questions about picking up subscription items?</b><br> Let customer service know! You can email us, <a href="mailto:customer.service@paizo.com?Subject=Gen%20Con%20Subscription%20Pick%20Up">customer.service@paizo.com</a>, you can post in the <a href="/messageboards/paizo/customerService">customer service forum</a>, or give us a call (425-250-0800, Monday-Friday from 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM Pacific time).</p> 
               <p>Can't wait to see you in Indy!</p>

               <p>We ran just over 230 tables for PFS games. That is an increase of more than 80 tables from last year. We debuted the Season 5 PFS Special, <a href="/products/btpy8xki"><i>Siege of the Diamond City</i></a>, which seems to have been received very well. We also debuted the GM 201 course to round out the GM training that started with GM 101 last year at PaizoCon.</p> 
               <p>The <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> also received quite a bit of buzz. Participants were able to try out demo decks using cards that will be released with the full set at Gen Con.</p> 
               <p>We also had the normal schedule of awesome events, such as the preview banquet, the lottery games, the seminars, and the other events that make PaizoCon the truly memorable event it was established to be.</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">Avast, me hearties! The Good Ship Pathfinder Battles has passed the intriguing Isles of PaizoCon and soon we will be upon the great continent of Gen Con. We've recently seen the release of the <a href="/products/btpy8ww8">We Be Goblins!</a> Builder Series, the <a href="/products/btpy8yj4">White Dragon Evolution</a> Encounter Pack, and the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lex5">Konkrud</a> convention special promotional figure (which we'll also have at Gen Con).

Rumors abound of an additional set by the end of the year, and the sea-salt smell of new announcements is in the briny air.</span></p> 
               <p>But forget all of that for a moment, because we've still got a few images to show off from the <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set, which will come out in August. With all of the other exciting things happening with Pathfinder Battles these days, it's important to remember that Skull &amp; Shackles rises the bar from its awesome predecessor <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star</a>. On its release, I'm confident folks will consider it among the very best prepainted plastic miniatures sets ever released. And with a ton of aquatic and pirate-themed monsters that have never previously appeared in prepainted plastic, I'm confident that most of you are going to adore these figures as much as I do.</p> 
               <p>But enough preamble. Raise the mainsail! It's time for previews!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-PirateSailor.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-PirateSailor_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>You can't have a pirate Adventure Path without a bunch of pirates, and our first preview this week reveals a rank-and-file female buccaneer we like to call the Pirate Sailor. It goes without saying that this common figure easily doubles as a player character or any kind of nautical NPC.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Wererat.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Wererat_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Pirate holds are filled with all kinds of scumbags and reprobates, and as far as Pathfinder creatures goes, it's hard to get more scummy and reprobatey than a Wererat. Whether paired with the Rat Swarm in this set or the Dire Rat in <a href="/products/btpy8mq6">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> or simply encountered on his own, this hybrid-form Wererat is a common figure, making it a great foundation of an entire encounter based around wererats. He's pretty great in-hand, and a very useful rendition of a frequently encountered creature, in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles">Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a> or otherwise.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Last up this week is Paeta, an unusual spider creature encountered in the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path. To my knowledge, this type of creature has never come out in prepainted plastic, and we think she makes a wonderful debut. This Large figure is slated at the rare rarity.</p> 
               <p>That's it for this week. Only a few more figures to show off before we shift over to <a href="/products/btpy909j">Legends of Golarion</a> in a couple of weeks!</p>

               <p><i>Doom Comes to Dustpawn</i> was a fun mix of roleplaying challenges and fierce combat that had my team of advanced players, with their favorite high level Pathfinders, racing to each encounter to find out what wild thing Mike Welham had in store for us next. The feeling of impending doom could be felt from the very start of the module. As the adventure progressed, we veered on and off course by my well meaning paladin's pursuit of monsters that didn't exist, and his fixation with labeling everything as a "vampire" or some derivative of vampire. He almost had it right, but not quite, and you'll never convince him there weren't vampires behind the whole thing!</p> 
               <p>The bizarre blend of aliens and manimals gone wild has a 50's scifi feel while keeping you firmly in Golarion with compelling lore and magic items. While our group was able to get through the adventure, other groups beware that things can quickly get out of hand! Overall our experience playing <i>Doom Comes to Dustpawn</i> was excellent, and I cannot wait to run it for my lodge mates!</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">Rattling shutters and gaps between the wooden slats of walls allowed a faint breeze into the store. The establishment smelled of dust, mildew, and the acrid aroma of burning leaves that kept the ubiquitous mosquitoes and flies from riding the weather inside. It wasn't that much of a store, all in all; but then, it wasn't that much of a town, either.</span></p> 
               <p>The bulk of the voices—and there were always voices, despite the store's ramshackle appearance—wafted from the counter opposite the door, and from the racks of meats and baked goods alongside. Ellithir allowed the locals to loiter, picking at the foods and paying for whatever they consumed, rather than insisting they buy in bulk. Just another way to compete with the eateries and taverns in town—all two of them. Even over the sounds of those voices, though, the willowy elf heard rickety floorboards beneath a hesitant tread, and the faint rustling and thumping of someone browsing idly through the aisles of various tools.</p> 
               <p>The visitor eventually emerged from the second aisle over, between haphazard coils of hempen rope and a portcullis of dangling rakes. Beneath a mop of unruly red hair, Khydol's face was morose. The gold-hued tunic he normally favored was hidden by a cloak and mantle of drab brown—as was the holy pendant he usually wore exposed for all to see.</p> 
               <p>Gracefully, her own steps squeezing nary a squeak from the floorboards, Ellithir stepped from behind the other counter—the one where she normally tallied up purchases—and produced a three-legged stool for her guest.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you." Clearly a response born solely of instinct; his eyes hadn't even focused on her. Ellithir studied him further: the abnormal garb, the pensive gaze, the faintly pointed ears indicating that he shared a portion of her own racial heritage.</p> 
               <p>Studied him, and waited for him to come to it in his own time.</p> 
               <p>"It's done," he said finally.</p> 
               <p>She nodded. She'd expected as much. "And this troubles you?"</p> 
               <p>"It..." he shrugged. "Yes. Somewhat. It's just... a lot to take on."</p> 
               <p>"I know it is." She reached out, gripping his shoulder tight. "We've talked about this, Khydol. You're doing the right thing. Look at what <i>else</i> is happening over there! Hail, in <i>this</i> season? Wilting crops? If the gods are finally showing their wrath at those apostates, surely <i>your</i> anger is justified!" It was an old discussion, one they'd held half a dozen times before. Khydol agreed with her, she knew that; he just had to be reminded.</p> 
               <p>"And besides," Ellithir continued, jabbing a finger at the half-elf's unseen holy icon, "what else would she ask of you but vengeance?"</p> 
               <p>Reverentially, Khydol reached beneath the woolen mantle and withdrew the heavy pendant. There, worked into the silver, were the triple daggers of the Savored Sting: Calistria, mistress of lust, deception... and retribution.</p> 
               <p>"The goddess be praised," Khydol murmured, softly but sincerely. Across the store, the voices began to taper off as men and women glanced out the windows, saw the first streamers of smoke writhing from over the horizon—and over the border.</p> 
               <p>"The goddess be praised," Ellithir echoed, her thin lips quirked in the faintest of smiles.</p>

               <p>In some taverns, a brawl means something has gone very wrong, and it's time to yell for the watch. In others, it just means that sailors are in port, or teamsters are between deliveries, and someone's imbibed a bit too freely.</p> 
               <p>And then there are those in which a brawl simply means "We're open."</p> 
               <p>The stranger—one of many—slouched in a rickety chair, trying to absorb the last dregs of warmth from the hearth's dying embers, and watched with profound disinterest as the last of this evening's rowdies were hurled out the door by the husband-and-wife team of half-orc bouncers. The fight hadn't even been fun to watch; those killjoy bouncers had stepped in too early.</p> 
               <p>He couldn't be bothered to remember the tavern's name. The latest in an endless line, tracing a pathway of pain across the Inner Sea, it was nothing to him but another place to drink, and maybe chase a few hours' slumber. It wasn't even a good place; that damn insect-repelling herbal smoke that had recently grown so popular throughout the River Kingdoms was giving him a headache.</p> 
               <p>Not that Marcov Draeven appeared any more special than the shabby ale hall. Grease-matted hair that might, if clean, have appeared a rich brown hung past his shoulders in ragged strings. Unshaven cheeks went beyond gaunt into sunken, and red-rimmed, deep-set eyes suggested many recent sleepless nights. An old and often-patched chain hauberk left rust stains on a tunic <i>almost</i> too dark to show them. Only his weapon, a monster of a hand-and-a-half sword, demonstrated any signs of care. It currently leaned against the wall, unscabbarded, like any old walking stick.</p> 
               <p>Any of the patrons who noticed him at all—and if they did, it was only for that naked blade—had certainly dismissed him as just another sellsword, gone somewhat to seed, haunted by past years.</p> 
               <p>They had <i>no idea</i> how right they were.</p> 
               <p>To those potential observers, it would surely have seemed just another drunken mishap as fingers fumbled and lost their grip. They might have chuckled as the mug toppled and bounced across the floor, leaving tiny chips to mingle with the layers of broken crockery that served as the tavern's carpet.</p> 
               <p>Only Marcov himself knew that he'd placed the damn thing solidly on the table, that his hand was a good four or five inches away when it had suddenly gone skidding over the edge.</p> 
               <p>"Pharasma take you!" His low growl was surely inaudible to any nearby ears. "Leave me <i>alone</i>! Just one evening, damn you..."</p> 
               <p>His sword wobbled against the wall, threatening to tilt.</p> 
               <p>Spitting curses, Marcov stumbled a few steps from the chair—not drunk, entirely, but not precisely sober either—and dropped to one knee, hand outstretched to retrieve the fallen tankard.</p> 
               <p>That lean brought him just near enough to the next table to overhear the conversation over the ambient cacophony. Which, he realized sourly, had been the entire point.</p> 
               <p><i>Their</i> entire point.</p> 
               <p>"...third town in as many weeks!"</p> 
               <p>"Bandits, maybe? Been a rough harvest. Lots of folks goin' hungry over there."</p> 
               <p>"Bandits <i>steal</i>, ya idiot. Kill a few; rape some, maybe. What kinda bandits burn whole towns to the ground?"</p> 
               <p>"I dunno. Angry ones?"</p> 
               <p>"Idiot."</p> 
               <p>"Yer <i>both</i> idiots. It's divine vengeance, it is. Knew it was comin' to 'em sooner or later."</p> 
               <p>"No!" Marcov hissed as he rose, wayward flagon forgotten. "Not my business. Not my problem!"</p> 
               <p>The mug at his feet shattered as though crushed beneath an unseen heel. His sword against the wall, and the chair he'd so recently vacated, began to rock.</p> 
               <p>"<i>No</i>, gods damn you!" He already had a goal, had somewhere to be! Why wouldn't they just—?</p> 
               <p>The chair toppled, one leg snapping loose. The embers in the fireplace burst upward, then extinguished themselves in a sizzling, sifting rain of ash.</p> 
               <p>And the howling began.</p> 
               <p>A single voice, at first. Then a dozen... three dozen... a hundred... more. Shrieks of terror, wails of despair, screams of agony, sobs of grief. The final gasps of the dying, and the hopeless moans of the damned.</p> 
               <p>Nobody else heard them—Marcov knew that all too well from prior experience—but that didn't make them any less deafening to him! Once more he fell to his knees, hands clasped to his ears, eyes squeezed so tightly shut that flickers of color flashed across his lids.</p> 
               <p>"Stop it! <i>Stop it!</i> Leave me <i>alone!</i>"</p> 
               <p>The howling only grew louder. The sword fell, sliding across the hearth, quillons grating on brick. Crockery atop the surrounding tables began to shake and clatter.</p> 
               <p>Strong-willed, stubborn, and prideful was Marcov Draeven. Even in the face of the unnatural onslaught, the gale of angry souls, it took him nearly a full minute to bend.</p> 
               <p>"All right! All right, you bastards, enough!" The sellsword's hands dropped from his ears to the floor, where he crouched like a wounded animal. "Enough," he repeated, far more softly.</p> 
               <p>The howling stopped. The surrounding objects ceased their impossible dance. And Marcov opened his eyes.</p> 
               <p>The room around him had changed, and not just by the will of the dead. Chairs and tables lay strewn where patrons had bolted to their feet and retreated from the spectral maelstrom. Quite a few had fled, to judge by the gaping door (and, in a some instances, windows). Most of those who remained stood, wide-eyed and sweating, pressed against the farthest walls, but a few edged forward, hands reaching for weapons.</p> 
               <p>Marcov slowly rose, stretched out his hand, and hissed something at his phantasmal retinue. The broad-bladed bastard sword flew from its spot by the hearth to land in his waiting palm with a muted slap.</p> 
               <p>The bravery rushed out of those few courageous souls, along with gasps and muted shrieks. They, too, fell back against the walls once more.</p> 
               <p>Marcov needed only a moment to find one of the men on whose conversation he had eavesdropped. "The towns you were talking about—where are they?"</p> 
               <p>"I... That... Towns? Sir, I don't want any—"</p> 
               <p>"Where. <i>Are.</i> They?"</p> 
               <p>"Touvette!" It was scarcely a squeak. "Eastern Touvette!"</p> 
               <p>A sharp nod, and then Marcov turned toward the shivering barkeep. "For the damages." He fumbled at his belt a moment before he found his coin purse, not due to any lingering intoxication—Marcov was <i>quite</i> sober now—but because his possessions had a bad habit of never remaining precisely where he'd put them. Finally, he scooped out a handful of silver, which he casually dropped to the floor when the barkeep showed no interest in coming anywhere near him. Then, sword still unsheathed resting flat upon his shoulder, Marcov strode toward the stables.</p> 
               <p align="center">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>The reinforced leather of Loursa's armor absorbed the stroke that would otherwise have split kidney and spine both. Still, she staggered a step across the churned and muddy field before spinning around, whipping sweaty strands of hair from her face, and slamming the heavy stock of the crossbow against the brigand's jaw. Something cracked—bone or wood, she wasn't certain, but the man collapsed. Loursa took that momentary respite to draw her own blade, catch a few deep breaths, and assess.</p> 
               <p>Kelbran hadn't been much better off than any of the other tiny communities scattered near Touvette's easternmost borders. The unseasonable ice storms had ravaged the settlement's crops as badly as its neighbors'; its people were just as desperate, just as destitute. But when the invaders came, and the first of the villages fell, Kelbran had welcomed survivors, rather than turning them away to seek refuge elsewhere. It was a decision that Loursa and the other guards had questioned when Samrev first made it, but the old village reeve had been adamant. "We have no charities in Kelbran to provide such services, as the great cities do," he'd said, "but we can <i>show</i> charity all the same." </p> 
               <p>He'd had a practical motive as well, it turned out. When the invaders finally came to Kelbran, the sixth community to suffer their depredations, Loursa and the other guards had met them with a much larger force than they'd anticipated—a force made up partly of refugees who, though starved and exhausted, burned with the need to avenge their own lost homes. Nobody knew how these bandits had managed to avoid the military patrols that scoured Touvette's major roads, but for the first time, it looked as though they might not be unstoppable.</p> 
               <p>Still, Kelbran had paid the price; Loursa wasn't sure, but she might well be the only guard left, and at least a third of the townsfolk lay hacked and mutilated. The rest fought in groups, overwhelming bandits alone or in pairs, making up in numbers and ferocity what they lacked in equipment and training. Loursa again brushed sandy hair from her face—she couldn't even remember when she'd lost her helmet—and hefted her sword, ready to go and assist. As long as nothing else changed, victory was just a matter of—</p> 
               <p>Everything disintegrated in a chorus of screams as the first of the dead shambled over the nearby knolls.</p> 
               <p>They weren't many, as compared to the townsfolk or bandits. But then, they didn't need to be. Dozens of villagers broke and ran. Those that remained stood rooted in shock, if only for an instant, and in that instant the invaders attacked with renewed vigor. The walking corpses had turned the tide in favor of their living allies before they'd even drawn near enough to strike.</p> 
               <p>The screaming only grew louder—not merely in pain or in panic, though both were plentiful enough, but in appalled recognition. Loursa's heart, already beating like a charging hound, climbed into her throat as she recognized many of these creatures as the dead citizens of other fallen towns.</p> 
               <p>The last few dozen survivors of Kelbran found themselves in a chaotic mass, their homes behind them, bandits and the shambling dead to all other sides. Loursa squeezed the hilt of her sword, struggling to hold tight despite the patina of sweat, and prayed for a miracle. <i>Any</i> miracle.</p> 
               <p>Had she known what sort of miracle was coming, her prayers might have been a bit more specific.</p>

               <p><span itemprop="description">Saturday night at the PaizoCon Preview Banquet, we announced the release of our next Pathfinder Battles prepainted miniatures set, <a href="/products/btpy909j">Legends of Golarion</a>! This 55-figure set is scheduled for an October 2013 release. It features monsters and characters inspired by the Pathfinder Campaign Setting and Pathfinder releases going back to the very beginning. Long-time Pathfinder fans will discover miniatures of old friends from classic Adventure Paths and Pathfinder Modules, while gamers new to Pathfinder will discover a set packed with high-use creatures like orcs, kobolds, and awesome monsters from the Pathfinder Bestiaries.</span></p> 
               <p>Today I'd like to show off a few figures from the <a href="/products/btpy909j">Legends of Golarion</a> set. You'll learn a lot more about the set in the coming months as we march our way toward its release, but we wanted to give you an early look at a few of the set's coolest figures now as a special PaizoCon treat.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Pyros.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Pyros_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>It wouldn't be a Pathfinder-inspired set without a few of our favorite pyromaniacs! Legends of Golarion finally gives us a chance to add torch-bearing firebugs to your goblin armies. The Goblin Pyros are perfect for <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords">Rise of the Runelords</a> or any Pathfinder game that would benefit from a little not-so-friendly fire. Both Goblin Pyros in the set are common figures.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KingAndQueen.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KingAndQueen_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have a regal pair from very different backgrounds. King Irovetti is a rough-and-tumble bandit lord from the River Kingdoms. Queen Ileosa is a contemptuous monarch from the Varisian city of Korvosa. He's from the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker">Kingmaker Adventure Path</a>, she's from the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> campaign. Their miniatures make for a cute couple, but I certainly wouldn't tell them that to their faces. Both are a bit on the despotic side, I'm afraid. Both figures are slated at the rare rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Efreeti.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Efreeti_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This is an Efreeti inspired by Jesper Ejsing's gorgeous <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/legacyOfFire">Legacy of Fire Adventure Path</a> cover paintings. We liked his Efreeti so much we made it the default illustration for the creature in the <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i></a>. I could hardly wait to put him on a miniatures list, and I'm pleased to announce his time has finally come. This Large figure is slated at the rare rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Dragon.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Dragon_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>And here we have the glorious <a href="/products/btpy909h">Gargantuan Green Dragon</a>, the case-incentive promotional figure for the Legends of Golarion set. Like the <a href="/products/btpy8rqo">Rune Giant</a>, <a href="/products/btpy8v08">Gargantuan Blue Dragon</a>, and <a href="/products/btpy8xrp">Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon</a> of previous sets, the Gargantuan Green Dragon is produced in extremely limited quantities. <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">Pathfinder Battles Case Subscribers</a> or folks who preorder a Standard Booster case may order 1 Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon per case purchased. The Gargantuan Green Dragon stands about as tall as the Gargantuan Blue Dragon in the <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star</a> set (about 7 inches tall). It retails for $39.99 (although Pathfinder Case Subscribers enjoy a 75% discount on this price).</p> 
               <p>Legends of Golarion Standard Boosters come in the now-familiar format of three Small or Medium figures and one Large figure per booster box. See the <a href="/products/btpy909j">product page</a> for more information on price, case quantities, and other details.</p> 
               <p>This Friday, we return to the high seas with more previews of the <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set.</p> 
               <p>And hey, if you're currently at <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>, be sure to stop by my annual Miniatures Trading Afterparty in the hotel bar from 1:00-3:00 PM!</p> 
               <p>See you Friday!</p>

               <p>One reason PaizoCon attendees have to be happy is that all of them received a FREE Pathfinder Battles miniature in their attendee bags. Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present you the 2013 Convention Promo Figure, the goblin warrior Konkrud!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Konkrud will also be available free with any $50 purchase at Paizo's booth at Gen Con Indy. Assuming our limited supply lasts, he will eventually also be available for sale here on paizo.com. </p> 
               <p>And for now, that's the only Pathfinder Battles miniatures reveal for the week.</p> 
               <p>We'll be making a Gargantuan announcement regarding the next complete set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures at the PaizoCon Preview Banquet on Saturday night, so expect a few big surprise minis reveals here on the Paizo Blog on Sunday.</p> 
               <p>Until then, I've got some player characters to kill, and a brand new goblin buddy to help me do the dirty work.</p>

               <p><b>Registration starts at 7am tomorrow</b> July 5th. We do go pretty fast getting people their packets, tickets and swag bags and we kindly request that if you do not have any early morning events you wait until 8am to line up so that attendees and volunteers with early games can get through the line before their game's start time. </p> 
               <p>To pick up your badge, please make sure you have your photo ID ready to go. Each attendee needs to pick up their own badge and minors should pick up badges with a parent or guardian present. </p> 
               <h2>So, what's to do while you're here?</h2> 
               <p>In addition to tons of gaming going on, we have lots of seminars, game demos and Pathfinder Society. </p> 
               <p>We have two very large seminar rooms and most seminars in Evergreen Salons F &amp; G are nowhere near capacity for ticketed attendees. Please be respectful of seminars taking place just before the one you might want to get into and wait until the allotted time before entering the room to keep distractions to a minimum. </p> 
               <p>Pathfinder Online (Mt. Rainer Room) and The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (Washington Ballroom) will be running demos 8am-6pm Friday and Saturday and from 9am-1pm on Sunday. Sasquatch Game Studio is hosting Thule Playtests (in Evergreen Salon I) on Friday from 2pm-6pm and Saturday 1pm-5pm. </p> 
               <p>And of course, there will be lots of Pathfinder Society. If you didn't sign up in advance, just head over to Pathfinder Society Head Quarters in the Washington Ballroom and the volunteers there will do their best get you set up with a game. </p> 
               <p>It wouldn't be a gaming convention without room for open gaming and we've got lots of room if you find friends new or old and want to get a game going on-the-fly. Find an open table in Seattle Rooms 1, 2 or 3 or in Evergreen Salon H or I. Some tables are reserved during certain times for scheduled games, but there should be plenty of open spaces for groups to sit down and play. Please note, the Seattle Rooms 1, 2, &amp; 3 and Evergreen Salons H &amp; I do not open for PaizoCon attendees until 2pm on Friday.</p> 
               <p>Near registration there is an <b>Event Ticket Trading Board</b>. If you missed out on online registration or are looking to pick up an event head over there and see if anyone has dropped off events they are no longer able to attend. I've seeded the board with events that had less than 10 spots available when we closed online event registration. </p> 
               <p>If you didn't purchase a <b>banquet ticket</b> before they sold out, but still want to attend the Preview Banquet, we <b>may</b> have a few extra tickets for sale at the door. They will be $25.00 cash (exact amount only please). Line up next to (but not in) the general banquet ticket line and if there are any open seats they will be sold on a first come first serve basis. The availability of these extra tickets is not a guarantee. </p> 
               <p>If you're attendees looking to connect with other gamers or sitting at home wondering what's going on at PaizoCon, check out the PaizoCon forums on our <a href="/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/paizocon">messageboard,</a> our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/181249555364332/" target="blank">facebook event page</a>, or use the twitter hashtag #paizocon and make sure to check in with the <a href="/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=paizo&amp;tab=paizo">Paizo Blog</a> as we will be live blogging throughout the weekend!</p> 
               <p>Happy Fourth of July and see you tomorrow morning!</p>

What I see is that many people enjoy the challenge that Season 4 presents with some finding it a little tough and a minority claiming that it still isn't hard enough.

               <p>Imagine my delight, then, when I began developing <i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4–26: The Waking Rune</i>! Here we have an epic finale to the Year of the Risen Rune, and the premise practically begs an almost impossibly difficult encounter, right? Well, I resisted that urge.</p> 
               <p>Somewhat.</p> 
               <p>Instead, I have built in an optional feature for this scenario as a tip of the hat to the diehard challenge-seekers. Season 4 introduced the six-player assumption with rules for scaling down encounters for tables of 4 PCs. <i>The Waking Rune</i> also includes rules for scaling <i>up</i> the encounters for added difficulty. This is an experiment and is intended only to enable a table to legally play on "hard mode" if <i>everyone</i> involved explicitly agrees to take on a tougher challenge. Doing the harder version does not grant better gold, XP, or Fame; it's just for bragging rights. You have been warned.</p> 
               <p>I trust that we'll all be good gaming citizens by not pressuring others into taking on this added challenge unless they really want it. Adding notes on scaling up encounters is something I'm willing to explore in future scenarios, but it depends on hearing feedback.</p> 
               <p>Allow me to make a polite request regarding the scenarios to be released in a few days. Excited as I am to hear what people think about these scenarios, be considerate in using spoiler tags on the messageboards and discretion in person. Many of the scenarios have big reveals that I imagine would be all the more exciting to discover during the adventure and not beforehand.</p> 
               <p>Happy adventuring!</p>
