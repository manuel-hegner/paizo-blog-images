  \ Reminiscences—The Paizo Years</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 19, 2012</p>\
  \ \n   <p>With PaizoCon 2012 now in the rear view mirror, my attentions turn toward\
  \ Gen Con in Indianapolis, August 16–19. I’ve personally gone to every Gen Con since\
  \ it was held at UW Parkside in Kenosha, Wisconsin, but since this is Paizo’s tenth\
  \ anniversary year—and Paizo’s tenth Gen Con—I figured I’d limit this blog to stories\
  \ from the last decade. Gen Con is and always has been our biggest show of the year\
  \ and the convention where we release our biggest products, so many seminal events\
  \ in Paizo’s history take place at this granddaddy of all gaming conventions.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Our trip down memory lane begins in August 2002. Paizo was a newly minted\
  \ company, having started business just one month prior, so we hadn’t lined up our\
  \ own booth at Gen Con. Our friends at Wizards of the Coast had already allocated\
  \ a part of their booth for the periodicals department that we’d taken over, so\
  \ they allowed us to set up camp in their castle for the show. Paizo’s owners and\
  \ a small team of editors spent the weekend talking to thousands of gamers who were\
  \ wondering what the future held in store for their favorite magazines with Paizo\
  \ at the helm.</p> \n   <p>Gen Con 2003 was all about the Paizo exclusive silver\
  \ Boba Fett action figure we’d organized as part of running the Official Star Wars\
  \ Fan Club and <i>Star Wars Insider</i> magazine. Vic and I knew what kind of excitement\
  \ an exclusive figure would generate, but I don’t think Gen Con had a clue. So imagine\
  \ their surprise when a huge storm of fans rushed the small Paizo booth and started\
  \ a long line that stretched past and even through other vendors’ booths! We sold\
  \ a ton of this action figure, but there was a little consternation among the employees\
  \ who worked on <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>: Gen Con was the D&amp;D show,\
  \ and they were used to taking the limelight at the booth. It was hard to argue\
  \ with the fact that Boba Fett paid a lot of bills, though, and all in all, it was\
  \ a really good Gen Con for Paizo.</p> \n   <p>2004 was the year we launched <i>Amazing\
  \ Stories</i> and <i>Undefeated</i>, and relaunched <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>.\
  \ We put free copies of all four magazines into each attendee’s gift bag, which\
  \ cost us a pretty penny. It didn’t ultimately make much of an impact on sales,\
  \ so it was probably not the best marketing decision we ever made, but we were excited\
  \ about what we were doing and we enjoyed giving potential customers issues to read\
  \ at their leisure. To celebrate the relaunches of <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>,\
  \ we created T-shirts that customers could get for free by starting a new subscription\
  \ or renewing an existing one. The <i>Dragon</i> T-shirt had Wayne Reynolds’ iconic\
  \ dragon bursting through the cover page, while the <i>Dungeon</i> tee had a picture\
  \ of Warduke, an homage to the D&amp;D cartoon series and action figure line from\
  \ the early 1980s. But the most controversial thing we did at the show that year\
  \ was bring the <i>Undefeated</i> cheerleaders. Jenny Bendel, our marketing manager,\
  \ wanted to create a stir and drive traffic to the booth, so we bought cheerleader\
  \ costumes with the <i>Undefeated</i> logo on them and hired some local models who\
  \ dressed in the cheerleader costumes and decorated passersby with <i>Undefeated</i>\
  \ temporary tattoos bearing Johnny Wilson’s slogan for the magazine, “Nobody Likes\
  \ a Loser.” Again, I’m not sure it helped sales all that much, but it sure did drive\
  \ traffic to our booth, including a couple of local television crews!</p> \n   <p>By\
  \ Gen Con 2005, we were already working toward making Paizo about more than magazines.\
  \ Our big release was the Shackled City hardcover, and we decided to create a huge\
  \ tower of books in the middle of the booth. We planned for hordes of customers\
  \ to snatch up their copies, making the tower disappear throughout the course of\
  \ the convention. Unfortunately, we brought way too many books, so even though sales\
  \ were brisk, much of the tower was still standing at the end of the con. </p> \n\
  \   <p>My favorite memory from Gen Con 2005 was the ENnie Awards ceremony. Paizo\
  \ had taken home our first ENnie—a gold award for <i>Dungeon</i>—in 2002, though\
  \ all of the work that was being recognized had been done by our employees when\
  \ they were still part of Wizards of the Coast. 2005 was the first year that the\
  \ accolades were truly our own. All in all, we won 4 gold awards and one silver—\
  but for me, the silver was the most exciting: it was for Best Publisher! Since its\
  \ inception, Paizo had been struggling to gain an identity in the gamer community.\
  \ If we were lucky, we were known as “the <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> company”\
  ; many, many readers hadn’t yet figured out that we weren’t actually part of Wizards\
  \ of the Coast. In industry surveys, retailers often reported Paizo sales as Wizards’\
  \ sales, and distributors still gave our magazines TSR product codes! So that silver\
  \ ENnie was validation that we were finally stepping out from the shadow of Wizards\
  \ and forging our own identity. It was a very sweet moment.</p> \n   <p>2006 was\
  \ all about trying to fill the gap where <i>Undefeated</i> and <i>Amazing Stories</i>\
  \ had been. Our GameMastery Map Packs and Item Cards were front and center in our\
  \ booth, along with our Compleat Encounters line. It was a bit of a transition year\
  \ for us, so we filled the booth with anything we think we could sell to gamers,\
  \ including a big bin of Toy Vault plush right in front of the register. We partnered\
  \ with Looney Labs that year to bring in a little more traffic and a little more\
  \ sales; Looney also partnered with us in 2007.</p> \n   <p>2007 marks the launch\
  \ of the Paizo that everybody knows today. We were sad to release the final print\
  \ issues of <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> at Gen Con, but we were very excited\
  \ about the debut of the Pathfinder Adventure Path, with James Jacobs’ now classic\
  \ “Burnt Offerings” adventure kicking off Rise of the Runelords. Our booth was decked\
  \ out in large Pathfinder banners showing off Wayne Reynolds’ new iconic character\
  \ artwork. Our line of GameMastery Modules was also a recent addition, and Nick\
  \ Logue’s “Crown of the Kobold King” was being played delve-style in the booth using\
  \ Dwarven Forge terrain. It was super impressive!</p> \n   <p>Gen Con 2007 was also\
  \ exciting for our Titanic Games board game line. We’d already released our first\
  \ board game, <i>Kill Doctor Lucky</i>, and at this show, we were debuting Stonehenge,\
  \ a board game that I thought could change the way folks looked at games. Stonehenge\
  \ consisted of a board, cards, and other pieces that were designed as a flexible\
  \ toolkit that budding game designers could use to create their own board games,\
  \ sold in a package with rules for five different Stonehenge games from the world’\
  s best game designers. Our booth was abuzz with constant demos of both <i>Kill Doctor\
  \ Lucky</i> and Stonehenge, with game designers Richard Garfield, Mike Selinker,\
  \ and James Ernest stopping by the booth to show off their games.</p> \n   <p>A\
  \ personal memory from 2007 was having Gary Gygax in our booth to sign autographs.\
  \ We had just released Gary’s <i>The Anubis Murders</i> novel in our Planet Stories\
  \ line, and the father of RPGs took the time to interact with our fans and sign\
  \ their books. I’d first met Gary way back at my first Gen Con, when I was a fan\
  \ myself, and we had become friends through the years. I am honored that Paizo was\
  \ part of his last Gen Con.</p> \n   <p>The Pathfinder campaign setting saw its\
  \ release at Gen Con 2008 with our 256-page hardcover book. For the previous year,\
  \ fans of our modules and Adventure Paths had been clamoring for us to flesh out\
  \ the world of Golarion, and this book was our answer. We ended up selling out of\
  \ our Gen Con allocation on Saturday and having to turn away potential buyers the\
  \ rest of the weekend. Another big Gen Con success for us was the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Beta</i>. This softcover printing of our Beta playtest rules was something\
  \ we weren’t 100% sure people would want to buy, but since we wanted to get folks\
  \ excited about next year’s release <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>, we brought\
  \ a lot of copies of the Beta along, figuring we could always ship the extras back\
  \ home after the convention was done. Little did we know that they would be gone\
  \ by the end of the second day! The response was incredibly uplifting. The weekend\
  \ culminated with Paizo winning our first gold ENnie for Best Publisher, a true\
  \ honor, along with six other golds and a silver. </p> \n   <p>Gen Con 2008 was\
  \ also memorable for the launch of our Pathfinder Society Organized Play program.\
  \ Season 0 was our playtest season, and our smallish room was packed with gamers\
  \ from the start of the con to the finish. Four hundred characters were made and\
  \ six hundred registration cards handed out. Kicking off each new Pathfinder Society\
  \ season at Gen Con is now a PFS tradition.</p> \n   <p>Of course, at Gen Con 2009,\
  \ the Pathfinder RPG launch took center stage. The night before the show started,\
  \ Paizo had our first contributor party for staff, freelancers and top Pathfinder\
  \ Society GMs. It was the first opportunity any of them had to see the <i>Core Rulebook</i>,\
  \ and I remember watching proudly as they devoured each page.</p> \n   <p>We again\
  \ built a huge pile of the books in the middle of our booth, reminiscent of 2005’\
  s Shackled City tower. But this time, selling out was a real possibility: the first\
  \ print run of the <i>Core Rulebook</i> had sold out before the show even began,\
  \ and as news circulated that Gen Con might be the only place customers might be\
  \ able to buy the book for months, a large crowd of folks gathered outside the dealer\
  \ hall, waiting to rush in to buy it. When the doors opened, our booth was inundated\
  \ by hundreds upon hundreds of gamers hungry to grab a copy. The line soon spread\
  \ into the artist area across the way, and we had to marshal every employee available\
  \ to keep it from devolving into chaos. Erik and I quickly hatched a plan—I grabbed\
  \ a box of books and headed down the line, offering people who just wanted the rulebook\
  \ the ability to quickly hand over some cash and get out of line. Hundreds took\
  \ us up on this offer, and we were able to get the line under control by the end\
  \ of the first day. </p> \n   <p>2009 will also be memorable for me because of the\
  \ start of our relationship with Reaper Miniatures. We’d worked out a licensing\
  \ deal with them a month or so earlier, but imagine my surprise when they showed\
  \ up at the convention with greens of the first minis to show off! Even cooler,\
  \ they had sculptors actually working on new sculpts during the convention. I think\
  \ I spent as much time in the Reaper booth as I did in the Paizo booth that year,\
  \ constantly checking to see if the sculptors had completed new figures.</p> \n\
  \   <p>We’re really proud of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, but it’s nevertheless very\
  \ much a revision of what had come before. In 2010, we were able to offer something\
  \ uniquely our own in the form of the <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i>. Jason had\
  \ conceived of the APG at the previous Gen Con, and we were all super anxious to\
  \ see what everybody thought of our new classes and new ideas such as the archetype\
  \ mechanic. We needn’t have worried; the APG was the hot selling book of Gen Con,\
  \ with hundreds and hundreds of copies sold over the course of the show. We also\
  \ launched our Pathfinder Tales fiction line that Gen Con, and author Dave Gross\
  \ spent his time at the booth autographing copies for eager fans. We proudly won\
  \ our second gold ENnie for Best Publisher, part of a grand total of 11 golds and\
  \ two silvers! Wow!</p> \n   <p>2011 was all about the Ultimates at our booth. <i>Ultimate\
  \ Magic</i> and <i>Ultimate Combat</i> both made a splash at the convention, as\
  \ well as the kickoff of our Jade Regent Adventure Path—the first time that an AP\
  \ travelled outside the bounds of the Inner Sea. But what had me super excited was\
  \ the unveiling of the Pathfinder Battles line, our new prepainted plastic miniatures\
  \ partnership with WizKids. We had paint masters of Valeros, Seoni, Kyra and Merisiel\
  \ at the booth for all to see, as well as an unpainted prototype of the black dragon\
  \ incentive mini for the first set, Heroes and Monsters. At the ENnies, we brought\
  \ home the gold for Best Publisher yet again, a truly mind-blowing feat, along with\
  \ seven other gold ENnies.</p> \n   <p>Gen Con 2012 is just a month from now and\
  \ my mind is racing. How will everyone like <i>Ultimate Equipment</i>? Will we have\
  \ enough plush goblins to last the weekend? Even with our Pathfinder Society room\
  \ almost three times as large as last year, will it be enough? I can’t wait to see\
  \ people playing games with our Pathfinder Pawns for the first time. Oh—and wait\
  \ until everyone sees WizKids’ Rise of the Runelords minis set for the first time\
  \ in person—people are going to freak! It’s going to be great watching folks playtest\
  \ the new Pathfinder Adventure Card Game for the first time at Gen Con. And this\
  \ will be the first year that Goblinworks will be at the con, showing off some of\
  \ our early visuals for Pathfinder Online. We’ll also have the first issue of the\
  \ Pathfinder comic book at our booth, complete with a unique Gen Con variant cover!\
  \ And we’re returning to Varisia in Shattered Star, the first-ever Adventure Path\
  \ sequel. There’s so much going on I can’t even think of it all! But I do know that\
  \ I’ll have another year of memories from the Best Four Days in Gaming!</p> \n \
