  \ of the Adventurer's Guide</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, May 4, 2017</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>So I just finished the final <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljqu?Mythological-Monsters-of-Bestiary-6\"\
  ><em>Bestiary 6</em> preview blog</a> last week, so you know what that means! Yup…\
  \ time to start doing preview blogs for the next hardcover down the line—the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide\"><em>Adventurer's\
  \ Guide</em></a>!</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As opposed to the hardcovers\
  \ before (<a href=\"/products/btpy9r1y?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6\"\
  ><em>Bestiary 6</em></a>) and after (<a href=\"/products/btpy9s2f?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned-Hardcover\"\
  ><em>Book of the Damned</em></a>), the <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide\"\
  ><em>Adventurer's Guide</em></a> is very much a product for players. The central\
  \ idea of this book is to focus on several of the more famous (or infamous) organizations\
  \ active in the Inner Sea region of Golarion. This book is not intended to present\
  \ these organizations as things your characters can join (we've covered that topic\
  \ before in numerous ways, after all) but instead to use these groups as themes\
  \ for the presentation of new archetypes, prestige classes, magic items, spells,\
  \ feats, and other player options for your characters to take. In effect, these\
  \ groups serve as your characters' adventuring guides, in that once you become affiliated\
  \ with them, they can guide your character into new specializations, talents, and\
  \ powers.</p> \n    <p>We'll have more to say about the new options in the book\
  \ later, of course. For now, though, I wanted to take the opportunity to reveal\
  \ the full list of organizations that are featured in this volume. Some of them\
  \ are long-standing groups in the setting we've done a lot with before, while others\
  \ are relatively new. Many of them had their genesis in various Adventure Paths\
  \ as well, and you can use the additional information in <em>Adventurer's Guide</em>\
  \ either to bolster their associated Adventure Path in your game or to expand the\
  \ organization's role beyond that Adventure Path. This does mean that <em>Adventurer's\
  \ Guide</em> blurs the line between the traditionally \"world-neutral\" hardcover\
  \ rulebooks and the setting books—but that's intentional, since this allows us to\
  \ draw upon over a decade of lore and inspiration to give additional weight to all\
  \ these new options for the game. And of course, if you're a GM, these options work\
  \ just as well for you in building memorable new NPCs for your game as well!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In any event, the organizations covered in Adventurer's Guide are...</p>\
  \ \n    <ul>\n     <li>Al-Zabriti (Deep-Desert Traditionalists)</li> \n     <li>Aldori\
  \ Swordlords (Masters of the Clash of Blades)</li> \n     <li>Aspis Consortium (Profiteering\
  \ Syndicate)</li> \n     <li>Bellflower Network (Eradicators of Halfling Slavery)</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Council of Thieves (Rulers of a Criminal Underworld)</li> \n     <li>Cyphermages\
  \ (Inheritors of Ancient Arcane Traditions)</li> \n     <li>Eagle Knights (Vanguard\
  \ of Liberty)</li> \n     <li>Gray Maidens (Remnants of a Tyrant's Reign)</li> \n\
  \     <li>Hellknights (Merciless Enforcers of the Law)</li> \n     <li>Houses of\
  \ Perfection (Trio of Elite Mystical Monasteries inspired by the Elements)</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Lantern Bearers (A Light Against the Coming Darkness)</li> \n     <li>Magaambya\
  \ (Inheritors of an Ancient Academy of Arcane Learning)</li> \n     <li>Mammoth\
  \ Lords (Beast-Riding Barbarian Tribes)</li> \n     <li>Pathfinder Society (Adventuring\
  \ Scholars of Historical Lore)</li> \n     <li>Red Mantis (Notorious Cult of Deadly\
  \ Assassins)</li> \n     <li>Rivethun (Animists Harnessing Personal Struggles for\
  \ Spiritual Growth)</li> \n     <li>Silver Ravens (Rebels Against an Oppressive\
  \ Regime)</li> \n     <li>Storm Kindlers (Storm-Seeking Devotees of Gozreh)</li>\
  \ \n    </ul> \n    <p>Each organization opens with an evocative half-page illustration\
  \ to set the mood. I've only got room to show off three for now, though!</p> \n\
