  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">This was, Navasi\
  \ decided, the third worst date she’d ever been on.</p>\n      <p>It wasn’t her\
  \ datemate’s fault this time, though; things had been going pretty well with Pakelia\
  \ considering they’d met on Shelyn’s Boudoir. Navasi wasn’t usually one for dating\
  \ apps, but she’d been recommended that one by <em>Quig</em>, of all people. Probably\
  \ he was just sick of hearing her complain about her disaster of a love life.</p>\n\
  \      <p>So she’d nabbed a reservation at Angelfish, Absalom Station’s hottest\
  \ new seafood restaurant, and to her surprise, Pakelia turned out to be a real person,\
  \ not a scambot—and a charming one at that. They’d already moved past small talk\
  \ by the time their server brought them their menus.</p>\n      <p>Then everything\
  \ went to hell.</p>\n      <p>As another explosion rattled the chandeliers, Navasi\
  \ tugged Pakelia further into the cover of their overturned table. The verthani\
  \ woman’s shoulders were a taut line, soot staining the green silk of her dress;\
  \ her gaze darted around, seeking an exit. They’d been seated in the back corner,\
  \ and the attackers were between them and the panicked crowd of diners and staff\
  \ fleeing out the front door.</p>\n      <p>Navasi glared at the menu lying on the\
  \ floor by their broken cocktail glasses, its scrolling display of the day’s specials\
  \ replaced by a sigil of a cat’s paw clutching a scimitar. She knew that sigil.\
  \ And if Trace was here, it wasn’t because she’d lucked into a table.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>As the dust cleared, she heard, “<em>Navasiiiii</em>!” echo from the extemporary\
  \ exit Trace’s grenade had blown in the wall, and any hope she’d had of Pakelia\
  \ <em>not</em> identifying her as the target of this chaos evaporated. She glanced\
  \ over but couldn’t read any emotion in Pakelia’s ink-black eyes.</p>\n      <p>A\
  \ hail of electrical bolts singed holes in the wall behind them. That was definitely\
  \ Trace’s first mate, Arvann. Navasi muttered a word that would have made her childhood\
  \ etiquette tutor revoke her vidgame privileges for a week and fished her laser\
  \ pistol out of the thigh holster strapped under her skirt.</p>\n      <p>“They’\
  re after you?” Pakelia asked, glancing briefly at the gun, then away. Navasi sighed,\
  \ cursing Trace’s timing. Her lifestyle could be risky, and Pakelia was an accountant,\
  \ for Besmara’s sake. An accountant she’d inadvertently dropped into a firefight.<em>\
  \ Oh, I am <strong>so </strong>not getting a second date</em>.</p>\n      <p>“Yeah,”\
  \ she said. “Sorry. It’s… complicated.”</p>\n      <p>“A soap opera plot is complicated,”\
  \ Pakelia said. “This is what I’d call a <em>problem</em>.” She peeked over the\
  \ table. “They’ve got all the exits covered.”</p>\n      <p>Was it her imagination,\
  \ or had Pakelia’s posture <em>relaxed</em>?</p>\n      <p>“Navasi!” Trace’s voice\
  \ rang out. “Get out here before I ventilate this ceiling!”</p>\n      <p>“Because\
  \ you’ve done the décor so many favors already,” Navasi retorted. <em>Disproportionate\
  \ </em>was the key word for Trace’s reactions to pretty much anything. She’d found\
  \ it intoxicating, once, before she’d gotten tired of feeling like a moth crisping\
  \ itself on a flame. She scanned the restaurant for options. Trace’s tendency to\
  \ bombard first and ask questions later had worked to their advantage in one way,\
  \ at least; there were plenty of broken chairs and tables to use as cover, and luckily,\
  \ everyone else seemed to have escaped already.</p>\n      <p>“Dare I ask?” Pakelia\
  \ murmured in her ear. The scent of her perfume, floral and subtly sweet, cut through\
  \ the acrid tang of electricity, and Navasi spared a moment of wistfulness for lost\
  \ opportunities.</p>\n      <p>“Don’t date a Free Captain,” she answered. “And if\
  \ you <em>do</em> date a Free Captain and then break up with them, don’t take a\
  \ protection job on her route and foil a score she’s been planning for months.”\
  </p>\n      <p>“Might I suggest,” Pakelia mused, “that perhaps you shouldn’t have\
  \ let her know who did it?”</p>\n      <p>“My ship’s pretty distinctive,” Navasi\
  \ said, wondering if she was imagining the hint of amusement dancing on the edges\
  \ of Pakelia’s voice. She tilted her head at the panorama windows on the other side\
  \ of the restaurant, which provided a beautiful view of Jatembe Park below. “Okay.\
  \ See those windows?” The table shielding them disintegrated, another grenade boom\
  \ echoing through the air. Navasi grabbed Pakelia’s arm and yanked her away from\
  \ the wreckage. The two scrabbled toward the next overturned table.</p>\n      <p>“\
  They’re our exit,” Navasi finished, brushing splinters off her dress. The purple\
  \ satin was shredded and stained, probably beyond nonmagical repair. “Damn it, Trace!”\
  \ she yelled over the table. “This dress was expensive!”</p>\n      <p>“I like your\
  \ blue one better!” Trace called back. “What happened to the blue one?”</p>\n  \
  \    <p>Navasi contemplated taking a deep breath and counting to ten. Instead, she\
  \ popped up long enough to fire a few warning shots.</p>\n      <p>“You borrowed\
  \ it,” she shouted, in between laser blasts, “and spilled nitro fuel on it. Remember?”\
  </p>\n      <p>“Is that why you broke up?” Pakelia asked.</p>\n      <p>“No,” Navasi\
  \ admitted, “but it should have been. Would have saved me some time and trouble.”\
  \ Trace’s response to that was another grenade. Navasi hissed in surprise as Pakelia\
  \ slid an arm around her shoulders and swept her along to new cover as their second\
  \ table met the same splintery fate as the first.</p>\n      <p>“Is she trying to\
  \ kill you?” Pakelia asked. As they ducked behind table number three, her knee only\
  \ narrowly avoided skidding across the remains of someone’s mango shrimp. The question\
  \ wasn’t incredulous, but neutral, a mere clarification of fact stated in the exact\
  \ same tone she’d used to ask their server whether the Castrovelian glowfish sauté\
  \ had nuts in it. She was handling this better than Navasi would have expected.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Probably not,” she said. Trace had a temper, but she wasn’t <em>that</em>\
  \ extreme. “If I had to guess, I’d say she just wants to knock us out, steal all\
  \ our valuables, and call it even.”</p>\n      <p>“Well,” Pakelia said. “I’m fond\
  \ of this necklace—and also my skull—so I’d prefer to avoid that.” She inclined\
  \ her head toward the far wall. “Making a break for the windows it is. I assume\
  \ you’ve accounted for the main problem?”</p>\n      <p>“That we’re five stories\
  \ up?”</p>\n      <p>“That’s the one.”</p>\n      <p>“Did you see that tattooed\
  \ vesk guy out there?”</p>\n      <p>“I tend to notice people blasting arc emitters\
  \ at me, yes.”</p>\n      <p>“He’s got an autograppler on his belt.”</p>\n     \
  \ <p>“You want us to fight past your angry ex and her crew, snatch an autograppler\
  \ off one of them, and then dive out of a five-story window?” Pakelia asked.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Pakelia,” Navasi began, her stomach sinking. “I’m sorry I—” She wasn’\
  t sure how she planned to end the sentence—<em>ruined our date? have a chaos gremlin\
  \ of an ex? am totally cursed when it comes to relationships?</em>—but before she\
  \ could try, Pakelia grinned.</p>\n      <p>“Sounds fun,” she said, giving Navasi\
  \ a wink. “I’ll cover you.”</p>\n      <p><em>With<strong> what</strong></em>? Navasi\
  \ opened her mouth to say, when Pakelia made a graceful motion, her forearm unfolding\
  \ to reveal a pistol. She decided to file her many questions away for when they\
  \ weren’t under attack. <em>Time to go</em>. She stood, pointing at Arvann. “Get\
  \ him!” she called, aiming a laser blast at his arm to punctuate her directive.\
  \ She didn’t want to kill any of them, but Arvann was sturdy; he could take a few\
  \ hits.</p>\n      <p>Pakelia sidled around the table, shooting off covering fire\
  \ as Navasi made a dash for the overturned chair closest to the window. Trace’s\
  \ vertical pupils were narrowed and her fur bristling, her ears pinned back against\
  \ the top of her head. <em>Oh yeah, she’s mad</em>.</p>\n      <p>“You got in my\
  \ way!” Trace hissed. “That score was supposed to set us up for years.”</p>\n  \
  \    <p>“I just took a job!” Navasi said. “How was I supposed to know <em>you</em>\
  \ were the one after that ship?”</p>\n      <p>“Like it would have changed anything\
  \ if you’d known!” Trace lobbed another grenade, but this time Navasi dodged out\
  \ of the way, nearly tripping on the silverware scattered across the floor.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“So what if it didn’t?” Navasi demanded. “You don’t get immunity just\
  \ because we used to date!”</p>\n      <p>“I’ll keep that in mind should I decide\
  \ to get up to anything nefarious!” Pakelia called, executing an impeccable tuck\
  \ and roll to the table on Navasi’s other side. Her shots stayed perfectly steady\
  \ throughout the entire maneuver.</p>\n      <p>“<em>And</em>,” Trace snarled, her\
  \ pupils retracting to a line, “you still have my favorite Strawberry Machine Cake\
  \ t-shirt!”</p>\n      <p>“<em>Seriously</em>? That’s why you’re blowing up the\
  \ restaurant?”</p>\n      <p>Giving up on reasoning with Trace, Navasi made a dash\
  \ toward Arvann. She only got halfway there before Trace’s gyrojet pistol unleashed\
  \ a rocket, slamming her into the wall. Her dazed mind registered the incongruous\
  \ view in the security cams—the restaurant’s mural of an angel holding a platter\
  \ of fried calamari overlain by her in her ruined dress, two elegantly painted wings\
  \ extending outward behind her—before she fell to the ground. She shook her head\
  \ unsteadily, then looked up in time to see Arvann raise his arc emitter again.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Watch out!” she called to Pakelia, but it was too late; his shot struck\
  \ her in the leg. Pakelia stumbled, muttering a curse in Vercite under her breath.</p>\n\

  \ Emanuel Pantaleon:</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p><em>Oh, that is <strong>it</strong>.</em>\
  \ “Leave! My! Date! Alone!” Navasi snapped, scrambling to her feet. She grabbed\
  \ Pakelia’s wrist, towing her along. Still clumsy from the electrical blast, Pakelia\
  \ faltered, her ankle turning under her next step.</p>\n      <p>“Hey,” Navasi said,\
  \ deciding that getting out of here overrode any concerns about being affectionate\
  \ during a first (calamitous) date. “He barely grazed you.”</p>\n      <p>As they\
  \ ran toward Arvann, she kissed Pakelia on the cheek. The effect was immediate:\
  \ Pakelia’s gait quickened, the burns on her leg somehow no longer hindering her.\
  \ This time, Trace’s shot whizzed past them, obliterating an unfortunate potted\
  \ plant in the corner. Arvann steadied his stance as they neared him, no doubt expecting\
  \ Navasi to try to bowl him over—</p>\n      <p>She let go of Pakelia, but she’\
  d needn’t have; her date backflipped right along with her. She snagged the autograppler\
  \ as Pakelia grabbed one of the overturned chairs and flung it through the window\
  \ glass. In unison, they swan-dived, Navasi shooting the grappler at the exterior\
  \ wall and grabbing Pakelia around the waist in one smooth motion.</p>\n      <p>“\
  <em>Navasi</em>!” she heard Trace snarl. “You’ll regret this!”</p>\n      <p>“I’\
  ll mail you your shirt!”</p>\n      <p>The wind rushed past as they dropped, the\
  \ lights from the surrounding buildings blurring to streaks around them. As soon\
  \ as the two hit the ground, they both collapsed, sprawling onto the grass. The\
  \ ceiling’s vid display of a night sky twinkled peacefully above them, in marked\
  \ contrast with the clusters of bedraggled restaurant patrons and staff gathered\
  \ on the lawn, patching up minor injuries and calling the Stewards on their comms.\
  \ In the distance, approaching sirens wailed closer. Navasi knew Trace and her crew\
  \ would be long gone before they arrived; wiggling out of trouble was what she did\
  \ best.</p>\n      <p>Navasi took a deep breath, the adrenaline rush fading from\
  \ her veins. Replacing it was the sense of warmth radiating from Pakelia beside\
  \ her…and the newfound certainty that her date was no ordinary accountant. “So,”\
  \ she said. “Do I get to know why you’ve got a hideaway limb with a gun in it?”\
  </p>\n      <p>Pakelia smiled. “I think that’s more of a second date conversation,\
  \ don’t you?”</p>\n      <p><em>Second</em>—?</p>\n      <p>Relief swept through\
  \ her. Maybe Trace hadn’t ruined everything. Maybe Navasi had found someone who\
  \ wouldn’t cut and run at the first sign of trouble.</p>\n      <p>And maybe this\
  \ date was one of her better ones after all.</p>\n      <p>“Since seafood’s off\
  \ the menu,” Navasi said, sliding her hand closer so their little fingers brushed,\
  \ “I know this great noodle place in Sparks…”</p>\n      <br>\n      <center>\n\
