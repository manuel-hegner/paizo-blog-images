  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <h1>Rob the Dragon's Trove, Week 4</h1> \n    <p class=\"\
  date\">Thursday, June 21, 2007</p> \n    <p>The Riddling Dragon's hoard has been\
  \ plundered three times now, and he grows restless. Soon he might wake. Not surprisingly,\
  \ his riddles have grown incredibly difficult. <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiu\"\
  >Dragon's Trove</a></i>—the next set in the GameMastery Item Card line—is due to\
  \ release soon, and in anticipation we are showing off the set and giving you a\
  \ chance to score a free deck of cards.</p> \n    <p>The Riddling Dragon has asked\
  \ one question each week, and this is the last. Answer it correctly and get entered\
  \ into a drawing to win a free deck of <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiu\">Dragon's\
  \ Trove</a></i> <a href=\"/gameMastery/itemPacks\">Item Cards</a>, shipped to you\
  \ when the set releases. Answer incorrectly and your entry will be burned to a crisp.\
  \ Just send an email with your answer, your name, and your paizo.com screen name\
  \ to <a href=\"mailto:contest@paizo.com?subject=Dragon%27s%20Trove%20Contest%204\"\
  >contest@paizo.com</a>. Make sure to put the phrase \"Dragon's Trove Contest 4\"\
  \ in the subject line of the email.</p> \n    <p>Last week, I mentioned that I would\
  \ show off some cards everyone has been waiting for. What I meant was that I would\
  \ show of some items that have been near the top of the list of items not yet represented.\
  \ Adding the 110 cards from <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiu\">Dragon's Trove</a></i>,\
  \ there are now about 400 unique cards in the Item Card line. Some of the items\
  \ in this set, such as the glaive, goggles, hat, and kukri, have been a long time\
  \ in the coming and frequently asked for by fans. Next week, we'll announce the\
  \ last winner and post a complete set list.</p> \n    <p><b>Week 4 Riddle:</b> Assuming\
  \ you started your journey in Urglin and went south, you would run into a river.\
  \ By boat, you might travel down this river, making your way down a steep drop before\
  \ proceeding on through a large lake. After the lake, you might head down the same\
  \ river for almost 100 miles before venturing north by boat to continue through\
  \ another body of water. On the north edge of this lake is a small town. If a wyvern\
  \ flies at an ordinary pace directly between Urglin and this town, how many hours\
  \ will it take to make this journey? </p> \n    <p>Here is a hint: The answer can\
  \ be found in one of our blog posts and in your 3rd grade math book. All answers\
  \ for the Week 4 riddle are due by 12:01 PM Pacific Standard Time on Thursday, June\
  \ 28th. Good Luck!</p> \n    <p><b>Week 3 Winner:</b> Congratulations to Todd Johnston,\
  \ who correctly answered the Riddling Dragon's question with \"7\" and scored a\
  \ free deck of <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiu\">Dragon's Trove</a></i>.</p> \n\
