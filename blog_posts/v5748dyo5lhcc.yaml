  articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">We're just about ready to\
  \ release the <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> schedule, hopefully early-mid next\
  \ week, and I've been getting super excited reading all the fantastic event descriptions\
  \ as I've been working them into the schedule. While the full schedule isn't quite\
  \ ready to be released yet, I thought you might like a sneak peek at some of the\
  \ fantastic programming planned for PaizoCon 2015.</span></p> \n     <p>In addition\
  \ to over 30 tables of Pathfinder Society and Adventure Card Game per session we\
  \ have a ton of Paizo Staff, 3rd Party Publishers and other community members running\
  \ games, seminars and workshops. Some are PaizoCon classics like \"Secrets of Golarion\"\
  , \"Horror in RPGs\", \"The Whaler's Bluff Project\" run by James Jacobs and \"\
  Kings of Absalom\" run by Erik Mona. And some are new offerings like \"Last Character\
  \ Standing Gong Show!\", \"Crayon of Vecna\", \"Goblins and Dinosaurs\" run by Crystal\
  \ Frasier, and \"PaizoCon Apocalypse\" run by Jason Bulmahn.</p> \n     <p>Here's\
  \ a look at what's in store!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>\"Secrets of\
  \ Golarion\"</b><br> Discover what's going on in the wide world of Pathfinder's\
  \ official campaign setting, and participate in a Q&amp;A with the people who create\
  \ the mysteries of Golarion!</p> \n      <p><b>\"Horror in RPGs\"</b><br> Join some\
  \ of Pathfinder's most macabre authors as they once again offer their game mastering\
  \ secrets and terror tips to help you turn your roleplaying game into an experience\
  \ sure to leave your players shaking.</p> \n      <p><b>\"The Whaler's Bluff Project\"\
  </b><br> Thorne House has long stood on the cliff above the tiny town of Whaler's\
  \ Bluff, where its history of hauntings became a local legend before culminating\
  \ decades ago in a sensational confrontation between a strange cult and the police.\
  \ Today, Whaler's Bluff is itself practically a ghost town, its citizens withdrawn\
  \ and private, largely uninterested in the outside world. But when eager young filmmaker\
  \ Ryan Wallace goes missing in Whaler's Bluff, the outside world takes notice. Did\
  \ he really just run off with his investors' money, or did he actually spend the\
  \ night in Thorn House, only to fall victim to foul play? Does any of his footage\
  \ survive? This Call of Cthulhu adventure is set in the modern day, where YOU play\
  \ the role of investigators sent to unravel the strange mystery of Thorne House!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>\"Kings of Absalom: Fall's End\"</b><br> Deep below the city of\
  \ Absalom, a rag-tag group of escaped slaves arrives in the cutthroat underground\
  \ settlement of Fall's End, where the scum of the Darklands boils up to meet the\
  \ desperate drippings of the world above. Their packs laden with treasures, the\
  \ heroes must fight to survive and find a way to the surface in this freeform open\
  \ world exploration. Bring your own 4th-level character and a painted miniature.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>\"Last Character Standing Gong Show!\"</b><br> Put the stat blocks\
  \ aside and tell us in your own words why your character is the best! See how long\
  \ you can last before our panel of evil judges, and compete for the grand prize.\
  \ Everyone who participates in this fun, open-entry competition will receive a prize!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>\"Crayon of Vecna\"</b><br> Come spend a couple of hours drawing\
  \ with Liz Courts of Paizo, and Lj Stephens of Rogue Genius Games. All skill levels\
  \ welcome. Live cosplay models will be available in various genres. Door prizes\
  \ and some art supplies provided. Artists, cosplayers, photographers*, even just\
  \ the curious, are all welcome! (*photographers, please bring model release forms\
  \ if you wish to use your photos for commercial purposes, thank you).</p> \n   \
  \   <p><b>\"Goblins and Dinosaurs\"</b><br> Goblins are attacking Sandpoint, and\
  \ they're done playing nice! Where did they find dinosaurs? How did they get lasers?\
  \ Can the heroes of Sandpoint stop their Birdcruncher tribe before they turn time\
  \ itself into the biggest pickle of them all?</p> \n      <p><b>\"PaizoCon Apocalypse\"\
  </b><br> It's a usual evening at PaizoCon. Everyone playing Pathfinder, hanging\
  \ out with staff and other guests. Wait, did somebody just get bit? Why are there\
  \ people shambling through the halls... This event will be played using the End\
  \ of the World game system.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>PaizoCon isn't all\
  \ about Paizo though, it's about the tabletop roleplaying community; making new\
  \ connections, discussing new ideas, and reminiscing with old friends. In addition\
  \ to Paizo staff, you'll be throwing dice and attending seminars with representatives\
  \ from the industry (Obsidian, Kobold Press, Frog God Games, Legendary Games, Lone\
  \ Wolf, Reaper, Jon Brazer Enterprises and Necromancers of the Northwest to name\
  \ a few). In support of this portion of the community, we will again have Executive\
  \ Editor James Sutter and Senior Editor Chris Carey hosting manuscript workshops.\
  \ We'll be expanding our 3rd Party Publishers Workshop run by Community Manager\
  \ Liz Courts to include Developer Owen K.C. Stephens and Accountant Ashley Kaprielian.\
  \ For 2015 we've also put formal Portfolio Reviews with our Art department on the\
  \ schedule, so if you've been wanting some professional constructive criticism of\
  \ your artwork, you'll be able to meet with Managing Art Director Sarah Robinson,\
  \ along with Senior Art Director Andrew Vallas, Art Director Sonja Morris, or Graphic\
  \ Designer Emily Crowell.</p> \n     <p>I've been having a great time reviewing\
  \ all the events going on the schedule and I'm looking forward to showing off the\
  \ rest of the events! We have more than we've ever had on the docket before and\
  \ I am so excited to see everyone at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> in just\
  \ 42 short days!</p> \n     <p>Sara Marie<br> <i>Customer Service Manager</i></p>\
