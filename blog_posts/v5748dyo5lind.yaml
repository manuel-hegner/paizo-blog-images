  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Almost thirteen years have passed since my last\
  \ trip to Las Vegas, and those memories focus on spending time at the Excalibur,\
  \ playing the carnival games with my husband and son. March saw my return to the\
  \ City of Lights. This time, I traveled the north Strip, with my days full of retailer\
  \ presentations and working the Paizo booth at the GAMA Trade Show. Hail and well\
  \ met to all the retailers I met! For those I didn't get the change to meet, drop\
  \ me a line at <a href=\"mailto:pfsretailers@paizo.com\">pfsretailers@paizo.com</a>\
  \ if you have questions or comments about Pathfinder Society. Each evening offered\
  \ opportunities to eat in some fine restaurants and chat with business partners\
  \ and other attendees. I explored some gorgeous buildings, taking in the opulence\
  \ and extravagance. The trip ended all too soon, but I wasn't filled with post-convention\
  \ blues, as I traveled on to Florida for some vacation time with my family. I enjoyed\
  \ myself and recharged my batteries in preparation for convention season.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Now that I'm back in the Paizo offices I'm busy at work on a myriad of tasks.\
  \ The biggest ones involves pulling the edges together on Pathfinder Society projects\
  \ for the upcoming convention season. John, Linda, Tanis, and I are spending quite\
  \ a bit of time focused on PFS activities for the next few months. That and planning\
  \ out the new Roleplaying Guild season and some new programs for ACG take up a lot\
  \ of our time. If you want a sneak peak of our efforts, check out John and I on\
  \ the Know Direction podcast this Wednesday, April 6th, at 5:30 Pacific.</p> \n\
  \    <p>While I've organized many conventions over my three years as Venture-Officer,\
  \ now I'm learning how to juggle multiple shows at one time. At this time, the PaizoCon\
  \ volunteer roster is complete, with the exception of cancellations. Speaking of\
  \ cancellations, several Gen Con volunteer spaces opened up. I will be reviewing\
  \ the signups and contacting peoples this week. I thank everyone for their patience\
  \ as I work through the herculean task of setting up our biggest conventions. Ya\
  \ think you know what goes on behind the scenes until you get there and find out\
  \ you only saw the tip of the iceberg.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of travel and conventions.\
  \ My schedule for the next few months includes attendance at:</p> \n    <ul>\n \
  \    <li>Emerald City Comic Con—April 8-10</li> \n     <li>Quad Cities Gaming Convention—\
  April 30-May 1</li> \n     <li>PaizoCon—May 27-30</li> \n     <li>Origins—June 15-19</li>\
  \ \n     <li>PaizoCon UK—July 22-24</li> \n     <li>Gen Con—August 4-7</li> \n \
  \    <li>PAX—September 2-5</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>But conventions are just one\
  \ part of the job. Another large component involves volunteer oversight. My inbox\
  \ overfloweth with new applications. Awesome news, so many volunteers expressing\
  \ eagerness at organizing PFS activities. One of my goals for this week: activate\
  \ status on all received applications. Will check in next Monday on reaching my\
  \ goal.</p> \n    <p>Speaking (writing?) of volunteers. Over the past month, two\
  \ GMs earned their five-star status. Jim Hazel and Landon Hatfield both ran their\
  \ 150th game in March. We also identified a GM, Josh McIllwain, who qualified for\
  \ his fifth star in July, but hadn't been announced. Please take a moment to congratulate\
  \ our excellent GMs who achieved this recognition.</p> \n    <p>Some parting thoughts\
  \ as we head into convention season: As a game system, Pathfinder embraces everyone,\
  \ and so too does the Pathfinder Society. As you travel to conventions or meet up\
  \ at your local game store, remember to treat each other with respect and understanding.\
  \ We are a friendly and welcoming community of gamers—if you feel that another person\
  \ at the table or event is acting against the spirit of the campaign, please contact\
  \ your local Venture-Officer, who will bring it up the chain to where it can be\
  \ resolved. Conversely, my door is always open!</p> \n    <p>Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>\
