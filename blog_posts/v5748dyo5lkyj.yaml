  >\"Doppelschwert\"</a> Silvestri tackles the latest Homebrew Special challenge with\
  \ his new Pathfinder Adventure Card Gamecampaign: Emerald Legacy. He totally had\
  \ me at \"Sharkomancer.\"—Mike</i></p> \n     <p>Now that <a href=\"/products/btpy9vmz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Combat-AddOn-Deck\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a> and <i><a href=\"/products/btpy9x03?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Equipment-AddOn-Deck\"\
  >Ultimate Equipment</a></i> are out, so Hayato and Reiko are available as playable\
  \ characters, I'm finally ready to proudly present my latest longtime project: Emerald\
  \ Legacy, a new homebrew Adventure Path for <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/adventures/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a>!</p> \n     <p>Before we get into specifics, let's start\
  \ with a short rundown of the setting. In the prologue, you start in Absalom and\
  \ are hired as mercenaries by the Tian noble Hiro Yamashi to join his expedition\
  \ to the Shackles, where his brother Masao has fled after stealing a family heirloom.\
  \ In order to get the heirloom back, you'll chase Masao and his henchmen through\
  \ several exotic locations, discovering his plans along the way. Once you find out\
  \ what he's up to, will you be able to stop him in time? I certainly hope so!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When I started this project, I first looked back on all the experience\
  \ I gathered while working on my first homebrew AP <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk5g?Homebrew-Special-Revenge-of-the-Wicked\"\
  >Revenge of the Wicked</a>. While I'm very happy with how RotW turned out, I have\
  \ to admit that setting up the box is rather complicated, so I wanted to improve\
  \ on this aspect in Emerald Legacy. At the same time, I wanted to change a lot of\
  \ things to give the set my own spin and try out some new ideas.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ one thing from RotW I was absolutely sure that I wanted to keep was the great\
  \ appearance of the cards made by Ludwig Orsingher, and so I asked him to help me\
  \ out with this project again. Luckily, he agreed, and he made both the awesome\
  \ logo as well as the great realizations of all the custom cards for Emerald Legacy,\
  \ a contribution for which I want to express my deep gratitude.</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ that said, let's have a look at what Emerald Legacy has in store for you!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Your ship is your upgradeable base of operations.</h2> \n     <p>I\
  \ like it when RPGs give you the option to have your own upgradeable base—a place\
  \ for your heroes to return to between adventures. In the RPG version of Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles, you can earn your own island; it's also a central mechanic in the popular\
  \ Kingmaker AP. For Emerald Legacy, I decided early on that I wanted a base to be\
  \ important both in the narrative as well as mechanically. My solution for this\
  \ was to make the <i>Shirofune</i>, an upgradeable ship that grows alongside you\
  \ during the course of the AP. (You might think that the concept of a floating fortress\
  \ is a fantasy trope, but warships like these were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atakebune\"\
  >actually used in Japan during the 16th and 17th century</a>.)</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n      <br><i><b>Note:</b> The artwork on the Shirofune card above was done\
  \ by myself, and is not covered by the <a href=\"/community/communityuse\">Paizo\
  \ Community Use Policy</a></i>.\n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>My idea was\
  \ to set up the <i>Shirofune</i> much like a character. Instead of skills, though,\
  \ there are ship facilities, which produce cards from an upgrade box you can customize\
  \ yourself with 3 class decks, another AP, or Skull &amp; Shackles itself. This\
  \ allows you to give the set a distinct flavor by adding your favorite expansions.\
  \ (The <i><a href=\"/products/btpy9hvy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Monk-Class-Deck\"\
  >Monk Class Deck</a></i> and the Ultimate Combat and Ultimate Equipment decks make\
  \ excellent candidates for a Tian theme.) From a narrative point of view, your choice\
  \ of upgrade box corresponds to the people that were hired to work on the ship.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And instead of a cards list, there's a list of cargo that you get to\
  \ add as plunder to your ship at the beginning of each scenario! These cards can\
  \ be used as an income for boons, as payment for the cards from the upgrade box,\
  \ or to use the ship card's power (discussed below).</p> \n     <h2>You'll never\
  \ walk alone.</h2> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-HiroYamashi.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <br><i>For once, no one expects you to save the world all by yourself.</i>\n\
  \      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>While your party plays an essential role in\
  \ the story of Emerald Legacy, you're not the only ones working toward your goal\
  \ of stopping Hiro's brother Masao. Important NPCs will regularly help you out as\
  \ cohorts, and when everything else fails, you can resort to calling the Order of\
  \ the Raging Wave to help you out! This seafaring monk order has travelled with\
  \ Hiro from Tian Xia to support him on his quest, and their leader Umiko Sensei\
  \ acts as your mentor during the journey.</p> \n     <p>In exchange for a little\
  \ donation in the form of a plunder card, they will temporarily replace your role\
  \ card, gladly taking care of your problems for you. This role card is the third\
  \ step of turning your ship into a character by having its crew earn power feats.\
  \ Over the course of the AP, you can have them learn all kinds of useful tricks\
  \ to cover the weaknesses of your party. You could very well play through Emerald\
  \ Legacy with 1d4 in Wisdom without the need to despair at the first sight of the\
  \ infamous Siren Caller!</p> \n     <h2><b>You have rivals, and there are sidequests\
  \ connected to them.</b></h2> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-KazetheRuthless.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-KazetheRuthless_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-ElizmaratheBrazen_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <br><i>Instead of pirates vs. ninjas, it will be you vs. pirates AND\
  \ ninjas!</i>\n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>For this AP, I thought it would\
  \ be cool to fight against a rivaling party with opposing goals. While you are fighting\
  \ on Hiro's side, his brother Masao has a band of loyal followers that you will\
  \ meet several times throughout your journey. To keep them fresh and relevant, I\
  \ made them veterans and introduced villain feats, which grant them additional powers\
  \ over time. Since you get to choose those powers, you can start with the least\
  \ disruptive powers for your party, but you will eventually be forced to make what\
  \ I hope to be hard choices. Additionally, each villain has a theme that will influence\
  \ the rules of the scenario they appear in. For example, there is usually a scenario\
  \ rule related to examining cards when Kaze is around. By encountering these villains\
  \ several times, it was possible to flesh them out more, and I didn't need to make\
  \ a huge number of custom cards you would use just once.</p> \n     <p>In Emerald\
  \ Legacy, sidequests are the only way to earn loot cards, and they have minor and\
  \ major consequences for later parts of the AP and the ending of the story! I've\
  \ introduced 2 sidequests for each villain, giving you even more opportunities to\
  \ interact with them.</p> \n     <h2>You'll get into all kind of crazy situations.</h2>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-ShrineofSealing.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <br><i><b>Note:</b> The artwork on the Shrine of Sealing card above\
  \ was done by myself, and is not covered by the <a href=\"/community/communityuse\"\
  >Paizo Community Use Policy</a>.</i>\n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>I'll\
  \ openly admit that when I make my homebrew adventure paths, I often try to incorporate\
  \ my favorite mechanics from the official material, which you can consider as my\
  \ love letter to the game. In particular, Mummy's Mask had a big influence on many\
  \ of Emerald Legacy's cards and scenarios.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n\
  \      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Shen.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Shen_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <br><i>Illustration by Ben Wootten</i>.\n      <p></p>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>However, I also try to come up with new mechanics and ways to make the\
  \ game feel different from what you are used to. Emerald Legacy contains a new type\
  \ of scenario that I like to think of as \"Showdown Scenarios.\" These all use the\
  \ Shrine of Sealing, a location where characters are not allowed to start. No matter\
  \ what you do, the villains will eventually all end up in the Shrine of Sealing,\
  \ and you need to close all other locations before you can win. Assuming you win\
  \ the fight against a villain, it's actually better not to temporarily close any\
  \ locations in these scenarios, which has a major impact on how you can approach\
  \ them.</p> \n     <p>Here's a short list of my favorite 5 features from other Emerald\
  \ Legacy scenarios, in no particular order:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>There is\
  \ a self-proclaimed \"sharkomancer\" that lets you roll on a shark table.</li> \n\
  \      <li>You can reunite a dinosaur with its lost baby (or keep it for yourself—\
  I'm not judging).</li> \n      <li>There is an anti-magic zone that your casters\
  \ won't like very much.</li> \n      <li>You can encounter a tribe of grindylows\
  \ living inside of Hirgenzosk.</li> \n      <li>Depending on how you play, you may\
  \ or may not encounter the guy to the right.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>If you\
  \ want to try out Emerald Legacy, you can find the free PDF and further information\
  \ in <a href=\"/threads/rzs2v7wk?Emerald-Legacy-Adventure-Path\">this thread</a>.\
  \ I'm still updating the PDF as well, so any feedback is welcome!</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ hope you enjoy the AP and can use it to scratch your Tian Xia itch until the day\
  \ we can have an official card game version of Jade Regent :) Until next time!</p>\
