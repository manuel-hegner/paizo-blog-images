  description\">The Pathfinder community is rapidly growing, reaching numbers in the\
  \ hundreds of thousands, spread all over this great wide world. We thought it would\
  \ be nice to get to know each other a little better in a new monthly blog called\
  \ Pathfinder of the Month. Each month, we'll ask a member of our community to tell\
  \ us a little bit about themselves. We'll feature players, hobby shops, and anyone\
  \ else helping to make Team Pathfinder awesome.</span></p> \n    <p>Since our Customer\
  \ Service team has the most contact on a daily basis with our community, I asked\
  \ them who they thought we should feature first, and unanimously John Halpin was\
  \ at the top of the list. Without further adieu, meet our inaugural Pathfinder of\
  \ the Month: John Halpin.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Pathfinder of the Month:\
  \ John Halpin</h2> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20140103-JohnHalpin.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20140103-JohnHalpin_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Hello, all! I'm John Halpin. I started roleplaying with basic\
  \ Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and I've explored numerous systems including Palladium,\
  \ Hero System, 2nd and 3rd Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons, GURPs, the Marvel Super\
  \ Heroes Role-Playing Game, Earthdawn, Feng Shui, Everway and, of course, Pathfinder.\
  \ I've been playing for almost 32 years and have been a game master in my own game\
  \ world for the past quarter century.</p> \n     <p>I'm active in four tabletop\
  \ campaigns. As a GM, I run a game that has seen parties ranging from 1st to 30th\
  \ level (I use the <i>Epic Level Handbook</i>, and am working on converting these\
  \ character to the <i>Mythic Adventures</i> system). In my other groups, I play\
  \ a human paladin/ranger of a forgotten deity, an elven warblade (played straight\
  \ from the <i>Tome of Battle</i> alongside Pathfinder characters), and a redeemed\
  \ human assassin. I began playing Pathfinder with the alpha release and have advocated\
  \ the system to all of my friends, often running \"one-shot\" games for those who\
  \ haven't yet converted. I also coordinated one of the card game beta tests.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I enjoy a wide variety of games, but I especially enjoy stories of redemption,\
  \ war-based themes, and moderate levels of magic. Time travel and alternate realities\
  \ are favorite themes of mine; every so often, I like to run sessions in which we\
  \ take a break from my normal campaign to play an alternate reality version of the\
  \ game world with new characters for the PCs. The biggest influences on my gaming\
  \ style are J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, the Malazan Book of the\
  \ Fallen series by Steven Erikson, Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth novels, and Dennis\
  \ L. McKiernan's Mithgar series, starting with the illustrated <i>Tales from the\
  \ One-Eyed Crow</i>.</p> \n     <p>I've been the Paizo \"Dream Date\" for the Gen\
  \ Con ENnies award show for the past four years, and attended it with the Paizo\
  \ staff, and have attended the last four PaizoCons. As a gamer, I believe it's my\
  \ role to introduce others to the hobby, and I often run introductory adventures\
  \ for those new to gaming. These sessions have been well received and typically\
  \ include 6â€”10 people. I also helped coordinate three Pathfinder gaming days for\
  \ my semi-local gaming store, Days of Knights, in Newark, Delaware.</p> \n     <p>Outside\
  \ of gaming, I enjoy visiting abandoned areas, such as Centralia, Pennsylvania,\
  \ with my friends, exploring areas that could be inspirations for future games.\
  \ I'm an avid scuba diver and enjoy Hong Kong action movies. I also spend a lot\
  \ of time online reading gaming blogs and message boards, including the Paizo boards,\
  \ mostly as a lurker.</p> \n     <p>I live with the love of my life, my wife Heather,\
  \ in New Jersey where we volunteer at a greyhound rescue.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>From the Paizo family to yours, Happy New Year!</p> \n    <p>Jenny Bendel<br>\
  \ <i>Marketing Director</i></p> \n    <p>PS: If you'd like to nominate a Pathfinder\
