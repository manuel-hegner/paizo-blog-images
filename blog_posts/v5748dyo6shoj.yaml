  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">In Kiutu, a quiet village\
  \ on the eastern coast of Terwa Lake, young children often grow up listening to\
  \ tales of the ruins that are visible on an opposing shore, separated from the hamlet\
  \ by only a shallow inlet. Some stories tell of draconic monsters who haunt and\
  \ terrorize those who step foot beyond the threshold of the buried temple, and others\
  \ of the shadowy, winged figures that come to Kiutu in the night to drag misbehaving\
  \ children to the ruins; whatever the story, the folklore surrounding ancient Bloodsalt\
  \ carries with it a strong culture of fear and ominousness among Kiutu’s people.\
  \ Most children grow tired of hearing such tales as they grow into their adolescence,\
  \ brushing them off as fantasy, though the ruins always remain taboo. But Ija and\
  \ her peers always accepted that she was a peculiar child, and the young girl never\
  \ truly outgrew her youthful curiosity. </p> \n      <p>From as young as 4 years,\
  \ Ija exhibited an unusual wisdom among the children that age in Kiutu. Even before\
  \ she was old enough to begin tutoring, Ija could spin entire imaginary universes\
  \ of her own, and though she couldn’t yet speak full sentences, she would fill sketchbooks\
  \ with drawings of creatures and characters from her imagination, and from the tales\
  \ her parents told of the wonderful things they’d seen on their travels. Her mother,\
  \ a local artist named Ataya, was ecstatic to see Ija’s knack for building worlds,\
  \ and often the two would spend days drawing stories together, Ataya often drawing\
  \ fantastical dragons—Ija’s favorite creature—for the toddler to color in. Together\
  \ they formulated myriad characters, and Ija developed an affinity for a pink dragon\
  \ her mother doodled, whom the two decided to name Tuku. </p> \n      <p>When Ija\
  \ was finally old enough to journey past the sightline of the village, she would\
  \ traipse with sketchbook in hand down to the nearby lakeshore, where her father\
  \ often assisted biologists from across the region to set up field studies on Terwa\
  \ Lake. She’d ask the scientists questions about the animals that roamed outside\
  \ of the safety of Kiutu’s borders, offering a drawing of what she imagined they\
  \ looked like in return. </p> \n      <p>While most of the scientists found Ija’\
  s “endless conversational charisma” endearing, she’d often find herself getting\
  \ sent by her father to fetch research materials or supplies from the village instead,\
  \ and while she was sure she’d been behaving, she could never help but shake that\
  \ she’d done something wrong. </p> \n      <p>Into her adolescence, Ija still found\
  \ herself preoccupied with her imagination; notes she’d meant to take from her studies\
  \ or her father’s scientific lectures would be covered in doodles, or she’d lose\
  \ minutes of her tutors’ lectures daydreaming while looking at the Bloodsalt Ruins\
  \ across the lake, envisioning Tuku swooping about in mighty clashes with the monsters\
  \ that lurk there. But while her imagination was celebrated in her younger years,\
  \ expectations that Ija couldn’t keep up with were slowly piled upon her as she\
  \ grew older. Eventually the fond memories of days laughing and drawing with her\
  \ mother and father’s colleagues felt more and more distant. As her parents, tutors,\
  \ and peers pressured her to grow up, Ija buried herself deeper and deeper into\
  \ her imagination, and every night found solace in envisioning Tuku drifting elegantly\
  \ through the moonlit clouds, rather than dwelling on what she did (or could have\
  \ done) wrong that day.</p> \n      <p>One day, on a short field trip to the Terwa\
  \ River with her teacher and a few other children, Ija found herself separated from\
  \ the group; she’d become fascinated by a small copse of brightly colored ferns,\
  \ and in her fixation wandered off without saying a word to her group. While musing\
  \ at the strange and beautiful flora around her, noting the unusual shapes of the\
  \ leaves in her sketchbook, she laughed as she thought of Tuku helping her to grab\
  \ flowers and leaves from far above her reach. The bright oranges, reds, and violets\
  \ of the blossoms around her seemed to glow with an otherworldly light when she\
  \ held them close to her face, and Ija could have spent hours there without ever\
  \ losing focus. Her wild exploration ended abruptly, however, when she caught the\
  \ sound of her teacher calling her name from the edge of her hearing. Realizing\
  \ she had missed her lesson and fearing punishment, she shamefacedly ran to catch\
  \ up with her peers.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84349be9-f6a0-4e2d-b6a0-610b24fd291a/052521_Summoner.jpg\"\

  \ \n      <p>As Ija crested a small rise overlooking the riverbank and regained\
  \ sight of her group, she noticed her teacher and the other children’s eyes widen\
  \ in looks of surprise and confusion. Ija glanced down at herself, expecting to\
  \ find her clothes in embarrassing disarray or marked by a stains or tears she didn’\
  t notice, but there was nothing any more out of place on her person than normal.\
  \ She looked over her left shoulder and then her right, and instantly shared their\
  \ amazement. Tuku, manifested in physical form, stood a few feet behind her, eyeing\
  \ her fellow villagers with curiosity.</p> \n      <p>Ija marveled wordlessly; how\
  \ could they all so clearly see her imaginary friend? How was Tuku here and not\
  \ just in her idle daydreaming? Her teacher stepped forward, his eyes fixed on Ija’\
  s forehead, where the runic medallion she’d crafted for herself years earlier hung\
  \ from a simple headband. The rune was glowing, and it matched an identical symbol\
  \ on Tuku’s brow.</p> \n      <p>“Ija,” her teacher asked in wonder, “how long have\
  \ you been a god caller?”</p> \n      <p>She just shook her head, trying to make\
  \ sense of what was going on. Had she done something wrong <em>again</em>?</p> \n\
  \      <p>Her teacher knelt to look her straight in the eye as he spoke. Tuku snorted\
  \ defensively behind her as the kindly elder reached out for Ija, but quickly calmed\
  \ as the teacher spoke:</p> \n      <p>“My grandfather was a refugee of the Worldwound,\
  \ you know. He fled Sarkoris a century ago, as a child, when the demons overtook\
  \ his land. He kept few of the traditions of his people when he met my grandmother\
  \ and settled here in Kiutu, but he told stories of his childhood. Most memorable\
  \ among them were his stories of the god callers—those among the Sarkorians who\
  \ could summon a powerful ally from beyond our reality to aid and guide the people\
  \ in times of trouble. The Sarkorians called these beings gods, but others call\
  \ them eidolons, and don’t worship them as my grandfather’s people did. It appears\
  \ that you are a god caller, too, Ija, and that dragon—”</p> \n      <p>“Tuku,”\
  \ she said without thinking.</p> \n      <p>“—Tuku, as you say, is your eidolon,”\
  \ her teacher explained. “Just as you and Tuku share a connection, symbolized in\
  \ the glowing rune upon both your bodies, so too did the holy runes of the Sarkorian\
  \ god callers shine when the gods were among their people.”</p> \n      <p>Ija turned\
  \ to look at her eidolon inquisitively. Tuku returned the look and tilted his head\
  \ playfully, like a pet dog expecting its owner to throw a stick. Who was this strange\
  \ creature, who wasn’t quite as imaginary as she’s always thought? She felt as though\
  \ she already knew him so well. She’d created him as a toddler, after all—or had\
  \ she?</p> \n      <p>A small group of researchers working a short distance down\
  \ the riverbank had made their way up to where Ija and her eidolon now stood. Her\
  \ father was among them. None of them appeared scared of Tuku, or of her glowing\
  \ rune. They were simply curious, interested in a new occurrence to document in\
  \ their findings. Her father, however, looked proud and overjoyed at his daughter’\
  s newfound calling.</p> \n      <p>Her teacher, noticing the confusion in Ija’s\
  \ face, offered words of reassurance. “Yes, there is much for you to learn about\
  \ yourself, Ija. Perhaps you struggled so much to walk the path set before you because\
  \ you had a different path you were meant to walk, shoulder to shoulder with Tuku\
  \ here. We can’t teach you these things, your parents and I. You must learn about\
  \ Tuku and your bond with him on your own, but don’t worry—we will help you how\
  \ we can, and I am sure Tuku will guide you in his own way as well.” The teacher\
  \ paused momentarily with thought. “Do not be afraid, young one; the path you walk\
  \ may be yours alone, but you are never truly alone on your journey.”</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Over the coming weeks and months, Ija and Tuku traveled farther from Kiutu\
  \ than she’d ever gone before, to Nantambu where the libraries of the Magambya promised\
  \ answers to her calling (if she could focus enough to read them). But unlike the\
  \ lessons of her youth, Ija found the questions she had sufficient motivation to\
  \ learn all on her own. And since she learned better by doing than from reading\
  \ or listening to a lecture, the fact that she could now explore the limits of her\
  \ power and the strange bond she shared with her dear Tuku meant she never lacked\
  \ the will to get up and approach the day’s challenges together.</p> \n      <p>Ija\
  \ has met many fellow knowledge seekers in her travels, and she makes a loyal, if\
  \ mischievous, companion. Tuku tends to be aloof and curmudgeonly when interacting\
  \ with anyone other than Ija, though he eventually warms to those who clearly don’\
  t mean his summoner any harm. Together, Ija and Tuku plan to one day visit the Sarkoris\
  \ Scar, to learn what they can of their connection from the god callers repopulating\
  \ the land now that the Worldwound is closed. Until then, however, Ija and Tuku\
  \ go where their fancy takes them and return often to Kiutu to share drawings and\
  \ verbal tales of their adventures with her family and friends.</p> \n      <p style=\"\
