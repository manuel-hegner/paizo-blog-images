  \ the Warwolf</i>!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 14, 2010</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Many of you already hip to the Planet Stories line likely already know about\
  \ China Miéville's enthusiasm for Hugh Cook, the recently deceased New Zealand author\
  \ whose capacity for bizarre and captivating fantasy worlds which staunchly refused\
  \ to leave out any SF element (from magic to tech, dragons to pirates) was matched\
  \ only by his ambition as an author (in which many thousands of published pages\
  \ were considered just the tip of the iceberg). And China's not alone—Paizo publisher\
  \ Erik Mona has spoken long and eloquently on this site before about how much he\
  \ loved Cook's writing, and how republishing <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy88wa\"\
  ><i>The Walrus &amp; the Warwolf</i></a> is a lifelong goal of his.</p> \n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n   <table align=\"right\" border=\"0\"> \n    <tbody>\n     <tr> \n      <td\

  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>As such, in honor of the impact Cook has made on countless\
  \ fans and authors—and on the world of Golarion itself—Planet Stories and China\
  \ Miéville have teamed up to offer China's entire introduction to the book here\
  \ on this blog, for free. It's our sincere hope that, after reading it, you'll understand\
  \ why we thought this guy deserved to stand alongside better-known authors like\
  \ Robert E. Howard and Michael Moorcock in the <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet\
  \ Stories</a> line. (And as far as we're concerned, if China can't convince you\
  \ Hugh Cook is worth reading, no one can.)</p> \n    <p><b>Warning:</b> Strong language\
  \ below! But then, what do you expect from pirates?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n  \
  \   <center>\n      <h2>In Praise of Stupid Boys</h2>\n      <br>\n     </center>\
  \ \n     <center>\n      by China Miéville\n     </center> \n     <p>Of Hugh Cook's\
  \ extraordinary, underrated, bizarre and hysterical decology, <i>Chronicles of an\
  \ Age of Darkness, The Walrus &amp; the Warwolf</i> has long been a, if not the,\
  \ reader favourite. Let's be clear: the whole series urgently needs rediscovery—\
  each book (all standalone) for its own specifics, as well as for the astonishing\
  \ audacity with which Cook tangles them. Not only do they cross over and back and\
  \ through each other book to book, but like a kind of pulp Rashomon-monger, he might\
  \ repeat the exact same scene several books apart, described from two contradictory\
  \ points of view, so only the most faithful readers will get the joke. The hope\
  \ is that having been hooked by the following story of Drake Douay, readers will\
  \ go on to <i>The Wizards &amp; the Warriors, The Women &amp; the Warlords</i>,\
  \ and the later, more arcanely double-<i>W</i>-ing titles (from which paradigm Cook,\
  \ with the torturous rigour of any Oulipian prankster—like Georges Perec, who wrote\
  \ an entire novel without the letter \"e\"—admirably refused to budge. <i>The Werewolf\
  \ &amp; the Wormlord</i>? Really?).</p> \n     <p>But while every one is a must-read,\
  \ it's easy to see why <i>The Walrus &amp; the Warwolf</i> is perhaps the favourite.\
  \ This epic picaresque of Drake's adventures is astoundingly full of <i>stuff</i>,\
  \ precisely the stuff that gets our sweet spots. Pirates! Monsters! Wizards! Battles!\
  \ Pirates! Sex! Pirates! Misunderstood robots from an ancient high-tech past! Really\
  \ excellent monsters! Etc! Also pirates! </p> \n     <p>Each of those elements and\
  \ others deserves an introduction of its own. What follows are a few thoughts only.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>On the question of monsters, Cook brilliantly has it both ways. On the\
  \ one hand, what we want from our fantasy beasts is familiarity. We want to see\
  \ what an author can do with the traditional figures we know well—the gryphons,\
  \ the unicorns, the... alright, let's use the D-word... the dragons. On the other\
  \ hand, especially in these post-Lovecraft days, we want monsters that are completely\
  \ new, totally alien, without any remembered fabular cognates. These are quite contradictory\
  \ ways of relating to fantastic bodies, and authors generally simply have to choose\
  \ one or the other to indulge. Cook, however, refuses to. Instead, he draws a border—\
  a physical border, at the bottom of his map. To the north of it live dragons and\
  \ their familiar folkloroid compadres; to the south, the Swarm, incomprehensible\
  \ insecto-alien monstrosities, like the Neversh, of terrifying, carefully described\
  \ but almost impossible to visualise alien forms. So by a kind of Promethean arithmetic,\
  \ Cook just <i>adds</i> the new-monstrous to the old.</p> \n     <p>Sex: this book\
  \ is filthy. What it is not is graphic: there's very little by way of descriptions\
  \ of plunging manhoods, secret intimate spots, throbbing members or rosebuds, nor\
  \ those bits and pieces by any of their more R-rated names. This is not a book designed\
  \ to get you hot. What there is, though, is much braver: a cheerfully unflustered\
  \ and <i>en-passant</i> depiction of sexual mores that are very <i>not our own</i>.\
  \ That does not mean what one might call the \"Gor option\"—a titillating sprinkle\
  \ of some sexist middlebrow wank-fodder that a few authors might think would spark\
  \ up a secondary world. No, Cook considers it much less likely that his locals will\
  \ dress in fetching BDSM straps than that they will, say, not share our most fundamental\
  \ taboos. Such as, to mention a memorable scene from early on in the book, the one\
  \ about incest. </p> \n     <p>Not that this particular intimate chat between Drake\
  \ and his sister is pruriently indulged: it is <i>played for laughs</i>. It takes\
  \ a very unusual kind of narrative confidence to make that joke, and make it work.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>It's a similar technique of light-hearted seriousness that gets\
  \ Cook past a usual dashing-rogue/merciless-baddy dyad with regard to pirates. Running\
  \ away to sea with a group of swashbucklers is an old fantasy, of course, and its\
  \ enthusiastic indulgence is part of what makes <i>The Walrus &amp; the Warwolf</i>\
  \ unputdownable. But this isn't Johnny Depp we're talking about, let alone Orlando\
  \ Bloom. Piracy means ruthlessness. So when faced with attacking sea serpents, Drake's\
  \ sincerely admired captain doesn't hesitate, in a scene neither indulged for mawkish\
  \ horror nor giggled at in sadistic glee but merely mentioned, to <i>throw the ship's\
  \ women overboard</i>, to drown or be eaten alive. The captain is Jon Arabin, the\
  \ Warwolf of the title, and he is, in terms of the narrative, not at all a villain.\
  \ Nor an \"anti-hero.\" What he is is a pirate. </p> \n     <p>There are countless\
  \ more elements and complicated sequences of events that go to make up Drake's story.\
  \ What makes Cook's achievement so extraordinary, throughout the course of this\
  \ discombobulated epic soup, is the relationship of his protagonist to time, adulthood,\
  \ and change.</p> \n     <p>One of the many wonderful things about humans is that,\
  \ and how much, we learn. Not just in classrooms and libraries, but everybloodywhere,\
  \ simply as a byproduct of living in time. We change, and that—not counting the\
  \ physical process, which pretty much just sucks—is wholeheartedly exciting. Writers\
  \ have long known that, which is why as well as the whizz-bang events of any book,\
  \ as well as all the helicopter chases, giant-monkey hunts and sexual shenanigans,\
  \ part of what makes us love a story is watching the characters develop. They aren't\
  \ static. Character plus time equals narrative. </p> \n     <p>This matters. It's\
  \ about more than just entertainment or spinning a decent yarn (with neither of\
  \ which, of course, is there anything wrong). It's about respect for one's characters,\
  \ and is a corollary of great emancipatory shifts in human consciousness. There's\
  \ nothing a powerful status quo likes more than, well, a status quo—the sense that\
  \ everything will and must stay as it is. Foregrounding a character's change, by\
  \ contrast, is a threat to tedious homilies of stasis, and it's no coincidence that\
  \ the emergence of the most highly developed and self-conscious form of this genre\
  \ was part of that revolutionary ruckus in reason, politics, aesthetics and everything\
  \ else that we call the Enlightenment. In the second half of the 18th Century, Germany,\
  \ that indefatigable compound neologiser, gave a name to the radical \"novel of\
  \ development,\" and it is as the <i>Bildungsroman</i> that we still know it.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This isn't just history, either. Anyone who reads the tale of a boy-wizard\
  \ to see <i>how he turns out</i>, why, and what happens to him on the way, or who\
  \ recalls how a callow Tattooine moisture-farmer ends up, several adventures later,\
  \ a self-possessed Jedi, understands that the <i>Bildungsroman</i> is alive and\
  \ well—and particularly healthy in its incarnation as the \"epic\" that SF and fantasy\
  \ readers love. It's in Fantasyland that kitchen boys tend to become kings, which\
  \ as well as upgrading your wardrobe has got to mess with your preconceptions. The\
  \ best stories show us precisely that messy, amazing dialectic of continuity and\
  \ change—let us watch, in other words, the dynamic process of being human.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Got all that? Hugh Cook does.</p> \n     <p>You can tell by the brio with\
  \ which he ignores it.</p> \n     <p>Like, <i>totally</i> fucking ignores it.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Drake Douay learns nothing. He has no interest in learning anything.\
  \ He is vehemently antipathetic to the furniture of \"growing up.\" <i>The Walrus\
  \ &amp; the Warwolf</i> is a magnificent paean to adolescence, in all its sulky,\
  \ petulant, self-important refusal to defer gratification, or to consider anyone\
  \ else's feelings for one second.</p> \n     <p>In one of the most telling of the\
  \ book's labyrinthine subplots, Drake is infected with nanobots that make him immune\
  \ to poisons. His response to having become a superman? He is aghast. Because he\
  \ can't get drunk. \"He no longer fell about with rejoicing laughter when one man\
  \ vomited over another,\" as Cook puts it. Any block to wilful, convivial stupidity,\
  \ in other words, is to him an outrageous block on his liberty.</p> \n     <p>Drake\
  \ is unerringly faithful to such attitudes. His passionate obsession with Zanya\
  \ Kliedervaust is totally disaggregated from anything specific about her beyond\
  \ his ongoing priapic frenzy in her presence. Not only does her profound distaste\
  \ at the thought of getting involved with him and his early, thankfully cack-handed\
  \ failure to trick or force her into sex not dissuade him from his efforts, but\
  \ he sticks at badgering her long enough and with enough idiot rigour that he finally\
  \ <i>wins her over</i>. This of course is totally fucking absurd. Drake, however,\
  \ does not realise this, and, crucially, neither does the world he lives in.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The fact that the world is so taken in is the big surprise. The only\
  \ feasible and reasonable attitude to adolescents should be kind, eye-rolling, impatient\
  \ patience—we know, after all, that the universe will ultimately disabuse them of\
  \ their unshakable belief that they are the most important thing in it. To indulge\
  \ the cliché, even their endless arse-aching moans about how no one understands\
  \ them and that authority figures are oppressive fascist bastards and that everything\
  \ is <i>so unfair</i> are predicated on a self-important sense that the world conspires\
  \ to stand in the way of their rightful greatness.</p> \n     <p>Annoying this might\
  \ be, but it's also kind of winning. Hugh Cook has Drake's moans be, if not less\
  \ self-indulgent, less deluded. Gouda Muck, the adult with authority over him is,\
  \ in fact, unfair towards him. \"Unfair,\" that is, in that he fixates on Drake\
  \ as the harbinger of all evil, dedicates his life and resources to finding and\
  \ killing Drake, propagates a religion predicated on the holy certainty that Drake\
  \ is the personification of evil, and succeeds in making it the state church of\
  \ Drake's hometown. There really <i>is</i> a conspiracy.</p> \n     <p>Of course\
  \ this is terrible for Drake, and leads to some dramatic politicking and narrative\
  \ intrigue. But, but, but. Such a religion is also, of course, immensely flattering\
  \ to its devil-figure. Was ever there so total a vindication of teenagers' self-aggrandisement\
  \ as the revelation that the world <i>is</i> in fact out to get them, that the guardians\
  \ of power really <i>have</i> constructed their entire moral code purely to undermine\
  \ them, that avoiding getting caught by their parental figures—joining a pirate\
  \ crew and spending years exploring arcane continents here an extended remix of\
  \ sneaking out of the bedroom window—really honestly totally <i>is</i> a matter\
  \ of life and painful ritualised death? It is a brilliant rebuke to our rebuke to\
  \ adolescence.</p> \n     <p>Drake Douay is an adolescent who refuses to learn the\
  \ lessons of life and still gets to be the hero. Who succeeds, as he repeatedly\
  \ and hilariously does, not by wisdom, experience or nuanced thinking, but by luck,\
  \ doggedness and that astonishing crossbreed of idiocy and animal genius, that virtuoso\
  \ dumbness, in which the teenager specialises. The sheer affection in which this\
  \ book holds its heroically stubborn naughty-boy hero is terribly affecting, and\
  \ terribly humane. Sure, there was a time when stressing change and development\
  \ was the progressive thing for narrative to do: but lord knows that has its own\
  \ moralism, too, and it's become a tedious norm. Things would never be the same\
  \ after that Summer. Now, in the debris of ten thousand sub-Oz codas—what have we\
  \ learnt, Dorothy?—it is impossible not to cheer at the sight of a Dorothy who learns\
  \ not a damn thing, and still tries for an angle to avoid being grounded.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Hugh Cook has created the anti-<i>Bildungsroman</i>. The coming-of-age-refusal.\
  \ The novel that celebrates, vindicates and world-creates according to the spirit\
  \ of adolescence, without wagging a finger, without talking down, and in which the\
  \ most wince-inducing, embarrassing, hare-brained schemes of the young somehow work.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Meet Drake Douay, as the slogan has it, and you'll never be the same\
  \ again. Unlike him.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p align=\"center\">\"In Praise\
