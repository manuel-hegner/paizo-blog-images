  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I was two-thirds\
  \ of the way through a hybrid power converter and already feeling the buzz when\
  \ a knock on the door caught me off guard. In itself, that shouldn’t have been strange;\
  \ I’m a private detective, after all. But I’d turned the sign off a week ago. Sentient\
  \ Robotic Investigations—the only SRO detective agency in the Burning Archipelago—\
  was closed. Figuring someone’d gotten lost, I opened the door to send them away.\
  \ Instead I found a korasha lashunta waiting, her features as symmetrical as anyone\
  \ could ask for, wearing an annoyed scowl that brought with it a surge of memories\
  \ of the old days.</p> \n     <p>“Chief Maneon,” I said, waving her in and tipping\
  \ the power converter in her direction. “I’d buy you a charge, but I think I already\
  \ spent it.” She didn’t laugh. I’m not very funny.</p> \n     <p>She’d come to tell\
  \ me about a stiff—a ysoki, washed up in the canal in Bulwarks Plaza. Eventually\
  \ I realized she was offering me a job. “Last time I checked,” I said dryly, “you\
  \ were in charge of a bunch of cops.”</p> \n     <p>“We’re slammed,” she said. “\
  Too many cases, not enough hands. You remember things at Laubu Station.” I did,\
  \ but I was also thinking of how I was going to refill my drained power converter.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Rate’s two hundred a day, plus expenses.”</p> \n     <p>She accepted\
  \ without hesitation. That’s when I should have known better. “A person’s dead,”\
  \ she said on her way out the door. “All I want to know is, what are you going to\
  \ do about it?”</p> \n     <p>I tossed the spent battery on the table. “As little\
  \ as possible.”</p> \n     <p>I tried the canal, but it was a bust. Holo-tape marked\
  \ off the scene where they’d dragged the poor rat—a guy named Bey—out of the water,\
  \ but there was nothing to see. The locals along the green promenade didn’t seem\
  \ to notice in any case. Not far off, a small crowd gathered around local doomsayer\
  \ Jenaelyn, whose ravings about a pending armageddon were far more interesting than\
  \ anything I had going on.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112119_TftDTheLongSunrise.jpg\"\

  \    </div> \n     <p>Bey managed an apartment building in Clearlight and I headed\
  \ in that direction. It was a hike, and by the time I got there my circuits were\
  \ throbbing. I was not in a good mood. Of course, the door was locked, so I jimmied\
  \ it. I couldn’t exactly ask the landlord to let me in.</p> \n     <p>Inside was\
  \ a warren. Typical ysoki. I wove a path between boxes of cheap electronics and\
  \ used drone parts. There was a whole rack filled with nothing but obsolete datapads,\
  \ and a handful of credsticks by the bed. His union certification was framed on\
  \ the wall. I liked him. But there was a weird signal coming from behind the desk;\
  \ it was wired. Crawling under there, I saw a security panel. I tried his union\
  \ member number, and a panel in the wall slid open. I went in.</p> \n     <p>It\
  \ was a small little space, cozy even for a ysoki. He’d hung monitors all over the\
  \ walls, and half of them were still running. On the screens, people—mostly lashuntas\
  \ in black—sat huddled together in molded plastic seats, checking their comms or\
  \ talking quietly to each other. A few people stood nearby, holding onto brass poles\
  \ that led from floor to ceiling. It was the inside of a linecrawler. Bey had bugged\
  \ the linecrawlers. What the hell for?</p> \n     <p>All the camera feeds were recorded.\
  \ There were hundreds of hours. My headache was telling me I didn’t want to watch\
  \ them all, but it turned out I didn’t have to. Fifteen minutes were missing from\
  \ a recording three days old. Bey had erased it. I locked up as I left. But I took\
  \ the credsticks.</p> \n     <p>Half of the credsticks bore the logo of the Last\
  \ Laugh—a local comedy club—so that’s where I went. Tonight, the batteries were\
  \ on Bey. Chaz Bilgart, the club’s most celebrated act, was on stage, making a finger\
  \ pistol with one hand. “‘Didn’t you hear me,’” he snarled, imitating a mugger in\
  \ a cheap holonovel. “‘Hand over the credits or I blow your damn brains out!’ And\
  \ I told him, ‘Gimme a second, okay? I’m thinking!’” I didn’t get the joke, but\
  \ everyone else laughed.</p> \n     <p>I saw a lot of off-duty cops in the room,\
  \ but I rolled in anyway and ordered a battery from a waiter dressed like a mourner.\
  \ Bey’s sticks had plenty of credits. I didn’t know if I could drink my way through\
  \ all of them, but I was ready to try. I was halfway through my second when Chaz\
  \ dropped onto the chair next to me. “J4K3, you look like crap.” I couldn’t disagree,\
  \ so I showed him a picture on my comm without a word. “That’s Bey,” he said. “\
  Nice guy. Tips good. Is he in trouble?”</p> \n     <p>“Not anymore.” I told him\
  \ about the canal.</p> \n     <p>Chaz told me Bey had been in three nights ago,\
  \ pretty upset. Had too many. A local took him home. When I asked who, he pointed\
  \ across the room to a table where a bunch of big palookas sat around a less boorish,\
  \ far more handsome local. “Zeylan,” he said. </p> \n     <p>“Bey talk to anyone\
  \ else?”</p> \n     <p>“One of the waiters, Lin,” he said. “But Lin didn’t show\
  \ for his shift today.”</p> \n     <p>I didn’t like my odds against the palookas,\
  \ so I waited for Zeylan to leave and I followed him. Chaz insisted on tagging along.\
  \ We ended up at a storage facility which Zeylan entered. I got Maneon on the comm\
  \ and told her everything. She was there in ten minutes.</p> \n     <p>“Killer is\
  \ in there?” she said.</p> \n     <p>“And probably another dead guy,” I told her.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I was ready to bust the door down but she just knocked. “Sir,” she said\
  \ through the door. “It’s Chief Maneon.”</p> \n     <p>After a short pause, the\
  \ door opened a crack. Zeylan had a pistol pointed at the floor. “Shavri,” he said.\
  \ nonchalantly. “Who are your friends?”</p> \n     <p>Maneon didn’t acknowledge\
  \ Zeylan’s familiar address and ignored the question. “You need to go, sir. Is there\
  \ a body in there?”</p> \n     <p>Zeylan shrugged. “I’m afraid so.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Leave it. I’ll take it to the crematorium. With all due respect sir, if you’d let\
  \ me take care of the first one, none of this would have happened.”</p> \n     <p>A\
  \ numb feeling had been spreading through my circuits, but I finally lost it when\
  \ I realized the chief wasn’t calling Zeylan “sir” as a formality, but rather as\
  \ a sign of deference. I lifted my arc pistol, but Chaz held me back, giving Zeylan\
  \ the chance to slip out the door and bolt. And just like that I was watching his\
  \ back as he ran for the linecrawler station.</p> \n     <p>Maneon looked at me\
  \ like she’d just swallowed a bug. “Holy hell, J4K3, put that thing away before\
  \ you hurt someone!”</p> \n     <p>“You knew the whole damn time!”</p> \n     <p>“\
  I didn’t know how the ysoki overheard what he did. But now we’ll destroy the rest\
  \ of those recordings. This is your fault. You should have done what you promised\
  \ you’d do.”</p> \n     <p><i>As little as possible</i>, I’d told her.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>She turned away to see to the corpse waiting in the storage unit. As the\
  \ door closed, I made a last lunge to hold it open, but Chaz was stronger than he\
  \ looked.</p> \n     <p>“Forget it, J4K3,” he hissed in my ear. “It’s Asanatown.”\
