  \ Society</a> team is always looking for ways to improve our relationship with friendly\
  \ local gaming stores and offer things to help thank them for all they do in their\
  \ support of both the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and Adventure Card Guild.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Retailers registered on paizo.com currently may receive a free Base Set\
  \ for each <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>\
  \ adventure path in order to run <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Adventure Card Guild</a> scenarios.\
  \ Each week they also receive free copies of the Adventure Card Guild scenarios.\
  \ And in the very near future, we plan on giving retailers access to the back catalog\
  \ and all future scenario releases of the <a href=\"/pathfinderSocietyScenarios\"\
  >Roleplaying Guild scenarios</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9c25\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1131_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>We're kicking off this plan with an exclusive quest for retailers\
  \ on April 29! This quest is based on and utilizes content from our latest hardcover\
  \ release <a href=\"/products/btpy9c25\"><em>Pathfinder Unchained</em></a>. In the\
  \ future, our plan is to provide more exclusive quests coupled with new hardcover\
  \ rulebooks upon their public release.</p> \n    <p>In this initial launch, the\
  \ <em>Unchained</em> quest will only be provided to registered retailers. The registered\
  \ retailers may schedule it as many times and on whatever days as they like, and\
  \ it will be store exclusive through the end of <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>.\
  \ After PaizoCon, it will be made available as a free download for everyone! It\
  \ is the registered retailers' responsibility to provide printed copies of the Quest\
  \ to GMs to run the event.</p> \n    <p>Although the onus is on the retailer to\
  \ make the most of this exclusive quest, I encourage all of you to speak with store\
  \ owners and help them make the most of this opportunity. If your local store is\
  \ not a registered retailer on Paizo.com, point them to our <a href=\"/paizo/about/retailers\"\
  >Retailers page</a> to sign up!</p> \n    <p>We hope that the start of this new\
  \ program, with the help of our VOs, will generate more interest in retailer exclusive\
  \ content. This program will allow players and GMs the opportunity to familiarize\
  \ themselves with new hardcover rules content, while allowing retailers to highlight\
  \ a new product and hopefully boost sales in their stores.</p> \n    <p>To round\
  \ out our latest hardcover release, next week's blog will feature how <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9c25\"><em>Pathfinder Unchained</em></a> is being integrated into\
  \ Pathfinder Society. This blog will highlight all the information you need to not\
  \ only have a successful product launch in store, but how it will be be utilized\
  \ for the foreseeable future in organized play.</p> \n    <p>Please let us know\
  \ what you think, and as always, thanks to all of you for making PFS as awesome\
  \ as it is today!</p> \n    <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Global Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
