  \  </div>\n  <blockquote> \n   <h1>RPG Superstar™ 2011</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"\
  >Monday, November 15, 2010</p> \n   <p>Paizo Publishing, LLC® is proud to announce\
  \ RPG Superstar 2011, the fourth season of its popular RPG design contest. The search\
  \ for the newest talent in RPG design begins December 3, 2010 on paizo.com.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"We’ve been blown away by the success of the contest,” said Lisa Stevens,\
  \ CEO of Paizo Publishing. \"Each year the contest gets bigger and better. This\
  \ year not only will we publish the winner’s entry as a Pathfinder Module, but the\
  \ remaining Top 4 contestants will each get to write a scenario for our Pathfinder\
  \ Society organized play program. It’s going to be an exciting year, and I can’\
  t wait to see what gets submitted.\"</p> \n   <p>Paizo has selected four judges\
  \ to oversee the competition. For the first time ever, Ryan Dancey, one of the fathers\
  \ of Open Gaming, will be an RPG Superstar judge. Returning from the previous season\
  \ is Paizo’s own Sean K Reynolds, author and developer extraordinaire. Joining them\
  \ will be Mark Moreland, Pathfinder Society developer and continuity editor; and\
  \ former RPG Superstar winner Neil Spicer, who debuted as a guest judge for the\
  \ initial round last year. These judges will critique each round’s entries before\
  \ the public vote.</p> \n   <p>Last year Matt Goodall’s <a href=\"/pathfinder/modules/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8dv6\"\
  >Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</a> emerged victorious as 2010’s RPG Superstar winner\
  \ after a week of public comment and fan voting at paizo.com. His winning adventure\
  \ releases in January as a full-color printed Pathfinder Module. </p> \n   <p>Starting\
  \ at 2 PM Pacific Time on December 3, 2010, contestants will be able to submit their\
  \ RPG Superstar entry at paizo.com/rpgsuperstar/previous/2011. For the first round,\
  \ that entry will be a wondrous item designed for use with Paizo's Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game. Each entry must be 300 words or less, and must include all of the proper\
  \ mechanics and flavor. Contestants must submit their entry by December 31, 2010.\
  \ Judges will select the top 32 entries to be announced on January 18, 2010; those\
  \ 32 contestants will be assigned a new design task and their entries will be posted\
  \ on paizo.com for the public to read, critique, and vote on. The designers garnering\
  \ the most votes in each round will continue on to subsequent rounds, and the ultimate\
  \ winner will earn a paid commission to write one of Paizo's upcoming Pathfinder\
  \ Modules, while the remaining top 3 designers will earn a paid commission to write\
  \ an upcoming Pathfinder Society scenario!</p> \n   <p>Specifics for each challenge\
  \ will be announced as each round begins. The winner of RPG Superstar 2011 will\
  \ be announced on March 22, 2011. Complete rules and a submission form are available\
  \ at paizo.com/rpgsuperstar/previous/2011.</p> \n   <p>Do you have what it takes\
  \ to be the next RPG Superstar? </p> \n   <p>Hyrum Savage <br> Marketing Manager</p>\
