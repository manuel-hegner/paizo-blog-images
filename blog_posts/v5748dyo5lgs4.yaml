  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> preview to deliver on something I've\
  \ been promising for a while. We've finally managed to sort a bunch of our unused\
  \ promotional repaint figures from 2013 and 2014, and I wanted to share them with\
  \ you as soon as I could! All six are currently available for ordering exclusively\
  \ on paizo.com. Like previous promo figures, these will not last forever. I think\
  \ they make great \"stocking stuffer\" gifts for fellow gamers, so I wanted to get\
  \ them up in time for the holidays (and because people keep reminding me I've been\
  \ promising to do so for ages). We'll pick up with the <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"\

  \ Raider</a> is a special promotional miniature designed to promote the <a href=\"\
  https://goblinworks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online</a> game. As the Kickstarter\
  \ for that project grew and grew, the originally planned single figure turned into\
  \ a set of 10, and this figure was created all over again and included as part of\
  \ the 10-figure sealed <em>Emerald Spire Promo Set</em>. That left us with the original\
  \ run of the figure, which has since been distributed in limited quantities at regional\
  \ conventions. This version of the Bloodbriar Goblin Raider is based on the same\
  \ paint master as the figure in the Promo Set, but as it was produced in a different\
  \ production run, there are slight differences in the paint application. The base\
  \ is also different, featuring the GoblinWorks logo instead of the Emerald Spire\
  \ set designation. The figure is a promotional repaint of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8sen\"\
  >Goblin Commando on Mount</a> figure from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\"><em>Rise\
  \ of the Runelords</em></a> Pathfinder Battles set. The goblin is a Small figure\
