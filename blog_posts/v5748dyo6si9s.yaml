  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Firebrands</em></a> is here! Just like with any rebellion,\
  \ there were a lot of people that put in work to make this book possible. Among\
  \ them are the wonderful authors for <em>Firebrands</em>. We wanted to give them\
  \ a chance to share their excitement for the book, as well as some information about\
  \ themselves and their projects. If you’ve enjoyed these authors’ work, let them\
  \ know in the comments below or by following them on social media!</p> \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <h3>James Beck</h3> \n     <p>Hello, my name is James Beck, a Jewish LGBTQ+\
  \ freelance writer, and I wrote Passenger and the Fire’s Finest faction! You might\
  \ know me either as one of the members of Eldritch Osiris Games, which is a workers’\
  \ co-op publishing house; Osiris on deadly d8; or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/geekjames513\"\
  >@geekjames513</a> on Twitter, where you can find me geeking out heavily with the\
  \ PF2e community! I was so honored to be working on a book that let me explore themes\
  \ of freedom and exploration and I hope you enjoy the book as much as I have. Everyone\
  \ on the project was super supportive and awesome to work with and it was a true\
  \ honor to be a part of the process!</p> \n     <br> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n\

  \ <em>Firebrands</em>, I was excited to revisit the gods Picoperi and Thisamet for\
  \ Pathfinder Second Edition, who are azata empyreal lords. During this process,\
  \ I thought a lot about what type of people would focus their worship on these deities.\
  \ After all, deities devoted to pranks and celebrations aren’t as all-encompassing\
  \ as gods of community or commerce! Thinking about the dangerous lives of Firebrands\
  \ was a perfect framing for these deities since celebrations and merriment are necessary\
  \ to keep up the hard work of revolution. I also took a dive into the pirate’s life\
  \ with Besmara and the Firebrands operations in the Shackles. Again, my focus was\
  \ on thinking about how the life of a revolutionary Firebrand would intersect with\
  \ life on the seas and shores. This section was a joy to write, and I hope the salt-crusted\
  \ Shackles operations provide campaign hooks for your own adventures—be they against\
  \ the Red Mantis, Chelaxian incursions, or the environment.</p> \n     <br> \n \
  \    <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> \n     <p>Hi everyone! My name’s Jessica Catalan and\
  \ I’m the Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance author who primarily writes\
  \ for the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs. For <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Firebrands</em>,\
  \ I wrote the Life of a Firebrand and Vaunter’s Carnival sections, notable figures\
  \ Iqani Truthspinner and the Mockingbird, the gods Chaldira, Grandmother Spider,\
  \ Marishi, Milani, and Nivi Rhombodazzle, avatar statistics, and the spells. I’\
  m particularly fond of Iqani Truthspinner, as well as Tanglehop, a character inspired\
  \ by my daughter who you’ll find in Vaunter’s Carnival. I’m incredibly proud to\
  \ have been a part of <em> Firebrands</em>, and I hope that the love and enthusiasm\
  \ that everyone poured into this book resonates with you and your fellow gamers.\
  \ Take care of each other out there. The world could use a few more Firebrands!</p>\

  \     <p>Working on <em>Firebrands</em> was an amazing adventure, during which I\
  \ fell in love with so many of the colorful characters I got to create for it. While\
  \ Ayaanala, Hollow Hart, and Sahru Sital stand out as some of my favorites, Ishii\
  \ Bunji will always be close to my heart, because I created him as a love letter\
  \ to the transmasc community. I started out knowing I wanted to show that this wholesome\
  \ chubby trans guy could also be immensely powerful and desirable, and with each\
  \ successive draft he gradually transformed from an insatiable warrior into someone\
  \ whose strength comes from kindness and inner joy. A kind of strength that, I’\
  d like to think, can defy tyrants. Thomas Coughlin is also an important character\
  \ to me, for far more personal reasons. He was named after a very dear friend of\
  \ mine, who passed away shortly before this project started. Thomas loved roleplaying\
  \ games, and being able to name a character after him in a book like this felt like\
  \ the best way to honor his memory. All my love and thanks to this amazing community,\
  \ this writing team, and the staff at Paizo, who continue to make Pathfinder one\
  \ of the best TTRPGs in the world. Cheers!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Sen H.H.S</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Hi everyone, it’s Sen H.H.S.! Yeah, I’ve been popping up a lot lately\
  \ because there are just so many fun things to write about and create for Golarion.\
  \ For <em>Firebrands</em>, other than writing about their relationships with other\
  \ organizations or nations, I also wrote Jin Li, a new God of Dares who’s a carp\
  \ that leaped so high that he turned into a dragon! In fact, according to my chat\
  \ records, he leaped so hard that my computer crashed while writing about him. I\
  \ am most likely making and retweeting a lot of memes about him after the release,\
  \ which you shall be able to find on Twitter @Senhhs. See you all there and three\
  \ cheers to the <em>Firebrands</em> book release!</p>\n     <br> \n     <br clear=\"\

  \ I think they speak for themselves, but if you somehow aren’t sold on <em>Firebrands</em>\

  \ when it releases later this year. Outside of writing, you can find me on the Know\
  \ Direction network as a cohost on the Legend Lore podcast and cast member on the\
