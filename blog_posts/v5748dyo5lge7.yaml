  \ days away, we wanted to release the new and improved <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Guide to Organized Play</i></a> (version 6.0) today so everyone\
  \ has an opportunity to review it and discuss it before Gen Con. With the help of\
  \ the Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants, we have added several much-needed\
  \ changes that we think will improve your experiences in Pathfinder Society play.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Most notably, the following changes will go into effect on August 14\
  \ when Season six kicks off at Gen Con:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Removed aasimar\
  \ and tielfing as legal race choices. Added kitsune, nagaji, and wayang as legal\
  \ choices.</li> \n     <li>The nation-based factions have transitioned to ideal-based\
  \ factions. These new factions borrow some traits from past factions and introduce\
  \ several new traits. Those who already have faction traits no longer appearing\
  \ in the <i>Guide to Organized Play</i> keep those traits, but they are no longer\
  \ available as options for new characters. If you are currently playing in a online\
  \ game (PbP, VTT, etc..), you may finish the game with your character in its current\
  \ faction. After the game is complete, you should immediately transition to one\
  \ of the newer factions, with the exception of Grand Lodge and Silver Crusade.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Updated the faction goals for season six.</li> \n     <li>Added a new\
  \ section in Chapter Five for special rules pertaining to Season 6, including information\
  \ about time-worn technology and glitches.</li> \n     <li>Updated the shirts available\
  \ for free reolls, including the new ones that go on sale at Gen Con.</li> \n  \
  \   <li>Updated the art throughout to reflect the theme of season six.</li>\n  \
  \  </ul> \n    <p>There are quite a few more changes from version 5.1 to 6.0 so\
  \ make sure to brush up on it before the new season starts.</p> \n    <p>Additionally,\
  \ we have released the update to <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources</a>, including all of July and August books. That means you\
  \ are able to get a few days to decide what new class you want to build from the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a>.</p> \n    <p>Finally,\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\">Quick Start Guide</a> has been updated to reflect\
  \ the color scheme of season six, as well as a few changes in the text to match\
  \ what is listed in the Guide.</p> \n    <p>We look forward to seeing all of the\
  \ awesome VOs, GMs, and players at Gen Con, and are looking forward to an even more\
  \ awesome campaign in the upcoming Year of the Sky Key. We sincerely appreciate\
  \ everyone who provided feedback for the changes to the Guide for working together\
  \ to make our organized play campaign the best itcan be for the player base, GMs,\
  \ coordinators, and Venture-Officers. Feel free to pull us aside at Gen Con to chat\
  \ about any or all of the above changes.</p> \n    <p>Mike Brock and John Compton<br>\
