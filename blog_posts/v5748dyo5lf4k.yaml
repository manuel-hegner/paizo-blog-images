  description\">Most of you probably won't start seriously thinking about Gen Con\
  \ Indy until next week, but for Paizo, it's only a matter of hours away. Many of\
  \ us (including yours truly) leave for the Big Show on Monday morning, making today\
  \ the very last office day before we head out for Indianapolis.</span></p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Logo_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Logo_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Accordingly, I want to make sure we leave you guys\
  \ with an amazing Pathfinder Battles preview! With the formal release of the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of prepainted fantasy\
  \ miniatures less than a week away, we've already revealed all of that set's figures.\
  \ So what's left? Let's look to the future. Let's look to the NEXT set, October's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">LEGENDS OF GOLARION</a>!</p> \n    <p>Unlike many\
  \ of our previous Pathfinder Battles sets, <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends\
  \ of Golarion</a> is not based on a specific Pathfinder Adventure Path. Rather,\
  \ it spans the whole Pathfinder world, and includes characters, monsters, and heroes\
  \ from a wide variety of Pathfinder products going back to the very beginning. This\
  \ gave us a chance to fill a couple of key holes that we haven't plugged with the\
  \ first four Pathfinder Battles sets, and also to visit some key characters and\
  \ creatures we knew we wouldn't otherwise be able to get to for several more sets.\
  \ Generally speaking, the emphasis is a bit more on monsters and Golarion \"types\"\
  \ (such as Hellknights) than on specific characters, but trust me when I say there's\
  \ a little bit of everything in this set.</p> \n    <p>So let's get right to it,\
  \ shall we?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Lini_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Lini_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have one of Pathfinder's most beloved iconic\
  \ characters, Lini! Lini, Gnome Druid, as the figure is called, is our archetypal\
  \ druid, appearing first on the cover of <a href=\"/products/btpy83yw\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #11</a> and then on to the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\">Core\
  \ Rulebook</a> and just about every Pathfinder game book released since then. She's\
  \ got an enormous amount of detail for such a small figure. She is, of course, size\
  \ Small, and she's been slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Sajan_500.jpeg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Sajan_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We continue to fill out the ranks of Pathfinder's iconic\
  \ characters with Sajan, Human Monk. WizKids did an excellent job portraying Sajan\
  \ in a cool fighting pose, and again it's amazing to see how their sculptors and\
  \ painters have managed to work in all of the detail of Wayne Reynolds's ultra-complex\
  \ art for the character. Sajan is a Medium-sized rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Bugbear_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Bugbear_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Bugbears are one of those ubiquitous humanoid creatures\
  \ that never seem to get their due with cool figures in prepainted plastic, even\
  \ though they come up in play again and again. This Bugbear Warrior, inspired by\
  \ the art in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>, is\
  \ a great addition to the humanoid ranks. When partnered with the Bugbear Champion\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> set, the pair\
  \ make the beginnings of a cool bugbear-themed encounter. While this is the only\
  \ bugbear in <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>, there will\
  \ be more in future sets for sure! The Bugbear Warrior is a common figure.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Seugathi_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Seugathi_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>One of my favorite things about this set is that it\
  \ gives us the opportunity to bring a lot of original Pathfinder monsters—not drawn\
  \ from gaming history or real world legend—into prepainted plastic for the first\
  \ time. Such is the case with the frankly disgusting Seugathi, an intelligent wormlike\
  \ monstrosity from the pages of <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\">Bestiary 2</a>. These\
  \ servants of even larger underground worms played a creepy role in James Jacobs's\
  \ \"Shadows Under Sandpoint\" office campaign, and left quite the impression with\
  \ our players. Now, with this amazing miniature, you can creep out your players\
  \ as well! The Seugathi is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Genie.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Genie_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>I dream of a great Djinni miniature. My dreams have delivered.\
  \ This Large rare figure may get my vote for coolest sculpt in the entire set. He\
  \ is definitely a jaw-dropper.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-SandpointDevil_500.jpeg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-SandpointDevil_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And last up in this week of six previews is the hideous\
  \ Sandpoint Devil, a cryptozoological menace of the Sandpoint Hinterlands. This\
  \ figure is very important to me personally for two reasons. First, it's a great\
  \ example of a very specific Pathfinder monster that made his debut in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8ief\">Inner Sea World Guide</a> (and it doesn't hurt that he was\
  \ based on the Jersey Devil of real world myth). Second, and WAAAAY more importantly,\
  \ my unarmored barbarian OSTOG THE UNSLAIN managed to strike the killing blow against\
  \ this thing in James's aforementioned \"Shadows Under Sandpoint\" campaign, and\
  \ this figure will make a fitting desk trophy to commemorate the legendary deeds\
  \ of Golarion's greatest hero. He'll be fun for your players to battle, defeat,\
  \ and make into a trophy as well!</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week. I'm\
  \ ready to get packed and head out to Gen Con! We'll be showing off several more\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a> figures in the Paizo booth\
  \ (#203), including the whole set of October's <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead\
  \ Horde Builder Series</a>. Of course, you'll also be able to buy the new <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> minis, make personal suggestions for\
  \ figures directly to me, and celebrate the best four days in gaming!</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Oh, and we'll also be giving away the promotional Konkrud goblin figure for\
  \ folks who spend $50 or more at the booth, AND we'll also be selling an ADDITIONAL\
  \ Pathfinder Battles goblin repaint we haven't showed off anywhere for folks who\
  \ buy a copy of the newly released <a href=\"/products/btpy8z2v\">Pathfinder: Goblins!\
  \ #1</a> comic book! More details on that special figure from the show floor itself!\
  \ Both promo figures will be available here on paizo.com after the convention.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>See you there!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div>\
