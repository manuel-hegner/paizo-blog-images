  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, October 27, 2008</p> \n   <p>For more than 4,000\
  \ years Absalom has been the City at the Center of the World, a metropolis-sized\
  \ showcase of the greatest treasures in all Golarion. But it wasn't always like\
  \ this.</p> \n   <p>Or was it?</p> \n   <p>Cities aren't born, they're made, usually\
  \ through centuries of back-breaking labor and innumerable hardships. But that isn't\
  \ the case with Absalom. It was brought into the world in a single moment, ready\
  \ to grow, ready to flourish, ready to claim its place as a city-state to rival\
  \ empires. From the earliest records of that miraculous place, recorded in Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tv\"><i>Guide to Absalom</i></a>, comes\
  \ the following account:</p> \n   <p>\"No account exists of Absalom's first moments,\
  \ for Aroden was alone when he raised the Isle of Kortos from the depths and placed\
  \ the <i>Starstone</i> where it is now, marking the focus of what was to become\
  \ the City at the Center of the World. Even in the first centuries of Absalom, when\
  \ Aroden was a common sight in its halls and on its streets, no one claimed to know\
  \ how or why Aroden moved the <i>Starstone</i>, or created its resting place. Some\
  \ believe the Starstone Cathedral is Aroden's greatest construction, while others\
  \ say the <i>Starstone</i> itself built the monument that protects it. The Cathedral\
  \ was finished before a single inhabitant arrived in Absalom, though it has continued\
  \ to grow and expand itself in the centuries since that time. Aroden never answered\
  \ questions put to him about the Cathedral, saying only that any who needed to know\
  \ of it would find the answers themselves.</p> \n   <p>\"Indeed, all records of\
  \ the first few centuries of Absalom are spotty at best. The Founding Law of Absalom,\
  \ the laws which even the Grand Council may not change or remove, were written in\
  \ stone within Azlanti Keep, but no other original documents survive. Four millennia\
  \ of mold, accident, and even intentional sabotage have ruined every book, scroll,\
  \ and tablet kept before 400 AR. While copies of copies claiming to be true to the\
  \ original texts can be found throughout the city, even within Forae Logos different\
  \ editions of texts often disagree with one another. Much of the first millennium\
  \ of Absalom is less history, and more mythology.</p> \n   <p>\"What is clear is\
  \ that Aroden established the location of the city when he placed the <i>Starstone</i>,\
  \ and that doing so took a heavy toll on him. Some myths claim the Isle of Kortos\
  \ belonged to a terrible sea-demon or god of minotaurs, and that Aroden delved into\
  \ a massive labyrinth to face and defeat that original resident. Other legends place\
  \ Absalom as an old outpost of the Azlanti, sunken and brought back from the depths\
  \ by that civilization's last son, and assign that as the reason gillmen continue\
  \ to live in and around the city. Most natives actually assume Aroden raised the\
  \ island up from the depths when he recovered the <i>Starstone</i>, creating it\
  \ from the raw rock and kelp of the sea floor, but no record of this version of\
  \ events can be dated any earlier than 1,450 AR and no record of Aroden himself\
  \ making the claim exists. While this last version of events is official dogma to\
  \ several churches, many serious scholars discount it.\"</p> \n   <p>Pathfinder\
