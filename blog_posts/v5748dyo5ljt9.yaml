  \ by Remko Troost</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As biomechanical\
  \ entities, androids can theoretically live forever with the proper repairs. While\
  \ some embrace this form of immortality, most androids live what they feel is a\
  \ full life—usually around a hundred years—and then voluntarily instigate a process\
  \ called renewal, in which the android's soul leaves its body, allowing a fresh\
  \ android soul to inhabit it. Most people consider this a joyous occasion, metaphorically\
  \ equivalent to the old android giving birth to a child, and understand that a post-renewal\
  \ android is an entirely new person who just happens to inhabit the same body. Yet\
  \ not all people are willing to honor this change or forgive past debts and slights,\
  \ and such is the case with Iseph.</p> \n     <p>Iseph awoke in an abandoned storage\
  \ facility on the machine world of Aballon, standing upright in a black-market renewal\
  \ crèche. Around them, the place was completely empty, save for a note and a pen\
  \ left in the center of the concrete floor. Clearly hastily scrawled, the note read\
  \ only: <i>Run. Hide. Retaliate. Beware the mark.</i> Next to the words was a drawing\
  \ of a symbol—the same inexplicable design branded on Iseph's chest. Yet the biggest\
  \ shock was when Iseph picked up the pen, as the note's writer had clearly intended—\
  for the handwriting on the note matched Iseph's own.</p> \n     <p>Confused and\
  \ disoriented, with only some basic downloaded knowledge of the world they'd just\
  \ been born into, Iseph did as the note instructed, doing their best to disappear\
  \ into Aballon's bustling android population. It was here that, among other things,\
  \ they first met other androids and discovered that some identified with particular\
  \ genders, though Iseph never felt any such personal connection. But the questions\
  \ raised by the note continued to plague them. Who had worn their body before them?\
  \ Who were they running from, and why? What was the mysterious symbol? Eventually,\
  \ Iseph worked up the courage to begin making surreptitious inquiries into the planet's\
  \ infosphere. All of these searches failed, yet in curious ways, as if the information\
  \ was being actively scrubbed and redacted. Worse, Iseph began to get the sense\
  \ of being watched, faces in the crowds that seemed strangely familiar. After a\
  \ month of tentative forays into they city's silicon underworld, Iseph at last tracked\
  \ down someone who claimed to recognize the mark, but who insisted on meeting in\
  \ person at a nearby virus bar.</p> \n     <p>Iseph was almost to the tavern when\
  \ it exploded in a massive fireball, the blast consuming an entire city block.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Thoroughly spooked, Iseph fled Aballon, taking passage on a ship to\
  \ the Diaspora. Yet as they worked there, quickly finding themself a deft hand at\
  \ piloting rock-hopper shuttles and mining tugs, Iseph's fear turned to anger. Wider\
  \ Pact Worlds society proved far messier than Aballon's orderly machine culture,\
  \ and Iseph was first confused and then disgusted by the prejudice and jealousy\
  \ androids still encountered from some humans. They met android escapees from illegal\
  \ colonies in the Vast, bearing blatant symbols of corporate ownership and scars\
  \ from cruel disciplinary implants, and began to suspect what their own mark might\
  \ say about their origins. Incensed, Iseph made contact with the Android Abolitionist\
  \ Front, learning to fly more combat-oriented craft, to sneak through the shadows,\
  \ and to put down the enemies of their people with ruthless efficiency. Under the\
  \ AAF's guidance, Iseph became a black ops expert, until a disagreement with their\
  \ handler over a messy job led them to go independent. Today, Iseph officially hires\
  \ on with freelancer crews as an elite pilot specializing in dangerous transport\
  \ or exploratory missions—and if those jobs sometimes require a little infiltration\
  \ or a bullet from the shadows, well, that costs extra.</p> \n     <p>Though paranoia\
  \ over being hunted by their mysterious enemy (as well as friends of former assassination\
  \ targets) makes Iseph something of a loner, the android desperately craves companionship,\
  \ and is fiercely loyal to those few who prove themselves trustworthy. As a result\
  \ of their early days on Aballon and personal experience as an android in a largely\
  \ biological society, Iseph questions or rejects many aspects of mainstream Pact\
  \ Worlds culture, and enjoys exploring the countercultures on different worlds.\
  \ Iseph believes the ends often justify the means, yet strives to only take on jobs\
  \ that fit with their sense of morality. An initial focus on android rights has\
  \ broadened into a tendency to identify with oppressed people and underdogs everywhere,\
  \ no matter how alien, and to hate any form of slavery with a passion. While Iseph\
  \ finds the most joy in flying any manner of ship or vehicle—usually too fast and\
  \ recklessly for the comfort of their passengers—their infiltration abilities remain\
  \ as sharp as they ever were, and the former assassin has no objections to pulling\
  \ out their trusty sniper rifle again when the cause is just.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
