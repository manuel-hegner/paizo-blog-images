  \      <p>In Kingmaker, your player characters are more than mere adventurers. They\
  \ are destined to become the rulers of the world’s newest kingdom—a nation that\
  \ you get to build from the ground up as the campaign unfolds! In the northeastern\
  \ corner of the sprawling expanse of the River Kingdoms lies an unclaimed wilderness\
  \ known as the Stolen Lands. If your PCs can defeat the bandits and monsters that\
  \ infest the central portion of the Stolen Lands, you’ll be able to establish your\
  \ new nation therein... but this is only the beginning. Rugged mountains, sprawling\
  \ swamps, and tangled forests border your new home on all sides, and as you expand\
  \ into these lands you’ll forge new alliances, clash with new foes, and uncover\
  \ an ancient menace that has long lurked in the overgrown corners of the Stolen\
  \ Lands. But once you’ve claimed your territory, can your party defend this hard-won\
  \ kingdom from war on its borders and supernatural threats from within? Will you\
  \ rule with justice and mercy, or will you become the very monsters you fought to\
  \ oppose? In the <i>Kingmaker Adventure Path,</i> the destiny of the world’s newest\
  \ nation is yours to decide!</p> \n      <p>A stunning 640-page hardcover, the <i>Kingmaker\
  \ Adventure Path</i> provides GMs everything they need to run this epic campaign.\
  \ All six chapters published in 2010 will be updated to Pathfinder Second Edition\
  \ rules—plus a new prologue makes its tabletop debut in this release! Detailed appendices\
  \ provide GMs with flavorful gazetteers of the campaign’s myriad locations, from\
  \ the Stolen Lands at large to the rival city of Pitax.</p> \n      <p>The <i>Kingmaker\
  \ Adventure Path</i> also features complete rules for hex-map exploration, kingdom\
  \ building, and management to bring the campaign’s most innovative elements to life\
  \ at your table. Lastly, a bestiary of new and updated monsters that feature prominently\
  \ in the Adventure Path give GMs of any campaign new tools to torment their player\
  \ characters with! The expanded adventure path also includes new material, including:</p>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li> <i>Barony Expansion:</i> You’ll get a wealth of new\
  \ tools, options, and encounters to complicate your players’ lives during the early\
  \ days of their nation’s foundation. What strange events, dangerous complications,\
  \ and unexpected boons await, and what effect might they have on the nation during\
  \ its tender formative years? </li> \n       <li> <i>Season of Bloom:</i> A strange\
  \ and frightening contagion spreads through your lands—people are getting sick,\
  \ going mad, and ultimately bursting open as horrific monsters emerge from within\
  \ to rampage through the kingdom! Can you cure this strange affliction and bring\
  \ the Season of Bloom to a close before your nation falls apart from within? </li>\
  \ \n       <li> <i>Candlemere Dungeon:</i> The ancient legacy of an eldritch god\
  \ still holds sway. The deadly truths hidden away within the chambers below Candlemere\
  \ will test your PCs to the very limits of sanity and life alike! Are the powerful\
  \ treasures and ancient secrets to be discovered in the sprawling ruins below Candlemere\
  \ worth the dangers your PCs will face, or are some things best left forgotten?\
  \ </li> \n       <li> <i>Cursed King:</i> Take your Kingmaker PCs on their most\
  \ deadly and dangerous adventure ever! With this expansion, the <i>Kingmaker Adventure\
  \ Path</i> will provide enough content for your party of adventurers to reach the\
  \ absolute height of power, finishing the campaign as 20th-level heroes... that\
  \ is, if you can survive these final epic encounters! </li> \n      </ul> \n   \
