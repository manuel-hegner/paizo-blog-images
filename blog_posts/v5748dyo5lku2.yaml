  \ Volunteers, Conventions &amp; More!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, June\
  \ 6, 2018</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  \ style=\"display:none;\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">When we got back from PaizoCon, I asked the\
  \ team to write blurbs about the highlights of PaizoCon. Unfortunately, Linda failed\
  \ her will save and wasn't in the office when I asked, so we will have to include\
  \ her perspective in a different blog. For me, my favorite part of the event is\
  \ interacting with all the players and volunteers. No matter how many long hours\
  \ go into planning and preparing for a convention, seeing attendee's enjoyment makes\
  \ it all worthwhile. But my collegues are more eloquent in their summaries, so I\
  \ turn the blog over to them.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>This was my seventh\
  \ PaizoCon and sixth as an employee (goodness), filled with all sorts of great moments.\
  \ Friday morning opened with the traditional round of Golarionender, a Pathfinder-inspired\
  \ reimagination of Mythender RPG. The PCs successfully Ended Aroden, but in the\
  \ process a new deity of avarice rose from the smoldering ashes of the Isle of Kortos.\
  \ We counted it as a win!</p> \n     <p>We also debuted a series of four Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest quests called The Rose Street Revenge. I ran one set of it, and several\
  \ of my colleagues ran their own renditions over the course of the weekend. The\
  \ story ran pretty smoothly, and I look forward to having it as a demo starting\
  \ at Origins 2018 and beyond. My players for both this and the PaizoCon delve were\
  \ lovely, including one player (a familiar face and recent freelancer) who took\
  \ it well when I had to end one delve a little early in order to make it to a panel—\
  in the process clobbering his character Seelah and then continuing to attack the\
  \ collapsed PC to \"show off how the dying rules work.\"</p> \n     <p>Trivia went\
  \ beautifully, even with the heckling of a growing table of Paizo employees, freelancers,\
  \ and honored observers who survived the ballroom bar's extraordinarily potent tequila-soaked\
  \ pineapples. The winners were Tonya's Tots (briefly Tonya's Orphans when she had\
  \ to leave and then later Tonya's Champions). You can find Painlord's transcription\
  \ of the trivia questions on the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2v5t3&amp;page=4?2018-PFS-PaizoCon-Bloggery-with-Pathfinder#154\"\
  >PFS Bloggery</a> thread.</p> \n     <p>On Sunday night I gathered a group of Utter\
  \ Jackals for <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899C-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-C\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Special #8-99C: The Solstice Scar</i></a>, which went pretty\
  \ smoothly. Although we had lost a few members of our team from last year, we easily\
  \ recruited a few more to give our GM Andrew Geels a bit of a scare. We may not\
  \ have completed a lot of encounters, but our primary goals—sassing each other,\
  \ howling like maenads, and not getting kicked out by Tonya—were a success. I learned\
  \ from some of the Tier 10-11 tables that there's one encounter in particular that\
  \ needs some tweaking, so keep an eye out on the product page for an update.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My best experience all weekend, though, was easily the pick-up game\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-09: Live Exploration Extreme!</i></a> that I\
  \ ran on Friday night. Normally PaizoCon's Friday evening is my opportunity to play\
  \ at a random table, but I learned in the afternoon that the slot was sold out but\
  \ might have an unused table. Figuring my only way to be in a game would be to run\
  \ one, I pulled together a few folks as players (Lyz Liddell, Thurston Hillman,\
  \ and Jenny Jarzabski) and then left the other three slots open to accommodate walk-ups.\
  \ We got three buddies wanting to play together (Jeff, Brad, and Paul), and none\
  \ of them had ever played Starfinder Society before. It turned out beautifully with\
  \ five of the table playing 4th-level Obozaya (a large set of siblings) and the\
  \ other playing 4th-level \"O-bo-Raia.\" Our newcomers jumped into the game and\
  \ the weird party composition almost immediately, and the Raia player was an absolute\
  \ saint in putting up with the vesks' shenanigans. Apparently we were audible across\
  \ the busy ballroom every time we put out hands in the middle of the table and shouted\
  \ \"O-BO-ZAYA!\" as if hyping ourselves before a sports match.</p> \n     <p>I'm\
  \ partway through a lengthy summary for the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2v5t3?2018-PFS-PaizoCon-Bloggery-with-Pathfinder\"\
  >2018 PFS PaizoCon Bloggery</a> thread, where you'll be able to find many of the\
  \ frightful details. Again, heartfelt kudos to those three strangers who helped\
  \ make the game so amazing.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play Lead\
  \ Developer</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Despite the conventions' best attempts\
  \ to take him out, Michael managed to overcome all adversity and emerge from the\
  \ experience victorious:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>This was my first PaizoCon\
  \ as an employee and oh my goodness, what an adventure! Several adventures, really.\
  \ I got to meet PFS officers and agents from around the country and beyond Thursday\
  \ night to kick off the convention. Friday was an opportunity to stuff swag bags\
  \ for the attendees, run and assist with the Pathfinder Playtest delve, and join\
  \ the master of monsters Adam Daigle and special guest Taylor Fischer for a Concepting\
  \ Monsters panel, and that evening I ran my lottery game, Broken Lattice, for an\
  \ amazing group of players who slew vrocks, rode half-celestial unicorns, and slew\
  \ a qlippoth in its home on a magma-ridden level of the Abyss. Saturday was fairly\
  \ similar, but I had more opportunities to hang out in the PFS room and chat with\
  \ some of the players who had traveled from all over to be there, which was fantastic.\
  \ Unfortunately, I was struck down with some as-yet-undiagnosed-but-probably-food-related\
  \ illness that left me out of commission for most of Sunday, but I did manage to\
  \ climb my way to the Cascade rooms for my second and final lottery game. Despite\
  \ my being under the weather, everyone was game to tackle the adventure and I once\
  \ more had an excellent time taking some fantastic players on a tour of the planar\
  \ causeways.</p> \n     <p>To sum up, I had an amazing time, ran a delve, participated\
  \ on a panel, played games with awesome people from around the world, and was then\
  \ devastated by wracking illness. I'm told that this means I had a pretty standard\
  \ PaizoCon, so hopefully I'll get to do <i>most</i> of this again next year!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Michael Sayre<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <h2>Campaign\
  \ Coin</h2> \n    <p>Traveling around the world allows me to meet and interact with\
  \ lots of our players and volunteers. It also means I hear lots of stories about\
  \ fantastic members of our community who give of their time and labors to plan organized\
  \ play activities in their areas. It is my pleasure to recognize some of these society\
  \ stalwarts! The first three were given at PaizoCon the last weekend of May. I announced\
  \ the other two at UK Games Expo, but we are withholding their names until their\
  \ RVCs can deliver the coins and make the announcements. Once that is done, I will\
  \ reveal them here.</p> \n    <table class=\"table-spacing-large\">\n     <tbody>\

  \ \n    <h2>Stars and Novas</h2> \n    <p>With convention season underway, the opportunities\
  \ for GMing abound and the ranks of 5-star GMs grows. Huge congratulations to all\
  \ those that achieved their fifth star over the past month!</p> \n    <p>To achieve\
  \ this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique\
  \ scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain.\
  \ A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM\
  \ listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder\
  \ Society games! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Robyn\
  \ Allen</li> \n     <li>Walter Chao</li> \n     <li>Vincent Sarah</li> \n     <li>Scott\

  \ \n    <p>We still have badges and rooms available for Gen Con volunteers. If you\
  \ are interested in volunteering to run Pathifner Socity or Starfinder Society events,\
  \ please visit the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/pxUyPSyeIK9dfwbl2\" target=\"\
  _blank\"><u>Gen Con 2018 volunteer questionnaire</u></a> for more information and\
  \ to register.</p> \n    <h2>Gen Con Event Update</h2> \n    <p>I submitted the\
  \ last of the games and all the seminars for Gen Con and they should post soon.\
  \ We also pulled the ticket sales data and I'm working with Bob Jonquet to figure\
  \ out if we can add more tables to any of the events. If you tried to get into a\
  \ game and found it sold out, please check back next week to see if more seats are\
  \ available.</p> \n    <h2>Conventions</h2> \n    <p>Want to attend a convention\
  \ this summer? Check out the list below! I've updated the list with all the event\
  \ support requests I've received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer\
  \ and have them submit a request for support or email me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the\
  \ list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or\
  \ Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check\
  \ out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>\
