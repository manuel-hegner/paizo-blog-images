  \ target=\"_blank\">BoardGameGeek.com</a> has been an extraordinarily fruitful discussion\
  \ site for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. After its release in late August,\
  \ the Rise of the Runelords base set had an epic run at #1 in the Hotness, and has\
  \ stayed in the top ten ever since. It's had over half a million page views. The\
  \ game just got into <a href=\" http://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame?sort=rank&amp;rankobjecttype=subtype&amp;rankobjectid=1&amp;rank=50#50\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the all-time top 50 games</a> and <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/thematic/browse/boardgame?sort=rank&amp;rankobjecttype=family&amp;rankobjectid=5496&amp;rank=5#5\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the top 5 thematic games</a> only a couple months out of the\
  \ gate. And just like the folks on the Paizo messageboards, the commenters at BGG\
  \ were tremendously helpful in helping us get the wording right on <a href=\" http://paizo.com/download/pathfinder/PZO6000-Rulebook.zip\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">an updated version of the PACG rulebook</a> (click to download).</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>So we decided we'd go see the folks responsible for all that activity.\
  \ Next week in Dallas, most of the development team—myself and developers Chad Brown,\
  \ Tanis O'Connor, and Paul Peterson—will bring the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ to <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/bggcon\" target=\"_blank\">BoardGameGeek.Con</a>.\
  \ And we're doing something special with our game for the BGG crowd. We're going\
  \ to play <i>all of it</i>.</p> \n    <p>Yup, the whole adventure path, from <i>Burnt\
  \ Offerings</i> to <i>The Spires of Xin-Shalast</i>, an adventure that won't be\
  \ out for six months. That's 30 straight scenarios in five days. If you want a preview\
  \ of what's coming, come see us there. We'll have a signup sheet that rotates players\
  \ in and out; we want as many people as possible to get a chance to see the new\
  \ awesome. Plus, we'll be running demos for new players as well. Should be a blast.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So buckle up, Texas. The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is headed your\
  \ way.</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Designer, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>P.S.</b> I've put an autographed PACG base set up for charity auction\
  \ on <a href=\"http://desertbus.org\" target=\"_blank\">Desert Bus for Hope</a>,\
  \ benefiting <a href=\" http://www.childsplaycharity.org\">Child's Play</a>. The\
  \ auction will start at roughly <b>11 pm PDT on Saturday, November 16</b>. The winner\
  \ of the auction will get the game plus me. I'll either Skyping into your game session\
  \ or playing with you in person if you can get to Seattle. Desert Bus is a little\
  \ odd, in that everyone who wants an item puts in a nominal donation at the specific\
  \ time the item is live, and then gets a chance at the prize. We'd like to raise\
  \ some money for kids in hospitals and victims of domestic abuse, so if you're at\
  \ all interested, <a href=\"http://desertbus.org/giveaway/220\" target=\"_blank\"\
