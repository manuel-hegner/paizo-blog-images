  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Here we are, growing\
  \ ever closer to the release of the game with Ezren rounding out the preview of\
  \ the 11 core classes. As one of my favorite classes, I save the wizard for last.\
  \ When we first started working on the class, back in the Alpha version of the game,\
  \ the initial thought was to treat arcane school specialization like cleric domains\
  \ in some regards, with the school granting limited power to add some real flavor\
  \ and depth to an otherwise straightforward class. This left us with a balance issue,\
  \ though, and that was what to do with the universalist wizard (the wizard without\
  \ a specialty). We couldn't just remove him, as he is an iconic part of the game\
  \ (literally, Ezren is a universalist) and we couldn't just give him the same powers\
  \ as the specialists (as we did in the Beta playtest), so we had to search for a\
  \ middle ground.</p> \n   <p>In the final version of the game, wizards with an arcane\
  \ school receive bonus spells, much as they did in 3.5, but universalists do not.\
  \ That said, the universalist school does grant a pair of powers. The first is the\
  \ ever-popular hand of the apprentice. This power has undergone some significant\
  \ redesign since the Beta, where it was arguably a bit too good (and quite confusing).\
  \ The new power reads as follows.</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p><i>Hand of the Apprentice\
  \ (Su):</i> You cause your melee weapon to fly from your grasp and strike a foe\
  \ before instantly returning to you. As a standard action, you can make a single\
  \ attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This attack is treated as a\
  \ ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your Intelligence modifier\
  \ on the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier (damage still relies on\
  \ Strength). This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver. You can use\
  \ this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\
  \ \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>This new ability works off the ranged attack rules,\
  \ making it simpler to use and adjudicate than the previous system, which was full\
  \ of odd rules exceptions. The second ability also caused a bit of trouble in the\
  \ Beta playtest. Metamagic mastery now allows the wizard to add a metamagic feat\
  \ to a spell without increasing the spell level, but it does come with some restrictions.\
  \ First, it can only be used 1/day at 8th level and one additional time per day\
  \ for every two levels beyond 8th. Adding a feat to a spell that would increase\
  \ the spell's level by more than 1 uses up an additional use of the ability for\
  \ each level beyond one (i.e., if you Empower a <i>fireball</i>, it would use up\
  \ two uses of this ability). Finally, you cannot add a metamagic feat to a spell\
  \ using this ability if that feat would have made the spell higher level than a\
  \ level of spell that you are capable of casting.</p> \n   <p>I do want to take\
  \ a moment to talk about some of the other arcane schools before moving on to spells\
  \ themselves. Many of the schools got a bit of a revamp, most due to playtester\
  \ feedback. Take the necromancy school for example. The core power of this school\
  \ now allows a necromancer to control or turn undead (as per the feats) a number\
  \ of times per day, meaning that a necromancer does not necessarily have to be evil\
  \ (the white necromancy option). We also changed the way that wizards with an arcane\
  \ school interact with their prohibited schools. They can now learn and cast these\
  \ spells just like any other wizard; however, when they prepare them, spells from\
  \ a wizard's prohibited school take up two slots instead of one. For example, a\
  \ 6th-level wizard with three 3rd-level spell spots could use two of them to prepare\
  \ a <i>dispel magic</i> spell, even if abjuration was one of his prohibited schools.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Moving on, let's take a look at some of Ezren's spells. There have been\
  \ some modifications to a wide variety of spells and effects to make them a bit\
  \ more balanced with one another. Take <i>teleport</i>, for example. In 3.5 you\
  \ could use <i>scry</i> to view a location and then use <i>teleport</i> to get there\
  \ quickly. While this was fun for the players, it could very easily ruin a plot\
  \ or bypass large bits of the adventure. While we did not want to completely eliminate\
  \ this option, we have made it a bit harder. Now when you use <i>scry</i> to view\
  \ a location, it only counts as \"viewed once\" for the purposes of <i>teleport</i>,\
  \ making it quite a bit more risky to cast (25% chance of something going wrong).</p>\
  \ \n   <p><i>Wall of force</i> has seen some changes as well (as have all of the\
  \ spells that create force bubbles or other effects). These force walls now have\
  \ a hardness of 30 and 20 hit points per caster level. While this means that they\
  \ are almost impossible to break down, they can no longer be used to hold back the\
  \ tarrasque or a lava flow, which was asking for a bit much out of a 5th-level spell.\
  \ This also means that if a <i>wall of force</i> cuts off half the party, they have\
  \ a chance to destroy it without having to resort to a <i>disintegrate</i> (which\
  \ still instantly destroys the wall).</p> \n   <p><i>Fly</i>, and other spells like\
  \ it, now grants a built-in bonus to Fly skill checks, to help compensate for characters\
  \ without any ranks in the skill. They will not be doing loops around dragons anytime\
  \ soon, but they at least try to pull a 45-degree turn at full speed in an emergency.\
  \ <i>Web</i> has seen some changes as well. This spell now works as a grapple, with\
  \ those that fail their saves being caught by the sticky strands. Those that make\
  \ it can move with a combat maneuver or escape artist check (DC = to the DC of the\
  \ spell). Characters moving through the webs that fail their checks are grappled\
  \ in the first square that they enter, whereas those that make it can move through\
  \ the difficult terrain. The spell is still good and useful to control the battlefield,\
  \ but it is no longer the combat-ender that it once was. <i>Ray of enfeeblement</i>\
  \ was sort of in the same boat, as a spell that was a bit too good for its level.\
  \ To balance it out a bit, the spell now allows a Fort save to reduce the Strength\
  \ penalty by half. Other spells on Ezren's list have seen some shifts as well, such\
  \ as <i>ice storm</i> and <i>dispel magic</i> (both of which we covered in the Seoni\
  \ preview).</p> \n   <p>You might have noticed that Ezren does not have a familiar.\
  \ Instead, he chose to bond with his cane, using the arcane bond class feature (which\
  \ allows you to get a familiar if you want). This ability allows him to cast any\
  \ one spell that he knows and is capable of casting, once per day without having\
  \ the spell prepared. He can also enchant his cane as if he had the feats required,\
  \ so long as he is of the minimum level to get the feat (such as 11th level for\
  \ a staff using Craft Staff, or 7th level using Forge Ring). Such power does not\
  \ come without a price though, as Ezren must make concentration checks to cast any\
  \ spell if he does not have his cane in hand.</p> \n   <p>Before I close things\
  \ out on this preview, I wanted to point out a bit about Ezren's feats. Ezren has\
  \ Combat Casting, which means that he has a total of +20 on his concentration checks,\
  \ which means that he can defensively cast his 5th-level spells by rolling a 5 or\
  \ higher on his checks. Ezren's Arcane Strike feat allows him to spend a swift action\
  \ to add a +3 bonus to damage with his cane for 1 round, which he can combine with\
  \ the hand of the apprentice ability to give it a bit of power. You might also notice\
  \ that Ezren has a rather high Combat Maneuver Defense (or CMD). This is because\
  \ of the Defensive Combat Training feat, which allows him to treat his character\
  \ level as his base attack bonus when calculating his CMD, making this feat handy\
  \ for wizards and sorcerers.</p> \n   <p>There are only two more previews left to\
  \ go before the release of the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"><i>Core\
  \ Rulebook</i></a>. Since we are done with the core classes, next week we are going\
  \ to take a look at Seltyiel, our iconic eldritch knight!</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br>\
