  \ Special: Let Me Tell You About Our Characters</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday,\
  \ August 14, 2013</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"\
  ><p>This week marks my 19th consecutive annual appearance at Gen Con, and my 15th\
  \ as a professional in the gaming field. As a fan, Gen Con is literally what they\
  \ say on the tin: The Best Four Days of Gaming. For professionals, it's a chance\
  \ to reconnect with old friends and colleagues, and a great way to recharge the\
  \ batteries. It's an open secret that work in the RPG field can be tedious and frustrating\
  \ at times. Meeting all the great players and fans is an excellent way to remind\
  \ yourself why all of the late hours and crushing deadlines are worth it. Hearing\
  \ from you about how much Pathfinder means to you and your friends literally keeps\
  \ us going, and even though we work harder this week than any other in the whole\
  \ year, we always come back reinvigorated and ready to take on the next challenge.</p></span>\
  \ \n     <p>This year, I'm pleased to announce that the original artist of the <a\
  \ href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\">Pathfinder\
  \ comic</a>, Andrew Huerta, will be at the Paizo booth all weekend long to sign\
  \ comics and sketch player characters. Last year, as he sketched heroes for happy\
  \ Gen Con attendees, I worked with Andrew to create special presents for many of\
  \ my fellow Paizo campaigners by having him draw several of our characters.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Since it's a long-running joke among game business pros that it can\
  \ be dangerous to let a fan trap you in a conversation about his characters, I figure\
  \ I'd preemptively tell you about OUR characters and show off Andrew's work from\
  \ last year. If you like what you see, swing by booth #203 and he'll be happy (for\
  \ a reasonable fee) to create an image of your favorite character. </p> \n     <p>Here\
  \ are some of mine, broken down by the campaign in question.</p> \n     <h1>Shadows\
  \ Under Sandpoint/Sands of the Scorpion God</h1> \n     <p>This is, for my money,\
  \ <i>THE</i> Paizo editorial campaign. I say that not just because it is the longest-running\
  \ ever campaign played at the office, and not just because it involves more than\
  \ a dozen players over three distinct campaign arcs. No, I say it because of all\
  \ the games currently running at Paizo, this is the one that <i>I</i> play in, so\
  \ of course it is the most important to ME.</p> \n     <p>Anyway, it's brilliant.\
  \ Our Creative Director James Jacobs launched the campaign years ago with a sprawling\
  \ campaign centered around Varisia's town of Sandpoint and the nearby Devil's Platter.\
  \ It started with investigating a haunted house on the outskirts of town and ended\
  \ with a battle against the dreaded Sandpoint Devil and the conclusion of a huge\
  \ dungeon crawl near its lair. About a year ago, around when we were about 10th\
  \ level, James split the extremely large group into two different games running\
  \ parallel to one another on different days of the week. My half turned into \"\
  Sands of the Scorpion God,\" which is sort of James's way of saying \"Gary Gygax's\
  \ Necropolis,\" a diabolical campaign adventure set in Ancient Egyptian lands (or,\
  \ in the case of Golarion, Osirion). James has made numerous modifications to the\
  \ already insanely deadly super-adventure, and even though we're now all 15th level,\
  \ there's still plenty of adventuring left to do.</p> \n     <p>Here are the group's\
  \ heroes, starting with the most important (to me).</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Ostog.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Ostog_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have MY character, the barbarian\
  \ <b>Ostog the Unslain</b>. Ostog uses the savage barbarian archetype from the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\">Advanced Player's Guide</a> and a few other tricks\
  \ to pull off the shirtless barbarian look so common on book covers and in media,\
  \ but which prior to Pathfinder was almost always doomed to failure in the Armor\
  \ Class department. </p> \n     <p>Ostog is arrogant but good-hearted, boastful\
  \ but dependable (for the most part). He wields the magic sword <i>Gnarlfang</i>,\
  \ a <i>+1 keen frost greatsword</i> in desperate need of a better enhancement bonus.\
  \ James tells me that there are probably about a dozen game sessions left in Sands\
  \ of the Scorpion God. Ostog has already survived 42 game sessions without wearing\
  \ any armor. Only. A few. Sessions. Left. I'm confident I can make it, thanks in\
  \ no small part to Ostog's fantastic companions.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Styrian.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Styrian_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>This is Editor-in-Chief F. Wesley Schneider's bard, <b>Styrian Kindler</b>.\
  \ In the course of our examinations under Sandpoint, we discovered several half-formed\
  \ clones of Styrian, so none of us is really sure if the one in our party is the\
  \ original or simply some knock-off copy of an original that we've never met. For\
  \ his part, Wes is quiet and cagey about our theories, quickly turning the topic\
  \ to other subjects to avoid such delicate discussions.</p> \n     <p>More importantly\
  \ to me, Styrian is the group's historian and chronicler. Ostog is always shouting\
  \ to Styrian to \"remember this for my saga!\", but it seems like Styrian seldom\
  \ writes anything down about these great feats. It must be because he has such a\
  \ great memory.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Howell.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Howell_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>PaizoCon founder and designated F.O.P. (Friend of Paizo)\
  \ Tim Nightengale plays one of the group's most amusing characters, <b>Howell Talbot\
  \ III</b>, paladin of Abadar. Tim plays Howell with the perfect voice of Mr. Howell,\
  \ the Gilligan's Island character most likely to worship Abadar. Howell is good\
  \ for clearing up Ostog's \"witch's trails\" when he spends too much time cavorting\
  \ with the wrong element during the group's increasingly frequent teleportation\
  \ trips back to civilization. Ostog doesn't have much appreciation for the wealth-obsessed\
  \ cult of Abadar, but over 40+ sessions both Ostog and Erik are in awe of Howell's\
  \ mighty powers. With frequent use of his smite evil ability, Howell is likely the\
  \ highest melee damage vector in the party, and I asked Andrew to convey real martial\
  \ mastery in his depiction.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Velmarius.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Velmarius_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>When Ostog is getting in trouble in the,\
  \ um, \"festhalls\" of civilization, he is often in the company of the group's able\
  \ Chelaxian sorcerer, <b>Velmarius Elazarin</b>, played expertly by Lead Designer\
  \ Jason Bulmahn. Jason is one of my favorite types of players—a guy who knows the\
  \ rules and tactics perfectly every time, but who never lets the sheer mechanics\
  \ of a situation get in the way of a good experience at the table. I've seen Jason\
  \ make sub-optimal tactical and even character advancement choices simply to stay\
  \ in character, and I think that's great.</p> \n     <p>I do wish he (the <i>character</i>\
  \ to be clear) was a bit less of a bastard, but he does take Ostog to the nicest\
  \ places in town on our days off…</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     \
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Thalestris.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Thalestris_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p><a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path</a> developer Rob McCreary doesn't like to play the same\
  \ character for too long. He's the most recent addition to the group, and yet he's\
  \ changed characters three times. His latest, the Taldan gunslinger <b>Thalestris</b>,\
  \ pictured above, has had a tougher run than most in Gary Gygax's Necropolis, even\
  \ managing to have her soul sucked out of her body.</p> \n     <p>Naturally, Rob\
  \ started talking about making a new character at this point. Since Thalestris is,\
  \ by far, the highest damage-dealing character in the party, it doesn't suit my\
  \ interests to let him change into something else. Thus I paid Andrew Huerta money\
  \ to draw and color a picture of Thalestris, and Rob is too guilty about the situation\
  \ to make a change.</p> \n     <p>So the plan is a success, is what I'm saying.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Kirin.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Kirin_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p><b>Kirin the Heretic</b> is Senior Editor James L. Sutter's\
  \ ill-fated atheist rogue. This masked fellow, prone to sleeping in alleyways, left\
  \ the group during the switch between James Jacobs's major campaign arcs, but his\
  \ presence can still be felt now and again. He made enemies with the Sanpoint-area\
  \ mothman known as the Red Bishop, and he was poisoned more times than the rest\
  \ of the party put together.</p> \n     <p>When last Ostog saw Kirin, the rogue\
  \ was babbling on about traveling to Absalom to take the Test of the Starstone.\
  \ I'd like to think he was ultimately successful, and that the only reason we haven't\
  \ seen a new god appear on the list is that Kirin was such an atheist he turned\
  \ it down.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Vorn.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Vorn_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>This here is <b>Vorn</b>, a cleric of Gorum played by Sean\
  \ K. Reynolds. Vorn was the only player character to actually die in Shadow Under\
  \ Sandpoint (he got better), and at the conclusion of that arc Vorn moved into the\
  \ other weekly group, who are exploring a nearby Egyptian-themed adventure completely\
  \ different from the one our group is exploring. </p> \n     <p>Did I mention that\
  \ Vorn is the combined group's only cleric? And that we're on an adventure called\
  \ \"Necropolis,\" which is filled with the expected number of undead, which is to\
  \ say \"all of them\". So not having a cleric has been something of a liability\
  \ for us. I'm sure he's doing great for the other team, and since Vorn and Ostog\
  \ usually got along well (he was the original cure for Ostog's Witch's Trails),\
  \ I miss him a ton.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Zandu.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/SUS-Zandu_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>This is <b>Zandu Vorcyon</b>, the ghoul-hating ranger creation\
  \ of Paizo Editor Christopher Paul Carey. Zandu was Chris's first Pathfinder character,\
  \ and he managed to make it all the way through the Shadows Under Sandpoint campaign\
  \ before bowing out at the switchover due to time constraints. It was really fun\
  \ and interesting to throw a first-time player into our group of seasoned veterans,\
  \ and Chris always brought a freshness and interesting beginner approach to his\
  \ character in a way that greatly enhanced the campaign. I just love the way Andrew\
  \ Huerta captured this character.</p> \n     <h1>Kings of Absalom</h1> \n     <p>With\
  \ all eight characters from James's campaign covered, I knew I still had two illustrations\
  \ to get out of the way before my task was complete. The first would be for James\
  \ Jacobs, our stalwart Game Master, without whom none of these characters would\
  \ exist. But he's the GM, so which character to illustrate? Sure there were villains\
  \ and NPCs aplenty, but none of them struck me as equal in cool-factor to an illustration\
  \ of a player character. </p> \n     <p>To do that, I would need to switch from\
  \ Sands of the Scorpion God to another campaign—my own. Kings of Absalom started\
  \ last summer as a way for me to play Pathfinder with as many friends as possible.\
  \ I design enough material to cover 4 or 5 sessions, play the adventure with a team\
  \ of 5 friends, and then put the campaign on pause while I run several other groups\
  \ of 5 players through the same adventure, roughly at the same time. I debuted my\
  \ first installment, \"The Lowest of the Low,\" last year, casting the heroes in\
  \ the roles of prisoners in a duergar mining colony far below the streets of Absalom.\
  \ Up first was a group of Paizo pals (James Jacobs, Jeff Alvarez, James Sutter,\
  \ Rob McCreary, and Wes Schneider). After they finished, I moved on to other groups\
  \ of friends, and I've now run the event five times.</p> \n     <p>I haven't managed\
  \ to debut this year's installment yet, but it's a major project for when I get\
  \ back from Gen Con and have a little more time to dedicate to fun rather than work.\
  \ Here is one character from my Paizo group: James Jacobs's Shensen.</p> \n    \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/KoA-Shensen.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/KoA-Shensen_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p><b>Shensen</b> is one of James's favorite characters,\
  \ a veteran of many campaigns. This time around the half-elf is a dawnflower dervish\
  \ bard. She's smart, charismatic, and a bit impulsive. Like almost all of the characters\
  \ mentioned above, you can find out more about her background in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8dhe\">NPC Guide</a>. That version reflects a much higher-level character\
  \ than the one currently running around in the caves below Absalom, but a lot of\
  \ the broad strokes are the same. Of all of Andrew's illustrations, this one is\
  \ among my absolute favorites.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/KoA-Zarzeny.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/KoA-Zarzeny_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The last image is a special one for me,\
  \ since it represents <b>Zarzeny</b>, the rogue character played by my girlfriend,\
  \ Danica. Zarzeny is Danica's first Pathfinder character, created to adventure with\
  \ long-time players like Jason Bulmahn in my local Seattle campaign. Danica started\
  \ off a bit nervous, but it's been hilarious to see her develop into the sort of\
  \ kleptomaniac thief character most of us are so familiar with. She's always the\
  \ character pushing the group to violate a sacred crypt (\"hey, there may be treasure\
  \ in there!\") or ambush an NPC whose pockets appear to be laden with treasure.\
  \ She absconded with at least one piece of hugely cursed treasure pilfered from\
  \ said crypt (the only character out of 25 to do so, I might add) simply because\
  \ she decided her character was greedy and she doesn't have the experience with\
  \ the game to know when she is being set up for a fall. I can't wait for the other\
  \ shoe to drop!</p> \n     <p>So, those are our characters, illustrated by Pathfinder\
  \ comics artist Andrew Huerta. Be sure to stop by booth #203 this weekend at Gen\
  \ Con to get your own original illustrations, and feel free to use the comment thread\
  \ here to tell us about YOUR favorite characters.</p> \n     <p>We're all ears,\
  \ at least until the end of the convention.</p> \n     <p>And if you do stop by\
  \ the booth, please be sure to say hi to our staff. We love hearing your thoughts\
  \ on the game, where we should take it, and yes, we even like hearing about your\
  \ characters.</p> \n     <p>See you soon!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
