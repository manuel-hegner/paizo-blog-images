  \  <p>Last month, we highlighted Croatia, Bosnia, and Slovenia, and Venture-Captain\
  \ Zrinka Znidarcic's efforts to grow Pathfinder Society there. We now shift our\
  \ focus back to the northwest and the land of the Dutch. I present to you, Venture-Captain\
  \ Auke Teeninga's report on Pathfinder Society in the Netherlands.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>The Netherlands is a small country in northwest Europe. It borders the\
  \ North Sea to the north and west, Belgium to the south, and Germany to the east,\
  \ and shares maritime borders with the United Kingdom. The country's capital is\
  \ Amsterdam and the seat of government is The Hague. The Netherlands, in its entirety,\
  \ is often referred to as Holland, although North and South Holland are actually\
  \ only two of its twelve provinces. The Netherlands is a geographically low-lying\
  \ country, with about 25% of its area and 21% of its population located below sea\
  \ level, and its name literally means \"Low Country.\"</p> \n    <p>In 1602 the\
  \ Dutch East India Company was established. This chartered company is often considered\
  \ to have been the first multinational corporation in the world and was the first\
  \ company to issue stock. Its mercantile fleets challenged the best in the world\
  \ for supremacy, and due to the companies success the Netherlands, enjoyed a so-called\
  \ \"Golden Age\" of prosperity. Rembrandt van Rijn, Frans Hals, and Johannes Vermeer\
  \ perfected their crafts. Christian Huygens and Anton van Leeuwenhoek made amazing\
  \ discoveries in science. Cities like Amsterdam, Leiden, Utrecht, and Delft started\
  \ to grow, and their distinctive canals were dug to provide both infrastructure\
  \ and defensive capabilities.</p> \n    <p>Nowadays, these same cities are still\
  \ used as a home base for expeditions. Multiple times each month, teams of explorers\
  \ from the Pathfinder Society are sent to Golarion to search ancient ruins, collect\
  \ art and artifacts, and gather knowledge to bring back to the Grand Lodge of Absalom.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I started playing Pathfinder Society at GenCon UK in 2008, and continued\
  \ to do so at various conventions in the United Kingdom. I wanted to share my enjoyment\
  \ (and cut back on flight costs to the UK), so I started organizing regular games\
  \ in the Netherlands in 2010. The Dutch Pathfinder Society has been growing ever\
  \ since, and currently we've got more than two dozen active players, half of which\
  \ GM regularly. I've got big plans for 2013, which includes a multi-day, multi-table,\
  \ Pathfinder Society-only convention like PaizoCon UK, and get players from across\
  \ Europe to join and share their Pathfinder experience, while at the same time helping\
  \ us to grow our player base.</p> \n    <p>Although we have a few stores in the\
  \ Netherlands willing to host Pathfinder Society games, most of games are run from\
  \ private homes. The games, however, are open to everyone (as long as they RSVP)\
  \ and no one has been turned down yet!</p> \n    <p>In the Netherlands there are\
  \ also quite a few roleplaying conventions, and the Pathfinder Society presence\
  \ at these conventions is increasing slowly but steadily. Some of these conventions\
  \ include:</p> \n    <p>Ei-Con, Leiden<br> V-Con, Vleuten<br> K-Con, Delft<br> Meetup,\
  \ Utrecht &amp; Amsterdam</p> \n    <p>If you live in the Netherlands and are interested\
  \ in trying out Pathfinder Society Organized Play, join the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pathfinder-society-nl\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Society NL forum on Google Groups</a> or send an\

  \ and store owners interested in hosting Pathfinder Society events should send an\
