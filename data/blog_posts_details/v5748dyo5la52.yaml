  artist: "exploring one section of Golarion's most important city: Absalom. This\
    \ vast metropolis sits on the isle of Kortos in the great Inner Sea, making it\
    \ of vital importance to the region. Gallery of Evil specifically focuses on the\
    \ Ivy District, known as being home to many of the city's most influential artists\
    \ and craftsmen. It's only natural, then, that the adventure focuses on the darker\
    \ side of art, with one crazed master turning his works loose on his unsuspecting\
    \ critics. Over the next few weeks, we will explore some of this module with a\
    \ bit more depth, but for now, here's one of our favorite art pieces and the teaser\
