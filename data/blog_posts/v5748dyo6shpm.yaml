  \ \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> has released, opening up not\
  \ just brave new frontiers of exploration, but also unleashing a wealth of new character\
  \ options to enable your PCs’ space-traveling hijinks! Each character class receives\
  \ two pages of fresh possibilities. While creating these new operative exploits,\
  \ mystic connections, and more, our authors and development team considered what\
  \ challenges PCs often face when investigating an unfamiliar site, culture, or environment,\
  \ as well as the ways wilderness-focused adventures open up new opportunities for\
  \ dynamic encounters and novel PC tactics. Let’s take a look!</p> \n      <h4>Surviving\
  \ the Great, Itchy Outdoors</h4> \n      <p>Your armor’s environmental protections\
  \ might shield you from the worst temperature fluctuations and breathability issues,\
  \ yet wilderness adventures are rife with other threats and nuisances. This rain\
  \ is messing up my ranged attacks. Is that plant poisonous, venomous, carnivorous,\
  \ or all of the above? How are we supposed to survive on this planet with high gravity\
  \ and constant lightning strikes? Also, gah, how did swamp water get into my powered\
  \ armor?!</p> \n      <p>Fortunately, we have a wealth of tools for identifying,\
  \ surviving, and even exploiting environmental hazards. The mechanic packs a new\
  \ trick called <b>sample scanner</b>, which lets you plug small material samples\
  \ into your exocortex and have it analyze the material to tell you everything you\
  \ want to know about that weird rock formation or unfamiliar flora you’re investigating.\
  \ Ever had your armor’s environmental protections run dry while you’re halfway across\
  \ a trackless continent? Maybe you want the technomancer’s magic hack <b>extend\
  \ protections</b>, which can recharge your armor’s batteries using leftover spell\
  \ slots. As a witchwarper, why not borrow environmental resistances from an alternate\
  \ version of yourself with the paradigm shift <b>shifting adaptation</b>? Or laugh\
  \ off any hazard with the soldier’s <b>rover fighting style</b>, which helps you\
  \ shrug off discomfort while clambering over just about anything the galaxy throws\
  \ at you.</p> \n      <p>Does that sound too rugged and confident? Would you rather\
  \ play the shaky character who’s entirely unhappy about being cold, wet, unconnected\
  \ to the infosphere, and convinced that everything is out to eat you? To my delight,\
  \ the envoy boasts some delightful new improvisations that turn your shouts of “\
  Aah, what’s that? AAAAH, what’s <em>THAT?!</em>” into powerful tools. Convince animals\
  \ and vermin to leave, thank you very much, with the <b>shoo!</b> improvisation.\
  \ Or signal that something is strange and very wrong with <b>early warning</b>.\
  \ You can even redirect your companions’ readied action triggers, changing these\
  \ to react to a strange new threat with <b>changing circumstances</b>.</p> <a href=\"\

  \ \n      <h4>Getting From Here to There</h4> \n      <p>Alright, we’re alive. Fantastic!\
  \ Now we just need to get to that exploring part. So how exactly are we going to\
  \ navigate this alien wilderness again?</p> \n      <p>Look no further than a host\
  \ of new options dedicated to finding paths through difficult conditions. How about\
  \ your mystic, whose <b>trailblazer connection</b> allows you to bond with environments,\
  \ helping you sense the safest trails through deadly areas? Stuck in mud, pinned\
  \ by a hungry ksarik, spinning helplessly in zero-g, or gazing forlornly at a ravine\
  \ you can’t jump? That sounds like the perfect time for your witchwarper to teleport\
  \ to safety with the <b>dimensional extraction</b> paradigm shift. If piloting a\
  \ vehicle for hours on end sounds tedious, maybe it’s time you snagged that <b>artificial\
  \ pilot</b> mechanic trick, which turns your drone into a capable driver. Or when\
  \ the GM throws hazards in your way, just shout no…by activating new vanguard disciplines\
  \ like <b>blaze a trail</b> (which lets you disintegrate difficult terrain as you\
  \ move through it) or <b>Blast Through</b> (which lets you break huge obstacles\
  \ with remarkable ease).</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/d21632c7-5084-418d-96a8-f4a76ff64ed4/061721_TRAILBLAZINGVANGUARD.png\"\

  \ by Tuan Duaong Chu</p> \n      <h4>We Jump Together!</h4> \n      <p>One of my\
  \ favorite components of wilderness encounters is varying elevation, and the <em>Galaxy\
  \ Exploration Manual</em> provides tons of ways for you to navigate, exploit, and\
  \ just outright enjoy altitude differences.</p> \n      <p>Need a boost? The biohacker\
  \ can learn <b>locomotive adaptation</b> and its advanced version as theorems, granting\
  \ allies climb or swim speeds to navigate difficult obstacles. Once you’re up high,\
  \ your operative might want the <b>high-ground sniper</b> exploit, which gives your\
  \ sniper weapons an extra punch when you strike from above—and let’s not forget\
  \ that wildernesses often involve longer encounter distances, which can make snipers\
  \ really shine!</p> \n      <p>But perhaps my favorite abilities are the ones that\
  \ embrace the inevitable: that PCs eventually need to descend quickly to escape\
  \ trouble or join a melee. Why not do it in style? That biohacker can also learn\
  \ the theorem <b>cushion the blow</b>, which lets you buffer a companion against\
  \ falling damage (or even against incoming bludgeoning attacks). Or just embrace\
  \ the falling damage with the solarian revelation <b>heavy landing</b>, which transfers\
  \ that falling damage into your weapon, allowing you to strike someone with impossible\
  \ force! It’s abilities like these that excite me as I imagine bold character’s\
  \ shouting “Check this out” before pulling some absurd-yet-effective acrobatics.</p>\
