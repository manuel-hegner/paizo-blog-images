  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>When caught stealing in the crusader nation\
  \ of Lastwall, veteran con man Rodrick and his talking sword Hrym expect to weasel\
  \ or fight their way out of punishment. Instead, they find themselves ensnared by\
  \ powerful magic, and given a choice: serve the cause of justice as part of a covert\
  \ team of similarly bound villains—or die horribly. Together with their criminal\
  \ cohorts, Rodrick and Hrym settle in to their new job of defending the innocent,\
  \ only to discover that being a secret government operative is even more dangerous\
  \ than a life of crime...</i></p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <h2>Chapter 3: A Conversation\
  \ Through Bars</h2> \n      <p>Rodrick's experience of the nations around Lake Encarthan\
  \ had given him the impression that it was a land of timbered buildings and towering\
  \ trees and dirt floors, so he'd expected Vellumis to be basically an immense fort.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>It was with great surprise, then, that he turned his head to see a\
  \ gleaming city of marble domes, immense archways, glistening white walls, and elaborately\
  \ carved eaves. While Vellumis didn't match the majesty of Absalom, or even his\
  \ home city of Almas, it was without a doubt a <i>real city</i>, and Rodrick felt\
  \ himself begin to relax for the first time in weeks. Yes, he was a prisoner, and\
  \ if he couldn't talk his way out of his predicament, Hrym would have to freeze\
  \ a great number of noble crusaders to allow Rodrick to escape. But still, this\
  \ was a <i>city</i>, the kind of place where he was most at home, the kind of place\
  \ where great things could happen, the kind of place where fools and their money\
  \ could be most expeditiously parted.</p> \n      <p>The cart curved around the\
  \ outskirts of the city until it finally approached a domed fortress of stone surrounded\
  \ by a high wall. \"The Bastion of Justice,\" the guard said. \"Some of the best\
  \ dungeons in all of Lastwall down there, I'm told.\"</p> \n      <p>Rodrick thought\
  \ about that. \"Best... as in... most pleasant for prisoners? Or best as in most\
  \ effective at destroying a prisoner's will to live?\"</p> \n      <p>The guard\
  \ just smiled.</p> \n      <p>The gates opened, and the cart rolled into a courtyard\
  \ full of military bustle: crusaders training, grooms doing things to horses, people\
  \ running to and fro with urgency. The clash of steel on steel, the clang of hammers\
  \ shaping metal, the smell of forge fires—Rodrick found it all terribly depressing.\
  \ They were so <i>organized</i>. How could anyone stand it?</p> \n      <p>A crusader\
  \ with a round helmet jammed on her head approached, frowning. \"Do you have a prisoner\
  \ for us?\"</p> \n      <p>The captain nodded. \"One for Underclerk Temple, I think.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>The crusader whistled. \"Really? Let me see.\" She climbed up onto\
  \ the cart, and instantly drew her sword, leveling it at Rodrick. \"Why does the\
  \ prisoner still have a weapon?\"</p> \n      <p>The captain sighed. \"Because his\
  \ sword is sentient and magical and promised to murder anyone who tried to disarm\
  \ his master.\"</p> \n      <p>\"It's true,\" Hrym said. \"Except he's not my master.\
  \ We're partners. He's the junior partner, really.\"</p> \n      <p>\"No one needs\
  \ to murder <i>anyone</i>,\" Rodrick said. \"This is just a misunderstanding, and\
  \ it can all be worked out. I'm a fighter for the side of good myself, mainly, just\
  \ fallen on hard times lately.\"</p> \n      <p>The official nodded slowly, but\
  \ didn't sheathe her sword. \"Yes. One for Temple, indeed. Sir, you <i>do</i> realize\
  \ you're in the middle of Vellumis, a city of battle-hardened crusaders?\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"I've noticed, yes. Lovely city, too. Much nicer than I expected.\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Will you hand over the sword, so we can talk without quite so much...\
  \ tension?\"</p> \n      <p>\"It's not up to me, I'm afraid. Hrym, would you like\
  \ to go with this nice crusader?\"</p> \n      <p>\"No,\" Hrym said.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Rodrick gave an apologetic shrug. \"Sorry. He can be very stubborn.\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The woman rubbed her jaw with her free hand. \"All right, then.\" She\
  \ shouted \"Clear the courtyard!\" in a booming voice, and then sat staring at Rodrick\
  \ for three full minutes, the force of her attention entirely withering his attempts\
  \ to dazzle her with a charming smile. After the courtyard had emptied of all personnel,\
  \ including the big priest and the friendly-ish spear-carrier, the crusader leaned\
  \ forward and cut the ropes tying Rodrick's feet. She stepped out of the cart and\
  \ beckoned him to follow. Rodrick struggled upright and climbed out of the cart,\
  \ his hands still bound in front of him, but both resting on Hrym's hilt.</p> \n\
  \      <p>She led him through deserted hallways of dark stone and down spiraling\
  \ stairs, deep into the Bastion of Justice. \"Not very well staffed, are you?\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Everyone is avoiding the area until I have you secured, so if\
  \ your sword does anything... inadvisable... casualties will be minimal.\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"Good for everyone else. Not so good for you.\"</p> \n      <p>She shrugged.\
  \ \"Rank has its drawbacks.\"</p> \n      <p>\"What if I froze you solid and we\
  \ ran away?\" Hrym said.</p> \n      <p>\"Your wielder would be filled with crossbow\
  \ bolts the moment he poked his head outside,\" she replied.</p> \n      <p>\"Ah.\
  \ That's what I thought,\" Hrym said.</p> \n      <p>\"Here we are,\" she said eventually,\
  \ gesturing.</p> \n      <p>\"Ah,\" Rodrick said. \"Yes. Only the best dungeons\
  \ for me.\"</p> \n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗ </p> \n      <p>Rodrick\
  \ didn't need long to explore his new home: a small room of bare stone with straw\
  \ thrown on the floor, furnished only by a bench carved from a single piece of wood,\
  \ so there were no nails to pry loose or legs to break off to use as weapons. Before\
  \ he had time to become too bored, a guard opened the barred door and let in a gray-haired,\
  \ sour-faced man carrying a black bag.</p> \n      <p>\"Hello,\" Rodrick said. \"\
  What's in the bag?\"</p> \n      <p>\"Tools of the trade.\"</p> \n      <p>\"You\
  \ aren't a torturer, are you?\"</p> \n      <p>The man barked a laugh. \"Depends\
  \ on who you ask. I'm a chirurgeon. Mostly I cut off infected arms and legs to keep\
  \ the rot from spreading, but I'm just supposed to see if you're healthy or not.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"If you try to give him a sleeping draught or harm him in any way,\
  \ I will bring terrible destruction down on this place,\" Hrym said.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>The man frowned. \"A talking sword, they said. I thought they were playing\
  \ a joke. Oh well. Doesn't matter to me. Swords never need tending on the battlefield,\
  \ at least not from me. Stand up, would you, and stick out your tongue?\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>Rodrick had undergone the occasional physical exam in the past, and this\
  \ was less invasive than some: the doctor listened to his heart and lungs by pressing\
  \ an ear to his chest, peered into his mouth and ears and nostrils, made Rodrick\
  \ cough, prodded at his gums, asked him disgustingly personal questions about his\
  \ recent bowel movements and whether he had any pain when he passed water. For the\
  \ most part, Rodrick answered honestly.</p> \n      <p>\"All right, I'm done.\"\
  \ The doctor picked up his bag, which he'd never even opened.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  What's the verdict?\" Rodrick said.</p> \n      <p>The man shook his head. \"<i>You</i>\
  \ don't pay me. Why should I tell you?\"</p> \n      <p>A guard let the chirurgeon\
  \ out, and closed the door, and that was all that happened, for a while.</p> \n\
  \      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗ </p> \n      <p>\"I could pick the\
  \ lock, if there was a lock.\" Rodrick examined the door of the cell. \"The door\
  \ seems to be sealed by magic, which isn't very sporting.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Rodrick,\
  \ I can freeze the bars and you can break them with a kick.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  True. A bit loud, though. Might bring the guards running.\"</p> \n      <p>\"So\
  \ I'll freeze <i>them</i>, and you kick them as well.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I see a\
  \ few flaws with that plan.\"</p> \n      <p>\"You're softhearted, Rodrick. You\
  \ should be more like me. I don't have any heart at all, soft or otherwise.\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Even if the prospect of indiscriminate murder didn't give me pause,\
  \ I'm still hoping for a more elegant solution than destroying the Bastion of Justice\
  \ and bringing the wrath of the entire nation of Lastwall down on us. They can be\
  \ quite persistent, I understand, and I'd rather not be pursued across the continent.\
  \ Though I accept that as a tactic of last resort.\"</p> \n      <p>The door at\
  \ the end of the hall opened with a squeal of rusty hinges. Rodrick wondered if\
  \ the door made that noise naturally or if they'd worked on it with dirt and sand\
  \ and steel wool to create the right ominous tone.</p> \n      <p>A short, stout\
  \ woman of middle age walked down the hallway at a brisk, no-nonsense pace. Her\
  \ skin was dark brown, her hair curly and cropped short, with a great deal of gray\
  \ mixed in with the black. She wore vaguely official-looking black robes with baggy\
  \ sleeves, and carried a burlap sack in one hand. Rodrick thought she looked rather\
  \ matronly, until she stopped outside the bars and smiled at him; then she looked\
  \ more like someone who might eat her young, if the need arose. \"My name is Underclerk\
  \ Temple. I am a humble servant of the Bastion of Justice, and I've been chosen\
  \ to oversee your case.\"</p> \n      <p>In Rodrick's experience those who described\
  \ themselves as humble servants were usually neither—they tended to be zealous priests\
  \ or power-mad dictators—so he nodded politely. \"Very pleased to meet you. I hope\
  \ we can straighten this out. It's all just a misunderstanding, really.\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"Oh? You didn't try to steal a horse from a group of crusaders?\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"I <i>did</i>, but there were mitigating factors—\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  You needed the horse to escape the consequences of an earlier crime, yes, I heard.\
  \ I don't think there's any misunderstanding. It's a simple case, hardly worthy\
  \ of my attention. I don't usually bother meeting with horse thieves. I concern\
  \ myself with a better caliber of criminal. But word reached me of your supposed\
  \ exploits in the Lake of Mists and Veils, and of course about your wondrous sword,\
  \ and my curiosity was piqued.\"</p> \n      <p>\"My wondrous sword and I are happy\
  \ to answer any questions you might have.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Oh, I may have some\
  \ later, but I spent much of last night in correspondence with some associates of\
  \ mine in Andoran and Absalom—we have magic mirrors, much faster than relying on\
  \ couriers to carry letters—and I think I have a full understanding of your capabilities\
  \ and history. I haven't found much in the way of confirmation regarding your claim\
  \ to have defeated a demon lord, but there's a certain amount of circumstantial\
  \ evidence, and I have assurances that you at least believe your story to be true.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"I'm either a hero or a madman, then?\"</p> \n      <p>\"The difference\
  \ between those two can be <i>very</i> slight,\" Temple said. \"I don't think you're\
  \ either one, personally. You're a thief, a confidence trickster, and an opportunist\
  \ who occasionally does the right thing, when there's no more profitable alternative\
  \ available. You also have a loyal friend who happens to be a magical sword as dangerous\
  \ as an ancient white dragon.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Pleased to meet you,\" Hrym said.</p>\

  \  <br><i>Illustration by Raymond Swanland</i>\n      </div> \n      <p>\"Oh, good.\
  \ I was afraid you might say, 'Ice to meet you,'\" Temple said. \"I loathe puns.\
  \ But, yes, it's... interesting to meet you, too, Hrym. We don't usually lock prisoners\
  \ up with their weapons, but I suppose in this case you qualify as a prisoner, too.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>Hrym harrumphed. \"Are you a wizard, then? Can you stop me from\
  \ doing the things I do? Because if not, you should be aware I'm a prisoner for\
  \ only as long as I <i>consent</i> to be a prisoner. Otherwise I'm just a guest\
  \ in very poor accommodations.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I am a simple bureaucrat,\" Temple\
  \ said. \"My talents are organizational, not arcane. Here, Rodrick, catch.\" She\
  \ tossed something small and glittering through the bars, and Rodrick snatched it\
  \ from the air without thinking. He opened his palm and looked down at a ruby the\
  \ size of his thumbnail.</p> \n      <p>\"Usually I'm the one bribing my guards,\
  \ not the other way around.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Burrow,\" Temple said, and Rodrick\
  \ screamed as the ruby sank into the flesh of his hand with a sensation like a thousand\
  \ biting insects swarming across his palm. The gem moved under his skin, and he\
  \ clamped his other hand tightly around his wrist, but it did no good: he felt the\
  \ gem slide beneath his gripping fingers and watched as it traveled under the skin\
  \ along his inner forearm, past the crook of his elbow, scurrying over his bicep\
  \ and vanishing beneath the sleeve of his shirt. He could still feel the ruby moving,\
  \ like a chip of swallowed ice moving down the throat, but this icy sensation traveled\
  \ to his shoulder and then down into his chest, stopping in the vicinity of his\
  \ heart—at which point the sensation vanished entirely.</p> \n      <p>Hrym was\
  \ shouting from the bench: \"Rodrick! What's wrong? Should I kill everyone?\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"I wouldn't,\" Temple said mildly. \"That gem is... let's say... an\
  \ encouragement to good behavior.\"</p> \n      <p>\"She gave me a ruby, Hrym.\"\
  \ Rodrick stared at his palm, which no longer hurt, and which was entirely unmarked.\
  \ \"It crawled under my skin like a burrowing insect and scuttled next to my heart.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"I told you having a heart was a weakness,\" Hrym said.</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"I always thought you meant that metaphorically.\" Rodrick rubbed at\
  \ his chest, the banter coming weakly and automatically.</p> \n      <p>\"Metaphorically\
  \ <i>too</i>. Let me guess, Underclerk Temple: if Rodrick disobeys, the gem will,\
  \ what—explode into crystal fragments, shredding his heart?\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Not technically accurate, but <i>practically</i> accurate, yes. Disobedience equals\
  \ death.\"</p> \n      <p>\"And if, say, I flung an icicle through your heart right\
  \ now, and blew a hole in the wall, and Rodrick and I ran off?\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  That would be rude. It also wouldn't help. If I don't speak a particular phrase\
  \ each morning, the gem will do its work regardless. Killing me now would sentence\
  \ Rodrick to death tomorrow.\"</p> \n      <p>Hrym chuckled. \"This is a promising\
  \ development, Rodrick.\"</p> \n      <p>He stared at the sword. \"I... disagree.\
  \ Weren't you listening?\"</p> \n      <p>\"Yes, but you weren't, or at least, not\
  \ closely enough. If she's <i>threatening</i> you with death, that means they aren't\
  \ planning to <i>put</i> you to death.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I'm not sure slavery is\
  \ preferable to death, Hrym.\" He still had his hand over his heart, trying not\
  \ to think of crystal shards ripping him apart from the inside.</p> \n      <p>Temple\
  \ clucked her tongue. \"No, no. You misunderstand. It's not slavery at all. Think\
  \ of it as community service. In your home country of Andoran, some minor offenses\
  \ are punished not with beatings or fines or years in a dungeon, but simply by making\
  \ the guilty party clean up horse dung on the streets or scrape barnacles off naval\
  \ ships for a few weeks, yes? This is a similar situation. You will assist me with\
  \ certain projects, and after a certain period, you will be set free, your debt\
  \ to society paid. The program is quite enlightened and civilized. I have concluded\
  \ that you'll be more useful to Lastwall alive than you would be dangling at the\
  \ end of a rope.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Ah,\" Rodrick said. \"I see. You want to hurl\
  \ my body into the teeth of some horrible problem you don't dare risk one of your\
  \ own people on. Or is it more interesting than that? Perhaps you want me to embark\
  \ on some mission that no <i>legitimate</i> member of Lastwall's government can\
  \ undertake. If I succeed, I get no credit, and if I fail in some spectacular way—\
  well, I'm just a rogue criminal, and your government can't be blamed for my reprehensible\
  \ actions.\"</p> \n      <p>\"What a marvelous grasp of the situation!\" Temple\
  \ said. \"Of course, there's no reason it can't be <i>both</i>. I can already tell\
  \ working with you will be a delight. Would you like to meet the rest of the team?\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"You mean I'm not the only luckless bastard you've roped into this\
  \ scheme?\"</p> \n      <p>\"No, merely the latest. I'll let you out of the cell,\
  \ but I'll need you to sheathe Hrym in this.\" She held up a long scabbard made\
  \ of green crystal.</p> \n      <p>\"I've had less attractive accommodations,\"\
  \ Hrym said.</p> \n      <p>\"But not more restful.\" Temple tapped a ring on her\
  \ finger against the crystal, which rang like metal. \"This scabbard is made of\
  \ rare skymetal, brought at great expense from Numeria.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I knew\
  \ a man with a skymetal chainmail shirt once, and saw it turn an arrow as big as\
  \ a spear fired from a giant's bow—it would have pierced plate mail.\" Rodrick frowned.\
  \ \"Of course, the impact still cracked all his ribs, and one of <i>those</i> punctured\
  \ his lungs, but still, I was impressed. The shirt wasn't made of green crystal,\
  \ though.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Probably adamantine,\" she said. \"<i>This</i> is made\
  \ of noqual, and though it looks like crystal, it can be forged like iron. Noqual\
  \ has fascinating properties—mainly the suppression of magic. When we sheathe Hrym\
  \ here, he'll fall asleep, more or less.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I don't like the sound\
  \ of that,\" Hrym said.</p> \n      <p>\"Nor I,\" Rodrick agreed.</p> \n      <p>Temple\
  \ shrugged. \"Consider my situation. I'm trying to make an enforceable bargain with\
  \ a pair of desperate criminals. I can compel Rodrick's good behavior with that\
  \ gem, but you, Hrym, are a trickier beast to reckon with. Threatening Rodrick seems\
  \ to make you behave... but can I count on that to work forever? In this sheath,\
  \ you can do no harm. You'll be returned to Rodrick when you're needed to help him\
  \ with a mission. In the meantime, you won't be bored, and I won't have to worry\
  \ about you burying the Bastion of Justice in a mountain of ice because you're offended\
  \ that Rodrick stubbed his toe.\"</p> \n      <p>Rodrick shook his head. \"Why should\
  \ we believe you? What's to stop you from selling Hrym off, or presenting him as\
  \ a gift to some high-ranking crusader?\"</p> \n      <p>\"Know this, Rodrick of\
  \ Andoran.\" Temple leaned forward, her dark eyes fixed on his face. \"I will never\
  \ lie to you. Our relationship depends on my absolute power over your life and death,\
  \ and that relationship renders most lies unnecessary. I may not tell you the whole\
  \ truth, but anything I do tell you, you can believe. If you consent to put Hrym\
  \ away in this scabbard for now, you will be reunited with him later—sooner than\
  \ you think—and in the meantime, I'll introduce you to the other recruits, and explain\
  \ the particulars of your new situation.\"</p> \n      <p>Rodrick touched his chest.\
  \ He couldn't feel the ruby, but he knew it was there. \"Hrym, our choices seem\
  \ to be either going along with the esteemed underclerk's plans, or dying in a courageous\
  \ but pointless last stand.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I wouldn't die,\" Hrym said. \"But\
  \ I would be trapped at the center of a mountain of magical ice. Killing everyone\
  \ would be satisfying, but the consequences would be boring.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  I have one stipulation, Temple. I assume these little errands you want me to run\
  \ will be dangerous?\"</p> \n      <p>Temple shrugged. \"For someone with your skills?\
  \ Not very. But accidents do happen.\"</p> \n      <p>\"In the event of my death,\
  \ Hrym is to be offered retirement on a pile of gold coins, not an eternity of dreamless\
  \ sleep in a magical scabbard.\"</p> \n      <p>\"And if I refuse?\"</p> \n    \
  \  <p>\"Everyone has to die someday, Temple,\" Rodrick said. \"If my day has come,\
  \ I would at least have the satisfaction of taking you with me.\"</p> \n      <p>Temple\
  \ nodded. \"Very well. I'll make that amendment to your agreement. You'll have a\
  \ chance to review the contract.\" She slid the scabbard through the bars of the\
  \ cell.</p> \n      <p>Rodrick took it—the sheath was heavier than it looked—and\
  \ knelt by the bench. \"We'll figure something out, Hrym.\"</p> \n      <p>\"We\
  \ always do. Worst case, we can just do what she says. Perform a few tasks, and\
  \ then take our freedom.\"</p> \n      <p>\"You believe her?\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  I do. She has a trustworthy face.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I thought all humans looked\
  \ alike to you.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Stop stalling,\" Hrym said. \"At least in that\
  \ sheath I'll get a moment's peace from your prattling.\"</p> \n      <p>Rodrick\
  \ slid Hrym into the scabbard, which was too long for him but otherwise a good fit,\
  \ and then passed him through the bars.</p> \n      <p>Temple tucked the scabbard\
  \ under her arm like it was a rolled-up broadsheet. She spoke a word of magic and\
  \ the cell door swung open. She beckoned, and Rodrick followed her out. He briefly\
  \ considered hitting her over the head, grabbing the scabbard, and fleeing, but\
  \ it was idle speculation. It was possible she was lying about the gem, but it was\
  \ hardly a risk he was willing to take.</p> \n      <p>Temple took him down the\
  \ familiar corridor, then through a nondescript wooden door and down a spiraling\
  \ stone staircase that descended below the earth, every landing lit with a magical\
  \ glowing orb. \"The Bastion must be quite well funded,\" he said. \"Most places\
  \ just use lanterns.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Ah, but with a single word I can extinguish\
  \ all these lights, or cause them to flare to blinding brightness, or even to explode\
  \ in cascades of fire. We're very conscious of security here in the Bastion.\" She\
  \ didn't sound threatening at all, which was somehow even more threatening.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>After taking the rest of the descent in silence, they reached a heavy\
  \ door of oak banded in iron, also lacking a keyhole. Temple pressed her hand against\
  \ it, and the door swung inward.</p> \n      <p>Beyond was something between a spacious\
  \ apartment and a palatial office. Amazingly, natural light suffused one corner\
  \ of the room, which at first Rodrick took to be magic, but then he realized there\
  \ was a light well: a narrow shaft running all the way from the surface to these\
  \ subterranean depths, shining on a small plot of flowering and leafy plants. The\
  \ floor was stone, but liberally covered with rugs. The walls were hung with a strange\
  \ assortment of items: a broken sword, the stuffed head of an orc with unusually\
  \ prominent fangs, a horned iron helmet with a star-shaped hole in one side. A desk\
  \ was set up against one wall, beside an apothecary's cabinet full of hundreds of\
  \ small drawers and a shelf filled with volumes and scrolls. In the middle of the\
  \ room there were several chairs and settees arranged around a low wooden table.\
  \ There was even a kitchen of sorts: a woodstove with a teakettle on top, a cabinet\
  \ full of cups and dishes, another full of dry goods, a large stone basin, and even\
  \ the handle of a water pump. There was a hallway not far from the light well, with\
  \ closed doors on either side and one at the end, open to reveal a set of bunk beds.\
  \ This was a fully contained set of living quarters, then. As far as barracks went,\
  \ he'd seen worse.</p> \n      <p>Rodrick took in the surroundings at a glance,\
  \ but he spent more time looking over the <i>people</i>, though he tried not to\
  \ make his examination obvious. The most striking of the group was a devilkin woman\
  \ perched on the edge of the desk, looking entirely human apart from her crimson\
  \ skin and dark blue lips. She was quite shapely, and dressed to show it off in\
  \ high boots, tight breeches, and a blouse unlaced halfway down her cleavage. She\
  \ had long black hair bundled into a ponytail, a pretty face, bright eyes, and a\
  \ smirk that was several degrees beyond \"insufferable\": she looked immensely pleased\
  \ with herself, and as if you should be pleased with her, too, if you had any sense.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Standing in a corner behind her was a tall man wearing a heavy brown\
  \ winter cloak despite the warmth of the room. His skin was the color of curdled\
  \ cream, and judging by the gauntness of his face, he must be calamitously thin\
  \ and cadaverous under that cloak. His eyes were the same muddy brown as his clothing,\
  \ though the whites were more like yellows: Rodrick thought of piss in a snow bank.\
  \ The man looked <i>ill</i>, but also like he'd been ill for a very long time, and\
  \ was getting along fine despite it.</p> \n      <p>The others sat by the low table,\
  \ one lounging in an armchair, and the last sitting stiffly upright on a bench against\
  \ the wall. The lounger was a woman of perhaps twenty-five with the features of\
  \ someone from Jalmeray or the Impossible Kingdoms—dark skin, dark eyes, dark hair—\
  but dressed in Inner Sea garb, a pale blue blouse and skirt over dark leggings and\
  \ boots, with a sheathed dagger at her waist. The last was an old man in a baggy\
  \ shirt with ink-stained cuffs and the attentive and acquisitive eyes of a crow,\
  \ wearing a pair of pince-nez spectacles. Even so, he looked less like a scholar\
  \ and more like one of those hard, sinewy old men you saw in the country, who could\
  \ heave hay bales and slaughter cows all day long and still have energy left over\
  \ to chase away perfectly harmless trespassers with a pitchfork.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Welcome,\" Temple said, \"to the first meeting of the Lastwall Volunteers.\"</p>\
