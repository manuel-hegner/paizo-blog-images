  ></a>\n     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">After a\
  \ lovely day and night spent in the river canyons, it was time for our next adventure.\
  \ “What do you think?” I asked Lythea the next morning, spreading the rough map\
  \ of the coastline that we’d pieced together out on the table in the galley. “The\
  \ cartography of this region is incomplete, but my notes suggest that several migratory\
  \ species congregate in and below the cliffs along the shoreline, somewhere—” I\
  \ gestured diffidently with a claw. “—near here?”</p>\n      <p>She laughed at my\
  \ hopeful expression, the water gently sloshing in the supramarine chair she affectionately\
  \ called her “Little Sea” as she leaned forward and scrutinized my attempts at map-making,\
  \ tracing the jagged lines with her finger. “We’ll aim for here,” Lythea said, her\
  \ tone decisive, “and then work our way up the coast if we need to. No need to worry,\
  \ Baranthet.”</p>\n      <p>“There’s occasionally some need,” I protested as Grefu\
  \ approached, his finned arms delicately balancing several platters. “Here, let’\
  s clear some space.”</p>\n      <p>Our stoic cook grunted his thanks as we swept\
  \ the papers away and helped him unload the eclectic breakfast he’d prepared. We\
  \ left the menu up to him, but he always seemed to find a way to accommodate everyone’\
  s favorites (today’s breakfast included multi-seed scones for me and seaweed wraps\
  \ for Lythea, among other delicacies). The others joined us shortly thereafter:\
  \ Dr. Pom emerging from her cabin and blinking in the bright sun; Telero and Chari\
  \ putting away their spyglass and sketchbook, respectively, as they returned from\
  \ vantage points at the prow; Ten scuttling down from the central mast to arrive\
  \ before the others and take first pick of the bounty. Grefu’s eyes twinkled as\
  \ the young surki loaded their plate with one of everything and tucked in, their\
  \ mandibles moving with wordless delight.</p>\n      <p>Lythea and I continued to\
  \ discuss our plans as the others settled in. “With fair winds, it should only take\
  \ a few hours, but... I’m not sure the weather will hold,” she said, evaluating\
  \ the horizon with a critical eye.</p>\n      <p>Grefu politely refrained from smoking\
  \ his coral pipe during mealtimes, but he was never without it, and now he gestured\
  \ toward the clouds with it in hand. “She’s right. Storm’s movin’ in.”</p>\n   \
  \   <p>This succinct observation complete, he stood and began clearing plates as\
  \ I looked anxiously at Lythea. “The winds will guide us either way. There’s no\
  \ cause for concern,” she reiterated with a smile.</p>\n      <p>Several hours later,\
  \ I certainly felt there was a cause or two as I clung to the controls on the exterior\
  \ deck, rain stinging my face. I much would have preferred, dear reader, to pilot\
  \ the ship from the safety of the main bridge, the <em>Zoetrope's</em> sturdy panes\
  \ shielding us from the elements, but some curious property of the storm had rendered\
  \ our instruments erratic and unreliable, leaving us no choice but to conduct an\
  \ open-air reading. Lythea watched the clouds and the sea below us with unflappable\
  \ focus, fiercely calling directions over the thunder snatching at her words. But\
  \ our navigator’s faith in our trusty ship and crew was not misplaced, and—trembling\
  \ a bit from the effort, but still upright—I managed to set us down precisely where\
  \ she wanted us with only minimal mishaps.</p>\n      <p>As I unclipped my safety\
  \ line and sagged against the helm to catch my breath, Ten scampered by on their\
  \ way to the engine room, looking as though they’d just had the time of their life\
  \ despite an obvious abrasion on their arm. Grefu soon joined us, his coral pipe\
  \ clenched in his mouth, and passed over a thermos of giant swordfish soup. I let\
  \ the spicy aroma soothe my frayed nerves and permitted myself a moment to reminisce\
  \ about the thunderstorms I watched in my youth with my pet protoceratops, Lin,\
  \ my grandmother’s stew simmering away as she told us of the wardens.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Grefu’s gruff voice broke my reverie. “Nice flyin’, you two.”</p>\n      <p>I\
  \ toasted him with the thermos. “Excellent cooking. Soup during a storm, imagine!”\
  </p>\n      <p>He nodded, silently accepting the compliment, but his eyes were on\
  \ Lythea, who’d accepted a thermos of her own but was staring off at the water.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Lot of memories in storms,” he said, his voice gentle. “Lot of stories.\
  \ This recipe was born in one, you know.”</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ the control panel, adjusting the satchel of herbs and salts that was always at\
  \ his hip. His gaze as faraway as Lythea’s, he ventured, “Several generations back,\
  \ my community was in a great famine. The matriarch of our clan had led us well\
  \ for many years, but she was old and tired, and so we were looking for new leadership—\
  normally a celebrated transition, but a grim one this time.</p>\n      <p>“My great-grandmother\
  \ knew one good hunt could see us through. No one had ever dared to face the legendary\
  \ swordfish lurking in the depths, beyond the coral walls of our home. Still, she\
  \ was hopeful it could feed us for many seasons if she could only catch and prepare\
  \ it properly.”</p>\n      <p>I was lucky the thermos was keeping my soup warm,\
  \ because I had completely forgotten about it, so enraptured was I in Grefu’s story!\
  \ Lythea, too, seemed to be hanging on every word.</p>\n      <p>Grefu blinked in\
  \ that slow, measured way of his and continued. “She organized a group of our finest\
  \ eel riders, even recruiting some from a nearby community, and set off into the\
  \ dark. I imagine it must have been a terrific battle. But they returned, bearing\
  \ the great beast—and she prepared and served it for her ascension feast, when the\
  \ village unequivocally nominated her as our matriarch’s successor.”</p>\n     \
  \ <p>“She sounds like an inspiring woman,” Lythea said, a small but genuine smile\
  \ brightening her face. “Do you miss your family, Grefu?”</p>\n      <p>He considered\
  \ this a moment. “It’s natural to do so, when you leave a close-knit community,”\
  \ he said finally. “And I do. But they’re with me still, when I make a family recipe\
  \ or repair the same nets their hands worked before mine.”</p>\n      <p>“Have either\
  \ of you considered writing down some of your family’s stories?” I asked, ever the\
  \ librarian.</p>\n      <p>“I sing of mine,” Lythea said, shaking her head. “That’\
  s what keeps them close, for me.”</p>\n      <p>Grefu seemed to agree. “That’s more\
  \ your wheelhouse, Baranthet—or Charikleia’s. Though I’ve thought about putting\
  \ together a recipe collection, maybe.”</p>\n      <p>“A cookbook!” I was delighted.\
  \ “Oh, you must—I’ve never eaten so well in my life as I have on this voyage.”</p>\n\
  \      <p>He huffed in amusement. “We’ll see. Maybe our navigator here can help\
  \ me find a few of the rarer ingredients I’ve been missin’.”</p>\n      <p>Lythea’\
  s lyrical laugh filled the bridge as she clinked her thermos to ours. “I’m always\
  \ up for a dive!”</p>\n      <br>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n      <table class=\"\

  \ Today, we take a look at some of the aquatic content coming in <em> Howl of the\
  \ Wild</em>: the athamaru ancestry and the merfolk ancestry! First are athamarus,\
  \ Grefu’s amphibious people, who sculpt coral, communicate (and defend themselves)\
  \ via scent, and practice eel rearing. Athamaru eel riders are a fearsome force,\
  \ and your character can saddle up and lead the charge with abilities like Riptide\
  \ Mount!</p>\n      <p><u></u></p>\n      <h3><u>RIPTIDE MOUNT [one-action] — FEAT\
  \ 5</u></h3>\n      <p></p>\n      <p><b>Athamaru</b><br><b><u>Requirements</u></b><u>\
  \ You are underwater and adjacent to a creature that is at least one size larger\
  \ than you, has a swim Speed, and is willing to be your mount.</u><br></p>\n   \
  \   <p>After working with aquatic beasts of burden for years, you have learned how\
  \ to easily mount and dismount them. You Mount the creature and Command an Animal\
  \ to issue it an order of your choice.</p>\n      <br>\n      <p>As a merfolk, Lythea\
  \ has quite the voice. Merfolk are one of the most magical ancestries coming in\
  \ <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, with abilities like manipulating water, cursing sailors,\
  \ or turning their tears to pearls. But a merfolk’s most famous ability is their\
  \ enchanting song—quite literally with the Siren Song feat!</p>\n      <h3><u>SIREN\
  \ SONG [three-actions] — FEAT 9</u></h3>\n      <p><b>Auditory, Mental, Merfolk,\
  \ Primal</b><br><b>Frequency</b> once per day<br></p>\n      <p><u><b>Prerequisites</b>\
  \ expert in Performance</u><br>\n        You can beguile and bewitch with your song.\
  \ All creatures in a 60-foot emanation must attempt a Will save against your Performance\
  \ DC. On subsequent rounds, you can Sustain the song, causing each creature in the\
  \ area currently affected by your song to attempt another Will save. Typically,\
  \ creatures that have traveled with you for a significant time, such as your fellow\
  \ party members, are immune to your Siren Song.</p>\n      <p><b>Critical Success</b>\
  \ The target is unaffected and becomes immune to your Siren Song for 24 hours.<br><b>Success</b>\
  \ The target is fascinated with you until the end of your next turn.<br><b>Failure</b>\
