  \  <blockquote>\n       <h3>Grendel</h3> \n       <p>This reaver of the cold marsh\
  \ is not just a monster; he is a force of nature. Where there is peace and prosperity\
  \ in the world, Grendel strikes, eager to prove that tranquility is transitory and\
  \ death is the only constant. He stalks the edge of his fens, seeking settlements\
  \ where joy holds sway. He strikes under cover of night, primarily targeting celebrations\
  \ or festivals. The more happiness or joy he can extinguish, the better.</p> \n\
  \       <h4>GRENDEL’S MOTHER</h4> \n       <p>At the bottom of a remote mountain\
  \ lake filled with sea serpents is a magical house—the lair of Grendel’s mother.\
  \ Among her many treasures is a sword so big and heavy that only a supernaturally\
  \ strong individual can wield it. When Grendel is injured, he retreats here to heal.</p>\n\

  \  <blockquote>\n       <h3>Morlock</h3> \n       <p>Originating from humans long\
  \ lost from the world of light, morlocks are brutal monsters that dwell in the tangled\
  \ tunnels of the upper reaches of the Darklands. Their wiry frames mask the strength\
  \ of their limbs and their swift reactions, and their arms are long enough that\
  \ they can drop into an uncanny, four-limbed shuffle for speed or stealth. They\
  \ no longer remember the lives their ancestors led on the surface, although many\
  \ morlocks still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient homes. Some morlocks\
  \ worship the statues of humans from these bygone eras as gods, but others now worship\
  \ Lamashtu, Rovagug, or other violent deities.</p> \n       <h4>MORLOCK MACHINERY</h4>\
  \ \n       <p>Morlocks tend toward brutish actions and violent traditions and have\
  \ little interest in bettering their societies or creating art. However, they have\
  \ a strange obsession with ancient machinery and magical items, particularly clockwork\
  \ constructions. Their knack for tinkering helps keep ancient guardians and traps\
  \ functional, even if their work backfires now and then</p>\n      </blockquote>\

  \  <blockquote>\n       <h3>Ravener</h3> \n       <p>Though their lifespans can\
  \ measure in millennia, all dragons must eventually perish. While many do so on\
  \ the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their\
  \ enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at\
  \ the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures, some dragons\
  \ respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly\
  \ prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by\
  \ this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn\
  \ of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to\
  \ the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into\
  \ undead creatures known as raveners.</p> \n       <h4>RAVENER LAIRS</h4> \n   \
  \    <p>Cunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile\
  \ to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the\
  \ rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano,\
  \ and so on. Some raveners even go so far as to deliberately fill their entire lair\
  \ with lethally poisonous gases, and raveners that are capable of advanced spellcasting\
  \ often seal their lairs completely, accessing them exclusively by spells such as\
  \ teleport or gaseous form. Of course, raveners must feed on the living to persist,\
  \ so they never locate their lairs so far from sources of life that they’ll starve.</p>\

  \  <blockquote>\n       <h3>Serpentfolk</h3> \n       <p>Before their ancient clash\
  \ with humanity devastated their civilization, serpentfolk were masters of a sprawling\
  \ underground empire. Few serpentfolk survive today; their power is shattered, their\
  \ god Ydersius decapitated (although not quite slain). The cunning, intelligence,\
  \ and magical abilities of serpentfolk have diminished from their ancient heights,\
  \ and most are born without these boons. Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’\
  s legacy of intelligence and magic are known as zyss, and they look down upon their\
  \ more numerous kindred with a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots\
  \ as a curse on their kind, resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium\
  \ during the fall of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning\
  \ “chaos made flesh.”</p> \n       <h4>THE HEADLESS KING</h4> \n       <p>Ydersius\
  \ was defeated by an Azlanti heroine named Savith in the era before Earthfall, and\
  \ now the so-called Headless King’s body prowls aimlessly in the Darklands. That\
  \ the decapitated god’s clerics still gain power from worship points to Ydersius’\
  s tenacity and continued existence, after a fashion. Those who seek to recover his\
  \ skull and return it to his body hope that doing so will restore both him and the\
  \ sekmin civilization to their full power.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>Don’\
