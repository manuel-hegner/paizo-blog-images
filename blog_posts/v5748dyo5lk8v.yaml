  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Golarion is filled with adventurers\
  \ from sleepy villages and pristine cities who spend their days navigating the labyrinthine\
  \ social structures of society. In fact, there are a host of Paizo books filled\
  \ with Pathfinder player options to support and encourage just those kinds of characters\
  \ and stories.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9wzt?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-People-of-the-Wastes\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: People of the Wastes</em></a> is not one of those\
  \ books.</p> \n    <p>Rather, the myriad archetypes, feats, items, and class features\
  \ in People of the Wastes are for characters who are from or adventure in some of\
  \ the most treacherous parts of the world, from the demon-filled Worldwound to the\
  \ corrupted Southern Fangwood of Nirmathas to the flooded Sodden Lands to the unpredictable\
  \ and primal magic of the Mana Wastes.</p> \n    <p>This book, as such, provided\
  \ us with an opportunity to gleefully provide options for PCs who, though often\
  \ nonstandard, nonetheless fit right into these wasteland locales. Characters who\
  \ have encountered the Cindersnort goblins of the Mana Wastes, for example, might\
  \ choose this book's volatile fuse character trait, or its Sizzling Shot feat, each\
  \ of which focuses on the use of powerful but unpredictable firearms.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Another fun option <em>People of the Wastes</em> provides involves advice for\
  \ playing character with the mutant template from <a href=\"/products/btpy9g9x?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-5\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5</em></a> (at your GM's discretion, of course!). There's\
  \ also the constructed pugilist brawler archetype, which is perfect for mutant PCs\
  \ who have chosen to use mechanical prostheses to augment their bodies. This archetype\
  \ grants the brawler a constructed limb and provides a host of options for modifying\
  \ it.</p> \n    <p>I won't spoil the rest of this archetype's specifics, though.\
  \ I'll simply leave you with this illustration below.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
