  \    <h3>Duhgik, Kobold Trapsmith</h3> \n     <p>After her tribe exiled her for\
  \ not adhering to some of their more ruthless traditions, Duhgik was forced to live\
  \ on the surface in the too-too bright sunshine. She found solace in the deep shade\
  \ of the forest’s tree canopy among the verdant foliage of various plants and edible\
  \ mosses. Duhgik that the environment matched her own green scales well, and has\
  \ since become an expert at hiding among the big-big trees.</p> \n     <p>When Duhgik\
  \ found the cruelty of her old kobold tribe reflected in the cruelty of hunters\
  \ and poachers in the forest, she set out on a personal mission to help the critters\
  \ of the woods by disarming poachers’ snares and setting up some of her own. She\
  \ strives to rid her woods of the would-be hunters who only care about trophies\
  \ and leave the rest of the animal to rot—what a waste. As long as visitors to her\
  \ forest are kind to the land and animals, Duhgik leaves them alone.</p> \n    \

  \ penalty to the damage of the triggering Strike. This penalty applies after doubling\
  \ the damage for a critical hit. The attacker is then immune to Duhgik’s Cringe\

  \ [Duhgik has learned how to trigger snares from afar, creating ranged hazards to\
  \ assail her opponents and allowing her to disarm enemies’ snares harmlessly. She\
  \ can Strike a snare to trigger it prematurely. If she crafted the snare, she automatically\
  \ hits. If someone else crafted it, she must attempt a ranged Strike against the\
  \ Crafting DC, triggering the snare only if she hits.</p> \n     <p><b>Sneak Attack\
  \ </b> Duhgik deals 1d6 extra precision damage to creatures that are flat-footed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Surprise Snare</b> [two-actions] (manipulation) Duhgik installs one\
  \ of her snares prepared for quick deployment in a space that’s occupied by an opponent.\
  \ It must be a snare that normally takes 1 minute or less to Craft. The snare automatically\
  \ triggers, but it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to any applicable save DC, as\
  \ well as any attack rolls or other checks the snare attempts. </p>\n     <h3>Plot\
  \ Hooks</h3> \n     <p>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means\
  \ of integrating Duhgik into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li>A local noble or prominent merchant hires the heroes, describing a\
  \ terrible attack they suffered in the woods by a terrifying creature the last time\
  \ they were out hunting game—likely an ogre, troll, or some other vicious creature.\
  \ In truth, these claims are an exaggeration, and the embarrassed noble fell victim\
  \ to one of Duhgik’s traps and simply embellishes the threat to save face.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>While traveling through the woods, the heroes come across a series\
  \ of traps, each more dangerous than the last. A voice high in the trees tells them\
  \ to flee or face the wrath of the “very-big-mean dragon” that protects the forest\
  \ and its inhabitants.</li> \n      <li>Duhgik meets the heroes while on a trip\
  \ into town to buy supplies and sell some of her snares to hunters she trusts to\
  \ use them honorably. She asks them to help her with a particularly aggressive magical\
  \ beast that has been avoiding her snares and killing all the wildlife near her\
  \ home.</li> \n     </ul> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!-- tags:  Pathfinder,\
