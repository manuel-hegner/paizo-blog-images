  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Faithful Servants</h1> \n   <p>by James L.\
  \ Sutter</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: The Penitent Man</h2> \n   <p>There was the\
  \ usual moment of darkness and cold, the terrible feeling of being drawn through\
  \ space like a fish on a line, and then the light was back and the amulet deposited\
  \ them safely.</p> \n   <p>Right in the middle of an angry mob.</p> \n   <p>Salim\
  \ looked quickly to Connell, but the eidolon was already holding his own pendant.\
  \ Before Salim could say anything, the eidolon’s disguise as an axiomite melted\
  \ into something less suspicious. The pointed ears were still there, but shorter.\
  \ Gone was the inhumanly perfect skin, replaced by a moonscape of old pockmarks.\
  \ The cowl of the robe he wore—now old and tattered, stained as much by the road\
  \ as any dye—came up to cover the glowing forehead rune.</p> \n   <p>It was a good\
  \ job. The peasant closest to the new arrivals blinked, peered at the two of them\
  \ as if he trying to remember something, then visibly gave up and returned his attention\
  \ to the shouting man at the front.</p> \n   <p>They were in the central green of\
  \ a modest town, a ring of shops and public houses encircling a muddy patch of grass\
  \ long since chewed into submission by the hooves and jaws of livestock. Beyond,\
  \ Salim recognized the dark and craggy peaks of the Hungry Mountains rising ominously\
  \ on all sides. Even now, at midday, the fog that shrouded their dark forests was\
  \ thick, and moved in strange ways just beyond the valley’s last farmsteads.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The mob was barely worthy of the name—perhaps forty men and women in varying\
  \ states of disrepair—yet Salim had seen such groups before. The deciding factor\
  \ for mobs wasn’t in their muscles, or their makeshift weapons, but in their eyes.\
  \ These folk were afraid. And where there was enough fear, something could break,\
  \ and turn even the most timid housewife into a killer.</p> \n   <p>The man trying\
  \ to catalyze that change stood at the focal point of the loose semicircle, perched\
  \ precariously on an overturned wheelbarrow. He was middle-aged and almost completely\
  \ bald, with only a few wisps of white hair scrambling to cling to and cover his\
  \ shining pate. From beneath voluminous black robes similar to Salim’s own poked\
  \ stick-thin arms, gesticulating wildly. At his throat hung a large silver spiral\
  \ on a chain—the holy symbol of Pharasma.</p> \n   <p>\"Too long have we suffered\
  \ the monster to remain in our midst!\" the priest cried. \"Far too long! You, Silva,\"\
  \ he pointed at one of the women near the front, \"was not your husband’s grave\
  \ torn up, just weeks after his passing? And you, Tam\"—this time a fat man in a\
  \ flour-stained apron—\"your uncle’s grave as well. No wolf digs so deep, or so\
  \ thoroughly.\"</p> \n   <p>He returned to addressing the whole crowd.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"Suffering is our lot! Yet that doesn’t mean the Goddess desires us to lie\
  \ down and let monsters roam the night, taking our loved ones. As your priest, I\
  \ should be leading you—yet I am old, and my hands shake with the palsy.\" He raised\
  \ the offending appendages high. \"Thus I must pass the burden to my son, Sir Percinov.\
  \ It is he who will lead you to glory.\"</p> \n   <p>The crowd shifted slightly,\
  \ and Salim glimpsed the figure that stood at the old priest’s knee. The plates\
  \ of its armor were all in black and silver, the chest embossed with Pharasma’s\
  \ spiral, and a businesslike bucket of a helm obscured the face. At the figure’\
  s waist rested a long sword in a matching scabbard. All in all, a suitably imposing\
  \ sight. Yet something about the way the warrior stood gave Salim pause.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"When?\" a voice from the crowd cried.</p> \n   <p>\"At dawn,\" the priest\
  \ said. \"Mirosoy and his creatures are things of darkness. We will bring them the\
  \ cleansing light.\"</p> \n   <p>\"That’s my master,\" Connell hissed, and Salim\
  \ tapped his arm to quiet him.</p> \n   <p>The crowd shouted its ragged approval,\
  \ and then the church bells began chiming. In twos and threes, the people shuffled\
  \ off to be about their errands, or perhaps just to rest up before the lynching.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>The priest had stepped down from his wheelbarrow and was talking\
  \ with the knight. Salim approached.</p> \n   <p>\"Excuse me, Father. May I have\
  \ a word?\"</p> \n   <p>The priest turned. Above his beak of a nose, hard little\
  \ rat eyes crawled up and down Salim’s length, taking in the black robes and sun-darkened\
  \ skin, the short beard and strangely melted-looking sword hilt. His eyes lit upon\
  \ the amulet, which Salim had left hanging prominently against his chest, and the\
  \ hard mouth softened almost imperceptibly.</p> \n   <p>\"A fellow clergyman?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Something like that.\" Salim drew the spiral of Pharasma in the air\
  \ between them.</p> \n   <p>\"Yet not from around here.\" Salim’s southern skin,\
  \ so much darker than the sickly pale Ustalavs, kept the words from being a question.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"No,\" Salim agreed. \"My companion and I have traveled far to offer\
  \ our assistance. It seems others in the church have learned of your situation.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Hum,\" the priest said, a sound that wasn’t altogether pleased. \"\
  Very well, then. My name is Father Adibold, and this is Sir Percinov. My rectory\
  \ is just over here—please, allow me to welcome you properly.\" Without bothering\
  \ to wait for a reply, the man turned and began stalking toward a little house attached\
  \ to the church, the armored warrior just behind him. Salim and Connell followed.</p>\

  0\"></a>\n    <br>\"A child in armor is still a child.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>The\
  \ house might better have been called a cell. Though the walls were still painted\
  \ white, they’d clearly been neglected for some time. The outlines of less-faded\
  \ regions suggested that, at one point, there had been more furniture in here—a\
  \ bureau, a couch—yet now the room contained only a stove, a cupboard, the roughest\
  \ of wooden tables, and two chairs. Salim accepted the priest’s invitation and sat\
  \ in the nearer chair, then immediately wished he hadn’t. He’d interrogated men\
  \ in more comfortable chairs than this.</p> \n   <p>Father Adibold took the opposite\
  \ chair. Connell remained standing next to the door, while the armored figure took\
  \ up a respectful position behind the priest’s left shoulder. For the first time,\
  \ the metal mountain spoke.</p> \n   <p>\"Da, may I—?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yes, fine!\"\
  \ The priest waved a hand. With an audible sigh of relief, the warrior removed his\
  \ gauntlets, then reached up and pulled off his helmet.</p> \n   <p>It was a boy,\
  \ brown-haired and skinny. His bobbing larynx didn’t even come close to touching\
  \ the steel gorget meant to protect his throat. Salim bet that if he struck the\
  \ breastplate, the teenager would rattle around inside the armor like the clapper\
  \ in a bell.</p> \n   <p>The old man spoke first. \"You’re not a priest,\" he said\
  \ bluntly. \"The sword tells me that much. So what are you?\"</p> \n   <p>\"A hunter,\"\
  \ Salim said. \"A problem-solver for the church, specializing in the sort of thing\
  \ you now face. Or have I heard wrong? It’s undead creations that your people fear,\
  \ is it not?\"</p> \n   <p>The priest grunted. \"Indeed.\" Reluctantly, he got to\
  \ his feet and went to the cupboard. He returned with two cups of water and a cob\
  \ of bread, which he set between them. \"Please,\" he said, gesturing. \"Eat.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Salim tore off a chunk of bread and bit into it. It was hard, and old,\
  \ but blessedly weevil-free.</p> \n   <p>\"I’d apologize for not offering better\
  \ fare,\" the old man continued, not sounding the least bit apologetic, \"but we\
  \ of the Kavapestan branch don’t believe in southern niceties.\"</p> \n   <p>Aha.\
  \ Suddenly both the ostentatiously poor hospitality and the deliberately uncomfortable\
  \ furniture made more sense. Salim’s eyes twitched toward the man’s sleeves, which\
  \ had fallen back when he proffered the food. The priest caught the look and deliberately\
  \ pulled the cloth back down, but not before Salim caught the telltale lines of\
  \ dozens of thin white scars on his forearms.</p> \n   <p>\"So you follow the Penitence,\
  \ then.\"</p> \n   <p>The old priest thrust his jaw out pugnaciously. \"The Lady\
  \ of Graves judges us not only on what we do, but what we endure. Those who suffer\
  \ in this life are rewarded in the next. We Ustalavs have known this for generations.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Very admirable,\" Salim said.</p> \n   <p>The priest searched for\
  \ any sign that he was being mocked, and upon finding none, slowly nodded. \"Yes,\
  \ well. It’s rare to find a southerner who understands the value of forsaking worldly\
  \ pleasures.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Believe me,\" Salim said, \"I’ve forsaken plenty. But\
  \ I didn’t come here to discuss theology. Tell me of Mirosoy.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Bah!\"\
  \ the priest said, and spat on his own floor. \"A magician and minor noble who lives\
  \ in a manse at the far end of the valley. He’s been there for years.\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"It’s disgusting,\" the armored boy put in helpfully. \"Using magic to avoid\
  \ honest sweat and labor.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Shut up, Percy,\" the priest said, yet\
  \ he nodded at the sentiment. \"It’s true, we have no love of wizards and witches\
  \ here. Yet it’s still not a crime, and his business helps keep the village alive\
  \ through hard times. Of late, however, the lord has turned to darker arts. Graves\
  \ have been disturbed, even within the grounds of the church.\"</p> \n   <p>Now\
  \ it was Salim’s turn to grunt. Grave robbing from a church of Pharasma was bold,\
  \ if not outright suicidal. \"And his creatures. You’ve seen them?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Not personally. But the villagers who cart out his provisions or used to work in\
  \ his house speak of moans, and shambling forms, and the stench of death.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Salim nodded. \"And you’d send a mob of villagers to handle things?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>The priest bristled. \"Not alone! I would offer what magics I have,\
  \ and my son would lead them!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Ah yes, your son.\" Salim turned to\
  \ the would-be warrior. \"Show me your hands, boy.\"</p> \n   <p>Confused, Percinov\
  \ did as he was told, holding them palms out. Salim nodded.</p> \n   <p>\"That’\
  s a fine suit of armor, boy. It’ll serve you well one day. But not yet.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Now wait just a minute—!\" the priest began.</p> \n   <p>Salim silenced\
  \ him with a raised finger. \"Calluses.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Pardon?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  You may know penance, Father, but I know war. And the calluses on this boy’s hands\
  \ are from chopping wood, not a sword hilt. The pattern’s all wrong.\" He glanced\
  \ back at Percinov. \"You can put your hands down now, boy.\"</p> \n   <p>Percinov\
  \ did. His father glowered. \"The boy will be fine,\" the old priest growled. \"\
  Any wounds he suffers, I’ll heal. And his pain will buy credit with the Goddess.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>As it happened, Salim knew precisely how little credit such suffering\
  \ earned. Yet he set that sentiment aside and decided to test out a suspicion that\
  \ had been building.</p> \n   <p>\"And what would the boy’s mother think if he were\
  \ killed?\" he asked.</p> \n   <p>\"Don’t you talk about his mother!\" Tiny drops\
  \ of spit flew from the priest’s lips to land halfway across the table. \"Serafina\
  \ is with the Lady now, assisting in the judgment of souls. We should all be so\
  \ fortunate.\"</p> \n   <p>\"But, Da—\" Percinov began.</p> \n   <p>\"Shut up, Percy!\"\
  \ </p> \n   <p>The priest put his head in hands. For a moment, no one said anything.\
  \ At last, the priest looked up, his lined face appearing older than ever.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"What do you propose?\" he asked.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Confrontations\
  \ with a summoner gone bad in the final chapter of \"Faithful Servants.\"</p> \n\
