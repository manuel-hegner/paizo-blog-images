  \ Guide</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, March 10, 2011</p> \n   <p>It's been\
  \ quite a few weeks since my last report. I've learned a lot since then... too much\
  \ to reveal to you all in a single report, but I wanted to make sure those idiot\
  \ Thrunies weren't on to me. Looks like I'm safe, though. I've kept an eye out for\
  \ Thrune agents since my last report, but haven't seen or heard anything. Which\
  \ means it's safe for me to start sending regular reports!</p> \n   <p>One thing\
  \ I noticed in the vaults below Egorian was a sizable collection of intelligence\
  \ on numerous adventuring groups active throughout the Inner Sea region. At first\
  \ I thought this was just the Thrunies keeping track of potential enemies, but after\
  \ sifting through the stacks, I realized it was quite the opposite. They've been\
  \ watching a lot of cults, mercenary groups, and other troublemakers who they hope\
  \ to ally with, perhaps to use as agents to send against their enemies. And since\
  \ the enemy of Thrune is my friend, I figured that letting my friends know about\
  \ enemies they don't know about yet would be a good thing. If that makes any sense.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Anyway, my point is that Thrune's collected quite a bit of information\
  \ about these potential rivals, and I snatched dossiers for ten of them. I've sent\
  \ them on to the Pathfinders, and they've promised to publish the information when\
  \ they get a chance. They're thinking of calling it something like \"A Comprehensive\
  \ Guide to Rivals,\" despite the fact that I think the shorter \"Rival Guide\" is\
  \ more to the point and doesn't imply that these are the only rivals we'll ever\
  \ face. Just ten groups of them.</p> \n  </blockquote>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n\
  \   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" hspace=\"9\" align=\"\

  \  </div>\n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Of those ten groups, we've got a mercenary band\
  \ from Brevoy more active these days in the River Kingdoms, a sadistic group of\
  \ incredibly powerful adventurers, some elf-hating agents of the Aspis Consortium\
  \ down Sargavawards, a bunch of crazy pirates led by some sort of haunted oracle,\
  \ some foolhardy giant-hunters up in Varisia, a group of slavers led by a barbaric\
  \ gnoll down around Katapesh, some freaky assassins or murderers up in Ustalav,\
  \ and even the Queen's Hands—a group of relentless investigators who work for Queen\
  \ Abrogail herself. (Fortunately, the Queen's Hands don't seem to get up to the\
  \ north side here that often.) The Pathfinders were obviously most interested in\
  \ some group based in Absalom—the Poisoned Lodge, or some such—a group of poisoners\
  \ and drug dealers that have been annoying some of the Pathfinders of late. But\
  \ to me, the most interesting group was probably the Dust Coven—a group of exiled\
  \ drow worshipers of the demon lord Shax who have been cutting a murder-swath through\
  \ the Inner Sea of late. Their leader is a witch (who seems to have been reincarnated\
  \ from a drow into an annis hag, if the rumors are to be believed) who specializes\
  \ in all sorts of magical dusts and powders—I'm including descriptions of two of\
  \ these in this report. They'll be in the \"Rival Guide\" or whatever that book\
  \ ends up being called, along with lots of other information about these groups\
  \ and the specialized magic, spells, and tools they use. I'm also including an illustration\
  \ of the Dust Coven's sign—the rune of Shak gripped in a creepy-looking hand. (Someone\
  \ could do with a manicure.)</p> \n  </blockquote>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n \

  \ book on store shelves.</p> \n   <p style=\"clear:both;\">Shensen<br> Old Cheliax\
