  \ Ballroom in the Indianapolis Convention Center. Flew in the night before last\
  \ from the United Kingdom to start setting up for Gen Con, which kicks off this\
  \ Thursday. Yesterday morning, the Sag was empty, with three lonely pallets of stuff\
  \ shipped from Paizo home offices. At its busiest, there were 30ish people bustling\
  \ around, hanging banners, moving tables, and getting the basics set up.</p> \n\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>I really enjoyed attending PaizoCon UK. At roughly 180\
  \ attendees, it is large enough to offer a good variety of games but small enough\
  \ to know many of the attendees. Seeing old friends made me smile and I met many\
  \ lovely new friends. Started pre-convention gaming by running Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Guild Season of the Runelords, but got pulled away for meetings and left\
  \ subsequent games in the able hands of con attendees. Over the course of PaizoCon\
  \ UK, I ran two tables of the retired Third Riddle, joined the Aspis in <em>Serpent's\
  \ Ire</em>, put my characters social skills to the test in <em>Bid for Alabastrine</em>,\
  \ and thwarted thieves in <em>The Sun Orchid Scheme</em>. The opportunity engage\
  \ with players/GMs and interact over Pathfinder Society was delightful and I hope\
  \ to do so again very soon.</p> \n    <h2>Roleplaying Guild Guide</h2> \n    <p>As\
  \ Year of the Serpent draws to its close and we prepare to launch Season 8: Year\
  \ of the Stolen Storm, it's time for a new <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><em>Roleplaying\
  \ Guild Guide</em></a>! I've given it a final look over now and turned it over to\
  \ Chris Lambertz to work her magic and get it uploaded. Those familiar with past\
  \ guides will note this the reworked format. It is designed so that you only access\
  \ the information you need, with separate chapters for players &amp; GMs. As you\
  \ use the new guide, please send feedback to the team at <a href=\"mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com\"\
  >pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a> on what works well and what you would like to see\
  \ changed for the next version.</p> \n    <p>The setup at the Sag is ongoing, the\
  \ banners slowly transforming the space from plain hall to Pathfinder Society Headquarters.\
  \ Today, Gen Con leads Jon Cary and Bob Jonquet arrived and we started unloading\
  \ pallets, building shelving, and emptying boxes. Lead Todd Morgan arrives tomorrow\
  \ and will assist in putting the final touches on the event. Extra hands are always\
  \ appreciated, so if you're in Indianapolis and have a few hours, come on by, say\
  \ \"Hi!\" and help us set up for the best four days in gaming!</p> \n    <p>Tonya\
