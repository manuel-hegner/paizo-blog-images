  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Valeros slashed out desperately with both of his\
  \ blades as he pushed back away from the trio of mummies that had emerged from the\
  \ darkened crypt. Ancient, ensorcelled bandages fell to the floor in a cloud of\
  \ dust as the arm of one of the horrors was severed at the elbow. Apparently uncaring\
  \ of the grievous wound, the mummy continued to shamble forward, reaching out with\
  \ its remaining hand as it tried to find the warrior's throat. Valeros continued\
  \ to backpedal, but suddenly pitched over onto his back, his foot stumbling over\
  \ one of the many canopic jars that littered the floor.</i></p> \n     <p><i>Quite\
  \ suddenly, Merisiel emerged from the shadows and drove the blade of her rapier\
  \ through the first mummy's head just as it was reaching down to finish off Valeros.\
  \ As the undead thing collapsed to the floor, Merisiel extended her hand to help\
  \ the fighter off the floor. </i></p> \n     <p><i>\"There had better be some valuable\
  \ treasure in this tomb\" she said with a wink before turning to face the remaining\
  \ mummies.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Merisiel,\
  \ and all of you players and GMs out there, are sure to get all the valuable treasure\
  \ you need in just 4 weeks with the release of <a href=\"/products/btpy8rcd\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Equipment</i></a>. Each week, leading up to the book's release, we are going to\
  \ be showing off a sample treasure haul from this mighty tome. Up this week, the\
  \ loot from a CR 8 encounter with a trio of mummies.</span></p> \n    <p>Mummies,\
  \ being undead, can have a wide variety of treasure types. Since we have 5,000 gp\
  \ to spend on treasure for this encounter, I think we will give out something from\
  \ Treasure Type F: Combatant Gear and a little something from Treasure Type C: Art\
  \ Objects. Undead don't usually have art objects, but it makes sense for this encounter\
  \ and the treasure types are flexible in this way.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p><b>Treasure Type F: Combatant Gear<br> 4,000 gp Reward (total value 3,705\
  \ gp)</b><br> mithril shirt, masterwork longspear, <i>buffering cap, potion of remove\
  \ paralysis</i></p> \n     <p><b>Treasure Type C: Art Objects<br> 1,000 gp Reward\
  \ (total value 1,200 gp)</b><br> gold mask (worth 450 gp), gold-and-platinum statue\
  \ of a deity (worth 750 gp)</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Not a bad haul for\
  \ one encounter, and you can easily picture one of the mummies wearing the mask,\
  \ while the other valuables are located in the tomb itself, with the statue as the\
  \ center point of the room. You could even put the statue on some sort of trap,\
  \ which might give you the opportunity to add even more treasure to the encounter.\
  \ One of the great things about this book is that sometimes the charts and tables\
  \ can give you ideas to flesh out the encounter and add an extra level of detail\
  \ to the surroundings. After all, the players always pay attention to the loot.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Well, that's all for this week. Next week, our brave heroes will be facing\
  \ off against a fire giant and his hell hound minions!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
