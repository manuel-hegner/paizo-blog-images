  >\"Ambush in Absalom,\"</a> was released in the pages of <i>Kobold Quarterly</i>\
  \ (and has since been made available as a free PDF here on paizo.com). Last spring,\
  \ knowing that we'd soon be using quests as the format of our Pathfinder Society\
  \ Open Call and urged by Kobold-in-Chief Wolfgang Baur to put some new Pathfinder\
  \ Society content in the magazine, I asked frequent KQ contributor and my fellow\
  \ Pathfinder developer Adam Daigle to write one up for me. And did he ever!</span></p>\

  \    <p>Called \"The Urge to Evolve,\" this Tier 3â€“7 quest features a sinister plot\
  \ by a powerful outsider who needs to consume humanoid spirits in order to increase\
  \ its own might. Set in Magnimar, this adventure can easily be used during the Year\
  \ of the Risen Rune as a time-filler or quick demo (using either 4th- or 7th-level\
  \ pregenerated characters for those new to the game), and fits thematically with\
  \ the Varisian focus of the current season. The adventure consists of just a single\
  \ encounter and should take no more than an hour to complete, so organizers will\
  \ likely have many opportunities to run it, even over the course of a single game\
  \ day.</p> \n    <p>You can find the Chronicle sheet for this quest on its product\
  \ page or download it below. We'll eventually release this as a standalone product\
  \ like we did with \"Ambush in Absalom,\" but for the foreseeable future, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8va0\"><i>Kobold Quarterly #23</i></a> is the place to get this exciting\
  \ new adventure. I can't wait to hear what people think!</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"\
