  \ next round of sanctioning for Starfinder Society—including the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/attackOfTheSwarm\"\
  >Attack of the Swarm!</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy\"\
  >Threefold Conspiracy</a> Adventure Paths Chronicle Sheets. If you missed that blog,\
  \ you can catch up <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3i\">here</a>!</p>\n\
  \              <p>Now it’s Pathfinder’s turn. The team finished their review of\
  \ the products and consulted with our community’s Additional Resource team about\
  \ what best fit the Organized Play environment. Instead of waiting for an updated\
  \ web page with formatting, we decided to get everything into our players’ hands.\
  \ That doesn’t mean a new site with better layout isn’t coming, we just didn’t want\
  \ to hold things up any longer waiting our turn in the web queue. All the rulebooks\
  \ and Lost Omens products, up to and including <a ahref=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em></a>, appear in this update, so\
  \ there is plenty to choose from. Apologies for the length—If you want to find a\
  \ particular section, we suggest using control + F and the name of the book you’\
  re looking for.</p>\n              <p>We made a few changes to the layout and structure\
  \ of the character options, as well as how we look at what we include in the campaign.\
  \ To help players understand what goes into character options, as well as the parameters\
  \ and criteria in how we address concepts, we included a new section at the top\
  \ of this document. Some of the items in this section include core assumptions,\
  \ table policy, and access. This information is being migrated to the guide and\
  \ will appear there with the next update.</p>\n              <p>You’ve waited long\
  \ enough, so without further ado, here is the first batch of Pathfinder Society\
  \ (Second Edition) character options!</p>\n              <p>I’ll see you next week\
  \ for our beginning of the month update on Society!</p>\n              <p>Until\

  \               </ul>\n              </ul>\n              <p>To use an option from\
  \ any source other than the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>, the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Bestiary</em>, or the <em>Lost Omens World Guide</em> in Pathfinder Society play,\
  \ you must bring any one of the following to your game table:</p>\n            \
  \  <ul>\n               <li>A physical copy of the book you wish to use</li>\n \
  \              <li>A name-watermarked PDF copy of the book</li>\n              \
  \ <li>Name-watermarked printouts of all relevant pages you wish to use from the\
  \ PDF</li>\n               <li>Access to the rules you wish to use in the form of\
  \ either electronic access to the Pathfinder Reference Document (paizo.com/prd)\
  \ or a photocopy of the relevant pages, along with proof of purchase, such as a\
  \ receipt from a game store or a screenshot of your My Downloads page on paizo.com.</li>\n\
  \              </ul>\n              <p>The following do not satisfy this requirement:</p>\n\
  \              <ul>\n               <li>A photocopy of a physical book with no proof\
  \ of purchase</li>\n               <li>Printouts from electronic character builders\
  \ such as Hero Lab</li>\n               <li>Content reproduced in other sources\
  \ under the Open Gaming License (such as an online reference document or a homemade\
  \ omnibus)</li>\n              </ul>\n              <p>Family members, significant\
  \ others, or other members of the same household (such as roommates) can share resources\
  \ if they are playing at the same table, rather than requiring a separate copy of\
  \ the same book for each person. A group of friends that always plays together at\
  \ the same table fulfills this requirement, as long as all the necessary materials\
  \ for each character's options are present. Members playing at separate tables must\
  \ each supply their own materials as normal.</p>\n              <p>In addition to\
  \ the copy of the rules themselves, you must be able to provide an electronic or\
  \ physical copy of the below Additional Resources page for that source to show that\
  \ the options you have selected for your character are legal for play.</p>\n   \
  \           <h3><font color=\"maroon\">Rarity, Access, and Availability</font></h3>\n\
  \              <p>Character options for Pathfinder Society play have one of three\
  \ levels of availability: standard, limited, or restricted.</p>\n              <p><b>Standard:</b>\
  \ These options follow the standard rules as printed in their respective sourcebooks.\
  \ If a character wants to take this option, they must meet all its <b>prerequisites</b>\
  \ as usual. If the option is uncommon or rarer, they must also have access to the\
  \ option. Characters can gain <b>access</b> in a variety of ways. They can gain\
  \ access by virtue of their origin, religion, or their membership in certain organizations\
  \ (see below sections). Selecting certain common character options can give you\
  \ access to other, rarer ones; for instance, a gnome who takes the Gnome Weapon\
  \ Familiarity ancestry feat gains access to uncommon gnome weapons. Specific boons—\
  such as from the Achievement Points system or Chronicle Sheets—can also grant access\
  \ to these options.</p>\n              <p><b>Limited:</b> A limited option is rarer\
  \ in Society play, but not unheard of. A limited option can be selected only if\
  \ specifically allowed by a boon—whether from the Achievement Points system, a Chronicle\
  \ Sheet, or another other option from a Pathfinder Society source—even if the option\
  \ is common or if the character meets the normal prerequisites or access requirements\
  \ printed in the option’s source.</p>\n              <p><b>Restricted:</b> A restricted\
  \ option is one that is not generally appropriate for all tables or conducive to\
  \ the Pathfinder Society's shared campaign setting, such as a one-of-a-kind weapon,\
  \ a horrific spell used by only the most evil magic-users, or player options that\
  \ require high degrees of GM adjudication. Such options will generally be made available\
  \ for Society Play in only a very few special cases, such as via boons given out\
  \ as part of charity events, if at all.</p>\n              <h3><font color=\"maroon\"\
  >Character Origin</font></h3>\n              <p>When you create a character, you\
  \ can choose their origin, including their ethnicity and nationality/region of origin.\
  \ These choices might allow your character to take certain character options. For\
  \ instance, humans of Jadwiga ethnicity descend from the witch-queens of Irrisen,\
  \ and they can take the Irriseni Ice-Witch feat to represent this connection. Similarly,\
  \ characters from the Broken Lands have access to the Aldori dueling swords that\
  \ are iconic to that region.</p>\n              <p>If your character is of mixed\
  \ ethnicity or comes from multiple regions of origin, then for the purposes of game\
  \ balance, you choose one ethnicity and one region of origin that your character\
  \ can use to satisfy prerequisite and access conditions for character options. This\
  \ affects only the character options you can select, and in no way limits your character’\
  s identity or story.</p>\n              <p>Certain boons, such as Home Region or\
  \ Multicultural Training, can allow you to change or expand your character’s origin\
  \ for the purpose of qualifying for character options, to reflect their life experiences.</p>\n\
  \              <h3><font color=\"maroon\">Religion</font></h3>\n              <p>When\
  \ you create a character, you can choose their religion or philosophy. If your character\
  \ is of a class that directly interacts with the divine, such as a cleric or a champion,\
  \ you must make this choice at first level as part of gaining your class abilities.\
  \ However, characters of any class might be allowed to certain character options\
  \ based on the deity they follow. For instance, all followers of Abadar gain access\
  \ to Abadar’s <em>flawless scale</em>, a magic item considered holy by the faith.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Characters can worship and gain mechanical benefits from any deity\
  \ listed in the table of gods on page 437 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> or detailed\
  \ in <em>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em>, so long as their alignment matches one\
  \ of the deity’s listed follower alignments. Note that some deities, such as Rovagug\
  \ or Urgathoa, allow only evil followers; as Society characters cannot be lawful\
  \ evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil, these deities cannot be worshiped to gain\
  \ benefits in Society play. Characters can also be agnostic, atheist, or can follow\
  \ the tenets of philosophies (<em>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em> 94–101) rather\
  \ than deities.</p>\n              <p>Your character can participate in the rituals\
  \ and cultural aspects of a deity’s faith without being a worshipper of that deity;\
  \ for instance, citizens of the diabolic nation of Cheliax might participate in\
  \ state holidays revering Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness, but only lawful evil\
  \ followers are true worshippers of his faith.</p>\n              <p>If your character\
  \ worships multiple deities, then for the purposes of game balance, you choose one\
  \ deity that your character can use to satisfy prerequisite and access conditions\
  \ for character options. This affects only the character options you can select,\
  \ and in no way limits your character’s identity or story.</p>\n              <h4><font\
  \ color=\"#daa520\">Pantheons</font></h4>\n              <p>Characters can also\
  \ follow pantheons (<em>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em> 92) instead of specific\
  \ deities, in which case they gain the benefits of the pantheon as a whole. Characters\
  \ in Society play must choose a patron deity when following a pantheon. They can\
  \ use both their patron deity and the pantheon as a whole to satisfy access and\
  \ prerequisites, but not any other deities in the pantheon individually. For instance,\
  \ a lawful neutral cleric could worship the Godclaw, with Iomedae as her patron\
  \ deity, in which case she could take options related to both Iomedae and the Godclaw,\
  \ but this wouldn’t automatically allow her to take options related to Torag, Irori,\
  \ Abadar, or Asmodeus.</p>\n              <h4><font color=\"#daa520\">Edicts and\
  \ Anathema in Society Play</font></h4>\n              <p>Several characters, such\
  \ as clerics or champions, must abide by the edicts and anathema of their deity\
  \ to receive divine powers from that deity. To allow a wide variety of characters\
  \ in Society play, the rules around edicts and anathema are slightly relaxed. It\
  \ is generally assumed that all characters can participate in Pathfinder Society\
  \ adventures without running afoul of their deity’s edicts and anathema—attempting\
  \ to perform the primary objective of an official Pathfinder Society mission by\
  \ itself will not cause a character to fall out of favor with their deity. For example,\
  \ Pharasma prohibits robbing tombs, but a cleric of Pharasma can accept a Society\
  \ mission to retrieve an artifact from a pyramid, confident that the Society has\
  \ gone through the proper channels to secure the right to retrieve the artifact.</p>\n\
  \              <p>While edicts are valorous actions praised by a deity, a character\
  \ does not need to perform their deity’s edicts to the exclusion of other activities,\
  \ or if doing so would prevent the smooth progression of play at the table. When\
  \ considering anathema, note that a character must actively and personally commit\
  \ an anathemic act in Society play to incur consequences with their deity, and is\
  \ not liable for the actions of their party members. For instance, a champion of\
  \ Sarenrae could not personally lie to a guard when infiltrating a city, but they\

  \       <ul>\n                <li>The snares created with the Snare Genius kobold\

  \ or during your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.</li>\n        \
  \        <li>The Tusks orc ancestry feat (page 18) requires the character to file\

  \ retraining process and does not take any additional time.</li>\n             \
  \   <li>The temporary Hit Points granted by the Spell Devourer orc ancestry feat\
  \ (page 19) are applied as soon as the character succeeds at their saving throw;\
  \ for an effect that causes Hit Point damage on a successful save, such as a <em>fireball</em>,\
  \ this means that the character gains the temporary Hit Points before taking damage.</li>\n\
  \                <li>Unless specifically noted otherwise, most wands and scrolls\
  \ are less than 1 foot long and can fit into a ratfolk’s Cheek Pouches (page 22).</li>\n\
  \                <li>Per design team clarification, the Homeward Bound gnome feat\
  \ (page 44) should be of uncommon rarity.</li>\n                <li>Per design team\
  \ clarification, the Speed penalty inflicted by the Kneecap feat (page 45) has a\
  \ duration of 1 round.</li>\n                <li>GMs should provide a character\
  \ with the That’s Odd investigator feat (page 60) a hint whenever the character\
  \ enters a room with hidden aspects, specifically with regard to hidden passageways\
  \ (such as scuff marks near a bookcase that’s actually a swinging door), creatures\
  \ or hazards (such as drippage on the floor from an unseen fungus growing on the\
  \ rafters), or valuables (such as bunched carpet over a secret compartment in the\
  \ floor that contains a bag of coins). The GM does not need to provide clues for\
  \ rooms that have no significant secret or hidden features. These clues should indicate\
  \ only that the character should investigate a given section of the room, not let\
  \ them automatically uncover the hidden element or provide any additional information\
  \ beyond signaling its presence.</li>\n                <li>GMs should let a character\
  \ with the Sense the Unseen investigator feat (page 64) know when the trigger for\
  \ the ability has been met so they can use the feat if they so choose.</li>\n  \
  \              <li>Given the slightly relaxed rules around edicts and anathema in\
  \ Society play, a barbarian with the superstition instinct (page 108) can benefit\
  \ from spells and magic items if they are an unavoidable part of a Society adventure,\
  \ such as if a scenario assumes the PCs are transported to their mission location\
  \ via a <em>teleport</em> spell, or if an adventure requires that all PCs participate\
  \ in a magical ritual.</li>\n                <li>Per design team clarification,\
  \ when a barbarian uses the Sunder Spell feat (page 111) against a spell like <em>wall\
  \ of fire</em> that does not have a listed AC, the Strike hits automatically—the\
  \ barbarian simply rolls the counteract check.</li>\n                <li>A cavalier\
  \ (page 184) can pledge to a legal deity, religion, or pantheon, an organization\
  \ they have access to, or the Pathfinder Society. The edicts and anathema of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society are as follows:<br><b>Edicts</b>: Explore important sites,\
  \ report and record your discoveries, and cooperate with fellow Pathfinders<br><b>Anathema</b>:\
  \ Fail to explore, report and cooperate; defy the will of a venture-captain or the\
  \ Decemvirate</li>\n                <li>A vigilante’s Safe House (page 196), can\
  \ be located in any city or near any lodge they have received a Pathfinder briefing.\
  \ A vigilante can use their downtime to relocate their safe house. A vigilante can\
  \ use their safe house only if it is in the town or location where their current\
  \ adventure is taking place.</li>\n                <li>The DCs for the Armor Assist\
  \ feat (page 203) are not subject to GM adjudication. Rather, simply use the default\
  \ DCs listed in the feat: 15 for common armor, 20 for uncommon armor, and 25 for\
  \ rare armor.</li>\n                <li>For the purposes of Society play, the <b>Targets</b>\
  \ entry for the <em>claim undead</em> (page 230) oracle revelation spell is “1 mindless\
  \ undead creature”, not “1 undead creature.” The intent of this change is to reduce\
  \ the prevalence of domination magic on sapient creatures in Society play.</li>\n\
  \                <li>Strikes made by a <em>malicious shadow</em> (page 238) use\
  \ the spellcaster’s spell attack roll.</li>\n               </ul>\n            \
