  \ Dead!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, February 25, 2008 </p> \n   <p>In <i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ #8, we explore what happens to a typical fantasy city when the plague comes to\
  \ town. The plague in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdd\">\"Seven Days to the Grave\"\
  </a> is called blood veil, but it's primary inspiration is, of course, the bubonic\
  \ plagueâ€”the Black Death. To supplement this volume's adventure, we present an article\
  \ that discusses all sorts of diseases, plagues, how epidemics work, and what can\
  \ be done to combat them. Rules for several diseases beyond those listed in the\
  \ core rules are presented as well, most of them based on real-world diseases. Check\
  \ out the entry for the aforementioned bubonic plague as an example.</p> \n   <p><b>Bubonic\
  \ Plague</b>: Infected vermin and parasites spread this disease, also known as Daemon's\
  \ Touch or the Black Death, through their bites. Once contracted, the disease spreads\
  \ quickly, polluting the victim's body with toxins. When it reaches the lymph nodes,\
  \ the victim suffers extreme inflammation of glands, and his skin might take on\
  \ a black pallor. Symptoms include fever, headaches, nausea, fatigue, and swelling\
  \ of the lymph nodes (called buboes) on the neck, underarms, and inner thigh areas,\
  \ and eventually bleeding beneath the skin. A victim who takes any Constitution\
  \ damage from the disease must immediately make a successful Fortitude save or become\
  \ fatigued until all his Constitution damage is healed. Each time a victim takes\
  \ 2 points of Constitution damage from Black Death, he also takes 1 point of Charisma\
  \ damage.</p> \n   <p>With symptoms like that, is it any wonder that artists did\
  \ their best to anthropomorphize the disease back in the days of the Black Death?\
  \ Sort of like what's going on here, with a maiden, a chipmunk, and a skeleton prancing\
  \ around a stump? (That chipmunk takes the picture to an entire new level, if you\
  \ ask me... especially since he's probably FULL of bubonic plague!)</p> \n   <p>\
