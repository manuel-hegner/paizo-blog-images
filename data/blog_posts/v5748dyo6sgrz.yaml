  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">We're only a few short\
  \ weeks away from Gen Con, the release of Pathfinder's Second Edition opening books,\
  \ and the launch of the new Pathfinder Society campaign! Phew! In the coming weeks\
  \ we'll be previewing scenarios, pregenerated characters, the Guide, but today we're\
  \ going to talk about one of the final character creation elements. Character creation\
  \ works in basically the same way as is described in the soon-to-be-released Pathfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook: choose your ancestry, select a background, pick your class, and\
  \ you're well on your way. These are the A(ncestry), B(ackground), C(lass)s of character\
  \ design, and my colleagues Mark Seifter and Linda Zayas-Palmer will be on <a href=\"\
  https://www.twitch.tv/knowdirection\" target=\"_new\">Know Direction</a> at 9 pm\
  \ EST/6 pm PST tonight to go through the character creation process. </p> \n   \
  \   <p> But there are two special considerations in building your Pathfinder Society\
  \ character. One of them is factions, which we've described in numerous earlier\
  \ blogs (check out <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/organizedPlay\"\
  >the three faction previews from May and June</a>). Just as in Starfinder Society,\
  \ adventuring earns your PC Reputation (which unlocks potential rewards) and Fame\
  \ (which lets you purchase those rewards). Collectively, these grant your PC an\
  \ extra edge. </p> \n      <p> And today we're going to address the other feature:\
  \ training. </p> \n      <p> Published well before I started work at Paizo, <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpy8az2?Pathfinder-Chronicles-Seekers-of-Secrets-A-Guide-to-the-Pathfinder-Society\"\
  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Seekers of Secrets</a> has always served as one of\
  \ the foundational lore resources for the team, from understanding the in-world\
  \ Society's role to getting a sense of where there are Pathfinder lodges. It also\
  \ introduces the three deans of the Pathfinder Society—Kreighton Shaine, the Master\
  \ of Scrolls; Aram Zey, the Master of Spells (since replaced by Sorrina Westyr);\
  \ and Marcos Farabellus, the Master of Swords—each of who play a role in training\
  \ initiates for the rigors of the adventuring world. <em>Seekers of Secrets</em>\
  \ helpfully explains how the Scrolls lessons feature translation and insight, the\
  \ Spells focus on understanding and surviving magical threats, and the Swords involves\
  \ a mix of athleticism, combat fundamentals, and spelunking basics. However, we've\
  \ just never been terribly clear about what's involved in the deans' oversight,\
  \ what role the three “schools” play in an established field agent's exploits, or\
  \ whether any of that reflects on the gameplay experience. In designing the Second\
  \ Edition organized play experience, we wanted to change that. </p> \n      <p>\
  \ When you build a player character in the Second Edition Pathfinder Society campaign,\
  \ you'll have three points to distribute between the three schools, representing\
  \ how much your PC focused on those school's curricula while training as an initiate.\
  \ Each point you invest in a school gives a small benefit that's relevant throughout\
  \ your character's entire career, representing not only the lessons you learned\
  \ but also the life-long professional contacts you made during that time. </p> \n\
  \      <p> If you'd like to assign one point to each school, you'll receive fairly\
  \ balanced benefits. This choice opens access to a bunch of options and represents\
  \ having a Pathfinder with a well-rounded education. If you relish the idea of a\
  \ more focused character, even mixing unlikely class-school combinations like a\
  \ barbarian with 3 points in Spells, consider spending your points on just one or\
  \ two schools. You can easily assign two points to Scrolls and one to Spells, or\
  \ you could pile all three into Swords. It's your call! </p> \n      <p> Just what\
  \ does your Pathfinder training provide? The core mechanic is access to consumable\
  \ items. These represent colleagues' experimental draughts, tools provided by the\
  \ Grand Lodge, or additional gear loaned out by a venture-captain from their own\
  \ inventories. Just after the mission briefing, you'll be able to requisition one\
  \ consumable item for use during the adventure. If you don't use it by the end of\
  \ the adventure, your character returns it. As to what consumable items can you\
  \ acquire - that depends on your school. </p> \n      <p> <strong>1 Point:</strong>\
  \ By investing 1 point in a school, you have access to that school's item list,\
  \ and at every odd-numbered level, more options become available for each school.\
  \ In addition, everyone has access to a list of basic healing and bomb options (a\
  \ bomb refers to the classic “splash” weapons like alchemist's fire and acid flasks).\
  \ The starting options for these appear later in this blog. </p> \n      <p> <strong>2\
  \ Points:</strong> By investing a second point in a school, the PC begins with a\
  \ bonus Lore skill from a list tied to the school. At 5th level, the PC also gains\
  \ a bonus skill feat from a list tied to that school, representing the PC's ongoing\
  \ training. </p> \n      <p> <strong>3 Points:</strong> By investing all three points\
  \ in a school, the PC gains a second consumable item at the start of the adventure,\
  \ though the bonus item's level must be half the PC's level or lower. </p> \n  \
  \    <p> Let's take a look at what consumable items are available at 1st level for\
  \ each school. </p> \n      <p> <strong>All Schools (1):</strong> <em>holy water</em>,\
  \ lesser [bomb], lesser antidote, lesser antiplague, <emsminor healing < em>\n \
  \       potion\n        <br> \n        <strong>Scrolls (1):</strong> \n        <em>feather\
  \ token (ladder), lesser eagle-eye charm, owlbear charm,</em> sunrod, \n       \
  \ <em>wolf fang</em>\n        <br> \n        <strong>Spells (1):</strong> a scroll\
  \ with one of the following 1st-level spells: \n        <em>burning hands, charm,\
  \ fear, harm, heal, mage armor, magic fang, magic missile, magic weapon,</em> or\
  \ \n        <em>soothe</em>.\n        <br> \n        <strong>Swords (1):</strong>\
  \ lesser leaper's elixir, \n        <em>potency crystal</em>, \n        <em>shining\
  \ ammunition</em> \n       </emsminor></p> \n      <p> When in doubt, you can always\
  \ choose a healing potion, but having some extra school support means you're more\
  \ likely to have access to the perfect tool for the job. In return, it's assumed\
  \ that your PC spends some of their downtime assisting their colleagues in a similar\
  \ way, whether that's mixing up alchemical elixirs, helping repair a lodge, assisting\
  \ an old friend from back when you were both initiates together, or mentoring the\
  \ next generation of explorers. Pay it forward. </p> \n      <p> What about if you\
  \ don't care about the training system? No problem—we asked ourselves the same question\
  \ when first brainstorming this system, and we realized that we could also address\
  \ one of the other less-explored aspects of the Pathfinder Society: field-commissioned\
  \ agents. These are the explorers who have already made a name for themselves by\
  \ the time they cross paths with the Society and for whom a venture-captain chooses\
  \ to waive the traditional three years of training before sponsoring that adventurer\
  \ to join the Pathfinders. A field-commissioned agent (i.e. a PC who invests none\
  \ of those three points in any schools) lacks the deep collegial relationships that\
  \ a formally trained Pathfinder enjoys, and that's represented as restricted access\
  \ to those free consumable items. On the other hand, those agents don't have nearly\
  \ the same obligations as the other Pathfinders, and that means field-commissioned\
  \ agents earn more Downtime per level than other PCs. </p> \n      <p> And if being\
  \ a field-commissioned agent really fits your backstory, but you'd like to use the\
  \ training points (or maybe your agent was classically trained but eschews assisting\
  \ colleagues and ignores the training system), that's cool, too. The training system's\
  \ a bonus to provide your character tools to survive whatever the adventuring life\
  \ throws their way, not to tie your hands as to the stories you can tell. We're\
  \ looking forward to seeing it in action, and we're looking forward to seeing many\
  \ of you at Gen Con! </p> \n      <p> And again, check out Know Direction's live\
  \ stream tonight for all the character creation insights! </p> \n      <p style=\"\
