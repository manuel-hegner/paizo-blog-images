  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The tunnel ran smooth\
  \ and deep, a gullet boring down into frozen ground, beckoning explorers into its\
  \ belly. Ariad-N5 planned to accept its invitation. Nifri joined Ariad at the edge\
  \ of the chasm.</p> \n     <p>“This is it,” the kasatha said, cross-referencing\
  \ the coordinates displayed on his datapad. Together they peered down at the decrepit\
  \ ramp that curled nautilus-like within the tunnel. </p> \n     <p>“I’m ready to\
  \ get out of this cold,” Talla grumbled. The quorlu trudged through the deep snow,\
  \ her movements slowed by the thermal suit she wore to protect her sensitive skin\
  \ from the frigid temperatures. This was a first; in all their years working together,\
  \ Ariad had never heard her complain. </p> \n     <p>“Construction’s delayed until\
  \ we survey the ruins, so AbadarCorp wants us in and out.” Talla explained. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>“What’s our timeline?” Ariad asked. “We need a few weeks to—”</p> \n\
  \     <p>“The corp gave us 12 hours,” Talla snapped. Ariad and Nifri exchanged concerned\
  \ looks, but their leader appeared unphased by the impossible deadline. She studied\
  \ the ramp and shook her head decisively. “Looks unstable. We’ll rappel down.” Nifri\
  \ helped her create an anchor using two ice screws connected by a sling, then ran\
  \ a cable line through it. The three explorers clipped in with practiced technique.\
  \ Nifri rappelled down first, the crunch of boots against ice echoing through his\
  \ open comm channel. Then, he looped his cable through a belay device to assist\
  \ Talla, leaving the android alone in a swirl of snow at the edge of the ruins.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>“Your turn,” Nifri said finally. “I’m on belay.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  On rappel.” Ariad gripped their cable and kicked off from the ledge. They watched\
  \ the sky shrink as they walked down the side of the tunnel in a controlled descent.\
  \ Suddenly, their toe caught a patch of ice, and they plunged downward. Ariad grabbed\
  \ for the nearby ramp, but it crumbled in their grip. The cable snapped taut as\
  \ Nifri caught them, and a chunk of debris plummeted toward their teammates below.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Rock!” Ariad shouted. Nifri sidestepped and the rubble shattered harmlessly\
  \ on the ground beside him.</p> \n     <p>“Close one, thanks!” He yelled.</p> \n\
  \     <p>When the android reached the end of the cable, a dim halo of light was\
  \ all that remained of the world above. Their eyes roamed over the alien architecture\
  \ surrounding them. The walls were mottled red and purple like the exposed intestines\
  \ of a great beast. Brown, scabby patches festered in places, but there was no scent\
  \ of decay. Metallic panels embedded into the fleshy walls reinforced the structure,\
  \ and a glowing blue pillar towered at the center of the cavernous chamber. The\
  \ wall rippled as a constellation of arcane symbols flashed across its surface.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Did you see that?” Ariad whispered. Talla gasped as the same symbols\
  \ wriggled into view across the room.</p> \n     <p>“Fascinating,” she breathed.\
  \ “There’s magic all around us.” Nifri, transfixed by the blue pillar, ignored them.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Old wards, perhaps, or maybe this peculiar building material is magical,”\
  \ Ariad observed, peering at the wall where the symbols had appeared. They avoided\
  \ touching the nonmetal parts during their examination; the spongy reddish substance\
  \ made their dermis crawl. </p> \n     <p>“Let’s move on,” Talla directed, and motioned\
  \ toward an aperture on the far side of the room. Before she stepped through it\
  \ a deep, percussive boom reverberated through the ruins. A shape charged out of\
  \ the shadows, and Talla instinctively reached for the pistol holstered at her belt.\
  \ She relaxed when she recognized Nifri, all four of his arms flailing as he sprinted\
  \ toward them. </p> \n     <p>“It…shocked…me,” he panted, skidding to a halt.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“What shocked you?” Ariad asked. They peered into the kasatha’s eyes,\
  \ examining him for pupil dilation and other signs of trauma. Then they noticed\
  \ his bare hands. “What happened to your safety gloves?” </p> \n     <p>“I took\
  \ them off before I touched the pillar,” Nifri admitted. “I know it’s against protocol,\
  \ but I wanted to gauge its temperature.”</p> \n     <p>“You should have used a\
  \ thermal scanner,” Ariad scolded. </p> \n     <p>“Enough,” Talla pronounced calmly.\
  \ “Once, I got so enthusiastic about an excavation that my team leader had to pry\
  \ me off a trapped statue.” She chuckled at the memory. “Not my finest hour. Are\
  \ you hurt?”</p> \n     <p>“Only my pride,” Nifri said sheepishly. Talla smiled\
  \ at him.</p> \n     <p>“Remember your training, and stick with safety protocols\
  \ from now on,” Talla commanded. With the incident dismissed, they emerged into\
  \ a hallway studded with valve-like openings that hinted at a vast network of chambers\
  \ within the ruins. As they passed the abandoned rooms, Nifri’s flashlight illuminated\
  \ the silhouettes of machinery somehow both antiquated and advanced, now immortalized\
  \ in disrepair. </p> \n     <p>“If you’d purchased those retinal reflectors I recommended,\
  \ you wouldn’t need that.” Ariad nodded to Nifri’s flashlight. </p> \n     <p>“\
  I’m saving my credits for a tropical vacation. I got more than enough hands, so\
  \ don’t worry, Ensie.” Nifri retorted, but his voice lacked its usual confidence.\
  \ Ariad often struggled to read others’ emotions, but they had no problem interpreting\
  \ their colleagues’ behavior. Nifri’s shallow breathing and Talla’s frantic heartbeat\
  \ betrayed their fear. Ariad noted the prickle of adrenaline in their own system.\
  \ They knew the source of these symptoms—the hideous decaying walls, unidentified\
  \ magic crawling through the air, the ruins’ reaction when Nifri touched the pillar—\
  this was not a routine survey. </p> \n     <p>Talla’s authoritative voice broke\
  \ the silence. “Let’s split up to cover more ground. Nifri, the gloves stay on this\
  \ time, please.”</p> \n     <p>“You got it, boss.,” Nifri nodded and disappeared\
  \ around a bend. Determined to master their own unease, Ariad followed Talla’s directions\
  \ without comment. They chose a room close to the entrance that housed rows of gyroscope-like\
  \ contraptions. Strangely, each device contained a seat designed to accommodate\
  \ a small creature. Ariad had only completed a cursory inspection of the machines\
  \ when their comm unit crackled to life.</p> \n     <p>“Ari, come take a look at\
  \ this.” Talla sounded calm, but she must have found something interesting. Talla\
  \ stood in front of a hexagonal column they hadn’t noticed before. Unfamiliar pictograms\
  \ studded its seamless obsidian metal surface, forming an incomprehensible cipher.\

  \ Pixoloid Studios.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>“At least this text is stationary.”\
  \ Ariad said. They scanned the symbols, cross-referencing their own internal database\
  \ of language and magical code. Unfortunately, their cybernetically- enhanced eidetic\
  \ memory proved no match for the strange writing. Talla waved a chemalyzer along\
  \ the length of the pillar. The device beeped and Talla’s eyestalks craned eagerly\
  \ toward the readout. The knitted thermal cap she wore to protect her delicate organs\
  \ bobbed comically as she shook her head in confusion.</p> \n     <p>“Strange, these\
  \ isotope levels look…pre-Gap?” Talla gave the device a solid tap to ensure it was\
  \ working properly. “Yeah, probably pre-Gap.” Talla sighed, clearly frustrated.\
  \ With hundreds of successful excavations under her belt, she was team leader for\
  \ good reason, and not used to being thwarted like this. “This writing isn’t in\
  \ any language I’m familiar with.”</p> \n     <p>“I don’t recognize it either,”\
  \ Ariad confessed. </p> \n     <p>“Too bad. I was hoping you could translate,” Talla\
  \ said in a muffled voice as she rummaged through her pack.</p> \n     <p>“Where’\
  s Nifri?” Ariad asked. Concern for their absent colleague suddenly gripped them.\
  \ Nifri was a competent, though inexperienced, professional. His earlier judgment\
  \ lapse was uncharacteristic, but what if he ran into more trouble? </p> \n    \
  \ <p>As if on cue, Nifri’s voice exploded from Talla’s comm unit. “Boss, I don’\
  t think we’re in a tomb. This room has cryo-storage and an operating theater. I\
  \ found some partial specimens that look like—no, that can’t be.” Nifri’s voice\
  \ trailed off, distracted by his latest discovery.</p> \n     <p>“Roger, Nifri,”\
  \ Talla responded. “Ari and I are finishing up here. Take samples while you wait\
  \ for us.” Ariad wondered how she could sound confident when they weren’t any closer\
  \ to unraveling the mystery of the ruins.</p> \n     <p>“We need an icebreaker,”\
  \ she declared, and produced a glob of iridescent putty from her pack. She attached\
  \ it to the pillar the way a child might stash a piece of gum beneath a desk for\
  \ safekeeping. It rolled slowly over the object, seeking concealed edges and mechanisms\
  \ invisible to the naked eye. Talla grinned when it settled and revealed the outline\
  \ of a control panel. </p> \n     <p>“What is that?” Ariad wondered. They gasped\
  \ when the panel popped out from the pillar as though activated by their voice.\
  \ At this angle, they realized it housed a keypad labeled with unfamiliar pictograms.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Let’s find out,” Talla flashed them a mischievous grin. She reached\
  \ toward the keypad, then jumped back as the panel immediately retracted. A loud\
  \ whirring sound filled the room and the column’s six faces began to rotate. The\
  \ object lowered, spinning, into the floor as its exterior surfaces unfurled, revealing\
  \ a central core of blue plasma. A hologram depicting an unknown species materialized\
  \ in the glow. The plasma flickered and warped, forming distorted images that hinted\
  \ at the creature’s anatomy. It stood atop four overlapping tentacles, its segmented\
  \ neck arching forward from the far side of its body like a striking serpent. Three\
  \ sets of clawed arms protruded from its ribbed belly. Its only discernable facial\
  \ features were two pairs of mismatched eyes that blazed with inscrutable intent.\
  \ Its mandibles twitched in synchronization with its vestigial front arms as it\
  \ vocalized. A roar of growls and glottal stops that Ariad’s linguistic processors\
  \ registered as noise filled the corridor. Suddenly, an arc of electricity shot\
  \ out from the panel. </p> \n     <p>“Watch out!” Ariad screamed, shoving Talla\
  \ out of the way. The bolt surged and struck the floor where she had just been standing.\
  \ Residual static pulsed through the android’s synthetic skin as they stared at\
  \ the charred spot left behind. </p> \n     <p>“Thank you,” Talla gasped. “I thought—\
  ” A howling klaxon from the ruined complex’s core interrupted her. This warning\
  \ needed no translation, and the two researchers fled toward the entrance. A magnified\
  \ voice boomed overhead as they ran, speaking the holographic creature’s dissonant\
  \ language. A series of crashes chased them down the hall as shutters lowered over\
  \ doorways they’d planned to investigate. A metal slab slammed down in front of\
  \ them, blocking the exit.</p> \n     <p>“Over here!” Nifri called from behind them.\
  \ He stepped into the hallway and waved his team toward an accessible room. Ariad\
  \ and Talla sprinted through the doorway seconds before it sealed itself shut.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I think we’re safe in here,” Nifri said. Ariad wasn’t so sure. Their\
  \ refuge was a control room crowded with dusty consoles and machinery. A hundred\
  \ orange eyes blinked awake as the ancient equipment rumbled and whined, booting\
  \ up for the first time in millennia. </p> \n     <p>“I can’t find a signal in here.”\
  \ Talla paced while frantically typing into her comm unit, but her companions’ attention\
  \ snapped back to the room’s central console. A holoprojection of a planet floated\
  \ above it. A beacon at the center of the topographical map radiated veins reaching\
  \ across its mountains and valleys. The two watched in horror as the tendrils elongated\
  \ and writhed out from the beacon, infesting the planet’s surface. Ariad recognized\
  \ the planet. It was Jedarat.</p> \n     <p>“What have we done?” Nifri gasped.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I have a signal!” Talla exclaimed. “Talla to HQ. We’re trapped. Do\
  \ you copy?” Only a burst of static answered her.</p> \n     <p>“Keep trying,” Ariad\
  \ urged. There were hundreds of workers on Jedarat’s surface. Ariad’s team was trapped,\
  \ but they had to warn the others. </p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\"\

  \ a shroud of snow concealed the world, obscuring a picturesque view of the alpine\
  \ landscape. The storm had appeared out of nowhere, right when all the terraforming\
  \ equipment in the valley went haywire.</p> \n     <p>Eisyfina’s datapad pinged\
  \ with an incoming message, a video file from the xenoarchaeology team contracted\
  \ to explore Jedarat’s ruins. She watched silently, transfixed by the video’s disturbing\
  \ contents. She shut it off with a decisive tap of her finger, but the message’\
  s final words echoed in her mind: we woke it up.</p> \n     <p>“This is Nott requesting\
  \ immediate support to New Horizons headquarters.” She barked into her earpiece.\
  \ “We need help. Now.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\
