  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>One interesting\
  \ line of thought that I have yet to formally consider goes beyond the question\
  \ of whether these “prophecies” should be considered equally as a whole to whether\
  \ the whole of each of them should be equally considered. If, for example, I dismiss\
  \ the effects of a particular god’s supposed death, does this mean that I am dismissing\
  \ their prophesied death altogether? Does every part of a prophecy have to come\
  \ true for it to be considered prophetic? If the vast majority proves true, what\
  \ is wrong could be an error of translation, interpretation, or prophetic understanding.\
  \ On the other hand, if most of a prophecy is false, what is accurate is likely\
  \ a lucky guess. The Windsong Corollaries never reach this sort of sentence-level\
  \ consideration (a gap that I might perhaps publish a small paper in when my Lady\
  \ does not need me, so long as I keep things strictly theoretical). I expect a reading\
  \ of</em> Beyond Aroden: Failed Foretelling in the Age of Prophecy <em>is in short\
  \ order to establish a bit of a baseline, but it will be up to my Lady (with my\
  \ assistance, I hope!) to determine what level of possibility and accuracy any of\
  \ these must have to be fully considered a work of prophecy.</em></p>\n      <p><em>–\

  \ Death of Erastil</h2>\n      <p>Erastil runs. Gallops really. Hoof over hoof,\
  \ his antlers gleaming, bounding over shallow stream and whirling under tree branch,\
  \ his body flying forward in a streak of joyous motion. He cannot always be the\
  \ stag, but there are times he needs to run and feel the wind across his legs, familiar\
  \ as the dawn but as new as any sunrise. He runs until he’s just past tired and\
  \ ready for a drink of water, shaking leaves from antlers in a spray of autumn colors\
  \ and transforming back into the form his followers are used to—horned head and\
  \ wiry body of an age-old master hunter.</p>\n      <p>But he is not the only age-old\
  \ creature resting in this wood. <em>Something </em>emerges, slowly, from a refuge\
  \ it has tired of, assorted sharp and fleshy parts dragging its pouch of hunger\
  \ up from somewhere down below. Even Erastil’s well-trained eyes do not quite see\
  \ it slowly crawling, clawing onto haunch and belly, drawing closer to the god and\
  \ waiting for the perfect moment. Not until the instant that it rises up to strike.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Erastil runs. Scrambles really. Step after step, bow at the ready, preparing\
  \ even as he flees, trampling through a clutch of bushes, plunging through the river’\
  s cold, trying to stay ahead until he whirls around to face what hunts him, show\
  \ it that he’s unafraid. But there are things that even Old Deadeye has no defense\
  \ against. And when that something catches him, its jaw wide and devouring, it turns\
  \ what once was hunting god to nothing more than helpless prey, only stopping its\
  \ ravaging to marvel at the flavor. There’s something here it’s never savored, in\
  \ between the crunch and squelch—divinely filling in a way that it has never known\
  \ before and now can never be without. Once it has consumed its meal and all that’\
  s left is bits of bone, it scents the air and twists its body, reveling in the aftertaste\
  \ of something past mortality, and lurches through the undergrowth to find another\
  \ morsel.</p>\n      <p>Followers of Erastil who felt his blessings fade track his\
  \ remaining footprints to the place he fought and fell. (There’s luck in that, or\
  \ Jaidi’s hand, steady despite a widow’s grief, putting firm hands against their\
  \ backs until they find whatever place his hint of dust remains.) A hunt is called,\
  \ a holy ride, in honor of the fallen god, to track and take whatever beast has\
  \ left their altars bare. But all they find across their path are other grieving\
  \ worshippers whose gods (most small in name and reach, their purpose only known\
  \ by handfuls) now are merely carcasses, devoured by some wretched beast that no\
  \ one ever glimpses. The Hunters offer shelter and a purpose to these wanderers,\
  \ and some find comfort in the endless chase across the Great Beyond, even as they\
  \ never seem to find the subject of their search. Whatever killed Erastil, whatever\
  \ hunts the other gods, is always hidden from their view, is always one quick turn\
  \ away, is always adding to the trail of carnage just ahead.</p>\n      <p>The gods\
  \ take notice of the beast, each readying their own defense. Some draw together,\
  \ forming pacts and promising to shield each other—the radiance of the Dawnflower\
  \ reaches the realm of the Midnight Lord, Norgorber and Iomedae draw swords with\
  \ Cayden Cailean, the half-abandoned Summerlands fill up with frightened deities—\
  but others use the moment as the perfect time to strike. Gorum turns on the cowardly\
  \ and sharpens blades against their backs, Asmodeus carves clauses into those he\
  \ has a contract with, Calistria builds safety from the ashes of revenge. Pantheons\
  \ rise and fall and splinter in the shadow of the beast, endlessly repositioning\
  \ even when it has gone to ground, its hunger sated only briefly every new time\
  \ that it feeds.</p>\n      <p>Among the mortals, fear takes root as one god or\
  \ another falls, and those who live are sometimes absent, too caught up in safety\
  \ to give followers their strength. Some flourish in these absences that gods might\
  \ once have kept in check, selling hope or cruelty as counters to divinity, creating\
  \ order from the chaos any way they can. And when the gods grow used to fear and\
  \ venture back into the world (beast still lurking in the corners, drooling at the\
  \ prey), some find their temples turned to rubble, dusty from years of disuse, or\
  \ built over to some new purpose they can barely recognize, and must now find a\
  \ new path in a half-godless Golarion, even as something in the shadows starts to\
  \ hunt</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6d8751cd-9a80-43d0-8a05-c9789eb4186b/EvolvingProhecyImage_Wk5_1300x2000.jpg\"\

  \      </center>\n      <p><em>Much as I found it distasteful to read about, I wish\
  \ this supposed prophecy had gone into greater detail about this “beast” with what\
  \ I suppose is a taste for divine flesh (a prospect I can barely conceive of, let\
  \ alone comment on!). While I did attempt to use my rudimentary artistic talents\
  \ to create some sort of sketch, even my best guess at the appearance of this beast\
  \ has fallen quite short, as it matches nothing I am currently aware of. Either\
  \ my skills are not up to the task, the prophecy has purposefully been vague, or\
  \ this beast has never been seen before. If the latter, this is yet another reason\
  \ to doubt this prophecy in particular. Anything this powerful would surely be noted\
  \ in someone’s annals. Beyond that, though, the breakdown of the gods noted here\
  \ seems very unlikely. In both my studies and experiences of the gods, I have found\
  \ them to be quite devoted to those who worship them (each in their own way, of\
  \ course), even when to their own detriment. No matter how horrible the threat,\
  \ I do not believe mortals would be abandoned in this way, nor that they would abandon\
  \ their gods in return. Or, at least, I do not wish to believe it. Best, I think,\
  \ to move on to some new, and hopefully less troubling, prophecy.</em></p>\n   \
