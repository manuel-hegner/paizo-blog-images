  \ a deeper truth: that just as a sword must bend to avoid breaking, so too must\
  \ honor. And the more rigid the steel, the easier it shatters. </p> \n    <div>\

  \     </table>\n    </div> \n    <p>Hayato was born a retainer on the estate of\
  \ Lord Nakayama Hitoshi, just a few days' ride from the great city of Oda in Minkai.\
  \ The son of the chief falconer and his wife, Hayato—whose name means \"falcon\"\
  —quickly proved just as proficient with the dangerous birds as his father, emulating\
  \ their proud and fierce natures. </p> \n    <p>It was while accompanying his father\
  \ on one of Lord Nakayama's hawking outings that he first came to the lord's attention.\
  \ At eight years old, Hayato was assigned the honor of being the personal attendant\
  \ to the lord's son, Masao, assisting the privileged child with his falcon. All\
  \ went well until the noble son, still new to the sport, mishandled his bird and\
  \ nearly lost an eye for his trouble. The furious lordling prepared to kill the\
  \ falcon then and there, but Hayato interceded, explaining the boy's error. Enraged\
  \ even further, Masao began beating Hayato, drawing the attention of the rest of\
  \ the hunting party. Though Hayato bowed low and accepted the savage blows of his\
  \ master, he neither cried out nor begged for mercy. When Masao finally tired, Lord\
  \ Nakayama himself addressed the bloody servant child, asking him why he had been\
  \ so bold as to correct his superior. Without faltering, Hayato bowed to the lord\
  \ and said simply, \"Because it was the truth.\" </p> \n    <p>From that point on,\
  \ Lord Nakayama took the young Hayato under his wing, frequently assigning him duties\
  \ within the manor house, engaging him as a companion for his son, and seeing to\
  \ his education in matters both martial and intellectual. In time, Hayato grew to\
  \ become a powerful warrior, rising to the position of head samurai of the Nakayama\
  \ holdings. When Masao died in a drunken duel at the age of twenty, thus depriving\
  \ Lord Nakayama of an official heir, the bereaved lord began to look more and more\
  \ to Hayato as a son, even allowing him to take the family name.</p> \n    <p>Yet\
  \ Masao's death was only the beginning of the Nakayama family's misfortune. It was\
  \ shortly after this episode that the Nakayama estate was visited by Kaneka Yoshiro,\
  \ a traveling lord and government official with a position high in the Imperial\
  \ Court. With considerably more prestige and official sway than Nakayama, Kaneka\
  \ was received with full honors—yet it quickly became apparent that the guest was\
  \ interested in more than just hospitality. Within a few days, Kaneka's cunning\
  \ insults, lewd advances toward Nakayama's wife, and barely concealed challenges\
  \ to Nakayama himself left Hayato's lord with no choice. Honor forbade him from\
  \ allowing the slights to stand unanswered, yet challenging a governmental superior\
  \ was as good as a death sentence. </p> \n    <p>In the end, honor won out, just\
  \ as Kaneka knew it would. Nakayama challenged Kaneka to a duel, and was quickly\
  \ slain by the talented swordsman. In recompense for the \"insult\" Kaneka had suffered,\
  \ the Imperial Court allotted all the Nakayama holdings to Kaneka. Nakayama's widow,\
  \ faced with the prospect of a dishonored existence among peasants, had no choice\
  \ but to accept Kaneka's proposal of marriage if she wanted to retain her position.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Though the Nakayama samurai were bound by direct order of the court\
  \ to honor their new arrangement—and plied with substantial gifts by their new master—\
  Hayato saw the theft for what it was. Several nights later, having watched Kaneka's\
  \ celebrating guards drink themselves into unconsciousness, Hayato crept into his\
  \ former master's bedchamber and confronted the usurper even as he lay sleeping\
  \ with his new wife. Though Kaneka screamed for his retainers, in the end it became\
  \ clear that his only option was to fight. Taking up the sword that Hayato tossed\
  \ onto the bed, Kaneka did everything he could to kill the samurai quickly, yet\
  \ Hayato would not be denied his revenge. At last, bleeding from several terrible\
  \ wounds, Hayato succeeded in getting past the noble's guard, ending his short-lived\
  \ dominion over the Nakayama estate in a fine spray of blood. </p> \n    <p>As Kaneka\
  \ fell to the floor, pink froth spilling from his lips, Hayato dropped his sword\
  \ and knelt beside it. Knowing that to attack any lord in this manner—let alone\
  \ the man the government considered his rightful master—would bring sure execution,\
  \ he drew his tanto and prepared to die with his honor intact. </p> \n    <p>A hand\
  \ on his shoulder stayed his blade. When Hayato looked up, he beheld Lady Nakayama—\
  now Lady Kaneka—in her dressing gown, its yellow silk stained with the blood of\
  \ her most recent husband. With tears in her eyes, she thanked Hayato for avenging\
  \ Lord Nakayama and returning the estate to her control. Yet with her next breath,\
  \ she condemned him forever. Taking his hand in her own—an undreamed-of show of\
  \ affection and familiarity—the noblewoman forbade Hayato from taking his own life.\
  \ Instead, she snuck him out of the manor and into a carriage bound for Oda, with\
  \ only a string of coins, his armor, and a command to live as best he could. When\
  \ the morning sun rose, it found Hayato on a caravan traveling north, bound for\
  \ the icy reaches of the Crown of the World and from there on to the mysterious\
  \ lands of the Inner Sea. </p> \n    <p>Now in his mid-thirties, Hayato is a hard\
  \ man who keeps to himself. Though he has long since learned to speak Taldane, he\
  \ remains terse by nature, feeling that everyone in his new home speaks too much\
  \ but says too little. He operates as a fearless and talented mercenary—or ronin,\
  \ as he terms it—for those whose cause seem righteous, yet refuses to bow to anyone\
  \ regardless of status, saying only that he has had his fill of masters. Hayato\
  \ is loyal to those few friends who can get past his stone-faced demeanor, yet remains\
  \ secretly tortured by his conflicting senses of honor. To continue living as a\
  \ masterless samurai—let alone one who has committed a great crime—is shameful,\
  \ yet to deny Lady Nakayama's command would be equally shameful. With no clear answer,\
  \ Hayato has temporarily shelved the problem. Yet deep in his heart, he harbors\
  \ a secret hope: that perhaps one day he might raise an army of champions and take\
  \ it back over the Crown of the World, rooting out the corrupt politicians of his\
  \ homeland and restoring the honor of himself, his adopted family, and the samurai\
  \ code he was born to uphold.</p> \n    <p>James Sutter <br>Fiction Editor</p> \n\
