  \ itemprop=\"description\">We closed the official Pathfinder Playtest in December\
  \ and are well on the way to finalizing the final manuscript for the Core Rulebook.\
  \ Now that we are close to locking and loading what Pathfinder version two looks\
  \ like, the organized play team is revisiting our surveys from this fall and using\
  \ them to finalize decisions as to what the new version of Pathfinder Society looks\
  \ like.</p> \n    <p><br> Some community members requested information on the replay\
  \ rate for Pathfinder Society version 1 and release rate of version 2, among other\
  \ topics. We aren't ignoring those questions, but before we can answer those, we\
  \ needed to formulate a plan for Season 10. Good news is we have a title and basic\
  \ outline for where the story is going. Bad news, we won't release any news on the\
  \ upcoming Pathfinder Society storyline until the PaizoCon banquet the end of May.\
  \ If you want to be there to hear it first, be sure to get your <a href=\"/paizocon#badges\"\
  >PaizoCon badge and banquet ticket.</a>.</p> \n    <p>One of the topics of discussion\
  \ during the planning meetings was the use of Year and Season. We tend to call them\
  \ \"Year of the X\" but refer to them numerically as \"Season X\". For example,\
  \ last year was both \"Year of Faction's Favor\" and \"Season 9\". This has the\
  \ potential for confusion and so we are moving to use Year exclusively. This change\
  \ starts with the release of the new Starfinder Society storyline at Origins, though\
  \ you won't have to wait to June for spoilers. More information about the upcoming\
  \ Starfinder Society Year of the ?? coming your way via blog in a few weeks!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>To keep you updated, here's a list of a few of the topics we are focused\
  \ on answering in the next few months. While not comprehensive, it hits the top\
  \ tier of discussion material for the team.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Playtest Point\
  \ Rewards</li> \n     <li>Faction Names and Symbols</li> \n     <li>Guide Structure\
  \ - including the requested Quick Start Guide</li> \n     <li>Additional Resources,\
  \ Campaign Clarifications, and FAQs</li> \n     <li>Sanctioning of other Paizo adventures</li>\
  \ \n     <li>How we sanction adventures</li> \n     <li>Pregenerated Characters</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Support Programs - Retail, Regional, Charity, and Event.</li> \n  \
  \   <li>Campaign Documentation - Chronicles, Information Tracking Sheets, and Character\
  \ Sheets</li> \n     <li>Game Reporting Methods</li> \n     <li>Replay for Seasons\
  \ 0-10 of Pathfinder Society</li> \n     <li>Five (nova/glyph) requirements and\
  \ implementation</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>As a reminder, while the Playtest using\
  \ Doomsday Dawn is over, Pathfinder Society players may still accumulate Playtest\
  \ Points using the four Playtest Scenarios—<i><a href=\"/products/btpya1y3?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-1-The-Rose-Street-Revenge\"\

  \ still to be determined.</p> \n    <p>So, until next week, stay warm and remember\
