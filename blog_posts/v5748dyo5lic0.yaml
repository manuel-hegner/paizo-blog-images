  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">2015 has been a good year for <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> adventures. We set some ambitious goals,\
  \ including doubling the number of interactive special events and providing several\
  \ new exclusive scenarios that let players portray <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"\
  >Aspis Consortium agents</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu6\">the kobolds that\
  \ live below Absalom</a>—far more ways for aspiring 5-star GMs to run their 10 special\
  \ adventures. We reassembled the powerful Sky Key and <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu7\"\
  >activated it to see what would happen</a>. We have since struck back against the\
  \ Aspis Consortium for its unprovoked (okay, only somewhat provoked) attack on the\
  \ Grand Lodge in this first half of the Year of the Serpent, and there's more excitement\
  \ to come in 2016.</p> \n     <p>It's also been a great year for new talent, whether\
  \ that's the four new authors I learned about through the Open Call program or the\
  \ 21 other authors (both familiar and new) whose names have appeared on the 31 adventures\
  \ we've published over the past twelve months. Perhaps most significantly of all,\
  \ Linda Zayas-Palmer joined the development team, greatly helping us not only give\
  \ each scenario the development time that it deserves but also providing us additional\
  \ time to plan out the rest of Season 7 and Season 8.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \   <br><i>Illustration by Dion Harris</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>That's not to\
  \ say that we've accomplished quite everything that we had hoped. There are still\
  \ some sanctioning projects on the back burner, but I look forward to the long flights\
  \ to and from seeing family to catch up on my <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\">Pathfinder\
  \ Tales</a> reading list. I've also packed the last few volumes of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods\">Iron Gods Adventure Path</a> to work on those\
  \ Chronicle sheets.</p> \n     <p>So let's look at what's coming out right before\
  \ your New Year's celebrations—both of which take us to uncharted territory. In\
  \ fact, despite neither one being terribly Christmas-y at first glance, both of\
  \ them promote the virtue of helping someone in need.</p> \n     <p>In <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9hgz\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-12: The Twisted Circle</em></a>\
  \ by Jon Cazares, the Pathfinders set out from Katapesh in order to investigate\
  \ the disappearance of an Osiriani researcher who has spent the last several years\
  \ studying the Mana Wastes. The trail leads to a tight-knit community south of Alkenstar,\
  \ where the proud villagers endure and thrive despite the bizarre magical events\
  \ that sweep through the area. I'm really looking forward to stories about this\
  \ Tier 1-5 scenario, as it really lends itself well to building atmosphere, fun\
  \ dialogue, and uncovering one of the spell-scarred region's secrets.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>We can also look forward to <a href=\"/products/btpy9hh0\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-13: Captive in Crystal</em></a> by Monica Marlowe (RPG Superstar\
  \ 2015). In this Tier 5-9 adventure, the Society needs a team to track down whatever\
  \ remains of five Pathfinders who disappeared years ago while using a strange <em>wayfinder</em>.\
  \ Chief among those missing in action was Sorrina Westyr, the Society's former Master\
  \ of Spells until a decade ago, when Aram Zey filled the vacancy. I've wondered\
  \ for a long time who preceded the current three Masters of Scrolls, Spells, and\
  \ Swords, and I had an opportunity to explore one of them while writing an entry\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy99sa\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Treasures</em></a>.\
  \ Now at last we get to follow up on that loose thread and learn what befell Sorrina\
  \ Westyr and her team. I'll give you one hint in the form of an art preview: an\
  \ imposing shaitan genie with the kind of muscles that cause Seltyiel to weep with\
  \ envy and drive Sajan to make a new year's resolution to do more crunches. If you\
  \ want your Pathfinder Society character to look this cool, take heart! This scenario\
  \ also revisits one of the boons I've received the most questions about in the past\
  \ year, and as a special gift to you, you don't need to have it on the same character\
  \ who plays this adventure.</p> \n     <p>I'd love to share more of the art, but\
  \ there's some major spoiler material among them; I want to give folks a month or\
  \ so to play through the adventures before I add it to a blog. After all, 'tis the\
  \ season for avoiding spoilers, thanks to the new Star Wars movie's release. As\
  \ of writing this blog, I still haven't seen it, but no doubt that will have changed\
  \ by the time this goes live.</p> \n     <p>May your 2015 conclude peacefully, safely,\
  \ and with some great gaming memories!</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
