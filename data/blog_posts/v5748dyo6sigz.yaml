  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Season’s greetings, Pathfinders\
  \ and Starfinders! It’s December, which puts us right in the middle of a whole host\
  \ of holidays and celebrations. We’ve reached out to our staff and contributors\
  \ to ask about their favorite traditions for the winter (or, in the case of our\
  \ southern hemisphere friends, summer) holidays!</p>\n      <br>\n      <center>\n\
  \       <hr width=\"70%\">\n      </center>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Hello! I’m Eren (they/them, primarily), and you’ll see some of my work\
  \ in the upcoming Lost Omens Tian Xia books for Pathfinder Second Edition. My family\
  \ didn’t have too many winter traditions growing up (I got presents on Christmas\
  \ for the first ten years of my life and tteokguk (rice cake soup) on New Year’\
  s after that), but since I started living on my own, I adapted some traditional\
  \ dongji rituals to celebrate the solstice. For me, this means making patjuk (red\
  \ bean porridge) and leaving a small bowl of it on my windowsill overnight for any\
  \ wandering spirits. I’m fond of winter, cold snaps and polar vortexes and all,\
  \ and it’s a calming ritual to look forward to in my generally fast-paced life.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>James Jacobs (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>I’m James Jacobs (he/him),\
  \ Narrative Creative Director for Pathfinder, and for me, the winter holidays are\
  \ traditionally when I wander some 800 miles south to spend time with my family\
  \ and to relax in my hometown of Sandpoint/Otari/Point Arena. There were a few years\
  \ there during the pandemic when this tradition got interrupted, but things are\
  \ mostly back to normal there. Bad weather might step in to keep me here in Washington\
  \ (as it has a few times in the past), but otherwise the long journey south beckons\
  \ with its promises of hanging out with family, relaxing in the redwoods of Northern\
  \ California, visiting some local landmarks (during Thanksgiving I visited the Point\
  \ Arena Lighthouse, which is the tallest lighthouse on the west coast of the United\
  \ States, and which you’ve also seen if you watched movies like <em>Forever Young</em>\
  \ or <em>Need for Speed</em>), and hoping for a bigfoot sighting or two.</p>\n \

  \ Birdsong (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>Hi everyone, I’m Joshua Birdsong. I am a designer\
  \ for Paizo. I am very excited and humbled to be part of such an amazing team, and\
  \ I look forward to helping create some awesome books for all of you! My favorite\
  \ holiday tradition is consuming an entire container of chocolate hazelnut pirouline\
  \ wafers on Christmas day! If you need to get in touch, you can find me on Twitter\
  \ at @impr0phet. Don’t forget to be awesome!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Lynne M.\
  \ Meyer (she/they)</h3>\n      <p>Hello! I’m Lynne (she/they), the newest member\
  \ of Paizo’s editing team. I’m pagan but grew up in a Protestant family. My holidays\
  \ aren’t complete without pfeffernusse, a traditional German spice cookie. When\
  \ I was growing up, my German grandmother lived with us and taught me to bake. She\
  \ had pfeffernusse every Christmas—and only at Christmas. I looked forward to it\
  \ every year.</p>\n      <p>When she passed, the tradition stopped. Years later,\
  \ when I started dating the man who’d become my husband, I decided to bring it back.\
  \ I even used my grandmother’s antique measuring cups.</p>\n      <p>It turned out\
  \ that pfeffernusse is his favorite cookie! Pfeffernusse became my signature bake.\
  \ Pre-pandemic, I’d make as many as ten dozen to share with our families. Times\
  \ are different now, and those celebrations are happy memories. Circumstances make\
  \ it difficult to see our families in person, and I’ve since lost my father as well\
  \ as a brother.</p>\n      <p>Yet pfeffernusse remains part of my Yule. It’s the\
  \ one holiday tradition I keep without fail. It ties me to my past and my present\
  \ with love. Every year, when the aroma of anise hits me, I’m a little girl again,\
  \ celebrating Christmas with my family.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Growing up and living in a very mixed-culture household means I celebrate\
  \ a wide variety of holidays during December (Christmas Eve with my in-laws, Chanukah,\
  \ the Solstice, and “Witch-mas” with my mom—Christmas day, but it’s goth and we\
  \ make hot chocolate and exchange gifts). One tradition that transcends all of these\
  \ holidays, though, is making fudge!</p>\n      <p>I use my grandmother’s fudge\
  \ recipe (included below), which has been handwritten, photocopied several times,\
  \ and taken a picture of via a phone to wind up in my hands. It makes 5 pounds of\
  \ fudge—no more, no less, and no ratio editing allowed. And now you can make it\
  \ too!</p>\n      <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>\n      <ul>\n       <li>4\
  \ ½ cups of white sugar</li>\n       <li>2 cubes (8 oz) of butter</li>\n       <li>1\
  \ (12 oz) can of evaporated milk</li>\n       <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n \
  \      <li>18 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips (or semi-sweet chocolate, chopped)</li>\n\
  \       <li>1 (7 oz) jar of marshmallow fluff</li>\n       <li>2 cups chopped nuts\
  \ (optional)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>\n      <ol>\n\
  \       <li>Cook the sugar, butter, evaporated milk, and vanilla over medium heat\
  \ until the mixture comes to a slow boil.</li>\n       <li>Beat with electric mixture\
  \ for seven (7) minutes, continuously. \n        <ol>\n         <li>My wife and\
  \ I take turns holding the mixer for this step, as it can start to ache.</li>\n\
  \        </ol></li>\n       <li>Remove from heat.</li>\n       <li>Add in chocolate\
  \ chips, marshmallow fluff, and nuts (optional).</li>\n       <li>Stir until all\
  \ ingredients are well mixed.</li>\n       <li>Pour into 13” x 9” baking pan and\
  \ chill in fridge until set (about 2 hours). \n        <ol>\n         <li>If you’\
  re like me and want to eat hot, kind of un-set fudge, half an hour on the counter\
  \ is enough to make it cool enough to eat, but still warm and soft.</li>\n     \
  \   </ol></li>\n       <li>Cut into cubes and enjoy.</li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>(Makes\
  \ five pounds)</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e8333951-2b5f-4ea2-883d-be2b6d3cec5d/2023Fudge_Recipe.jpg\"\

  \ Some card and board games are often played as well. On Christmas and New Year's\
  \ Eve I meet with my family, and many others from my father's family, and get some\
  \ asado (fantastically grilled meat from here). After midnight, once presents are\
  \ opened, or exchanged, or a toast is made if it's New Year's Eve, it's time to\
  \ meet with friends, where we spend the rest of the night playing games, might get\
  \ a holiday-themed one-shot going, and go see the sunrise together when it comes.</p>\n\
