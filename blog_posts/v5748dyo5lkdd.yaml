  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The approaching solstice marks\
  \ the point at which the Paizo office starts to look a little emptier for a few\
  \ weeks. Just because a bunch of folks are taking some time off, though, doesn't\
  \ signal any break in scenario production. We have two new scenarios coming out\
  \ tomorrow, December 20th. Consider the early release our holiday gift to you!</p>\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>If you're looking for a frigid adventure to commemorate\
  \ a northern hemisphere's winter, look no further than <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0v?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-911-The-Jarlsblood-Witch-Saga\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-11: The Jarlsblood Witch Saga</em></a> by Nathan\
  \ King. This Tier 5-9 adventure returns us to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, where\
  \ it's the PCs' job to dissect—and possibly debunk—a centuries-old legend of a local\
  \ bogeyman. The truth carries the PCs to a dying town and into the desolate taiga,\
  \ and what the PCs find could change the fate of another nation thousands of miles\
  \ away.</p> \n    <p>I'm pleased with how this adventure turned out. First, this\
  \ continues the ongoing Sovereign Court faction's storyline in Season 9, and although\
  \ <em>The Jarlsblood Witch Saga</em> is not a true sequel to <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-908-Birthright-Betrayed\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-08: Birthright Betrayed</em></a>, they both\
  \ play key roles in setting up Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-13: The Lion's Justice\
  \ (Tier 7-11) that's coming out in January. Second, I'm pleased to note that this\
  \ scenario includes access to some fun gear from <a href=\"/products/btpy9tom?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Adventurers-Armory-2\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory 2</em></a>. Third, this scenario\
  \ involves a major Lands of the Linnorm Kings adventure trope that I've wanted to\
  \ see in print for a long, long time.</p> \n    <p>Finally, this scenario introduces\
  \ our newest venture-captain, Bjersig Torrsen. It's bothered me for a while that\
  \ the Pathfinder Society's presence in northwest Avistan is limited to Sheila Heidmarch\
  \ in southern Varisia (and wherever her husband Canayven has wandered that week).\
  \ Linda and I have also been trying to expand our roster of non-human venture-captains,\
  \ and Bjersig brings the list of regularly featured half-orcs to two (the other\
  \ being the popular Calisro Benarry). What's more Bjersig has a canine pal named\
  \ Mahki (modeled off one of the Pets of Paizo, a handsome husky named Ajax) who\
  \ helps the very competent and unabashedly deaf venture-captain navigate the hearing\
  \ world.</p> \n    <p>And that's only half of December's new releases. Linda Zayas-Palmer,\
  \ the development lead, takes over from here.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The\
  \ Pathfinder Society may have struck a truce of sorts with the Aspis Consortium\
  \ in Season 7, but that doesn't mean that the Pathfinder Society will never again\
  \ be at odds with their old foes. The Aspis Consortium has recently launched a mysterious\
  \ mining operation in the Mwangi Expanse. Ever since this operation started, however,\
  \ locals have been connecting it to all manner of sinister incidents. However, the\
  \ Aspis Consortium's entrenched influence in the region makes opposing them a difficult\
  \ proposition. If the Society hopes to uncover the truth without destroying the\
  \ truce, they'll need allies.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0u?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-910-Signs-in-Senghor\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-10: Signs in Senghor</em></a>, a Tier 1-5 scenario\
  \ by Kris Leonard, the Pathfinder Society seeks allies in the city of Senghor, a\
  \ flourishing port that has long resisted Aspis influence. Fortunately for the Society,\
  \ the mining operation isn't the only suspicious business linked to the Consortium.\
  \ Hushed whispers on the streets of Senghor speak of Aspis agents lurking among\
  \ the ruins of the forbidden and accursed city of Boali, whose mere mention is taboo.\
  \ One brave group of Pathfinders is about to get a taste of the unknown perils that\
  \ lurk on its uncharted soil, and in the process discover what drew the Consortium\
  \ to its perilous shores in the first place.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><em>Signs\
  \ in Senghor</em> also kicks off the Exchange faction's pursuits in Season 9. They\
  \ may begin the season desiring stronger regional ties to Senghor and other cities\
  \ along western Garund, yet as we look ahead, the faction will see more opportunities\
  \ to wield its economic might less for personal enrichment but more to avert a disaster\
  \ and effect lasting change.</p> \n    <p>What's more, we have illustrated another\
  \ great venture-captain, Finze Bellaugh of Eledir, Sargava. I was delighted to see\
  \ Finze portrayed in Pathfinder Tales novels such as <a href=\"/products/btpy9n4n?Pathfinder-Tales-Through-the-Gate-in-the-Sea\"\
  ><em>Through the Gate in the Sea</em></a> by Howard Andrew Jones, and the venture-captain's\
  \ a consummate scholar who exudes curiosity and understanding. We're excited to\
  \ give him a proper introduction.</p> \n    <p>Have a lovely rest of December!</p>\
