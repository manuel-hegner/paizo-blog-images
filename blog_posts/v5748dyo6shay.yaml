  \      <p><em>A large crowd milled about the entryway to Skyreach. From all over\
  \ Golarion, would-be adventurers had traveled to the Grand Lodge and applied for\
  \ membership in the Pathfinder Society. Tengu feathers brushed against kobold scales\
  \ as members of Golarion’s varied peoples brushed shoulders, waiting for the Society’\
  s leadership to open the doors and announce who would receive the rank of initiate\
  \ to begin their training. Just as the crowd grew restless, with grumbling voices\
  \ tired of waiting filling the air, the doors opened and Janira Gavrix stepped out,\
  \ flanked by Ambrus Valsin and Drandle Dreng. She opened a scroll and began to read.</em></p>\n\
  \     </blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con Online </a>just two weeks away, the organized play team\
  \ remains focused on getting our last items out the door. The Gen Con organizing\
  \ committee has also just finished meeting to put polish on the final pieces. And\
  \ while we won’t be building out the Sagamore Ballroom this year, our offerings\
  \ are no less impressive—the Gen Con catalog includes approximately 900 events in\
  \ six languages. We’ve got one-hour Quests and Bounties, two-hour Adventure Card\
  \ Society scenarios, and five-hour Scenarios for both Pathfinder Society and Starfinder\
  \ Society, not to mention more events soon to come: panels featuring Paizo staffers\
  \ talking about some upcoming products, answering fan questions, and giving a peek\
  \ into the life of a Paizo staffer. We’ll post a full panel schedule as well as\
  \ other information to our website shortly.</p> \n     <p>But we have even more\
  \ goodies for you, our players, before we get to Gen Con. Last week, we revealed\
  \ that kobolds will be an always-available ancestry option for Pathfinder Society\
  \ players upon release of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide\"\
  >Advanced Players Guide</a>. Here and now, in advance of the book’s release, we’\
  re happy to reveal the sanctioning for the other character options available from\
  \ the APG—if you want to play that swashbuckler or witch at Gen Con, you’ll be able\
  \ to! Check out our ongoing <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3j?Pathfinder-Society-Character-Options\"\
  >Character Options blog</a> for these updates.</p> \n     <blockquote>\n      <p><em>Venture-Captain\
  \ Naiaj sighed as she swiped another set of documents off her datapad. “They were\
  \ supposed to be here weeks ago” she muttered, knowing her companion would hear\
  \ her over the din of the bustling spaceport.</em></p><em> <p>The vesk next to her\
  \ smirked. “Yes, yes, but these things take time, you know? Sometimes I think you\
  \ find things to worry about, just to make sure you don’t run out.” Radazsam knew\
  \ he could get away with needling the gnome; underneath her stern, monochromatic\
  \ exterior was a warm heart. Plus, he’d already seen his contact approaching through\
  \ the crowd.</p> <p>Before Naiaj could formulate a response, she spotted them as\
  \ well: a pale lavender vesk with the most elaborate set of facial bone spikes she’\
  d ever seen, followed by a green-furred skittermander. Despite all laws of physics,\
  \ the six-armed creature appeared to be hauling no less than 12 boxes of various\
  \ sizes. “Well,” Naiaj said as they approached, “it’s about time. Let’s see what\
  \ you’ve brought from the Veskarium, shall we?” </p></em>\n     </blockquote> \n\
  \     <p>Fear not, Starfinder Society players, we have things for you as well! How\
  \ about a fully sanctioned <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023hm?Starfinder-Starship-Operations-Manual\"\
  >Starship Operations Manual</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-Near-Space\"\
  >Near Space</a>? Note that the former, as a book focused on starships, doesn’t have\
  \ any options for your characters to take, but we’ve still included it in our sanctioning\
  \ for the sake of completeness. But in the latter, you’ll find many new items for\
  \ players to use in telling their characters’ stories, including alternate options\
  \ for vesk, skittermanders, and more; new weapons and fusions; and a few archetypes\
  \ and themes to flesh out your Starfinders.</p> \n     <p>But enough chatter. Time\
  \ to make more characters!</p> \n     <p>Until next week,</p> \n     <p>Explore,\
