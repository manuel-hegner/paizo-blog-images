  \ Reborn Forge includes an extensive gazetteer of the city of Alkenstar, which straddles\
  \ a 500-foot-tall waterfall that preludes an equally tall sheer cliff-side. While\
  \ there are certainly clockworks, guns, and other steampunk elements in the adventure\
  \ itself, it's in this gazetteer that the gloves come off as far as gears, goggles,\
  \ and guns go. The city of Alkenstar is divided into two distinct parts—Smokeside\
  \ and Skyside—naturally separated by the Ustradi River. The poorer and more dangerous\
  \ half of the city, Smokeside, is located in a permanent pocket of antimagic, where\
  \ spells both arcane and divine simply cease to function. Here, a tumble down the\
  \ stairs can be just as lethal as a bullet wound (though the latter is far more\
  \ likely), as magical healing is non-existent and unpracticed doctors are the only\
  \ way for many citizens to remedy deadly injuries or disease. Gangs and criminal\
  \ organizations operate out of soot-covered factories, ruling the streets beneath\
  \ a perpetual cloud of lung-burning smog. For all its hazards, however, this side\
  \ of the city is also one of the most highly sought out, since it's one of the few\
  \ places in the Inner Sea where one can reliably avoid magical detection via divination,\
  \ as scrying and other eldritch means of locating a person simply don't work among\
  \ the smokestacks and filth-ridden alleys of Smokeside.</p> \n    <p>The half of\
  \ the city on the eastern side of the Ustradi River is known as Skyside because\
  \ the towers here are among the few places in Alkenstar where one can penetrate\
  \ the blanket of smog and see the sky. The wide river itself is an area of unforgiving\
  \ primal magic, which washes down the Alken Falls as surely as it occasionally seeps\
  \ into the waters of Smokeside and Skyside from time to time. Only the wealthiest\
  \ and most established Alkenstarians may live in Skyside. Here, the Grand Duchy\
  \ holds sway, as do the myriad engineering guilds, metallurgic factories, Brigh-\
  \ and Abadar-worshiping temples, and universities of alchemy and primal magic. The\
  \ organizations and businesses of Skyside utilize the unpredictable fonts of magical\
  \ energy that course through the soil—arcane remnants of the ancient wars between\
  \ neighboring Geb and Nex—in order to drive their noxious industries ever forward\
  \ in the name of profit, progress, and power.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ by Daniel Warren\n    </div> \n    <p>The result of these two distinct sectors\
  \ is a dichotomy between the haves and have-nots—those who use haphazard magic in\
  \ their privileged daily lives and those who must subsist in a raw, unforgiving\
  \ world run by machinery and grit alone. Factor in the presence of clockwork automatons\
  \ constructed by Skyside's wealthiest engineering guilds and the burgeoning technology\
  \ of guns, and Alkenstar quickly proves to be one of the most fascinating, exotic,\
  \ and compelling cities in the Inner Sea region.</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
