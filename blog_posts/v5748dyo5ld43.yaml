  \ Retrospective—Year 0 (2002)</h1> \n   <h2>The Thrill of Starting Something New</h2>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, February 9, 2012</p> \n   <p>2012 marks Paizo’\
  s 10th anniversary. I plan to do monthly blogs for the rest of the year that relive\
  \ the highlights (and some of the lowlights) from our first ten years of business,\
  \ and then I’ll take a look into the future as the year comes to a close. There\
  \ will be side anecdotes and hopefully more than a few embarrassing pictures. And\
  \ at the end of it all, I hope our readers will have a better sense of where Paizo\
  \ has been—and where we’re going!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> The paizo.com home page in 2002.\n   </div> \n   <p>The\
  \ seeds of Paizo Publishing were planted in late 2000: I was working at Wizards\
  \ of the Coast as the Brand Manager for Star Wars when the seemingly annual Christmas\
  \ layoffs claimed me as their victim. As I was walking around the building saying\
  \ my goodbyes to a lot of good friends, I mentioned to a few of them that I thought\
  \ Hasbro might decide to divest themselves of parts of their business in the next\
  \ few years and, if that were to happen, they should feel free to give me a call.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>My partner Vic had recently departed his previous job as well, so 2001\
  \ was a year of relaxing for us; we traveled a bit and spent a lot of time building\
  \ up our Star Wars collection. But by the end of the year, the two of us were stir\
  \ crazy. So we were both relieved when, shortly before Christmas, Johnny Wilson,\
  \ Group Publisher for the Periodicals division at Wizards of the Coast, called me\
  \ to let me know that Wizards wanted to divest itself of its magazine business,\
  \ which at the time included <i>Dragon</i>, <i>Dungeon</i>, and <i>Star Wars Insider</i>\
  \ magazines, as well as the Official Star Wars Fan Club for Lucasfilm. I was a longtime\
  \ subscriber to <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>, so that was right up my alley,\
  \ and the thought of running the Star Wars Fan Club and publishing <i>Star Wars\
  \ Insider</i> excited both Vic and myself. Our own experience with magazines was\
  \ limited, but Johnny had been in magazines for ages, so we felt we had our bases\
  \ covered.</p> \n   <p>We met with Johnny in early 2002 to start planning the company.\
  \ Johnny taught us what he called the “three-legged stool” model of the magazine\
  \ business. Magazines needed income from three sources: subscriptions, newsstand\
  \ sales, and advertising. If you ever let one of those three “legs” suffer, the\
  \ whole would become unstable. (It took us a couple of years to figure out that\
  \ there was a major problem with this model, but that’s a topic for a future installment.)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>One of the earliest decisions we made was naming our new company. Johnny,\
  \ being a religious scholar, had the name “Paizo”—biblical Greek for “I play”—floating\
  \ around in his head for a number of years. It fit our gaming company nicely, and\
  \ we could get a trademark for it, so we settled on it quickly. Of course, if we\
  \ would have realized how easily it was going to be mispronounced over the years\
  \ (pay-zo, pi-at-zoe, paz-zo, even pee-zo) we might have changed our minds and settled\
  \ on something easier to pronounce.</p> \n   <p>We went over the financials Johnny\
  \ had, and it looked like a promising business. Over the next few months, we had\
  \ numerous meetings with Wizards and Lucasfilm, both of whom approved our plans,\
  \ so we were good to go! We set up Paizo Publishing as an LLC with three owners:\
  \ myself, Vic Wertz, and Johnny Wilson.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> Paizo's first office was on the far right of the ground\
  \ floor of this building in Bellevue.\n   </div> \n   <p>We had our first bit of\
  \ great luck when our real estate agent found us an office space that had been vacated\
  \ in a rush by another company—it was still fully furnished, including desks, chairs,\
  \ a photocopier, and even a postage machine. We paid the landlord $1 for all of\
  \ the equipment, a fantastic deal which kept getting better as we explored our new\
  \ digs—we found a $20 bill in one of the drawers, and there was over $100 in prepaid\
  \ postage in the postage machine! We’ve moved twice since then, and the postage\
  \ machine is long gone, but we still use the copier and a lot of the furniture—\
  it was the best dollar we’ve ever spent.</p> \n   <p>We took over the entire magazine\
  \ division from Wizards lock, stock, and barrel—all of the department’s employees\
  \ signed on with Paizo, and Wizards gave us a nice deal on their computers, office\
  \ supplies, printers, back issues, and pretty much anything else we could load into\
  \ our moving truck. We made a couple new hires to round out our administrative staff,\
  \ and we officially started operations on July 1, 2002.</p> \n   <p>Our initial\
  \ staff was as follows:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Administrative Team</b><br>\
  \ Lisa Stevens: CEO<br> Johnny Wilson: Publisher<br> Vic Wertz: Technical Director<br>\
  \ Mary Franklin: Director of Operations and Marketing<br> Wailam Wilson: Corporate\

  \ Pierce Watters: Circulation Director<br> Jefferson Dunlap: Prepress Supervisor<br>\

  \ Okumura): Art Director</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> Scott Ricker (now Okumura) looking up from his gig\
  \ art directing <i>Star Wars Insider</i>.\n   </div> \n   <p>We continued the production\
  \ schedule that Wizards had set up for the magazines, and finished the issues they\
  \ had in the pipeline as we worked on their followups. The first all-Paizo issue\
  \ of <i>Dragon</i> was #299, followed by the milestone 300th issue, which included\
  \ a special sealed-content section covering The Book of Vile Darkness. In all, we\
  \ produced four issues of <i>Dragon</i> that year.</p> \n   <p><i>Dungeon</i> was\
  \ bimonthly at the time and had two issues come out under Paizo’s watch in 2002.\
  \ Issue 95 also had a sealed-content section like its sister periodical. <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ garnered Paizo our first ENnie Award, for Best Aid/Accessory.</p> \n   <p>We did\
  \ quite a lot with <i>Star Wars Insider</i> and the Official Star Wars Fan Club\
  \ in 2002. We brought the Bantha Tracks fan section back to the magazine for the\
  \ first time since the late 1970s. It had also been a while since the Fan Club had\
  \ done a membership kit, and we put together a great one. It included the following:</p>\
  \ \n   <ul>\n    <li>Official Star Wars Fan Club Membership Card</li> \n    <li>Letter\
  \ to members from George Lucas</li> \n    <li>Exclusive 3-D fold-together mini-standee</li>\
  \ \n    <li>Three travel destination postcards from the galaxy far, far away</li>\
  \ \n    <li>Travel stickers from exotic Star Wars destinations</li> \n    <li>A\
  \ letter from myself as the President of the Official Star Wars Fan Club</li>\n\
  \   </ul> \n   <p>We also were able to procure the official <i>Attack of the Clones</i>\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy72uj\">IMAX posters</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy72uk?Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones-IMAX-Theatrical-Banner\"\
  >banners</a> to sell to Star Wars fans everywhere (heck, we still have them available\
  \ for sale today). We also managed to arrange a great subscriber premium, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy72um?LEGO-Star-Wars-MINI-TIE-Fighter\">a limited-edition LEGO TIE\
  \ Fighter Mini Building Set</a>.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"\

  \    <br> Our first Official Star Wars Fan Club membership kit, along with the <a\

  \ selling at the end of 2002 and our awesome <a href=\"/products/btpy72um?LEGO-Star-Wars-MINI-TIE-Fighter\"\
  >LEGO subscription premium</a> for <i>Star Wars Insider</i>.\n   </div> \n   <p>But\
  \ things weren’t all rosy. While Johnny knew everything about actually producing\
  \ magazines, it turns out that he had never been exposed to any of the financial\
  \ details. In particular, newsstand distribution terms were far more complicated\
  \ than we’d anticipated. It took us a while to find an accountant that could make\
  \ sense of the hideously complex reports we were getting, which thoroughly obfuscated\
  \ the answers to seemingly simple questions such as “how much do we get paid, and\
  \ when?” Once we negotiated our way though it all, we realized that the time it\
  \ took to get paid for a given issue was many months longer than Johnny expected,\
  \ and the distribution fees involved were also higher than we’d been led to believe.\
  \ That meant that we were going to have to stretch our startup capital much longer\
  \ than we’d intended.</p> \n   <p>Also, along with the Star Wars Fan Club, we had\
  \ inherited the phone number 1-800-TRUE-FAN, which was printed as part of a “join\
  \ the Fan Club” blurb on the back of every Star Wars product produced in the previous\
  \ few years. That seemed like good marketing, but it really meant that we were paying\
  \ a lot of money to answer calls from five-year-olds who wanted to talk to Luke\
  \ Skywalker, or from slightly more sophisticated nine-year-olds hoping to speak\
  \ with George Lucas. We dropped the 800 number as soon as we could reasonably phase\
  \ it out.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120209-Ennie.jpg\"\

  \ Ryan Dancey\n   </div> \n   <p>We had also continued using the out-of-house subscription\
  \ fulfillment service that Wizards had used for the magazines, and we soon learned\
  \ that their costs were much higher than we’d expected. They handled all customer\
  \ service related to subscriptions, and charged us based on each customer contact—\
  there was a fee for every letter, email, and phone call they received, and another\
  \ fee for every reply they made. We soon realized that meant they had no incentive\
  \ to solve problems quickly—in fact, they’d make more money if it took multiple\
  \ contacts to resolve an issue! It became clear that we’d save a lot of money—and\
  \ provide better service—if we could bring subscriptions and customer service in-house.\
  \ That became our first major goal for 2003.</p> \n   <p>We ended the year with\
  \ a multi-course holiday dinner for the employees at my favorite restaurant at the\
  \ time, Gene’s Ristorante in Renton. Chef Charles Maddrey created a feast for us,\
  \ and lots of wine and beer were served. Even though things weren’t working out\
  \ exactly as planned, we were hopeful and wanted to celebrate the founding of Paizo\
  \ and looked forward to what the new year would bring!</p> \n   <blockquote> \n\

  \ \n   <p>Lisa Stevens<br> <i>CEO</i></p> \n   <h2>The Paizo Company Logo</h2> \n\
  \   <p>Once we had settled on the name of the company, Johnny had Art Director Kyle\
  \ Hunter take a stab at some logos for the newly minted corporation. There were\
  \ two basic styles: one was a calligraphy letter pi fused with a smoke monster,\
  \ and the other was the same letter pi in the shape of the now familiar golem. Each\
  \ of these creatures was given varying sets of eyes to convey different moods. From\
  \ top left: Fangeye, Cyclops, Grin, Glare, Shades, Mongo, Spacey and Vigilant (the\
  \ logo we ended up choosing). With the design settled, Kyle then did a number of\
  \ different color treatments. We eventually went with the now-familiar “Paizo purple,”\
  \ although Kyle was angling for the rusty color you can see in the bottom sample\
  \ of his business card.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120209-Logo.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> Kyle Hunter’s first takes at a Paizo logo and designs\
  \ for the first Paizo business card (in a few different color schemes). We ended\
  \ up picking the business card design on the far right of the second row. \n   </div>\
  \ \n   <h2>Erik’s Memories of Year Zero</h2> \n   <p>The first half of 2002 was\
  \ a strange time to work at Wizards of the Coast. On one hand, the Hasbro purchase\
  \ was still recent, and the luster of big bonuses and watching friends with lots\
  \ of seniority get new cars and houses was still relatively fresh. On the other\
  \ hand, Wizards was busily streamlining their business to focus on “core competencies,”\
  \ and starting in 2000, lots of people lost their jobs in a series of layoffs.</p>\

  \    <br> Erik Mona and Kyle Hunter discover a haunt near their desks.\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>Despite individual successes at work, there was a strong undercurrent\
  \ of “I’m sure I’m going to be fired soon” that seemed that year to be even more\
  \ potent than it had been in the past couple of years. I had only recently been\
  \ transferred from the RPGA Network to the Periodicals Department, and the two magazines\
  \ I was shepherding at the time—Polyhedron and the Living Greyhawk Journal—had become\
  \ sections of <i>Dungeon</i> and <i>Dragon</i>, respectively. I was really enjoying\
  \ the challenge of integrating these sections, and was doing some of the most fun\
  \ creative editorial work of my career, but it soon became clear that magazines\
  \ were not a safe place to work when the company was paring its focus to just its\
  \ core game business.</p> \n   <p>About this time, our Group Publisher, Johnny Wilson,\
  \ began whispering about his plan to save everyone’s jobs and ensure that the venerable\
  \ magazines of <i>Dungeon</i>s &amp; <i>Dragon</i>s would continue indefinitely.\
  \ He had found some investors interested in taking over the magazine business in\
  \ the likely event that Wizards cut it off, and in his impish way he named the effort\
  \ “La Cosa Nostra,” or “our thing.” Yes, that’s also the name of the Mafia, but\
  \ Johnny has an evil sense of humor for a guy as religious as he is, and he’d rub\
  \ his hands together while talking about his diabolical plan. Coming from between\
  \ his rosy cherub cheeks, his words filled us all with hope at a time when it was\
  \ in extremely limited supply around the office.</p> \n   <p>I was much relieved\
  \ to learn that Johnny’s mystery investors turned out to be Lisa Stevens and Vic\
  \ Wertz, two of my earliest Seattle friends. Lisa gave me my first real break in\
  \ the industry as a continuity consultant for the Greyhawk products she was managing\
  \ in the late 1990s, and I knew that she and Vic knew enough about business and\
  \ were the kind of game-loving advocates that it would take to make a project like\
  \ this work.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120209-ErikAndChris.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120209-ErikAndChris_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    <br> Chris Thomasson (now Youngs) and Erik Mona at the Paizo booth, Gen Con\
  \ 2002.\n   </div> \n   <p>They were (and are) major Star Wars collectors, and many\
  \ of us around the office joked that the real reason Vic and Lisa wanted to run\
  \ the magazine business was to add <i>Star Wars Insider</i> to their considerable\
  \ Star Wars collection, but my time working on Greyhawk with Lisa convinced me that\
  \ the <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> elements were just as important—if not more\
  \ important—to their interests. I wasn’t worried at all. In fact, once I learned\
  \ Lisa and Vic were our potential saviors, the only real question was when we were\
  \ going to move out of the building. My stress evaporated with that revelation,\
  \ and as I recall things, we were all pretty excited about moving on to the next\
  \ phase of our professional lives.</p> \n   <p>As it happens, I am a collector too,\
  \ so one of my favorite early Paizo memories involved physically loading up all\
  \ of the department’s assets into a moving truck headed to the new Paizo offices.\
  \ Johnny suggested that we leave all of the back issues at Wizards, mostly because\
  \ hauling them all down to the truck would take hours of physical labor, and nobody\
  \ really wanted all those old magazines anyway. Lisa and I refused to let that happen,\
  \ knowing just how valuable those dozens of boxes would be, and how criminal it\
  \ would have been to throw them away. So long after most of the staff had gone home,\
  \ Lisa, Vic, and I (and perhaps others I can no longer remember) worked into the\
  \ early morning hours to load those back issues onto the truck.</p> \n   <p>Even\
  \ as we loaded them up, Lisa explained (and I well knew) that we weren’t just salvaging\
  \ the old issues for nostalgia. “Someday we’ll have a website where we can sell\
  \ these to people who want them,” she said. “We are going to make a ton of money\
  \ off of these things.”</p> \n   <p>We <a href=\"/store/magazines/dragon/issues\"\
  >still sell</a> <a href=\"/store/magazines/dungeon/issues\">those back issues</a>\
  \ today. That website grew to become paizo.com, one of the internet’s leading hobby\
  \ stores. Even from the very beginning, Lisa showed that the company would be managed\
  \ with a balance of genuinely geeky love for the game and strong business sense.\
  \ It’s the main reason I’ve stuck around here every year since that first night\
  \ we loaded up the truck with old back issues, and it’s the reason why the company\
  \ has been able to survive and grow stronger far longer than many companies in this\
  \ industry. </p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   <table>\n    <tbody>\n\
