  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">Since the beginning of the year, many of our organized\
  \ play meetings have revolved around the <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\">second\
  \ edition of Pathfinder</a> in one way or another—especially since we launched <a\
  \ href=\"/community/forums/organizedPlay/playtest\">a series of sticky threads asking\
  \ for your feedback</a>. As a team we've each been monitoring a few of these threads\
  \ and incorporating their ideas, critiques, and concerns into our discussions. We\
  \ began <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9l?Future-of-Pathfinder-Society-Update\"\
  >revisiting those topics in blogs</a> last month with Linda's and Tonya's examination\
  \ of tiers, level gain, and the structure of the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</a>. This week we're exploring two related\
  \ topics: boons and Chronicle sheets.</p> \n     <h2>Boons in Second Edition</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Boons were one of the first elements I brought up in the very first\
  \ Pathfinder Society playtest blog because they're so important to so many people.\
  \ At the time, I brought up the boon format used in Starfinder Society, which provides\
  \ a character six fixed slots: Ally, Faction, Personal, Promotional, Social, and\
  \ Starship. Just after the mission briefing, a player can activate one boon of each\
  \ type, representing the favors she's calling in, the special equipment she's requesting,\
  \ the faction she's actively representing, or the non-combatant friend that she's\
  \ bringing along. In addition, there are some slotless boons that represent obligations,\
  \ reminders, and other extras that we don't want taking up a space or feeling optional\
  \ (e.g. \"Oh, you're out of luck, Mr. Villain, for I didn't slot my 'Mr. Villain\
  \ will get his revenge' boon today!\").</p> \n     <p>From a design perspective,\
  \ we've been really happy with Starfinder Society's model. It helps us make informed\
  \ decisions about scenario power level knowing that each PC only has a handful of\
  \ upgrades not normally assumed in the RPG, rather than having several dozen upgrades.\
  \ This is even more important in Starfinder than it is in Pathfinder RPG's first\
  \ edition because the former has fewer bonus types and thus tighter math, so it\
  \ behooves us not to throw off the math too much by inundating players with modifier-altering\
  \ boons. The same is true for Pathfinder's second edition, and we have the same\
  \ concerns about providing so many campaign bonuses that the gameplay or character\
  \ design feels drastically different from a \"classic\" game.</p> \n     <p>That's\
  \ nice in theory, at least. At this point, we've had more than a year to see the\
  \ Starfinder Society boon system in action, and I've been following <a href=\"/threads/rzs2ux64?Boons\"\
  >the boons discussion thread</a> since it began. There are really mixed feelings\
  \ about boon slots. Some people really like them, in some cases even citing the\
  \ balance-related reasons above. Some folks feel that the boon slots are too restrictive,\
  \ preventing someone from using a boon on the fly that they may have kept in their\
  \ back pocket. For others, the boon slots are confusing or cumbersome, and I've\
  \ read some very cross commentary that slotting boons just after the mission briefing\
  \ breaks immersion or grinds play to a halt. For others still, the concept of slotless\
  \ boons seems very jarring, as though including slotless boons undermines the concept\
  \ of boon slots as a whole.</p> \n     <p>In compiling the messageboard feedback\
  \ and discussing this with the rest of the team, we see three primary ways forward:\
  \ typed boon slots, universal boon slots, and limited boons. For each of these,\
  \ there's still a good chance that we'd tag each boon with a type (e.g. Ally or\
  \ Social) because it provides more design space for us later (e.g. an assassin kills\
  \ one of your Ally boons—how morbid).</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>In the <b>Typed\
  \ Boon Slots model</b>, Pathfinder Society's boon system would look a lot like that\
  \ of Starfinder Society. We would swap out one or more of the boon types (e.g. Starship)\
  \ for something more befitting the setting and system. For example, we might have\
  \ a Relic slot that's for especially strange or special gear (like an intelligent\
  \ weapon), a Downtime slot that provides special uses of the downtime mechanic in\
  \ second edition, or a Legacy slot that references some reward from a different\
  \ campaign (like something carried over from first edition or earned in the Adventure\
  \ Card Guild).</li> \n      <li>In the <b>Universal Boon Slots model</b>, a PC would\
  \ still have a limited number of slots; however, there would be no Ally boon slot,\
  \ Social boon slot, or the like. Instead, every slot would be equal. Do you want\
  \ to slot a pile of Ally boons? Sure. Want to have several Downtime benefits at\
  \ once? Go for it. Want to represent several factions at a time, gaining all of\
  \ their benefits? Okay, that would theoretically be possible, even though we haven't\
  \ worked out quite what it would mean to champion multiple factions simultaneously.\
  \ Whatever mix of boons you'd want to use, you could do so with universal boon slots.\
  \ My suspicion is that this would also be a little easier to manage with boon slotting\
  \ during an adventure, for it would be easier to have a default array of boons that\
  \ a player tweaks as necessary based on the adventure.</li> \n      <li>If we don't\
  \ go with boon slots, we really have to consider a <b>Limited Boons model</b> to\
  \ rein in the potential for mechanical bloat—the gradual increase in character power\
  \ as more options or rewards become available. Limited boons could translate as\
  \ awarding roughly the same number of boons as in first edition yet with each boon\
  \ doing less, yet that's not a terribly fun approach; I can already hear some folks\
  \ quipping that some First Edition boons are too weak as is. Instead, a Limited\
  \ Boons model would be one in which boons are overall rarer so that their likelihood\
  \ of stacking in a disruptive way is reduced. On the other hand, this wouldn't involve\
  \ boon slots at all. The main complication is what happens to \"convention boons,\"\
  \ the incentives distributed at conventions, special events, and game days participating\
  \ in the Regional Support Program. If boons are more rare overall, does that risk\
  \ making convention rewards overly potent? No doubt we could find a solution, but\
  \ it's one more hurdle.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>What does this mean for slotless\
  \ boons? Well, there would likely still be some form of Chronicle sheet tracking\
  \ for events that we want to reference later, but depending on the Chronicle sheet\
  \ format (see Mike's section below), there might be a means to record some of that\
  \ in a non-boon format. That way, when you earn the \"Grandmaster Torch's cat always\
  \ hisses at you\" outcome, you might not need a boon to remember it; it might instead\
  \ appear in the adventure summary.</p> \n     <p>As an aside, one of the fun considerations\
  \ to come out of our boon slot discussions was the idea of Events, which are ongoing\
  \ situations that last for one or more scenarios. During the event (or at its end),\
  \ some special effect would take place. For example, an investment might mature\
  \ and give you extra gold at the end of an event, or you might earn the assistance\
  \ of someone important for only a limited time. A Voluntary Event would be one that\
  \ you could activate between scenarios, but it would likely occupy a boon slot during\
  \ that time. A Forced Event would be one that happens whether you intended it or\
  \ not, such as being the subject of negative propaganda that haunts your character\
  \ for three scenarios—all the while taking up a boon slot. I'm mostly bringing these\
  \ up as a possibility, and if it's something we want to explore more, we'll likely\
  \ do so in an upcoming blog.</p> \n     <p>All told, there are lots of possibilities,\
  \ and they intersect in many places with our exploration of Chronicle sheets. Michael\
  \ Sayre takes it from here.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \  <p>In addition to the threads we've opened to gather feedback from the community,\
  \ we've worked internally to find solutions that can make Pathfinder Society more\
  \ accessible, affordable, and interesting. I'll be discussing some of the proposals\
  \ we have for what Chronicle sheets will look at in the new campaign and what goals\
  \ the various styles are trying to address. Before I can do that to any meaningful\
  \ degree though, you'll want to check out four different references: <a href=\"\
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/krlilq8f0nef33t/Proposal%201%20%28Single%20Full%20Sheet%29.pdf?dl=0\"\

  >Chronicle sheet 4</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vzsw8wild9jvevb/Scenario%20Logsheet.pdf?dl=0\"\
  >a sample log sheet</a>. I'll be referencing these below as well as in our Chronicle\
  \ sheet survey.</p> \n      <p>One of the major goals we'd like to accomplish is\
  \ maximizing the real estate on each Chronicle sheet, and we're looking to tackle\
  \ that in a few different ways. First, most Chronicle sheets would present a single\
  \ significant boon related to the adventure, as well as only small selection of\
  \ magic items that would not commonly be available to players. Wealth would be evenly\
  \ distributed across scenarios, rather than having the current situation that can\
  \ occur where some adventures which give somewhat more wealth are preferable to\
  \ play over other adventures that give somewhat less. Ultimately, if something appears\
  \ on a Chronicle sheet, we want it to be significant and as broadly applicable as\
  \ possible for the largest number of characters, though this doesn't mean we won't\
  \ include particularly cool items that appeal more to (for example) fighters than\
  \ wizards or vice versa when the adventure calls for it.</p> \n      <p>We quickly\
  \ discovered that the community had all kinds of feedback on how Chronicle sheets\
  \ are currently handled and what pieces of the Chronicle sheets people felt were\
  \ pulling their weight and which were lagging behind. We also heard from a lot of\
  \ event coordinators concerned with the growing costs of printing Chronicle sheets\
  \ at events. In addition we're considering various proposals to allow players to\
  \ experience stories in the manner most appealing to them, normalizing the value\
  \ of Chronicle sheets in wealth, number and value of boons, and other areas across\
  \ scenarios.</p> \n      <p>Chronicle sheet proposal 1 is the closest approximation\
  \ to our current Chronicle sheet that we believe would be viable going into the\
  \ new system. This full sheet style should be easily stored in a standard binder\
  \ or character folio and has space for us to include a brief synopsis of the adventure\
  \ in which you earned the Chronicle sheet, a small space for tracking purchases,\
  \ and room for adventure-specific notes.</p> \n      <p>Chronicle sheet proposal\
  \ 2 uses a 2-by-2, four-to-a-page style that should reduce costs for GMs and event\
  \ coordinators who would normally be printing off 6 separate sheets of paper. Since\
  \ this style only has room for a boon and item, it would need to be used in conjunction\
  \ with the Scenario Logsheet (see the link above) or a similar tracking sheet.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Chronicle sheet proposal 3 features a 3-column, landscape oriented\
  \ Chronicle sheet that gives us more room for boons and unique items while still\
  \ reducing the print-load on GMs and event coordinators. This version would also\
  \ require the Scenario Logsheet or a similar tracking sheet.</p> \n      <p>Chronicle\
  \ sheet proposal 4 is a cardstock style sheet where each Chronicle sheet would be\
  \ a single boon card. In this example we would generally not include magic items\
  \ on Chronicles, unless the item was of Uncommon or greater rarity; instead Common\
  \ rarity items would be broadly available based on your character's level. Beyond\
  \ just the printing cost, though, this has the advantage of providing a smaller\
  \ surface area that could let a player keep any slotted or active boons very accessible\
  \ at the table.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Let us know what you think of\
  \ the new proposals, and which options you'd most like to use going forward! We're\
