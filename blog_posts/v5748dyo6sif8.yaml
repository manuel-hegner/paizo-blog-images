  \ Brian Valeza </p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Of Pathfinder’s three modes of play,\
  \ <strong>encounter mode </strong>is the most highly structured and often used for\
  \ combat or other stressful situations. Basic encounter rules assume that they are\
  \ being used in combat, but for social scenarios or other situations, you might\
  \ adjust the basic structure to use longer rounds or different actions.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Encounter mode follows this basic structure:</p> \n      <ol> \n      \
  \ <li><strong>Roll initiative.</strong> When the GM calls for an initiative roll,\
  \ make a roll to determine your place in the initiative order—the sequence in which\
  \ all participants take their turns. Usually, this roll is Perception, but in some\
  \ cases your GM might call for Stealth, Diplomacy, or other skills for initiative.</li>\
  \ \n       <li><strong>Play a round.</strong> Beginning with the highest initiative\
  \ roll, all participants take a turn in order. Certain free actions and reactions\
  \ might also let a character act outside of their turn.</li> \n       <li><strong>Begin\
  \ the next round.</strong> Once each participant has taken a turn, the round is\
  \ over and the next begins, proceeding in the same order. Repeat this cycle until\
  \ the encounter ends.</li> \n       <li><strong>End the encounter. </strong>Encounters\
  \ can end when the foe is defeated, a truce is reached, or some other event ends\
  \ combat. At this point, the initiative order is dropped and participants can act\
  \ in a more free-form manner. GMs will often award Experience Points or treasure\
  \ to the party for successfully overcoming the encounter.</li> \n      </ol> \n\
  \      <h3>Turn Structure</h3> \n      <p>When your turn comes around in the initiative\
  \ order, you have three actions to use. These can be spent on single actions, or\
  \ you might spend two or three actions at once for short activities. You also have\
  \ a reaction, which you can use when a given trigger occurs (even if it’s not your\
  \ turn), and free actions (which cost no actions to use).</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      </div> \n      <ol> \n       <li><strong>Start\
  \ your turn.</strong> Some things happen automatically at the start of your turn,\
  \ such as reducing the number of turns remaining on an effect or making recovery\
  \ checks. Do these “at the start of your turn” tasks in any order, then regain your\
  \ 3 actions and 1 reaction.</li> \n       <li>You can use actions in any order,\
  \ but you must complete one action or activity before beginning another. Once you\
  \ have spent all three actions, your turn is over—or you can choose to end your\
  \ turn early and lose your remaining actions. You cannot split a two- or three-action\
  \ activity between turns.</li> \n       <li><strong>End your turn.</strong> After\
  \ your actions are completed, you can take the “end of your turn” steps in any order\
  \ you choose. These steps could include ending spells that you chose not to sustain,\
  \ taking persistent damage, and attempting saving throws for existing conditions.</li>\
  \ \n      </ol> \n      <p>Some combat encounters in unusual settings might require\
  \ additional rules—<em>Pathfinder Player Core </em>also includes guidance for aerial\
  \ combat, mounted combat, aquatic combat, and more.</p> \n      <p>Outside of encounter\
  \ mode, a GM might transition the party into <strong>exploration mode</strong> or\
  \ <strong>downtime</strong>—which we’re excited to cover in blogs to come!</p> \n\
