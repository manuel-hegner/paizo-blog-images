  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Matteo Spirito</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>The doors of the refuge shuddered as the monstrosity slammed against\
  \ it once more. Wood that had protected the townsfolk faithfully for generations\
  \ cracked and split, the stout timbers no match for the strength of a full-grown\
  \ troll.</p> \n     <p>Kyra moved through the cave, tending to the injured in the\
  \ light of ancient glowworms. She'd long since used up the last of her magic, and\
  \ now had little more to offer than a kind word and a gentle hand. Yet still she\
  \ walked among them, head held high—a symbol of Sarenrae's salvation.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Why don't you fight it?\"</p> \n     <p>The child was small and shoeless,\
  \ with the unflinching boldness of the very young. Kyra seethed at the question,\
  \ yet knelt to look him in the eye, careful to keep her voice calm. \"We have no\
  \ fire. Without it, my sword is useless. And I have no magic left.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The child frowned. \"But Sarenrae has fire <i>and</i> magic. Shouldn't we pray?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Aren't we?\" Kyra smiled, reaching out to cup the child's cheek.\
  \ \"Sometimes the best prayer is helping others.\"</p> \n     <p>The child opened\
  \ his mouth, but any further questions were cut off by a final, fatal crunch from\
  \ the doors as the crossbeam gave way. Kyra turned and drew her scimitar, waving\
  \ aside the townsfolk who were frantically pressing their backs against the ruined\
  \ wood.</p> \n     <p>The doors exploded open, slamming into the unfinished rock\
  \ of the stronghold's walls. The soft glow of the cave worms spread gentle, syrupy\
  \ light over the hulking shoulders and shovel-sized claws of the murderous troll.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Kyra stepped forward. Despite her wounds, despite the heaviness of her\
  \ sword arm, her heart felt lighter than it had since the whole nightmare had begun.\
  \ She was out of tricks, out of any real hope of defeating the beast—yet here she\
  \ was, placing herself between the predator and the innocent. Right where she was\
  \ supposed to be.</p> \n     <p>As she'd told the child, sometimes that was prayer\
  \ enough.</p> \n     <p>\"Again, priest?\" Wet lips smacked around protruding tusks\
  \ as the troll chuckled. He spread his enormous arms, showing thin lines of scar\
  \ tissue that had been gaping wounds an hour ago. \"So be it. I'm ready. But are\
  \ you?\"</p> \n     <p>Kyra said nothing, only angled her blade and slid her rear\
  \ foot back into Sunrise Wakes the Mountain.</p> \n     <p>He was right, of course.\
  \ She'd been outmatched even when she'd been fresh, when her heart-fires had roared\
  \ with the spells of her faith. Yet the stance still came easily, muscles trained\
  \ by countless morning prayer forms. Her mind might know she was beaten, but her\
  \ body didn't.</p> \n     <p>\"You're out of magic.\" The troll grunted—a boar's\
  \ wet snort. \"Your goddess has abandoned you. But die how you like.\" He shrugged\
  \ and reached for her.</p> \n     <p>That's when she felt it: the familiar warmth,\
  \ waiting like a hot coal in her chest. She breathed in, letting the embers flare,\
  \ and sank into the heat like the embrace it was. She raised her holy symbol.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The troll's tiny, piggish eyes shot wide, and then the flames engulfed\
  \ him, searing green flesh black. He roared, falling backward as he burned.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Kyra let the goddess's symbol fall back against her chest, pain flooding\
  \ back in as the magic receded.</p> \n     <p>From the cave floor, the charred mess\
  \ of the troll glared up with agonized incredulity. His croak was as cracked as\
  \ his flesh. \"How?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You were wrong.\" Kyra stood over him, looking\
  \ down calmly. \"Whatever happens, the goddess never truly leaves us. She'll walk\
  \ with me until my last breath.\"</p> \n     <p>She raised her sword in both hands.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Or until yours...\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>If you liked\
  \ this week's Iconic Encounter, you won't want to miss next week's exciting entry.\
  \ Until then, Pathfinders, may you walk in the light and heat of the sun!</p> \n\
