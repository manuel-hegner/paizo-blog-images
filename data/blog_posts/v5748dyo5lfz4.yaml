  >This week was the GAMA Trade Show in Las Vegas, where about 350 of the top hobby\
  \ games retailers in the world gathered with game manufacturers to discuss new products,\
  \ new organized play initiatives, and the gaming business in general. Over the last\
  \ several years, GTS has gotten more and more healthy, reflecting a revitalized\
  \ hobby game retail environment. It's always great to meet face-to-face with retailers,\
  \ and this week a lot of the discussion focused on <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> and the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of\
  \ Winter</a> set.</span></p> \n     <p>About an hour before the show opened, our\
  \ friends at WizKids stopped by the Paizo booth with a little surprise—a complete\
  \ set of production-run <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> figures!\
  \ We split the set and each of our booths featured several figures that had never\
  \ before been seen in public. </p> \n     <p>Looking over my half here in my hotel\
  \ room (you'll never get them back from me, WizKids! Neeeevvvveeerrrrrr!!!), I'm\
  \ struck by the amazing quality of the paint jobs. As I've discussed in previous\
  \ blogs, after aiming slightly above the head of the production factory with the\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a> set, starting\
  \ with <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> we simplified the\
  \ number of paint steps on each figure. This (miraculously, as it seems to defy\
  \ logic) actually resulted in BETTER figures, since the plant had enough time to\
  \ give each figure the attention it deserved.</p> \n     <p>I was very pleased with\
  \ the production paints in <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a>,\
  \ but there were still enough problems here and there that I felt there was room\
  \ for improvement. And wow, based on the production run figures I'm looking at right\
  \ now, <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> hits it out of the park!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lft7\">Female Ice\
  \ Troll</a>, for example, features what I think might be the best paint job on any\
  \ figure we've done to date. It's not particularly elaborate or innovative or anything,\
  \ but it is absolutely flawless in execution. When we're talking about production\
  \ runs for tens of thousands of figures, there's always going to be a little bit\
  \ of variance from figure to figure. Not every Female Ice Troll is going to look\
  \ exactly like this one, but we've been doing this for seven full sets now, and\
  \ I'm more confident in the final quality of <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign\
  \ of Winter's</a> paint steps than I have been with any previous <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> set.</p> \n     <p>After seeing the figures, I'm also more\
  \ confident about one of my lingering concerns about the set—the existence of so\
  \ many weird miniatures.</p> \n     <p>I've previously discussed the <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfxo\"> \"modern\"</a> figures in the set,\
  \ like the Russian Machine Gunner and Rasputin. I knew going in that these niche\
  \ figures wouldn't be for everyone, but again the quality (and the relatively small\
  \ number) gave me a lot of confidence that even skeptics wouldn't mind them. So\
  \ after getting a look at the final models, I didn't worry too much about the modern\
  \ figures.</p> \n     <p>I remained a bit concerned, I must confess, about the Triaxians.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Part of what makes the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\"\
  >Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a> so great as a roleplaying experience—travel\
  \ to different worlds filled with exotic creatures—makes it a somewhat more daunting\
  \ prospect for a set of miniatures likely to be used by lots of gamers who are not\
  \ running the Adventure Path, and simply want to use the miniatures in adventures\
  \ of their own design. </p> \n     <p>The campaign's fourth adventure, <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yv3\">\"The Frozen Stars,\"</a> takes place on a\
  \ frigid planet inhabited by two unusual creatures. Triaxians, the planet's natives,\
  \ were originally described to me as \"furry elves.\" The dragonkin are, essentially,\
  \ dragons who wield weapons and who are often used as mounts by the Triaxians.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Art for both of these creatures was absolutely phenomenal, but I still\
  \ worried a bit about just how cool (and, more importantly, how useful) these figures\
  \ would be. </p> \n     <p>I've now seen them in person, and I am no longer worried\
  \ at all. </p> \n     <p>Let's take a quick look at a few of them.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Ceseer_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Ceseer_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The most unusual Triaxian figure in the set is\
  \ Cesseer of Ning, an ass-kicking monk who makes for a brutal enemy when crossed.\
  \ For fun, we decided to portray Cesseer in mid kick, giving the figure a very dynamic\
  \ appearance. Cesseer easily doubles as a catfolk monk for campaigns a little closer\
  \ to home than Triaxus. As usual, WizKids did a fantastic job on the sculpt, which\
  \ includes tons of awesome little details. Cesseer of Ning is a Medium, rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Dragonrider_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Dragonrider_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have a member of Triaxus's vaunted Dragon\
  \ Legion, and for my money this is one of the coolest figures in the entire <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> set. Heavily armed with an axe, a pole-arm,\
  \ and three javelins (all of which look GREAT in hand), this figure sports massive\
  \ three-dimensionality and would make for a killer player character figure. Yes,\
  \ it's got a bit of fur on its face and legs, but with a big helmet and armor covering\
  \ just about every other part of his body, this figure frankly looks human at table\
  \ distance. One of the best sculpts of a Medium figure we've produced to date, the\
  \ Dragon Legion Dragonrider is slotted at the rare rarity.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_RedDragonkin_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_RedDragonkin_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>If you like the Dragonrider, you'll love seeing\
  \ another member of the Legion fully mounted on a big red dragonkin! Of all the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> figures displayed at the Paizo\
  \ booth at the GAMA Trade Show, this garnered the most attention—and rightly so.\
  \ Again, the Dragonrider atop this bad boy easily doubles as a human, but looks\
  \ alien enough if you know where to look. The shading on the red dragonkin looks\
  \ wonderful, and I guarantee your players are going to start to sweat when this\
  \ piece hits the table. The Red Dragonkin Rider is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n\
  \     <p>And that's it for this week's reveals. We'll be back next week with more\
  \ cool preview images. Remember, the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a>\
  \ set is scheduled for a late May release. Contact your retail store to make sure\
  \ they have your figures in stock, or preorder here at Paizo.com!</p> \n     <p>Until\
  \ next week,</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br \\> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    </div> \n\
