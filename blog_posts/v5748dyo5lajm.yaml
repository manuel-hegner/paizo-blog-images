  \ \n   <p>More than two years ago it fell to me to write the <a target=\"nofollow\"\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/35E/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy7xpx\"><i>Rise\
  \ of the Runelords Player's Guide</i></a>, setting the stage for characters to take\
  \ part in a world that was, at the time, painted not even in broad strokes but more\
  \ in generally tossed bucket-sized splashes. Over time and through hundreds of thousands\
  \ of words, though, what started as made-up names have transformed into some of\
  \ the better-known characters, organizations, and locations in Golarion. But probably\
  \ the passage that folks have grabbed onto most zealously comes from the description\
  \ of the paladin on page 8, \"Korvosa—in its traditional ties to Cheliax—enthusiastically\
  \ supplies Citadel Vraid, bastion of the Hellknight Order of the Nail. The Chelish\
  \ Hellknights pay homage to no deity, but rather bend the rigid law and infernal\
  \ traditions of Hell to their will.\"</p> \n   <p>For years now folks have asked\
  \ for more details on this iron-shod order of enforcers, even beyond their details\
  \ in the <a target=\"nofollow\" href=\"/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/35E/v5748btpy84eo\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a>, but the time has never seemed\
  \ quite right to give away the entire farm—I admit, I've been kind of precious with\
  \ my pet antiheroes. At the same time, rules for running or playing Hellknights\
  \ have always been vague, largely because I didn't want to work up a class that\
  \ would immediately have to be updated to the <a target=\"nofollow\" href=\"/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"\
  >Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a>. But now, with the PF RPG rules in circulation,\
  \ my blasphemous baby <a target=\"nofollow\" href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy85jm\"\
  ><i>Book of the Damned Volume 1: Princes of Darkness</i></a> nearing the shelves,\
  \ and the <a target=\"nofollow\" href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87da\"\
  >Council of Thieves Adventure Path</a> being set in the very city where the Hellknights\
  \ were formed, the time finally feels right. </p>\n   <p>So, as of <a target=\"\
  nofollow\" href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87db\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #27</a>, the Hellknights finally march\
  \ forth, that volume revealing everything characters need to confront, research,\
  \ and even join the numerous orders of Hellknights. That's right, that does mean\
  \ there's finally going to be a Hellknight prestige class—and one of the largest\
  \ ones I've ever seen at that.</p> \n   <p>But that's not all: in <a target=\"nofollow\"\
  \ href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87dc\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #28</a>, expect the other side of the coin,\
  \ with a GM-focused inside look into the mindset, citadels, and history of these\
  \ infamous orders.</p> \n   <p>So that's back-to-back months of Hellknight action\
  \ coming at you, finally answering many questions about the deadly knighthood, yet\
  \ also revealing dozens of new mysteries. For example, taken from <a target=\"nofollow\"\
  \ href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87db\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #27</a>, presented here are just two of the several new lesser\
  \ Hellknight Orders detailed therein. But that will have to do for now—not surprisingly,\
  \ the Hellknights frown upon spoilers.</p> \n   <br> <b>Lesser Orders</b>\n   <br>\
  \ \n   <p>Despite the cull of 4639, numerous lesser orders of Hellknights still\
  \ exist. Most of these orders work at the edges of Cheliax's sphere of influence\
  \ or within the countries once within the Chelish empire's thrall. Despite their\
  \ smaller size, the majority of these factions uphold the same code as their elder,\
  \ better-established brethren, though many uphold practices that subtly deviate\
  \ from the core knighthood. Most are careful not to defy the mandates of the Measure\
  \ and the Chain (the core philosophies of the Hellknights; detailed in <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path</i> volume #28), however, as the larger, more powerful orders are\
  \ mindful of those who would use the Hellknight name to opposing ends.</p> \n  \
  \ <p><b>Order of the Crux</b>: One of several bands of mercenaries dubbed Hellknights\
  \ during the Chelish civil war, the skull-clad Order of the Crux refused to disband\
  \ after the revolution. Hunted down and destroyed by the Order of the Scourge in\
  \ 4663, the butchers were slaughtered and their fortress, Citadel Gheisteno, put\
  \ to the torch. However, 25 years later, three graveknights clad in scarred Hellknight\
  \ armor rose from the ruin. Calling themselves the Order of the Crux and led by\
  \ the venomous Lictor Shokneir, the undead triune lurks upon the border of Nidal\
  \ and Molthune, seemingly biding their time.</p> \n   <p><b>Order of the Coil</b>:\
  \ Among the smallest Hellknight factions, the Order of the Coil maintains holdings\
  \ near the Sargavan city of Eleder, from where they viciously seek to tame the tribal\
  \ natives of the country and put an end to their backward pollution of the outside\
  \ world. Seeing the efforts of scholars and adventurers—particularly Pathfinders—\
  as spreading a disease of savagery by carrying curios from the jungles into the\
  \ world beyond, the Coil hunts down and destroys such explorers and artifacts, notorious\
  \ for ending these perceived corruptions with poison and flames. The favored weapon\
  \ of the Order of the Coil is the greataxe.</p> \n   <p>Wes Schneider <br>Managing\
