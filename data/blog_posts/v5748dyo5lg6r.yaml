  \     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Nearly a year has passed since we introduced\
  \ the check boxes to scenarios' reporting sheets in Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play. Perhaps you haven\"t had the opportunity to GM a Season 5 scenario, so let\
  \ me recap the idea. Almost every scenario in Season 5 has had four check boxes\
  \ labeled \"A\" through \"D,\" and the end of scenario provides instructions of\
  \ which ones to check off depending on what happened during the adventure. Did the\
  \ PCs ally with Team 1? Check box A. Did they ally with Team 2? Check box B. If\
  \ they instead destroyed Team 1 or 2, check box C or D respectively.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>The results of those check boxes are included when the organizer reports\
  \ the scenario online, and we/ve been using that data to watch trends and shape\
  \ the storyline in increasingly visible ways. For example, the Qadira faction has\
  \ recruited several trade partners over the past year, but some of their rivalries\
  \ with one another have required the PCs to choose one to favor over the other.\
  \ When I looked at the numbers reported from an earlier scenario, I saw the two\
  \ of the parties were neck-and-neck, so they returned for a rematch in a later scenario.\
  \ Another example involved choosing where to construct a basecamp, and after collecting\
  \ data for a few months, I saw that there was a clear favorite. That choice decided\
  \ the course of a recent scenario. Even seemingly innocuous matters like an NPC\
  \ surviving a scenario allow you to shape future adventures when we determine what\
  \ villains are still out there and harboring a grudge.</p> \n     <p>Data like these\
  \ also contribute to the ongoing evolution of the Pathfinder Society's eight active\
  \ factions. Back in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5leod\">April 2013</a> we revealed\
  \ that faction goals might change over time. In fact, based on the storyline, character\
  \ decisions, and player feedback, even a faction's alignment and leadership could\
  \ change. Over the course of the Year of the Demon, the original five factions have\
  \ all distanced themselves from their respective nationsâ€”some pushed away by troubles\
  \ at home and others pulled toward greener pastures. No doubt many of you have witnessed\
  \ these events throughout the season, and blog posts later this month will reveal\
  \ these factions' new faces and interests.</p> \n     <p>Of course, any talk about\
  \ changes to factions stirs up questions. Is my faction changing? Are you eliminating\
  \ any factions? What if I don't like what is happening to my faction? Can I change\
  \ factions for free? How long do I have to change factions? In brief, we're aiming\
  \ to make any transitions as reasonable, painless, and fair as possible. We'll provide\
  \ more details as we get closer to the new season.</p> \n     <p>Finally, I'll be\
  \ appearing on the <a href=\" http://35privatesanctuary.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=34\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Know Direction podcast</a> on the Wednesday, June 18th. I'll\
  \ post more details here and on the Pathfinder Society messageboard as the interview\
  \ gets closer.</p> \n     <p>Happy gaming,</p> \n     <p>John Compton and Mike Brock<br>\
