  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"><b>This article\
  \ appeared in the August Issue of Meeples Monthly. We are pleased to present it\
  \ to you now.</b></p> \n     <p>Putting together <i>Alien Archive 3</i>, the third\
  \ volume of the Starfinder roleplaying game’s science-fantasy counterpart to the\
  \ bestiaries of fantasy games, carried with it plenty of challenges. Not least of\
  \ these was carrying through on the promise of the successful formula established\
  \ by the previous two volumes: scores of aliens, each with a two-page spread and\
  \ plenty of art, all accompanied by a raft of player options, such as gear, feats,\
  \ and a bunch of alien species that player characters can use to build their own\
  \ characters. But <i>Alien Archive 3</i> also has quite a few things going for it\
  \ that make it a lot more than just another book of weird and wonderful aliens.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>First and foremost, more than half of the authors of this book are women,\
  \ non-binary people, or from other groups traditionally underrepresented in the\
  \ mainstream roleplaying game community (both in terms of bylines and storylines).\
  \ The diverse perspectives of this pool of authors shine through brilliantly in\
  \ the final book, and it was my great pleasure to work with all of its authors,\
  \ whose experience ranged from 20-year veterans to first-time writers for Starfinder.\
  \ Several authors also helped achieve this representation, asking to take fewer\
  \ writing assignments, or even none at all, to ensure that others could have the\
  \ opportunity to contribute.</p> \n     <p>Speaking of authorship, I had the pleasure—\
  and pain—of writing Starfinder’s new creature companion system for <i>Alien Archive\
  \ 3</i>. The process was a thrill ride of flow charts, tables upon tables (upon\
  \ tables!) of statistics, and frantic loophole-closing. Fortunately, Starfinder\
  \ Design Lead Owen K.C. Stephens and Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton\
  \ were on the case during development. They helped shape the system into its final\
  \ form, which lets Starfinder player characters pal around the galaxy with a dinosaur\
  \ mount, an empathic spider friend, a laser-wolf pup—just to name a few. I sought\
  \ John’s consultation in particular, as he views our products from an Organized\
  \ Play perspective and can anticipate the needs of that robust player base (along\
  \ with some of the exploits they might have otherwise found).</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  >Illustration by Raphael Madureira</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>And that same player\
  \ base made its own contributions to this book! One of the most popular aliens introduced\
  \ in our Starfinder Society adventures are morlamaws, who can be briefly described\
  \ as brightly colored space walruses with four tusks and a rich culture. The charismatic\
  \ creatures were an instant hit with the community, especially since players can\
  \ create their own morlamaw characters, so they were a shoo-in for an expanded treatment\
  \ in <i>Alien Archive 3</i>. They were originally brought to life by author Kate\
  \ Baker, a prolific game master and Starfinder Society volunteer, and we were lucky\
  \ to have her back to flesh morlamaws out for a full entry in this book.</p> \n\
  \     <p>One of the aliens I’m most excited to share with the wider world is the\
  \ cephalume, a bioluminescent squid-like alien that hails from the liquid-methane\
  \ seas of its home planet and has a symbiotic relationship with its barnacles. But\
  \ I love the origin of this creature even more than its fascinating physiology.\
  \ At last year’s PaizoCon, our company’s annual convention, we held two alien-design\
  \ panels, during which we collaborated with the attending audience to create a brand\
  \ new alien, all while artist guest of honor Taylor Fischer sketched out our ideas\
  \ on a projector. When it came time to name the creature, an audience member suggested\
  \ the name cephalume, which was an instant lock. Months later, when writing the\
  \ outline for <i>Alien Archive 3</i>, I knew we had to include the cephalume, and\
  \ I knew who to ask to write it: the audience member who’d named it, Jessica Redekop!\
  \ Jessica did a great job making a marginally plausible creature into a fascinating\
  \ alien—and especially adventurous players can choose to play as one. We were even\
  \ able to send Taylor’s fantastic sketches as reference material to artist Nathanael\
  \ James, who rendered a captivating pair of cephalumes that made me love them even\
  \ more.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/101519_Cephalume.jpg\"\

  \ its chest.\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration by Nathanael\
  \ James</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Along with morlamaws and cephalumes, <i>Alien\
  \ Archive 3</i> presents 18 species that players can use when creating their own\
  \ characters, bringing the total count of playable alien species in Starfinder to\
  \ more than 100! Notable new options are playable undead creatures and a playable\
  \ sentient swarm of insects. This incredible total is a concrete sign of our efforts\
  \ to give Starfinder a galaxy-spanning cantina feel… but there’s no way we’re stopping\
  \ there! One of the best parts of creating a book full of new creatures is giving\
  \ life to things that were single-sentence throwaways in previous books—and seeding\
  \ new single-sentence throwaways for the future…</p> \n     <p><i>Joe Pasini is\
