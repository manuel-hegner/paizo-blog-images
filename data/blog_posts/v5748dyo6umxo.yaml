  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">I’ve known Gorum longer than\
  \ anyone else. Although he’s changed and developed in ways I never considered, he\
  \ was created for my homebrew setting back in the very early 90s, as I was rounding\
  \ out my campaign setting in preparation for a big campaign I was going to run for\
  \ several friends in my college dorm.</p>\n      <p>He wasn’t the first, second,\
  \ or third divinity I created for my setting (those honors go, in order, to Yamasoth,\
  \ Treerazer, and Desna), but he was part of the larger group of two-dozen or so\
  \ gods I invented once the world-building bug bit me. I wanted a deity in my setting\
  \ who was someone like Crom, someone non-clerics like Conan could pray to or curse\
  \ to before, during, and after a fight. Unlike Crom and Conan, though, I wanted\
  \ this god of war to be fully armored and armed in iron and steel. And so the idea\
  \ of a god who presents as an animated suit of armor was born into my setting.</p>\n\
  \      <p>When it came time to build Golarion, we were very pressed for time. We\
  \ had to simultaneously close out the magazines and then jump right into producing\
  \ our own RPG content without skipping a month, due to the realities of the subscription-based\
  \ promises and methods Paizo had been built on. It’s very difficult to build an\
  \ adventure in a world without proper nouns. You can make that up as you go, but\
  \ that runs the risk of rushing an important job. So as I was put in charge of the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Path line, I made the decision to draw from my then 15-year-old\
  \ setting for much of that lore. Which included the deities.</p>\n      <p>We wanted\
  \ to do 20 “core deities” from the start because it was a fun number to aim at (this\
  \ being a d20 game), but also because that allowed us to create two different types\
  \ of deities for each of the 9 alignments, with 2 left over to pad the numbers (one\
  \ of those went to Neutral to create a “best choice” deity for druids, and one of\
  \ those went to Lawful Good to create a “best choice” deity for paladins).</p>\n\
  \      <p>Gorum ended up making the jump from my homebrew at that stage into the\
  \ public by being one of the two chaotic neutral deities chosen, and for the next\
  \ 17 years, he would serve as Golarion’s god of war.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \      <h2>Roleplaying the Grim Reaper</h2>\n      <p>When we decided it was time\
  \ to shake things up in the Lost Omens setting, the death of a god made the most\
  \ sense. We’d done this at the dawn of the campaign with the death of Aroden—even\
  \ though his death took place a century earlier, it still was a huge part of our\
  \ world’s lore. But killing off someone no one knows about is very different than\
  \ killing off someone who some folks have known for 17 years (or in my case, closer\
  \ to 34 years). We had a lot of discussions about which of the core 20 deities we\
  \ wanted the metaphorical Grim Reaper to visit. We didn’t want to kill off an evil\
  \ deity, since that would have less emotional impact, but we also didn’t want to\
  \ take out a deity we had strong plans for in the future, or whose role in the setting\
  \ was significantly load bearing.</p>\n      <p>In my homebrew in the early 2000s,\
  \ I killed off Abadar as part of a plot where the world was slipping into entropy\
  \ and the PCs had to step up to help prevent more gods from being killed, and he\
  \ was thus my first nomination. But he’s also someone who’s a handy non-evil villain\
  \ to have around, and beyond that, he had a role in the future in Starfinder. Other\
  \ folks suggested other deities, but in the end, we all settled on Gorum. Here was\
  \ a god who wasn’t evil, who was part of the core 20 but didn’t have a particularly\
  \ strong role in the lore, didn’t represent a specific ancestry or character class,\
  \ but who was still popular enough that his death wouldn’t feel hollow. It would\
  \ still sting. It would still be noticeable. And it would absolutely change the\
  \ setting—especially when we decided that the death of the god of war wasn’t going\
  \ to make war go away, but instead let war run rampant.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \  <p>Unlike Aroden’s death, which was and will remain shrouded in mystery, we aren’\
  t being coy about Gorum’s death. The specific methods by which he dies will be spelled\
  \ out in print, and your PCs will be able to take part in multiple adventures impacted\
  \ by the event—an event known as Godsrain, and which begins a period historians\
  \ will refer to as the War of Immortals. We’ll have information about what your\
  \ clerics of Gorum can do next, particularly in adventures where the event takes\
  \ place after you’ve already potentially started playing clerics of Gorum. We hope\
  \ the specific details of how and why will resonate with everyone in the same way\
  \ they do with me and everyone on the editorial team at Paizo!</p>\n      <p>During\
  \ PaizoCon last month, we revealed more details about where and when Gorum dies,\
  \ as well as how you can read those details as a GM, how your PCs can take part\
  \ in those details as they play out in the course of play, or how you can experience\
  \ them in the form of fiction. Those who want light spoiler information about where\
  \ you can find out more, read on. Those who want to be surprised about the event\
  \ when it happens in your game—I’ve already said too much!</p>\n      <details>\n\
  \       <summary>SPOILERS</summary>\n       <p>Gorum’s death is described in detail\
  \ in the upcoming standalone adventure, <a href=\"“/products/btq02eyz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Prey-for-Death”\
  \">Prey for Death</a>. Where that event takes place during the adventure, I won’\
  t say more now, but GMs who read the adventure will find that information front\
  \ and center. How much the players learn, and when that learning happens, depends\
  \ on the choices they make during play, of course!</p>\n       <p>The <a href=\"\
  “/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/curtaincall”\">Curtain Call Adventure\
  \ Path</a> will be starting in a world before these events take place, but by the\
  \ end of that three-part, high-level campaign, Gorum will be dead. While the direct\
  \ impact of this will be less than it was in Prey for Death, other developments\
  \ rising from the event will be on full display. Again, the timing of where and\
  \ when Godsrain falls during Curtain Call isn’t something we’ve revealed, but it\
  \ will become obvious once the first volume (and its short summary of the campaign’\
  s three chapters) is published.</p>\n       <p>After that, <a href=\"“/products/btq02oar?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals”\
  \">War of Immortals</a> presents additional information about the rules involved\
  \ with these events, <a href=\"“/products/btq02oal?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Divine-Mysteries”\
  \">Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</a> spends some time exploring the way the gods of\
  \ the setting are changing, and the novel <a href=\"“/products/btq02sx8?Pathfinder-Godsrain”\
  \">Godsrain</a> chronicles some in-world fiction involving some familiar iconic\
  \ heroes as they experience certain developments caused by the death of Our Lord\
  \ in Iron.</p>\n       <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n        <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a30d1d78-4726-4b18-985d-49ed27038b37/PZO12006-HC_GorumsDeath_1500x2000.png\"\

  \      </details>\n      <p>After these, we’re not simply going to let the topic\
  \ go, of course. The Godsrain may be over, but the War of Immortals is only beginning.\
  \ And while we’ll soon reveal the exact event in which Gorum dies in print for you\
  \ to read, there are other new mysteries that event sets up. Mysteries we have plans\
  \ for. These events—Gorum’s death and other still-unrevealed-complications that\
  \ death creates—will continue affecting the Lost Omens setting from this point forward,\
  \ much in the same way that the re-introduction of the runelords in the very first\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Path continues to have ripple effects, the closing of the\
  \ Worldwound allows for the exploration of new stories, and the secession of Ravounel\
  \ sets up brand new narratives to experience. The War of Immortals is larger in\
  \ scope and scale than all of those, though, make no mistake. You’ll see the aftermath\
  \ of the Godsrain play out in the <a href=\"“/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/triumphOfTheTusk”\
  \">Triumph of the Tusk Adventure Path</a> later this year, and it has some ripple\
  \ effects that help kick things off in next year’s just-announced Spore War Adventure\
  \ Path as well. Not every adventure will be focused on these events—the one after\
  \ Spore War won’t, for example—but just as we’re still telling stories about runelords\
  \ or the aftermath of the Worldwound or the fate of Ravounel, what goes down during\
  \ the War of Immortals is here to stay.</p>\n      <p>Unlike Gorum.</p>\n      <p>But\
  \ do not weep for him! Instead, maybe the next time your PC slays a dragon, defeats\
  \ an evil warlord, or simply earns a new weapon or suit of armor, raise a sword\
  \ in his memory.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
