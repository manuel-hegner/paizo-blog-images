  \ players and GMs alike have been speculating about what would appear in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9c25\"><em>Pathfinder Unchained</em></a>. It was only a short step\
  \ from there to start wondering what would appear in <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>. We started exploring this same question\
  \ early in the book's production, and even then it was clear that some sections\
  \ would not be a good fit for the campaign, others would absolutely play a role,\
  \ and many others would require closer study. With the generous assistance of the\
  \ Pathfinder Design Team and numerous volunteers, we were able to weigh the pros\
  \ and cons and finalize what our Pathfinders might see in the field.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>We'll start by discussing some of the sub-systems that likely come as no surprise\
  \ to anyone, largely because they would require massive character rebuilds, severely\
  \ impact how the game works for someone who just has the <em>Core Rulebook</em>,\
  \ or require us to scrap the current XP system. Much of Chapter 3 (Gameplay) falls\
  \ into this category; removing alignment, ditching iterative attacks, altering poison,\
  \ heavy revising action economy, and introducing wound thresholds would invalidate\
  \ considerable chunks of existing scenarios and possibly wreck how many of our existing\
  \ characters function. Other features reference gameplay elements that simply don't\
  \ appear in the organized play campaign, so dynamic item creation, alternate profession\
  \ rules, fractional base bonuses, and staggered advancement are not a good fit.\
  \ As intriguing as the many new skill options look, imposing consolidated skills,\
  \ grouped skills, or background skills would just be too disruptive for a campaign\
  \ in its seventh year. The same is true for many of the magic systems, including\
  \ simplified spellcasting, spell alterations, automatic bonus progressions, and\
  \ innate item bonuses.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1131-RestfulMeditation.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br><i>Illustration by Tomasz Chistowski</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Several\
  \ other systems were not so cut and dry. We discussed the stamina pool system for\
  \ quite a while before deciding not to include it; it is an extensive section that\
  \ we may revisit in the future, but at this time it is not available in the campaign.\
  \ We came to a similar conclusion for variant multiclassing. We are adding the Signature\
  \ Skill feat for exclusive use by the unchained rogue—which I suppose spoils a later\
  \ surprise. John is very excited to include esoteric components and scaling items\
  \ on a few Chronicle sheets, but these items are not available for purchase otherwise.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Still, we imagine Chapter 1 (Classes) is the topic everyone is waiting\
  \ for, and we have seen many of you making fairly accurate predictions. All four\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Unchained</em> classes—barbarian, monk, rogue, and summoner—will\
  \ be legal for use in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. The unchained barbarian,\
  \ monk, and rogue are available in addition to the versions that appear in the <em>Core\
  \ Rulebook</em>; as noted on page 8 of <em>Pathfinder Unchained</em>, \"These classes\
  \ can be used alongside their original counterparts (although individual characters\
  \ must use one version or the other exclusively).\"</p> \n     <p>In fact, we're\
  \ so excited about these classes that we're announcing a one-time limited rebuild\
  \ to anyone with one or more levels in these classes, allowing those characters\
  \ to switch any levels in the four classes to their unchained version at no cost.\
  \ This includes the automatic retraining of any rage powers or rogue talents, as\
  \ well as the free retraining and selling at full cost of any feats, items, and\
  \ other character options that no long function properly due to the unchained classes\
  \ features. For example, a rogue automatically gains the ability to add her Dexterity\
  \ bonus to damage, so she could sell back her +1 agile rapier at full price. Likewise,\
  \ a barbarian with the Raging Vitality feat would no longer benefit from its increased\
  \ Constitution bonus, so she could retrain that feat for free. Much like when we\
  \ have offered free faction changes in the past, you'll need to take advantage of\
  \ this opportunity before you play the character after April 29, 2015.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>You may notice that we did not say the unchained summoner would be available\
  \ alongside its <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em> counterpart. <b>Effective immediately</b>,\
  \ the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em> summoner is no longer available in the organized\
  \ play campaign, and the unchained summoner is its legal replacement. However, we\
  \ recognize that someone who already has a summoner (and the book to play it) should\
  \ not be punished for this change. Therefore, if you have a character with levels\
  \ in the summoner class, and you have played the character at least once at level\
  \ 2 or higher, you get to keep your summoner as is; you may also continue to gain\
  \ levels in the summoner class. Any character gaining a level in summoner for the\
  \ first time must use the unchained summoner, and anyone character still within\
  \ the 1st-level window of free rebuilding must also use the unchained summoner.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As a final note, we want to advise folks about archetype and other features'\
  \ compatibility for the unchained classes for the organized play campaign.</p> \n\
  \     <ul>\n      <li>The unchained barbarian qualifies for any archetype that does\
  \ not modify how the rage class feature operates (such as the urban barbarian archetype),\
  \ and she is limited to any barbarian rage power that appears in Chapter 1 (including\
  \ the rage powers on page 13)</li> \n      <li>The unchained monk does not qualify\
  \ for any archetypes, save those in future publications that specifically cite their\
  \ compatibility with the unchained monk class.</li> \n      <li>The unchained rogue\
  \ qualifies for all existing rogue archetypes, but she is limited to any rogue talents\
  \ listed in Chapter 1 (including the sidebar on page 24).</li> \n      <li>The unchained\
  \ summoner qualifies for all existing summoner archetypes, save those that modify\
  \ the eidolon's type or base form.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p><i>The Pathfinder\
  \ Society Team</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder Society,\
