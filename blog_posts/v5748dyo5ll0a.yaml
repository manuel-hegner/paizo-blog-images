  \ with a set of pawns and launched the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujs?Pathfinder-Pawns-Traps-Treasures-Pawn-Collection\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Pawns: Traps &amp; Treasures Pawn Collection</i></a>. The experiment\
  \ seemed to work, so when there was a spot on the schedule for another Pawn Collection,\
  \ we decided to try another set of pawns that represented objects rather than creatures,\
  \ and that set is here this month with the <a href=\"/products/btpya1as?Pathfinder-Pawns-Dungeon-Decor-Pawn-Collection\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Pawns: Dungeon Decor Pawn Collection</i></a>.</p> \n    <p>Putting\
  \ together this set of pawns was fun. We had a brainstorm where the creative team\
  \ filled up an entire whiteboard in short order. We had more ideas than I could\
  \ fit into this set, and more ideas than just things found in a dungeon. In this\
  \ pawn collection there's a good mix of dungeon dressing, furniture, doors and windows,\
  \ spell effects and hazards, and things you might find outside rather than inside.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>When we released the <i>Traps &amp; Treasures Pawn Collection</i>, I\
  \ grabbed some Flip-Mats and minis and headed to a conference room to set up some\
  \ scenes to show the set off, so I figured I do the same for this new release. Check\
  \ out some of the things you'll find in <i>Pathfinder Pawns: Dungeon Decor Pawn\
  \ Collection</i>!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20180816-Decor3.jpg\"\
