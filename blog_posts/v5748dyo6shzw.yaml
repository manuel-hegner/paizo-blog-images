  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today we’re going to pull\
  \ back the curtain on our two upcoming multi-table interactive events for the 2022\
  \ Paizo Organized Play season. If you’re not familiar, Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ Organized Play release yearly multi-table events that can be played with as few\
  \ as three tables and well over 150+ tables at the world’s largest events. These\
  \ are intended to be epic adventures where players can work alongside others to\
  \ accomplish monumental feats and battle great evils. In the past, these events\
  \ have often been tied to key story points for Organized Play. Last year, we explored\
  \ the unique events of a Pathfinder and Starfinder crossover. This year, we’re keeping\
  \ away from the ongoing metaplots of our Organized Play years and making our multi-table\
  \ interactive events a bit more standalone, so they can be enjoyed by anyone at\
  \ any time.</p> \n     <p>Some of you may notice that the level ranges have dipped\
  \ down a bit from what we’ve previously offered. There are a few reasons for this.\
  \ We wanted to make sure these events offered a select level range to make it easier\
  \ for event organizers to run and to ensure that these can be offered easily as\
  \ walk-up events for new players at events around the world. Secondly, we’re trying\
  \ to bridge some of the cognitive load that is required to run these events. As\
  \ of right now there are effectively four scenarios worth of content in one of these\
  \ interactives. Adding on additional level ranges makes them exceptionally tricky\
  \ to slot for events and for GMs to prepare for properly. But worry not, we’ll have\
  \ more high-level content coming in the future (in addition to the always growing\
  \ repertoire of sanctioned content). Finally,because the workload on interactives\
  \ is immense, it takes a lot of time and effort for Paizo’s extremely talented staff\
  \ of developers, editors, and artists to complete. We want to make sure that these\
  \ events can still continue without adding undue stress or delays on other projects\
  \ for our staff, so this change is an important step in achieving that goal.</p>\

  \ A Time of Crisis</em> debuts at PaizoCon 2022 and is Organized Play’s first foray\
  \ into the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis\"\
  ><em>Drift Crisis</em></a> event. In this adventure, a large group of Starfinders\
  \ heads out on a routine archaeological mission, only to find themselves caught\
  \ in the first event of the Drift Crisis. To survive the challenges to come, groups\
  \ of characters from local communities or around the world need to come together\
  \ and work as a team. In this exciting event, we’ll be giving characters the opportunity\
  \ to answer, “Where were you during the Drift Crash?”—an event that kicks off the\
  \ Drift Crisis and can be followed-up in all aspects of the Starfinder setting.\
  \ Written by veteran author Dennis Muldoon, this interactive is intended for 1st\
  \ to 6th level characters and is split into level range 1–4 and 3–6 to better help\
  \ event organizers.</p> \n     <p><em>Pathfinder Society #3–98: Expedition into\
  \ Pallid Peril</em> is set to release in early August with a GenCon 2022 debut.\
  \ In this multi-table event, the PCs head into the mountain region of Droskar’s\
  \ Crag in search of the entrance to a fabled lost dwarven city. Prior expeditions\
  \ involved lone groups of Pathfinders, such as <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ni?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-219-Enter-the-Pallid-Peak\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society #2–19: Enter the Pallid Peak</em></a> and more recently\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02apj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Delve-the-Pallid-Depths\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society #3–10: Delve the Pallid Depths</em></a>. This expedition\
  \ is the largest yet, with several Pathfinder groups set to explore the mountain\
  \ ruins in hopes of finding the entrance to the lost dwarven city of Raseri Kanton,\
  \ which is believed to be lost somewhere within the so-called Pallid Peak. The amazingly\
  \ talented Rigby Bendele has put together a masterpiece adventure for multiple players.\
  \ This event is intended for 1st to 6th level characters and is split into level\
  \ range 1–4 and 3–6 to better help event organizers.</p> \n     <p>That’s all for\
  \ today’s blog! Look forward to more information on these interactives as we get\
  \ closer to the big conventions of the year.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
