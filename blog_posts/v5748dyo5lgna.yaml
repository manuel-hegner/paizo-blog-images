  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The world is full of mysteries.\
  \ Truths hidden in plain sight, obscured to further secret goals and nefarious agendas.\
  \ Some dare to uncover these secrets, venturing into the shadow to learn about these\
  \ strange forces, and now you can be one of them.</p> \n    <p>Welcome to the playtest\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9a0h\"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a>, a book filled\
  \ with mysteries and secrets due out in summer 2015. This hardcover Pathfinder RPG\
  \ rulebook will contain a mountain of new material for your game, from mysterious\
  \ orders to strange powers, not to mention new archetypes, feats, spells, and magic\
  \ items. As with our previous playtests, we want to make sure this book is the best\
  \ it can be, and that's where you come in. <em>Occult Adventures</em> includes 6\
  \ new base classes to add to your game, each one focusing on one aspect of psychic\
  \ magic. Similar in some ways to arcane and divine magic, psychic magic ventures\
  \ into new territory, utilizing the power of the mind, body, and soul. Each of the\
  \ classes in this playtest uses psychic magic in different ways, from the raw power\
  \ of the kineticist to the subtle manipulations of the mesmerist.</p> \n    <p>You\
  \ can download the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/occultAdventuresPlaytest\"><em>Occult\
  \ Adventures Playtest</em></a> document now! The PDF contains a brief discussion\
  \ on the nature of the occult in Pathfinder, all 6 of the new classes, and a selection\
  \ of psychic spells. Give these classes a read, build a character, and most importantly,\
  \ use them in your games. Once you've had a chance to give them a try, go to our\
  \ messageboards and post up your thoughts and feedback. We are eager to hear what\
  \ you think works with these new rules and what still needs work. This playtest\
  \ will remain open until <b>November 25th</b> (although we will keep it open for\
  \ an additional round of playtesting if feedback warrants any significant revisions).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In addition, starting next week, there will be a survey for each one\
  \ of the classes, allowing us to gain some basic insight on your opinions about\
  \ these classes. These will be available on Tuesday, <b>November 4th</b>, and remain\
  \ open until the end of the playtest. Please share your input before then!</p> \n\
  \    <p>You can even play these classes in <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society</a>. For this playtest, we have added <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/occultAdventuresPlaytest\"\
  >a special boon</a> for those who make a character and play them during the playtest.\
  \ We're excited to see how these classes work in PFS!</p> \n    <p>Finally, I want\
  \ to take a moment to talk about the playtest process itself. Although we find all\
  \ feedback useful, thoughts and comments based on actual play experience is by far\
  \ the most valuable. Please try to fit these classes into your game, or even just\
  \ run a few mock encounters. When posting to <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/occultAdventuresPlaytest\"\
  >the playtest forums</a>, look for existing threads on your topic before starting\
  \ a new oneâ€”this will help us to better absorb and respond to feedback. While discussions\
  \ can become heated, remember that every game is different and every poster is trying\
  \ to make the game better for everyone. Be polite and respectful of the ideas others'\
  \ posts.</p> \n    <p>Well, that about wraps it up for now. <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/occultAdventuresPlaytest\"\
  >Grab the PDF</a> and uncover the occult secrets that lie within. We will be waiting\
  \ for you on the boards, looking for your feedback and ideas. Thank you for participating\
  \ and helping us playtest <em>Occult Adventures</em>.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br>\
