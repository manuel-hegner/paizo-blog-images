  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, Pathfinders! This is the first in\
  \ a recurring series of blog posts written by you. We're kicking things off with\
  \ homebrew scenario creator extraordinaire Ron Lundeen. After reading this, I learned\
  \ that Ron and I design scenarios in a similar way, so I can vouch for this excellent\
  \ advice.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Hey, all! I'm Ron Lundeen, freelance\
  \ author and avid Pathfinder Adventure Card Game fan. I'm here to give you a rundown\
  \ on homebrew scenario design. I've released over 80 scenarios, including the very\
  \ first fan-made scenario for the game and two full homebrew Adventure Paths: <em>Shield\
  \ of Rannick</em>, which allows you to reuse all your <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>\
  \ cards in a whole new way, and <em>Bloodlust Corsairs</em>, which does the same\
  \ for <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>. You can pick up these Adventure Paths and more\
  \ for free at <a href=\"http://welbybumpus.com\" target=\"_blank\">welbybumpus.com</a>.\
  \ Now that the \"establishing my bona fides\" and \"hawking my work\" bullet points\
  \ are out of the way, let's talk scenario design. I'll break this down in four steps.\
  \ Along the way, let's design a new scenario!</p> \n     <h2>1. Fit the Story to\
  \ the Cards, Not the Cards to the Story</h2> \n     <p>First, find a few cards you'd\
  \ like to use together in interesting ways. This is the most exciting part of scenario\
  \ design for me, and I usually do it with the cards right in front of me. You might\
  \ have an awesome scenario idea about a haughty nobleman protected by an army of\
  \ obstinate bureaucrats, but without cards to fit those ideas, you won't get very\
  \ far (which is where the <a href=\"http://drivethrucards.com/PACG\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >card creator at DriveThru Cards</a> could become your friend, but we're concentrating\
  \ on scenarios you can make with cards that you already own.) So start with the\
  \ cards, then build a simple story.</p> \n     <p><i>Our Scenario:</i> Let's use\
  \ Wrath of the Righteous. The loot card Fiendsplitter from Adventure Deck 3 is a\
  \ powerful weapon devoted to Torag, righteous god of the dwarves, and the villain\
  \ Staunton Vhane from Adventure Deck 2 is an evil dwarf. Perhaps those two can go\
  \ together: Vhane has stirred up some group to attack dwarves who follow Torag.\
  \ An evil dwarf seems like just the kind of guy to lurk in a remote Canyon or Cavern,\
  \ preying upon pilgrims at a Celestial Beacon. We'll plan on using those locations.\
  \ Plus, this set has Blessings of Torag—perhaps we can use those somehow. We now\
  \ have the nucleus of our scenario!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-StauntonVhane_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>\"Axes and dwarves\" feels a little stereotypical, but we have\
  \ to start somewhere.</i>\n     </div> \n     <h2>2. Consider Where the Cards Are\
  \ (or Could Be)</h2> \n     <p>Certain cards are going to be required for your scenario—\
  villains, henchmen, and locations, most likely. Those are pretty freely available\
  \ for you to mix and match across adventure decks, or even across entire adventures.\
  \ You don't want henchmen that are wildly more powerful than the villain (or vice\
  \ versa), because the adventure will feel uneven. Building a scenario around cards\
  \ other than villains, henchmen, and locations is a lot of fun, but must be done\
  \ carefully. If your scenario requires other cards, consider whether they might\
  \ already be in someone's deck; if so, don't use them, or set your scenario earlier\
  \ than the cards would \"appear\" in your game.</p> \n     <p><i>Our Scenario:</i>\
  \ For Vhane's henchmen, let's use Deraknis. Vhane hasn't been paired with those\
  \ before. I'd really like to use Blessings of Torag somehow—maybe shuffling all\
  \ four of them into the Celestial Beacon to represent the pilgrims there—but those\
  \ are base box blessings and therefore could be in players' decks already. So it's\
  \ best not to have any special rule with those. Fiendsplitter is granted as loot\
  \ in the third adventure, so we should set our scenario prior to adventure 3. Let's\
  \ call it adventure 2 (which is also in line with our villains and henchmen). We'll\
  \ banish Fiendsplitter at the end of the scenario; let's say the pilgrims of Torag\
  \ loan it to the characters to put down Vhane.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Derakni_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Do they seem a little easy? We'll fix that.</i>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <h2>3. The Scenario Designer Giveth and the Scenario Designer Taketh Away</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Most scenarios have a factor that makes things easier and another that\
  \ makes them harder. If you notice that a scenario has one fewer location than normal,\
  \ you can bet it's going to have a rule making the scenario pretty tough (like needing\
  \ to close all locations to win.) If the scenario has only one or two locations\
  \ regardless of the number of players, you'd better strap in. For both easier and\
  \ harder scenario rules, steal like crazy from anywhere in the game: villain powers,\
  \ support card effects, and even character powers all provide good ideas for scenario-wide\
  \ rules. Plus, the tricky part of including a rule—wording it clearly—has already\
  \ been done for you.</p> \n     <p>Most scenarios mix locations that are beneficial\
  \ and locations that are harmful. Mix those up as the number of players increases—\
  you don't want to have only beneficial locations for smaller groups with the harmful\
  \ locations showing up only for larger groups. But more importantly, choose locations\
  \ that fit the theme of the story you're telling. If doing that makes the whole\
  \ scenario feel a bit too easy or too hard, skew the scenario rules to compensate.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>If your scenario is a one-off game that you intend as a detour from\
  \ a published Adventure Path, the reward should be light: a single card draw is\
  \ sensible. If you're designing an entire adventure—or even an entire Adventure\
  \ Path—provide rewards at the same frequency as those provided by the published\
  \ adventures.</p> \n     <p><i>Our Scenario:</i> Let's have a scenario rule to make\
  \ Fiendsplitter a bit better; we want to let multiple characters get a lot of use\
  \ out of it. Some characters—like Alain and Radillo—can put useful cards on top\
  \ of their decks, so let's create a power like that for Fiendsplitter. To ramp up\
  \ the difficulty, and to keep the Torag theme, let's use a rule I swiped from the\
  \ <i>Kraken</i> ship card from Skull &amp; Shackles: against the villain or henchmen,\
  \ characters must replace each die they roll that's larger than their Strength die\
  \ with their Strength die. For locations, we already have the beneficial Celestial\
  \ Beacon and the harmful Canyon and Cavern; let's include a few more locations appropriate\
  \ for a pilgrim's trail through an isolated mountainous region. This is a one-off\
  \ scenario where we anticipate being rewarded by holy pilgrims, so a non-Basic blessing\
  \ is a reasonable reward.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>That's right: I just stole from a pirate ship.</i>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <h2>4. Shake It Until You Break It</h2> \n     <p>Once you have your scenario\
  \ sketched out, test it a few times with groups of different characters and different\
  \ sizes. The more you deviate from the standard scenario model, the more you should\
  \ test it. Pay particular attention to where you've changed how an existing rule\
  \ works, so you can see whether that makes other rules function oddly or whether\
  \ the change disproportionately affects some characters more than others. If you\
  \ find something like that, change it or build an exception around it. Or you can\
  \ just pretend that's what you intended all along!</p> \n     <p><i>Our Scenario:</i>\
  \ Playtesting reveals that our scenario doesn't work for large groups—there aren't\
  \ enough Derakni cards in the set to populate all the locations. We need to add\
  \ one more henchman. I first thought about a Grimslake, but that seemed too tough\
  \ in testing, so let's use Chorussina instead. After testing with a bunch of different\
  \ characters, I found that the rule about limiting some checks to your Strength\
  \ die doesn't really bother Crowe, but that's okay: Torag loves Crowe. The rule\
  \ also particularly handicaps low-Strength characters like Seoni and Enora, so we'll\
  \ make sure that characters who spend mythic charges to swap in d20s don't have\
  \ their d20s knocked down to their Strength die. Low-Strength characters can then\
  \ plan to reserve mythic charges for this circumstance.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Vhane's bringing this gal to the party.</i>\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>Now we've got our final scenario, <em>The Pilgrim's Axe</em>. Give it a\
  \ try and let me know what you think in the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/homebrew\"\
