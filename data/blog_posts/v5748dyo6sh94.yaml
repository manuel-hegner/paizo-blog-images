  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">Owlcat Games and Deep Silver have revealed the date\
  \ for the critically acclaimed launch of <b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker Definitive Edition</b>\
  \ on PlayStation®4 and the Xbox One family of devices, including the Xbox One X,\
  \ as well as PC. The classic RPG will take adventurers to the Stolen Lands on <em>August\
  \ 18th</em>, featuring all previously released content packs as well as a brand\
  \ new turn-based mode. The game will be available at selected retail stores as well\
  \ as through the digital stores of the respective platform.</p> \n      <center>\n\

  \       <p><em>“The turn-based mode brings the game even closer to the tabletop\
  \ experience, providing the players with more precise control over the battlefield.\
  \ Our point was to have both modes – real-time with pause and the new turn-based\
  \ mode – in a perfect co-existence so players can smoothly switch between both to\
  \ adjust the gameplay at any time to their needs. It settles the long-running debate\
  \ among the fans which mode is better for Kingmaker since they can go from an action-oriented\
  \ real-time combat style to a more tactical one within a single encounter,\"</em>\
  \ states Oleg Shpilchevskiy, Head of Studio at Owlcat Games</p>\n      </blockquote>\

  \  <p><b>\"Pathfinder: Kingmaker – Definitive Edition\" Content:</b><br> <b>Pathfinder:\
  \ Kingmaker</b> takes players on tour through the infamous Stolen Lands, the dangerous\
  \ and turbulent territories well known within Pathfinder fandom. The computer RPG\
  \ revisits familiar characters and well-known locations of the \"series\" lore and\
  \ treats players to brand new adventures, deadly foes, and unforeseen twists and\
  \ turns. Fans of the fantasy pen-and-paper RPG will experience its epic, heroic\
  \ universe in new ways while computer RPG gamers will discover their favorite genre\
  \ in a more contemporary light, in stunning 3D graphics that bring the universe\
  \ to life.</p> \n      <p><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</b> will challenge players as\
  \ both adventurers and rulers as they claim explored lands and carve their kingdom\
  \ from the wilderness. Kingdom founding goes beyond simple stronghold-building to\
  \ become a true reflection of the hero’s character and choices made throughout the\
  \ game. Each kingdom is a living thing shaped by alignment, choices, allies, and\
  \ the hero’s ability to lead his or her people.</p> \n      <p>The <b>Definitive\
  \ Edition</b> features all previously released DLCs:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><b>Pathfinder:\
  \ Kingmaker - The Wildcards</b><br> Intrepid explorers of The Stolen Lands can discover\
  \ a new playable race the <b>Tieflings</b>, harness the power of a newly playable\
  \ class <b>Kineticists</b>, and booster their party with the companion the <b>Tiefling\
  \ Kineticist</b>, who brings her own and rich, engaging storyline.</li> \n     \
  \  <li><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - ’Varnhold’s Lot</b><br> Just as you were claiming\
  \ your first title, another hero of the Stolen Lands became a baron too: Maegar\
  \ Varn, captain of the Varnling Host mercenary band and rightful ruler of Varnhold.\
  \ In this DLC, you join Varn as his general, and experience ’Varnhold’s valorous\
  \ history first-hand.<br> Playing a full new storyline that runs parallel to the\
  \ main story, players will import the results of this adventure to their main story,\
  \ facing the consequences of their choices when moving forward with their main party\
  \ and storyline.</li> \n       <li><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Beneath The Stolen\
  \ Lands</b><br> <b>Beneath The Stolen Lands</b>, valiant adventurers meet with the\
  \ self-proclaimed protector of Golarion and discover what secrets lie buried beneath\
  \ the Stolen Lands, in a shifting labyrinth of madness where nothing is what it\
  \ seems as they defend the lands against one of the most deadly enemies the world\
  \ has ever seen. Enter the dungeon as your main character. Alternatively, you can\
  \ wait for an invitation from a mysterious protector of Golarion as you play through\
  \ the main story. The pre-set version of the dungeon is included in the main campaign,\
  \ allowing you to use your character and companions to conquer the Tenebrous Depths.</li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Bloody Mess –</b> The name says it all\
  \ – adding more blood and gore to the game as an additional option.</li> \n    \
  \   <li><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Arcane Unleashed –</b> DLC adding more magic\
  \ and spells to the game.</li> \n       <li><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Royal Ascension\
  \ -</b> Includes Soundtrack, Digital Artbook, two in-game portraits, board game\
  \ module, hi-rez map, and a red panda. </li> \n      </ul> \n      <div class=\"\
