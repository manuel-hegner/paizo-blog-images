  >You're playing Pathfinder on game night, and you're ready to add Syrinscape's custom-made\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Path SoundPacks to the session. Simply follow these step-by-step\
  \ instructions for bringing epic sound to your gaming table.</p> \n    <p><b>How\
  \ do I prepare?</b></p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the <a href=\"http://syrinscape.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Syrinscape Fantasy Player</a> for free.</li> \n     <li>Stock-up\
  \ on custom-made <a href=\"https://store.syrinscape.com/subscriptions/1-adventure-path/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Adventure Path SoundPacks</a>, created specifically\
  \ for the Pathfinder RPG's most-popular Adventure Paths, and don't miss the official\
  \ monster sounds created to bring the most horrific creatures of Golarion to life,\
  \ in earth rumbling surround.</li> \n     <li><a href=\"https://store.syrinscape.com/account/login/?next=/account/campaigns/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Create your Sound Campaign</a>, where you can organize your\
  \ sounds so everything you need for the session is right at your fingertips.</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p><b>What audio equipment should I use?</b><br> You want the floors\
  \ to rumble with those dragon roars, don't you? Syrinscape will work on any PC,\
  \ MAC, Android Tablet or iPad, but to get the most out of Syrinscape's beautiful\
  \ audio, we recommend plugging into a Surround Decoder via HDMI, or connecting to\
  \ a portable Bluetooth speaker. Something with a crisp treble and a good dose of\
  \ bass will really help maximize the impact of Syrinscape's immersive audio.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>How easy is Syrinscape to work during the game?</b><br> Very easy!\
  \ Let's say you're starting in a medieval town, because really, most proper Pathfinder\
  \ adventures start there, right? Syrinscape has several town settings, such as \"\
  Brindol Town\" or \"Local Heroes\" from the <a href=\"https://store.syrinscape.com/store/products/35-burnt-offerings-sound-pack/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path Burnt Offerings SoundPack</em></a>.\
  \ Once you've selected the town setting, you can choose your MOOD for different\
  \ flavors of town life, such as Main Street, Market Street, and of course, a tavern.\
  \ When you're ready to begin, simply touch the MOOD button, and Syrinscape takes\
  \ care of the rest by gently fading up a highly realistic town ambience. Every now\
  \ and then a cart might go past, or a hawker selling their wares might cry out,\
  \ or the local bard might chime in with a tune every now and then. Syrinscape does\
  \ all the work.</p> \n    <p><b>What next?</b><br> Syrinscape provides so much more\
  \ to your gaming session than dynamic ambient <i>background</i> sounds. Are your\
  \ players ready for the big dramatic reveal, like an epic dragon raid? Choose your\
  \ dragon from the Syrinscape library, and when you're ready, touch the MOOD button\
  \ to set off the chaos. It's best not to warn your players, so you get the maximum\
  \ impact from the first terrifying roar!</p> \n    <p><b>Is that really all there\
  \ is to it?</b><br> Yes! Adding the amazing Sounds of Syrinscape to your game is\
  \ so easy! And just wait till you see the dropped jaws of your players when you\
  \ surprise them with the incredible realism and immersion that Syrinscape brings\
  \ to your Pathfinder game.</p> \n    <p>For more tips and a live demo, check out\
  \ the video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrdB_a4ayjQ\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >How to Use Syrinscape with your Pathfinder Game</a>.</p> \n    <p>Have fun, good\
  \ gaming; now go make some noise!</p> \n    <p>Benjamin Loomes<br> <i>Creative Director<br>\
