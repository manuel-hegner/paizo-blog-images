  \    <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 24, 2008 </p> \n    <p>While Mike was working\
  \ on the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81xy\"><i>Guide to Korvosa</i></a>, he and I\
  \ brainstormed ideas for what kind of perils might be dwelling in the Shingles.\
  \ We'd both seen plenty of monster-infested city undergrounds, but we wanted something\
  \ more with Korvosa; we wanted a monster-infested rooftop. Sort of. We didn't want\
  \ things like dire bats or manticores stomping around up there—whatever ended up\
  \ in the Shingles had to be relatively small and agile. Nick Logue's adventure already\
  \ had a pseudodragon in it, and I liked the idea that these little dragons were\
  \ perhaps native to the region and adapted to the rooftops as the city took over\
  \ the landscape. And Mike had all these rogue, castaway imps flapping around. From\
  \ there, the image of periodic imp-on-pseudodragon sky clashes popped into my head—\
  it was too awesome an image to resist, and so the imp and pseudodragon battles became\
  \ a part of the city's flavor.</p> \n    <p>This wasn't really meant to be much\
  \ more than flavor; just something that makes Korvosa unique. But we got a little\
  \ carried away, and suddenly two huge pictures in the book were of this supposedly\
  \ rare event. With the extra weight lent by the illustrations, the imp and dragon\
  \ clashes became THE iconic Korvosan event. Problem is, of course, that the game\
  \ rules get in the way of this flavor. Pseudodragons can't actually hurt imps, so\
  \ logically speaking, such huge battles should only ever happen once and after that,\
  \ it's all imps all the time, right?</p> \n    <p>Not really. If you want more rules\
  \ to back up how these battles work out, it's a relatively simple thing to come\
  \ up with variants and additions for both sides to even things up a bit. Of course,\
  \ you can just fake it, saying that with enough pseudodragons piled onto you, no\
  \ amount of damage reduction will really help. Alternately, you can rule that Korvosa's\
  \ imps have lived on the Material Plane so long that they're now considered native\
  \ outsiders and have lost their fast healing and damage reduction as a result.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>My preference? The Impslayer feat! Give it to all your Korvosan pseudodragons\
  \ as a bonus feat, and watch the imp ichor fly! </p> \n    <p><b>New Feat: Impslayer</b></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Many of Korvosa's nobles decorate their roofs with tiny amounts of precious\
  \ metals, among them silver-lined weather vanes, shingles, and gutters designed\
  \ to catch the sunlight to give their homes a distinctive sparkle in the sunlight.\
  \ By spending years sharpening stings and teeth against these silver-enhanced decorations,\
  \ or sneaking drinks of holy water from outdoor fonts at various temples, some pseudodragons\
  \ have effectively transformed themselves into deadly weapons against the city's\
  \ imps.</p> \n    <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Pseudodragon</p> \n    <p><b>Benefit:</b>Your\
  \ natural weapons bypass an imp's damage reduction. In addition, your great skill\
  \ at fighting imps allows you to apply your Dexterity modifier to damage done with\
  \ natural weapons rather than your Strength modifier, as your blows are delivered\
  \ with great precision rather than force.</p> \n    <p><b>Special:</b> Pseudodragons\
  \ born and raised in Korvosa's Shingles gain this feat as a bonus feat.</p> \n \
