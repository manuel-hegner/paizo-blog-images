  \ into the <a href=\"/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"><em>Jungle\
  \ of Despair</em></a>, and things are not looking good for our survival. We overcame\
  \ the murderous vines, shambling refuse heaps, creeping tendrils, and pygmy plant\
  \ people that plagued us last week, but it seems our trials are only beginning!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This morning we passed what can only be interpreted as a warning—a clear\
  \ suggestion to TURN BACK! I mean, look at this skull pole. Look at it! Don't tell\
  \ me that doesn't freak you out.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180205-SkullPole.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180205-SkullPole_90.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>But did we heed the warning? Of course we didn't. And\
  \ the result was a nice trip to the bottom of this fine obstacle. That's some welcome\
  \ mat! See that blood on those spikes? Yeah, you guessed it—that's mine. I much\
  \ prefer my life-sustaining bodily fluids remain on the inside, thank you very much.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180205-PitTrap.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180205-PitTrap_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And all this for some magic relic supposedly lost in\
  \ dwarven ruins deep in the heart of the jungle? I didn't even know there were dwarves\
  \ in the jungle. I thought they liked caves and canyons and dark, dry places. This\
  \ place is anything but that! Still, ancient legend of the magic anvil claims that\
  \ anything forged upon it will be flawless in form and unbreakable in construction.\
  \ That's worth all this trouble, right? Right?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180205-MagicAnvil_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>What the others don't realize, however, is that anything\
  \ we find in the heart of this humid hellscape we must carry with us the many miles\
  \ back to civilization. And we came for an ANVIL! Maybe I can use it to forge myself\
  \ a wheelbarrow. In the meantime, everything we find goes into this trunk case.\
  \ It looks like it'd be right at home on the deck or in the cargo hold of a jungle\
  \ river barge, doesn't it? It's less appealing strapped to my back while I wade\
  \ through thigh-deep, leech-filled muck, though, believe me.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180205-TrunkCase_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Who am I to complain, though? I get to live the dream,\
  \ the life of an adventurer. I get to venture into the untamed wild, and plunder\
  \ whatever treasures I find there, left unguarded for millennia. Huh? Nature isn't\
  \ unguarded, you say? There are forces protecting it and its bounty from exploitation?\
  \ Great, I guess I'll just have to talk about some of those next week.</p> \n  \
