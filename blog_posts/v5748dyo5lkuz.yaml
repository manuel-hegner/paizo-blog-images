  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Conditions were a significant\
  \ part of Pathfinder First Edition, giving a set package of rules to effects like\
  \ being blinded or fatigued. You might be wondering what kind of condition our conditions\
  \ are in!</p> \n    <p>For the playtest, we've expanded conditions to cover a little\
  \ more ground in two different directions. In one direction, now any long-lasting\
  \ effect can impose a condition on a character. These conditions might be defined\
  \ by a specific spell or ability, and often include a specific type of bonus or\
  \ penalty called a conditional bonus or conditional penalty. This broadens our definitions\
  \ so that more rules can now speak to conditions as ongoing effects. In the other\
  \ direction, we've expanded on the conditions from First Edition to create a solid\
  \ set of basic conditions for the playtest. Some of these conditions cover common\
  \ benefits, allowing us to clarify how multiple effects combine. For example, the\
  \ accelerated condition increases your speed by a certain value, and the hampered\
  \ condition decreases your speed by a certain value. You use only the highest accelerated\
  \ value you have—it's not cumulative. So if one effect made you accelerated 5 and\
  \ another made you accelerated 10, your speed would increase by 10 feet, not 15.\
  \ Many other conditions are quite similar to those you're familiar with, such as\
  \ blinded or paralyzed (plus some rules tweaks, of course).</p> \n    <p>Some of\
  \ our other conditions speak directly to the new action system for the game. The\
  \ two big ones here are quick and slowed, which increase and decrease your number\
  \ of actions. When you're quick, you gain one extra action per turn that you can\
  \ use in one or more ways, according to the effect that made you quick! For instance,\
  \ a 20th-level monk with Enduring Quickness is permanently quick, and can use the\
  \ extra action to Stride, to Leap, or as part of a High Jump or Long Jump. The <i>haste</i>\
  \ spell makes its target quick, and lets them use the extra action to Stride or\
  \ Strike. So, if our 20th-level monk benefited from <i>haste</i>, he would add Strike\
  \ to his list of options for the extra action from the quick condition as long as\
  \ the <i>haste</i> spell was in effect. Conversely, slowed removes actions and prevents\
  \ the creature from readying actions. This, like accelerated above, is an example\
  \ of a condition that comes with a condition value to indicate how severe the condition\
  \ is. So, a creature that becomes slowed 1 loses 1 action per turn, a slowed 2 creature\
  \ loses 2, and so on. These aren't cumulative, so if your barbarian gets slowed\
  \ 2 by one creature and slowed 1 by another, she loses only 2 actions.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Let's look at some other conditions that have condition values! The frightened\
  \ condition has a higher value the more scared you are, and this value is also the\
  \ conditional penalty you take to your checks and saving throws. So if you're frightened\
  \ 2, you take a –2 penalty to checks and saves. There's some good news, though,\
  \ because fear tends to pass after the initial shock. Frightened's condition value\
  \ decreases by 1 at the end of each of your turns, until it reaches 0 and goes away.\
  \ This condition covers all types of fear, so there's no more shaken or panicked.\
  \ Frightened doesn't automatically make you run away, but some effects give you\
  \ the fleeing condition as well, potentially for as long as you remain frightened!\
  \ The sick condition is similar to frightened in that it gives you a penalty to\
  \ the same rolls, but it's more severe for two reasons. First off, you're too sick\
  \ to drink anything—including potions! Moreover, it doesn't go away on its own.\
  \ Instead, you have to spend an action retching in an attempt to recover, which\
  \ lets you attempt a new save to end the sickness.</p> \n    <p>Some conditions\
  \ reflect the relationship between one character and another—for instance, when\
  \ you're concealed or flat-footed. In the office, we call these relative conditions\
  \ (as opposed to absolute conditions, like stunned or deafened, that don't involve\
  \ others). The two examples I gave are pretty straightforward. The flat-footed condition\
  \ gives a –2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some things make you flat-footed to everyone,\
  \ but usually you're flat-footed to a creature that's flanking you or that otherwise\
  \ has the drop on you. With the new critical rules, that 2 points of AC can make\
  \ a big difference. Plus, rogues can sneak attack flat-footed targets! The concealed\
  \ condition works much like concealment used to—an attacker has to succeed at a\
  \ DC 5 flat check to hit you. In the playtest, flat checks have replaced miss chances\
  \ and other things that might fail or succeed regardless of skill. Attempting a\
  \ flat check is like any other d20 roll against a DC, except that no modifiers alter\
  \ your result, so you need to roll a 5 or higher on the die or you just miss.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Some effects that used to deal ability damage now impose new conditions\
  \ instead. Enfeebled imposes a conditional penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls,\
  \ and Strength-based checks equal to the enfeebled condition's value. Sluggish is\
  \ similar, but for Dexterity-based values: AC, attack rolls, Dexterity-based checks,\
  \ and Reflex saves. The stupefied condition covers mental effects, imposing a conditional\
  \ penalty on spell DCs as well as on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based\
  \ checks. It also requires you to attempt a special roll each time you cast a spell\
  \ or else your spell is disrupted (meaning you lose the spell!). Because the penalty\
  \ from stupefied also applies to this roll, the worse the stupefied condition's\
  \ value, the harder it gets to cast spells!</p> \n    <p>Finally, let's look at\
  \ one of the conditions used frequently by the barbarian, as shown in <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo5lkui?Barbarian-Class-Preview\">Monday's blog</a>. When\
  \ you're fatigued, you're hampered 5 (the opposite of accelerated, so your speed\
  \ is decreased), and you take a –1 conditional penalty to your AC and saving throws.\
  \ Furthermore, your fatigue means everything takes more effort to do, so when you're\
  \ fatigued, each action you use on your turn worsens this conditional penalty by\
  \ 1 until the start of your next turn. So if you use all three actions on your turn\
  \ when you're fatigued, your defenses are at a –4 penalty! In the barbarian's case,\
  \ the fatigue from a rage goes away pretty quickly, but if you get fatigued from\
  \ another source, it typically takes a night's rest to recover.</p> \n    <p>Are\
  \ you looking forward to playing with these conditions? What do you think about\
  \ the change to flat-footed? What conditions do you dread the most?</p> \n    <p>Logan\
