  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Adam Heine</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Trine Treachery</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Blit crept\
  \ toward the body, fingering two vials which, when mixed, would create an explosive\
  \ powerful enough to separate a person from their more important appendages.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Just in case.</p> \n    <p>The body was a woman, unconscious but still\
  \ very much alive. She must have gasped in pain and then passed out again. No wonder—\
  her leather armor bore a gash the length of Blit's forearm. How had she survived\
  \ at all? Blit leaned in to see the woman's face.</p> \n    <p>He nearly dropped\
  \ his vials. Allyra! He could even smell the Puddleglut's \"famous ale\" on her\
  \ skin.</p> \n    <p>She still breathed, but barely. A trickle of blood had dried\
  \ at the corner of her mouth. Trying very hard not to think about how she'd gotten\
  \ there (in leather armor? And was that <i>her</i> warhammer?), Blit unstrapped\
  \ the armor to get at her wound.</p> \n    <p>She had a ragged cut from her left\
  \ hip to her lower ribs on the right. A serrated blade, like the kind Gedrak typically\
  \ carried. Blit grabbed some rags from his pack. He cleaned the wound as best he\
  \ could and wrapped it tight until the bleeding stopped. She was still breathing\
  \ when he finished, which was something, but she wasn't waking up, and for all of\
  \ Blit's tricks, he had nothing that could wake her. Ironically, patching up <i>people</i>\
  \ wasn't in his job description.</p> \n    <p>What the hell could he do? He <i>should</i>\
  \ kill her and pretend he'd never seen her alive, or tell Odim and have him do the\
  \ job. Just the thought of that made him sick, though. No, he had to finish his\
  \ work and get her the hell out of there. Somehow.</p> \n    <p>That night may not\
  \ have been his best work. Every two minutes, he looked back to make sure Allyra\
  \ still breathed, and every other minute to make sure Odim or Kip hadn't come in\
  \ early.</p> \n    <p>What had happened? From the mess, it was clear most of the\
  \ Banshees had been present, Gedrak included. Blit found what looked like an adamantine\
  \ ring from a mail shirt. Gedrak certainly didn't own anything like that, nor was\
  \ Allyra wearing anything so expensive. So who else had been here? Someone from\
  \ outside the Puddles, certainly—and not the watch either.</p> \n    <p>And where\
  \ did Allyra come in? She was a damned <i>waitress</i>!</p> \n    <p>With two bodies\
  \ to cart, he'd need more than his bronze liquid. He drank the bronze and then added\
  \ another extract that tasted like leather. His muscles bulged with the added strength\
  \ the second elixir gave him, and he put one body on each shoulder like they were\
  \ rolls of carpet.</p> \n    <p>As he shifted Allyra's weight, she cried out again.\
  \ Blit's breath caught in his throat. What would Odim and Kip do if they saw her\
  \ alive? And bandaged! Cayden's breath, what was Blit thinking? At best, they'd\
  \ kill her immediately. More likely, they'd kill Blit too.</p> \n    <p>What he\
  \ <i>wanted</i> to do was run past the goons and disappear, but that would make\
  \ them more suspicious, not less. He'd just have to hope they didn't notice her.\
  \ He shifted Allyra to better hide her bandage and then stepped outside.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Job's done,\" he muttered, facing the street rather than the goons so\
  \ his head would block any view of Allyra's stomach.</p> \n    <p>Odim grunted and\
  \ left to check on Blit's work. Kip remained outside. He still rubbed his arm. He\
  \ winced whenever he moved it too much, but the bandage wasn't very bloody—a blunt\
  \ wound.</p> \n    <p>\"What are you looking at?\" Kip growled.</p> \n    <p>Blit\
  \ looked away. Allyra breathed raggedly against his ear. Even with his extra strength,\
  \ he felt like her breaths were rocking his whole body. Gods, he needed to get out\
  \ of there.</p> \n    <p>\"Looks good,\" Odim said behind them.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Great,\" Blit said, relieved. \"I'm gone.\"</p> \n    <p>He was several steps away\
  \ when Odim said, \"Hold it!\"</p> \n    <p>Blit turned around slowly, expecting\
  \ knives out and an inevitable chase—one he would almost certainly lose, even with\
  \ his vials. When he saw Odim holding only a coin pouch, he let out the breath he'd\
  \ been holding.</p> \n    <p>\"You're jumpy tonight, Patch Man.\"</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-ThePatchMan-Allyra.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Allyra's job at the Puddlegut is more complicated than it seems.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>\"Can you blame me?\" Blit managed. \"You two are spooked as\
  \ hell.\"</p> \n    <p>Odim and Kip gave each other a look. \"But why are you skittish?\
  \ You don't know nothing about it. Do you?\"</p> \n    <p>A hundred lies darted\
  \ through Blit's head, each one worse than the last. Anything he said would make\
  \ them question him more, make them doubt.</p> \n    <p>So he didn't say anything.\
  \ He grabbed several vials, downed all of them at once, and then walked toward the\
  \ goons.</p> \n    <p>Odim and Kip stepped back involuntarily. \"What <i>do</i>\
  \ you know, pinhead?\" Odim said, a familiar look of disgust on his face. \"Did\
  \ you see something in there?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nothing.\" The extracts began taking\
  \ effect. He no longer walked toward them, but floated. Impressively, they stood\
  \ their ground (though probably Blit was just less intimidating than he thought\
  \ he was). He reached out for the coin pouch. As he touched it, the pouch melted\
  \ into his hand and disappeared—the best kind of magic trick, what with it being\
  \ actual magic.</p> \n    <p>Odim and Kip gasped and jumped back (finally—what did\
  \ it take to frighten some people?).</p> \n    <p>Blit said, \"Just doing my job,\"\
  \ and before they could ask any more questions, he flew up over the rooftops and\
  \ into the night.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ was shaking when he got home. He'd dumped the Banshee corpse on Wallow Lane, then\
  \ carried Allyra inside his crumbling hovel—all invisibly of course, but his nerves\
  \ couldn't take much more of this. He was an alchemist, dammit. He shouldn't even\
  \ have to <i>spell</i> \"skullduggery.\"</p> \n    <p>The night was using up his\
  \ extracts faster than most, and he wasn't finished yet. Allyra was still unconscious.\
  \ He'd thought about taking her to the Puddleglut and leaving her there, but if\
  \ they didn't already know about her secret life as a goon-hammer, then he might\
  \ be betraying her. Besides, he was too low on extracts to get her there safely.\
  \ Instead, he decided to go to the Puddleglut himself and ask for help.</p> \n \
  \   <p>He downed a vial that scratched his throat and filled his nose with the scent\
  \ of lemongrass. In the mirror—a shattered, grubby thing that he kept only for this\
  \ purpose—he watched as his hellish features disappeared. His horns sank into his\
  \ head. His feet became smaller, with five pink toes, while his digitigrade heels\
  \ sank to the ground and his scales became a pair of woolen breeches. His skin kept\
  \ its amber cast (nothing's perfect), but he looked more human than most people.\
  \ Good enough for what he needed to do, at least.</p> \n    <p>He walked to the\
  \ Puddleglut—couldn't afford using his faster formulae, in case his night with the\
  \ Banshees wasn't over yet. The pub door hung open as usual, but inside was dark\
  \ and quiet. Blit sniffed the air detecting nothing unusual. He patted his cloak\
  \ to reassure himself that he had vials to spare, and stepped inside.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Of course, the dark didn't hinder a hellspawn. To him, the bar looked exactly\
  \ as it had when he'd been there last, sans people. No sign of a struggle even.\
  \ Everyone was just... gone.</p> \n    <p>He searched behind the bar. Everything\
  \ was there, even the cashbox and a half-empty bottle of Qadiran cider. The shrine\
  \ to Cayden Cailean on the back wall smelled of melted paraffin, but the wicks were\
  \ cool to the touch. They'd left some time ago, then—but why? And why in such a\
  \ hurry that they didn't even close the door?</p> \n    <p>The door to the back\
  \ room stood open a crack. Maybe he'd find some clues in there. He pushed his way\
  \ inside and hissed through his teeth. He'd expected some kind of office, or a small\
  \ bedroom for the barkeep. Instead he found a gods-damned Caydenite cleric revival\
  \ tent. Much had been removed, but there were still stoles, tunics, and a single\
  \ greave, most of which bore the religion's distinctive ale mug. No less than three\
  \ Placards of Wisdom hung on the walls, two of them with texts Blit had never seen.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Who the hell are these people?\" The room had been emptied in a hurry,\
  \ but there were loose pieces of paper lying around. Notes. Most made no sense,\
  \ but a couple of them were enlightening. The first of these was a sketched-out\
  \ organizational chart with Gedrak's name near the top, a question mark above him,\
  \ and names Blit knew all too well beneath: Odim, Kip, Sidro, Alver, and half a\
  \ dozen other Banshees.</p> \n    <p>The other note bore no names, but the dates\
  \ and times on it matched Blit's visits to the Puddleglut exactly. If he had any\
  \ doubts they were about him, the most recent date was the previous Starday—the\
  \ last time he'd been there—and next to it the words: \"Scared him off?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>He crushed the note in his hand. All this time, Allyra had used him. The\
  \ Puddleglut was some kind of Caydenite spy house, and Blit was one of their sources.\
  \ Gods, he was such a fool!</p> \n    <p>He patted his pockets, looking for something\
  \ that would destroy the whole place, when he caught a whiff of oil and smoke and\
  \ realized someone else had the same idea.</p> \n    <p>While he was still inside.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Blit bolted out of the back room, and a wave of heat blasted him in the\
  \ face. Smoke poured into his lungs until he couldn't stop coughing.</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ between coughs, he caught the scent of alchemist's fire mixed with the smoke.\
  \ Whoever had done this wanted it done fast and right. There was no time. He ran\
  \ to the back, a pair of vials already in his hands. He swallowed the extracts by\
  \ the time the first explosion rocked the pub. He burst out of the door at supernatural\
  \ speed, not caring whether anyone could see him or if the arsonists were still\
  \ around. He guzzled his last invisibility extract and ran straight home.</p> \n\
  \    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Blit slammed the door behind\
  \ him and leaned against it. His hands wouldn't stop trembling. He felt like he\
  \ couldn't get enough oxygen.</p> \n    <p>What the hell was happening? First the\
  \ dead guard, then Allyra, now the whole Puddleglut had gone up in flames. The incidents\
  \ were related—they had to be. <i>Think, Blit, think!</i></p> \n    <p>The Banshees\
  \ had killed a member of the city watch. But that hadn't scared them as much as\
  \ whatever had happened with Allyra. Had they been meeting with their boss, the\
  \ mysterious question mark above Gedrak's name on the Caydenites' notes? Had Allyra\
  \ stumbled onto something?</p> \n    <p>And then who had burned down the Puddleglut?\
  \ Were the Caydenites covering their tracks or the Banshees? Or someone else?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Who the hell are you?\" said a voice.</p> \n    <p>Blit squinted in\
  \ a sudden glare. Allyra stood ten feet away from him, lantern in one hand and warhammer\
  \ brandished in the other. \"Where am I? Why am I here?\"</p> \n    <p>Blit cocked\
  \ his head to the side. \"Allyra, it's me.\"</p> \n    <p>Her eyebrows knit in confusion.\
  \ \"I don't know you. How do you know my name?\"</p> \n    <p>Right. His alchemical\
  \ disguise was still in effect. \"I'm Blit,\" he said, as he looked for a formula\
  \ that would cancel the extract's effect.</p> \n    <p>\"Blit?\" She lowered the\
  \ hammer and stepped forward. \"You look... wrong.\"</p> \n    <p>That wasn't the\
  \ word he would have used. \"It's a disguise. Watch.\" He drank the vial he'd found.\
  \ He knew it was working by the way her lips turned upward.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, thank\
  \ the Drunk. How did you...?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Become more human?\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ nodded.</p> \n    <p>\"Alchemy.\" He could tell by her expression that this surprised\
  \ her, but only briefly. No doubt she was piecing together other clues she knew\
  \ about him. Well, at least she didn't know everything. \"Wait.\" He looked her\
  \ up and down. \"How are you okay? When I left, you were half dead.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>She put a hand on her stomach. \"I'm not great, but yeah, okay. Blit, I'm...\
  \ not a waitress. I mean, I am, but I'm also a—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Caydenite.\" Blit\
  \ snarled. Of course, she'd healed herself. All the revelations of the last hour\
  \ came rushing back. \"How long have you been using me to spy on the Banshees for\
  \ you?\"</p> \n    <p>Allyra's face turned to utter shock. \"Blit, I haven't been\
  \ using you!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, no?\" He marched toward her, taking joy in the\
  \ fact that she seemed afraid of him. \"What about the notes I found in the Puddleglut?\
  \ ‘Scared him off?' one said. Was that your handwriting or did you dictate that\
  \ one?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The Puddleglut? What were you...?\" Her face became serious.\
  \ \"Blit, you don't understand.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ha! If there's <i>one</i> thing\
  \ I understand, it's betrayal. It's my fault, really. Suspicion should be my normal\
  \ response to someone actually wanting to listen to me, you know? I can't believe\
  \ I bought your act.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Gods, Blit, no!\" She dropped the hammer with\
  \ a crash and put her head to her hand. \"I'm so sorry. That's not at all—\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Really, I should <i>thank</i> whoever burned down the Puddleglut. It\
  \ would've been a waste of materials for me to do it. You know, I—\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Blit, shut up!\" She put a hand on his cheek. The shock of human touch was the only\
  \ reason he obeyed, really. \"Someone torched the Puddleglut?\"</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ nodded. \"While I was in it, no less.\"</p> \n    <p>She moved quickly, dousing\
  \ the lantern and grabbing her hammer and a cloak. \"We have to get out of here.\
  \ <i>Now!</i>\"</p> \n    <p>\"What? Nobody knows you're here, and who would bother\
  \ with me?\" A quiet voice nagged that he'd been afraid of just that a short while\
  \ ago, but he brushed it away. \"I want to know how long you've been playing me.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Blit, really, I—\"</p> \n    <p>She was interrupted by a knock on\
  \ the door. It was so heavy that paint chips leapt off the doorframe and dust fell\
  \ from cracks in the wall.</p> \n    <p>\"Patch man!\" shouted a gruff and all-too-familiar\
  \ voice. \"It's Gedrak. Open up!\"</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Coming\
