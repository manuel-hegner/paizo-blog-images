  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, December 13, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Despite their intended role as\
  \ a secondary feature, there's no doubt that factions have become a central component\
  \ of <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>—\
  so much so that we made them a key fixture of the overarching narrative in Season\
  \ 9, the Year of Factions' Favor. This season's a time for us to explore these factions'\
  \ ongoing stories, and as is true for any story, the characters grow, change, and\
  \ sometimes disappear entirely. In the past, we've handled most of these changes\
  \ at the beginning of a new season. Not so in Season 9. We've been working toward\
  \ a mid-season update in our storyline for some time, and I'd like to share three\
  \ major developments with you.</p> \n    <h2>Liberty's Edge</h2> \n    <p>Back in\
  \ July 2017 we launched the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz1?Leaders-in-Liberty\"\
  >Leaders in Liberty contest</a>, inviting you to send us a backstory for a rising\
  \ star in the Liberty's Edge faction. We were blown away by the submissions and\
  \ posted our top five for you to vote for your favorite. With your help and that\
  \ of the winning contestant Sam Sampson, we formally introduced Karisa Starsight\
  \ into the campaign. Most recently we shared that Liberty's Edge was in need of\
  \ an interim leader, with the two leading candidates being Karisa Starsight and\
  \ the halfling Tamrin Credence. Once again, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk9d?Leaders-in-Liberty-2\"\
  >you the public cast your votes</a> and selected Tamrin Credence!</p> \n    <p>Three\
  \ things in particular struck me over the course of these contests. First, these\
  \ are a lot of fun, and I'm interested in exploring ways to include more contests\
  \ in the future. Second, the voting between Karisa and Tamrin was quite close, showing\
  \ that both of these figures really gained traction with sizeable portions of the\
  \ audience. Third, the commentary (in-character and out) in the discussion threads\
  \ provided a great insight into why each of the candidates resonated and what you\
  \ hoped to see in the future. What was one of the most common suggestions? Co-leadership.\
  \ Although I anticipate Tamrin will be the leader of the Liberty's Edge faction,\
  \ it's clear that Karisa should play an active role going forward (much as Aaqir\
  \ al'Hakam and Guaril Karela share management despite the former being the final\
  \ arbiter).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0718E-TamrinCredence.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0718E-TamrinCredence_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Kenneth Camaro</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Either\
  \ way, expect to see the next installation of the Liberty's Edge story in May at\
  \ PaizoCon 2018!</p> \n    <h2>Scarab Sages</h2> \n    <p>The Scarab Sages came\
  \ into being almost four years ago, formally replacing the old Osirion faction in\
  \ mid-2014. The premise was pretty simple: recover a host of gemstone artifacts\
  \ that store the memories of long-dead sages, recruit strong minds to host these\
  \ memories, and revive the ancient order of Jeweled Sages. Ever since the Destiny\
  \ of the Sands series in Season 5, PCs have exceled at doing just that, and I have\
  \ no doubt that we could continue doing so for another four years. While some of\
  \ our narratives benefit from such extended arcs, we decided that the Scarab Sages'\
  \ story would be strongest with a decisive end. How it ends—whether the Jeweled\
  \ Sages thrive as an ally of the Society or whether they fade into obscurity—depends\
  \ on you. Matt Duval played such an instrumental role in writing earlier Scarab\
  \ Sages scenarios that I invited him back to bring things to a close in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9wer?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-907-Salvation-of-the-Sages\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</a>. Be sure to check those reporting\
  \ checkboxes—our hope is to have a canonical outcome by the end of Season 9.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So what does this mean for the future? At the end of Season 9, the Scarab\
  \ Sages faction retires, and current members will need to change to a different\
  \ faction. As noted on page 28 of the current <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</a>, \"any characters affected by faction\
  \ retirement can retain any faction-based benefits but can't purchase new items\
  \ specific to the retired faction. Such characters must choose a new faction at\
  \ no cost prior to receiving credit for any further scenarios.\" In addition, members\
  \ of the Scarab Sages faction will keep any benefits earned on Scarab Sages Faction\
  \ Journal Cards, but once the faction's retired, they won't be able to fulfill further\
  \ goals.</p> \n    <p>In the meantime, I encourage you to experience the Scarab\
  \ Sages storyline in full in case you've missed a few adventures. Keep in mind that\
  \ the Scarab Sages was also the first faction whose storyline we incorporated directly\
  \ into the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/acg\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a>,\
  \ specifically in Season 3, the Season of Plundered Tombs. In chronological order,\
  \ these are:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-12: Destiny\
  \ of the Sands, Part 1: A Bitter Bargain</em> (Tier 1-5)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #5-15: Destiny of the Sands, Part 2: Race to Seeker's Folly</em>\
  \ (Tier 1-5)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-16: Destiny of the\
  \ Sands, Part 3: Sanctum of the Sages</em> (Tier 3-7)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #6-04: Beacon Below</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #6-19: Test of Tar Kuata</em> (Tier 3-7)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-04: The Ironbound Schism</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-11: Ancients' Anguish</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Adventure Card Guild, Season 3</em> (Especially #3-3: In Search of a Sage\
  \ and #3-4: Tomb of the Godless Host)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #8-17: Refugees of the Weary Sky</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #9-04: The Unseen Inclusion</em> (Tier 1-5)</li> \n     <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</em> (Tier 7-11)</li>\n    </ul>\
  \ \n    <p>So that might leave a few of your characters in need of a new faction.\
  \ Sounds like you'd appreciate a new option, right?</p> \n    <h2>The Concordance\
  \ of Elements</h2> \n    <p>Pathfinder Society's factions cover a huge range of\
  \ character concepts quite nicely, particularly for PCs who are interested in history,\
  \ knowledge, and exploration. That said, the campaign's always struggled to accommodate\
  \ one particular class: druids. I've struggled with this issue, as on most days\
  \ the Pathfinder Society's interest in nature boils down to \"that thing full of\
  \ brambles and mud that we cross to reach the abandoned temple.\" Sure, the Society\
  \ has its share of botanists, zoologists, and ecologically minded adventurers, yet\
  \ that's not something that lends itself to sustainable storytelling. On top of\
  \ that, there are already enough druid circles in the setting that we didn't want\
  \ to add just one more to the multitude. No, we wanted something that we could make\
  \ our own and have it stand out.</p> \n    <p>As we were planning out Season 8,\
  \ we realized we had an excellent opportunity to introduce just such a group, an\
  \ extraplanar operation known as the Concordance of Elements (or just the Concordance\
  \ for short). The Concordance isn't your typical \"nature for nature's sake\" druid\
  \ faction. Instead, it seeks out elemental imbalances, planar breaches, and extraordinary\
  \ natural phenomena to close breaches, reestablish natural order, and study the\
  \ multiverse in all its splendor. To fail in this is to allow rampant growth to\
  \ choke out all life, stand by as one plane's power snuffs out the life of another,\
  \ or watch as the cosmos spins out of alignment. While there are plenty of ways\
  \ in which this fulfills the classic Nature Character's desires, I think you'll\
  \ find that the Concordance tends to slap druids and fey on the wrist with some\
  \ regularity. We're excited to announce the Concordance faction, and a blog by Linda\
  \ Zayas-Palmer should appear on paizo.com a little later talking about the Concordance\
  \ in more detail.</p> \n    <p>In the meantime, know that we'll be making the faction\
  \ a playable option early in 2018, complete with new faction traits, a new Faction\
  \ Journal Card, and a faction-related scenario due out in February. As has been\
  \ the case with the introduction of other factions, characters will have the option\
  \ to switch to the Concordance without spending any Prestige Points.</p> \n    <p>John\
