  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, August 7, 2009</p> <a href=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenCon2008P1_500.jpeg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenCon2008P1_180.jpeg\"\
  \ align=\"right\" border=\"0\"></a> \n    <p>Here at Paizo, we have many different\
  \ levels of experience with cosplay, from Art Director Sarah Robinson's complete\
  \ disdain for anything other than the latest trendy fashions (seriously, the woman\
  \ has every purse in the western hemisphere) to Jason Bulmahn's days playing a lumbering\
  \ oaf at midwestern renaissance fairs (how little things change!), to Wes Schneider\
  \ who may, in fact, <i>be</i> a Pokémon. But the one thing we all have in common\
  \ is that we <b>love</b> the idea of people dressing up as Pathfinder characters.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p>We never thought such things were possible until we met Tiffany,\
  \ a real-life cleric of Desna, at last year's Gen Con, and thanks to her we're now\
  \ convinced that anything is possible. Which is why I'm filled with glee to announce\
  \ the <b>First Annual Pathfinder Gen Con Cosplay Contest!</b></p>\n    <p> </p>\n\
  \    <p>Here's the deal: At some point during Gen Con, you show up to the Paizo\
  \ booth dressed in your best Pathfinder costume (faction shirts and other official\
  \ Paizo merch don't count). We should stress that we're looking for monsters and\
  \ characters with obvious ties to our world itself, not generic cosplayers (that\
  \ wizard hat could be from anywhere), or people dressed up like actual Pathfinder\
  \ books (very clever) or members of the Pathfinder staff (the world already has\
  \ one James Jacobs, and one is enough for everybody). In addition to drawing a crowd\
  \ of happy Paizoites, the contestants will have their pictures taken. Those folks\
  \ with the best costumes, as decided by us, will end up on the Paizo blog once we\
  \ return from Gen Con, at which point we'll allow the posters on our messageboards\
  \ to pick their favorite. What criteria that mad and merry crew will use is anybody's\
  \ guess—creativity? recognizability? skin-to-clothing ratio?—but whoever they select\
  \ as the best Pathfinder cosplayer will walk away with <b>fifty dollars in store\
  \ credit!</b></p> \n    <p>So what are you waiting for? Get out that sewing machine\
  \ and hot glue gun, send your party members on a run for foam rubber and acrylics,\
  \ and show us what you're made of!</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>James Sutter <br>Editor</p>\
