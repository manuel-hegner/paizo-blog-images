  \ href=\"/products/btpy9hdt\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Occult Realms</em></a>\
  \ details several occult locations in Golarion that are ripe for adventure! Here's\
  \ a look at each location discussed in the book's second chapter:</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <h3>Center for Psychogenic Advancement</h3> \n      <p>This remarkable\
  \ university is one of the crown jewels of Hermea's capital city of Promise. Through\
  \ careful study, experimentation, and practice, the center's faculty and staff hope\
  \ not only to unlock the secrets and powers of the mind, but also to discover the\
  \ catalyst for a new stage of human development. Critics believe that graduates\
  \ use their honed psychic abilities to spy on other Hermeans; the center's administration\
  \ firmly denies this accusation. The PCs can find the center's mysteries unravel\
  \ before them while probing the disappearances of people with psychic talents across\
  \ the Inner Sea region. The truth is that the missing individuals were invited to\
  \ attend classes at the center. Some have even since reappeared, but their memory\
  \ of the time they spent missing is altered, leaving the PCs to discover what is\
  \ exactly going on and why.</p> \n      <h3>Denebrum</h3> \n      <p>Lurking deep\
  \ in the Darklands region of Orv, Denebrum is home to the neothelids, a species\
  \ as ancient as the Vault Builders who supposedly created that forbidding realm.\
  \ How the neothelids came to exist here is a mystery, but legends suggest they burrowed\
  \ into this area from beyond the Dimension of Dreams, or perhaps even from the nightmare\
  \ realm of Leng. Whatever the truth, the neothelids continue to meticulously carry\
  \ out numerous complex plots designed to bring them to the pinnacle of power so\
  \ that they might rule all of Golarion, as they believe is their right. PCs can\
  \ find themselves entangled in the neothelids' plotting when investigating a squabble\
  \ in Korvosa among the Sczarni, various professional guilds, and other legitimate\
  \ organizations. All threads lead to a vicious worm that walks, who leads them deep\
  \ beneath the surface to neothelids whose plans to subjugate Korvosa have been in\
  \ motion for centuries.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurb180\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \    <h3>Grand Sarret</h3> \n      <p>Once the summer retreat of Vudrani nobility,\
  \ most believe that this remote island in Jalmeray is abandoned, its palace in ruins.\
  \ In truth, the carefully maintained air of disrepair cloaks one of Golarion's most\
  \ elite educational institutions: the Conservatory, where spies are trained to infiltrate\
  \ the world's courts, governments, and other centers of power. After graduation,\
  \ the spies are provided with cover identities as nobles, bards, seneschals, and\
  \ consorts, and sent forth to further Jalmeray's interests through covert means.\
  \ PCs can get an introduction to the Conservatory when investigating a traveling\
  \ sage who visits Magnimar, calling himself the Master of the Third Eye, after a\
  \ woman complains that he has taken control of her husband's mind.</p> \n      <h3>Temple\
  \ of the Sunken Sign</h3> \n      <p>In the drowned swamps and jungles of the Sodden\
  \ Lands, hidden among the ruins of a complex built by the ancient Ghol-Gan cyclopes,\
  \ the Temple of the Sunken Sign twists the legacy of the lost kingdom of Lirgen\
  \ with the insanity of an ancient cult of Azathoth. The maddened sect of Saoc Brethren\
  \ who dwell here point their telescopes toward the stars, work corrupt rites, and\
  \ wait to become one with their unspeakably alien patron. On the streets of Sothis,\
  \ a crazed seer babbles about the coming of the darkness, and her family asks the\
  \ PCs to investigate how a sedate, well-respected member of Osirian society became\
  \ a wild-eyed prophet after participating in an archaeological expedition to the\
  \ Sodden Lands.</p> \n      <h3>Vergan Forest</h3> \n      <p>Fifty years ago, this\
  \ dark and musty region served as cover for guerilla forces loyal to the powerful\
  \ wizard Razmir while he conquered the region—and mercilessly slaughtered those\
  \ who refused to bend their knees. Today, those unquiet souls infuse the Vergan\
  \ Forest with latent psychic power with which is primary inhabitants must contend.\
  \ Razmiri dissidents and anarchists alike now use the forest to hide from authorities,\
  \ but they are not alone; also lurking in the forest are driders, giant vermin,\
  \ assorted undead, and a terrible ancient power that could bring ruin upon the whole\
  \ region. A paranoid scholar in Thronestep hires the PCs to stop the ancient power's\
  \ escape from a cave deep within the forest. However, things are complicated when\
  \ it turns out that a band of rogues and their Razmiri prisoner already inhabit\
  \ the cave—and that the being's machinations may be too advanced to stop without\
  \ paying a terrible price.</p> \n      <h3>Zi Ha</h3> \n      <p>The samsaran nation\
  \ of Zi Ha, perched upon the remote peaks of one of Tian Xia's mountain ranges,\
  \ is an alluring mystery to scholars. To visitors, it is a place of serenity and\
  \ meditation, where one can gaze out on pristine vistas and discuss the mysteries\
  \ of reincarnation with one's samsaran host over a warm cup of tea. For the human\
  \ children of its residents, it is a reminder of the parents who cast them off in\
  \ order to contemplate their quest for enlightenment. When a powerful spellcaster\
  \ hires the PCs to escort her into the dangerous mountains of Zi Ha and help her\
  \ track the parents who abandoned her as an infant, the adventurers are unwittingly\
  \ drawn into a tragic knot of broken family ties and vengeance that endures across\
  \ lives and generations.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
