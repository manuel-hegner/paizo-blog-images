  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">On Tuesday, February 25th at\
  \ 6 p.m. Pacific, The Dragons and Things Network is beginning an all-new chapter\
  \ in the Dragons and Things actual-play saga. DaT: Vantam kicks off with a brand-new\
  \ storyline complete with new characters, new cast members, playing the new Pathfinder\
  \ 2e system, on a brand-new set, in a brand-new studio. There's just a lot of newness\
  \ happening here. For fans of the first DaT campaign following the Krag Krew, one\
  \ thing that won't change is the fantastic camaraderie we share with our fans as\
  \ we play one of the most incredible TTRPGs ever written. </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>We've come a long way from our hastily built set in\
  \ a friend's garage. The core of the show remains an awesome campaign and epic storytelling,\
  \ but DaT: Vantam is a serious upgrade for actual-play live streaming as a genre.\
  \ This new campaign achieves that not just with a compelling narrative and impressive\
  \ visuals, but by exploring a world in greater depth than any other show by telling\
  \ two concurrent stories set against the same immersive backdrop. Every Tuesday,\
  \ DaT: Vantam will feature a party of fledgling heroes looking to make it in a fast-paced\
  \ city brought to its knees by a magical disaster of terrifying proportions. Then,\
  \ each Friday, DaT: Vantam will focus on a tale of survival and intrigue as prisoners\
  \ in an underwater prison struggle to escape a facility crumbling around them as\
  \ a consequence of the very same disaster their surface counterparts attempt to\
  \ contain. While each story is a self-contained plotline that serves as a complete\
  \ experience on its own, fans able to watch both streams live will certainly appreciate\
  \ the way the two tales intersect. </p> \n     <p>While the spine of DaT: Vantam\
  \ remains epic storytelling, its heart remains the interaction between the fans\
  \ and the players. Joining a live stream gives every member of the audience a chance\
  \ to kick back, chat with the cast, hang out with DaT Family, and even affect the\
  \ game directly with their contributions. Send bonuses and buffs to the players,\
  \ or sow chaos with wild magic effects if you choose, there are a wide range of\
  \ options for joining in on the action. If you'd rather just chat, the community\
  \ is welcoming and vibrant, and the cast reads and responds to comments live on\
  \ the stream. </p> \n     <p>If you're looking for a new story to sink your teeth\
  \ into, DaT: Vantam is the perfect opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Every\
  \ stream runs for 3 hours, with a short break at the mid-point where you grab a\
  \ re-fill on snacks or watch some silly shorts. The Tuesday run begins on Feb 25th,\
  \ and the Friday run starts Feb 28th, all streams starting at 6 p.m. Pacific. If\
  \ you can't make the stream live, VOD episodes will be available shortly after the\
  \ LIVE episodes, and audio-only versions will be made available as well. Just tune\
  \ in to <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/thedatnetwork\" target=\"_blank\">twitch.tv/thedatnetwork</a>.\
  \ Welcome to DaT Family!</p> \n     <h2>Show Synopses and Cast Lists</h2> \n   \
  \  <h3>Dragons and Things: Vantam - Tuesdays</h3> \n     <p>A crew of adventurers-for-hire\
  \ thrust into the middle of a monumental disaster will decide how far they are willing\
  \ to go for the promise of profit. As the powerful try to buy the heroes' loyalty,\
  \ they are left wondering whether their job is to put fires out or start new ones.\
  \ When no good deed goes unpunished, and every bad deed offers pay, this crew must\
  \ ask themselves whether they are heroes or mercenaries. </p> \n     <p><b>Cast</b></p>\

  \ - Fridays</h3> \n     <p>On the day of their release, two former inmates and their\
  \ advocates find themselves trapped in an underwater prison in the wake of a terrible\
  \ disaster. With no way to access the surface and return to their disrupted lives,\
  \ they struggle to survive as the prison threatens to collapse and kill everyone\
  \ inside. Can they find a way out of an inescapable facility, and even if they can,\
  \ is there any place for them in a city that already took away their freedom once\
  \ before?</p> \n     <p><b>Cast</b></p> \n     <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"\
