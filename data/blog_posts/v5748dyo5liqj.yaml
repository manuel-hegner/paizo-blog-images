  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In celebration of the release of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9jbd\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heaven Unleashed</em></a>,\
  \ I wanted to take a moment as one of the biggest fans of Heaven on the Paizo development\
  \ staff to reveal a never-before-seen, behind-the-scenes peek at how exactly we\
  \ went about building the great mountain of Heaven!</p> \n     <p>As is often the\
  \ case at Paizo, we didn't build it all at once. For many years, we had dropped\
  \ hints and brief descriptions of different locations within it, or discussed it\
  \ in broad terms. While we had given the plane a very rough outline back in a book\
  \ called The Great Beyond, that was one of the first setting books we ever did,\
  \ and frankly we were still figuring a lot of things out back in those days and\
  \ had no concept yet just how important Pathfinder's setting would become. (To give\
  \ you a sense of how long ago that was: the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game didn't exist\
  \ yet, folks currently running the adventure paths hadn't even started freelancing\
  \ for Paizo, and Wes didn't yet have any stress-induced gray hair.) Since then,\
  \ we'd revisited the plane various times—for instance, I got to explore the Great\
  \ Library and Heathen Shore (Heaven's international district) in <a href=\"/products/btpy94r3\"\
  ><em>The Redemption Engine</em></a>—but we'd never sat down and really hashed out\
  \ a full outline of the plane.</p> \n     <p>While <a href=\"/products/btpy9jbd\"\
  ><em>Heaven Unleashed</em></a> is mostly a big book of cool encounters tied to Heaven,\
  \ it was important to us to finally give a comprehensive overview of the plane—\
  what the various layers are, who runs what, etc. So several of us sat down and brain-melded\
  \ to try and figure out how to weave existing canon and new stuff together to create\
  \ a framework for Heaven. There was plenty of pressure, for as Wes pointed out,\
  \ a well-designed Heaven ought to be just as cool as Hell, especially since they're\
  \ in many ways mirror reflections of each other. (Plus, it had always felt like\
  \ a shame to both of us that everyone reads Dante's Inferno, but not even hardcore\
  \ planar fans can be bothered to finish Paradiso...)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160420-Whiteboard_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The result was this whiteboard sketch, with each of\
  \ Heaven's seven's layers charted out. Here you can see our thoughts on the function\
  \ of each layer and which souls go where, as well as our metaphysical musings about\
  \ how the souls residing on certain layers \"face outward,\" others face inward,\
  \ and still others face beyond, toward Heaven's role in the multiverse. (We go down\
  \ all sorts of theosophical rabbit holes around here.) And of course, there are\
  \ the names of the layers, the identities and titles of the rulers of each layer,\
  \ which gods live where... all the basics you need to know as a scholar of Heaven\
  \ or just someone looking to petition the gods or kick some angelic ass.</p> \n\
  \     <p>You'll also notice a bunch of green boxes on the board. Those were for\
  \ those layers or rulers who hadn't been named or decided yet when I took this picture.\
  \ We've figured things out since then, of course, and I'm happy to say that I think\
  \ we achieved our goal of making Heaven just as interesting as its unholy sister\
  \ plane. But if you want to know the rest of the details... well, that's what the\
  \ book is for, now isn't it?</p> \n     <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Executive Editor</i></p>\
