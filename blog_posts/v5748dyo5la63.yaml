  date\">Tuesday, July 17, 2007</p> \n   <p>Another Origins Game Expo has come and\
  \ gone, and what a great time it was! We Paizo folk were there in force, with the\
  \ largest booth taking up the center of the exhibit hall. Thousands of fans stopped\
  \ by to check us out and pick up some of our newest products. Many got their shiny\
  \ new copies of <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7yqz\">GameMastery Module D1: Crown\
  \ of the Kobold King</a></i>, signed by none other than author Nicolas Logue himself.\
  \ We sold enough of the new <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiu\">GameMastery Item\
  \ Cards: Dragon's Trove</a></i> deck to nearly empty the hoard (don't worry, we've\
  \ restocked it for Gen Con). But the big winners at the show were the <i><a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy7uvm\">Combat Pad</a></i> and the <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wv9\"\
  >Critical Hit Deck</a></i>. We had trouble keeping these hot products on the shelf.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Visitors who stopped by our booth on Saturday and Sunday got a special\
  \ treat, as we had a few early print copies of <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpr\"\
  >Pathfinder #1</a></i> on hand for fans to flip through. I think you could hear\
  \ the \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" all the way across the exhibit hall.</p> \n  </blockquote>\

  \ than over at the delve. Hundreds of fearless gamers walked into the dungeons of\
  \ the Kobold King in hopes of scoring fabulous prizes from the Paizo treasure chest.\
  \ While every player walked away with at least one key to try his or her luck, many\
  \ met a gruesome end. All told, 88 characters were brutally cut down in the dungeon\
  \ (55 by yours truly... I guess I went a little kill-crazy). If you missed out on\
  \ your chance, you can always pick up <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7yqz\">Crown\
  \ of the Kobold King</a></i> (it should be arriving in game stores any day now)\
  \ or you can stop by our booth at Gen Con and try your hand at our new delve event\
  \ (based on <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiz\">GameMastery Module D2: Seven Swords\
  \ of Sin</a></i>). With a bit of luck, that delve will have an even higher body\
  \ count.</p> \n   <p>For more pictures, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/10052573@N04/\"\
