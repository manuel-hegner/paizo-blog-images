  date\">Wednesday, December 9, 2009</p> \n   <p>Comrades and Comradettes,</p> \n\
  \   <p>Much has happened here at Paizo since I last wrote. While here, I had the\
  \ privilege of watching Wayne Reynolds's iconic character sketches come in one by\
  \ one, and stood in the circle of other staff gaping and gawking. Surprisingly (or\
  \ not surprisingly?), nobody's favorite is the same. In my unartistic opinion, that\
  \ is simply a testament to the skill of our Mr. Reynolds (who caught the Firefly\
  \ pun?), who can capture six new and distinctive characters in a way that appeals\
  \ differently to everyone—player, GM, intern...</p> \n   <p>As for what I've been\
  \ working on, two jobs have demanded the majority of my time here. The first was\
  \ patchworking the freelance texts that are to be a part of our <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88rc\"\
  ><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a> into chapters, and then styling them to match our\
  \ Paizo house style.</p> \n   <p>An ongoing task has been the dreaded Rules Database—\
  something Wes has apologized for countless times. When it's finished, it'll be a\
  \ series of Excel spreadsheets that catalogues each and every monster, magic item,\
  \ feat, spell, trait, piece of equipment, prestige class, monster template, and\
  \ trap that has ever appeared in a Paizo RPG product (both in the 3.5 rules set\
  \ and our shiny new PFRPG rules set). Did I mention the \"each and every\" part?\
  \ It's still in the process and nowhere close to being edited—what with all the\
  \ other craziness people actually pay for taking up nearly every waking hour—but\
  \ eventually it should be something pretty cool.</p> \n   <p> I've also done a lot\
  \ of copyediting, a few development passes of elements for Kingmaker, and am now\
  \ working on a bit of Planet Stories styling. It's all very exciting!</p> \n   <p>Until\
  \ the next time, keep it classy, enjoy the playtests (the last two coming up soon!),\
  \ pick up the new Powers comic, listen to the Rush discography, and watch <i>Serenity</i>\
  \ four or five times.</p> \n   <p>Matthew Lund <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n  </blockquote>\
