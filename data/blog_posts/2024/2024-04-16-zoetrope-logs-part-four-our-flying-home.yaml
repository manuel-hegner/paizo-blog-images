             <div class="blog__paragraph__text" data-v-e19af2d6>
              <p>One of my favorite places aboard the&nbsp;<em>Zoetrope</em>&nbsp;was the menagerie, where I would tend to the flora and fauna we’d taken aboard temporarily for further study. Unfortunately, things were decidedly less peaceful this evening as I raced up the steps to the upper deck, pausing to catch my breath before a small blue creature scampered past me along the ship’s outer railing, giving me a dreadful start.</p>
              <p>“She’s still not eating, Baranthet.” Charikleia came around the side, gingerly navigating the narrow space between the railing and the&nbsp;<em>Zoetrope</em>'s menagerie. Through the structure’s glass walls—perfect for letting in natural light—I could see our other specimens settling in for the evening amid the lush vegetation, under ballast rocks, or near the drinking pond. The little blue creature, however, swiveled her enormous amber ears in my direction as Chari spoke, resolutely ignoring the seedcake in Chari’s hand.</p>
              <p>“Hmmm.” I leaned down and peered at our guest, who chirped plaintively at me in a way that sounded like speech. “Chari—”</p>
              <p>“I agree,” she said, already scribbling notes. “That sounded like language. Can you understand us, little one?”</p>
              <p>The creature surveyed us solemnly, then without warning sprang from the railing and scrambled through a window.</p>
              <p>I let out a rather undignified yelp of surprise and hustled to the nearest door, Chari following soon after. Dr. Pom was at the helm this evening (she was always a bit more alert at night), and the&nbsp;<em>Zoetrope</em>&nbsp;was well underway; we couldn’t have our small guest accidentally falling overboard!</p>
              <p>The tiny patter of paws overhead led us upstairs to the mess deck, where, sure enough, the creature perched in the doorway to Grefu’s kitchen, sniffing the air with a disappointed look.</p>
              <p>“Well now, who’s this?” Grefu turned from a simmering pot and looked from the creature to us. “I didn’t set a place for an honored guest.”</p>
              <p>She emitted the sound—a word?—again, but Grefu looked as nonplussed as the rest of us.</p>
              <p>“Well, it’s not Jotun or Thalassic,” muttered Chari, surely making a mental note for our records. Before I could reply, the creature shot between the legs of the chairs and dining table and tore back downstairs. Grefu shrugged and returned to his work as Chari and I gave chase.</p>
              <p>The creature was perched on a crate as we came downstairs to the storage area but looked almost disapprovingly at us before scrambling down the stairs to the next flight. We heard a “Goodness! What—?” from Dr. Pom as the creature chirped at her and continued down another level, then a clang a few seconds later. She must have already reached the engine room on the next deck down.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;“Hey; I need that!” called Ten as the creature emerged clutching a small gear in her hands. She chirped at them, placed the gear gently on the ground, and took off once more.</p>
              <p>“She’s very energetic,” I observed to Chari, pausing to catch my breath.</p>
              <p>“And she’s not speaking Surki either,” said Chari, who seemed unaffected by our unexpected evening exercise. “Oh no!”</p>
              <p>We heard a distant splash and ran down another level to find the creature sputtering and pulling herself out of the access pipe leading down to the aquatic deck. She looked rather affronted as Lythea swam up the pipe and broke the surface, inadvertently splashing a few droplets onto the creature’s head.</p>
              <p>“So sorry, little one,” our navigator said, holding out a hand. “How can we help?”</p>
              <p>The creature instead clambered up onto Chari’s arm, flicking water from her ears. She chirped again. It sounded so familiar! I was increasingly convinced that lyrical chirp was, in fact, a word in a language I’d heard before.</p>
              <p>“I’m going to stop for my notes before we go back up,” Chari called over her shoulder, turning down the hall toward the crew quarters. I followed her, thinking to peruse my own small collection and check again for any clues as to this creature’s identity.</p>
              <p>“Professor, is that you?” Telero opened the door at the end of the hall, emerging from the shuttle bay just as I stepped into my own room. “Hey, who’s this?”</p>
              <p>The creature, catching a glimpse of the darkening sky through the branches of the shuttle bay door, squawked and leapt from Chari’s shoulder to her head, climbing up one of her horns and chattering at Telero. He quickly closed the door behind him and approached slowly. “Hey there, it’s okay, friend,” he said. “You’re safe. What’s your name?”</p>
              <p>The creature blinked at him, then chirped that same familiar syllable.</p>
              <p>Telero frowned in confusion. “Gold?”</p>
              <p>I’d become distracted while opening the door to my own room, bemoaning the untidy stack of scrolls and maps I’d meant to organize the previous day, but I turned at this. “Wait, did you say—?”</p>
              <p>The creature leapt from Chari’s head and shot into my cabin, papers flying as she disappeared under my desk. I crouched at once to see her clutching my long-missing volume of&nbsp;<em>The Thrilling Tales of Spiridendra</em>&nbsp;(so that’s where it had gone!). She chirped once more.</p>
              <p>“She’s saying ‘gold’ in Fey,” Telero said, he and Chari crowding in behind me.</p>
              <p>“Of course,” I breathed, looking back up at Chari.</p>
              <p>“A marp!”</p>
              <p>“They usually communicate in both Common and Fey, but perhaps this one is too young,” I reasoned, reaching out for the book as she began to lick its gold embossing experimentally. “Wait, please! I’ll trade you.” I slowly reached into my pocket and withdrew a gold piece. “Would you like to return to the menagerie? We’ll make sure you’re well fed!”</p>
              <p>The marp reluctantly relinquished her grip, but cheered up when she grasped the gold piece with her small hands. We climbed back up to the menagerie, the marp riding on Chari’s shoulder and crunching happily.</p>
              <p>The rest of the crew gathered around to exclaim over our guest and her unique menu. (Ten dashed off and returned with an armful of metal scraps to see if the marp found anything else to her liking, but as you’ll see in Charikleia’s notes, gold remains the preferred meal.) As I looked around at my companions, the moonlight streaming through the menagerie’s glass dome, a wave of joy overcame me, as it has so often done on this journey—the joy of discovery, of reaching shared understanding, and of building communities. The joy of belonging.</p>
              <p>The&nbsp;<em>Zoetrope</em>&nbsp;hummed quietly under our feet, whisking us away to our next adventure.</p>

              <p>About the Author<br>
                Baranthet Zamendi cultivated his love of the natural world at a young age, enamored with his grandmother’s awe-inspiring tales of the legendary Wardens of the Wild. He briefly attended Almas University before returning home to rebuild Droon’s public library, eventually becoming its head archivist. His upcoming book on the crew of the&nbsp;<em>Zoetrope</em>&nbsp;and their search for the wardens is his first, but he’s already planning his next adventure.</p>
              <p>Support for Mr. Zamendi by<br>
                Simone D. Sallé is a senior editor at Paizo and has written for numerous Pathfinder and Starfinder books, including more of Baranthet’s tale in<em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>, the primal treatise and witch journals in&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Bounty #12: Under Pressure</em>. When she’s not extolling the virtues of the en dash, she enjoys playing as many narrative games as her schedule allows and wandering the woods with her Disreputable Dog.</p>

              <p>Good morning, explorers! While we’ve taken a look at the crew you’ll see throughout&nbsp;<em>Howl of the Wild</em>, we realized there’s one more character we still needed to introduce: the&nbsp;<em>Zoetrope</em>&nbsp;itself! This unique airship serves as a home to our eccentric crew as they search Golarion for the Wardens of the Wild and features its own onboard menagerie, darkroom, research deck, and aquarium for all their exploratory needs.</p>

              <p>It's hard to believe our foray through the Zoetrope logs is at a close. But this is just a taste of Baranthet’s story, and we hope that you’ll want to take part when&nbsp;<em>Howl of the Wild</em>&nbsp;releases next month. Look forward to seeing some more tidbits about all the creatures, options, items, and more coming in the book, and let us know what sort of expedition&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;characters are thinking about going on!</p>
              <p>But that, explorers, is a story for another day.</p>
