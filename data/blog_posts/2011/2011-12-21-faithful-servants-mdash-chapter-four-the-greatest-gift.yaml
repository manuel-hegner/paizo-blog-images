  \ <h1>Faithful Servants</h1>\n            <p>by James L. Sutter</p>\n          \
  \  <h2>Chapter Four: The Greatest Gift</h2>\n            <p>Salim slipped through\
  \ the pools of shadow cast by branches and shrubs, trusting to his robes to break\
  \ up his outline and make him invisible. Around him, the sounds of the night creatures\
  \ were sporadic and tense. Expectant.</p>\n            <p>Connell slid along beside\
  \ him, still wearing his peasant disguise. Salim had to give him credit—the eidolon\
  \ was surprisingly graceful. Ahead, the manor house stood huge and whitewashed at\
  \ the end of the drive, its windows cavernous and dark save for three in an upper\
  \ corner, which glowed with dim red light.</p>\n            <p>As welcome as the\
  \ shadows were in hiding their approach, Salim would have preferred to come during\
  \ daylight. Yet he had wasted too much time trying to convince Father Adibold that\
  \ Salim and Connell would do better alone than with his assistance.</p>\n      \
  \      <p>It was utterly stupid. The priest's little mob of peasants would likely\
  \ scatter at the first sign of a walking corpse, and those who stayed would be slaughtered.\
  \ Worse, if this Lord Mirosoy had advanced to making ghouls, then every farmhand\
  \ who fell would rise again shortly to add to his army.</p>\n            <p>The\
  \ old priest and his son might have been more useful—the man claimed to have some\
  \ magic yet, and the boy's armor was solid. Yet Salim had seen enough in the priest's\
  \ eyes to know that it wasn't worth it. For all that Adibold talked of the Pharasmin\
  \ Penitence, that hopeless splinter sect of ascetics and self-deniers, it wasn't\
  \ religious fervor that made Adibold cut himself, or so eagerly throw himself and\
  \ his only son into harm's way. It was grief for his dead wife. Perhaps even a desire\
  \ to join her early.</p>\n            <p>Salim understood that all too well. But\
  \ the boy still had plenty of years left, and suicidal warriors were a liability.</p>\n\
  \            <p>In frustration, Salim had even attempted telling the old priest\
  \ part of the truth: that Lord Mirosoy wasn't acting of his own accord, but rather\
  \ had been enchanted by a cursed magic item.</p>\n            <p>The priest would\
  \ have none of it. \"I've seen souls corrupted by a shiny coin, or a bit of bare\
  \ thigh. The nature of the temptation is unimportant.\"</p>\n            <p>At last,\
  \ once it became clear that even the prospect of killing a potentially innocent\
  \ man wasn't enough to dissuade the priest—\"sorting good from evil is the Lady's\
  \ job, not ours\"—Salim had given in and agreed to join them in their attack at\
  \ dawn.</p>\n            <p>Which is why he and Connell were out here in the dark,\
  \ with the sun still hours below the horizon.</p>\n            <p>Salim caught the\
  \ eidolon's eye and nodded. The eidolon had given him the layout of the house, and\
  \ they'd decided on the servants' entrance around the side rather than the grand\
  \ double doors that faced the drive. It was time to break with the road and circle\
  \ left.</p>\n            <p>Something shot out from the brush near Salim's feet.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Without thinking—because in combat, acting was always faster than\
  \ thinking—Salim drew his sword and slammed it down, pinning the scurrying shape\
  \ to the earth. The creature squeaked once and expired.</p>\n            <p>\"Mouse,\"\
  \ he whispered, and withdrew his blade, rodent still clinging to its tip. He started\
  \ to scrape it off against his boot, then stopped.</p>\n            <p>The thing's\
  \ ribcage was hollowed out, the flesh rotted away from tiny bones. Salim's sword\
  \ had spitted it neatly, yet its back legs still kicked feebly.</p>\n          \
  \  <p>Another tiny form catapulted itself from the bushes. Before Salim could move,\
  \ Connell leaped, springing forward with the grace of a cat and coming up an the\
  \ undead rat in his hands. The eidolon popped it into his mouth, bones crunching,\
  \ then looked back at Salim and smiled.</p>\n            <p>Perhaps the eidolon\
  \ would be more useful than Salim had expected. Connell swallowed and asked, \"\
  Scouts?\"</p>\n            <p>Salim nodded. It seemed Mirosoy wasn't totally without\
  \ defenses. He slipped the twice-expired mouse from his blade and ground it under\
  \ his boot heel before continuing on.</p>\n            <p>The servants' entrance\
  \ was unguarded. From the tree line, it was a solid hundred feet of open lawn to\
  \ the steps up to the back porch, and then the door. Salim covered it at a run,\
  \ body bent almost double, sword under his robes to avoid reflecting the moonlight.\
  \ Connell paced him. At the door, they paused for a moment, listening. When nothing\
  \ revealed itself, Salim nodded to Connell and thumbed the latch.</p>\n        \
  \    <p>Beyond lay a long hall, its wood-paneled walls lit only by the feeble shaft\
  \ of moonlight from the open door, quickly disappearing into utter black.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Salim smelled it first—the charnel stench of putrefaction. He thrust\
  \ out an arm to stop Connell, but the eager eidolon had already bounded into the\
  \ corridor.</p>\n            <p>A hand reached from the darkness.</p>\n        \
  \    <p>Salim moved. There was no time to let his eyes adjust, so he closed them\
  \ and let his ears and nose guide him past the struggling eidolon, deeper into the\
  \ dark.</p>\n            <p>Something rose up in front of him, grave-wet and stinking,\
  \ and he brought his sword out and down, feeling it cleave through cheese-soft flesh.\
  \ The thing gave a sigh and fell heavily into him, knocking him back into the wall\
  \ and what felt like a tall table or stool. His free hand closed on a smooth, heavy\
  \ object, and he brought it down hard on the thing in front of him, then spun to\
  \ skewer a new attacker to his right. Back toward the entrance, Connell shouted\
  \ something.</p>\n            <p>They were stuck. Salim might be able to keep this\
  \ up indefinitely, but there was no telling about the eidolon, and they needed to\
  \ move fast if they wanted to retain the element of surprise. Gritting his teeth,\
  \ Salim reached out and touched the goddess.</p>\n            <p>It was only a second,\
  \ but it was enough. The Lady of Graves flowed through him in a black rush, as grotesque\
  \ and violating in its own way as the creature putrefying on his feet. The energy\
  \ passed through him and into the blade of his sword, and cold steel flared with\
  \ ghostly incandescence, lighting the hallway.</p>\n            <p>There were only\
  \ three zombies, all dressed in the rotting finery that had probably once been the\
  \ best clothes the little town could offer. Two lay at Salim's feet, his sword having\
  \ severed the fragile magic that kept them animated. Down the hall, Connell struggled\
  \ with the third. The eidolon had dropped his disguise, and the long neck of his\
  \ true form snaked around the back of the zombie's futilely chomping head, wrapping\
  \ it like a boa constrictor. Long jaws locked around the undead creature's skull.\
  \ There was a twist and a pop, and the last corpse dropped to the floor and lay\
  \ still.</p>\n            <p>Salim looked down at his off hand. The object he held\
  \ was a stone bust of a young man, handsome in a vaguely arrogant and pupilless\
  \ sort of way. He held it out toward the eidolon. \"Your boss?\"</p>\n         \
  \   <p>Connell nodded.</p>\n            <p>Salim let the stone drop onto the corpse\
  \ it had clubbed, then wiped his sword on the tattered linen shirt. He gestured\
  \ down the hall.</p>\n            <p>\"You know the house,\" he said, \"but don't\
  \ leave my side unless I tell you to. Are we clear?\"</p>\n            <p>Connell\
  \ bobbed his head in what appeared to be genuine contrition and led the way deeper\
  \ into the house.</p>\n            <p>The manor was a shell. Though the pair passed\
  \ several well-appointed sitting rooms, with plush armchairs and walls of bookshelves\
  \ or big bay windows overlooking the moonlit grounds, the layer of dust at the entrance\
  \ to each argued that no one had bothered with them in some time. Connell avoided\
  \ the showy front half of the house, with its hangings and sculptures like the one\
  \ Salim had appreciated, and instead led them through a series of narrow, more utilitarian\
  \ corridors and staircases. Salim kept the light from the sword carefully banked\
  \ and focused by a fold in his cloak, yet nothing stirred in the dead house. If\
  \ it weren't for the slight but ever-present scent of decay, Salim might have thought\
  \ the place a summer home, packed away for storage while the lord was away.</p>\n\
  \            <p>At last they came to a door whose bottom edge was limned with the\
  \ same red light they'd seen from the road. The eidolon's barely existent lips moved,\
  \ and after a second Salim realized Connell was attempting to mouth the word \"\
  workshop.\" Salim nodded, and the eidolon turned the knob. The door swung open.</p>\n\
  \            <p>The room was large, the kind other lords might put to use as a ballroom\
  \ or formal dining room for parties. The huge set of windows they'd observed earlier\
  \ cast moonlight on the hardwood floor, yet this illumination was overpowered by\
  \ red lights that floated like swamp fire at the room's far end. The glow from these\
  \ flying lanterns was soft, and cast a flattering glow over the guests. No doubt\
  \ that generous lighting would have kindled more than one midnight romance among\
  \ the figures standing in a knot on the dance floor. Except that the guests were\
  \ dead.</p>\n            <p>As one, the corpses turned to observe the newcomers.\
  \ These, too, were still dressed in their funeral finery, some in the clothes of\
  \ peasants and merchants, others in simple shrouds marked with the symbol of Pharasma.\
  \ There was no pattern to their features—young and old, male and female all stood\
  \ with the awkward stances or constricted limbs of rigor mortis. A few had clearly\
  \ been magically preserved for their funerals, and even now were only beginning\
  \ to show the first signs of decomposition. Others were little more than fleshy\
  \ skeletons, their bones tied crudely together with twine where tendons had fallen\
  \ away.</p>\n            <p>Behind them all, a man stood in the center of the lights,\
  \ obscured from the chest down by a long dining table repurposed as a workbench.\
  \ Stacks of books and bubbling alembics cluttered every surface, along with stranger\
  \ implements and silvery surgical tools with whose use Salim was thankfully unfamiliar.\
  \ Though the man's face was the same as that on the stone head in the servants'\
  \ hall, this version was older, and so drawn and haggard as to resemble his zombie\
  \ subjects. Above the face, a black crown of long thorns and vertical spikes pierced\
  \ and pricked at his brow, holding back long, dark hair.</p>\n            <p>Lord\
  \ Mirosoy looked up from the book he'd been studying, yet his face barely registered\
  \ the newcomers' presence. With one finger still marking his place in the text,\
  \ he flicked his hand toward his uninvited guests.</p>\n            <div class=\"\

  \n            </div>\n            <p>\"Kill them,\" he said, and went back to reading.</p>\n\
  \            <p>The undead convocation shuffled forward.</p>\n            <p>Connell\
  \ growled—a deep, resonant rumble in surprising contrast to his usual excited tenor.\
  \ Three-fingered talons flexed.</p>\n            <p>\"No,\" Salim said, and put\
  \ a hand on the eidolon's shoulder.</p>\n            <p>Connell looked at him in\
  \ puzzlement, but Salim simply squeezed once and then released him. He stepped forward\
  \ and drew his sword.</p>\n            <p>The eidolon might be better in a fight\
  \ than he let on, but that wasn't the point. Salim had seen enough to tell that\
  \ these people were no ghouls, no vampire spawn or vengeful wraiths. These were\
  \ just farmers, their corpses denied the slow transition into the same dirt they\
  \ worked, forced to walk again at the whim of some spoiled lord.</p>\n         \
  \   <p>This wasn't a fight. Nor even an execution.</p>\n            <p>It was a\
  \ funeral rite.</p>\n            <p>The zombies approached, and Salim flowed like\
  \ a river to meet them.</p>\n            <p>The undead fought silently, and Salim\
  \ did the same, the only sounds the swirl of his robes and the wine-glass ring of\
  \ steel sliding free of flesh, punctuated by the thumps of corpses hitting the floor.\
  \ They moved to surround him, and he let them, whirling like a dervish, blade kissing\
  \ them lightly in the only blessing he knew how to give.</p>\n            <p><em>Rest</em>,\
  \ he thought as a child's body slid from his sword, crumpling to the fouled floor.\
  \ <em>Rest</em>.</p>\n            <p>And then he stood alone. Around him, the hardwood\
  \ was covered with bodies, splayed once more in the posture of death that, while\
  \ undignified, was so much more than they'd had a moment before. He looked down\
  \ at the corpses and wished them well.</p>\n            <p>At last they had Mirosoy's\
  \ attention. The lord looked at them as if dazed, struggling to understand the mess\
  \ of bodies staining his ballroom floor. \"Who are you?\" he asked.</p>\n      \
  \      <p>\"It's me, Master!\" The eidolon's voice was the whining, eager tone of\
  \ a dog hoping to regain its master's good graces. \"I've come back to help you!\
  \ Please don't be angry!\"</p>\n            <p>Mirosoy ignored his creation, instead\
  \ focusing on the dark-eyed man moving toward him, sword drawn. The lord's voice\
  \ didn't waver. \"And you?\"</p>\n            <p>\"Just a friend,\" Salim said.\
  \ \"One who's come to do you a favor.\"</p>\n            <p>His sword lashed out.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"<em>No!</em>\" Connell's scream was grief bordering on pain. The\
  \ eidolon leaped for Salim's back, talons outstretched, but it was already too late.\
  \ Salim's upward slash carved a shining arc toward Mirosoy's face.</p>\n       \
  \     <p>The blade missed the man's cheek by inches. With a tiny clink of metal\
  \ on metal, Salim's sword caught one of the black, curving thorns of the crown and\
  \ tore it free from the summoner's head. Mirosoy gasped at the sudden absence, or\
  \ perhaps at the furrows the embedded thorns carved through his scalp. The crown\
  \ fell to the table, and Salim followed it down, sword hilt gripped in both hands.\
  \ Blade met crown with Salim's full weight behind it.</p>\n            <p>There\
  \ was a flash that wasn't so much light as its absence, and a high, keening wail\
  \ that might have been a word, or a name. Then there were only two halves of a crown,\
  \ the metal seeming to shrivel and fold in on itself like burning briars. The newly\
  \ rusted slag clattered to the floor and lay still.</p>\n            <p>\"Master!\"\
  \ Connell was past Salim and gripping Lord Mirosoy's shoulders. The noble stood\
  \ with head hung on his chest, looking ready to fall face-first into his workbench.\
  \ Slowly, he raised his eyes. \"Connell?\"</p>\n            <p>\"Yes. Yes, Master.\"\
  \ The eidolon was weeping in earnest now, huge tears rolling down the reptilian\
  \ face. Above them, the rune on his forehead glowed brighter than ever. \"I'm back\
  \ now. I knew it was the crown that sent me away, not you. And now you're free!\"\
  </p>\n            <p>Mirosoy straightened, shrugging off the eidolon's steadying\
  \ hands. \"Yes. Well.\" He looked over to Salim. \"You do realize that's a priceless\
  \ artifact you just destroyed?\"</p>\n            <p>Salim marveled. Even half-dead\
  \ and surrounded by his own failure, the man exuded entitlement. Salim looked down\
  \ at the corpses on the floor, then back at the noble.</p>\n            <p>\"I'm\
  \ sure we can arrange an accounting of debts.\" His voice was soft.</p>\n      \
  \      <p>The summoner followed Salim's gaze down, then swallowed. \"No, that won't\
  \ be necessary. Clearly, the crown needed to be destroyed. You have my thanks.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>Salim inclined his head, unconvinced. Perhaps the crown wasn't\
  \ as responsible for these atrocities as Connell wanted to think. He opened his\
  \ mouth to say something—then stopped.</p>\n            <p>There was a new sound.\
  \ Salim saw the other two pick up on it as well: a low, muttering hum.</p>\n   \
  \         <p>Voices.</p>\n            <p>Salim moved swiftly to the window. Out\
  \ in the darkness, a line of torches snaked down the manor house's long drive.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Damn.\" Apparently Father Adibold was no longer interested in\
  \ waiting until dawn.</p>\n            <p>Salim turned back to Mirosoy. \"We need\
  \ to get out of here. In two minutes, their families\"—he gestured to the corpses\
  \ on the floor—\"are going to burn this place to the ground. And you're going to\
  \ let them.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Oh?\" The noble's lip twitched toward a sneer.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Salim raised his sword suggestively.</p>\n            <p>\"Oh,\"\
  \ Lord Mirosoy said again, this time with considerably less vigor. \"Well, you see,\
  \ that may be something of a problem.\" He raised a hand and gestured to his waist.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Oh, Master!\" Connell's voice was horrified. \"What have you done?\"\
  </p>\n            <p>And now Salim saw it. The various beakers and sealed containers\
  \ on the worktable didn't stand alone. Below the rumpled blouse, several thick tubes\
  \ snaked out of Mirosoy's abdomen and into the vessels and retorts on the table,\
  \ steady streams of black and red fluids cycling through them.</p>\n           \
  \ <p>Once more, the summoner ignored his servant and spoke to Salim. This time he\
  \ looked almost embarrassed.</p>\n            <p>\"The crown,\" he said. \"It had\
  \ several suggestions as to how I might...improve my longevity.\"</p>\n        \
  \    <p>\"Lichdom.\" Salim understood now why the man looked so hollow. He almost\
  \ spat, but stopped himself for fear of hitting one of the corpses. \"You were trying\
  \ to turn yourself undead.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Not me—the crown!\"</p>\n   \
  \         <p>Salim didn't care. \"Can you stop it? Reverse it?\"</p>\n         \
  \   <p>\"Almost certainly,\" Mirosoy said. \"But it'll take time. Days.\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>Behind Salim, the villagers were drawing closer. He could hear individual\
  \ voices in the rumble of the mob. \"We don't have days.\"</p>\n            <p>Lord\
  \ Mirosoy ventured a tentative smile, greasy and anxious. \"If you'll allow it,\
  \ my manor has certain defenses which—\"</p>\n            <p>\"No. You've done these\
  \ people enough harm already.\" Salim thought hard. \"Can you teleport? Move this\
  \ whole setup somewhere else with magic?\"</p>\n            <p>The noble grimaced.\
  \ \"My studies of late have been focused on other matters.\"</p>\n            <p>\"\
  Clearly.\" Salim sized up the various tubes that nosed into Mirosoy's clothing like\
  \ hungry worms. \"And I were to just pull those out?\"</p>\n            <p>\"Then\
  \ I would die. Likely in excruciating pain.\"</p>\n            <p>Works for me,\
  \ thought Salim, but he knew the eidolon would never stand for it. Besides, there\
  \ was no telling what sort of backlash the expiring spell might generate.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Beyond the window, dozens of feet crunched on gravel.</p>\n    \
  \        <p>\"I have a suggestion.\"</p>\n            <p>Both Mirosoy and Salim\
  \ turned to look at Connell. The eidolon was holding up a hand, as if waiting to\
  \ be called on. Salim nodded.</p>\n            <p>\"I have a suggestion,\" the eidolon\
  \ said again. With one three-fingered hand, he reached up and touched the amulet\
  \ hanging from his serpentine neck.</p>\n            <p>And then there was no Connell.\
  \ Only a second Mirosoy.</p>\n            <p>Salim understood immediately. \"Connell—\
  \" he began.</p>\n            <p>\"They're looking for the master,\" the eidolon\
  \ said firmly. \"If we give them one, maybe they'll go home.\"</p>\n           \
  \ <p>\"They're a mob,\" Salim pressed, throat suddenly tight. \"Even if they think\
  \ Mirosoy's gone, they'll burn this place down anyway.\"</p>\n            <p>\"\
  Then you'll have to stop them.\" The eidolon held out a hand. \"Goodbye, Salim.\
  \ Thank you.\"</p>\n            <p>The hand hung there, unmoving. After an eternity,\
  \ Salim stepped forward and took it. They shook.</p>\n            <p>Connell looked\
  \ to Mirosoy.</p>\n            <p>\"It's good to have you back, Master.\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>Then the eidolon walked out of the room and was gone.</p>\n    \
  \        <p>Silence reigned as the two men stood looking at the door where the second\
  \ Mirosoy had disappeared. Finally Salim spoke.</p>\n            <p>\"If you lived\
  \ a thousand years,\" he said slowly, \"you would still be unworthy of that love.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"What?\"</p>\n            <p>Salim's glance flicked sideways\
  \ to the noble.</p>\n            <p>\"That sacrifice. For you.\"</p>\n         \
  \   <p>Mirosoy seemed genuinely puzzled. \"It's an eidolon,\" he said. \"I made\
  \ it to protect me. When it's gone, I'll make another.\"</p>\n            <p>Salim\
  \ stared at him.</p>\n            <p>Outside, the crowd roared.</p>\n          \
  \  <p></p>\n            <center>\n             ∗∗∗\n            </center>\n    \
  \        <p></p>\n            <p>Three empty cups stood at parade rest on the wooden\
  \ table. A fourth, only halfway drained, stood before them, the officer addressing\
  \ its troops.</p>\n            <p>Salim took another drink. Around him, the familiar\
  \ buzz of the Clever Endeavor continued as usual, a dozen conversations that never\
  \ happened, between people who were never here and had never met. This time, no\
  \ one was looking at Salim. That suited him fine.</p>\n            <p>The wood between\
  \ his elbows was stained dark with spilled wine. Salim grimaced and set his mug\
  \ down on top of the splotch, but the cup wasn't quite big enough to hide it from\
  \ view.</p>\n            <p>Connell hadn't screamed. He hadn't made a sound at all.\
  \ By the time Salim reached the front door of the manor house, passing corpses which\
  \ lay motionless without the crown's animating touch, the worst was over. The bravest\
  \ of the mob was still hacking away with hoes and scythes, while others shouted\
  \ encouragement. At some point, someone tore away the amulet to reveal the eidolon's\
  \ true form, which Father Adibold loudly proclaimed a sign that the noble had been\
  \ a monster all along.</p>\n            <p>And then, finally, it was over. With\
  \ a last gasp from the crowd, the eidolon's body disappeared. Only the bloody stain\
  \ on the gravel drive remained.</p>\n            <p>Still giddy with the ease of\
  \ their victory, the mob might have indeed charged the manor, had Salim not chosen\
  \ that point to reveal himself. Stepping forth to address Father Adibold by name,\
  \ Salim announced that the evening's festivities were over, and that he'd dealt\
  \ with the rest of the lord's creatures himself.</p>\n            <p>A few of the\
  \ mob, drunk on blood, had yelled abuse. Salim raised his still-glowing sword, and\
  \ the newfound bravery dissipated. With Father Adibold at its head, the crowd turned\
  \ and made its way back toward town. In no time at all, Salim was alone on the driveway.\
  \ Just him and the stain Connell had left behind.</p>\n            <p>A single torch,\
  \ dropped by a villager, still sputtered in the dirt. Salim bent down and picked\
  \ it up. He looked up toward the manor window, where the red lights still played.</p>\n\
  \            <p>He could finish things. Mirosoy had perverted the corpses of innocents,\
  \ and attempted to do the same to himself. Salim had executed men for less. He could\
  \ set the torch against one of the tapestries in the entrance hall and let the whole\
  \ place disappear.</p>\n            <p>Instead, he had opened his hand and let the\
  \ torch drop.</p>\n            <p>And now he was here.</p>\n            <p>Salim\
  \ drank deep, draining the last of the mug. The wine at the bottom had an unpleasant\
  \ copper taste, and he looked down to see blood pooling there, mixing with the dregs.\
  \ He put fingers to his nose, and they came away red. He sighed.</p>\n         \
  \   <p>\"You have a terrible way of announcing yourself, Ceyanan.\"</p>\n      \
  \      <p>The creature across the table was neither male nor female, its pale skin\
  \ as smooth and inhuman as an alabaster statue. Behind its shoulders, great wings\
  \ that were half feathers, half shadow flexed once and then furled tightly in the\
  \ dingy confines of the bar. Gray cloth like funeral shrouds wrapped its waist and\
  \ chest.</p>\n            <p>Salim wiped his bloody upper lip with the back of his\
  \ hand. \"You want to tell me why you sent him to me?\"</p>\n            <p>The\
  \ angel smiled. \"What do you mean?\"</p>\n            <p>\"Don't play coy.\" Salim\
  \ put down his empty mug and leaned back, crossing his arms. \"Your boss deals with\
  \ more complex judgments than Mirosoy's little change of heart on a daily basis.\
  \ If you hadn't sent me in, the mob would eventually have made it through those\
  \ zombies and killed him, thus removing any reason for the Lady of Graves to take\
  \ an interest.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Many innocents would have died,\" the angel\
  \ observed.</p>\n            <p>\"And since when does your mistress give a flying\
  \ fig about that?\" Salim held up two fingers to the barman, who appeared almost\
  \ immediately with two more mugs.</p>\n            <p>\"Thank you,\" said Ceyanan,\
  \ \"but I don't drink.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Who said one of these was for you?\"\
  \ Salim pulled both drinks close.</p>\n            <p>The angel watched him. \"\
  You're an excellent hunter, Salim. Your skill does you credit. But you still have\
  \ much to learn.\" White lips twitched higher, the smile becoming almost beatific.\
  \ \"Connell did something very brave today. Out of love and devotion to his friend.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"Who didn't deserve it,\" Salim growled.</p>\n           \
  \ <p>\"Does it matter?\" The angel's big eyes bored into Salim's. \"Is the eidolon's\
  \ sacrifice any less admirable because of it?\"</p>\n            <p>Salim laughed\
  \ sharply.</p>\n            <p>\"Is that what this is all about? Teaching me to\
  \ take pride in my work, even if I don't have any choice in the matter?\" He showed\
  \ his teeth. \"Haven't I learned enough about duty? About <em>sacrifice</em>?\"\
  </p>\n            <p>Ceyanan shook its head, half sad, half bemused.</p>\n     \
  \       <p>\"Maybe not,\" it said at last. \"But don't worry. You will.\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Just what—\" Salim began.</p>\n            <p>But the angel was\
  \ gone.</p>\n            <p>Salim stared at the chair where the angel had been.\
  \ Then down at the stain on the table.</p>\n            <p>A mug in either hand,\
  \ he began to drink in earnest.</p>\n            <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> A brand\
