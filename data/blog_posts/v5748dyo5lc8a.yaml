  \ Robin D. Laws</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: The Snare</h2> \n   <blockquote> \n  \
  \  <p> Gad feels the roughness of the burr-oak's bark as its branch constricts tighter\
  \ around his ankles. Though he is upside down, blood rushing to his head, his face\
  \ retains its symmetry. A roguish skiff of stubble softens his jutting jaw. Gray-peppered\
  \ hair clings closely to his scalp. Blue eyes sear out at his elven captor.</p>\
  \ \n    <p> The tree that dangles him stands at the edge of the Shudderwood. Its\
  \ roots snake through a weed-choked pathway. A gang of firs bullies around it, swaying\
  \ and trembling to spite the windless air. The dry earth writhes with insect life;\
  \ biting ants and fat white grubs pulse to the demon harmonics of the nearby Worldwound.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The elf woman steps around him, squinting. From every angle, she assesses\
  \ the tautness of his muscles and the straightness of his bones. The tree reverently\
  \ moves its suspended prize, allowing her to circuit him easily. Her hair is an\
  \ autumn tangle, recalling the sprigs and leaves of a grapevine after harvest has\
  \ come and gone. The face is an arrangement of hardened planes: beautiful in theory,\
  \ unyielding in practice. Her war-garb is worn in, well kept. Slung across her back\
  \ are a long sword and an ornate, spiraled wand. A curved dagger accentuates a narrow\
  \ hip. </p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <table align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"\

  \ drawn lips, she clucks her tongue. \"Among your fellow humans, you are reckoned\
  \ handsome.\"</p> \n    <p>Gad smiles. \"I look my best right side up.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>She does not return the smile. \"You will serve,\" she says.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Will I now?\"</p> \n    <p>With a curt turn of the head, she gestures to her retinue,\
  \ gathered near a camouflaged ambush-screen on the treeline's edge. There are six\
  \ of them: all elves, all strikingly equipped, all poised with martial confidence.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Gad's weapons—short sword, main dagger, hidden back dagger, visible right\
  \ boot knife, concealed left boot knife—have all been plucked from him and lie in\
  \ a mocking pile near a clump of dying milkweed.</p> \n    <p>\"And who might I\
  \ be serving?\"</p> \n    <p>\"My name is none of your affair.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Maybe I like serving.\"</p> \n    <p>Elven features freeze. \"Do libidinous undertones\
  \ aid you with your fellows?\"</p> \n    <p>Gad finds it hard to shrug. \"A gentleman\
  \ never tells.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You do yourself no favors by provoking my disgust.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Again the urge to shrug. Gad resists. \"You wouldn't be press-ganging\
  \ me, would you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Humans have forgotten their purpose on this world.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Have we now?\"</p> \n    <p>\"You were born to brute labor. And\
  \ you shall perform it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't work cheap.\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ signals her men. The tallest, most sinewy specimen, glossy black hair trailing\
  \ behind him as he strides, leads the pack. Wrist shackles clatter in his compact\
  \ fist. He lowers his head as he approaches. \"Lady Dualal.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Good\
  \ Ethundel,\" she says, \"prepare the labor for transport.\" </p> \n    <p>Nothing\
  \ about Ethundel looks good to Gad.</p> \n    <p>Dualal turns to the tree trunk\
  \ and utters a command in archaic Elven. Its encircling branch loosens, releasing\
  \ Gad's ankles. Two members of the retinue stand below. They catch him, saving him\
  \ from a neck-breaking. Holding him tight, they wrestle him to his feet. Ethundel\
  \ claps the shackles on him.</p> \n    <p>\"I renew my objections to this wrongful\
  \ treatment,\" Gad says.</p> \n    <p>Ethundel smacks the back of the head.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A faraway expression settles on Dualal. \"If it is matters of justice\
  \ that concern you, wanderer, your indenture furthers the most righteous of causes.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>A white-blond elf grabs Gad by the right arm; an amber-blond elf by\
  \ the left. They march him onto a deer trail leading into the woods. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Care to specify?\" Gad asks.</p> \n    <p>\"Reclamation,\" Ethundel booms.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Gad ignores him, continuing to address the woman. \"Oh, so you're one\
  \ of <i>those</i> elves.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Impertinence will be harshly dealt with.\"\
  \ Dualal glides forward, to the middle of the marching order. </p> \n    <p>In the\
  \ wood ahead, branches grow twisted and tangled. Keening cicadas assault the ears.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Haven't you Reclaimers been plotting this for nine thousand years?\"\
  \ Gad braces for another hit but neither of his escorts seems interested in breaking\
  \ stride. Ethundel, who struck him before, has moved up to take point. With no one\
  \ to clout him, Gad continues: \"Ridding Golarion of humankind—and dwarves and orcs\
  \ and the rest—and taking it back? That's the dream, isn't it?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You are surprisingly versed in my race's lore,\" says Dualal.</p> \n    <p>\"Isn't\
  \ that a misleading way to put it?\"</p> \n    <p>\"What nonsense do you spout?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Don't most elves regard the idea of reclamation as lunacy?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She whirls to face him. His escorts freeze, shying back from her. Gad\
  \ stays cool.</p> \n    <p>Dualal sees this. She calms herself. A false, chill smile\
  \ comes reluctantly to her lips. When she speaks, it is more to her men than to\
  \ Gad. \"It has never been the time to reassert our ownership of this profaned and\
  \ polluted world.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Until now?\"</p> \n    <p>She gives him her back,\
  \ resuming her regal mien.</p> \n    <p>\"Have you considered, Dualal,\" he says,\
  \ \"that it's quite the coincidence?\"</p> \n    <p>\"What is?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  That after all the other Reclaimers have failed and been proven wrong, century after\
  \ century, that the great turning happens to dawn during your particular lifetime?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"But it will!\" blurts his amber-haired captor. \"The gem!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The elf's pallid skin turns whiter still, as he realizes he's stuck his\
  \ foot in it. He flinches.</p> \n    <p>\"Put a gag in that idiot's mouth,\" Dualal\
  \ commands.</p> \n    <p>Gad protests and resists as blond elf and amber elf stuff\
  \ a mildewy rag between his teeth. Inside, he is smiling. When an adversary thinks\
  \ him an idiot, half of his work is already done.</p> \n    <p></p>\n    <center>\n\
  \     ∗ ∗ ∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>The Reclaimers drag him deeper\
  \ into the forest. Gad is easier in a city than a wilderness, and this one is worse\
  \ than most. Clouds of bloodthirsty bugs roll in like morning fog. A caustic oil\
  \ drips from the leaves of certain trees. Unearthly murmurs, mimicking the groans\
  \ of the tortured souls, rise from rills and meadows. Life is too strong in the\
  \ Shudderwood. So strong that it is also death, a rancid cycle of birth and devouring.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>A day and a night pass. They camp briefly, giving Gad four hours\
  \ of sleep at best. The elves, rotating watches, get less. They feed him dry acorn-flower\
  \ biscuits and a handful of crab apples. His head swims. When he slows, they prod\
  \ him with scabbarded swords.</p> \n    <p>The biting bugs are worse the second\
  \ day. With wrists in irons, he can barely swat them. His skin becomes a landscape\
  \ of reddened, scabby bumps. Paying little heed to the elves' legendary harmony\
  \ with nature, the insects feast on them, too. They spare only Dualal and Ethundel,\
  \ who must benefit from some salve or charm. If he weren't gagged, Gad might work\
  \ the lackeys, making hay of the gap in privilege between leader and led. With his\
  \ mouth tied shut it's all moot.</p> \n    <p>He thinks they've edged back to the\
  \ border of the haunted woodlands again, but can no longer be sure. When they're\
  \ stopped for a short break by the side of a glassy stream, the conversation of\
  \ another party drifts by. With silent efficiency, the Reclaimers grab Gad, fading\
  \ behind a low ridge of mossy stone. The musicality of the overheard words is unmistakably\
  \ elven. Clearly, the Reclaimers expect the local sharp-ears to treat them as interlopers.\
  \ Gad waits for a chance to make the move he's been planning, but the opening never\
  \ comes. His captors wait until the voices recede, then continue on.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ few hours later they hunker down again. Blond and amber stay by his side; the\
  \ rest slip off through the firs. Gad mimes a request to get the gag off. They refuse\
  \ him. He listens in with his barely passable Elven as they ponder which regions\
  \ of the world they'll claim when Dualal rules the world.</p> \n    <p>They're arguing\
  \ over the island of Absalom when the rest of the group tramps into view, dragging\
  \ a new prisoner. The fresh unfortunate is male, human, young, and scrawny. A wiggle\
  \ of drying blood runs from his scalp into a matted sideburn.</p> \n    <p>Gad seizes\
  \ the moment of distraction. He bolts up, clouting the amber elf's temple with the\
  \ edge of his shackles. Dodging slippery rocks, he bursts into the forest depths.\
  \ Elven curses ring through gnarled pines. Uneven terrain adds effort to his flight.\
  \ Gad's heart hammers; he gasps for breath. He stops to ease the gag from his mouth.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>From nowhere, Ethundel is upon him. A fist catches Gad in the throat.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Thought these woods would protect you, against an elf?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Gad whirls back. He crashes into a tree. Pain throbs through his shoulder\
  \ and down his side. He tries a double-handed swipe. The black-haired elf leaps\
  \ gracefully back. With Gad off balance, he barrels in and kicks Gad's feet out\
  \ from under him. Gad goes down, falling onto a rotting log. Ethundel aims a series\
  \ of savage kicks at his legs. Gad holds up his bound hands. Sadism spasms across\
  \ the elf's face. He grabs Gad by the back of the skull and crushes his face into\
  \ the log.</p> \n    <p>\"I give!\" Gad cries.</p> \n    <p>\"Now you supplicate?\
  \ After mocking and profaning our mistress?\" Ethundel punches Gad in the neck and\
  \ steps back to draw his sword. \"I don't care how well you haul a rock. It is unfortunate\
  \ that in my attempt to subdue you, I was forced to draw steel, and underestimated\
  \ the strength of my blow.\" He raises the blade.</p> \n    <p>\"Ethundel! Stay\
  \ your sword!\"</p> \n    <p>The black-maned elf is not the only one who can move\
  \ through a woods at a preternatural pace. Dualal stands a dozen yards off. She\
  \ looks down on the scene from a leaf-strewn slope.</p> \n    <p>\"Milady,\" Ethundel\
  \ stammers.</p> \n    <p>Fir needles crunch underfoot as she draws nearer. \"Your\
  \ ardor is understandable. Humans are insufferable. This one more than most. They\
  \ are also, in these woods, a scarce commodity. He who kills his thrall destroys\
  \ his own property.\"</p> \n    <p>Ethundel visibly swallows. \"Yes milady.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"We have two now. These will replace those we exhausted. Let us go now\
  \ to the Ironroot, and resume the dig. When he has served his purpose, he is yours,\
  \ to treat as whim decrees.\"</p> \n    <p>Ethundel dips his head and sheathes his\
  \ sword.</p> \n    <p>At Gad's side now, she reaches down to grab the gag, still\
  \ around his neck, and pull it up into his mouth. \"And you. Do not count on a second\
  \ reprieve.\"</p> \n    <p>Ethundel hauls him back to the others. The amber-haired\
  \ elf greets him with a sullen stare. Before long, they are back on the trail. The\
  \ new prisoner hasn't been gagged, but is too frightened to attempt a conversation.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Scrapes and contusions from Ethundel's beating gnaw at Gad as the\
  \ elves push him on. He mimes his need for water. They let him linger for a while\
  \ before slaking his thirst. They slog on past dusk.</p> \n    <p>The party is in\
  \ a clearing when a thunder of breaking branches rises from a dense throng of pines.\
  \ Tree trunks crack and topple. A throaty roar reverberates.</p> \n    <p>A creature\
  \ leaps into the clearing, a wake of shattered wood fragments billowing behind it.\
  \ Gad has never seen its like. It is a ball of quills and claws and fangs, ten feet\
  \ high and as many wide. Its legs are pillars of muscle. As much as it seems like\
  \ some unknown animal, it is also like a plant, festooned with vines and sprouting\
  \ leaves.</p> \n    <p>It bounds, snarling and frothing, toward the elves and their\
  \ prisoners.</p> \n    <br> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week</b>: Hard labor and quick\
