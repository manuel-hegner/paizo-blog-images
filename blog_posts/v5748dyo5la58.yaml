  \   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 28, 2007</p> \n   <p>If there's anything that\
  \ the other editors and I butt heads about around here, it's the amount of science\
  \ that should be present in our fantasyâ€”or rather, the amount of science fiction.\
  \ I make no bones about the fact that I'm a huge sci-fi fan, and if given my druthers\
  \ I'll almost always err on the side of too much rather than too little. Which means\
  \ that, given the overall traditional RPG fantasy feel of our campaign setting,\
  \ it usually falls to Jacobs, Wes, or someone similar to rein me back. (For instance,\
  \ no matter how much I lobbied, neither of them would budge and allow me to put\
  \ a magical particle accelerator or space elevator in the Varisia backdrop... which\
  \ is perhaps for the best.) </p> \n   <p>In <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zke\"\
  >D2: Seven Swords of Sin</a></i>, the setting of a research facility abandoned by\
  \ the mysterious Council of Truth allowed me ample opportunity to blend fantasy\
  \ and science to my own peculiar tastes. The generator room (magic-powered and water-cooled!),\
  \ the recycling unit (where corpses turn into valuable potions!), the incinerator\
  \ (get rid of those undesirables!), and the turbines that supply the dungeon with\
  \ air all scratched an itch that rarely gets addressed in a lot of fantasy settings.\
  \ By far the most sci-fi element, however, was one of the new monsters: nanites\
  \ (which were promptly renamed the construct swarm by the Powers That Be).</p> \n\
  \   <p>Few current trends in science capture my imagination more than nanotechnology.\
  \ Just reading about all the advances in medicine and manufacturing that are coming\
  \ about as we speak due to tiny, autonomous robots makes me giggle and start expounding\
  \ loudly on how We Live In The Future (which, as Jacobs will tell you, happens on\
  \ a regular basis). And while writing D2 I got to thinking: most of the reason we've\
  \ taken so long to get where we are with nanotech is due to manufacturing limitations.\
  \ But with magic, construct technology is already in place, and size is changeable\
  \ at a whim. It seemed to me like a natural choice. And if it allowed me to put\
  \ in a hermetically sealed \"clean room\" and a man transformed by a horrible, intelligent\
  \ swarm that prefers to fight its battles in your bloodstream... well, more's the\
  \ better. So, fully prepared to have to rewrite that room, I threw it in.</p> \n\
  \   <p>And, to my great surprise, it stayed. For that, I give many thanks to the\
  \ GameMastery team. May they not regret their decision.</p> \n   <p>Now just wait\
  \ until we start talking about Golarion's moon.... </p> \n   <p>James Sutter <br>Assistant\
