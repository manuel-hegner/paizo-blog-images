  >A few weeks ago</a>, we introduced you to the Co-Chairs of SkålCon, Andrew Christian\
  \ &amp; Jon Dehning. I wanted to take the opportunity to to report the resultsd—\
  it shows just how much good we as a Society can do when we put our mind's to it!\
  \ In Jon's words:</p> \n     <blockquote>\n      The Minneapolis/St. Paul Pathfinder\
  \ Lodge held the inaugural <a href=\"http://www.skalcon.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >SkålCon</a> convention September 18-20. This convention, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhw7\"\
  >previously featured in the Paizo blog</a>, had all proceeds donated to <a href=\"\
  http://www.tubman.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tubman</a>, Minnesota's largest provider\
  \ of crisis services. By any and all measures, our convention was a success.\n \
  \     <p></p> \n      <p>Over 80 people came together as a community to play some\
  \ Pathfinder and raise more funds for Tubman than I ever thought we would. Going\
  \ into September I thought, \"If we can raise $1500 I'm going to be really happy.\"\
  \ We smashed $1500 by 6:20 PM Friday night! At 8:30 PM we surpassed our goal of\
  \ $2000. When I made the announcement to the room that we had made our goal and\
  \ that I would be getting a shave and a haircut, Chris Mortika, unprompted, called\
  \ out \"How much more do we need to raise to get Andy [Christian] to shave his head?\"\
  \ Andy set our next goal; we needed to raise $3500.</p> \n      <p>In the end, we\
  \ raised $3735 for Tubman. It is a testament to our players' generosity and kindness.\
  \ As Andy remarked to me Saturday night, \"This makes all the hard work and [everything\
  \ else] of the past six years worth it.\" I couldn't agree more.</p> \n      <p>I\
  \ had an opportunity to tour one of Tubman's transitional housing centers in Minneapolis\
  \ when I stopped by to make our donation. Knowing our efforts are going to those\
  \ in need was very heartening. Meeting the staff that do all the hard work and make\
  \ people's lives better was an added perk. Being able to say \"Thank you\" to them\
  \ while I was there, while not much of a thing, was still gratifying; especially\
  \ when their eyes lit up when it was explained who I was and why I was there. Our\
  \ plan is to continue working with Tubman next year and into the foreseeable future.</p>\

  \ kept the convention running with no emergencies. Without their hard work, dedication\
  \ SkålCon would not exist. Thank you to everyone who donated items to our silent\

  \ for auction items. Thank you to Clinton Boomer who volunteered his time to run\
  \ three sessions of the retired scenario \"Hands of the Muted God\", and to John\
  \ Compton for allowing us to offer this scenario for credit. Clinton will be back\
  \ next year, so if you want to maybe play a retired scenario for credit...</p> \n\
  \      <p>Running a convention for charity is hard work, but a rewarding community\
