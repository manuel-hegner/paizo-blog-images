  \ Your Chains!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April 2, 2015</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Over a year ago, I\
  \ went to talk to Erik about a book idea I had. The pitch was simple: \"Let us do\
  \ a book filled with whatever crazy ideas we have floating around in our heads\"\
  . He said \"no\". I said, \"Wait though, allow me to explain, our crazy ideas might\
  \ make the game better.\" He said \"tell me more\", and Pathfinder Unchained was\
  \ born.</p> \n    <p>This book is just about to be released and it is time for us\
  \ to give you a good idea of the crazy ideas you will find inside. Pathfinder Unchained\
  \ is a book full of rules tweaks and alternate systems you can use to mod your game,\
  \ changing the way it plays. While we suspect that everyone will find their own\
  \ favorite rules subsystem, just about everyone take a long look through Chapter\
  \ 1, detailing alternate versions of the barbarian, monk, rogue, and summoner. So\
  \ to kick off our previews, I've asked designer Mark Seifter to give you some of\
  \ the juiciest tidbits about the Unchained variant classes!</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Barbarian:</b> From a game-balance perspective, the original barbarian\
  \ serves her role admirably, but her mechanics are math-intensive, forcing you to\
  \ recalculate numerous values once she enters rage and keep track of a bevy of once\
  \ per rage abilities. Worst of all, she's the most likely character of all to die\
  \ in a fight due to the way that ending rage lowers her current hit points. The\
  \ unchained barbarian keeps the adrenaline-pumping fun of her former self but significantly\
  \ simplifies the gameplay by adjusting the final mechanics instead of the stats\
  \ themselves. For example, she gains temporary hit points instead of raising and\
  \ later decreasing her current and maximum health (woo, no more dying at the end\
  \ of rage!). Finally, she gains stronger versions of some of the mechanically weakest\
  \ rage powers like raging climber (now you get an actual Climb speed instead of\
  \ a small bonus!).</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1131-Balazar.jpg\"\

  \ <br> <i>Illustration by Michael J. Penn</i>\n     </div> \n     <p><b>Monk:</b>\
  \ The original monk has many disparate abilities. While these abilities may be useful,\
  \ they don't always synergize, and they are extremely inflexible. The unchained\
  \ monk loosens up, gaining ki powers that allow you to customize your monk to fit\
  \ your vision, whether it be a kung fu genius or wuxia mystic (my favorites are\
  \ the ones like ki visions that let you gain divination powers that affect the narrative\
  \ out of combat!). The unchained monk also has a full base attack bonus, an all-new\
  \ flurry of blows, and some martial arts style strikes that help him reach his true\
  \ potential (my favorite is flying kick, which lets you perform a leaping kick out\
  \ to a distance equal to your extra monk movement speed once per flurry—mobile combatant\
  \ for the win!).</p> \n     <p><b>Rogue:</b> The original rogue has plenty of skill\
  \ points and a damage increase in the form of sneak attack, but she needed a way\
  \ to rule her own niche, especially with all the other classes that have things\
  \ like big skill bonuses and accuracy boosts. The unchained rogue has a powerful\
  \ debilitation ability that dramatically alters her ability to hit or dodge her\
  \ foe, rogue's edge, which allows her to do unique things with her favorite skills\
  \ (figure out surface thoughts with Sense Motive, Bluff so well you bypass truth-telling\
  \ magic, use Disable Device reactively to protect yourself from a triggered trap,\
  \ and much more!), and a significant boost to some of her rogue talents (For instance,\
  \ minor magic? Yeah, you get that cantrip at-will). She also gets Weapon Finesse\
  \ as a bonus feat and the ability to add her Dexterity to weapon damage!</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Summoner:</b> The original summoner has plenty of innovative features,\
  \ but he also lacks focus and theme. As Jason was fond of describing it \"You just\
  \ have this amorphous blob with ten tentacles and two butts.\" The unchained summoner\
  \ gains an eidolon that fits among existing outsiders, gaining additional abilities\
  \ but also focus and theme (and if you want ten tentacles and two butts, we've still\
  \ got that—go protean all the way my friend!). Some of these outsiders gain some\
  \ pretty juicy abilities, like the angel's protective aura (that double strength\
  \ magic circle against evil/lesser globe combo) or constant true seeing. Additionally,\
  \ he possesses the spell list originally intended for the summoner.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>So there you have it. We are confident that some of these classes will\
  \ find a home at your game table, even if the Eidolon no longer has two butts. Tune\
  \ in next week when we move on to look at some of the exciting new options in the\
  \ Skills and Feats chapter!</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Lead Designer</i></p>\
