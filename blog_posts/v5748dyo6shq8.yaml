  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Our latest book, <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot/discuss?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse\"\
  >Pathfinder Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse</a> is already trickling into the hands\
  \ of our subscribers ahead of its upcoming release! With it comes new ancestries,\
  \ deities, and a ton of lore to inspire characters, both native to the Expanse and\
  \ visiting from other regions of the Inner Sea. We’ve talked a bit about how to\
  \ adventure when your character comes from another region of Golarion, such as Absalom\
  \ or Varisia, so today, we wanted to highlight building a character from the Mwangi\
  \ Expanse. One of the authors for this book, Jabari Weathers, wrote some great guidance\
  \ for this in the introduction of the book, as well as some questions to help you\
  \ dig into your character’s connection with their home and what kind of adventures\
  \ that might spark. </p> \n     <p>Today, let's go through these questions as we\
  \ build a character of our own! Meet Bolani, an elementalist (upcoming in <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic\">Secrets of Magic!</a>)\
  \ from the Mwangi Expanse. </p> \n     <p>Our first prompt: “What has your home\
  \ taught you?” Having a character’s home be central to their personality, challenges,\
  \ or worldview can be a good way to delve into a new concept. </p> \n     <p><em>Though\
  \ the Mwangi Expanse hosts countless cultures and many powerful civilizations, the\
  \ vastness and abundance of the land is an undeniable facet of everyday life. The\
  \ mighty fortress of Senghor plies the sea for netfuls of fish, while the trade\
  \ city of Kibwe hauls up tons of ores from the earth to fill its marketplaces. Experiencing\
  \ the turning of the seasons, from the fires and droughts of the savannah to the\
  \ monsoons of the rainy season, has taught Bolani the true power of the natural\
  \ world. Humanity can attempt to harness or control the elements, but in the end,\
  \ such measures will always fail—it is far better to learn the power of each element\
  \ and adapt to them.</em></p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/64492099-cc69-4bc7-a0a5-5c20c68da27b/070221_bolani.png\"\

  >Art by Klaher Baklaher</p> \n     <p>Our second prompt: “What remains mysterious\
  \ to you about home?” I’m sure that none of us knows every last fact about our hometowns,\
  \ neighborhoods, or countries—there’s always room for one more unknown fact to discover\
  \ or a bit of history to unearth. When a character has questions that they’re trying\
  \ to get answered, that can give a personal angle to their adventures, and Pathfinder\
  \ is about adventure, after all! </p> \n     <p><em>Bolani mastered many skills\
  \ in pursuit of elemental mastery, not the least of which is geology. She brags\
  \ that she can determine where she is in the Mwangi Expanse simply by feeling the\
  \ rocks through her toes. Yet a few times over her career, she has encountered pieces\
  \ of stone that elude her understanding—statues that do not seem to belong on this\
  \ continent, tiny chips that seem to be literally beyond this world. Could these\
  \ be relics of the Azlani, who ventured into the Expanse to defeat the serpentfolk\
  \ god Ydersius and then seemingly departed without settling? Might these be related\
  \ to the Doorway to the Red Star, which has fallen into disuse and mystery since\
  \ the days of Old-Mage Jatembe? Or might these be crumbling remains from the Abyss\
  \ itself, trod into the soil of Mwangi by the hooves of a demonic army that even\
  \ now still lingers?</em></p> \n     <p>Lastly: “What are you protective of?” This\
  \ can be something immediate, like a family member, but it can also be something\
  \ a bit larger. What kind of changes scare your character most, and why? Is there\
  \ something that they are working to preserve or even change about their culture\
  \ or home? Figuring out what your character wants to protect can be a good way to\
  \ give them direct ties and make their home feel lived in. </p> \n     <p><em>When\
  \ Bolani was young, she could speak to the plants and elements of her home and hear\
  \ them clearly in response. Now that she is older, she has found that these conversations\
  \ harder for her to accomplish, and often become garbled or strained messages. She\
  \ does not know if this is due to some change in her own self or if something terrible\
  \ is happening to her home, beneath everyone’s notice—no one else she has spoken\
  \ to has reported such a problem, which leaves Bolani uncertain and troubled. Whatever\
  \ the cause, her connection to her childhood home is precious to her, and Bolani\
  \ wishes to reestablish the connection and determine what went wrong to prevent\
  \ it from occurring again.</em></p> \n     <p>Bolani is just one character, and\
  \ there’s a whole Expanse to explore! Tell us about what kind of characters you’\
  re planning to create, and how they might feel about their homes!</p> \n     <p\
