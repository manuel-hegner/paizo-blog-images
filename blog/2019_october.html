               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“Reality is born. Reality must die. So somewhere in between must dwell both you and I.”</p> 
                <p>Such was said to be writ upon the Seal, carved in such a way that all would understand regardless of language or intellect. The Seal was the gravestone of the previous reality. The Seal was the foundation stone of the next reality. It was upon the Seal that Pharasma was born into this reality, adrift in the Maelstrom within an unformed metacosmos. She stood, and read the Seal’s Truth, and saw that she trod upon its core. Looking out over the Seal’s eight edges, Pharasma beheld the eternity of probability, a vastness yet formed from the raw entropy of the churning remains of what had come before. She was the Survivor, yet she knew not what she had survived—just that she had.</p> 
                <p>Pharasma stepped off the edge of the Seal, and as her foot descended to the nothing, the Seal expanded so that she was supported. She stood there a moment on one of the Seal’s eight edges, one step into the new reality, and she could sense that she was already not alone. Something chewed and gnawed out there beyond perception. Something vast, and hungry, and dangerous. Pharasma knew her first fear that very first step—fear of the unknown, fear that something else had survived, fear that she would not.</p> 
                <p>And so she stepped to the side.</p> 
                <p>As Pharasma walked, the edges of the Seal grew. The Outer Sphere bloomed beneath her feet as the Seal expanded its power. Where Pharasma walked, the planes themselves followed, and with each circuit around the Seal, she widened her path, walking a deosil spiral of creation that gave those who would follow a place to love and hate, to war and create. As she walked the spiral, the Seal itself grew outward, forming the Spire. It reached toward what lay opposite its beginning. And when Pharasma finished, the Spire had grown to support the Boneyard above, and it would be her home.</p> 
                <p>The Seal had responded to Pharasma’s spiral path, and as she strode, other divinities were birthed into the new reality. The Speakers in the Depths retreated at once to the heart of entropy and could not be bothered to take part in what followed. Desna marveled at creation, and with a wave of her hand brought the first night to the skies above. Sarenrae followed swiftly thereafter, and was smitten with Desna and her work, and so she chose the brightest of those stars to shine as the suns, birthing the first day. Ihys, who would in time become the First to die, and his brother Asmodeus, who would in time become the First to kill, each defined the other and brought goodness and evil with them. And Achaekek rose to stand between, an arbiter over morality and a judge whose impartial aegis would, in time, crumble to savagery. Yet not all of the first would have names, or even be remembered. One tread forth beyond the Eclipse, but without death yet in the world, this Prince became Bound to a throne in the Spire’s shadow to await his time. And the final would foolishly step forth beyond Pharasma’s first fearful step, and in so doing would be transformed and absorbed by that fear. Whether that fear became Rovagug or whether it was Rovagug who was the devouring fear, not even the gods can remember.</p> 
                <p>As those First Eight became, so did Pharasma feel something else wake on the far side of time. Just as she had walked a deosil spiral to create, a widdershins spiral wound in opposition at the other side of reality, where the Lurker at the Threshold formed the second anchor of creation. Pharasma thus learned that each cycle required not only a Survivor, but also a Watcher. So that between the two, between Pharasma and Yog-Sothoth, all reality would thus become the Great Beyond. Thus began the Age of Creation.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>And so in the ages that followed, Pharasma remained upon her throne. She watched and judged all who passed from life into death, and as time wore on the number of the dead grew apace to the number of the born. And in time, Pharasma beheld her second fear. An event beyond anticipation fractured fate, and on all worlds, the flow of prophecy was forever altered. Storms raged, empires fell, gods died, and in the least fortunate corners of reality, entire worlds came to an end. Pharasma herself lost track for that brief moment of what had yet to come, and when she opened her eyes again, she saw that the Seal had vanished, leaving behind a featureless void. She reached out to the Watcher to inquire if such a ripple in destiny had ever occurred before, to determine if the loss of the Seal had always been ordained, but the Watcher would not reply.</p> 
                <p>Yet reality went on. Mortals were born, and mortals were slain. Pharasma’s second fear abated, and she realized that the lost Seal was not an ill omen, but more akin to the passing of a parent or teacher. Now, this cycle of reality had matured to the point where it could continue on its own, and Pharasma knew that, going forward, reality was well and truly on its own. The apogee of creation had passed, and Pharasma knew that her days ahead would forever be in the shadow of her days behind. And while she knew how much time remained, she knew as well that there was more than enough for mortal life to enjoy more glories and triumphs than they could envision.</p> 
                <p>And even though reality must eventually end, Pharasma does not despair. She knows that the number of the dead has never before eclipsed the number of the born, for even as the Watcher witnesses from outside the cycle, there must always be a Survivor to carry on within the cycle to begin the next. In time, the flux of the born shall cease, and their number shall become a static record. And in those final hours, Pharasma knows she must prepare the next cycle’s Seal, and she must watch and wait as the final count of the dead approaches. And when that final visitant from life steps before her throne to be judged, Pharasma knows that it will be the Survivor who stands before her, and that she will not judge but will herself be judged. And so, with her death, shall this cycle end.</p> 
                <p>But it is here that Pharasma’s final fear awaits. The fracture of fate and the loss of the Seal has made her conviction falter, and she no longer knows for fact that she shall be the penultimate death. For if she steps before herself to be judged, and leaves behind none to Survive, the cycle shall end and nothing shall wend.</p>

               <p>James Jacobs is the Creative Director for Pathfinder. While he was there at the beginning of Golarion’s creation, many of the deities worshiped by that world’s heroes and villains had already existed for decades before. Goddesses and gods like Desna and Rovagug, Sarenrae and Abadar, Achaekek and Zon-Kuthon first established their faithful among PCs and NPCs alike in James’ home campaign in the late 80s and early 90s. Sharing them with the world as deities of the Pathfinder setting, seeing players and creators come to love and hate them (and in some cases cosplay as them), has been a career highlight.</p> 
               <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px">About the Windsong Testaments</p> 
               <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the <i>Windsong Testaments</i>—parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">We’re mere days from getting ahold of Starfinder’s new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0206c?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual">Character Operations Manual</a>, a book that’s overflowing with new character options. Although I didn’t get to work on this book directly, I got the benefit of flipping through all of its fancy new feats and class features with the exuberance of a fan—a pleasure I experience far less often as a developer.</p> 
                <p><b>Envoy</b>: The envoy gets all sorts of potent new alternate features that let your PC become the combat-negotiator they always dreamed of becoming—or wield mystical spells in addition to their charismatic tricks. However, the one that captures my attention is called polymorphic disguise. With this alternate class feature, your envoy can ditch their expertise ability and instead become a shapechanger! You can design your envoy’s alternate form using the <i>polymorph</i> spell (from <i>Alien Archive 2</i>), and your envoy always adds their expertise die when disguising themselves in that form. As your envoy gains levels, their shapeshifting power improves by using higher and higher levels of the <i>polymorph</i> spell. What’s more, in place of learning new expertise talents, your envoy can instead learn additional forms to expand their shapechanging arsenal!</p> 
                <p><b>Mechanic</b>: If you caught me on the recent <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo">Starfinder Wednesday Twitch stream</a>, you’ll know I’m a fan of powered armor in Starfinder. I’m also a big fan of the mechanic class, so I was overjoyed to see an alternative to the artificial intelligence class feature called experimental prototype. Your mechanic chooses either to develop an experimental weapon prototype or an experimental armor prototype, and let me tell you: the armor is damn cool. In addition to gaining heavy armor proficiency, your mechanic is able to fit extra upgrades into their suit, reprogram the armor on the fly to better defend against specific foes, and at most levels rebuild the armor into a higher-level version of itself. At 5th level, your mechanic automatically becomes proficient in powered armor, and your mechanic can transform their armor prototype into powered armor. At higher levels, your mechanic can start adding great powers like flight and energy shields.</p>

                </div> 
                <p><b>Mystic</b>: If you’re like me, you adore many of the mystic connections but often see one of the connection powers and say “Hmmm, I see how that appeals to some folks, but that’s just not what my character wants.” What if you could shop around for new connection powers on a case-by-case basis? Enter epiphanies, a new mystic option that provides a host of universal connection powers that anyone can take in place of one of their connection’s current powers. Would you rather your akashic mystic gain the mystic reach epiphany in place of her peer Into the future connection power, extending the range of their spells by casting them as full actions? Maybe your star shaman wants to branch out by picking up a second connection in place of their starlight form power? Or are you like me and just want to give a mindbreaker mystic the 1st-level epiphany called wrecking fists, letting them punch anything that has the gall to be immune to mind-affecting effects? Now you can!</p>

                </div> 
                <p><b>Operative</b>: A large portion of the operative’s options involve a really fun alternative to trick attack called stunt and strike, and while I’m excited for you to explore that on you own, I want to call out a delightful alternative to the operative’s fast movement ability: quick cover. Why run when you can hide? You’re able to upgrade the degree of cover your character is gaining from the environment, with tiny impediments that would grant no bonus giving partial cover (“I take cover behind the toaster. No, really.”), and gain cover from whatever would provide just partial cover. I really enjoy manipulating an encounter’s environment with improvised weapons, cover, and other tricks, so this ability’s right up my alley.</p> 
                <p><b>Solarian</b>: The <i>Character Operations Manual</i> introduces shields, which the new vanguard class wields admirably. But why should vanguards get all the fun? What if instead of manifesting a photon-axe or solar armor your character could instead generate an energy shield that boosts your AC? What if I also told you that you can slap people with your energy shield to make an unarmed strike? What if you could slap a solarion weapon crystal into your character’s shield to change the type of damage that the unarmed shield slams deal? What if I stopped asking leading questions and just got to the point? The solar shield solarian is really cool! And if you can stand to wait until this book hits shelves, you can also read up on the long-anticipated solar flare solarian option that can fire ranged energy bursts!</p> 
                <p><b>Soldier</b>: Do you ever run into a character option that suddenly inspires a whole character concept and spurs a frantic rush to research all of the other options that could potentially contribute to that character’s new schtick? I know I do, and I’ve been through that at least three different times when finding a playable alien that has the natural attack racial trait. Like, do I want my vesk to tear limbs from her foes as the rest of the group watches with a mix of horror and envy? Darn right I do. And now others can enjoy that same fascination thanks to the ascetic warrior option that exchanges your character’s heavy armor and heavy weapons proficiency in order to deliver devastating unarmed strikes. And if your soldier already had the natural attacks ability, you can instead add weapon special properties to their strikes, such as block, grapple, or stun. If you’re excited about unarmed prowess, you might also like some of the new feat boosts—those are special gear boosts that modify specific combat feats your character might have grabbed. I really like grabbing strike (modifies Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple]), which lets you automatically grapple a foe after you use an unarmed strike against them and beat the target’s KAC by 8 or more.</p>

                </div> 
                <p><b>Technomancer</b>: For those who love casting spells, the technomancer’s spell cache gives you all the power you need to fuel your character’s technological mischief. But for me, the ideal technomancer lives for cybernetic augmentations, slowly transforming into someone who’s as much machine as mortal. That’s why I’m so excited for the cache augmentation, a new option that replaces spell cache and cache capacitor with a cybernetic or magitech augmentation that evolves as your character gains levels. Plus, at higher levels, every time your technomancer prepares for the day, they can configure their augmentation to boost their choice of Reflex saves, Fortitude saves, attack rolls, or key skill checks.</p>

                <h2>Pathfinder (2nd edition) Sanctioning</h2> 
                <p itemprop="description">Since sanctioning <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0q?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Fall-of-Plaguestone"><i>Fall of Plaguestone</i></a>, the team received feedback from the community.

                </div> 
                <p>A key principle of sanctioning involves the relationship of Society to Paizo product lines. We wish to support all products, but at a level that makes sense to the ongoing Pathfinder Society campaign. Our goal is to get 95%+ of materials into the hands of players. This includes sanctioning the Lost Omens line (more on that in a minute) as well as other upcoming rules supplements. For modules and adventure paths, we wish to encourage players to try them out or play them as home games. Depending on the scope and content of the adventure, they may not fit well within the organized play environment. As a thank you for trying out other Paizo products, we’ve created chronicles that do fit within the campaign and may be applied to your Pathfinder Society character.</p> 
                <p>Just as certain adventures don’t necessarily fit well within the organized play environment, static rewards don’t work well for sanctioning non-Society content. We decided not to utilize the previous one size fits all model and its blanket statements that modules get X and adventure paths earn Y. Instead, we use a sliding scale of rewards, looking at the estimated play time/length of the adventure and comparing it to known quantities such as scenarios and quests. Using a flexible scale allows us to act on feedback received on current sanctioned adventures and explore what options a new edition of Pathfinder supports.</p> 
                <p>In summary, Fall of Plaguestone is the first module sanctioned. We continue to listen to feedback and will evolve the process over time to support both Paizo products and the Organized Play program.</p> 
                <p>For Lost Omens sanctioning, we have completed our pass on the World Guide and hope to post it to the Character Options section of the Guide to Play in the next few weeks. We are currently working on the Character Guide and estimate that it will follow shortly. We queued the Age of Ashes adventure path for the next available sanctioning timeslot.</p> 
                <h2>Starfinder Sanctioning</h2> 
                <p>With convention season and then a vacancy on the organized play team, we fell behind on sanctioning content for Starfinder Society. Catching up is on the team’s radar and is next in line behind getting scenarios ready, but we are hampered by being a developer short. Will update more as we have news.</p> 
                <h2>Achievement Points</h2> 
                <p>We built the Playtest Point (PtP) system, and then used it as the framework to build the Achievement Point (AcP) program. Building a new program came with many hurdles. Unfortunately, we fell down at the beginning of the track and that led to delays in the project. As many of you noted, the cost of PtP wasn’t behaving the way the boons listed, resulting in hurdle one. Attaching a customized pdf copy of the boon, instead of just an online list, resulted in hurdle two. PtP awarded automatically, based on the number of Pathfinder Playtest scenarios reported for a player/GM. With the tiered structure of AcP, we needed new tools for organizers/GMs. The implementation came with a bit of an issue, so there is hurdle three. Determining the reward chart, while down a developer and in the middle of edition transfer, was hurdle four. Getting the rewards built in our system was hurdle five. There have been others, but those are the key roadblocks encountered in our process.</p> 
                <p>The positive news is we’ve passed many of these hurdles. We reconfigured the calculation codes for PtP purchases and how to designate premier events. These need review by quality assurance before we can roll them out. We have the boons ready for hurdle two, and I’m in contact with our tech developer to get them attached to user accounts when purchased. Our awesome developers finished the reward chart and made the boons, which passes hurdle four. By the time you read this, we should have input the chart into the system, removing hurdle five.</p> 
                <p>It is our intention that we have resolutions for all hurdles in place in the next month. By releasing the chart early, players can plan what purchases they want to make when the project goes online. We wish that we wouldn’t have encountered so many issues and that AcP would have rolled at launch, but we would rather take a few extra weeks than rush this out the door and have issues in perpetuity.</p> 
                <h2>Nova/Glyph implementation</h2> 
                <p>We found some limitations in our current site display that keeps the stars/novas/glyphs from displaying correctly. We’ve filed a tech support request for this issue, but have it prioritized behind getting AcP out the gate. The update that fixes premier events also should fix evaluation game recording so Venture-Captains will have a means to enter results that is not sending emails to the organized play inbox.</p> 
                <h2>Pathfinder Society/Starfinder Society Webpages</h2> 
                <p>We know these haven’t seen an update in some time. The departure of Robot led to a vacancy and without someone to update those pages, we are left in a holding pattern. We hope to have more updates soon.</p> 
                <h2>Pathfinder Society Guide to Play</h2> 
                <p>The team working on this project have the wiki version made in a test environment so that they can put it through its paces and ensure its functionality before revealing it to the public. The organized play team currently has a list of questions we need to resolve and get the answers to them. As we are approaching full development strength, having filled the vacancy that came with John’s departure, we have capacity to do more than produce the monthly scenario/quest quota and hope to catch up on this very soon.</p> 
                <p>We appreciate our community’s appetite for all things organized play! Ensuring scenarios publish on time is our number one priority. The organized play team works to capacity with a goal of delivering the best program possible. We welcome your understanding as we work towards reducing the backlog of tasks.</p> 
                <p>I’ve pulled back the curtain a bit. I hope it helps our community and that we can continue the tradition of awesome Organized Play.</p> 
                <p>Tune in next week for the first of the month Spotlights, Cons, and Bits blog.</p> 
                <p>Until then, Explore-Report-Cooperate!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">The Pathfinder Core Rulebook has been out in the wide world for a few months now! While you’ve had a chance to put the game through its paces, we’ve been hard at work combing through feedback and questions from staff, players, and fans of the game, looking for any spots that need clarification.</p> 
                <p>As with any publication, we’ve found a few errors along the way, and we’ve been carefully collecting and compiling them. While we’re not going to list out every typo that we’ve now corrected, we want to provide everyone with the most central updates to the text of the game. Some of these are rules clarifications or corrections of simple errors, while others are broader changes to streamline play or bring core concepts of the game together. We’ve also provided a brief explanation of each change to help show our intent so you can more easily apply the changes to your game.</p> 
                <p>We should note that not every problem has been addressed in this document. Some are a bit complicated, and the solution is going to take more time to fully test before releasing it to all of you. Just because you don’t see an answer here doesn’t mean that we aren’t aware of and considering the issue—we’re likely just trying to figure out the best way to handle it. Please also note that this document contains updates for only the Core Rulebook. We’re still vetting some changes to the Bestiary and some other products, and we’ll get those changes out to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding and patience as we work to make Pathfinder the best game it can be!</p>

                <p>Crit Arena will be live on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo">Official Paizo Twitch channel</a> this week on November 1st from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. hosted by our Pathfinder Designer Lyz Liddell &amp; Managing Developer Adam Daigle. We invite you to our special event!</p> 
                <p>You as our audience have an essential job. We want you to kill our Iconics from Pathfinder Second Edition. Or at least try anyway.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102919_CritArena.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102919_CritArena_500.jpeg"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>That’s right; we want you to slaughter them within the Crit Arena. Because in this arena, every hit is a critical hit, and every miss is a critical fumble. Don’t worry; our Iconics will have the same benefit as well if you wish to root for your favorite.</p> 
                <p>We will be using the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpt?Pathfinder-Critical-Hit-Deck">Critical Hit</a> or <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpu?Pathfinder-Critical-Fumble-Deck">Critical Fumble</a> decks on every result. And for those who have already used these decks before you will know how deadly they can be. Will Valeros decapitate an owlbear? Will a kobold maul Amiri? It’s all on you as our audience!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102919_BestiaryBattleCards.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102919_BestiaryBattleCards_500.jpeg"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Oh, and you, the viewer will be choosing the monsters our heroes will be fighting! And to make it easier on us all, we will be using the upcoming Pathfinder Second Edition <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0206k?Pathfinder-Bestiary-Battle-Cards">Bestiary Battle Cards</a>!</p> 
                <p>You will be voting for which monsters our adventurers may face. So be sure to bring out your evil Game Mastering minds and tune in!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102919_PathfinderBattles.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102919_PathfinderBattles_500.jpeg"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>But that isn’t all! Before the Crit Arena begins, our Franchise Manager Mark Moreland and Publisher Erik Mona will be with us early at 2:30 p.m. Pacific to showcase and unbox the Pathfinder Battles <a href="https://paizo.com/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/miniatures/pathfinderbattles/legendaryadventures">Legendary Adventures</a> miniature set! And they have graciously provided several boxes to be given away to you, the viewer!</p> 
                <p>Throughout the stream, we will be giving away <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpt?Pathfinder-Critical-Hit-Deck">Critical Hit Decks</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpu?Pathfinder-Critical-Fumble-Deck">Critical Fumble Decks</a>, and boxed miniature sets throughout the event! So if you’re active in our chatbox and are watching the live stream. You’ll probably have a good chance of winning a prize! To clarify, however, we will not be giving away the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0206k?Pathfinder-Bestiary-Battle-Cards">Bestiary Battle Cards</a>, as the box pictured above is the only copy in existence right now. Maybe in the future, though, tell us what you think!</p> 
                <p>We will be doing the unboxing at 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Pacific. Then take a short break as we prepare the arena for our guests to fight in. Later, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m, we will be subjugating fellow Paizo employees in the CRIT ARENA!</p> 
                <p>We hope to see you during the Crit Arena on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo">Official Paizo Twitch Channel</a>!</p>

                <p>In Season One, Game Master Jason Bulmahn led a group of five strangers who boarded a caravan heading to Lastwall, an ancient kingdom watching over the grave of a long-dead menace. Conscripted into the army, they faced years of training and service, but as smoke began to rise from the horizon, they came together as friends in order to have a chance at survival.</p> 
                <p>“In the epic conclusion of Season One, there were a number of stories left unresolved. The trail of one foe stands before them, but it is a journey that leads into the deepest darkness, and none of them will emerge unscathed,” said Bulmahn.</p> 
                <p>The complete #KnightsOfEverflame cast will return including Jason Bulmahn (@JasonBulmahn) as the Game Master, Gina DeVivo (@PocketGina) as Omelette Stonebreaker the dwarf barbarian, Jeremy Steven Walker (@JwalkerScene) as Ikyulys the mysterious champion of Shelyn, Aki (@MxGiniInABottle) as Lysonn Shorbucle the halfling ranger, Erika Fermina (@astylepixie) as Tariel Windhaven the half-elf bard, and Rachel Seeley (@Sunnyseeley) as Lynneus Lennon the half-elf cleric of Sarenrae. Chris Fishel (@AKAthefish) will direct. Jason Bulman and other cast members will be live in chat on Twitch during the premiere!</p> 
                <p>Paizo is also pleased to announce that apparel and accessories for <i>Knights of Everflame</i> are being released on Amazon. You’ll find designs for each of the knights available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/1906A362-39BD-43EC-B7B9-CF6F6078C940?ingress=3&amp;visitId=c144d908-e516-4bc5-b588-1bf0d8e24a56">here</a>, including options for sweatshirts, tank tops, hoodies, Raglan baseball tees, and more.</p>

               <div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;">
                <a href="/image/content/Blog/102819_COMPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/102819_COMPreview_360.jpeg"></a>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Starfinder has over 100 playable species now, but one of the things we wanted to do in the Character Operations Manual was give a little love to the 13 species found in the Starfinder Core Rulebook (including legacy races). What does that mean? That means alternate ability score adjustments, alternate racial traits, and new feats, gear, and class options which—while perhaps pioneered by a given species—are actually available to everyone.</p> 
                <p>Let’s start with the simple stuff: ability score and racial trait options unique to each species. So, for example, some androids were built for manual labor; instead of high Intelligence and Dexterity, they’re stronger and more able to endure tough working conditions (Strength and Constitution). Species known for settling diverse environments have options that model adaptation to high (human), low (human and vesk), or zero gravity (human and ysoki). There’s a lot more.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102819_COMAlternateRacialsImageA.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102819_COMAlternateRacialsImageA_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102819_COMAlternateRacialsImageB.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102819_COMAlternateRacialsImageB_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102819_COMAlternateRacialsImageC.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102819_COMAlternateRacialsImageC_360.jpeg"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Every species also has one or more options that replace each of their racial traits. A player who doesn’t like the shirren’s Cultural Fascination ability, for example, has three (three!) new choices. Cultural Assimilation gives you a bonus to Disguise checks instead of Diplomacy, as you blend in with an adopted species; Individual Obsession allows you to pick an additional class skill and get an automatic skill point every level, along with a +2 bonus in the chosen skill; and Linguistic Acculturation swaps out that Diplomacy bonus for more languages (a lot more).</p> 
                <p>But what I find really cool are feats, gear, spell, and class options, and if your character has the right physiology, you can take these options no matter your race. Check out kasatha, for example: You’ve got a bunch of new feats for characters with four arms. (How many new feats? Four, of course!) There’s even a new class option for soldiers who wield three or more weapons at a time: the Fourfold Tactician. As followers of the Four-Armed Conspiracy™ can tell you, you don’t have to be a kasatha to qualify. Even a human or lashunta soldier with a couple of cybernetic arms can use the Fourfold Tactician fighting style to fire two automatic weapons at the same time! (We call that class feature “Overkill,” and you can see why.) Other class options have no requirements at all: the Crusader connection for mystics, for example, or the vesk Battlemaster fighting style for soldiers.</p> 
                <p>On top of all this, there’s spells and gear. Now your ysoki can cast shrink object to fit that big special something in their cheek pouches (at high level, a really big special something). </p> 
                <p>The rest of the Star Chamber will be chiming in here over the next few weeks with more glimpses into the Character Operations Manual, but let me tell you, you are not going to be disappointed. This book blows Starfinder character creation wide open. From now on, you’ll never feel like your hero is just like everyone else.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">The bonds of family are strong and can blind even the gods to atrocity and awfulness. And no deity knows better the dangers of trusting one’s sibling than Shelyn, sister of Zon-Kuthon.</p> 
                <p>In the earliest days of mortal life on Golarion, there was no Zon-Kuthon. None suspected what dark fate awaited Shelyn’s brother Dou-Bral, and indeed the two deities were, in many societies, worshiped as a single faith, an inseparable pair devoted to the pursuit of song and joy. But even among the ranks of the divine, nothing is forever. The most dour and depressed take a lesson in this, alas, in that a mortal’s limited time on the world is a blessing. For the longer one lives, the more chances you’ll have of facing betrayal from those you once held most dear.</p> 
                <p>Arguments between siblings are part of the parcel, and both Shelyn and Dou-Bral had had their share of squabbles before, but the clash that would shatter their familial ties was something so overwhelming that it changed both deities forever. Whatever the cause of the great dissonance between the siblings, the results were undeniable. Dou-Bral abandoned his faithful and reality alike, leaving his sister to grieve and mourn as if he had perished. The prayers of Dou-Bral’s faithful went unheard, and those of the faith who survived this betrayal were welcomed into Shelyn’s church even as the goddess herself struggled with the results of that great sadness. It would be ages before anyone heard again of Shelyn’s brother, but when they did, they—Shelyn included—would have rather remained forever in mourning.</p> 
                <p>For when he returned, he was no longer Dou-Bral. He had become Zon-Kuthon. Unknown to the gods or the faithful, Dou-Bral had not only abandoned his family and followers, but reality itself. He had traveled to the very depths of the Outer Rifts, pushing beyond borders held in fear by the most ancient dwellers in those unknown Abyssal depths, to emerge into the Beyond Beyond. And what he found there destroyed him. And what he found there reincarnated him. A cycle of death and rebirth taken place outside of the auspices of Pharasma herself, Dou-Bral ended and Zon-Kuthon began.</p> 
                <p>Forever changed and transformed from the unimaginable ordeals and torments suffered during his absence, Zon-Kuthon did not immediately seek his family’s pardon upon his return, yet as different as he had become from what had been before, enough of Dou-Bral remained within the tormented frame of the new god of loss and pain for Shelyn to take notice.</p> 
                <p>Zon-Kuthon repaid Shelyn’s extended hand of forgiveness with trauma and agony, piercing the flesh of her hand with his razored nails. When she cried out in pain and again offered forgiveness, Zon-Kuthon responded by slaughtering their father, Thron. The mutilated god twisted and broke and reshaped Thron into his own enslaved herald, the Prince in Chains, an act that provoked Shelyn into something she had never before engaged in—battle.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>The siblings’ combat shook the pillars of reality, and on worlds spread throughout the Material Plane, things of beauty withered and wept and bled and died. Zon-Kuthon had grown powerful indeed from his exposure to that which transformed him Beyond the Beyond, but Shelyn was empowered by her own righteousness. The battle ended in a draw as Shelyn wrested away Zon-Kuthon’s murderous glaive. She’d hoped that separating him from what she believed to be the source of his corruption would set him free, but in the time of horrors that followed, she realized that the glavie itself was not the source—that her brother was now forever a slave to loss. As news of Zon-Kuthon’s treatment of his father and sister spread among the gods, an unsettling schism began to form. Some took offense at the acts and called for Zon-Kuthon’s execution. Others expressed admiration for his cruelty and professed support in pursuit of a change to divine order.</p> 
                <p>Abadar, forever protector of society, be it among mortals or the divine, saw the rumblings of civil war among the gods and took action. He offered Zon-Kuthon a choice to accept banishment to the prison realm of Xovaikain on the Plane of Shadow for as long as the sun hung in the skies above Golarion, and in return offered the Midnight Lord a single item from the First Vault. Zon-Kuthon agreed and chose from the vault the First Shadow, and once again left the ranks of the divine.</p> 
                <p>There are those who say Zon-Kuthon knew of the promise of Earthfall, and even others who dared imply he had a hand in its engineering. Whatever the case, the Age of Darkness blotted out the sun above Golarion, and Zon-Kuthon was released from what should have been eternal imprisonment. In that time, though, tempers had cooled. Zon-Kuthon took his gift of the First Shadow and used it to transform his one-time prison into his planar realm and cemented his divine rule over the nation of Nidal, but he was careful to moderate his atrocities so as to avoid arousing the wrath of the other gods. And while his evil lingers in the literal shadow of greater dangers, much as the nation of Nidal’s cruelties are overshadowed by the more blatant mayhem and tyranny of neighboring Cheliax, Shelyn has not forgotten. Still she seeks a method of redeeming her lost brother. Still she seeks a way to save him from the horrors Beyond Beyond. And those who know and love the goddess of love can only pray themselves she finds a way, lest what transformed her brother so long ago find new despair to ripen within.</p>

                <p>James Jacobs is the Creative Director for Pathfinder. While he was there at the beginning of Golarion’s creation, many of the deities worshiped by that world’s heroes and villains had already existed for decades before. Goddesses and gods like Desna and Rovagug, Sarenrae and Abadar, Achaekek and Zon-Kuthon first established their faithful among PCs and NPCs alike in James’ home campaign in the late 80s and early 90s. Sharing them with the world as deities of the Pathfinder setting, seeing players and creators come to love and hate them (and in some cases cosplay as them), has been a career highlight.</p> 
                <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px">About the Windsong Testaments</p> 
                <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the <i>Windsong Testaments</i>—parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>

                <p>One thing I’ve seen a lot of conversation about on the forums is how long it might take for the organized play campaign to go back to adventuring in Tian Xia. The answer, as I’m sure you’ve just guessed, is about this long, plus one week! Veteran author Christopher Wasko takes us back in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021ce?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-106-Lost-on-the-Spirit-Road">Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-06: Lost on the Spirit Road</a>, a Tier 1-4 repeatable scenario. The Pathfinders head over the Crown of the World towards the nation of Goka, where Venture-Captain Amara Li needs some help tracking down a shipment that seems to have gone missing along the Spirit Road, a narrow trade route skirting the Forest of Spirits. I’d love to be able to tell you more, but as a 4-hour-long repeatable adventure, the numerous randomized elements mean even I can’t tell you exactly what your adventure might look like! Perhaps this enterprising kitsune can give you some advice, assuming he’s an ally this time around…</p>

                <p>Our next scenario is a bit closer to the Grand Lodge. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021cf?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-107-Flooded-Kings-Court">Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-07: Flooded King’s Court</a>, author Brian Duckwitz takes us to the Puddles district of Absalom for a visit with royalty. Goblin King Zusgut claimed a ruined “castle” that sits atop even older ruins. Unfortunately, the things occupying those ruins seem less than thrilled to have a goblin “kingdom” growing over their heads, and now Zusgut is looking for some enterprising explorers to go search and clear the passages beneath his royal abode. Venture-Captain Drandle Dreng looks to get on Zusgut’s good side and calls upon his Pathfinder associates to assist. With a steady hand like Dreng’s guiding the mission and a heroic ally like Zusgut, what could possibly go wrong?</p>

In days of yore, the mighty Ulfen warrior Grehunde the Sunchaser earned fame and glory in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. The only goal she yearned for but never achieved was to end her days in the Ulfen holy land of Valenhall. Her descendant, Hlavard, sought to honor her wish by taking Grehunde’s famed magical gorget on his own journey to Valenhall, but his ship was lost somewhere in the waters between Avistan and Arcadia. Now, Hlavard’s surviving family has reached out to the Pathfinder Society for assistance in locating the shipwreck and retrieving the family heirloom.</p>

                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021cg?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-209-Bluerise-Breakout">Starfinder Society #2-09: Bluerise Breakout</a> by Paizo’s own Jason Tondro, is a Tier 1-4 scenario that takes a relatively small location and turns it into a dangerous situation. Reversing the trope of breaking into an office, Bluerise Breakout has the PCs suddenly cut off from the outside world (errrr... outside Absalom Station?) and forced to escape the high-security systems employed in an office. Building on the ongoing story arcs for Season 2, Bluerise Breakout also harkens back to some old scenarios like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-101-The-Commencement">Starfinder Society #1-01: The Commencement</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wlk?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-133-Data-Breach">Starfinder Society #1-33: Data Breach</a>. Jason went above and beyond with this scenario, and I think it’ll go down as one of our more memorable low-level scenarios.</p>

This quest pack addresses a question that Organized Play Manager Tonya Woldridge asked in almost every Organized Play meeting I attended for my first year of working at Paizo: “Where does the Society get its money from?” Well, in <i>Corporate Interests</i>, we answer that question! The PCs take a break from Starfinder missions and work on the Society’s behalf to help various Pact Worlds corporations in a variety of different ways to earn the Society some much-needed credits. From corporate espionage, equipment testing, and even a bit of cleanup duty, this quest pack provides players and GMs with a variety of stories in small bite-sized chunks!</p> 
                <p>Also, how about we start testing some potential new Starfinder Society starships!</p>

                </div> 
                <p>You’re going to notice that this Chronicle sheet is a bit different. It doesn’t specify a Tier, and the rewards are a bit different than we’ve structured them in the past. There’s also only a single Chronicle sheet, which is a hair different than you may have seen in past modules. So, here’s the explanation for all of that. We want you to have more stuff that you can play and use in PFS, and we want to get it to you quickly. We also want you to get sanctioned materials faster than has happened in the past.</p> 
                <p>Flashback to when I joined the organized play team two years ago. At that time, additional resources sanctioning was 15 months out and we had 10-year-old adventure paths that had never been sanctioned. Priorities always focused on scenarios first, convention items second, and sanctioning third. A lot of my early work in the department involved shrinking those numbers and getting materials in player’s hands faster. That was going pretty well right up until around June of this year, when the mad dash towards Gen Con began. The triple hit of increased scenario production, launch of a new edition, and John Compton moving to the Starfinder team took its toll on our workflow. Linda stepped up as organized play lead developer, which meant that she has less bandwidth to help me out with scenario development and so sanctioning slowed down. But it’s important to note, it never stopped. The team spent chunks of our weekly meeting since mid-August looking at ways to get materials sanctioned for use faster and let GMs and players take the shiny modules and Adventure Path (AP) volumes they’ve been buying and use the treasures presented therein with their organized play characters. We also fielded some concerns from other departments about the way we had been sanctioning modules and adventure paths, and those concerns happened to sync up with some of our own scheduling and production issues.</p> 
                <p>Traditionally, the sanctioning process for an AP or module required a developer to read the entire adventure path or module, figure out a way to cut the material down to about 12 hours per module or volume without making the story indecipherable, and then create the guidelines for that new play window and the various Chronicle sheets that go along with it. This is a pretty time-consuming process and must wait until all publication of all volumes in the Adventure Path. It’s part of why you’re getting Fall of Plaguestone before the final two PF1 adventure paths (which we’re absolutely still working on sanctioning for those of you still enjoying the PF1 organized play campaign). Fall of Plaguestone represents a new adventure sanctioning model that we <i>hope</i> is going to be something you’ll enjoy, and which will allow us to sanction much faster than we have in the past. The Chronicle sheet gives you access to all of the approved treasures and other goodies presented in the module, one level’s worth of experience for a character of your choice, and gold appropriate to a character of that level.</p> 
                <p>“One level?” you ask. Yep. This Chronicle is set up so that you can play Fall of Plaguestone as it was intended to be played, with a non-PFS character of the appropriate level, level up with that character when the module expects you to, and then when the adventure is complete, take that Chronicle sheet and apply it to any of your Pathfinder (second edition) organized play characters, giving them a level up, a hefty bag of loot, and access to all kinds of uncommon goodies. If this works, we’re going to do the same thing for Age of Ashes, and it’ll mean we can do it a lot faster. We need your feedback on our system to know if this will be the model going forward, so please post commentary below for our team to review.</p> 
                <p>We realize that this might not be the ideal solution for everyone. Some of you want that streamlined adventure with bits cut out to make it fit in a two or three-block convention schedule. Our current understanding of our player demographics is that those of you looking for thus trimmed versions are both a very small percentage of the player base, but also some of our most dedicated players. Ideally, we’d like everyone to get the full adventure experience as the author intended, but we also don’t want those of you who enjoy those convention marathon playthroughs to feel like you got the short end of the stick. Our potential solution involves adding a section to the <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/encyclopedia/pfs2guide/">organized play guide</a> discussing convention play and providing tips to GMs and organizers on how to run these adventures in a way that fits into your slots and would still allow you to receive and issue Chronicle sheets for completing the playthrough. If that feels like a solution you think will work for you and the way you play, please let me know in the comments below! This program exists for you, our community, and we want to find the version of this that works best for everyone. We cannot do this without comments, so please add your viewpoints on our sanctioning ideas to the thread below.</p> 
                <p>Next week, join us for scenario previews for both Pathfinder and Starfinder. Thank you all, and until next time, Explore, Report, and Cooperate!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Have you heard? The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Lost Omens Character Guide</a> is available now at your local gaming store and here on paizo.com! If you haven’t had a chance to check out what kind of awesome content shows up in the book, take some time to check out <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/lostOmensCharacterGuide">blog posts</a> from the past weeks. All of those posts cover the cool content for ancestries and organizations, but there’s one more section of the book we wanted to show off. However, rather than just giving a typical preview, we wanted to show the book in action and have you, fine readers, follow along at home!</p> 
                <p>The final section of the Character Guide is an NPC gallery showcasing individuals from the five organizations featured in the book. Each organization receives two different NPCs: a standard, rank and file member and a higher ranking member. The standard member is a level 4 NPC and include the likes of Hellknight armigers and Magaambya adepts. The higher ranking members are level 11 NPCs, such as the veteran reclaimer of the Knights of Lastwall and Pathfinder Venture-Captains. We present a generic stat block to represent each of these NPCs, but my fellow developer Eleanor Ferro also took some time to present a sample personality to attach to each of the stat blocks so they are ready to go for your own games. The Venture-Captain, for example, is Khoumrock Blackthane, explorer extraordinaire! (We like to call him Captain Octo-boots around these parts.)</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102219_VentureCaptain.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102219_VentureCaptain_500.jpeg" alt="A male dwarf in heavy armor encrusted with barnacles that appears to be retrofitted as a deep-sea diving suit, wielding a huge warhammer in both hands and ignoring the small red octopus wrapped around his left ankle."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>These stat blocks are great, but what if you need stats for one of the other prominent organizations in the Inner Sea? Or, what if you need a Hellknight that’s level 7 or a very powerful Magaambyan mage that’s level 16? Well, the final section of the NPC gallery has you covered! This section provides a new addition to the rules: theme templates. Much like the elite and weak adjustments featured in the Bestiary, these templates are simple adjustments that you can apply to any NPC or monster to give them appropriate abilities that match the flavor of a specific theme. In this case, these theme templates help you create new creatures that are members of the various organizations featured in this book.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102219_ThemeTemplate.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102219_ThemeTemplate.png" alt="Bellflower Network. Members of the Bellflower Network fight against slavery where they can, liberating slaves and helping those in need."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>While the Character Guide goes into much greater detail, the basics are that you take an existing creature, take a look at its level and apply all of the template’s abilities to the stat block. The higher level the creature, the more abilities it receives. We recommend that you take a look at the final stat block to determine whether or not the creature has grown in power with its additional abilities and adjust its level accordingly. (The recently released <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021ct?Gamemastery-Guide-Monster-and-Hazard-Creation">rules for creating creatures</a> will be big help here!) With these abilities, you should be able to quickly take any existing stat block and adjust it to the flavor you need. This might be as simple as taking a thief and making them an Aspis Consortium smuggler or something more bizarre like a Pathfinder yeti! We even have a list of different monsters that would be a good fit for each theme template to encourage some more monstrous members for your games.</p> 
                <p>Of course, I can tell you all the cool things you can do, but it’s more fun to show you! I’ve taken some of the theme templates and monsters from the Bestiary to show you the final results. Each of the following stats has had both the theme template and elite adjustment applied to them. For the most part, they should look the same as the stats you’re used to seeing in the Bestiary, but they each have some tweaks here and there to accommodate the template. The centaur has swapped from a longsword to a halberd and learned Infernal as part of her Hellknight training and I spell out some of the new abilities on the dragon’s stat block.</p> 
                <p>Hopefully you get a lot of mileage out of these stats and the theme templates themselves! I’m a big fan of the templates and I’m sure they’ll show up here and there in the Lost Omens line where they make sense, so keep an eye out for them! And with that, we can finally close the book on the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Lost Omens Character Guide</a>. If any of what you’ve seen here has looked interesting, I recommend checking it out. Keep an eye on this blog, though, as there are always more books on the way! I hear the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zqa?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic">next one</a> is going to be <i>divine</i>. So, without further ado, let’s look at those monsters!</p> 
                <h2>Gwynimar Altiraan</h2> 
                <p>Taken in at a young age by Maidrayne Vox, the Mistress of Blades at Citadel Vraid, Gwynimar recalls very little of her youth. What memories she has are of grueling hours training on the crags of the Mindspin Mountains. Maidrayne remains the only person she maintains any kind of relationship as the rest of the Order of the Nail look upon Gwynimar with disdain. It’s of no matter to Gwynimar, however, as the Measure and the Chain come first and stand above all. Gwynimar’s training will soon be complete and once the Mistress of Blades unleashes her from Vraid, Gwynimar will be swift in bringing order to frontier beyond.</p>

                <h2>Philannia</h2> 
                <p>Philannia’s search for the greater secrets of life soon led her to seek out the means of achieving immortality. In this search she found herself following Urgathoa, as the Pallid Princess’s promises of eternal indulgence through undeath sang to Philannia’s heart in ways that nothing else did. During one of her prayers, Philannia caught sight of a great explosion to the north. She soon learned that the explosion caused the creation of countless undead and saw it as a sign form Urgathoa. Philannia struck out toward the sight of the omen and found agents of the Whispering Way. Here were the agents of Urgathoa herself, ready to take her in and teach Philannia their secrets…</p>

                <h2>Karthival of the Vibrant Wave</h2> 
                <p>Even into his older age, Karthival was always on the lookout for more opportunities to revel and delight in the joys of the world. Unfortunately for him, the sight of a dragon typically puts off most that approach him. When the Vibrant Wave, a Firebrand ship, sailed neared his lair in northeast Rahadoum, Karthival reached out to the curious ship. While there was some initial fear with Karthival’s appearance, the crew quickly took a liking to him and invited him to tag along in their adventures. Now Karthival flies alongside the ship on its countless journeys, joining them in their escapades and reliving the excitement of his younger years.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Though I’ve seen all four of the quick-start characters in action, Lini’s the one that I’ve been playing through the <i>Core Set</i> adventures, and so this strategizing has all been firsthand. I’ve discovered that she’s a more nuanced character than she was in the original Pathfinder Adventure Card Game sets: better balanced, and so requiring more thoughtful play. Which is all for the best: the classic Lini made everything a bit too easy.</p> 
                <p>So here are my thoughts on playing Lini, the second of the Quick-Start characters from the <i>Core Set</i>—and here’s some discussion on what “invoking the Animal trait” <i>really</i> means. You’ve very likely got it wrong: we did for our first few games, before I sat down to write this.</p> 
                <p>Once again, you can see <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgy0?Core-Design-Lini">Keith Richmond’s article</a> on Lini for more on how the character has evolved.</p>

                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreLiniFront.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreLiniFront_360.jpeg" alt="Lini, Character 0, Gnome Druid."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreLiniBack.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreLiniBack_360.jpeg" alt="Lini, Character 0. Lini is a friend to all the savage beasts of the forest, soothing their hungers and redirecting their baser instincts. With her snow leopard Droogami nearby, she collects sticks from every forest she has visited, a wooden road map of her travels; should she settle down, they may become a house."></a> 
                </div> 
                <h3>Core Set Lini</h3> 
                <p><b>Best Skill:</b> Wisdom (d10)</p> 
                <p><b>Character Type:</b> Warrior, Healer, Divine</p> 
                <p><b><i>Skills.</i></b> Lini only has three “subskills”—Divine, Perception, and Survival—but they’re all under her d10 skill, Wisdom. Of those skills, Perception and Survival are the rarest, being featured on only three <i>Core Set</i> characters each. Harsk has both of them (along with Fortitude and Ranged), making them a somewhat poor pairing for an adventuring party, due to the overlap.</p> 
                <p><i>Weaknesses.</i> Lini’s biggest weakness is her d4 Strength. Given that she also lacks Melee and Ranged skills, and starts with just one weapon card, she could end up rolling a horrible d4 in combat… if not for her “wild shape” ability: the power that lets her recharge or bury a card to use Survival + 1d4 instead. So this weakness isn’t nearly as problematic as it is for other d4 Strength characters, such as Lem.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Cards.</i></b> Besides having just a single Weapon, Lini is also short on items (1) and blessings (2). The latter means that she’ll have to find other ways to explore multiple times—a critical ability for all characters. Allies (5) are her best option: she should make sure to collect allies that permit exploration... provided that they have the Animal trait.</p>

                <p><i>Allies.</i> Lini should collect Animals!! (For more, see below.)</p> 
                <p><i>Blessings.</i> Nethys’s blessings are probably the best for Lini, as they can bless her Wisdom (and so Divine, Perception, and Survival). Alternatively, Erastil will bless just her Survival.</p> 
                <p><i>Spells.</i> Because Lini has both a Divine proficiency and plenty of ability to do damage via means other than spells (namely, her wild shape power), she should stock up on healing spells; this will make her one of the strongest healers in a party, overshadowed only by someone like Kyra, who has a healing-oriented power feat. Take special note of Aspect of the Monkey, the only Animal spell in the <i>Core Set.</i></p> 
                <p><i>Weapons.</i> Lini needs to watch for Dexterity weapons that do not require proficiency. Her starting Dagger actually isn’t bad, since it can be recharged for 2d4. Crossbows are another good choice.</p> 
                <h3>The Power of Animals</h3> 
                <p>Lini’s best powers center around the use of Animal allies, which serve a variety of purposes. That is why you want to fill her ally slots with Animals (which is how her default deck is laid out) and advance to the max of 7 ally cards as quickly as possible.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Take +1d4 to Animal Invocations as Your First Power Feat</i></b>. Of Lini’s three basic powers, the best is obviously the +1d4 to local checks that invoke the Animal trait. This can be used whenever she activates her wild shape power, whenever she acquires an Animal, whenever she fights an Animal, whenever she plays an Animal to determine the skill she’s using, and whenever her friends at the same location do these same things. It’s very versatile, and it’s a cooperative power. (In contrast, her least useful power is the one that lets her discard instead of bury when using wild shape with a non-Animal card. That’s a desperate last resort, so no need to make it cheaper.)</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p><i>Clarification: What Invokes the Animal Trait?</i> The “invoke” rule is one of the most confusing in the PACG. Page 9 of the Core Set rules tersely defines it by saying: “A check invokes a trait if it has or is against a card that has that trait. A card invokes a trait if it has that trait. A bane also invokes a trait if it deals only damage of the type that matches that trait.”</p> 
                 <p>This means that the skill you’re using invokes its traits, as do any it references (e.g., Wisdom and Survival are invoked if Lini uses her “Survival: Wisdom +3” skill) and the card you’re facing invokes all of its traits (e.g., Acid and Animal when you’re trying to acquire a Giant Slug, and Poison and Animal when you’re fighting a Giant Toad). Then there’s the special case of a bane adding an exclusive damage type as a trait. And <i>that’s it</i>.</p> 
                 <p>Well, that’s mostly it. Two more special cases appear on page 11 of the <i>Core Set</i> rules: you always add your character’s trait (e.g., Lini always adds Gnome and Druid), and you add the traits of a card you play <i>if and only</i> if it’s a “For your … check” card, like most weapons and Attack spells, which essentially replaces your skill with a card (e.g., when Lini plays a Deathbane Light Crossbow for a combat check, she would invoke Bow, Ranged, Piercing, and Magic).</p> 
                 <p>There’s one last situation when traits are invoked: if a card, power, or scenario rule specifically says to add traits as part of its special effect text (e.g., Lini’s wild shape ability explicitly invokes the Animal trait).</p> 
                 <p>Here’s a chart of all the traits that are actually invoked during a check:</p> 
                 <table width="800" border="1" style="margin: 1rem 0"> 
                  <thead style="text-align:left;"> 
                   <tr> 
                    <th>Player Invokes</th> 
                    <th>Challenge Invokes</th> 
                   </tr> 
                  </thead> 
                  <tbody> 
                   <tr>
                    <td>Character Traits</td>
                    <td>Oppositional Card Traits</td>
                   </tr> 
                   <tr>
                    <td>Skills Used or Referenced</td>
                    <td>Exclusive Damage Type</td>
                   </tr> 
                   <tr>
                    <td>“For Your … Check” Card Traits</td>
                    <td>Special Effect Traits</td>
                   </tr> 
                   <tr>
                    <td>Effect </td>
                    <td></td>
                   </tr> 
                  </tbody> 
                 </table> 
                 <p>Note what’s <i>not</i> included here: you don’t invoke the traits of cards played into a check <i>other</i> than a “For your … check” card or the oppositional card. So, if someone plays a support spell like Aid or even Venom Blast in a support role, it doesn’t invoke its traits; if someone plays a blessing, it doesn’t invoke its traits; and most tragically, if Lini plays a support Animal, it doesn’t invoke the Animal trait (or anything else).</p>

Animal, Acid."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p><b><i>Use Wild Shape.</i></b> Lini’s best combat ability is her wild shape, which allows her to bury a card or recharge an Animal ally to fight at Survival + 1d4 + the card’s level. This has a starting value of 1d10 + 3 + 1d4 + card level, for a range of 5–17 + card level and an average of 11 + card level. Compare that to her starting Dagger at Dexterity + 1d4 (+1d4 if recharged), which is 1d8 + 1d4 (+1d4). That totals 2–12 (3–16 if recharged) or an average of 7 (9.5 if recharged).</p> 
                <p>Not only is the wild shape better, but it’s easier to pump up, with the +1d4 power feat immediately improving its range to 6–21 + card level and its average to 13.5 + card level. Keep an eye out for anything that could improve your Wisdom or Survival, making wild shaping even better (and note that you can always add in your Hide Armor to give yourself another +3 to combat by double-adding your Survival modifier).</p> 
                <p>Obviously, you always want to recharge Animals, not bury cards, to invoke wild shape. Recharging helps to cycle your deck, while burying cards thins it and makes you more vulnerable. (Here’s another reason to recharge Animals: you can happily declare “I turn into a giant slug” as you play the appropriate card.)</p> 
                <p><b><i>Collect the Right Animals.</i></b> Consider carefully if you want Lini to be a combat monster or more versatile; this should largely depend on the composition of the rest of your party. If you want Lini to be one of your main fighters, collect Animals like Droogami and Riding Allosaurus, which can add to her combat stats. If you want Lini to be more versatile, then instead go for Animals that add to other skills, like the Raccoon that adds to Dexterity or Disable. In the latter case, you’ll <i>still</i> be recharging the Animals to wild shape, but during the narrow window that they’re in your hand, you might be able to use them for something else instead. (But don’t hold onto an Animal for a specific non-combat check unless you <i>know</i> it’s in your near future, such as a check to close your location. Else, you’ll just be clogging your hand when you could be cycling it.) Whichever the case: collect Animal allies exclusively and improve them as quickly as you can. Lini should <i>never</i> have non-Animal allies, not even seductive Loot allies.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreRoleWildWhisperer.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreRoleWildWhisperer_360.jpeg" alt="Lini, Role 0.

World Walker. The world is her cloister."></a> 
                </div> 
                <h3>The Lini Roles</h3> 
                <p>Overall, the Wild Whisperer seems like the role that builds better on Lini’s innate abilities, but World Walker is a nice alternative if healing or movement are missing from your party.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Wild Whisperer.</i></b> This role improves Lini’s already great power of Animals, allowing her to bring both her wild shape and her Animal invoke bonus up from +1d4 to +1d6 and also allowing her to heal Animal cards (albeit at the cost of something else). That makes it a good choice if you’ve been able to build out Lini’s Animal allies well. The ability to turn Strength into a d10 offsets Lini’s main deficit, which is good if it’s been causing you problems (and the fact that you recharge a card to do so makes this power even better, because that can again help you cycle cards that were clogging your hand). Finally, the power feats that add Acrobatics and Fortitude skills are nice if they’ve been lacking in your party. (That’s more likely for Acrobatics, as it appears on only three Core Set characters.)</p> 
                <p><b><i>World Walker.</i></b> This role is much more defensive, giving Lini elemental defenses and the ability to remove scourges. If your party is light on healing for either damage or scourges, this might be a good choice. Meanwhile, the ability to move at the end of a turn is nice if your party is missing Amiri—see the upcoming fourth article in this series for why that’s great!</p>

                <p>But do not let any deceive you that beauty and horror are equals. One need not endure the pain of rent flesh to marvel at the glitter of a finely-honed blade, nor should you be forced to endure the ache of loneliness just to enjoy the peace of solitude.

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Alberto Dal Lago</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>In those earliest of days, long before the first of us dreamed our mortal dreams, the gods were still young and they still had much to learn. The worlds of worlds had yet to hang in the firmament, and the First of those Worlds was still being woven as Desna drifted, dreaming and delighting, through the In-Between.</p> 
                <p>In that time, the Ethereal Plane was no Ghost World, for no lives had yet been lost to mortal souls. Nor was it a Space Between Spaces, for the worlds of reality had yet to be forged. It was first, and yet remains, the In-Between. A place not fully dreaming, yet neither fully awake. Such sights Desna beheld In-Between tugged at her heart and would inspire her in time to light Cynosure itself at the heart of the Cosmic Caravan.</p> 
                <p>And so when, in her rapturous wanderings, the Song of the Spheres came across a glistening shape drifting alone, she became entranced. Here was a splendid ovoid of shimmering silken strands, each twined length sliding and singing against its kin and bright with more colors than any mortal eye would ever behold. Desna could see that the shape was a shroud of woven lengths, yet the strings had no beginning and no end, as if it had simply formed at once as a single impossibly tangled length.</p> 
                <p>Desna was not content to simply look upon the shape, and so she settled upon it. It was warm to the touch, and its smooth surface compelled the hand to slide along its pleasing textures. And as she held the shape, she knew it was but a covering, a shroud that held an even greater wonder within. What mysterious marvel lay shielded from view by those few thin layers of silk? What unbeheld revelation waited within this strange traveler through the flickering void? Desna knew of the brutality of evil and the rancor of wrath, for such awfulness has existed from the beginning. She knew, even as she tugged at the strands and worried at the weave, that something this entrancing could also be something equally awful, yet she paid those nagging thoughts no mind.</p> 
                <p>She opened the Gossamer King’s cocoon, and as Ghlaunder emerged, Desna knew sorrow and regret for the first time.</p> 
                <p>Ghlaunder crawled from quiescence: eyes and mouths—eyes that were mouths; legs and tongues—legs that were tongues; hunger and hate—hunger that was hate. Ghlauder seized upon the Song of the Spheres. She brushed aside those starving stalks and slashing teeth, yet more were there to vex voraciously, for Ghlaunder had waited for eons, and in eons, hunger has much time to compel. As Ghlaunder fed in desperate gulps, as it glutted upon Desna’s divine grace, its wings unfurled and there Desna beheld glory again. For the Gossamer King’s iridescent wings held the same shimmering beauty that had caught Desna’s eye before his wakening.</p> 
                <p>Desna could not bring herself to destroy Ghlaunder, yet she knew he was a great hunger whose presence would bring pain and suffering. And so Desna drew upon her might and banished Ghlaunder from the In-Between, and the Gossamer King was hurled from the Inner Sphere to fester far beyond within the Outer Rifts, a place more accepting of his countenance now that his shroud had been forever torn.</p> 
                <p>Desna left the In-Between soon after, and in the creation of the worlds of worlds, she would find much more to remind her of the beauty of reality, yet always the Gossamer King’s lesson remained. Even in great beauty could dwell great horror—and in great horror one might find great beauty.</p> 
                <p>The Gossamer King lives still. His faithful infest the neglected cracks of society, and they see the face of god in the rasping kiss of the chewing maggot or the thirsty work of the supping leech. Yet do not doctors use maggots to save the living from gangrenous wounds? Have not physicians used leeches to reduce the swelling of inflamed flesh?</p> 
                <p>Desna’s faithful are not alone in the constant fight against the cults of those like the Gossamer King, but Desna today is the first to point to her mistake of releasing this evil into reality not as something to be ashamed of. It was a chance to learn. It is always better to live, to make mistakes, and accept the challenges discovered as opportunities to grow, to teach, and to do better than to suppress and forget.</p> 
                <p>And while the sight of a devotee of Ghlaunder clad in the faith’s most sacred raiment—a thousand thousand sucking mosquitos worn together as robes—certainly turns the stomach, is there not something of beauty in how each of those gossamer wings shines back the twinkling starlight from the night skies above?</p>

                <p>James Jacobs is the Creative Director for Pathfinder. While he was there at the beginning of Golarion’s creation, many of the deities worshiped by that world’s heroes and villains had already existed for decades before. Goddesses and gods like Desna and Rovagug, Sarenrae and Abadar, Achaekek and Zon-Kuthon first established their faithful among PCs and NPCs alike in James’ home campaign in the late 80s and early 90s. Sharing them with the world as deities of the Pathfinder setting, seeing players and creators come to love and hate them (and in some cases cosplay as them), has been a career highlight.</p> 
                <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px">About the Windsong Testaments</p> 
                <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the <i>Windsong Testaments</i>—parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>

                <p>We be the goblins of the Mindsharp tribe! We be a very smarty and friendly group. Months ago, goblin-friends Jason Keeley and Joe Pasini friends ask us to help make puzzles for annual Pie-zoh-kahn Puzzle Hunt! We be happy to lend our brains to help, though some Mindsharps still not sure about written word. They gave us instructions for each puzzle to make, and we think we followed most of them!</p> 
                <p>Now it your turn to test your smartyness against Mindsharps! Read magic blue words below for puzzle hunt! No prize for solving, but if you come to our village, we can teach you new game as reward! It involve square wood board, rock playing pieces, pickles (for snacking), and barrel of flammable tar. We still need to figure out best way to bury goblin who win, but it still very fun game!</p>

                <p><b>What is a puzzle hunt?</b><br>A puzzle hunt is a series of linked puzzles, with the answer to each being a word or phrase. Those words and phrases are used in a larger puzzle to generate the hunt's final solution. Figuring out how that puzzle works is part of the challenge!</p> 
                <p><b>Who made this, anyway?</b><br>Mostly a bunch of goblins, but Jason Keeley and Joe Pasini helped. However, none of them could have done it without the aid of Art Director Sonja Morris, who created all of the puzzle hunt's outstanding graphics!</p> 
                <p><b>What do I do if get stuck?</b><br>First, put the puzzle down and come back at it in an hour or so with a fresh mind. Perhaps you'll spot something you hadn't seen before. Be sure to reread the instructions at the top of the page; sometimes clues are hidden in there! If all that fails, feel free to ask for a hint on the Paizo.com forums. There's no shame in getting a nudge from a fellow solver, and perhaps you can help her in return with a different puzzle!</p> 
                <p><b>Where can I find more like this?</b><br>Good question! You can download the first and second PaizoCon Puzzle Hunts here!<br><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkc0?I-Want-to-Play-a-Game">https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkc0?I-Want-to-Play-a-Game</a><br><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkyh?Riddle-Me-This">https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkyh?Riddle-Me-This</a></p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description"><b>This article appeared in the August Issue of Meeples Monthly. We are pleased to present it to you now.</b></p> 
                <p>Putting together <i>Alien Archive 3</i>, the third volume of the Starfinder roleplaying game’s science-fantasy counterpart to the bestiaries of fantasy games, carried with it plenty of challenges. Not least of these was carrying through on the promise of the successful formula established by the previous two volumes: scores of aliens, each with a two-page spread and plenty of art, all accompanied by a raft of player options, such as gear, feats, and a bunch of alien species that player characters can use to build their own characters. But <i>Alien Archive 3</i> also has quite a few things going for it that make it a lot more than just another book of weird and wonderful aliens.</p> 
                <p>First and foremost, more than half of the authors of this book are women, non-binary people, or from other groups traditionally underrepresented in the mainstream roleplaying game community (both in terms of bylines and storylines). The diverse perspectives of this pool of authors shine through brilliantly in the final book, and it was my great pleasure to work with all of its authors, whose experience ranged from 20-year veterans to first-time writers for Starfinder. Several authors also helped achieve this representation, asking to take fewer writing assignments, or even none at all, to ensure that others could have the opportunity to contribute.</p> 
                <p>Speaking of authorship, I had the pleasure—and pain—of writing Starfinder’s new creature companion system for <i>Alien Archive 3</i>. The process was a thrill ride of flow charts, tables upon tables (upon tables!) of statistics, and frantic loophole-closing. Fortunately, Starfinder Design Lead Owen K.C. Stephens and Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton were on the case during development. They helped shape the system into its final form, which lets Starfinder player characters pal around the galaxy with a dinosaur mount, an empathic spider friend, a laser-wolf pup—just to name a few. I sought John’s consultation in particular, as he views our products from an Organized Play perspective and can anticipate the needs of that robust player base (along with some of the exploits they might have otherwise found).</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/101519_CreatureCompanion.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/101519_CreatureCompanion_500.jpeg" alt="An armored human branding a pistol directs his companion, an orange tiger-like creature with two pairs of eyes."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Raphael Madureira</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>And that same player base made its own contributions to this book! One of the most popular aliens introduced in our Starfinder Society adventures are morlamaws, who can be briefly described as brightly colored space walruses with four tusks and a rich culture. The charismatic creatures were an instant hit with the community, especially since players can create their own morlamaw characters, so they were a shoo-in for an expanded treatment in <i>Alien Archive 3</i>. They were originally brought to life by author Kate Baker, a prolific game master and Starfinder Society volunteer, and we were lucky to have her back to flesh morlamaws out for a full entry in this book.</p> 
                <p>One of the aliens I’m most excited to share with the wider world is the cephalume, a bioluminescent squid-like alien that hails from the liquid-methane seas of its home planet and has a symbiotic relationship with its barnacles. But I love the origin of this creature even more than its fascinating physiology. At last year’s PaizoCon, our company’s annual convention, we held two alien-design panels, during which we collaborated with the attending audience to create a brand new alien, all while artist guest of honor Taylor Fischer sketched out our ideas on a projector. When it came time to name the creature, an audience member suggested the name cephalume, which was an instant lock. Months later, when writing the outline for <i>Alien Archive 3</i>, I knew we had to include the cephalume, and I knew who to ask to write it: the audience member who’d named it, Jessica Redekop! Jessica did a great job making a marginally plausible creature into a fascinating alien—and especially adventurous players can choose to play as one. We were even able to send Taylor’s fantastic sketches as reference material to artist Nathanael James, who rendered a captivating pair of cephalumes that made me love them even more.</p>

                <p>Along with morlamaws and cephalumes, <i>Alien Archive 3</i> presents 18 species that players can use when creating their own characters, bringing the total count of playable alien species in Starfinder to more than 100! Notable new options are playable undead creatures and a playable sentient swarm of insects. This incredible total is a concrete sign of our efforts to give Starfinder a galaxy-spanning cantina feel… but there’s no way we’re stopping there! One of the best parts of creating a book full of new creatures is giving life to things that were single-sentence throwaways in previous books—and seeding new single-sentence throwaways for the future…</p>

                </div> 
                <h3>Core Set Sajan</h3> 
                <p><b>Best Skill:</b> Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom (d8)<br><b>Character Type:</b> Warrior, Melee, possibly Ranged</p> 
                <p><b><i>Skills.</i></b> Sajan has the smallest skill range of any <i>Core Set</i> character. He has no d4s, no d10s, and no d12s: half of his skills are d6s and half are d8s. That small range isn’t even made up for by his subskills: though he has four of them (Acrobatics, Fortitude, Melee, and Perception), he’s only +1 or +2 in each. In the end, his only real standout skill is Acrobatics, his highest at 1d8+2, and which one of his powers allows him to easily buff with blessings. Despite the lack of high skills, Sajan’s lack of low skills means that he can be your go-to guy for any task that your party is relatively unskilled at: though a d6 isn’t great, it’s better than a d4! Sajan overlaps two skills with Harsk (Fortitude and Perception), so they may not be the best choice to combine in a party.</p> 
                <p><i>Weaknesses.</i> Sajan’s weakness is writ large in this description: he’s great at nothing. His best skill, Acrobatics, has a range of 3–10 (averaging 6.5). Compare that to a less combat-focused d12 character like Seoni, who has a range of 3–14 (averaging 8.5) in both Arcane and Diplomacy. </p> 
                <p>So how does Sajan overcome this deficit? By blessing <i>everything</i>.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Cards.</i></b> Sajan’s best card type is unsurprisingly blessings (7, which he can and should quickly pump up to 8, 9, and 10). This unfortunately means that he doesn’t get fun and evocative allies or spells, but it plays to Sajan’s greatest advantage: the power of blessings. Because Sajan won’t usually be using blessings for exploration, he’ll need to depend on his allies (3) for that and may alternatively decide to increase the count of that card type. Sajan’s biggest card weakness is probably his lack of armors (0), a problem that can be resolved some by his damage-reduction power feat (and even more by his Exiled Padaprajna role).</p>

                </div> 
                <p><i>Allies.</i> Sajan’s allies must allow him to explore! Secondarily, they should be rechargeable to improve his best skills. As an example: the Archer, Mouse, and Raccoon are good choices because they allow exploration and can be recharged to improve Dexterity.</p> 
                <p><i>Blessings.</i> Sajan should be very picky about which blessings he takes. Cards that allow him to freely bless his own skills don’t do much for him, given his innate ability to freely bless his combat or Acrobatics. Thus, he needs to look more carefully for blessings that will benefit his best skills in other ways, such as Erastil’s “Old Deadeye”, which allows him to bless his Dexterity twice. Alternatively, Sajan can try and use his blessings to become less selfish, a problem created by his second power. In particularly, he might look for blessings that can be recharged when played on <i>other</i> members of the party: the humble Orison is thus a pretty good blessing for Sajan, as are the Asmodeus blessings and some level 3 blessings.</p> 
                <p><i>Weapons.</i> Sajan’s weapon skills will likely fall behind his unarmed combat (his first power) over time. That means that his weapons should be fallbacks that he uses if he can’t afford to recharge a card for his first power. That means that he needs weapons that are pretty good <i>without</i> having to discard them: swords (which reload) are a good <i>Core Set</i> choice. Of course, if Sajan can get higher-level weapons that use Acrobatics as their skill, that’s the best. The Quarterstaff of Vaulting and the Lucky Starknife and probably Sajan’s favored options in the <i>Core Set.</i></p> 
                <h3>The Power of Blessings</h3> 
                <p>Sajan’s biggest advantage is certainly his paired powers that allow him to recharge his own blessings and to freely use some blessings on combat or Acrobatics checks.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Bless Extensively.</i></b> Because Sajan recharges all blessings that he uses on his own checks, he should use them quite freely. Most characters will save their blessings for the most important rolls against banes, but Sajan can (and should) expend them for things like attempting difficult acquisitions. In fact, he should empty his hand of blessings just about every turn: they’ll come back.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Beware of Blessing Explores.</i></b> Sajan’s blessings recharge power only works when he plays them on his checks, not when he uses them to explore. Thus, he should be very wary of using blessings in that way: it takes blessings out of his deck, ultimately making Sajan less powerful. Instead, depend on allies for extra explores.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Be Selfish.</i></b> Similarly, Sajan should be pretty reluctant to use his blessings on other players, because those also don’t return to his deck. Of course, PACG is a cooperative game, so he might occasionally have to help his fellows anyway—which is why he should look for blessings that can recharge in that circumstance. The other option for offsetting Sajan’s selfishness is using his blessings on himself… to get cool stuff for his friends.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Create a Blessing Machine.</i></b> Feel free to discard Sajan’s weapons, items, and allies for their special effects. If he ends up with a deck of all blessings, then he can play through them each and every turn. (This doesn’t necessarily result in “Maximum Game Fun,” but it does result in “Maximum Sajan Efficiency;” balance the two as appropriate for your own enjoyment and that of your group.) Do be aware, however, that Sajan will be riding a thin line when he does this. A starting Sajan with a hand size of five will have a draw deck of only two if he empties his deck to just his seven blessings, and that means that death might lie too near. Increasing the number of blessings in Sajan’s deck and/or choosing a few additional cards to cycle, to bring his minimum deck size up to 10, will make him less vulnerable and is suggested.</p> 
                <p>An old, degenerate strategy involved starting all the characters at the same place as Sajan, then having the other characters each give Sajan a blessing. This isn’t particularly recommended. It’s less effective than it was in the previous PACG releases because Sajan is limited to using a maximum of three blessings at a time, and it dramatically decreases the Maximum Game Fun not just for Sajan, but for everyone.</p> 
                <h3>The Power of Kung Fu</h3> 
                <p>Sajan can be a notable combatant even without using a weapon.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Fight Unarmed.</i></b> With his unarmed combat power, Sajan can recharge any card to fight at Acrobatics + 1d6 + the card’s level, which has a starting value of 1d8+2+1d6 + card level (with a range of 4–16 + card level and an average of 10 + card level). That’s not bad for a cheap combat, and is entirely comparable with Sajan’s basic weapon combats: his Dogslicer does 1d8+2+1d6, but can be boosted to 1d8+2+2d6 with a discard, and his Starknife does 1d8+2+1d4 and can be boosted to 1d8+2+2d4 with a recharge. Of course, unarmed combat’s card level will improve with time, and as soon as Sajan takes a power feat to change his unarmed combat’s +1d6 to +1d10, he’s definitely notched unarmed combat above his weaponry.</p> 
                <blockquote>
                 <p><i>Can Sajan Use His First Power When Fighting with Weapons?</i> No. The power begins “For your combat check,” so it determines the skill you are using for that check, just as weapons do. You can only use one power that determines the skill you are using for a check, so it’s either Sajan’s first power or a weapon. (If you want to use Acrobatics with a weapon, use something like Dogslicer or Starknife, but you still won’t get that extra 1d6 (or 1d10) + card level.)</p>
                </blockquote> 
                <p><b><i>Bless Extensively in Combat Too.</i></b> Whether he uses weapons or not, Sajan’s better than the numbers above suggest because he can play up to two blessings on his combat or Acrobatics checks, increasing either by 2–16 (average 9). Though an unarmed combat of 4–16 + card level (average 10 + card level) isn’t bad, a combat of 6–32 + card level (average 19 + card level) that doesn’t <i>permanently</i> use any resources, is spectacular.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Take the Extra Free Blessing Power Feat.</i></b> Sajan can get even better at combat! The best way to do that is to check the power feat that allows him to use a second blessing freely. This increases his ability to pump his combat by another 1–8, turning his spectacular combat skill into one that’s largely unbounded. You’re now up to 7–40 + card level for a low-level character if you temporarily expend three blessings! (The other option is to change Sajan’s combat ability from +1d6 to +1d10; it’s nice to be able to do that without temporarily expending a card, but it’s only an average increase of +2 to the roll, as opposed to +4.5. Mind you, it’s still a good second choice, and maybe sooner if you’re having problems with monsters that require Magic skills to be killed.)</p> 
                <p><b><i>Become the Villain Killer.</i></b> By now, you’re playing Sajan like a combat machine. That should make him a prime choice for taking out your villains, henchmen, or other difficult monsters. Send him over when a location deck is getting low, and make sure he has a handful of blessings.</p>

                </div> 
                <h3>The Sajan Roles</h3> 
                <p>Though there are a variety of differences between Sajan’s two roles, the Exiled Padaprajna is generally better if you want to play Sajan as a weapons fighter and the Iroran Dedicant if you want to play him as an unarmed fighter. The latter plays more naturally to Sajan’s strengths.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Exiled Padaprajna.</i></b> This is the “weapons master” role for Sajan. It gives him better Melee and/or Ranged skills along with proficiencies. It’s not strictly necessary, but you might choose it if there’s no melee or ranged weapon fighter in your party, and thus those cards would otherwise go to waste. This role also makes Sajan a bit more cooperative (since other players can bless him without cost and he can offer them damage reduction); and more protected (since he can avoid losing his cards to damage). Thus, you might also choose this role if complementary opportunities for cooperation are being wasted or if Sajan is getting hurt too much.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Iroran Dedicant.</i></b> This is the “martial artist” role for Sajan. It can make him considerably better at unarmed combat by adding an extra +1d4, by allowing rerolls of 1s or even 2s, and by adding bonuses if multiple dice come up the same (something that becomes more likely as Sajan adds more blessing dice). If you improve Sajan’s combat with the four basic dice changes, he now rolls a base of 1d8+2+1d10 + card level + 1d4 and rerolls 1s and 2s. That alone makes his basic combat range 11–24 + card level (an average of 17.5 + card level), which is quite high, and doesn’t even count his ability to add 1–3 blessings. Mind you, this role doesn’t make Sajan any more cooperative and doesn’t make his gameplay any more varied.</p>

                <p>The Pathfinder Society is a globe-trotting organization whose agents are dedicated to exploring the world, finding lost knowledge and relics, and reporting their findings both to the Society itself and to the rest of Golarion via the Pathfinder Chronicles, a publication released by the Society that is essentially a “greatest hits” of reports from Pathfinders. (For a taste of the kind of missions Pathfinders go on, check out Howard Andrew Jones’s <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwr?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-The-Idol-and-the-Scythe">fiction</a> from a few weeks ago!) People join up with the Society for a number of reasons. Some want to seek knowledge, others prefer the glory that comes with their findings, others still join up for the fun and thrills involved with their missions, and some just want to help the Society and further its causes.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>The Society contains a few broad factions that cover most of these general aspects and most Pathfinders typically associate with one or two of these factions during their career, though such association isn’t compulsory. These factions are the Envoy’s Alliance—a group dedicated to the well-being of the Society and its members, the Grand Archive whose members are devoted to the pursuit of knowledge, the Horizon Hunters who prefer to just travel for the sake of exploration and locating new and forgotten sites, and the Vigilant Seal which includes those Pathfinders who rise up to contain the threats the Society encounters on its missions.</p>

                <p>Due to their constant travels, the Pathfinders make use of lots of different types of equipment. These vary from common adventuring gear to more specialized tools like <i>wayfinders</i>. These magical compasses serve both as a badge of membership for Pathfinders and also as a useful tool for their travels. The typical <i>wayfinder</i>, which is located in the Core Rulebook, allows its user to create magical light and tap into the power of the magical gemstones known as <i>aeon stones</i>. The common <i>wayfinder</i> isn’t the only one in use by the Pathfinders, however. This book provides a few new <i>wayfinder</i> types along with other magical items like the <i>fortifying pebble</i>, a talisman that reduces the damage dealt to the item to which it is affixed.</p>

                <p>Players looking to play a character who is a member of the Pathfinder Society can do so pretty easily. The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zoj?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide">Lost Omens World Guide</a> featured the Pathfinder Agent, an archetype representing a more generic member of the Society. That archetype covers the general abilities one comes to expect as a member of the Society. Namely, it gives you means of helping you search around on your travels, gain more knowledge, and help out your allies. (Explore, report, cooperate!) Characters who took this archetype will find a few more feats to help expand their different skills. These include the Everybody Duck! feat which helps out when you accidentally set off a trap you’re trying to disarm and the Recognize Threat feat to better help you recognize the monsters you fight.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191011-recognizethreat.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191011-recognizethreat.png" alt="Recognize Threat, Feat 8.

Attempt a Recall Knowledge check against the triggering creature."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Not all Pathfinder choose to be jacks of all trades, however. Part of a Pathfinder’s training requires that they gain the approval of the three deans of the Grand Lodge before they are considered full-fledged agents. These deans are known as the Masters of Scrolls, Spells, and Swords and each specialize in a different skill to train up and coming agents. The Scrolls train in history, knowledge, and observation; the Spells focus on magical lore and theory; and the Swords teach recruits combat and survival techniques. Once they become proper Pathfinders, many agents continue to associate with their peers from either the Scrolls, Spells, or Swords and undertake missions that favor a particular branch.</p>

                <p>Characters that want to represent this affinity can do so with the three new archetypes in this book. The Scrollmaster, Spellmaster, and Swordmaster archetypes all follow in the vein of the Society branches themselves. The Scrollmaster, for example, is all about researching and being prepared and gains abilities to both further and make use of their extensive knowledge. On the other hand, the Spellmaster focuses on magic and using said magic for things like creating protective wards and even absorbing the spells of your foes to fire the spells back at them!</p>

If you have the Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer feat (Lost Omens World Guide 23), you can change the cantrip you chose for that feat each day during your daily preparations."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>If you prefer your survival and that of your companions over anything else, you might consider taking the Swordmaster archetype. The archetype provides new options for both survival and faring well in combat. Some of these options are designed to help you prevent damage to yourself, while others are here to help you defend your allies. Regardless of which branch you associate with, your character can take these archetypes right away or in addition to the Pathfinder Agent archetype. Much like with the Hellknights and Knights of Lastwall, these new archetypes dovetail perfectly from the Pathfinder Agent, allowing you to mix and match the skills and abilities to your liking.</p>

               <div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;">
                <a href="/image/content/Blog/101019_ZemirPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/101019_ZemirPreview_360.jpeg"></a>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“There's nothing we can do—all systems are jammed! Prepare for emergency landing!”</p> 
                <p>As Captain Navasi's frantic voice echoed throughout the <i>Sunrise Maiden</i>'s bridge, a sinking feeling settled into the pit of Zemir's stomach.</p> 
                <p>There were many realities in which the <i>Maiden</i> was an unreliable starship, but this wasn't one of them. Something wasn't right. </p> 
                <p>But that didn't change the fact that the ship was quickly plummeting into the atmosphere of an uncharted planet in the Vast. If the crew didn't act quickly, that desolate rock would be their grave.</p> 
                <p>Pushing aside his fear, Zemir leaned back in his chair and cleared his mind. In an instant he sorted through a thousand iterations of this crash landing and clung to just one—the one where everyone survived.</p> 
                <p>“Hard to starboard!” Zemir boomed. “Aim for that plateau—it's our only shot!”</p> 
                <p>“You heard him!” Navasi shouted, cutting in the ship's retro-thrusters to try to slow its descent. “All hands! Starboard side!”</p> 
                <p>Obozaya and Quig scrambled to the captain's terminal, the bulky vesk's eyes wide with adrenaline and the scraggly ysoki shrieking profanities. They forced their weight onto the controls, pulling the levers far past their safety points, desperately hoping the ship could find the landing spot Zemir had seemingly pulled from thin air.</p> 
                <p>“That's it,” Zemir encouraged them, clinging to the single survival scenario he foresaw. “We're going to make it!”</p> 
                <p>The <i>Maiden</i>'s proximity sensor screamed a warning. The ship slammed three times into the hard ground. But sure enough, thanks to the reality Zemir had plucked like a grain of sand from an infinite beach, they crashed in one piece.</p> 
                <p>Once Navasi caught her breath, the captain stumbled over to Zemir and clapped him on the back.</p> 
                <p>“Another day, another of your mysterious magic tricks,” she said, grinning with relief. “I don't suppose the universe told you <i>why</i> we all just nearly died in a fiery crash, did it?”</p> 
                <p>Obozaya strode up behind Navasi, glowering with anger now that the danger had passed. “If there is an enemy here, Zemir, tell us. It is dishonorable to sabotage the ship,” she growled.</p> 
                <p>Zemir forced a characteristic chuckle and shook his head. His companions knew his powers didn't work that way.</p> 
                <p>“Look, I don't have all the answers,” Zemir said. He grinned impishly. “Where we are, and why we're here—well, I'll need some help figuring that out.”</p> 
                <p>Just then, a telltale pinging rang out from the <i>Maiden</i>'s comms. Quig slid over to examine the readout.</p> 
                <p>“Hey,” the gruff ysoki barked. “While you three are over there solvin' the world's mysteries, somebody near us on this rock needs help. Distress signal incoming.”</p> 
                <p>Hesitating, Navasi turned toward Quig. “But the ship—how damaged are we?”</p> 
                <p>“Structural damage minimal. I'll reset our systems and we'll be peachy again in an hour. Seems we just hit an electronics-jamming field.”</p> 
                <p>Obozaya hefted her doshko and looked at the captain, who nodded.</p> 
                <p>“If someone else hit that field and <i>didn't</i> have someone with Zemir's talents aboard, it's possible there's another crew outside lying on death's door,” Navasi said. “Obo, Quig—you up for a search and rescue? Zemir and I'll watch the systems.”</p> 
                <p>The vesk and ysoki nodded, saluted their captain, and headed toward the ship's airlock. </p> 
                <p>Zemir's eyes narrowed. Again, the subtlest of ripples tickled his senses. Something was <i>not</i> right, but without any sense of what or why, Zemir did the only thing he could.</p> 
                <p>“I'll join the rescue,” he said, winking to Navasi and striding purposefully to catch up with his companions. “You saw that green sky? Seems like a view I can't miss.”</p> 
                <p>The captain nodded, and the three set off for the source of the distress signal. Despite the rocky planet's abandoned desolation, its atmosphere was surprisingly friendly. Helmets off, the crew sauntered past chalky rock formations, skirting steep valleys and stagnant pools of dark liquid. Knowing Zemir's love of culture and cuisine, Quig joked about making the witchwarper a “sludge soufflé,” while Obozaya missed the jest and offered to share traditional vesk baking recipes.</p> 
                <p>It was strangely like any other friendly stroll—until the twinge in the back of Zemir's mind became a nauseating wave. Gritting his teeth through the mental assault, Zemir saw dozens of beady eyes and vicious tusks beginning to rise from crevices in the surrounding rock.</p> 
                <p>The creatures' hulking, scaled forms and snake-like tongues were unmistakable.</p> 
                <p>“Riveners!” Zemir shouted. “It's an ambush!”</p> 
                <p>The tines of her doshko roaring to life, Obozaya gave a fearsome battle cry and lunged toward the nearest riveners—powerful and nearly mindlessly aggressive lizard-like monsters often used as shock troops. Not to be outdone, Quig snatched his flamethrower from his back and braced himself to unleash a gout of flaming petrol.</p> 
                <p>But Zemir stood back, the wisdom of infinite possibilities settling on his shoulders. </p> 
                <p>The odds, he noted, were not in the companions' favor. Zemir counted a dozen riveners rushing toward him and his friends, who were already beginning to falter. And Zemir was certain he saw a different humanoid form scuttle away from the battlefield. </p> 
                <p>The twinges he felt made sense now. There was another witchwarper at hand—that's why everything from the moment the <i>Maiden</i>'s systems jammed until now felt like it existed in the reality next door. Someone was out to destroy Zemir and his friends, and it seemed they were willing to change existence itself to do it.</p> 
                <p>Not if Zemir could help it, he thought, as he scrambled atop a rock formation high above the fray. </p>

                </div> 
                <p>Gritting his teeth and stretching out his arms, Zemir focused his mind and began to call just a taste of a terrible world into their own. Hellfire rained down from the sky, the ground boiled into lava, and grasping hands sprang from the rocky earth to clutch at the slavering riveners' feet.</p> 
                <p>Of course, much of it was an illusion. Zemir's friends knew that; they had witnessed his raw power unleashed before. Still, Obozaya and Quig turned to stare at Zemir in terrified, respectful awe.</p> 
                <p>The riveners, on the other hand, screamed with horror as the spectral hands grabbed at them and the hellfire burned through their skin and flesh.</p> 
                <p>“Finish them off!” Zemir shouted. He leapt off the rock formation to pursue the opposing witchwarper. “Do <i>not</i> follow me!”</p> 
                <p>Purple robes billowing behind him, Zemir dashed to the ravine where he'd seen the mysterious humanoid figure disappear. But when he vaulted down, a different sight stole his breath.</p> 
                <p>Instead of a person, there was merely a metal hatch set into the ground. It was partially ajar, revealing a passage that led deep below. And on the hatch was a familiar crest: a stylized “IEM.”</p> 
                <p>The crest of the Institute for Extraordinary Minds.</p> 
                <p>An academy for witchwarpers. </p> 
                <p>Specifically, Zemir's alma mater—and one whose masters held a fierce vendetta against the fugitive who abandoned three of his classmates in an alternate reality many years ago.</p> 
                <p>Reflexively, Zemir lifted his comm unit to his mouth to warn Navasi back on the <i>Maiden</i>. His past had come to call, and now they were all in danger.</p> 
                <p>“Captain, they've found me,” he said.</p> 
                <p>No response.</p> 
                <p>“Captain?”</p> 
                <p>A scream, and then nothing but static.</p>

                <p>“Hi, everyone! I’m Tony, a production artist working with the art team! I’ve lived all around the country, but consider the Pacific Northwest home as it is where I grew up. Paizo is my first full-time job after graduating from college, and prior to that I had a year and a half of internships, two of which were in Los Angeles. When I’m not designing, you’ll find me at any random coffee shop in the Seattle area, hiking, camping, shopping, and traveling! Happy to be a part of the team!”</p>

                <h2>Joan Hong, Customer Service Representative</h2> 
                <p>“As July drew to a close and we were sorting out when our new Customer Service Representative could come in for her first day of work at Paizo, I realized with dismay that her start date was going to fall on the first day of Gen Con and the launch of Pathfinder Second Edition—a day we anticipated would be one of the busiest days of the year for customer service. But I also knew that based on what I saw in her interview, if anyone could handle the challenge, it would be Joan!</p> 
                <p>“Joan comes to Paizo with a wealth of knowledge and skills from her experiences in the nonprofit sector, including her volunteer work as Co-Founder and Social Media Manager for Outdoor Asian. In the two months she’s been a part of our customer service team, I’ve been impressed with the speed at which she’s picked up Paizo’s complex custom software and her ability to remain even-keeled and steadfast, even in the face of a service request backlog mounting into quadruple digits. As we get ready to gear up for PaizoCon 2020, I’m looking forward to seeing what her experience as an event planner will bring to the team.</p> 
                <p>“Joan joins Diego, Sam, and Virginia in one of the best customer service departments I’ve ever had the pleasure of being part of. Welcome to Paizo, Joan!”</p>

                <p>“I have three great loves in my life: food, gaming and the outdoors. There's never a shortage of great food around here and I volunteer outdoors, so landing a position at Paizo was the perfect way to complete my trifecta!</p> 
                <p>Pathfinder’s Shattered Star Adventure Path was my first TTRPG adventure back in college, so I am especially thrilled to be immersed in the action here. Already, I have learned so much and have had so many new and exciting opportunities open up for me. It has been such an absolute joy working with Virginia, Diego, Sam and Sara Marie in CS thus far, and I’m grateful to be part of such a fun, compassionate and incredibly talented work family.”</p>

Lyz Liddell has accepted a position on the team and has already moved in with the crew. Lyz played a pivotal role in the creation of the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook serving as both an editor and a developer, and we are thrilled to have her as a part of the team full time, helping us to create new and exciting rules for the game. Lyz has been working with Paizo for several years now, first as a freelance editor, then as a full-time member of the staff, and while she has already been <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgn5?Welcome-to-Lyz-Liddell">introduced to all of you</a>, we would like to give her a moment to talk about this new opportunity!”</p>

                <p>“What a strange road this has been! I came to RPGs as a player, and I came to Paizo as an editor. I love games and I love working with them, but it wasn’t until I got the chance to work on Starfinder that I realized how much I love working with games as they’re being built. It wasn’t until the Pathfinder Playtest that I realized how much I have to offer during that process (I still have my sheaf of development notes!), and it wasn’t until the production of Pathfinder Second Edition that I realized how much I love really digging into the rules of a game. I hadn’t ever considered myself a designer—or even a potential designer—until this position opened up and my coworkers starting saying I should apply for it. That got my gears turning, and from there I realized how much I enjoy this aspect of my work and how good I can be at it.</p> 
                <p>“I’m very excited to be at the leading edge of the new edition of Pathfinder. I love how streamlined and elegant the game is at its core: it’s fun for Pathfinder veterans and accessible to new gamers. I’m looking forward to expanding the core ruleset to make more options available—after all, that’s a huge part of what makes Pathfinder the game it is! I’m also hopeful that I can help inspire others who never imagined themselves in a particular creative role to step up and go for it”.</p>

In the weeks since he’s been promoted into that position—and even before he officially got word—Joe has been firing on all cylinders to make the Starfinder RPG the absolute best that it can be, from looking at sticky rules questions to considering the major mechanical direction of the game to everything in between. The Starfinder team and all of its fans are much better for having Joe’s careful and conscientious hand at the rules rudder, and I can’t wait to see what great things he does next!”</p>

I've been lucky to have supportive managers (Judy Bauer, Amanda Hamon, and Adam Daigle), patient mentors (Jason Keeley and Owen K.C. Stephens), and many friends across the company. Now I couldn't be happier to be in a position to drive the design of the game I love in an impactful way, working alongside all its other producers and players.”</p>

And from his very first day at Paizo, everything from Jake’s love of editing Starfinder to his work to publish third-party Starfinder RPG products has always been energizing. What’s more, that work gave him the demonstrated experience, skill, and insight to be ready for this hectic gig from day one. It’s been so exciting to have Jake on our team, where his passion, enthusiasm, and positive attitude are a boon to us all. Welcome, Jake, and it’s fantastic to have you on the team!”</p> 
                <p><i>—Amanda Hamon, Starfinder Managing Developer</i></p> 
                <p>“Here’s a true story: When I was recruited onto the editing team, they asked me what product line I was most looking forward to working on. “Starfinder!” was my reply. The game had just come out, and I could get in on the ground floor. Soon after I moved to Seattle, I started a regular Starfinder campaign with old friends, which I used to test ideas I published through a third party press. Mentored by Chris Sims, who sat at the desk I sit at now, I wrote two Starfinder AP volumes, two Starfinder Society scenarios, and a bunch of back matter articles. What I’m trying to say is, when the chance came to join the Star Chamber, I was positioned.</p> 
                <p>“And I was on the job for one week when I was told to pitch my first Starfinder Adventure Path! What I came up with, my colleagues are calling “ambitious,” “bold,” and “so dope.” Jason Keeley and Rob McCreary have helped me bang it into shape and I really think you are all going to love it.”</p>

As one of the world’s foremost experts on tabletop adventures and one of Paizo’s most veteran developers, John has an incredible amount to offer the Star Chamber (you can thank former Starfinder Design Lead Owen K.C. Stephens for that moniker!). Finally, in August, the science-fantasy stars aligned, and John accepted a promotion to Starfinder Senior Developer. Now, every day he demonstrates the incredible value to Starfinder of his general sensibilities for what’s cool, his rules and adventure expertise, his Organized Play background, and his general professionalism. The Starfinder team is much better for it all, and we’re so happy to have you on the team, John!”</p>

I’m so fortunate to have the coworkers I do.</p> 
                <p>Certainly, when I started, I didn’t expect that I’d be the Organized Play Lead Developer someday. I saw John Compton with his seemingly endless lists of tasks to complete, written in tiny handwriting on folded sheets of paper with checkboxes not much bigger than the ones on a Chronicle sheet. I remember my first convention season at Paizo, staring down the mountain of work that had to be done and internally freaking out as I tried to figure out how it would be possible. And I remember John reassuring me that we would make it work, because convention season is always hard, but we always find a way. I remember working late nights at the office with him, laughing, joking around, and making puns so bad he eventually just told me in faux-horror that I should go home, and we should “never speak of this again”. A few years later, when Michael Sayre had his first experience with the demands of convention season, he asked me a similar question to the one I’d asked John. And I found myself reassuring him, just as John had reassured me, that we would make it work, because convention season is always hard, but we always find a way. That feeling of being the experienced person, who trusted in our team to handle the challenges set before it, has really stuck with me.</p> 
                <p>Our team has a lot on our plates. You’ve probably noticed that we’re not as far along as we’d hoped to be in terms of supporting Pathfinder Society in Second Edition and filling in backlogs of First Edition support. There’s more that needs to be done than there are working hours, and that’s not even to speak of what we would like to do. But we have a bit advantage going into this year. I look back at the last few years, in which we launched Starfinder Society, and the Playtest campaign, and the revamped Adventure Card Society, and Pathfinder Society in Second Edition. It’s rather liberating to not be actively building the bones of a new campaign, but instead be able to focus on supporting what we already have and helping our new Pathfinder Society take flight. As we look forward to the future, our team is still short a person, but we’re actively working to fill that missing slot. More on that soon. As for the rest of the team, I’ll leave it to them to share their stories.</p> 
                <p>Take care, everyone, and enjoy your games :)</p>

                <p>As we’ve noted on some of our livestreams, the system for creating your own monsters and NPCs uses a top down system with benchmarks, allowing you to build a creature to match your top-level vision of that creature instead of requiring you to build them from the bottom up like a player character. This guide has all the relevant numbers for creating these creatures, as well as lessons on what you can do to make your monsters the best they can be. The numbers are a starting place, and your creativity really brings the monster to life. The hazard rules give you everything you need to create traps, environmental hazards, and haunts to menace your party.</p>

                <p>Zemir Solodan was born with a gift—but not everyone saw it that way at first.</p> 
                <p itemprop="description">The only son of miners on a remote planetoid called Pikora 317, tucked within the widest orbital ring of the gas giant Preluria in Near Space, Zemir spent his earliest days exposed to the harsh reality of life in a corporate labor colony. Determined to provide for their son, Zemir’s parents eked out their existence in the Freugan Salvage Company’s starmetal mines. The Solodans never went hungry, though the only delicacies young Zemir enjoyed were occasional tastes of citrus-chocolate pastries, sweet-milk custards, and savory meringues—gifts from the Freugan executives’ own ample stashes of treats imported from Absalom Station.</p> 
                <p>Even as a toddler, Zemir’s gaiety and thirst for new experiences were readily apparent. The vivacious boy quickly became known for his curiosity around the sparse facilities of the salvage company’s residential complex on Pikora 317. He developed many troublesome talents, such as sneaking into seemingly inaccessible places, turning neat collections of supplies into epic messes, and even finding ways to manipulate control panels into colorful, sparking displays. In fact, whenever a commonplace utility malfunctioned around the Solodan home, his parents joked that the “Zemir effect” had struck again.</p> 
                <p>Around Zemir’s fifth birthday, it seemed that the boy’s body began to betray him. Always known for eating anything with aplomb—especially new foods—Zemir seemed to sicken overnight. His appetite was as strong as always, but he gained weight, took on a sickly pallor, and grew weak. Despite his healthy diet and robust physical activity, testing indicated that the boy was dangerously malnourished. Even stranger, after every meal, Zemir’s breath smelled eerily similar to his favorite sweet treats, perhaps an indication of a dangerous blood disease, doctors speculated. </p> 
                <p>One by one, physicians ruled out all known ailments. Though his spirit never dampened, Zemir’s condition continued to deteriorate, even after his family sold most of their belongings to afford vitamin supplements, pediatric medicinals, and batteries of experimental medical tests. Desperate, and carrying news from the pediatricians that Zemir might eventually perish, his parents took to posting details of their son’s strange condition on every related infosphere portal they could find.</p> 
                <p>In just a few days, the Solodans’ pleas elicited a mysterious message from a Dr. Fainoro Corone, who said he suspected a rare and unexplainable diagnosis and requested to observe the boy in person. Dr. Corone’s long list of credentials indicated he was an expert in “exceptional pediatric conditions.” He hailed from a facility on far-off Arkanen, a Liavaran moon home to scientists, spellcasters, and—as Zemir’s parents believed—medical doctors.</p> 
                <p>With no other options, Zemir’s parents readily welcomed the quiet damaya lashunta doctor into their home. For a full day, Dr. Corone watched Zemir’s every move, focusing on the boy’s behavior at meal times. As Zemir slurped at his nutritional broth with surprising glee, Dr. Corone studied him closely. Slight mumbling accompanied his look of suspicion, as if the doctor communed with some internal eldritch knowledge. </p> 
                <p>On the second day, Dr. Corone attended breakfast at the Solodan house wearing a pair of thick, circuitry-etched bracers. Saying nothing, he watched Zemir’s father spoon broth into his pallid son’s mouth. Just before the gleeful boy swallowed, Dr. Corone’s demand rang out: </p> 
                <p>“Zemir, open your mouth now.”</p> 
                <p>The boy refused and downed the broth quickly. But at his mother’s command, he sheepishly opened his mouth. A thin film of custard clung to his baby teeth, and his breath smelled like sweet milk.</p> 
                <p>Dr. Corone pointed this out, and then gently instructed Zemir’s parents to continue feeding the boy. Saying nothing, he flipped a tiny switch on his bracers, which thrummed and glowed with a strange technological energy.</p> 
                <p>Immediately, Zemir’s eyes widened. His father fed him his broth, and when Zemir drank it, he made a disgusted face.</p> 
                <p>Dr. Corone nodded and explained: Zemir was not suffering from a physical ailment. The boy was instead, in the subtlest of ways, warping the fabric of reality to suit his childish preferences. For months, the boy had been turning all of his meals into nutritionally empty sweets. Similarly, the messes and mischief he had caused around the residential complex were the result of the boy’s ability to shift reality ever-so-slightly for his own amusement.</p> 
                <p>Zemir was a witchwarper—one who understands that the universe consists of infinite realities. What’s more, witchwarpers possess the innate ability to peer into those worlds, and to mix and manipulate them at will. Most witchwarpers’ abilities manifested in adulthood, Dr. Corone explained. But Zemir was special, powerful even for a child, and unlike anyone he had seen.</p> 
                <p>The doctor’s bracers—called reality stabilizers—dampened Zemir’s nascent and unstable abilities and would allow the boy to have a normal childhood. The lashunta was prepared to give the Solodans their own set of reality stabilizers, but with his “diagnosis” came another offer. </p> 
                <p>Dr. Corone wanted to bring Zemir back to Arkanen with him. There, he’d enroll the boy in the Institute for Extraordinary Minds, a facility that was effectively a school for young witchwarpers. </p> 
                <p>The witchwarpers at the institute—like Dr. Corone himself—could help Zemir learn control over his abilities, the doctor explained. Dr. Corone offered full tuition for Zemir and unrestricted visitation privileges for his family. Saddened but understanding the value of this offer, Zemir’s parents agreed.</p> 
                <p>For the next twelve years, Zemir was Dr. Corone’s protege. Zemir spent the time honing his ability to subtly manipulate his surroundings, growing more delighted each time he created a new sound, smell—and especially taste—that he’d never before experienced. He supplemented his training with an insatiable appetite for learning about far-away cuisine and cultures, dreaming of one day traveling throughout this reality and perhaps an infinite number of others. During this time, Zemir also learned of Eloritu, the god of magic and secrets, and came to view the infinite cosmos as a gift from this mysterious deity.</p> 
                <p>However, as passionate as Zemir became about his talents and studies, he also grew increasingly cocky and resentful of the reality stabilizers the instructors used to rein his more dangerous experiments. </p> 
                <p>Near Zemir’s eighteenth birthday, the young witchwarper began the early stages of his final thesis project: an ambitious attempt to create a minute-long rift into a reality adjacent to his own. The institute’s professors approved the project only under their strict supervision, requiring the placement of several stabilizing safeguards during all forms of research.</p> 
                <p>Zemir bristled at such restrictions. And so, under the cover of night, the brash and charismatic young man convinced three of his closest friends and fellow students to participate in a dry-run of his experiment. With no safeguards in place, Zemir used his substantial willpower to tear open a rift in reality. A primal scream rent his lips and a shock of his hair whitened under the great mental strain. Ecstatic, terrified, but trusting their brilliant friend, Zemir’s classmates stepped through the rift, which immediately winked out. </p> 
                <p>The human Alena Nidaro, the half-elf Tornil Lee, and the ysoki Smidge disappeared from this reality. Try as he might, Zemir could not reopen the rift nor could he find any trace of his friends.</p> 
                <p>Panicked, Zemir ran from his lab to the institute’s docking bay, where at least he could be alone and think. For a moment, he considered returning to confess his horrific error to Dr. Corone, but then he saw a midnight supply shuttle about to leave Arkanen for Absalom Station. And in that split second, Zemir decided the course of his own existence. </p> 
                <p>Posing as a worker, Zemir fled the Institute for Extraordinary Minds in the shuttle, and promptly lost himself in the crowds of Absalom Station. Convinced his friends were gone and he was to blame, Zemir wandered the station in a haze for weeks, performing minor tricks of warped reality for the credits he needed to survive. Eventually, Zemir sent a message to Dr. Corone to confess what he had done, then deactivated his institute communications account. </p> 
                <p>Despite the institute’s best efforts to track Zemir down and get some answers, Dr. Corone and his colleagues have always remained one step behind him. Although his wits returned, Zemir’s scars are far from healed. He now travels to all corners of this reality, as much seeking to earn a living using his strange magic and indulge his love of new experiences as he is running from a guilty conscience. </p> 
                <p>Growing ever more powerful daily, Zemir is a mysterious and joyful—if occasionally morose—companion to those who share his goals. He’s known for waxing eloquent about the tapestry of existence and the dangers that other realities hold. The wise would heed the witchwarper’s words, for Zemir has looked into infinite realities—and he’s vowed to never again lose another to the fray.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Pathfinder is a game with a legacy. Drawing from a heritage stretching back to Gary’s table, when envisioning a new edition, it is tempting to simply iterate on what has come before. After all, that was the strategy that built Pathfinder into an incredibly successful Roleplaying Game.</p> 
                <p>That was not the route we decided to take.</p> 
                <p>Simply iterating on the same game engine was not enough. The 3.5 engine has had its day, and as a team we decided that it was time to modernize, to create a version of Pathfinder that was more than just tinkering around the edges. The game needed to evolve to speak to the desires of the current crowd of gamers. It needed to an engine tune up that made it easier for novices to grasp, while still providing a rich depth of option. What it needed was elegance in its design.</p> 
                <p>The first steps were taken shortly after the first edition of Pathfinder made their way to the printer. The work that was left undone, due the necessity of compatibility, would become the basis for what the new game needed to be. The math engine caused problems with high level play that led to an unsatisfactory game experience. Imbalances in fundamental class design created imbalances that left some players feeling unable to contribute. A bloat of rules options without any checks in the system created a game that was unwieldy to run.</p> 
                <p>But in spite of all that, the game itself was still a success, due in large part to the world it created, and the investment it fostered in players and game masters alike. We knew, from the outset, that the story of the game had to remain the same, even if the rules that made it manifest needed to change. Achieving that goal meant that we needed to do a lot more than simply clean up the game. We needed to start over.</p> 
                <p>Pathfinder Second Edition does not include one single sentence or rule carried over directly from first edition. That was one of the first choices we made. Everything was up for examination, from the fundamental math formulas behind the game to the individual statistics for longswords. And while that made for a lot of additional work, it also meant that we could look at each rule cleanly, unburdened by the conventions of the past. In the end, many things work similarly to how they did in first edition (a longsword still does 1d8 damage), but we were able to innovate where the game called for innovation. Take the action system for example. In first edition, when it was your turn to act in combat, you had a complicated menu of options, between move actions, standard actions, free actions, swift actions, and on and on. In second edition, we simplified that to just three actions, removing all the types and making your turn a more dynamic part of the game. The narrative is still fundamentally the same, but how you take part in the game is much simpler to teach and easy to use.</p> 
                <p>Next, we knew that if we were going to take a fresh look at the game, we needed a playtest that would allow us to gather meaningful data about the core of the game’s engine. In the past, our playtests had focused on the experience of the rules, relying mostly on player and game master anecdotes to gather information. While this gave us insight, it was impossible to apply any measure of statistical rigor to the data. For second edition we decided to create an environment that allowed us to gather better data about our game. To start, we needed to standardize the feedback by getting a massive number of players to experience the same adventure. We wrote <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, a seven part mini-campaign, with the express goal of testing targeted parts of the Pathfinder game engine. There was a part filled with undead to stress test the player’s healing capabilities. There was a tests focused on the various skill disciplines in the game. And perhaps most importantly, there was a test designed to push the characters beyond their limits, to test the rules for death and dying in the game.</p> 
                <p>While this sort of hardcore testing gave us invaluable information about how our game assumptions were playing out, it was a grueling test for some groups of players. After all, playing the same type of encounter over and over to determine the breaking point is not exactly the most fun way to play the game. Their sacrifices, though, led to some of the most in-depth analysis we have ever seen on an RPG. It led us to fully understand the spots where our assumptions and biases were leading the game astray, allowing us to course correct. Some systems were entirely abandoned (like resonance, a system for balancing magic item use), while others were refined into rules to meet player desire (like the new system for focus spells, allowing casters to utilize their signature spells all day long). The playtest was one of the hardest we have ever run, but it was also the most rewarding.</p> 
                <p>The second edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game has been in the works for years, but now on the eve of its release, all of that work is about to pay off. The new version of the game is simple to run and easier for new players to learn, but it keeps all of the features that players have come to appreciate from Pathfinder: deep character customization, a rich world narrative, and all the tools to tell the type of stories that you want to tell. Speaking for the team, we can’t wait to share those stories with you.</p>

                <p>A big mechanic that we tested at some tables throughout the Core and Curse playtesting process was the “Market”. At the end of each scenario, you were given the option to trade for a readily available boon (one that was either level 0, or at least 2 levels lower than you).</p> 
                <blockquote>
                 <p>When rebuilding, each character may banish 1 boon; any that do may search the vault for a boon with a maximum level of the most recently played scenario’s # minus 2 (minimum 0).</p>

                <p>It was cut for a few reasons:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>It would add complexity and time to the end of scenarios, as traders did in <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pacg/adventures/mummysMask">Mummy’s Mask</a>.</li> 
                 <li>There was concern around removing some of the loot chase, both in terms of reduced difficulty and also reduced excitement.</li> 
                 <li>We just didn’t have space in the storybook for more mechanics.</li>

                <p>We considered trying to sneak it in as a simpler mechanic that would piggyback off rebuilding to have a similar effect: </p> 
                <blockquote>
                 <p>When rebuilding, each character may banish any number of boons.<br>OR<br>When rebuilding, each character may banish 1 boon.</p>
                </blockquote> 
                <p>As long as you were able to banish enough boons that you had to refill your deck to make it legal, you could replace them with cards that were a maximum level of the most recently played scenario’s # minus 2 (minimum 0). Unfortunately, it was less flavorful and still had the same complexity and timing flaws. It was also less obvious how you use it (especially to newer players). This is a good example of the sort of things that cause us to cut material even after it has been developed and tested. While the mechanic was dearly beloved by several of our (very experienced) playtesters, it added an extra layer of confusion for the newer players. It’s always a balancing act to keep the game interesting and challenging, but not overwhelming.</p> 
                <p>Now that we’ve talked about why we <i>didn’t</i> include it in the box, let’s talk about why you might want to play around with it at home. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100419_CoreItemElixirOfHealing.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100419_CoreItemElixirOfHealing_180.jpeg" alt="Elixir of Healing, Item 0.

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Even single use, it’s nice to have healing options.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>The main goal of the market concept was to empower characters to take and, especially, <i>feel comfortable</i> using consumables like Elixir of Healing by providing a reasonable way to replace them. It’s extremely common for characters in the RPG to carry around a supply of healing potions and scrolls, so we like the idea of a character hanging onto an Elixir of Healing or a scroll of Soothing Word, secure in the knowledge they can get it back.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100419_ROTRMerisielFront.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100419_ROTRMerisielFront_180.jpeg" alt="Merisiel, Character B.

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">One of these things doesn’t belong with the others...</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>A secondary goal of the market was a way to address a rare conundrum that can occur. If, for whatever reason, your character had to banish a boon you liked, you have to rebuild your deck with whatever card you happen to have on hand. Only if there are no spare cards of that type can you go searching the box for a reasonable replacement. I’ve seen a few different complaints about this, and I’ve also suffered it myself. I was soloing <i>Rise of the Runelords</i> with Merisiel when I had to banish my Thieves Tools, probably to close a location. Merisiel really liked those Thieves Tools, so I was eager to get them back, but I drew a random item from the box (for either closing a location or defeating a Cache barrier) and got a Token of Remembrance. It turns out that since Merisiel has no spells, that particular item doesn’t help her except as a hit point. “No big deal,” I thought, “I’m sure I’ll quickly either banish it or find another item I want more.” Sadly, I was stuck with it for 3 whole scenarios. In the grand scheme of things, it wasn’t a big deal since I just kept using it to feed my backstab power, but it felt <i>wrong!</i></p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Does Ezren keep failing to acquire ‘your’ Greataxe? Well, we’ve got an offer for you!</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>A tertiary goal, and one that led to the greatest mechanical argument against including the market concept, is that sometimes you just fail to find a boon you really want. Perhaps you really want a particular level 1 weapon or blessing, but you’re level 3 and you’ve never had a chance to acquire it (perhaps because Lini or Quinn keeps finding it and failing to get it for you). It’d be nice to be able to just banish a boon you like less and replace it with the one you’ve been hunting for multiple levels. That said, one of the most exciting things for many players is the loot chase: seeing that dream boon that perfectly complements your character, waiting to luck into it, throwing the kitchen sink at acquiring it, and victoriously adding it to your deck. If you can too easily just get lower level boons, that takes away a fair chunk of the ‘thrill of the chase’ for some people.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100419_CoreWeaponDeathbaneCrossbow.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100419_CoreWeaponDeathbaneCrossbow_180.jpeg" alt="Deathbane Light Crossbow, Weapon 1.

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">So many shiny boons, so little deck space.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>An extra benefit for the market appeared later: you can give up boons until you think you’re likely to need them. Know that you’re heading into a few scenarios full of undead? Go buy a Deathbane weapon. See that there’s an upcoming scenario full of arrows and fire? A Covering Shield might be just what you need. This is particularly nice now that Loot boons are in the vault. The Loot weapon Wyrmsmite from <i>The Dragon’s Demand</i> is great against dragons, which might be great to use against a couple of vicious dragons late in <i>Curse of the Crimson Throne</i>.</p> 
                <p>I encourage you to try it out and see if it’s good for your group. If you think “at the end of a scenario” is too often, you could make going to the market require winning the scenario, or only occur at the end of an adventure. Another interesting option would be to make a trip to the market a reward for having spent a hero point on something other than a feat during a scenario, or for being rewarded a hero point and not immediately spending it on a feat.</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Some locations lend themselves more to a market trip than others.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Another option for <i>Curse</i> specifically is to make the market a special feature available at the end of any scenario that included the Base. If that sounds too frequent for your group, you could require that characters “put in an order” by only allowing characters that explored the Base during the scenario to go the market. Just be careful of this option if your group has someone who hogs the Base and demolishes it before anyone else can even think of going to it. </p> 
                <p>If you want to go a bit crazy, you could even give access to the market as a reward for closing certain locations. Just have people keep locations they close handy, then at the end you might let whoever closed the Shop trade for anything, Academy a spell, Arsenal a weapon, Cathedral a blessing, Tavern an ally, etc. This is more complex than we’re likely to publish outside of a blog, but it could add an exciting benefit for some groups.</p> 
                <p>If you get a chance to play around with the Market, let us know. We love feedback. Maybe it will appear in some future product.</p> 
                <p>We’d also love to know if this kind of blog content is of interest. It’ll take time and effort to put lost boons into a usable form, and a lot of work to develop and test the lost characters from class decks, but it may be worth it if enough people would like to see them.</p>

                <p>Except, like many things in the Mwangi Expanse, that was truer in theory than in reality. While factions such as the Pathfinder Society would travel into Garund quite often, it seemed that the Magaambya was skimping on its travel budget, and members of the arcane college weren’t often seen in official Paizo products. One of our goals in the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i> was to firmly define the current presence and goals of the Magaambya. In addition to their heavy presence in the Mwangi Expanse, the Magaambya has begun setting up satellite colleges to the north—after the explosion (many times literal) of arcane events and anomalies that have occurred in Avistan, from the closure of the Worldwound to the appearance of New Thassilon to the destruction caused by the Whispering Tyrant, the scholars of the south have decided it’s about time they go see what on earth is happening up there!</p>

                <p>Joining the Magaambya is simply a matter of finding a teacher to sponsor you into the school, but you don’t count as a full-fledged member just from the get-go. Initiates first have to complete a Perquisite: a period of public service. Unlike the teachings of Nethys, the Magaambya doesn’t believe that magic is worth studying just for the sake of being magic. It’s what the magician intends to do with their power that’s important, and the Magaambya believes that those who can cast magic should use it to aid other people. The Perquisite is thus a means to earn the right to study at the Magaambya, but also the Magaambya’s most important lesson. Public service and a willing sponsor are still much easier entrance requirements than other prestigious colleges, who can often discriminate on the grounds of class, ancestry, or wealth. The Magaambya has a startling array of peoples among its students, including many ancestries that have unsavory reputations in other places: anadi, catfolk, gnolls, and iruxi can be found openly studying on the grounds, and even prospectives from Usaro, Mzali, or the Sargavan people—as many Mwangi call the colonists who recently ruled Vidrian—can find a warm welcome, if their intentions are good.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>The Magaambya is founded in the teachings of Old Mage Jatembe—most critically, that all magic is magic, regardless of the source. Distinctions such as divine, primal, arcane, and occult are all simply distractions from this truth. Of course, this distinction is easier said than practiced, as the Magaambya well knows. The Magaambya’s signature spellcasting is known as “halcyon magic,” a tradition that combines both arcane and primal magic when casting spells (seen in action in this recent <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwq?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-When-it-Rains">piece of fiction</a> by Tim Pratt and described in the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i>). Characters who take the halcyon speaker archetype represent those mages who have mastered halcyon magic and, at higher levels, can even learn to cast multiple halcyon spells at once.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191004-halcyonspells.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191004-halcyonspells.png" alt="Halcyon Spells. Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don’t gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes. Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can’t heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can’t select a halcyon spell as a signature spell. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer’s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely."></a>

You can use your halcyon spell slots to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells. Special: You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the halcyon speaker archetype. Halcyon magic has been practiced by the Magaambya for a long time, but the researchers and staff at the university aren’t content to rest on their laurels. The Magaambya has plenty of teachers to pass down their current traditions, but also continue researching ways that other traditions of magic might be combined: arcane magic pulsing with the power of the divine, or occult secrets locked away in ancient, primal monuments."></a>

                <p>Characters that complete their Perquisite gain the rank of Attendant, which allows them to begin advancement in Magaambyan fields of learning such as halcyon magic. Attendants are also expected to choose what branch of the Magaambya—specialized faculties within the school—the student wishes to pursue. Magaambyan attendants have five branches to choose from, representing their commitment to one of the school’s five specialized faculties. Pursuing work within that branch offers on-the-job training that can grant a student unique abilities. A Cascade Bearer, who focuses on advancing magical theory, can use her extensive studies to warp her magic on the fly, such as extending great effort to apply a minor metamagic she has not mastered to a spell. Tempest-Sun Mages, who exist to protect the Magaambya and its allies, can channel some of their offensive magic into a magical barrier to defend themselves. Characters that join with one of the five branches can represent their focus via the Magaambyan attendant archetype.</p>

Uncommon, Archetype, Dedication. Prerequisites: trained in Arcana or Nature, member of the Magaambya of attendant rank. You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain the ability to cast a single arcane or primal cantrip of your choice, (as is normal for cantrips, it is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level, rounded up). If you weren’t already, you become trained in that tradition’s spell DCs and spell attack rolls, with Intelligence as your spellcasting ability if you choose arcane or Wisdom as your spellcasting ability if you choose primal. Regardless of whether you choose an arcane or primal cantrip, you also either become trained in Arcana or Nature, or an expert in one of those skills in which you were already trained. When you gain this feat, choose to affiliate with the Cascade Bearers, Emerald Boughs, Rain–Scribes, Tempest-Sun Mages, or Uzunjati. This grants you additional feats available to only that branch. Special: You cannot select another dedication feat other than Halcyon Speaker Dedication until you have gained two other feats from the Magaambyan Attendant or halcyon speaker archetype."></a>

Archetype. Prerequisites: Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Rain-Scribes affiliation. You surround yourself in a mantle of Rain-Scribe magic and Stride twice; difficult terrain does not reduce your Speed, even if the difficult terrain has been manipulated by magic. Your magic clears the difficult terrain in each square you entered; until your next turn, those squares aren’t difficult terrain for any creature walking through them (or are normal difficult terrain if they were previously greater difficult terrain)."></a>

                <p>In addition, Attendants gain the right to create a Magaambyan mask and have it recognized by the other faculty and students. These masks can be unnerving and difficult to explain to outsiders—while they begin as simple wood, continual use is meant to leave an “imprint” of the wearer’s true face, etched into the mask by the student’s soul and magical power. The mask serves as a focus and guide for the Attendant’s magic, as well as a connection between the Attendant’s body and spiritual self. Masks are not considered mandatory, however, and some people find these masks too unsettling to use… especially the ones that move and speak on their own!</p>

Archetype. Prerequisites: Magaambyan Attendant Dedication. Your mask takes on a personality of its own, allowing it to serve as your familiar. Though you can still wear it as a mask, you can detach it from your face to grant it a bodily form of colored light that allows it to move around; usually, this is a miniature form of the animal the mask represents. Detaching or reattaching the familiar to transform it is a two-action activity. Even in mask form, the familiar can move around on its master’s face and speaks in a distinct voice (if it can talk). It is easily recognized as more than a simple mask unless the familiar succeeds at a Deception check to Impersonate a mask. Other than its appearance and the fact that it can be worn, it functions as other familiars. Your mask familiar has access to the mask freeze familiar ability."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>As you can see, the Magaambya truly embodies a dedication to the gathering of knowledge, and greater yet, a dedication to change the world for the better with said knowledge. Members of the Magaambya travel all over the world to both build on this knowledge and apply their skills, magical or otherwise, to improving the world wherever they go. If this sounds like something you’d be interested in playing, make sure to check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Lost Omens Character Guide</a> when it releases on October 16th and read Andrew Mullen’s great work on the Magaambya.

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“I thought you said the signal was coming from a ruin,” Velloro said into his comm unit, looking up at the huge, very intact fortification in front of him with a large, unruined door blocking the way forward. The captain’s response was garbled, no doubt thanks to the rocky, mountainous terrain between him and the <i>Sunrise Maiden</i>. “Ye… …is th… …thing there?”</p> 
                <p>Rolling his eyes dramatically for the sake of his companions, who had instinctively turned toward the comm unit to try to decode Navasi’s transmission, Velloro shrugged. “Guess we’re improvising, Chk Chk,“ he said, winking at Keskodai’s larval son as he spun slowly in his protective canister. “Raia, can you get that door open?”</p> 
                <p>Before the technomancer could respond, a recess in the doorframe began to flicker with a dim red light that grew brighter and more steady. As it did, the ground thrummed with the energy of a long-dormant system sputtering to life. </p> 
                <p><i>“Yes—I’ll get the door,”</i> Raia’s telepathic response darted through the hallways of Velloro’s mind as she began casting a spell that would magically bypass the door’s locks.</p> 
                <p>Several other vertical recesses in the wall drew Velloro’s eyes as they, too, activated. Boxy machines rose out of the staggered parapets, topped with gleaming barrels pointing straight up, then swiveled down to point directly at Velloro and his friends.</p> 
                <p>“Fall in—<i>NOW!</i>” Velloro’s last word was a telepathic shout to prevent the opening salvo of eight massive turrets firing heavy rounds from drowning it out. With no time to be polite, he pushed through his companions, knocking them off balance. Raia’s spell failed as her concentration faltered, but she immediately began to cast it again, cleaving close to Velloro as he raised his shield just in time to intercept the first wave of pounding projectiles.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100319_Velloro.jpg"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100319_Velloro.jpg" alt="Velloro, the iconic lashunta vanguard, uses his energy shield to protect Raia and Keskodai from an onslaught of gunfire from the turret-studded perimeter wall ahead of them."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>As he often did in these situations, Velloro began to experience time much more slowly, to take notice of everything around him more carefully. He saw the firing mechanism jam on the fourth turret to the left of the entryway. He felt the heavy, staccato thud of rounds as they slammed into the ground just feet away and began to describe a dotted line that would momentarily bring the molten-hot metal slugs into contact with his shield, his armor—and possibly his friends.</p> 
                <p>The firing seemed to slow, but Velloro knew the automated turrets were cycling shots to prevent overheating; those towers wouldn’t run out of ammunition any time soon. Raia, somehow sounding out of breath despite being in his head, said <i>“I’ve got the door,”</i> and it slid open with unnerving silence and speed.</p> 
                <p>Three red-scaled, lizardlike ikeshtis wearing sand-tattered defrex hides skidded to a stop just in front of the entryway. They had been running toward stairs leading to the top of the wall, but now they turned to the intruders, semi-auto pistols in their clawed hands.</p> 
                <p>Velloro immediately charged the startled ikeshtis, smiling as he did. With each step, he drew more and more energy from the ground beneath his feet pushing back at him, until he’d gathered an invisible storm of entropy around himself, a cloak of molecular disorder that easily deflected the ikeshtis’ first few panicked shots. In just a few seconds, he was among them, facing down the biggest one as the two next to him flinched in anticipation.</p> 
                <p>The large ikeshti took the opportunity to fire at the lashunta nearly point blank, two bullets screaming toward the ancient rune of Castrovel glowing in the middle of Velloro’s chest plate. Velloro grunted with the impact of the first, yet this he could use. As the atoms of the bullet interacted with those of his armor, disorder bloomed like a coalescing storm cloud. Molecular lattices broke and reformed in countless chain reactions, ones Velloro could shape, divert, invest—and control. As the second bullet hit fractions of a second later, Velloro used the explosive energy of the first, all its waste heat and shrapnel and friction, to mitigate the damage from the second. The shiny metal round clinked harmlessly off his armor, no more destructive than an idly flicked pebble. </p> 
                <p>The lizard creatures on either side of Velloro raised their guns, taking advantage of the momentary distraction to aim at Raia and Keskodai. But Velloro was ready to react, grabbing the barrels of both weapons with either hand and crumpling them as though they were made of thin-pressed aluminum, before dropping them to the ground with a smirk.</p> 
                <p>Velloro turned his attention back to the one ikeshti that was still armed and swung his fist in a wide arc, gathering the remaining excess energy into his chest before sending it screaming to his shoulder, down his arm, and into his fist, where it whirled and careened in an ever-growing nimbus of destructive energy. As his fist made contact with the stunned ikeshti, Velloro cut the tether with the disorder he’d hoarded, sending it fully into the creature’s dry and brittle armor, which splintered and caved in. The ikeshti fell to the ground writhing in pain, futilely scratching at the ruined clasps of its armor in a desperate attempt to relieve the crushing pressure.</p> 
                <p>As Velloro turned back to the other two ikeshtis, who’d drawn their batons and were advancing on him cautiously, a gruff and incredulous voice rang out from somewhere high up, bouncing off the towering flat walls of the fort.</p> 
                <p>“Velloro?”</p> 
                <p>He looked up and knew her immediately, a towering and extremely familiar shobhad who was shouldering a sniper rifle that had moments ago been leveled at Velloro’s head. As the shobhad held two of her four hands out to stop the ikeshtis, Velloro grinned at Keskodai, who had already begun to focus on ripping the newcomer’s mind apart with his own. </p> 
                <p><i>“Hold on a sec, bud. This should be interesting…”</i></p>

                <p>Speaking of Year 3, did you see last week’s blog about the newly released scenarios? More specifically, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021b9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-207-Four-for-the-First">Starfinder Society #2-07: Four for the First</a>? If you're a Starfinder and interested in Year 3 storyline development, check out <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgxw?Enter-The-New-Seeker">the blog</a> here. If you’ve played the scenario and wish to vote for your choice of First Seeker, visit our survey <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9X7LJ3C">here</a>.</p> 
                <p>Regarding Pathfinder Society (second edition). We have the <b>Retail Incentive Program</b> finalized. Hopefully we can get it added to the policies website and guide soon, but until then, posting here will get it into use. For the basics on how to use the Retail Incentive Programs, as well as the specifics for Pathfinder Society (first edition), Starfinder Society, and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/policies#retail-incentive">follow this link</a>.</p> 
                <h4>Primary Benefit (for all characters)</h4> 
                <p><b>Harder to Kill</b>: One time per game, reduce your dying condition value by 1. This can prevent you from dying. <br><i>Enhanced Version</i>: For the enhanced benefit, reduce your dying condition value by 2.</p> 
                <h4>Additional Benefits (each character chooses one)</h4> 
                <p><b>Cheaper Healing</b>: Before the end of the session, you can use the benefit to reduce the cost a single healing spell or ritual to remove a condition, affliction, or death to 90%. <br><i>Enhanced Version</i>: You instead reduce the cost to 80%.</p> 
                <p><b>Recover from Wounds</b>: Once per game, you can rest for 10 minutes to gain the result of a success on a trained DC 15 Treat Wounds. <br><i>Enhanced Version</i>: You instead gain the result of a success on a master DC 30 Treat Wounds.</p> 
                <p><b>Bonus Wealth</b>: When you roll a critical failure on a check to Earn Income, you get the results of a failure instead. <br><i>Enhanced Version</i>: When you fail or critically fail a check to Earn Income, you earn double the base amount of money from a failure.</p>

                <p>Attending SkalCon two weeks ago afforded me the opportunity to recognize several individuals for their contributions to our organized play programs.

                <h2>Stars</h2> 
                <p>September marks a momentous occasion for several GMs, as they earned their 5th GM star. To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! Thank you to the GMs listed below for their time and service on behalf of the Pathfinder Society! We appreciate you very much. Huzzah on their achievement!</p>

                <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> 
                <p>We’re closing in on having the nova evaluation tool appear on venture-captain’s “organizer” tab at Paizo.com. Until then, please email evaluation submissions to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> for collation.</p> 
                <p>With the launch of Pathfinder Society (second edition), we expect to see GMs with glyphs soon. If you’ve GMed 10 or more games, post in the comments so we can recognize the GMs of our newest program!</p> 
                <h2>Convention Listing</h2> 
                <p>Though the year draws to a close, convention season hasn’t wrapped up! You can play in Society games at any of the conventions listed below! The list includes all submissions as of 1 October. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>

                </div> 
                <p itemprop="description">Velloro was adopted into a large ysoki family on the dusty planet of Akiton as an infant, never knowing another home—and never having much interest in finding one. His family were devout worshipers of Iomedae, goddess of justice and honorable battle, virtues the young lashunta gladly embraced. He spent his youth playing and scavenging among Akiton’s numerous wrecked starships with his many siblings. Time and again, Velloro proved a fierce protector of his family, whether extracting them from collapsed wreckage, fighting off rival scavengers, or otherwise putting himself between them and the many other dangers of their dying world.</p> 
                <p>When Velloro reached adolescence, he developed into the korasha clade of his species, packing on muscle and becoming rather headstrong. As he grew, he became less able to squeeze into the small spaces common to salvage sites and began to look around for other ways to expend his boundless energy. His years of roughhousing and scrapyard scrapping quickly pointed him toward one obvious direction in Akiton’s limited job market: Velloro traveled to the ancient city of Arl to become a gladiator. The VitariTech Coliseum, a new sporting venue that hosted nonlethal gladiatorial combats, began rotating Velloro into their regular fight schedule. The arena promoters capitalized on his youthful and attractive appearance and off-world species, dubbing him the Castrovel Kid and giving him a set of armor sporting the planet’s ancient symbol. </p> 
                <p>As Velloro moved up through the ranks of other local combatants and gained a small following, he also became close with a fellow gladiator, a shobhad named Dhareen. She saw potential in the young competitor, and after defeating Velloro in a particularly important show match, Dhareen invited the dejected lashunta to take the Test of the Mountain. In this shobhad tradition, travelers climb to the summit of Ka, Pillar of the Sky, the tallest mountain in all the Pact Worlds. Velloro accepted the challenge, making the grueling 22-mile climb over several months.</p> 
                <p>While climbing Ka, the charismatic and sociable Velloro experienced something entirely new and, at first, unpleasant: loneliness. Yet as his isolation grew, so too did his connection to the mountain and to his home planet. He spent long evenings watching the wind blow dust off the volcano in arcing swirls, and took note of how each step he took changed the mountain in an almost imperceptible way. </p> 
                <p>One night, while sheltering under a shallow outcropping during a violent storm, Velloro felt a strange acceptance and calm wash over him. As he did, he noticed the whirling mixture of ashy sleet around him turn to a gentle eddy. With sudden clarity, Velloro remembered dozens of instances earlier in his life when he had subtly affected the state of matter around him—events he had dismissed as coincidence or even imagined. Invigorated, the lashunta began to intentionally exert control over his surroundings, structuring and deconstructing the molecular lattice all around him, draining energy from one system and pouring it into another as easily as pouring red tea between cups.</p> 
                <p>Upon his return to the Coliseum, Velloro had new purpose. He honed his newfound skills, mastering the subtleties of molecular change and using it to great effect in his gladiatorial matches. His tendency to crumple the armor and weapons of his opponents as he sent them flying across the arena quickly earned him the nickname the Castrovel Crusher. But change is constant, and as Akiton’s gladiatorial combats continued to gain in popularity, the demand for blood sport also grew. Claiming the need to compete with other arenas, including Eox’s infamous and deadly Halls of the Living, the Coliseum’s management began to pressure Velloro to mortally wound his opponents. Velloro adamantly refused; he saw no honor in needless blood sport.</p> 
                <p>One day, just before a match against Dhareen, Velloro’s manager told him, “finish her—or you’re finished.” Velloro walked into the arena, embraced his mentor, and deliberately walked out to an uproarious mixture of cheers and mockery, knowing he could never return to his beloved profession. Instead, Velloro turned an eye to the stars, where he knew there were others like his family, others who needed protection and assistance—and he knew he had the power to help.</p> 
                <p>Having inherited no small part of his ysoki family’s gregariousness, Velloro is quick to laugh and make new friends, and is an amiable adventuring companion. His Iomedaean personal code predisposes him to giving second chances, even to the seemingly irredeemable—but he doesn’t hesitate to unleash his full might against unrepentant foes. And despite the sour end to his gladiatorial career, his love of games and sport have not waned, and he is always happy to strike his famous Castrovel Crusher pose at a fan’s request.</p>

                <p>In Season 1, Game Master Jason Bulmahn led a group of five strangers who boarded a caravan heading to Lastwall, an ancient kingdom watching over the grave of a long-dead menace. Conscripted into the army, they faced years of training and service, but as smoke began to rise from the horizon, they came together as friends in order to have a chance at survival.</p> 
                <p>At the epic conclusion of Season 1, there were a number of stories left unresolved. The trail of one foe stands before them, but it is a journey that leads into the deepest darkness, and none of them will emerge unscathed,” said Jason Bulmahn.</p>
