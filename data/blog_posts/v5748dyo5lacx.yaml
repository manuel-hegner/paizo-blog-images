  \ Five</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 22, 2009</p> <i></i>\n    <p><i>5.\
  \ You have a scene where a large orc tribe is attacking a village. You have all\
  \ of the orcs and various NPCs represented on the map. Do you roll for each and\
  \ every orc and NPC, or do you, in the interest of saving time, just decide how\
  \ many of each side dies each round?</i></p> \n    <p><b>Lisa Stevens</b>: Usually\
  \ the background, especially if it's a bunch of no-named NPCs. But if it's a bunch\
  \ of NPCs that maybe they know and had invested a little time with, then I'll definitely\
  \ roll for them. I think it makes it more visceral if you have a situation where\
  \ the flower shopkeeper is about to get killed and they have to get to him before\
  \ the bad guys. When I ran the first <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> adventure, and there is the scene with all of the goblins\
  \ attacking ~~**SPOILER OMITTED**~~, I just sort of told my players that they saw\
  \ goblins running innocent townsfolk through. I think it lent an air of urgency\
  \ to the scene, where my players understood they had to hurry because people were\
  \ dying, and I think that accomplished that dramatic tension well enough.</p> <b></b>\n\
  \    <p><b>F. Wesley Schneider</b>: I usually just relegate that to background scenery.</p>\
  \ <b></b>\n    <p><b>James Jacobs</b>: I just keep it in the background, unless\
  \ a player gets involved. But if it's an important NPC, I keep track and give the\
  \ players time to do something about it.</p> <b></b>\n    <p><b>Erik Mona</b>: No,\
  \ I don't keep track of everything.</p> <b></b>\n    <p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b>: Nothing\
  \ is more vain and distracting than a GM who has two NPCs having a long conversation\
  \ between themselves and I feel it's the same with battle. Generally I let the PCs'\
  \ actions dictate the ebb and flow of the battle: if they are doing well, then their\
  \ side is doing well.</p> <b></b>\n    <p><b>Sean K Reynolds</b>: The scene reflects\
  \ how well the players are doing, so the action remains solely focused on the players.</p>\
  \ <b></b>\n    <p><b>Joshua J. Frost</b>: I roll for everything. It keeps combat\
  \ fair.</p> \n    <p><b>James Sutter</b>: I keep track of as much as they can interact\
  \ with. There's a good example in Savage Tide, there's the adventure Tides of Dread\
  \ where the players face an enormous invasion. With situations like that, I think\
  \ it's best to break things up into more manageable chunks. Because I mean, if you've\
  \ got 50 characters to keep track of, then a single round would take forever. </p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Chris Self</b>: I use mini rules for that, and keep things focused\
  \ on the players.</p> \n    <p><i>I'm too lazy to keep track of everything, but\
  \ I was once in a guy's campaign who kept track of everything; it was kind of cool,\
  \ in that I felt like there wasn't as much GM fiat.</i></p> \n    <p>Hank Woon <br>Editorial\
  \ Intern</p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: game mastering, interview, ask a pro-->\
