  \   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, April 25, 2007</p> \n   <p>Kobolds have been around\
  \ for a long time. From the ratlike little dog-men of the early editions, to the\
  \ more recent incarnation as draconic lizards, these guys remain one of the game's\
  \ favorite foils. Usually depicted as sneaky, conniving trap-makers, they also have\
  \ a history of being cute, pathetic monsters struggling to find their place in the\
  \ dungeon, usually at the bottom of the local food chain. When we went looking for\
  \ an iconic monster to kick off our line of 32-page modules, the kobold was an easy\
  \ choice.</p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"/image/product/secondary/Modules/9-Merlokrep.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote>\n   <p>We couldn't just settle\
  \ for the traditional kobold, though. Not when we had the chance to do so much more.\
  \ When we asked Senior Art Director Sean Glenn to redesign the stale old monster\
  \ and give it a fresh look, what we got back exceeded all of our expectations. (Sean,\
  \ for his part, readily admits to sending Sam, the World's Ugliest Dog, along as\
  \ reference. <a href=\"http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2005/11/22/314319/SamUgliestDogLulu.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Can you see the resemblance?</a>) Meaner, nastier, and definitely\
  \ more evil, these guys have that special something that sets them apart from the\
  \ pack. They have style. To give you an idea, here are some of the kobolds from\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wix\">\"Crown of the Kobold King.\"</a></p> \n   <p>The\
  \ reign of Merlokrep, first of his name, all-mighty Dragon King of the Truescale\
  \ Kobolds, has suffered misfortune from the day of his coronation. But the sturdy\
  \ resolve that saw him through the murder of his eighteen siblings and cleared his\
  \ path to the throne has held his tribe together through the accidents, attacks\
  \ by their new monstrous neighbors, and the king's own homicidal outbursts of rage\
  \ over both. Merlokrep is always happy to offer visitors an honored place as Great\
  \ Sacrifices to the Crown, ready to wine and dine them before ripping them open\
  \ and pulling out their hearts.</p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"/image/product/secondary/Modules/Deschamps-Kobold-scared.jpg\"\

  \ and Only One Allowed to Nag-Nag His Greatness, loves to gaze at her own reflection.\
  \ Her continued pursuit of shiny good-good causes an endless amount of trouble for\
  \ her King, resulting in a third of her tribe perishing in haphazard mining excavations\
  \ over the years. She immediately attempts the coquettish seduction of anyone that\
  \ enters her lair, but if her advances are rebuffed or her collection of shiny good-good\
  \ is threatened, she flies into a spitting rage that belies her sweet veneer and\
  \ attacks viciously.</p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"/image/product/secondary/Modules/6-Sacrifice.jpg\"\

  \ many \"He Who Forgets More Than You or He Knows,\" is the Truescale's shaman.\
  \ His mysterious prophecies are taken very seriously by the rest of the tribe, at\
  \ least when he is awake. Jekkajak is a walking corpse of a kobold, whose withered\
  \ old white scales are stretched tight over bone. His puny skeletal snout contains\
  \ a lone tooth and constantly dribbles drool. His milky eyes focus intermittently\
  \ on his surroundings.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <br clear=\"left\"><a href=\"/image/product/secondary/Modules/Deschamps-Kobold-crafty.jpg\"\

  \ foreman, Lekmek, works a gaggle of slaves to death in search of \"shiny good-good\"\
  \ for Vreggma. Sadly, gold is not on the menu in his glum mines, whose walls are\
  \ riddled instead with veins of iron ore. Vreggma's displeasure at the lack of gold\
  \ is the source of many headaches for Merlokrep, who in turn takes out his frustrations\
  \ on Lekmek. The foreman vents this mounting aggravation through harsh beatings\
  \ administered to his digger-slaves on an hourly basis.</p> \n   <p>Finally, its\
  \ never really made sense that all kobolds should be brownish gray. Since there\
  \ are five colors of chromatic dragon, we created five differently colored kobolds.\
  \ But when we got the art back from our artist, we discovered that we had not five,\
  \ but <i>six</i> colors. Which begs the question: what do we do with this guy? </p>\
