  >Friday, August 10, 2007</p> \n   <p>As our messageboards have recently been packed\
  \ with folks wanting to know more about the day-to-day business of Golarion, the\
  \ following is a brief introduction to the dating and timing conventions of our\
  \ world. Rest assured that you'll be able to find out much more—such as timelines,\
  \ country overviews, histories, and the rest—in the forthcoming <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zda\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer</i></a>. </p>\n   <p>Time travels on Golarion\
  \ much as it does here on our own Earth. Sixty seconds form a minute, sixty minutes\
  \ create an hour, and twenty-four hours make a day. The people of Golarion measure\
  \ time much like we do as well, with seven days to a week and twelve 30-day months\
  \ to a year.&nbsp;Years are marked since the founding of the last great empire,\
  \ that of Aroden, the Last Man. Although the empire has collapsed, its calendar\
  \ remains in use to this day. At the start of the campaign, the date is 4707 AR\
  \ (Absalom Reckoning).</p> \n   <h2>Days of the Week</h2> \n   <p>The days of the\
  \ week are as follows. Each day has a general purpose that most people in the Inner\
  \ Sea region follow.</p> \n   <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\"> \n    <tbody>\n\
  \     <tr>\n      <td><b>Day</b></td>\n      <td><b>General Purpose</b></td>\n \
  \    </tr> \n     <tr>\n      <td>Moonday</td>\n      <td>Work, religion [night]</td>\n\
  \     </tr> \n     <tr>\n      <td>Toilday</td>\n      <td>Work</td>\n     </tr>\
  \ \n     <tr>\n      <td>Wealday</td>\n      <td>Work</td>\n     </tr> \n     <tr>\n\
  \      <td>Oathday</td>\n      <td>Work, pacts signed, oaths sworn</td>\n     </tr>\
  \ \n     <tr>\n      <td>Fireday</td>\n      <td>Work</td>\n     </tr> \n     <tr>\n\
  \      <td>Starday</td>\n      <td>Work</td>\n     </tr> \n     <tr>\n      <td>Sunday</td>\n\
  \      <td>Rest, religion</td>\n     </tr> \n    </tbody>\n   </table> \n   <h2>Months</h2>\
  \ \n   <p>The months in Golarion correspond to our own, with each new year starting\
  \ shortly after the solstice. You'll notice that the name of each month is etymologically\
  \ tied to a specific god—residents of Golarion see the gods reflected in the changing\
  \ of the seasons, and their names for the months reflect this. (Gozreh's month,\
  \ for instance, is a time of budding and new life, while Zon-Kuthon's is seen as\
  \ the death of the old year.)&nbsp;Holidays in a given month are generally tied\
  \ to their patron deity. In order, the months are:</p> \n   <p>Abadius (January)\
  \ <br>Calistril (February) <br>Pharast (March) <br>Gozran (April) <br>Desnus (May)\
  \ <br>Sarenith (June) <br>Erastus (July) <br>Arodus (August) <br>Rova (September)\
  \ <br>Lamashan (October) <br>Neth (November) <br>Kuthona (December)</p> \n   <p>Mike\
