  \ December 4th, our friends at Owlcat Games began to unveil their newest classic\
  \ isometric CRPG game <a href=\"https://wrath.owlcatgames.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</i></a>! Based on the adventure path of the\
  \ same name, it will follow in the footsteps of <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i>, the\
  \ previous digital Pathfinder adaptation. The first key art image of the game has\
  \ been released as a teaser of things to come for the title. </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ alt=\"Pathfinder:Wrath of the Righteous keyart\" width=\"100%\"></a> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>While not a direct sequel to <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Pathfinder: Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous</i> will expand and elaborate on the core elements that made\
  \ Owlcat’s previous installment so successful. New features include the mythic progression\
  \ system, a new corner of the award-winning Age of Lost Omens setting to explore,\
  \ and more classes and character customizations drawn from Pathfinder's extensive\
  \ history. Owlcat will be releasing more details as development progresses so that\
  \ fans can stay caught up on how the process evolves over time. </p> \n     <p>“\
  We are tremendously excited to announce Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous today.\
  \ With our new game, we are taking everything that made Kingmaker enjoyable and\
  \ building on top of it. We laid a solid foundation and are going to push the boundaries\
  \ of the CRPG genre with our next title,” said Oleg Shpilchevskiy, Head of Owlcat\
  \ Games studio. “We especially want to thank the Kingmaker community for their support\
  \ because we would not be making this game if it weren’t for them. When Wrath of\
  \ the Righteous is ready, we cannot wait to see them answer the call again.” </p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</i> will be based on the tabletop\
  \ Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path and include new characters, plots, and elements\
  \ to entertain even players already familiar with the adventure. It will tell the\
  \ story of a large-scale conflict between mortals and demons where players are invited\
  \ to immerse themselves in a world under siege from demonic forces. As a vicious\
  \ invasion threatens the world, the consequences of one’s decisions will forge a\
  \ unique narrative of their personal battle between good and evil.</p> \n     <p>Kingmaker’\
  s Creative Director Alexander Mishulin and Lead Writer Alexander Komzolov return\
  \ to their respective roles, and Owlcat confirmed that Chris Avellone is back on\
  \ board lending a hand and supporting the narrative team as he did with <i>Pathfinder:\
  \ Kingmaker.</i></p> \n     <p>To stand against the demonic invasion, the player\
  \ character and their companions will receive additional powers from the player’\
  s chosen mythic path. These paths vary widely in nature and profoundly impact the\
  \ storyline of the game, permanently changing the characters and the world around\
  \ them. Players may choose the path of the immortal lich, wielding powerful spells\
  \ and commanding an army of undead; the path of the trickster, causing mischief\
  \ and finding fun even in the middle of the demon-filled abyss; the path of the\
  \ angel, summoning celestial allies into battle and meting bolts of divine judgment\
  \ upon foes; or something else entirely.</p> \n     <p>Some Pathfinder RPG character\
  \ classes that didn’t make it into Kingmaker will make their CRPG debut in Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous alongside the returning roster, including — but not limited to\
  \ — the fan-favorite witch and oracle. More classes and character options will be\
  \ revealed in the near future.</p> \n     <p>Boasting an improved visual style,\
  \ <i>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</i> will offer a look and feel distinct\
  \ from that of Pathfinder: Kingmaker. Set in locations including a demon-infested\
  \ wasteland, besieged crusader cities, and the foul, twisted Abyss itself, the art\
  \ will capture the epic fight of the world’s defenders as they struggle to hold\
  \ the line against the corrupting force of otherworldly entities. </p> \n     <h3>Links</h3>\
