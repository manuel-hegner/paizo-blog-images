  \ side, this starship is designed to be fast, stealthy, and hard hitting. The standard\
  \ crew comprises a half-dozen well-trained Stewards, but Banshees have seen field\
  \ duty with as few as two people—an arrangement made easier by the fact that the\
  \ ship’s weapons are concentrated in a turret and one forward mount. The typical\
  \ Banshee can also carry a small contingent of marines for boarding actions and\

  \       <p><em>“You find scars and bruises on your body but don’t recall an injury,\
  \ enter a room and forget why you’re there, surf holovids for what feels like only\
  \ five minutes but an hour has passed, or are quite certain you completed a task\
  \ only to find it unfinished. These are symptoms of an encounter with the grays.\
  \ They involve themselves in every aspect of your life, but you’ve never heard of\
  \ them. They watch you constantly, but you’ve never seen them. They’re the nightmare\
  \ of an intruder that you can’t recall. They prod and probe, but you forget. Remember!\
  \ Make yourself REMEMBER!<br> —From the personal journal of Steward Reyard Maldun</em></p>\
  \ \n       <p>The following are excerpts from the personal journal of Steward Reyard\
  \ Maldun, discovered in a locked box behind a false panel in an apartment leased\
  \ to “K. Carlock” almost 2 years after Reyard’s disappearance on 2 Rova, 317 ag.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>WHO ARE THE GRAYS?<br> That’s the first question most people ask:\
  \ Who are they? Let’s start with what we know. Grays are named for their gray‐skinned\
  \ bodies because no one knows what else to call them. They have a basic humanoid\
  \ shape with a symmetrical body, a single pair of arms, and a single pair of legs.\
  \ Their hands and feet are strikingly similar to those of humans, though generally\
  \ smaller and more delicate, with elongated fingers. Their stature is like that\
  \ of a ysoki or a human child, but each has a bulbous head on a small, wiry frame.\
  \ A gray’s face is a stoic mask with two relatively large, black, emotionless eyes\
  \ and an almost nonexistent nose with two nostrils no larger than a data port. Their\
  \ mouths are tiny and slit‐like, which makes one wonder what they eat.</p> \n  \
  \     <p>Grays have no trouble maintaining balance with precise grace, despite their\
  \ over‐large heads. Reports say they sometimes stand in perfect stillness for several\
  \ moments before acting all at once, each movement perfect as if choreographed and\
  \ well rehearsed. The movement of a gray is so deliberate and agile, it would rival\
  \ that of a finely tuned robot, yet their flesh is certainly organic.”</p>\n   \

  \      <p>“Look, no one cares what happened to the researchers who previously owned\
  \ this engine. Y’know why? Because this thing stops freakin’ time, that’s why! Picture\
  \ this. You’re cruisin’ through the Diaspora in your Vagabond, just mindin’ your\
  \ own business, when your sensors ping a gunship filled with pirates screamin’ in\
  \ at full burn, gyrolasers hot. But you got this, because you made a savvy purchase\
  \ from ol’ Pogo before you left this station. Your engineer turns one lousy knob,\
  \ and boom! That enemy ship locks in place like it’s caught in a tractor beam! Meanwhile,\
  \ your crew’s buzzin’ around the deck as if you spiked their morning coffee with\
  \ liquid thasteron! Who’s got the drop on who now, scum suckers? Arm the plasma\
  \ torpedoes—it’s time to make pirate paste!”<br> —Pogo Quick, ysoki tech broker</p>\
  \ \n       <p>While modern scientific and engineering knowledge might appear to\
  \ cover nearly all aspects of life, hundreds of intellectual questions remain unanswered.\
  \ Though Triune granted access to the blueprints of Drift technology, no one has\
  \ yet ascertained why using this technology rends a portion of a random plane into\
  \ the Drift. The union of magic and technology has solved many modern problems,\
  \ but travelers continue to experience dilemmas related to perfecting interspecies\
  \ communication, understanding astronomical phenomena, overcoming biological diseases\
  \ that may accompany first contact with alien creatures, and myriad other obstacles.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>When mainstream science is unable to explain the origins of mysterious\
  \ phenomena, the curious open their minds to more radical explanations, hoping to\
  \ find even a trace of plausible explanation in an expanse of doubt. These practitioners\
  \ often participate in what some call “fringe science,” a generic term for fields\
  \ of study that diverge from the theories generally considered to be rudimentary\
  \ by experts within a specific discipline. To traditional scientists, fringe science\
  \ is a fool’s errand, as it usually relies on premises that may have been previously\
  \ refuted and can often be performed by someone with no academic background. While\
  \ this is true in some cases, some fringe scientists use methods that are just as\
  \ statistically significant and reproducible as their more traditional counterparts.\
  \ Fringe scientists often remind others that many disciplines, such as interplanetary\
  \ communication or cybernetic and biological augmentation, were once considered\
  \ little more than fantasies before true genius unlocked the power behind their\
  \ mysteries.</p> \n       <p>The following disciplines represent fringe science\
  \ practiced within the Pact Worlds and systems beyond, as well as some equipment\
  \ associated with these fields.”</p>\n      </blockquote> \n      <p>For more mad\
