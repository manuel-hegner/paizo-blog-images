  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The\
  \ Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set of prepainted plastic <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> fantasy gaming figures is officially out and available in\
  \ the wild! You can pick them up from your local retailer order the figures by <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9er4\">case or brick</a>, or select your favorites from the\
  \ list of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/singles/rustyDragonInn\">singles</a> available\
  \ from the set. I've been hearing from folks with an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
  >Ongoing Case Subscription</a> that subscriber cases have begun to arrive, and as\
  \ you're all opening your minis or deciding which ones to get, I'd like to take\
  \ a moment to look at the set as a whole and share some of my thoughts about how\
  \ it came together, and how it turned out.</p> \n    <p>I've always wanted to do\
  \ a <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> set themed around a tavern.\
  \ Most of my own campaigns tend to spend a lot of time in the city, and player characters\
  \ can't help but get themselves into trouble when they're visiting the local watering\
  \ hole. Paizo's tavern-themed <a href=\"/pathfinder/maps/flipMats\">Flip-Mats</a>\
  \ almost always sell out soon after we print them, proving that I'm not the only\
  \ one who says \"roll initiative\" as often as \"what'll you have?\" when my player\
  \ characters enter the tavern.</p> \n    <p>When we announced <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set several months ago, I knew that some folks\
  \ would be concerned that the set was too NPC-heavy, so I made sure to include as\
  \ many cool monsters as I possibly could, with a slight bias toward creatures I\
  \ thought worked well in an urban environment (namely, ghouls). We also had a few\
  \ hold-overs originally intended for earlier sets, like <a href=\"/products/btpy9it5\"\
  >Zilvazaraat</a>, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9it3\">Large Silver Dragon</a>, and\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ist\">Gorgon</a>. And, perhaps most importantly,\
  \ the set gave us a chance to execute an idea I've been kicking around with WizKids\
  \ for a long time—doing a major terrain piece as a special limited edition \"case\
  \ incentive\" figure, in this case the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ehn\">Tavern Bar</a>.\
  \ Add to this the continuing experiment with dungeon dressing and my first chance\
  \ to include things like the <a href=\"/products/btpy9itb\">Cart</a> and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9itc\">Large Cart</a>, and you've got a set I've been excited about\
  \ for a long, long time. It's finally here, and here are some of my own thoughts\
  \ from along the way, and especially from opening my own personal case last weekend.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Dungeon Dressing</h2> \n    <p>I'm thrilled with how the dungeon dressing\
  \ came out for <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>.\
  \ From a gamer perspective, like a lot of you, I'd prefer more <a href=\"/products/btpy9it7\"\
  >tables</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9ita\">crates</a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9it8\"\
  >barrels</a> than are included in a single case, but I'm also sensitive to folks\
  \ who don't enjoy their monster or NPC figures being swapped out for a piece of\
  \ furniture. Demand for these pieces is extremely high (I think they all sold out\
  \ within a couple of days of our first singles release batch), and that's a factor\
  \ we will continue to weigh with WizKids to determine the best mix in future releases.\
  \ The next set also contains a bunch of cool dungeon dressing pieces, and I'm eager\
  \ for you to get a look at them. Beyond that, anything is possible. Please leave\
  \ a note in the comments with suggestions of additional pieces of dungeon dressing\
  \ you'd like to see in future sets.</p> \n    <h2>Singles Sales</h2> \n    <p><a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderbattles/singles/rustyDragonInn\">Singles</a> from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> have sold incredibly well,\
  \ with 14 figures already out of stock on paizo.com within the first week of the\
  \ set's release. That's a phenomenal show of support for the set, and I think it\
  \ probably bodes well for the overall sales we're expecting to see this time around.\
  \ We know that the new paizo.com sales strategy for singles (ending sales at the\
  \ end of the month) caused some alarm with subscribers who did not have their case\
  \ to know what they might want or need before high-demand singles started vanishing\
  \ from the site, and I've had a chat with our warehouse and web store team, and\
  \ I'm confident that we will be releasing at least one more \"wave\" of singles\
  \ before the end of the month, timed after we believe most subscribers will have\
  \ received their cases. Watch this space very closely in the coming weeks for an\
  \ announcement when this next batch goes on sale. We'll do the best we can to make\
  \ sure that if you want a single from this set, you'll have a good chance of getting\
  \ it, so long as you act quickly.</p> \n    <h2>Rusty Dragon Flip-Mat?</h2> \n \
  \   <p>In recent comment threads regarding the set, I've seen a lot of suggestions\
  \ that we release a Rusty Dragon Inn Flip-Mat scaled to the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ehn\"\
  >Tavern Bar</a> case incentive and designed for optimal use with the set. I think\
  \ that's a fantastic idea, and I'm relatively confident that we'll do it—eventually.\
  \ The actual size and contents of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ehn\">Tavern Bar</a>\
  \ set were in flux until very late in the game, and I want to be able to match the\
  \ scale on this stuff exactly so that everything fits the way it should. Suffice\
  \ it to say, this is very likely coming, but probably not as rapidly as you might\
  \ like it to. A good idea is worth taking the time to do right.</p> \n    <h2>Overall\
  \ Impressions</h2> \n    <p>I'm thrilled with this set overall. As usual when you\
  \ crack a case, some elements of rarity choices become more clear in your hand and\
  \ on your table than they did in your head. Had I a chance to do it again, I might\
  \ move the <a href=\"/products/btpy9is5\">Bunyip</a> to uncommon, for example, but\
  \ that's really just a quibble. The paint jobs on the rares are remarkable (especially\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9isx\">Allevrah, Elf General</a>), and overall I think\
  \ the factory did a good job, even on the faces (which is one of the toughest aspects\
  \ of making these miniatures). I'm really happy with a lot of the figure and rarity\
  \ choices, and I'm eager to use these figures on the table. I've already used the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9isw\">Half-Elf Enchanter</a> as a conductor leading a\
  \ little band of a <a href=\"/products/btpy9isv\">Half-Elf Bard</a>, a small circle\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9ise\">Dwarf Bard</a> drummers, and three <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9is9\">Dancing Girls</a>. That's an encounter right there. I love\
  \ it when random collections of figures from a single set fit so well together.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So, what do you think of the set? What are your favorite figures? Where\
  \ do you think we could have done a better job? And, as always, what else would\
  \ you like to see in future sets?</p> \n    <p>Let's debrief <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> in comments!</p> \n    <p>I'll bring the beer.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until next time, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
