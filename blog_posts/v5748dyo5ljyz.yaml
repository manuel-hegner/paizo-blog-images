  description\"><i>The Wayfinders represent some of the Society's foremost experts\
  \ in first contact scenarios. An organization dedicated to fully pursuing the Starfinder\
  \ Society's mission statement of exploration, the Wayfinders are at the forefront\
  \ of expeditions to scan a planet, set foot on an asteroid, or greet a previously\
  \ unknown species. Wayfinders have a natural passion for exploration, be it through\
  \ social situations with new species or discovering ancient alien ruins.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Before I start this blog, I want to congratulate some of you on being\
  \ excellent detectives. The Organized Play team worked diligently in putting together\
  \ a release schedule for our Starfinder Society factions, which we're now in the\
  \ process of unveiling. At PaizoCon, several of you approached me and mentioned\
  \ something about \"the Wayfinders\" and I feigned ignorance and made jokes about\
  \ magical compasses. It appears that one of our scenarios let this secret out way\
  \ earlier than anticipated... so, it's about time to dish out some facts.</p> \n\
  \    <p>With the Wayfinders faction, we have a group of like-minded Starfinders\
  \ with a common interest: exploration. Starfinders working with the Wayfinders specialize\
  \ in going beyond the Pact Worlds and into the star systems beyond. They eagerly\
  \ travel into the Vast to seek out new life and new civiliz... they eagerly explore\
  \ the Vast and engage with alien species, learning about foreign cultures and crafting\
  \ strong alliances between the Starfinder Society and alien organizations. Many\
  \ outsiders consider the Wayfinders' boundless enthusiasm for exploration as reckless;\
  \ some even cite the recent Scoured Stars incident as a reason for the Starfinder\
  \ Society—particularly the Wayfinders—to take a more cautious approach to exploring\
  \ the Vast.</p> \n    <p>A faction as dedicated as the Wayfinders deserves a dedicated\
  \ leader. Fitch (CN female ysoki technomancer), not only provides active support\
  \ to fellow Wayfinders, she also goes out of her way to help Starfinders without\
  \ ties to her faction. <a href=\"/products/btpy9tt0?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-103-Yesteryears-Truth\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-03: Yesteryear's Truth</em></a>, by Paizo's own Jason\
  \ Keeley, is a fine example of Fitch stepping in to energetically support fellow\
  \ Starfinders going on missions into the Vast. I suspect many players will enjoy\
  \ interacting with Fitch, especially after getting a chance to meet the faction\
  \ leader onboard the Wayfinders' flagship: the Master of Stars.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ by Sebastian Rodriguez</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Now, I've backed myself into\
  \ a corner when it comes to showcasing these factions. In the last two blog posts,\
  \ I've shown off some boons related to the factions. So, I suppose it makes sense\
  \ to showcase something specific to the Wayfinders. Like I did with the last two\
  \ previewed boons, I'm going to showcase a different category of boon for the Wayfinders.\
  \ Allow me to introduce something we've been calling a capstone boon.</p> \n   \
  \ <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Alien Allies (Untyped Boon)</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">Your tireless contributions to the Wayfinders'\
  \ cause has not only uncovered unknown worlds; you've also introduced a new species\
  \ into the Society.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Wayfinders:\
  \ Tier 4</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Cost</b>: 4 Fame</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Benefit</b>: When you select this boon, it does not\
  \ apply to your current character. Instead, select one of your Starfinder Society\
  \ characters with 0 XP. That character can select a new playable race without expending\
  \ the personal boon slot. That character cannot slot a different race boon into\
  \ the personal boon slot, but can slot another type of personal boon. The rules\
  \ on this new race will be made available in a future update—and may vary by season.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b>: A new character can only benefit\
  \ from this boon once. You can only purchase this boon once per character.</p> \n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <p>Ok, I guess I can't just smoke bomb out after dropping\
  \ something like that, can I?</p> \n    <p>Each of our factions will have a capstone\
  \ boon. These boons are all untyped boons that apply to a new character in the Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild. The Wayfinders' boon is something that the organized\
  \ play team knows is popular: access to new races. As the boon says, the specifics\
  \ of the new race aren't yet detailed, which is quite intentional (I swear, I'm\
  \ not skimping out on work). John and I have schemed together and already have potential\
  \ candidates for this new race, but the result will come down to player choice.\
  \ Hint: Just like in Pathfinder Society, the reporting conditions will be very important\
  \ to the continued narrative of the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild campaign.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Alrighty, another week, another faction complete! Check back soon, when\
  \ I present details on the Dataphiles—a faction we've talked about before, but have\
  \ some new ‘data' to share (*badumtish*). Ok, that joke was bad and I'm sorry...\
  \ but believe me when I say, you'll want to come back to read about the Dataphiles\
  \ and a new subset of boon that's sure to shake up how people think about gaming\
  \ in the organized play format!</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder\
