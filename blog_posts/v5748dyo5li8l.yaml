  \ itemprop=\"description\">Do you have a favorite bar? I do. It's called <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, and it's coming your way\
  \ in prepainted miniature form in January! Over the last few months, I've been previewing\
  \ figures from the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ set, and with last week's preview, I've revealed all of the new sculpts in <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ have not yet revealed the final version of the special limited edition case incentive.\
  \ I'm happy to correct that now with this amazing image, courtesy of our friends\
  \ at WizKids:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151113-RustyDragonInn.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151113-RustyDragonInn_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This image includes two complete case incentive sets,\
  \ plus a lot of figures and some dungeon dressing from the full set. The final piece\
  \ list for a single case incentive box is:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>3 Long Barfront\
  \ Sections</li> \n     <li>1 Corner Piece</li> \n     <li>2 Bar Shelf Sections</li>\
  \ \n     <li>1 Table</li> \n     <li>6 Bottles (2 sets of 3)</li> \n     <li>2 Barrels</li>\
  \ \n     <li>1 Small Keg</li> \n     <li>4 Stools</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>The table\
  \ and barrels are alt-deco repaints of the standard table and barrel from the main\
  \ set. Everything else is a new sculpt unique to the case incentive. I'm very excited\
  \ about the look of this incentive, and I hope that it will bring life and excitement\
  \ to your fantasy RPG campaigns.</p> \n    <p>Canny readers will also notice a couple\
  \ of familiar faces from earlier sets among the assembled crowd in this imageâ€”Feiya,\
  \ Human Witch, and King Irovetti. Both of these figures are intended as replacements\
  \ for previously released figures that simply did not meet Paizo or WizKids's quality\
  \ standards.</p> \n    <p>I have confirmed that these two replacement figures will\
  \ be inserted together randomly into boosters in the set, at an intended rate of\
  \ 1 pair per brick. These replacements will not replace any figures (the booster\
  \ they are in will contain 6 figures).</p> \n    <p>Finally, I'd like to talk a\
  \ little bit about singles, and particularly singles on sale here at paizo.com.\
  \ For past sets, we have stocked a very large number of single figures for sale\
  \ on our website. We still have stock on hand for many older figures, allowing customers\
  \ to pick and choose and to take their time in deciding which specific figures they\
  \ would like to purchase.</p> \n    <p>Starting with <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, we're changing the way we offer singles for\
  \ sale on paizo.com. We will have a limited selection of figures available for roughly\
  \ the first two weeks after release, but following that we will not be offering\
  \ any singles for sale for this set. You will likely be able to get them from other\
  \ retailers, if you must, but I want to give an early warning that supply for <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> will likely be significantly\
  \ lower than in previous sets. No longer will we be offering enough figures to last\
  \ several years. If you prefer to \"pick and choose\" your <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> figures, I HIGHLY recommend that you do so as close to the\
  \ set's official release as possible. I definitely cannot guarantee you will be\
  \ able to wait and choose. In fact, I can guarantee you that you won't be able to,\
  \ at least here at Paizo.com.</p> \n    <p>As with previous sets, the best way to\
  \ ensure that you do not miss a single figure is to <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
  >set up an ongoing case subscription</a> or <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\">preorder\
  \ a case</a> today.</p> \n    <p>We'll be back next week with a look at more miniatures\
  \ goodness. For now, it's Friday evening, and I'm headed to the bar for a drink!</p>\
