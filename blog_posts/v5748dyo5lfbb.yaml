  description\">It's Friday, which means a new raft of previews of the upcoming <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic miniatures! But first, an update: The\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a> set's official release\
  \ date is now OCTOBER 16. The set will formally release well in time for marathon\
  \ Halloween game sessions, and just in time for you to give out the coolest Halloween\
  \ treats on the block!</span></p> \n    <p>This week I wanted to show off several\
  \ figures that have never been seen before, either at Gen Con or anywhere else.\
  \ All five of these beasties are making their world debut here on the Paizo Blog\
  \ this evening. Buckle up!</p> \n    <p>We've already shown you the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lf4k\"\
  >Djinni</a> and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lexa\">Efreeti</a> figures. This\
  \ week I want to show off the three remaining genies in the set, starting with the\
  \ gorgeous Marid.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Marid_500_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Marid_500_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here she is in all her towering glory. The Marid,\
  \ associated with the element of water, is the most powerful of the standard genies\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>, and she's also\
  \ the largest. This version is derived from the gorgeous Jesper Ejsing illustration\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\">Bestiary</a>, which originally adorned a\
  \ cover for our “Arabian Nights” Adventure Path, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/legacyOfFire\"\
  >Legacy of Fire</a>. WizKids did a great job translating her to three dimensions.\
  \ This Large figure is slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Shaitan_500_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Shaitan_500_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And here we have the Shaitan, the earth-based genie\
  \ cousin of the Marid. Again we used a Jesper Ejsing illustration as the basis for\
  \ the figure, which I'm discovering is a good recipe for a gorgeous miniature. The\
  \ colors on this one compliment each other perfectly, and her expression is great.\
  \ Again, the Shaitan is a Large, rare figure, though she's not quite so big as her\
  \ watery companion.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Janni_500_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Janni_500_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The lowly Jann are formed of all four elements, and\
  \ must spend a great deal more time on the material plane than their more powerful\
  \ relatives in the genie family. In fact, Jann look much like normal humans, which\
  \ in this case means this figure easily doubles as a human enemy or player character.\
  \ He's got brass knuckles, but also works as an unarmed combatant such as a monk.\
  \ Like his cousins, the Janni is a rare, but in this case he's much smaller, coming\
  \ in at size Medium.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-BlackDragon_500_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-BlackDragon_500_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This nasty fellow is the Medium Black Dragon,\
  \ but don't let the size fool you into thinking he doesn't pack a powerful punch.\
  \ Based on a great Ben Wootten illustration, this guy ably represents the smallest\
  \ black dragon statted up in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>.\
  \ Size wise, he's about the same height as the <a href=\"/products/btpy8sfq\">Young\
  \ Red Dragon</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>,\
  \ which by today's standards would have probably been a Medium. I'll show off the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy91sj\">Red Dragon Evolution</a> photos soon (probably\
  \ next week), and you'll see that we already officially made that change there,\
  \ with the previously Large Young Red Dragon showing up as a Medium repaint alongside\
  \ awesome new Large and Huge Red Dragon sculpts. But I am getting ahead of myself.\
  \ The dastardly Medium Black Dragon is rare, Medium, and extremely awesome.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Hodag_500_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Hodag_500_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of awesome, one of my favorite aspects of\
  \ the Pathfinder RPG is incorporating monsters from real world mythology. Often\
  \ this means pulling in creatures from ancient Greece, Egypt, or other Old World\
  \ sources. Here we have a critter very much from America's side of the pond. Ladies\
  \ and gentlemen, I give you the Hodag, menace of Northern Wisconsin. The Hodag got\
  \ its start in an 1890s hoax, in which a local prankster described the creature\
  \ to an area newspaper like this: \"the head of a frog, the grinning face of a giant\
  \ elephant, thick short legs set off by huge claws, the back of a dinosaur, and\
  \ a long tail with spears at the end.\" I'd say WizKids nailed it. The Hodag appears\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</a>. In the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a> set, he's a Large, uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And that's it for this week. Look for another big preview next Friday.</p>\
