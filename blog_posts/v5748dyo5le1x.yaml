  \   </div> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Pathfinder Battles Preview: Water, Water,\
  \ Everywhere</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, November 9, 2012</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>In what seems like a first for these late fall\
  \ Pathfinder Battles preview blogs, it's actually not raining outside our Washington\
  \ State offices as I write this. But don't worry, I'm sure it soon will be. These\
  \ last few weeks have shown us all the devastating power of nature, so I thought\
  \ it might make a good occasion to show you two water-themed creatures from January's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted\
  \ fantasy miniatures.</p> \n    <p>I'm speaking, of course, of water elementals.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">This set (and the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >Shattered Star Adventure Path</a> that inspired it) features two different sizes\
  \ of water elementals, the Medium Water Elemental and the Large Water Elemental.\
  \ As with the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldwh\">Fire Elementals</a> we've already\
  \ previewed, water elementals are a staple of Pathfinder RPG play. Making miniatures\
  \ of our elementals is somewhat problematic, however, as the <a href=\"h/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a> features images that are not really suitable for turning\
  \ into 3D figurines, and not all sizes are covered by those illustrations, anyway.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>In this case, we already faced a similar problem when we put together\
  \ our <a href=\"/products/btpy8tj5\">Pathfinder Pawns Bestiary Box</a> collection\
  \ of cardboard pawns. For that set, we enlisted one of our favorite artists, Tyler\
  \ Walpole, to create brand new images for Small, Medium, and Large elementals of\
  \ the four common types. I happened to be building the Pathfinder Battles Shattered\
  \ Star list at the same time, so we asked Tyler to pull double duty on his assignment,\
  \ creating images that would work for both Pathfinder Pawns and Pathfinder Battles\
  \ figures.</p> \n    <p>While the Shattered Star set does not contain Small elementals\
  \ of any type, it's probably not too big a spoiler to reveal that it does contain\
  \ Medium and Large elementals of the four main types: air, earth, fire, and water.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>WizKids did a great job sculpting Tyler's images into three dimensions.\
  \ Here we have the Medium Water Elemental, a common figure:</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121107-MediumWater.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121107-MediumWater_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>As with all the elementals in this set, this guy is\
  \ sculpted in clear plastic, so it looks really cool when held up to the light.\
  \ The Medium Water Elemental looms over other Medium creatures, casting an imposing\
  \ shadow upon his enemies.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of imposing, it's pretty hard to\
  \ imagine a cooler Large Water Elemental than this:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121107-LargeWater.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121107-LargeWater_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The clear effects are more pronounced on this Large\
  \ figure, which really pushes the envelope on what can be considered Large in the\
  \ Pathfinder game. Even action figures would have reason to fear a drowning at this\
  \ \"miniature's\" hands. </p> \n    <p>Don't believe me? Check out what both of\
  \ these figures look like on my desk facing of against our Medium iconic fighter,\
  \ Valeros. I hope he brought his swimming trunks!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ cool reveals from the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a>\
