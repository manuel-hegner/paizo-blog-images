  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As excited as we were to construct\
  \ the <a href=\"/starfinder/beginnerbox\"><em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em></a> as\
  \ a fun, intuitive, and effective introduction to the Starfinder universe, we were\
  \ also daunted by the challenges of trying to make a complete game that did justice\
  \ to something we first presented in a 528-page rulebook. Even just the Tactical\
  \ Rules chapter of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> is more than 50 pages long,\
  \ which would eat up more than a quarter of the pagecount we had in the Beginner\
  \ Box rulebooks that also needed a solo adventure, introductory adventure, an introduction\
  \ to numerous RPG concepts, advice, character classes, setting material, and so\
  \ much more.</p> \n    <p>Early on we had to make some tough decisions about what\
  \ our goal was for this product, and how our goal would inform our design choices.\
  \ One of the things we wanted this product to do was serve as both an introduction\
  \ to Roleplaying Games in general, and an introduction to the most key concepts\
  \ of Starfinder in particular. When we were discussing which rules to keep, which\
  \ to alter, and which to cut entirely, we had to balance those design goals with\
  \ things like the limitations of our page count, wanting to be playable quickly\
  \ from the time the box is opened, and giving enough material that a group could\
  \ continue to play with their GM making new adventures once all the pre-written\
  \ encounters have been experienced. That lead to the decision to create a one page\
  \ set of rules for modifying and even building enemy creatures from scratch, so\
  \ GMs would not be limited to the small number of creatures we had room to present\
  \ with full stat blocks.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/SFBB-Cover.jpg\"><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/SFBB-Cover_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Some decisions were based on a combination of concerns.\
  \ We felt we wanted to have as many of the playable races and classes from the Core\
  \ Rulebook as possible, but knew we could do all the core races, and legacy races,\
  \ and all the classes, especially given we wanted each class to tell you how to\
  \ build a character. In the end, we decided we needed to cut at least one class,\
  \ and the solarian was clearly the one that needed the most complex explanations\
  \ of its different rules. Since our iconic solarian is a kastha, we also removed\
  \ that as a playable race so all our remaining iconics could represent one class\
  \ and one race.</p> \n    <p>In other cases, we had goals that drove us to add additional\
  \ components. The desire for the game to be a complete experience in a box meant\
  \ it had to have dice, and character pawns, and a map. Joe Pasini specifically had\
  \ the great idea to add player reference cards with things like the actions a character\
  \ to take each turn clearly spelled out. We hadn't originally planned to have that\
  \ kind of stand-alone player aid, but it was immediately apparent how useful that\
  \ would be to simplifying the process of being able to play and learn the game,\
  \ so we took the time to design them and added them to the components box!</p> \n\
  \    <p>It's also important to acknowledge how much we leaned on the design choices\
  \ of people who have made entry-level boxed sets before us. Many of the Starfinder\
  \ team have fond memories of some specific early introduction to RPGs, and we discussed\
  \ what made those experiences fun and memorable, and what we thought we could improve\
  \ upon. The fantastic work done on the 1st-edition <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em>\
  \ was a crucial road map for us, and while we often decided to take different twists\
  \ and turns in our design challenge, it was extremely useful to have such a successful\
  \ product as a starting point, allowing us to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>\
