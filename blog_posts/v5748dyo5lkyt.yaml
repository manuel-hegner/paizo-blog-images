  \ noticed, we haven't said much about half-elves and half-orcs except to confirm\
  \ that they'll be part of the Pathfinder Playtest. Of all of the ancestry choices\
  \ in Pathfinder, these were two of the trickiest to design. With the way that the\
  \ feats are structured, it would be easy enough to just list the feats from both\
  \ parents (plus some unique options), but that quickly led to cherry-picking the\
  \ best of both. Moreover, that approach didn't address the base statistics of the\
  \ ancestry that are very important to overall balance, such as starting hit points\
  \ and speed.</p> \n    <p>In the end, we decided to make both half-elves and half-orcs\
  \ an addition to the human ancestry. You start by selecting human, then take the\
  \ corresponding heritage feat to represent your diverse ancestry. Let's take a look\
  \ at the half-elf feat.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Half-Elf <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 1</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Heritage, Human</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Either one of your parents\
  \ was an elf, or one or both were half-elves. You have pointed ears and other telltale\
  \ signs of elven heritage. You gain the elf trait. Select two of the following benefits:\
  \ elven speed (increase your Speed by 5 feet), elven tongue (add Elven to your list\
  \ of languages), gifted speaker (you are trained in Diplomacy), or low-light vision\
  \ (you can see in dim light as well as you can in bright light). In addition, you\
  \ can select elf, half-elf, and human feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b> You can select this feat twice.\
  \ The second time, it loses the heritage trait and you gain the other two benefits.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>This approach comes with a number of advantages.\
  \ First off, it lets us make a half-elf that truly does have some of the advantages\
  \ of both ancestries, while still allowing you to pick the parts that you think\
  \ best represent your character's upbringing. Grew up among elves? Then picking\
  \ up the Elven language makes sense. Had to explain yourself to the humans you grew\
  \ up with? Then being trained in Diplomacy might be the way to go. As with all of\
  \ our ancestries, we wanted the choice of being a half-elf or half-orc to be meaningful\
  \ to your character and expressive of the backstory that you've decided to create.\
  \ This ancestry feat gives a lot of benefits; to get similar benefits, you would\
  \ normally use a general feat to pick up Adoptive Ancestry, which grants you access\
  \ to the ancestry feats from another ancestry (as long as they don't have physiological\
  \ requirements) to represent your deep connection to another ancestry's culture\
  \ and traditions. However, being a half-elf gives you access to human feats, elf\
  \ feats, and half-elf feats (including feats with physiological components), as\
  \ well as two additional benefits.</p> \n    <p>At this point, you might be saying,\
  \ wait, what about humans in general? Let's take a look at some of their options.\
  \ At its core, human is a very flexible ancestry, with choices like Natural Ambition\
  \ to gain an extra 1st-level class feat, General Training to gain an extra 1st-level\
  \ general feat, and Skilled to gain training in two additional skills. However,\
  \ humans also have fun options for particular builds, like this one for a character\
  \ who wants to reduce the penalties for being untrained.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Clever Improviser <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Feat 1</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Human</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">You've learned how to handle situations where you're out of your\
  \ depth. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks for skills in which you're untrained.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Of course, this approach for half-elves and half-orcs\
  \ means that we needed to include a few orc feats in the book so players would get\
  \ the complete experience of being a half-orc. Take a look at this classic feat.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">[[R]] Orc Ferocity <span\
  \ class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 1</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Orc</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Frequency</b> once per day</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Trigger</b> You're reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p> \n     <hr style=\"\
  margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Fierceness in battle runs\
  \ through your blood, and you refuse to fall from your injuries. When this feat\
  \ is triggered, you avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point.</p> \n  \
  \  </blockquote> \n    <p>This allows the half-orc to stay in the fight after taking\
  \ a felling blow, even a really big hit or a critically failed save against a dragon's\
  \ breath attack!</p> \n    <p>In addition to allowing you to choose any feat from\
  \ both ancestries, we were also able to design a few ancestry feats specifically\
  \ for half-elves and half-orcs. Take a look at this half-elf feat.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Inspire Imitation <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Feat 5</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Half-Elf</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">You inspire your allies to great feats through your own actions.\
  \ Whenever you critically succeed at a skill check, you automatically qualify to\
  \ take the Aid reaction when attempting to help an ally at the same skill check,\
  \ even without spending an action to prepare to do so.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>This means that when you critically succeed, you can Aid your ally at no\
  \ extra cost to yourself, which is particularly useful if your ally needs some help\
  \ doing something at which you excel.</p> \n    <p>Beyond what this means for half-elves\
  \ and half-orcs, using an ancestry feat to unlock a more diverse heritage gives\
  \ us a lot of options for the future. For instance, aasimars, tieflings, and other\
  \ planar scions come from a wide variety of ancestries in Golarion, instead of just\
  \ defaulting to human. In Pathfinder First Edition, there's a sidebar to that effect,\
  \ but it provides no mechanical adjustments for non-human planar scions beyond their\
  \ size category. The playtest treatment would allow you to build a character whose\
  \ ancestry really reflects their combined heritage. And if your setting has half-elves\
  \ and half-orcs where the other parent isn't human, say half-orc/half-dwarf characters,\
  \ you can just allow the half-orc feat for dwarf characters and the rest of the\
  \ work is already taken care of. This also opens up a lot of design space (in the\
  \ form of feats) to explore what otherworldly parentage might mean, giving you different\
  \ options based on what type of outsider has influenced your heritage, similar to\
  \ the popular subcategories of aasimar and tieflings (pitborn, musetouched, and\
  \ so on). Having a solar in the family might grant access to entirely different\
  \ feats than if your ancestors were blessed by a hound archon.</p> \n    <p>Now,\
  \ this approach is a little different than what we've done in the past, so we are\
  \ going to be asking a few questions about this through surveys during the playtest.\
  \ We're keen to hear what you think about half-elves and half-orcs in the playtest.\
  \ Why not roll one up and give it a try?</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director\
