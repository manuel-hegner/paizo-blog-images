  >Thursday, November 1, 2012</p> \n     <p class=\"tiny\" align=\"center\"><i>This\
  \ blog entry is the ninth in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\">Click here to read the first\
  \ installment</a>.</i></p> \n     <p>Before it was even released in August 2009,\
  \ the <a href=\"products/btpy88yj?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</i></a> was already the single best selling product\
  \ Paizo had ever produced, and October's <a href=\"products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary\"\
  ><i>Bestiary</i></a> immediately captured the number two slot. The stunning sales\
  \ numbers made it very easy to see why many companies fall into the trap of producing\
  \ too many rulebooks for their games—it's very tempting to go back to that well\
  \ for another drink.</p> \n     <p>But Ryan Dancey and I had spotted that trap in\
  \ 1999 when we were at Wizards of the Coast, analyzing the recently acquired TSR\
  \ business. Putting out rulebooks every month or two quickly overwhelms your audience.\
  \ And once customers decide that they can't keep up with new releases, they begin\
  \ making choices about which books they need and which ones they can do without,\
  \ which means you sell fewer copies of even your most popular books. And fewer copies\
  \ means lower print runs, which means higher unit costs, which means lower margins.\
  \ And even worse: when customers start skipping releases, it becomes easier and\
  \ easier for them to stop buying your products altogether. </p> \n     <p>On the\
  \ other hand, if you publish new books too slowly, players who exhaust content quickly\
  \ will begin to feel that their needs aren't supported, and they'll start looking\
  \ for other game systems. And players left waiting too long for their favorite rules\
  \ subsets will also get discouraged. You have to strike a balance.</p> \n     <p>Ryan\
  \ and I decided that the magic number for major hardcover rulebooks per year—the\
  \ number that would keep the most customers satiated but not overwhelmed—was probably\
  \ three. That was part of the plan we were going to implement for D&amp;D Third\
  \ Edition at Wizards, but the two of us didn't last long there after the launch,\
  \ and the management team that replaced us had different ideas. </p> \n     <p><span\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">So when it came time for us to formulate a strategy for\
  \ the Pathfinder RPG line, I went back to our plan from ten years earlier. I pitched\
  \ my team here at Paizo on it and was surprised how quickly everyone came on board.\
  \ Then came the hard part—if you only have three products a year, what should those\
  \ products be?</span></p> \n     <p>First, we came up with a timetable—there would\
  \ be one release in the spring, another at Gen Con in August, and a third at the\
  \ end of the year, close to the holidays. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurb120\">\n\

  \      <br>Advanced Player's Guide approvals!\n     </div> \n     <p>Pathfinder\
  \ Society was growing by leaps and bounds, and the experience that Erik, Jason,\
  \ and I had with the RPGA suggested that we might want to release our most rules-heavy\
  \ books at Gen Con. We also knew we wanted to do one monster/adversary book each\
  \ year for the foreseeable future, and because the Bestiary came out at the end\
  \ of the year, we decided to schedule future ones in the winter slot. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>That left the spring release, which we would keep flexible. We had a lot\
  \ of ideas for books that didn't fall into the other two categories, and this spot\
  \ would be the perfect place to put those. Our first spring release was a pretty\
  \ easy choice. Because we had published all of our core rules in a single book,\
  \ there wasn't a direct equivalent to D&amp;D's DM's Guide, but we still felt a\
  \ need to do a book aimed at Game Masters, giving them advice and tools for becoming\
  \ an expert GM and elevating the experience for their players. To create this book,\
  \ we tapped into the expertise of some of the best designers in the history of gaming,\
  \ and they shared their tips and secrets. The <a href=\"products/btpy8ffn?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-GameMastery-Guide\"\
  ><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a> came out in May 2010, and has been doing very well\
  \ for us ever since.</p> \n     <p>For the first Gen Con after the release of the\
  \ <i>Core Rulebook</i>, we needed to have something sexy that would allow us to\
  \ show some design chops... something that would give Pathfinder RPG players new\
  \ toys to play with. We sat in a conference room for about three hours and talked\
  \ about character types we'd seen in fantasy books and movies, or played in other\
  \ fantasy games. Then we talked about how we could build those characters using\
  \ the Pathfinder rules. We could build many of those roles by tweaking existing\
  \ classes in the Core Rulebook; this was the genesis of our archetype system, my\
  \ favorite thing to come out of the book we ended up calling the <a href=\"products/btpy8fo1?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Players-Guide\"\
  ><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>. Archtypes allowed a myriad of character ideas\
  \ to blossom forth, many of them very niche, without having to flood the landscape\
  \ with a bunch of new classes.</p> \n     <p>But there were some roles that we felt\
  \ we couldn't do justice without creating whole new classes. In the end, six new\
  \ base classes rose to the top for the APG—the Alchemist, the Cavalier, the Inquisitor,\
  \ the Oracle, the Summoner, and the Witch. Not only would these new base classes\
  \ allow us to show off what the Paizo design staff could do, but they also gave\
  \ players something new to dig into. We filled out the APG with a ton of new content,\
  \ expanding nearly every part of the existing game.</p> \n     <p>Our third hardcover\
  \ rulebook of the year was the <a href=\"products/btpy8hif?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-2\"\
  ><i>Bestiary 2</i></a>. In this installment, we wanted to provide Pathfinder RPG\
  \ versions of many of the popular 3.5-era monsters that hadn't made it into either\
  \ the first Bestiary or the Bonus Bestiary that we did for Free RPG Day 2009. We\
  \ also wanted to flesh out outsiders, and provide an array of creatures of every\
  \ alignment. So you saw a number of Aeons, Agathions, Angels, Archons, Azatas, Daemons,\
  \ Demons, Devils, Elementals, Inevitables, Proteans, and Qlippoths in the book.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb120\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20121101-Kingmaker.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20121101-Kingmaker_120.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \      <br>Wes and James playtest some of the kingdom building rules for Kingmaker.\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>For the Adventure Path line in 2010, we went a little bit\
  \ outside of the box. The previous year saw the urban campaign <i>Council of Thieves</i>\
  \ kick off the Pathfinder RPG era, and we wanted its successor to steer clear of\
  \ that territory. So with Kingmaker, we tried something we'd never done before:\
  \ a true sandbox AP. Our APs usually have a very solid and somewhat direct storyline,\
  \ but in <i>Kingmaker</i>, the plot became more of a framing device for the true\
  \ story: that of the characters forming and building their own kingdom. Each adventure\
  \ had a number of mini-adventures that could be played in any order or skipped entirely.\
  \ Players could create kingdoms large or small, passive or aggressive, dictatorial\
  \ or democratic, or anything else they envisioned. We were a little apprehensive\
  \ about the response to this type of AP, but Kingmaker has become one of the most\
  \ successful APs of all time, rivaling even Rise of the Runelords in popularity.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We also added a whole new Pathfinder line in 2010: <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\"\
  >Pathfinder Tales</a>. We had previously made a valiant attempt to get into the\
  \ fiction business with our Planet Stories line of pulp fiction, but the book market\
  \ never quite seemed to embrace the line, and sales were never strong. Erik Mona\
  \ was the passion and vision behind Planet Stories, and it was a line he personally\
  \ loved very much, but I felt that if we were going to put time, money and effort\
  \ into a line, we should do it with books that helped support our other products.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>TSR had built quite a nice business with their Dragonlance and\
  \ Forgotten Realms fiction lines, and Games Workshop had more recently built a successful\
  \ line of novels around their Warhammer line; it seemed that the book trade was\
  \ more receptive to new gaming fiction than it was to bringing back long-lost classics.\
  \ Thus was Pathfinder Tales born. For our first couple of novels, we wanted authors\
  \ who would be familiar names to fans of gaming fiction, and to bookstore buyers\
  \ as well. We chose two Forgotten Realms authors, Dave Gross and Elaine Cunningham,\
  \ to launch the line. Dave's book <a href=\"products/btpy8g3n?Pathfinder-Tales-Prince-of-Wolves\"\
  ><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a> arrived at Gen Con, while Elaine's <a href=\"products/btpy8h6j?Pathfinder-Tales-Winter-Witch\"\
  ><i>Winter Witch</i></a> was a holiday release. They didn't quite blast to the top\
  \ of the bestseller lists, but sales were <i>much</i> stronger than Planet Stories\
  \ had been, so we felt cautiously optimistic going forward.</p> \n     <p>2010 also\
  \ gave me a chance to bring back a variation of the very first product I was ever\
  \ involved with in the game industry! In 1987, my first company, Lion Rampant, came\
  \ out with Whimsey Cards—a product that allowed players to insert their ideas into\
  \ roleplaying games in a structured way. The rights to Whimsey Cards themselves\
  \ are owned by other folks, so I modified the basic idea a bit, adding an optional\
  \ Pathfinder RPG-based mechanic, creating Plot Twist Cards. The response has been\
  \ great; we're currently in our second print run. Sometimes oldies are indeed goodies.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We also revisited another oldie but goodie in our boardgame line. Kill\
  \ Doctor Lucky was—and still is—our best selling boardgame, so we extended that\
  \ line with a deluxe edition of Cheapass Games' Save Doctor Lucky prequel. Where\
  \ KDL is all about trying to get Doctor Lucky alone in a room so nobody can see\
  \ you bump him off, the goal of SDL is to make sure that everyone sees you perform\
  \ the heroic deed of saving an old man from a sinking ship. It features a game board\
  \ that gets smaller as the ship slips under. </p> \n     <p>At the 2010 ENnie Awards,\
  \ Paizo won 11 golds and 1 silver. The awards received were:</p> \n     <ul>\n \

  \ \n     </center> \n     <br> \n     <p>With all of the success Paizo was having\
  \ in 2010, it felt like we were living charmed lives. That all came crashing down\
  \ in October when we lost Dave Erickson. At 63, Dave was our oldest employee. He\
  \ joined the Paizo team in 2002, not even a year after we started, and took over\
  \ the finance department, freeing me to focus my efforts on making the company more\
  \ profitable and keeping it alive. Dave and I worked side by side on Paizo's finances.\
  \ Dave designed reports that allowed Erik, Vic, Jeff and myself to analyze what\
  \ was working well and what wasn't—insights that were invaluable to a small, struggling\
  \ company like Paizo. Dave also wasn't afraid to sit down face to face with government\
  \ auditors, each time sending them away with money due in Paizo's favor. He was\
  \ a loyal and honest man, and someone I trusted implicitly. </p> \n     <p>The call\
  \ came on the Tuesday after the Columbus Day weekend. I was refreshed from the long\
  \ weekend and ready to tackle whatever came. I wasn't prepared for that call, though.\
  \ Through tears, Dave's wife, Olga, let me know that Dave had passed away in his\
  \ sleep during the weekend. I was crushed. Devastated. Dave had just started to\
  \ plan his retirement, intending to spend his golden years with his wife. Now he\
  \ was gone, just like that. Dave's death showed us all how fragile life could actually\
  \ be.</p> \n     <p>A company Paizo's size doesn't have a ton of redundancies, but\
  \ thankfully, I had hired Chris Self in 2008 with the idea that he would take over\
  \ Finance in a few years when Dave retired. I had sent Chris to start accounting\
  \ school just months before Dave passed, and he'd worked with Dave enough to fairly\
  \ seamlessly take over the department a couple years ahead of schedule. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Here's my favorite Dave Erickson story: During Dave's first few months\
  \ at Paizo, I quickly learned that if there was a discrepancy between what <i>I</i>\
  \ thought the numbers should be and what <i>Dave</i> thought they should be, Dave\
  \ was almost always right. Well, on one occasion, I finally figured out that I was\
  \ right for once, and I burst into Dave's office, brandishing a sheaf of paperwork\
  \ with all my figures, shouting \"In your face, Erickson!\" To say that he was surprised\
  \ is an understatement.</p> \n     <p>Another negative for 2010 was the ongoing\
  \ \"edition war.\" The online arguing between fans of D&amp;D 4th Edition and the\
  \ Pathfinder RPG goes all the way back to our announcement of the Pathfinder RPG,\
  \ but it took on new fervor in 2010 as 4E floundered a bit and Pathfinder challenged\
  \ it in the marketplace. I need to make one thing clear—Paizo never wanted anything\
  \ to do with the edition war. We weren't trying to take down D&amp;D ; we were just\
  \ trying to make a game that we enjoyed and that allowed us to tell the stories\
  \ that we wanted to tell. I would be lying if I said we didn't enjoy the passion\
  \ and loyalty of our customers defending their game—it was very flattering... but\
  \ we really hoped that the edition war would just go away so everyone could enjoy\
  \ their favorite game without attacking the other.</p> \n     <p>This will be news\
  \ to most readers: By the end of 2010, the Pathfinder RPG had already overtaken\
  \ D&amp;D as the bestselling RPG. It would take almost half a year before industry\
  \ magazine ICv2 first reported it, and several quarters more before some people\
  \ were willing to accept it as fact, but internally, we already knew it was true.\
  \ We'd heard it from nearly all of our hobby trade distributors; we'd heard it from\
  \ buyers at book chains like Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders; we could see it using\
  \ industry sales trackers such as BookScan; we were even regularly coming out on\
  \ top on Amazon's bestseller charts. Each individual market we sold in had us either\
  \ tied with or outselling D&amp;D, and none of those sources counted our considerable\
  \ direct sales on paizo.com. Put all of those things together, and it was clear:\
  \ Pathfinder had become the first RPG ever to oust D&amp;D from top spot. It wasn't\
  \ our goal, but here we were. And as we started planning for 2011, we knew that\
  \ if we were going to be the industry leader, we were going to have to step up our\
  \ game and act like a leader. 2011 would be our first chance to show what we could\
  \ do with that position....</p> \n     <p><b>Employees who started in 2010 (in order\

  \ Paizo 8 My Head</h2> \n     <p>My relationship with Paizo began in 2007, when\
  \ I subscribed to <i>Dungeon</i> one issue before the announcement that the magazines\
  \ were going away. I basically wrote the timing off as bad luck, and decided to\
  \ try to make the most out of the few issues I'd get before the end. I opted for\
  \ the Pathfinder subscription instead of credit, primarily because I'd planned on\
  \ mining <i>Dungeon</i> for ideas for a homebrew campaign and figured I could mine\
  \ this new Golarion world for ideas too. In August 2007, I got my first issue of\
  \ Pathfinder, glanced through it, and filed it on the shelf because I didn't think\
  \ any of it would be useful for the campaign I was running at the time. I did the\
  \ same for the next few issues. In the fall, I joined a group playing the Savage\
  \ Tide Adventure Path, and my mind was no longer in GM space. But my involvement\
  \ in this Adventure Path made me much more aware of Paizo as a company, and of the\
  \ quality of work the editors on <i>Dungeon</i> (and likely, I assumed, Pathfinder)\
  \ put out. So I started lurking on the messageboards and reading the Pathfinder\
  \ books I'd been getting, but I still wasn't sold. Fourth Edition had been announced,\
  \ and I was playtesting that with some of my friends who'd freelanced for Wizards\
  \ of the Coast in the past. I was hyped for the new edition, and because I was invested\
  \ in my Savage Tide group, I was quickly learning as much about the campaign's Greyhawk\
  \ setting as I could. I didn't have time for another campaign setting when I had\
  \ 30+ years of canon to catch up on in the world in which I was already playing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Then the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game announcement came out, and my gaming\
  \ group was all abuzz about the waves Paizo was making. I got the Alpha and started\
  \ reading all those books I had on my shelf. I was thoroughly hooked. Here was a\
  \ chance for me to be on the ground floor, not just of a new edition of the game\
  \ that I was already familiar with, but also of a campaign setting that was only\
  \ a few months old. I don't know what day it was, but I drank the Pathfinder Kool-Aid\
  \ sometime shortly after the big announcement. I made my <a href=\"/forums/dmtyzpqz?New-Group-Where-to-start#1\"\
  >first paizo.com messageboard post</a> on March 31, 2008, in which I said \"I am\
  \ getting ready to dive into Golarion myself.\" And did I ever follow through!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20121101-Razmiran.jpg\"\

  \      <br>Razmiran Faith Barge Union #107 wins the PaizoCon trivia contest... again!\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Around that time I joined a small group of folks working\
  \ on the daunting task of cataloguing all the information about the Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ campaign setting (as it was called at the time). The PathfinderWiki was founded\
  \ on <a href=\"/forums/dmtyzjp6?Pathfinder-Index#16\">March 8, 2008</a>, and I quickly\
  \ joined up, and am often miscredited as being the wiki's founder even today. My\
  \ involvement in the project became something of a full-time hobby, and the countless\
  \ hours I spent adding and editing content on there gave me a depth and breadth\
  \ of knowledge about Golarion that rivaled even Paizo employees. I attended PaizoCon\
  \ 2009 and helped my team, Razmiran Faith Barge Union #107, win the annual trivia\
  \ contest, in no small part because of the work I'd done on the wiki. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>At Gen Con a few months later, I approached Sean, Wes, and Josh independently\
  \ and asked if I could write for Paizo, as I felt I'd displayed my knowledge of\
  \ the setting and had a whole website of material I'd written about the world to\
  \ show my writing talents. A few weeks later, I was working on a portion of Gnomes\
  \ of Golarion, most of the Kingmaker Player's Guide, and a Pathfinder Society Scenario,\
  \ all of which couldn't have come at a better time for a recently unemployed filmmaker.\
  \ Once the freelancing started, it didn't seem to end as long as I met my deadlines,\
  \ turned in my best work, and kept asking the folks at Paizo for more. A few weeks\
  \ before PaizoCon 2010, I got an unexpected call from Erik (incidentally, while\
  \ I was exploring Delvehaven as a player in a friend's Council of Thieves campaign).\
  \ He asked if I was coming to PaizoCon (duh!) and if I had plans afterward (I didn't).\
  \ I soon did, however, as he offered me a contract to work in the Paizo offices\
  \ for a week following the con helping build the Inner Sea Poster Map Folio. I detailed\
  \ my brief time as a Paizo employee in a <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2010/june/v5748dyo5lb7s\"\
  >guest blog</a> at the time.</p> \n     <p>What that blog doesn't tell you, however,\
  \ is that on the last day of the contract, Lisa, James, and Erik pulled me into\
  \ Lisa's office to talk about how I felt the experience had been, how I liked working\
  \ with the rest of the editorial team, and ultimately what I thought about working\
  \ for Paizo full time. I thought hard about my response for about 3 seconds before\
  \ accepting the offer. It took me another two months to get myself moved from New\
  \ York City to Seattle, but once I started, it wasn't long before I was in charge\
  \ of development of two product lines and making a sizable contribution to the very\
  \ world continuity whose chronicling caught Paizo's eye in the first place. Now,\
  \ two years later, I'm still amazed on a weekly basis that this is my real-life\
  \ job, and that I get to work for such a great company and with such a fun and inspiring\
  \ group of coworkers. It's a lot of work, for sure, but I can't think of anything\
  \ I'd rather be doing instead.</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\

  \ are they doing to my magazines?!\"</h2> \n     <p>Yeah, that was my first thought\
  \ when I saw somebody else's logo plastered on the credits of my two favorite gaming\
  \ magazines. I had just recently gotten back into gaming after a post–high school\
  \ hiatus and life settled into a 9 to 5 routine. Lured in by the release of Third\
  \ Edition and the Oriental Adventures supplement (and new dice, because new game\
  \ = new dice), I immediately said to myself, \"So what kind of adventures are out\
  \ there for this system?\"</p> \n     <p>High on the creative spark that often comes\
  \ with a new game system, and yearning to see what other people had come up with,\
  \ I picked up <i>Dragon</i> 288 and <i>Dungeon</i> 84 from Gambit Games in Bend,\
  \ Oregon—I miss that place!—and was blown away by what was between its slick, glossy\
  \ covers. Clearly, these were not the black-and-white productions of my youth, but\
  \ for all of its sweet, candy-colored coating, did it satisfy?</p> \n     <p>I need\
  \ not have worried. Month after month, I begged the store owner to stock these magazines\
  \ to feed my habit—er, game mastering creativity. Somehow, the minds behind the\
  \ magazine knew exactly what I was looking for in my game, knew that I needed it\
  \ now (hungered for it, even), and I knew that I would gladly fork over the cash\
  \ to keep quality game material coming. Yet I didn't venture on to the place that\
  \ would become like a second home to me until almost four years later, during a\
  \ period of idleness at work (you know you're doing that... <i>right now</i>). I\
  \ found a messageboard community of like-minded gamers who had been playing long\
  \ enough to know what chits were, who remembered when elves were a class, who knew\
  \ the difference between githyanki and githzerai, and who were passionate about\
  \ the game.</p> \n     <p>Did I mention that some of these were the writers, as\
  \ well as the staff—the people who had made the magazine that helped lure me back\
  \ into running a game three nights a week, arming me with a crowbar to pry open\
  \ and shove in awesome gaming material like new alchemical items, chronomancy, and\
  \ ghost elves into my campaign?</p> \n     <p>Through the Paizo messageboards, I\
  \ met the staff, as well as a group of writers who gave me my first writing job\
  \ (hello GM Gems), but there are a few things that could not have happened without\
  \ talking and meeting people through the boards, and these are things that have\
  \ not gone quietly into the night. They've managed to stick around for a bit, and\
  \ I'm happy to say I've had my fingers in them, even if it was just the teeniest\
  \ bit of my pinky finger.</p> \n     <p>First up: PaizoCon. (You may have heard\
  \ of it.) Tim Nightengale bore the brunt of organizing the first unofficial PaizoCon,\
  \ but even then, we referred to each other as Fellow Dictators as we plotted and\
  \ planned ways to give thanks to the hardworking Paizo staff. (The fan award that\
  \ I whipped up still hangs in the office today.) Second: the Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game Core Rulebook! Wes Schneider contacted me and a few other folks (Tim Connors,\
  \ Adam Daigle, and Greg Oppedisano) to do some quick formatting alterations for\
  \ magic items and spells. (My first \"real\" Paizo writing credit came later in\
  \ \"Infestation,\" the side trek adventure in <a href=\"products/btpy86v1?Pathfinder-18-Second-Darkness-Chapter-6-Descent-into-Midnight\"\
  >Pathfinder 18</a>.) Finally, the one that I am the most proud of to this day: the\
  \ creation of the fan-created and fan-run Wayfinder magazine. When Paizo announced\
  \ their <a href=\"paizo/about/communityuse\">Community Use Policy</a>, I knew that\
  \ I had to do something with it. Wayfinder is that thing, and it remains such a\
  \ great way to get your toes wet into the world of roleplaying game publishing—\
  and you get to play in the Golarion sandbox!</p> \n     <p>Skeptic, fan, superfan\
  \ (yup, charter superscriber and all), freelancer, friend, and finally, employee,\
  \ my relationship with Paizo ended up being the culmination of a lot of hobbies\
  \ and interests all rolled up into a golem-shaped package. That step between \"\
  friend\" and \"employee\" had a moment of \"Am I going to fit in here?\" though,\
  \ that same sort of nervousness that you got on the first day of a new school. They\
  \ knew my name, they knew my penchant for offloading my home-baked cookies at their\
  \ offices pre-PaizoCon, but... still.</p> \n     <p>I was a fool for even worrying\
  \ about it. After quietly starting in Customer Service, I got Cosmo's \"you are\
  \ the meat shield\" introduction and was able to skip over all of the tedious \"\
  learn about the company's products\" portion of a customer service job. (I believe\
  \ Cosmo said something to the effect of \"Well, this makes it a lot easier.\") The\
  \ moment that made me ask myself why I didn't do this sooner is when I was delivering\
  \ the mail downstairs and Jason Bulmahn asked \"...Do you work here now?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>The best way that I can describe working at Paizo is this: imagine all\
  \ of your high school friends in one place, with the same overlapping interests,\
  \ whether it's early Minoan art, the latest Studio Ghibli movie, the pros and cons\
  \ of the latest sci-fi movie, or tapping into the depths of cryptozoology among\
  \ the editorial staff. Really, it's not so much of who's a geek or not—because we\
  \ all are here—it's a matter of degree.</p> \n     <p>And I wouldn't have it any\
  \ other way.</p> \n     <p>Liz Courts<br> Webstore Specialist</p> \n     <h2>Weighing\
  \ Dragons</h2> \n     <p>I came to work at Paizo by chance. My previous editorial\
  \ experience was mostly in textbook development, but when the economy—and textbook\
  \ industry—crashed, I moved to Seattle and started retraining in technical editing\
  \ while freelancing to pay the bills. In December 2009, I was visiting my family\
  \ in Wisconsin, fending off unsubtle suggestions to consider engineering as a more\
  \ stable career path, when I got word through the gchat grapevine that Paizo was\
  \ looking for an editor who was familiar with RPGs. Hello, me! Suddenly all of those\
  \ years spent gaming from junior high through college and into grad school were\
  \ a job qualification; I quickly added the dozen or so games I'd played to my resume\
  \ and sent it off.</p> \n     <p>A few days later I had a phone interview with Erik\
  \ and Wes—as it turns out, there are wrong answers to the question \"What was the\
  \ last fantasy book you read?\", but not being a <i>Twilight</i> fan, I cleared\
  \ that hurdle, among others. Then on New Year's Eve, I submitted an editing test.\
  \ Because Seattle is a very small world, I bumped into Sutter at a party later that\
  \ night. He gave me reason for cautious optimism, giving my new year a promising\
  \ start!</p> \n     <p>Ten days later I started at Paizo as a contract editor. Wes,\
  \ Chris, and Sutter handed me the style guide (a mere 40 pages long at the time),\
  \ then threw me into the deep end with a pass on the <i>GameMastery Guide</i> and\
  \ the second half of the Season 1 Pathfinder Society Scenarios. It was already the\
  \ Gen Con crunch, and the pace was hectic—and then after work I'd dash to my technical\
  \ editing classes to dissect software tutorials, nuclear accident reports, and medical\
  \ device instructions (I know WAY more than I want to about femur traction splints).\
  \ Needless to say, I didn't have a lot of free time for reflection. But one day\
  \ while chatting with my classmates about our respective jobs and internships, I\
  \ mentioned that I'd fact-checked the weight of a dragon that day. Jaws dropped.\
  \ Their reactions confirmed my suspicion that this was definitely the most fun editing\
  \ around! I wanted so badly to stay on—I threw myself into my work, offered to take\
  \ on more when I could, and even moderated my hard-line stance on commas to better\
  \ match Paizo's style.</p> \n     <p> A couple months later when my contract ended,\
  \ I was offered a full-time position, and was so elated! It's been over 2 years\
  \ now, with some stressful times along the way, but despite the fact that my wonderful\
  \ coworkers seem to think it's a personal challenge to slip details into adventures\
  \ that make me go fetal with horror, I love my job more than ever.</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ you know what? My dad, who'd subscribed to <i>Dragon</i> since I was a toddler,\
  \ is <i>finally</i> off my back about engineering!</p> \n     <p>Judy Bauer<br>\
