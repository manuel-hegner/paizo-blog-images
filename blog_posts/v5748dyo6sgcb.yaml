  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Well folks, we did it. We\
  \ made it to the final <a href=\"/products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</em></a> preview. Were there delays and complications\
  \ along the way? Sure. But no kingdom rises from nothing without pain and struggle.\
  \ And I couldn't have done it without you, fair citizens. Your taxes will go to\
  \ the establishment of nothing but the finest of statues in my hon—...wait, it wasn't\
  \ me that got king-made? That means I have to do my job and show off these last\
  \ few minis, doesn't it?</p> \n     <p>We're left now with six unrevealed figures\
  \ that exemplify some of the weirder fantasy elements in the Kingmaker campaign,\
  \ so I won't bore you with further theatrics. Just imagine what would happen if\
  \ a bunch of drunk proto-deities made a first draft of the world, threw in some\
  \ magic and glitter, and then sort of left their creations to evolve in isolation\
  \ for a few millennia. That's how you end up with things like the strange (but incredibly\
  \ cute) fey dragon, a Small common figure. How does something so silly looking even\
  \ fit into an ecosystem without going extinct? By having magic powers, that's how!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-FeyDragon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-FeyDragon_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>It's not the only creature in the set tainted by magic\
  \ and a pastel filter. Check out this dwoemercat, a creation of none other than\
  \ Ed Greenwood, for the very first volume of Kingmaker. What better size and rarity\
  \ could one ask for in a dwoemercat than Medium and common, respectively? No better\
  \ size and rarity, I say!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Are you liking the fuzzies? Here's another new fuzzy, albeit\
  \ a waterlogged one. The fur on an ahuizotl clumps to form weird little spikes,\
  \ hence its name, which translates to \"spiny aquatic thing\" according to Wikipedia.\
  \ Originating in Aztec myth, these Large rare cuties like human flesh, “especially\
  \ nails, eyes, and teeth.” YUM!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>But wait! It gets cuter! Who's a good boy? Trollhound's\
  \ a good boy! Yes he is! Look at that well maintained coat of luxuriant mussed hair\
  \ and thick hide of trollish green. He's even trained: \"Roll over! Sit! Don't eat\
  \ me!\" Well, two out of three isn't bad. <span class=\"unlink\"><i>Cue Sarah McLachlan\
  \ music.</i></span> Give this poor creature a home, because every Medium uncommon\
  \ figure deserves a chance to murder PCs.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Ok, I admit I may have gone overboard with the whole\
  \ \"things get weird\" blog theme, but I'm committed now, so there's no stopping\
  \ me. Spider-man himself couldn't put an end to my antics! Not even Pathfinder's\
  \ own version of Spider-man, the web lurker. Less an awkward nerd bitten by a radioactive\
  \ spider and thrust into a life of crime fighting, secret identities, and heartbreak\
  \ than a literal man-spider, the web lurker is a Medium common figure who can't\
  \ wait to be your friendly neighborhood aberrant horror.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Finally, we have the weirdest addition to the set yet,\
  \ as saving the best for last seemed appropriate: a danged-old <i>gnome</i>! Here,\
  \ good reader, we have a fine specimen of pedantic, pompous, and generally insufferable\
  \ gnome alchemist, the inimitable Jubilost Narthropple. In his myriad published\
  \ works, he makes an irrefutable case for being the best companion in not only <em>Pathfinder:\
  \ Kingmaker</em>, but in the entirety of Golarion and the history of CRPGs as well.\
  \ It is only fitting, then, that he offset his Small size with an uncommon rarity,\
  \ so that no adventuring party suffers the indignity of not having him along to\
  \ tell them everything they're doing wrong.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
