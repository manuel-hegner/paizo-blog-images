  \ Guide to Housekeeping: Dust Bunny</h2>\n      <h3>Felix Dritz</h3>\n      <p>In\
  \ pursuit of your studies, it’s often easy to ignore daily chores and cleanliness.\
  \ While those more adept at magic often choose to leave their day-to-day cleaning\
  \ to a <em>phantasmal minion</em>, it’s crucial to take time in your day to verify\
  \ your summon’s work. Too often a vague order will lead to them brushing things\
  \ under cupboards, moving all stray objects into unorganized bins, or placing books\
  \ on shelves at random. While the disorganization of your possessions is certainly\
  \ lamentable, it can become frightful if dust is left to collect in neglected corners\
  \ and under furniture! When this dust collects near magical sources, the debris\
  \ can gain sentience, becoming a dust bunny.</p>\n      <p>You may find these little\
  \ creatures charming, but beware. While the creation of dust bunnies can take little\
  \ thought, their care and maintenance are something that many young wizards lack\
  \ knowledge of. Those unprepared to take care of a dust bunny had best sweep it\
  \ into a containment bin, lest their accidental creation consume their study and\
  \ home.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/080cfa22-cf50-403f-9b29-ce176d265e2a/DustBunny_Art.jpg\"\

  \   <h3>Dust Bunny Familiar</h3>\n      <p>If you, despite the warning, desire a\
  \ dust bunny companion, or perhaps you have one by accident and are willing to care\
  \ for it, this section is for you. Dust bunnies greatly enjoy company and will often\
  \ desire to lie on your lap or desk. Wherever they keep you company, ensure the\
  \ area is regularly cleaned of any new or shed debris; otherwise, another dust bunny\
  \ may form.</p>\n      <p>To feed your dust bunny, simply keep the collections from\
  \ your daily housekeeping. However, if you notice they begin growing to an unreasonable\
  \ size, be sure to limit their portions, as they have been known to grow to the\
  \ size of large dogs.</p>\n      <p>It's important to remember that having formed\
  \ of their own accord, dust bunnies are highly independent. While this makes them\
  \ great companions and assistants, this also makes dust bunnies prone to making\
  \ mischief, often spreading dirt out of spite or simply by wasting away. One should\
  \ be vigilant for such things, for more dust and debris creates the perfect environment\
  \ for new dust bunnies to form, and one can quickly be overrun with an infestation\
  \ of dust bunnies!</p>\n      <p><strong>Dust Bunny<br>\n         Construct<br>\n\
  \         Required Number of Abilities</strong> 4</p>\n      <p><strong>Granted\

  \ Tian Xia Character Guide</em> 124), skilled (arcana)<br><strong>Kick Up Dust</strong>\
  \ [two-actions] (manipulate) <strong>Frequency </strong>once per hour; <strong>Effect\
  \ </strong>Your dust bunny shakes and kicks to stir up dust in a 5-foot emanation.\
  \ Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude save against the higher of\
  \ your class DC or spell DC. A creature that fails its save begins sneezing uncontrollably\
  \ and is slowed 1 and cannot take reactions for 1 round; on a critical failure they\
  \ are slowed 2.</p>\n      <h3>Dust Bunny Swarm</h3>\n      <p>Dust bunnies in particular\
  \ are prone to swarming. This can occur when a large number are left alone for a\
  \ long period of time and are then disturbed by adventurers or a returning wizard.\
  \ Other times, a singular dust bunny familiar grows in such numbers (and they will\
  \ rapidly reproduce!) that a wizard cannot hope to keep them all placated with food\
  \ and attention. In this situation, they will unionize in rebellion against their\
  \ master.</p>\n      <p>It is paramount that you do not allow a dust bunny to multiply,\
  \ for once a swarm has formed, they are nigh impossible to get rid of. While relatively\
  \ easy to disperse and unlikely to kill anyone, they will re-form within the week\
  \ unless the area is immaculately cleaned.</p>\n      <p><strong>Dust Bunny Swarm\

  \ (Archetype)</h2>\n      <h3>Shay Snow</h3>\n      <p>Venture-Gossip is not only\
  \ the name of a beloved agent of the Pathfinder Society who has dedicated herself\
  \ to bringing <em>all</em> of the lurid, gruesome stories to Absalom’s streets—\
  it’s also the name of a popular tabloid newsletter that appears across Golarion,\
  \ primarily wherever there’s a Pathfinder Society lodge. There isn’t just one venture-gossip:\
  \ there are hundreds. Hundreds of Pathfinders with loads of stories and rumors that\
  \ they collect and then forward along to the Ink Worker’s United Printing Press,\
  \ a unionized printing press based out of Absalom. Formally, only one name is associated\
  \ with Venture-Gossip: Agent Kitsch of the Office of Supplies and Procurement. However,\
  \ no one truly believes that she’s behind any of this, as the older ysoki is known\
  \ to misplace just about everything, from poison flasks to important cursed artifacts.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong><strong>4th</strong> Distracting Flattery\

  \ Dedication — Feat 4<br></strong> <strong>Archetype, Dedication, Pathfinder Agent<br></strong>\
  \ <strong>Prerequisites</strong> member of the Pathfinder Society, Pathfinder Agent\
  \ Dedication</p>\n      <p>Look, the motto of the Pathfinder Society is “explore,\
  \ report, cooperate” and you’re just reporting what you hear! Is all of it accurate\
  \ or true? Maybe not, but hey, you can tell a great story and you know how to keep\
  \ your readers hooked and eating out of the palm of your hand. Ambrus Valsin of\
  \ the Grand Lodge may disapprove of your methods, but hey, he’s not your real boss.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Eando isn’t either.</p>\n      <p>We’ll go with Zarta.</p>\n      <p>Wait,\
  \ no, Sheila. Sheila appreciates a good gossip column. You’re now from Magnimar.\
  \ Always have been.</p>\n      <p>You have two identities: your day job as a Pathfinder\
  \ agent, and your real job, one of the many voices that make up the Venture-Gossip\
  \ tabloid. If someone attempts to figure out if you’re a venture-gossip, they must\
  \ use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against one of your influence\
  \ skills of your choice: Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation. Your DC is 20 +\
  \ your proficiency modifier.</p>\n      <p>If you are discovered to be part of Venture-Gossip,\
  \ you can spend 1 week of downtime convincing others that you’ve never even <em>read</em>\
  \ that tabloid, much less contributed to it!</p>\n      <p>You gain the following\
  \ action, allowing you to collect more information for your column.</p>\n      <p><strong>Tell\
  \ Me More</strong> [two-actions] (fortune) <strong>Target</strong> one creature\
  \ that shares a language you speak; <strong>Requirements</strong> You’re not in\
  \ combat; <strong>Effect</strong> Just batting your eyes and giving someone a familiar\
  \ nudge can get them talking, ready to spill the beans about everything and everyone\
  \ around them. You roll twice on all rolls to influence the target and use the better\
  \ result.</p>\n      <p><strong>Special </strong>You can select the dedication feat\
  \ for this archetype even if you haven’t yet gained three feats from the Pathfinder\
  \ Agent archetype.</p>\n      <p><strong>Verbose Distraction [reaction] — Feat 6<br></strong>\
  \ <strong>Archetype, Auditory<br></strong> <strong>Prerequisites</strong> Venture-Gossip\
  \ Archetype<br><strong>Trigger </strong>You are the target of a physical melee attack.<br>\n\
  \       You talk so much it can be distracting to your enemies and you’re often\
  \ quick to remind your enemies that you’re just a little guy! You don’t need to\
  \ be targeted! You don’t need to be the focus of their frustrations! Have they tried\
  \ writing to their mom or talking to a local priest of Desna? Ow!<br>\n        You\
  \ gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against the triggering attack.</p>\n \
  \     <p><strong>Hey! Over Here! [reaction] — Feat 6<br></strong><strong>Archetype,\
  \ Auditory<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Venture-Gossip Archetype<br><strong>Trigger\
  \ </strong>An ally within 30 feet rolls a saving throw against an auditory effect.<br>\n\
  \       Hey! Don’t listen to that! That’s bad sounds! Listen to me! Would you like\
  \ to hear about how the high priest of the Abadaran church in Absalom’s Petals District\
  \ is having an affair with an Urgathoan cleric? Yeah, I’m thinking about calling\
  \ the article “Boney Money!”<br>\n       Your targeted ally treats the result of\
  \ their saving throw as one degree of success better. Once an ally has been targeted\
  \ by this effect, they’re immune for 24 hours.</p>\n      <p><strong>A Little Bird\
  \ Told Me... [two-actions] — Feat 8<br></strong><strong>Archetype, Concentrate,\
  \ Manipulate, Polymorph<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Venture-Gossip\
  \ Archetype<br>\n       You transform into a small bird, such as a finch or a sparrow,\
  \ allowing you to eavesdrop on others and gain information you wouldn’t otherwise\
  \ be able to acquire. You become Tiny, gain the animal trait, and you can’t make\
  \ Strikes. You can Dismiss the effect to return to your normal shape, and you resume\
  \ your normal shape automatically if you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points.<br>\n     \
  \  You gain the following statistics and abilities:<br>\n       AC = 20 + your level.\
  \ Ignore your armor’s check penalty and Speed reduction.<br>\n       Fly speed 25\
  \ feet.<br>\n       Weakness 5 to physical damage.<br>\n       Low-light vision\
  \ and imprecise scent 30 feet.<br>\n       Acrobatics and Stealth modifiers of +10,\
  \ unless your own is higher; Athletics modifier –4.</p>\n      <p><strong>Define\
  \ “Report” [free-action] — Feat 10<br></strong><strong>Archetype, Fortune<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong>\
  \ Venture-Gossip Archetype; master in Diplomacy<br>\n       Look, getting caught\
  \ in a lie is a normal part of venture-gossip life. Sometimes you have to give a\
  \ sheepish smile and apologize for what you’ve done. When you fail a Deception check,\
  \ reroll with your Diplomacy modifier. On a success, there are no hard feelings\
  \ and the other person’s attitude condition doesn’t worsen. On a critical success,\
  \ you can attempt the Deception again with no consequences.</p>\n      <p><strong>Catch\
  \ and Kill [reaction] — Feat 12<br></strong><strong>Archetype<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong>\
  \ Venture-Gossip Archetype<br><strong>Trigger </strong>A creature within your reach\
  \ uses a move action, or leaves a square during a move action it’s using.<br>\n\
  \       When you’ve decided to quash a story, no one can escape from you with any\
  \ incriminating information. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature.\
  \ On a hit, the triggering creature is Grabbed, and on a critical hit, they’re slowed\
  \ 1. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple\
  \ attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.</p>\n      <p><strong>Muckraking\
  \ [three-actions]&nbsp;<strong>—</strong> Feat 16<br></strong><strong>Archetype,\
  \ Auditory, Concentrate, Emotion, Mental<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong>\
  \ Venture-Gossip Archetype<br>\n       It seems like your knowledge has come in\
  \ handy after all and you have your enemy at your feet. Pulling out your fan mail,\
  \ you read your fans’ scathing remarks about your enemy to their face, letting them\
  \ feel just how much everyone hates them and everything that they’ve done. They\
  \ hate the way that they walk, they hate the way that they talk.<br>\n       Your\
  \ enemy takes 10d10 mental damage, with a basic Will save. On a critical failure,\
  \ they’re off-guard until the beginning of your next turn and lose all reactions,\
