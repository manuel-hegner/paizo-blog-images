  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">With the\
  \ Gen Con launch behind us, it's time to start jumping into our monthly scenario\
  \ previews. I'm exceptionally excited to talk about <a href=\"/products/btpy9wes?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-04-Cries-From-the-Drift\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-04: Cries from the Drift</em></a>. This is a scenario\
  \ I think a lot of people (especially Exo-Guardians) will be talking about, as it\
  \ includes several plot points we've only hinted at in our initial scenarios.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Cries from the Drift tasks the PCs with investigating a distress beacon\
  \ recently sold to the Starfinder Society by a salvaging bargeâ€”a starship the PCs\
  \ possibly encountered in one of our launch scenarios. The beacon, and the ship\
  \ it belongs to, has special importance to the Exo-Guardians faction. Specifically,\
  \ it has ties to the lost Exo-Guardian base of operations.</p> \n    <p>Here's a\
  \ quick look at the tags that accompany this scenario:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Faction\
  \ (Exo-Guardians)</li> \n     <li>Starship</li>\n    </ul> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0104E-Driftdead_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>When planning our season scope, I knew that this scenario needed\
  \ to include the above tags. When it came time to outlining the scenario, the more\
  \ I fit the pieces together, the more I knew that the scenario would heavily involve\
  \ a theme I have a particular love for: horror. Paizo's newest developer, Joe Pasini,\
  \ did a fantastic job of putting together a terrifying starship for the PCs to explore.\
  \ Along with that, he also adhered to my vehement request that we include Zigvigix\
  \ and maintain the shirren faction leader's eternal optimism in the face of... well...\
  \ awful and terrible things. And while Zigvigix does put on a good face during this\
  \ scenario, I want to let people know that the storylines we are exploring include\
  \ some pretty grim and dark (grimdark even) revelations for some our NPCs and factions.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Oh, before I go. I realized there's an unofficial tag I forgot to associate\
  \ with this scenario. Since it's unofficial, I'm going to put it behind a spoiler\
  \ tag.</p> \n    <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\" onclick=\"\
  toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n    <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Advances\
  \ the ongoing 'Strawberry Machine Cake' metaplot</li>\n     </ul> \n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>I look forward to seeing everyone's reactions to Cries from the Drift, as\
  \ well as any overall thoughts on our ongoing stories for the factions and Society.\
  \ Come back next month, when we preview our next scenario <a href=\"/products/btpy9wet?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-05-The-First-Mandate\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-05: The First Mandate</em></a>, which combines faction\
  \ missions for the Acquisitives and Second Seeker (Luwazi Elsebo), as well as being\
  \ the first of our \"Scoured Stars\" major storyline adventures!</p> \n    <p>Thurston\
