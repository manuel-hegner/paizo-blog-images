  /image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6026_180.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Lots of\
  \ cool things happen in these adventures—get the pieces, do the thing.</p> \n  \
  \   <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> is a nonstop thrill\
  \ ride. The party goes to the Abyss and back multiple times. They fight demon lords,\
  \ they meet gods, they defeat armies—how could such an Adventure Path end? By permanently\
  \ changing the face of the world, of course!</p> \n     <p>Things are bad in the\
  \ Worldwound. Deskari is tired of waiting and nervous about heroes interfering with\
  \ his business. He's going for broke and trying to tear the Worldwound wide open.\
  \ The heroes have to stop him by traveling to the heart of the tear and performing\
  \ a dangerous ritual right on his doorstep. And if they have a moment afterward,\
  \ maybe they'll go talk to him about what's he's done.</p> \n     <p>There are so\
  \ many good parts to the <a href=\"/products/btpy9dyi\"><em>City of Locusts Adventure\
  \ Deck</em></a>. The characters are on a classic quest: They must find some mysterious\
  \ artifacts and bring them to the worst place possible, defeat the most horrible\
  \ villains ever encountered, then put their lives on the line to close a portal\
  \ to the Abyss. This <i>defines</i> mythic.</p> \n     <p>And while I love all of\
  \ the scenarios in this path, what I really want to talk about is a single moment.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ versions of Wrath are an interesting combination. They each take the players on\
  \ the same journey and tell the same story, but they do it in very different ways.\
  \ One of the most challenging (and also most fun) things I get to do as a designer\
  \ for this game is taking events and situations from the RPG and trying to make\
  \ them work in a card game.</p> \n     <div style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">\n   \
  \   <b>Wrath of the Righteous Spoilers</b>: \n      <input type=\"button\" value=\"\
  Show\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n      <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n \
  \      <p>In the Adventure Path, there's a particular moment that is very striking\
  \ to me. The players have just rescued a weird little demon called the Suture from\
  \ the Soul Foundry. Given that the creature can help close the Worldwound, the Storm\
  \ King instantly knows when he's been found. Khorramzadeh appears without warning\
  \ and attacks the players to try to stop them from taking this key to the Worldwound.\
  \ The players must defeat the mythic demon who destroyed Kenabres, starting them\
  \ on this path. It's a time to realize how far they have come. They've changed from\
  \ the people who ran for their lives into the underground while the Storm King slew\
  \ a silver dragon above them to the mythic heroes who can now defeat that very same\
  \ demon.</p> \n      </div>\n     </div> \n     <p>This story arc exists in the\
  \ card game as well. As you'll recall from my blog about Adventure Deck 1, Khorramzadeh\
  \ appears in the very first scenario in that deck, but not as a bane to be fought—\
  he would be much too tough for that. He's there to trigger calamity for the players.\
  \ And now, in Adventure Deck 6, the players finally get the chance to face him and\
  \ make him pay. All we had to do was properly simulate the conditions of the fight.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Searching for the Suture</h2> \n     <p>Death of the Storm King has\
  \ one very interesting feature: The Suture is a cohort that gets shuffled into a\
  \ random deck as if he were a henchman. The players must find him in order to win\
  \ the scenario because it's the only way to get the villain into the game.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-DeathOfTheStormKing.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>HERE'S JOHNNY!</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>At some point, just\
  \ like in the roleplaying game, the players will find the Suture and succeed at\
  \ capturing him. And then, just like in the roleplaying game, the Storm King will\
  \ appear, and the players will have their showdown with a power they had once believed\
  \ to be undefeatable. The moment is preserved.</p> \n     <h2>The End?</h2> \n \
  \    <p>Much like in Adventure Deck 5, there's an optional fight in this deck. Actually,\
  \ it's an entire optional scenario. This is a \"reward\" for completing City of\
  \ Locusts, and it represents the players deciding to journey into the lair of Deskari\
  \ in the Abyss to end his reign once and for all.</p> \n     <p>The scenario is\
  \ simple. There's only one location: The Rasping Rifts. It's composed of six random\
  \ high-level henchmen for each player, and the villain Deskari is on the bottom.\
  \ The players just have to keep beating the toughest banes in the game turn after\
  \ turn until they finally get to the big man. Then there's just the simple matter\
  \ of making three consecutive combat 66 checks. Oh, and he has this text: \"If undefeated,\
  \ you die.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-JustifiableDecide.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>You could have said, \"No.\"</i>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Apocalyptic\
  \ Challenges</h2> \n     <p>Adventure Deck 6 is the pinnacle of difficulty in the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card game, and the banes are here to prove it. The Elder\
  \ Fire Demon tops the heap with an impressive 33 combat check. (Some knowledge can\
  \ help you with that, though.) If he beats you, he drains your mythic charges, and\
  \ even if you win, all the characters at your location might have to discard their\
  \ hands.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-ElderFireDemon.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>He just keeps asking, \"Aren't you glad you took all of those\
  \ hand size power feats?\"</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>A favorite of mine is the\
  \ Insane Bythos. This thing is chaos incarnate. Before the players even get to act,\
  \ it shuffles up all of their role cards. Alain might find himself with the ability\
  \ to wrangle Padrig, but nothing to help with Donahan. And that change lasts until\
  \ the monster is defeated or until the end of the scenario.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>\"Where am I going to get a bow at this time of night?\"</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>The barriers are highly educational. For example, you can\
  \ learn that \"flensing\" means \"to remove the outer layer of skin and blubber.\"\
  \ You can also learn that Death by Pleasure is a thing that can happen in this world.\
  \ But my favorite barrier is Unstable Accelerant. It's not so much a barrier as\
  \ a warping of the rules at a location. It looks like it will throw everything into\
  \ chaos, and to an extent, it does. However, its real effect will be to make smart\
  \ players very careful about what they play and when for fear of drawing too many\
  \ cards out of other players' hands.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  \ Side of the End!</h2> \n     <p>This deck introduces some of the most iconic boons\
  \ in all of Pathfinder. Among the weapons, you'll find a Vorpal Blade that can succeed\
  \ at any combat check if you can just roll a 20. You'll also see the Staff of the\
  \ Hierophant, which lets you get your divine spells back almost immediately.</p>\

  \ don't really hold a candle to the spells, though. This set contains Miracle, which\
  \ lets you get and play any other spell in the box. It has Meteor Swarm, which adds\
  \ four dice and an automatic reroll. And, of course, it has Time Stop, which lets\
  \ you get any and all cards in your deck and then play them without caring about\
  \ the \"one of each type\" rule.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
