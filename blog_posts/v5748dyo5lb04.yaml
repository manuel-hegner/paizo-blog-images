  \   <blockquote> \n    <h1>It's Huge!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, May\
  \ 26, 2010</p> \n    <p>The way the story goes, Erik walked into the copy shop with\
  \ a disc holding the map of the Inner Sea Region and asked the employee there to\
  \ make the image as big as he could.</p> \n    <p>\"Okay, here we go,\" the man\
  \ said, holding up a sheet maybe two feet high.</p> \n    <p>\"I don't think you\
  \ understand,\" Erik replied. \"I need this <i>big</i>.\"</p> \n    <p>Thus it was\
  \ that last Friday, Erik and Wes came into the office holding a map of the Inner\
  \ Sea Region that, when unrolled, measured seven feet tall and six feet across.\
  \ As we all stood around it in shock, looking down on it in mingled wonder and terror,\
  \ I think the same two thoughts were in everyone's brains. Here was the world we'd\
  \ created...</p> \n    <p>...and now we needed to fill it.</p> \n    <p>For of course\
  \ that's why we had the map printed. With the forthcoming <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8dd7\"\
  ><i>World Guide: The Inner Sea</i></a> (a revised and expanded version of the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy84eo\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign\
  \ Setting</i> hardcover</a>, fully updated to the Pathfinder RPG) and the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8dd9\"><i>Inner Sea Poster Map Folio</i></a>, it's\
  \ time for us to finally buckle down and crank our own obsessive tendencies to the\
  \ max as we attempt to place <i>every location that's featured in a Pathfinder game\
  \ product</i> in its appropriate place. And of course, as if that madness weren't\
  \ enough, the forthcoming world guide also presents a ton of new adventure locations\
  \ and notable sites for regions that previously only had a few dots on a map. While\
  \ there are still countless places left open for GMs to populate and describe as\
  \ they see fit, this is our attempt to create something truly comprehensive to satisfy\
  \ even the most detail-oriented GMs.</p> \n    <p>This, of course, is madness. I'm\
  \ sure that within a month, we'll all be gibbering on the floor as the ink staining\
  \ our fingertips reaches toxic levels. But until then, the Map will be on the wall,\
  \ watching us, daring us to try to fill it in. How much of our hubristic attempt\
  \ to catch <i>everything</i> makes it into the final map folio is anyone's guess—\
  it may be that printing every tag would result in type too small to see with the\
  \ naked eye—but you'll know when you see it that the Paizo editorial team gave their\
  \ all to make it as accurate as they could, boldly chucking interns and coworkers\
  \ into the line of fire. That's how much we care!</p> \n    <p>James L. Sutter <br>Fiction\
