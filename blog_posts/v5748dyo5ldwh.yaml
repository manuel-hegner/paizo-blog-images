  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, September 14, 2012</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">We've just finished laying out the packaging\
  \ for the upcoming Shattered Star set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic fantasy gaming miniatures, which means\
  \ we'll very shortly have the product up for pre-order! These figures support the\
  \ new <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered Star Adventure\
  \ Path</a>, but are of course usable in any fantasy campaign.</span></p> \n    <p>At\
  \ this point, all of the sculpts have been approved, and the only figure still in\
  \ painting is the enormous Gargantuan \"case incentive\" miniature, whose big reveal\
  \ is still probably a few weeks away.</p> \n    <p>While we wait for these important\
  \ milestones, let's take a look at more figures from the set. Come along, won't\
  \ you?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120914-MediumFire.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120914-MediumFire_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Medium Fire Elemental in all his\
  \ burning glory! Emerging from a pillar of flame, this guy stands about a foot taller\
  \ than your average adventurer, which I think qualifies as \"fiery death from above.\"\
  \ He's sculpted in clear plastic, and should look extra-flamey when light shines\
  \ through his clear bits.</p> \n    <p>Why call this guy a \"medium\" fire elemental,\
  \ you might ask? Well, because there is another fire elemental at a different size\
  \ coming in a future preview.</p> \n    <p>Just kidding. Here he is. This beast\
  \ is the Large Fire Elemental.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120914-LargeFire.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120914-LargeFire_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This guy is WAAAAAAY bigger than a normal\
  \ adventurer. Heck, he's bigger than the biggest ogre we've produced to date. He\
  \ is SO BIG that it almost seems like he should fit on a Huge base. But no, he is\
  \ in fact Large. We just love putting as much value into a miniature as possible,\
  \ and the Large Fire Elemental is a good example of that principle in action. It's\
  \ also a suggestion that if we ever do a truly Huge fire elemental in the future,\
  \ it's going to be absolutely astoundingly enormous. Again, the Large Fire Elemental\
  \ is sculpted in clear plastic for extra fiery effect.</p> \n    <p>And because\
  \ we're about to reveal packaging that has this next guy on it anyway, I've decided\
  \ to include a <i>bonus</i> figure in this week's preview. The Guiltspur Naga!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120914-Guiltspur.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120914-Guiltspur_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This creature is one of many of its kind that traveled\
  \ up through the Darklands and into the ancient Thassilonian ruin of Guiltspur,\
  \ site of the Shattered Star's fifth adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy8tdh\"><i>\"\
  Into the Nightmare Rift\"</i></a>. This creature is Large and in charge. And in\
  \ the office next to mine, our Creative Director James Jacobs is working on this\
  \ creature's encounter RIGHT NOW!</p> \n    <p>Because production on the set is\
  \ still in swing, we have not yet assigned solid rarities to any of the figures\
  \ in the set, including these. Keep your eyes on this space in the next couple of\
  \ weeks for specific details on the set's configuration, price, and release date.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>There's a lot more where these came from!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
