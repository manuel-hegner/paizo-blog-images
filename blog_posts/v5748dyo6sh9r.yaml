  \ itemprop=\"description\">We at Paizo strive to represent our company’s values\
  \ of inclusivity through the content of our Pathfinder and Starfinder publications.\
  \ Showcasing diversity in the stories of the cultures, races, sexualities, and gender\
  \ identities of our characters is something we’ve tried to emphasize since the company’\
  s inception 18 years ago. As we wrote in our public statement earlier this month\
  \ about the Black Lives Matter movement, it’s an ongoing and vital process.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The murder of George Floyd by police and the resulting political actions,\
  \ increased visibility around issues of police brutality, and ongoing conversation\
  \ about the role of policing in our society casts a difficult light upon Agents\
  \ of Edgewatch, our upcoming Pathfinder Adventure Path in which players take on\
  \ the roles of members of the city watch in a vast fantasy metropolis. As Paizo’\
  s publisher, I want to take this opportunity to address the situation directly.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When we began work early last year on Agents of Edgewatch, we conceived\
  \ of the adventures as a pseudo-Victorian crime drama in which a party of Sherlock\
  \ Holmeses would bring a cult of sinister murderers to justice against the backdrop\
  \ of a World’s Fair-style celebration in Absalom, the huge city at the center of\
  \ the Pathfinder world. Along the way, we’d dabble in some buddy cop movie tropes\
  \ and use the players’ role as new and idealistic town guards as a framing device\
  \ for a tour of the city as they attempt to thwart the evil cult’s machinations.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In our heads, this was a classic detective story, not a chance for players\
  \ to act out power fantasies of being militarized police officers oppressing citizens.\
  \ As publisher, I was confident that we could steer well clear of egregious parallels\
  \ to modern police violence and handle the material responsibly.</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ there’s more to it than that. What I hadn't realized—no doubt a result of my own\
  \ privilege—is that the very concept of police, the idea of in fact taking on the\
  \ role of police, makes some members of the Paizo community deeply uncomfortable,\
  \ no matter how deftly we might try to pull off the execution.</p> \n     <p>While\
  \ I remain proud of the work we as a team have put into the Agents of Edgewatch\
  \ campaign, and I believe that our writers, developers, and editors have ensured\
  \ that the subject matter has been handled responsibly, I also believe that if we\
  \ were making the decision about Adventure Path themes today, we would have chosen\
  \ to go forward with a different idea, or a different take on a similar detective-story\
  \ theme. For many of us here at Paizo, our understanding has evolved, not just of\
  \ the horrible impact of police violence, but how some members of our community—\
  especially those who are also members of the Black community—have not had the luxury\
  \ of ignoring it.</p> \n     <p>To that end, I should acknowledge that some members\
  \ of our staff did raise concerns about the campaign’s theme early on. In retrospect,\
  \ I did not give these concerns the full audience that they deserved, and I regret\
  \ this oversight. That’s part of the learning process, too.</p> \n     <p>I remain\
  \ confident in our ability to create a campaign that lives up to our editorial and\
  \ moral standards—even while acknowledging that we should have chosen a different\
  \ approach for this Adventure Path. The events of the Agents of Edgewatch campaign\
  \ assume empathic, heroic player characters who are there to serve their community.\
  \ Groups who wish to play the campaign without taking on the role of city guards\
  \ will be able to remove the law-enforcement element from the story without much\
  \ work, instead telling the heroic tale of a band of local adventurers who take\
  \ it upon themselves to rid the city of murderers and evil cultists. The free <em>Agents\
  \ of Edgewatch Player’s Guide</em> (scheduled to release next week) will offer several\
  \ suggestions on how to do this, as well as tips on how to utilize and adapt Pathfinder’\
  s non-combat conflict-resolution mechanics as well as non-lethal combat rules when\
  \ running the campaign.</p> \n     <p>I’d like to acknowledge the efforts of our\
  \ editing team, who have been exemplary in helping us to eliminate unintentionally\
  \ problematic elements, consult with sensitivity readers, and ensure that products\
  \ come with detailed content warnings. The developers have likewise been striving\
  \ to be more sensitive to these concerns. I hope that Agents of Edgewatch as a whole\
  \ will display our ability to listen and present the subject matter respectfully.\
  \ We will continue to strive to improve our sensitivity and ensure our adventure\
  \ and plot elements remain firmly in the realm of fantasy.</p> \n     <p>While we\
  \ cannot afford to cancel or delay the Adventure Path, we want to show our commitment\
  \ to remedying our earlier choices through action. As we stated in a previous blog,\
  \ we’ve contributed the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> to Humble Bundle’s <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/fight-for-racial-justice-bundle\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Fight for Racial Justice</a> charity fundraising campaign, which has already\
  \ raised more than $3,700,000 for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Race Forward, and\
  \ the Bail Project. Furthermore, Paizo will donate a portion of proceeds from all\
  \ volumes of the Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path sold through the end of 2021\
  \ to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Lastly, next month, we’ll announce another major\
  \ fundraising effort focused squarely on Paizo’s products, with charity proceeds\
  \ to benefit Black-oriented charities. We hope you will join us in these efforts.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We remain committed to the ideals of inclusivity and racial justice.\
  \ We will continue to listen and will strive to do better in the future.</p> \n\
