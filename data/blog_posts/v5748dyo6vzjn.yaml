  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“Don’t play near\
  \ the water by yourself or the kushtaka will get you!”</p>\n      <p>“Don’t wander\
  \ into the trees by yourself or you’ll be taken by the little-men-in-the-woods!”\
  </p>\n      <p>Samo had heard such warnings her entire life, repeated in fireside\
  \ tales and stories told to pass the hours when her people left the summer fishing\
  \ camps to travel to their inland lodges closer to Icemark’s caribou herds for the\
  \ winter. Samo was spirit-touched, born with the mark of the elk, an angel’s golden\
  \ eyes, and unusual insight. The cautionary stories always seemed to be directed\
  \ at her, specifically, when it was her father’s turn to tell the tales, as though\
  \ her gifts would be more likely to lead her astray than the other children. Perhaps\
  \ there was some merit to that worry.</p>\n      <p>It wasn’t that she didn’t believe\
  \ the stories on that summer day when she crept down to the shoreline by herself.\
  \ Her father and uncles had been gone for several weeks now, taking her grandmother\
  \ to Seer’s Home, where the elderly woman would live out the rest of her days among\
  \ the Varki elders, now that her aged hips and back could no longer handle the nomadic\
  \ migrations between fishing camps and hunting lodges. Samo wanted to be the first\
  \ to greet her father on his return, and she was twelve years old now, nearly an\
  \ adult by her reckoning, and she was accustomed to the little spirits warning her\
  \ of dangers before others ever became aware of them.</p>\n      <p>Thus, it was\
  \ particularly surprising when a cold, slimy paw wrapped in dank fur clutched her\
  \ from behind, covering her mouth. Her screams were completely muffled, and all\
  \ she could do was struggle in terror as she realized what had grabbed her: a kushtaka!\
  \ Part man, part otter, the soulless creatures would drag her back to their village\
  \ where they would cast her soul from her body and transform her into one of them!\
  \ Worse yet, there were nearly twenty of the fearsome creatures quietly slipping\
  \ from the waters around her. An entire kushtaka raiding party had come, doubtless\
  \ here to take the encampment and disappear with them before anyone could so much\
  \ as raise an alarm.</p>\n      <p>Despite all the terror she already felt, Samo\
  \ discovered that things could still get worse. For every kushtaka that slipped\
  \ from the waves, the insubstantial, sad-eyed form of a human walked beside them.\
  \ Among the lost souls, she saw her father and uncles. Thrashing desperately, Samo\
  \ thrust her small hand out towards her father’s spirit, and the ghostly figure\
  \ reached out to her in response. As their fingertips brushed, it felt like lightning\
  \ struck.</p>\n      <p>The kushtaka holding Samo screamed in agony, the sound finally\
  \ awakening the people in the nearby fishing camp. Her father’s ghostly figure was\
  \ nowhere to be seen, but the monster’s body changed and contorted, its otter’s\
  \ fangs and fur falling away as its bones stretched to reveal her father’s features.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Samo used the opportunity to run towards the camp, where she snatched\
  \ up one of the nets laced with dog bone that had been left there to repel just\
  \ such an incursion. Dashing towards the kushtaka, she saw the spirits of the lost\
  \ Varki moving to aid her, and she swung the net about, pulling the spirits together\
  \ with the soulless bodies that had once belonged to them, triggering transformations\
  \ like the one that had happened with her father. The sounds and cries of battle\
  \ finally drew the rest of the village to her side, and Varki men and women with\
  \ spears and daggers did what they could to fend the remaining kushtaka away while\
  \ herding as many as they could towards Samo and her net.</p>\n      <p>Though over\
  \ half of the kushtaka escaped back into the waves, Samo managed to save her father,\
  \ her uncles, and a handful of other Varki from neighboring encampments. As Samo’\
  s people gathered around, her father knelt down before her. “You do not belong here\
  \ anymore, beloved. Your gifts must be nurtured by those who understand them.”</p>\n\

  \      <br>\n      <p>Samo joined her grandmother at Seer’s Home and helped care\
  \ for the Varki elders there while they taught her everything they knew of her people’\
  s legends, traditions, and magic. In her early twenties she had a brief, passionate\
  \ love with a handsome young man named Nankou who also resided at Seer’s Home for\
  \ a time, but their duties called them apart more often than they drew them together.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Samo’s ability to see what others could not made her into a healer and\
  \ counselor, the person others called on when they suspected that unusual events\
  \ were the doings of unquiet spirits. When fires raged, she spoke to the spirits\
  \ of flame and calmed them. When people disappeared along the coastline, she would\
  \ accompany the hunters who sought out the kushtaka villages hidden nearby, speaking\
  \ to the apparitions that dwelt in the rivers and ocean waves to help guide them\
  \ to those enclaves of lost souls.</p>\n      <p>It seemed to Samo that hardly any\
  \ time at all had passed between that day on the beach where she returned her father\
  \ and uncles from the kushtaka and the day when she looked into a small hand mirror\
  \ and realized that many silver strands now danced amid the raven-wing black of\
  \ her hair. Where had the days gone? Samo did not regret her service, but she envied\
  \ the stories she heard of her old friend Nankou and his adventures slaying linnorms\
  \ and rescuing would-be heroes.</p>\n      <p>One night, Samo sat amid the grove\
  \ of Seer’s Home. Her grandmother had passed almost twenty years before, but the\
  \ woman’s spirit still lingered in that peaceful grove, appearing to Samo’s eyes\
  \ as a majestic elk woven from the leaves and grasses of the grove itself. That\
  \ evening, they conversed as they had so many times before, but unlike those previous\
  \ occasions, their conversation was interrupted by a spectacular and terrifying\
  \ sight.</p>\n      <p>Two great figures battled in the sky, gods of the southern\
  \ lands. One, covered in armored spikes, was struck down, his body ripped asunder.\
  \ As red and silver droplets rained from the sky, Samo’s spiritual sight and physical\
  \ sight crashed together.</p>\n      <p>As the god died above, she saw another battle:\
  \ a powerful young man from a distant land fighting a fearsome demonic owl, until\
  \ both were struck by the droplets of falling god-blood. The twined pair were spun\
  \ a great distance through the air until Samo’s spirit sight faded and she saw that\
  \ they were both truly there, in the flesh, crashing to the ground on Icemark’s\
  \ shores.</p>\n      <p>A Calling thrummed within her. She knew this was a moment\
  \ where all that she was and all that she had learned would be tested, when her\
  \ choices and actions would determine not just the future of Icemark, but perhaps\
  \ that of all the Inner Sea. Perhaps more.</p>\n      <p>She dashed to her home,\
  \ and pulled on her well-used armor of bone, hide, and driftwood. She slid her clan\
  \ hat down over her antlers, so that whoever she met would know that they faced\
  \ a Varki woman of standing and power. Her grandmother’s apparition flowed into\
  \ her, filling her with the peaceful magic of healing and quiet places.</p>\n  \
  \    <p>Moving swiftly towards the shoreline and the fallen figures, her grandmother’\
  s thoughts echoed her own. Let us go, the women thought. <em>This Calling is for\
  \ us, this time is ours, and whatever may happen next, the world will know the power\
  \ of the women of the north</em>.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
