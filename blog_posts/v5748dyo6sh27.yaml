  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The most exciting\
  \ thing (to me) about the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpl?Starfinder-Deck-of-Many-Worlds\"\
  >Deck of Many Worlds</a> is that you can shuffle up and deal <b>millions</b> of\
  \ different worlds to prompt multiple galaxies’ worth of ideas. But for this blog,\
  \ I wanted to show off how even just <b>one</b> of those millions of possibilities\
  \ can provide plenty of different ideas, all on its own!</p> \n      <p>To that\
  \ end, I’ve asked folks from all over Paizo to take a look at the world below and,\
  \ using the system included in the Deck of Many Worlds, fire off some ideas about\
  \ this world and what’s happening there. The attributes of this world (as determined\
  \ by the cards) are: it has Earth-like technology, low magic, its residents get\
  \ along relatively well, it’s got a neutral evil vibe, and religion is influential.\
  \ Each author put their own spin on this combination, leaning on or subverting various\
  \ aspects to tell their own story.</p> \n      <p>Of course, I’d love for you to\
  \ chime in down in the comments with your own ideas and interpretations!</p> \n\
  \      <p>(And for the record: while I picked one of my favorite terrestrial worlds,\
  \ the rest of the cards were drawn completely at random.)<br> <font style=\"margin-left:\

  \     </div> \n      <p>A habitable world with no known sapient lifeforms to compete\
  \ with, was tempting on its own, but the addition of the strange continent sized\
  \ pool of magic spilling out into the galaxy made Hwatroth irresistible for hanakan\
  \ explorers. Hoping to quickly settle the area around the magical anomaly, they\
  \ perhaps did not study the local ecology as much as they could have, missing the\
  \ presence of the vicious and unpredictable mountain eels. Several of the hastily\
  \ established settlements have been decimated, and more are in danger as their defenses\
  \ are inadequate and the eels are congregating around the sudden bounty of a new\
  \ food source. Division, rumors, and insurrection are running rampant within the\
  \ hanakan population, with factions pushing for different defensive or offensive\
  \ strategies. Recently they started offering bounties on mountain eel carcasses\
  \ and a mysterious sect of verthani have begun cashing in. However, the bloodbath\
  \ may have attracted more than just opportunistic hunters.<br> <font style=\"margin-left:\

  \ \n      <p>On this world, a planet-wide society of hanakans have determined that\
  \ a minor event of the past—two people meeting, the previous extinction of the once\
  \ common mountain eels, a particular engineer becoming ill—caused the rending beacon\
  \ to destroy the majority of a continent. They’re fairly sure, based on their calculations,\
  \ that sending a small team back in time to prevent what appears to be an unrelated\
  \ event will cause a butterfly effect that will prevent the catastrophe hundreds\
  \ of years later. This means that anything else changed could lead to something\
  \ much worse or change the entire layout of the society by the time the team returns\
  \ to the present. We might even draw another card out of the deck to determine how\
  \ else the world was changed if the team successfully completes their objective,\
  \ or they accidentally cause any other changes!<br> <font style=\"margin-left: 20px;\

  \ \n      <p>The world of Toriax has changed drastically since the day the beacon\
  \ of eerie purple light burst forth from the continent of Maties. Even before the\
  \ earthquakes stopped and the dust had settled, it was clear that something was\
  \ wrong. Magic users have been unable to access their powers since that day. While\
  \ it was initially thought that the earthquakes were responsible for the planet-wide\
  \ tech outages, not even the most brilliant scientists among the survivors have\
  \ been able to bring those vital services back online. Ships are grounded, communication\
  \ with other worlds seems impossible, and those who thrive on taking advantage of\
  \ chaos have wasted no time. Soothsayers who once claimed to see the future despair\
  \ at this unforeseen emergency, and plead to their gods to restore a modicum of\
  \ normality. Until the source and cause of the beacon is discovered, Toriax is a\
  \ wounded planet in need of help.<br> <font style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
  \ bold;\">—Katina Davis, Webstore Coordinator</font></p> \n      <p>An ecological\
  \ research team from the Pact Worlds was recently granted access to this uninhabited\
  \ and protected world in the Ash’Akan system to investigate concentrated energy\
  \ signatures typically found only on the moon Hallas. But the team made disturbing\
  \ discoveries once they landed, finding eerily silent forests scattered with the\
  \ crystalline forms of wild creatures, and entire towns filled with the crystal\
  \ sculptures of Hanakans going about their daily life. The guards have skirmished\
  \ with a large Mountain Eel once or twice, but little else on this planet moves.\
  \ But a faint purple light builds on the horizon and with each passing day, the\
  \ research team has started to see more signs of life as large amorphous forms dance\
  \ through the sky and shadowy figures dart through the forests. One day, one of\
  \ the figures, a hanakan attendant, emerges from the trees with a message: help.<br>\
  \ <font style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">—Joan Hong, Customer Service\
  \ Representative</font></p> \n      <p>Not native to the planet Sevestere, the verthani\
  \ are an offshoot of the Pure One sect that left Verces millennia ago to establish\
  \ a home free of invasive magic and technology. Here, they’ve established a capital\
  \ city of hundreds of thousands, all working together toward a peaceful—yet controlled—\
  society free of the bonds of magic and tech. Near the equator is a massive, stationary\
  \ cyclone of energy 1,000 miles wide known as the Clashenmere, the only area on\
  \ the planet where magic functions. Within the vortex, life is destroyed, and ships\
  \ are torn apart. A 20-mile wide rim of dark clouds and lightning-filled skies circling\
  \ the Clashenmere marks the territory of the hanakan, a race of magic-using creatures\
  \ that are survivors of a failed teleportation several hundred years ago. They seek\
  \ to build a magical craft capable of departing the planet or a portal that will\
  \ return them to their home world; their disdain of technology-powered ships has\
  \ kept them marooned here. The most well-known danger on Sevestere are mountain\
  \ eels, which in addition to residing in the numerous mountains of the planet are\
  \ also numerous around the Clashenmere. The most dangerous creatures on the planet\
  \ are rumored to be the hallajins, though their purpose for being here is as mysterious\
  \ as ever.<br> <font style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">—Jim Butler,\
  \ VP of Marketing &amp; Licensing</font></p> \n      <p>Strange bedfellows, the\
  \ magical hanakans and the technological verthani, yet they made their peace on\
  \ the world of Herris deep in the Vast. Grudging acceptance of each other’s talents\
  \ allowed both civilizations to flourish briefly on the sedate and resource-rich\
  \ planet, but ultimately their incompatible natures meant that they could not come\
  \ to each other’s aid when the hallajin arrived. The hallajin seemed to be trying\
  \ to make contact, but any such contact caused tremendous psychic pain and usually\
  \ resulted in the one contacted losing their mind. The hallajin prevented anyone\
  \ from leaving the planet, though it isn’t known whether or not doing so was with\
  \ intent. The last joint act of the two societies on the planet was to erect a beacon,\
  \ broadcasting both magically and technologically, warning all who approach to stay\
  \ away. Some may choose to ignore the warning, but at their own peril.<br> <font\

  \ \n      <p>Not every civilizations attempt at drift implementation is successful,\
  \ and this world is a living example of the consequences of failure. Regardless\
  \ of the claims on how the accident began a massive storm now rages around the world's\
  \ initial drift experiment. Pockets of reality are consumed by the storm as creatures\
  \ from beyond imagining spill forth in their place. Of the expeditions sent in to\
  \ shut down the experiment, only a single group has returned. The team confirmed\
  \ that their world is being siphoned into the drift, but also had stories of a fiery\
  \ hellscape erupting around them during their exploration. This only served to reinforce\
  \ a recently popularized theory: the planets core itself is slowly being phased\
  \ into the drift as its mantle destabilizes.<br> <font style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
  \ font-weight: bold;\">—Erik Keith, QA Engineer</font></p> \n      <p>In the early\
  \ days of verthani space travel a group of Pure Ones settled this world, where they\
  \ could be free of technology once they dismantled the ship that brought them. No\
  \ one knows if the beacon summoned them, or if they found it, but for generations\
  \ it provided for them. Eventually the hanakans came, claiming a voice they worshipped\
  \ for as long as they remembered told them it needed them here. And finally, the\
  \ storms began. Strange lighting bombarded the beacon for days and ghostly beings\
  \ flittered around it. Then everything stopped, the storms, the beacon, the creatures.\
  \ For a short time, things returned to normal. But now the land tears itself apart\
  \ as it moves, shifting to form itself around the beacon. The stars and constellations\
  \ move in the sky. The past and future collide in temporal distortions. And the\
  \ beacon sits at the center of everything.<br> <font style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
  \ font-weight: bold;\">—Diego Valdez, Customer Service Representative</font></p>\
  \ \n      <p>Two separate expeditions have been dispatched to investigate this odd\
  \ world, dubbed “The Font”. Its namesake physical feature is an enormous fountain\
  \ of ionizing radiation shooting from the core of the planet directly away from\
  \ the system’s star, into deep space. A contingent of hanakans are currently en\
  \ route via their new experimental “Gate-Thrower” magical vessel. The hanakans have\
  \ lodged an official complaint indicating their belief that this planet is home\
  \ to their legendary “Ssssithhh’sssthek Temple” and is forbidden to all other species.\
  \ However, a verthani science expedition recently arrived with intentions of investigating\
  \ and possibly harnessing the fantastic power output of the Font. They reported\
  \ bizarre and ancient alien ruins riddled with mountain eels. As they got closer\
  \ and closer to the font itself, the reports became more and more fantastic, erratic,\
  \ and nonsensical, before ceasing entirely.<br> <font style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
  \ font-weight: bold;\">—Cosmo Eisele, Sales Associate</font></p> \n      <p>Hanakans\
  \ and Verthani have worked together for centuries, combining their innate magical\
  \ ability and advanced cybernetics acumen towards all manner of legendary magitech\
  \ that propelled their shared culture to new heights. In a great college, their\
  \ brightest and most capable worked tirelessly on a new invention - a magitech vision\
  \ portal that would permit them to see the future and change it to suit their whims.\
  \ Unfortunately, their invention backfired and exploded, consuming the college and\
  \ its occupants and opening a massive trans-dimensional rift to all corners of the\
  \ galaxy. Hallajin, mountain eels, and many other dangerous creatures immediately\
  \ began pouring through the rift, and within a few short months the planet was largely\
  \ overrun. Now, the remnants of the once-proud hanakan/verthani civilization are\
  \ locked in a desperate struggle to survive - and just maybe to figure out a way\
  \ to reverse the portal that remains open to this day.<br> <font style=\"margin-left:\
  \ 20px; font-weight: bold;\">—Brian Bauman, Software Developer</font></p> \n   \
  \   <p>Clearly what we have here is an advanced magical society that foresaw a future\
  \ in which the planet's oceans were decimated, proactively created a complex planet-spanning\
  \ arcane apparatus to preserve and protect them, and inadvertently triggered a global\
  \ cataclysm that forced the world's aquatic and land-dwelling life to switch habitats,\
  \ obviously resulting in mass extinctions for any species not already living near\
  \ a coastline. Unless you're trying to tell me \"mountain eels\" were already a\
  \ thing.<br> <font style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">—Andrew White,\
