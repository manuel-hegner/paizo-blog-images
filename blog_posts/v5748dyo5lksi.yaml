  \ of the new faces here at Paizo, you got to learn some more about the newest developers.\
  \ However, there are a couple of folks that have been here longer, working in other\
  \ capacities, who haven't been formally introduced in their new roles as developers.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Jason Keeley, Developer</h2> \n     <p>I'm not exactly\
  \ new to Paizo; I was hired an editor about three years ago. They even let me <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lha8?Welcome-Jason-Keeley\">introduce myself</a> back\
  \ then. I'm not even that new to development. After all, I got hijacked into helping\
  \ the Starfinder RPG along around the end of 2016. And I think I developed a couple\
  \ of Pathfinder RPG Player Companions around that time too. I didn't get the official\
  \ title of developer until the middle of last year, however. So, of all the new\
  \ faces being introduced in this blog, I'm definitely the oldest.</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ that doesn't mean I don't have something exciting to say! With Rob McCreary becoming\
  \ the Starfinder creative director, I tricked everyone into letting me develop the\
  \ next few volumes of the Starfinder adventure path! They then told me the AP is\
  \ going monthly, so I guess the joke is on me.</p> \n     <p>There is so much happening\
  \ right now. Dead Suns is coming to an explosive finale that is sure to thrill players.\
  \ We're starting to see the adventures for Against the Aeon Throne, and I'm already\
  \ rooting hard for the rebels of Madelon's Landing, because the Azlanti Star Empire\
  \ is a bunch of jerks. I'm also putting the finishing touches on the outline for\
  \ the adventure path after that, which I can't wait to tell you about!</p> \n  \
  \   <p>It's going to be an exciting year. IN SPACE!</p> \n     <h2>Joe Pasini, Developer</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Hi! I'm Joe, and I totally belong here.</p> \n     <p>I snuck in to\
  \ Paizo in late 2016, so I'm quite excited for the opportunity to say hello!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Here's an abridged timeline of what I've gotten away with thus far.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>September 2016:</i> I joined Paizo as a temporary editor, just as\
  \ Starfinder hit the editorial fan, and I fell in love with the game right away.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>March 2017:</i> I became an official Paizo employee, and the Golem\
  \ whispered its great secrets into my ear as it instilled me with a small fraction\
  \ of its power. There was tea and biscuits afterward.</p> \n     <p><i>June 2017:</i>\
  \ After eight months of putting up with me—and during a period of great change—\
  the powers that be drew straws, and the development team won (or lost): I became\
  \ a developer! I worked on a couple Player Companions and then became the back-matter\
  \ developer for the first half of the War for the Crown Adventure Path.</p> \n \
  \    <p><i>December 2017:</i> I joined the Starfinder dev team! Now it's aliens\
  \ and lasers, all day, erryday, and I love it.</p> \n     <p>Before getting to work\
  \ with the incredible folks here at Paizo, my biggest accomplishment was thru-hiking\
  \ the Appalachian Trail, which I can talk about for far too long if you let me.\
  \ I also play a ton of board games, love etymology, and (with Jason Keeley) will\
  \ be bringing you Paizo Con Puzzle Hunts as long as they let us.</p> \n     <p>I'm\
  \ partially engaged on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/joeadultman\">@joeadultman</a>),\
  \ where I am open to suggestions—especially how those of us in the industry can\
  \ make our games more accessible, inclusive, and fun!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
