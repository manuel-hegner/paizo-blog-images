  description\">Last week, I showed off one of the Eldest write-ups from our upcoming\
  \ campaign setting book, <a href=\"/products/btpy9op9\"><em>The First World, Realm\
  \ of the Fey</em></a>. This week, I thought I'd give you a taste of some of the\
  \ bizarre adventure locations you'll find inside.</p> \n    <p>My philosophy with\
  \ gazetteers has always been to squeeze as many ideas into an article (or in this\
  \ case, book) as possible: give GMs just enough fun details to get their minds spinning,\
  \ then go off in an entirely different direction and leave them (or future adventures)\
  \ to fill in the rest. These short shotgun blasts of ideas are also one of my favorite\
  \ thing to write, and thus I try to carve them out as much space in my books as\
  \ possible! As a result, this book has a heaping helping of encounter locations,\
  \ ranging in size from a mere paragraph for random adventure sites to an entire\
  \ page for the Eldest's seats of power or cities in need of maps. Presented below\
  \ is just one of these locations, plus its awesome illustration!</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Cobyslarni</b>: The gleaming domes and steeples of this magical academy\
  \ would be impressive anywhere, yet instead of standing atop a mountaintop or in\
  \ some bustling city, the Traveling Academy of Cobyslarni roams the plains of the\
  \ First World, riding like a howdah atop an enormous, three-eyed elephantine beast.\
  \ The university's charter holds that its founder, Cobyslarni, decided the best\
  \ way to foster independent thought was to be constantly moving, never able to be\
  \ claimed by any given Eldest or city government. In the academy's halls, some of\
  \ the greatest arcane and occult scholars of the First World gather to teach promising\
  \ students, peruse the school's extradimensional libraries, or debate the finer\
  \ points of occult theory upon floating disks in the school's open-air auditoriums.\
  \ Overseeing the day-to-day running of the school is <b>Headmistress Bofika Nemesan</b>\
  \ (NG female human wizard 11/occultist 6), chosen from among her peers by the school's\
  \ illustrious founder. As for Cobyslarni himself, any student or traveler may ask\
  \ him questions, yet he rarely deigns to answer these days, busy as he is contemplating\
  \ the mysteries of the multiverse and carrying the school upon his vast back.</p>\
