There are many words I could use to describe this year in Organized Play: turbulent, uncertain, hopeful...the list goes on.

By the same token, there are still many areas that haven't changed: conventions are mostly still online, and we're not sure what the future of large-scale shows will look like.</p>

                   <h2>OPC Musings</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">As we approach the end of the year, it's tradition to look back on the year that was. There are many words I could use to describe this year in Organized Play: turbulent, uncertain, hopeful...the list goes on. In some ways we have made progress from where we were last year: physical games are slowly starting up in some areas, we've got piles of new content for our players, and we've produced another full year of scenarios.

                   <p>One certainty for me in all of this is the community. No matter what, you're all out there playing games, having a good time and enjoying our stories, I've got the table data to prove it. It's exciting to know that the work we're doing is bringing some joy to your lives. I hope that this holiday season (for those of you who celebrate), you're able to get together with your biological and chosen families, as appropriate, and throw some dice together. You never know, Grandma might get really into playing Kyra from the <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em>! If you're looking for some festive cheer this season, definitely check out this month's new Starfinder Society release, A <em>Festive Operation</em>; I think it'll be a staple of December schedules for the next few years.</p> 
                   <p>Does your gaming group have holiday traditions? Are you giving your GMs something special for the season? Let me know in the comments down below!</p> 
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month's digital releases, available December 15, 2021:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-307-The-Locked-Lodge">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-07: The Locked Lodge</a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02al1?Pathfinder-Bounty-17-Sodden-Stories">Pathfinder Bounty #17: Sodden Stories</a></p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aku?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-412-A-Festive-Operation">Starfinder Society Scenario #4-12: A Festive Operation</a>*</p> 
                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>For those of you who have not already noticed, the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options</a> page contains sanctioning for both <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a>! These two books had a lot of tricky elements, especially <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, and we're thankful for your patience while we sorted through them. I'd especially like to thank Linda Zayas-Palmer and Mark Seifter for spending a <em>lot</em> of time with me in the week before Thanksgiving working to get them out before the holiday, Pathfinders, go forth and enjoy your new content!</p> 
                   <p>For my fellow Starfinders, we've also sanctioned the most recent standalone adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xs?Starfinder-Adventure-The-Liberation-of-Locus1"><em>The Liberation of Locus-1</em></a>, for credit, and its rules options are also available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. We hope you enjoy this new adventure!</p> 
                   <p>Looking forward, there are two Pathfinder rulebooks coming out in December: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aoy?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth"><em>Lost Omens: Monsters of Myth</em></a> and the long-awaited <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>. We hope to have the sanctioning for both of these ready for street date; they're a pretty light lift, so I'm very hopeful. On the Adventures front, we're also starting to work through the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</em></a>, and hope to have more to share on that soon.</p> 
                   <h2>Nova Update</h2> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shfs?Nova-Qualifications-Update">Last year, we announced</a> that we’d be adding one high-level scenario per year to the qualifying scenarios for Nova credit. We intended for this to be our end-of-year scenario each year; however, in looking at the plan for this year, the final scenario of the Data Scourge metaplot is (spoilers!) a 5-8, which is not quite high enough level to qualify for our requirements. As a result, we are adding the Nova tag to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><b><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></b></a>. All previous and future runs (up to three) of this scenario will count towards the 10-scenario requirement for Nova qualification. Thanks to the VOs who pointed out this potential snag to me!</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p></p> 
                   <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                   <h4>Campaign Service Coins</h4> 
                   <p>At SkålCon at the end of October, we awarded two new Campaign Service Coins. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Aerine Caerwyn</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #850<br> <b>Sean Pearson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #851</p> 
                   <p>It also came to my attention that we never formally announced the two recipients from last year’s SkålCon Online, so I would like to formally recognize:<br> <b>James Anderson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #840<br> <b>Tineke Bolleman</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #841</p> 
                   <h4>GM Ranks</h4> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their fifth star for Pathfinder Society (first edition), and one GM earned their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star</b>: Idaho, Joshua Blazej<br> <b>5th Nova</b>: Hilary Moon Murphy</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com .</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the holiday season!</p>

                   <p>You can also try the game directly on Tabletop Simulator on Steam. You need to have Tabletop installed, then <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663893091">go to download the Pathfinder Arena demo</a> to add it to your games. Then run Tabletop Simulator and start fighting with your friends in the Arena! You can find a fast guide to the main Tabletop Simulator <a href="https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/player-guides/basic-controls/">features here</a>. We have uploaded the rulebook, plus the summary cards. You will also find the ability tokens already in the bag, according to the number of players at the table. Mind that you will need to add the extra strength tokens according to the number of players.</p> 
                   <p><b>Backers who now join the campaign</b> already get Amiri, the barbarian, as an extra hero to play with, plus four extra monsters: the hobgoblin general (level 3), the ghoul (level 1), the young red dragon (level 4), and the onidoshi (level 4). </p> 
                   <p>The onidoshi can increase its total life points by 2 (as does the troll), and <b>it deals a strong damage output in both range and melee.</b> It’s also able to attack heroes twice if they’re in the range of both attacks (as does the ettin).</p> 
                   <p>The young red dragon is a fearsome opponent that can <b>attack at 360 degrees and ignore heroes’ defenses!</b> Players would be wise to plan very carefully when to strike against it!</p> 
                   <p>The hobgoblin general brings a new special ability to the game: when it deals critical damage, <b>the targeted hero is pushed up to two tiles away</b>. This effect can lead the opponents into other monsters' range to trigger even more attacks and score more glory points!</p> 
                   <p><b>The ghoul’s only attack is a melee attack, but it has the special ability to lower the number of your action points</b> and defense through negative tokens. This is particularly effective at the beginning of the game, when every hero has only 4 actions per turn.</p> 
                   <p>A custom 8-face die has also been unlocked, along with three extra cards per each hero’s deck, including expansions and unlocked stretch goals!</p> 
                   <p><b>Seelah is also waiting in the next stretch goal</b>. As soon as she’s unlocked, she will immediately get 3 extra cards too!</p> 
                   <p>We are also releasing three social stretch goals: like and follow the game on Board Game Geek to get new Shrine Tiles dedicated to Brigh, Nethys, Calistria, and Pharasma. Brigh allows you to rotate other tiles than the one your hero stands on; Nethys enhances your magic abilities, giving you an extra spell; Calistria rewards monster-hunter heroes with ability tokens; and Pharasma adds glory points if the hero has defeated a certain number of monsters at the end of the game.</p>

                   <p>The other two social stretch goals concern our Facebook group. Invite new members or join it now to unlock another extra card for each hero and the miniature of the harpy, a new level-2 monster!</p>

                   <p>I’m happy to announce that as of last week, Paizo has partnered with DriveThruRPG, hosts of the Pathfinder Infinite and Starfinder Infinite community content programs, to offer print-on-demand versions of select out-of-print titles. We’ve got 10 titles up currently, including <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/359514/Pathfinder-Module-The-Emerald-Spire-Superdungeon-PF1"><em>The Emerald Spire Superdungeon</em></a> and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/357274/Pathfinder-Chronicles-Campaign-Setting-OGL-35"><em>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</em></a> (both in your choice of soft- or hardcover versions); missing volumes of the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/336398/Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-25-The-Bastards-of-Erebus-Council-of-Thieves-1-of-6PF1">Council of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/363571/Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-71-Rasputin-Must-Die-Reign-of-Winter-5-of-6PF1">Reign of Winter</a>, and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/360161/Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-138-Rise-of-New-Thassilon-Return-of-the-Runelords-6-of-6PF1">Return of the Runelords</a> Adventure Paths; Pathfinder Campaign Setting favorites <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/364007/Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Paths-of-Prestige-PF1"><em>Paths of Prestige</em></a>, <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/336466/Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide-PF1"><em>Technology Guide</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/369421/Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-The-Worldwound-PF1"><em>The Worldwound</em></a>; and both <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/336399/Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-Goblins-PF1"><em>We Be Goblins!</em></a> and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/369636/Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-Goblins-Too-PF1"><em>We Be Goblins Too!</em></a></p>

                   <p>These print-on-demand versions differ from the originals only in that the inside covers have been printed as additional pages in the books’ interiors (and that some are now available as softcovers for the first time), and they will easily fill out gaps in any collector’s bookshelf.</p> 
                   <p>We have more titles in the works and will keep adding more as long as folks keep buying the ones we’ve got. Make sure to let us know in the comments what out-of-print titles you most want to see available as print-on-demand offerings, and we’ll set our priorities accordingly.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Today is Thanksgiving in the United States, so the Organized Play team wanted to take a moment to give thanks to our Paizo community. Without you all, the worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder would be just stories we told ourselves. We’re grateful for all your support and wish you well as this year comes to a close. We also want to thank the Organized Play community organizers for supporting our programs in these turbulent times. Without the venture-officers, we would lack structure, and without GMs, we would lack games. To all of you who spend time planning schedules and completing tasks behind the scenes, a huge shout out of thanks!</p>

                   <p>Every year we have several dozen events which support charities. We developed the charity boon programs to support these efforts. We’d like to recognize a few of the events who conducted charitable activities and supported the charities’ good works!</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <p><b>Cosmic Crittercon 4, April 23-25</b><br> The Crittermanders raised $6,789, a very pleasing and orderly sum, for Doctors Without Borders in their fourth annual charity event. They also had cookies!</p> 
                   <p><b>Con-Current 2021, June 11-13</b><br> With charity boons, embroidered items, and rerolls, the Ohio Organized Play community raised $5,295 for Planned Parenthood and Jasper’s Game Day.</p> 
                   <p><b>Defenders of the Healing Flame, August 21 &amp; November 6</b><br> With two charity streams and many shenanigans, the team raised $6,420 and threw one glitterbomb at the OPC.</p> 
                   <p><b>Gen Con Online, September 16-19</b><br> Gen Con auctioned off boons, signed books and embroidered items to support Take This and Trinity House, raising a total of $5,886!</p> 
                   <p><b>SkålCon 2021, October 29-31, Plymouth MN</b><br> In celebration of their first physical con since the pandemic began, the community raised $4,750 for Tubman, a local shelter, and collected physical goods to donate as well.</p> 
                   <p><b>PF2e Foundry Community for Extra Life 2021, November 6th</b><br> The Foundry developers’ streamed game on their platform raised $3,567 for Extra Life.</p> 
                   <p><b>Mace 2021, November 12-14, Charlotte NC</b><br> The North Carolina community came out and raised $2,800 for the North Carolina Zoo and $3,000 for Veteran’s Bridge Home.</p> 
                   <p>If we missed your event or you want to promote an upcoming charity event, please let us know in the comments! We know there are charity events year-round that deserve the attention.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time, Explore! Report! Cooperate! and eat some pie for me!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“I don’t like the look of that <em>sloop</em>,” said Daker, punctuating the last word with his ever-present sneer.</p> 
                   <p>Callum extended his spyglass and directed it at the little vessel, a little less than two hundred feet to port. Its crew scurried about their duties as the sun reached for the golden edge of the western horizon.</p> 
                   <p>“A fisherman,” said Callum, still scanning the deck of the other vessel, “returning home. Not everyone’s a pirate, Gaius.”</p> 
                   <p>“We’re in the Shackles, Orrin,” answered Daker, still sneering at the smaller ship. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re all pirates, ‘til they prove otherwise.”</p> 
                   <p>They had the poopdeck of the <em>Madam Diabola</em> to themselves, a sleek Chelish warship armed with the latest in cannon technology, each devil-mouthed barrel etched with a magic sigil which promised every shot they fired would fly deadly and true. The <em>Madam</em> was given the honor of watching this insignificant settlement’s harbor while Admiral Lecarnas and the rest of the punitive fleet sailed off to lay siege to Drenchport that very morning. Callum didn’t even know the town’s name, but he also didn’t care.</p> 
                   <p>“I grant you, she’s a bold one,” Callum answered, watching as the sloop slowly moved in their direction. “Must’ve sailed out early morning, before we sealed the harbor. We could just warn her off with a hazard flag.”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius Daker was too bloodthirsty in Callum’s opinion, even if he was his oldest friend from his Fort Gorthoklek days. Too enthusiastic with the sap when leading a press gang, too ready to—</p> 
                   <p>“Fire a bit of iron across her bow with that pretty new swivel gun,” said Daker, eyeing the polished little cannon mounted on the port rail. “And beat to quarters. Lads and ladies need a bit of exercise, to keep ‘em on their toes.”</p> 
                   <p><em>Madam Diabola</em> was one of three vessels in the fleet outfitted with the new weapons, swivel guns similar to smaller versions of the black iron cannons on the decks below, tended by scurrying halfling prisoners the crew had taken to calling “powder rats.” Gaius Daker wanted to hear the cannon roar. Callum thought such impulse foolish. Would the captain approve of such actions?</p> 
                   <p>“Gaius,” began Callum, but swallowed the rest of his words when he caught Daker’s glare. He knew that look well. Daker was senior midshipman of the watch, and his words were no mere suggestion. That dark look made it an order.</p> 
                   <p>“Beat to quarters!” Callum shouted, turning to the swivel gun.</p> 
                   <p>Sailors across the vessel leapt into action and the sound of martial drums filled the air. Callum couldn’t help but admire the artistry of the little bronze cannon, mounted on the gunwale, its mouth fashioned like a dragon’s maw, fangs bent outward. He checked the breech, pleased to find it properly loaded and ready. Captain Hecata was fond of the lash, and her newly trained gun crews knew this better than most. They tended Madam’s newfangled weapons of war well, out of fear if not pride.</p> 
                   <p>The sloop was much closer now, turning to port so that it showed Madam her broad side. Callum, ready at the gunwale, turned to look at Gaius Daker, who he caught tugging at his officer’s jacket to sharpen the lines of his uniform.</p> 
                   <p>“They’re giving us a fat target, Gaius,” Callum said, a bit of pleading in his voice. “Maybe a signal flag’ll do the trick.”</p> 
                   <p>“A signal flag, Mister Callum?” came the lilting alto of Captain Hecata as she climbed up onto the poopdeck. “Perhaps I should prepare tea for these Shackles scum while you wave silk at them? What have we here, Mister Daker?”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius, eyes alight with bloodlust and just plan lust, grinned at the captain and saluted. </p> 
                   <p>“Suspicious vessel off the port, Captain! I ordered Midshipman Callum to fire a warning shot across her bow!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum grimaced. Just like Gaius to throw him overboard if it made him shine a bit brighter in Hecata’s emerald eyes. Daker offered the captain his spyglass and she took it, rewarding him with one of her unreadable smiles that could as easily portend divine preferment as utter doom. She looked through Daker’s brass device and within a heartbeat repeated the midshipman’s order.</p> 
                   <p>“Mister Callum, fire that shot. And I wouldn’t be cross with you if that shot puts a crimson part in someone’s hair.”</p> 
                   <p>Callum nodded and turned the swivel gun in the direction the sloop’s starboard bow. He angled the shot as low as he dared—Hecata might not care if he took off some poor bastard’s head, but he did. He asked a blessing from Abadar and fired the cannon. The shot ripped a hole low in the sloop’s staysail and a cry of fear washed across the space between the vessels, announcing the sloop crew’s shock.</p> 
                   <p>A woman in a long coat came to the starboard rail of the sloop, waving both arms frantically.</p> 
                   <p>“Ahoy, Chelish warship!” the woman cried, long brown locks freed as she added her hat to her call for mercy. “We’re honest fishermen, bringing a bellyful to our little island! See how low we ride?”</p> 
                   <p>Callum noted the ship was indeed running awfully low in the water.</p> 
                   <p>“You feed pirates then?” shouted Captain Hecata with a contemptuous air, hands on her hips.</p> 
                   <p>“Nay! Settlers, eking out a life in these hard islands! Shelly is a free port, and we give no allegiance to any pirate lord!”</p> 
                   <p>“Our intelligence says otherwise,” said the captain, and Callum saw she wore that same smile she had given to Gaius. Those fishermen had best say their prayers. It was clear now where this encounter was headed.</p> 
                   <p>Callum joined the naval academy in Hinji when it became clear his mercurial father would favor his younger brother when the inheritance was doled out. He had been fed tales of high adventure on the open seas, contending with the elements and wild creatures, bloodthirsty pirates and rebels intent on bringing Cheliax to its knees. Instead, he found himself part of an instrument of intimidation. Well-armed nautical bullies.</p> 
                   <p>“There are a dozen innocent souls on this ship, captain!” the brown-haired mariner in the sloop called out across the water. “We bring back the bounty of the sea to feed hungry bellies. Men, women, and children. No more, no less. I beg you let us pass!”</p> 
                   <p>The woman’s last words were made with hands clasped together, as if offering up a prayer.</p> 
                   <p>“Prepare to be boarded,” sang Captain Hecata, drawing her cutlass and nodding to Midshipman Daker, who wore a giddy grin on his face.</p> 
                   <p>Callum looked back at the sloop, the long-haired fisherwoman, hands still clasped like a supplicant…and then his eyes caught a shimmer, as though he looked at a painting behind glass, tilted to catch the sun’s rays. A warning tingled at the base of his spine. He turned to share his misgivings with the captain, when the unmistakable sound of a cannon report, several in fact, sent him instinctively to the deck, prostrate with his arms cradling his head. The first ball struck the portside railing on the quarterdeck below, obliterating wood and sending deadly splinters in all directions. The second tore through Gaius Daker, reducing him to an ugly spray of red.</p> 
                   <p>In the next moment Callum was helping the captain up from the deck, one side of her smart Chelish uniform painted with Daker’s blood. </p> 
                   <p>“Return fire!” she roared, shaking off Callum’s assistance. “By all the tines in Hell, that’s no bloody fisherman!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum glanced to his left—the sloop was gone. In its place was a black-sailed brigantine, the iron mouths of cannon protruding from open gun ports, its main deck alive with surly-looking sailors brandishing weapons.</p>

                   <p><em>Pirates!</em> he thought as <em>Madam Diabola’s</em> new guns answered the brigantine’s attack. But it was as if the wind took the iron hurled at their enemy away like fallen leaves. Of its sixteen guns, only a single cannonball connected with their chameleon foe. What sorcery did these brigands have at their disposal? Illusion to disguise a warship? Elemental servants to carry away iron shot? </p> 
                   <p>It was then that Callum caught sight of the brown-haired woman again. He could swear she was smiling at him directly, and as if to confirm it, she gave him a jovial wave and held her hands up to her mouth to trumpet her words across the now-smoky distance.</p> 
                   <p>“Welcome to the Shackles!” she cried.</p>

                   <p>[D]: Product doesn’t really talk to marketing. There’s a high wall, three moats, and pit traps filled with trolls between us and the marketing department. Our intradepartmental memos are stuffed in the mouths of junior VPs who are exchanged via catapult nightly. That said, I don’t disapprove. </p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’ve heard the Gold Edition comes with NPC cards that can hang on the GM screen, with artwork on the front for players and roleplaying info on the back for the GM. What kinds of NPCs might we expect?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: You’ll see all the most interesting denizens of Absalom: noble goblins, brave goblins, handsome goblins and brilliant goblins. Probably some other things, too, but I really haven’t checked.</p>

                   <p><b>M: It also comes with location cards. Artwork of the building or location on front, background information on the back. We’ve never seen that before from the Warehouse. Why now?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Locations cards really help you understand where you are at all times. If you’re a member of the Pathfinder Society, that’s great for their motto of “Explore, Report, Cooperate”. And if you’re a member of the Bloody Barbers, it’s perfect for their motto of, “Bury the bodies further from the house.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’m surprised a goblin would come up with wearable faction jewelry for players. What was your inspiration?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: We take special pride in our jewelry pieces. They’re designed by our crack jewelry designers, and lovingly crafted from the fillings ripped out of the teeth of marketing goblin project coordinators. Reduce, reuse, recycle, but without the reduce part—we call that “maximizing operational efficiency.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I see. So, you included several short bonus adventures in this Gold Edition. How do you expect GMs to use these?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Our original design mandate for the bonus encounters was that they would be a short, sharp way to terrorize an adventuring party, complete with large battle maps to mark where the characters fell.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Oh, so you also include large battle maps? </b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Battles are more fun if you know where you are and what’s around you. After all, the difference in a five foot square is sometimes the difference between living to fight another day and your fellow party members looting your corpse.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: There’s quite a bit more that will come in the box that I saw on <a href="https://www.beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom">beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom</a>. How would you rate your website goblins?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: In general, our website goblins aren’t worth the cost of the oil to boil them. On the rare occasion that they actually manage to make the website work properly, we hold a party with floats and cake.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Any last quote you’d like to leave our readers with? Words of wisdom?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: If you open your windows after sundown, and if the wind is blowing just right, you can hear the screams of the mighty warehouse engines coming to life. They’re ready—nay, eager—to build something great for the Pathfinder audience, and I think the product department has really knocked it out of the park. Assuming the website goblins can keep the site up and the marketing department doesn’t go berserk and start handing the boxes out with happy meals, we should be in for a good ride.</p>

                   <p>In Pathfinder Arena you will take the role of one of the iconic heroes of Pathfinder, trapped in a magical entity, calling itself “Arena”. The entity poses a challenge to the party: select a champion to claim the right to escape from it. <b>Score glory points by defeating the monsters summoned in the Arena, or by triggering beasts against your opponents!</b></p> 
                   <p>Players can modify the Arena structure by spending action points to push or rotate the tiles. By doing so, players can move opponents into a monster’s range and trigger an attack to score as many points as the damage the monsters inflict.</p> 
                   <p><b>Each hero has asymmetric abilities and a tailor-made deck, reflecting their class.</b> Heroes level up during the game by picking up tokens in the Arena to enhance their abilities and access to their deck. Choosing which cards to draft and which ability to prioritize enables players to develop different strategies in the Arena and makes each hero unique.</p>

                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b>We tried something a little different from the conventional spellcaster model with the psychic’s lower number of spell slots and strong focus on …focus... cantrips, amps, and other special powers, with conventional slotted spells filling a more supplemental role. The overwhelming majority of you responded that you preferred this approach over a conventional spellcaster approach; however, much of the feedback also indicated that while what the psychic got in exchange for this reduced spell loadout was very interesting, it didn’t feel powerful or useful enough to make up for the difference in lost spell slots. So, a major direction of change for the psychic will be to retain the “fewer spell slots” and “cantrip/amp focus” class role, but adjust the power level of the supplemental pieces so that you can truly feel like you’ve unleashed the awesome power of your mind. I’ll get into some of the approaches we’re taking in each point below.</p> 
                   <p>We also wanted to get a sense in the playtest of what you all thought of the general tone and genre of the class. This was pretty conclusive—over two-thirds of respondents said the more magical cast was working for them, so we’ll be staying the course here as well!</p> 
                   <p><b>Spells and Spellcasting:</b> A strong majority of respondents stated that they preferred the playtest arrangement of the psychic’s spellcasting and key ability scores, so we’ll be sticking to those and keeping the psychic as a spontaneous occult spellcaster whose subconscious mind gives them a thematic choice of key ability score between Intelligence and Charisma.</p> 
                   <p>I also want to call out that, as with past spellcaster playtests, the specific spells granted on the conscious minds drew only on spells we had already published, so some needed to be chosen for role (“a damaging spell here” or “a scouting spell here”) and easy understandability even if they were a little outside the theme—for instance, <em>magic missile</em> was a stand-in for a more on-theme damaging level 1 spell on the distant grasp psychic. The final <em>Dark Archive</em> book will introduce several new spells with the psychic in mind for thematically tighter granted spells!</p> 
                   <p><b>Psyche:</b> The ability to unleash your psyche to amp spells for free was originally intended to let psychics really feel like they got to be masters of focus by cheating the Focus Point caps. However, the fact that psychics had almost unlimited Focus Points took up a lot of the power budget for the class, rippling into the psyches needing to come online later and have both benefits and drawbacks, as well as affecting the power of amps (which I'll touch on next). Therefore, one of the biggest changes we’ll be making to psychic is to remove this aspect of Unleash Psyche, and then redistribute that power through the rest of the class for a more consistent play experience. </p> 
                   <p>Consistent feedback also showed that while psyches were interesting when unleashed, most combats didn’t last long enough after the third turn to make getting into the psyche feel worthwhile (meaning that much of the psychic’s power was tied up in a feature they had inconsistent access to). While we don’t want to make Unleash Psyche an “assumed first-turn action” in the vein of Rage, Hunt Prey, or similar, we do want to make it easier to do. Thankfully, with the removal of psyche’s role as a source of unlimited Focus Points, we have a lot of options for making it more accessible, as well as for adding more punch, such as effects that happen when your first Unleash your Psyche, more special abilities that happen automatically when you are unleashed, or the ability to end your psyche earlier for a single big benefit.</p> 
                   <p><b>Amps:</b> Amps are one of the major parts of the psychic, and most respondents stated that they found these options very interesting—Mark tells me that amps scored among the highest for “interesting” of any class we’ve playtested—but also that they felt weak in comparison to normal focus spells. They were! Since Unleash Psyche meant that you could amp your focus cantrips 5 or more times in a single combat, as opposed to a hard maximum of 3, those amps needed to be a little under the balance point of spells like <em>fire ray</em>. While psychics will retain their focus on amps, they likely won’t have such an outsized number of them, so we have plenty of room to now bring the power scale of amps back up.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Stuff!:</b> Of course, we always increase the number of options between the playtest and the final class! In addition to the new spells that will be added in Dark Archive, the psychic will of course be gaining new feats and choices of both conscious and subconscious minds. In honor of our new iconic psychic, Thaleon, I’ll share his conscious mind, which is called the tangible dream. This path focuses on materializing and projecting the user’s thoughts into the physical world, allowing you to conjure walls, blades, and other constructs of force (or astral thread, or ectoplasm, as your character concept fits) around the battlefield!</p> 
                   <p>I’m getting a vision… It’s… of Mark, talking about the thaumaturge!</p>

                   </table> 
                   <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the thaumaturge class. I first want to thank you all for participating in the playtest by running and playing games, posting your playtest results and analysis, answering surveys, and having good discussions! In particular, the playtest was happening during a pretty challenging period for us at Paizo, and I appreciate how all of you in the playtest stepped up your game compared to earlier playtests with extremely civil discourse, keeping repetitive points to a minimum so I could keep up with all the new ideas, and just really engaging with each other’s ideas and feelings in good faith to talk about different directions. </p> 
                   <p>Overall, people really liked the thaumaturge, with a strong good feeling from the majority of players, but there were definitely some areas where it needed tweaking or rethinking, usually in a way that didn’t detract much for most playtesters but did in a big way for a small number of them. This left the thaumaturge in an interesting situation, with about as many people who were about as many huge fans of the class as the highest-ranking class we’ve ever playtested, but then that small number with especially low rankings. The great news about that is that it left a clear path forward. </p> 
                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b> The one thing I wasn’t sure about was whether playtesters would like our new vision of the thaumaturge or would prefer something more similar to the first edition occultist. What I discovered is that you really like the martial thaumaturge concept, by an overwhelming majority, and want it to remain a magpie picking up from all four traditions. However, there was a desire to make it clearer how the class fantasy works with respect to exerting your force of personality to convince the universe, as well as to add more capacity to the class’s skills so that Charisma-based skills are front and center to match the intro lore about being persuasive. The changes to Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws (see below) may help with this as well to allow better advantage of your Charisma key ability score, while freeing up a broader variety of character concepts—this will let players freely choose whether to lean more heavily on magical learning or more on making things up as you go along as best fits the character. We’ll also be making a variety of quality-of-life changes based on other playtester proposals.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Implements:</b> As the playtest mentioned, we’ll be adding up to nine implements (three each granting active, reactive, and passive abilities). Of the four new implements, one of them will be the tome (or a ledger, notebook, or similar object), a passive implement that mysteriously writes down information about everything around you to assist you. The other implements are one to let you inspire and lead your allies, one to debuff your enemies, and one that misleads your enemies’ attacks, but I’ll leave it up to you to figure out what implements those might be!</p> 
                   <p><b>Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws:</b> One thing I’ve learned from these playtests is that our playtesters tend to be our most dedicated and experienced players (and even if you’re new to Pathfinder, you are very experienced with tabletop RPGs in general). So, whenever even our most experienced playtesters think a mechanic is complicated, I think I should take another look at that. People loved the benefits for these abilities but thought they were complex, and that they sometimes had issues being tied directly to Recall Knowledge. Our plan is to disentangle Esoteric Antithesis from Recall Knowledge (with a feat, like investigators’, to pick up a free Recall Knowledge if you want that), instead just flat-out forcing your will on the universe with a check to establish a connection (I’m thinking a name like “Forge Connection”). One consequence of this is that even on a failure, you can forge a connection, but a success or critical success will give you more. Additionally, while a high majority of players really liked the playtest benefit from Esoteric Antithesis, there were some good ideas about how to open up to allow a variety of benefits to allow for more playstyles. So, we’re looking at offering multiple benefits a thaumaturge can pick from when you successfully forge a connection. This separates out the benefit where you apply a creature’s highest weakness and the benefit where you create a new weakness as two options, to handle the feedback people gave about situations where they were already applying a creature’s highest weakness due to preparation for the encounter. It also allows you to gain new benefits, for instance, when you might prefer a special buff or debuff instead of simply more damage. Right now, we’re toying with the idea of having a different connection for each implement, as some folks also thought implements could use one more unique power, and then have more connections available through feats</p> 
                   <p><b>Pacts:</b> People loved the story of the pacts—in fact, they wanted them to have stronger effects, and many wanted the option for any character, even non-thaumaturges, to gain them. We had actually planned on including similar pacts in a yet-unannounced part of the book, but based on your feedback, we also expanded the pacts into a full-on pact binder archetype for anyone to take! Opinions were pretty varied about their rarity, perhaps the most mixed we’ve ever gotten in a multiple choice question for paths moving forward, so we’ll take that into account moving forward.</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <h2>A Glimpse, A Hunch, A Flicker of the Future:</h2> 
                   <p>Hey, thanks for sticking around! Here’s something coming up in <em>Dark Archive</em>—while the book is still in development and various things might change a little, I wanted to give a sneak peek into a new type of player option coming up in the cryptids file, one of the eight casefiles of the <em>Dark ArchiveM</em>.</p> 
                   <h3>Creature Echo Feats</h3> 
                   <p>Creature echoes are a new type of feat that grant you special powers based on exposure to an unusual creature. These are rare and usually only occur after a significant event involving the creature. Imagine a town where people have, one by one, begun to turn to stone. You might spend many months tracking down the cause of the phenomena, only to eventually find it was an ancient creature with a petrifying gaze living deep under the town. However your encounter with the creature goes, the following feat might echo with you if you survive:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><b>Stone Skin — Feat 12</b><br> Rare, Transmutation<br> <b>Prerequisites</b> You have been petrified.</p> 
                    <p>It might have been a medusa, dracolisk, or even a fossil golem; regardless of the source, you were the target of some petrifying effect, and an element of that stony gaze has remained with you, both protecting and slowly consuming you. Your limbs are coated with a layer of stone that rests atop your skin. You gain a stone fist unarmed attack which deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage, has the shove trait, and is in the brawling weapon group; unlike a normal fist, it does not have the agile or finesse traits. As your life force ebbs, this petrification spreads over more of your body to form a stony armor. When you have fewer than half your maximum Hit Points, your stone fist unarmed attack increases its weapon damage die from 1d8 to 1d10 and you gain resistance to physical damage equal to your Constitution modifier. </p> 
                    <p>If you would gain the dying condition, you can choose to instead be permanently petrified to avoid the risk of death. Counteracting this petrification requires a casting of <em>stone to flesh</em> of a spell level equal to at least half your level, as well as a counteract check against the hard DC for your level. Each time you recover from petrification caused in this way, you gain a new scar on your skin in the shape of a long, thin crack.</p>

                   <p>Before I go, I want to say thanks to the awesome writers whose work is featured in the book. We’re in the middle of development and I gotta say, they’ve done some strange, spooky, and brilliant work!</p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>When asked about his history with producing fantasy art like the imagery featured in these two puzzles, Reynolds said, “I have been working in the RPG industry for almost 30 years, with my first piece of art being featured in 1993.</p> 
                   <p>“I was working with Paizo when they took over Dragon and Dungeon Magazines,” Reynolds explained. “I was doing some cover art for them, so when they started Pathfinder, I was one of the first people they approached about providing art for the game.</p> 
                   <p>“It is exciting to be able to work on something from the ground level. My experience with Pathfinder has been massively enjoyable. I just love everything about that sort of world.”</p> 
                   <p>When asked about what pieces of art his personal favorites are to create, Reynolds said, “Mainly the iconic characters, as my specialty is in character design. I love being able to tie history to fantasy, and I always do a lot of historical research before beginning work on that type of a project.”</p> 
                   <p>Speaking specifically about his art being used to create jigsaw puzzle products, as well as how he thinks he’d fare putting them together himself, Reynolds said, “I like doing jigsaw puzzles. They are relaxing, and I think they also make for a good exercise as an artist. I am probably the wrong person to do a puzzle featuring my own artwork, though, because I already know the image so well.</p> 
                   <p>“I imagine it would be sort of like a musician dancing to their own music,” Reynolds added.</p> 
                   <p>Fans of Pathfinder, Wayne Reynolds, and fantasy art in general have made these jigsaw puzzle items two of Toy Vault’s most popular new offerings this year, and it is with great excitement that we announce two more brand new puzzles featuring Pathfinder imagery—<em>Gamemastery Guide and Gods &amp; Magic.</em></p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0294z?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gamemastery-Guide">Gamemastery Guide</a></em> once again showcases a wonderful piece of Reynolds art, this time depicting Alaznist, one of the game’s villains, ascending a staircase while holding onto an impressive-looking spear-type weapon in one hand. Towering above her is a large black dragon with giant horns, red eyes, and wings extended.</p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02950?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gods-Magic">Gods &amp; Magic</a></em> features work by the talented Russian artist Ekaterina Burmak. The scene depicts the Starstone near the top, with three characters below. These three characters are Cayden Cailean, Iomedae, and Norgorber, all of whom ascended to godhood after touching the Starstone, according to official Pathfinder lore.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">“Please, Dhareen, must we go through with this? A bit of rock climbing is hardly a challenge for the Castrovel Kid!” Dhareen imagined her mentee thrusting his chest out proudly, thumb pressed triumphantly above his heart as he blustered several feet below her. She smiled to herself and pushed her piston-puncher into the mountain’s side, activating the gadget with a press of her lowleft thumb.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps, but it is custom among the tribes for a Yavnii to administer a test to every hopeful Brekai wanting to undergo the Test of the Mountain, and I am afraid that not even I have the authority to make exceptions to shobhad tradition. Not even for the ‘Castrovel Kid.’”</p> 
                   <p>“See, you say that, but I can hear your grin,” Vellero replied sullenly.</p> 
                   <p>“I know not what you mean.” Dhareen grinned again.</p> 
                   <p>Both gladiators fell silent as they climbed, Dhareen pausing her ascent long enough for Vellero to scale up alongside her.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>He had taken to her tutelage well. Ka’s cliffside was grueling even for an expert; twenty-two miles long and comprised of thin basalt overtop stronger metamorphic stone, careless climbers often plummeted to their deaths after relying on pistons pounded into brittle basalt. One of the many roles of a yavnii was to ensure their breknai did not succumb to such a fate. Vellero had learned Dhareen’s lessons well thus far, scaling around several patches of basalt she had left in his path as a test.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s concentration reminded Dhareen of when she first met the headstrong lashunta in the ring at Arl’s VitariTech Coliseum. They were competing in the Icons Grand Brawl, and he was favored to win. The young man was a crowd pleaser on a seven-match winning streak. He was good, but not good enough; Dhareen scrubbed the floor with her future friend’s face. Literally. Nevertheless, there had been a spark within Vellero, a spark that intrigued her. The second time she knocked him down—or perhaps the third—he clamored to his feet with a bruised antenna and a few chipped teeth, wiped fresh blood from his lip, and grinned.</p> 
                   <p>“Why do you persist?” Dhareen had asked, scarcely winded. “You cannot win. You bring yourself only pain. Throw your towel; others have when facing me. There is no shame in surrendering to your better.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re right,” he’d replied. “But that wouldn’t be fair for the folks who came here to see me fight, and I don’t want to let a single person in this ring who believed that I could win down.” He raised his fists into a boxer’s stance, a pointless gesture against an opponent twice his size with twice as many fists. “When I go down, I want them to know I gave it my all!”</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“I don’t mean to sound indignant,” Vellero interrupted Dhareen’s thoughts. “I know that the Test of the Mountain is sacred to your people, and that it is an honor to be allowed to undergo it as an outsider.” </p> 
                   <p>Dhareen raised an eyebrow. “But?”</p> 
                   <p>“But,” Vellero took a breath. “Is the reason we’re doing this,” Vellero gestured out behind them, over red dunes and rolling clouds of dust. “Because you don’t think I can?”</p> 
                   <p>“If I didn’t think you could pass the Test of the Mountain, I wouldn’t have begun the climb with you, nor permitted you to undertake it.” Dhareen’s voice was gentle but her statement absolute. “The mountain is sacred to my people. We do not tolerate bloodshed on Ka. To send one who is unprepared up the Mountain is as shameful as slaying one’s enemies at its base.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s expression softened slightly. “Thanks.”</p> 
                   <p>“Do not speak of it. You don’t want your throat to dry from the ascent.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero blinked, then burst out laughing.</p> 
                   <p>“I don’t understand what you find so funny about that. You’ll have twenty miles left when we’ve reached the end of our shared path.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero kept laughing for a minute, wiping tears from his eyes. “Thanks, Dhareen.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re—”</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-<b>KUN.</b></em></p>

                    <h3>Dhareen reaches for a falling Vellero in this illustration by Victor Manuel Leza Moreno from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Starfinder: Galaxy Exploration Manual.</a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Dhareen gave herself no time for thinking. Before the sound of shattering basalt reached her ears, before Ka itself folded like a withered tumblefern in a windstorm, she whipped around to where Vellero was climbing even as his cliffside shifted downward, a cascade of metamorphic stone tearing free from Ka and tumbling towards the ground below. Vellero screamed as he fell, but Dhareen plucked him from the air like a corpseheron snatching a leaping spookfish out from the Irkonian Sea. Dhareen didn’t speak Ysoki, but she had spent enough time around ratfolk gladiators at VitariTech to recognize the lashunta lambasting the situation with at least six of the fourteen different Ysoki swears that she knew.</p> 
                   <p>“Hold on, Vellero!” Climbing down wasn’t an option; a rockslide was eminent, and the best place to be during a rockslide was above it. Vellero was much smaller than she and less experienced at climbing, he would only slow them down. She could climbe faster with all four of her muscled arms free, anyway. There was only one option remaining. </p> 
                   <p>Hoisting the Castrovel Kid onto her shoulders like a mother giving a youngling a backride, she placed the much smaller lashunta onto her shoulders and started climbing as fast as she could, giving only the barest of warnings. “Hold tight!”</p> 
                   <p>Though Dhareen could hear Vellero shouting, her intense focus and the earsplitting sounds of portions of the rock wall sloughing off afforded her no opportunity to comprehend him. She climbed as quick as her body would allow, muscles aching and flaring as she abandoned her piston-punch and climbed barehanded. She knew full-well that the smallest mistake would send both she and her friend to their doom.</p> 
                   <p>Ten yards from the top.</p> 
                   <p>Five.</p> 
                   <p>She was going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>She and Vellero were going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>Then her world shook as shadow overtook her vision. A boulder dislodged from above, tumbling towards her, threatening to crack her skull and send Dhareen and her breknai tumbling miles to their death. She refused to close her eyes; she would greet the Lady of Graves with firsthand tales of how she died. She was not alone; at the peak of her vision, she saw a small lashunta arm, no bigger than that of a shobhad child’s, reach out as if to catch the boulder. Dhareen admired Vellero’s bravery one last time.</p> 
                   <p>The boulder collided with Vellero, and for a moment it was like watching a diver plunge into a serene pool. Vellero’s hand, then his arm, and then both their bodies plunged into the boulder. </p> 
                   <p><em>Was it just an illusion?</em></p> 
                   <p>Fine dust covered Dhareen as the boulder passed through her. From within, she watched the metamorphic rock splinter and crack in flight, first into smaller boulders, then into stone and pebbles, and finally into dust. The boulder never touched them; it dissolved before it even struck the Castrovel Kid’s hand.</p> 
                   <p>Dhareen was stunned at first. But with safety just a few yards above and Ka continuing to shake and splinter, the feeling passed quickly as she bellowed at her peculiar friend.</p> 
                   <p>“That, Vellero! Keep doing that!”</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">On the occasion of Transgender Awareness Week, we at Paizo want to reaffirm our support for our transgender colleagues, creators, and community members. We recognize that we've not always been there for our trans community members. While things are rough now, we as a company are dedicated to improving and providing a safe space for all gamers—especially trans gamers—to play, create, and be part of a thriving community where they are not only welcomed but celebrated.</p> 
                   <p>We felt that this year, we shouldn’t place additional emotional labor upon our trans staff, creators, and community to contribute to a blog for Trangender Awareness Week. Rather, we wanted to address the issue of transphobia on our forums.</p> 
                   <p>Many members of the community have noted a high amount of homophobic and transphobic posts recently. Let us be clear: these hateful posts are not okay under any circumstances, and those who make them will be faced with <b>permanent suspension</b> from the forums. Though our customer service department is doing their best to keep watch and address moderation flags, it’s clear that the volume of moderation needed on the forums in the last few months has meant that the team sometimes takes more time than usual to moderate a thread. </p> 
                   <p>Transphobia is serious and removing it from the forums should take precedence over other more routine moderation tasks. Therefore, if you need to report transphobia on the forums, please don’t hesitate to contact customer service directly by email at customer.service@paizo.com with INTOLERANCE in the subject line. Any such hate will be dealt with swiftly and incur a permanent suspension.</p> 
                   <p>While we realize that combatting discrimination is an ongoing process and this is only a small step, we hope that it can begin to make our community forums a place where all members of our community feel welcome, and more importantly, safe.</p> 
                   <p>Thank you to our trans community members and other allies who have pushed us to be better recently. We hear you, we value you, and we will continue to improve ourselves, our games, and our community to earn back the trust we’ve lost. It’s hard to admit that we haven’t been living up to our values, but it’s the right thing to do, and we can’t move forward without doing so.</p> 
                   <p>Please also consider donating to nonprofits benefiting and supporting the trans community—members of our staff recommend <a href="http://www.tgijp.org/" target="_blank">TGI Justice Project</a> and <a href="https://ingersollgendercenter.org/">Ingersoll Gender Center</a>, though there are many great organizations doing the work that would value your contribution.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Over the last six weeks, Paizo's Leadership Team has attempted to better listen to and understand the challenges faced by its workforce, customers, and community. We want to take a moment to update you on a few important developments that have emerged from those conversations.</p> 
                   <p>Before we begin, it's important to note that this update does not address requests regarding salaries, adjustments to the current work-from-home environment, or other matters that are now subject to negotiation with the United Paizo Workers union during collective bargaining.</p> 
                   <p>We’re still searching diligently for a candidate to fill the company’s Human Resources Manager position, and plan to begin interviews very shortly. As this is an incredibly important hire, we want to make sure we find the right candidate with experience leading initiatives related to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) and working with a union. We are continuing to gather resumes as the search continues.</p> 
                   <p>We’ve hired a company called <a href="https://www.energage.com/" target="_blank">Energage</a> to complete an employee engagement survey on behalf of Paizo. This survey is designed to allow employees to provide anonymous, unfiltered, and honest feedback to the company that will help Paizo establish priorities for improvement planning. It will also serve as an important benchmark against which to measure the results of future surveys, allowing us to develop a baseline to measure against. We expect employees to be able to access the engagement survey sometime this week.</p> 
                   <p>Discussion in the past several months has resurfaced two instances in which a Paizo executive mishandled user data when replying to message board posts, resulting in allegations of doxxing. These actions were contrary to Paizo policy, and corrective actions were taken to ensure that this does not happen again.</p> 
                   <p>“This was a huge mistake on my part and I am deeply sorry for any issues that have arisen from these actions. This was not the right way to treat our customers and I apologize,” said Paizo President Jeff Alvarez. “As President, I know I need to hold myself to a higher standard.”</p> 
                   <p>Paizo takes issues related to discrimination and harassment very seriously. We have hired the law firm of <a href="https://www.moritthock.com/" target="_blank">Moritt Hock &amp; Hamroff</a> (MH&amp;H) to investigate allegations of discrimination against trans employees and sexual misconduct before reporting back to the Leadership Team. Investigators from the firm will reach out to members of Paizo’s staff and others that made claims on social media. Cooperation with the firm is voluntary, of course, but we remain committed to investigating these matters thoroughly to ensure a safe and respectful workplace.</p> 
                   <p>We chose MH&amp;H upon the recommendation of a consultant with expertise in matters of DEIB. MH&amp;H has a team of attorneys that specialize in these issues, and we’re confident they’ll be able to provide an impartial analysis of the facts that we need to move forward with any corrective actions.</p> 
                   <p>Because the results of these investigations are private personnel matters, Paizo will not be able to make them public. Corrective actions will be taken against any employee (including managers and executives) found to be guilty of these allegations. </p> 
                   <p>It has never been Paizo’s intention to discriminate against any employee when making decisions of who to send to industry trade shows, but we see now that our room-sharing policy was based on outdated interpretations of gender, was not friendly to transgender employees, and could contribute to a perception of transphobia at the company. Paizo’s Leadership Team acknowledges the pain this caused, and we understand that we need to be better at recognizing issues where such decisions could have unintended results. We also recognize that such actions do not align with Paizo's core values, the values of its staff members, or the sentiments of diversity and inclusion expressed in Paizo products, and as such, have disappointed, angered, and confused members of our community. We believe these mistakes are not representative of who we are, or what we want the company to represent. We need to do better... and we will. </p> 
                   <p>“As the person in charge of trade shows, I want to apologize to anyone that felt marginalized as a result of the convention decision-making process,” said Jeff Alvarez. “It was not our intent to discriminate against anyone, and I’m sorry.”</p> 
                   <p>As previously communicated, Paizo has adopted a one-employee-per-room travel policy moving forward. Regardless of gender identity, couples will be allowed to share rooms during travel as long as both parties request it. </p> 
                   <p>Paizo remains committed to maintaining a diverse, safe, and fun workplace where our employees are treated fairly and look forward to creating awesome Pathfinder and Starfinder products for many years to come. We hope that this update helps communicate that we, the Leadership Team, are doing our best to listen to and address the concerns of our community members. We believe in creating a better Paizo, and believe that transparency, communication, and accountability will be instrumental as we move forward. Thank you for your continued support of our company and our products.</p>

                   <p>Take heed, Pathfinders! Court is in session, and the Pathfinder Society itself is on trial! Recently, the Church of Iomedae in Almas, the capital of Andoran, made a legal claim against the Society’s lodge. The Almas Cathedral, once a Cathedral of Aroden, came into Venture-Captain Brackett’s possession during an especially tumultuous time for the church of Aroden, but he insists that his claim to the building is legitimate. Unfortunately, it seems the People’s Council has begun to question whether the Society’s prominence in the city is more trouble than it’s worth. The Pathfinders will need to be at their best if they’re going to sway the Council, as the Church of Iomedae has sent a formidable representative to make their case.</p> 
                   <p>With the chilling events of the recent East Hill haunting behind them, the Pathfinders should finally be able to focus their full attention on the legal case.</p> 
                   <p>Surely nothing else bad will happen before the trial.</p> 
                   <p>Or during the trial.</p> 
                   <p>Surely not.</p>

It’s the second scenario in a two-part Andoran metaplot arc for the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. To experience the full story in order, you’ll want to play <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-302-The-East-Hill-Haunting"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-02: The East Hill Haunting</em></a> first.

                   <h3>Michael Sayre, Paizo Designer (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Growing up, my grandpa’s Tlingit stories showed me how storytelling works as a vehicle for culture and values (and how it’s a great way to pass the time waiting for the fish to bite!) Those stories of kushtaka and little men in the woods excited me, and I remember hanging on my grandpa’s every word, realizing how his cadences and storytelling devices had been passed to my uncles, who would use the same rhythm even for different stories, which were all so hypnotic and mesmerizing. I remember the elders at the rec center and other events who would tell stories I’d never heard before but which were still so familiar.</p> 
                   <p>Stories of Raven helped me contextualize the cleverness and skill of Tlingit elders and leaders in a modern environment, and I’d only continue to discover the value and power of some of those stories as I grew older. Stories about Bear (both ally and obstacle) helped me realize how strong people can be when I thought that people, especially me, were just weak and flawed. All of those stories and experiences helped make me realize that I wanted to tell stories of my own. Gunalchèesh ax eet yeelatûowu.</p> 
                   <p>Taking the first steps to telling those stories never would have happened without the support of Goldbelt, our tribal corporation, that assisted me on numerous occasions with education and health care related issues that would have forced different life choices if I’d had to navigate them without a corporation representing a rich tapestry of communities supporting me. What I am, all the Tlingit &amp; Haida people of southeast Alaska helped me be.</p>

                   <h3>Jessica Catalan, Paizo Developer (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica Catalan (she/her), and I’m a Canadian, Métis freelancer author and Starfinder Line Developer for the Starfinder Society. This year, Canada held its first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, an annual commemoration honoring the children who died while attending residential schools and the survivors, families, and communities still affected by the legacy of the residential school system. While this is a step forward for us, reconciliation without action is just words and there is much to be done. I’ll spare you the newscast. </p> 
                   <p>I’m not much of a speaker, but as many of us have realized over the past two years, while one voice can be silenced, together we are strong, and we can be heard. So, in addition to raising my voice and lending my support to Every Child Matters, MMIWG2S, and other movements here in Canada, I can take two concrete steps I’d like to mention today: reclamation and amplification.</p> 
                   <p>Today, I’m here to amplify. I encourage you to look at the other names on this blog—check out their works, support them on ko-fi or patreon, back and purchase their projects, follow them on social media. Hear them. Keep an eye out for other Indigenous works, such as <em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em>, and support the people involved. And if you’re an Indigenous TTRPG author who loves Starfinder and is struggling to have your voice heard, reach out to me. I’m listening. </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Carlos Cabrera, Paizo Contributor (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi there, my name is Carlos Cabrera. I am mixed, but I identify as Mexican, Indigenous (Mescalero Apache), and Cape Verde (Portuguese and African). At first, I was going to write something for both Hispanic Heritage Month and Native American Heritage Month, but when I started looking into my family history—closer than I ever have before—I had to take some time for myself. The facts were not very pretty, and history was not kind to my family as early as either grandparent on my father’s side.</p> 
                   <p>I also grew up in a white household. My mother's family comes from a variety of European countries, and even a little Cherokee as history also likes to dictate. There are other idiosyncrasies there as well, but I recognize that my upbringing comes with a certain amount of privilege. Earlier this year, I wrote to the Mescalero Apache Reservation to see if my family had any affiliation. My relief when I discovered they were not was short-lived. The facts of how my family avoided that were not any prettier.</p> 
                   <p>I think that is why I pledged a copy of the <em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em> RPG to the reservation and continue to write to this day. I hope it inspires someone to either get into games or go on their own grand adventure, even if they don't have the luxury of walking out their front door like I did. Maybe one day I can even pay them. I think that would be my American Dream.</p>

                   <h3>Shay Snow, Paizo Editor (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>Kúha’ahat, táy:sha’! I’m Shay Snow and I’m mixed Native American. My family stems from two separate tribes—my mother’s tribe is Caddo and my father’s tribe is Swampy Cree. Both tribes have strong matriarchal ties, so when introducing myself I lead with my mother’s tribe and then follow-up with my father’s tribe. I can’t speak on being just a Native TTRPG creator, but I can speak on being a Caddo and Swampy Cree creator.</p> 
                   <p>Being a Caddo creator means crafting your words carefully, knowing that your language is dying. Being a Caddo creator means trying to take all of the nuance of your language, the humor, the care, the cadence that warms your heart and makes you want to move when it’s spoken, and trying to put it into a language that your family was forced to adopt and speak. Being a Caddo creator means trying to find rhythm and when you can’t find it, forcing that rhythm into your work so that hopefully your words make other people want to move and dance.</p> 
                   <p>Being a Swampy Cree creator means moving slowly through the minefield that is your history and trying to pluck the safe bits out so that your heritage doesn’t accidentally cause you pain. Being a Swampy Cree creator means knowing that some parts of your culture have been taken and commodified and it’s now on your shoulders to look at those spirits and offer your respect as you try to carefully tell their stories without causing danger or harm. </p> 
                   <p>Being a Native creator in 2021 has meant creating and crafting with careful words and tools while also being painfully aware of everything pouring into the news and media over the past year. It means writing and trying to bring joy while burning sweetgrass and mourning over loved ones lost recently and loved ones lost long ago and recently found.</p> 
                   <p>My name is Shay Snow, I live on unceded Caddo and Wichita land, and my family calls me Little Jay.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <p><b>To all members of our community with indigenous heritage: thank you for all you do as creators, GMs, players, and people.</b></p>

(Pregenerated characters for this adventure are also available as a <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/PZOSF1002E+The+Great+Grav+Train+Robbery+Pregens.pdf">free download</a>.) If players create their own characters, they can use the adventure background to customize their characters to the adventure. This adventure can be easily used on virtual tabletops, run off digital devices, or printed out and played at a table.</p>

                   <p>The boss recruited a ragtag band of miscreants for this job, all of them active players in Pan’s criminal underworld for some time. They consider themselves independent contractors and are already familiar with each other by reputation, if not by personal experience. While each has their own reasons for taking up a life of crime, they all share one thing in common: animosity toward the Ixo Syndicate, which means the opportunity to rob them is almost as tempting as the payday.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/86b7da87-5041-46c3-8b9f-332e98285483/PZOSF1002E_TheGreatGravTrainRobberyAdventure.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/86b7da87-5041-46c3-8b9f-332e98285483/PZOSF1002E_TheGreatGravTrainRobberyAdventure.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Starfinder Adventure The Great Grav Train Robbery: 4 characters repel down to the top of a train in the dark of the night"></a>

                   <h4>Jenny Jarzabski</h4> Jenny Jarzabski is a Developer at Paizo. She’s also a prolific freelance writer creating adventures, rules, and setting content for <em>Pathfinder, Starfinder,</em> and more. Jenny is passionate about anime, games, mechs, and all things sci-fi. Growing up, she was the weird kid who made up stories and created her own imaginary world. She never grew out of it. When Jenny isn’t developing or writing adventures, she builds models, plays outdoors, and sometimes streams on Twitch. She appeared in Paizo’s “Pungeon Crawl: Worlds Beyond” and “Mind the Gap” as Z, an astrazoan operative and vidgame addict. Starting this week, she’s joining Thurston Hillman to play Modiphius Entertainment’s Dune TTRPG (hosted on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/oncallgm">twitch.tv/oncallgm</a>) and plans to launch her own Starfinder live play in 2022. Rumors that Jenny is an alien life form are still unconfirmed.

                   <h4>GM: Thurston Hillman</h4> 
                   <p>Thurston Hillman hails from the frozen hinterlands of Winnipeg, Manitoba, where he constantly churns out words and runs tabletop games. In addition to being Paizo's Digital Developer, he was active in the creation of the Starfinder Society Organized Play program and outlined its first two seasons (including the well-received Scoured Stars storyline). Thurston has written countless products for Paizo and other companies as a freelance writer. He is the Gamemaster for the popular "Warhams" TTRPG comedy show on Twitch. You can find him on social media @oncallgm and over at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/oncallgm">twitch.tv/oncallgm</a> where he sometimes streams his RPG sessions and talks about game design and narrative in games. Also, he apologizes for any Organized Play scenarios he developed that killed your character (seriously, he means it!)</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Greetings, Starfinders! Earlier this year we announced that Fame would be going away, and this naturally prompted a number of questions. We’ve combed through the ensuing discussions and we’re here today to present answers!

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, Starfinders! Earlier this year we announced that Fame would be going away, and this naturally prompted a number of questions. We’ve combed through the ensuing discussions and we’re here today to present answers! Many of these will be added to the Starfinder Society FAQ pages or other locations as appropriate, but I wanted to consolidate them all in one place as a reference.</p> 
                   <h3>Conversion of Fame to AcP</h3> 
                   <p>Let’s start with the big one. When we announced this transition, we promised we’d get a way to convert your unspent fame to Achievement Points.</p> 
                   <p>We’re not doing that.</p> 
                   <p>Instead, we are outright stealing adopting what I refer to as “The HMM Proposal.” <b>Every Starfinder session played prior to May 31, 2021 will retroactively award 2 Achievement Points to both players and GMs.</b> This is the simplest way to handle this, as well as the fairest. It prevents headaches, having to dig out old Chronicle Sheets, and look, it’s just a really clean system, why mess with a great idea?</p> 
                   <p>Yes, it technically rewards the players who spent all their Fame, but those players are also our most invested players. Personally, I’m cool with them getting a little extra.</p> 
                   <p>These points should be awarded no later than <b>next Friday, the 12th</b>. If you notice old SFS sessions that aren’t awarding Achievement Points after that, please email orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com and I’ll take a look!</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3248759d-7414-446b-b50b-bd2c7f7bdc33/031121_TrainBattle.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3248759d-7414-446b-b50b-bd2c7f7bdc33/031121_TrainBattle.jpg" width="75%" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="The Starfinder Society fights off deadly robots on top of a speeding train"></a>

                   <br> 
                   <h2>Other General Questions</h2> 
                   <h3>Changing Quest Pack Reporting</h3> 
                   <p>One weird wrinkle we came across was because quest packs can be completed across multiple sessions, a player could end up with more Achievement Points than anticipated. As a result, I’m going to add some extra reporting options for Starfinder Quests.</p> 
                   <p>If you complete all four parts of a quest pack in one session, reporting won’t change for that. However, if you only complete some of the quests, you will now be able to report each segment individually and it will award the correct amount of Achievement Points. Again, this will be in place by next Friday; there’s no need to retroactively correct old sessions, but if you see any issues, email orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com!</p> 
                   <h3>Unapplied Fame</h3> 
                   <p>Any Fame that has been earned but not yet applied (e.g., from an Adventure or playing a pregen at a higher level) must be applied and spent by December 31. As Fame cannot be spent after that date, any unapplied and unspent Fame will be lost.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Boon-Specific Questions</h2> 
                   <p>In addition to general questions, there were a few questions that came up about specific boons that required Fame to function. Be aware there are some scenario spoilers in this section!</p> 
                   <h3>Inequity in Faction Boons</h3> 
                   <p>Currently, some Factions have more boons available for purchase in the online boon store than others; in particular, the Second Seeker factions are a little light. It is our intention to fill in the gaps in the matrix as the developers have time to create new boons.</p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder of Note</h3> 
                   <p>The Starfinder of Note boon has not yet been added to the Achievement Points system. At this time, we will not be adding the boon back, simply because we do not currently have any definite plans to use the submissions in future products. If and when we decide to bring back fan submissions (e.g., if we need a new First Seeker or similar), we’ll look at bringing back the boon. Any past submissions are still on file, and should the boon make a return, those submissions will also be considered.</p> 
                   <h3>Instructor Boon (Luwazi Elsebo/Ehu Hadif)</h3> 
                   <p>The current text of the Instructor boon for Ehu Hadif in the Achievement Points system is as follows:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">You dedicate some of your time off to training an up-and-coming Starfinder recruit. This boon represents time spent outside of adventuring that you’re taking to train a potential new Starfinder. At the end of every adventure you have this boon slotted, record the total amount of Reputation you earned with the Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif). You can expend your Downtime at the end of an adventure to increase the boxes marked off for this boon by 1. Once you have accrued 40 marked boxes with this boon, your student has come into their own and is ready to become a full-fledged Starfinder (a new character). Have your GM mark the Chronicle Sheet where you accomplished this, and keep a copy of this boon with your new character. When your new character reaches 5th level, instead of choosing four ability scores to increase, you can choose five. Otherwise you follow all other rules for leveling up. This bonus applies only at 5th level.</p> 
                    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Special: You can apply this boon only to one new character, and only once the objectives have been completed.</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <p>The same text should be used for the Luwazi Elsebo iteration going forward.</p> 
                   <h3>Lone Agent</h3> 
                   <p>The Lone Agent boon was a convention reward that allowed you to convert Reputation earned into an immediate discount on a Fame boon purchase. After December 31, 2021, <b>this boon will no longer function</b>. We tried to keep the list of boons that outright would not work small, and in this case converting it would require a full rewrite. Our apologies to Lone Agent fans.</p> 
                   <h3>SFS 1-01: The Commencement</h3> 
                   <p>Change the text of the Faction’s Friend boon to the following:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">By assisting various factions of the Starfinder Society, you have proven yourself as a dependable asset. By slotting this boon, if you would fail to earn Reputation at the end of an adventure by failing to fulfill a success condition, you can check one of the boxes on this boon. Doing so reminds your current championed faction of your past exploits, and you still earn 1 Reputation with that faction as if you had successfully fulfilled the condition. You can use this boon only if you would also gain at least 1 XP for completing the adventure.</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <h3>SFS 1-14: Star Sugar Heartlove!</h3> 
                   <p>Change the Scoured Stars Memorial boon’s text to the following:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Thanks to your efforts on Songbird Station, the Starfinder Society earned immense publicity from the Strawberry Machine Cake concert. Organizations and people across the Pact Worlds now go out of their way to assist the Starfinder Society. You can check the box next to this boon to do one of the following:</p> 
                    <ul> 
                     <li style="font-family:'Courier New'">Ignore the Achievement Point cost of having your body recovered.</li> 
                     <li style="font-family:'Courier New'">Ignore the Achievement Point cost of purchasing the Starship Towing boon.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Checking this box does not require purchase of the relevant boon via the Achievement Points system.</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <h3>SFS 1-38: The Many Minds of Historia</h3> 
                   <p>The Steadfast Protector boon will be added to the Chronicle Boons section of the online boon store. It will require completion of SFS 1-38, as well as Tier 3 Reputation (25+ Reputation) with the Exo-Guardians and will cost 8 Achievement Points. The version listed on this Chronicle Sheet will cease to be purchasable as of December 31, 2021, though its benefits may still be used by characters that have already spent the required Fame.</p> 
                   <h3>SFS 2-16: A Scoured Home</h3> 
                   <p>Change the last sentence of the Nuclear Tools boon to the following:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">If you are not an izalguun, you may perform the same upgrade by spending an additional 10% of the cost of the upgrade (1,650 UPBs) to work with an izalguun Starfinder.</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <p>We hope this answers all the outstanding questions about the transition away from Fame for Starfinder Society! If you have any questions about these changes or any other topics we missed, please let us know in the comments.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And go spend your new Achievement Points!</p>

                   <p>Back when I was hired, which the calendar insists was only 20 months ago, I expected to be traveling a lot more than I have so far. I will admit the introverted, awkward part of me (that’s all of me) is glad I met the community online, where I’m much funnier and able to log off when I need to. Still, there’s something about physical gaming that I’ve missed, the energy is different online (but the prep’s a lot easier, so it’s a trade-off)!</p> 
                   <p>Hopefully in 2022 I’ll be able to attend more shows and meet more people in-person, but I suspect the landscape has changed in ways we can’t expect. Until then, I look forward to more online games with all of you!</p> 
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available November 19, 2021:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ako?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-305-Inheritors-Rite">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-05: Inheritor's Rite*</a><br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02al0?Pathfinder-Bounty-16-Boom-Town-Betrayal">Pathfinder Bounty #16: Boom Town Betrayal</a></p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akt?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-411-A-Worlds-Ambition">Starfinder Society Scenario #4-11: A World's Ambition*</a></p> 
                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <h2>Starfinder Society Fame Updates</h2> 
                   <p>Earlier this year, we announced that Starfinder Society would be transitioning to the Achievement Points system, and that Fame would be disappearing. This sparked several questions to which we promised answers.</p> 
                   <p>Good news, I have answers for you! But you’ll have to wait a little longer for them. There’s a second blog scheduled later today that’s dedicated entirely to that topic, to keep everything in one place. So, hang tight and we’ll circle back to this topic later!</p> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>First, the bad news: I have no new rulebook content to share with you at this time. I know everybody is eager to get their hands on guns, gears, and everything for sale in the Grand Bazaar, but we simply haven’t had the time to take a look at it yet. It’s the top of our priority list once the schedule crunch lets up, we promise.</p> 
                   <p>Now, while we don’t have rules content for you, we do have some newly sanctioned adventures! For Pathfinder (second edition), <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027o0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Night-of-the-Gray-Death"><em>Night of the Gray Death</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02anr/discuss?Pathfinder-OneShot-3-Head-Shot-the-Rot"><em>Head-Shot the Rot</em></a> are both sanctioned for play. You can find the sanctioning documents on their product pages. For Starfinder, we’ll have the next one-shot, <em>The Great Grav-Train Robbery</em>, sanctioned by the time it releases.</p> 
                   <p>And finally, for our Pathfinder (first edition) players, the <a href="https://paizo.com/wrathOfTheRighteous">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> is now sanctioned for play! We know it’s been a long time coming; we tried to get it out at the same time the Owlcat game released, but the best laid plans of ysoki and men, etc, etc. The chronicles for this AP can be applied to a character of <em>any</em> level as well!</p> 
                   <p>My goal is that by this time next month, we’ll have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar</em></a> sanctioned... just in time for the December releases! Hooray!</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM reach their fifth star for Pathfinder Society (first edition) and one reach their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star</b>: Jason Thuel<br> <b>5th Nova</b> Stephan V</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Nhalmika Ironsight ran through the fresh snow. It wasn’t that much snow—it wouldn’t reach higher than mid-shin on a human—but it was higher than Nhalmika’s knees. And there’s a big difference, she now knew, between running through snow below your knees and running through snow above them. But she nevertheless ran on, hefting her scattergun to keep it free of moisture that might foul the firing mechanism. Most humans would find the large gun to be far too heavy, but Nhalmika carried it with practiced ease. So perhaps there was a fair tradeoff somehow.</p> 
                   <p>Yesterday, she’d come into the village of Ivlanton to the sound of cheers. The village was deep in Irrisen, the land of perpetual winter. Frostbite and privation were as omnipresent as the snow. Ivlanton sorely needed blankets, firewood, and medicine.</p> 
                   <p>A caravan master in Lod had sent a cartload of these goods to Ivlanton. When it didn’t return, he asked Nhalmika to investigate. At first, the master had praised Nhalmika’s son, an upright merchant with whom he’d done business, but Nhalmika wouldn’t venture deeper into Irrisen on familial pride alone. The master then offered a generous payment, but Nhalmika still refused. She was from the far south, and this wintry land was unfamiliar to her. She’d intended to move on quickly to warmer Varisia. But when the master talked about the difficulties the villagers would face if the goods hadn’t reached them, Nhalmika agreed to go. She couldn’t let innocent people suffer just because she didn’t like snow. She took the offered coin, too, and spent it on a hand-pulled wagon with still more blankets and medicine. If she couldn’t find the missing goods, she didn’t want to reach Ivlanton empty-handed.</p> 
                   <p>It turned out she needn’t have worried. She found the cart a few miles from Ivlanton, pulled off the road. Anyone else might have missed it, but the dead teamster’s baldric buckle gleamed in the deep shadows of the snowy hedge, bright as a beacon to Nhalmika’s keen eyes. The horses were nowhere to be seen. She saw that bandits had plainly pawed through the wagon, but they’d left the blankets and firewood behind. “Disappointed in their mundane haul, no doubt,” she muttered. Nhalmika prepared a hasty cairn for the unfortunate teamster and doubled up the load in her wagon to bring the lot to Ivlanton.</p> 
                   <p>The villagers were pleased, to be sure, but the village seer, an elderly and kind woman named Gerthanna, told Nhalmika that something had been stolen from the wagon after all: a small, magical flask that produced an endless stream of fresh water. In a land where water froze solid all year round, ready access to fresh water was vital.</p> 
                   <p>“I know bandits,” Nhalmika said assuredly, “and I know how to put them into the dirt…that is, the snow, I suppose,” she finished with faltering confidence. She paused to consider, but only for a moment. “I’ll go after them, and I’ll bring back your magic flask.”</p> 
                   <p>Nhalmika backtracked to the ransacked cart to look for tracks. Amid her own boot prints and the hoofprints of the departed horses, she discovered several heavy footprints, each a cross between an animal’s paw and an unshod human foot. Snowfall largely concealed the tracks, but Nhalmika was a little disappointed in herself to have missed them the first time. Even good eyes get old, she thought.</p> 
                   <p>The tracks led away from the trail and up a nearby hill. That’s where she found the remains of the horses, brutally torn to pieces. Clearly, something had feasted on great chunks of their meat. “Well, at least a well-fed enemy is a sluggish enemy,” Nhalmika mused, following the tracks as the hills led into a series of steep canyons. They looked like the box canyons of home: winding, dangerous, and the perfect place for an ambush. She readied her scattergun and shifted her cloak to access her powder and shot more easily. Then she stopped to think.</p> 
                   <p>The paw-footed bandits entered this canyon but didn’t leave it. That meant they’d either gone to hide inside or they were waiting in ambush. Either way, she could get a better look from above. Nhalmika scrambled up the canyon wall and made her way around its lip, crouching low</p> 
                   <p>Near the end of the box canyon, Nhalmika spied an elaborate ice sculpture, resembling a cresting wave with spines like icicles jutting every which way. It looked like some sort of symbol, but one that twisted away from her scrutiny as if she weren’t welcome to understand it. She recognized it as a fiendish rune—and a powerful one at that—wrought entirely from ice. An open metal flask resting atop the sculpture spouted a stream of water that quickly froze to slush and then to ice.</p> 
                   <p>Six hulking bandits worked around the ice sculpture, shaping the water as it froze to form the enormous rune. At first, Nhalmika thought they were dressed in ragged hides, but she soon observed that the patchy hides grew from their skin and claws sprouted from their hands and bare feet. They wore nothing other than blood-stained rags. The burly animal people were working with a definite purpose, and fear struck somewhere deep in Nhalmika’s soul.</p> 
                   <p>A low growl behind her made Nhalmika gasp in surprise. She’d been so focused on the rune-shaping bandits that she’d forgotten her earliest training: “a vanguard must look in all directions at once.” She glanced behind her.</p> 
                   <p>An enormous bear glared at Nhalmika from only a dozen yards away. Yet it wasn’t the bear’s hostile stare or aggressive posture that drew her gaze. The bear wore a harness of iron chains supporting a massive mirror atop its back. The mirror stood upright, reflecting Nhalmika’s puzzled expression as she perched at the canyon’s edge. </p> 
                   <p>“I am never going to understand Irrisen,” Nhalmika sighed as she swung her scattergun around to point at the bear. Before she could scare the bear off, the mirror blazed with bright inner light. The light coalesced into a beam of energy that lanced out toward Nhalmika. She sidestepped the blast, but the mirror immediately started to glow again, as though preparing for another beam. The bear howled in anger, and the roar was answered by the bandits in the chasm. Even as distracted as they were, they couldn’t have missed the bright beam.</p> 
                   <p>“Well, you shot first. My turn now.” Nhalmika fired at the bear’s head. Her shot might as well have struck stone. The bear hardly flinched, then took two paces, closing in on her. Nhalmika’s hands worked automatically as the scattergun recoiled, loading another round as she used the gun’s momentum to swing it back around in an arc to fire again. The bear ignored the second hit, and its mirror glowed even brighter. While her practiced fingers reloaded again, Nhalmika glanced around for options.</p> 
                   <p>“That flashy weapon’s the trouble, my furry friend. I can’t let you keep it.” She fired her third round at the mirror, expecting an explosion of glass and metal, but the shot rebounded from the mirror’s surface without a scratch. The scattergun was growing hot in Nhalmika’s hands, but she smoothly loaded it once again.</p> 
                   <p>“I guess this is hurting me more than it’s hurting you. I don’t have any more time for this.” Nhalmika aimed her scattergun at the snow and leapt from the top of the cliff. She pulled the trigger and the recoil propelled her even higher. Another energy blast shot across the snow where she’d been only a second ago. She had to admit the bear’s aim was good. Especially for a bear.</p>

                   <p>Nhalmika could see the beast bandits looking up at her. She reached the top of her arc and descended into the canyon. Her trajectory was taking her down to the wicked ice sculpture, where its prongs and spikes would impale her before she ever got close to the howling bandits’ claws. She swung her scattergun around as she fell and pulled the trigger.</p> 
                   <p>For a split second, she wasn’t certain she’d reloaded after launching herself from the cliff. But her fingers knew their work and had reloaded in mid-air without any conscious direction. The round exploded from the barrel and slammed into the sculpture, shattering the frozen rune into a spray of icicles. Nhalmika reached out and snatched the flask as she completed her fall.</p> 
                   <p>The bandits were bloodied from the ice fragments but didn’t seem to notice in their rage. Nhalmika could now see their faces up close, and she wished she couldn’t; they were twisted masses of animalistic snouts and snaggled teeth beneath hate-filled red eyes. Nhalmika hit the snow, rolled, and sprung to her feet. Having survived the fall, she had to grudgingly admit that maybe snow was good for something after all.</p> 
                   <p>Seriously outnumbered and worried she’d see that strange energy-mirror bear lean over the canyon rim, Nhalmika ran. Her legs pumped furiously, but the snow was too deep for her to traverse quickly. Her benevolent thoughts toward snow only a few moments ago evaporated quickly and entirely.</p> 
                   <p>The bandits—being significantly taller than she was—were having much less trouble. They roared and howled as they ran after her, closing in as Nhalmika reached the opening to the canyon. The wounds the bandits had suffered from the explosion were already almost completely healed. Nhalmika still didn’t know what they were, but right now she would have traded them for a whole pack of Mana Waste mutants. Preferably slower ones.</p> 
                   <p>At the mouth of the canyon, Nhalmika stopped and turned. She wasn’t going to escape, and she wasn’t going to survive, but she might take a couple of the monstrous bandits down before they overwhelmed her. At least some of these brutes would have eaten their last horse! She aimed at the bandit in the middle of the pack and fired.</p> 
                   <p>Nhalmika’s scattergun emitted a strange clunk and a gout of fire from the barrel. In a horrifying second, she’d realized what had happened. She’d reloaded by instinct again, but this time she’d had the small magical flask in her other hand. She hadn’t put a round in the gun; she’d loaded the flask in there instead, without realizing it until now.</p> 
                   <p>But now was too late. The flask rocketed from the scattergun’s barrel and struck the central bandit in the face. The impact caused a geyser of water to drench all the bandits at once. Before Nhalmika could even lower her gun, the water became slush, then froze solid. The bandits were trapped.</p> 
                   <p>Nhalmika took a few cautious steps forward. When she saw the bandits couldn’t burst free of their icy prison, she took a few more steps, then quickly scooped up the flask from the snow. To her surprise, it was still intact. And it wasn’t even cold!</p> 
                   <p>“You’ve been a lot of trouble,” she said to the flask in a gentle, chiding tone. “I’m getting you to Ivlanton, then I’m walking south, and I’m not stopping until I can’t see a single snowflake.”</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">They all agreed that it was Ak’s fault. Poog, Reta Bigbad, Mogmurch, Chuffy Lickwound, even Mogmurch’s toad Amfibier agreed—in a gravelly voice that sounded nothing at all like Mogmurch muttering through closed lips. Ak had been the first to climb into the back of the wagon, and so the other four goblins had no choice but to follow him, only to become trapped when the longshanks and his two terrible horses had arrived, forcing them to cower under a tarpaulin as the wagon rolled into... a human village? The sounds and smells were inconclusive. </p> 
                   <p>“Didn’t want to,” Ak said mournfully. “Reta said she would bash me if didn’t.”</p> 
                   <p>Reta smacked the other goblin hard across the back of the head. “Was a test!” she snapped. “You coward enough to go just because I tell you? Weak, Ak. We all <em>very</em> disappointed.”</p> 
                   <p>The other three goblins, and Amfibier, all muttered in agreement. It was not the first time Ak had disappointed them all, and it would surely not be the last. After a few moments, the muttering trailed off into awkward silence.</p> 
                   <p>“What do we do now?” Mogmurch said in a harsh whisper. “Longshanks gone. Don’t hear horses. Maybe it’s safe outside, maybe good time to flee.”</p> 
                   <p>“Yes, maybe,” said Reta. “Ak. You go outside, check and see if it’s safe to come out.”</p> 
                   <p>Ak looked warily into his companion’s faces, his eyes narrowed. “This also a test? If I go outside, I fail again, Reta hit me?”</p> 
                   <p>“No,” Chuffy responded. He pulled a jagged, filthy blade from a sheath at his belt that looked like it was held together with tar, leather straps, and spite. “You stay in here, I stabs you. Go check now. If anything kills you, make lots of noise, so we know not safe to come out yet.”</p> 
                   <p>Ak’s head cautiously emerged from under one corner of the canvas drop cloth, almost immediately followed by the rest of his body as someone behind him delivered a swift kick to his backside. The goblin landed in a heap, glancing furtively around as he took in his surroundings. They were in what appeared to be a dimly lit barn. No longshanks (or worse, horses) were in sight, but there were two more wagons, one to either side. Someone had pulled back the canvas covering the nearest wagon, revealing a rack of colorful kites and an opened crate. The crate was packed with straw to protect its contents, but Ak could see enough to immediately recognize what it contained.</p> 
                   <p>The goblin’s beady red eyes went wide. He clambered up and into the wagon, thrust his hand into the crate, and pulled out a decorated red paper tube about the length of his arm, attached to a long stick and trailing a short length of fuse. <em>Fireworks!</em> The best kind of fire! And fire was already the best kind of almost anything. A slow smile spread across Ak’s face, taking several seconds to traverse the distance from one ear to the other. This was going to change everything. Once they saw what he’d found, his companions were sure to be so grateful that...</p> 
                   <p>“Stupid!” someone yelled from the other wagon. “You dead yet? Or it safe to come out?”</p> 
                   <p>Ak looked down at the rocket in his hand, his toothy grin somehow growing even wider. “Just moment,” he said “Found something! You wait there, I show you!” His other hand went to the pouch at his belt, which contained a cache of special ingredients belonging to Mogmurch—ingredients so volatile and dangerous that his alchemist companion had insisted that only Ak could be trusted to carry them—and drew out a single tindertwig. He struck the twig against the rough surface of the canvas, lit the fuse, waited for a tense moment, grew tired of waiting, and jammed the burning twig into the back of the rocket. There was a blinding flash, a deafening report, and Ak was knocked flat on his back. Somewhere nearby, he could dimly make out the unmistakable sound of goblins suffering painful burns, followed by muffled cursing and scrabbling as his companions vacated their hiding place, which quickly gave way to shouts of excitement as they spotted Ak’s discovery.</p> 
                   <p>His senses were still clearing when Reta grabbed him by the throat and hauled him to his feet. “Ak,” she said through gritted teeth, staring into his eyes as they struggled to focus. “You try to kill us. With firework.” She motioned to the gently smoldering wagon behind them, then to the other goblins greedily rifling through the opened crate. “But. You also find us many, many firework. You are forgiven, Ak. Today... today you are one of us.”</p> 
                   <p>A single tear of pure joy ran down Ak’s cheek. “R-really?” he whispered.</p> 
                   <p>Reta smiled, her mouth bristling with needle-sharp teeth. “No,” she said. “Not really.” She gave him a hard push, and Ak topped backwards over the edge of the wagon. Before he could hit the ground, the rocket that Chuffy had stuffed down the back of his leather jerkin went off, propelling him across the warehouse and into the darkness of the hayloft overhead with a strangled yelp and a gout of colorful flame.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Behind Reta, Poog and Mogmurch were busily pulling more fireworks out of the crate. “Smoke bomb,” Mogmurch said, lighting the fuse of a wrapped paper bundle and tossing it aside with an exasperated sigh. “Not explode. Not start fire. No point.” Poog nodded in agreement, holding the end of another lit tindertwig to the fuse of a bright purple rocket, then deftly spinning the rocket around to use its fuse to light another, even larger, green rocket. He was still clutching both when the door flew open at the other end of the barn.</p> 
                   <p>“Who’s in here?” bellowed a tall figure, silhouetted against the light streaming in from outside the barn. The goblins froze. A second shadow, four-legged, growled deep in its throat and stalked ahead of its master into the barn.</p> 
                   <p>Poog panicked. Immediately. “DOG!” he shrieked, lowering the green rocket so that it pointed at the oncoming animal a split second before it went off. The rocket missed the dog by more than a goblin’s full height and shot directly out the open entryway, where it struck the inner wall of a stable next door and ricocheted wildly from stall to stall, trailing a shower of sparks. A moment later, the purple rocket in Poog’s other hand went off, striking Mogmurch squarely in the face. The other goblin’s skull-faced helmet flew off as he toppled backward into the crate, followed by the sparking purple rocket. The straw cushioned his impact for a brief moment before bursting into flames.</p> 
                   <p>“GOBLINS!” the longshanks in the doorway yelled, taking a step back as the dog, followed by two others, charged snarling into the barn. Poog shrieked in terror and leaped from the wagon, scampering across the cluttered floor and clambering up the assortment of riding tack that hung on one wall of the barn, with Reta right on his heels. There was a tremendous crack, and a blast of heat and smoke washed over them as the wagon below erupted in a massive storm of shrieking multicolored fireballs. One of the fireballs, shrieking slightly louder than the others, darted across the floor and up a rickety ladder toward the hayloft. </p> 
                   <p>“That way!” Reta snarled at Poog, gesturing toward the loft as she began to swing, hand over hand, across the wall of saddles and wagon wheels. Below, the dogs barked in rage and confusion as something else caught fire with a satisfying <em>whoosh</em>. There were more longshanks outside now; she could hear them. More dogs, too.</p> 
                   <p>In the loft they found Mogmurch, still smoking but no longer actually aflame, peering out a small window that opened out over the street. A moment later, Chuffy hauled himself up and over the ledge, blade clenched between his teeth. He scowled down at Ak, whose unconscious body was still sprawled face down on the floor where he had landed at the end of his brief flight. “Stupid Ak,” he said, delivering a scornful kick that elicited a weak moan. “Mess everything up for us. Again. Now we stuck up here, probably die.”</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah, not look good,” Mogmurch said. “Longshanks busy trying to put out stable fire. Way too many dogs outside, though. Maybe we throw Ak down, run away while they eat him?”</p> 
                   <p>There was a moment of silent contemplation as each goblin briefly considered who they might be able to bully into dragging Ak to the window. Outside, a panicked human voice screamed, “It’s spreading! Dawnflower’s grace, stop it before it reaches the alchemist!”</p> 
                   <p>Poog broke the silence, chuckling knowingly as he put his arms around his companions’ shoulders.</p> 
                   <p>“Friends, friends,” Poog said, closing his eyes and shaking his head softly from side to side. “You really think Poog not have brilliant escape plan for just this moment? You forget why we call Poog the smart one?” Sliding one hand into his belt pouch, he withdrew the item inside with a flourish, grinning widely as he looked around for approval.</p> 
                   <p>Reta was not impressed. “Yes,” she said. “We all have fingers, Poog. Finger not what we need right now, Poog.”</p> 
                   <p>Poog glanced down at the mummified digit in his hand, scowling, and tossed it away before quickly withdrawing a second item, which he dutifully examined before displaying it to the others. “Not that. Have lots of things in here.” He took the rough wooden whistle in his hand and put it to his lips, then blew silently.</p> 
                   <p>A tense moment passed.</p> 
                   <p>“It broken?” Chuffy started to ask. He was interrupted as a grand commotion erupted somewhere outside. Something large skidded across the cobblestone street and crashed into something else with a dull thud. A chorus of canine yips broke out, only to be drowned out by a furious bellow that trailed off into a high-pitched squeal of rage. The five goblins crowded to the window.</p> 
                   <p>“SQUEALY NORD!”</p> 
                   <p>A huge pig was charging haphazardly through the crowd, scattering longshanks and dogs alike. As the last of the dogs turned tail and fled, the pig positioned itself in the street directly below the window, looking up at them expectantly. They jumped as one, pouring out of the window just as the hayloft went up in flames behind them. Poog wrapped his arms around Squealy Nord’s neck and prodded him gently on one flank. “Run, Squealy Nord!” he shouted. “Run like wind!”</p> 
                   <p>They met with little resistance as Squealy Nord raced up the road leading out of town, bellowing, snorting, and squealing in equal measure; the dogs had scattered, and the longshanks, easily distracted, were busy attempting to extinguish the flames. About a quarter mile outside the village walls, the great swine slowed to a trot, and the goblins allowed themselves a moment to cautiously look back. Sure enough, no one had followed them. Also, Poog was missing. </p> 
                   <p>“Reta,” Mogmurch said. “Poog fall off. We go back, get him?”</p> 
                   <p>Even at that distance, they all felt the shockwave from the massive blast that came next. There was a deep, shuddering boom, and a colorful cloud in the shape of a flower bloomed over the village, mingling with the thick cloud of black smoke already spreading over the countryside. On the wind, they could hear the distant sound of screams.</p> 
                   <p>“Nah,” Reta said. She slid a dried truffle from her pocket into Squealy Nord’s mouth and patted the massive pig’s shoulder. “Poog fine, he find way back. I hungry. Let’s go get food.”</p>

                   <p>If you’re looking to add a touch of horror to your Starfinder game, Starfinder Society has you covered! Explore the corridors of a derelict starship to discover the reason behind the crew’s tragic fate. There were no survivors, but that doesn’t mean you’re the only ones lurking among the flickering lights in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9wes?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-104-Cries-From-the-Drift"><em>Starfinder Society #1-04: Cries from the Drift</em></a>. Or perhaps you’d rather investigate a lethal biotech augmentation whose victims won’t stay dead in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9y4l?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-110-The-HalfAlive-Streets"><em>Starfinder Society #1-10: The Half-Alive Streets</em></a>. If you prefer a subtler form of horror, follow the trail of a missing Starfinder that leads to threat lurking undetected on Absalom Station in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wkn?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-130-Survivors-Salvation"><em>Starfinder Society #1-30: Survivor's Salvation</em></a>. For frightening abodes, what better place to find a creepy mansion than in the center of a mysterious swamp that floats through the Drift? Trace the origin of a bizarre painting to its unnatural origins in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022lc?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-215-The-Infernal-Gallery"><em>Starfinder Society #2-15: The Infernal Gallery</em></a>. Finally, as any Starfinder knows, the space between the stars is home to wonders and terrors alike. The unseen font of knowledge worshipped by a group of morlamaws could spell doom for their entire planet. Will you stop these schemes or be among the victims in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022x4?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-218-Forbidden-Tides"><em>Starfinder Society #2-18: Forbidden Tides</em></a>?</p> 
                   <p>For Pathfinder frights, let’s start with the ghost story that I’ll be playing on Halloween: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-302-The-East-Hill-Haunting"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-02: The East Hill Haunting</em></a>. Were your fellow Pathfinders responsible for murdering a woman who’s now returned as a ghost, or is there a conspiracy at work? Ustalav is a popular destination for horror adventures, and for good reason. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027l1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-217-Lost-Maid-of-Anactoria"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-17: Lost Maid of Anactoria</em></a>, the local celebrity of the town of Anactoria, who’s said to confer blessings upon those who visit her, has gone missing. The town fears misfortune if she isn’t returned soon, but this isn’t a typical missing persons case. As everyone in town knows, the maid is already dead! Now, if you’re looking for a classic haunted house, look no further than <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024wv?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-125-Grim-Symphony"><em>Pathfinder Society #1-25: Grim Symphony</em></a>, an adventure so steeped in gothic horror tropes that you can practically see the lightning flashing behind the building’s eerie silhouette. Last but not least, sometimes even the most straightforward mission can go horribly wrong. When a simple delivery to a trading post leads you into the clutches of an evil spirit, you’ll need to keep your senses sharp and weapons close to survive the night in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022lb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-113-Devil-at-the-Crossroads"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-13: Devil at the Crossroads</em></a>.</p>

                    <p><em>Taking a much-needed relaxing break in between escapades, four gun-toting adventures post up in a dingy bar in one of Alkenstar's entertainment districts. Right across the street at a theater, people flood inside to catch the premiere of a highly-advertised play, but what comes out of the theater is far more dangerous. As people scatter to safety in the dusty streets, it’s up to the group of gunslingers in the bar to set things right.</em></p>

                   <p>Adam Conn hails from the many corners of The DaT Network. Starting way back in the days of Walking in Circles Season 2, Conn has now stepped out as one of the new co-online content creators of the DaT Network. He appeared in past adventures as Kimbulton and Castriel on Dragons and Things, Mooktin in Rise of the Runtlords and Kanon Featherbee in Department of Mysteries. You can currently find him on Harbingers as the best local fisherman Hadrian (Hadi) Marth and over on Norse Foundry's Twitch stream in vods of Fenrir Rising as Nix and their current live show, Alien Connections as Sergeant Trenton Barclow. And premiering Nov 14th, he will be in the GM seat for his Pathfinder show "Voyage of the Siren's Song", a pirate adventure set in the Skull and Shackles AP! </p>

                   <h4><a href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaBytes" target="_blank">Chelsea Bytes </a></h4> 
                   <p>ChelseaBytes is a singing, fun-focused, conversationalist who has a passion for tech, games, and anime, among many other things. Soon after she started streaming on Twitch 3 years ago, many viewers were surprised to find that she was a Computer Scientist, saying that she was too “loud” and “fun”. This Twitch Partner aims to show the world that Computer Scientists don’t look and act the way most people imagine.</p> 
                   <p>ChelseaBytes plays a large variety of games over on her channel, but when she's not smashing heads in God of War or winning lane in League of Legends, her stream becomes a daytime TV show. This means cosplaying, hosting giveaways, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and cooking gourmet meals for her community, the ByteCommand. Nothing describes Chelsea's stream better than "Variety", and that variety is made up of ALL of her interests. Chelsea's performance doesn't stop at her own Channel. She is an official host of AMC's FearHQ Twitch channel (Re-Watching Dead, Play Dead, TWD Watchalong, etc.) and Amazon's Crown Channel (Fight Night, Chasing the Crown: Dreamers to Streamers, Clicksport-1, etc.), and has hosted events for companies such as Red Bull (Solo Q Tournament Series), Intel (Unboxing+PC Build), Netflix (TUDUM co-stream), and DTS (Multiple PC Builds/Giveaways), to name a few. </p> 
                   <p>Not to be limited to her own stream/hosting, Chelsea spends any extra time guesting. She has had several appearances on D&amp;D Actual Play series like PixelCircus’ "Damsels, Dice, and Everything Nice" and INDG’s "Dungeons &amp; Durags". She was also invited as a Guest/Attending Professional to Dragon*Con 2021 where she co-hosted multiple panels focused on Digital Media. Not one to shy away from causes close to her heart, Chelsea has guested for several charity streams for important causes like "Color of Change" and "Rise Above the Disorder." Regardless of what genre she's in, what channel she's hosting for, or what event she's at, ChelseaBytes always throws herself fully into whatever she's doing.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Wow, as of the time I’m writing this the last couple weeks have been eventful, to say the least. One event that would be an absolute shame to overlook is this, the <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> author blog! Below are an array of the freelancers who helped make <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> possible. I want to note not everyone involved had the time to write or submit an introduction for themselves, so please keep an eye on the credits of the final book to see everyone else who helped make this project possible!</p> 
                   <p>I do want to call special attention to one freelancer who is both an incredibly strong author and designer and who won’t get the recognition she deserves unless I use this opportunity to give it her but let me open with a bit of a story. In publishing, sometimes things go wrong—this is especially true when you’re undertaking back-to-back ambitious projects like <em>Secrets of Magic</em> and <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> that are looking to use new and unique templates or delivery methods for conveying information. Without getting too lost in the weeds, let me just note that basically all those things that can go wrong did go wrong at some point or another over the course of this project. One result of this was that we had to reimagine the presentation of quite a few elements in <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> during development.</p> 
                   <p>Now, Jessica Redekop was absolute dynamite during this project. She provided insights and assistance to less experienced authors and designers, was an unfailing voice of support and positivity, and turned over some incredibly cool design work. Sadly, <em>none</em> of that work appears in <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>. Through no fault of her own, all of Jessica’s work ended up being in sections of the book that were heavily reworked in ways that required us to cut her submissions. I’ve done what I can to make sure at least some of those submissions make their way into other books so you’ll still get to see the incredible work Jess did, but I want to take this moment to note that even though none of her words appear in this book and she is not credited as a writer, Jess is very much a part of the team that made <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> the (in my humble opinion) incredible book it is.</p> 
                   <p>With that out of the <em>way</em>, this blog is already way longer than it’s probably supposed to be, so I’m going to shut my digital mouth and let my amazing freelancers speak for themselves!</p>

                   <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> 
                   <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a full-time freelance author. I’ve contributed to over thirty projects for Paizo, including <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, “The Gilded Cage,” and <em>PFS #3-99: Fate in the Future</em>. My upcoming releases include <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>, <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em>, and <em>Galactic Magic</em>!</p> 
                   <p>I wrote a wide range of material for <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, including feats, vehicles, cursed and intelligent guns, a bunch of fun gizmos, and (my personal favorite) the dwarves of Dongun Hold. Contributing to this project was a blast and I hope it inspires.</p>

                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/companies/campaignCoins">Campaign Coins</a> and Paizo have been friends for more than a decade, and we’re always looking for new things to make together, so when the new edition came out, metal <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zq1?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Tokens">Pathfinder Hero Point tokens</a> were a perfect collaboration. Physical tokens help the players remember they have an ace up their sleeve. The detailed token design by Terry Lane has the Glyph of the Open Road on one side and the Pathfinder™ "P" symbol on the other. And, if you look closely, there’s a subtle nod to a certain seven-pointed star.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>When Pathfinder Second Edition debuted at Gen Con 2019, Paizo decided to commemorate the release with a special limited edition Hero Point Token featuring everyone’s favourite goblin alchemist, Fumbus. Since then, we’ve released an <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023g6?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Advanced-Players-Guide">Advanced Player’s Guide Token</a> in 2020 featuring Feiya the iconic witch, and recently the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027vl?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-PaizoCon-2021">PaizoCon 2021 Hero Point Token</a> put a bird on it with Korakai the tengu oracle.</p> 
                   <p>Campaign Coins are also huge friends with <a href="https://paizo.com/companies/qWorkshop">Q-Workshop</a> and were inspired by their Pathfinder dice, and so have started making a special token for each new Pathfinder Adventure Path. In each case, the heads side features an iconic character or moment from the adventure. The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024y2?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Age-of-Ashes">Age of Ashes</a> token features the dragon Mengkare, whereas the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024y1?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Extinction-Curse">Extinction Curse</a> token has the big top, because if there’s one thing we know, it’s that players love that tent. The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xp?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Agents-of-Edgewatch">Agents of Edgewatch</a> token has the Eye of Aroden keeping watch, and the brand new <b><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap7?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Abomination-Vaults">Abomination Vaults</a></b> token has eccentric oddities merchant Wrin Sivinxi. The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap8/discuss?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix">Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</a> token out next month has the tournament symbol on it.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>So why get an Adventure Path token? One option is as a keepsake! They’re a nice gift to your Game Master to thank them for running you through the series, or to your players as a memento.</p> 
                   <p>But if you want the Adventure Path tokens to make an impact in your game, here’s a fun house rule: all the tokens share the same reverse “P” side, so mix in one from the Adventure Path you’re playing, shuffle them face down, and pass them out randomly. If a player gets the Hero Point token for the current adventure—say Abomination Vaults—then that token counts as two Hero Points. Everyone is always pleased to see Wrin already, and now they’ll be twice as pleased to see her face!</p>

                   <p>The next steps will involve the United Paizo Workers (UPW) union electing their bargaining representatives and then meeting with Paizo management to negotiate terms for a collective bargaining agreement. We expect this process to take some time, but we are committed to the effort and hope to settle a contract in due course. Until an agreement is reached, the Paizo staff continues to focus on creating amazing Pathfinder and Starfinder products.</p> 
                   <p>Paizo has always been about creating awesome games, and we look forward to the changes that unionization will bring to the company. Please join us on this journey by <a href="https://twitter.com/PaizoWorkers">following the UPW on Twitter</a> and stay tuned for future updates!</p>

                   <p>First up, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></a>! First Seeker Ehu Hadif is sending experienced agents to Pholskar, a planet inhabited by giants, to perform an archaeological survey on ruins normally restricted to all but the planet’s ruling Cloud Imperium. During their time on Pholskar, the Starfinders will navigate the planet’s volatile environment and trade words with a cloud giant diplomat. The actions of our Starfinders will determine whether the Starfinder Society is invited back to Pholskar or banned from the planet’s archaeological scene forever! <em>Through Sea and Storm</em> is a scenario for levels 7–10 written by myself, which is certainly a surreal way to start my time at the helm of the Society. When Jenny asked me to write <em>Through Sea and Storm</em> last April, I had no idea I would be the person to announce it.</p> 
                   <p>Our second mission of the month is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aks?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-410-The-Way-In"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-10: The Way In</em></a>! Acting on intel gathered by Starfinders on previous missions, Ixthia the Unbreakable leads a fleet of Starfinder vessels to a system in the Vast, aiming to disable a robotic armada controlled by the mysterious culprit behind the Data Scourge. The Starfinders take out and impersonate an isolated patrol ship, gain important intel on the enemy fleet, and infiltrate the enemy flagship while Ixthia leads the Starfinder fleet in a large-scale assault against the automated armada. This is the first time our agents have a chance to truly turn the tables on their unnamed enemy, and this adventure doesn’t disappoint! <em>The Way</em> In is a scenario for levels 5–8 written by Dennis Muldoon. You don’t want to miss this one!</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <p>Take care, Starfinders! It’s been a pleasure.</p>

                    <p><em>The Ustalavic wolfhound turned around three times before finally settling into the enormous cushion beside his master’s desk. But it was not his master’s feet that he rested his chin on. When he raised his eyebrows and let out a heavy sigh, it was not his master’s gaze he met. It was his master’s trusted friend, the one he called “Benedet.” Benedet was around a lot. More than the wolfhound’s master, even. Benedet was always calm and kind. Benedet took good care of the hound.</em></p> 
                    <p><em>But Benedet’s face was not calm now. It was worried. The master had been gone… how long? Too long. Many meals had passed since the master had been here.</em></p> 
                    <p><em>The one called Benedet sighed back at the wolfhound and spoke. Their voice quivered slightly. Not enough for people to notice, but the wolfhound knew: Benedet was terrified. “Don’t worry, Arnisant. I’m sure the Pathfinders will be along soon. I’d go looking for him myself, but—well, someone has to stay and take care of you, right? And if he turned up while I was away—no, that just wouldn’t do. I must follow the protocols. He wouldn’t have it any other way. You understand, don’t you, old friend? Of course you do. Don’t worry…”</em></p> 
                    <p><em>The wolfhound nuzzled deeper into the cushion as Benedet rested their feet once more against his fur. And they waited.</em></p>

                   <p>Amircia winced, took a moment to reload her pistol, and took aim at the—eyes? hands?—eye-hands of the blood painter closest to her. “<em>Typically</em>, our patrols don’t get surrounded by aberrations.” A clean shot straight through the appendage, and she was already moving in with her machete to sever the wounded limb.</p> 
                   <p>Rahaksenwe snorted, adjusting her hold on her spider gun. She took a breath in time with the gun’s pulsing and fired, covering another blood painter in webbing. Taking advantage of the shrieking creature’s immobilization, she moved closer, stomping on its torso, and fired the poison shot right into its face. “It’s just interesting to me that you didn’t need an escort into Port Valen, but you felt I needed an escort into Jolizpan. On your left!”</p> 
                   <p>“And clearly I was correct!” Amircia turned in time to catch the blasted aberration’s teeth around her blade instead of her shoulder. A muttered prayer under her breath as she positioned her pistol alongside the machete, eliminating another blood painter with a shot before it could attempt to make art out of her. She spun around, aiming at another one of the creatures before it could reach Rahaksenwe and swearing when she heard the audible click of her pistol jamming. “Another one!”</p> 
                   <p>“Got it!” Rahaksenwe took a half-step back, adjusting the spider gun once more to fire webbing at the blood painter’s feet, causing it to trip and stumble across the tree roots. </p> 
                   <p>Amircia took advantage of the creature’s clumsiness, finishing it off with her machete before taking a moment to catch her breath and look around. “Is this... all of them?”</p> 
                   <p>“Seems like it, though I have been wrong before.” Rahaksenwe leaned against a tree and slid into a sitting position. She let out a breath and returned her spider gun to its proper place on her back. “You did well, thank you,” she said softly, feeling her connection to the creature she’d made the weapon from.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>“Are you hurt?” Amircia looked the other woman over, concerned about her well-being and wanting to be on the move as quickly as possible.</p> 
                   <p>Rahaksenwe shook her head, getting to her feet. “No, thank Desna. They caught your patrol by surprise, but by the time they’d revealed themselves I was already armed and ready. How far until the city?”</p> 
                   <p>“A little less than a day. Strange that they would attack so close to the city and not come after you when you were alone.” Amircia nudged one of the bags of the blood painters and frowned, shaking her head. “Strange that they’re here at all, really.”</p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps the beauty of the skyline drew them here.” Rahaksenwe gestured to a small, clear space in the trees. “Through here you can see the city outline against the mountains. It took my breath away. Maybe they wanted to make it theirs, too.”</p> 
                   <p>Amircia followed her to the clearing and smiled a bit, looking at the outline of Jolizpan. “Maybe.” She glanced back at the scene they had left behind and grew somber. “We should be on the move. I don’t want to attract any other creatures and I’ll need to organize a larger, better trained patrol to come back for our soldiers.”</p> 
                   <p>Rahaksenwe nodded solemnly, adjusting her pack and gesturing for Amircia to lead the way. “Remember, I am not as sure-footed as you. Let an old woman keep up.” She chuckled softly at Amircia’s snort and followed her lead.</p> 
                   <p>“Your gun.” Amircia commented after they’d walked for some time. “It’s a beast gun.” She glanced sideways at Rahaksenwe, her statement just as much a question as it was a declaration.</p> 
                   <p>“Correct. I inherited this one from my grandmother.” Rahaksenwe unholstered her spider gun, feeling it grow warm to her touch as the magic activated. “She was there to see me off on my hunt to find the ogre spider and she was there to welcome me back with herbs and soup when I returned with the components needed.” She smiled a bit at the memory before holstering the gun once more.</p> 
                   <p>“So, she was also one to scope the battlefield before firing a single shot?” Amircia asked, adjusting her headdress after ducking beneath a swinging branch.</p> 
                   <p>Rahaksenwe nodded, wiping sweat from her forehead. “She was. She taught me to look and listen before firing and to make sure that I kept myself at advantage. Not like my nephew, who spends all year with his screech shooter that he built from a snowy owlbear. He rolls into town like he’s never seen an angry auntie before!”</p> 
                   <p>“Did your grandmother oversee his ritual, too?” Amircia asked curiously, using her machete to clear the path before them. The sun was starting to dip below the horizon, and she didn’t like the odd silence that had fallen over the jungle along with the storm clouds overhead. It felt like the creatures in the jungle, usually so chatty and busy before a storm, were preparing for something big.</p> 
                   <p>“No.” Rahaksenwe sighed, shaking her head. “She’d already left us by the time he was old enough to hunt on his own. I oversaw his ritual. I’m proud of him, even if he is too cocky for his own good. Makes sense his gun chose him.”</p> 
                   <p>Amircia chuckled before pausing and tilting her head. She held an arm out, stopping Rahaksenwe in her tracks. “Do you hear that?”</p> 
                   <p>“The thunder?”</p> 
                   <p>Amircia shook her head, earrings clinking softly. “The screaming. Sounds like a drake of some kind.”</p> 
                   <p>Rahaksenwe took a second to listen before frowning and taking out her spider gun. “Do you have more bullets?”</p> 
                   <p>“I always have more bullets. Do you have more energy?”</p> 
                   <p>Rahaksenwe cracked a smile, dropping her pack and squaring up alongside Amircia as the sound of crashing foliage and thundering footsteps drew close. “I always have more energy for a good hunt. Lead the way, old friend.”</p>

                   <h3>Luis Loza (he/him), Paizo Developer</h3> 
                   <p>I’m of Mexican heritage, but always felt like I wasn’t Mexican enough growing up. I’d get weird looks for being into games or for being loud and goofy. I wasn’t always a quiet child that was into the same things as my parents, relatives, or peers. For a long time, I felt like I wasn’t being Mexican the right way, even though that’s a silly notion. A lot of my best friends growing up were white because it seemed like white people could kind of do whatever they wanted to and at best be written off as weird, rather than “not white enough.” Over the years, I learned part of it was because of boundaries as to where Mexican ended and everything else began. Mexicans did A, B, and C, but not X, Y, and Z. I saw it with a lot of people, not just Mexicans. It could be a heritage thing, a religion thing, a sexuality thing, a gender thing. These invisible boundaries were there, and I was tired of them. I like the things I like and that doesn’t make me less Mexican. Part of the reason I enjoy RPGs is because anyone can do anything they want or be whomever they want. I hope that I can extend a hand to other people to climb past these boundaries with our games. Maybe the next person we help can begin tearing these boundaries down so everyone can be who they want without feeling like they’re not doing it correctly.<br> Thanks,<br> Luis Loza</p>

                   <h3>Diego Valdez (he/him), Paizo contributor and former Customer Service Representative</h3> 
                   <p>My name is Diego. I’ve been around the TTRPG industry in a few ways. You may know me from my time as a customer service representative for Paizo. But I have also done a lot of freelance writing for both Pathfinder and Starfinder! For org play I have written two Starfinder Society scenarios and a quest, and I also have three ACG adventures under my belt. I have a little bit of backmatter in an AP for each Pathfinder and Starfinder. You can also find me as a contributor on <em>Alien Archive 3</em>, <em>Near Space</em>, <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, <em>Gods &amp; Magic</em>, and the soon to be released <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em>.</p> 
                   <p>I come from northern New Mexico, and I am very proud of my Chicano background and heritage. Since I was young learning about it, embracing it, and living it has always been an important part of who and what I am, even now, here in Washington so far from home. Being able to bring more of that into the worlds I write for is something I have really wanted to do. From a Curandera class, to an adventure revolving around novelas, to setting locations with a Nuevo Mejicano style, I hope to bring it all!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Joseph Blomquist (he/him), Paizo Contributor</h3> 
                   <p>Hola, my friends. I’m Joseph Blomquist, a Nuyorican writer with a decade or so of freelance work around the game industry. I’ve contributed to MWP’s <em>Smallville RPG</em> and <em>Marvel Heroic Roleplaying</em> lines, to Starfinder Society with <em>2-21: Illegal Shipment</em>, <em>3-18: Secrets in Stillness</em>, to Pathfinder Society with the upcoming <em>4-04: The Devil-Wrought Disappearance</em>, among many other projects. With the exception to some PF2 conversions for Legendary’s fantastic <em>Boricubos: The Lost Isles</em>, my Latino culture hasn’t come up as often in my freelance career as I would have liked—but it has influenced my outlook on business and the perception of Hispanic and Latino cultures in all industries, not just ours.</p> 
                   <p>Twenty-five years ago, I changed my name. To honor my stepfather, I took his name, forsaking the family name I’d borne for twenty years, Rodriguez. Living in New York, where Rodriguez was a more common surname than even Smith, nothing changed. But moving back to Ohio, where I had spent much of my ill-omened teenage years, I saw a marked difference in how I was perceived. It made me reconsider the importance that a simple name could hold over someone’s life. I’ve made it my mission to help grow voices that may have been ignored or passed over in the past because of their name, sex, skin color, or any other element that makes them outside of the “normal.” I haven’t always been successful, but I’ve tried to include every dark-haired, dark-eyed, swarthy individual I could see in my mind’s eye so that others might see themselves. And to live up to the responsibilities of my name, my family, and nuestra historia.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>We appreciate all our Hispanic community members, and we invite those who didn’t share their voices as part of this blog to say hi in the comments and share something you’re proud of! We look forward to celebrating you. </p>

                   <p><em><b>The Menagerie, Familiars, Familiar and Master Abilities</b></em><br> Hello everyone, I am Tineke Bolleman (she/her) and I wrote the familiars and the Menagerie for Grand Bazaar. I love all kinds of animals, so getting to write a shop that puts the animals’ welfare first was great for me. And making new familiars so we all have new friends to take with us on adventures was amazing. Other than writing for Grand Bazaar, I do occasionally write for other Paizo lines. I volunteer for the Organized Play program and I’ve been a tabletop gamer for many years. You can follow me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DireOtterGames" target="_blank">@direottergames</a> for weird game posts, geeking out about animals, and the occasional cat picture.</p>

                   <p><em><b>Merrygleam, Toys, Absalom Ads</b></em><br> Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a freelance author and Starfinder Line Developer for the Starfinder Society. I’ve contributed to over 30 projects for Paizo, including <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, <em>Starfinder #39: The Gilded Cage</em>, and <em>PFS #3-99: Fate in the Future</em>. My upcoming releases include <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>, <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em>, and <em>Galactic Magic</em>.</p> 
                   <p>For <em>Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar</em>, rather than write for myself, I wrote for my children. I wrote the toy shop, Merrygleam, its quirky shopkeep Ozi and her found family, and the toys and other goodies you’ll find inside. Additionally, I wrote Absalom Ads, a ‘training-manual-by-magical-mail’ company led by an absurdly over-the-top halfling. I hope Merrygleam, in particular, brings some joy to your world.<br> All the best,<br> Jessica</p>

                   <h3>Dana Ebert</h3> 
                   <p><em><b>Material Changes</b></em><br> Hello! My name is Dana Ebert (she/her), and it was my pleasure to write about Material Changes and its illustrious proprietor, Iltara Clavela. This was my first contribution to Pathfinder, and I'm thrilled to finally be able to share it with all of you—although I must give credit for all the fabulous items available at the boutique to the extremely talented Jessica Redekop!</p> 
                   <p>I didn't set out at first to write a transgender story, but the themes of transformation and revelation were so central to Iltara's character that as I penned my first draft, it became the obvious choice. As a trans woman myself, it was nerve-wracking to submit something that felt so personal, but I received nothing but support and encouragement from the outstanding team at Paizo. It is my sincere hope that Iltara's story will mean just as much to other people.</p> 
                   <p>In the end, the Grand Bazaar is a triumph of a book, and I'm proud to have been part of it. If you want to know more about what I'm working on, the best places to visit are my Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG" target="_blank">@MistressDanaRPG)</a> or Linktree (<a href="https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG" target="_blank">https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG</a>).

                   <p><b><em>Kraken's Ink Tattoo, Tattoos, Worn Items</em></b><br> Hi all! I’m Avi Kool, and I’m senior editor at Paizo. I had the pleasure of being co–edit lead on this book with Patrick Hurley, as well as writing the Kraken’s Ink section and a handful of worn items, including the tattoos. You can see my writing in books such as <em>Bestiary 3</em> (Nosferatu) and <em>Alien Archive 4</em> (The Seen), as well as in the upcoming <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>. My NPC in this book, Arhan, is meant to be a representation of my Sephardic ancestors and their flight from imperial Spain, so this book is very near and dear to my heart. I hope you all enjoy it.</p>

                   <p><em><b>Catfish Salvage Solutions, Adventuring Gear</b></em><br> Greetings and welcome to the Grand Bazaar! I'm afraid my friend Tattletail is out getting more Anuli spice right now, but maybe I can help you. Who am I? Here, I'm known for peddling adventuring gear like fake blood packs and smoked goggles. Having the opportunity to write a character with a prosthesis like Tattletail means so much to me. I helped look after my late grandmother for many years, and her strength of character is something that helped inspire my work. You might also know me as a blogger on the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/author/dustin/" target="_blank">Know Direction Network</a>, PFS Venture Lieutenant in King County, and the host of a third-party review <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kitsunewarlock" target="_blank">Pathfinder Twitch Show every Tuesday and Friday</a>!

                   <h3>Randal Meyer</h3> 
                   <p><em><b>The Rune Room, Accessory Runes</b></em><br> A fan of Pathfinder since the beginning, I have always enjoyed tinkering with the rules in my own games. After joining the online Pathfinder communities, I knew that I wanted to get more involved in producing game content. That journey started with becoming a blogger at Know Direction, where I write my Groundbreaking blog (and sometimes others) and write reviews of the big GenCon releases from Paizo. I had an absolute blast writing Rakuskuk and the Rune Room. Working with the other writers made it so easy to ground him in the lore of Golarion, Absalom, and the Grand Bazaar itself. I am excited to see how his story grows. Accessory Runes are a wonderful addition to the game that I am proud to have worked on. I cannot wait to see where they go from here. When not working directly on new content, I am probably working on my other passion project... the RPG Sage. I am a big fan of playing RPGs via Discord and so I decided to write my own bot to help immerse myself and others into our games! You can learn more about it and give it a test run on my Discord Server at <a href="https://discord.rpgsage.io/" target="_blank">https://discord.rpgsage.io/</a></p>

                   <p><em><b>Magic Armor, Staves, Wands</b></em><br> Hi, I’m Jacob W. Michaels, one of Paizo’s freelancers. Normally, I’d tell you here how excited I am for you all to see and play with the staves and wands I wrote. But... no, come in a little closer... closer... OK, good... the truth is I mostly just can't wait for the magic armor and runes I wrote to become available because I’ve been saving up gold pieces for a long time for them on a couple of characters. This was a great book to work on, with wonderful developers and fantastic freelancers, and we hope you love it.

                   <h3>Matt Morris</h3> 
                   <p><em><b>Skymetals, Spell Trickster</b></em><br> I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including <a href="http://everybodygames.net/" target="_blank">Everybody Game</a> and <a href="https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/" target="_blank">Rogue Genius Games</a>.</p> 
                   <p>The Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has given me the opportunity to explore some of my favorite parts of the setting in the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, <em>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em>, and <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, and now I'm excited to be contributing to the biggest market in Absalom. If you manage to smuggle some skymetal out of Numeria or learn the secrets of the Spell Trickster, you'll be in my corner of the Bazaar!</p> 
                   <p>I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to <a href="https://mattmorris.carrd.co/">contact me</a> if you are looking for a reliable writer!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, PA.</p>

                   <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> 
                   <p><em><b>Mask and Moon</b></em><br> Howdy! I’m Andrew Mullen, and I wrote The Mask and Moon, Absalom’s premier magical dining venue; Erin Roberts did a great job on the accompanying magical food section. Speaking of, why just conjure your food when you can intricately weave cooking and magic to create something truly spectacular! (The Mask and Moon apologizes for any and all beef automaton incidents, past and future)</p> 
                   <p>Read Jess’s blog entry here for particular Paizo staff members you should thank - I echo her sentiments 100%. I’m proud to work with such dedicated and talented folks. I’d also like to recognize the folks at Paizo who keep the website running, books flowing in and out of the warehouse, orders and customer concerns handled, and all the less public-facing but no less essential work of running a publishing business.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, I and frequent freelancers Isabelle Thorne and Mikhail Rekun are working on the Luminant Age, a 3rd-party campaign setting for Pathfinder 2E. We recently sent <em>Fauna of the Luminant Age</em> to Kickstarter backers, which includes vampire anteater dogs and rats that can make you teleport to death. We’ve got more projects in the works on the run-up to the full campaign setting book—stay updated at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">our Twitter account</a>!</p>

                   <p><em><b>Historia Reliquary, Magic Ammunition</b></em><br> Greetings, traveler. You, yes you! Enter the Historia Reliquary and see the legends of Avistan long lost. Garundi history? Oh yes, we have that too, somewhere in the back. But first, look at this arrow. Carved head to look like a rhinoceros. It dates back to the Sixth Army of Exploration in Taldor. I suppose I could part with it, to someone who understands its historical significance...</p> 
                   <p>Dave Nelson is a neurodivergent freelancer who is happy to have contributed to Grand Bazaar, writing the magic ammunition and the details of the Historia Reliquary. In particular he is excited to provide positive autistic representation, a cause he feels strongly about, through the proprietor of the Reliquary. Please enjoy!</p>

Credit to Dana Ebert for the rest of the Material Changes entry). I had a great time working on Grand Bazaar with my fellow authors, with Luis and Eleanor as the book's development leads, Mark as the design lead, Patrick and Avi as editorial leads, and all the other people needed to make these books happen. I am privileged to be part of this great and talented network of people who collaborate and create together, and to have such a wonderful, kind, and fierce group of peers</p>

I’m Erin Roberts (she/her), and I’m thrilled to be making my Pathfinder (and published TTRPG) debut in Logbee! I had the absolute pleasure of writing Khisa, who shares my passion for storytelling and social justice, and her Relics &amp; Remembrance shop. I also had a blast creating Alchemical and Magical Tapas to complement The Mask and the Moon, the restaurant written by Andrew Mullen that my tastebuds desperately wish existed.</p> 
                   <p>While this is my first Paizo project, there's more to come, so keep an eye out for my work in <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em> and other projects yet to be announced. You can follow all of my work (including my prose science fiction/fantasy/horror writing) on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/nirele" target="_blank">@nirele</a> or check out my website at <a href="http://writingwonder.com/" target="_blank">writingwonder.com</a>.

I really enjoyed creating a familiar sanctuary and crafting the relationship between quiet Roswine and exuberant Cabbage, who might just a little bit be based on my orange cat, Beans! You may have also seen my writing in a couple of Starfinder Society scenarios, as well as <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, and <em>Bestiary 3</em>. I have a few more entries in upcoming books, including <em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em>.</p> 
                   <p>I also pop up around Coyote &amp; Crow and have a few things being announced with them soon!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/spellsinsugar" target="_blank">@SpellsInSugar</a>, where you can also sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media.

                   <p><em><b>Tesyovensku’s Warehouse, Animal Companions, Companion Items</b></em><br> Howdy! I’m Ashton, and I wrote the animal companions, companion items, and the skymetal shop, Tesyovensku’s Warehouse! As someone who came out as nonbinary relatively recently, getting to write up a nonbinary character was a real treasure for me. Plus, I got to whip up some really interesting animal companions, and I think the <em>hosteling statuette</em> and <em>swarmform collar</em> offer some exciting options for characters with companions. Do me a favor and kill a Big Bad with a swarm of pangolins, if you can!</p> 
                   <p>If you’d like to keep up with me online, I’m pretty active on Twitter, where you can find me as <a href="https://twitter.com/WhoTweetedThis">@WhoTweetedThis</a>, also known as Game Raccoon. I post up my art there on a regular basis, talk about gaming of the TTRPG and video varieties, and generally try my dangdest to make at least one corner of Twitter a warm, welcoming, inclusive space. And be sure to keep your eyes out for <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>, which I also contributed to, coming April 2022!</p>

                   <h3>Amber Stewart</h3> 
                   <p><em><b>Barghest’s Bin</b></em><br> Hey there! I’m Amber Stewart (previously writing as Todd Stewart) and I’m delighted to have written the Barghest’s Bin for <em>Lost Omens The Grand Bazaar</em>, combining just the right amount of quirky charm with some darker plot hooks. I swear, I write more than planar content, even if I’ve done tons of it over the years! I do love it so very much, but my work on this book let me branch out a bit more from my last several planes-themed projects, but I still couldn’t resist adding in a plot hook with the meladaemon, Inusalia the Lady of Wasting Intoxication, in Omira’s back story, to say nothing of the petrified barghest presently used as a display model for bric-a-brac in the Bin.

                   <h3>Isabelle Thorne</h3> 
                   <p><em><b>Resplendent Rose, Armor and Shield Adjustments, Weapons</b></em><br> Hello, readers! I’m Isabelle Thorne, long-time contributor (five years already!) and proud trans girl. ^_^</p> 
                   <p>For the Grand Bazaar, I brought to life the Resplendent Rose and its proprietor, Ralliadra. Like so many of my NPCs, she is also trans and Shelynite, and I’m incredibly happy with how she (and her music shop) turned out! Mechanically, I produced the new armor and shield adjustments, as well as the new (and, in many cases, returning) base weapons. Both of these elements build on content I produced or revised for Adventurer’s Armory 2 back when I was just starting out, and I tried to include other fan-favorites, such as a certain beloved elven weapon. I hope you enjoy my contributions!</p> 
                   <p>I’m always working on new gaming content, both for Paizo and for my own Patreon, and perhaps someday for Infinite as well. I’m working on fiction, too, and will hopefully have something to show off soon! I also offer my services as an editor and developer for hire.</p> 
                   <p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:kalindlara@gmail.com" target="_blank">kalindlara@gmail.com</a> (work-related matters only, please!), sign up for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ThornyRoseGaming" target="_blank">my Patreon</a> to get exclusive content, or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ThornyRoseGames" target="_blank">Twitter</a>!</p>

                   <h3>Jason Tondro</h3> 
                   <p><em><b>Lost &amp; Found, Structures</b></em><br> Writing for Grand Bazaar was a delight, and I picked topics that left me a lot of room to be creative: Lost &amp; Found seemed like the kind of shop that could have pretty much anything in it, and my other topic—magical structures—is unique to P2, with a lot of what we like to call “design space.” I could have written twice as much on both topics, if we’d had the room! If you’re looking for more of my work, I’ll be developing Starfinder and Pathfinder Adventure Paths here at Paizo for as long as they let me. You can also find me online <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorcomics" target="_blank">@doctorcomics</a> (Twitter) or on the BAMF Podcast (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BAMFPodcast" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/c/BAMFPodcast</a> or your favorite podcast app) where I do a deep dive on the adventures I have developed, unpacking the entire process from pitch to post-publication.</p>

                   <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Catalan and I’m beyond thrilled to announce I’ll be taking over as Starfinder Society Developer!</p> 
                   <p>Some of you may have heard of me, but for those who haven’t, let me introduce myself. I’m a Canadian, Métis freelance TTRPG author and a regular contributor to both the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs. I’ve been a freelance author for nearly three years, and in that time, I’ve contributed to over 30 Paizo products, including three AP volumes, five Starfinder Society Scenarios, and two Pathfinder Society Scenarios, one of which was this year’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029w3/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Special-399-Fate-in-the-Future"><em>Pathfinder Society Special: #3-99 Fate in the Future</em></a>. I’ve also done freelance development work on the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027rz?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic"><em>Starfinder Galactic Magic</em></a>.</p> 
                   <p>Some of my recent work includes Pathfinder’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026l5?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic"><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026mw/discuss&amp;page=1?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc/discuss?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em></a>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zu/discuss?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual#tabs"><em>Starfinder’s Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026mr?Starfinder-Tech-Revolution"><em>Tech Revolution</em></a>, and the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zw"><em>Starfinder #39: The Gilded Cage</em></a>. Some of my upcoming releases include Pathfinder’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029wb?Pathfinder-Book-of-the-Dead"><em>Book of the Dead</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ajm?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Knights-of-Lastwall"><em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029ud?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-176-Lost-Mammoth-Valley"><em>Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley</em></a>, and <em>Pathfinder #186: Ghost King’s Rage</em>, and Starfinder’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027rz?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic"><em>Galactic Magic</em></a> and<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis"><em> Drift Crisis</em></a>.</p> 
                   <p>Before becoming a freelance author, I managed d20diaries, a personal blog discussing my family’s experiences in d20 gaming. While my blog has long since taken a backseat to freelancing, it still gets a periodic update when time allows. When I’m not playing or writing for my favorite TTRPGs, I’m spending time with my kids. I’m a sucker for a good book, board game, video game, or TCG.</p> 
                   <p>Jenny has made a huge contribution to Starfinder and has been a shining light as leader of the Starfinder Society. She’s left me an impressive legacy to measure up to and, while I’m still settling into my new role, I look forward to bringing my best to the Society. I hope you’ll join me.</p>

                   <p>You will take the role of one of the iconic heroes of Pathfinder, trapped in a magical entity calling itself the “Arena”. The entity poses a challenge to the party: select a champion to claim the right to escape from it.</p>

                   <p>Old friends become opponents, and you are suddenly forced to compete against them! Dreadful monsters are summoned in an increasingly difficult challenge. Claim glory points by defeating monsters or by unleashing their wrath on your opponents. Players can constantly modify the Arena, pushing and rotating tiles to reach unexplored areas or to trigger a monster’s attack against other heroes. Each hero has asymmetric abilities and a tailor-made deck from which you can draft items and abilities.</p> 
                   <p>Heroes level up during the game by picking up tokens in the Arena to enhance their abilities and access to their deck. The cards’ drafting and the choice of which ability prioritize develop different strategies in the Arena and make each hero unique.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">It’s strange what the mind will do when faced with a significant trauma. Some people scream or fight, others retreat inward, still others flee. As Droven’s storm-tossed ship was flung into the air only to crash and shatter upon the rocky shoals of Arcadia’s coastline, he found a strange calm settle over him. Even as a wooden spar tore free of its rigging and smashed apart his arm, he found himself calmly analyzing the situation.</p> 
                   <p>Clearly, the expedition was a failure. He couldn’t find any of the other Pathfinders who had boarded ship with him, though for some reason he couldn’t seem to see out of his left eye anymore, so maybe they were nearby. The ship was clearly a loss, though. Even if its frame were somehow dragged ashore and enough of its crew survived to sail it home, the islets they’d crashed upon seemed unlikely to provide the timber necessary for repairs.</p> 
                   <p>As Droven considered the likelihood of the ship even being repairable, another surge from the screaming winds and waves cast the battered wreck into the air once more, this time flipping the ship complete over. Droven’s last thought as he sank beneath the waves was that repairs <em>definitely</em> weren’t going to be an option.</p>

He wields a large bronze hammer that looks like equal parts weapon and tool and is accompanied by a small mechanical goblin with a toolbox built into its back"></a><em> Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</em> 
                   <p>Much to his surprise, Droven awoke sometime later. His mouth was parched and dry and he still couldn’t make anything out through his left eye. Attempting to lever himself to his feet revealed that the arm that had likely saved him from a crushing death earlier was now incapable of supporting his weight. Worse, it seemed very likely to become a painful liability in short order. </p> 
                   <p>Realizing that he had little time to spare, Droven spent the rest of the day confirming that he was alone on what he discovered to be a small islet, part of a chain ringing a larger bay between him and the continent of Arcadia proper. For supplies, he found only a half-empty wineskin and some brine-soaked hard tack. As he washed the salty biscuits down with stale wine, Droven found himself musing. “Whoever came up with the saying ‘any port in a storm’ almost certainly never saw that storm or this ‘port’. Ah, well. Am I a Pathfinder or not? There is an unexplored horizon ahead and if I’m to live, I’ll need to find a path from here to there.”</p> 
                   <p>Twisting the fingers of his right hand into the sign of the key, holy symbol of Abadar, god of civilization, Droven invoked one last blessing to his lost compatriots. “May your works stand forever in the First Vault as testament to your skills and may the god that suits you each best watch over you. And if you have already claimed your final reward, do me a favor and distract any sharks between here and the coast. It’d be a shame to survive such a wreck only to feed the fish.”</p> 
                   <p>His prayer complete, Droven grabbed the largest piece of wood he could find in the wreckage for floatation, bound his shattered arm in a tattered sling made from linen he suspected was once part of the wrecked ship’s sails, and began slowly swimming to shore.</p> 
                   <p>Each stroke was an exercise in pain and every lapping wave seared his wounds with salt water, but somehow he reached the shore. He tried to stand and walk as the wooden plank ground into the beach, but he made it only a few steps before collapsing in a heap. As exhaustion weighed his eye shut, he thought he saw leather-booted feet moving towards him. Clinging to the optimism that had allowed him to shrug off pain and prejudice throughout his life, he hoped they belonged to someone friendly. Or at least, interesting.</p> 
                   <p>Droven’s rescuer was a half-orc man named Darv, older than Droven by many years and with gray staining his long black hair. Darv and his family were from the Illani Plains, many miles to the northwest, but had settled here after a dispute with another nomadic clan had threatened to turn to violence. Darv was a gunsmith, skilled in the crafting of firearms both like and unlike those Droven had occasionally seen make their way to Absalom from Alkenstar. Darv’s son and son-in-law, Joach and Nadkym, operated a small smithy, where they forged armor, clockwork prosthetics, and other mechanical devices on par with, and often superior to, anything Droven had seen produced at Absalom’s Clockwork Cathedral.</p> 
                   <p>Darv had been forced to amputate Droven’s arm to save his life, and Joach and Nadkym had already begun work on a prosthetic by the time Droven fully came to his senses and recovered enough from the wreck to move about. With nowhere to go and nothing but time on his hands, Droven joined them at the forge. Much of Droven’s knowledge of alchemy was useless here, so far from the plants and reagents with which he was familiar, but his keen mind was quick to unravel the secrets of clockwork mechanisms and forging techniques. He was able to assist in the construction of his new prosthetic arm, adding modifications to assist him in adventuring when the time inevitably came that he felt well enough to begin seeking a way back home to Absalom.</p> 
                   <p>The healing process, as well as acclimating to his new arm, was a slow affair, filled with long and painful days of careful physical therapy to rebuild his strength and renew his coordination. Droven spent much of his free time tinkering with a clockwork construct. “What exactly do you have there?” Darv would ask each day. “All it does is whirp and spin around while looking like a goblin that fell in a smelting vat!” And each day Droven would reply “It reminds me of home, and an old friend. Plus, one day I’ll find a way back to Absalom and I can’t expect your family to accompany me on such a journey! I’ll need company.”</p> 
                   <p>Darv’s constant references to the clockwork’s “whirping” stuck, and the little mechanical device—primarily a toolbox but one with an unusual propensity for offering assistance without being asked—was soon known as Whirp to everyone, including Droven.</p>

                   <p>As Droven’s inquisitive mind devoured everything Darv and his family could teach on the subject of clockworks and forge techniques, the Pathfinder eventually realized that the time had come for him to seek a way back to Absalom. As he packed a backpack with supplies, Jaoch and Nadkym presented their departing friend with weapons they had forged for him in secret: a hammer integrated with a variety of useful tools for repairing Whirp, and a finely crafted dagger. Darv gave his young friend a pair of armored boots and an admonition. “The soles on these will take you a good while to wear out, my friend. If you still haven’t found a way back home by the time they’re worn thin, come back here, instead. You’ll always have a home.”</p> 
                   <p>With a nod and a smile, Droven and his new companion, Whirp, began their long search for a way back to his home in Absalom, starting by heading toward the land Darv and his family had spoken so fondly of—the Illani Plains.</p>

                    <br> I’m Michael Sayre, a designer at Paizo. As a former member of the United States Army, I couldn’t help but see the strength and resilience of the people I served with in Droven, particularly those who lost a limb or suffered significant injuries during their service. I’d like to accompany Droven’s story by bringing your attention to two organizations that are very important to me. The first is the <a href="https://support.woundedwarriorproject.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">Wounded Warrior Project</a>, which provides financial aid and medical service assistance for members of the armed forces injured in the line of duty. The second is the <a href="https://www.amputee-coalition.org/" target="_blank">Amputee Coalition</a>, who provide assistance and advocacy services for people who have lost a limb, were born with limb difference, or who are faced with the possibility of amputation.

                   <p>“Well?” the blonde elf demanded, her features becoming even sharper as her mouth angled downward into a frown. “Was a hood among his belongings, or not?”</p> 
                   <p>Arvin looked nervously around his office, knowing nothing there would help him. He’d had this office less than a year, taking over as notary when his hardworking employer retired quite suddenly. The old solicitor had cited the drier climate of Taldor as more conducive to his failing health than that of Galt. Arvin wasn’t surprised at anyone leaving Galt—he was thinking very, very hard about it himself right now—but he’d been surprised that his employer would leave such a prosperous enterprise behind. The senior advocate had ascended to manage the business, her junior advocate had taken her position, and so on, with employees inching up through the ranks. Arvin had gone from junior scrivener all the way to notary, earning a tidy raise and this office. He’d thought it was quite a coup for his career. He heartily regretted it now. </p> 
                   <p>The rotund man sitting in the plush chair next to the elf frowned. “Master Utner, it’s a deceptively simple question. But answering on behalf of the deceased could be…unwise.” The man, a pompous aristocrat named Entienne Quibnel, leaned over to examine the papers on Arvin’s desk. Arvin resisted the temptation to throw himself bodily across his desk to block Lord Quibnel’s view. It wouldn’t have helped. He felt his trail of sweat turn into a small river. It was now past sundown, with a light rain falling in the city of Litran. His sweat couldn’t be passed off as anything but nerves.</p> 
                   <p>The elf, Zintaya Calbieste, sighed. “Perhaps we cut this meat from a different angle.”</p> 
                   <p>Arvin found the metaphor gruesome. He was already thinking much too much of the <em>final blades</em>, the magical guillotines used across Galt to behead criminals and those who threatened Galt’s national security.</p> 
                   <p>The elf kept speaking in a folksy drawl that Arvin guessed was an affectation. Secretary Calbieste was the head of Galt’s farming cooperative, a union of ranchers and farmers. The political power that came from controlling food was immense, and Zintaya talked like the dirt-diggers she represented to earn their trust and to bait rivals into underestimating her. Arvin wasn’t falling for it.</p> 
                   <p>“The dead fellow, he farmed kohlrabi, I recall.” </p> 
                   <p>“Yes, some of the most delicious kohlrabi in Litran,” Lord Quibnel agreed, nodding his jowly head.</p> 
                   <p>The elf ignored him. “And the Gray Gardeners—the ones who name wrongdoers, arrest them, and execute them—could be anyone, right? They wear masks while on duty. But other times, they go about as anyone else, digging out traitors and revolutionaries and criminals like they were rabbits in your radish patch. Who’s a Gray Gardener? Maybe a beggar, maybe a wainwright, maybe a noble.”</p> 
                   <p>“And maybe a notary,” added Lord Quibnel with a chuckle, “though certainly not <em>Arvin</em>, here.”</p> 
                   <p>Arvin hated being referred to in the third person when he was present, but he didn’t hate it enough to protest. Certainly, a Gray Gardener could be anyone—such as a plump aristocrat or an elven union manager. He was certain that Gray Gardener business had brought one of these two visitors into his office this evening.</p> 
                   <p>Secretary Calbieste continued, “But Gray Gardeners zealously protect their secrets. And when this kohlrabi farmer was pulped into grease under the wheels of a runaway grain wagon…”</p> 
                   <p>Both Arvin and Lord Quibnel grimaced at the graphic description, but the elf seemed unbothered.</p> 
                   <p>“…his property was boxed up and shipped here to the city, to a relative who’d died of the pox. So the property came to your firm, Master Utner, and you catalogued it. So, I repeat the question: <em>Was a hood among his belongings, or not</em>?”</p> 
                   <p>“As a point of legal clarification,” insisted Lord Quibnel, practically preening, “the deceased was a freeholder indebted to me, so his possessions default to me. This means his secrets do so, as well. Master Utner, don’t answer her question.”</p> 
                   <p>“As a counterpoint, Lord Quiverjowl Quibble, as he was a member of the farming cooperative, his affairs are <em>my</em> business. And outing one of the Gray Gardeners is a <em>very</em> serious business.”</p> 
                   <p>Arvin closed his eyes, thinking hard. His father had been one of the finest and quickest tailors in the city, with a keen eye for style. He’d been taken away by the Gray Gardeners when Arvin was a boy for “promoting unpatriotic fashion,” whatever that meant, and joined those slain beneath a <em>final blade</em>. But his father never had to thread such a fine needle as Arvin did now. One of these two visitors was a Gray Gardener, Arvin was sure of it. Was it Lord Quibnel, as good as ordering Arvin to keep the dead man’s secret? Or was it Secretary Calbieste, wanting to find out whether Arvin knew about the gray silk hood jumbled among farm clothes?</p> 
                   <p>Arvin opened his eyes and spoke slowly.</p> 
                   <p>“Farmers have need for rough daily clothing. Fancy things don’t suit them, except for an occasional trip into Litran for a wedding, a mandatory National Day celebration, or a significant execution.” He was stating the obvious, he knew, and his visitors both listened very carefully. He pictured a very fine thread advancing toward the eye of a very small needle.</p> 
                   <p>“And while a farmer might have need for a nice cloak or fine hat, he wouldn’t need a hood, no. Not at all.” He started sweating again. His visitors were becoming impatient. The thread in his mental image shook.</p> 
                   <p>“And if there had been a gray silk hood among this man’s possessions, and I’m not confirming or denying that there was, only a notarized probate inventory could prove it. And as I’ve not yet concluded the notarization, there might be—officially speaking—no mention in any formal inventory, ever. Regardless of the hood’s existence.”</p> 
                   <p>The office was silent. There was an instant after threading a needle when you made a slight tug, just to see whether you’d hit the eye and the thread held or missed it and the thread came free. Arvin thought about that tug.</p> 
                   <p>Secretary Calbieste smiled. “A <em>gray silk</em> hood, you say?”</p> 
                   <p>Lord Quibnel grinned as well. “Not yet notarized in the inventory, eh?”</p> 
                   <p>The doors to the office flew open. Two large figures in rain-soaked capes and wide hats barged into the room. The facemasks they wore obscured their features and their gloved hands reached for Arvin.</p> 
                   <p>In his mind, the thread flew free. </p>

                   <h2>OPC Musings</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">While obviously a lot has happened in the past few weeks, I wanted to give you all a recap of Gen Con Online, our last major convention of the year.</p>
                   <p> </p>
                   <ul> 
                    <li>We ran over 400 tables of Pathfinder Society, Starfinder Society, and the Adventure Card Society, with 131 GMs running games.</li> 
                    <li>This year’s Pathfinder and Starfinder Specials premiered at the event to great fanfare. These linked specials were a lot of fun to produce behind the scenes, and we hope you all enjoyed them! They are now available for conventions to request and will be available for sale next August.</li> 
                    <li>Our Gen Con charity auction raised $5,886 for Take This and Trinity Haven, Gen Con’s chosen partner charities. Thanks to all who participated in these efforts!</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>We hope you all enjoyed this event, as well as all our preceding events. Our major convention season has concluded for the year, though local conventions are still happening year-round with Paizo support. We encourage you all to find your local group and join up with their events!</p> 
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available October 27, 2021. Releases marked with an asterisk are part of a subscription</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3>

                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>Last week, I posted a longer blog post about the current sanctioning status, so <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shtp?September-2021-Sanctioning-Status-Update">I’ll link you over there</a> and summarize some of the big news:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><em>Tech Revolution</em> is now sanctioned for Starfinder Society!</li> 
                    <li>The priority order for sanctioning the upcoming Pathfinder books is <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, followed by <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>.</li> 
                    <li>Other adventures and Adventure Paths are in progress and will be released as close to street date as we can get them.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>One note I wanted to mention on the upcoming Pathfinder hardcovers: both books have accessibility and mobility devices in them. These are a little bit trickier to sanction than normal rules content; we want to ensure that you can play characters that use these devices to adventure, but we want to prevent using them to power-game, or their abuse at the tables by people who aren’t interested in representing adventurers of all capabilities. As such, we’re working on rules language that threads the needle between “policing who is <em>really</em> disabled” and “allowing open access to all adventurers at all times.” This is something I’m very invested in getting right, and we’ll be consulting with experts on the topic. As a result, sanctioning for these options may be slightly delayed behind the rest of the books. We’ll keep you informed, thank you so much for your patience!</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM reach their fifth nova for Starfinder Society. We also welcome our second and third five-glyph GMs for Pathfinder Society (Second Edition)!</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Nova</b>: Michael Beck<br> <b>5th Glyph</b>: Jocelyn Hamilton, Andrew Watson</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5 Star and 5 Glyph GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                   <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>Now that our new specials have premiered to the world, we have a number of upcoming conventions offering them. Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">conventions calendar</a> for a full list, and be sure to click on the events for more details.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“REAGENTS!”</p> 
                   <p>The goblin, Fumbus, came bounding out of the palms onto the beach with something in his hands raised triumphantly high. </p> 
                   <p>Valeros had to repress the urge to pinch his brow and sigh. Whatever the excitable alchemist was on about, Valeros did not share his enthusiasm, and had a sinking feeling that was not about to change. </p> 
                   <p>He had already chipped the blade of his sword beyond a whetstone’s help hacking down a half-dozen mahogany trunks for a raft; his mood wasn't going to be improving anytime soon.</p> 
                   <p>“Reagents!” Fumbus skipped up to Valeros to show off his discovery. As soon as they got near Valeros’s nose, there was no mistaking what the blackish seed-sized pellets in the goblin's hands were.</p> 
                   <p>“Eeuughh!” He reared back out of smelling distance. “Don't shove it my face, you—” Valeros thought back to all the innumerable goblins who had cursed at him to think of a word to really express his displeasure, and then gave up on it. “We're already up 'reagent' creek without a paddle as it is.”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus giggled and dropped the bat guano into the patched-up grog barrel lying amid the hundreds of other tide-tossed fragments from their reef-broken ship strewn across the beach. After a moment of rubbing his hands together, the goblin cackled hysterically in a way that Valeros had come to associate with imminent explosions.</p> 
                   <p><em>“REAGENTS!”</em></p> 
                   <p>“I get it! I can <em>speak</em> Taldane!” Valeros called after him, but the goblin, mercifully, had dashed back into the waving blade-bushes that marked the edge of the jungle, presumably toward the source of more nocturnal leavings.</p> 
                   <p>He was as puzzled at Fumbus’s grog barrel as he was at Fumbus himself. Merisiel had challenged him to a drinking contest over that same barrel earlier that evening, back when they were all still on the same Arcadia-bound vessel. The voyage had been so long and tedious that he'd forgotten his two rules of drinking contests: one, never getting into a drinking contest with someone several centuries older than you; and two, never get into a drinking contest when there wasn’t more on the line than bragging rights. The problem with drinking contests was that no matter who wins, the next morning you’re both losing, and neither of you can remember who won anyway. Drinking was supposed to be fun, not a competition, after all.</p>

                    <h3>Fumbus and Valeros make the most of the tools at hand in this illustration by Firat Solhan from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>The last memory he had was of the white-haired, black-eyed elf’s face going all fuzzy. Then, all of a sudden, everything was salty, wet, and getting dark fast—in that order. It took all his strength to kick his armored body upward, toward the sun shimmering above him on the ocean's surface; it took all his wits to keep from crying out and filling his lungs with seawater.</p> 
                   <p>The bay of this seemingly uninhabited island was choked with the wrecked detritus of the brigantine, and every once in a while, the tides disgorged a passenger or sailor that Valeros recognized when they were onboard, and alive. Thank the Accidental God that all his friends had survived the wreck; sadly, they appeared to be the only ones. </p> 
                   <p>That is, except Fumbus, whom Valeros had not realized stowed away on their vessel back in Absalom until the goblin popped out from beneath a coil of beached rope with a sputtering cry that scared him half to death. The self-taught alchemist soon began collecting random crap—literally—and filling his reclaimed cask with it.</p> 
                   <p>Valeros had no idea what Fumbus was making, and once again found himself wishing Seoni was here to tell him. Everyone else had fanned out to look for food or friendly locals, and he had been left behind, as per usual, to do the grunt work because he had the muscles. He had spent several hours picking out, cutting down, and pruning the logs, then laying four side-by-side near the water’s edge—to make the completed raft easier to launch—then two under and above those at either end as pressure bars. By the time he was pulling down vines from trees, he was contemplating selling his soul for a drink, any drink—even water! The sun had had several hours to bake him inside his own breastplate. He felt like an engorged sweat sponge.</p> 
                   <p>He thought he had grabbed the sturdiest vines he could find, but when he tugged the binding for the two front crossbeams together, the cord snapped in half, and he dropped on his backside in the sand.</p> 
                   <p>Loud laughter behind him brought him to his feet, drawing his wrecked sword more from pique than caution. The goblin had finished whatever contraption he had been working on, having lashed on a conical nose to the top of the barrel with some of the vines Valeros had set aside for his raft.</p> 
                   <p>“Okay, you!” Valeros pointed his sword at the lashed-together barrel. “This is what we call 'antisocial behavior.' <em>I</em> tore down those vines for my raft. <em>I</em> am trying to save our lives by getting us off this gods-forsaken island. <em>You</em> are yelling things in my face and stealing my stuff! Those vines are mine by right!” </p> 
                   <p>He stepped toward the cone-headed barrel, but Fumbus bared his sharp, tiny teeth and leapt in front of him. “No no no no no!”</p>
                   <p> </p>
                   <p>Valeros sighed. “You know what? You win. I’m sick of this yesterday. I'm gonna go lie down on the ground over there. Maybe when Kyra returns, she can tell me what's going on. But I find everything you do unfathomable.” </p> 
                   <p>He retreated up the beach to the shade of the palms, dropped down onto his back, and prayed for a swift death</p> 
                   <p>The goblin’s head loomed into his field of vision. The makeshift goggles the alchemist wore magnified his eyes so they bulged like magic orbs. </p> 
                   <p>“Do you want to see?” Fumbus whispered without prompting and unscrewed a scroll case he kept slung across his back</p> 
                   <p>“Um, no. That's alright. You really don’t need to...” But Fumbus was already pulling out a complex diagram, unfurling it on the fighter’s chest. Valeros raised his head far enough to see that it depicted a barrel, not unlike the one Fumbus was messing about with at the moment. Various incomprehensible symbols had been scrawled across it, but one in particular stood out: the word “Droven” bearing the look of a signature more than footnotes of a technical schematic. </p> 
                   <p>“Droven showed Fumbus how to make something like this once,” the goblin said. “With better supplies, and different reagents, but I can make it work.”</p> 
                   <p>Intrigued, Valeros sat up on his elbows and studied the chart. “Your old half-orc buddy? You miss him a lot, don’t you, Fumbus? We’ve all lost friends, little guy, and I know it can be hard to move on.” He felt suddenly guilty for giving the goblin such a hard time.</p> 
                   <p>“Droven <em>is</em> lost,” Fumbus blurted with a surprising ferocity. “But he can help us even when he’s missing!</p> 
                   <p>“Huh?”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus ran down to the barrel halfway down the beach, tugging Valeros’s arm to follow. “Come, come! Make this way!” </p> 
                   <p>“For Cayden's sake, Fumbus, I just laid down!” </p> 
                   <p>When they reached the barrel, Fumbus snapped two shards of flint together, and a spark sprung to the oil-slick wick Valeros now saw dangled from one side. It began to fizzle and shorten.</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus gesticulated wildly at the cove below. “Into the sea it goes, unless you also want to explode!”</p> 
                   <p>“Oh, <em>those</em> kind of 'reagents!’ Well, why didn’t you say so in the first place?” </p> 
                   <p>With a curse, Valeros hefted the sputtering barrel on his shoulder and threw it as hard as he could down the beach. It bounced and arced into the water, floating out several yards… </p> 
                   <p>Suddenly, Fumbus threw up his arms, blocking his face, and Valeros copied him, just as the barrel exploded into a massive waterspout that shot straight up into the clear blue sky and dropped a curtain of seawater onto their heads, along with a shower of springs, cogs, and steaming twists of metal. He managed to grab a bronze tentacle out of the air before it landed on his head.</p> 
                   <p>An overturned clockwork vessel bobbed in the surf, semi ovoid and in the shape of an octopus’s head. Half of its grasping tentacles were severed and sputtered with silvery light. Some still grasped chests and gold statues and other valuables the apparatus had been trying to loot from the wreck on the ocean floor.</p> 
                   <p>Stumbling out one of the shattered bulbous portholes where the octopus’s eyes would be came the apparatus's operator, pale Chelaxian skin bleeding and satin finery shredded from numerous miniature shrapnel wounds.</p> 
                   <p>“Nice reflexes,” Fumbus said, nodding at the clockwork limb Valeros was still clutching.</p> 
                   <p>Valeros laughed mirthlessly. “Lying in wait for hapless ships to come by then scavenging their cargo, eh?” </p> 
                   <p>The Chelaxian coughed up seawater and tried to swing a boathook-like weapon in his general direction, but Valeros didn’t even bother drawing his sword. He backhanded the submariner across the face with the bronze tentacle and knocked him flat on his back in the surf.</p> 
                   <p>Valeros placed a heavy boot on the man’s chest, pushing him into the soft, wet sand. “You just let me know when you’re ready to tell me everything I want to know about whatever scam it is you’re running here.”</p> 
                   <p>“And where our friends are,” Fumbus demanded.</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah! Tell us what you know about them, too!” Valeros glanced back at the treeline. The rest of his party had been gone an unusually long time.</p> 
                   <p>The Chelaxian spat. “The others will have taken care of them by now. I was just sent to dig through the wreckage, but the others got to have…a lot more fun.”</p> 
                   <p>“Got another barrel like that in you, Fumbus?” Valeros frowned. “I have a feeling this chump and his metal contraption are going to be the least of our worries.”</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“No no no no <em>nononoooo</em>!”</p> 
                   <p>Trying frantically to keep his load of boxes and bushels more or less balanced, Hanish kicked at the grinning dog that was… well, that was dogging his path through the crowded Grand Bazaar. The big white mutt wagged its tail happily at the game, dodged his foot effortlessly, and darted back in for another try at the sausages spilling from an overstuffed hamper on Hanish’s hip.</p> 
                   <p>Hanish swore, but he couldn’t pause to fix the hamper or shoo the dog away. He was running late, and his customers were never patient. A double-humped camel, bent under its own mountain of chests and caskets, met his gaze with a long-lashed eye, and Hanish felt a profound understanding pass between them. Two beasts of burden, vital to the lifeblood of the city, but forever unappreciated.</p> 
                   <p>All around them, merchants and buyers haggled under a dizzying array of flags, banners, wicker arbors, and sun-bleached, dusty tents. Dried fruits and ribbed purple seedpods from the forests of Kyonin dangled from poles next to tables displaying thick white pelts from the halls of the Linnorm Kings, Qadiran brass pots that shone like gold, and spiked Nidalese shadowglass sculptures. Ink-painted scrolls advertised family businesses that had held the same market stalls for centuries, while a steel-feathered parrot perched on a passing woman’s shoulder screeched “Scales and teeth! Scales and teeth! Metal skymetal scales and teeth! From star-dead wastes of Numeria to you! Two days only! Scales and teeth!”</p> 
                   <p>Off to the right, a troupe of puppeteers was putting on a bedraggled but enthusiastic performance of “Iomedae’s Griffon” for an audience of enraptured youngsters and heckling drunks. Just as Hanish hustled by, the puppet-stage’s curtains blew open around a bellowing, steam-snorting contraption that was probably supposed to be Segruchen the Iron Gargoyle. The troupe’s musician banged her drums, the puppeteers shouted in rehearsed dismay, and a nearby packhorse reared and shrieked in panic, terrified by the clanking menace and its clamor.</p> 
                   <p>Hanish ducked around the animal’s flying hooves, congratulated himself for the quick save, and then promptly tripped over a boy wearing a gaudy sandwich board touting Gerig’s Liquid Courage, the drink of (mostly deceased) champions.</p> 
                   <p>“No no no no <em>nononoooo</em>!”</p> 
                   <p>Scarves and grapes and apples flying in his wake, Hanish windmilled his arms in a panicked jig under the swinging balance of his load. Finally he stumbled to a stop, panting and sweating but basically upright. A nearby street beggar applauded briefly. Hanish sketched a bow, or as much of one as he dared, and hurried onward. That dog was, somehow, still at his heels.</p>

                    <h3>Illustration by Mirco Paganessi from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021bz?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>.</h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Hanish spotted a break in the crowds and hurried through to a storefront festooned with bits of punched metal hung from silken strings. The chimes sparkled and sang against his load of packages as he knocked on the glass-gemmed door.</p> 
                   <p>“You’re late,” snapped the rotund half-orc who opened the door for him. Her tusks were painted with fanciful Osiriani hieroglyphs, and a jade Tien ornament hung from her earlobe, but her accent was as all Absalom. “I’ll wager you’ve stained and wrinkled my wares, too.”</p> 
                   <p>Hanish tapped the glowing bauble on his wrist. The bobbing crystal still shone blue: he’d made the delivery window. “Not late, and your scarves are pristine, Mistress Verity.” <em>Unlike poor Ghemel’s lunch</em>, he almost added, but then decided not to badmouth his own services. It was hard enough prying tips out of Mistress Verity already.</p> 
                   <p>The half-orc grunted, taking the heavy brown chest from Hanish’s aching arm and unlatching it with two quick flips. She ruffled through the fine embroidered silks and gossamer scarves, holding this one or that up to the light until she was satisfied that, indeed, Hanish had delivered the full load safely.</p> 
                   <p>She hauled the chest inside and tossed Hanish a pair of copper pennies. “Commemorative,” she said, and slammed her door.</p> 
                   <p>Hanish looked at the pitiful coins in his palm. They were commemorative, all right, but one celebrated the elevation of a new trademaster and the other was about some giant fish getting hauled out of the harbor, so neither was worth more than the copper it was stamped on. Mistress Verity’s generosity had struck again.</p> 
                   <p>The bauble on his wrist was starting to pulse violet. Hanish grimaced, rebalanced his remaining packages, and ran.</p> 
                   <p>He dropped the fruit and sausages at Ghemel’s — there was a decent tip, even though half the apples were bruised and the dog had managed to steal two sausages — and went on, faster now that the heaviest packages were gone. At Chivvi’s Apothecary, he dropped off a box of stonestalk eggs; the stiff-armored, distinctively shaped caterpillars had developed a predictable reputation as aphrodisiacs. At the Wandlin steam baths, he delivered frost teas and ice wines harvested from the Crown of the World and prized by heat-bathers in need of quick cooling.</p> 
                   <p>The last stop on his route was the best: Felifer’s Bibliovary, where priceless texts were framed like gems on bronze and silver shelves, and the air carried a deep, calming perfume of ancient wood and yellowing paper. Walking into Felifer’s was like stepping into a timeless, never-hurried world of learning, and it always made Hanish wistful for the life he’d never lead. Maybe if his parents had been richer, if they’d been able to afford more schooling… well, it was no use dreaming about all that.</p> 
                   <p>But for a few precious minutes, whenever he had a delivery at Felifer’s, he could breathe in that sepia-scented tranquility and pretend.</p> 
                   <p>The door was already ajar when Hanish arrived. “Hello?”</p> 
                   <p>There was no answer. Hanish stepped inside and set down his delivery box. The dog came with him, even though he’d already dropped off the sausages. The smell of blood was retch-thick in the shop, and the dog whined softly, lashing its tail.</p> 
                   <p>“Hello?”</p> 
                   <p>Nothing. Gulping, Hanish picked his way through the glowing bookshelves to Felifer’s back office. Shadows bobbed and spun away from him across the gleaming metal, teasing his eyes with premonitions of doom. The dog came with him, and though Hanish couldn’t help worrying that the old bookseller would scold him for bringing an animal into the shop, he was glad for its company. He didn’t want to be alone here.</p> 
                   <p>The back office was empty. Quiet. Nothing out of place except a paper-wrapped parcel on Felifer’s desk, a note written in the bookseller’s crabbed blue pen, and the sigil-stamped luminous tag that meant Hanish was meant to take it for delivery.</p> 
                   <p>Hanish bent closer to read the note. “To Pathfinder Agent Berovic, Skywatch. All speed.” That meant a breakneck run to deliver the parcel at any hour of the day or night, and triple pay if he made it within the hour. Right now, with the lull between Absalom’s daytime commerce and when the nightlife really lit up, the target should be easy to hit. Good money.</p> 
                   <p>But maybe dangerous. The last two words of the message were shaky and dribbled downward, as if Felifer were losing the strength to write. Bloody fingerprints marred the paper wrapping, which bulged and sagged in its strings with uncharacteristic sloppiness.</p> 
                   <p>The dog whined again. Hanish patted its head, then reached for the parcel. It was light and fragile-feeling, as though whatever was in there were dried, or hollow. Something rattled softly inside.</p> 
                   <p>Already the luminous tag was starting to lose its pearly pallor. If Hanish made to Skywatch while the light was still blue, he’d get triple pay.</p> 
                   <p>If he didn’t, he might land in something worse than he’d ever imagined.</p> 
                   <p>Well, it wouldn’t be the first time his job had careened him into trouble, and if Desna smiled on him, it wouldn’t be the last. The City at the Center of the World never slept, never stopped, and held uncountable adventures. Hanish had taken this job because he wanted to grab his share of those adventures, and so far, he’d gotten all that he could handle.</p> 
                   <p>Hanish tucked the parcel into his satchel, snapped its tag onto his bracelet, and ran.</p> 
                   <p>One more delivery today.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hello, Pathfinders and Starfinders! I wanted to take a moment here to discuss our current sanctioning status for both programs. We’ve had a lot of stuff roll out recently, and a lot more to come, so I wanted to get it all in one place.</p> 
                   <h2>Update of Sanctioning Documents</h2> 
                   <p>Last month, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shrt?Organized-Play-Update-Increased-Rewards-for">we announced a retroactive chance to some sanctioned adventures</a>, and I promised we’d be getting sanctioning documents updated shortly thereafter.</p> 
                   <p>Well. We’ve had…a busy few weeks. So I have not quite done that <em>yet</em>, at least not all of them. I am happy to report that the following adventures have updated sanctioning documents ready for download:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Pathfinder Adventures: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering"><em>The Slithering</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k1?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari"><em>Troubles in Otari</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence"><em>Malevolence</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023dx?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box"><em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em></a></li> 
                    <li>Pathfinder Adventure Paths: <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/extinctioncurse"><em>Extinction Curse</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationvaults"><em>Abomination Vaults</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsoftherubyphoenix"><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em></a></li> 
                    <li>Starfinder Adventures: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wy7?Starfinder-Beginner-Box"><em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em></a></li> 
                    <li>Starfinder Adventure Paths: <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationark"><em>The Devastation Ark</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyfreeordie"><em>Fly Free or Die</em></a></li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>The rest of the files are waiting on the art team to have time to make some changes I need from them. These updates aren’t as simple as “swap out text;” in most cases, we need to insert additional pages or rearrange what’s already there, which is a task that requires art’s expertise. So, we’ll keep plugging away at them as the art team has time between making the beautiful books we love. In the meantime, the blog post linked above takes precedence regarding the total rewards to be given out.</p> 
                   <h2>New Boons</h2> 
                   <p>Eagle-eyed players (and those who I pointed it out to) will notice that along with the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic"><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a> sanctioning, some new boons were added to the Boon Store for uncommon spells and archetypes, as well as some uncommon items from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide"><em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em></a>. If you didn’t notice, well, that’s why I’m pointing them out now!</p> 
                   <p>Going forward, it is my hope that we’ll be able to release these boons at the same time as the books are sanctioned. I don’t want to promise anything; sometimes we have a lot going on and it’s all we can do to get the book out close to street date [<em>eyes the upcoming October Monster nervously</em>], but it’s a goal of mine.</p> 
                   <h2>Coming Soon to a Character Options Page Near You</h2> 
                   <p>For my fellow Starfinders, the newest rulebook, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029v8?Starfinder-Tech-Revolution"><em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em></a>, has already been sanctioned and is now available on the Character Options page! Head over there and revolutionize your tech already, I don’t have a lot of other news for you yet. Next on the list will be <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027rz?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic"><em>Galactic Magic</em></a>, more on that as we approach street date.</p> 
                   <p>For the Pathfinders among us, obviously October is a double-punch of books, with the twin threats of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xo?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em></a>. Let me set expectations up front: I do not anticipate that both books will be ready on October 13 when they release.</p> 
                   <p>We’re only human, our volunteer review team is also only human, and we gave them a lot to do all at once. Our first priority is to get <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> sanctioned so you can start slinging guns and inventing gadgets. I will say that while both of the classes are uncommon, all Pathfinders will have access to them. After that, we’ll be aiming to get LOGB out the door as soon as we can, and we’ll keep you updated on its progress. Luckily, after this we get to rel—oh, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027u2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth"><em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em></a>? <em>And</em> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021bz?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens">the Absalom book</a>? Both in December, you say? Okay, well. We’ll do our best on those! More on that as we have it.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, Free RPG Day arrives on October 16th! The sanctioning documents for both of this year’s adventures, <em>Threshold of Knowledge</em> and <em>The Starfinder Four vs. the Hardlight Harlequin</em> are in their final stages, and we fully intend to have them up before the event. Keep in mind that while these adventures can be run on the 16th in conjunction with a participating local game store, they will not be available to the general public until one month later. If our sanctioning schedule slips on this, we’ll be sure to inform you all.</p> 
                   <p>I think that’s all the news I had to share! Before I go, I just want to thank everybody who makes the sanctioning possible: our volunteer Additional Resources team, who review the rulebooks and find all the ways to break our lovely game; Linda and the OP developers who review the AR feedback with me; and our art team who put together the PDF sanctioning documents for adventures, and who are really the unsung heroes of the process. I know I’m out here talking about the process most of the time, but it’s really a team effort, there’s no way I could do it on my own.</p> 
                   <p>Alright, that’s quite enough from me. Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And go build a weird new character!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Nhalmika Ironsight honors dwarven tradition, even as she wanders the surface world far from home. With her wide build, mane of dark hair, and amber eyes, Nhalmika is striking in any setting, but it’s the dwarven scattergun she keeps at hand that her friends and foes most remember.</p> 
                   <p>Nhalmika’s birth was a celebration. The third child of two prosperous dwarven merchants, Nhalmika became the final addition to a family larger than that of most dwarves in Dongun Hold. Her two older brothers doted on her, making simple crafts as presents and as their skill grew, the gifts they made became more artistic. She teethed on gold tiles engraved with the images of ancestors and slept beneath stone carvings of Dongun Hold’s greatest leaders. Nhalmika’s parents arranged for their children to have fine clothes and talented tutors but were too busy to have much to do with her upbringing.</p> 
                   <p>Everyone expected Nhalmika to become either an artisan like her brothers or a merchant like her parents. She had aptitude for neither. She was more skilled at judging art than creating, noticing tiny flaws such as an uneven line in a carving or a hairline crack in a gemstone or statue. She had a weakness for hard luck stories and pleas for credit, and her parents soon learned they couldn’t trust her with preserving the family finances. Her mother complained that Nhalmika’s eagerness to help others would put them out of business.</p> 
                   <p>Nhalmika instead preferred to play physical games and sports. Her athletic build and keen eye made her a natural champion, and her good sportsmanship made her popular with her peers. She surprised her family by declaring she would join the military, serving among the vanguards of Dongun Hold. Military service was an honorable, traditional calling and it seemed to suit her nature well. No one in her family mourned her departure for the training academy as much as Dargrim, a friend of her eldest brother and eager co-captain on most sports she played. Nhalmika had excellent vision, but she didn’t see Dargrim had given his whole heart to her.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/323c789b-7e51-4a42-a3f8-0307e601809a/IconicGunslinger_Nhalmika_keyart.jpg"><img width="500" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/323c789b-7e51-4a42-a3f8-0307e601809a/IconicGunslinger_Nhalmika_keyart.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="A middle-aged dwarven woman with dark, copper skin, amber eyes, and dark brown hair. She stands confidently, with a hand on her hip, the other resting a large dwarven scattergun over her shoulder"></a><em> Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</em> 
                   <p>In her training, Nhalmika gained familiarity with dwarven firearms of all types. She proved particularly adept with long rifles, but considered sniping to be dull and, truth be told, a little unfair. She preferred the noisy blasts of fuse bombs and scatterguns, which put her right in the action where she was needed most. Her family paled to hear her exuberant tales of lobbing grenades, packing enormous canisters of black powder, and taking a cannon’s recoil hard enough to fracture her shoulder.</p> 
                   <p>Only Dargrim appreciated that Nhalmika had found a calling she truly loved, and she found she loved Dargrim for it. The two were married just before her first deployment. Her parents arranged an opulent wedding in a traditional dwarven style and her brothers lavished the couple with necklaces made of her gold teething-tiles. Nhalmika and Dargrim left Dongun Hold as a couple—Nhalmika to serve as a guard to the Bridge of the Gods leading from Dongun Hold to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar and Dargrim to make their simple quarters a home over the next several years.</p> 
                   <p>The first time Nhalmika became pregnant, she was excused from duty for the birth and first year of her daughter’s life. She’d already earned a nickname, the Ironsight, and her commanding officer was sorry to lose her keen eyes overlooking trouble in the badlands below the bridge. Nhalmika doted on her daughter but was eager to return to duty. Upon her second pregnancy, Nhalmika’s commander predicted she wouldn’t return, but had underestimated her loyalty and integrity: Nhalmika reported the day after her son’s first birthday, ready to face bloodthirsty bandits and berserk clockworks with her scattergun in hand. Nhalmika’s third pregnancy was particularly difficult, and not the celebration her own birth had been. For weeks, the medics were certain they would lose both Nhalmika and the baby girl, yet both mother and daughter survived. Nhalmika’s youngest daughter, Ondla, was always sick and small, but had her mother’s grit. Nhalmika returned to duty a year later but spent all the time she could helping her children grow up. She got used to blasting mutant raiders one day and teaching dwarven history the next.</p> 
                   <p>Nhalmika’s children showed talents she lacked. Her eldest daughter went to carve exquisite statuary under her uncles’ tutelage and her son took up his grandparents’ affairs and proved to be a shrewd but honest merchant. Nhalmika and Dargrim were both proud of their children’s accomplishments, and never hesitant about saying so. Quiet and studious Ondla, whom neither parent would openly admit was their favorite, remained at home to tend to her father. Dargrim began showing symptoms of a serious degenerative disease. His head and hands shook, and he soon couldn’t stand. His decline was swift and his death both sudden and tragic. Ondla found solace and an unlikely romance with a human bookkeeper from Alkenstar, but Nhalmika was alone, and she was devastated. She numbly accepted the proffered retirement from the military, uncertain what she’d do next.</p> 
                   <p>Her grief was strong, but it isn’t in her nature to be idle or eschew serving others. Nhalmika has been a soldier and mother, but both her nation and children are moving on. She knows others beyond Dongun Hold and Alkenstar need her help. So Nhalmika settled her affairs, advised her children to work hard and love well, and left. She brought her dwarven scattergun from her time as a guard, a handful of medals, and a few of the gold teething-tiles her brothers gave her. Nhalmika has lived a full life, but she doesn’t think her best days are behind her—to the contrary, she’s ready to stand up for the downtrodden across Golarion. Her adventuring companions admire her skill with a gun, but they truly appreciate her grit, keen eyes, and motherly guidance.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Dust settled, leaving two figures behind in the carnage. One a looming mass of hulking muscle and teeth. The other a gnome, small, but—against all odds—still up.</p> 
                   <p>Torrick Wilderbark grasped the lever of his wheelchair in a white-knuckle grip, jaw set hard. His breaths came laboured, tongue caked with a layer of grit and grime. The warehouse lay shattered around them. Broken boards and timbers cracked further under the weight of his wheels. Behind him, the steam engine that powered his aid thrummed, vibrating against the seat in a steady rhythm.</p> 
                   <p>The troll had been pushed back, pulling itself out from under a pile of broken stone and cracked roof tiles. It mumbled a growl as it staggered upright, wobbly at first, but centering itself with every passing second. Dark blood oozed from its stunted snout. Torrick fumbled for the sword strapped behind the right wheel.</p> 
                   <p>His hand closed around air.</p> 
                   <p>An ice-cold wave of dread crashed over him. <em>His sword</em>. Pathetically trying to tamp down the rising panic in his throat, Torrick turned in the seat, twisting as far as he could as the safety belts bit into his thighs. Not only the sword but the scabbard was gone, too. The belt securing his gear must have snapped during the collapse, and, rattled by the all-consuming barrage of fractured stone and wood, he had failed to notice.</p> 
                   <p>Mere feet away, the troll whined in pain.</p> 
                   <p>Letting go of the lever, Torrick gripped the arms of the chair, straining further to look around him. The beast may be stunned for now, but it was rapidly regaining focus. Hard leather straps dug further into his legs, and he winced against it, taking in his surroundings.</p> 
                   <p>Nothing much was left of the warehouse. What little remained jutted out of the ground at odd angles, still crumbling. Splintered wood protruded like snapped bones, pinned by blasted chunks of stone and shattered glass. The alchemical bomb he’d tossed had certainly done the job. Torrick was lucky to be alive.</p> 
                   <p>But severely unluckily, the troll was, too.</p> 
                   <p>As his gaze scoured the rubble, a glint caught his eye—a flash of steel. A mere few feet away, snagged tight around a listing beam, was the remains of his gear, the belt pierced through by a nail and tangled about the shaft of the scabbard. And there, by some great mercy from the gods, hung his sword.</p> 
                   <p>He had no time to think, no plan. Every moment wasted was one in the monster’s favor. Torrick fell back down into his seat and clutched at the lever once more. The bubbling panic in his throat was not yet sated. He needed to get his sword. <em>Now</em>. Steam hissing, the engine roared up as the chair heeded his command, veering right and toward the dangling weapon. Debris clattered and cracked loudly under the wheels, but he couldn’t care less about the racket he was making. He was close, so close. The weapon hung before him, taunting. Torrick reached out, free arm straining as though he could somehow will it into his hand.</p> 
                   <p><em>Come on</em>, he thought, pleaded. To any deity that cared to listen. The chair stopped, his fingers barely made contact, ghosting over the handle of the blade. He needed to get just a little higher, reach a little further, then he could—</p> 
                   <p>A thunderous roar shook the very ground.</p> 
                   <p>Torrick spat a curse.</p> 
                   <p>Heavy footfalls, blackened claws scraping. It lumbered closer, with a loping gait that swiftly ate away at the distance between them. Torrick’s pulse pounded in his ears as he fumbled. Another roar, a deep bellowing sound that vibrated in his chest and sent him frantic, straining to reach higher, shoulder burning in its socket, hips protesting at the bruising line of the security belt.</p> 
                   <p><em>Almost there. Just a little further. Come on. Please—</em></p> 
                   <p>The troll fell upon him in a flurry of limbs and gnashing tusks. Torrick immediately dropped back into the seat, tucking in as small as he could as the pressing weight of the angered beast threatened to consume him. In its rage, it had overshot its mark, instead grappling the frame of the wheelchair and barely missing Torrick’s body; the tips of razor-sharp claws snagging on his armor.</p> 
                   <p>And yet hope. Clutched in his hand, cool against sweaty fingers, was the sword. Held in a white-knuckle grip.</p> 
                   <p>Lunging again for the lever, Torrick twisted awkwardly to avoid the troll knocking the weapon out of his hand. He pulled hard enough that the metal screeched and the engine almost backfired, revving so loudly it almost drowned out the sound of heavy-set limbs pawing at the wheels. Lurching abruptly backward, the chair shunted its way out from under the troll’s crushing form, the creature’s claws scrabbling at the frame.</p> 
                   <p>With the chair now pulled out from under it, the monster stumbled to adjust and pitched forward, grunting in confusion, its brow furrowed deep and hard. Torrick wasted no time, taking no chances as he let go of the shaft and slipped a vial from a pouch at his belt, smashing it against the flat of his blade as the wheelchair continued to roll back on its own.</p> 
                   <p>The vial shattered easily, oil inside bleeding down the groove before reacting with the air. The effect was immediate: a tongue of fire that blazed brightly. With a victorious bark of laughter, Torrick kicked the lever forward once more with his foot, using both arms to drive all the strength he had into a wide swing.</p>

                   <p>Green flesh parted easily, black ichor slicking his hands, but not enough to douse the alchemical flames that burned crimson on cold steel. The troll screeched, reeling back and away as it was almost gutted in one fell blow. Barrelling past a few feet, Torrick pulled the wheelchair around in a wide arc, throwing up dust and debris in a trail.</p> 
                   <p>Wild with fury, the beast turned on him, yellow eyes wide and tusks bared. Fiery sword still in one hand, Torrick grinned and gripped the lever once more. Now the real fight would begin.</p>

                   <p>Everyone across the galaxy enjoys the occasional diversion in a holographic amusement chamber, whether it’s relaxing on a sandy beach or taking part in an action-packed adventure on a war-torn battlefield from the safety of home. But what happens when the digital settings and inhabitants of these simulations come to life and threaten a group of innocent fun seekers?</p> 
                   <p>Thanks to some inadvertently malicious code created by a proud game designer, such a calamitous event has occurred on a small moon hosting an entertainment expo! The building is slowly but surely being digitized while the game designer’s mind has been taken over by a comic-book villain. Only a group of newly recruited Starfinders can save the day!</p>

A while back, I was discussing real-world current events that caused shipping delays with some friends, and someone jokingly commented that it would make a great Starfinder Society scenario. I couldn’t get the thought out of my head, and as I let the idea percolate, it kept getting weirder and weirder. How weird is it?

                   <p itemprop="description">Hiya, Starfinders! I have something special for you this month. A while back, I was discussing real-world current events that caused shipping delays with some friends, and someone jokingly commented that it would make a great Starfinder Society scenario. I couldn’t get the thought out of my head, and as I let the idea percolate, it kept getting weirder and weirder. How weird is it? Well, let’s just say the Society might solve a shipping crisis in more than one way.</p> 
                   <p>This month, a group of Starfinders traveling in deep space encounter a distress beacon from a stalled cargo freighter. Once they investigate, they learn that the ship belongs to Multifold Industries, and that there’s something more to this problem than meets the eye. The mission is simple in theory: board the ship, assess it for damage, make any onsite repairs possible, and contact Multifold. Not a bad way to earn some credits, right? Ah, if only things were ever that easy…</p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u2?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-408-Precious-Cargo">Starfinder Society #4-08: Precious Cargo</a></em> is an adventure for levels 1–4. The amazing Diego Valdez was my partner in crime for this one. We had a blast crafting this idea together, and he did an excellent job writing it—so check it out!</p>

                   <p>Hello again, Pathfinders! We’ve got two exciting scenarios for you in September, one of which continues the ongoing story of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries, and one of which is a standalone adventure taking place in the Mwangi Expanse!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f7330bdc-d7a8-4675-a430-d036777577da/092321_Eloise.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f7330bdc-d7a8-4675-a430-d036777577da/092321_Eloise.png" align="left" width="400" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="artist Samuel Jr: the ghost of a young woman with loose long hair, glowing yellow eyes, and her skirt and shawl billowing around her"></a>

                   <p>First, a group of Pathfinder agents travel to Almas, the capital of the free nation of Andoran, to present a legal defense of the Society’s claim to the Cathedral of Aroden. Losing one of their most significant lodges in Andoran would be a devastating blow to the Society, but when these agents arrive, they find that legal troubles are the least of their worries. A troubled ghost stalks the nearby streets and seems to be accusing the Pathfinder Society of heinous deeds! Can the agents learn the truth behind the ghost’s message and prevent the Society’s precarious position in Almas from crumbling? </p> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-302-The-East-Hill-Haunting"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-02: The East Hill Haunting</em></a> is the first scenario in a two-part Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot arc related to strange events befalling the Pathfinder Society’s lodge in Almas, Andoran. It is an adventure for levels 1–4, written by Nicole Heits.</p> 
                   <p>Next up, we have an adventure that follows another group of Pathfinders to Anthusis, the capital of Vidrian. The Pathfinder Society has been working to return looted relics to communities in this recently liberated nation in the Mwangi Expanse. Recently, the Society seized an opportunistic relic hunter’s ship and discovered a magic bell that appeared to contain protective magic to ward against ravenous fey. Venture-Captain Finze Bellaugh has sent out an urgent call for Pathfinder agents to discover where the bell came from and return it to its rightful owners as quickly as possible. To learn the bell’s true purpose and history, the Pathfinder agents must journey deep into the Laughing Jungle—where hopefully, they’ll meet more friends than foes!</p>

                   <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate! And would somebody please get me some sovereign glue to hold these sanctuaries together!</p>

That's right, last month we assembled the Order for another marathon session of Ron Lundeen's module, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering"><em>The Slithering</em></a>. The August humidity in New Jersey was enough to curl even the sturdiest character sheet, but we embraced it as part of our Mwangi experience and came out alive (mostly, see below).</p> 
                   <p>Once again, we pushed the envelope of gaming immersion and paid homage to an adventure that boldly featured so many oozes. Our five-gallon bucket of slime was ready at the table for anyone who suffered a hit from an ooze; for each hit a character received, that player had to stick their hand into the bucket and retrieve one of the dice that could be found at the bottom. This is OAD after all, so this time we made it tougher by cutting back on the number of dice in the bucket. How long it took you to find one was what really defined the experience!</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><b>Module</b>: The Slithering</li> 
                    <li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 60 hours, 15 minutes</li> 
                    <li><b>Session Hours</b>: 37 hours, 45 minutes</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>The Order has between 10 and 15 active members at any given time, and every roster is unique to each project. As we mentioned before, the team for The Slithering Salve differed from our other projects in that we had ages ranging from 47 to 14, and experience varying from veterans with over 30 years' experience to a complete newcomer to Pathfinder. We also ate well during this marathon, since cookies are a meal when you're in the Order, and we had none other than Karee Vogrin of <a href="https://criticalhitcookies.com/">Critical Hit Cookies</a> returning as Lini! Finally, our GM tapped three additional members for live NPC roles throughout the adventure.</p>

                   <h3>Highlights From <em>The Slithering</em>:</h3> 
                   <p>□ The journey to Holy Xatramba was more Mwangi than we expected from this adventure—a welcome surprise. Our favorite encounter of the trek was a 300-foot-long rope bridge that disappeared into the dense foliage, and we didn't notice the trio of jungle drakes until one of them slammed down behind Fumbus. It should probably be noted that the goblin was a couple hundred feet ahead of the party. Time to burn those Hero Points, kid.</p> 
                   <p>□ Kibwe had become a mess by the time we returned to try to rid the city of the <em>slithering</em> curse. We watched as the owner of a semi-domesticated triceratops melted into ooze, which slid down the side of the now-angry beast. As the dinosaur rampaged toward the party, Lini and Korakai stood their ground, putting our hopes on Wild Empathy and a <em>calm emotions</em> spell. The result of its Will save vs. spell? Natural 1. </p> 
                   <p>□ The Order always embraces a hearty PvP bout when it's forced upon us. Heck, we even see it as a great opportunity for some trash-talking around the table! When an encounter with two specters resulted in our first PF 2.0 showdown between Jirelle and Zithembe (fighter), the bets were placed and both players' best dice came out. Out of game, this was Auralee's (Jirelle) first time playing Pathfinder, and she was up against Erick, a sixteen-year veteran with more notches on his belt from dropping other players than anyone in the Order. They went solid for seven rounds and it came down to the last hit, but Erick defended his title. </p> 
                   <p>□ Juno Reactor's "Conga Fury" blasted away on the stereo during a couple of heated battles in this adventure, but it wasn't louder than our GM when the Amber Die dropped yet another signature 20-20-20. Adam always says afterwards: Still got it.</p> 
                   <p>□ We continued to use the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024tn?Pathfinder-Critical-Hit-Deck">Critical Hit Deck</a> and Critical Fumble Deck, with the deadly variant applied, causing a card to be drawn on any crits (not just natural 20s). In total, we saw a whopping 108 critical hits and 70 fumbles throughout the entire module. A few of our favorites from the decks included Jirelle losing a thumb, suffering 3d6+2 persistent bleed damage in another battle, and also being stupefied, frightened, and restrained from a set of nasty fumbles in a later fight. It went both ways though, and we watched a jungle drake kill itself with its own stinger!</p>

                   <h3>The Salve:</h3> 
                   <p>We went into this adventure with the notion that it would be about things that slithered; however, what made this project such a unique experience was not the plethora of oozes we faced, but the epidemic-like experience that involved the spread of the <em>slithering</em> curse itself. The curse was transmitted through contact between creatures, and despite attempts to gather additional information, we didn't know as much as we wanted to know about it. The only way to be truly safe (until our heroes could end the curse) was to isolate and distance from others. It was surreal returning to Kibwe near the end of the adventure to find the population avoiding each other on the street, hiding in their homes, and wearing masks. You can see where this is going; playing this module in 2020–2021 was an experience we'll never forget—one that bonded us even more tightly as a gaming group. While the Order has played over 150 modules, we can't understate what it felt like to roleplay through this one. We found solace in our ability to end the spreading curse, and just like the real-life events that surrounded this project, decades from now the Order will still be talking about that time we played <em>The Slithering</em>.</p>

                   <h3>Character Deaths:</h3> 
                   <p>Ron Lundeen has put plenty of our characters in the ground <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgur?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-5">over the years</a>, and he did it again here with a double-babau ambush that caught us off guard. Skuulkush, our party's lizardfolk guide, bravely allowed himself to be flanked in an effort to buy time. At least it was quick. </p> 
                   <h3>Best Quote from Marathon 2:</h3> 
                   <p>(Fumbus returns out of breath after two characters were lost scouting the ruins)</p> 
                   <p>Lini: "What happened? What did you find?"<br> Fumbus: "Through those doors there is... a magical... mind-controlling... DINOSAUR that takes your hands!" </p> 
                   <h3>Conclusion:</h3> 
                   <p>Escorting the ancient Pillar-Watcher known as Cursebreaker back to the city of Kibwe (or simply chasing after it) was a mechanic that compounded the sense of urgency we already felt throughout the adventure. We struggled to keep up with the construct, driven by powerful magic, as it smashed its way through the Aspis Consortium agents who tried to block its destination. We were fortunate to have front-row seats when an alchemical golem also tried to stand in its way, and the resulting melee was a fantastic primer for the final battle to come. In the end, we managed to get the heavily damaged Pillar-Watcher back to the dais where it belonged so that we could perform the ritual required to end the curse. A win for Kibwe and the Order!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">In the month since we announced our latest class playtest, there’ve been rumors, speculation, and Pathfinder fans across the internet connecting the threads of what the next book could be. Appropriate, since I can now say that our newest rulebook will be the paranormal <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>, releasing at Gen Con 2022!</p> 
                   <p>Golarion is a fantastic world filled with the impossible. A city returned from the depths of time. A chasm to the Abyss, only recently sealed. A fallen star granting godhood. Yet even in a world where anything is possible, there are always further depths and stranger phenomena on the fringes of understanding. The Dark Archive contains material for players and GMs alike to bring cryptids, temporal anomalies, and other paranormal phenomena to their game tables. And of course, two new character classes that investigate the unknown: the psychic and the thaumaturge!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Thaleon, the iconic psychic, and Mios, the iconic thaumaturge. Sketches by Wayne Reynolds.</p>
                   </div> 
                   <p>The psychic is a spontaneous occult spellcaster whose magic comes from the unique interplay of their conscious and subconscious mind. Do you see others’ thoughts as a precise, ordered sequence, or do objects fly when you experience strong feelings? Whatever kind of psychic you build, you’ll have a bevy of psi cantrips to cast at will and to amplify with Focus Points for extra power or versatility. When the time is right, unleash your mind in a storm of psychic magic—though beware the risks!</p> 
                   <p>The thaumaturge is the quintessential collector of superstitions: the adventurer who’s heard every story and always has the right tool or charm for any threat. The thaumaturge is in part a reconceptualization of the themes that went into First Edition’s occultist class, so of course, you’ll have a mystic implement (or three) to wield, along with the unique ability to identify and capitalize on an enemy’s weaknesses. You can further customize your character with supernatural tricks taken from all four magical traditions, warding circles, and even pacts with powerful entities!</p> 
                   <p>With two new classes, we also have two new adventurers joining the ranks of iconic Pathfinder characters. While we won’t be revealing their full backstories until the book is closer to release, I’ll turn things over to their authors for a brief introduction:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><b>Thaleon, the Iconic Psychic:</b><br> Thaleon is an artist whose creative vision reaches beyond the physical world into unseen realms. Hailing from Rahadoum, a land where religion is forbidden, he believes that effort is the foundation of change and that each person has a duty to cultivate their own talents and use them to shape society for the better. Thaleon embraces his ties to the psychic forces that flow from his emotions and strives to understand them, even as they sometimes surge beyond his control. </p> 
                    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Linda Zayas-Palmer<br> <em>Development Manager</em></p> 
                    <p><b>Mios, the Iconic Thaumaturge</b><br> As a young adult driving their night coach on the streets of Ustalav, Mios was attacked by a creature and afflicted with a terrible curse. After hunting through rumors by the light of their coach’s lantern, they managed to save themself by piecing together a cure. Now aged into an experienced monster hunter, Mios believes in second chances but not third ones, fearing neither evil nor death.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">My <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43h04?Staff-Change-Update-from-Paizo-President-Jeff">public statement</a> on Wednesday was a fundamental expression of Paizo’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, values that I share both personally and professionally. It was an opening statement—not the final word on the topic by any means.</p> 
                   <p>Words are important. </p> 
                   <p>But I also know that actions are even more important. </p> 
                   <p>As a result, I want to share with you a number of actions that address some of the concerns that have been brought to our attention over the last week. </p> 
                   <p>The welfare and safety of our employees is paramount. No employee will ever be fired for whistleblowing or advocating for employee safety and wellbeing, and we have never fired an employee for doing so.</p> 
                   <p>Following our return from Gen Con, the Executive Team will schedule individual meetings with our managers to give them a chance to share concerns directly. In the coming weeks, Paizo will issue an independently managed employee engagement survey to provide all employees with an anonymous means to provide candid feedback. The information provided through this process is aimed at addressing employee concerns and driving change to create a more positive workplace.</p> 
                   <p>We take all claims of harassment seriously. Our CEO Lisa Stevens released a statement in 2019 that underscores Paizo’s stance on this matter, and it applies today as well. You can read that here: <a href="https://paizo.com/community/guidelines">https://paizo.com/community/guidelines</a>.</p> 
                   <p>We held staff-wide in person anti-harassment training in 2018 and initiated annual mandatory online training earlier in 2021.</p> 
                   <p>We are currently finalizing a job description to fill a vacant full-time HR position. You’ll see this posted in the next few business days, and we’ll be looking for a candidate with expertise in diversity, equity, and inclusion. It is important to all of us that this professional can help us to maintain Paizo’s shared commitment to our values in recruitment, hiring, and daily operations.</p> 
                   <p>In the meantime, we are encouraging our employees to make use of the free independent human resources hotline Paizo initiated in 2018, where they can report grievances of any kind in complete confidentiality.</p> 
                   <p>Paizo makes decisions about employee convention attendance based on the business and community needs of the show, irrespective of gender or gender identity. However, it is time that Paizo evolves from the longtime practice of employees sharing rooms during convention and business travel. As such, we have enacted a one-employee-per-room policy that will be our standard moving forward. Employees can request to share a room if they so choose. </p> 
                   <p>We are extending Paizo’s existing work-from-home timeline through at least the end of the year. Employees that want to work from the office can continue to do so but will need to abide by the company’s existing vaccination and mask policies. We will continue to follow CDC guidelines and keep our employees as safe as possible during the pandemic by offering work-from-home and a safe office space for those who prefer that option.</p> 
                   <p>Over the last several years, we have invested heavily in Project Management to help the company get a better sense of workload in the Creative Department, implementing company-wide project management software and increasing the size of the project management team. This work has already resulted in increased production schedule lead times, and Paizo will continue to leverage this valuable resource to provide better work/life balances for our employees.</p> 
                   <p>In the same period, the creation of additional management positions within the Creative Department has also helped give staff better access to managers, and to empower those managers to better gauge deadlines and workloads. As with our Project Management initiatives, this is an ongoing process, but it is already bearing fruit and improving not just Paizo’s products, but the lives of the brilliant creatives who make them possible.</p> 
                   <p>To clear up some confusion that has worked its way into the conversation, freelancer relations remains the purview of the Creative Department. Paizo freelancers who appreciate their strong relationship with our developers, editors, and art team can be assured that we have made no changes on this front. </p> 
                   <p>Finally, based on feedback from the staff, we changed professional cleaning services in 2017, and the offices have been cleaned and vacuumed on a regular basis since then.</p> 
                   <p>These aren’t the only things we are doing. We are building strategies to address the challenges facing the company and will strive to be more transparent about our plans as we build stronger lines of communication with everyone at Paizo. We are committed to listening. We are committed to continuing to improve based on the feedback of our teams. There will be more messages, and more concrete actions, to come.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">The concept of the beginning of a year is a bit of a strange one for those of us on the Organized Play team. The turning of a year on the calendar is far less prominent in our workflow than the beginning of a new season of Organized Play adventures.</p> 
                   <p>The process of making an Organized Play season starts long before we release the first hints of its overarching plotline. In fact, the first seeds are often planted years in advance, written in the haziest and most tentative of chalk lines as developers build in adventure hooks that they’d love to follow up on in the future. More formally, though, the planning process begins about 4 months after the start of the previous Organized Play year. The developer in charge of the line outlines an overarching metaplot, decides roughly how many scenarios it should include, and does research into existing products to make sure that their plans fit well into the canon. This outline undergoes several rounds of discussion and refinement. After it receives approval from all of the stakeholders, we set about giving the year its key identifying features: a name, a logo, and a defining piece of art to represent it. </p> 
                   <p>Once we’ve got a broad sense of what the plan for the year is, it’s time to refine it and fit it to the adventure schedule. This process starts with making a plan for what levels of adventure should release each month. There’s a balancing act between producing more of the broadly accessible low-level content that helps to bring experienced and new players together, and producing higher-level content that lets dedicated players enjoy their PCs’ growth. Levels and story beats work together to help make adventures; the sorts of plots that are appropriate for 1st-level PCs are rarely suitable for 8th-level ones, and vice versa, so getting a schedule in place requires a dance between these two considerations.</p> 
                   <p>Another factor we consider when plotting adventures is providing diversity of type, theme, and location. In addition to searching lists of scenario locations for places we haven’t given a lot of attention, we like to mix things up. To name a few of the balances we consider, we look at offering both urban and wilderness adventures, both roleplay-heavy adventures where skills come to the forefront and combat-focused dungeon crawls, and both scenarios that provide unambiguous victories and those that leave dangling hooks for us to pick up in the future or pose questions for players to ponder. On top of these considerations, we also want to be sure that there are adventures that appeal to PCs in each of the major factions. When the metaplot steers us heavily toward particular types of scenarios, we use adventures that aren’t part of the metaplot to fill in the gaps.</p> 
                   <p>For all this planning, though, the digital nature of Organized Play adventures gives us significant flexibility. If a developer wants to completely change an adventure to respond to unexpected data from reporting conditions, or goes on a walk and comes back with a great story idea, then there’s plenty of room to adjust. If an author comes up with an amazing NPC that would make a compelling recurring character, we have space to make that happen. With no printer deadlines to worry about, nothing is canon until the first PDF hits a fan’s inbox, and we make the most of that potential.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Today at Gen Con, we announced a new way for members of the Pathfinder and Starfinder communities to create content to expand the brands and make a lasting mark on the games we all love: Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite.</p> 
                   <p>Beginning on October 13, 2021, content creators will be able to sell adventures, fiction, setting supplements, rules expansions, maps, art packs, and more using Paizo’s intellectual property. That means that you can, for the first time, write an RPG supplement set in the official Pathfinder or Starfinder settings that references our locations, organizations, characters, deities and more, and sell it to your fellow players and GMs. </p> 
                   <p>Want to tell the story of Kyra and Merisiel’s adventures on what they’d hoped would be a restful honeymoon? Now you can!</p> 
                   <p>What about that side quest adventure you’ve always wanted to share to support your favorite Pathfinder Adventure Path? Now’s the time!</p> 
                   <p>How about that custom character class or alien species you made for your Starfinder campaign that you just know others are going to love? Yep, that too.</p> 
                   <p>Our partners at OneBookShelf (DriveThruRPG, DriveThruCards, Astral Tabletop) will be hosting and managing the program, bringing years of experience running similar community content marketplaces for other tabletop properties to bear. </p> 
                   <p>Check out the content creation guidelines, frequently asked questions, and the starter layout templates and art assets available to community creators at <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/" target="_blank">pathfinderinfinite.com</a> and <a href="https://www.starfinderinfinite.com/" target="_blank">starfinderinfinite.com</a>.</p> 
                   <p>We’ll have more information to share in the coming weeks, but the real excitement won’t start until all of you can share your Pathfinder and Starfinder creations with the world in just under a month. I’m looking forward to seeing what incredible things you come up with!</p>

Pathfinder has gone beyond fantasy Aztecs and Mayans to find creatures for their bestiaries, but when one of Legendary Game’s authors pitched a campaign setting based on his Puerto Rican Taino heritage, a new project was born.</p> 
                   <p>The <em><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legendarygames/boricubos-latin-american-monsters-and-adventures?ref=rwcxin">Boricubos and Latin American Monsters</a></em><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legendarygames/boricubos-latin-american-monsters-and-adventures?ref=rwcxin"> Kickstarter</a> draws on the mythology of Central and South America and the Caribbean, from Puerto Rico to Paraguay, with a talented team including nearly 20 Latinx authors and artists! It includes two books—the <em>Boricubos: The Lost Isles</em> campaign setting and the <em>Latin American Monsters</em> bestiary, each with over 120 pages and available for <b>Pathfinder Second Edition</b>, <b>Pathfinder RPG</b>, and <b>DnD 5E</b>!</p> 
                   <p><em>Latin American Monsters</em> is a massive 120-page bestiary of incredible creatures from Central and South America and the Caribbean, from abúhukü to zuvembie! You'll find divine protectors like the magui alongside the seductive sihuanaba and Xipe Totec the Flayed Lord, forest fey like the backward-footed curupira and acalica weather-woses, and deathless terrors like the carreta nagua harvesting the dead. Titanic boiuna serpents destroy what the araganaqlta’a king snakes guard, while forest-mother madremontes guard the beauty of the wild, including monstrous versions of real-world creatures like the anaconda, black caiman, and giant mantis shrimp! </p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Today marks one week until Gen Con Online! Nothing about that sentence is stressful at all, nope. Let’s take a look at some of our upcoming events!</p> 
                   <h2>Stream Highlights</h2> 
                   <p>All weekend, we’ll be streaming liveplays with our partners, as well as panels with Paizo staffers to tell you all about our upcoming products. While every panel is a must-see, here are some of the highlights, as chosen by me (coworkers feel free to disagree with me in my DMs):</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><b>Keynote</b> (Thursday 3pm EDT): Join Erik Mona as he talks as fast as he possibly can while spilling as much information about the next year of products as possible! I think his slideshow has clocked in somewhere around 70 slides of beautiful art, so you won’t want to miss this one.</li> 
                    <li><b>Catching Up with Paizo Organized Play</b> (Thursday, 5pm EDT): Obviously I’m biased on this one, but Mike Kimmel and Jenny Jarzabski have #plans, and they’ll be teasing some of those plans live with me and Linda!</li> 
                    <li><b>Pathfinder Designer Showcase</b> (Friday, 4pm EDT): The Pathfinder Design Team is going to, somehow, talk about every upcoming book in just one hour! This may or may not include details on books Erik announces in his Keynote…</li> 
                    <li><b>Ask Paizo Anything: Pathfinder</b> (Saturday, 5pm EDT) and Starfinder (Saturday, 6pm EDT): We mean it, literally anything about the world. Want to know where the best meal in Nantambu is? Dying to find out what the runes of Eloritu mean? Come here and ask the teams behind our games your burning questions! *answers not guaranteed, results may vary</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>You can see the full stream schedule for the weekend on our <a href="https://paizo.com/gencon">Gen Con landing page</a>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Let’s Play Some Games</h2> 
                   <p>This year, we have over 500 games scheduled for Gen Con Online! Tickets for many of them are <a href="https://www.gencon.com/events?host=Paizo+Inc." target="_blank">still available on Gen Con’s website</a>; ticket sales won’t close until the game starts, but many of them will fill up, so don’t delay! Here are some of my favorite scenarios we’re running this weekend:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><b>PFS 3-99 Fate in the Future and SFS 3-99 Perils of the Past</b>: This year’s interactive special is premiering as our flagship event. Join us on Friday afternoon for the PFS event and Saturday afternoon for the SFS event, as our first-ever linked special takes you on a journey through time and space to solve an anomaly and reunite lost adventurers. We can’t wait for you all to experience this year’s adventure; tickets are still available for both events, so don’t wait, grab one today!</li> 
                    <li>If you want to dive right into our ongoing storylines, definitely check out <b>PFS Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</b> and <b>SFS Intro: Year of the Data Scourge</b>. These repeatable adventures will get you right into the action, whether you’re a first-time adventurer or a long-time player!</li> 
                    <li>For our experienced Pathfinders, we have the entirety of the <b>Breaking the Storm</b> arc running throughout the weekend. This high-level arc brings last year’s metaplot to a close and is a real challenge for experienced characters.</li> 
                    <li>For my fellow Starfinders, we’ve got a diverse array of scenarios, including <b>Secrets of Stillness</b>, where you’re asked to solve a mystery by one of the faction leaders; <b>Combatant’s Concerto: Prelude to Revolution</b>, in which a party becomes a sinister plot; and <b>A Waltz Through Myriad Worlds</b>, a quest pack where you’ll get to experience four alternate timelines and discover their secrets. All these and more have tickets available!</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Don’t forget to <a href="http://paizo.events/">join our Discord server</a> to get set up for your games; we’ll be hanging out there all weekend!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Charity Auction</h2> 
                   <p>As in previous years, we will be running a charity auction to benefit Gen Con’s charity partners: <a href="https://www.takethis.org/" target="_blank">Take This</a> and <a href="https://www.trinityhavenindy.org/" target="_blank">Trinity Haven</a>. You can read more about both organizations on their websites or at Gen Con’s charity homepage. Last year we raised over $10,000 for charity with boons and other products, and while we’re not ready to announce what we’re auctioning off yet, we hope you’ll join us in raising money for these worthy causes.</p> 
                   <p>We can’t wait to see you all at Gen Con Online, September 16-19! If you have any questions, <a href="http://paizo.events/">join our Discord</a> and we’ll help you get ready for the event. Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And stock up on easy-to-prep meals!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">The earth shook. To Iphra, the rumbling sounded like a passing heavy transport. She realized she wouldn’t maintain her footing. Iphra fired her jump jets. Being in the air stabilized her enough to avoid a nasty fall from the ridgetop she had been standing on.</p> 
                   <p>The tremor passed.</p> 
                   <p>“Sergeant Udrinnel, report. End.” It was Lieutenant Markalane from the shuttle a couple miles away, her voice calm but insistent.</p> 
                   <p>“I’m fine. That was a good one, eh, lieutenant? End,” said Iphra.</p> 
                   <p>“Affirmative, sergeant. Our engineer clocked it at a solid six on the imperial scale. Deploy your final booster and return to the shuttle. Aftershocks are anticipated. End.”</p> 
                   <p>“Acknowledged. End,” said Iphra.</p> 
                   <p>Her mind wandered. She ignored Markalane checking in with other scouts. Iphra thought of the engineer, Winya, a gosclaw. Long, supple, feline—a real pro. Winya’s briefing had warned of quakes on Grodrum, but this one was the first the survey team had experienced.</p> 
                   <p>Iphra looked for the safest way to descend the ridge, glancing at the map on her visor’s head-up display. Her final deployment marker lay half a mile away in a valley to the east. The landscape was barren, but it wasn’t boring. Minerals and crystals on Grodrum—the reason the survey team came here—gave the planet a multihued aspect that could be breathtaking.</p> 
                   <p>Equally stunning was the Locus, an eerie, starlike body that illuminated this system. The briefing had said it was magical, not a “real” star, whatever that meant. Iphra turned to face it. The Locus hung low in the sky, shedding its white light through the thin atmosphere. Grodrum’s long day was dwindling.</p> 
                   <p>Iphra began her descent, using her jump jets to avoid treacherous gaps. About halfway down, the ground shuddered again. A crashing sound to Iphra’s right sent her heart into her throat and activated her instincts. She fired her jump jets and leapt. Part of the ridge slid away under her, and she descended onto moving rock. Iphra fired her jump jets again.</p> 
                   <p>“Come on! Come on! Come on!”</p> 
                   <p>The second leap threw her clear of the slide zone. Iphra took cover on the downhill side of a solid-looking outcropping and crouched, leaning against the rock. She closed her eyes and caught her breath. Then, as she opened her eyes again, she spotted it: a jagged, beautiful pinnacle of white crystal jutted from the valley below. It hadn’t been there before. Iphra looked at her deployment marker and saw that the crystal wasn’t too far from it. A little north.</p> 
                   <p>“Sergeant Udrinnel?! Please respond! End!”</p> 
                   <p>Iphra realized she must have missed a communication from the lieutenant.</p> 
                   <p>“Udrinnel here. Uh, I’m good. A little landslide, but we’re good. Uh… and lieutenant, a mass of crystal erupted from the planet’s surface near my deployment marker. Sending you a visual. Any change in my orders? End.”</p> 
                   <p>“Stand by. But keep safe, sergeant. End.”</p> 
                   <p>Iphra descended toward the deployment marker as she waited. When she reached level ground, she turned and looked back up the ridge, standing in the shadow of the hills. The landslide had revealed a fissure in the rock, or the quake had cracked the slope.</p> 
                   <p>“Sergeant, proceed as planned. I’ve been advised the booster you’re deploying will still allow us a detailed scan of that crystal from our location. The concern is the area near the crystal might be unstable. Get it done and return to the shuttle. Let’s call it a day. End.”</p> 
                   <p>“Aye, lieutenant. End,” said Iphra.</p> 
                   <p>Disappointment rose. It would’ve been nice to see that crystal up close. To touch it. That sort of thing makes being a scout one of the best jobs in the imperial military. But orders were orders. Besides, Iphra supposed she might have another chance, after scans verified the area’s stability and geological content. She turned, stood, and gazed. The crystal’s tip glistened in the waning light of the Locus.</p> 
                   <p>“Contact, contact!” The voice of Sergeant Enosh, another scout, erupted over the comm. Assault rifle bursts were audible in the background.</p> 
                   <p>Iphra recalled the mission brief. Orbital probes had shown Grodrum bore only simple surface life. Nothing should be here to shoot at. Still, Iphra unslung her rifle as Lieutenant Markalane’s voice broke in over the comm again.</p> 
                   <p>Iphra heard only the start of that exchange. In her peripheral vision, something massive, amorphous, and multilimbed emerged from the shadow on the rocky slope to her left. It struck Iphra three times before she could react. She fell. The impact knocked the wind out of her. Pain along her flank suggested broken ribs. Environmental force fields kicked on, patching cracks in the armor on her left arm and side.</p> 
                   <p>The creature loomed over her, blocking the sky. It slid its malleable arms around her. Numerous orbs that glowed with white light focused on her, burning with malevolence. Were they eyes? Was this thing sapient?</p> 
                   <p>The thoughts came unbidden. Iphra raised her rifle, levering it into automatic mode by muscle memory more than intent. She pressed the trigger. Horrid shrieking drowned out the rifle’s reports.</p> 
                   <p>The monster recoiled. Unhindered even if it was injured, it lifted Iphra with it and squeezed. Sergeant Iphra Udrinnel’s vision went white with searing pain, then collapsed to black.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <p>“Look alive, squad! The L.T. will be here shortly.” </p>
                   <p>Markalane heard the baritone bark as she rounded the corner into the palace’s parade yard. She folded her hands behind her. Pausing, she took in the troopers before her. The dominus, her lord, had assigned her soldiers, the expendable kind, for the next stage of her assignment.</p> 
                   <p>She frowned.</p> 
                   <p>In the yard, tromlins formed two neat lines. Bloodseekers, theropadal bipeds, stood alongside quadrupedal ceratopsid hardshells. These dinosaur-like people formed the rank and file of the dominus’s Alien Cohort. A barrel-shaped figure in light military plate, the rank of sergeant marked on his gorget, paced before them. The sergeant’s head, pale-furred and ursine, looked too small in the armor.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Markalane recognized this gathol—Sergeant Narg. Underneath the armor, she knew, Narg’s body was massive, covered in the same pale fur and several stonelike plates. His people were among the few in the Cohort tough enough and willing to keep fractious tromlins in line.</p> 
                   <p>Turning to continue inspecting the squad, Narg spotted Markalane. He paused. Then, in the same sharp baritone, he said, “Officer on the field! Attention!”</p> 
                   <p>Every soldier snapped into a formal stance. Markalane strode around the squad in silence, glaring at each soldier in turn. None moved. None dared return her gaze.</p> 
                   <p>“We’ve been assigned a special mission,” she finally said. “We’re taking a mining team to a new system to recover a unique mineral. You are to keep order during this operation. Good Azlanti scouts died to make this mission possible, troopers. Honor them, me, and yourselves by performing your duties well. I expect no less.”</p> 
                   <p>“Yes, lieutenant!” replied every tromlin in unison.</p> 
                   <p>“Sergeant Narg.”</p> 
                   <p>“Aye, Lieutenant Markalane?”</p> 
                   <p>“The selected troopers must be ready to fly by oh seven hundred. Mining droids, security equipment, and remaining gear must be secured aboard the shuttle and ready for inspection then as well. That’s on you, this squad, and the other field sergeants. Got it?”</p> 
                   <p>“Understood, lieutenant.”</p> 
                   <p>“Good. Get it done.”</p>

                   <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/-R9reRmuHXw">Episode 02 | Merchant of Lies</a>: After dealing with an inn run amok, our scholars finally get a chance to rest and learn about the town, but their investigation is stymied by a massive commotion. A local merchant is selling marvelous gold and gem-encrusted wares at incredible prices. Too good to be true, or the deal of a lifetime?</p> 
                   <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/1rCm_Vt0PYM">Episode 03 | Season of Flame</a>: Dancing flames race through the tiny town of Zaltir, causing panic and chaos in their wake.

Two goatherders fight over a small patch of arable scrublands that their goats use to feed, but this "No Goat's Land" isn’t big enough for the both of them. Can our scholars and investigators broker a peace before the war spills over into the nearby town?</p>
                   <p> </p>
                   <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/dH0WkkusQrA">Episode 06 | Shadows and Song:</a> A master thief is on the loose in Zaltir, using powerful magic to steal from the unsuspecting people of the tiny desert town.

                   <h4>More About Our Geek Grind Story: </h4> 
                   <p>We operate Geek Grind Coffee from beautiful South Carolina and the mountains of Colombia. We ship from Chicago due to the central location. Our family has been growing and roasting coffee from the mountains of Colombia since the 1980s. We are an American family living between the two countries of the US and these coffee farms.</p> 
                   <p>A coffee family since the late 1970's, today we offer many exciting traditional roasts and flavored coffees available in whole bean and ground coffee at our company store <a href="http://www.geekgrindcoffee.com/" target="_blank">GeekGrindCoffee.com</a>—We have hundreds of <a href="https://geekgrindcoffee.com/pages/reviews" target="_blank">5-Star reviews</a>! This Kickstarter will allow us to expand our K-Cup offerings into many of the roasts and flavors that are currently so popular on our website but only available as whole bean or ground coffee. These are all the things we love brought together! Coffee, gaming, fantasy, science fiction and more! Geek Grind Coffee is the perfect blend of everything we love! </p> 
                   <p>We are utilizing our family's decades of passion, skill and expertise in the cultivation and roasting of mountain-grown Colombian coffee. Through Geek Grind Coffee, you have immediate access to our Colombian coffee farms and the unique quality that only direct-sourced coffee farming can bring to you. This may be the best coffee you have ever tasted and for a simple reason—we grow it and carefully manage every stage of the process in order to get to your cup.</p> 
                   <p>Thank you for your support!</p>

                   <h3>Avi Kool (They/Them)</h3> 
                   <p>When I was 5 or 6 years old, my Hebrew school teacher told me something I’ll never forget: “Jews question everything.” You can see this philosophy in the constant back-and-forth of Rabbinical literature throughout history, but even as a child, this stuck with me (perhaps to my teachers’ chagrin). In many ways, this drive to find the answers to hard questions has been a boon in my work as a TTRPG editor. </p> 
                   <p>I also owe more than I could ever say to my grandmother. She was forced to leave school at 14 when the Nazis seized control of the Netherlands, where she was born, and she went into hiding. She loves math and language, and I often wonder what she would have done with her life if she had been able to continue her education. In addition to being my personal hero and an all-around wonderful person, she’s an avid fan of games and sports. Her skill at games continues even at her ripe old age of 94: she solves 1000-piece puzzles by, and I quote, “remembering all the shapes” and routinely mops the floor with my mom and her friends at mahjong. She actually won’t play with the other residents at the retirement home because they don’t “take the game seriously enough.” I figure she’s earned the right to be a die-hard gamer at her age! </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Jacob W. Michaels (He/Him)</h3> 
                   <p>Shana tova, Paizo community. I’m Jacob W. Michaels, one of Paizo’s Jewish freelancers. I’ve contributed to a number of Pathfinder books in First and Second Edition, and recently had my first Pathfinder Society Scenario published (<em>2-19: Enter the Pallid Peak</em>). I’m excited to have my first contribution to a rulebook, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, out soon, plus the Kingmaker 2e conversion! This is the time of year, as we approach the High Holy Days, my thoughts turn to tikkun olam, the Jewish idea of repairing the world in part by doing good deeds. Then, on Yom Kippur, we look at what we’ve done wrong over the last year, and ask for forgiveness, not just from God, but from the people we’ve wronged. I think it’s funny that for many of us, our gaming experiences match these concepts. We like making heroes who set out to save the world (though, our adventurers probably kill a lot more monsters than we do in our real lives). We even may find ourselves atoning for our sins—literally in the case of champions or other divine servitors who’ve upset their deities and lost their powers. But of course, it’s so much easier in games, which is a shame. I imagine what this world could be like if we could all try to live up to our best characters’ ideals. Maybe we’re not killing a rampaging dragon, but even the littlest thing—let someone into traffic, pay for a stranger’s coffee—can make a difference. If we can start small, then we can work up to the massive things we still need to do to make the world a better place. Be safe and be good, friends.</p>

                   <h3>Hilary Moon Murphy (She/Her)</h3> 
                   <p>My name is Hilary Moon Murphy. When I was growing up, my family told me in no uncertain terms: "We are not Jews." This was in a family where the adults spoke Yiddish amongst themselves (but never to me) so I grew up understanding Yiddish as a second tongue. This was in a family where I was raised by a woman with numbers tattooed on her arm from a concentration camp. This was in a family where, one day, a family member started screaming when a Nazi character appeared on a TV show and didn't stop until almost ten minutes after the TV was turned off.</p> 
                   <p>I believe that my family cut me off from my Jewish heritage because they wanted me to be safe. They wanted to bury their memories of everything and everyone they had lost. This denial was so strong that I didn't start reclaiming my heritage until after I had children of my own. There were tears on my face the first time my kids and I lit a menorah. I felt like I was bridging generations, reaching out to all those my family lost and saying, "I remember you. I will not let you be forgotten."</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>David Schwartz (He/Him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hey! I'm David Schwartz, a long-time contributor to Paizo. In case the name didn't tip you off, I'm Jewish (among other things). Before I was asked to contribute to this blog, I had not really considered how my Jewishness influenced my approach to roleplaying games. After much thought, I realized that it can probably be summed up by my two favorite anecdotes from the Talmud:</p> 
                   <p>1) A non-Jew came before Shammai and said, "I will convert on the condition that you teach me the entire Torah while I am standing on one foot." Shammai pushed him away with the builder's cubit in his hand. The same gentile came before Hillel. He converted him, saying, "That which is hateful to you do not do to another; that is the entire Torah, the rest is commentary. Go study." (Shabbat 31a)</p> 
                   <p>2) The Mishnah states: If a fledgling bird is found within fifty cubits of a dovecote, it belongs to the owner of the dovecote. If it found outside the limit of fifty cubits, it belongs to the person who finds it. Rabbi Jeremiah asked: If one foot of the fledgling is within the limit of fifty cubits, and one foot is outside it, what is the law? It was for this question that Rabbi Jeremiah was thrown out of the house of study. (Bava Batra 23b)</p> 
                   <p>You can find me on social media as davidschwartznz on <a href="https://twitter.com/davidschwartznz" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidschwartznz" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>

                   <p>We're already processing the feedback you've sent us so far and are discussing the ways we might improve the evolutionist class. Also, if you missed our update elsewhere, please note that the evolutionist loses all EP at the end of combat!</p> 
                   <p>Thank you so much for your respectful and productive survey responses and forum conversations—these are invaluable sources of feedback, and we've been keeping a close eye on them. We’re especially interested in any thoughts you have about the complexity of the class.</p> 
                   <p>For those who have already participated in the playtest, we thank you, and to those who plan to still send us feedback: we eagerly await your thoughts!</p>

                   <p>There are no “common folk” here—only those who are willing to risk everything to defend the world against the endless hunger of the Abyss. Or... to win glory. To answer the call of forbidden knowledge. To rise above the fate prescribed to mortals.</p> 
                   <p>And you? What has brought you here? Are you ready to fight? Are you ready to lead? Are you ready to ascend? And if you're ready—which path will you choose?</p> 
                   <p>How will your power manifest? Will it breathe new life into the corrupted lands, or kill them off for good? Will you be a beacon of light in the darkness, or an island of chaos and madness?</p> 
                   <p>Who will follow you? Saints or sinners? Mortals or beings from other planes of existence?</p> 
                   <p>Who will you become for them? A commander? A prophet? A friend? Something more? Or will mortal pawns and their feelings no longer interest you at all?</p> 
                   <p>Only you can answer these questions. Only you can decide which path to take. The choice is yours, crusader.</p>

                    <p><em>From Tonya: I’ve spent just under 6 years shepherding Paizo’s Organized Play programs. With this handoff, I’m not out of the picture, but my role becomes more strategic and less tactical, as I instead focus on planning, integration with Paizo as a whole, and contributing to the bigger picture. Which means I won’t be as visible in day-to-day activities, as Alex steps into many of the travel and communication duties. This is bittersweet, as I relish the challenges of my new role but will miss the friends and experiences I had as both the OPC and the OPM. I’ve watched Alex grow into the role and am confident in his ability to deliver a quality program, alongside Linda and the developers. Please join me in congratulating Alex on his promotion! Huzzah!</em></p>

                   <p>Let’s start with the big news: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic"><em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em></a> is now sanctioned for Pathfinder Society! The character options are now available to all characters in the campaign as listed on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. For Starfinder Society, we’ve sanctioned <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029vf?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight"><em>Starfinder Adventure: Junker’s Delight</em></a> for both play and character options, and we’ve also gotten the options from the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk"><em>Devastation Ark</em> Adventure Path</a> out the door. Which means... we’re caught up on both programs! How about that?</p> 
                   <p>Of course, next month we have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xo?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em></a>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029v8?Starfinder-Tech-Revolution"><em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em></a>, not to mention a number of new adventures. So, we have much more on the way very soon! For now, enjoy our newest offerings!</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>At PaizoCon Online Europe, we awarded three new Campaign Service Coins. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new Campaign Coin holders:<br> <b>847</b> Tom Mannering<br> <b>848</b> Andrew Wilson<br> <b>849</b> Chris Manning</p> 
                   <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>This month is our final major convention of the year: Gen Con Online! The catalog is live and tickets are on sale for all our events now. We hope you’re looking forward to the premiere of our newest interactive specials, as well as the rest of our events at the best four days in gaming.</p> 
                   <p>Remember that you can always check out the list of upcoming events using the new <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Convention Calendar</a>!</p>

                    <p><b>Gaming Is for All</b></p> 
                    <p>Whether you are the GM or a player, participating in a tabletop roleplaying game includes a social contract: everyone has gathered together to have fun telling a story. For many, roleplaying is a way to escape the troubles of everyday life. Be mindful of everyone at the table and what they want out of the game, so that everyone can have fun. When a group gathers for the first time, they should talk about what they hope to experience at the table, as well as any topics they want to avoid. Everyone should understand that elements might come up that make some players feel uncomfortable or even unwelcome, and everyone should agree to respect those boundaries during play. That way, everyone can enjoy the game together. </p> 
                    <p>Pathfinder is a game for everyone, regardless of their age, gender, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other identities and life experiences. It is the responsibility of all of the players, not just the GM, to make sure the table is fun and welcoming to all.</p>

Several teachers will be described in a similar way in the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027nz"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #172: Secrets of the Temple-City</em></a>. But students and teachers aren’t the only important NPCs at a magic school. To help you further populate the Magaambya, here are three other figures commonly encountered on campus who didn’t make it into print due to space limitations.

                   <p style="font-size: 13px;">Lumusi Yao, by Vlada Hladkova</p> 
                   <p><b>Lumusi Yao (NG female human chef 5)</b>: Head of the campus cooks, Lumusi is in charge of serving the masses of hungry students and professors two meals a day. Lumusi stresses the importance of a healthy menu over unhealthier items—though there are few who’d complain about her goat pepper soup or spicy peanut curry. Lumusi also tries to keep the diversity of the campus in mind, ensuring that catfolk researchers can avoid onions and iruxi scholars get plenty of calcium. Despite her considerate demeanor, the chef is something of a recluse, and it's an event among students whenever someone spots her outside of the kitchens. Staff in the know whisper that Lumusi's skills came from constantly cooking to care for her dying husband in his final days.</p> 
                   <p><b>Thema (CG female elf gardener 6)</b>: An elf from a nearby Ekujae clan, Thema helps tend to the many trees, plants, and gardens on the Magaambya campus. While not the academy’s only gardener, she's the oldest and most experienced. Thema can be seen in the late evening and early morning, silently tending the grounds, leaving some to wonder if she ever rests or sleeps. She lets parts of the grounds remain wild, but keeps the rest scrupulously tended. To most students who casually interact with her, Thema is the picture of poise and grace—though this evaporates outside of a natural setting, as students have caught her wildly and elaborately cursing at sticky door-hinges or accidentally banging her shin on university furniture. </p> 
                   <p><b>Xhokan (LN male kobold inventory manager 9)</b>: The ever-smiling Xhokan runs the student supply store, affectionately referred to by Magaambya residents as “the Powderpile” for its large collection of alchemical and magical powders. A rust-colored kobold with flecks of bright orange on his scales, Xhokan is friendly but has a very wry sense of humor that leaves some people unsure of what he actually means or feels. Xhokan ensures that every student gets the supplies they need in order to complete their studies. Xhokan also ensures no one gets any of these provided magical supplies off the record—he has faced down the finest manipulators, beggars, and wheedlers the Magaambya has to offer without budging on this point. Some students gossip they've spotted the kobold doing inventory check after inventory check in the evening hours to ensure nothing has vanished from his stores.</p>

                   <p><b>Mark Seifter, Author of the Monster Parts System &amp; Battlezoo Ancestries: Dragons</b></p> 
                   <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here, talking to you today, not in my role at Paizo, but as the author of a brand new system for treasure you’ll find in the upcoming <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>, which you can get at <a href="http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com/" target="_blank">http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com/</a>. With monster part crafting, you can replace or enhance the default treasure distribution system for Pathfinder with an all-new take that allows you to upgrade your items with monster parts from the creatures you defeat so that they level up along with your character and gain new powers. </p> 
                   <p>Whether you want to use the new system exclusively, just a little, or somewhere in between, I built out three different variations so you can choose the one that’s right for your group—and I did all the math, so you don’t have to! I generated new tables that let the GM know how to hand out monster parts in a way that allows plenty of cool upgrades but is also fully balanced with Pathfinder under the normal rules. I also included sidebars if you want to combine the system with other variant rules that alter treasure, like relics and automatic bonus progression. For a sneak peek, check out this quick start guide for players, taken from the book itself:</p>

                   <p>As if that’s not cool enough, there are also a few neat rules options for characters who use monster parts to power their abilities, which you can use in your game whether or not you’re using the monster part system. The big ones are the monster mage archetype, which lets you learn and cast spells from defeated monsters, and the vestige hunter archetype, which enables you to take feats to gain special abilities used by the monsters you’ve defeated. The vestige hunter can incorporate the defeated monster’s vestige into their equipment or into their own body. For instance, if you took the feat to gain a breath weapon from a defeated monster, you could bathe in the dragon’s blood to gain a breath weapon or build a dragon head onto your shield so that it can unleash a breath weapon... and that’s not a random example! You can actually see the iconic monster mage in her blue robes and the iconic vestige hunter with his dragon head shield on the cover of <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3820ea7e-5d29-436b-8060-4b30f278a3e4/083121_Campfire-Square.jpg"><img width="350" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3820ea7e-5d29-436b-8060-4b30f278a3e4/083121_Campfire-Square.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Adventurers sitting with a dragon around a small campfire, working on their crafts"></a>

                   <h3>Play a Dragon, a Real Dragon!</h3> 
                   <p>I’m also writing <em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Dragons</em>, which will allow you to play dragons as PCs. I know allowing dragon PCs in the game sounds like it could be overpowered, but I’ve carefully balanced them with other options using archetypes to allow you to spend both class feats and ancestry feats to unlock additional draconic abilities. I’m so sure that the dragons won’t be disruptive that if that isn’t the case, you can contact me on my Arcane Mark Twitch channel or Discord, and we’ll figure out how to make it work. Players, you can tell your GMs that too if they’re uncertain! So come along with me on this journey as I pursue my passion project to bring the dragon ancestry to life and explore the myriad possibilities with 40 different dragon heritages based on the 39 true dragons of Pathfinder and one brand new dragon native to the Indigo Isles!</p>

                   <p><b>Patrick Renie, author of book #1, Search for the Missing Map (for levels 1-3)</b></p> 
                   <p>One of my favorite movies growing up was <em>Hook</em>, Steven Spielberg’s wonderful rendition of the story of Peter Pan. The movie seemed readymade for nostalgia tripping—nearly every millennial of a certain age can vividly recall the scene in which Peter must use his imagination to conjure the neon-colored “neverfood” at the Lost Boys’ banquet dinner. Rewatching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPCzjHPS--U" target="_blank">the scene</a>, I was pleased with how accurately I’d remembered the radioactive hues of the fantastical goop, which the boys raucously fling at one another in a food fight for the ages.</p> 
                   <p>The g’mayun, Jeffrey Anderson’s prize-winning entry to the 2020 RPG Superstar competition, evoked the same feelings of boisterous bonhomie and motley mayhem I experienced while watching <em>Hook</em> all those years ago. Like the Lost Boys, g’mayuns are merrymaking pirates of a benign yet bacchanalian bent, unwilling to “grow up” or submit to the rigid rules of other societies. The cultural legacy of g’mayuns—a history of demonic corruption and divine redemption—is both tragic and triumphant, similar to the bittersweet story of the grown-up Peter Pan. Yet, their parrot-like bodies, rainbow-hued irises, and carefree way of life are as delightful as Spielberg’s technicolor neverfood and the Lost Boys’ jubilation.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bafe2c2a-76da-490e-af2a-6ee451dfdcae/083121_02.Gmayun.png"><img width="300" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bafe2c2a-76da-490e-af2a-6ee451dfdcae/083121_02.Gmayun.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Gmayun, a humanoid, parot ,bird-folk with bright blue feathers.

                   <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                   <p>After developing the g’mayun for Roll For Combat’s <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>, I could hardly resist devising a Pathfinder campaign populated with these beautiful bird-folk. Brainstorming the series’ story and setting with Stephen, Linda, and Ron, I had as much fun as a kid at a food fight. The result, the Jewel of the Indigo Isles Adventure Path, is everything a Hook-loving mischief-maker could ask for: a thrilling journey of grand adventure, high-stakes challenges, and bountiful buried treasures. The characters start their adventure with a seemingly simple goal—find the missing fortune of the famous pirate Poppy von Barnacle—but they soon find themselves at the center of an epic swashbuckling tale spanning the tropical Indigo Isles. All the while, the party will meet countless monstrous foes and unusual friends, each drawn from the 100+ new monsters in the Battlezoo Bestiary, along with a horde of new creatures we’ve written specifically for this campaign.</p> 
                   <p>Jewel of the Indigo Isles is the kind of fun, colorful story that makes me feel like a kid again, and I can’t wait to share it with you. I hope you find this series as rejuvenating as I do and that, above all, it ignites your imagination.</p> 
                   <p><b>Ron Lundeen, author of book #2, Voyage to Runaway Reef (for levels 4-6)</b></p> 
                   <p>Greetings! I’m Ron Lundeen, and I have the pleasure of writing the second adventure in this campaign, “Voyage to Runaway Reef.” I love having an adventure that calls back to the classic stories of sailing through dangerous waters in search of a greater prize, like Homer’s Odyssey and the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor. I’m old enough to have run the D&amp;D adventure <em>M1: Into the Maelstrom</em>, which was, I later realized, mostly a fantasy reworking of the <em>Odyssey</em>. </p> 
                   <p>In these classic tales, the excitement is in the fanciful places the heroes visit, and “Voyage to Runaway Reef” is no different. The heroes visit Bluebell Island, which contains the town of Seaview and the lively orpoks, a new ancestry that I know people are going to love. The heroes must also visit other islands, including the ominous Moonshadow Island and, of course, Runaway Reef, populated by another new ancestry, the chochori. The adventure contains a lot of island-hopping fun, but I get to provide even more of it in the volume’s gazetteer showcasing the Indigo Isles.

                   <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer, author of book #3, Battle at Barnacle Bay (for levels 7-10)</b></p> 
                   <p>I’m excited to be working on the third volume of the Jewel of the Indigo Isles Adventure Path. Without getting into spoiler territory, I can say that this part will be full of cinematic adventure and opportunities for your motley band of characters to show off just how strong they’ve become. My experience as a GM and author up to this point has mostly been in the world of Golarion, so it’s fun to be part of building a setting from the ground up. In this new world of Alacar, all gods are part of a paradigm known as the Balance.</p> 
                   <p>Through the Balance, gods exist in groups, usually pairs, representing connected concepts such as Life and Death or Fire and Water. Though these gods of opposing forces may come into conflict, they must also ensure that their counterparts’ strength does not dwindle too much. Whenever a god dies, their partner in the Balance dies as well. Among mortals, the Balance is more than just a matter of discussion for theological scholars; the ideology also helps define how people interact with the divine. For just as the god of Water could not extinguish the god of Fire, so too do the followers of the god of Water know that nothing good can come of attempts to quench the god of Fire’s influence.</p>

                   <p>Finally, all of the adventure authors have the chance to create new monsters, lore, and player-facing rules. I could hardly pass up a chance to expand upon my favorite ancestry. As a part of my section, I'm making new leshy content, including the wildfire leshy, a new heritage in the Battlezoo Bestiary, along with a pack of leshy ancestry feats.</p>

                   <p>That’s an excerpt from the foreword Viola Davis wrote in the <em>NIOBE: She is Life</em> hardcover. This was just before Niobe and her entire world of ASUNDA was optioned by HBO a couple of years ago, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/03/asunda-drama-series-based-epic-fantasy-comics-hbo-sebastian-a-jones-1202581186/">where we are in development</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Now, after several graphic novels in Niobe’s world, we are launching her next comic series titled <em>NIOBE &amp; DURA: Wrath of the Ancient</em>, which I cowrote with Prentice Penny. I had the honor of working with Prentice at HBO. The comic drops August 28th on Kickstarter at 10 a.m., where you can also get the incredible <em>Pathfinder: Niobe</em> Pathfinder First Edition module, plus a model mini (by Mythic) and LARP swords (by Calimacil), and beautiful art by David Mack (Daredevil), Jae Lee (The Dark Tower), and Hyoung Taek Nam (The Last of Us). <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sebastianajones/niobe-and-dura-wrath-of-the-ancient-1?ref=7r1ufe&amp;token=a3066303">CLICK HERE</a> for the Kickstarter!</p>

                   <p><em>So how did we get here? </em></p> 
                   <p>Sometimes you have to paint your dreams into existence. I first fell in love with fantasy by painting little miniatures for my war games, back when they were made of lead, and I was 8 years old and still living in England. Shortly after, I fell in love with tabletop roleplaying and soon after LARP, much to the annoyance of my Mum, as I would constantly raid her wardrobe to hack up something to fashion some horrendous ranger attire or wizard rags… and they were raggedy. Since I was a kid, I was a gamer telling stories, but it wasn’t until I was in my mid thirties that they were voiced into something other than my weekly roleplaying sessions. With a couple of pals, I formed Stranger Comics.</p>

                   <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                   <p>The stories themselves are rooted in themes that reflect our own truths, and the lies we tell ourselves. Our struggles, our fears and hopes, our love… and second chances. The first tale, <em>THE UNTAMED</em>, is about a sinner who makes a deal with the devil to return from hell to avenge his family—seven days for seven souls. But even he can find redemption, and that’s when he meets Niobe. As for Niobe herself, she is always battling her own doubts about who she is, and who we want her to be—something we can all relate to. She is not only Half-Elven but also half-angel and half-demon to reflect the duality of spirit we all share and battle with.</p> 
                   <p>With several books in Niobe’s world of Asunda out, our new NIOBE &amp; DURA tale threads much of her story together, and it starts to reveal how the world was created by the great shaman DURA and her (now evil and undead brother) VASTAR, first child of the Devil. I couldn’t be more excited to share this with folks who love that stuff—worldbuilding—to you guys, the gaming community. Especially as the character class OMDAR/OMDURA in the Pathfinder module is literally derived from the character Dura, who trains Niobe for a period in her life. </p> 
                   <p>So, if you are into fantasy tales and games, which I can only guess you are if you’re reading this, I hope you get a chance to check out our campaign. There are opportunities to get the new stuff but also every other book in our world, plus the amazing module created in partnership with Paizo. </p> 
                   <p>Thanks and much love!<br> <b>Seb</b></p>

                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><em>A young Niobe is in the care of the great shaman Dura. They are fleeing the first undead, Vastar, Dura’s own brother returned from hell as the Devil’s horseman. He has just decimated the tribe that has raised Niobe, and now Dura must teach Niobe who she can be all the while knowing WHAT she could become if she falls into Vastar's hands. If Vastar can get to Niobe, Dura will have to make the ultimate choice. </em></p> 
                    <p><em>Niobe is half-human, half-elven and direct heir to the thrones of both realms who are at war. But Niobe is also half-angel and half-demon. For within her lies the spirit of the Goddess and the Devil, and both will move heaven and hell to make her their champion.</em></p>

                   <p>Well, one thing led to another, and we ended up making simple overlays for tables of up to seven players, plus the GM! We’ve bundled the overlays for four to seven players, a Game Master, some stats, and a space for the virtual tabletop together into free downloads for you. These are 1920 x 1080 PNG and PSD files with transparencies (i.e., blank holes) for the frames that go over the windows for the guests.

Following the competition’s extended hiatus, Paizo licensed the maker of the long-running Roll For Combat actual play podcast to run this hallowed contest. Now, after more than a year of developing, editing, illustrating, and designing, the 172-page book based on the winning entries is ready to be released along with two other companion volumes: <em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Dragons</em> by Mark Seifter and the <em>Jewel of the Indigo Isles Adventure Path</em> by myself, Ron Lundeen, and Linda Zayas-Palmer!</p> 
                   <p>Along with Roll For Combat’s showrunner Stephen Glicker and Paizo’s own design manager Mark Seifter, I had the great joy of working on this book to expand the contest’s winning entries into an awesome tome of monsters. You can read the full story of how Stephen resurrected the beloved RPG Superstar contest in the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary's</em> introduction, so I’ll spare you the details. Suffice it to say, a lot of love went into this grand effort, and we are all incredibly proud of the final result!</p> 
                   <p>Choosing a favorite monster from the many in this book would be like choosing my favorite horrifying child. From butcher booths (living, breathing, people-eating buildings) to g’mayuns (rainbow-eyed parrot-pirates), the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em> boasts enough potential baddies and buddies to populate multiple Pathfinder campaigns. Even with a hundred blog posts, I couldn’t do the magnificent monsters in this bestiary justice. They just have to be seen to be believed.</p> 
                   <p>Only one could reign supreme among the hundreds of monsters submitted to the RPG Superstar contest, however, and this year’s Grand Prize went to the shale spitter, a perhaps unassuming mountain-dwelling critter created by Brant Vallier. Brant’s entry even included a sketch of what he thought the shale spitter might look like—a sketch that I think it’s fair to say artist Sebastian Rodriguez turned up to 11.</p>

                   <p>We asked Brant to show us what the evolution of shale spitters might look like, and the resulting varieties of this versatile vermin left us astounded. The most impressive specimen is the shale behemoth, a crystal-covered horror of titanic proportions. (This one was so cool that it burst its way onto the book’s cover, as well!)</p>

                   <p>As if a boatload of new beasts weren’t enough for this epic volume, the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em> also features the brand-new <b>Monster Parts system</b>—a set of rules that Game Masters and players can use to transform loot from their slain foes into custom equipment and gear! Bundled with these new rules are two new archetypes (the vestige hunter and the monster mage), new character backgrounds, and new items, all perfect for those special slayers in your party.</p>

                   <p>All that to say, it wasn’t all that surprising when an unexpected knock at her door nearly sent her jumping out of her fur.</p> 
                   <p>“Uh… j-just a minute,” she called out, hurrying to tidy the books and papers in front of her. </p> 
                   <p>“I just came to deliver a message,” Esi shouted through the door. “Teacher Ot says he wants to see you.”</p> 
                   <p>Anchor Root’s heart raced. <em>Ba-bump. Ba-bump. Ba-bump.</em> “Did he say why?”</p> 
                   <p>“No. But he said that I should tell you that you’re not in trouble, you didn’t do anything wrong, you can take as long as you need, it isn’t an emergency, and he’s not mad at you.” </p> 
                   <p>Well. That only made it half as nerve-wracking at least.</p> 
                   <p>“Oh, there was one other thing. He said to bring an instrument.” </p>

                   </div> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Anchor Root found Takulu Ot in the courtyard, relaxing under one of the smaller trees. He sat with his eyes closed and held his mbira in his lap, lazily plucking out a scale on the metal tines. The soft, metallic strumming was a familiar sound to any student who knew the man. It was a somewhat popular instrument in Nantambu, but those from farther abroad usually found it odd. Something about the way certain notes wouldn’t play the way you expected, and would distract from the melody. </p> 
                   <p>Takulu hadn’t noticed Anchor Root yet, and she briefly considered turning around and returning to her room before he did. But that would only prolong her worry in the end. Better to simply get it over with. “Teacher Ot?” she called over instead. </p> 
                   <p>His hands paused as he looked up. “Ah, just the student I wanted to see,” he said with an easy smile. He seemed to smile more often than he made every other facial expression put together. “Did Esi deliver my message?” </p> 
                   <p>Anchor Root reached into her bag and withdrew an ivory flute. </p> 
                   <p>“Perfect! Now, I’m sure you’re wondering why I called you out here. You see, I feel I have been remiss in my approach to teaching certain elements of arcane spellcasting. I have a passion for mathematics, and I find them to be an excellent parallel to arcana. Each with a unique formula that can be broken down into its component parts, solved and calculated and—” Takulu glanced over just in time to see Anchor Root’s ears flatten, and cleared his throat. “Well, anyway, all of those things also apply to music, and Esi tells me that you are a talented musician. So why don’t we play together for a bit?”</p> 
                   <p>“What? Esi said that? About me?” Anchor Root asked in shock. “I mean no, I wouldn’t say that I’m talented or anything, Esi is the one who’s really talented, I just sort of play along from time to time but I’m really only just okay, or I guess ‘okay’ might be putting it too strongly, I guess I’m really just… sorry, I’m talking too much.” </p> 
                   <p>“You are not talking too much,” Takulu reassured her. “And ‘just sort of playing along’ is fine for now, as long as you don’t mind me talking while we play.” </p> 
                   <p>Anchor Root nodded and collapsed on the ground in a motion that some might charitably call sitting down. Takulu began plucking at his mbira again, and after listening for a moment to catch the melody, Anchor Root began to play along as well. As Takulu gradually increased the tempo, she sped up to match. As he slowly shifted the melody, she moved into a complementary harmony. </p> 
                   <p>“You know, many people find the mbira strange to listen to. They think the notes are too discordant, and they aren’t entirely wrong. It is an instrument that is not meant to be played alone. It is best with accompaniment,” he said.</p> 
                   <p>Anchor Root lowered her flute to respond, “But you play alone all the time.”</p> 
                   <p>Takulu looked over with that glint in his eye that he always got when he was nearing the heart of a lesson. “Do I? I don’t think I’ve ever heard an mbira played by itself. My grandfather built this mbira, so his hands are always next to mine when I hold it. My mother taught me how to play, so her song always harmonizes with mine. I don’t know much about bone keeping, but I imagine it must be similar. You are always carrying a little of history with you, in your music and your magic. When you stand on the shoulders of your ancestors, you can reach much greater heights than you do alone.” </p> 
                   <p>The young gnoll put down her flute to consider his words. “The thousands who have come before you,” she muttered.</p> 
                   <p>Takulu nodded. “With that said, why don’t we try that spell from class the other day? You got quite close the last time you tried, and I think you could do it with just a little more effort.” </p> 
                   <p>“Yes, Teacher Ot,” Anchor Root said. She didn’t mention that she had practiced the spell over a dozen times since she failed to conjure a simple illusion in front of her classmates. If she mentioned that, then her teacher would be expecting her to do it easily, and if she failed when he was expecting her to do it easily, that would be way worse than failing when he wasn’t expecting her to succeed at all, right? So without saying anything more, she reached out a hand and created a perfect illusory copy of her familiar. </p> 
                   <p>The illusory chicken moved around the courtyard, pecked the ground looking for bugs, and squawked intermittently. Takulu clapped softly and said, “Very well done. I couldn’t have made a more believable chicken. Pulling from your own experiences is an excellent way to reinforce your illusions, but you shouldn’t rely too heavily on them. So I wonder, could you try something bigger? Maybe something louder?”</p> 
                   <p>“Uh… I-I don’t know about that…”</p> 
                   <p>“Let’s at least give it a try. It’s okay if you don’t do it perfectly,” Takulu said. He stood, brushed the grass and dirt from his clothes, and began walking. “I’m going to go stand on the far side of the courtyard. Try and make something I can see from over there.”</p> 
                   <p>Right. Something big. What counted as big? Everything was big to an ant gnoll, but Teacher Ot was a tall man, she thought. A gorilla? A giraffe? A dog? An angry dog that barks whenever you walk past and it always catches you by surprise even though you walk that way every day and you’ve really thought about telling its owner that he should train his dog not to bark at strangers but he has a very angry dog and you have a chicken and—</p> 
                   <p>“Whenever you’re ready, Anchor Root,” Takulu shouted from the other side of the courtyard.</p> 
                   <p>In a moment of panic, she clutched one of the bones on her necklace and cast the spell. “Big and loud. Big and loud,” she whispered. She could barely hear her own voice over the sound of her heart pounding. In a swirl of light, a stomping, trumpeting, stampeding elephant appeared between the trees, charging toward Takulu. He smiled easily as it crashed through him and disappeared.</p> 
                   <p>“Yes! Excellent! You’ve got it!” Takulu cheered. He walked back over to the tree and knelt to pick up his instrument. “I knew that you had it in you. You sell yourself sh—you don’t give yourself enough credit, but you are an amazing talent. If you just keep up with your studies, I know that you’ll do amazing things. You might even get to teach your own students one of these day—</p> 
                   <p>“Anchor Root? Huh. How does she manage to run so fast?”</p>

                  <p>In the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands">Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</a>, the players take on the roles of students at the Magaambya, the oldest and most prestigious magic academy in the world, an ancient institution founded by the greatest wizard the world has ever known. This wizard vanished long ago, but his sinister enemies plot against his school and those who attend it. Over their long academic career, the heroes rise from humble students to become teachers, and they ultimately hold the fate of the Magaambya in their hands.

                   <p>We wanted to share the news a bit ahead of time so you can assemble your groups and plan some games. If you’re a member of our organized play community, you can earn credit for a Pathfinder Society character at the same time that you playtest one of the new classes, using the normal <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Playtest-Rules" target="_blank">Pathfinder Society rules for class playtests</a></p> 
                   <p>Are you interested in helping test and shape the newest Pathfinder classes, but you need help finding a group or game? The <a href="http://paizo.events">Paizo Events Discord server</a>, where our Gen Con Online events will be taking place, will have a channel for you to look for other gamers to playtest with. You can also check out warhorn.net or our VTT partners (Roll20, Fantasy Grounds, or Astral) for games. If you need a pre-made adventure, try playing a <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/society">Pathfinder Society scenario</a> or one or more <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/standalone/bounties">Pathfinder Bounties</a>!</p> 
                   <p>Tune in to our Gen Con 2021 streams for more information on the new classes (and the book they’ll be appearing in), and be the first to play them right after the convention! We hope to see you there!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Earlier this year, Digital Dragon Studios unveiled the official Pathfinder 2nd Edition Combat Tracker App for everyone to try, and we've had a great deal of fun listening to all the ways folks are using it! Thanks to your feedback, we’ve made quite a few alterations over the last few months, from two new systems to a variety of in-app improvements, and we’re excited to share them with you!</p> 
                   <p>While the Combat Tracker App is meant to be used by your whole party, with each person joining via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and thus always remaining on reset, many of our users also operate it solo. This means that some GMs are performing the time-consuming tasks of entering each party member in every battle. We’ve made some tweaks to make that just a bit easier by allowing the GM to save manually entered combatants from one round to the next. This means when you hit the reset button, only the non-saved characters are removed from combat, leaving the party together for the next encounter and eliminating the need to re-enter consistent characters. </p> 
                   <p>Other oft-requested features have been the bulk adding of combatants and the ability to delete a character during battle. We’re happy to report you can now add as many zombies as you like to any combat with just one entry, and it auto-populates each of their tabs! If you leave the dice setting on random, it even rolls different initiatives for them all. Just to make game life a teeny bit better, we also added a long press menu for each combatant on the combat screen. Pressing for a few seconds on a tab now brings up a menu allowing you to change an initiative, save newfound party members, and delete those lost in battle all in one place. </p> 
                   <p>Not enough? We also found time to adapt two other game systems, creating combat tracking apps for the many fans of Pathfinder 1st First Edition and the space-faring Starfinders! Whichever game you prefer, we hope you have fun with it, and we can’t wait to share our next updates with you. </p>

                   <h3>The Worldwound Opens!</h3> 
                   <p>At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, a massive rift in reality destroyed the nation of Sarkoris and left a permanent portal between Golarion and the Abyss. Known as the Worldwound, this extraplanar chasm left the world vulnerable to invasion by ravenous demonic hordes. An alliance of knights, barbarians, and other heroes stemmed the demon army and contained it within the Worldwound, and for the next century, crusade after crusade tried to defeat the demons only to fail time and time again. Their greatest success, the line of magical artifacts known as wardstones that stand sentinel along the Worldwound's border, barely manages to contain the demons. When one of the wardstones is sabotaged, the demons within surge out in a massive assault like none before. Even before the Fifth Crusade has begun, fiends have brought down a city and slayed some of the crusaders' greatest defenders and heroes. </p> 
                   <h3>Unleash the Wrath of the Righteous</h3> 
                   <p>In the <em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em> computer RPG, you take on the role of the Commander, who witnesses the tragic events that precipitate Golarion’s final stand against the invading demon armies. Over the course of the game, the Commander will assemble a band of loyal companions, from the redeemed succubus Arueshalae to the aasimar noble Daeran; marshal the armies of the crusade and command them in battle; and tap into mythic power to alter the very fabric of reality.</p> 
                   <h3>The Perfect Companions</h3> 
                   <p>Each companion offers a rich background and side plots to flesh out their history, relationship to the Commander, and role within the crusade. Companions both make up the adventuring party you’ll take through the game and serve as advisors, lieutenants in the ongoing war, and in some cases, even romantic partners. Your choices, alignment, and mythic path selection all impact the companions’ relationships with the Commander, ensuring that each playthrough offers a unique experience! Check out the shaman Camellia; the ranger Lann, one possible Commander; the Hellknight Regill; and Seelah, our own iconic paladin—just four of more than a dozen companions available to augment your game.</p>

                   <h3>Take Command</h3> 
                   <p>You’ll feel the scale of the conflict in Wrath of the Righteous with the Crusade system, a new strategic layer of gameplay built specifically for this adventure. At a certain point in the game, you will be granted command of the Fifth Crusade: a grand push against the demons. From that point on, you venture forth not only with your party but by recruiting troops and their leaders. Gradually, you will build up armies of thousands and march them across the Worldwound to seize back the territories and their treasures from the enemy.</p> 
                   <h3>With Mythic Power…</h3> 
                   <p>Further customizing the story to your choices, the mythic path you select grants your character a unique set of skills that push the limits of the Pathfinder RPG. It also presents a distinct narrative arc, ultimately leading to your mythic transformation into a being of unmatched power! As Commander, you can become a celestial angel, a raging demon, a powerful lich, a cunning trickster, an otherworldly aeon, a rebellious azata, a wise gold dragon, or an insatiable swarm-that-walks; you can even remain mortal and walk the arduous path toward becoming a living legend. With mythic transformations, you can increase the rank of your chosen path to earn new skills and abilities while also having a great impact on the world around you.</p>

                   <p>We have two new missions available for you starting this month. First, we’ll follow up our earlier trip into the Veskarium with an exclusive invitation to a cultural gala aboard a luxury concert ship. Society leadership is aware that some agents share our concerns about supporting the vesk imperialist agenda, and we hope to empower you to make your own choices regarding this matter in future dealings with the Veskarium—starting now. You won’t want to miss the stellar performance and political intrigue in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027tt?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-406-Combatants-Concerto-Prelude-to-Revolution"><em>Combatants’ Concerto: Prelude to Revolution</em></a>, written by Shay Snow. </p> 
                   <p>Our more seasoned agents are needed to scout a mysterious robotics facility in the Vast with suspected ties to the Data Scourge attacks. The First Seeker asks that you travel to the facility, infiltrate it, and discover whatever you can about the robotic attackers that marched on Absalom Station. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027tu?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-407-A-Haven-for-Scourged-Machines">A Haven for Scourged Machines</a> by Nicholas Wasko is another exciting installment in the Data Scourge metaplot. </p> 
                   <p>I’m counting on you, Starfinders. Be safe out there and watch each other’s backs. </p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Raia crouched behind a stack of crates, camouflage membrane turned to full power, focused on powering up the warehouse’s maintenance terminal. Once her enchantments opened up the interface, she plugged the jack into her custom wrist mount and said into her comm, “I’m in.” </p> 
                   <p>“You know,” answered Navasi. “I’ve never heard anyone say that on a job. Outside of an action holovid, anyway.”</p> 
                   <p>“Those soap writers wish they wrote plots as good as my life,” Raia answered. “About to go virtual. Stay put until you get my beacon. After I trip security, I’m going to need a fast exit.”</p> 
                   <p>“‘After’ you trip security?” said Navasi. “Don’t you mean ‘if’? Say you mean ‘if,’ Raia.”</p> 
                   <p>Raia laughed and said, “Going virtual.” </p> 
                   <p>The world around her vanished. Raia could still see, hear, and even feel and taste, but in this glowing, in-between world, meant to represent the digital flow of the local infosphere, sensation was different. Here, she was different. And much more powerful. </p> 
                   <p>Raia had been hired by a politician to expose a cult. She’d taken the job, not for money, but for a favor. Months ago, Starfinder Society probes had discovered yet another inhabited planet along the edges of Near Space, which ancient star charts named Sigerro. Preliminary scans indicated Sigerro’s inhabitants possessed a rich culture and advanced technology. Many interested parties hoped to be on the first diplomatic team sent to meet their people, but such assignments would be determined by the Directorate in accordance with Pact World protocol. </p> 
                   <p>Luckily, Elxur Droj, the verthani politician in charge of the Directorate’s diplomatic corp, was also a Seeker in his spare time—one of a group of infosphere conspiracists hoping to expose the wide-spread religion called the Disciples of Grace. Instead of helping the poor and sick, Seekers believed the Disciples were secretly corrupt slavers bent on taking over the Pact Worlds. Elxur not only believed this, he hoped to use their exposure to run for higher political office.</p> 
                   <p>After approaching Elxur through her usual aliases, Raia had managed to secure a deal. If she could procure evidence of corrupt Disciple activity, Elxur would approve her request to be part of the diplomatic team on Sigerro.</p> 
                   <p>The Disciples of Grace certainly weren’t spending all their credits on charity, no matter how well they laundered their donations. Raia had been able to locate a warehouse on Verces used by one of their shell companies for off-the-books shipments. If she could acquire shipping manifests, Elxur should grant her a place on the diplomatic mission.</p> 
                   <p>Now, Raia stood on a floating platform in seemingly endless digital chasm. Once she leapt, there was no turning back. Checking to make all her defenses and countermeasures were in place, she dove into digital void.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>It was like freefall, glorious freefall, except instead of wind, breezes of bytes and floods of information cascaded all around her.</p> 
                   <p>As long as Raia kept falling, standard security measures shouldn’t be able to track her presence, so fast was she moving from one node to the next. Yet this also made acquiring the right data hard.</p> 
                   <p>Everywhere she looked, she saw secure files as floating screens—and each image they depicted was disturbing. People being led away in chains. Priests changing form in private. These weren’t shipping manifests, but they might be better. Like a hungry child in an orchard, Raia plucked as many files as she could into her avatar for later study. She didn’t have much time before the system’s internal security caught on to her falling simulation and—</p> 
                   <p><em>VHHT VHHHT VHHHHHT</em></p> 
                   <p>Suddenly, instead of descending down an endless void, Raia was approaching hard ground fast. A digital wall of spiky security code had manifested—which could shatter Raia’s persona on impact. They’d detected her more quickly than anticipated. Upgraded security. Definitely more cutting edge than a charitable religion should have access to. </p> 
                   <p>Instead of smashing into the wall of code, Raia activated another program, buffering her processors through the node, her digital persona appearing to float gently to the ground. </p> 
                   <p>Where she was instantly surrounded by glowing-red virtual security countermeasures. Vicious, cutting-edge anti-hacker programs, which in the virtual resembled crimson piranhas coated in blood-red razor wire, swirling in on themselves. </p> 
                   <p>“Aren’t you just the cutest things,” she muttered. They rushed at her, but Raia had come ready for something like this.</p> 
                   <p>With the grace of an acrobat, she dodged their serrated tentacles—prodding counterhacks trying to penetrate her avatar and learn her identity. Just when it seemed the countermeasures might be too numerous to evade, Raia pulled her next trick. In a flash of green, two digital versions of Raia stood surrounded by the menacing security programs. Both fled in different directions. The security countermeasures, momentarily confused, split up to chase both.</p> 
                   <p>While her decoy fled, Raia dove behind a digital gleaming column and amped up her camouflage code, similar to the weave she’d been using in the real world. She blended completely into the digital wall around her. As the last security countermeasure flew past, Raia pounced, landing atop it, clawing both hands inside its glowing carapace.</p> 
                   <p>With the precision of a surgeon, she copied its access privileges and modified its instructions. Once finished, the drone glowed the same green as her persona’s glowing functions. It sped off to fight its former companions, while Raia used its security clearance to copy the shipping manifests she’d originally been hoping to “borrow.” </p> 
                   <p>A crackle and a beep indicated a message coming over her comm in the real world. “Raia? Things are getting pretty hot. Alarms everywhere and bots are summoning private security teams to your location.”</p> 
                   <p>Time to rabbit. Raia exited the hacking sequence, copied data securely stored in her rig. She turned on her beacon and sprinted toward the street, already spotting Navasi’s hovercar blasting around the corner. </p> 
                   <p>As she prepared to leap onto the vehicle, Raia wondered what she’d been able to acquire. She didn’t know exactly what was on those files, but it should be enough to get her on the diplomatic team. Either way, she’d make sure never to donate to Disciples of Grace in the future.</p>

                   <h3>Clark Valentine (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>I’ve been a part-time freelance designer and writer of tabletop RPGs for over 15 years, and I love fantasy adventure games like Pathfinder. I’m a big believer in setting design and worldbuilding through small details; what services people sell, what specialized gear a toolkit contains, and what capabilities people put into a magic item tells you a lot about how people live in the world. I’m really excited to be contributing to Pathfinder’s worldbuilding through this sort of design work. In addition to <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, you can also find my work in the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em> and <em>Bestiary 3</em> for Pathfinder Second Edition and in lots of games from numerous publishers across the tabletop RPG scene such as Fate Accelerated Edition, Tachyon Squadron, and Sentinel Comics RPG. Making games is a family activity for me; my wife and daughter are both award-winning RPG writers and editors. My son is an award-winning robot builder which, while not games, is pretty awesome. Our cats have not yet won any awards, to the whole family’s bewilderment. You can find me on Twitter under my name, <a href="https://twitter.com/clarkvalentine" target="_blank">@clarkvalentine</a>.</p>

                   <p>Hello, Paizo fans and supporters! I’m Sen H.H.S., a TTRPG freelance writer based on the other side of the Pacific, who often specializes in Chinese-inspired TTRPG content. You might have seen my work in Bestiary 3, as well as the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix’s second volume, “Ready? Fight!”. In addition to <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, you’ll find more of my work in upcoming publications such as <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>, and <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>. You can follow me on Twitter @SenHHS, where you’ll get the latest news on what I’m up do, be it projects for other systems or my self-publications. In addition, starting on the 28th of August, I’ll be joining a biweekly stream of a Fists of the Ruby Phoenix liveplay as a player. Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/TrailMixTales" target="_blank">@TrailMixTales</a> on Twitter to be notified when we’re on!</p>

                   <h3>Ron Lundeen (he/him) – Paizo Development Manager</h3> 
                   <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, development manager of Pathfinder here at Paizo. I wrote up several spells for this book, including a few involving gravity—for which I used quite a bit of "what do I like that my Starfinder characters can do that I want to do in Pathfinder?" thinking! You can check out my RPG advice, including an entire free Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure Path I wrote, on my blog at <a href="http://runamokgames.com/">RunAmokGames.com</a>. I’m available for freelance for any number of game systems at <a href="mailto:rules.lawyer.ron@gmail.com">rules.lawyer.ron@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Mari Tokuda (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Mari Tokuda is both a writer and a big, old nerd. You can find her work in the Dishonored and Dune RPGs alongside <em>Secrets of Magic</em>... with many more projects in the works! She has also written short fiction for the most recent version of the tabletop skirmish game Malifaux.</p> 
                   <p>She has a retired racing greyhound who is totally spoiled and totally deserves to be. She believes Seattle is the best city in the world, that the Civilization games are the best videogames ever, and that anthropomorphized food is super creepy.</p> 
                   <p>You can find her on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/maritokuda" target="_blank">@maritokuda</a> and on her website at <a href="https://www.maritokuda.com/" target="_blank">maritokuda.com</a>. You can also hear her chat about all things Asian American on her podcast, the Yellow Ranger Fanclub.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, she finds writing about herself in the third person really weird and uncomfortable.</p>

                   <h3>Logan Bonner (he/him) – Pathfinder Lead Designer</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, there! I'm Logan Bonner, the Pathfinder Lead Designer and also the design lead on <em>Secrets of Magic</em>. As you might guess from that, this book is a big one for me and a chance to show off the vision we have for how further rulebooks look now that the core tools for GMs and players are out there. The plan was to make a book that's fun to read—not just useful for its mechanics—that you'll want to have on your shelf for years and years. I put a lot of time into this book and worked with all these other amazing authors (it's a big author pool compared to most books!) to get their fun ideas in there. Thanks to all these cool people for their contributions! For my part, I wrote the magus, magical tattoos, and spellhearts, and created things to fill blanks during development. I've been at Paizo for 9 years, first arriving to edit on Ultimate Equipment, and have been in RPGs since 2006, working on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the Spectaculars superhero RPG, the Mistborn Adventure Game, Dragon Age, and lots more. I've kept myself busy during the pandemic with weekly RPG nights (including a long-running Star Trek Adventures game), an online comic book club with some friends, and way too much sitting around watching YouTube. I can be found on Twitter, where I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/loganbonner">@loganbonner</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Simone D. Sallé (she/they)</h3> 
                   <p><em>Secrets of Magic</em> might be my favorite author project to date! I'm so grateful for the opportunity to contribute to several sections that meant a lot to me. I'm always happiest in nature, so it was a joy to draw on that reverence for the primal treatise. And while space is always limited, I had a lot of background ideas that went into the witch's journey and I hope you enjoy the peek into her story!</p> 
                   <p>My writing has also appeared in <em>Bestiary 3</em> (arboreals and kokogiak), <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> (arctic biome), the upcoming <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> (REDACTED), and more, but you'll see my name with far more regularity (sometimes credited as Simone Dietzler) alongside Paizo's incredible crew of editors. When I'm not editing or writing, I'm—you guessed it—reading, gaming, or soaking up that primal magic on walks in the woods. You can find me on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wildwoodedits/">@wildwoodedits</a> and Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/virsamajor">@virsamajor</a>.</p>

                   <h3>David N. Ross (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>It was my pleasure to devise some new cantrips and other magic for <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, my twelfth contribution to Pathfinder Second Edition. I drew a fair bit of inspiration from superhero cartoons and games I loved when I was a little gay kid, which I hope will bring the same joy to players. When I'm not writing for Paizo, I'm a prolific freelance writer, designer, and developer of third-party products compatible with Pathfinder (first and second editions), Starfinder, and D&amp;D. My recent releases include the second volume of Fists of the Ruby Phoenix, a small part of the unapologetic original cyberpunk game <em>Hard Wired Island</em> from Weird Age Games, and <em>Legendary Sorcerers</em> from Legendary Games (compatible with Pathfinder First Edition). You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRossWorlds">@DavidRossWorlds</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Tonya Woldridge (she/her) – Paizo Organized Play Manager</h3> 
                   <p>While writing papers in college, I never envisioned earning author bylines for my words. While my focus at Paizo is more coordination than book creation, I’ve enjoyed the opportunities I’ve had to “cross over” and try something new. My biggest assignment so far was <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide</em></a>, which included the history of the Pathfinder Society, several lodges, a faction, and designing the lodge heraldry. For <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic"><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a>, my contribution included non-magical backgrounds. I’ve got no other upcoming projects releasing, as I’ve taken a hiatus from writing during the pandemic. But keep an eye out for me writing for future publications.</p> 
                   <p>In my off time, I like spending time in the kitchen, most often baking. I love reading cookbooks and have several shelves of a bookcase dedicated to volumes from medieval times to present. Right now, I’m enjoying making Korean cuisine for dinners and refining my cream clotting &amp; scone baking techniques so I can enjoy a proper English cream tea. You can find me on Facebook (PaizoOrgPlay), Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/PaizoOrgPlay">@PaizoOPM</a>) and Discord (TonyaOPM#6396). We’ve got PaizoCon Online Europe coming up this weekend – consider dropping by the <a href="http://paizo.events/">Paizo Events</a> server and say hi or join us for a game!</p>

                   <h3>Tan Shao Han (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>I'm an indie RPG designer and co-founder of the Curious Chimeras, an indie RPG design house in Singapore. I'm also part of #RPGSEA (<a href="https://across-rpgsea.com/">https://across-rpgsea.com</a>) a movement and allyship of RPG creators who feel and work with an affinity with diverse Southeast Asian RPG communities. My work for Paizo includes freelancing for several Pathfinder Second Edition projects; I enjoy designing spells, equipment, and otherworldly beings which can enrich players' experiences through hinting at the existence of larger, richer worlds behind the scenes. For example, I've had the opportunity to work on two different undead beings recently for Pathfinder: the new jiang-shi in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #167: Ready? Fight!</em>, and the abandoned zealot in Bestiary 3. These creatures are both supporting characters for players to interact with, as well as characters in their own right, with identities, desires, and anxieties rooted in their places in Golarion's milieu; I hope players and GMs will enjoy weaving these beings into their own campaigns and emergent stories.</p> 
                   <p>You can find my design work for the Curious Chimeras at <a href="https://curiouschimeras.itch.io/">https://curiouschimeras.itch.io</a>, and check us out at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/curiouschimeras/">https://www.instagram.com/curiouschimeras</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/curiouschimeras">https://twitter.com/curiouschimeras</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Vanessa Hoskins</h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I'm the author behind the Cathartic Magic and Thassilonian Rune Magic sections of the book, bringing you all the emotional powered goodness. As a long-time lover of all things Thassilonian, and someone who almost got herself a real Sihedron tattoo, I hope you get as much enjoyment playing those dedications as much as I had writing them. While you're contemplating your next emotionally fueled spellcaster, consider rolling one up for Abomination Vaults! I had the honor to write “Hands of the Devil,” book 2 of 3 in that Adventure path.

                   <h3>John Compton (he/him) – Paizo Senior Developer</h3> 
                   <p>I’m John Compton, Starfinder senior developer and longtime Pathfinder author. On my first day at Paizo, colleagues encouraged me to pick a custom avatar for use on our website, and thanks to the physical resemblance, Djavin Vhrest, Curator of Apocrypha at the Forae Logos library became my visual signature. Especially as I worked on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4d?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Concordance-of-Rivals"><em>Concordance of Rivals</em></a> I quickly connected with the character’s voice, mannerisms, and subtle barbs as we explored fictitious occultism. When the bard became the archetypical occult spellcaster in Pathfinder’s second edition, I found myself struggling to understand that new association forged between eclectic, storytelling musicians and the spooky, weird magic. Through the lens of Djavin Vhrest, I found an answer, and it’s my delight to have explored the nature of occult spellcasting in <em>Secrets of Magic</em>.</p> 
                   <p>If you’d like to hear more from me, I frequent Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/Archaeotagh">@archaeotagh</a>), as well as the Pathfinder RPG and Starfinder RPG servers on Discord. Definitely check out my more recent works like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029v8?Starfinder-Tech-Revolution"><em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em></a> (nanocyte, mechs, drones, demolitions, and more), <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024x2?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-Vast-Experiment-Falling-into-Deliverance"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #3-04: Falling Into Deliverance</em></a>, and recent fiction featuring the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shqu?Meet-the-Iconics-Veerkea">iconic nanocyte</a>. I love writing about our setting, its history, its cosmology, and its cultures, and it’s my pleasure to have contributed to those through works like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, as well as upcoming books like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021bz?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Lost Omens Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027u2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth"><em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em></a>!</p>

                   <p>Hello there! I’m Ruvaid, a Pakistani-American writer who’s been playing Pathfinder Second Edition since release. I’m super stoked to have been a part of this great book alongside so many amazing people. I wrote a bunch of magic items that made it into both the consumable and permanent item sections. I’m excited to see what you all think, and to see those items used in action. You can find more of my work for Paizo in Bestiary 3, as well as books 2 and 3 of the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path, and hopefully in more future books! If you’d like to try out any of the awesome new options from this book with me, I run a discord channel that hosts Pathfinder Society games every Saturday morning at 9am EST, and I would love to have you in it! You can also find me playing a Pathfinder Second Edition homebrew campaign, The Longstriders, on Wednesday nights at 9pm EST with a group of awesome people on Twitch at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/codygarettwells" target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/codygarettwells</a>. I’m also on Twitter @Darth_Ruvaider, where I talk about my work, Pathfinder as a whole, FFXIV, and whatever else comes to mind. I’m always looking for interesting projects or even just people to talk games with, so feel free to send me a message! I hope you all enjoy this book, and I will perhaps catch you on another blog some time again, someday – cheers!

                   <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a full-time freelance author. I’ve contributed to over thirty projects for Paizo since I started freelancing two years ago, including seven organized play scenarios, Pathfinder’s <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Bestiary 3</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, and <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, and Starfinder’s <em>Alien Archive 4</em>, <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, and <em>The Gilded Cage</em> (book 6 of the <em>Fly Free or Die</em> Adventure Path). Some of my upcoming releases include Guns &amp; Gears, Lost Omens Grand Bazaar, Tech Revolution, and <em>Galactic Magic</em>! For <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, I wrote Elementalism and a bunch of new spells. </p> 
                   <p><em>Secrets of Magic</em> is a really unique book, and I desperately look forward to cracking open a copy. I hope you enjoy <em>Secrets of Magic</em> as much as I do!

                   <h3>Andrew White (He/Him) – Paizo Front End Engineering Lead</h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I'm Andrew White, Paizo's front-end engineering lead and occasional contributor to various Pathfinder and Starfinder projects, including <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>, <em>Bestiary 3</em>, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, and a handful of super secret, as-yet unannounced things. <em>Secrets of Magic</em> was a blast to work on; I wrote a bunch of luck-focused and miscellaneous utility spells and a couple of rituals, and I am unreasonably happy that my weird spell that makes inanimate objects sentient without giving them the ability to move or communicate made it into the final product. Hope you have fun with it!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Minty Belmont of the Belmont System (She/her and Dae/Daem)</h3> 
                   <p>I’m Minty! I’m a plural polyamorous trans woman. You may know me from my work on a little series called “Hot or Not”, a series I run on @rpgegirl on twitter where we rate TTRPG monsters (and aliens) as to whether they are hot or not! We dive into the lore, the way monsters are built, and the general artwork for it! I’m also something of a Twitch streamer at <a href="http://twitch.tv/shineychariot" target="_blank">twitch.tv/shineychariot</a> on Monday–Thursday nights, and I do moderation work for Twitch streamers in my free time. I’ve been playing Tabletop RPGs for over half my life now. Currently, I’m just obsessed with the Paizo family of products, but previously I’ve played D&amp;D 3.5, a little bit of 4e, D20 modern, D&amp;D 5e, Numenera, Zombie Survivalist second edition, Interstitial, and a little bit of Pathfinder first edition. In the past I’ve made an entire TTRPG myself that’s on hiatus for development and have written a few homebrew classes for 5e and mini homebrew adventures for Pathfinder 2e! My favorite monster for Pathfinder Second Edition is the Cacodaemon, and for Starfinder it’s the Calecor and literally any undead creature. If you had a gun to my head asking what my favorite ice cream was, first I’d ask you to put the gun down and then tell you it’s birthday cake and you could have just asked. </p> 
                   <p>Lastly, if you have a group that wants to play Extinction Curse and you are missing one person, contact me.

                   <p>I'm Mark Seifter, Paizo's design manager and one of the four leads on the creation of Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> 
                   <p>In <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, I wrote a variety of different sections, including a few items and spells like <em>scorching ray</em> and the flexible preparation section of the Book of Unlimited Magic. But my favorite contribution was the treatise on magical essences. I’ve been excited to expand on the philosophical underpinnings of those essences with all of you for a while, and I hope you enjoy the treatise!</p> 
                   <p>I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/markseifter" target="_blank">@markseifter</a> on twitter.

                   <h3>Shay Snow (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, I’m Shay and I wrote the sympathetic rituals for <em>Secrets of Magic</em>! I’ve been freelance writing and editing for Paizo’s Pathfinder and Starfinder lines for over a year now, and they’ve definitely kept me busy with work. My next available piece of work is the Starfinder Society Scenario 4-06, which I wrote on my own and I’m both excited and nervous to have it out there for everyone! You can also keep an eye out for my contributions in the upcoming <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>! When I’m not writing at 5am (because I haven’t gone to bed yet) you can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/spellsinsugar" target="_blank">@spellsinsugar</a> on Twitter!</p>

                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Дорогие читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you might remember me from <em>Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, and <em>PFS #1-15: Blooming Catastrophe</em> and <em>PFS #2-08: A Frosty Mug</em>. Yes, I am the winter wolf hockey person!</p> 
                   <p>For <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, I did a passel of spells and rites, including our very own Elizabeth Báthory-themed immortality rite (bring a towel) and <em>mystic panoply</em>, for when your wizard simply must look <em>fabulous</em>. But I’m most proud of the Arcane Treatise. I’ve always wondered, what exactly does magic feel like, how do you actually learn it, how do all of these highly intelligent wizards understand their own spellcasting? Getting a chance to try and answer those questions was an absolute treat.</p> 
                   <p>But let’s talk about my other big project for a moment. <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> is an upcoming PF2 Campaign Setting, a swashbuckling city of intrigue and weirdness built atop the ruins of a very different world. How does magic work when compared to the grandeur of the Preboreal Age, or to the alien omnipotence of the Angels? You’ll need to wait for a bit to find out, but in the meantime you can check out our twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>, and keep an eye out for our second Kickstarter, coming soon (<em>Armaments of the Luminant Age</em>)!</p>

                   <h3>Michael Sayre (He/Him) – Paizo Designer</h3> 
                   <p>Yo! I'm Michael Sayre and I worked on the shadow magic section of Secrets of Magic. I've also worked on quite a few other products for Paizo, including acting as design lead for the upcoming <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> book, as well as working with a number of third-party publishers supporting Pathfinder first and second editions, D&amp;D 5E, and more. <em>Secrets of Magic</em> was an exciting book to work on as it represents the first book looking at new and interesting ways we can advance the game and introduce new options in innovative and unique formats. As the game continues to grow beyond the core foundation of the game represented by the CRB, APG, GMG, and Bestiaries, I'm really looking forward to more books like <em>Secrets of Magic</em> that can make both the world of Golarion and the rules of the game evolve in exciting ways! You can find some of my third-party work on DriveThruRPG at <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?author=Michael%20Sayre" target="_blank">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?author=Michael%20Sayre</a> and you can find me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelJSayre1">@MichaelJSayre1</a></p>

                   <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, all! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I've been freelancing for about five years, doing both Pathfinder and Starfinder. For Secrets of Magic, I did some spells, including the incarnate spells previewed in an earlier blog. Coming up with super-powerful entities you can summon—but only keep hold of briefly—was a lot of fun, and I look forward to seeing what new incarnate spells might pop up in the future!</p> 
                   <p>As for my most recent Paizo projects, I'm an author on the upcoming <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> and the recently released <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> for Starfinder. I've got some other cool things in the works, but nothing I can talk about yet! When I'm not freelancing game stuff, I can usually be found writing fiction, reading, playing various video games, or baking in my very tiny Boston kitchen. I've just started up an ongoing blog series on my website where I make a new, fully statted NPC every couple weeks, alternating between Pathfinder and Starfinder. If you're looking for some NPCs to pop into your games, you can check that out at <a href="https://klspeedling.com/" target="_blank">klspeedling.com</a>. You can also find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraLS">@KendraLS</a>, where I'm making a valiant attempt to be slightly more active. (Fun side note: this blog is scheduled to come out on my birthday!)</p>

                   <h3>Jason Tondro (he/him) – Paizo Developer</h3> 
                   <p>ason is a developer on the Starfinder RPG, where he helps to create Adventure Path volumes and stand-alone modules; when there’s three Jasons in the same Paizo meeting and it gets confusing, you can call him Jake. Jake was a college professor for many years, teaching writing, film, and world literature—especially from the medieval and Renaissance periods. He earned his PhD at the University of California Riverside—focusing on superhero stories across comics, film, and television—and that’s where he was given the nickname “Doctor Comics.” These days, however, he works with tabletop RPGs much more than with comics. Jake joined Paizo over three years ago as part of the editorial team, just as Pathfinder Second Edition was announced, and learned much from his colleagues over a year and a half. His first big project as a Starfinder developer was Fly Free or Die, a 6-volume adventure path about working class heroes trying to make ends meet in a cruel and greedy universe; the final volume to that AP came out in April, and while he assists Jason (see!) Keeley on Horizons of the Vast, he’s working on unannounced future projects. He lives in Seattle with Miss Tessmacher and Otis, his rescue dogs. He’s on social media—<a href="https://twitter.com/doctorcomics">@doctorcomics</a> (Twitter); Jason’s “Starfinder Developer Diary” videos walking through every aspect of AP development can be found on YouTube at the BAMF Podcast channel.</p>

                   <p><em>Legendary Monks II</em> is the latest volume in our series of class-focused player supplements! This volume is centered on the wise and capable masters of combat and mysticism, those paragons of insight known as monks. This new version of the base class introduced in the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</em> was designed to be an agile combatant specialized in unarmed fighting, honing their body into a force that could rival weapons and armor forged by the most capable of smiths. This book is intended to build upon that promise, as well as expand the class with flavorful and potent character-building options that fully explore the many paths to perfection. This legendary monk class is intended to allow the monk to further specialize their combat through several new and redesigned class features such as Path of Mastery, which provides a strong foundation for a monk's journey, whether based on strength, agility, or mysticism; Monk Arts, which grant them several means of using their new Qi resource; and Combo Strikes, which reward legendary monks for taking full advantage of their rapid-fire style of fighting. Furthermore, brand new archetypes provide further opportunities to construct unique characters, such as the black powder-fueled Combustion Knuckle and their special firearm-based combat, the gregarious Champion of the People who supports and inspires their comrades-in-arms, and the fierce Yaksha Disciple who channels the dread-inducing abilities of terrifying guardian spirits.

                   <p><em>Legendary Sorcerers</em> is the latest volume in our series of class-focused player supplements, this time focused on those spellcasters gifted with magical power beyond their own comprehension. These mystical savants are arcane spellcasters, but the form of their magic is altered by the origin of their power. The legendary sorcerer is a fully redesigned version of the core caster class, with a unique class feature that grants spellcasting flexibility, makes cantrips more useful, and expands bloodlines to allow customization of your inherent powers rather than fixed advancement. No matter the quest, the legendary sorcerer is ready for adventure, with 13 bloodlines including the Aberrant Sorcerer, who mutates with each spell cast; the Draconic Sorcerer, who can exhale spells; the Elemental Sorcerer, who combines physical strength with the summoning of energy; and the Undead Sorcerer, whose magic curses those they touch. You'll also find six spectacular archetypes like the arcane seeker, impulsive mage, and disciple of violence, alongside nearly two dozen sensational spells and feats perfect for unleashing your arcane power with fantastic flair.

Mystical gamblers and masters of chance, cartomancers use their cards as tools for weaving spells with decks that may focus on divination, illusion, and mental manipulation through occult magic; flora, fauna, and the elements with a primal deck; the raw power of life and death with a divine deck; or the diverse and balanced options of an arcane deck, along with over 50 class feats, from Combination Discard and Pass the Deal to Aces and Eights and Three Card Monte, plus a dozen more feats, traits, and backgrounds. You'll also find a complete system of Card Casting, with unique spells like arcane erosion, untouchable ward, gambler's guise, and bend nature for every card in a standard deck that you can heighten and empower by varying the number of cards you devote to their power from your mystic hand. You'll also get focus spells like cartomancy and dead man's hand and a bestiary with nearly a dozen specialized card constructs to unleash on your enemies.

                   <p><b>A note on Little Trouble in Big Absalom:</b> This adventure, despite taking 3-4 hours to run, currently awards credit as though it were about half that length. <b>This was an error on our part, and we apologize for it.</b> We can’t retroactively fix the XP now, because that would have cascading effects upon your characters, but we want you to know that we regret the error and our failure to fix it quickly, and that it’s not our intent going forward. If an adventure takes 4 hours to play, it will award credit as if it were a scenario.</p>

The sanctioning documents for Junker’s Delight follow our new format and model for rewards, so you shouldn’t have any issues applying credit to your characters. If you see any errors, do let us know so we can correct them and the template moving forward.</p> 
                   <p>We are working to update the sanctioning documents for all sanctioned adventures; we hoped to have them for this blog, but doing so turned into a larger series of tasks than we expected. We’re aiming to have them all updated in the next two weeks and will let you know with a comment on this blog once they are completed. You don’t need to wait for the updated documents to get the corrected rewards. We just want to make sure the information isn’t buried in a blog post, making it difficult to find easily. </p> 
                   <p>Going forward, our intention is that all sanctioned Adventures will award XP, Reputation and Downtime or Day Job rolls, as well as a level-appropriate amount of gold or credits. We’re updating our internal templates now to avoid variations in the future. If we missed an adventure that isn’t giving out rewards properly, please let us know!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“Oooh!” chirped Barsala, folding her goggles down over her eyes. She peered at the man’s leg, an image of the limb’s internal circuitry magnifying in her goggle’s lens. “The quality on your inner gyros is excellent. Liquid carbide receptors?”</p> 
                   <p>“Can I see?” asked Keskodai. With a soft clicking of his mandibles, he leaned over to get a closer look. “Chhk-chhk, look! See the pistons! Look at the little energy regulators, aren’t they pretty?”</p> 
                   <p>Raising one hand, Barsala waved at the shirren. “Kes, please hun, you’re in my light.”</p> 
                   <p>“But you can see the problem, right?” asked Amril. Twitching nervously, the young man drummed his fingers against the arm of the chair. “I mean, is it the regulators? I hope it’s not the regulators. They should still be under warranty. Do you think it’s the compression circuits?”</p> 
                   <p>“Calm down,” said Barsala. The words felt hollow in the face of her own burgeoning excitement. “It’ll be—”</p> 
                   <p>Abruptly, his leg kicked. Trembling abruptly, the servos within whirred energetically. “Look!” yelped Amril, the lashunta’s antenna shivering, “It’s doing it again!”</p> 
                   <p>“Fascinating... Kes, could you hand me the capacitor over there?”</p> 
                   <p>Inhaling, Amril turned his eyes toward the ceiling of Barsala’s laboratory. “I knew I shouldn’t have got it cut rate. Stupid counterfeit augments. The price was just too good. But then it started acting up. I checked the actual prosthetic parts. I mean, I had it checked—an engineer. One of the mechanics down at the junk races said its fine...”</p> 
                   <p>“They’re right,” commented Barsala, carefully separating two metal plates with two of her hands while magnifying her lenses with another. “In as far as the hardware is in working order. Whatever the problem is, it’s with the... Kes, please, you’re in my light again... it’s with the software.”</p> 
                   <p>Another juddering tremor flew through Amril’s leg. He leaned up in the chair, excitedly. “I knew it! I mean, I knew you’d be able to figure it out. The moment I saw your vids, I knew Dr. B was the right person for the job! What are you going to do?”</p> 
                   <p>“Did you hear that, Chhk-chhk? Our friend Barsala’s an expert.”</p> 
                   <p>“I am hardly an expert on <em>this</em> particular subject, Chhk-Chhk, but,” she slid a glove free from her lowleft hand, exposing the chrome fingers beneath, “I do have some personal experience with cybernetic prosthetics.” Flexing her fingers, she slid back a thumb-sized port on the back of her palm. “Rudimentary system scan,” she explained. “My prosthetic has a proprietary Helix Computing interface, I’ll log into your software, give it a quick scan, and check the integration files to your wetware.”</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Glancing up at Keskodai, Amril asked “What does that mean?”</p> 
                   <p>The shirren gave a soft shrug, his multifaceted insectile eyes seeming to widen in wonder.</p> 
                   <p>Carefully, Barsala unwound a small connector cable from one of her many pockets, sliding one end into the port on her hand. “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. I’ll go for a manual interface, so it’ll be more secure. Your internal firewall’s up to date?”</p> 
                   <p>“I... think so?” tried the lashunta, hesitantly, as the biohacker slid the cable into his leg’s interface port. “I had a new one installed last week, after the twitching started.”</p> 
                   <p>“Fascinating,” murmured the kasatha, drumming her fingers across a set of hard-light keys on her holographic display. “There’s some redundant files here. I can’t see any function for them. Do you have anything stored in them?”</p> 
                   <p>“Couple of vid shows.” replied Amril. “Don’t look in the download section, please. I might have downloaded them illegally.”</p> 
                   <p>With a few more taps from her three non-interfaced hands, Barsala announced, “Scanning now. Wait.” A sharp pause cut her voice silent. Then, glancing at the man’s cybernetic leg, she said “This is odd. The files are duplicating.” A second hard-light window appeared on the biohacker’s display—quickly joined by another. Then another.</p> 
                   <p>“Chhk-chhk wants to know if that’s bad.” enquired Keskodai. “It looks bad.”</p> 
                   <p>A series of digital windows blazed into life around Barsala, flaring like a cradle of stars. As they did, Amril’s leg shuddered violently, its pistons whirring at a fanatical speed, showering crackling sparks across the floor. “We’ve got exponential duplication!” yelled Barsala. “These aren’t redundant files—someone’s using them as a back door! Kes, quick—”</p> 
                   <p>Abruptly, Barsala’s hand twisted upward, violently pulling her trailing cable from Amril’s port. The biohacker gave a sharp yelp as her cybernetic fingers tensed into claws and turned toward her. Violently, her rogue hand lashed out, clawing and swiping at her face.</p> 
                   <p>“My! This is exciting!” chittered Keskodai. “I knew this would be a thrilling field trip. Do you need one of the inhibitors?” He asked nonchalantly, scanning a wide array which hung from the wall.</p> 
                   <p>“The blue one!” called Barsala, latching two free hands around her rebellious prosthetic. Her cybernetic hand continued to flail, lashing out with her fingertips. She staggered back, wrestling frantically with her hand.</p> 
                   <p>Quickly, Keskodai scooped up a sturdy metal cylinder marked with a blue label and hurled it over to the biohacker. Catching it deftly with her last free hand, Barsala wrestled her cybernetic hand down onto a cluttered workbench with the other two, scattering small vials and tubes. Holding her thrashing, violent hand down, she tugged open the interface port once again. “Okay,” she muttered, “that should override my biological systems long enough to isolate this thing...”</p> 
                   <p>“What is it?” cried Amril, eyes wide in shock.</p> 
                   <p>“Offensive countermeasure” replied Barsala. “Someone left a sentient computer virus in your prosthetic’s firmware.”</p> 
                   <p>Amril sat bolt upright, looking down at his leg in panic. “A virus?”</p> 
                   <p>Rolling up her sleeve, Barsala pushed the canister containing the inhibitor against her upper arm. It gave a soft hiss as the contents discharged, filling her bloodstream. “It was protecting a backdoor into your augment.” She explained, dropping the canister. Her arteries radiated a momentary glow. “Know anyone who’d want to hack your systems?” she asked.</p> 
                   <p>“Hacking?” spat Amril. “No! Definitely not! I don’t have any enemies!” he paused. “Actually, wait, maybe it might be...”</p> 
                   <p>With a series of thuds, Barsala’s augmented hand forced itself up from was held. Gritting her teeth in agitation, she grunted and grabbed a micro-welding torch. “Right!” she declared, crackling it to life. “Time for some surgical reprogramming!”</p> 
                   <p>As she began to rewire the hand’s circuitry in deft, sharp moves, Keskodai watched in fascination. “Hmm,” he pondered, tapping a thin claw-tip against his chin. “Chhk-chhk wants to know if you can simply eject the hardware.” he asked. “If it’s trying to kill you, that is. Perhaps we can take it off and put it in a box for now?”</p> 
                   <p>“Don’t need to” replied Barsala, her eyes focused intently on the work. A small shower of sparks flew from her hand. “I’ve confined the virus to a partition of the limb’s memory, which should let me get root access to... wait, Chhk-chhk wants to know?”</p> 
                   <p>“Ah, yes,” trilled the shirren cheerfully. “You see, at this stage in larval development, we’ve formed a telepathic bond that’s strong enough for in-depth conversation. In fact, I’d be quite happy to discuss—”</p> 
                   <p>“Maybe later.” she interrupted, dropping the torch onto the workbench, and opening another section of the limb. “I think... yes, let me just finish this scan... okay, system’s clear.”</p> 
                   <p>Amril rubbed his head, his antennas drooping. “Is that it?” he asked. “The virus is gone?”</p> 
                   <p>The biohacker slowly let go of her hand and bent each finger to test her control of her prosthetic, looking carefully for signs of any malicious intent. For a few moments she held her breath. Then, slowly, she gave a sigh of relief. “Scan’s clear,” she said. “Virus is gone. I’ve kept a log of if you want to watch it. In either case, your leg should be fine now.”</p> 
                   <p>Whirling around to face her, Amril rubbed his eyes. “That’s... that’s amazing.” he muttered. “Thank you. Thank you so much. It feels a lot better.”</p> 
                   <p>Flexing her fingers once more, Barsala reached into her pocket to recover her surgical glove. “We’ll still need to find out who hacked the limb.” She announced. “You’re quite sure you don’t have any enemies?”</p> 
                   <p>Clapping his hands together, Amril inhaled. “Well, maybe that wasn’t quite true. Y’see...”</p> 
                   <p>A heavy thud echoed through the laboratory. Somewhere in the distance, the ever-present hum of the power systems fell abruptly silent. The lab’s internal lights shuddered to darkness, replaced with the ghostly glow of emergency red illumination. “What?” snapped the biohacker.</p> 
                   <p>“Okay,” admitted Amril, “so, I didn’t want to mention it, but I’m part of a group of hackers...”</p> 
                   <p>Keskodai held up a hand. “Don’t want to interrupt” he said, “but I can sense six minds moving towards us. They seem... hostile. Friends of yours?”</p> 
                   <p>“No!” yelled Amril, glancing around the room. “Okay, look, so we were sniffing around some corporate files, and...”</p> 
                   <p>A heavy thud echoed from the other side of the laboratory’s door.</p> 
                   <p>Barsala sighed, shaking her head, and calmly started to load her needler pistol. “And this was meant to be my weekend off.”</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Lini held her palms out, and water encased the skeletons instantly. She winced from the effort of throwing the spell so fast. The casting’s sparkling light illuminated the skeletons’ silhouettes slowly wading through the wall of water she’d created. It wouldn’t hold for long, but it would buy them time.</p> 
                   <p>“Droo, let’s—” the words died on her lips.</p> 
                   <p>Droogami, Lini’s leopard companion, clutched another skeleton in his formidable jaws, slamming down it into the newly created mud. Bones crunched as Droo wrestled with their enemy. The skeleton must have been just inside Lini’s spell. She drew her sling, then loaded it and let fly in one easy motion. Bone dust plumed in the air as her missile hit the undead creature’s skull with a satisfying crack. With well-practiced movements, Droo and Lini spread out, flanking their enemy, forcing it to divide its attention between them. When its bones finally collapsed into a truly dead pile in the mud, Lini sighed in relief.</p> 
                   <p>A bony hand burst from the wall of water and clasped her throat. Lini desperately kicked up water and rocks as she fought to pry the clawed fingers from her neck. That’s what she got for letting her attention wander. She looked straight into the empty sockets of the undead monster choking her. The skeleton’s arm and head poked through the wall of water, and she saw more coming. The world wavered around the edges as she twisted as hard as she could. Droo took that opportunity to leap forward, breaking the monster’s hold. The leopard roared and crouched on his mud-caked haunches, ready to attack the rest.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>“No! Droo! Let’s go!” They couldn’t take this many on.</p> 
                   <p>Lini had known dangerous undead lurked throughout the Gravelands, but she hadn’t realized they were so many of them. Instead of attacking, Droogami leapt to her side, and she clambered onto the leopard’s spotted back. They took off down the ravine. Her watery spell wouldn’t last for much longer, and she meant to be as far away from here as possible.</p> 
                   <p>Mud and water flew as Droo sprinted down the path. Lini took a chance to look over her shoulder. They were gaining a little distance. Some of the skeletons were out of the water and shambling toward them, faster than Lini would have liked. More skeletons were still pulling themselves out of the wall.</p> 
                   <p>In front of them, another kind of wall, one made of rock and loose dirt loomed. It seemed steep but clambering up it looked to be their only way out. Lini lowered herself closer to Droo’s fur and peeked over his head as the ravine wall grew closer. Seconds later, Droo’s muscles rippled, and Lini steadied herself for the great cat’s leap. They had done this many times, and her stomach still dropped to the bottom of her feet every time. Droogami hit the ravine wall and dug his ragged claws into the dirt. They started to slide, and Droo’s muscles bulged with the effort of keeping them in place. Slowly, the leopard scrabbled up, and they ascended the ravine.</p> 
                   <p>Behind them, the spell creating the water reached the end of its duration, and the liquid wall collapsed, knocking most of the skeletons off their feet.</p> 
                   <p>Silence greeted the pair as they clambered onto the ledge. Lini dismounted Droogami and peered down into the ravine. They’d been crossing its bed when the skeletons had begun rising from the dirt. The corruption here was much worse than she previously believed. She could taste it on her tongue, feel it all the way from her head to her toes. Lini had a horrible feeling there were more undead out there, much worse than skeletons.</p> 
                   <p>Screams echoed around them and both Lini and Droogami crouched into ready positions. The cries had come from the other side of the ravine where smoke rose over a small holdfast on the horizon. Lini’s heart pounded. Many people had abandoned this land after the return of the Whispering Tyrant, but some still held on. They’d lived here for as long as they could remember; their ancestors knew this place as Lastwall. Lini and Droo had stayed with them to gather information before they crossed the ravine. The people had treated them fairly and shared what little they had. Lini remembered the hopeful face of the young girl who curled up next to Droo and fell asleep listening to tales of adventure.</p> 
                   <p>Lini scanned the whole area. There was no way they could make it around the ravine in time. She looked back down to the ravine floor. The skeletons had fully recovered now and were trudging toward them.</p> 
                   <p>“We have to go back, Droo,” Lini said.</p> 
                   <p>The leopard looked at her and gave a soft growl.</p> 
                   <p>“I know, but it’s the quickest way, and they need our help.” Lini looked into the leopard’s eyes, hoping her companion would feel what she felt.</p> 
                   <p>Droo chuffed softly after a moment and crouched down with a determined look.</p> 
                   <p>“I knew you’d understand, old friend,” Lini said.</p> 
                   <p>Lini climbed up onto her companion’s back once again. She sat straight and squeezed Droogami's ribs with her knees, tightly enough to keep her in place. She held her hands up to the sky and they started to glow. Lini took a deep breath and narrowed her eyes. She thought of the people to steel her nerves.</p> 
                   <p>“Let’s go.”</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">I’m excited to share that Paizo will once again be participating in the Mox Gauntlet charity game tournament, and it’s coming up this Sunday!</p> 
                   <p>The Gauntlet has become an annual tradition for us at Paizo, and we’ve been participating since our victory at the very first event. Every year the folks from <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&amp;eventID=500" target="_blank">Gamers Engaged</a>— the charitable giving arm of Card Kingdom, Inc.—put together a fantastic gaming tournament to raise funds for a local charity. This year, proceeds are going to <a href="https://youngwomenempowered.org/" target="_blank">Young Women Empowered</a>, an organization whose mission is to cultivate the power of diverse young women to be creative leaders and courageous changemakers. They offer various camps, workshops, partnerships, and public events to help these young women connect, learn, and grow. </p> 
                   <p>You can support us on our <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/team/paizo" target="_blank">team donation page</a> or by donating to the team members individually. Our roster has some familiar faces this year, as well as some newer folks. I’m thrilled to be captain of Team Paizo for the 3rd event in a row and participating in the Gauntlet for my fifth time. I’ve pledged to send out a punny space postcard as an optional incentive for $25 donations made direct to my <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=1048">donation page</a>. Aboard the Paizo rocket ship we’ve also got Organized Play Associate Alex Speidel, who promised a plethora of intriguing incentives on <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/participant/Alex-Speidel" target="_blank">his donation page</a>; Customer Service Representative Austin Phillips (<a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/participant/1050" target="_blank">donate here</a>); and our new VP of Sales and E-Commerce, Mike Webb (<a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/participant/Michael-Webb" target="_blank">donation link</a>). Starfinder Lead Designer Joe Pasini (<a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=1058" target="_blank">donate to Joe</a>) rounds things out as an alternate in case someone gets pushed out the airlock at the last minute. </p> 
                   <p>This year’s theme is Cosmos, so we’ll be taking on a slew of space-based challenges. Firstly, we’ll be split up into separate games of Space Park, then reunited as a team in the second round for cosmos-themed trivia. As usual, the organizers have kept the third-round finale a secret, so we’ll all be on the dark side of the moon until the big reveal on Sunday! </p> 
                   <p>The Gauntlet will be held virtually this year, and the entire thing will be streamed through the <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/" target="_blank">Gamers Engaged website</a>. Be sure to tune in to watch our progress and cheer us on! Donations are being accepted until the end of the event and not only do these funds go to a great cause, but our team can gain power-ups to use in the tournament based on how much we raise. You can help us launch our fundraising goals into orbit! We appreciate every single donation and share on social media—every bit helps. Thanks so much for being a part of our tremendously supportive gaming community. We’ll see you at noon Pacific Daylight Time on August 15th!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">The skittermander at the counter flexed his fingers and grinned. “What’ll it be, nufriend?”</p> 
                   <p>“Nufriend?” Tono smirked. “Every night I come here and order the same thing, and suddenly you ain’t know me, Henig?” </p> 
                   <p>Henig let out a deep chortle, as if it were emerging from his feet and rising out of his body. “No, no! It’s just that…” He leaned over the counter, inches from Tono’s face. “You know how the streets can be,” he whispered. “Funny business afoot, and all that. Don’t want anybody making off with your whereabouts, gree?”</p> 
                   <p>Tono gave a gentle nod, the neon of the night glancing off her chrome dermal plate. She had been working on this side of the surface for only eight months, and even she had made enough enemies to know better than for any of them to know where she slept. If just one of their associates ever knew she also was willing to drive this far into the city just for a bowl of noodles and a conversation in the middle of the night, she’d be face down in the alley beside the shop with a fist-sized gap in her belly. Tono winced at the thought—she hadn’t scrounged enough recent work to pay for another check-up, let alone replace a cybernetic augmentation.</p> 
                   <p>Strangely, her justification for habitually returning was twofold. For one thing, this part of the city was where all her informants were. For another, she grinned wide at the chef and said what she always said whenever he worried about her getting in trouble because of him. “You ain’t gotta worry ‘bout me, Hen… only nice people come by your shop.” </p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>“Is that right?” He chuckled again. “Then how come you’re here so often?” </p> 
                   <p>Tono nodded in amused agreement before ordering a large bowl of the house special. She tried not to bring her work—or her difficult demeanor—to Henig’s shop whenever she could avoid it, but she knew she wasn’t easy to deal with. He probably didn’t know what she did, but word got around quickly. Which is why she regretted having to ask her next question. “Have you seen Mirai about?” </p> 
                   <p>Henig raised an eyebrow. “Mirai? She in some kind o’ trouble?” </p> 
                   <p>The apertures in Tono’s eyes tensed. She noticed it right away. She always trusted that Henig was smarter than the goofy, kindhearted cook he presented as. “You know something.” </p> 
                   <p>Henig’s lower limbs continued pulling dough into thick noodles as he spoke. He glanced down pensively, and then toward the street, as if worried someone would find him. “Two folks in black came up the block asking for her, but I hadn’t actually seen her come out to the market in days. Made it sound like they’d been to her apartment… didn’t find nothing. If you’re asking for her…” He frowned. “Gotta think she’s on the run for some reason, gree?”</p> 
                   <p>“But why?” </p> 
                   <p>“You really askin’ me?” Henig shot her a wicked glare. “The same reasons you’d run. Is she in trouble?” </p> 
                   <p>“I don’t know. I asked her to check something for me. Just a chat with some folks at Fythe Dynamics for a client… a routine interview with Sepp Yolen. I thought it was nothing…”</p> 
                   <p>“Politely, I’ll ask.” Henig looked right at her. “Is it ever <em>nothing</em> with either of you?” </p> 
                   <p>Tono struggled for the next words and resigned herself to just a shake of the head. </p> 
                   <p>“Exactly.” He lit the stove behind him without looking. “I wish I had more to give you. Just… black suits, cold eyes, no manners. And one of ‘em, a lashunta woman, had a scar across the lip like so.” He made a diagonal downward motion across his own face, then shrugged. “Mean folks. Don’t want to see those two in a hurry again.”</p> 
                   <p>Tono tilted her head. “The suits… d’you figure they were top-notch?” </p> 
                   <p>“Maybe some of the most drift threads I’ve ever seen,” he said, finally casting an eye on the simmering stock pot behind him. “Probably thought I couldn’t tell the duds concealed armor. Figured they were well-paid hired hands of some sort.”</p> 
                   <p>“Any insignias on the clothes?”</p> 
                   <p>“No patches. Just a silver pin on the collar.” He wiped a large blue ceramic bowl and placed it in front of her. “Why?” </p> 
                   <p>Tono smirked. “No reason at all. I’ll be back in a bit. And my food better be waiting.” </p> 
                   <p>“Whatever you say, friend.”</p> 
                   <p>Tono got up and stretched before strolling back down the busy market street beside the shop. This part had to be done carefully, she thought. </p> 
                   <p>People tended to be very alert when they were tailing someone, after all. </p> 
                   <p>Tono was paranoid, to be sure, but the more precisely Henig described this lashunta woman, the more obvious her presence became, just a few dozen feet away, watching them talk the entire time. She may have followed Tono the whole way, in fact, or even watched her leave her apartment. Without making eye contact, Tono sized the woman up. Slim, tall, lithe—the kind she figured made her coin in close combat rather than a gunfight. Even more careful, then.</p> 
                   <p>Tono strolled toward where the agent stood—against the wall of a nearby bookstore—and squinted against the window. The lashunta didn’t flinch, but Tono knew better. Silence lingered in the air between them, mere inches apart. In that moment she knew they were both playing a calmness that would ready them for conflict at any moment. From that close, she could make out the vague imprint of a pair of blades under her jacket. She knew her appearance gave away her own game, as well: the quickdraw pocket in the right leg of her pants, wide enough for a sidearm, stored a static arc pistol specifically for moments like these. </p> 
                   <p>“See something you like?” the lashunta said casually. </p> 
                   <p>Tono didn’t even glance up at her. “So far, nothing seems especially interesting.” </p> 
                   <p>“Oh, yeah?” The lashunta’s voice rose—the telltale sign that Tono had the slightest upper hand. “Hoping to find something in particular?” </p> 
                   <p>“A challenge would be nice.” </p> 
                   <p>Before the agent could react, Tono reached for the agent’s arm and twisted it behind her back, pinning the lashunta against the wall. Tono drew her pistol and aimed it at the small of the agent’s back, right beneath where her trapped fingers curled into a fist. </p> 
                   <p>“What is wrong with y—”</p> 
                   <p>“A great deal, actually,” Tono said. “But at the moment, the fact that I’m being tailed has me particularly on edge.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re being silly, lady!” </p> 
                   <p>“Yeah?” Tono only needed to lift the agent’s arm for the tension and pain to increase. “Let’s check, then. Walk.” </p> 
                   <p>They slowly made their way back to Henig’s counter, their demeanors strangely calm for the circumstances. When Henig saw her again, his eyes widened. “Yeah…” he said meekly. “That’s one of ‘em.”</p> 
                   <p>“Was she nice to you?” </p> 
                   <p>It took him only beat to pick up on the game Tono was playing. “Not one bit,” he said.</p> 
                   <p>“See, my friend Henig here seems mild-mannered,” Tono said, nearly as low as a whisper. “But people tend to forget that he cuts his meat with the same sword that sears it, so I wouldn’t annoy him.” </p> 
                   <p>“And what happens if I annoy you?” the agent said with a smirk. </p> 
                   <p>“Scary part is, even I don’t know yet. Now talk.” </p> 
                   <p>“I got nothing to—” </p> 
                   <p>Henig slowly drew a skyfire sword from a drawer beneath the counter and brought it an inch from the lashunta’s face, just beneath the eyebrow. “Fine by us either way,” he said, igniting it just enough for a brief flicker of heat to grace her skin. “I hope you hate your face as much as we do…”</p> 
                   <p>“Wait.” Tono sensed the faintest shift in the agent’s mood from composure to fear and back, but Henig would never see it. </p> 
                   <p>“Fythe sent you?” </p> 
                   <p>The agent hesitated before nodding. “The girl. She asks too many questions. We just had to nab her, make her afraid, you know? But…” </p> 
                   <p>“You haven’t seen her either. So why are you following me?” </p> 
                   <p>“Because…” The agent sighed. “The chairman asks us to do his wetwork when he doesn’t want to think about something. When he wants it to disappear. But Mirai? He won’t stop asking about her. He wants a meeting now, to ask for a job.” </p> 
                   <p>It was Tono’s turn to be afraid. If Sepp Yolen wanted to meet, it could only mean trouble.</p> 
                   <p>“You have a cruiser?” Tono growled in the agent’s ear. </p> 
                   <p>The lashunta nodded. </p> 
                   <p>“Good. We’re gonna take a ride. But first…” Tono reached into the woman’s jacket pocket, pulled out a credstick, and tossed it on the counter. “You’re gonna pay for my dinner.”</p> 
                   <p>“That would be the nice thing to do, gree?” Henig said. “And only nice people come here.”</p>

The newest students at the venerable Magaambya academy of magic begin their academic careers with tests of skill and ingenuity.

                   <p>I did want to address a couple of points that we heard from the community in response to the announcement, which was a request for additional replay options as well as an update to the rewards given out by some of our sanctioned Adventures. To the replays, I know this has been a widely-requested option, and we’re working with tech on how we can best make the system work with the desire to replay adventures for credit. This will be a longer-term project, but we will keep you posted as we have news, it’s definitely something I want to see happen as much as the community. For the sanctioned content rewards, we’re finishing up an audit to update some of the rewards for older adventures and make sure everything is working the same going forward. Stay tuned for news on that front very soon!</p> 
                   <p>Finally, one thing that I don’t want to get lost: with the release of our newest Humble Bundle, featuring <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zkn?Starfinder-Pact-Worlds"><em>Starfinder Pact Worlds</em></a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder/beginnerbox"><em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em></a> at the physical tier, we’re excited to let you know that we’ve sanctioned the adventure in the Beginner Box, Steel Talon’s Lair! You can find the sanctioning on the product page; it awards one scenario’s worth of XP and credits, along with <b>double the Achievement Points</b>, to encourage you all to give the simplified rules of my favorite science-fantasy universe a shot. (OPM Note: The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026dl?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box"><em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em></a> also awards <b>double the Achievement Points</b>).</p>

                   <p>On Monday, the <a href="http://starfinderplaytest.com/">playtest for the new evolutionist class</a> began. This playtest is legal for games that take place during the playtest period, using the <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Playtest-Rules">rules in the Guide to Organized Play</a>. Play-by-post games may use these rules as long as the game begins prior to the conclusion of the playtest, though keep in mind that the playtest survey will close on September 24th. After the playtest concludes, evolutionist characters may not be played until the final publication of the class. We look forward to seeing the new agents in the field!</p>

                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>At PAX Online, we awarded a new Campaign Service Coin. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to <b>Betsy Nold</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID# <b>846</b>!</p> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, one GM earned their 5th Star for Pathfinder Society (first edition).</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Tommi Ketonen</p> 
                   <p>If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                   <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>Our remaining major conventions are <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-europe-2021"><b>PaizoCon Online Europe</b></a>, August 19-22, and <a href="https://www.gencon.com/online"><b>Gen Con Online</b></a>, September 16-19. PaizoCon Online Europe’s player signups are open now, and Gen Con Online registration will open August 15.</p> 
                   <p>Remember that you can always check out the list of upcoming events at the new <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Conventions calendar</a>!</p> 
                   <h2>Gen Con Online</h2> 
                   <p>The Gen Con Online catalog opens tomorrow for viewing and player registration begins at noon Eastern time on August 15. Paizo has over 450 events listed for Pathfinder Society (both first and second edition), Starfinder Society and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society.</p> 
                   <p>The Gen Con Online badge is free; session prices this year are as follows:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Two-hour Bounties and PACS sessions: $2</li> 
                    <li>Five-hour Scenarios: $4</li> 
                    <li>PACS Interactive Special: $6</li> 
                    <li>PFS2 and SFS Interactive Specials: $8</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Gen Con Online has a minimum price of $2 per event, regardless of length. We added a bit more to the longer/premium sessions. While online events do not have the same infrastructure costs as physical shows, there are still associated expenses we need to cover. Monies received from ticket sales at Gen Con help offset volunteer rewards, such as GM vouchers and book rewards, and pay for Discord boosts to ensure server stability during the event. We expect that when we return to Gen Con Indy, prices will be set similarly based on their pricing structure. </p> 
                   <p>We look forward to player signups; if you have questions about our events, please email genconleads@gmail.com. If you are interested in volunteering, visit the Organized Play Foundation <a href="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/popvo/" target="_blank">volunteer opportunities page</a> for more information. </p> 
                   <p>Until next time, Explore! Report! Cooperate! And get ready for the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“We can take it.”</p> 
                   <p>“But we don’t <em>have</em> to take it.”</p> 
                   <p>Coiling an arm around the vesk’s shoulder, Veerkea gently pulled her friend into a crouch behind the fallen tree they used for cover, directing the vesk to look at her lower eyes. “It’s not about ability, Obo. It’s about need. You,” she observed, tapping Obozaya’s armor, “are a mighty vesk warrior. But that over there is a living creature that’s done nothing to offend you.” All seven of Veerkea’s eyes shimmered with empathy as the 5-foot-tall land squid pleaded with her scaly companion. “Focus on the mission, Obo.”</p> 
                   <p>“I am! Look…” Obozaya stood up and glowered toward the clearing. “We came here looking for a crashed starship, right?” Veerkea extended her legs, raising her upper eyes high enough to peer over the fallen tree. The vesk gestured with her metallic staff as she kept talking, pointing out features. “How many rocks—big rocks—have you seen out here? Not many, right? But suddenly this clearing’s full of big slabs, and I’m figuring that’s no mistake.”</p> 
                   <p>Veerkea alternated between peeking over the massive trunk with her upper eyes and squatting to peer under it with her lowers before glancing to Obozaya with renewed respect. “Good eye! In fact, those might not be rocks at all, but metal plates. And that might mean we’re standing atop the starship and the power core we need.” Peering over the trunk again, she wondered, “But what might have drawn this creature here?”</p> 
                   <p>They both gazed at the beast perched atop the clearing’s highest point. Easily 12 feet long from snout to tail, the creature resembled a ponderous lizard with eight legs, a barrel-like body, a forest of spikes running along its back, and throat scales that occasionally glowed faintly as though the creature had swallowed a flashlight that was desperately signaling for help. Throughout the ijtikri and vesk’s hushed discussion, the beast had lazily watched them with a half-lidded eye, apparently unimpressed by its visitors and more interested in dozing in the errant sunbeam that peeked through the forest canopy here. As if to signal its nonchalant contentment, it issued a sloppy, snoring sigh and shuffled its body slightly to scratch an itch.</p> 
                   <p>With wide eyes and her voice hushed with uncertainty and awe, Veerkea asked, “Maybe we—"</p> 
                   <p>“—No.” The ijtikri flinched at Obozaya’s interjection. “No. You’re going to say ‘maybe we can talk to it,’ and no. It’s a glowy lizard. You got to sing happy songs with those peace-loving slugs earlier. But with big beasts, we do things my way!” Veerkea raised her arms to protest, but Obozaya waved her off. “No arguing with my scalesense, Vee. Let’s go!” Pushing off the ground with her feet and staff, Obozaya vaulted the fallen tree in a single bound.</p> 
                   <p>The flustered ijtikri called after her. “But I think that’s a plasmalisk, so we need to—”</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>“—Fight fire with fire, got it!” Obozaya barked confidently, as she landed in a controlled somersault. Knocking the butt of her staff against the ground as she rolled to her feet, she activated the weapon, causing a trio of plasma blades to flare to life and transform the shaft into an axe-like doshko. <em>That</em> got the lizard’s attention. Roaring with delight, Obozaya charged forward and drove the doshko’s energy blades deep into the surprised plasmalisk’s flank. The beast staggered under the impact, but it seemed unhurt. On the contrary, the creature’s flesh seemed to drink in the energy, simultaneously shorting out the doshko and causing its body to incandesce with power. The vesk barely voiced her shocked profanity before the beast moved with impossible speed that belied its bulk, twisting and slamming its tail into Obozaya’s chest and sending her flying back toward the fallen tree.</p> 
                   <p>Veerkea squeaked in alarm as the vesk hurled overhead. Acting fast, she whipped her main arms upward, awakening a multitude of symbiotic nanites that spilled from her body in a torrent. The living cloud wrapped around Obozaya, cushioning her impact as she collided with a nearby tree. Yet the plasmalisk had energy to spare. Before the vesk hit the ground, it spat a fist-sized fiery globule toward the intruders. Predicting the blast, Veerkea folded her body against the ground and propelled herself under the fallen tree, surfing atop the leaf litter to the other side before the projectile shattered against a low-hanging branch, enveloping the forest in flames. Even as fiery splinters rained around her, her nanites snagged the debris, rapidly breaking it down and using it to build more tiny machines to replace the ones she’d lost in the explosion. The flames had devastated the nanites around Obozaya, but their improvised shield was enough; though groaning in pain, her friend was clearly alive.</p> 
                   <p>The plasmalisk’s roar drowned out Obozaya’s groans as the beast trampled toward the ijtikri. Nanites whirled to life in a blinding fog, obscuring Veerkea’s form as the beast bit at her in vain. With each attack, the ijtikri sidestepped, her body partly discorporating into nanomachines with each defensive leap that carried her several body lengths out of harm’s way. As she reformed each time, she made a desperate attempt to defuse hostilities. “Excuse me! Please pardon my friend’s aggression, she—! Perhaps we could—oh no!” At last, the plasmalisk cornered her, cutting off her escape with its broad tail. But rather than bite her, it stared, its eyes glowing with radioactive intensity.</p> 
                   <p>Veerkea’s body exploded in pain as she began blazing with the same heat raging in those eyes, her very cells boiling from the gaze’s energy. As the plasmalisk watched the ijtikri hungrily, the nanite cloud stirred. Millions of the airborne machines seeped back into their host’s body, diagnosing the ijtikri’s distress and isolating the misbehaving tissues to limit their damage. Aided by her myriad medics, Veerkea averted her eyes and suppressed the inner flames before they consumed her. The plasmalisk seemed far less impressed. Seeing that its prey hadn’t succumbed to its gaze, it closed in to finish her off with fangs alone.</p> 
                   <p>A projectile slammed into the beast’s eye, deflecting its jaws as they narrowly missed the ijtikri. As Veerkea scrambled to safety, she nearly tripped over the deactivated plasma doshko that Obozaya had just thrown like a javelin. “Hey!” shouted the bristling vesk from atop one of the rocky outcroppings. “No plasma? No problem!” As if to punctuate her challenge, Obozaya splayed her claws threateningly and growled. Intrigued by this new prey, the beast obliged, hissing angrily as it lumbered toward and collided with the vesk. The two slashed and bit each other, but with twice the size and twice the claws, the plasmalisk quickly gained the advantage. </p> 
                   <p>“Something cold, please!” Veerkea called out to her nanites as she leapt atop another outcropping. She tossed a battery into the air as she pivoted toward the melee, and her myriad machines complied, neatly enveloping the battery and assembling themselves into an energy rifle that landed in her hands. “Nicely done, friends,” the ijtikri chimed as she felt the rifle chilling the air even before it had been fired. She trained it on the plasmalisk, which had pinned Obozaya’s head in place, forcing the vesk to stare into its burning eyes.</p> 
                   <p>Even as Obozaya roared in pain, Veerkea fired. Bolts of bright energy impacted the giant lizard’s haunches, instantaneously draining the target’s body heat and riming the targets with scale-shattering ice. A reflexive shiver forced the plasmalisk to drop Obozaya, and another two shots from Veerkea dimmed the glowing heat deep within the beast’s body. Panicked, the plasmalisk stumbled away, crashing through the foliage to escape the painful onslaught.</p> 
                   <p>But Obozaya’s wounded roar drowned out the beast’s. Veerkea rushed over the where her friend knelt on the ground, pink mist steaming from her body as Obozaya desperately tore off pieces of armor to escape the heat building internally. The ijtikri tackled the vesk, bracing her head and pinning her flailing claws against the moss while channeling nanites into Obozaya’s body to arrest the ionizing affliction. For agonizing moments, the vesk reflexively fought both the fires and the ijtikri, but gradually her thrashing slowed as her natural fortitude prevailed. Obozaya coughed smoke as she came to her senses, blinking in confusion at the ijtikri pinning her before shrugging and drinking a healing serum. “So, ah… did we win?”</p> 
                   <p>Flustered, Veerkea clambered off the vesk and searched the area. “We did, yes, we won. Ah…” As the adrenaline subsided, she began piecing together the puzzle. “The plasmalisk seemed to be basking, but it was clearly drinking in strong energy sources. If this the starship and power core we’re looking for, maybe the creature was drawing energy not from above, but from below?”</p> 
                   <p>“Like a heated rock?” Obozaya had regained her feet, picked up her dented doshko, and staggered over. </p> 
                   <p>“Exactly,” confirmed Veerkea as she continued her examination. “To a plasmalisk, this probably seemed like an oasis, perfect for warming up or… oh…” Confused by the ijtikri’s sudden silence, Obozaya came over to investigate. The beast hadn’t just been basking atop the buried starship’s hatch; it had been incubating. Several shells littered the concave hatch, atop which hissed a foot-long plasmalisk, puffing its body in a feeble threat display.</p> 
                   <p>Spreading her arms to loom over the infant, Obozaya silenced the creature through her presence alone. She grunted dismissively. “Runt of the litter, last to hatch. Well, hope its instincts are good. C’mon, run off to wherever your siblings scampered.” She nudged it with the butt of her doshko to clear the way to the hatch.</p> 
                   <p>Veerkea pulled the doshko to one side. “That’s not how this works, Obo,” she chided. “You picked this fight. Needlessly. If you’re so ready to take a life, you need to be ready to save a life.” The vesk let her head loll to one side in exasperation, like a toddler suffering a lecture. “And it’s not a runt. They were,” observed the ijtikri, pointing to the other shells.</p> 
                   <p>“Wait.” Obozaya’s attention had snapped back to the nest. "So the clutchmates hatch and fight, with the victor eating its siblings?"</p> 
                   <p>Veerkea bobbed sadly. "I know, nature can be cruel."</p> 
                   <p>But Obozaya shook her head with newfound respect. "No, I'm hearing that this is a born, blooded warrior.” She scooped up the eight-legged lizard that wriggled in protest. “My scalesense doesn’t lie. This is a survivor! A worthy companion! A—ow!" Instinctively wary of large predators and displeased with being handled, the baby plasmalisk latched onto Obozaya's finger with its needle-like teeth.</p> 
                   <p>"Hylax rejoices, Obo," laughed Veerkea as she helped disentangle the creature's teeth and eight legs. "You just made first contact."</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“Alright Tuku. Today you’re going to teach me about water spirits!” Ija turned toward her companion and gave a fierce grin.</p> 
                   <p>“Water <em>elementals</em>, you mean?” Tuku replied. The pink dragon’s wings fluttered as he glided from one tree limb perch to another. “I see the stretch of shore we’re looking for. It’s just ahead. When we pass the tree line, they’ll see us.”</p> 
                   <p>“Elementals, spirits; what’s the difference? They’re relatives of yours, right?” Ija asked. She knew they weren’t, but it was fun to tease Tuku a little.</p> 
                   <p>“They most certainly are not. I am a dragon!” he bristled slightly, though not truly annoyed.</p> 
                   <p>Ija’s eyes lit up. “I heard elementals can take any shape. They could be dogs, or bats, or <em>dragons</em>…” </p> 
                   <p>“So you <em>did</em> read the books from the Magaambya before we headed out here?” Tuku asked, surprised at her studiousness.</p> 
                   <p>“Well, I... definitely looked at the pictures,” she admitted, though, yes, she had read many of the words, too—eventually.</p> 
                   <p>“Water elementals are embodiments of the essence of matter, from the Plane of Water. They’re basically pure water. I am pure dragon.” Ija threw her eidolon a sidelong glance, and he sighed, repeating the fact she never let him forget: “Though, yes, without you to give me a body, I’m just formless mental essence from the Astral Plane. Thank you for giving me this <em>glorious manifestation</em>.”</p> 
                   <p>Ija snorted and rolled her eyes. “If they have no mind, does that mean we can outthink them? Like I always outthink <em>you</em>?” This was how they worked out their strategies, and ultimately how Tuku guided her to better use her power—teasing insults and playful banter.</p> 
                   <p>Tuku continued. “Oh, these aren’t just mindless puddles. These things are powerful in the water and they know it. They’ll try to drag us underwater.” He wasn’t kidding now, and Ija took the warning with the seriousness it deserved.</p> 
                   <p>“But they’re causing trouble for the fishers, so they’re coming out of the water for that,” Ija mused, “So let’s bait them into attacking us on land, too. I can’t swim after them if they retreat back to the water, but you can, and—I know! D’you want <em>gills</em>?” The eidolon matched her hopeful grin with as straight and nonplussed an expression as his draconic face could muster. “Don’t worry! If they catch you in a trap, I’ll call you back, or let the bond snap if I have to. But c’mon, let’s see how well you can breathe underwater!”</p> 
                   <p>Ija held the rune medallion she wore around her neck in one hand and held the other out in Tuku’s direction. The medallion, the matching rune on Ija’s headband, and the one emblazoned on her eidolon’s forehead all pulsed as their magical connection surged. Tuku felt an itch on both sides of his neck, just below his ears, and knew that he’d grown gills—at least temporarily. It wasn’t the plan he’d have suggested, but what was the harm?</p> 
                   <p>“Is that it? Gills? Anything else we should be prepared for, or am I just going to <em>swim</em> the water to death?”</p> 
                   <p>“Oh, I’m not done yet!” Ija’s excitement was palpable. She often had trouble focusing, but when she found something that captured her attention, her enthusiasm was contagious. “So! Water conducts electricity, right? I mean, yeah, it’s not actually the <em>water</em>, but the salts and stuff <em>in</em> the water. So as long as these aren’t made of pure water and are made of <em>ocean</em> water, then I should have just the thing.”</p> 
                   <p>Before Tuku could respond, Ija dashed toward the edge of the trees, leaving her dragon companion nodding approvingly to himself.</p> 
                   <p>“Hold on, short-stuff! Not so eager, or you might tip them off that something’s happening. Let’s either sneak up, or if we’re going to use your plan and bait them out, then pretend you don’t know they’re there,” Tuku suggested.</p> 
                   <p>“So... I’m not sure we can convince them we’re just normal fishers they can terrorize. Do you think they’re going to be, I don’t know, <em>put off</em> by the whole you-being-a-dragon thing?”</p> 
                   <p>“I’ll have you know that dragons are excellent at fishing. But you do have a point. Call me to your side when the time comes?” Tuku wondered aloud.</p> 
                   <p>“Too slow. You sneak, I bait,” Ija decided, “There’s not a lot of cover, so try to use the seaweed. And your new gills!”</p> 
                   <p>Tuku nodded his assent and disappeared into the water, though Ija knew exactly where he had gone. She wandered along the shore toward a rocky outcropping where the fishers had reported the most recent elemental attacks, seemingly lost in thought. It wasn’t hard to appear distracted, after all, because she <em>did</em> have an awful lot of things on her mind right then, but mostly she was thinking about shocking some water elementals. </p> 
                   <p>She avoided glancing toward the water so as not to give herself away, but instead connected her senses to Tuku’s, so every so often she could peer through his eyes. That’s how she noticed the elementals slowly rising from the water to ambush her. Five huge, indistinct humanoid forms, almost the same color as the water itself. Two coming in close, one circling around, and another backing them up. The last one lurked in the distance to her left.</p> 
                   <p>She turned her body away from them to further the deception, all the while glaring at them from Tuku’s position nearly completely submerged among the thick kelp nearby. </p> 
                   <p>She waited... waited... That one on the left was still too far. Waiting... OK—now! </p> 
                   <p>Ija’s senses rushed back into her own body, and she spun on her heel, already starting to cast her spell. Only from this perspective could she see that she’d misjudged their distance from Tuku’s vantage point; she had let them get too close! Ija might have fooled them, but it the nearest elemental was still close enough to slam its watery fist in her direction as she dropped her guard. Her concentration faltered—</p> 
                   <p>“Look out!” While she’d been focusing on her own part in the ambush, Tuku was singularly occupied with keeping her safe. Realizing the threat, the dragon rose from the water and bolted toward her. Arriving just in time, Tuku spread his wings to shield his summoner, taking the brunt of the force as the warm, brackish water of the elemental’s slam fell clear of Ija.</p> 
                   <p>Grinning mischievously and winking at her protector, Ija spread her hands, and unleashed a chain of lightning toward her attackers. Forks of electricity arced from figure to figure, jolting the elementals and causing their forms to lose cohesion. Wherever the lightning touched, water leaked from their bodies like the contents of a bucket seeping from uncaulked seams. Either the water <em>had</em> picked up sediments, or everything she and Tuku had been thinking had been wrong; maybe both. It didn’t matter either way.</p>

                   <p>One of the elementals created a vortex of water just onto the shore. The moving eddy surged forward and back like a rushing tide, threatening to batter Ija and Tuku onto the rocks and deliver them into the depths. Ija tried to dodge, but her foot slipped on the wet sand. The incoming vortex was unavoidable.</p> 
                   <p>But again, Tuku was vigilant; the dragon eidolon had been in a perfect position to notice and dodge the vortex. This time it was he who called upon their protective bond, swooping in to grab Ija, fluttering slightly off the ground for an instant, and setting her back down when the danger had passed.</p> 
                   <p>This unlikely maneuver gave Ija room to dodge more oncoming blows from the nearest elementals. She backed up to a safer distance as Tuku went into a draconic frenzy, tearing apart the elemental that took the brunt of her lightning spell. The elementals responded in kind, surrounding the dragon and pummeling him with waves. Due to their bond, Ija felt every impact like a hit to her own body, but she knew they could last a little while longer. </p> 
                   <p>“Ija, again!” Tuku shouted over the sound of crashing waves.</p> 
                   <p>Ija called the lightning once more, and the sharp scent of ozone manifested as the magic sprang from her hands and arced into the elementals’ bodies. One of the remaining elementals was slain outright, or perhaps banished back to the Plane of Water—she honestly wasn’t sure what happened to these things when you destroyed them. Tuku noticed another that was leaking its essence from several places, and he used his jaws and claws to tear the holes wider, ripping the towering figure apart until it too collapsed into a splash of mundane water. Ija didn’t see any shining or shimmering like when a summoning spell ended; probably dead then. </p>
                   <p>The remaining two elementals began to flee in terror, finally realizing how dangerous Ija and Tuku were as a team. The dragon snapped at the nearest of them and looked back toward Ija, awaiting her approval. She quickly raised one eyebrow, as if to say, “go on,” and as quickly as that, Tuku was off beneath the waves. </p> 
                   <p>A few minutes later, the dragon emerged from the water with a wide, goofy smile filling his toothy muzzle. “I told you dragons were good fishers,” Tuku said. Ija squeezed her hair to rid it of at least some of the water that now weighed heavily on her head. Her eyes widened, expectantly. </p> 
                   <p>“And yeah,” Tuku continued begrudgingly, “I guess the gills didn’t hurt.”</p>

                   <p>This playtest is your chance to get a look at an early version of this new class and have a hand in its development before it hits shelves in an upcoming book!</p> 
                   <h3>Playtesting the Evolutionist</h3> 
                   <p>The evolutionist playtest launches today, <b>August 2</b>, and runs through <b>September 24</b>. So how can you help playtest this new class? First, you’ll want to download the free PDF of the playtest from <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">starfinderplaytest.com</a>. Then you can create a brand new evolutionist of any level using the new rules. We're most interested in feedback from actual play, so it's best if you can get some friends together and play a few sessions using your new character. If possible, make up characters at different levels to get a sense of how they work at different points in their career. </p> 
                   <p>There's no accompanying playtest adventure—you can use the new class in existing adventures like Starfinder Society scenarios or Starfinder Adventure Paths, or even in mock combats that you create yourself using the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>’s encounter-creation rules. It might be helpful to take some notes during play, so you can remember your thoughts on the experience after the game session. To gather the most useful data for this playtest, we ask that you avoid using house rules and play these characters using only published rules from the Starfinder RPG.</p> 
                   <h3>Playtesting in the Starfinder Society</h3> 
                   <p>Players participating in <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety">Starfinder Society Organized Play</a> can also join in the worldwide playtest to test the evolutionist class. From today until the playtest's completion, players can create custom evolutionist characters of levels 1, 4 and 8. For more information, click <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Playtest-Rules">here</a>.</p> 
                   <h3>Survey</h3> 
                   <p>Our primary means of collecting feedback for the playtest is through a survey that we would like everyone participating in the playtest to complete. A link to the survey is available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">playtest page</a>. Please make sure you've filled out your survey by <b>September 24, 2021</b>.</p> 
                   <p>In addition to responding via the official survey, you can engage with other players and designers on the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/playtest/evolutionistClass">playtest forum</a> to discuss the evolutionist and possibilities for the future. While we want to focus on actual-play feedback, we're interested in hearing all your ideas about the class.</p> 
                   <p>What are your thoughts about the playtest? Are you excited? Do you have any questions about the playtest process? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

                  <div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;">
                   <a href="/image/content/Blog/073021_MECHCOMBATPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/073021_MECHCOMBATPreview_500.jpeg"></a>
                  </div> 
                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description"><em>“Give it your allsix. Give it your allsix.</em>” The chipper voice sang out in the spacious green and yellow interior cockpit of the Veskarium Vanquisher mech. The sound of responding digital displays and humming power fields harmonized with the cheerful voice.</p> 
                   <p><em>“Time to face the morning and make some nufriends!</em>” A second, equally energetic voice joined in to complete the ditty and punctuated the song’s end with a series of additional digital keystrokes on floating vidscreens.</p> 
                   <p>Sarotska watched with interest as the data appeared in front of her. The holographic light shined off her bright red scales, giving her a momentary violet complexion as she took in the display. Swiping the holographic data away with her claw, the vesk commander of the mech briefly closed her eyes.</p> 
                   <p>“Quiet on deck. Bunkle, ready the plasma rifles. Jiji, I want to make sure the weapons core is ready to swap our output over at a moment’s notice.” Sarotska spoke the commands as her eyes re-opened and fixed on the alien landscape now visible through the small view slit that was only accessible from her position in the mech’s chest cavity cockpit.</p> 
                   <p>The stone forests of Elytrio’s southern hemisphere were some of the most unnerving terrains that Sarotska had seen in her long time with Obsidian Spiders mercenary company. She’d battled the Azlanti Star Empire, the Swarm, and at least a half-dozen different types of outsiders who’d breached the Material Plane for one reason or another. She’d taken part in the second Scoured Stars invasion and inserted onto jungles where colossi walked like modern gods. Still, Elytrio had a feel completely unlike that of any world she’d walked on. It was a planet that appeared dead, yet wasn’t entirely done with the world of the living.</p> 
                   <p>“Sorry about the singing, boss. It’s just, this place doesn’t seem right, ‘gree?” The statement and question came from Bunkle, one of two other operators onboard the mech with Sarotska. The electric blue skittermander turned around and looked up to Sarotska’s elevated position in the cockpit, his six arms continuing to manipulate controls around him as he scrunched his face.</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah boss. I thought this place was supposed to be an irradiated wasteland, but there’s no sign of radiation. It’s just a bunch of weird, petrified trees.” The follow-up came from the other skittermander crewmember, the cherry-red Jiji, who kept her eyes forward, looking out from sensors and moving the mech’s twin plasma rifles at the smallest disturbance in the terrain.</p> 
                   <p>Sarotska waved a dismissive claw while peering out the viewscreen. “Look. We’re here to find some missing Starfinders. Or, at the very least, their bodies. The Society paid for us because their team that went missing was pretty capable and it’s likely whatever took them down ambushed them in this area. So yes, I think something isn’t right here, but I think the only way we’re going to figure it out is if you keep you eyes on your screens, Bunkle.”</p> 
                   <p>The blue skittermander crunched his face in a sour expression and stuck out his tongue before swiveling around to stare back at the mountain of data feeds that accumulated in front of him. Jiji chuckled from her position, though her wide eyes never left the constant flow of data.</p> 
                   <p>“Got something, boss! Looks like a signal up ahead behind those rocks.” Jiji chirped from her station. The data quickly moved up to Sarotska’s station with a visual swish as it loaded onto her console.</p> 
                   <p>“Hmmm...” Sarotska mused as she took in the data. “It looks like a blip of radiation from behind the rocks. Could be some leftover irradiated debris. Probably something the Starfinders would have investigated on their mission here.</p> 
                   <p>“Bunkle, I’m going to move us closer. Keep the plasma rifles ready, just in case.” The commands emerged from Sarotska’s mouth, but she’d already put the mech in motion. One plodding step after another, the Vanquisher continued moving on its path. The roughly humanoid bulk of it crushed the cracked gray terrain around it, as the bulky chassis of the Vanquisher navigated through trees and debris.</p>
                   <p> </p>
                   <p>The Vanquisher mech was something of an oddity of Veskarium-crafted mechs. It lacked the armor upgrades common on mechs like the Ripclaw or Warmander, and instead had been designed by Veskarium engineers for maximum destructive ranged combat. A Vanquisher boasted a pair of heavy plasma rifles, capable of devastating the land around it for a hundred feet. To mount such brazen weapons on its hull, the Vanquisher not only sacrificed heavy Veskarium armor, but it also lacked any sort of dedicated melee weapon beyond its ponderous legs.</p> 
                   <p>“I’m getting something, boss... more radiation. It looks like... OH NO!” Jiji updated just in time for the crew to spot two things in their sensor displays.</p> 
                   <p>The first was a gruesome cluster of bodies. Six skeletal figures, each with radically different equipment, were scattered at the base of the rock. The emblem of the Starfinder Society caught in a slight updraft off the tattered backpack of one of the unfortunate souls, letting the crew of the Vanquisher know that they’d found their targets.</p> 
                   <p>The second sight was a sudden movement in the rocks. In an instant, the top rock seemed to ripple in the breeze, and then a moment later, it spouted thousands of cracks. As the crew tried to comprehend what they were seeing, the cracked rock burst into thousands of tiny forms that formed a swarming cloud.</p> 
                   <p>“Jiji! What are we looking at here?” Sarotska demanded as she backed the Vanquisher off from the agitated lifeforms.</p> 
                   <p>“High radiation, boss. Looks like it’s a colony of insects that fed off the radiation. Their wings are some kind of shielding material, so that’s why we couldn’t scan them earlier.” Jiji blathered as she scanned streams of incoming data and manipulated the information with her arms, sending necessary data to both Sarotska and Bunkle.</p> 
                   <p>Outside the Vanquisher, the swarm continued to grow as more of the nearby “rocks” sluffed away to unleash droning insects that joined their kin in a growing ball. Instinctively reacting to the mounting threat, Sarotska moved the Vanquisher back several paces, with each step causing the swarm to reflexively discorporate or extend in random directions. Then, an instant after the mech came to a plodding stop, the swarm engulfed the mech and alert sirens blared.</p> 
                   <p>“Radiation increasing! The outer shields have burst. The outer hull is melting!” Jiji continued to deliver verbal updates, despite the information displays Sarotska had in front of her to confirm the damage.</p> 
                   <p>“Bunkle, I think it’s time that we give our new <em>friends</em> a show of force.” Sarotska put distinct emphasis on the word “friends,” employing the tonal meanings of the Vesk language to let her crewmember know that these insects were to be immediately recognized as hostiles and targeted immediately.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>A moment later, two beams of bright white and blue plasma streamed out from the twin rifles mounted on the Vanquisher’s upper limbs. The swarm danced around the beams, and while some of the insects fell into electrified husks, others in the swarm seemed to bloat and expand off some of the energy weapons fire that poured into them.</p> 
                   <p>“Looks like they’re eating most of the plasma, boss. It’s just like how they eat radiation here.” Jiji reported as the cockpit shook with another violent impact from the swarm. “Outer hull integrity is down fifty percent. Ammo reserve number one is jammed!”</p> 
                   <p>Sarotska took a moment. She closed her eyes again, and breathed as time slowed around her. She assimilated the verbal updates from Jiji, the scores of tactical data that flooded her vision, and then saw the swarm through the viewport in her station. </p> 
                   <p>With a flash of white teeth, Sarotska opened her eyes and she fell back into the moment.</p> 
                   <p>“Jiji, shift the weapons core energy to siphon high-frequencies into the rifles. Override the fire mixture since they’re feeding on that. Bunkle, get ready to make the next two shots count.” As the commands issued from her, Sarotska took control of the Vanquisher’s movement systems and siphoned from the power core to initiate a stomping trample maneuver—the only reliable melee option available to the mech. The stomping behemoth moved through the swarm, which parted at its sudden burst of speed.</p> 
                   <p>Shifting on its ponderous legs, the Vanquisher made a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn as Sarotska steadied the moving mech with manual controls from her station. Jiji continued adjusting screens as she desperately sent energy streaming from the rear-mounted weapon core into the twin plasma rifles. Finally, Bunkle rested his upper arms behind his head, while his remaining two sets of arms both went to work lining up shots through the Vanquisher’s autotargeting system.</p> 
                   <p>“Guess today’s not the day for nufriends, ‘gree?”</p> 
                   <p>A stream of electrified air blasted out from the rifle arms, momentarily deafening the cockpit’s occupants. Instead of the fiery plasma that previously emerged, waves of sonic resonance accented by arcs of lighting flew out in a straight line toward the swarm of insects. The twin lines pulverized the swarm together, where arcs of electricity shot between the insects, baking their bodies to dust in an instant.</p> 
                   <p>“We did it!” Jiji shouted, leaping atop her piloting chair.</p> 
                   <p>“Was there ever a doubt?” Bunkle followed-up, cracking the fingers of his lower arms while his upper arms continued to support the back of his head.</p> 
                   <p>Sarotska’s smile vanished as stillness overcame the former battlefield. Nothing remained of the targets.</p> 
                   <p>“Bunkle.” the vesk pilot began, her tone immediately conveying a mounting sense of anger and worry.</p> 
                   <p>“You didn’t hit those Starfinders’ remains, did you?”</p>

                   <h3>Spidery Friends</h3> 
                   <p>Ever since the anadi shyly tiptoed their way into Pathfinder near the end of First Edition, our fans have been split between those who love anadis and arachnophobes (sorry about that). An anadi named Renali showed up in the first book of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path, and she could even accompany the heroes of that adventure as they fought off a group of hostile invaders in the town of Breachill and beyond. With the release of <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em>, anadis are now a playable ancestry—GMs can take cues from these rules to give Renali new abilities to help the PCs overcome their challenges, or even allow a player to use Renali as a PC!</p> 
                   <h3>Slithering Spoilers Ahead!</h3> 
                   <p>If you're still waiting to experience the events of <em>The Slithering</em> unspoiled, then shoo! Get out of here! But if you're a GM seeking to build on the framework the adventure provides you, consider checking out <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em> as you begin your preparations. Not only does the book contain more information on Kibwe, where the events of <em>The Slithering</em> take place, it also provides information on the surrounding area, the people who live in the city, and recent events that the locals might still be talking about—aside from the terrible ooze curse, of course! Would the sudden influx of charau-ka refugees from Usaro cause your PCs to raise an eyebrow? Could a visiting Alijae elf from the White City of Nagisa have some helpful information to offer? Has a relative or friend had a narrow escape from someone looking to cash in on the rumored Aspis bounties for kobolds?</p> 
                   <p><em>The Slithering</em> sees PCs venture into the city of Holy Xatramba to face down a group of demonic cultists. But <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em> unveils another resident of that city—the green dragon Olohimba, who considers the ruins her domain. Though thoroughly evil and happy to dine on any intruders to her realm, she considers herself an orthodox follower of Pharasma (and since she isn't a cleric, Pharasma's ban on neutral evil clerics and champions can't convince her otherwise!) Olohimba considers it her duty to the Lady of Graves to cleanse Holy Xatramba of demons, and she could be swayed to help the PCs in their predicament. Is negotiating with a dangerous and powerful draconic patron worth the risks? Or would the PCs prefer to take their chances with the demons?</p>

                   <h3>College Prep</h3> 
                   <p>If you and your group are planning to play in the upcoming Strength of Thousands adventure path, be sure to pack <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em> in with your textbooks! Beyond offering a basic history of Old-Mage Jatembe, his Ten Magic Warriors, and the founding of the Magaambya, the book also takes a close look at the city of Nantambu, where the Adventure Path is set. The book outlines all the hottest spots for students looking to spend their free time, from the Black Crowned Crane restaurant to the best shops serving alcoholic “Jatembe Juice.” Unless, of course, you'd rather spend your nights in your dorm room all alone. Even the antisocial can find useful material, however: the ancestry rules for some of the Mwangi Expanse's shiest people, from the secretive shisks to the paranoid golomas. Whether you're a party animal or a studious scholar, <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em> is the book for you!</p>

                  </div> 
                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Marcus was miserable.</p> 
                   <p><em>Sign up for border forces</em>, his father said. <em>See the world. Lend your strength and inner fire to Cheliax. Your brother and sisters could use a role model. Your mother could use any surplus income.</em></p> 
                   <p>Clearly dad had never served.</p> 
                   <p>The journey past the Menador Mountains was challenging; Marcus had never left the Chelaxian border before, and the transition the landscape made as they neared the Uskwood was unsettling. The sun seemed to shine brighter back home; the colors were brilliant, the daylight sparkled, and even the nighttime was made merrier by the vivid oranges and reds of torchlight and campfire.</p> 
                   <p>Everything here was muted. Smothered. Silent. As though even the crickets were afraid to call, the birds too cautious to sing. The trees here were different, too; gnarled, angular things whose branches inexplicably still bore fresh leaves. He’d never seen new foliage look so drab, like it was painful to even grow.</p> 
                   <p>This entire place was shadow and silence; even the campfire they’d made struggled against the oncoming darkness, and the crackle of burning wood shouted their presence. Marcus huddled closer and gave his companion a long-suffering look over the flames. </p> 
                   <p>If Calerio was bothered by the strange solitude of Nidal’s environs, he didn’t show it. The man’s face was calm, his hand steady as it stoked the fire to further life. He took another look around the small campsite, his dark eyes studying every nearby tree and bush before settling again on his companion. Only then did the man’s eyes soften a little, and the wisp of a smile tug at his mouth.</p> 
                   <p>“We won’t be here long,” Calerio reassured him. In the silence, even his soft baritone seemed to boom.</p> 
                   <p>“Good,” Marcus grumbled. “I’d much prefer mountain-diving to this.” </p> 
                   <p>His companion chuckled, and all too soon, the uncomfortable silence pressed in. It needed to be chased off; grasping for a topic, Marcus asked, “So, uh, you been here before?”</p> 
                   <p>Calerio chuckled softly. “A long time ago. Years. And never this close to the Uskwood. Even back in my old caravan days, we never went through the Uskwood. The locals don’t like to be disturbed.”</p> 
                   <p>“Yet here we are,” Marcus sighed.</p> 
                   <p>“Here we are,” Calerio agreed. “But these are the orders.”</p> 
                   <p>The younger of the two sighed and returned his eyes to the fire. Behind him, the sun’s last rays finally sank below the horizon line, and night settled in, as though it always belonged there. Nighttime should not feel so heavy, and yet it threatened to smother the Chelish soldier. Marcus’s hand kept close to his scimitar, his stomach tightening in anticipation. By now, the small campfire bellowed in the deadened silence, angry and intrusive. </p> 
                   <p>“Won’t be long now,” breathed Calerio.</p> 
                   <p>And it wasn’t.</p> 
                   <p>“<b>Blasphemers!</b>” The voice boomed, setting both men instantly to their feet. “You shall pay the price for your intrusion!”</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/dbf30c4c-3473-4465-bdde-200178941d66/072721_Uskwood.jpg"><img style="max-width:95%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/dbf30c4c-3473-4465-bdde-200178941d66/072721_Uskwood.jpg" alt="An albino elf and a wolf made of shadows leap out of a tree at a pair of unsuspecting soldiers"></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Ian Perks from <em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em></p>
                   </div> 
                   <p>The attack came from nowhere. The shadow of the closest tree grew longer for but a heartbeat, and then two figures leapt from the dark canopy – one black as night, the other shiningly pale in comparison. Marcus barely had time to raise his shield before the dark creature was upon him; the sudden weight threatened to take his feet out from under him. He braced himself against it, shoved and was rewarded with the scrape of tooth on metal and wood. His sword arm burned, though, from the swipe of a horrid claw.</p> 
                   <p>“Wait!” he heard Calerio call. “We mean no harm!” A quick glance to the side showed his companion facing off with a slender elf dressed in leather armor. Wisps of shadow curled in stark contrast to the elf’s albino skin as he clutched a horrible-looking effigy made of bark, blood, and bone.</p> 
                   <p>The call came too late; as Marcus watched, the shadows stretched up and over the pale elf’s hand, convalescing at his fingers and shooting forward. The darkness <em>screamed</em> as it barreled into them, a horrible, high-pitched monstrosity of sound that ripped through both men. For a moment, Marcus couldn’t see, couldn’t hear, and was barely aware of the hot, fresh blood that gushed from his nose, tickled over his chin, and dripped from his beard.</p> 
                   <p>He shook his head to clear it, noting in his peripheral vision that Calerio had been affected by the <em>Shadow Blast</em> as well, but was already recovering and leveling his shield and trident at the elf. Marcus refocused on his adversary, and a momentary panic gripped him as he realized he’d lost sight of the beast. </p> 
                   <p>Then, there it was again, glowing green eyes across the fire, snarling at man and flame as though both were equal enemies. The fire brought definition to the strange, smoky animal. It moved like a hound, snarled like one, and had the bulk and weight of any trained dog, but its very being seemed to waver and meld with the shadows around it.</p> 
                   <p>If it wasn’t about to lunge again, Marcus might have wanted to ask questions. As it was, his arm was ready; he would meet this next lunge with a slice the creature would not soon forget. </p> 
                   <p>Fortunately, it never came. With a cry, Calerio rammed into the elf, yelling “In the name of our Master Zon-Kuthon, I bid you hold!”</p> 
                   <p>Wait… “<em>our</em>?”</p> 
                   <p>At the very least, it gave Calerio the moment he’d wanted. The albino elf twitched a finger, and the strange shadow-hound backed away from Marcus, though kept its otherworldly eyes set on the man. Wide-eyed and keeping his shield raised, the younger human kept alert, breathing rapidly and spitting away the coppery-tasting blood that trailed over his mouth. He took a step toward his companion.</p> 
                   <p>“You cannot claim to venerate our Midnight Lord and still violate our earth with that filth,” the elf spat, casting a revolted look towards the campfire. </p> 
                   <p>Calerio considered his words a moment before speaking quietly. “Marcus, extinguish the fire.”</p> 
                   <p>Marcus wanted nothing more than to question that order, but knew better, especially here and now. He carefully set about the task – tricky, when he wanted to keep his eyes on the adversaries. As he worked, he heard Calerio continue. “It was the fastest way we knew to summon one of the Shadowed faith, and our need is great.”</p> 
                   <p>“Your needs are unimportant to us, little shadeling,” sneered the elf. “There is a price to pay for calling on us.”</p> 
                   <p>“It is a price I agree to pay,” intoned Calerio, sheathing his sword. “Cheliax and Nidal have been allies for years. Our flames rise and give you taller shadows. And now, Cheliax needs the expertise of your sect.”</p> 
                   <p>“Why should the druids of Uskwood care about what is happening in the bright lands?” scoffed the elf. Another twitch of his fingers, and the shadow-hound approached, obediently sitting at the elf’s feet.</p> 
                   <p>The last, bright wisp of fire died, leaving only wood smoke and darkness behind. The green glow of the shadow hound’s eyes seemed all the brighter without the intrusive campfire. Even now, the pale skin of the elf was easily seen; he made no attempt to hide himself, and why should he? </p> 
                   <p>“Because there are mysteries there whose unraveling might be of utmost interest to the Midnight Lord – and both of our courts,” Calerio answered softly.</p> 
                   <p>The elf sighed. “Continue.”</p> 
                   <p>Marcus breathed. Calerio’s orders had seemed crazy, but they worked.</p> 
                   <p>“Recently we discovered a hollowed-out section of rock in the Menador Mountains. We thought it was just an unfortunate experiment gone wrong, or perhaps an old, weakened series of tunnels finally giving in to time, but once the debris was cleared, we discovered a strange item. A huge, porous stone, different from the stone of the mountain, twisting up into a point, like a giant stalagmite. It should have been crushed with all the other debris, but it looked…almost fresh. And it seemed to be…weeping.”</p> 
                   <p>The druid stayed silent, arching pale eyebrows as he considered Calerio’s words.</p> 
                   <p>“There was no place where the stone would have allowed water flow, and there’s no water source nearby, but we have seen it with our own eyes, and I swear it is weeping. Your sect specializes in the shadows and understand the natural order of things far more than we could. This thing seems to thrive in the shadows of what used to be sturdy rock. What’s more, if this weeping is magical or spiritual in nature, then none know more about suffering than the Uskwood druids.” Calerio paused, swallowed thickly, and then finished, “This discovery could be a godsend to both your masters and mine. I will pay any price you or your sect decree, in honor of our Midnight Lord. Will you help us?”</p> 
                   <p>Marcus watched as the albino’s head canted to one side, as though listening to the shadows themselves. After a long stretch of silence, he nodded once. Calerio seemed relieved and seemed to breathe a little easier. “Thank you.”</p> 
                   <p>“Do not thank me just yet,” came the elf’s scornful voice. “We may be traveling companions for now, but Zon-Kuthon will get his due, and you will be made to pay for each slight against him.” The elf’s long, white hair shone, waterlike, as he nodded towards the extinguished fire. His pink eyes lifted and rested on Marcus, then. “You both will.” The shadow-hound licked his chops at <em>Marcus</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Marcus felt his stomach sink. Suddenly, he wasn’t so relieved for the mission’s success. He’d have many questions for Calerio, once they were alone – if they ever would be, again.</p> 
                   <p>They wouldn’t.</p>

                   <p>If you are new to Pathfinder or an Adventure Path, welcome! The <em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path Player's Guide</em> is your spoiler-free introduction for getting started with this six-part adventure. Inside you will find the following background and rules for the campaign:</p> 
                   <p><b>The History</b>: The Magaambya was founded thousands of years ago by the greatest wizard the world has ever known. Follow the legacy left by Old-Mage Jatembe and his Ten Magic Warriors. Learn of the ranks within the school and the branches of knowledge students can follow. Every student stands tall upon the strength of thousands who have come before them in the ancient academy!</p> 
                   <p><b>Coming Together</b>: The Strength of Thousands Adventure Path begins as the heroes arrive at the Magaambya, their home throughout their adventures. Although the heroes must remain close to the Magaambya to learn their initial lessons, they’ll soon gain greater responsibilities and venture across the Mwangi Expanse—and beyond! Incoming students are grouped together in a cohort to support and learn from each other throughout their education. Rather than a typical adventuring party, the heroes of the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path are a cohort of diverse and dedicated students.</p> 
                   <p><b>Spellcasting for Everyone</b>: Even though any character class works well in the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path, a campaign where students attend a magic school wouldn’t seem very magical unless all the heroes can cast spells! The player’s guide contain rules that let characters who can’t cast spells (like fighters or rogues) dabble in a bit of magic. Heroes who can already cast spells get even more to expand their repertoire.</p> 
                   <p>The <em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path Player’s Guide</em> is written by Ron Lundeen. The cover artist is Setiawan Lee.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Howdy, everybody. Paizo Publisher Erik Mona here. I wanted to stop by the blog today to talk about some upcoming changes to our Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society scenario offerings in the months ahead. Because I spent many years as an active organized play player and GM before my publishing career and often tried to read the tea leaves behind changes just like these, I want to go over the changes carefully to make sure that no one draws the wrong conclusions.</p> 
                   <p>Over the last year, our organized play and editorial teams have taken a very close look at our department’s production cycle, reported player data about how often our scenarios are used, sales of individual scenarios, player feedback, and other information to get a better sense of how we can best focus our editorial efforts. We identified two key data points. One, the organized play team produces over 700,000 words of playable content every year! Two, an adventure does not need to have the Society logos to work well in the Society environment. With this information in mind, we’ve come to some decisions about the path ahead that we’d like to share with you. </p> 
                   <p>Moving forward, we plan to slightly reduce the number of standard scenarios released for both campaigns. Pathfinder Society will release 3 new scenarios for the season launch in August and the standard 2 new scenarios in September, November, and December. In October, we will release 1 new scenario.</p> 
                   <p>For Starfinder Society, we will produce the standard 2 new scenarios per month in August and October, but will release only 1 new scenario in September, November, and December. </p> 
                   <p>Overall, we will see a similar pattern in 2022, with slightly fewer scenarios for both campaigns (but at least 1 new scenario a month for both campaigns, and more than that more often than not). To help our community keep up to date, we will add a section to our monthly update blogs with the upcoming production schedule.</p> 
                   <p>Adjusting the number of scenarios doesn’t mean a huge reduction in overall Society playable content, as it allows us capacity to bring the popular Bounties program of self-contained shorter adventures to the Starfinder Society campaign starting in January of 2022, with six new Starfinder Bounties introduced over the course of next year, as well as publish new four Pathfinder Bounties for level 3 characters over the same period. </p> 
                   <p>Additionally, we are focused on having sanctioning ready at release for our popular new One Shot single-session characters-provided adventures for Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society play, with a half-dozen One Shots scheduled throughout 2022. Bounties and One Shots provide a different play experience than a standard campaign scenario. They are an important way to bring new players into the game systems and provide a great springboard into the organized play community.</p> 
                   <p>What’s it all mean in the big picture? Is Organized Play in trouble? Are Pathfinder and Starfinder failing? </p> 
                   <p>No. It’s none of that. Both campaigns are doing great and are an important part of Paizo’s present and future. These changes are an attempt to better balance the breakneck pace of our in-house editorial operation to improve quality overall, and to diversify our adventure offerings to provide a wider variety of play experiences, ideally with an eye toward adding more people to the player networks for both games. The more people playing Pathfinder and Starfinder, the cooler stuff we can do to support both games. </p> 
                   <p>We are committed to providing the best, most fun, most inviting and most inclusive organized play environment that we can. From time to time, that’s going to mean shaking up the plan a little bit and adapting to new opportunities. Rather than signs of trouble, these are in fact signs of health, and represent efforts to grow and nurture what we have all created together for these fantastic campaigns. </p> 
                   <p>For an exciting look at some of the upcoming plans for Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society, check out our landing pages for the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderSociety">Year of the Data Scourge</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shp9?Pathfinder-Society-Year-3-Announcement">Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a> seasons!</p> 
                   <p>Until next time, may all your successes be critical!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Twice have I been born, and with each birthing, I have gained a lifelong companion. The first companion was pain, learned the moment I was freed from my mother’s womb to the sight of my “father” standing over me with a drawn blade. Lord Bhrostra introduced me to my companion daily for years, finding new excuses to beat me and new ways to remind me that I was a blight on his house.

That pain made me strong, tempered me against hardship, and set my foot on the path toward my second companion: the whispers.</p> 
                   <p>Trapped in a dungeon for half a decade, tortured for the crimes of my sire, the whispers comforted me. They etched arcane runes in the hallways of my mind, told me the names of beings who could impart strength beyond anything I had dreamed of, and carved maps to ancient sites rife with power just waiting to be claimed. They’ve steered me toward ever-greater power since the moment of my emancipation: a scroll here, a spellbook there, a magic blade in the hands of an unworthy warrior. Each treasure a step closer to my destiny, each foe a whetstone sharpening me for the next task.</p> 
                   <p>The whispers that brought me here, to this barren wasteland of bloodstained stone between the orcish hold of Belkzen and the so-called Gravelands ruled by hungry undead. They told me that there once was a mighty black dragon named Sharzathinek who served the Whispering Tyrant and that her lair was packed with spellbooks and magical trinkets. Such treasures came from a time before the Tyrant’s mortal life, ancient magic from an era when today’s archmages would have been seen as scarcely more than street magicians. The whispers also told me that Sharzathinek was, quite conveniently, dead, slain in a battle far from her lair. Hidden in such an inhospitable place as this, perhaps the lair and its treasures have gone unnoticed, waiting to be found once more by their rightful inheritor.</p>

                   <p>The lair should be close now. I had to put my horse down several miles back when its hoof caught in a rocky crevice and its leg shattered. Perhaps I could have set the bone and poured a healing potion down the beast’s throat, but I have used up most of the supplies it was intended to carry, and I would prefer to keep my precious healing resources for a true emergency. The horse screamed something fierce before I ended its misery, and while the dragon whose trove I’m searching for is supposedly long dead, some other deadly creature undoubtedly hunts in these lands. Not even the orcs wander into this desolation, but something tore apart a band of ghouls just a few miles back. Something with claws, teeth, and… acid. </p>

                   <p>The whispers surge in my mind, reassuring me that Sharzathinek is long dead. I needed not the reassurance; a dragon as old as that one wouldn’t merely have torn the ghouls apart, its claws would have scored the stone, and its breath would have melted rock into toxic vapor. I suspect that Sharzathinek left behind a clutch of eggs or wyrmling spawn, a lesser dragon that has likely claimed its mother’s horde. I don’t fear such a lesser creature, though I’m not so foolish as to risk encountering it unprepared. </p> 
                   <p>I hear the faintest beating of wings far above me in the storm-wracked sky, and I use a scroll of protective magic to ward my body and equipment against acid. My blade leaps to hand with a thought and with it an array of powerful spells. No simple sword, my blade is fused with a powerful staff whose combat spells augment my specialized array of magic.</p> 
                   <p>With my body warded and weapon in hand, I scan the skies. Was that a flicker of a bat-like wing, large enough to hold a draft horse aloft? Or had my nerves simply fooled my senses? The whispers assure me it was no illusion, so I do the only thing that makes sense. I scream into the darkened skies, “Come then, beast! Come and face your better, wyrm! I have more important tasks than wasting time with you here in this gods-forsaken corner of nowhere!”</p> 
                   <p>The taunt works. I hear the faint beating in the distance become a deafening hiss, like the linen sail of a great ship tearing under the force of a hurricane. Foolish creature, too consumed by its own arrogant superiority to mask its approach. As it swoops towards me, for just a moment I feel the heavy dread of dragon-fear attempting to cloud my mind, but I brush it aside. I unleash a blast of lightning from my blade, wreathing its body in crackling arcs of electricity. I hold on to that power, grasping a fraction of its potential to wreath my blade in lingering electricity. The beast spews acid as it unleashes its deadly breath, but I sidestep the worst of the blast. The few droplets that reach me fizzle and fume before being extinguished entirely by my protective wards.</p> 
                   <p>As the creature’s momentum carries it past me, I step through space itself, appearing at its flank and driving my lightning-sheathed sword into its flank. It roars as the blade parts its scales and jolts of electric energy sear the exposed muscle and nerves beneath, but I’m not done yet. Stepping into the blow, I drive the blade further even as I unleash another blast of lightning. I can feel the electricity pulling my blade deeper as the monster’s body spasms uncontrollably, and I know that I have dealt it a mortal blow. Then its tail slaps me across the side of my head, sending my body twisting and tumbling.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>I woke up a few hours later with a splitting headache, my hair matted to my scalp with blood. The dragon’s body lay nearby… Headless? I may be skilled and deadly but surely my spell wasn’t that devastating. Crawling, and then walking as I regained my equilibrium, I moved next to the dragon. As I inched closer, I noticed that its head had broken through a thin layer of dirt and shale into a cavern beneath. In the darkness below, I saw the glitter of gold and gems as well as the occasional reflective silver of weapons and armor when a line of lightning cut through the sky above. Good thing I brought some rope.</p>

                   <p>I apologize for that, Starfinders. With Guidance still shut-down, it’s tricky to get intel to all of you agents out in the field. Don’t worry, though—tech issues won’t stop us from exploring the stars! I’ve pulled the available information about your next two available missions. Be careful out there, Starfinders!</p> 
                   <p>Author Rigby Bendele takes the Society to Verces, where Celita hopes to recruit an infamous hacktivist to help solve the Data Scourge digital attacks. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ro?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-404-Mission-Not-Found"><em>Starfinder Society #4-04: Mission Not Found</em></a> is best suited to a team with technological expertise and diplomatic inclinations. Don’t forget that Verces has been hit hard by the Data Scourge, so pack extra ammo and be ready for anything.</p> 
                   <p>Novice agents get a call to action when reclusive Venture-Captain Hilo Beruta tasks them with investigating a mysterious relic that can seemingly transport beings to different locations across the multiverse.

                   <p>While on a routine mission to catalogue a noble family’s heirlooms in Cheliax’s port city of Hinji, a team of novice Pathfinder agents went missing! Suspecting foul play, the Society dispatches a more experienced group to find these agents—or their remains—and put a stop to whoever might be hunting hapless Pathfinders in the streets of Hinji. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027rn?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-223-An-Agents-Obligation"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-23: An Agent’s Obligation</em></a> is an adventure for levels 3–6 written by Joshua Hennington.</p> 
                   <p>When the Pathfinder Society’s leaders first set their sights on distant Iobaria, they planned to establish a new lodge and solidify the Society’s reputation as the preeminent group of modern day adventurers and explorers. They knew the region was dangerous and had an extensive history—but they couldn’t have anticipated the true extent of what they would discover there.

                   <p>Speaking of written correspondence, it looks like there’s a bunch of mail piling up from several prominent Inner Sea lodges. <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpa">Some of it looks urgent</a>, but I’m sure it can wait another month or so while we handle these other critical matters.

                   <p itemprop="description">It all started when Starfinder launched and John Compton (lead of Organized Play development at the time) kept threatening me with a “Time Capsule Boon” where he’d let Pathfinder Society Characters transition into Starfinder Society. It was something of the atomic bomb equivalent of threats to be uttered in the office. The idea of crossing the streams between the campaigns was ludicrous. LUDICROUS, I SAY!</p> 
                   <p>Cut to a few years later: John had moved on to join the Starfinder team (ha, irony!), and the new Pathfinder Society developer, Michael Sayre, approached me with the historic line of “Hey, wanna do a crossover interactive?” Thus the idea of doing a crossover interactive between Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society was truly born!</p> 
                   <p>A few months later, during one of my in-person visits to the Seattle office, Michael and I got to deliver our pitch to both James Jacobs and Rob McCreary (the Creative Directors for both Pathfinder and Starfinder, respectively). Michael and I finished a whirlwind pitch that talked about time travel, navigating the Gap, and using the Maze of the Open Road to travel to far-off lands.</p> 
                   <p>In the ensuing seconds, you could have heard a pin drop. The only real sound in the room was the formation of sweat on the respective brows of Michael and I, as our ridiculous pitch was hurled at our company’s two creative visionaries.</p> 
                   <p>Then, with wide smiles, the two of them both joined in on the scheming! Dimension of Time, Hounds of Tindalos, Chronomancy and more were thrown at the wall as possible reasons and storyline elements for this outlandish plan, and the Organized Play Team had full buy-in from Paizo’s Creative Directors.</p> 
                   <p>Of course, Michael Sayre would go on to great deeds in his current role as a designer for Pathfinder. That meant that a new lead would need to step in and help, which brings Jenny Jarzabski into the fold. Jenny heard the wild plan of a crossover special and she immediately took the figurative football and ran with it, deciding to tackle the story on her end!</p> 
                   <p>So let’s listen to her explain what happened next...</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/631e6318-8669-4173-b5a1-50783f1db45b/072121_FELISE.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/631e6318-8669-4173-b5a1-50783f1db45b/072121_FELISE.png" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A dark skinned humanoid with short red hair, stands in a teal jumpsuit with their hands on their hips, and their blaster holstered "></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3a8ab5e7-2bdd-4413-80a7-e091a2f689d3/072121_HERAXIA.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3a8ab5e7-2bdd-4413-80a7-e091a2f689d3/072121_HERAXIA.png" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Artist Przemyslaw Golab.

                   <p>I’ve been tagged in! As Thursty said, this idea started before I joined the team, but I took over the narrative planning, and of course the development on the Starfinder side.</p> 
                   <p>Obviously, this special is going to feel different from the ones you’ve played in the past. First of all, this is an epic crossover event that spans time, space, and two different rules systems and settings! That’s pretty darn exciting by itself, right? But that’s not all! When our unholy trinity—John Compton, Thursty, and myself—got together to talk shop and brainstorm ideas for how to make this special, well, <em>special</em>, we came to a unified decision. Almost all of our previous interactives have been world-shattering events where the PCs play big damn heroes trying to save the whole world. It’s a pretty cool way to frame an event, but after years of this, the devs were engaged in a race against ourselves to make each year’s special bigger and the stakes higher than the last. This is not a sustainable cycle. Quickly, we found ourselves (and many of the players!) burning out and feeling fatigue from saving the world year after year.</p> 
                   <p>That’s why this year’s special won’t be about saving the world. This time, it’s personal. Based on notes from our brainstorm sesh, I crafted a heartwarming (or heartbreaking?) narrative in which the PCs can save a group of lost explorers. In order to experience the full story, you should play both the Pathfinder and Starfinder versions of the event. Now, if you’re not sold on the smaller-scale event, don’t worry. This plotline is epic—it involves a crossover between the Societies with both sides time traveling and battling extraplanar horrors, after all!</p> 
                   <p>Telling you any more would bring us firmly into spoiler territory, but I look forward to the results of your efforts to delve into mysterious ruins across two timelines and save maybe not the world, but someone’s world. Well, maybe you’ll save the world, too. Multitasking.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Veerkea’s life began at sea. Literally, of course: like almost all ijtikris, she hatched from a free-floating egg, grew as an instinct-driven larva for two years, and metamorphosed into her adult, squid-like body before clambering to shore, drawing her first breath of air, and searching for other ijtikris to adopt as her family.

Impressed by her outburst’s ferocity and considering this a sign the god Damoritosh’s favor, the local commander allowed the new unit to remain together.</p> 
                   <p>Part daughter, part mascot, Veerkea thrived under her myriad parents’ tutelage. Her formal education was straightforward: Veskarium lore, physical training, tactics, weapon proficiency, demolitions, and field repairs. Wherever the unit traveled, she absorbed languages, cultural norms, and local technologies even more quickly than her basic foundation. In her final year abroad, the unit operated alongside a predominantly shirren humanitarian mission on a survey of Swarm-ravaged worlds. Where survivors held out, the joint operation provided material aid, spiritual succor courtesy of the god Hylax, and assistance clearing out remaining Swarm hives. Where none had survived, the operation catalogued the damage and whatever remained of these now extinct societies. With each ruined world, Veerkea not only grew more intrigued by the compassionate teachings of Hylax, the Forever Queen, she also saw parallels between these ravaged planets and unanswered questions she had about her own home world. Who were the ijtikris really? And what were they like before the Veskarium invaded?</p> 
                   <p>To their credit, both the shirrens and vesk supported her inquiries. Her sergeant-mother, Bhaskeh, secured her what scant imperial documentation survived the pre-Gap conquest of Vesk-2. The more Veerkea read, though, the more the narrative fell apart, seemingly stitched together by placating guesses from fifth-hand sources. Even the venerated poem <em>Skyships Over Shallow Seas</em>, supposedly written by an eyewitness, began with “The skyships arrived with the monsoon rains,” yet the planet had never experienced seasons, much less monsoons. Veerkea had to learn more, and with Bhaskeh’s glowing recommendation to their superiors, the ijtikri secured admission to the prestigious Xakemath College of Cultural Studies on Vesk Prime. </p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/40ecbb53-a04b-4b7b-be5d-0b7e60b51792/092021_Nanocyteiconic.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/40ecbb53-a04b-4b7b-be5d-0b7e60b51792/092021_Nanocyteiconic.jpg" align="left" width="350" hspace="5" alt="A giant squid creature with two pairs of eyes in its elongated head is dressed in an environmental space suit.

The social sciences had undergone an uneasy revolution since the Silent War’s conclusion years before, but the Xakemath College of Cultural Studies remained a stubborn bastion of tenure and tradition. Its curriculum taught culture through the Veskarium’s lens: understanding Veskarium cultures as they fit into the empire, identifying fissures in alien societies to exploit during war, leveraging key cultural traditions in conquered peoples to minimize rebellion and maximize harmony, and exploring ruins to salvage forgotten technologies for integration into the military. In practice, Veerkea absorbed few affirmative lessons from her required reading, instead treating each record as another miscalculation in vesk xenoanthropology. Though she was too shy to challenge her instructors’ lectures in person, her essays became increasingly confident critiques of the field. Perhaps surprisingly, her instructors never punished her dissident thoughts. Instead, her essays registered as heartfelt challenge—like a young warrior boasting about her unbeatable combat style—and, by Damoritosh, the best way to test insolent claims was on the battlefield! They had just the site in mind.</p> 
                 <p>To her surprise, Veerkea graduated with distinction a year early, and with her diploma came her new assignment as archaeological consultant to a military operation on a no-name planetoid along the Veskarium’s frontier. The low-gravity rock was barren save for a crashed starship and the hundred soldiers forming a perimeter around it, with heavy weapons trained on the wreckage. The commander quickly checked her paperwork, asked if she was the negotiator they were waiting for and, without waiting for her answer, called out to the soldiers: “Make way! We’re sending in the archaeologist!” Giving her a datapad and a grim salute, the commander wished Veerkea luck and pointed her to the wreckage.</p> 
                 <p>She skimmed files as quickly as she could—wreckage that seemed to predate the Gap, advanced technology, initial successes by salvage crews…then attacks, robotic clouds that shredded flesh from the inside out, and several skirmishes fought to a stalemate. What a mess. She clambered inside through an airlock blown off by Vesk ordnance and began exploring and documenting the mysterious starship. Although unfamiliar, the technologies seemed intuitive, and she experimentally flipped a few switches to check for power. Something awoke. Rushing along the corridors, countless particles swarmed together into a roiling mass of nanites that screeched an unintelligible challenge. Veerkea froze, wanting to reach for her sidearm. Yet she spotted the bullet holes and triple gashes of doshko blades here and knew that not only had the vesk tried combat and failed, but also that her own methodologies were being put to the test. And so, she spoke.</p> 
                 <p>For more than an hour, the cloud and ijtikri spoke past one another, struggling to find some common linguistic ground. She drew simple pictures on the datapad, the cloud reshaped itself into simple pictures of its own, yet their slow progress seemed only to aggravate the strange being. Lacking a better option, Veerkea sketched Hylax’s sacred symbol. In an instant of apparent curiosity or recognition, the cloud calmed, slowed, and approached. As it formed pseudopods to touch the symbol, Veerkea lifted one of her own arms in greeting, and the cloud obliged by reaching out to make contact. With a touch, the ijtikri’s mind swam with the cloud’s projected telepathic thoughts.</p> 
                 <p><em>“I am the child of a devastated world</em>,” sang the voice, yet Veerkea thought the same words and knew them true of herself. Again, they projected their thoughts at each other, each saying, “<em>Mine is a history all have forgotten.</em>” A shiver rippled through the cloud, as though it were confused or pleasantly surprised by how closely their thoughts aligned. Embarrassed, Verrkea motioned for her strange friend to speak first, and the cloud obliged, reshaping itself into hazy silhouettes of skylines, landscapes, and people as it spoke. “<em>I remember so little: beautiful cities with soaring arches, rolling hills rising above purple seas, creatures whose names I don’t know, people with stories I have forgotten…and then here</em>.” The cloud stopped swirling and reshaping. “<em>Alone. Homeless.</em>”</p> 
                 <p>Veerkea’s eyes dimmed with sadness, and she offered her own tale of conflict, devastation, and dogma, yet also of compassion, camaraderie, and discovery. Of a young ijtikri who poked her eyes above the waves and found an unconditionally supportive family…and she ended her thoughts with “<em>Not alone</em>.” Less a statement of sympathy than a promise. Sensing an invitation, the cloud washed over Veerkea, settling on her before the particles painlessly melded into her skin. “<em>Not alone</em>,” it echoed. “<em>Home</em>.”</p> 
                 <p>Veerkea’s apparent victory impressed the Veskarium, with her superiors equating her taming the nanites to a warrior taming a wild defrex to use as a mount. However, Veerkea retired after only a few more years, using her earnings to travel the stars and catalogue forgotten societies’ stories. Her and her nanites’ thoughts are as one, yet on occasion and without warning, the cloud reshapes into some image as if reliving a forgotten dream or channeling some omen from Hylax. Veerkea is quick to catalogue these strange clues, certain that one day they’ll help her locate her passengers’ lost home.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">Nkayah yawned from her post in the tall tree. The job of scouting and protecting wanderers was always more exciting on the move. On the move, she had to stay on her toes, taking silent cover behind trees or climbing into the jungle canopy to maintain line of sight with the strangers and visitors who passed through Ekujae lands. She lived for the silent chase as she assessed outsiders’ motivations. For over a century and a half, Nkayah had ensured non-Mwangi travelers posed no threat to the Ekujae, and that they didn’t release any of the myriad evils trapped within the heart of the jungle—intentionally or not.</p> 
                  <p>It was an important job that Nkayah took with the seriousness it deserved, but it could also be incredibly boring. Like right now, as she strained to keep from nodding off while watching two foreigners talk about, well, something. It didn’t help that the dwarf and half-orc interlopers spoke a language completely foreign to her. It sounded similar to the Avistani language the Aspis Consortium agents from Bloodcove spoke when they needed to hide their awful deeds, but she had no linguistic training to confirm it. Despite not knowing what they were saying, the experience she’d earned over decades of training made her confident that their intent wasn’t malicious. But they were stumbling—loudly—through a very ancient Serpentfolk ruin, and that meant that they still posed a threat.</p> 
                  <p>She strained her jaw as she stifled a yawn and adjusted her position to ensure she didn’t get too comfortable. A wilderness nap could wait until the pair of foreigners moved beyond her territory and became someone else’s responsibility. Whatever they sought, the longer they spent out in the open like this, the longer they were in danger of needing more than just surveillance. Sometimes it helped to remember that even these boring parts of the job ultimately kept the innocent and defenseless wanderers of their lands safe, as well as protecting her people and the world at large.</p> 
                  <p>The dwarf and her half-orc companion let out a series of surprised shouts, snapping Nkayah’s attention back to the moment. Doubtless, she wasn’t the only one in the area reminded of the visitors’ presence by their arguing. They seemed at odds about what to make of one particular section of the ruin, a strange stone that Nkayah had never noticed here before. Perhaps the situation wasn’t quite as boring as she’d thought!</p> 
                  <p>She scurried from branch to bough, until she found herself balanced on a long, lonely limb directly over the foreigners. She was close to them, no more than ten feet above the half-orc’s head, so they could easily see her if they looked up, but they were too engrossed in the strange stone formation. As long as she didn’t draw their gaze, they wouldn’t be looking up any tiem soon. </p> 
                  <p>The formation was a cone of rough stone, nearly seven feet from base to point, that rose like an incisor from the ground. It wasn’t worked stone like the rest of the Serpentfolk ruin, and it lacked the ophidian motifs and iconography that denoted the ancient Ydersian structures for what they were. This looked both organic and completely at odds with the natural order, and it was no wonder it had so grasped the visitors’ attention. The dwarf held her hand a few inches from the stalactite’s surface, but didn’t touch it, as though sensing for an aura of evil.</p> 
                  <p>No, she wasn’t feeling an aura, but rather a steady stream of frigid air blowing from the stone’s otherwise smooth surface. Now that she recognized it, Nkayah could feel the steady airflow herself, and even at this distance. The chill made the skin on her arms prickle with gooseflesh. This certainly warranted more investigation, but she had to focus on her charges—the dwarf and the half-orc, not the ruin, which she’d be able to come back to once the pair no longer presented a threat. And the louder they got, the greater that threat grew.</p> 
                  <p>Doubtless, her counterparts from nearby were already on their way to see what the fuss was about. Nhayah shook her head and loosened the harness holding her weapons to her body. This was going to get worse before it got better.</p> 
                  <p>Her instincts proved accurate when the sound of arrows in flight drew her attention away from the outsiders and toward the edge of the ruins. She wasn’t the only Ekujae in the area anymore.</p> 
                  <p>The dwarf and half-orc were still loudly arguing about the cold stone tooth. They hadn’t noticed the arrival of Nkayah’s kin, and she knew they wouldn’t hear her either as she skittered effortlessly away, mere feet above their heads. Without losing sight of the foreign travelers, Nhayah darted in towards the site of the arrows’ impact.</p> 
                  <p>It didn’t take long to find one, embedded into the trunk of a gnarled tree: a darkwood arrow with dull gray fletching, clearly Ekujae-made. If she were on the ground, it would be at eye-level, meaning whatever they were shooting at was not terribly large. As she dropped down and pulled the arrow out to inspect it, her teeth clenched instinctively. Nkayah glanced at her surroundings to locate the arrow’s source, but knew her compatriots were as good at remaining unseen as she was. She’d see them when they wanted to be seen, just as they likely didn’t know she was there until she revealed herself.</p> 
                  <p>The arrowhead was tipped with cold iron, finely sharpened, and faintly tingling with magical energy that pulsed lightly into her fingertips. Though the spell was no longer active, she knew what its presence meant.</p> 
                  <p>“Demons” she hissed, still too soft for her charges to hear, even if they weren’t now yards away and engrossed in their investigation. She wished she could scream at them. <em>Leave it alone, you fools. Leave our lands and stop meddling in things you don’t understand!</em></p>

                  </div> 
                  <p>She pulled her bow from her back and swung back up into the branches with her free arm. She moved swiftly back to her spot where she’d previously kept watch and aimed her bow across the clearing in the direction she knew this threat would come from. She hadn’t yet determined whether the demon was somehow tied to the cold-air stone or simply drawn to the site by the outsiders, but regardless, the pair didn’t deserve to die at the claws of a vicious demon just because they were loud.</p> 
                  <p>The underbrush rustled as the threat approached, and she notched a cold iron arrow of her own. A hulking form, only partially visible through the jungle’s dense foliage, emerged. She fired. The arrow flew true, and the dark form hissed as its iron head burned across its demonic body. The dwarf and her companion, suddenly aware that they weren’t alone in the ruins, stared, paralyzed with fear, and barely mustered the strength to look up and see Nkayah above them, fearless, with another arrow at the ready. She released the bowstring; the arrow flew and then… darkness.</p> 
                  <p>She cursed as she dropped from the tree, racing for where her charges once stood, but could not find them in the darkness. The cool, constant airflow from the stone tooth let her know where it stood, where the dwarf and half-orc had been a moment before. She listened for their voices, but they were either too scared to scream or already lost. Then, her ears caught other voices, two of them, in her own tongue.</p> 
                  <p>“Hunters!” she called back in kind. “Speak again so that I may find you. I am a scout. I can navigate to you in this darkness.”</p> 
                  <p>The elves obeyed and signaled to her in hushed tones, somewhere off to her left. She made her way to them, slowly, not wanting to injure herself on a bit of the ruin she could not see. It took some time but finally, she connected with another form. The other thankfully stood firmly despite the collision.</p> 
                  <p>“I am Nkayah of the Bat Clan. My mother was of the Hawk Clan. You’re demon hunters?”</p> 
                  <p> The erratic sound of the others’ steps told her they were fumbling in the dark. “I am Kayoye,” the voice to her right began, “of the Velociraptor Clan. My mother is of the Gecko clan, and we hunt all forms of evil in this jungle. Today’s prey just happened to be a demon.”</p> 
                  <p>“And I am Dafiyi, also of the Velociraptor Clan. My mother is of the Python clan. The darkness should wear off shortly. This is not its first attempt to escape us today.”</p> 
                  <p>Nkayah sighed. Waiting without being able to see anything at all was incredibly frustrating, but she stood alert, with a firm grasp on her bow and an arrow at the ready. Soon, the demon’s magical cloak of darkness disappeared as swiftly as it had descended, and the dim, green-tinted light of the sun through jungle canopy flooded her sight. Finally able to see, the elves clustered together, back-to-back, and notched arrows, centuries of experience between them allowing the trio to work seamlessly as a defensive unit despite just meeting moments earlier. They rotated clockwise, six sharp eyes and six keen ears scanning the jungle from leaf-strewn floor to branch-woven canopy for any threat. The demon was gone, and no trace of the dwarf and the half-orc remained.</p> 
                  <p>Nkayah cursed and kicked a piece of rubble. She rolled the events of the past few minutes over in her head: the serpentfolk ruins, the new-yet-ancient otherworldly stalactite, the demon, and the demon hunters now flanking her. </p> 
                  <p>It was a coincidence. The cold-blowing stone and the demon were unrelated. That made things more interesting, perhaps, but also more complicated.</p> 
                  <p>Dafiyi stared at the ground in concentration and muttered an incantation to himself, then pointed to the east. “Kayoye and I still have a demon to kill. We found it before, and we’ll find it again. And you?”</p> 
                  <p>Nkayah surveyed the trees around her, searching for an answer. It came to her in the form of two familiar voices yelling in distress. The dwarf and half-orc were still alive!</p> 
                  <p>She nodded to her kin and smirked, “Sounds like I still have two charges that need my protection, and what do you know? They seem to be in the same direction! I’ll have to return to check on <em>that</em> later.” She tilted her head toward the mysterious stone amid the ruins.</p> 
                  <p>Swiftly and silently, she made her way through the dense jungle toward the frantic voices to the east. Dafiyi and Kayoye fell into step just behind her. This was more like it, she thought to herself. The job of protecting wanderers was always more exciting on the move.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">The Mwangi Expanse is a vast and diverse place. The region’s people hold a variety of beliefs that include gods not seen anywhere else. You can read about a number of these gods, including returning gods like Grandmother Spider and new gods like catfolk god Adanye, in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse">Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</a>.</p> 
                  <p>We here at Team Lost Omens thought it would be fun to take some of these Mwangi gods and match them up with other gods, both Mwangi and otherwise, to create new pantheons. Pantheons are groups of related gods that a faithful can worship as a collective, focusing on either a specific deity within the pantheon or following all of the gods together. You can find more information on pantheons in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic">Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</a>.</p> 
                  <p>Each of the following pantheons includes at least one Mwangi deity and can serve as a suitable faith for characters hailing from the Mwangi Expanse. We encourage everyone to use the following pantheons as examples when creating their own pantheons for home play. If you make your own pantheon or end up playing a character that follows one of the following pantheons, let us know!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5ee751e5-091b-438f-915f-ae14d3bb4b09/071621_majagua.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5ee751e5-091b-438f-915f-ae14d3bb4b09/071621_majagua.png" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A carving of Majagua, goddess of community.

                  <h3>Demon Bringers</h3> 
                  <p><b>Alignment</b> LG (LG, LN, NG, CG)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b> protection, retribution, and keeps<br> <b>Divine Font</b> heal<br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Strength or Constitution<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Survival<br> <b>Domains</b> creation, family, might, protection<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> cities, duty<br> <b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <em>mage armor</em>, 4th: <em>creation</em>, 7th: <em>true target</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> create fortifications and defenses to protect those who can’t protect themselves, improve your hunting abilities, seek out evils that threaten others<br> <b>Anathema</b> exclude innocents from safe havens, intentionally destroy a shelter, allow demon summoners to live on unpunished<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> machete</p> 
                  <p>The Mwangi Expanse is full of dangers. Of particular note are the various demons and other Abyssal creatures that roam the jungles. Many of these creatures are drawn to the Mwangi Expanse by the presence of Angazhan’s or Lamashtu’s might, while others are direct servitors of those faithful to the demonic. While the Mwangi Expanse is home to many demon hunters that keep these evil forces at bay, many of them work in independent groups. It’s only with the combined efforts of the demon hunters that the Mwangi Expanse can be rid of this demonic presence and the people of the Mwangi Expanse can be safe.</p> 
                  <p>The demon hunters among the Ekujae elves, Matanji orcs, Mwangi catfolk, Mbe’ke dwarves, and others began to join forces in their demon hunts and brought their respective gods with them. This led to the worship of a pantheon of righteous gods that both offered the might to destroy demons and the wisdom to defend others. Through the worship of Adanye, Chohar, Kazutal (in her form as Majagua), and Torag, these mighty hunters find the strength they need to make the Mwangi Expanse a safer place. While this pantheon didn’t originally have a name, the local Mwangi populations eventually dubbed them the Demon Bringers, as their faithful would bring home trophies in the form of demon heads, claws, or tails. Followers of the Demon Bringers use their skills to hunt demons and other evils that lie within the Mwangi Expanse. They also help create homes and fortifications for those that can’t fight, as the ultimate goal of the Demon Bringers is a safer Mwangi for all.</p>

                  <h3>The Freeing Flame</h3> 
                  <p><b>Alignment</b> CN (NG, N, CG, CN)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b> liberation, toppling tyranny, and self-realization<br> <b>Divine Font</b> harm or heal<br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Strength or Charisma<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Stealth<br> <b>Domains</b> freedom, change, might, protection<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> ambition, destruction, zeal<br> <b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <em>anticipate peril</em>, 3rd: <em>fireball</em>, 6th: <em>mislead</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> free others from oppression, release harmful tethers be they physical or spiritual, work toward your best self and inspire others to follow<br> <b>Anathema</b> allow tyrants to escape punishment after their reign ends, enslave or oppress others, prevent others from honestly expressing themselves<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> sword cane</p> 
                  <p>Local stories say that the people of Vidrian had the support of the gods when the time came for revolution. Lubaiko provided the first flames of rebellion, literally igniting the first cart that led to the initial confrontation at a plantation on the outskirts of Eleder. The tales then note that the casks on the cart erupted as the first blow was struck, creating a massive explosion that woke everyone on the plantation. Many say this was Cayden Cailean’s way of showing his support. As everyone stirred about and watched those first servants and slaves fight, others were fearful of the consequences. It was the touch of hope that Milani granted them that finally gave them the strength to rise up and fight for freedom.</p> 
                  <p>Whether or not the stories hold truth, the Freeing Flame remains a notable pantheon among the people of Vidrian today. The young nation broke free from the shackles of oppression and now looks toward bettering itself in the future, a mantra that many Vidrics and followers of the Freeing Flame follow for themselves. With the guidance of Milani, the courage of Cayden, and the inspiration of Lubaiko, a faithful can burn away maladies of the heart to become a person that is free to do as they wish, but also do so without infringing on others. Some follow these ideals to stop tyrants and liberate those that can’t live freely, while others take these teachings to become independent figures with little concern of others’ expectations.</p>

                  <h3>Sky Keepers</h3> 
                  <p><b>Alignment</b> NG (LG, NG, CG)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b> freedom, skies, storms, weather<br> <b>Divine Font</b> heal<br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Dexterity or Wisdom<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Acrobatics<br> <b>Domains</b> air, change (<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em> 112), protection, wyrmkin (<em>Gods &amp; Magic</em> 119)<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> freedom, lightning<br> <b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <em>gust of wind</em>, 4th: fly, 9th: <em>storm of vengeance</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> remove anyone that would threaten those who live among the skies, encourage others to find a way to live among the clouds, honor the might of storms<br> <b>Anathema</b> interfere with the natural phases of the sky, remove a creature’s innate means to fly<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> longbow</p> 
                  <p>The only thing more expansive than the Mwangi jungles, mountains, and rivers are the skies that rest above them. There are many who would seek to take control of the skies and there are others who seek to keep the skies free for all. From evil spellcasters looking to wield the weather for their own wicked whims to deadly monsters that make them dangerous to travel, the skies are never truly safe. Thankfully, an unlikely alliance of gods works together to keep the skies over the Expanse safe.</p> 
                  <p>Apsu, god of good dragons, saw how his son Dahak once tried to burn down the entirety of the Mwangi Expanse and took it upon himself to defend the skies that rest over those that put a stop to Dahak’s destruction. Uvoko, the diamond ring, is a living embodiment of the Mwangi skies and valued Apsu’s aid. Finally, with the recent release of Ranginori, the elemental lord took to reclaiming the skies from evildoers. When the three gods encountered each other, they formed the Pact of the Sky Keepers, dedicating themselves to both keeping the skies safe for all, but also maintaining the natural cycles and orders of the skies. The sky belongs to everyone, but ultimately, the sky has no master and attempts to force one’s will upon by forcibly changing the weather or committing similar acts goes against the Pact. Followers of the Sky Keepers can be found all over Golarion, but Apsu and Uvoko’s focus on the Mwangi Expanse leads to many worshippers operating in the region.</p>

                  <h3>Touch of the Sun</h3> 
                  <p><b>Alignment</b> NG (LG, LN, NG, CG)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b> compassion, rebirth, and the sun<br> <b>Divine Font</b> heal<br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Constitution or Wisdom<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Diplomacy<br> <b>Domains</b> family, healing, passion, sun<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> change, vigil (Gods &amp; Magic 118), zeal<br> <b>Cleric</b> Spells 1st: <em>soothe</em>, 2nd: <em>false life</em>, 7th: <em>fiery body</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> help others with changes that can improve their lives, mind those that others forget or exclude, offer second chances, stand up for others when they can’t stand for themselves<br> <b>Anathema</b> challenge the sun, ignore the pleas of others when you are able to help, refuse to give someone else a chance to offer their truth<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> rapier</p> 
                  <p>Legends state that Chohar, Luhar, and Tlehar were the first sun-kings of Mzali, building the city as a safe haven for the people of the Expanse. Their might, leadership, and kindness earned them a place among the heavens, transforming them into the sun gods of Mzali. As gods, they met Sarenrae, another goddess of the sun, and for a time, all four worked together to help the people of Golarion. Eventually, whether intentionally or otherwise, the people of Mzali forgot their sun gods. The sun gods watched as the people of Mzali forgot prayers and songs to their former gods. The sun gods wept because their people could no longer see or hear them, but Sarenrae offered them words of encouragement: there would be a time when people remembered the sun gods once more.</p> 
                  <p>Thanks to the efforts of the Bright Lions of Mzali, worship of the sun gods has returned to the Mwangi Expanse. While the sun gods appreciate this renewed faith, they did not forget Sarenrae’s kindness. When asked about their disappearance, the sun gods merely state they were biding their time alongside a friend. This friendship led to the worship of the three sun gods alongside Sarenrae as a greater sun pantheon. The collective sun gods teach that kindness and second chances are pivotal values. They also note that sometimes a person needs to change into someone new before they are truly themselves and instruct that helping others with these changes is akin to helping bring new life into the world. The four gods know that there might be other forgotten gods and peoples out there that just need some kindness to make it through their period of turmoil, so they ask their worshippers to help these forgotten in whatever way they can. Finally, the sun gods make it clear that lost or abandoned gods can still find companionship among the divine and welcome these gods to join their ranks.</p>

                  <p><b>Catfolk</b>: The majority of catfolk (also known as amurruns) live in southern Garund, in regions of the setting that had not yet seen much attention in Pathfinder Second Edition when the ancestry first came out. With the release of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, we now have plenty of support for people to craft stories related to catfolk characters.</p> 
                  <p><em>Change</em>: The catfolk boon is currently restricted to allow each player to purchase it only once. We’re removing this limit, so everyone can create multiple catfolk characters.</p>

                  <p><b>Hobgoblins</b>: At the outset of Pathfinder Second Edition, hobgoblins had just begun to establish a diplomatic force through the founding of the nation of Oprak. As word spread of the successful collaboration between Pathfinders and a hobgoblin army unit in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023dd?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-119-Iolite-Squad-Alpha"><em>Pathfinder Scenario #1-19: Iolite Squad Alpha</em></a>, some citizens of Oprak were inspired to join the Pathfinder Society via a program that allowed them to leverage their existing expertise to undergo a shortened training program at the Grand Lodge. </p> 
                  <p><em>Change</em>: The hobgoblin boon is currently restricted to allow each player to purchase it only once. We’re removing this limit, so everyone can create multiple hobgoblin characters.</p>

                  <p><b>Leshy</b>: The founding of the Verdant Wheel faction served as a recruitment catalyst for the growing number of leshys who have decided to join the Society. As members of the Verdant Wheel unlocked the secret of allowing anyone to establish enough of a connection to primal magic to call upon a leshy familiar (as seen in the Achievement Points store), word of the faction’s deeds spread among the more powerful nature spirits who are embodied in independent leshys. The player characters in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022x2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-115-The-Blooming-Catastrophe"><em>#1-15: The Blooming Catastrophe</em></a> fought against and ultimately freed a group of Abyss-scarred leshys from the influence of the demonic realm, some of whom took the opportunity to join the Pathfinder Society. New leshy agents include Jackpot from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027l2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-218-The-Fanciful-March-of-Urwal"><em>#2-18: The Fanciful March of Urwal</em></a> and a fungus leshy agent from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s7?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-1-The-Second-Confirmation"><em>Intro #1: The Second Confirmation</em></a>.</p> 
                  <p><em>Change</em>: Leshys will join the Pathfinder Core Rulebook ancestries and become freely available to all players who have the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide"><em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em></a> without a boon (just like kobolds are freely accessible to players who have the Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide). While we figured that the early access provided by boons was a fair benefit for a reduction from 80 AcP to 40 AcP that lizardfolk have, we wanted to grant something special for the other half of leshy’s price reduction. If you already have a leshy boon at the time that this change goes live, you’ll be able to redownload your existing leshy boon with an upgrade, granting the character the benefits of a successful resurrect ritual the first time they die, just like the Second Chance boon in the Achievement Points store!</p>

                  <p><b>Lizardfolk</b>: In southern Garund, the Pathfinder Society recently reestablished a long-lapsed trading arrangement with the trading city of Ekkeshekar, whose people are predominantly lizardfolk (also known as iruxis). Thanks to the successes of the player characters in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021x5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-109-StarCrossed-Voyages"><em>#1-09: Star-Crossed Voyages</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023fe?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-123-The-StarCrossed-Court"><em>#1-23: Star-Crossed Court</em></a>, iruxis from in and around Ekkeshekar have taken interest in the Pathfinder Society’s mission. The release of Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse provides plenty of new material for people to craft stories for lizardfolk characters from this general region of the world. Additionally, the events of the new scenarios Intro <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s7?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-1-The-Second-Confirmation"><em>#1: The Second Confirmation</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s8?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-2-United-in-Purpose"><em>Intro #2: United in Purpose</em></a> give the Pathfinder Society a chance to make new inroads with an iruxi settlement in the Blackwood Swamp. </p> 
                  <p><em>Change</em>: The lizardfolk boon’s price will reduce from 80 AcP to 40 AcP.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">That morning, several survey teams landed on the planet—which scientists back in the Pact Worlds had named Weydana-4—and began taking samples of the soil, the plants, and just about everything they could get their hands on. Long-distance scans had revealed that the planet had a breathable atmosphere, normal weather patterns, and an abundance of flora and fauna, but the corporate sponsors wanted everything double-checked firsthand and in advance of the hundreds of settlers that would soon be arriving.</p> 
                  <p>But Lixette de Courtois was born and raised on Absalom Station, and though she spent years studying newly discovered planets like this one from afar, this was her first time setting foot on one. And she didn’t want to spend it scrounging through the dirt. When Zheffori, a biologist from Castrovel, shouted in excitement after finding a pile of hardened droppings from some unknown animal, Lixette muttered an excuse of “getting a better vantage point,” put her datapad on a crate, and climbed the nearby rise.</p> 
                  <p>Her boots swished through the tall grass as she stepped out from the shade of several blue-leafed trees. The sun warmed her face as she fixed her gaze on the cloud-topped mountain range in the distance. Somewhere, a bird chirped. She took a deep breath of clean, sweet-smelling air and smiled. </p> 
                  <p>“I could get used to this,” she mused. The bird continued to sing, but Lixette couldn’t really say whether or not it did so in response to her.</p> 
                  <p>Lixette began to stroll along the top of the ridge until she caught the scent of something sweet. She stopped where the ground to her left became a sheer cliff. Approximately 150 feet below, an array of brightly colored flowers sprouted from a sprawling bush. Thick vines clung to the cliff face and reached all the way to the top, and vibrant blooms adorned these vines, providing the source of the fragrance. She squatted down to pluck one of the flowers, eager to bring it right under her nostrils for a good, long sniff.</p> 
                  <p>Suddenly, the vine shot up and wrapped around her wrist.</p> 
                  <p>Lixette let out a surprised shout. Again, the bird tweeted. Lixette was starting to think it was mocking her.</p> 
                  <p>She pulled against the vine, but it held strong. Much stronger than it had any right to be. As it pulled her arm downward, Lixette lost her balance and fell to her knees at the edge of the cliff. A dislodged pebble tumbled into the empty space and soon landed quietly in the bush below, which prompted some kind of reaction from the plant; its leaves and branches parted—<em>like an opening mouth</em>, Lixette thought—to reveal a collection of jagged rocks. Even from a distance, Lixette could see them stained with blood. The sun glinted off something white nestled within the stones: the bones of several small creatures.</p> 
                  <p>Lixette couldn’t help but be a little impressed at millennia of evolution that would produce such a unique feeding method. “Oh, you devious…,” she muttered while struggling against the vine trying to yank her over the edge. Its pull was insistent, and if she had been much smaller, Lixette would have already been dashed against the rocks below, her blood seeping into the soil to water this carnivorous plant’s roots.</p> 
                  <p>Looking down, she saw another vine slithering its way toward her. If she didn’t free herself soon, her size wouldn’t save her. Lixette cried out for help, hoping someone from the survey team was near enough to hear her, but there was no immediate response. Even the bird had fallen silent. <em>Traitor</em>, Lixette thought.</p> 
                  <p>The vine had now dragged her hand below the top of the cliff, and Lixette strained to keep her balance. She regretted not bringing anything to defend herself, but the bigwigs that sent her didn’t expect her to be traipsing off on her own. She had flaunted the protocols, and she would pay for it with her life. Lixette started to desperately pat down her jumpsuit with her free hand, hoping beyond hope that she had something—anything—that could save her.</p> 
                  <p>She almost missed it at first: a thin cylinder of plastic. It was the stylus she had been using to enter observations on her datapad earlier. She must have absentmindedly slipped it into her left-hand pocket earlier. With a triumphant cry, Lixette pulled the stylus out and plunged it deep into the vine. The plant reflexively spasmed slightly, just enough to loosen its grip on her wrist. She pulled herself away from the edge of the cliff, muddying the backside of her jumpsuit in the process. The vine flopped onto the ground, the stylus still jutting out like a strange, plastic thorn, before it slid down and out of sight.</p> 
                  <p>Lixette stood up and started to wipe the dirt off her legs but then thought better of it. She brushed a lock of sweaty hair off her forehead and suddenly let out a choked whimper of relief. The bird began to chirp again, as if nature was releasing its held breath. In a forgiving mood, Lixette smiled in the general direction of the birdsong.</p> 
                  <p>As she walked back down the rise to the rest of her team, Lixette realized she had never felt more alive. Perhaps it was just the adrenaline of a near-death experience, but she had a spring in her step and a new purpose dawning in her mind.</p> 
                  <p>Upon her return, Zheffori said, “Lix, where’d you go? Are you ok? You look a little… flushed.”</p> 
                  <p>“Never better!” she replied.</p> 
                  <p>“Okay then. Well, we’re all heading back to the shuttle, so get your last looks in for today.”</p> 
                  <p>Lixette smiled, knowing that once they got back in orbit, she’d be requesting a seat on one of those colony ships. “This place hasn’t seen the last of me.”</p>

                  <p>Four esteemed graduates from the College of Mysteries in Absalom are sent to a tiny desert village in eastern Thuvia along the banks of the Junira River. Rumor has it that everyone in this small community has suddenly developed magical abilities. Power that, if left unchecked, might spell their doom. Perhaps even more troubling, even those who just visit the town receive powers as well! Can these four spellslinging scholars work together to get to the bottom of this mystery before rogue magic tears the place apart?</p>

                  <p>Kwibha listened to the First Speaker of the Dragon Wardens with one ear, his attention more focused on keeping warm. By tradition, these yearly negotiations were hold on this flat mountaintop just across the valley from the city of Cloudspire, the air so cold that Kwibha’s breath misted forth with every heartbeat. His late sister Jhirabi, who’d been training to be a Dragon Warden, said the location actually had been chosen because there were few other places where one could treat with a half-dozen dragons, but Kwibha would never be so crass as to say so out loud.</p> 
                  <p><b>“…my rain-child’s third daughter is ready to leave the nest. It is time for her to have a territory of her own, a hoard and home atop a good tree. Do they still have that lightning-struck tree outside of Mua’bri…?”</b></p> 
                  <p>For a moment, Kwibha envisioned a group of stout dwarven farmers, dour-faced and heavily armed, accompanied by a whimsical fledgling dragon the size of a sheep. The farmers would likely be more dangerous. Still, one had to start somewhere, and it was upon these formalized exchanges of gifts, territories, and protection that the partnership of dwarf and cloud dragon had been built.</p>

                  <br> 
                  <p>Another hour passed, then a second and third, and Kwibha felt the frost harden on the white scarf around his neck. Snow crunched underfoot as he shifted his weight, and still the dragons and the First Speaker of the Dragon Wardens continued their talks. Kwibha cast a sidelong glance at the First Speaker—Jhirabi had said they were chosen for endurance as well as diplomacy.</p> 
                  <p>And then it was time.</p> 
                  <p>“Noble kings,” the First Speaker said, for all dragons are accorded the title of kings, “I present to you Second Speaker Kwibha of the Bloodmarked.”</p> 
                  <p>That was Kwibha’s cue. The dwarf strode forward, marshalling every scrap of dignity he possessed. To any other dwarf, Kwibha was a person of note, with his gold-embroidered kaftan of cashmere, amber-hilted sword, and the scarlet ribbon tied about his brow. The dragons, Kwibha fervently hoped, would be equally impressed.</p> 
                  <p>“Noble kings of sky and cloud, revered ancestors of the storm, you whose wrath is lightning and whose mercy is the rain after a long drought,” Kwibha’s voice echoed off the mountaintops, finely pitched to carry to the great beings clustered before him, “I come bearing an offer from King Thabsing of K’Lereng, called the Blood-Eye.”</p> 
                  <p><b>“And what is this offer, Second Speaker?”</b> one of the dragons whispered with a voice like the mist, soft yet inescapable. <b>“We have heard his plans of war before and have little interest in them.” </b></p> 
                  <p>“Today, he proposes not war, but justice, not battle, but execution,” Kwibha said smoothly. He held out a single hand in the traditional orator’s pose. “Know this, noble kings. On the last day of the dry season, in the pirate city of Bloodcove where they celebrate the Tempest Day, there will be a great auction of treasures taken from the drowned land of Lirgen. Most of the Pirate Council of the Shackles plans to attend, and we’ve heard that the Hurricane Queen herself, Tessa Fairwind, shall be present.”</p> 
                  <p><b>“And how do you know this thing will happen, Second Speaker?”</b> another cloud dragon asked in a voice that thundered across the mountaintop, causing drifts of snow to become tiny avalanches.</p> 
                  <p>Kwibha hoped they would ask him this. With a great flourish, he swept his arm out and bowed genteelly to the assembled wyrms. “I know this, noble kings, for I shall conduct the auction myself.”</p> 
                  <p><em>This</em> caught the dragons’ attention—and the attention of the Dragon Wardens, for that matter. Kwibha allowed himself a small smile. It had taken nearly two years to make the proper introductions, to pass himself from one pirate to the next in that stinking city. King Thabsing had provided the Lirgeni artifacts, from where it was not entirely clear, but it was Kwibha’s work that had brought this day about. Bloodcove was a very different place from the orderly, harmonious citadel of Cloudspire, a place of violence, greed, and broken oaths, but dwarves lived there as well. Buyers, mostly, to purchase the pirates’ stolen goods and send them back to the Mbe’ke, but a few disgraced sellers as well, who would trade with the Mbe’ke’s enemies. Kwibha had pretended to be one such, and he didn’t know if he’d ever feel properly clean again.</p> 
                  <p>“The Free Captains are no fools, and they will expect treachery,” Kwibha continued in the ensuing silence. “But they will expect it from each other or myself. Their ships will be moored at harbor, their sailors carousing, their lieutenants and weather-wizards accompanying their captains for protection. The vessels will be virtually defenseless in the face of a sudden storm, honored lords of lightning,” Kwibha paused, before adding the final bait, “and they will be heavily laden with loot from a season’s successful piracy.”</p> 
                  <p><b>“Your words intrigue, Second Speaker,”</b> said the senior-most dragon in a voice crackling with frost. <b>“We will weigh them and give an answer in three day’s time.”</b></p> 
                  <p><b>“A question, Emissary of the Bloodmarked,”</b> a younger dragon said, leaning forward such that Kwibha could see the new scars on their horn, <b>“Your king’s plan will destroy the ships, but what of the pirates themselves?”</b></p> 
                  <p>“A pirate without a ship, honored king, is like a turtle without a shell,” said Kwibha, his smile colder than the snow of the mountain. “With the Pirate Council trapped in Bloodcove, it will be a simple matter for King Thabsing to march his armies down from the mountains and take the city. And then we will try them, and we will sentence them, and we will hang these corsairs from every tree and doorpost.”</p> 
                  <p><em>And then, Jhirabi, you will finally be avenged.</em></p>

                  <h3>Laura-Shay Adams</h3> 
                  <p>Greetings, I am Laura-Shay Adams, a part-time writer and full-time nerd. The amount of excitement I experienced at being able to contribute to Senghor was probably not entirely healthy, but warranted. Getting to provide and create perspective regarding the day-to-day life within the city and fleshing out some of the prominent businesses made me fall in love with Golarion all over again. The setting has so many strengths, and using it as a creative backdrop to offer such a wide array of cultural flavors that add so much to storytelling is honestly a joy. Each Lost Omens book that has come out has become my favorite, but the <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> area will be near and dear to my heart for decades to come. </p> 
                  <p>If you are interested in seeing some of the homebrew projects I’ve come up with for my personal campaigns, one-shots, or my freelancer rates, drop by my website <a href="https://world-invader.com/" target="_blank">https://world-invader.com</a> or contact me via email, at contact.us@world-invader.com. Or if anyone is hosting a game set in the Mwangi Expanse and needs an extra player, I am your lady if our times align.</p> 
                  <br> 
                  <h3>Mariam Ahmad</h3> 
                  <p>Hello, I’m Mariam Ahmad (they/them). I’m a queer South Asian freelance writer, and I am so honored to have been a part of this book, my first with Paizo. For <em>Mwangi Expanse</em>, I had the pleasure of contributing lore on the Taralu and penning Amakell Inre and her draconic companion, Sahiba. My favorite part of this process was not just putting imagination to paper, but seeing it brought to life by the wonderful artists. </p> 
                  <p>I’ve also written for other indie games, such as Thirsty Sword Lesbians and Rookwood. When I’m not writing or working on cultural consultancy projects, I stream on Huetopia as the GM of Kahaaniyaan and run a podcast called The Musafirs. Both are all Q-BIMPoC actual plays that are set in Sarzameen, my custom South Asian fantasy setting. If you want to see updates on things I do, as well enjoy pictures of food, cats and fibre arts, you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/media_junkie" target="_blank">@media_junkie</a>.</p>

                  <h3>Jamal Brown</h3> 
                  <p>Hey What’s happening! I’m Jahmal “Mad Jay” Brown, and I’m a contributing author on <em>Mwangi Expanse</em>. The Karina, Solar Ibis and the Zinba are my babies! During the design process I imagined big encounters focusing on these creatures. I know you’re not supposed to have a favorite kid. . . but mine are the Karina!</p> 
                  <p>I also worked on Mzali and Senghor, two big and very different cities in the Expanse. The final product looks FANTASTIC! I’m glad I got to be a part of this project of so many amazing authors. You can catch up with my other works on <a href="http://www.madjayzero.com/#_blank" target="_blank">www.madjayzero.com</a>, and I am on twitter @madjayzero. I write about the games I run, game design, and facilitating game sessions. I’m currently doing layout work on my latest Kickstarter project, Lifted, a supers setting Zine.</p>

                  <p>Oh heck, back at it again with the writing! I’m Allie Bustion, freelance game designer and writer with indie projects of my own but also work on games like <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbian</em>s (“Shinsei Galactic Puroresu: Revolution - The Final Engagement”) and <em>Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants</em> (“The Scene Is Dead, Long Live The Scene”). I wrote a good chunk of things for <em>Mwangi Expanse</em>, but I think my favorite are the Song’o. I put a lot of the joyful parts of being Black from my childhood into them, and I’m super excited to share it with you all.</p>

                  <p>Hey there! I’m Sarah, an Afro-Latina writer and designer. For the <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> book, I got to contribute various locations in Mzali and Senghor and had a blast. The Mzali Archives, the Sunlit Inn, the Mixing Mingle, and Burash’s Lost and Found are just a few of the entries I got to dream up! I’m really happy with the finished product and grateful to get to contribute alongside all these wonderful people. In my spare time, I write stories, come up with my own games and homebrews, and craft!</p>

                  <p>Hi all, my name is Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, credited as Sasha Laranoa Harving, and I wrote the Taralu dwarves! I was really glad to flesh out a culture I’d worked on prior in the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Character Guide</em>’s dwarf section, and I am excited for you all to see what wonders it has in store. I’ve been involved with a number of third-party publishers for Pathfinder and Starfinder as well, and I live in Chicago with my fiancee and my roommate, both also regular players in my games. If you’d like to hire me for freelance work, you can reach me at condochimp@gmail.com.

                  <h3>Michelle Jones</h3> 
                  <p>If you’ve been paying attention, you should know who I am by now. If you’re new here, let me tell you. I am Michelle Jones, freelance writer and game designer. I got to write several of the deity entries for <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse</em>, as well as a couple of bestiary entries, and collaborated with some very talented authors to reintroduce everyone to the city of Mzali. If you wanna know more, be sure to check out my twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Aleshakills" target="_blank">@AleshaKills</a>. I will be going into more detail about everything I wrote the moment the book hits the streets. </p> 
                  <p>I promise you, <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> has everything you wanted and everything you didn’t know you needed. And Strength of the Thousands is gonna be possibly the greatest Adventure Path ever. I’m not biased just because my name is on it, I swear. See you all again on the 7th.</p>

                  <h3>Travis Lionel</h3> 
                  <p>Hello, my name is Travis Lionel also known on the internet as Rabbit. I worked on <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse</em>, specifically the sections on the People of Mzali and the Bright Lions. I did a lot of research on western and middle Africa as well as usede my own experiences as a black American and those of my African brothers and sisters. The most fun I had was studying how pre-colonized Africans lived among the Savannahs. Since working on this project, I’ve primarily been diving into video game livestreams via Twitch ( <a href="https://twitch.tv/EightBitRabbits" target="_blank">https://twitch.tv/EightBitRabbits</a> ). Here I talk about storytelling, how I learned to write and worldbuild, and, of course, role-playing games, such as <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>. For those who enjoy what I wrote and would like me to work on their projects as well, feel free to send business inquiries to <a href="mailto:Travis.TheBlanketFort@gmail.com">Travis.TheBlanketFort@gmail.com</a>. It’s kind of crazy going from the eleven year old in Catholic school turning biblical lore into super hero stories to where I am now. Hopefully, you guys enjoy the work many of us put into this project. </p>

                  <p>My name is Hilary Moon Murphy. In real life, I am a librarian, freelancer, and enthusiastic Organized Play Game Master. I am so proud to be a part of this book! I wrote the section on the Sodden Lands, which included both the flooded city Hyrantum and the fierce Terwa Lords. Being able to update Hyrantum and reimagine what has happened with that flooded city and the rest of the Sodden Lands was a true pleasure. When we last saw Hyrantum, it was a sad and downtrodden shadow of its former glory. But Hyrantum is undergoing a new boom with a surprising new group of immigrants. . .

                  <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
                  <p>Здравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! (Hello, dear readers!) My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may know me from past Lost Omen books, such as <em>Legends</em> (where I wrote Baba Yaga), <em>Ancestries</em> (tieflings and duskwalkers), and the <em>Character Guide</em> (humans). On those occasions that Eleanor and Luis don’t need my humble assistance, I’m a Russian-American historian and educator with a book and everything.</p> 
                  <p>For this book, I wrote the Mbe’ke dwarves, the Mwangi Jungle, and my personal favorite, the gnolls. My very first PC, way back in the misty depths of time, was a gnoll fighter, and I’ve been on a one-man crusade to get the loveable, furry lugs made into an acceptable PC ancestry ever since. Which, thanks to this excellent book, they are, so do check them out.</p> 
                  <p>I should also mention that when not writing for Paizo, I’m working on <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em>, an upcoming campaign setting set in a world of lost suns, teleporting rats, and people who can drink your personality traits. Check out our Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>! Our first Kickstarter project is almost ready to release, so keep an eye out for what’ll come next. You might like it.</p>

                  <p>I’m Jabari Weathers, and I’m excited for y’all to get to see my work on the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse</em> sourcebook for Pathfinder 2nd Edition. I had the honor of writing “Reclaiming the Expanse,” as well as penning the cities of Jaha and Osibu for the book. </p> 
                  <p>Earlier this year, you may have read my work on <em>Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</em> with Wizards of the Coast, and if you follow my twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/GoblinPrincete" target="_blank">@Goblinprincete</a>) or Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/jmwillustration/" target="_blank">@jmwillustration</a>), you can also gander the illustration work that I made my way into TTRPGs with and catch whisperings about game design and writing thoughts when I’m not spinning too many plates. Also, feel free to check out my illustration website—<a href="http://goblinprincete.com/" target="_blank">GoblinPrincete.com</a>.

                  <p itemprop="description">The first volume of the Horizons of the Vast Adventure Path, “Planetfall,” is out now, but whenever your group plans on jumping into this campaign, you’ll want to make sure you’re prepared for whatever the planet of New Harmony throws at you! And there’s no better resource for that than the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>.</p> 
                  <p>With hexploration rules used to survey the land (and which are summarized in the adventure) and deep dives on individual biomes, the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> is a treasure trove of information for Game Masters about to run Horizons of the Vast. For example, GMs can find advice and tables galore that will aid them in creating engaging NPCs and settlements that will help the PCs’ new home come to life. And if the characters decide to go exploring beyond the boundaries of their charter, there are plenty of random threat tables to keep them busy!</p> 
                  <p>But the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> isn’t only for GMs! Players about to take on the monumental task of exploring a new world and maintaining a thriving settlement there will find plenty of exciting tidbits in this book. In addition to a wealth of options for every class (as discussed in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpm?A-Galaxy-Of-Character-Options">this previous blog</a>), there are also dozens of items that will help burgeoning explorers tame and survive just about any wilderness. Here’s one example:</p> 
                  <h3>Energel Food Pellet</h3> 
                  <p>Energel food pellets are easy-to-swallow meals in pill form, capable of staving off starvation, though they lack the appropriate nutrient profile needed for long-term sustenance. You can substitute one pack of food pellets for a day’s food. If you’re already starving when you consume energel food pellets, you automatically succeed at your Constitution check to avoid nonlethal damage that day, but the effects of starvation resume the following day. You cannot benefit from consuming more than two packs of energel food pellets per week.</p> 
                  <p>New Harmony is in a system in the Vast and, as such, regular supply runs from the Pact Worlds will be few and far between. A canny survivalist will want to have some energel food pellets on hand in case they end up stranded far from the nearest settlement after running out of rations. Sure, they don’t replace regular meals, but staving off starvation for a day or two could give a character the time to hunt down a wild beast or determine which alien berries are safe to consume.</p> 
                  <p>So, as you’re packing to begin your new life on New Harmony, don’t forget your <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. It could mean the difference between life and death!</p>

                  <h3>Gristleburst, Inquisitive Pyromaniac</h3> 
                  <p>Gristleburst grew up among the Gullcracker goblins outside of Otari, but he was always a loner. His irrepressible curiosity and keen mind for chemistry earned him few friends among the goblins, even though his firebombs were always a source of good fun. When the Gullcrackers were killed and reanimated as zombies, Gristleburst took on the lonely, sad task of putting down each one of his former kin. He now wanders the world as an alchemist-for-hire, just as eager to investigate unusual mysteries as he is to set things ablaze.</p> 
                  <p>Gristleburst is an unreliable ally. He’s quick to make friends—particularly because he’s otherwise all alone in the world—but he frequently pursues his own ideals without consulting his allies and hurls his bombs with reckless glee.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3e5c6ada-6ed4-47da-b05d-f218e2831057/070921_Gristleburst.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3e5c6ada-6ed4-47da-b05d-f218e2831057/070921_Gristleburst.png" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="a goggle-wearing goblin has scraps of paper stuck to his leather armor, and wields a bomb with lit fuse in one hand"></a>

It remains potent only until the end of his next turn. When he throws this bomb, in addition to its normal effects, it creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot radius burst.

                   <li>The heroes are hunting an arsonist, and Gristleburst can help identify blast patterns and accelerants the arsonist used to set the blaze. </li> 
                   <li>Gristleburst’s reckless alchemy inadvertently sets a stand of trees or a building on fire, and he needs urgent help to put the fire out before it spreads. </li>

                 <blockquote> 
                  <p itemprop="description">From low atmospheric orbit, the crashed starship could have easily been mistaken for some great beast, slain in the heat of battle. Its trajectory had cut a fiery and destructive swathe through thick jungle, and here and there small bits of flame still licked at the foliage, the steaming soil smoldering from the heat of the starship’s unexpected collision, ending at its broken corpse. The hull had been nearly rent in two upon impact, and shorn wiring, ducting, loose crates, and coolant spilled from within like mechanical viscera.</p> 
                  <p>As the day bled into twilight, from within the darkness of the starship’s carcass, a life pod beeped rapidly. Kasa took a pained gasp as she regained consciousness. She moved stiffly, feeling the distant ache of what might have been a grievous injury. The life pod had flooded her system with medical stabilizers, a failsafe to ensure functionality in the event of a crash. As Kasa’s mental defenses churned into place, laced with the glittering edge of the medical stimulant’s side-effects, she knew somehow that things couldn’t possibly get much worse.</p> 
                  <p>For a while, she lay in the coffin-snug pod that had saved her life, her breath loud and metallic, her ears straining to hear anything beyond from the stillness of her tight confinement. Wherever the ship had made planetfall, she was likely safest in the life pod for the time being. Kasa’s mind raced. Her eyes grew bleary with the threat of tears as panic took hold in the illogical part of her brain. She blinked them away, taking a deep breath and slowly counting objects within her view, a tool she adopted long ago to help regain her composure when stressed. She was a scientist, first and foremost, and that meant shedding fear of the unknown by making it known.</p> 
                  <p>With a grunt, Kasa found the panel along the wall near her thigh, fingertips gliding over the interface to release the magnetic locks. The life pod’s lid slid aside with a hiss, and she gingerly hauled herself over the lip and waited for her vision to adjust to the darkness of the life support chamber. Blinking as shapes came into sharper focus, the shadows slowly brightening to shades of illuminated gray, Kasa made her way aft, stealing glances at the other life pods, all empty or crushed, she noted with dismay.</p> 
                  <p>As a scientist, she hadn’t been needed on the bridge and thus had no idea where in the universe they—no, it was only <em>she</em> who remained—could be. She knew, as the silence of isolation stretched ever onward during her tentative search, that anybody who could answer such a question had been killed in the impact. What magic or science could divine her location and see to her rescue was lost for now. Perhaps even for good.</p> 
                  <p>It took her the better part of an hour to dig through the med-bay, salvaging what stimulant packs she could find. The armory had survived the crash, as had its door, which remained barred to her without proper authorization. Kasa stared at the flickering interface, which flashed warnings and reported on various system malfunctions that could be distilled into a single message: without brute force or proper authorization overrides, she would find no weapons here.</p> 
                  <p>That first night under alien stars, she was fitful and skittish. Several times she nodded off, until fear exhausted her and she shut her eyes out of necessity.</p> 
                  <p>Dawn came on suddenly, and Kasa was reminded that this world, its atmosphere, its sun—or suns—were all variables in the new problem that unfolded before her. She blinked wearily as her dry, exhausted eyes pricked in the alien air. With a grunt, she unfurled herself from her crouch, stretching and shouldering her pack. If the shuttle bay was intact, there was bound to be something working. She rationalized that it had to be so; no circumstances could be so dire, after all. Unfortunately, her path to the shuttle bay was too obstructed for her to climb through, and she realized she would finally have to go outside and see if another path presented itself. She backtracked but found that the only way out would be up, through the ship’s now-open overhead. Beyond, she could only see the forest canopy, still but for the occasional rustle of leaves, the cries of unfamiliar fauna.</p> 
                  <p>Grimly, Kasa began her ascent, using the ship’s exposed wiring to haul herself up and onto the outer hull. It was a great effort, and had any been there to witness her summit, they would have found her sprawled across the sun-warmed hull, catching her breath before she finally sitting up to look around.</p> 
                  <p>All around her was dense, writhing jungle: trees as tall as towers, with thick, obdurate vines crawling possessively around their trunks and boasting vivid blossoms with pollen-rich stamen. Try as she might to place the flora around her, nothing in the catalogue of her mind recalled even the slightest comfort of familiarity. She shielded her eyes against the harsh glare of the sunlight that beat through the treetops and discerned, just barely visible through the overgrowth, a trail. It may have been abandoned, but a trail meant this place was once inhabited, and that would suffice.</p> 
                  <p>Fear of the unknown gave way to Kasa’s inherent curiosity, and she picked a path along the curve of the ship’s hull toward the shuttle bay. Much of the vessel had broken apart in the crash, and she made short work of climbing down into the massive bay. The collapsed half of the starboard bulkhead had taken all but one of the three Explorer vehicles with it, but the remaining Explorer sat almost pristine, save for a single crack along the window shielding. Kasa let herself smile at the first good news she’d had since waking up.</p>

                  <p>Kasa ripped through the jungle in the Explorer for hours, following the ancient overgrown path. She took her time, checking for signs of intelligent life, and for a while she thought all she would find would be jungle. But then the path opened into a wider avenue; not quite paved, but clearly marked by the deliberate imprint of civilization. She brought the Explorer to a halt, peering through the windows to see jungle give way to more deliberate architecture. This ruin, though empty of all life, was the surest sign of someone having lived here. Kasa popped the hatch and climbed out of the vehicle to have a look around.</p> 
                  <p>Whatever else this was, it was a discovery—one that none but the forgotten ghosts of those who once called this place home would bear witness. Kasa lamented not being able to salvage her research equipment as she stood in the clearing, taking in the moss-draped, domed towers like ancient mushrooms and arched doorways that stood like portals to another world, waiting to be opened. Though the ruin had collapsed around them, surrendering to the jungle, these remained, all seemingly built for beings much larger than she.</p> 
                  <p>“Giants?” She wondered incredulously, her first word in hours, voice dry and reedy from disuse. She turned a slow circuit, once again frowning at her inability to recognize any of the architecture, its design at once ancient but still entirely too alien for her to get even an echo of familiarity from it. Something about the jungle here was quieter, as if the order once imposed upon it still lingered, beating back all save the hapless moss that crawled along the ancient stone. She soon saw why.</p> 
                  <p>The thing—the <em>monolith</em>—was massive, jutting from the ground like a spear, and indeed was so anachronistic in comparison to its surroundings that Kasa wondered how it wasn’t the first thing she noticed. It was metal of some kind, she could tell from first glance, emanating soft blue light from the markings along its surface. Unlike the rest of the structures, it didn’t seem to warp to the ruinous touch of time, and the vines of the jungle barely forayed onto its massive base, as if the jungle itself were hesitant to claim the invasive structure. Kasa craned her neck to peer upward. Its length seemed to vanish beyond the forest canopy, bathing her in its light.</p> 
                  <p>Tentatively, she raised a hand, reaching out toward it. Perhaps it was an interface, albeit an ancient one. There could be no harm in a simple touch.</p> 
                  <p>There was a sudden rustle, and bursting from the copse of trees beyond the ruin came several avian-simian creatures, taking wing in unison. Fleeing.</p> 
                  <p>Kasa took one more glance at the monolith, rummaging in her pack for a datapad she’d salvaged from the wreckage. The device flashed cheerful yellow warnings that there was no communications node available for outside access, but she could still use the local capabilities. She did her best to scan and document the relic before her, sweat prickling the nape of her neck as she began to realize that she was no longer alone in the ruins, and that whoever—or whatever—had sent the creatures into startled flight would be upon her soon.</p> 
                  <p>She turned, backing up to the monolith, the security of its solidity offering her the only comfort and protection she could find in this alien world. With her head against it, she could hear it thrumming—a faint, rhythmic buzzing that seemed to come from deep underground, wherever the spire’s roots held it firm to the jungle floor. Beyond that sound, Kasa heard and saw nothing. The alien creatures had fled, leaving her alone with the monolith.</p> 
                  <p>As suddenly as lightning, the thrumming stopped, and in its place—in her mind—Kasa heard, <em>felt</em>, a high-pitched shriek. There were words in the cry, or the feeling, the meaning, behind words.</p> 
                  <p>“<em>Help us</em>,” they pled. “<em>Help us, Kasa! Free us…before it returns</em>.”</p>

                  <p>Don’t miss the introduction on this book! Written by the stellar Jabari Weathers, you may have seen snippets from this section floating around Twitter and other wilds of the internet. This section offers prompts to consider when building your character—whether you’re a visitor to the Expanse or were born and raised there—as well as advice on how to venture into the setting respectfully if you’re not sure how to approach it. After that we delve into the major social aspects of Mwangi: the history of the land, the people who live in it, and the gods who hold heavy influence over the region.</p> 
                  <p>The Expanse is still a world of adventure, however, and as we move into more specifics, we get into the geography of the region. We’ll trek across mountains, savannahs, and jungles of the Mwangi before finally reaching nine of the region’s greatest nations and cities. Risk pirate havens, explore mysterious cities with dangerous histories, catch fish in the Hurricane Harvest when the tides rush through the streets, or try to find a legendary paradise in the mortal realms! But beware, the final pages of this book contain a bestiary of monsters that lurk, waiting for adventurers to blunder into their lairs!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3cb78374-4780-4f9a-88c3-a407b93cc388/20210707-paulus.png"><img width="300" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3cb78374-4780-4f9a-88c3-a407b93cc388/20210707-paulus.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt=": A half-elf woman dressed like a researcher.

                  <h3>COVID Sucks</h3> 
                  <p>About two months before the final drafts for the Mwangi Expanse were due, the COVID shutdown hit the United States in full force. As you can imagine, it wreaked havoc with book production.</p> 
                  <p>I was one of the luckiest ones. I kept my job, my immediate family was safe, and Paizo gracefully pivoted to work from home. Completing the book was still an unmitigated nightmare, one that caused multiple sleepless nights and minor mental breakdowns over the course of the year. For many of the freelancers on the project, it meant sudden financial insecurity, unexpected full-time childcare, family emergencies or deaths, and even worse. The government response at the time was deliberately inadequate and--yes, I will say it--racist, and was combined with the absolute despair of the constant police brutality that was highlighted during this time.</p> 
                  <p>I’m not saying this to invoke pity, encourage token platitudes, or glorify the heroic effort the authors went through to get this book done--even those who had to bow out in the end. It was heroic, but what happened shouldn’t be glorified. I’m saying that so when everyone sees the final product, they understand just how incredible the people who worked on it are.</p> 
                  <br clear="all"> 
                  <h3>We Messed Up</h3> 
                  <p>No matter how much time and effort we put into developing and editing a book, something wrong always manages to slip through. Some are annoying but mild, like spelling “uncommon” wrong a dozen times in a row. Some are just funny, like the sarcesian in First Contact that dealt 1d810+5 damage with a sniper rifle. And some we can only stare and ask, “how the <censored>
                     did we miss that??”
                   </censored></p> 
                  <p>Mwangi has one of those <censored>
                     moments.
                   </censored></p> 
                  <p>We fixed the errors in the PDF versions but didn’t spot them in time to alter the printed books. Gripplis have the wrong ancestry bonuses in the printed copies. As a result, they lack the correct ability score boosts (Dexterity, Wisdom, and a Free boost, plus their Strength penalty). The ancestry also has a line noting “others probably assume [gripplis] are savage, simple-minded, or both.” It was meant as a note that such assumptions were flawed but didn’t convey enough context to be appropriate in any sense. Moreover, that language specifically violates our own guidelines on how we talk about people. Our developers and editors know to remove those words on sight to avoid situations like this. However, due to a process issue, this was flagged during production but not actually removed. We’ve instituted new procedures to prevent words like this from ever making it to print.</p> 
                  <p>We’re sorry and will continue trying to do better.</p>

                  <p>Inside you will find answers to the questions, “What is Project: Horizon” and “Why us?” There are tips on how to prepare to be far from home where it can take several days, possibly weeks, for messages to reach your patron and for responses to arrive in turn. Find guidance on how to fill your roles as administrators, overseers, and managers of a slice of New Harmony, with all the responsibilities those roles entail. You can also find character options like The People’s Champion feat which enables you to draw confidence and dedication from the sheer number of people who depend on you. Or the new beastblood theme, described below.</p>

                   <p>You have a powerful affinity with the beasts of the wild. Perhaps you descend from—or were infected by—a lycanthrope or similar creature, were subjected to the rituals of a beastly fiend, or performed ancestral trials to pledge yourself to a beast spirit. Whatever the source, you fight and hunt like a wild thing, and you know the natural sides of most worlds like you were born upon them. </p>

                  <p>Today, let's go through these questions as we build a character of our own! Meet Bolani, an elementalist (upcoming in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic">Secrets of Magic!</a>) from the Mwangi Expanse. </p> 
                  <p>Our first prompt: “What has your home taught you?” Having a character’s home be central to their personality, challenges, or worldview can be a good way to delve into a new concept. </p> 
                  <p><em>Though the Mwangi Expanse hosts countless cultures and many powerful civilizations, the vastness and abundance of the land is an undeniable facet of everyday life. The mighty fortress of Senghor plies the sea for netfuls of fish, while the trade city of Kibwe hauls up tons of ores from the earth to fill its marketplaces. Experiencing the turning of the seasons, from the fires and droughts of the savannah to the monsoons of the rainy season, has taught Bolani the true power of the natural world. Humanity can attempt to harness or control the elements, but in the end, such measures will always fail—it is far better to learn the power of each element and adapt to them.</em></p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/64492099-cc69-4bc7-a0a5-5c20c68da27b/070221_bolani.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/64492099-cc69-4bc7-a0a5-5c20c68da27b/070221_bolani.png" align="left" width="350" style="Bolani, a woman wearing a dark outfit with a blue scarf and elegant red cloak"></a>

                  <p>Our second prompt: “What remains mysterious to you about home?” I’m sure that none of us knows every last fact about our hometowns, neighborhoods, or countries—there’s always room for one more unknown fact to discover or a bit of history to unearth. When a character has questions that they’re trying to get answered, that can give a personal angle to their adventures, and Pathfinder is about adventure, after all! </p> 
                  <p><em>Bolani mastered many skills in pursuit of elemental mastery, not the least of which is geology. She brags that she can determine where she is in the Mwangi Expanse simply by feeling the rocks through her toes. Yet a few times over her career, she has encountered pieces of stone that elude her understanding—statues that do not seem to belong on this continent, tiny chips that seem to be literally beyond this world. Could these be relics of the Azlani, who ventured into the Expanse to defeat the serpentfolk god Ydersius and then seemingly departed without settling? Might these be related to the Doorway to the Red Star, which has fallen into disuse and mystery since the days of Old-Mage Jatembe? Or might these be crumbling remains from the Abyss itself, trod into the soil of Mwangi by the hooves of a demonic army that even now still lingers?</em></p> 
                  <p>Lastly: “What are you protective of?” This can be something immediate, like a family member, but it can also be something a bit larger. What kind of changes scare your character most, and why? Is there something that they are working to preserve or even change about their culture or home? Figuring out what your character wants to protect can be a good way to give them direct ties and make their home feel lived in. </p> 
                  <p><em>When Bolani was young, she could speak to the plants and elements of her home and hear them clearly in response. Now that she is older, she has found that these conversations harder for her to accomplish, and often become garbled or strained messages. She does not know if this is due to some change in her own self or if something terrible is happening to her home, beneath everyone’s notice—no one else she has spoken to has reported such a problem, which leaves Bolani uncertain and troubled. Whatever the cause, her connection to her childhood home is precious to her, and Bolani wishes to reestablish the connection and determine what went wrong to prevent it from occurring again.</em></p> 
                  <p>Bolani is just one character, and there’s a whole Expanse to explore! Tell us about what kind of characters you’re planning to create, and how they might feel about their homes!</p>

                  <h3>Red Waves Aflame — Moderate 15</h3> 
                  <p itemprop="description">The city of Bloodcove, on the western coast of the Mwangi Expanse, is one of the region’s major port cities, a veritable melting pot where a merchant can find any item they’re looking for, a traveler can find any dish to fill their belly, and an outlaw can find any number of places to lay low. While it’s named for the crimson waters that flow between its giant mangroves and reflect the burning sunset, the city is also a chaotic one. Pirate captains and cutthroat merchants vie for control and brawls are tolerated as long as they don’t cause to much disturbance, providing another possible interpretation of its name.</p> 
                  <p>Lately, several of the fishers in one of the city’s docks, as well as nearby restaurant owners, reported receiving threatening messages demanding a share of their catch and profits in an obvious protection racket. Though such a thing is hardly unknown in Bloodcove, the growing presence of some local Firebrands has empowered the dock workers to resist the scheme, and they’ve even managed to drive off a few pirates come to collect. The last such tussle ended with the pirates threatening that their leader was going to send “a collector” next time, and the merchants worry that things are getting beyond their ability to handle.</p> 
                  <p>The adventurers have been called to the docks to make sure everything’s well. After a few minutes, the “collector” surfaces in the bay. A maliadi—a hippo-like beast as greedy as it is massive, known for taking tribute from those it considers its lessers—emerges from the water and begins to rampage. The adventurers must stop the creature before it can make its way deeper into the inland markets, and maybe find out who sent it there in the first place!</p> 
                  <p><b>Creature</b> The maliadi remains in the water initially, attacking from range using fire magic like <em>produce flame</em> and, if necessary, <em>volcanic eruption</em>, relying on its collar of fire to stymie incoming attacks and attempting to separate PCs from each other using its wall spells. If targeted by magic, it uses its Counterspelling Wall and then, seeing this as a challenge to its dominance, charges down the spellcaster who would be so presumptuous as to use magic against it and attempts to Swallow them Whole. When reduced to 30 Hit Points, the maliadi tries to flee by turning itself into a river; if caught after this point, it recognizes its defeat and is willing to give up the names of those who called it here, possibly leading the PCs to their next encounter in Bloodcove.</p> 
                  <p><b>Rickety Docks</b> The docks here are all either old, floating, precariously built over mangrove roots, or a combination of all three, and in any event were hardly made to withstand a rampaging Gargantuan hippopotamus. The maliadi can Capsize the docks as if they were boats of Huge size. </p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3e51327b-e54c-4881-a740-737eb86d99b4/070221_bestiaryintro.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3e51327b-e54c-4881-a740-737eb86d99b4/070221_bestiaryintro.jpg" align="left" width="50%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A large hippo-like creature rampages through a crowded street, breaking buildings as it moves.

                  <p><b>Collar of Fire</b> (abjuration, fire, primal) The maliadi has resistance 20 to physical ranged attacks, such as arrows, bolts, javelins, and thrown rocks, as such attacks are magically diverted through its collar of fire. Non-magical weapons and ammunition affected by this ability are incinerated and destroyed.</p> 
                  <p><b>Counterspelling Wall</b> [reaction] (evocation, fire, primal) <b>Trigger</b> A creature within 100 feet of the maliadi that the maliadi can see Casts a Spell that targets the maliadi; <b>Effect</b> The maliadi casts one of its innate <em>wall of fire</em> spells, with a duration of 1 round. If the spell that triggered this reaction passes through the wall of fire, the wall attempts to counteract it, with a counteract modifier of +28.</p> 
                  <p><b>Speed</b> 30 feet, swim 20 feet; <em>freedom of movement</em></p>

                  <p><b>Capsize</b> [one-action] The maliadi tries to capsize an adjacent aquatic vessel of its size or smaller. The maliadi must succeed at a DC 35 Athletics check (reduced by 5 for each size smaller the vessel is than the maliadi) or the pilot’s Sailing Lore DC, whichever is higher.</p> 
                  <p><b>Change Shape</b> [one-action] The maliadi can take on the appearance of any Large, Huge, or Gargantuan animal. This doesn’t change its Speed or Strikes.</p> 
                  <p><b>River Form</b> [three-actions] The maliadi takes on the form of a stretch of river, with the effects of <em>wind walk</em>, except the maliadi can only affect itself, appears as a section of a flowing river that takes up the same space as the maliadi, and can’t leave the ground.</p> 
                  <p><b>Swallow Whole</b> [one-action] Huge, 3d10+17 bludgeoning, Rupture 35</p>

                  <h2>Title Changes</h2> 
                  <p>We’ve been shuffling around some job titles and responsibilities on the Organized Play development team over the last few weeks to account for the transfer of the Pathfinder and Starfinder One-Shots product lines to this team. To reflect this shift, we’re going to start calling the team the “Digital Adventures Team,” rather than a title more closely associated with our OP programs, as their creative remit now covers items that aren’t directly related to our Organized Play campaigns. (They'll still handle those products as well, just alongside these new items on their docket.)</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Linda Zayas-Palmer is now the Development Manager (Digital Adventures) and manages the Digital Adventures Team, of which the “Organized Play Team” is a subset.</li> 
                   <li>Thurston Hillman is now titled Developer (Digital Adventures), and will be focusing on Paizo’s One-Shots, Bounties, and Society Interactives.</li> 
                   <li>Jenny Jarzabski is the Starfinder Society Developer, and Mike Kimmel is the Pathfinder Society Developer, though both share the official title of Organized Play Line Developer. Jenny and Mike are running the day-to-day development of Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society, respectively.</li> 
                  </ul> 
                  <p>Most of this is just bringing job titles in line with the developers’ day-to-day duties, but we wanted to announce them in case anybody noticed the changes in the masthead of new scenarios.</p> 
                  <h2>Starfinder Society Year 4</h2> 
                  <p>We’ve got a couple points of clarification with information we’ve released about Starfinder Society Year 4. In addition, we wanted to post an update that we’re currently working on compiling the common questions about the shift away from Fame and will have answers to some of the outstanding issues and boons prior to the Fame spending deadline. </p> 
                  <h4><em>Table Size</em></h4> 
                  <p>It was brought to our attention that there was an additional rule change with Year 4 of Starfinder Society that didn’t get the spotlight it should’ve. As of the beginning of Year 4, <a href="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Player-Basics#Legal_Table_Size">the maximum player count for a table is <b>six players</b></a>. Seven-player tables are no longer permitted. We didn’t intend to sneak this change by anybody, we just forgot to announce it with the rest of the changes! </p> 
                  <h4><em>New Ships</em></h4> We have one final piece of business to attend to with our new year of Starfinder Society, and that’s the Azata! This brand new ship is available to all players, and its statistics are now available <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Starships">in the Starfinder Society Guide</a>.

                  <h2>Pathfinder Society Year 3</h2> 
                  <p>Last month, we announced the title for Pathfinder Society <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpa">Year 3: the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a>. We’re excited for you all to experience this new storyline; from what I’ve read so far, it’ll be a great year for veteran and brand-new players alike. One of the highlights for new players is the three-part introduction arc we talked about in the Paizo Intro Blog last Thursday. Mike Kimmel did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOOklXtBOsw">an interview with the Danger Club Podcast</a>—go check it out for some more teasers, and stay tuned to the blog for more news!</p> 
                  <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                  <p>The big headline for this month’s sanctioning update is for our First Edition players! We’re pleased to announce that updated versions of the PFS (first edition) <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/additional">Additional Resources</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/clarifications">Campaign Clarifications</a> have been released and take effect immediately. We anticipate that this will be the final version of these documents, barring any major issues. We’re still working on sanctioning documents for the final Adventure Paths, but their rules options are all factored into this update. </p> 
                  <p>I don’t have as much to report for our active programs this month. For Pathfinder Society, sanctioning documents for the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix"><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em> Adventure Path</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024xn"><em>Malevolence</em></a> are both ready to go live when the books are released on July 7th. Next on the list for PFS is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em></a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands</em> Adventure Path</a>. For Starfinder Society, I’m pleased to announce that the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a> has been updated to include the options in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zu?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Galaxy Exploration Manual</a>. We weren’t able to get Fly Free or Die or Devastation Ark’s character options out this month, but we’re working on those as our next priority.</p> 
                  <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                  <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                  <p>This month, we have several GMs to recognize!</p> 
                  <p><b>5th Star</b>: Filipp Kovalev, Lindsey Long<br> <b>5th Nova</b>: Michael Beck, James Carter, Rebecca Fehn</p> 
                  <p>Congratulations to our GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>

                  <p>First of all, why are you out here in the streets? Is it not time for your lessons? Taking after me, now, are we? Never mind!</p> 
                  <p>Don’t cover your ears, sister. The aftermath of a revolution is a wonderfully loud thing. Look! That was Prince Haliad’s statue crashing to the ground. I think I see Bapa with those farmers dragging its ugly stone head to that catapult we stole. I hope they fling it at that stubborn pirate schooner that hasn’t taken the hint to leave port. There’s no way Anthusis will let them land on its shores.</p>

                  <br> 
                  <p>What are you doing out here alone? Don’t get me wrong—I’m excited to see you amidst all this! Seeing that old statue fall in front of the embassy is a splendid reason to skip your studies. This is history in the making, sister! Let it fill your senses; a book won’t give you the same gift as these liberated streets. But how did you slip past Mielle? I know she’s gotten older, but with each year her senses have only sharpened—the old panther. Tell me how you escaped, and don’t say you learned it from me! I could never slip her gaze, and I’ve the welts to prove it.</p> 
                  <p>Do you like my outfit? In truth it’s a bit Chelish for my taste, but it moves much better than what I left home with. When I have time, I’ll make use of Mielle’s needlepoint lessons and fashion something more reminiscent of home. </p> 
                  <p>I don’t look like a Free Captain’s cohort, Jiella! Only a Firebrand would wear colors this loud, and this city could take more than a few cues from our fashion sense! I’d bet Bapa’s skiff that you’ve never even seen those privateers up close. I’ve had to cut through two of them in the past month.</p> 
                  <p>Where did I get the sword? Promise you won’t tell—else I’ll never be able to come home! It belonged to Mama. I don’t know why she had it; all those diplomacies to nowhere she conducted in our living room could have been cut much shorter with this. It felt heavy at first, but after a couple months fighting on these shackled seas, my arm feels incomplete without it. That stain on my sleeve? It’s just a bit of wine. I may need a wash it—don’t give me that look, Jie!</p> 
                  <p>Were Mama and Bapa home when you slipped out? There are some articles I’ve meant to procure from my room now that things have started to settle. </p> 
                  <p>Mielle has been preparing full meals every night since the Hurricane Queen faffed off to the other side of Desperation Bay? I’ll have to stop home and grab a bottle of her kremas to share with my ship. It’s requisite for a Firebrand to know how to share—and the old panther owes me more than one drink for her rigor. Let’s get you home so I can collect my libationary toll.</p> 
                  <p>You wear these clothes much better than I did. Most outfits suit me better after they’ve been thoroughly sea-bitten. I see that you’ve been eating well—as Mama and Bapa told you to, no doubt. I assume they give my share to you now that I’ve been gone a season. It seems like you’ve grown a half-foot! I bet you’ll be taller than me by year’s end. </p> 
                  <p>I don’t mean to make them worry, you know. I just never fit what they needed. It’s embarrassing how much better you are with words than I was at your age. I think they can see that you fit them better, too. I hope they miss me. I miss them. I’ve been thinking of them a lot—and you, of course. I see you snuck out of your window to see what the crash was! You’re more like me than I thought. I’m a bad influence on you, Jiella! Let me boost you back up. I’ll be right behind you. Once we’re inside, give me for a moment to track down Mielle’s kremas stock—if she’s made multiple batches, she won’t be too upset if one of them goes missing.</p> 
                  <p>May I fashion your hair like we used to do together? I’ve been working on a new style for the times; twelve braids fashioned like a crown: one for each month from now to keep Vidrian autonomous. If Mama asks who did your hair, just deflect with that. I’m sure she’ll appreciate the idea. I have a message for her and Bapa, too. They can’t trust the ‘Independent’ Banks of Vidrian, even if they can trust Mandla Dube. Please pass this onto them and say it came from the Vane—they’ll take it more seriously than from me.</p> 
                  <p>I must go now, sister, but take this turquoise comb for your new crown. With it, you’ll look almost as dashing as me! In a few years, Mama and Bapa will want you with them in the Vidric Council—and you should join them when that time comes. Don’t forget about the streets, though! Look around, there’s so much to rebuild and replace. New homes to be made, new stores to spread the wealth, new dishes to define the taste of Vidrian as its own. No idols are going to show our nation the way forward, whether they’re deities or nobles, but our community can figure it out together. When the council dissolves into noise, go somewhere else to cut through it. Don’t fight, but be like a sword. Leave the sharp stuff to me as you rebuild this place. I’ll be in step with you—but first, I’m off to Smuggler’s Shiv to procure a donation to our new nation. Crying isn’t going to keep me from leaving! I’ll be back again before you know it. And not as one of that isle’s specters.</p> 
                  <p>I love you, Jiella—Mama and Bapa, too. They’ll approve of my course in due time—and they’ll let you set yours. For now, you should listen to them. Eventually, they’ll see how much the future needs my blade and your words.<br> So don’t cry too long. I’m not dead yet. </p>

                  <p>Also this month, the spotlight returns to an old frenemy of the Society. When socialite Envar Tamm goes missing, corporate powerhouse Ilia Tamm wants to hire a team of Starfinders to help in the investigation. Radaszam sees this as an opportunity to settle the organization’s accounts with the wealthy family once and for all, so he recruits the PCs to travel to a distant planet in search of Envar.

                  <p>Our first Pathfinder scenario for June takes us deep into the deserts of Thuvia. The Pathfinder Society recently learned that vile cultists have been searching for ancient keys to a ruined site buried in the sands. Knowing that the cultists are close to bringing their evil plans to fruition, the Society sends a team to confront them and learn what lies within the ruins. What mysteries lie beyond the dunes?

                  <p>The next June scenario is the penultimate adventure in the exciting metaplot for the Year of Corruption’s Reach! The Pathfinders are going to need all the help they can get to thwart a fiendish plan that is millennia in the making. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027p8?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-222-Breaking-the-Storm-Excising-Ruination">Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-22: Breaking the Storm: Excising Ruination</a> is the first 2nd Edition Pathfinder Society scenario for levels 7–10. It also ties into the goals of the Vigilant Seal faction and is written by Nicholas Wasko.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">June is Pride Month, a time for the LGBTQ+ community to celebrate their lives, their struggles, and their identities. It’s also a time to remind ourselves and those around us that the fight for equality is not over. The first Pride celebrations were inspired by the Stonewall riots, a six-day riot against police brutality, led by community leaders including Marsha P. Johnson, a Black trans woman.</p> 
                  <p>Pride is important because LGBTQ+ individuals do not have equality in <em>any</em> country. The <a href="http://internap.hrw.org/features/features/lgbt_laws/">Human Rights Watch</a> reports that 69 countries have national laws criminalizing same-sex relations between consenting adults. At least nine countries have laws criminalizing “forms of gender expression that target transgender and gender nonconforming people,” and many more countries don’t need to pass laws to ensure their police forces and militaries do the work of suppressing LGBTQ+ lives. Worldwide, gay, trans and non-conforming individuals face legal and illegal discrimination, abuse, and hatred. There are places in this world I will not travel with my fiancé because I am worried we will face physical and verbal abuse, and some of those places are within driving distance of where I live. Here in America, my rights are debated on a daily basis in local, state and federal court. </p> 
                  <p>My fellow contributors to this blog and I are <em>lucky</em> that many of us live in a country that will not arrest us, directly, in most places, for our sexuality or gender. We are <em>lucky</em> that Paizo is a company that does not discourage us from expressing ourselves in our personal lives, and that permits us to create beautiful and diverse worlds that represent the world as we would like to see it. But we are <em>lucky</em>, and every gamer knows that sometimes the dice run hot, and sometimes you roll a 1. None of that is guaranteed to us, and it could be taken away in moments - or slowly, over four years.</p> 
                  <hr width="50%"> 
                  <p>I started with the depressing stuff not because I wanted to, but because I didn’t want it to get lost. But that’s not all of what Pride is. Pride is also about joy in who we are, and in our community. It’s about gathering and celebrating our lives, the freedoms we have fought to achieve, and to remind ourselves that it is all worth it.</p> 
                  <p>For this year’s Pride blog, I asked our staffers and contributors to tell us about something they’re proud of from the past year. I told them that it didn’t have to be gaming related; that, in fact, this was a chance to use the platform we’re lucky to have to shout out the things that don’t get attention. I’d like to thank them all for sharing themselves with me and with the Paizo community. </p>

                  <h3>Alexander Augunas, Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                  <p>I'm Alexander Augunas! I'm the Know Direction Network's Everyman Gamer, publisher of Everybody Games, and a freelancer for Paizo Inc. This past year has been a crazy year for us all, but I like to think that I did some good work during the chaos and confusion of the global shutdown. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023gd?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Legends"><em>Lost Omens: Legends</em></a>, I presented Golarion's most powerful sorceress, Hao Jin (set to appear in the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix"><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path</em></a>) as an asexual woman whose experiences with asexuality I personally identify with, a prospect that I felt was one of the most deeply empowering and important RPG articles I have ever written. Second only, perhaps, to <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2020/07/guidance-the-rot-in-rpg-on-race-and-racism-in-tabletop-rpgs/">The Rot in RPGs</a>, a blog article I did for the Know Direction Network where I analyzed how systemic racism has impacted tabletop RPGs and offered some suggestions on what we as a community should do to combat it. It's a deeply researched piece that I wrote in response to the murder of George Floyd, and it's an article I hope inspires gamers to keep doing better as a community for those who are marginalized. Because I truly believe that if we try, we can change. Games have that kind of power, and I firmly believe that as creators we have the responsibility to use our power to better the world we've inherited.</p>

                  <p>The thing I am most proud of this year is somehow finding a better work and life balance over the course of it. I know this time has been hard for so many of us, but what I discovered about myself getting through it is where my healthier boundaries are and how to lay them down more confidently. When my pandemic fatigue set in, I signed up for the Moderna trial. When I had to make big, life-altering changes at home, I found a place where I can still be a part of my incredible 4 year old's life.</p> 
                  <p>I am proud I was able to do all of that on my own terms. Creatively, this has led me down new paths of freelancing. I have a coming project I can't wait to tell people more about—my first ever built and pitched privately with the help of a new friend. I am also planning a return to voice acting. There is a lot to look forward to, but you know what also helped a great deal? My partners of more than one gender who made it a point (in a pandemic!) to be in my company.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/14b28767-9cef-4407-abb4-9373651c4aa9/071620_haojin.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/14b28767-9cef-4407-abb4-9373651c4aa9/071620_haojin.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Tall human female with long flowing red hair wearing a kimono, their left hand casting a spell on the miniature building held in their right hand."></a>

                  <h3>Shay Snow (they/them), Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                  <p>I’m super proud that I’ve pushed myself this year to accept projects that I would normally shy away from. I’ve spent a long time turning things down because of a deep fear of being under qualified or just the belief that I wouldn’t be good enough when compared to other people who came before me. This year has been a rollercoaster ride, but I can look back at it and actively point out my victories and places where I’ve excelled and grown as a person. My partner, my friends, and I have watched me break out of my comfort zone and restore my self-confidence in not just my writing and editing skills, but also in myself and my ability to handle large projects. I look forward to another year of accepting things and showing not just other people, but showing <em>myself</em> that I can handle anything thrown my way.</p>

                  <h3>James Jacobs, Pathfinder Creative Director</h3> 
                  <p>Writing adventures about ghosts and cultists and things that go bump in the night has long been something I’ve enjoyed, but with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence"><em>Malevolence</em></a>, an adventure I ran for several folks here at the office last year before writing it up as a standalone adventure for Pathfinder, I finally got to create that haunted house adventure I’ve been eager to write. Several of the spooky, creepy events and encounters that I inflicted on my players made it into the adventure, along with a few that I had planned but they never reached and a few more that I made up specifically for the adventure. The in-depth mechanics for how players can unravel the manor’s mystery by researching, investigating, and interpreting haunted dreams is one of my favorite parts of the adventure, and I can’t mention the other favorite part without spoiling something big. Still, it’s exciting to get <em>Malevolence</em> out into the world after it spent a few extra months in shipping delay hell, and I hope it does as good a job providing your group with a bit of escape from the horrors of the past year as it did for me to write it.</p>

I hope that this next year can be just as great and even more productive!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/671e59b1-ed03-42ff-94fb-cfcfe7500fa9/062421_Dr Monslkis.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/671e59b1-ed03-42ff-94fb-cfcfe7500fa9/062421_Dr Monslkis.png" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A female verthani wearing glasses with her brown hair pulled into a bun and adorned with cybernetic augmentations.

                  <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her), Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                  <p>Hey, all! I'm bi and demisexual, and I've been freelancing for Paizo for a few years. It's been a tough year, globally speaking, but I hit a few personal milestones that I'm proud of, the release of my first AP volume (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jk?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-37-The-White-Glove-Affair"><em>The White Glove Affair</em></a>) being one of them. What I'm focusing on here, though, is a little more mundane: I've been talking to people.</p> 
                  <p>I'm not a very outgoing person, which has always made networking intimidating to me. I'd talked to people off and on at PaizoCon, but until recently, I hadn't really gotten to know anyone in the freelancing community too well. With the con's shift to being online, though, I was more comfortable casually chatting. After that, staying in touch with other freelancers seemed to flow naturally, and before I knew it, I was in a community of talented writers and fun people, some of whom I now count as friends as well as colleagues. I look forward to meeting them once in-person cons are safe again! And...well, maybe you'll see me hanging out at the hotel bar next PaizoCon. I promise not to flee if you come say hi. :-)</p>

                  <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her), Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                  <p>Hi there, I’m a Paizo freelancer and am proudly BIPOC, queer, and transgender! I do other things as well, including professional GMing and voice acting. Without a doubt, my proudest accomplishment this past year was nailing my first freelancing assignment with Paizo. It’s no secret that the book in question is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a>, and while I can’t spoil any of its content, I think I can share that in the end I was able to write something deeply personal that I hope will resonate just as powerfully with other people who share similar experiences. In fact, I’m definitely going to be talking about it on Twitter once the book is released, so if that sounds interesting then you can follow me there at @MistressDanaRPG. Until next time, endless love and support for each and every one of you who help to make our community a more inclusive, diverse, and welcoming place!</p> 
                  <br> 
                  <h3>Dustin Knight (he/him), Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                  <p>The word I've used to describe this last year has been <em>surreal</em>. I'd repeat again and again: <em>survive, not thrive</em>. And yet, I struggled every day to do something I could be proud of, even if it meant fighting to convince myself that I deserved to rest. But even as I write this, I find myself pondering what it means to feel <em>pride</em>. It's tempting to drop names and links in some hackneyed attempt to avoid today's undertaking, but it's one I've avoided for too many years. Today I'm proud to publicly identify as asexual.</p> 
                  <p>And yet, I can't help but feel like I'm still avoiding the prompt. So I've got to admit what I'm most proud of this surreal year has been my career. I've passed so many milestones it's hard to believe any of this is real. Most surreal of all was having aced the Paizo design test last fall. Proving myself in that capacity and then getting my first hardcover book assignment has been a validating experience unlike any other. So many friends have helped me on this journey, and this year I hope I've made them proud. Thank you, my dear friends. And thank you, Paizo.</p> <!--<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com"><img width=300 src="https://cdn.paizo.com" hspace="5" alt=""></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>-->

                 <blockquote> 
                  <p itemprop="description">The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</a> offers a robust, yet simple system for generating entire science fantasy worlds on the fly, including populating them with creatures, adventures, and more. So let’s make ourselves a world, starting with nothing but our trusty dice and the two-page Building Worlds article in the Galaxy Exploration Manual.</p> 
                  <p>For our first step, we’ll see what <b>type of world</b> we’re generating: is it a gas giant, an asteroid—even a colony ship? We roll 42 on our d% table and get… a terrestrial world, which is one that’s naturally habitable and has one or more biomes (coming in step 3). Not a bad place to start for most worlds, though we could always just choose something weirder if we wanted it.</p> 
                  <p>Next, we’ll see what kind of <b>gravity and atmosphere</b> this world has by rolling d% twice more. Results of 42 and 84 give us standard gravity and a thick atmosphere, respectively. Handy page references guide us to the parts of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> that’ll tell us more about thick atmospheres.</p> 
                  <p>Next comes a key step: identifying our world’s <b>biomes</b>! What kinds of environments are present on this world? Do the creatures and cultures reside entirely in the air? In rugged mountains or soggy marshes? Let’s roll a d12 on the biomes table and find out! Our first roll is a 2, which gives us the aquatic biome. We could stop there and have a water world, but let’s roll a couple more times and see what else we get. Two more rolls (a 5 and a 10) add forest and subterranean biomes to the mix. </p> 
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3438994f-8f82-499f-8e15-915879670d85/062321_AQUATICBIOME.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3438994f-8f82-499f-8e15-915879670d85/062321_AQUATICBIOME.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="The iconic shirren mystic is underwater in a submersible, examining a small alien fish, while a giant creature with a gaping maw looms behind him.]"></a>

                  <br> 
                  <p>We’ll return to the biomes for more inspiration in a moment, but let’s fill in our world’s <b>cultural attributes</b> first. We roll a d6 six times and get a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (what are the odds?!). This tells us, respectively, that the world has low accord (meaning folks don’t much get along), a chaotic neutral alignment, medium magic, high religion, and high technology. </p> 
                  <p>With that, we’re done generating the basics of our random world! But wait—there’s more! The next 80 pages of this book offer tons of flavor, adventure hooks, inhabitants, and player options tied to the biomes and cultural attributes we just generated. For now, let’s just use our aquatic biome and high technology attribute to get some more details about this place, shall we?</p> 
                  <p>Turning to the aquatic biome, we find an inhabitants table, which has both sentient species (those likely to have cultures and settlements) and threats (those likely to attempt to eat or rearrange our faces). We roll d% a couple times for inhabitants, getting 42 and 84, and find that our sentient creatures are lacedon ghouls (chaotic evil aquatic undead) and stelliferas (diminutive cuttlefish-like creatures adapted to the deep sea)—no wonder they don’t get along! For our threat creatures, we roll again and get glass serpents and aquatic jubsnuths (bulbous predators with two mouths).</p> 
                  <p>Our aquatic biome also has a wealth of adventure hooks, but let’s turn to the technology section and roll something from its adventure-hook tables instead! Rolling a 14 on the high-technology table gives us “a dangerous nanite malfunction threatens an entire world.” Uh oh! Did the nanites originate from the experiments of one of our aquatic species, or are perhaps some of our forest or subterranean dwellers to blame? Is our world’s atmosphere thick because it’s choked with nanites, or were the tiny robots originally made to clear the air? And what else is happening on this world? We could turn to any of our biomes or cultural attributes to get still more inspiration and adventure, but for the purposes of this blog, we’ll leave these mysteries to be solved.</p> 
                  <p>Also, if we want to fill in details about settlements, NPCs, or the like, there are a number of <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpq?A-Galaxy-Of-Toolboxes">toolboxes</a> that will serve us well in chapter 3 of this very book!</p> 
                  <p>Leave a comment if this world inspired any ideas of your own. And if you’ve already used the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Galaxy Exploration Manual</a> to create your own worlds, tell us about them!</p>

Each cabalist binds with an animus like pyre, storms, portents, or wisdom, and this mystical communion shapes their eldritch power, sometimes even changing their casting tradition, with animus blessings and bonus spells, familiar adaptations, and taboos!</p>

                  <p>Every battle take place somewhere, thus every battle features terrain. Sometimes all you need is a place to stand, maybe some trees or ruins to provide cover, but sometimes you want more. You want your terrain to have a major impact on the story or the heroes' tactics. You want the the Fire Swamp or the Bridge of Khazad Dum. That's what Terrain Toolbox is for.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">With the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual"><em>Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> comes a bevy of <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpm?A-Galaxy-Of-Character-Options">player options</a>, but there’s plenty more value packed into this tome. While you’ll want to keep an eye out for an upcoming blog that details the world-building system, today we’re looking at the multitude of toolboxes and tables provided in the Galaxy Exploration Manual!</p> 
                  <p>While some of these tools will be useful to players building their characters’ backstories, GMs will find them invaluable in running open-ended adventures. So, let’s put ourselves in a Starfinder GM’s shoes and see what we can get out of GEM</p> 
                  <p>Let’s suppose our party has used the exploration system in the book’s first chapter to identify a new system and decides to travel through the Drift to find it. Our first stop as GM can be the <b>Drift Encounters Toolbox</b>, where we have a d% table with 50 options for encounters in the Drift, ranging between combat and exploration. We roll a 42 and get “A time dragon travels the Drift, ensuring any temporal differences of active planar bubbles are not being abused.” Depending on our party’s makeup, their actions, and their goals, this usually neutral dragon might be a help, a hindrance, the quest giver of a new side quest—or merely another interesting but brief sighting on a journey through the Drift.</p> 
                  <p>Our players might also encounter another ship in the Drift, so let’s turn to the <b>Starship Toolbox</b> and roll up a random name and a quirk! We roll 42 for the first word of the ship name (Infinite) and a 42 for the second word (Hope), as well as a 13 for the starship quirks table, which tells us that “the ship is a replica of a fictional ship from a popular holovid.” Again, we can make as much or as little of this as we and our party is interested in. We could instead roll on the legendary starships table to have a brush with a famous (or infamous) starship from the Starfinder setting.</p> 
                  <div class="blurbCenter">

                  </div> 
                  <br> 
                  <p>Our next stop is a new world the party is exploring! Again, a future blog will cover the world-building system, which includes fleshing out a world’s physical and cultural characteristics and it inhabitants, but for now, let’s use the <b>Settlement Toolbox</b> to inspire us for the first settlement our PCs visit! Rolling on the settlement quirks table, we get 42: Many inhabitants claim to be descended from a lost line of an important family that originates from this world or another. We then roll 42 on the settlement challenges table and learn that the settlement’s inhabitants enjoy a form of entertainment that surreptitiously carries a supernatural form of illness. We also have a table of locations for when the PCs want to wander around, do some investigating (or window shopping). Rolling 42, we get the local transport dealer, where people can purchase or repair ground-based transportation (the details of which will vary wildly depending on our world’s tech level, biomes, and so forth).</p> 
                  <p>Of course, there are people populating this settlement, and our PCs are bound to want to harangue—I mean, meet—some of them, so let’s turn to the <b>NPC Toolbox</b> and see who their first victim—I mean, new friend—is! Perhaps they’re the transport dealer we just met. We roll twice on the name and species table (two 42s) and get Lajai, an ikeshti. Of course, to bring the character alive, we’ll want a personality quirk, so let’s roll on that d% table. We get a 42, so now we know that Lajai hates their day job and dreams of becoming a vid star.</p> 
                  <p>Finally, we’d be remiss to overlook the <b>Treasure Toolbox</b>, full of story-rich treasure that can be far more interesting than another credstick or hunk of starmetal. Perhaps Lajai knows of one of these treasures and offers to split the profits if the PCs can recover it (finally allowing Lajai to pursue their vid-star dreams!) We roll 13 on the table for treasures worth 5,000 credits (there are tables for multiple values) and get a computerized music box that algorithmically generates new songs based on what other music it has overheard. </p> 
                  <p>Of course, if we want to reroll any of these results, or even just handpick them, we’re free to (and we might want to get our d% dice checked out, anyway…). These toolboxes provide inspiration for countless adventures throughout the galaxy! </p> 
                  <p>We’ll see you next time, when we build a world from scratch with just a few rolls.</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">Juneteenth, or Emancipation Day, celebrates June 19, 1865, the day when the last slaves in the United States were finally informed they were free. The road from the first Juneteenth to today wasn’t smooth or easy. Last year, I wrote a blog about the history of Juneteenth, which you can find <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh9k?Happy-Juneteenth">here</a>, but this year, I wanted to talk a bit about what we can do on Juneteenth now, in the present day, and in the future.</p> 
                  <p>So, how can we celebrate Juneteenth? How do we commemorate a day fraught with so much pain and suffering? One of the best ways we can celebrate Emancipation Day is by educating ourselves about the history of our country that we didn't learn about in school. The contributions of Black people to every aspect of our nation, be it socially, culturally, philosophically, or technologically, are tremendous. Thankfully, there are lot of resources out there! Annually, <a href="https://www.juneteenthny.com/" target="_blank">New York hosts a 3-day Juneteenth summit</a> with talent shows, health and wellness screenings, educational activities and more. This year, like last year, the summit is online, making it accessible regardless of location. Likewise, this year, the <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/" target="_blank">Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture</a> presents programming that highlights both the history of the holiday and stories of the people who lived it. </p> 
                  <p>Another way we can celebrate the holiday is by going out and supporting Black businesses. Buy a gift from a marginalized creator. Eat at a Black-owned restaurant. Many organizations maintain lists of local businesses owned by Black proprietors—here in Seattle, we have the Seattle Good Business Network, so check to see if a similar resource exists for your area! On a larger scale, the US Chamber of Commerce wrote an article featuring 8 rosters of Black businesses.</p> 
                  <p>Our own industry, tabletop RPGs, has its own history of erased Black innovators, creators, and personalities. We can help reform the industry by learning about Black people in the industry and the ways they influence and shape not just the games we love, but the communities we participate in. There are a number of games and settings being made by Black creators right now. Look at them, learn about them, talk about them with your friends, engage with them, and if you're making them, keep making them! One I've been following recently is <a href="https://motherlandsrpg.com/" target="_blank">Into the Motherlands</a>.</p>

                  <p>Last week, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/juneteenth-congress-federal-holiday-3cc3b7a56ec97b0bae3dbdff1da092ee">Congress moved to make Juneteenth a national holiday</a>, something it should have been since 1865. At this point, it needs President Biden’s signature, and it is likely that in the next few days this will occur (Update: it did! Juneteenth is now a national holiday!). That’s an important thing, but it is also important to remember that we have to go beyond just performance. Our country still struggles with not just the legacy of slavery, but ongoing slavery and systemic racism in the form of our prison and economic systems. Commemorating one of the most important days in our nation’s history with a national holiday is a valuable first step in moving forward, be we can’t let it be a symbol of the defeat of racism, or let it convince us that the injustices, the horrors, inflicted on the Black community are behind us, because neither of those things are true. When the holiday is past, we should keep doing the things we did during it: keep pushing for change, keep demanding justice, keep supporting Black businesses, and keep learning.</p>

                  <h3>Wendlyn, Incorrigible Thief</h3> 
                  <p>Wendlyn grew up in Otari and knows just about everyone in it. This means she knows which people are safe to target with her petty larceny. She’s been on the wrong side of Captain Longsaddle of the Otari town guard for as long as she can remember, but she keeps away from the sorts of crimes that would call for serious punishment, or that would seriously hurt anyone. The people of Otari are immune to her thefts but not her pranks; she’s fond of hiding animals where they’ll surprise people or livening up a celebration with some unexpected fireworks. She considers it to be all in good fun. Captain Longsaddle would definitely disagree, as would her younger half-sister, the pious acolyte <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk1?NoPrep-Character-Lisavet">Lisavet</a>.</p> 
                  <p>Wendlyn is an excellent person to become acquainted with in Otari, as she knows a fair share of the town’s secrets. Her lifelong inclination toward theft also makes her just the right person to disable a tricky lock or disarm a complicated trap. She’s eager to join just about any escapade, illicit or otherwise, as long as no one seems likely to get seriously hurt.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/4c4c5976-5cec-4b8f-a68c-bbafe0081683/061821_WENDLYN.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/4c4c5976-5cec-4b8f-a68c-bbafe0081683/061821_WENDLYN.png" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="a lithe half-elf woman wears dark leather armor and wields a short sword"></a>

                  <p><b>Sneak Attack</b> Wendlyn deals an extra 1d6 precision damage to flat-footed creatures</p> 
                  <p><b>Surprise Attack</b> On the first round of combat, if Wendlyn rolls Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven’t acted yet are flat-footed to her.</p> 
                  <p><b>Plot Hooks</b></p> 
                  <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Wendlyn into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Wendlyn needs the heroes to help her recover a hand mirror she stole from an abandoned house and then fenced, as she didn’t realize its presence was keeping a ghost confined to the old house. She hopes to recover the mirror from the fence and get it back into the house before anyone’s hurt.</li> 
                   <li>One of the heroes is an alibi who can prove Wendlyn wasn’t at the scene of a crime that Captain Longsaddle is certain she committed. The heroes must work to prove the thief’s innocence—in this particular matter, at least.</li> 
                   <li>The heroes have come across a strange puzzle box that defies all attempts to open it, but an expert locksmith like Wendlyn might be able to help.</li> 
                   <li>Through her shady contacts, Wendlyn has heard of a plot to smuggle drugs into Otari’s harbor late at night. She hopes to intercept the smugglers, dump the drugs into the harbor’s waters, and teach the smugglers to stay out of her town.</li> 
                  </ul>

                  <p itemprop="description">The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual"><em>Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> has released, opening up not just brave new frontiers of exploration, but also unleashing a wealth of new character options to enable your PCs’ space-traveling hijinks!

Let’s take a look!</p> 
                  <h4>Surviving the Great, Itchy Outdoors</h4> 
                  <p>Your armor’s environmental protections might shield you from the worst temperature fluctuations and breathability issues, yet wilderness adventures are rife with other threats and nuisances. This rain is messing up my ranged attacks. Is that plant poisonous, venomous, carnivorous, or all of the above? How are we supposed to survive on this planet with high gravity and constant lightning strikes? Also, gah, how did swamp water get into my powered armor?!</p> 
                  <p>Fortunately, we have a wealth of tools for identifying, surviving, and even exploiting environmental hazards. The mechanic packs a new trick called <b>sample scanner</b>, which lets you plug small material samples into your exocortex and have it analyze the material to tell you everything you want to know about that weird rock formation or unfamiliar flora you’re investigating. Ever had your armor’s environmental protections run dry while you’re halfway across a trackless continent? Maybe you want the technomancer’s magic hack <b>extend protections</b>, which can recharge your armor’s batteries using leftover spell slots. As a witchwarper, why not borrow environmental resistances from an alternate version of yourself with the paradigm shift <b>shifting adaptation</b>? Or laugh off any hazard with the soldier’s <b>rover fighting style</b>, which helps you shrug off discomfort while clambering over just about anything the galaxy throws at you.</p> 
                  <p>Does that sound too rugged and confident? Would you rather play the shaky character who’s entirely unhappy about being cold, wet, unconnected to the infosphere, and convinced that everything is out to eat you? To my delight, the envoy boasts some delightful new improvisations that turn your shouts of “Aah, what’s that? AAAAH, what’s <em>THAT?!</em>” into powerful tools. Convince animals and vermin to leave, thank you very much, with the <b>shoo!</b> improvisation. Or signal that something is strange and very wrong with <b>early warning</b>. You can even redirect your companions’ readied action triggers, changing these to react to a strange new threat with <b>changing circumstances</b>.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/eb007e51-30cc-408c-a9ec-3be466952366/061721_MACHETESOLDIER.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/eb007e51-30cc-408c-a9ec-3be466952366/061721_MACHETESOLDIER.png" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="An armored ysoki soldier wielding a machete"></a>

                  <h4>Getting From Here to There</h4> 
                  <p>Alright, we’re alive. Fantastic! Now we just need to get to that exploring part. So how exactly are we going to navigate this alien wilderness again?</p> 
                  <p>Look no further than a host of new options dedicated to finding paths through difficult conditions. How about your mystic, whose <b>trailblazer connection</b> allows you to bond with environments, helping you sense the safest trails through deadly areas? Stuck in mud, pinned by a hungry ksarik, spinning helplessly in zero-g, or gazing forlornly at a ravine you can’t jump? That sounds like the perfect time for your witchwarper to teleport to safety with the <b>dimensional extraction</b> paradigm shift. If piloting a vehicle for hours on end sounds tedious, maybe it’s time you snagged that <b>artificial pilot</b> mechanic trick, which turns your drone into a capable driver. Or when the GM throws hazards in your way, just shout no…by activating new vanguard disciplines like <b>blaze a trail</b> (which lets you disintegrate difficult terrain as you move through it) or <b>Blast Through</b> (which lets you break huge obstacles with remarkable ease).</p> 
                  <br clear="all"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/d21632c7-5084-418d-96a8-f4a76ff64ed4/061721_TRAILBLAZINGVANGUARD.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/d21632c7-5084-418d-96a8-f4a76ff64ed4/061721_TRAILBLAZINGVANGUARD.png" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A human vanguard bursting through vines with her shield"></a>

                  <h4>We Jump Together!</h4> 
                  <p>One of my favorite components of wilderness encounters is varying elevation, and the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> provides tons of ways for you to navigate, exploit, and just outright enjoy altitude differences.</p> 
                  <p>Need a boost? The biohacker can learn <b>locomotive adaptation</b> and its advanced version as theorems, granting allies climb or swim speeds to navigate difficult obstacles. Once you’re up high, your operative might want the <b>high-ground sniper</b> exploit, which gives your sniper weapons an extra punch when you strike from above—and let’s not forget that wildernesses often involve longer encounter distances, which can make snipers really shine!</p> 
                  <p>But perhaps my favorite abilities are the ones that embrace the inevitable: that PCs eventually need to descend quickly to escape trouble or join a melee. Why not do it in style? That biohacker can also learn the theorem <b>cushion the blow</b>, which lets you buffer a companion against falling damage (or even against incoming bludgeoning attacks). Or just embrace the falling damage with the solarian revelation <b>heavy landing</b>, which transfers that falling damage into your weapon, allowing you to strike someone with impossible force! It’s abilities like these that excite me as I imagine bold character’s shouting “Check this out” before pulling some absurd-yet-effective acrobatics.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9f753588-4217-4c39-9c09-bdb72bcac05e/061721_UrbanBody.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9f753588-4217-4c39-9c09-bdb72bcac05e/061721_UrbanBody.png" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A phentomite free runner leaping over a wall"></a>

                  <h4>A Bonus for Every Biome</h4> 
                  <p>And that’s just a taste of the class-specific options—each biome article includes even more! In <em>alaxy Exploration Manual</em> you’ll also find:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Aerobatic feats for aerial biomes</li> 
                   <li>Underwater weapons for aquatic biomes</li> 
                   <li>Rugged armor for arctic biomes</li> 
                   <li>Tough vehicles for traveling desert biomes</li> 
                   <li>New creature companions for forest and weird biomes</li> 
                   <li>Feats for blending into marsh biomes</li> 
                   <li>Earth spells for mastering mountain biomes</li> 
                   <li>Sniper rifles to show off in plains biomes</li> 
                   <li>Biotech augmentations to navigate space biomes</li> 
                   <li>Weapon fusions to defend yourself in subterranean biomes</li> 
                   <li>New feats to navigate and make friends in urban biomes</li> 
                   <li>Plus a ton of new gear for all occasions</li> 
                  </ul> 
                  <p>So check out the Galaxy Exploration Manual, and open up infinite possibilities for your characters!</p>

                  <p>As many of you have already heard, Paizo has elected not to attend Gen Con 2021 in person, though we’ve got lots of fun planned for Gen Con Online 2021.</p> 
                  <p>The Gen Con Organizing Committee is dedicated to ensuring a smooth execution of online events and a large selection of scenarios and systems. We are proud to debut the two new multi-table interactive specials for Starfinder and Pathfinder Second Edition. While we aren’t at liberty to provide you with a ton of information about these two scenarios, we can confidently say you won’t want to miss them, and you should definitely consider playing both! </p> 
                  <p>Online badge registration will open on June 27th, and badges for Gen Con Online are free. You will need to register for a badge to be able to acquire tickets for seats at virtual tables, so make sure you remember to snag your online badge! We will keep you updated with information regarding tickets and event registration as it becomes available. </p>

                  <p>We wish to note Paizo will not be attending this year's PAX Unplugged. We are awaiting news on whether the show will have an online component and will let our community know our plans to provide online programming once we know more. We expect to return to physical conventions in 2022. Thanks, and stay safe!</p>

                  <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s7?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-1-The-Second-Confirmation">Pathfinder Society Intro #1: The Second Confirmation</a>, by our own Thurston Hillman, is an introduction to the Pathfinder Society for 1st- and 2nd-level characters. In this adventure, the Society assigns the characters to a Confirmation, a mission designed as a “final test” for new Pathfinder agents. Their mission? Rescue another initiate who went missing during their own Confirmation! This adventure is repeatable, so it includes several randomized elements and some character choices that allow players to enjoy it multiple times. It should serve as an excellent introductory offering for many events for the foreseeable future.</p> 
                  <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s8?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-2-United-in-Purpose">Pathfinder Society Intro #2: United in Purpose</a>, by veteran adventure author Brian Duckwitz, is intended as the follow-up to Intro #1, and is also for 1st- and 2nd-level characters. Now that they’ve been introduced to the Pathfinder Society as a whole and completed their Confirmation, the characters undertake short missions for each of the Society’s four major factions (Envoy’s Alliance, Grand Archive, Horizon Hunters, and Vigilant Seal). Like Intro #1, this scenario is repeatable and includes randomized elements to keep it fresh and fun. Two upcoming Pathfinder Bounty releases supplement this scenario with missions from the Society’s minor factions (Radiant Oath and Verdant Wheel). These bounties are also repeatable!</p> 
                  <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s9?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-3">Pathfinder Society Intro #3: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a> (also known as PFS #3-01), by Mike Kimmel, is the true introduction to the metaplot of Year 3. A group of Pathfinders at the Grand Lodge is handling a sudden deluge of troubling correspondence from lodges across the Inner Sea region when they learn of an urgent matter in Absalom requiring the Society’s immediate attention. As they tackle this mysterious dilemma, they uncover a disturbing truth—but to learn more, you’ll have to play the adventure, and to thwart the Society’s enemies, you’ll need to stick around for the rest of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries!</p> 
                  <p>This three-part, repeatable Intro arc provides enough experience to bring a brand-new character up to 2nd level while teaching the character (and the player) about the Pathfinder Society’s factions and objectives. Intros #1 and #2 are intended to serve this introductory role for new players for the foreseeable future, while each year’s Intro #3 will be a fresh scenario to introduce all players to the new season’s metaplot. </p> 
                  <p>We hope these scenarios are fun, useful, and instructive. All three scenarios will launch at <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shoh?PaizoCon-Europe-Online-2021-Tickets-GM&amp;fbclid=IwAR0Kwf7_C5NhJO0ERajzTomwzCsmCnmCoyon7D0EZA4Z5u17ZsIe4Xk7-k4">PaizoCon Europe Online 2021</a> (August 19–22), kicking off the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries!</p> 
                  <p>Come back next week for a preview of June’s scenario releases.</p> 
                  <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

                 <blockquote> 
                  <p itemprop="description">“Are you lost, child?”</p> 
                  <p>Hioba stared up at the golden leaves and the large golden trunk of one of Forest Agoyben’s famed Crackling Trees. The voice startled her, and she spun to face it. A small but powerful woman whose face she could not fully see in the shadows leaned against a tree a dozen paces away.</p> 
                  <p>“I’m... uh, no. Actually, I was here to study these trees. You see, I am a student at the Magaambya and—”</p> 
                  <p>“And you thought you’d learn something about these trees that might just explode out of nowhere?”</p> 
                  <p>“Yes.” Hioba again marveled at the tree before her. The trunk had the same luster as actual gold and felt almost metallic when she touched it. She’d heard about it in school, but it seemed impossible to imagine such a hearty tree would simply... break.</p> 
                  <p>The woman nodded. “Knowledge is good, but experience is truth. You know how the trees came to develop their ailment, yes? They taught you that at school?” The woman came closer but still hid most of her features in the forest’s shadows, where the light failed to penetrate fully. Hioba opened her mouth but stopped when the woman raised her hand.</p> 
                  <p>“What they don’t teach you is this: Agohbindi the Splintering Child emerged from under the Vanji River twice as tall as that tree you’ve been staring at for the last hour.” Hioba leaned back, hands on hips, trying to envision the scale of the monster.</p> 
                  <p>“It rose from the river and grasped its way to the sky. It had a beetle’s iridescent carapace but the hungering face and maw of a fiend. Its pincers could crush several blocks of Nantambu’s splendid buildings. It sought a meal and Nantambu was the closest, tastiest dish it was likely to find.</p> 
                  <p>“Rovagug’s murderous progeny crashed through the forest. The Tempest-Sun Mages almost learned of the threat too late. Lucky for them a Magaambya student just like yourself tended to his herbal studies and witnessed the beginning of Agohbindi’s rampage. He sent a message to companions nearer to the city who relayed to the Tempest-Sun Mages what occurred.”</p> 
                  <p>The woman paused. “Are you taking notes, my child? You are receiving quite the education here.” Hioba snatched a quill and her scroll from her pack and started writing. The woman chuckled and continued.</p> 
                  <p>“Fewer than a dozen Tempest-Sun Mages responded, confident in their abilities, just as Azure Leopard had taught them to be. At first their confidence seemed well placed! Their first battle ritual created a storm, pulling the lightning out of the clouds and hurling it at Agohbindi. The gigantic bolt of electricity cleaved the Spawn of Rovagug cleanly in half.</p> 
                  <p>“The mages congratulated each other for the quick victory, but their celebration was cut short, for the two halves of the beast’s foul body instantly formed into two smaller but identical versions of Agohbindi. The mages hurled bolt after bolt from their battle circle. Each bolt split its target in slightly smaller versions of the original spawn until they could get no smaller, at which point they simply continued to multiply.</p> 
                  <div class="blurbCenter">

                  <br> 
                  <p>“The last act that group performed was sending a magical message to Azure Leopard and Old-Mage Jatembe, a plea for help. Then the teeth and magic of a thousand Agohbindis overwhelmed them.”</p> 
                  <p>The woman paused and murmured something that sounded to Hioba like a prayer.</p> 
                  <p>“Azure Leopard and Old-Mage Jatembe answered the call and arrived with nearly one hundred Tempest-Sun Mages. They all thought they were ready for the threat, but they were so incredibly wrong!</p> 
                  <p>“Your books and your teachers will tell you they fought Agohbindi, but what they tell you is insufficient. Yes, they fought, but it wasn’t a mere battle—it was a grueling war. They fought with the Rough Beast’s monstrous child for days on end. The Tempest-Sun Mages fought at first from within the forest, but soon the forest contained as many Agohbindis as the plains hold blades of grass. So the mages took to the sky, harnessing the storm and the wind and the rain to at least slow the advancement of the ceaseless monstrosities. They used fire magic to melt the spawn, but the spawn simply reformed moments later.</p> 
                  <p>“Azure Leopard and Jatembe spent most of their energy coordinating the Tempest-Sun Mages’ defenses, erecting powerful barriers that would take the creatures many hours to penetrate so that the group could search for solutions. Trying to protect the warriors in their care left them precious little time for strategy, but their dedication to protection prevented any other warrior mages from dying. Even then, many suffered severe wounds and none were the same.”</p> 
                  <p>Hioba cleared her throat and looked up from her notes. “When did Jatembe trap Agohbindi? What do you know about that?”</p> 
                  <p>The woman chuckled again.</p> 
                  <p>“By accident! After several days of fighting and containment, the mages ran headlong into that fact we all now know: magic is infinite, but our capacity to wield it... is not. The Tempest-Sun Mages had tapped into their reserves and beyond. As they grew more exhausted, they became sloppy. Old-Mage Jatembe and his pupil found it progressively more taxing to protect the weary mages. In hours, Agohbindi in his multitude would have overwhelmed the amassed mages and moved onward to consume the Song-Wind City... and likely the entirety of Mwangi Expanse!</p> 
                  <p>“Jatembe and Leopard were in the middle of conjuring a barrier of elemental ice for a group of mages retreating from the Agohbindi splinters in the forest. Out of exasperation, over the noise and rage of combat, Azure Leopard shouted to Jatembe: ‘Fighting Agohbindi is not like fighting an opponent, Old-Mage! It is like fighting a tide, like fighting water!’</p> 
                  <p>“Just then, the teacher and pupil paused and looked at each other, each knowing what the other would say next. Child, what do they teach you about water at Magaambya?”</p> 
                  <p>“You... don’t fight it?” Hioba answered nervously.</p> 
                  <p>“Exactly! You don’t fight water. You help it flow, and then you let it flow into a container where you hold it. Leopard and Jatembe had been so busy fighting and defending that they had missed this obvious point. Jatembe let out such a loud and hysterical laugh that everyone who could hear it became anxious for him.</p> 
                  <p>“‘My own teachings, remembered in the last hour, amazing!’ He laughed some more while weaving the spell he knew he needed to cast. People would have been surprised by his humor, except it was Old-Mage Jatembe. He was always a little unpredictable.” The woman shrugged.</p> 
                  <p>“After a moment, Azure Leopard saw her teacher’s intent, and joined in with no prompting. Together their magic augmented the roots of the forest’s trees, which burst free from the soil. The pair sent out magical messages to the Tempest-Sun Mages to direct their energies into these roots. The magic roots stretched out of the soil, wrapping around each of the thousands of Agohbindi shards, holding them in place. Jatembe directed all the other warriors except Azure Leopard into the sky as he prepared the next stage.”</p> 
                  <p>Hioba had stopped writing, absorbed in the mysterious woman’s story.</p> 
                  <p>“Jatembe stretched his arms like a yawn, letting the earth’s energy flow into his body. He inhaled a breath bigger than Balumbdar, building up the energy in his hands and his staff. The other mages worked on a battle ritual to summon the largest bolt of lightning ever seen… before or since.</p> 
                  <p>“When Jatembe finally exhaled, he sent magical fire into and through the roots. At that moment the Tempest-Sun Mages and Azure Leopard released their lightning, which snaked over and through the spawned multitudes. Before they could grow again, the fire melted the spawn fragments into ooze as they screeched in fury. The ooze seeped into the soil, where the web of roots covering the entire forest drank it up.</p> 
                  <p>"When the screeching abated, Jatembe stopped the fire. He and the other mages drew the roots back into the earth. Agohbindi, which could not be destroyed, which flooded the forest like water, was absorbed, like water, into the soil.” The woman pointed at the tree Hioba had been studying. </p> 
                  <p>“Into that tree, and the others like it.”</p> 
                  <p>Hioba turned around to look at the tree again. “Is there something about the evil trapped within that makes the tree gold?” </p> 
                  <p>“Ha, no. Jatembe just thought it might make Agohbindi <em>furious</em> to be trapped in something so beautiful.”</p> 
                  <p>“Also... wait... how do you know so much about this? How do you know this story?” Hioba turned back to face the woman, who was donning an ornate leopard mask. Once the mask was on, she stepped out of the shadows and into the light.</p> 
                  <p>“Aaaaah, and here I was, holding out high hopes for your powers of observation, child. I’ve given you the start; now keep with your studies. Agohbindi will surely need to be contained once more, someday.”</p> 
                  <p>Hioba tried to speak, but Azure Leopard was gone.</p>

                  <br> 
                  <p>PaizoCon is a unique event for the Pathfinder community. We therefore want to share a massive and exciting update on the first board game set in the Pathfinder roleplaying game’s Age of Lost Omens setting: Pathfinder Arena.</p> 
                  <p>Pathfinder Arena is a competitive game for 2 to 4 players, an epic clash between Pathfinder’s most iconic heroes and most fearsome monsters. Heroes must compete against the challenge posed by an entity called Arena until one champion remains. Although heroes cannot directly attack each other, they can use monsters to do so. While monsters never leave their initial tile, the board representing the Arena itself is in constant movement. Players can alter the Arena’s structure by pushing tiles orthogonally. Such movements can bring an opponent hero in range of a devastating attack by one or more monsters—a great way to score points in the game.</p> 
                  <h3>Pathfinder Arena: Core Set Components</h3> 
                  <p>The Pathfinder Arena core set features a terrific number of plastic miniatures: 4 iconic heroes (Valeros, Merisiel, Ezren, and Kyra) and 14 monsters (Minotaur, Ogre, Ettin, Fire Elemental, Medusa, Ankhrav, Troll, Velstrac, Erinyes, Blood Demon, Chimera, Wraith, Vampire, Frost Giant). The set will also contain more than 100 cards of features and items, 48 Arena tiles, over 300 tokens, and more!</p> 
                  <p>All the miniatures will be compatible with the main series of miniatures dedicated to the Pathfinder roleplaying game. </p> 
                  <p>Along with the rest of this news, perhaps most exciting is the release of the first official draft of the Pathfinder Arena rulebook. You can download it now from <a href="https://www.giochiunitiinternational.com/pathfinder-arena/" target="_blank">the Pathfinder Arena website</a>.</p> 
                  <h3>Pathfinder Arena: Expansions</h3> 
                  <p>You will also have the chance to expand your Pathfinder Arena experience well beyond the core set! As mentioned in our previous updates, we have run two surveys to let the community decide which heroes and monsters should be included in the expansions. As a result, the heroes expansion features Fumbus and Seoni, while the monsters expansion includes the Goblin Pyro, the Gargoyle, the Nightmare and the Mummy Pharaoh.</p> 
                  <p>In addition to these two announced expansions, we have prepared a third expansion fully dedicated to the Age of Ashes Adventure Path! It features Belzamog, a Charau-ka, a Dragonshard, Nketiah, and a Skeletal Hellknight!</p> 
                  <h3>Pathfinder Arena: Crowdfunding Campaign</h3> 
                  <p>Pathfinder Arena will come to life thanks to a crowdfunding campaign that will kick off likely around October/November 2021. The platform hosting the campaign is yet to be determined.</p> 
                  <p>What we do know is your day 1 bonus: a magnificent miniature of a Black Dragon! It will be available only for our Day-1 backers, so be sure to subscribe <a href="https://www.giochiunitiinternational.com/pathfinder-arena/" target="_blank">to our official page</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/403722200813208" target="_blank">join our Facebook group</a> for updates on the official start date of the crowdfunding campaign and see all the aforementioned miniatures and components.</p>

                  <p><em>[Begin transcript]</em></p> 
                  <blockquote> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> Aaaaaand action! Who’s ready for an extreme casting call?! For today’s special broadcast, we’re here on scenic planet Kelikazord recruiting the next team of superstars for our mega-hit series, <em>Live Adventure Extreme!</em> Everything about this world, including the ground we’re standing on right now, is one hundred percent alive. Now that’s extreme! The weather’s mostly sunny, but we’ve got some cloud cover rolling in—our orbital scans tell us those green clouds are highly toxic gases. Good thing I don’t need to breathe, am I right? But you’re not here for a weather report, are you, dear viewers? It’s about time to meet our contestants. Let’s see if they have what it takes to become the next Extreme Adventurers! Alright, folks, why don’t you introduce yourselves to our audience back home? Contestant Number One, you’re up first. Tell us your name and why you want to be on the show.</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #1:</b> (Speaking alien language)</p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> What’s that? Wait a minute, the translator’s not working. Wazasha, get the field-tech team on this ASAP, will you? </p> 
                   <p><b>Wazasha:</b> I’m already on it.</p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> Excellent! I knew I could count on you.</p> 
                   <p><b>Wazasha:</b> Watch where you’re pointing those finger guns, boss.</p> 
                   <p><em>(Zo! laughs)</em></p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> Haha, safety first, you got it. Now where was I? Right! As I was saying, today we’re here for an eeeeeeexclusive first-contact scenario with some up-and-coming reality stars from the Vast looking to break into the Pact Worlds scene! That’s right! We’re here with three representatives of cultures never before encountered in the Pact Worlds, folks, and they’re ready to show you what they’re made of!</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #2:</b> (Speaking alien language)</p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> Oh, I can tell they’re building up to something big! Contestant Number Two here seems like a real pro, you can just tell by the way they move that they’ve got some serious combat training. Ex-military, maybe?</p> 
                   <p><b>Wazasha (muffled):</b> They’re just standing around, Zo!</p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> Let’s get the cameras in there, then. That might spice things up.</p> 
                   <p><em>(Buzzing and whirring sounds, followed by a series of clicks)</em></p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> See now, what did I tell you? </p> 
                   <p><em>(Deep rumbling and growling sounds)</em></p> 
                   <p><b>All Aliens:</b> (Yelling in alien language)</p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> —that thing! </p> 
                   <p><em>(Loud bestial roar)</em></p> 
                   <p><b>Wazasha:</b> What is that?</p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> That, Wazasha, is the talent! Feast your eyes upon today’s obstacle, folks. As tall as a Vercite skyscraper, it’s a horrific sight beyond your wildest nightmares! Look at those horns, those teeth! It could tear any of us in half just like snapping a toothpick. Oh, it’s extreme, all right. And our three brave contestants are going to take it down!</p> 
                   <p><em>(Roaring, followed by frantic yelling in alien language, grunts, and combat sounds)</em></p>

                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> Oh, look at that. Number Two’s charging right in there. It’s a good thing they’ve got that armor, because those teeth look nasty. Contestants One and Three are setting up for some extreme teamwork. Whoa! Three boosted One right up to smack the beast in the face with her blade. Ouch, that looked like it hurt! Our three contestants just scored first blood! </p> 
                   <p><em>(Howling, then a resounding thud)</em></p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> The beast retaliates! Wow, Contestant Number Three went flying. I hope she’s okay! We’ll have our medical team take a look after the fight. Oh, there goes One ripping into the monster’s leg. Way to fight back, One!</p> 
                   <p><em>(Grunting and yelling in alien language.)</em></p> 
                   <p><b>Wazasha:</b> Translator’s back online.</p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> Excellent! Now we can get some extreme reactions from our contestants. Alright, Number Two, can you tell me about your team’s combat strategy?</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #2 (panting):</b> I thought this was a casting call!</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #1 (wincing):</b> Yeah, we prepared a traditional Kelikan opera for—oh no, it’s coming, dodge!</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #2:</b> Thanks! It almost took my head off with that hit.</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #1:</b> We thought we were auditioning for a variety show.</p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> What an extreme miscommunication! But I’m sure Kelikan opera is lovely. Why don’t you go ahead and share that performance with the audience?</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #2:</b> We need Uaya to sing the bassline, and she’s out cold. </p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> Wazasha?</p> 
                   <p><b>Wazasha (sighing heavily):</b> I’m already on it, boss.</p> 
                   <p><em>(Sound of a trigger clicking)</em></p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #3:</b> Huh? What happened? Did we get the part?</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #1:</b> The smiling dead man wants us to sing now. </p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #3:</b> While we’re fighting this thing?!</p> 
                   <p><b>Aliens #1 and #2:</b> Yes.</p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> You betcha! Three, you should be feeling pretty spry right about now. My assistant just shot you with AbadarCorp’s new “Get Up ‘N’ Go” serum, a healing and enhancing vitamin cocktail, available at pharmacy superstores near you! Alright Contestant Number Three, hit us with that beautiful bassline.</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #3 (clearing throat):</b> Here goes. And a one, two, three—</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien Beast:</b> If they actually start singing, I’m done here. </p> 
                   <p><b>Alien #2:</b> Wait, the monster we’re fighting can talk, too?</p> 
                   <p><b>Alien Beast:</b> And how do you think I negotiated my contract? I possess the powers of speech, but it seems you drew conclusions about my intellect based on my physical appearance. How rude. Now listen here, Zo!, my agent said I could be on your show if I beat up these weaklings. I took one of them out and you woke her up to belt out showtunes? Preposterous. I’m calling my agent.</p> 
                   <p><em>(Sounds of alien beast stomping off)</em></p> 
                   <p><b>Zo!:</b> What a wild turn of events! A ferocious fight to the death gives way to a surprise musical performance, starring our three remaining contestants. You don’t want to miss it, folks. But first, let’s hear a word from our sponsor: AbadarCorp, makers of the new “Get Up ‘N’ Go” serum!</p>

                  <p>When I was approached about writing the Father’s Day blog, I accepted right away, knowing it would be relatively straightforward to come up with some clever gaming puns or some Father’s Day gifts in the form of silly magic items. (What dad doesn’t want a pair of argyle socks that magically clean and fold themselves?) Over the coming days, as I reflected on my five years of fatherhood (and counting), and on my own father, trying to come up with more ideas for a roleplaying game-related Father’s Day blog, I realized jokes were my easy way out. Surely, I thought, I could write something deep and meaningful about my first RPG session with my five-year-old son. So, this past weekend, I sat down to plan a game for him. That also would not turn out exactly as I planned.</p> 
                  <p>I felt intense pressure to get it right. I wanted something great to write about for the blog, of course, but I also needed it to be right for my son. After all, I thought, roleplaying games have deeply impacted my own life. My brother and I remain close, even into adulthood, in no small part because of roleplaying games. I met my spouse and my dearest friends through roleplaying games. Playing and writing those games has gotten me through many difficult times. I’ve seen tabletop games have a similar impact on countless others. I had to be a great dad and get it right for my son.</p> 
                  <p>I faltered. How could I ever meet such expectations? Thinking of roleplaying games and fatherhood reminded me that my brother and I started playing right around the time our own father began to have less presence in our lives. This only increased the pressure I was putting on myself. At a time in my life when I most needed a father, roleplaying games filled the void in a way. Roleplaying games helped me learn collaboration, cooperation, creativity, resilience, compassion—and even provided an outlet for pent up emotions. (Speaking of things we can learn from our dads. Ha.)</p> 
                  <p>The day before I’d planned to run my son’s first session, I was tired, dinner was over, and it was time to play before getting ready for bed. I wasn’t thinking about the blog, and my complex emotions about fatherhood meant I had no plans for the game. When my son and I went to play, one of the most surreal experiences of my life unfolded. He asked if I wanted to build a maze with him using some magnetic tiles—one of his favorite toys. Of course, I said, but you’ll need to show me how. He laid out a basic floor plan. He put up some walls. I watched as he carefully considered the placement of each tile, occasionally changing his mind about the direction of a given corridor, or where the entrance would be. He blocked off one of the paths and told me that’s where the bad guys hide. You had to sneak past, or they’d come out and get you. He went to get his toy cars—they’d fit perfectly in the maze. He put in a few bad guys. He put another in the deepest part of the maze and told me I had to rescue it. He gave me another car, said it was me, and picked up one for himself. He drove through the maze, arrived at an intersection, and asked me which way we should go. Your turn, Papa. We went through the maze. We laughed when I was too loud, and the bad guy popped out of the wall to get me. I escaped and drove around until the bad guy got lost in his own maze. Good job, Papa, but you should be more quiet next time. We went and rescued the car. We made it out before the bad guy found us—but just barely!</p> 
                  <p>Without ever having learned himself, my son taught me to play an RPG on a whim, with a map and secret doors and all. He had a story in mind—one he came up with on his own—and we worked together to tell the story. He taught me to try again even when I messed up. He taught me to take turns and look out for each other. When he suggested I fight the bad guy car, and I asked if we could be gentle instead, he respected the boundary I set. He told me that was a good idea and helped me find a creative solution. </p> 
                  <p>This was not so different from the way we usually play, but with the uncanny similarities to sitting down for a game of Pathfinder or Starfinder, I was stunned. Thinking on it, I didn’t know exactly how my son learned all those things—collaboration, compassion, creativity—especially when his access to other adults over the past year has been far more limited than usual. Surely, he learned a bit from me, but also from his mother, friends, grandparents, teachers, and from aunts and uncles. As I tucked him in and he told me, “Papa, I love you, you’re my best friend,” I was somewhat confident he learned to spontaneously express his feelings because I’d modeled it for him. I didn’t think I could take full credit for all of the other things, but I was certain that roleplaying games helped me become the sort of father who could raise a good man. Of course, I still didn’t have good ideas for his first “real” session.</p> 
                  <p>But I sure did know what I was going to write about for the Father’s Day blog.</p>

                  <p>A special image will indicate the scenarios that directly influence the Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot. Scenarios without this branding are stand-alone adventures that don’t tie directly to the events of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. The introduction to the metaplot is an adventure by Mike Kimmel (hey, that’s me!), titled “Year of Shattered Sanctuaries.” It’s a full-length scenario for characters of levels 1–4.</p>

                  <h3>Alexi Greer</h3> 
                  <p>"Hello! My name is Alexi and I wrote the technology section for the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. This book is full to the brim with worldbuilding deep-dives, and I had a blast writing for such a fascinating subject. My other works for Paizo can be found in the Starship Operations Manual and the upcoming Starfinder Society Quest Pack: A Waltz Through Myriad Worlds.</p> 
                  <p>I live in the wild, untamed lands known as Orlando, Florida. When I’m not writing as a freelancer, I’m organizing Society events and volunteering at local conventions. My other hobbies include historical sword fighting, dice collecting, and reptile keeping. Despite all of those things sounding suspiciously dragon-related, I am unfortunately human. Not-so-unfortunately, I share my living space with two furry overlords: a tailless cat named Hecate, and a tail-included cat named Mystique.</p> 
                  <p>I’ve worn a lot of hats in the tabletop industry, from game store management to card warehouse stocker. Writing has been my favorite hat, though. It’s not just a chance to create something new, but an opportunity to help readers do the same with their own games. I hope when you read the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> you find new ideas and new ways of viewing old topics. Should you ever see me at a convention, feel free to say, “Hi” and tell me about your Starfinder adventures!"</p>

                  <h3>John Curtin</h3> 
                  <p>My name is John Curtin and I’m thrilled to be making content for Paizo! Besides being part of the absolutely amazing team that worked on the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, I’ve contributed the Opulus Ambassador to Starfinder <em>Adventure Path #30: Puppets Without Strings</em>, created the astriapi and ravenous drakes for <em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em>, and co-wrote the repeatable <rm>
                    Starfinder Society Scenario #2-19: Truth Keepers with Natalie Kertzner. I started playing TTRPGs on a middle school bus ride where a friend introduced me to the idea of a story I could interact with, and my bookish brain immediately latched on and hasn’t let go since! I’ve been casually writing adventures and characters, off and on, for the 20-some-odd years since, and love sharing stories with tables of fellow adventurers and story-tellers. All of this culminated at PaizoCon 2019, where a highly goofy Twitter side project and a chance introduction to Joe Pasini culminated in a follow-up message post-con where I apologized for being an awkward dolt and suggested that I of course would be thrilled to write for Starfinder, even if wasn’t the impression that spilled out of my mouth while I was busy being starstruck from meeting a real Paizo employee in the flesh. The rest, as they say, is history!

                  <p>When I’m not gaming or writing, my wife and I love to explore the outdoors, try new cuisine, and check out museums and live performances of all stripes.

                  <p>Hey, y’all! You may know me from my time at Paizo in various roles. In the two years since I’ve become a substitute paraprofessional and have undergone a total creative reset. With some encouragement from my friends and former coworkers, I took the opportunity to contribute to <em>Alien Archive 4</em> and the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I have a deep love of the natural world and sharing all I can about it with others. Writing up the desert biome entry prompted diving into all I could find about the earth's own fantastic and weird arid ecosystems, and if anyone ever wants to talk about those plants, rocks, and critters, I'm 100% down! Lately, I get outside with my sweet pittie-lab mix, Sagan, maintain more than 50 houseplants, take pictures and video, and work on my incredibly laggy <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> island.

                  <p>Hi, I'm Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, regularly credited as Sasha Laranoa Harving (nov/nov), and I'm a freelance designer! I wrote the mechanic, solarian, and vanguard class options you'll find in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I'm also an active participant in Starfinder Society as a four-nova GM, and a regular contributor to design work for several third-party publishers. When I'm not writing for Paizo I'm usually working with Legendary Games on their Stellar Options line (among other things), helping Storm Bunny Studios with the Starfinder conversion of the World of Alessia campaign setting, and advocating for queer liberation in the city of Chicago.

                  <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a full time freelance author. I started freelancing in 2019 with <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #2-03: The Withering World</em> and over the last two years I have contributed to just over 30 projects for Paizo, including the <em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, <em>Alien Archive 4</em>, <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #39: The Gilded Cage</em> (volume 6 of the Fly Free or Die Adventure Path), and seven organized play scenarios. For the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> I wrote the technomancer and witchwarper class options, the alignment world attribute, and (my personal favorite) the background section, which is a series of random tables to help players create or further develop their character's backgrounds, life experiences, and relationships. Contributing to the Galaxy Exploration Manual was a wonderful experience and I couldn’t be prouder of the final product. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I do.

                  <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3> 
                  <p>Hello! I'm Kendra, and I've been freelancing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for about 5 years now. I wrote the airborne biome, mystic connections, operative exploits, and the NPC toolbox for the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I really enjoyed working on all those sections, but my favorite part was probably the food sidebar of the airborne biome. Adding in little details like food, cultural traditions, and aphorisms can make a setting come alive and feel like a living world outside the game table, so I always try to work those in where possible, whether writing or GMing.</p> 
                  <p>Other Paizo projects I've worked on recently include <em>PFS Scenario #2-15: A Dirge for Sarkoris</em>; the caligni, maftet and scalescribe in <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em>; and <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #37: The White Glove Affair</em> (volume 6 of the Fly Free or Die Adventure Path)—which also involved some food research, funnily enough. I have a few other cool things in the works as well, both in Pathfinder- and Starfinder-land, and will hopefully be able to say more about those soon!</p> 
                  <p>When I'm not writing or playing TTRPGs, I can be found reading (current obsession: the October Daye books by Seanan McGuire), playing video games (<em>Dishonored 2</em> right now, or <em>Animal Crossing</em> when I need something relaxing), or baking in my very tiny kitchen.

                  <p>Приветствую вас, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m a bit of a regular contributor to these blogs. You may recognize me from past works such as <em>Lost Omen Legends</em> (Baba Yaga, Eutropia), <em>Pathfinder Scenario #1-15: Blooming Catastrophe</em>, and <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #31: Waking the Worldseed</em> (the Hibb Gazetteer). When not seeing how much I can mix satiric comedy and cosmic horror, I’m a Russian-American historian and educator, specializing in diplomatic history. I’ve published a book, even, which some people have read.</p> 
                  <p>For the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, I’m responsible for the Starship Toolbox, most notably the <em>Known Variable</em> (working title: <em>The N-1-MH</em>), and the Accord section, which means that if you ever want to use Leadership in Starfinder, you may thank and/or blame me.</p> 
                  <p>Today though, I also want to mention another project I’m working on: <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> is a setting based around the idea of what happens when a high-cyberpunk technological society collapses very, very thoroughly, and then a thousand or so years later you have a nice, swashbuckling pseudo-Renaissance city state built on the ruins (literally). Check out our Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>, and keep an eye out for upcoming product—our first kickstarter project (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/luminantage/fauna-of-the-luminant-age" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/luminantage/fauna-of-the-luminant-age</a>) will be delivered soon, which means the second one is on the horizon.

                  <p><em>Marhaba</em>/hello fellow Pathfinders and Starfinders! My name is Shahreena. My works are often inspired by world languages, cultures, and traditions. I’ve contributed to several projects for Starfinder; more recently, the Religion section in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I was excited about contributing to this section--especially, the adventure hooks--as some were inspired by the zany interactions among characters of my local lodge. (Buckeye Lodge, y’all are awesome!) In 2020–2021, besides playing online with many amazing inter/national Pathfinder and Starfinder players and sharing my love of GIFs with nufriends, I embarked on a new creative journey. I started adapting world languages, folktales, and legends on YouTube. If you’re interested in seeing these works, please visit my YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcZR32EUW9qlAgHaQxfuiew" target="_blank">Storytime with Auntie Nina</a>. Other interests include travelling, writing children’s literature, reading/editing my husband’s fiction, spoiling my cat (Namira), and eating Jeni’s Ice Cream. Oh yea, my favorite Jeni’s flavor is midwest whiskey &amp; pecans.</p>

                  <h3>Abigail Slater (she/her)</h3> 
                  <p>I have been writing stories since I was five, and recently have been lucky to be included in several exciting Paizo projects. Before that, I wrote for local outlets such as <em>The Northern Light</em> and <em>Edible Alaska</em>. In 2014 I was honored to win the Hot Key Books' Young Writer's Prize. Writing for Starfinder opened my eyes to how diverse the community of tabletop game writers is, as well as made me realize how limitless the genre truly can be. My hobbies include running, squishing my cats, and playing <em>Talisman</em> way past my bedtime. </p> <!--<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com"><img width=300 src="https://cdn.paizo.com" hspace="5" alt=""></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>-->

But when their rickety starbus breaks down with mere hours left in the journey, the musicians will have to pack up their instruments and hitch a ride or two through the asteroids of the Diaspora. Will the power of music help them get to the gig on time, or will they miss their shot at making it big?</p>

                  <h2>OPA Musings</h2> 
                  <p itemprop="description">I thought about writing “no musings, head empty, only PaizoCon” in this space but <s>Tonya told me I couldn’t</s> I decided against it. Instead, I’m going to take this space to give a shout-out to some people who went above and beyond in making PaizoCon Online happen this year. Please note that I’m writing this two days <em>before</em> the convention due to deadlines, so if I forgot someone, I can still blame Convention Brain.</p> 
                  <p>First up, the PaizoCon Online Organizing Committee: <b>David Peevers, Ivis Flanagan, and Mike Bramnik</b>, who volunteered days of their lives (probably weeks, if we total them up) to coordinating all our GMs for Organized Play games. The event <em>literally</em> would not have happened without the three of them, and they all deserve a tropical vacation somewhere.</p> 
                  <p>Next, our HQ volunteers for PaizoCon Online: <b>Aerine Caerwyn, Barb Crase, Nicole Heits, Katrina Hennessy, Sebastian Hirsch, Alex Lenz, Rich Lowe (Stunt Monkey), Elizabeth “Betsy” Nold, and Betty Osthoff</b>. You’ll recognize these names as “those people who were everywhere on the Discord server,” as they got walk-ups seated, coordinated with GMs, and just generally made sure all the machinery was running smoothly. <b>Eric Nielsen</b> gets a special shout-out to himself, as he programmed the reporting tool used by our GMs to report their games. <br> [Tonya’s Note: We really couldn’t pull off an event without all our volunteers—the organizing committee, GMs, and HQ—and we thank them from the deepest depths of our hearts! A huge huzzah to them for stepping up and providing over 800 games to our attendees! I’m honored to be part of such a fabulous community!]</p> 
                  <p>Finally, I want to recognize some of our Paizo staffers. First, I want to thank <b>Aaron Shanks</b> and <b>Leah Beckelman</b>, our Marketing team, put together the streams, blogs, and emails for the weekend, as well as <b>John Feil</b> for the giveaways you all enjoyed. <b>Linda Zayas-Palmer, Thurston Hillman, Jenny Jarzabski,</b> and <b>Mike Kimmel</b> are my colleagues on the Organized Play Team who worked their tails off to get scenarios out to our GMs <em>much</em> earlier than ever before. Finally, a big thank you to all our Paizo staff who moderated or participated in panels and Discord discussions; the staff participation is what makes PaizoCon what it is.<br> [Tonya’s Note: And a huge thanks to Alex Speidel for taking on the bulk of the Org Play planning and organizing so I could focus on pulling things together. He is amazing and an integral part of our operations! To Alex and all the Paizo staff for doing such a fantastic job on PaizoCon, hooray!]</p> 
                  <p>All right, that’s enough words from me. Let’s do this again next year, yeah?</p> 
                  <h2>Starfinder Society Year 4</h2> 
                  <p>Last weekend at PaizoCon Online, we launched Year 4 of Starfinder Society! Remember that <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shoe?Starfinder-Society-Year-4-Rule-Changes">the rules in the latest Guide update</a> are now in effect, and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shng?Starfinder-Society-Update-Year-4-Program-Changes">all scenarios played from this point on should not award Fame, but do award Achievement Points</a> for Starfinder Society.</p> 
                  <p>We hope you enjoyed the new scenarios at PaizoCon Online, and we look forward to unraveling the mysteries of the Year of the Data Scourge!</p> 
                  <h2>Pathfinder Society Year 3</h2> 
                  <p>Now that Starfinder Society’s new storyline has launched, our attention is turning to Pathfinder Society. We encourage Pathfinder Society players to read the blog next Thursday to learn exciting news about Year 3!</p> 
                  <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                  <p>In the lead-up to PaizoCon Online, we put our various noses to the grindstone to get plenty of new content sanctioned for play! The following content has been sanctioned in the past month:</p> 
                  <p><b><a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society (second edition)</a></b></p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a></li>

                  </ul> 
                  <p><b><a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Starfinder Society</a></b></p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li><a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk">The Devastation Ark Adventure Path</a></li> 
                   <li><a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyFreeOrDie"><em>Fly Free or Die Adventure Path</em></a></li> 
                   <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uo?Starfinder-OneShot-1-Band-on-the-Run"><em>One-Shot #1: Band on the Run</em></a></li> 
                  </ul> 
                  <p>Do note that while Chronicle Sheets and reporting are now available for the Starfinder Adventure Paths, their character options are not yet; we aim to have these out by the end of the month, but they are taking just a little bit longer due to PaizoCon preparations.</p> 
                  <p>Next on our agenda are <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix"><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em> Adventure Path</a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands</em> Adventure Path</a> for Pathfinder Society (second edition), the character options from <em>Fly Free or Die</em> and <em>Devastation Ark</em>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual"><em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026l2?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight"><em>Junker’s Delight</em></a> for Starfinder Society, and the outstanding Pathfinder Society (first edition) content. Now that we’re caught up with the content in both active programs, we hope to continue sanctioning at or near the product release dates going forward.</p> 
                  <h2>Campaign Coins and Order of the Wayfinder</h2> 
                  <p>At the end of PaizoCon Online, we gave out several Campaign Coins to exemplary volunteers. These volunteers have gone above and beyond the call of duty, and are recognized with a metal coin and an updated Organized Play ID number.</p> 
                  <p>Jared Thaler &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>842</b><br> Mark Koopman &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>843</b><br> Eric Nielsen &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>844</b><br> Michael Tracey &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>845</b></p> 
                  <p>In addition, each year we select one person to receive the Order of the Wayfinder. This award recognizes a volunteer whose efforts on a particular project merit the highest honor the Society can give. We consult with the previous recipients to make our determination.</p> 
                  <p>For 2020, we have awarded the Order of the Wayfinder to <b>Jesse Davis</b>, RVC of the Online region. Without Jesse’s work setting up the Online region, we never would have made it through the transition into online play during the pandemic. He has been a tireless advocate for online play, and we’re happy to grant him this award, as well as Organized Play ID <b>105</b>.</p> 
                  <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                  <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve their fifth milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the fifth milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                  <p>Two GMs received their fifth star in the past month. In addition, we are pleased to announce our first 5-Glyph GM for Pathfinder Society (second edition)!</p> 
                  <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Erika Emrick, Dave Williamson<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Eric Nielsen</p> 
                  <p>Congratulations to our new 5-Star and 5-Glyph GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com.">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                  <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                  <p>Last week, we posted <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shoh?PaizoCon-Europe-Online-2021-Tickets-GM">an update on PaizoCon Online Europe</a>. If you’re interested in GMing or playing at this event, where we’ll be launching Year 3 of Pathfinder Society, check out that post!</p>

                  <p>I’m very happy to say: the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> is the book you’ve been waiting for.</p> 
                  <p>When Joe Pasini, lead developer of the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, asked me to write the Sandbox Adventures chapter for this book, I was both excited and intimidated. Making a sandbox campaign is a tremendous logistical challenge, but it’s also highly rewarding—as any of you who have played in sandbox games can attest. And because sandbox-style games have a long history in our hobby, there’s a lot of advice on this topic out there already, much of it written by simply brilliant creators. My job was clear: to take the best of that advice and then fine-tune it to the unique qualities and attributes of the Starfinder RPG.</p> 
                  <br> 
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e3d0679a-3aff-41ca-8995-5f7229dbdb93/060221_GEMSandbox.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e3d0679a-3aff-41ca-8995-5f7229dbdb93/060221_GEMSandbox.jpg" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" width="80%" alt="A packed travel hub full of different alien races of the galaxy, in the foreground is a blue skinned orc pushing a trolley full of luggage, leading the group of travelers disembarking is a skittermander and their baby"></a>
                   <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                  </div> 
                  <p>To take one example, Ray Winninger’s <em>Dungeoncraft</em> series of essays (originally published in Dragon magazine from 1997—1999) is packed with great advice on making sandbox settings and adventures. In those articles Winninger created an entire fantasy setting from scratch, just to show us all how it is done (and then, when he was finished, he went back to the beginning and did it again, an effort only interrupted when Paizo began to publish Dragon). You’ll see some of Winninger’s advice—like giving every NPC, location, and object you create for your setting a secret which the PCs can discover—in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. But not all advice is useful for every RPG; when discussing the ideal number of players a GM should recruit, Winninger suggested, “you'll want to limit yourself to eight or ten players as a general rule.” Some RPGs work great with 8-10 players, but Starfinder isn’t really designed for that; all our advice on encounters and challenge rating is based around groups half that size—and many of us have trouble finding even four players, let alone 10! </p> 
                  <p>Ron Lundeen—whom most of you already know as a developer on Pathfinder and author of many adventures for both that game and Starfinder—also lent me his experience and knowledge. Ron has written extensively about the incredible challenge that sandbox games present to GMs; a GM can easily fall into the trap of thinking they have to prepare every possible location the player characters might go, and that level of preparation takes so long that the game itself never happens. And if this is a challenge in a fantasy RPG where characters are limited to wherever their horses or ships can take them, imagine how much worse the problem becomes when the PCs have a Drift engine, and any planet in the galaxy is only a single Drift jump away! How does the GM prepare, when the PCs can go anywhere?</p> 
                  <p>The answer is, of course, “they don’t.” Instead, the GM gates some adventure locations behind other locations, nesting one sandbox inside the next. So, for example, the PCs might be exploring an ancient alien ruin—their first sandbox—when they discover coordinates to other ruins on the other planets in the star system, worlds they had no reason to visit… until now. And the GM can steer the PCs by making some adventure locations obviously more hazardous or more difficult to get to—which will probably prompt the players into putting those locations off for a while, at least until they gain a level or two. The players still have plenty of choices; in fact, by reducing the choices from “an infinite galaxy” to something like three or four—and giving those remaining choices some specific details that the PCs can rely on to make informed choices—the GM can actually help the players avoid decision paralysis. Any Paizo designer will tell you: sometimes too many choices is as bad, or worse, than no choices at all. And then, when the players do decide where to go, you can use the tools in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> (perhaps with a little assist from the <em>Deck of Many Worlds</em>) to actually make those settings, often with help from your own players!</p> 
                  <p>Beyond advice for how to create basic sandbox-storytelling structures for your game, there’s so much more in this chapter of the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. You’ll find advice on reskinning creatures—so even if you’re creating a brand new setting, you don’t have to create all the alien creatures yourself—and how to get started, by creating a home base with a steady cast of NPCs whom the PCs can go to for healing, crafting, and pawning their loot. Our game is unique in its particular combination of science and fantasy, so there’s advice for combining both in your setting to make it really feel like Starfinder. You’ll even find advice on building random encounter tables; we don’t use random encounters much in Starfinder Adventure Paths or modules, because they’re a bit antithetical to the structure of an Adventure Path. It’s hard to predict what level the PCs will be at any given point in an adventure if the PCs are having random encounters and gaining a variable amount of XP. But random encounters are key to sandbox adventures, where the PCs level up at their own pace and can often find themselves facing creatures far too deadly for the group’s level. </p> 
                  <p>The <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> shows you how all of these tricks work by providing specific examples: a sandbox setting called the Alqet system, built from the ground up for this book. Alqet’s got NPCs, secrets, clues to those secrets, multiple adventure sites, sandboxes nested inside other sandboxes, and even a random encounter table. Sidebars walk you through the creation of Alqet one step at a time, a blueprint for you to use as you create your own sandbox campaign</p> 
                  <p>But that’s not all! We added support for other genres too, from cyberpunk and hard sci-fi to high science fantasy settings like <em>She-Ra</em> or <em>Masters of the Universe</em>. You’ll find advice on building settings, campaigns, and adventures for military sci-fi, post-apocalyptic stories, parallel worlds and time travel, space westerns, and even planetary survival stories like <em>The Martian</em>.

                  <h4>Fantastic Worlds Presents: Starfinder Live Play: Clone Batch Catastrophe - Part 1 (10 AM-12PM)</h4> 
                  <p>Fantastic Worlds Presents: When some adventurers explore the false moon of Salvation's End, they discover a newly opened vault ripe for exploration.</p> 
                  <h4>The Medusa Effect: How to Create Engaging Villains Without Relying on Stereotypes (1-2 PM)</h4> 
                  <p>Good villains antagonize the party, but great villains are direct foils for the characters, contrasting with them and highlighting their differences or dark similarities. To create these engaging villains, a GM often pulls their inspiration from the real world in order to bring their antagonists to life—which can result in taking narrative shortcuts that, despite our best intentions, are rooted in damaging stereotypes of marginalized groups. In this panel, the members of Fantastic Worlds Productions will be delving into how to go about creating delightful, thrilling, and dangerous three-dimensional characters without relying on harmful caricatures as our community strives towards fostering more inclusive gaming spaces. We will give you tips and techniques on how to avoid problematic cribbing while still creating fearsome foes that your party will love to hate!</p> 
                  <h4>Fantastic Worlds Presents: Pathfinder 2e Live Play: Freedom For Wishes - Part 1 (3–5 PM)</h4>

With wishes dispensed like confectionery to the guests, Vayn's manor is now something out of a child's wildest imagination, and Sedeq's town guard are paralyzed to act. With few good options, the Qadiran government requests assistance in assessing what has happened in Vayn's manor and put an end to the errant wishcrafting.</p>

                 <blockquote> 
                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Ehu Hadif paced back and forth in the Cortex server room, his anxious footsteps beating a staccato rhythm against the tiles. Two of the kasatha’s hands were clasped behind his back, while the other two fiddled with his comm unit and datapad, restlessly checking his feeds for incoming messages.</p> 
                   <p>Being inside the Archive’s Cortex always made Ehu feel out of place, as though he had walked into a temple of a god he did not worship. The constant hum of the towering servers and the flicker of electronic lights were strange to him. He understood exploration, space travel, and setting boots into dirt on new worlds—not the endless stream of digitized data, encrypted in unfathomable numbers and code, that filled this hall. But Guidance, the amalgamation of his deceased predecessors’ personalities, had requested a meeting with him here. So, here he was.</p> 
                   <p>For nearly a year now, Ehu had served proudly as First Seeker of the Starfinder Society. He took this responsibility seriously. The late nights spent under a mountain of paperwork, early mornings waking on a cold crew quarters bunk, the distant smiles of Starfinders he once considered close friends—all those discomforts were worth enduring in exchange for the privilege of leading the Society. Despite the tide of fears and worries that constantly ebbed in Ehu’s mind, his initial year as First Seeker had been a success. He believed that. Under him, the Society had explored the far reaches of space, forging new alliances in the Veskarium and the Vast. Agents had also revisited familiar worlds, including Athaeum and Tabrid Minor. His work as First Seeker was far from done, but he was pleased with the direction he was steering the Society in.</p> 
                   <p>And yet, the words he spoke at his confirmation echoed cruelly in his mind. <em>We now enter a time of peace</em>. That’s what he had believed. Now, Ehu scrolled through his comms history, and each message was a cold knife in his heart. <em>Drift beacons still dark. Colonists all dead or abducted. Fleet sustained heavy casualties. Zigvigix missing in action</em>.</p> 
                   <p>“Thank you for attending us so quickly, Ehu.” The synthetic voice of Guidance startled the First Seeker out of his thoughts. Ehu swiped the screen to clear his message notifications and looked up. A green holographic projection of a lashunta of indeterminate gender stood before him.</p> 
                   <p>“Is this about the mission to Siygess-4?” he asked. <em>The failed mission</em>, he thought, though he kept this assessment to himself.</p> 
                   <p>“Yes,” Guidance answered. “I have more information about the missing colonists to share with you. It seems that the technological anomalies detected at their arrival locations are increasing. Other Pact Worlds have ceased responding to our long-range comms, and we—”</p> 
                   <p>An insistent beeping cut Guidance short. The hologram flickered and shifted to a nebulous humanoid form.</p> 
                   <p>“Guidance? Is everything alright?” Ehu asked.</p> 
                   <p>“Unauthorized users detected,” a computerized voice that differed from Guidance’s boomed throughout the server room.</p> 
                   <p>“We need more information,” Guidance responded.</p> 
                   <p>“Attempts to access system failed. Recommending emergency protection mode,” the unfamiliar voice said.</p> 
                   <p>Ehu couldn’t perceive anything about this new speaker except for its voice—was it the server itself, or some kind of AI other than Guidance that he didn’t know about? Celita would know, but she wasn’t around to ask at the moment. He was alone in exactly the type of situation he didn’t feel capable of dealing with.</p> 
                   <p>“Guidance?” he asked nervously.</p> 
                   <p>After a pause, Guidance spoke again.</p> 
                   <p>“We are shutting down to protect our source code and the Archive’s data. I regret that there is no time to explain,” Guidance announced. </p> 
                   <p>This was all so sudden. What was going on? Ehu opened his mouth to protest, but Guidance continued before he could voice his confusion.</p> 
                   <p>“I do not know when it will be safe to come back online. Until then, we leave the Society in your hands, Ehu. Protect it.” Guidance flickered again, and the projection vanished before Ehu could react.</p> 
                   <p>Ehu touched the screen of his comm unit to check for more incoming messages, hoping something he saw there would explain the guiding intelligence’s unusual behavior. Instead of his comm logs, a notification flashed across the screen: <em>no signal</em>.</p> 
                   <p>“What?” Ehu grumbled. He was right next to the Cortex’s servers. This room had the best connectivity in the entire Lorespire Complex. How could he have no signal in here? Had Guidance affected something in the network when it shut down?</p> 
                   <p>The overhead lights flickered and went out as the server room lost power. Ehu knew a backup generator would kick on in a few minutes—unless Guidance had disabled that, too. Cursing, he groped through the wall of solid black in front of him, wishing for the blinking lights of this room’s resident servers to return. Ehu stumbled down the hall as the sound of gunfire exploded from somewhere within the complex. Panicked cries and frantic footsteps echoed in the darkness all around him. It was impossible to tell if these noises came from outside the building or down the next corridor.</p> 
                   <p>Dim red emergency lights blazed into view along the corridor, illuminating a path. Ehu broke into a jog and ran toward the distant sounds of combat that were steadily increasing in volume. Ehu was a warrior out of necessity rather than by choice; he preferred exploration to fighting, though he could handle himself. Yet now someone—or something—threatened the Lorespire Complex, and his Society. As First Seeker, he would do whatever he had to do to keep them safe. He would fight alongside them.</p> 
                   <p>The sliding exit portal at the end of the hall was stuck. He pushed through the heavy doors with a grunt and stepped into the artificial twilight outside. Chaos unfolded before him. A group of veteran Starfinders battled black machines with strange silver runes glowing on their chassis. Ships dipped and arced drunkenly in the sky overhead, and in the distance, the retractable dome that protected the Station’s Eye stuttered and shook as it struggled to descend.</p> 
                   <p>“Requesting assistance!” a familiar voice shouted. It was Celita. She crouched in a defensive position, firing into a group of the hostile robots. The rig strapped to her wrist blinked intermittently as she yelled into her nonfunctioning comms. Her target’s torso exploded into a fine mist of metal shards as her bullets found their mark, but the other bots kept barreling toward her. They would overwhelm her at any moment.</p> 
                   <p>Ehu called upon his solar mote and charged, feeling the protective solar energy blaze around him. “I’ve got your back!” he called to Celita. Whatever force was targeting the Society, the First Seeker would stand by his agents as they faced down their enemy, together.</p>

                  <p>It’s time for the Starfinder Society to rally together against a mysterious new threat! A series of digital attacks unleashed simultaneously across the Pact Worlds throws the system’s status quo into chaos, leaving an opening for an army of unidentified robotic attackers to storm the Lorespire Complex on Absalom Station. Can the Starfinders defend their headquarters while navigating the technological pandemonium caused by this Data Scourge, discover who or what is behind these attacks, and stop them from destroying the Pact Worlds as we know it?</p> 
                  <p>Welcome to the Year of the Data Scourge.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p><em>The planet of Golarion is gone, and the details about what happened to it are lost to the Gap, a mysterious period of time marked by a void of knowledge about literally everything. Even the duration of the Gap is unknown, and the gods are silent.</em></p> 
                   <p><em>The Starfinder Society is dedicated to finding this lost knowledge, and its members travel across the universe to track down artifacts and relics that might offer clues. Last year, Society leadership made a big bet on the Scoured Stars system, committing much of their resources and personnel to the cause. It was a disaster.</em></p> 
                   <p><em>The expeditionary force was lost, trapped behind an impenetrable barrier. Those that remain struggle to rebuild the Starfinder Society while guarding against enemies that believe now is the time to strike. Our story begins here, with a cast of new Starfinders that seek to make names for themselves...and raise the Starfinder Society up in the process</em></p> 
                   <p>Now...</p> 
                   <p><em>In an all-out assault on the Jinsul fleet, the Starfinders must board a Jinsul warship to take on their fanatical leader. Cutting off the head of the snake proves difficult when it simply grows back</em></p>

                  <p itemprop="description">In Kiutu, a quiet village on the eastern coast of Terwa Lake, young children often grow up listening to tales of the ruins that are visible on an opposing shore, separated from the hamlet by only a shallow inlet. Some stories tell of draconic monsters who haunt and terrorize those who step foot beyond the threshold of the buried temple, and others of the shadowy, winged figures that come to Kiutu in the night to drag misbehaving children to the ruins; whatever the story, the folklore surrounding ancient Bloodsalt carries with it a strong culture of fear and ominousness among Kiutu’s people. Most children grow tired of hearing such tales as they grow into their adolescence, brushing them off as fantasy, though the ruins always remain taboo. But Ija and her peers always accepted that she was a peculiar child, and the young girl never truly outgrew her youthful curiosity. </p> 
                  <p>From as young as 4 years, Ija exhibited an unusual wisdom among the children that age in Kiutu. Even before she was old enough to begin tutoring, Ija could spin entire imaginary universes of her own, and though she couldn’t yet speak full sentences, she would fill sketchbooks with drawings of creatures and characters from her imagination, and from the tales her parents told of the wonderful things they’d seen on their travels. Her mother, a local artist named Ataya, was ecstatic to see Ija’s knack for building worlds, and often the two would spend days drawing stories together, Ataya often drawing fantastical dragons—Ija’s favorite creature—for the toddler to color in. Together they formulated myriad characters, and Ija developed an affinity for a pink dragon her mother doodled, whom the two decided to name Tuku. </p> 
                  <p>When Ija was finally old enough to journey past the sightline of the village, she would traipse with sketchbook in hand down to the nearby lakeshore, where her father often assisted biologists from across the region to set up field studies on Terwa Lake. She’d ask the scientists questions about the animals that roamed outside of the safety of Kiutu’s borders, offering a drawing of what she imagined they looked like in return. </p> 
                  <p>While most of the scientists found Ija’s “endless conversational charisma” endearing, she’d often find herself getting sent by her father to fetch research materials or supplies from the village instead, and while she was sure she’d been behaving, she could never help but shake that she’d done something wrong. </p> 
                  <p>Into her adolescence, Ija still found herself preoccupied with her imagination; notes she’d meant to take from her studies or her father’s scientific lectures would be covered in doodles, or she’d lose minutes of her tutors’ lectures daydreaming while looking at the Bloodsalt Ruins across the lake, envisioning Tuku swooping about in mighty clashes with the monsters that lurk there. But while her imagination was celebrated in her younger years, expectations that Ija couldn’t keep up with were slowly piled upon her as she grew older. Eventually the fond memories of days laughing and drawing with her mother and father’s colleagues felt more and more distant. As her parents, tutors, and peers pressured her to grow up, Ija buried herself deeper and deeper into her imagination, and every night found solace in envisioning Tuku drifting elegantly through the moonlit clouds, rather than dwelling on what she did (or could have done) wrong that day.</p> 
                  <p>One day, on a short field trip to the Terwa River with her teacher and a few other children, Ija found herself separated from the group; she’d become fascinated by a small copse of brightly colored ferns, and in her fixation wandered off without saying a word to her group. While musing at the strange and beautiful flora around her, noting the unusual shapes of the leaves in her sketchbook, she laughed as she thought of Tuku helping her to grab flowers and leaves from far above her reach. The bright oranges, reds, and violets of the blossoms around her seemed to glow with an otherworldly light when she held them close to her face, and Ija could have spent hours there without ever losing focus. Her wild exploration ended abruptly, however, when she caught the sound of her teacher calling her name from the edge of her hearing. Realizing she had missed her lesson and fearing punishment, she shamefacedly ran to catch up with her peers.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84349be9-f6a0-4e2d-b6a0-610b24fd291a/052521_Summoner.jpg"><img width="500" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84349be9-f6a0-4e2d-b6a0-610b24fd291a/052521_Summoner.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Sketch of a dark-skinned human girl, wearing mage’s robes.

                  <br><i>art by Wayne Reynolds</i> 
                  <p>As Ija crested a small rise overlooking the riverbank and regained sight of her group, she noticed her teacher and the other children’s eyes widen in looks of surprise and confusion. Ija glanced down at herself, expecting to find her clothes in embarrassing disarray or marked by a stains or tears she didn’t notice, but there was nothing any more out of place on her person than normal. She looked over her left shoulder and then her right, and instantly shared their amazement. Tuku, manifested in physical form, stood a few feet behind her, eyeing her fellow villagers with curiosity.</p> 
                  <p>Ija marveled wordlessly; how could they all so clearly see her imaginary friend? How was Tuku here and not just in her idle daydreaming? Her teacher stepped forward, his eyes fixed on Ija’s forehead, where the runic medallion she’d crafted for herself years earlier hung from a simple headband. The rune was glowing, and it matched an identical symbol on Tuku’s brow.</p> 
                  <p>“Ija,” her teacher asked in wonder, “how long have you been a god caller?”</p> 
                  <p>She just shook her head, trying to make sense of what was going on. Had she done something wrong <em>again</em>?</p> 
                  <p>Her teacher knelt to look her straight in the eye as he spoke. Tuku snorted defensively behind her as the kindly elder reached out for Ija, but quickly calmed as the teacher spoke:</p> 
                  <p>“My grandfather was a refugee of the Worldwound, you know. He fled Sarkoris a century ago, as a child, when the demons overtook his land. He kept few of the traditions of his people when he met my grandmother and settled here in Kiutu, but he told stories of his childhood. Most memorable among them were his stories of the god callers—those among the Sarkorians who could summon a powerful ally from beyond our reality to aid and guide the people in times of trouble. The Sarkorians called these beings gods, but others call them eidolons, and don’t worship them as my grandfather’s people did. It appears that you are a god caller, too, Ija, and that dragon—”</p> 
                  <p>“Tuku,” she said without thinking.</p> 
                  <p>“—Tuku, as you say, is your eidolon,” her teacher explained. “Just as you and Tuku share a connection, symbolized in the glowing rune upon both your bodies, so too did the holy runes of the Sarkorian god callers shine when the gods were among their people.”</p> 
                  <p>Ija turned to look at her eidolon inquisitively. Tuku returned the look and tilted his head playfully, like a pet dog expecting its owner to throw a stick. Who was this strange creature, who wasn’t quite as imaginary as she’s always thought? She felt as though she already knew him so well. She’d created him as a toddler, after all—or had she?</p> 
                  <p>A small group of researchers working a short distance down the riverbank had made their way up to where Ija and her eidolon now stood. Her father was among them. None of them appeared scared of Tuku, or of her glowing rune. They were simply curious, interested in a new occurrence to document in their findings. Her father, however, looked proud and overjoyed at his daughter’s newfound calling.</p> 
                  <p>Her teacher, noticing the confusion in Ija’s face, offered words of reassurance. “Yes, there is much for you to learn about yourself, Ija. Perhaps you struggled so much to walk the path set before you because you had a different path you were meant to walk, shoulder to shoulder with Tuku here. We can’t teach you these things, your parents and I. You must learn about Tuku and your bond with him on your own, but don’t worry—we will help you how we can, and I am sure Tuku will guide you in his own way as well.” The teacher paused momentarily with thought. “Do not be afraid, young one; the path you walk may be yours alone, but you are never truly alone on your journey.”</p> 
                  <p>Over the coming weeks and months, Ija and Tuku traveled farther from Kiutu than she’d ever gone before, to Nantambu where the libraries of the Magambya promised answers to her calling (if she could focus enough to read them). But unlike the lessons of her youth, Ija found the questions she had sufficient motivation to learn all on her own. And since she learned better by doing than from reading or listening to a lecture, the fact that she could now explore the limits of her power and the strange bond she shared with her dear Tuku meant she never lacked the will to get up and approach the day’s challenges together.</p> 
                  <p>Ija has met many fellow knowledge seekers in her travels, and she makes a loyal, if mischievous, companion. Tuku tends to be aloof and curmudgeonly when interacting with anyone other than Ija, though he eventually warms to those who clearly don’t mean his summoner any harm. Together, Ija and Tuku plan to one day visit the Sarkoris Scar, to learn what they can of their connection from the god callers repopulating the land now that the Worldwound is closed. Until then, however, Ija and Tuku go where their fancy takes them and return often to Kiutu to share drawings and verbal tales of their adventures with her family and friends.</p>

                  <p>Fantastic Worlds Productions is pleased to announce their first Starfinder actual play podcast: <em>Far Beyond the Stars</em>. Join Galactic Mistress Abbie Lammel as she runs the intrepid employees of the EJ Corp freighter ship Calamity through Paizo’s <em>Fly Free or Die</em> Adventure Path! Captain Friday Francisco, played by Dustin Alexander; mechanic Seren Casurus, played by Heidi Owens; crewman Ballad Serenade, played by Jess Negin; and ace pilot Miss Fanny, played by Angel Espinoza, are ready to kick butt, haul cargo, and run from the Golden League—and they sound good doing it. </p>

                  <p>As always, the quality and polish of Fantastic Worlds Productions is at play with <em>Far Beyond the Stars</em>. In the first episode, listeners are treated to a shoot 'em up as the crew tries to help a poor lashunta merchant who just wants to retire, while the background is laid for just how in over their heads these four do-gooders are about to be. Presented with crisp audio and carefully chosen background music, this show is easy on the ears. This cast is diverse, their characters are unique, and their adventures will be <em>literally</em> out of this world!</p>

This moment has been a long time coming—what climactic events will go down as the show nears the end of Book 3?</p> 
                  <p>Along with their Patreon-exclusive Pathfinder 2E podcast <em>The Greatest Show on Earth</em> playing through the <em>Extinction Curse</em>, the members of Fantastic Worlds Productions are here to deliver quality, diverse entertainment through the magic of Paizo’s Pathfinder and Starfinder gaming systems.</p>

                  <p>There will be a total of 14 blocks of games over the weekend. European organizers and HQ volunteers will coordinate most of the blocks, with an American crew taking on the overnight block as well as the Sunday evening block. GMs and players are free to sign up for games in time zones that work best for them.</p> 
                  <h2>Playable Content</h2> 
                  <p>At this event, we’ll be kicking off Year 4 of Pathfinder Society with three new intro scenarios. First up, we have <em>PFS Intro #1: The Second Confirmation</em> and <em>PFS Intro #2: United in Purpose</em>. <em>PFS Intro #3 (3-01)</em>, by Mike Kimmel, launches the year's metaplot. The title has yet to be revealed, as it is the same as the Year’s title. We plan to announce both shortly, so keep your eyes focused on upcoming blogs!</p> 
                  <p>In addition to our new Pathfinder Society releases, there will be a selection of new and favorite scenarios for Starfinder Society, as well as scenarios from both editions of Pathfinder Society. The schedule will appear on Warhorn once it is finalized. Check out the Important Dates section for details!</p> 
                  <p>In addition to our new Pathfinder Society releases, there will be a selection of new and favorite scenarios for Starfinder Society, as well as scenarios from both editions of Pathfinder Society. The schedule will appear on <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-europe-2021" target="_blank">Warhorn</a> once it is finalized. Check out the Important Dates section for details!</p> 
                  <h2>Badges</h2> 
                  <p>For this event, there will be a €10 badge fee for all players. GMs who run 1-2 games will pay €5, and GMs who run 3 or more games, or do not want to play at all, will be granted a free badge. All money raised by badge fees will be divided between three charities as chosen by our organizers: <a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/" target="_blank">Alzheimer’s Research UK</a>, <a href="http://www.mimosa-du-bonheur.ch/asmb/" target="_blank">Fonds Mimosa</a>, and <a href="https://www.krebshilfe.de/" target="_blank">Stiftung Deutsche Krebshilfe</a>.</p> 
                  <p>This convention also features sponsored badges! If you wish to help another player out, you may add an extra €10 badge to your payment, which will be allocated to a community member who requests one. If you wish to request a sponsored badge, email paizoconeurope[at]gmail[dot]com with your name and Warhorn email, no other information necessary. Sponsored badges will be awarded by random draw. Sponsoring a badge is a great way to give a little extra to these charities while also helping out a member of the community; so far at PaizoCon Online, we’ve had a sponsored badge available for everybody who requests one (and still have a few available for attendees).</p>

                  <p>If you have questions about this event, please email the organizing committee at paizoconeurope[at]gmail[dot]com. As this is a licensed partner show, Paizo staff have minimal ability to answer questions and will likely direct you on to the organizers.</p> 
                  <p>We look forward to seeing you all this weekend, and then again in August for our Pathfinder Society season launch! Until then, Erkunden! Informe! Coopérer!</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">Hello again Paizo-verse friends and family alike! It’s Steve from Hideous Laughter Productions, and I’m so thrilled to present to you all an exciting new project our team has been working on for a while now. It’s called Bestow Curse, and let me tell you, we couldn’t be more excited for you to hear about this.</p> 
                  <p>Bestow Curse is a brand-new podcast from Hideous Laughter Productions, an officially licensed partner of Paizo, where we’ll be taking a classic Pathfinder Adventure Path, updating it to the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset, and producing it as a podcast on its own dedicated feed, completely FREE to listen to. This podcast will feature Griffin of the Hideous Laughter podcast once again in the GM seat, taking us through the adventure “<b>Curse of the Crimson Throne</b>.” Many of you might be familiar with this adventure, having played it in its original 3.5 iteration or the anniversary 1e edition. However, Griff’s sure to put his own spin on it, and I promise it’ll be like nothing you’ve heard from out of the Paizo-verse before! Returning to this adventure as well will be Emily, Haley, and myself (all of the Hideous Laughter podcast), and we’ll be introducing our good buddy Chris as a full-time player to round out the party.</p>

                  <br> 
                  <p>So what can you expect from Bestow Curse? When developing this show, we wanted a heavy focus on the city of Korvosa and its inhabitants. We’ll be diving into lore, exploring deep personal connections with NPCs, and fighting to save a city on the brink of anarchy from a tyrannical ruler! It’s a story you’re not going to want to miss, and with the slick action style that 2e is known for, I can’t wait for you all to hear it. The Bestow Curse feed went live May 21, 2021, with our show’s trailer. Since then, we’ve been uploading player/character profiles to catch you up on who we are and who we’ll be playing. On June 4th, 2021, the show begins in earnest with three full episodes and will be releasing biweekly on Fridays afterwards.</p> 
                  <p>See you all in Korvosa!</p>

                  <h3>Guide Update</h3> 
                  <p>The biggest change to the Starfinder Society Guide is that <a href="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/Starfinder-Society-Guide-to-Organized-Play">it’s got a brand new look</a>! We’ve brought it in line with the Pathfinder Society guide and moved it to an online wiki. This change will enable us to make changes and additions more easily than exporting a new PDF every year. Over the next few months, our Guide Team volunteers will be spending some time adding images and otherwise polishing the guide’s appearance. At this time, we anticipate no major text revisions and will update via blog if this changes.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/efc816c8-dc36-4ad5-943a-9b30f01255e7/052021_ACCORD.png"><img width="250" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/efc816c8-dc36-4ad5-943a-9b30f01255e7/052021_ACCORD.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="A blue skittermander multitasking in a black and silver jumpsuit"></a>
                  <br><i>artist Sarunas Macijauskas</i> 
                  <p>As always, there are some rule changes for the start of the new year. Here are the major updates to be aware of:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Three new species are now considered always available for character creation! Players may now build <b>copaxi</b>, <b>ijtikri</b>, and <b>skittermander</b> characters without requiring a boon. Any characters with an Admittance boon should follow the rules laid out in the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq#admittance-boon-always-available">FAQ</a> to use the "Existing Character" benefit of the boon. These species’ respective racial languages are also always available for any PC to learn whenever they would learn a new language.</li> 
                   <li>Speaking of character creation, characters can also now choose named worlds from the <b>Veskarium</b> or <b>Near Space</b> as their Home World at character creation.</li> 
                   <li>On the tracking side: players, not GMs, are now responsible for tracking and entering their downtime on Chronicle Sheets. Players should still roll Day Job checks at the table when possible. Additionally, players can now roll Day Job checks when applying Chronicle Sheets from playing a pregen by using the Profession skill of the character receiving credit.</li> 
                   <li>The rules have been simplified such that purchasing a condition removal with credits (e.g. a casting of remove condition or similar) automatically succeeds. The Starfinder Society provides top-quality medical care to its agents!</li> 
                  </ul> 
                  <p>There are several other minor changes to be aware of; check the <a href="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Changelog">Changelog</a> for a more complete listing.</p> 
                  <br clear="all"> 
                  <h3>Achievement Points and Fame</h3> 
                  <p>As a reminder, all scenarios reported on or after 9am Pacific time on May 28 will earn Achievement Points for Starfinder Society. All scenarios completed after this time should not award Fame on their Chronicle Sheets. More details are available <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shng?Starfinder-Society-Update-Year-4-Program-Changes">in this blog</a>.</p> 
                  <p>We’ve added a number of new boons to the Achievement Points store, and more are coming in the lead-up to PaizoCon! Check them out and start planning what to spend your <a href="https://paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> points on.</p>

                  <h3>Sanctioning Update</h3> 
                  <p>Finally, we wanted to provide some news on the sanctioning front. To help those of you who want to earn some AcP fast, we’ve sanctioned both the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk"><em>Devastation Ark</em></a> <b>and</b> <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyFreeOrDie"><em>Fly Free or Die</em></a> Adventure Paths for play! The sanctioning documents will be uploaded next week as the PDF process is completed, and their rule options will then be made available on the Character Options page.</p> 
                  <p>We were able to sanction both of these APs because we’ve changed Starfinder Society’s sanctioning a bit. Going forward, we’ll only be offering campaign mode sanctioning, to better match how our player base is using the Adventures. This means you can play with whatever character options and optional rules your group prefers, and you’ll get one level of credit to apply to a Starfinder Society character that falls within a specified level range. In addition to earning AcP for these adventures, you’ll also usually only see a capstone boon for completing multiple (or all) volumes of an adventure and applying the credit to a single character. This streamlined process will hopefully help us sanction content as close to its release as possible.</p> 
                  <p>We’re looking forward to launching the Year of the Data Scourge at PaizoCon Online! Keep an eye on the blog for information on how to get involved with our upcoming events - PaizoCon Europe Online and Gen Con - then tune in next Thursday for more Organized Play news. </p> 
                  <p>Until next week - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And get your new characters ready!</p>

                  <h3>James Case (he/him), Designer</h3> 
                  <p>Hi! It’s James again, still here, still hapa. One of the things I’ve noticed more in this last year is that being mixed means your identity can sometimes feel like it doesn’t quite belong to you, since it can feel contingent on where you happen to be—I mean, I didn’t feel particularly Hawaiian or Asian compared to baseline when I lived in… literal Hawaii or Asia. As I’ve been trying to meet more API voices in the RPG space, I’ve often found myself staring at, say, a social media post calling for “Asian American devs” and wondering if the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVR3B01NxiM" target="_blank">Tribunal of Mixed Asian Heritage</a> would be okay with me responding to it, or whether they need me to wait for something that says “Asian American—and mixed!—devs.” It’s a trip.</p> 
                  <p>Regardless! This time last year, I could only hint at a few projects still under wraps, but this year, I’m happy to report my Ruby Phoenix volume is coming soon and I’ve scattered several Hawaiian influences through our books! My favorite has been the nightmarchers, a Hawaiian ghost story that my grandfather (now 101!) told me when I was young, and which I could show him on a recent trip back home. And there’s more to come~</p> 
                  <p>You can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/toriariaria">@toriariaria</a>, where I talk about RPGs some and about J-Rock a lot, so come say hi!</p>

                  <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her)</h3> 
                  <p>I'm a mixed-race Filipino-American transgender woman from Portland, OR, where I'm a professional Game Master, TTRPG writer, and voice actress. I was a contributor to <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em>, and I'm so incredibly excited for you all to see the fantastic things that are going into that book! My upcoming projects include a submission for <em>Unbreakable Vol. 2</em>, an #OwnVoices anthology of adventures inspired by Asian mythology and folklore that's slated for release later this year. I'm also a voice actress in <em>League of Ultimate Questing: Battle Axis</em>, an actual-play podcast where adventuring is a major league sport, complete with sports commentary and hilarious fake ads for in-world products. You can follow what I do on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/mistressdanarpg" target="_blank">@MistressDanaRPG</a>, where I'm looking forward to talking more in-depth about my Pathfinder contributions as they're released!</p>

                  <h3>Eleanor Ferron (she/her), Pathfinder Developer</h3> 
                  <p>My grandfather was Nisei, a Japanese American son born to first generation Japanese immigrants to America. Being mixed race has always left me with a complicated relationship with my heritage, and there are times when I hardly think I should be included in this blog! But I have always had an interest in the stories and culture of Japan. At Paizo, I've worked to try to showcase Asian characters and creatures—not just as foreign abstracts, but as a critical part of the Inner Sea. Most recently, I've been happy to bring tengu and kitsune to your tables as playable ancestries!</p>

                  <p>Hi! I’m John and my mother was from the Philippines, where I lived when I was very young. I am an avid TTRPG player and GM, playing out of the Emerald City Lodge in Seattle, and having achieved my 5th Nova earlier this year. I am also the executive producer for several RPG-oriented podcasts on the Know Direction Network: Intrepid Heroes, an actual play for Paizo APs; Presenting, where I interview folks in the gaming industry; and Digital Divination, where Paizo developer Ron Lundeen and I chat about Starfinder and RPG topics in general. Over the past couple years I have had the opportunity to contribute to several Paizo products, including the <em>Starship Operations Manual</em> and upcoming <em>Galactic Magic</em> hardcovers, the backmatter for two upcoming adventure paths, and another unannounced Paizo hardcover. I have also contributed to six issues of <em>Stellar Options</em> from Legendary Games, a collection of Starfinder player options. When I am not busy with gaming related activities, I am a university professor in the Seattle area, teaching entrepreneurship and marketing. Prior to that, I was an officer in the US Coast Guard where I sailed the seven seas and circumnavigated North America, completing scientific work in the Arctic and Antarctic, and law federal enforcement operations on both the East Coast and West Coast of the US.</p>

                  <h3>Sen.H.H.S. (she/her)</h3> 
                  <p>When I adapted the creation myth of Pan-gu in 2019, I never dreamed that it would lead to me writing for the company whose work got me into TTRPG. A full year has passed since I started freelancing and wow, it's been a journey. <em>Bestiary 3</em>, Ruby Phoenix, <em>Grand Bazaar</em>, and more to come! All done from the other side of the Pacific, thanks to the Internet!</p> 
                  <p>Thinking back, while my cultural identity and knowledge was crucial in helping me land many early gigs, I have to say that being Asian for me in TTRPG space is... complicated. Even just typing this took me several attempts because there are so many talking points I hesitate to bring up, either because it would need very long explanations, or because it might invite controversy. </p> 
                  <p>To put things vaguely, when your culture comes from a place that constantly threatens to erase your home country from existence (and you along with it), there's a lot of conflicting feelings and delicate dancing to do every time you put out work inspired by the culture. You can't erase the history that made you, nor can anyone else. However, if stating your identity blatantly might result in backlash, would you ever be ready for the consequences?</p> 
                  <p>I haven’t an answer, but I know I am still writing. </p> 
                  <p>You can see what I'm up to via my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/senhhs" target="_blank">@SenHHS</a>. Also, I'll be at the Ruby Phoenix panel at PaizoCon Online, so come say hi!</p>

                  <h3>Ruvaid Virk (he/him)</h3> 
                  <p>Hi everybody! I’m Ruvaid, a Pakistani-American, and among the newest crop of freelancers to write for Paizo. <em>Bestiary 3</em> was my first assignment, and I have more work in the upcoming Fists of the Ruby Phoenix AP and <em>Secrets of Magic</em>. Please look forward to it!</p> 
                  <p> Growing up, I didn’t even know what TTRPGs were. It wasn’t until I entered college and met some of my closest friends that I even got a chance to play my first tabletop game, a little thing called Pathfinder. So, to have the opportunity to be a part of this blog and have my name show up in Pathfinder books honestly still feels surreal. </p> 
                  <p> I’m glad to be a part of such a welcoming community, and I’ve had a great time meeting awesome people. Thanks for having me, and I can’t wait to put more content out there for you all to enjoy. </p> 
                  <p>I also have a Discord group where I organize PFS2e games every Saturday morning at 9am EDT/6am PDT that anyone interested is welcome to join! Outside of tabletops, I enjoy practicing calligraphy when I can. I also love bad puns, playing board games, reading and writing fantasy, and playing the critically acclaimed MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>.</p>

Their advice is as relevant today as it was last spring, so we’ve linked them here for reference.</p> 
                  <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh5u?Guest-Blog-Online-Region-Resources-part-1">Guest Blog: Online Region Resources part 1</a></p>

                  <p>Reading over those blogs will give a good overview of playing digital games, but there are a few other considerations to be aware of when signing up for games at PaizoCon.</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Game listings in Warhorn include the platform the game will run on. Be sure to check this information when choosing games, as we have a variety of platforms being used. They include:</li> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Roll20</li> 
                    <li>Fantasy Grounds</li> 
                    <li>Foundry</li> 
                    <li>Play-by-Post</li> 
                    <li>Google Slides</li> 
                    <li>Discord</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <li>Download and install any platform files and create logins before the event. This will help discover and resolve any tech issues, so you don’t miss your game.</li> 
                   <li>Double check the character sheet your GM is using if your VTT supports multiple sheets.</li> 
                   <li>Build VTT copies of characters ahead of time so they’re ready for play. Ensure paper character sheets are up to date for PbP, Google Slides, and Discord games.</li> 
                   <li>Connect to the <a href="http://paizo.events/" target="_blank">Paizo Events Discord Server</a> and accept the server rules in the <b>#community_guidelines</b> channel to make sure you’re ready to go. Bonus, you can join in some pre-convention chatter with other attendees, get personalized help with VTTs, and scope out channels to keep an eye on during the event.</li> 
                  </ul> 
                  <p>Need more resources to help familiarize yourself with the various digital platforms? Check out <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shnj?May-is-Starfinder-Month-at-the-Fantasy">Fantasy Grounds College</a> Starfinder events for this month, or visit the <b>#how-to-vtt</b> and <b>#how-to-play-by-post</b> channel on the <a href="http://paizo.events/" target="_blank">Paizo Events server</a>, where community members can answer questions about the various digital platforms available.</p> 
                  <p>At PaizoCon, there are a few other best practices that will help improve your event experience: </p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Fill out your GM’s sign-in sheet, and be sure to log into your gamespace 10 minutes before your game starts to check in.</li> 
                   <li>On Discord, we’ve used adventure titles as game channel names. We recommend logging in 10 minutes before and confirming the GM is the one listed for your game. If you can’t find your game, visit the <b>#help</b> channel and an HQ volunteer will assist.</li> 
                   <li>If you couldn’t pre-register for a game, visit the <b>#looking-for-group</b> channels for the RPG you want to play. HQ volunteers will start seating walkups 20 minutes before each session.</li> 
                   <li>Provide a contact method to your GM so they can follow up if there are issues with chronicles or reporting.</li> 
                   <li>After your game is over, advise your GM if you will need them to export a copy of your character sheet to use for your next event.</li> 
                  </ul> 
                  <p>We hope to see you at <a href="http://www.paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online 2021</a>. If you haven’t pre-registered yet, you still have time! Pre-registration for games closes at <b>6:00 pm PDT May 24, 2021</b>. After that players will be seated on a walk-up basis the day of the event.</p>

                  <p>It’s been a year of online conventions for us, and while we love that we can still game from home, we’ve missed hanging out with all our players and swapping stories. So, let’s chat! What’s a great moment from the last year of Organized Play gaming? What plot twists shocked you, what jokes broke up the table for 10 minutes, what do you wish you could’ve told us about over a drink? </p> 
                  <p>Here are a few of my favorite gameplay moments from the last year:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>This exchange from the Twitch chat during the first run of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024x0?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-300-The-Last-Bite"><em>SFS 3-00: The Last Bite</em></a> cracks me up to this day:</li>

                   </div> 
                   <li>My oracle made friends with mysterious spirits in a library because they left the spirits some very nice journals to write in.</li> 
                   <li>One of my players managed to tame a dinosaur during <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zh?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Live-Adventure-Extreme"><em>SFS 3-10: Live Adventure Extreme!</em></a> thanks to a natural 20 and a very permissive GM.</li> 
                  </ul> 
                  <p>What were some of your favorite gaming moments of the past year? Post them below or tweet them to us at <a href="https://twitter.com/PaizoOrgPlay" target="_blank">@PaizoOrgPlay</a>, we’d love to hear about them!

                  <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                  <p>Anyone that has played Pathfinder loves goblins. You may not admit it. But you do. Deep down, you want to be a goblin too. That’s why I am looking forward to the new Pathfinder Fumbus comic book that’s currently on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dynamiteent/pathfinder-fumbus" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. We need more goblins and this special book thrusts Fumbus to the forefront and gives us new playable goblin and alchemist material for our Pathfinder campaigns. We be greedy… we want that comic! Sorry… I’m sounding a little Smeagol-like there. </p> 
                  <p>If my name looks familiar it may be that you’ve read some of my comics. I’ve written for all kinds of books over the years: <em>Army of Darkness</em>, <em>The Six Million Dollar Man</em>, <em>Stargate SG-1</em>, <em>Hatchet</em>, and <em>Freddy vs Jason vs Ash</em> (an <em>Evil Dead</em>, <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em>, <em>Friday the 13th</em> mash-up). Horror and sci-fi are my jam, but I do love a good fantasy tale. I have collected all the Pathfinder and D&amp;D comics that have been published and really enjoyed seeing the adventures that normally playout in my head illustrated by incredible artists. There’s just something really special about seeing other peoples’ visions for these iconic characters come to life in comics.</p> 
                  <p>I’ve played RPGs for decades, and yet in all that time there have only been two characters that really made an impact and have lasted with me all the years. One was a human orphan raised by dwarves. The character started out as a PC in what was supposed to be just a one-off Pathfinder game; really just a throw-away adventure for us to have some fun with. But he stuck. Yes, the character was created with comedic intent; I wrote him as a 6’ 6” beast of a human that thought he was a dwarf. He talked like a dwarf, dressed like a dwarf, and even served as a cleric of a dwarven deity. And there were some fun moments playing off other dwarf PCs and NPCs that remained incredulous to his behavior. But he became something far more than just an easy comedic setup for the group to play off of. That character had the heart of a dwarf and went on to do incredible things. That’s why we game after all, isn’t it? To have the chance to rise up from obscurity, become a hero we see inside, and embrace the path of glory. Well, that and bust some monster heads. But what can I say? I told you he was a dwarf at heart.</p> 
                  <p>So, if you want to see the rise of Fumbus, head on over to the Kickstarter page and check it out. And thanks for letting an old comics-nerd share his love of gaming, comics, and horror movies with you. </p>

                  <h2>OPA Musings</h2> 
                  <p itemprop="description">When Paizo hired me, there were a lot of hazards that I expected to come with the job. Traveling a lot? Hasn’t been an issue yet, but I’m prepared for that. Spending more on dice? That’s alright, I don’t have to buy rulebooks anymore, surely that’ll be an even trade (it’s not, but don’t tell my budget). Increased stress from dealing with the public? I worked retail, I’ll be alright. The thing I didn’t anticipate, however, was that my job would become impossible to describe to people.</p> 
                  <p>Usually I start with “volunteer coordination,” because of course I work with hundreds of venture officers regularly. Then I move on to “event planning”—conventions are definitely event planning, people can grasp that. But how do you explain that you had a very important hour-long conversation about whether or not the robots in this art should be humanoid, how many limbs they should have, and what that might signify to players? And that you then spent an hour discussing the implications of glasses on a nearsighted character in a fantasy world?</p> 
                  <p>I’ve also been hired to write <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ts?Pathfinder-Bounty-13-The-Blackwood-Abundance">a Bounty</a> (shameless plug!), and naturally once it was publicly announced I emailed my parents to let them know, because it’s exciting! My dad’s response was, verbatim, “Ok? I gotta say, I’m kinda lost about this adventure. But good job?” Hazards of the job, I guess; my brother works in esports, so I foresee a lifetime of holidays where family members just nod and smile at us.</p> 
                  <h2>PaizoCon Online</h2> 
                  <p><a href="https://paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online</a> is coming next month! We hope you’re all working hard on prepping your tables and characters for a weekend of Paizo gaming.</p> 
                  <p>Last week, we announced <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shnb?Watch-the-Pathfinder-OneShot-Dinner-at">two of</a> <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shn8?Watch-the-Starfinder-OneShot-Band-on-the-Run">our liveplays</a> for the event, as well as the titles of the new Pathfinder and Starfinder One-Shots. PaizoCon Online will be your first chance to play these new adventures, and there are still seats open for both, as well as tons of other tables! Just a reminder that player signups will close on <b>Monday, May 24</b> to give the organizers time to fold tables that won’t fire. Walk-up seats will be available during each slot to fill open seats as they arise.</p> 
                  <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                  <p>At the beginning of April, we released the sanctioning for the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationVaults">Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</a>. We also intend to release the sanctioning for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence"><em>Pathfinder Adventure: Malevolence</em></a> in the next week, once the warehouse is able to begin sending out the book to customers.</p> 
                  <p>Our next items are <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix">Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path</a> for Pathfinder (second edition), and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk">Devastation Ark Adventure Path</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zu?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual"><em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> for Starfinder. We’re also planning to sanction the two new One-Shots, <em>Band on the Run</em> and <em>Dinner at Lionlodge</em>, upon their release at PaizoCon.</p> 
                  <h2>Starfinder Updates</h2> 
                  <p>As we announced last week, Starfinder Achievement Points are coming! As of <b>May 28</b>, all games reported will earn AcP for Starfinder Society, and any games played on or after that date should not award Fame on the Chronicle Sheets. More details on this exciting new change are available in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shng?Starfinder-Society-Update-Year-4-Program-Changes#discuss"></a>.</p> 
                  <p>You can also visit your <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/myAccount">My Organized Play page</a> now to see some of the boons that will be available initially; we’ll add more whenever we have time, so keep checking back! </p> 
                  <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                  <p>We had no GMs reach their 5th rank this month. If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                  <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                  <p>In addition to PaizoCon Online, we have a number of conventions coming up offering Pathfinder and Starfinder Society! If you don’t see a convention on the list that you think should be there, contact the event organizer and ask them to register their event for organized play support.</p>

                  <p>What is <a href="http://www.fantasygrounds.com/" target="_blank">Fantasy Grounds</a> and why is there a “college,” you ask? Well first, Fantasy Grounds is a popular virtual tabletop (VTT) software used to host and play games over the internet. The robust software creates a virtual tabletop roleplaying experience with rollable dice, character sheets, a digital book library, and tools you would expect at your physical game table. What’s more is that it offers unique gaming experiences such as automated combat trackers, GM management tools to simplify distribution of experience and loot, digital battle maps and tokens for tactical play, and much more!</p> 
                  <p>That brings us to the question: why a “college”? The Fantasy Grounds College (FGC) is a group of volunteers who are passionate about VTTs and want to help create player connections for tabletop roleplayers, no matter where they are in the world or the circumstances they find themselves in that prevent physical gaming. Founder Laerun’s vision for the FGC has been, and remains, a commitment to offer classes free of charge and deliver valuable learning outcomes for students who wish to take full advantage of what the Fantasy Grounds software provides. Classes are given for all experience levels, and for players and Game Masters alike!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p>She moves quietly through the house, gathering up clothes and traveling supplies and placing them near her backpack. She retrieves a ragdoll from under the bed, looks at it a moment, then tucks it near her child ensconced in the pile of quilts. Her partner adds a packet of bread and cheese wrapped in waxed cloth to the pile near the pack, then gives her a soft smile before turning back to the cooking area.</p> 
                   <p>“Do you want corn as well as beans dear?” her partner asks softly, careful not to wake the sleeping child in the bed. Naptime is important and neither of them want to confront the fury of an abruptly woken child.</p> 
                   <p>“If we’ve some ground corn, I would take that, but do not want the weight of a quern in my pack and am unsure if I will find mills on my journey.”</p> 
                   <p>The partner checks the crock of ground corn, then empties it into an empty small sack and places the first sack into a second. “There was plenty of ground corn for you to take. I’ve put it in two bags to keep it from spilling through the loose weave of the bag.”</p> 
                   <p>They continue in this manner for some minutes, then stop and look at each other.</p> 
                   <p>“I’ll miss you,” she says.</p> 
                   <p>“As much as I’ll miss you,” her partner replies. They embrace, taking time to breath deep within the circle of each other’s arms. “Stay safe and come back to us when you’ve finished your tasks. We will be here waiting.” Her partner leans forward, placing a gentle kiss on her forehead. “That is from me.” Another kiss. “That is from our child.” </p> 
                   <p>She hugs her partner tight, squeezing firmly, for a few more heartbeats, then opens her arms. She returns to packing, moving faster and more determined. Nodding at the stack of assembled items, she turns to her partner. “I’d like to take your tan sweater, if you don’t mind. It will keep you close as I complete my tasks.” </p> 
                   <p>“Of course, but I’m wearing your blue one while you are gone!”</p> 
                   <p>She grins. “I would expect no less.”</p> 
                   <p>They finish packing, checking the weight and balance of the pack. At last, all preparations are done and they sit to have a cup of tea and wait for the small being to wake. It doesn’t take long, as if the child senses the lack of activity in the home.</p> 
                   <p>“Mom!” The child cries abruptly, before sitting up and blinking as they orientate themselves to their location. They hop out of bed and runs to where the adults are sitting. After a few minutes of cuddling between the trio, the child wiggles free.</p> 
                   <p>Her partner bustles about, pouring some berries from a basket on a shelf onto a wooden plate and adding a slice of bread, slathering it with butter and dripping honey over the surface. They place the plate in front of the child, who greedily starts munching the snack.</p> 
                   <p>“It’s time.” She looks to her partner, who nods in agreement.</p> 
                   <p>“It is.”</p> 
                   <p>“I love you both,” she exclaims as she plants a kiss on the top of the child’s head, then kneels in front of the child. “I have to go for a few days. I should return before the next moon cycle. You stay safe until I get back.”</p> 
                   <p>The child nods and continues eating, attention focused on the consumption of food.</p> 
                   <p>She sighs softly. “The others are probably waiting. Best go now.”</p> 
                   <p>“Find what is harming the herds, slay the beast, then come back to us.” Her partner gives her one quick hug, then crosses the room and opens the door.</p> 
                   <p>“As fast as I can safely do so.” She picks up the pack and slings its straps over her shoulders. Then she reaches for the sword suspended from a belt on the peg near the door. She buckles it on as she takes one last look around the room, then kisses her partner gently on the lips and strides through the door.</p>

                  <p>“Our plans are to continue to keep our pocket editions in print for Pathfinder 1.0 even after 2nd edition launches as long as it remains profitable to do so. I expect that bar will be met for quite some time for the core books like the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, <em>Bestiary 1</em> and <em>GameMastery Guide</em>. Probably also the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>. The other books, which normally have lower sell through, may reach the point where it is unprofitable to reprint them. But if they don't, I am happy to reprint them for years to come if there are people who want to buy them.</p>

                  <p>We strive to use gaming to reduce the stigma around talking about suicide prevention and mental health. Tables are composed of both TTRPG streamers and auction winners who have bid for seats to play with them. We place an emphasis on having a diverse group of GMs and players and accessible tables and games.</p> 
                  <p>Jasper’s Game Day is an IRS designated 501(c)(3) non-profit that raises funds for suicide prevention and awareness. Net proceeds are donated to suicide prevention and awareness charities, crisis centers, and hotlines. We use gaming to build community and spread our mission that You are Not a Critical Failure.

                  <p>Greetings Starfinders,</p> 
                  <p itemprop="description">Two weeks ago, we implemented tech that successfully fixed a number of issues with the Achievements Points system. While there are still some tweaks we’d like to make, the system is at a stage where we are ready to introduce Achievement Points for Starfinder Society. We’ve got a few other changes in the pipeline as well, so read on for a full explanation of what’s coming for the Starfinder Society!</p> 
                  <br clear="all"> 
                  <h3>New Guide to Organized Play</h3> 
                  <p>Approximately two weeks before PaizoCon Online, we intend to release the new version of the Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society. This will be a digital guide hosted on the OPF website, much like the Pathfinder Society version. This will enable us to make changes and clarifications more rapidly, as well as make it more searchable. At this point, there are no major rules changes planned for Year 4, though we have several program changes we’ve outlined below.</p> 
                  <h3>Introduction of Starfinder AcP</h3> 
                  <p>Beginning <b>May 28, 2021</b>, all reported Starfinder games will earn Achievement Points (Starfinder) for the boon store. These points will be earned at the same rate as the Pathfinder Society: 4 points for players and 8 points for GMs in a 4-hour scenario. These will also be granted the 1.25x multiplier at conventions and locations under the Regional Support Program, and a 1.5x multiplier at Tier 1 conventions and Paizo-sponsored/licensed events.</p> 
                  <p>AcP (Starfinder) will be used to purchase Starfinder boons in the online store, available on the Boons tab of the My Organized Play page. We’ve started publishing boons that will be ready at launch to give an idea of what will be available, and will continue to add to this list until launch.</p> 
                  <p>Achievement Points for Starfinder Society will <b>not</b> be retroactive to the start of the campaign. If you played prior to this date, you already earned Fame for those scenarios, as well as additional boons for certain events. We will include an online version for each chronicle boon going forward, though paper boons in circulation are valid for use. </p> 
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3248759d-7414-446b-b50b-bd2c7f7bdc33/031121_TrainBattle.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3248759d-7414-446b-b50b-bd2c7f7bdc33/031121_TrainBattle.jpg" width="80%" hspace="5" alt="Battle taking place on the top of a high speed train"></a>
                   <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                  </div> 
                  <h3>Removal of Fame for Starfinder Society</h3> 
                  <p>With the introduction of Achievement Points, we will be saying goodbye to the Fame system. Here are the important dates for this process.</p> 
                  <p><b>Today</b>: This information is posted. Nothing changes; games played after today still earn Fame until May 28.<br> <b>May 28</b>: Games played on or after this date do not earn Fame. GMs should not award Fame, though players may still spend Fame on the boons listed in the Year 3 Guide.<br> <b>November 4</b>: In our monthly update blog, we will share information on how to convert any remaining unspent Fame to Starfinder Achievement Points.<br> <b>December 31</b>: Any unspent and unconverted Fame is lost.</p> 
                  <p>Any Fame boons that are purchased between now and December 31 will function in perpetuity. We’re not taking away anything that’s already been purchased, and you will be able to use those boons as long as the SFS campaign exists.</p> 
                  <h3>Why Are You Doing This?</h3> 
                  <p>There are several reasons for our switch to the Achievement Points system, for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Society, and we wanted to talk about a couple of them with you.</p> 
                  <p>The first reason is to encourage reporting of games. To be very frank: we rely a lot on the data we get from the reporting system. We’ve used it to influence the story of our living campaigns over the years, but lately, we’ve also been doing a fair amount of analysis on what games the community is playing, as well as when and how you all are playing them. We have found that the AcP (Pathfinder) system encourages reporting, which ensures our data is as accurate and complete as it can be. This ultimately lets us produce a better game, and it’s extremely important to Organized Play.</p> 
                  <p>The second reason is equality. In the past, there were many boons that you could only get by going to a certain convention or event, which is not possible for everyone. In a global campaign, we can’t ask our Australian players to fly to Indianapolis just for the chance to play their favorite species. Even closer to home, going to a major convention is a significant expense that many can’t afford. The Achievement Points system lets everyone earn points at the same rate and spend them on what they want most. It’s another step toward being the most inclusive version of the Society that we can be.</p> 
                  <h3>I Have Questions/Comments/Concerns!</h3> 
                  <p>Great! That’s what this post is for.</p> 
                  <p>The comments section below is open. Please treat this as an open thread for questions, because we’ll be reading and answering as many as we can. Remember the forum rules as you do so: be respectful and civil in your questions, and understand that while elements of the plan may change, there’s no argument that is going to make us totally change course. Any answers we give will be folded into either the Guide for Year 4 or the Starfinder Society FAQ page as appropriate, so you’re not having to cite random forum comments for clarifications.</p>

                  <p>There are many different intersections between autism and gaming.

                  <br> 
                  <p>For this occasion, I’d love to talk about autistic representation in games or the benefits of role-playing games to neurodiverse people—but, being autistic with a penchant for deep dives into subjects of interest, there is no way I can satisfactorily cover that in the 500 odd words available. Instead, I’m going to share a simple but effective intervention that can be used at any table, and which can have a big positive impact for all players, with some unique advantages for autistic ones. Full credit to the wonderful folks over at Game to Grow, who taught most of my group this technique when we were attending a therapeutic GM training</p> 
                  <p>In my wonderful roleplaying group, we start each session with a check-in question asked by the GM. This can be literally almost anything—last time we played it <em>was what is your favorite bird</em>? But it could just as well have been <em>what’s a childhood memory you would like to change? Or if you could have a conversation with anyone at all, who would you choose?</em></p> 
                  <p>We, the players, answer for ourselves, and—when applicable—also for our characters. Depending on the question, the insights here can be profound, intriguing, or hilarious. Our dwarf barbarian’s favorite bird is a sparrow because <em>they’re small, a bit grungy, and always willing to take on something bigger than themselves</em>, much like him. </p> 
                  <p>When we have put down the dice for the evening, everyone answers two more questions, and these are the same every session. First, everyone gives a highlight to another player for making their session awesome, and second—this one is the kicker—everyone shares something that was challenging about the session, or something they’ve learned.</p> 
                  <p>So why is this a good thing for me as an autistic gamer?</p> 
                  <p>Firstly, this ritual creates a social space where it is not only allowed but <em>encouraged</em> for every player to share their unique perspective on the game, and to express when something has been difficult. For me as an autistic who sometimes needs to ask for support or accommodation, this helps level the playing field, so to speak, and creates a structured way for me to express things that are challenging when they happen. The repetitive nature and timing of the questions also help me feel less anxious about speaking up in a social context. Finally, asking and answering these questions facilitates honest, authentic communication, which is not only great for me as an autistic who struggles with small talk and polite pretense, but in a very real way brings the whole group closer together. Some of the best times we’ve had as a group have been the hour-long conversations after the sessions, which grow organically out of the tone and intention set by the check-in and -out questions.</p> 
                  <p>All told, it’s an exercise in connection and trust which helps me as an autistic bridge the gap that can sometimes be present between myself and neurotypical fellow players and feel like an equal and valued member of the group. For me, that’s the best part. </p>

                  <br> 
                  <p>Saroc the Bard is an excellent negotiator. I, on the other hand, am not. Saroc the Bard is an amazing wordsmith. I continually struggle to find the right expressions. Playing RPGs has helped me understand Autism and myself by teaching me better conversation skills, self-advocacy, and learning social cues. For my entire life, it has been difficult for me to have a decent conversation with people as I have a tendency to ramble. Playing RPGs has helped me get better at the balance of back and forth talking that good conversations require and neurotypical people take for granted. Various RPGs have also taught me how important and easy it is to stand up for myself. By practicing in the controlled environment of an RPG, I have learned to have the confidence to tell someone how I am truly feeling or to stop them when they’ve interrupted me. I have also learned how to identify certain social cues, like when someone wants to talk, or is feeling uncomfortable. </p> 
                  <p>Living with Autism has given me a unique ability to do some things that other people find difficult, like finding solutions from multiple angles. Having these abilities has come at a social and emotional cost. Though it is easy for me to make friends, it’s often difficult for me to be aware of how my behavior affects them. I have often felt alone, even when I’m with my friends. But playing RPGs has helped me find people like me; I don’t have to deal with Autism by myself. I have been able to see the positives in what I am capable of doing, instead of focusing on the negatives of what I’m incapable of doing. Playing RPGs has made coping with the chaos of the world much easier by giving me problems I am easily able to solve. Because of this, I am able to find solutions to my real-world problems.</p> 
                  <p>Autism is a spectrum disorder, and even two people with the same diagnosis, like Asperger’s, process the world very differently. RPGs allow for a wide variety of characters; thus, anyone can find a character that fits them. Something that is amazing about RPGs is that people can write the backstories for their characters. Being able to include skills my character has that I’ve wanted has made learning those skills easier, like communicating, negotiating, and self-respect. Learning these skills in a group that won’t judge me for making mistakes has made playing more fun and enjoyable. Since I started playing Saroc 4 years ago, I have learned, quite honestly, to love myself.</p>

                  <p>My name is Shawna Spain, but my online handle is likesevenspoon. I was diagnosed as Autistic in my mid-twenties, and my reactions were a mix of relief that I knew what was wrong with me, finally, and a kind of anger that my brain was so different that I couldn't be "normal." It's been about a decade, and I finally don't feel a desire to be normal—I am happy being me. I am pretty awesome. </p> 
                  <p>When I was first diagnosed, my doctor encouraged me to engage in structured social activities and when I was like, how even do you do that, he suggested I invite people over for board games. So, I joined a TTRPG game, and played board games with people and felt a comfort in those interactions because there are RULES. And everyone just agrees to follow them. Which is like real life, except unlike real life, the rules for these games are written down. Which is awesome. I finally found a world where my brain was less of a hindrance and more of a great thing. </p> 
                  <p>I am a great storyteller, and the framework of the game gives me a place to relax and have energy to tell those stories. That means a lot to me. I can exist in a space for all humans and have fun and meaningful relationships. I can be successful at things, learn things, and play. For someone who grew up branded a weirdo, made fun of for the way I talked, got into fights when someone called me stupid, this is a whole new world. I belong alongside all of these other humans who want to play a game and participate in the collaborative telling of a story. I can practice skill sets that I can use in other parts of my life. After all, being the GM of a game is often using skills that a manager would need in their real-life job. Think about it. There are objectives, and you need to get a group of people to complete them. You need to make it engaging and fun and set everyone up to be a success. Same skill set. </p> 
                  <p>I want more people to play TTRPGs. I want them to be safe spaces for the Neurodivergent community. I want more Autistics to be able to learn the same things I have, and feel the same confidence, and find friends and joy.</p>

                 <blockquote> 
                  <p itemprop="description">“Annnd with a terrifying tail whip to the jaw, the Taiga Tyrant is down! She’ll be feeling <em>that</em> in the morning! Our winner is the Summer Swordsman of Ekkeshikaar!”</p> 
                  <p>Cheers resounded through the stadium as the announcer floated high above, her voice booming. Triangular pennants lowered in defeat from one corner of the arena, as triumphant sunflower bouquets showered down from another.</p> 
                  <p>Lei took in the sights and sounds as she walked the arena, steaming basket in both hands. Usually, she parked the cart outside to cook buns while her daughter worked the crowd, but the scamp had run off to “scope out the competition at the exhibition matches.” She’d suspiciously taken enough to feed both her and her two friends, and she’d been gone for hours. Now, Lei was selling buns herself, but to be honest, it was a welcome change to be inside the arena even if the stairs were doing a number on her knees. </p> 
                  <p>“Speaking of, if you want to <em>not</em> feel that in the morning, that last match was sponsored by Plum Rain’s plum wine! For a deluge of flavor and a clear-sky taste, try Plum Rain today!” the announcer chirped as attendants ran out to sweep the arena and recover the few remaining non-vaporized pieces of the Taiga Tyrant’s spear.</p> 
                  <p>“Auntie! Two char siu, two black sugar! Make it fast!” a young man in a feathered hat, clearly a merchant, called from a small throng around a nearby railing. As Lei ambled over, her eye caught on a pile of coins, and next to it, a bespectacled priest with a ledger and slate. Wagers on the tournament, then. She opened her basket and passed out the orders, collecting a few blade-shaped coins in payment.</p> 
                  <p>“Fancy a bet?” the young merchant asked.</p> 
                  <p>Lei didn’t usually indulge, but she caught a glance of the next two contestants readying themselves. In one corner a lean Vudrani monk in blue performed a series of warm-up stretches, and in the other, a young green-clad warrior paced back and forth. Lei took a closer look and played the match out in her mind. Why not? “Blue holds upper hand for seven moves, then Green wins in three.” Lei put down the coins she’d just collected on the railing. </p> 
                  <p>The merchant laughed into his bun. “Maybe you’ve been too busy baking to actually catch the fights, but that guy’s been trouncing his competition all day. The girl’s just some initiate out of Indapatta, not even fully graduated. I couldn’t possibly take such a bet from someone of your...” He looked at Lei’s stained apron, “...means.”</p> 
                  <p>Well, no mercy then. The baker dumped her earnings for the day out onto the railing. “Three <em>consecutive</em>.”</p> 
                  <p>The merchant closed his mouth, opened it, and elected to take a bite instead. “You know what, it’s your coin. I meet and accept whatever odds the Ministry sees suitable. Witness?”</p> 
                  <p>The priest nodded. “The Ministry of Numbers and Fortune recognizes this wager and sets eight-to-one odds for the skilled baker, pursuant Article 3.51.01 of the Gambling Code. By Abadar’s gaze, the deal is sealed.” The Ministry’s judgement was as impartial as it was absolute.</p> 
                  <p>The peppy human megaphone floating above the arena clapped her hands. “Ladies and gentlemen, now that the staff has finished disarming the ice snares from that last match—at least, most of them, I think—it’s about time to make like a sky chariot and get this show on the air! Contestants, take your places, and let fate guide your fists!”</p> 
                  <p>“Ready?”</p> 
                  <p>Lei smiled. By the end of the day, she’d be sitting in a fine hotel room overlooking the bay, with one of those luxurious balcony baths to soak her knee in.</p> 
                  <p>“Fight!”</p>

                  </div> 
                  <p>The man let out a roar and opened his fingers into a clawlike form before leaping forward.</p> 
                  <p>“Southern Panther,” Lei and the merchant muttered in unison, before their eyes met with a smile. It was always nice when the competition knew their stuff. The monk blazed his way across the ground, and the other warrior barely blocked the strike, catching a slash across the cheekbone. He followed up with a swift flurry of attacks, and the initiate didn’t fare much better, barely turning away each.</p> 
                  <p>“Two moves to Blue.”</p> 
                  <p>“He has the advantage in speed,” the merchant said, and Lei didn’t argue—the girl was outclassed. She tried some sort of spinning backhand, but her opponent ducked easily and whirled around before delivering a series of palm strikes that shone with silver light.</p> 
                  <p>“Moves three and four to Blue.”</p> 
                  <p>“Good qi control as well,” the merchant observed. </p> 
                  <p>“Coating his strikes for extra impact,” Lei agreed.</p> 
                  <p>The girl leapt in the air to try a kick, but the monk brought his silvered fists together, releasing the energy in a ripple that blasted upward and caught the initiate in the jaw. Her momentum halted, he sent her reeling back with an uppercut. From there, it was simple for him to knock her to the ground with a sweeping kick of his own.</p> 
                  <p>“Five, six, and seven to Blue.”</p> 
                  <p>Rather than pressing the attack on a downed opponent, though, he waited. One of those warriors’ codes, no doubt. The initiate’s chest rose and fell once, and Lei felt like she could hear it even over the crowd’s roar. </p> 
                  <p>“He shouldn’t have let her catch her breath,” Lei said, leaning forward in her seat.</p> 
                  <p>“What’s the harm?”</p> 
                  <p>The girl in green leapt up, full of energy once more, like she hadn’t just spent the last minute knocked about by one of the top fighters on the continent. She swung, and though the monk brought his arm up, her fist accelerated mid-hook, snaking around his guard like a leaf on the wind. She connected with his jaw, driving him twenty paces back, to wild cheers.</p> 
                  <p>“You said some school in Indapatta? That uniform’s the Academy of Golden Arms, and that’s their signature technique—cycling their breath through their organs to generate elemental energy. Air brings… speed and flexibility, I believe.” Lei suppressed a smile. “You’re probably too young to remember the last time there was Golden Arm in the tournament.”</p> 
                  <p>“After seven moves in Blue’s favor, one to Green.”</p> 
                  <p>The monk had regained his footing, but the other warrior raised her fist and wind spiraled. Another exhalation brought an eruption of lightning, crackling and splitting into four strands that shot in each cardinal direction. The electricity speared toward the audience, but it crashed against transparent walls of power cast by the Grand Judge herself, Hao Jin. The audience gasped, and for one great moment, tens of thousands in the Grand Arena—young and old, from all across Golarion, many not even sharing a language—were united as their attention hung in this one moment.</p> 
                  <p>This… <em>this</em> was why Lei loved the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. Not for the fights, not for the fun, not even for the business it brought her little food cart. This.</p> 
                  <p>The lightning spears converged into a single great lance pointed at the monk, who crossed his bracers and met the attack valiantly. Sparks splashed about him, and the glow around his wrists betrayed that his focus was now solely on defense. The blast pushed him back even as he defended, and his foot slipped ever so slightly on the sand. His center of balance tipped.</p> 
                  <p>“Two to Green.” The merchant wiped his brow.</p> 
                  <p>As the storm abated and the monk moved to correct his footing and resume his attack, his opponent snapped her hand back with a gasp of power. A pulse, and the monk’s arms—or rather, his bracers—jerked toward her, and with no grounded stance, there was precious little to stop him from flying forward. </p> 
                  <p>“Our initiate’s lightning technique has magnetized the bracers on our silent, handsomely chiseled fighter, and she’s drawing him closer at extreme speed!” the announcer blathered. “I wonder if she’ll teach me that in time for ballroom season!”</p> 
                  <p>The girl planted her feet, twisted her hips, and drove her fist forward with all her might, delivering a single punch to the monk’s sternum as he flew into her at breakneck speed.</p> 
                  <p>The match was over.</p> 
                  <p>“Seven moves at Blue’s advantage, followed by victory in three consecutive by Green. The baker has it.” The magistrate’s fingers moved on an imaginary abacus before he swiftly divided out all but a tiny portion of the coins and passed them to Lei. The merchant stared slack-jawed. Lei opened her basket, and seeing there was only one bun left, she put it in the merchant’s mouth before scooping his money in—it was the least she could do.</p> 
                  <p>She turned out of the arena. She’d close up a bit early today, and tomorrow, she and her daughter would take the day off to catch some matches from a proper arena seat. </p> 
                  <p>Now, to see about that hotel room, the one with the balcony bath.</p>

                  <h3>About the Cast</h3> 
                  <h4>Troy Lavallee</h4> 
                  <p>Troy Lavallee is the co-founder and CEO of The Glass Cannon Network. His adventures in role-playing began in the mid-90s with Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition. After a 20 year hiatus from tabletop gaming, his love for the hobby was furiously rekindled when introduced to Pathfinder in 2011. After receiving an MFA in Acting from Columbia University in 2003, Troy spent the better part of two decades pounding the pavement as an actor, writer, producer and stand-up comedian in New York City. The Glass Cannon Network was born out of a love not only for gaming but for using the collaborative nature of RPGs to create epic serialized stories that have the potential to rival anything on Network television. Troy is the primary Gamemaster for the Network but also plays several characters on their Patreon exclusive shows considered both highly entertaining and GM nightmares that would never be allowed in home games. You can follow Troy on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/troylavallee/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/troylavallee" target="_blank">Twitter</a> at @troylavallee</p> 
                  <h4>Noura Ibrahim</h4> 
                  <p>Noura is an actor and live streamer. She has played Jahan in the mobile app game Ingress by Niantic Labs (makers of Pokemon Go!) and has made worldwide in-character appearances at Anomaly events. As a live steamer, you can find her playing Nahara on the new official Dungeons and Dragons show Black Dice Society. Noura is best known for her role as Ib on the Vampire The Masquerade chronicle LA By Night, as well as Ezmerelda D’Avenir on Realmsmith’s Curse of Strahd campaign Into The Mist. She appears as Jasmine on the all Princess D&amp;D show Damsels, Dice and Everything Nice on Pixel Circus, and as Nox Arya on Cyberpunk Red GM’ed by Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith. She can also occasionally be found streaming Call of Cthulhu, World of Darkness, and other ttrpg systems on QueueTimes, The Glass Cannon Network, and Stream of Blood. Noura earned her black belt in Kuk Sool Won while living in South Korea where she also studied horseback riding and became a member of The Korean Archers Association …because who doesn’t want to be a real life action hero?</p> 
                  <h4>Alica Marie</h4> 
                  <p>"TTRPG Addict" Alicia Marie is a costume artist and designer, author (The Booty Bible), accessibility awareness advocate and fitness pro who turned her love of super-physiques, comic books, video game and fantasy art into a creative career. Most known for her classic costume nods to Mortal Kombat, Star Trek and Marvel superheros, Alicia, who calls herself a “compulsive maker,” creates character looks for media companies like Warner Brothers, Netflix, Amazon Prime and for game developers like Netherrealm (Mortal Kombat) and Gearbox (Borderlands). She has also designed character looks for celebrity clients such as platinum recording artist Megan Thee Stallion and WWE superstar Ronda Rousey. Alicia is the physical inspiration for some of the fighting characters you see in popular video games. In May, she was introduced as a playable character in Sony Interactive/Illfonic’s new game PREDATOR: Hunting Grounds. Alicia, who likes to refer to herself as “walking technology” or a “cyborg” following cochlear implant surgery to restore her ability to hear speech and sound, is also a voice for accessibility for the deaf and hard-of hearing. When she isn’t working on a new costume-look, you can find Alicia at the gym, or of course, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons or other RPG systems LIVE on Twitch. You can follow Alicia on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/AliciaMarieBODY/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AliciaMarieBODY" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aliciamariebody?lang=en" target="_blank">TikTok</a> at @AliciaMarieBODY</p> 
                  <h4>Skid Maher</h4> 
                  <p>Skid has been nerding it up since 1982, when his uncle Sinclair gifted him the Basic D&amp;D set (the Tom Moldvay edition) for his ninth birthday. It was all downhill from there, as he subsequently dabbled in such classic games as Champions, Gamma World, Judge Dredd RPG, Ghostbusters RPG, Robotech RPG, Top Secret, Tunnels and Trolls, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RPG (before it was a stupid cartoon), Middle Earth Role-Playing, Beyond the Supernatural, Twilight 2000, Price of Freedom, Mechwarrior, and Traveller. Nowadays he spends most of his time developing gaming and media projects with the Mozzlestead production company, and obsessively watching Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings. He also had a letter read on Late Night with David Letterman, and was briefly a very minor celebrity on Japanese TV. Oh, and once he saw a blimp.</p> 
                  <h4>Joe O’Brien</h4> 
                  <p>Joe O’Brien is the Co-Founder and COO of the Glass Cannon Network. He began playing Pathfinder in 2011 and has a special place in his nerd heart for the systems and the adventures published by Paizo. On the Glass Cannon Network, Joe has been the GM for Pathfinder Society Scenarios, and a Pathfinder Second Edition conversion of The Emerald Spire Superdungeon. Currently, you can hear him as a player on The Glass Cannon Podcast, Raiders of the Lost Continent, and Legacy of the Ancients, all playing Pathfinder First Edition Adventure Paths. You can also catch him on Twitch or YouTube as a cast member on Androids &amp; Aliens (an official Starfinder Actual Play), Glass Cannon Live!, New Game, Who Dis? (Cyberpunk Red, Alien RPG (Game Mother), Call of Cthulhu), and Blood &amp; Blades: The Tin Whistles (a shared-universe tabletop experience playing Blades in the Dark produced by Stream of Blood). He is the Handler on Get in the Trunk, a Delta Green Actual Play Podcast Series produced by the Glass Cannon Network. He is excited to work directly with several members of the Paizo team on this project who, over the years, have consistently reinforced the respect and admiration he has for the love that goes into their work. He hopes to one day play in a Pathfinder game where, in a pivotal moment, with his companions relying on him, he can roll anything above a 5. He won’t hold his breath, though. For Highbury!</p> 
                  <p>Don’t miss the first <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/standalone/pfOneShots">Pathfinder One-Shot: Sundered Waves</a> adventure and the liveplay.</p> 
                  <p>We’re excited to see you all on Saturday, May 29 at 6 p.m. Pacific at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">twitch.tv/officialpaizo</a>!</p>

                  <p>The Shrine tiles are dedicated to Pathfinder Deities who are watching the heroes’ struggles in the Arena. Heroes can increase their charisma and reach a Shrine Tile to be the chosen of such Deities. Each Deity grants a different bonus.</p> 
                  <p>The next important update concerns the monsters’ cards of the core set. We showed in the last update all the eighteen miniatures finished and now their profiles are ready too. </p> 
                  <p>Each monster can have a close and a ranged attack. If a monster takes by surprise a hero, its damages’ output increase dramatically. The most powerful monsters have special abilities, allowing them to reach heroes even behind a corner or a wall, regenerate themselves, destroy heroes’ objects. You can see all the monsters’ cards and the Shrine Tiles <a href="https://www.giochiunitiinternational.com/pathfinder-arena/">in the Official Page</a> of the project. </p> 
                  <p>In the last update we shared the news of the second survey aimed to the community: twelve monsters were voted to be included in the second expansion. Here are the winners of each tier:</p> 
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                   <li>Tier1: Goblin Pyro (a group of 2-3 miniatures)</li> 
                   <li>Tier 2: Gargoyle</li> 
                   <li>Tier 3: Nightmare</li> 
                   <li>Tier 4: Mummy Pharaoh</li> 
                  </ul> 
                  <p>One last survey is now online and it is on our Day1 bonus. Once the crowdfunding campaign will kick-off, the day 1 backers will get one amazing miniature of a Dragon for free and it is up to you choose which one!</p> 
                  <p>The possibilities are: Young Red Dragon, Young Black Dragon, Young Blue Dragon, Young Green Dragon</p> 
                  <p>Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/403722200813208">Facebook group</a> to vote for your favorite dragon and your future day1 bonus!</p> 
                  <p>The crowdfunding date is yet to be determined, as well as the platform hosting it.

These are something of a test for us, as they’re converted internally (rather than by someone at Foundry Virtual Tabletop) and are hosted here on the Paizo store. Let us know how the process works and what other premium content you’d like to see and we’ll build out a plan to expand our offerings.</p> 
                  <p>We’re continuing to look into our options for getting more accessories like item cards, pawn/token sets, and other products you’ve all come to expect from both Pathfinder and Starfinder onto our various VTT partners’ stores, so let us know what you want to see and we’ll try to make it happen.</p> 
                  <p>Regardless of how much longer we’re all living under the restrictions of the pandemic, VTTs are here to stay, and we want to make it as easy as possible for you to enjoy our many Pathfinder and Starfinder products on them for years to come.</p>

                  <p><b>By Vanessa Hoskins</b></p> 
                  <h3>Zhang Yong, Spirit Tender</h3> 
                  <p itemprop="description">In the great fighting tournaments across Tian Xia, a competitor will occasionally perish in the heat of battle. Sometimes their lust for battle, desire to win, or enduring competitive spirit lingers, often resulting in a haunting. When this happens, it’s up to a ghost eater to defeat the lingering soul to send it to the afterlife.</p> 
                  <p>Ten years ago, during the previous Ruby Phoenix Tournament, Yong was a boy of 13 years working as a water carrier, though he dreamed of one day fighting in the tournament and making a name for himself, especially to set him apart from his many accomplished human, orc, and half-orc cousins. Yong imagined showing the world his skill, determination, and fierce grasp on life and excelling at something all his own. That very grasp saved his life when an errant undead specter disrupted a match, tearing through the ringside where Yong was carrying water. Though he was gravely injured in the incident, Yong was brought into the care of the tournament’s resident ghost eater and, from her, learned how to fight the corruption of lingering souls.</p> 
                  <p>Now, Yong is one of the tournament’s most renown ghost eaters, tasked with cleansing any haunts, ghosts, or spiritual phenomena that remain after a particularly grueling battle. Though he sometimes shudders at the memory of that terrifying day ten years ago, through sheer determination, he carries on, finding that in guiding these souls to rest, he’s found not just a way to purge the ghosts of his own past, but a rare talent as a spirit tender, one all his own.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/49996c94-6839-45cb-a766-eb7d66beb5a4/042321_ZhangYong.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/49996c94-6839-45cb-a766-eb7d66beb5a4/042321_ZhangYong.jpg" align="left" width="450" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A male half-orc is dressed in silken robes and has his leg and arm raised in a martial arts pose, the glow of a mystical force surrounding his rag-wrapped foot.]"></a>

If he critically failed on the triggering saving throw, he also takes 2d6 persistent mental damage and cannot use this ability again while taking persistent mental damage.</p> 
                  <p><b>Speed</b> 45</p> 
                  <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action] soul strike +23 (agile, finesse, nonlethal, unarmed), Damage 2d8+14 bludgeoning (plus 1d6 lawful against chaotic targets)</p> 
                  <p><b>Ranged</b> [one-action] greater ghost charge +23 (range 10 feet, thrown), Damage 3d8 positive plus 3 positive splash damage</p> 
                  <p><b>Disrupting Strikes</b> [one-action] Yong calls forth positive energy from within to help him destroy undead. His weapons and unarmed Strikes gain the effects of a <em>greater disrupting</em> property rune until the start of his next turn (DC 31).</p> 
                  <p><b>Reach Beyond</b> Yong has learned to move his spiritual energy past himself to attack spirits where others can’t. He can make melee Strikes against incorporeal creatures that are inside solid objects as long as the object is within his reach. An incorporeal creature inside of a solid object is hidden, requiring him to succeed at a DC 11 flat check when he targets it. He can spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to focus on a creature inside of a solid object. If he does, the next melee Strike he makes this turn requires him to succeed at only a DC 6 flat check to affect the creature.</p> 
                  <p><b>Soul Dance Stance</b> [one-action] Yong begins a stance that aligns him with the River of Souls, allowing him to make soul strike attacks that seem almost incorporeal. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. Soul strikes treat cover against living and incorporeal undead targets as degree less severe (greater cover becomes standard cover, standard cover becomes lesser cover, and lesser cover is ignored).</p> 
                  <h4>Plot Hooks</h4> 
                  <p>Game Masters can use the following plot hooks to integrate Zhang Yong into their ongoing Pathfinder campaigns.</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>The players’ competitors could be having trouble with a particularly powerful haunt or ghost disrupting a practice space and wish to seek Yong’s aid to purge it.</li> 
                   <li>The competitors hear of Yong’s childhood trauma, and how those memories cause him distress today. They may wish to help the young man face those fears and move past the pain.</li> 
                   <li>The ghost of Yong’s former master has risen for this decade’s Ruby Phoenix Tournament, thinking she is still the head ghost eater. Yong is having trouble facing his old master alone and seeks the players’ competitors for guidance and assistance sending his old master safely to Pharasma’s court.</li>

                  <p itemprop="description">With <a href="http://www.paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online</a> coming up and Year 3 on the horizon, we thought we’d take a moment to talk about how to create a Pathfinder Society character and show you the different options available to players. I’ve got my friends “Zonya” and “Minda” here to help me out; any resemblance to actual persons with whom I work is purely coincidental, I <em>assure</em> you.</p> 
                  <p>For this blog, we’ll be following the steps outlined in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook">Pathfinder Core Rulebook</a> as well as the <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Character-Creation">Character Creation section of the Guide to Organized Play</a>. </p> 
                  <h3>Available Character Options</h3> 
                  <p>Pathfinder uses a system of rarity to describe how widespread its rules options are in the game world. When building your character, be sure to check the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options page</a>, which describes how this rarity system applies in Pathfinder Society. This page lists all of the books that have rules you can use for your character, and details which rules are available to you. It also provides some rules clarifications and other useful information. </p> 
                  <p>The Character Options page also lists the rules for owning copies of the books. Generally, in order to use options from a book outside the Core Sources (the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, <em>Pathfinder Bestiary</em> and the <em>Lost Omens World Guide</em>), you must own the book where the option is published. However, playing some adventures grants boons that let you use the options from that adventure without owning the book.</p> 
                  <p>Many Uncommon or Rare options require a boon which can either be earned as a result of playing a particular adventure or purchasing the boon with Achievement Points. Players/GMs earn Achievement Points every time they play/run a game; if you’re looking for a quick way to boost your AcP, join games at conventions, which grant bonus AcP. Games run at a local game store or other event may also grant this bonus; check with the event’s organizer to see if they qualify.</p>

                  <h3>Creating a Concept</h3> 
                  <p>Each of our three players have arrived at their concepts differently. You can start wherever you like to find a concept: pick a class or ancestry you’d like to try, a spell or ability you want to build around, or just find inspiration in another fictional character!</p> 
                  <p><b>Zonya</b> is a seasoned Pathfinder Society (first edition) player, and wants to make the jump to second edition to play with her friends. She knows she wants to play a typical Pathfinder who upholds the core tenets of the Society: Explore, Report and Cooperate.</p> 
                  <p><b>Alex</b> recently picked up the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide">Advanced Player’s Guide</a> and is enamored by the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=14" target="_blank">Oracle</a> options. He thinks they’re fun and full of flavor and looks forward to playing up the curse drawbacks. He also has a ton of Achievement Points, which he earned from playing and GMing Pathfinder Society games, so he’s looking to spend some of them on some options.</p> 
                  <p><b>Minda</b> only plays <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=14" target="_blank">leshys</a>, it’s sort of her staple. Looking through the new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide"><em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em></a>, she sees the art of the fruit leshy and decides she wants to use it as inspiration.</p> 
                  <h3>The ABCs of Character Building</h3> 
                  <p>Next, our players are going to select their ABCs: Ancestry, Background and Class. These are the basic building blocks of any character; more information can be found in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. </p> 
                  <p>Zonya had an orc character she loved to play in Pathfinder Society (First Edition), so she’s going to build his daughter using the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=8">half-orc heritage</a>. To build for exploration, she decides this character is a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=9">ranger</a> with an <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/AnimalCompanions.aspx">animal companion</a>, with an eye to taking the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1292">Ferocious Beasts</a> feat later. She’s also considering the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=13">Pathfinder Agent Archetype</a> for second level, to signify the character’s devotion to the Pathfinder Society. It is an Uncommon archetype, but she sees it’s legal for all characters on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. For the background, she considers <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=20">Herbalist</a>, but eventually settles on <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=32">Scout</a>, deciding that as a Strength-based ranger, she wants to spend more time ahead of the group in case of an ambush.</p> 
                  <p>Alex is looking through the <a href="https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs">Boons section</a> of his My Organized Play page, and decides that the time has come to purchase his <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=17">Catfolk Ancestry boon</a>. He registers the new character and purchases the boon, downloading a copy to save for his records. As a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Mysteries.aspx?ID=5">Flames Mystery Oracle</a>, this character is looking to have excellent Reflex saves and Acrobatics, so he decides to lean into that, taking the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=2315">Catfolk Dance feat</a> and the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Heritages.aspx?ID=92">Flexible Catfolk Heritage</a>. For Background, he goes with the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=2">Acrobat</a> background, flavoring this character as a former performer who blended their flames and acrobatic prowess to entertain the crowds.</p> 
                  <p>Minda is very familiar with the process to purchase the Leshy Ancestry boon from her <a href="https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs">Boons page</a>, and can practically do it in her sleep. Because <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Heritages.aspx?ID=100">fruit leshys</a> produce fruit which heals, she decides to make them a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=5">Cleric</a> to focus on healing. She’d love to worship a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=221">Green Man</a>, but unfortunately <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a> isn’t available yet on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. Instead, she decides her deity is <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=8">Gozreh</a>. A character can be fully rebuilt until they’re played at level 2, so if Bestiary 3 is sanctioned soon, she might switch! As a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Doctrines.aspx?ID=2">Cloistered Cleric</a>, she gains the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=265">Domain Initiate Feat</a> so she can get <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=467">Vibrant Thorns</a> from the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Domains.aspx?ID=22">Nature domain</a>; it’s an Uncommon Spell, but the Feat grants her access.</p> 
                  <p>The three players finish filling out their character sheets and purchase equipment following the steps in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. At this point, they have complete Pathfinder characters, but Pathfinder Society adds a couple of extra choices to make prior to your first game.</p> 
                  <h3>Society Training and Factions</h3> 
                  <p>To represent a character’s involvement with the Society, each character selects a <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Character-Creation#Membership_in_the_Pathfinder_Society">Pathfinder Training option</a>. These options provide <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Player-Basics#Table_4-1_School_Consumables">additional consumables</a> at the beginning of each scenario, or in the case of a Field Commissioned agent, additional Downtime after each scenario.</p> 
                  <p>Zonya’s half-orc ranger heard about the Society in stories from her parents growing up. As a result, Zonya decides to reflect this by taking the Scrolls training, which grants Pathfinder Society Lore. She also plans to get some good use out of the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=90"><em>eagle-eye elixir</em></a> she’ll get for free each scenario.</p> 
                  <p>Alex goes back and forth, but eventually elects to make his catfolk oracle a Field Commissioned agent. This will give him more Downtime to Earn Income with his Circus Lore, and he takes the Mercantile Lore as his bonus. </p> 
                  <p>Minda trains her leshy cleric with the Spells school, figuring that there’s never a wrong time to have an extra scroll of <em>heal</em> on hand, just in case. She takes the Herbalism Lore the school offers as well.</p> 
                  <p><a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.The-World-of-Golarion#Factions">Factions</a> represent special interests within the Pathfinder Society. Characters don’t have to choose just one faction; at the beginning of each session, you’ll choose what faction to champion and earn reputation for at that table. Still, it’s good to look over the factions and pick the one you’ll likely spend the most time representing.</p> 
                  <p>For our three sample characters, Zonya chooses the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/factions/horizon-hunters">Horizon Hunters</a> for her ranger and Minda naturally chooses the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/factions/verdant-wheel">Verdant Wheel</a> for her leshy. Alex is unsure, as none of the Factions feel perfectly correct, so he’ll take the opportunity to let his character meet the faction leaders in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01znb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-101-The-Absalom-Initiation"><em>PFS #1-01: The Absalom Initiation</em></a> or the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s8?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-2-United-in-Purpose"><em>PFS Intro #2: United in Purpose</em></a>. Until then, he’ll take the default option of the Horizon Hunters.</p> 
                  <hr width="50%"> 
                  <p>And that’s it! Our three players now have new Pathfinder Society characters, in no time at all! Have any other tips for character building in PFS, or do you have a cool new build you’re looking forward to fleshing out? Share them below!</p> 
                  <p>If you’re looking for more information on how to get involved with the Pathfinder Society, contact your local <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/regions">Regional Venture Coordinator</a>, who can get you connected with the local lodge in your area.</p>

                <p>And now, let’s talk about Year 3’s “season finale.” You all knew it was coming, right? The Vast Experiment series follows the Society’s bid to commission a new generation of starships. On the brink of achieving this goal, the Exo-Guardians and Wayfinders launch a co-op mission to travel to a distant settlement near a deactivated Drift Beacon. The Starfinders find themselves walking into a trap set by a mysterious enemy. Does the Starfinder Society stand on the edge of destruction?

                 <p>Our PaizoCon Europe organizers are hard at work putting together the schedule for the event! As a reminder, this convention will see the premiere of Pathfinder Society Year 3, so you’ll definitely want to check it out. Schedule, registration information, and a call for GMs will be available shortly, so keep an eye here for breaking news!</p> 
                 <h3>Gen Con / Gen Con Online (September 17-19)</h3> 
                 <p>While we wait for details from Gen Con on the full plan for this event, the organizing committee are busy making plans behind the scenes and the organized play developers are full steam ahead on shenanigans. Gen Con and Gen Con Online will see the premiere of our new interactive specials for the year, PFS2 3-99 and SFS 3-99, a set of interconnected specials where the actions taken in one affect the outcome of the other. More details on these specials will be released soon!</p> 
                 <p>The Gen Con Organizing Committee has also put together a GM Interest form, found below. Please note that this form is <b>NOT</b> a GM signup form; filling it out does not guarantee you a spot to GM, nor does it commit you to anything yet. That form will come later, this is just to gauge GM interest in both the physical and online event. Take a few minutes to fill it out if you’re interested in running games in any form!</p>

                 <p>Our current schedule has PAX Unplugged in December marked as our final major convention of the year. We’ll be looking for details as the event approaches and we’ll keep you all posted as we know more. Our Monthly Update blogs always feature a list of upcoming conventions, so keep checking in for local events featuring Paizo Organized Play!</p>

                 <p>Hey there, my name is Fred Van Lente, and I’m thrilled to join the Paizo community by writing the <b>Pathfinder: Fumbus</b> one-shot comic book currently (or about to be)<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dynamiteent/pathfinder-fumbus?ref=project_link" target="_blank"> Kickstarted</a>. I’m best known for writing comics like <b>Amazing Spider-Man</b>, <b>Marvel Zombies</b>, <b>Archer &amp; Armstrong</b>, <b>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</b>, <b>Action Philosophers</b> (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eviltwinco/action-philosophers-vol-1-hooked-on-classics" target="_blank">currently in a Kickstarter for a color version itself</a>), but my very first published book was an RPG supplement for <b>Call of Cthulhu</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4449292-the-new-orleans-guidebook" target="_blank">The New Orleans Guidebook</a>, so it’s been very cool to come back to my roleplaying roots. </p> 
                 <p>I am a pretty avid TTRPGer myself. I’ve got a monthly game I run and I’m in a weekly group where we rotate the games and gamemastering duties. (Both currently Zoom-based, alas.) <b>Pathfinder</b> is one of the systems I’ve most enjoyed playing; in this photo I am with Rhys, my sea elf druid who made it to 7th level in the <b>Skulls &amp; Shackles</b> campaign. This watercolor I’m holding was painted by my fellow player and accomplished cartoonist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/worldwidecox/?hl=en">Alex Cox</a>. Hey Paizo, you ever need another iconic druid, I submit this handsome lad for your approval. </p> 
                 <div class="blurbCenter">
                  <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/99082417-7e18-4877-abbc-544a13beb034/041421_FVLWithPathfinderPC.jpg"><img style="width:80%" hspace="10" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/99082417-7e18-4877-abbc-544a13beb034/041421_FVLWithPathfinderPC.jpg" alt="Fred Van Lente posing with an illustration of his Pathfinder Player Character"></a>
                 </div> 
                 <br> 
                 <p>We also ran <b>We Be Goblins!</b> in my weekly group (I was Chuffy Lickwound, whose face might make you sick, but whose knife is awful quick) so it was cool to bring to life Fumbus, everyone’s favorite goblin alchemist, in a new adventure that is the next installment of the long-running Pathfinder comics series—but you don’t need to be familiar with the previous adventures of Seoni, Merisiel, Valeros and friends to enjoy this one. And in addition to the graphic novella itself, there’s a lot of neat new playable goodies* in the back of the book for all your goblin alchemy needs. </p> 
                 <p>So, if that sounds like something you’d be into, head over to the Kickstarter campaign and pledge! And once again, happy to be here—thanks for having me. </p> 
                 <p>*Character options in Pathfinder: Fumbus were made by Paizo and are pre-approved for use with the Pathfinder Society Organized Play program!</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p itemprop="description">I’m sorry, but that painting isn’t for sale. This particular item I’m keeping for myself.</p> 
                 <p>Why, you ask? Well, there’s certainly worse ways to spend a rainy afternoon than in sharing a story with friends like you, so if you’ve got the time to listen, I can tell you a little bit about Crookcove, the Xarwins, and the house in that painting.</p> 
                 <p>I’ve got my own reasons to be interested in the place. There, you see? At the top of the manor? A dome. A rotunda. An observatory. I’ve had dreams of converting that manor’s observatory into a temple, a place where anyone can come to observe the wonders of the Cosmic Caravan. But there’s a problem. The manor itself is located at the remote southwestern corner of Ravounel, and its ownership is kind of a tangled mess, one made worse by Ravounel’s secession from Cheliax. No one seems to know who rightfully owns the place. There was a sort of incident long ago, back when it was part of Cheliax, and the Chelish practice of redactions did a number on the legal documents that hold the building’s fate.</p> 
                 <p>Doesn’t help that Crookcove’s so far off the beaten path, or that the government’s still got its hands full with more important things involving keeping their independence, or that the closest point of civilization is so many miles away.</p> 
                 <p>Oh, and it certainly doesn’t help that they place is haunted.</p> 
                 <p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p> 
                 <p>The town itself wasn’t called Crookcove at first. It was founded by hellknights—the Order of the Gate, to be precise—as a staging ground for the initial construction of Citadel Enferac, way back in 4599. They called it “Crooked Cove,” on account of the shape of the cove itself. Hellknights aren’t the most creative folks. In any event, Enferac’s construction isn’t the story I’m telling.</p> 
                 <p>The hellknights abandoned their presence in Crooked Cove a few years after it was founded, and for a handful of decades, the town was left to its own devices. The locals made a fair living for themselves continuing to tend the mines and lumber operations the hellknights started, but it wasn’t until the Thrunies took over the nation that Crooked Cove attracted outside attention once again.</p> 
                 <p>In the days following the end of the Chelish Civil War, House Thrune began appointing minions into positions of power throughout the nation. Most saw Ravounel as something of a backwater, but not so a certain minor nobleman named Ioseff Xarwin. Details on how he managed to secure the title of paracount are unclear, but what remains a matter of record (in the few records you can find that aren’t redacted to the point of illegibility) is that he was granted Crooked Cove as his seat of power.</p> 
                 <p>Crooked Cove had been largely untouched by the war, and according to my research, the locals were initially wary of this new paracount and of the sprawling mansion he’d started constructing on a bluff just outside town, but it wasn’t long before their opinions changed. The people of Crooked Cove soon came to value the influx of protection and support having a paracount provided, especially since Ioseff allowed the townsfolk to largely retain their traditions and independence. He saw to the construction of a church of Asmodeus, a tavern, a set of piers built around a town hall that doubled as a shipyard, and a smelting house to support the town’s trade, and in the span of a decade, Crooked Cove grew into a modestly successful mining concern, and as long as the iron, lead, and copper in the hills north of town continued to flow, Ioseff Xarwin left the townsfolk to their own designs. In return, the flow of tax money and exports to Cheliax’s heartland continued to guarantee Xarwin’s privacy.</p>

                 </div> 
                 <p>As a result of this pursuit for privacy, further details were tough to track down, but I was able to determine that Xarwin hadn’t chosen the site of his home idly. In one fragmentary letter I regrettably wasn’t able to make copies of (and that was one of countless documents lost in a fire a few months later), Xarwin himself hints that his “dreams were instrumental in selecting the site, for the views of the night skies above seem particularly inspiring.” He also mentioned in his letter that his “observatory’s construction has surpassed all expectations.”</p> 
                 <p>I did a bit more digging and learned that Ioseff had a family as well—a wife and twin children. His wife, Asethanna, was something of a well-known sculptor and painter, and by all accounts the family lived their first many years in Crooked Cove in peace. But that didn’t last. Something happened a decade and a half later. Again, details are hard to come by, but from what little I’ve been able to piece together, the marriage crumbled from within. Ioseff became more and more obsessed with his astronomical observations, while Asethanna’s art started to grow darker and more sinister in theme.</p> 
                 <p>It all came to a sudden end in 4657. Story goes that Asethanna fled the manor one night with the twins, and that Xarwin grew increasingly hostile and deranged. He let none visit his manor, and forbade the house servants from setting foot off the manor grounds—at least, according to the account of one such servant who claimed to have escaped from the manor. This unnamed servant apparently begged for the local authorities to intervene, but they had no time to act on his claims. The weather turned violent, with storms and floods devastating the town. And it didn’t stop with violent weather. The people themselves turned violent as well. Nightmares plagued the townsfolk when they slept, and when they woke the nightmares pursued them in the form of brutality, cruelty, and suicide. It wasn’t long before the townsfolk pulled up stakes and abandoned the place. Some say it was the storm that damaged the town’s sign, others claim it was the last citizen to flee who vandalized it, but to this day, those rare few who visit the place are greeted by a sign welcoming them to “Crookcove.”</p> 
                 <p>That’s about it, I’m afraid. Other than stories of bad dreams by those rare few who stayed the night in the region over the past several years, and some likely apocryphal tales of people vanishing entirely after daring to enter Xarwin Manor itself, there’s little more to learn about the place. There’s apparently no surviving heirs to the Xarwin estate, and with Ravounel’s secession from Cheliax, the building’s been in government escrow, pending whatever steps they need to take to unravel its legal status. The manor itself is the only structure still standing in the region, with little more than hollow shells of structures hinting at what was once a bustling mining town down the hill below.</p> 
                 <p>And all that brings us back to the painting.</p> 
                 <p>I started having my own dreams about Crookcove and Xarwin Manor a few weeks after I picked up this painting, in any case. I’ve learned to trust my dreams—they’re not always accurate in what they foretell, but they’re always worth paying attention to, and there’s something in these dreams in particular that compel me. Are they perhaps related to the same source of compulsive dreams that first inspired Xarwin himself to build his home there? I can’t say other than that the manor itself feels to me to be a place of power. A place of importance. A place that should be restored and watched over. I’ve been saving up since then, and one day soon I hope to be able to make the trip out to Ravounel, secure ownership of the manor myself, and restore it. To rebuild it into a shrine to the Cosmic Caravan. To find out what happened there.</p> 
                 <p>I assume that you’ve deduced by now what this painting depicts. Yes, here we see Xarwin Manor, in all its ruined glory. I’ve had the fortune to interview no fewer than four people who visited the ruins of Crookcove. None of them dared set foot in the manor proper, but they all agree that the painting is spot-on in its accuracy in capturing the gloom and menace the manor exudes today.</p> 
                 <p>The part that bothers me about it isn’t the brooding stance of the birds who seem to stand guard at the edge of the frame, or the eerie glow that rises from beyond the central dome, or the twisted reaches of the dead trees in the yard, or even the mysterious light in the upstairs window.</p> 
                 <p>The part that bothers me the most is the signature and date on the painting’s reverse. The signature of Asethanna Xarwin, dated 4653 AR, four years before whatever doom came to Xarwin Manor and left it abandoned over the ruins of a forgotten town.</p>

                 <p itemprop="description">Have you ever had a beloved family pet expire due to old age, illness, or getting hit by an errant enercycle? The Pet Revitalization Project (PRP) would like to help return your best friend back to your side.

Many will find their pets stronger, more resilient, and hardier than before revitalization; works great on guard animals!</p> 
                 <p>Though this technology was previously only available to the richest and most well connected individuals, new sources of resin and modern techniques have driven the cost of revitalization down. The PRP would like to extend these savings to you and your family. If you and your family are without the means to afford pet revitalization, the PRP has set aside a fund to aid in the swift return of your perished pet.</p> 
                 <p>Pet revitalization is only viable for a short time after a pet’s expiration without proper body preservation techniques, leading some owners to preemptively revitalize their pets, ensuring their pets will remain with them always. Don’t you want your best friend to be your best friend forever? Contact the PRP today!</p>

                 <p><b>XP 1,600</b><br> Silicon mummy squox (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em> 75, <em>Alien Archive 2</em> 118)<br> N Tiny undead<br> <b>Init</b> +5; <b>Senses</b> blindsense (scent) 30 ft., darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +11</p>

                 <p><b>STATISTICS</b><br> <b>Str</b> +2; <b>Dex</b> +5; <b>Con</b> —; <b>Int</b> –4; <b>Wis</b> +0; <b>Cha</b> +3<br> <b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +16 (+20 to balance, escape, or tumble), Athletics +11 (+19 to climb), Stealth +16<br> <b>Other Abilities</b> solar battery (1 point), unliving</p> 
                 <p><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></p> 
                 <p><b>Constructed Shell (Ex)</b> For effects targeting creatures by type, a silicon mummy counts as both a construct and as undead (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types)</p> 
                 <p><b>Silicon Casing (Ex)</b> A silicon mummy’s protective exterior and nonfunctional organs limit critical damage; the mummy has a 25% chance to ignore the extra damage dealt by a critical hit and gains a +4 bonus to saves against critical hit effects.</p> 
                 <p><b>Solar Battery (Ex)</b> A silicon mummy can absorb solar energy in the form of Solar Reserve Points (SRP), which they can spend in place of Resolve Points. For every 8 hours a silicon mummy spends exposed to the light of a star, the mummy gains 1 SRP, to a maximum number of SRPs equal to one-third their CR (1 for a mummified prophet). For every week a silicon mummy absorbs no stellar energy, they lose 1 SRP. However, the mummy can intentionally enter a state of hibernation to lose only 1 point per 20 years, and although the mummy is aware of their surroundings and can fully animate as a move action, they are staggered for 1d4 hours afterward. As a swift action, a silicon mummy can expend 1 SRP to enhance either their next melee attack, ranged attack, or spell before the end of their turn. An enhanced attack gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack roll and deals an additional 3d6 damage if it hits. An enhanced spell increases the spell’s saving throw DC by 2.</p> 
                 <p><b>Squox Tricks (Ex)</b> A squox can use Acrobatics to jump instead of Athletics. In addition, a squox can use its Acrobatics bonus as its attack bonus when it attempts a dirty trick, disarm, or trip combat maneuver. If the squox succeeds at a dirty trick maneuver, it can choose only between the entangled and off-target conditions. A squox’s tail, two front paws, and mouth count as hands free for a disarm attempt.</p> 
                 <h4>PLOT HOOKS</h4> 
                 <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating a revitalized pet into any Starfinder game.</p> 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>The PCs attempt to break into the home of a corporate executive, only to find an augmented squox guarding the interior.</li> 
                  <li>A PC takes the Squox Companion feat, but later wants to ensure their little friend can survive the rigors of higher-level combat.</li> 
                  <li>Murders in an Aballonian archology trace back to a group of silicon mummy animals, kept as house pets and guard animals that have somehow formed a telepathic network and started to attack those who would abuse them.</li> 
                 </ul>

                 <p>With PaizoCon coming up in May, this month’s blog update sees us previewing a double-dose of Pathfinder Society goodness, as we’ll be releasing May’s scenarios early for PaizoCon attendees!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6675014f-4bbe-4d8f-8375-f4e448ef66ac/040821_TheMaidofAnactoria.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6675014f-4bbe-4d8f-8375-f4e448ef66ac/040821_TheMaidofAnactoria.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" width="300" alt="The Maid of Anactoria: a mummified body laying on a stone table with a white sheet and roses over the top of them"></a>

                 <p>First off, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027l1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-217-Lost-Maid-of-Anactoria"><em>PFS 2-17: Lost Maid of Anactoria</em></a> by Scott Young has the PCs travel to the nation of Ustalav to investigate a missing “local celebrity” in a small village. There’s more to this story than meets the eye, beginning with the fact that this celebrity is a mummified bog corpse! With little time, and horrific beings stalking the village outskirts, the PCs need to pull out all the stops to solve the disappearance and return the Maid of Anactoria to her home.</p>

                 <p>Next up, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027l2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-218-The-Fanciful-March-of-Urwal"><em>PFS 2-18: The Fanciful March of Urwal</em></a> by Hilary Moon Murphy takes the PCs back to distant Iobaria to help the faction leader of the Verdant Wheel commune with a powerful force. The PCs must attend to Urwal as he enters a dangerous trance in order to reach a mysterious destination. With demonic forces arrayed against them, it’s up to the PCs to pull out all the stops to defend one of the Society’s most important leaders. Also, the ending for this scenario has a pretty shocking reveal that veterans of Pathfinder Society Organized Play won’t want to miss out on!</p>

Directly charged by the Society’s leadership, the PCs travel to Sarkoris to enlist the aid of the Godcaller Nelket and the eidolon Dolok Darkfur of the Farheaven Clan in freeing a Pathfinder leader possessed by a dark spirit. When the PCs arrive, they find Dolok in the midst of a ritual to cleanse a part of the former Worldwound, and must act quickly to protect the Farheaven Clan and complete the ritual.</p>

                 <p><b>By Chris Sims</b></p> 
                 <p itemprop="description">The Haunter of the Dark, an aspect of the chaotic evil Outer God, Nyarlathotep, whispers to its loyal servants, the grioths (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em> 40–41), that something dire has awakened in the depths of the Pact Worlds sun. An elder being long imprisoned has broken free and moves toward the realm of mortals. Reading the portents, a grioth eclipse seer named Drenrika has determined that her raiders should be on Castrovel in the city of Candares during a springtime blood moon there in order to learn more about the burgeoning evil. And so, Drenrika enacted the eldritch rituals required to open a portal to Candares during the lunar eclipse.</p> 
                 <p>Drenrika opened her gate in Candares’s Temple of the Dawnflower, an edifice almost as old as the city itself. Murderous grioth raiders mercilessly dealt with the temple’s clergy and poured into the city streets to murder and loot. They took out power substations to plunge parts of the city into darkness.</p> 
                 <p>A survivor from the temple, a damaya lashunta mystic named Syell Yllsuoda, reports that the grioth leader remains in the sanctuary, awaiting something. Taking her down might close the grioth portal and strand the raiders without hope of reinforcements or retreat. The PCs are just the force for this decisive strike.</p> 
                 <h3>Grioths in the Sanctuary — CR 8</h3> 
                 <p>After fighting through the shadowy city streets, the PCs come to the Temple of the Dawnflower. Within its sanctuary, just beyond an ancient orrery, stands a lightless portal (represented with a “P” on the map) issuing a frigid wind. This portal is a powerful magical phenomenon of the conjuration school. A PC can suppress it for 1d4 rounds with a targeted dispel magic (dispel check DC 15) plus 1d4 rounds per 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC. If Drenrika dies or retreats through the portal, it closes 1 round later. To non-grioths, this portal is like a solid plane of stone.</p>

                 <p><b>TACTICS</b></p> 
                 <p><b>During Combat</b> The grioths open with mindshock. Half the grioths engage the PCs in melee, while the other half keep aloft and mobile, engaging if their comrades fall. Their main goal is to keep the PCs off Drenrika.</p> 
                 <p><b>Morale</b> While Drenrika lives, the grioths fight to protect her. If she dies or flees, these raiders try to flee through the portal.</p>

                 <p><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></p> 
                 <p><b>Mindshock (Su)</b> Once per day as a standard action, a grioth can unleash a wave of violent psychic energy. Each non grioth creature within 30 feet takes 2d6 damage and is shaken for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 12 Will save takes half damage and negates the shaken condition. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p> 
                 <p><b>Psychotomimetic Saliva (Ex)</b> Grioth saliva is laced with psychotropic toxins that overload a victim’s neurological pathways, causing intense, rapid fire hallucinations, confusion, and violent seizures. Creatures that are immune to mind affecting effects are immune to this poison.</p> 
                 <br> 
                 <h4>Psychotomimetic Saliva</h4>

                 <p><b>During Combat</b> Drenrika flies and uses high perches to maintain distance from her attackers. She casts her spells to separate the PCs and throw their attack into chaos.

                 <h2>OPM Musings</h2> 
                 <p itemprop="description">Tonya’s busy getting ready for her vacation, so I’ve taken over her musings for the month! Do not be alarmed. Last week, Linda and I did <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2021/03/know-direction-256-the-future-of-organized-play-paizocon-2021/">an interview with Know Direction</a>, talking about the future of Organized Play and conventions this year. It was a really great time and I definitely encourage you all to watch or listen to it, but there were a few big announcements I wanted to republish here to make sure everyone sees them:</p> 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>Pathfinder Society Year 3 will premiere at <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shm9?PaizoCon-Worldwide">PaizoCon Europe Online</a>, August 19-22! In the interview we referred to this event as “an unnamed event in August,” but we’re allowed to say the name now.</li> 
                  <li>The interactive specials for Pathfinder and Starfinder Society will premiere at Gen Con, September 16-19. These interactive specials are linked specials; the events of the Pathfinder special will affect the Starfinder event, so we encourage convention organizers to schedule both. Thurston and Jenny gave our authors a great concept to work with, and we’re excited for them to tell you more!</li> 
                  <li>Finally, Linda dropped some exciting teasers for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society special at PaizoCon Online: Ron Lundeen is the author, and it’s going to give players a chance to experience a new facet of the PACS stories they’ve enjoyed over the history of the program. </li> 
                 </ul> 
                 <p>We hope you’re looking forward to what we have in store over the next few months! Convention season is nearly upon us, which is both exciting and terrifying. But enough of my rambling, let’s see what else we’ve got to announce.</p> 
                 <h2>Events</h2> 
                 <p>We hope you all enjoyed the Double Points weekend for the new Pathfinder One-Shot, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027oe?Pathfinder-OneShot-1-Sundered-Waves"><em>Sundered Waves</em></a>! We had over 150 tables reported during that release weekend and are very pleased with the response. We’re looking at our release schedule to see when our next special event of this type might be, so stay tuned to the blog for future announcements.</p> 
                 <p>Tonight at 6pm Pacific time, player signups for <a href="http://www.paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online</a> will open! Don’t forget to join the <a href="http://paizo.events/">Discord server</a>(direct link = paizo.events) for the latest news and updates. The <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-2021">PaizoCon Warhorn</a> also includes our stream schedule; you’re free to sign up as a “player” to help plan your schedule for the event.</p> 
                 <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                 <p>The big sanctioning news this month is for our Starfinders: we have a brand new <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Starfinder Society Character Options page</a>! This page updates the look to match the Pathfinder Society page and make it more user-friendly. In addition, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026jv?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-4"><em>Alien Archive 4,</em></a> is now sanctioned for play! While you will need a boon to use any of the new races to build a PC, the equipment and class options contained in the book are now available to you. You’ll also notice that we’ve expanded the Core Sources to include the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em></a>.</p> 
                 <p>On the Pathfinder side, we’re sanctioning <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationVaults"><em>Abomination Vaults</em></a> and expect to complete it in the next two weeks, but no later than the end of April. We’ll post about it when it’s done!</p> 
                 <p>Both of our Character Options pages have also added links to the errata for books which have had errata released. We hope this change will make the pages even more useful to our players. We’ll be looking at sanctioning the two One-Shots scheduled for release at PaizoCon next so that they’re ready for the event. After that, our upcoming sanctioning schedule includes the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk"><em>Devastation Ark</em> Adventure Path</a> for Starfinder, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence"><em>Malevolence</em></a> for Pathfinder, and have started working on <a href="https://paizo.com/tyrantsgrasp"><em>Tyrant’s Grasp</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/returnOfTheRunelords"><em>Return of the Runelords</em></a> for Pathfinder (first edition). </p> 
                 <h2>GM Achievements</h2> 
                 <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                 <p>Two GMs received their fifth star in the past month. We have no new 5 Nova or 5 Glyph GMs to announce.</p> 
                 <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: <em>Juan Sanchez and Andrew Torgerud</em></p> 
                 <p>Congratulations to our new 5 Star GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                 <h2>Conventions</h2> 
                 <p>In addition to PaizoCon Online, we have a number of conventions offering Pathfinder and Starfinder Society! </p>

                 <h3>Nosferotter</h3> 
                 <p>When encountering a nosferotter, take care how you proceed. They are very polite and almost charming when they ask your party to spare a skull and a few fingers, for the younglings of course. If you refuse, a romp of baby nosferotters will encircle the party. They are so small and fuzzy, quite cute in fact. What is this, nibbling on toes? Oh my, chewing on fingers… Oh dear… argh!</p> 
                 <p>Can usually be found juggling small rocks, skulls, and finger bones.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a71d65e0-c160-4341-83d9-b9205ef47cff/040121_Nosferotter.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a71d65e0-c160-4341-83d9-b9205ef47cff/040121_Nosferotter.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Nosferotter, a bipedal otter with long claws and a cloak-like body"></a>

                 <h3>Alien Arr-chive</h3> 
                 <p>Some believe alien arr-chives are distant relations to ghorans and raxilites, but arr-chives remain close-mouthed about their species’ origins. After all, knowledge of other species and creatures is their stock in trade. And they use that wealth of information to aid in their constant piracy. </p>

                 <p><b>Demoralizing Glare (Ex)</b> An alien arr-chive can attempt the demoralize task of Intimidate as a move action instead of a standard action.</p> 
                 <p><b>Target Weak Spot (Ex)</b> As a move action, an alien arr-chive can size up an opponent with a successful Perception check (DC = 20 + the target’s level or CR). If successful, the arr-chive’s next attack that hits that creature deals an additional 4 points of damage, as long as that attack is made before the end of the arr-chive’s next turn.</p>

                 <h3>Psstpsstmitl</h3> 
                 <p>Few creatures delight in causing senseless chaos more than the feared psstpsstmitl. These felines look startlingly similar to domestic cats except for their towering size, the largest recorded sighting being over 70 feet tall at the shoulders. Though psstpsstmitls are ferocious predators and will eat nearly anything, many survivors of psstpsstmitl attacks report the colossal cats simply batting them around like toys, sending humanoids flying in various directions before appearing to grow bored and unceremoniously departing. Many adventurers swear that the monstrous felines simply enjoy wreaking havoc upon the battlefield, rather than being primarily motivated by food, though some reports describe the psstpsstmitl snatching provisions to eat after growing bored of knocking about its victims.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7f836b80-27d9-4098-8d09-3c1a2da7a9a2/040121_Psstpsstmitl.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7f836b80-27d9-4098-8d09-3c1a2da7a9a2/040121_Psstpsstmitl.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Psstpsstmitl, a very large feline similar to domesticated cats "></a>

                 <h3>Dessert Drake</h3> 
                 <p>Kin to the desert drake, among others, dessert drakes are kinder and gentler than their elemental relatives. Their scales range from pale custard to a crispy golden brown, and many dessert drakes accessorize their scales by painting colorful flowers and patterns. Dessert drakes love to conceptualize and bake new cakes, cookies and pastries, and are known to share their latest batches with nearby settlements and wayward travelers. Spoiler forums on the infosphere claim that bakers are auditioning to compete in a competition known as “The Great Triaxus Drake-Off,” judged by several prominent dessert drakes.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f0146b17-04a8-4b98-a274-9c464eb2422f/040121_DessertDrake.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f0146b17-04a8-4b98-a274-9c464eb2422f/040121_DessertDrake.png" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Kin to the desert drake, among others, dessert drakes are kinder and gentler than their elemental relatives.

                 <p>Many a Game Master may need to spice things up and interject a moment of tension in the middle of a confusing puzzle or long social engagement, and think “hey, a quick combat here would do the trick!” A centaur is a classic creature, but how would I justify having a centaur in the middle of this fancy dinner party in idk the Darklands or whatever? When no monster quite fits the situation, there’s always the nonsequitaur, a curious creature that is exactly like a centaur, except that it appears when you least expect it.</p> 
                 <h4>Nonsequitaur — Creature 3</h4> 
                 <p>N, Large, Beast</p>

                 <p><b>Centaur out of Nowhere</b> [reaction] <b>Trigger</b> The PCs round a corner, open a chest or door, unmask a villain, or draw back a particularly plush curtain; <b>Requirements</b> The PCs are not thinking about centaurs; <b>Effect</b> A nonsequitaur appears whenever it is least expected. A nonsequitaur comes into being and everyone rolls initiative.</p> 
                 <p><b>AC</b> 20; <b>Fort</b> +8, <b>Ref</b> +9, <b>Will</b> +9</p> 
                 <p><b>HP</b> 40</p> 
                 <p><b>You Should Have Paid Attention to the Centaur</b> [reaction] <b>Trigger</b> A creature ends its turn without attacking, casting spells at, using skills on, or otherwise acknowledging the nonsequitaur; <b>Effect</b> The nonsequitaur dominates all forms of interaction. It uses MORE! CENTAURS! as a reaction.</p> 
                 <p><b>Forget about Me?</b> [reaction] <b>Trigger</b> The nonsequitaur leaves the field of view of all of the PCs; <b>Effect</b> The nonsequitaur feels ignored. It uses MORE! CENTAURS! as a reaction.</p> 
                 <p><b>At Least That's Over</b> [reaction] <b>Trigger</b> The nonsequitaur is reduced to 0 Hit Points; <b>Effect</b> It isn't, not yet. The nonsequitaur uses MORE! CENTAURS! as a reaction, then dies.</p> 
                 <p><b>Speed</b> 40 feet</p> 
                 <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action] hoof +9 (agile), <b>Damage</b> 1d10+4 bludgeoning</p>

                 <p><b>MORE! CENTAURS!</b> [two-actions] The nonsequitaur decides that this could be improved by more centaurs. It causes another nonsequitaur to spontaneously come into being in an unoccupied space within 60 feet. Before you ask, YES this summoned nonsequitaur can use MORE! CENTAURS! as well, NO this is not a design oversight. I write the blog, them's the breaks.</p>

                 <h3>Floolf</h3> 
                 <p>Frozen tundras are inhospitable places at the best of times, but the floolf is one such creature that has adapted to life in this most forbidding of landscapes. Their dense, long fur makes them appear extremely fluffy, which keeps their body temperatures well regulated. Like the chinchilla, floolves are hunted for their fur, but unlike the small rodent, floolves are considerably dangerous. Many an opportunistic soul has attempted to get rich quick by hunting and trapping floolves for their pelts, but such ventures rarely end in anything but a bonus snack for a hungry pack. </p> 
                 <p>While floolves are highly social creatures, it is not unheard of for individuals to wander away from the pack for short periods of time. They are known for being highly defensive, swiftly and viciously attacking whatever they view as a threat. However, there are tales of people, particularly the very young or very old, who have become lost overnight near floolf territory and been approached by a solitary floolf who will curl up around them until dawn breaks, then lead them back to the nearest town or settlement.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8bad6653-480d-49f5-b86f-1c8de3ea4a7a/040121_Floolf.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8bad6653-480d-49f5-b86f-1c8de3ea4a7a/040121_Floolf.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A small, fuffy, canine-like creature"></a>

                 <h4>Floolf — Creature 1</h4> 
                 <p>N, Medium, Animal</p> 
                 <p><b>Perception</b> +11; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 20 feet</p> 
                 <p><b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +9, Athletics +9, Stealth +11, Survival +10</p>

                 <p><b>Pack Attack</b> The floolf’s attack deals 1d8 extra damage to creatures within the reach of at least two of floolf’s allies.</p> 
                 <p><b>Cute Aggression</b> Floolf pups are so adorable that any creature that is either a mammal, or has an Intelligence above 3 that sees or touches a floolf pup must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or it will defend the floolf pup with its life. This effect ends when the creature is no longer able to perceive the pup. If the creature can speak, anytime it remembers the floolf pup, it feels a compulsion (Will save DC 15) to tell their story of the encounter, invariably ending with the phrase, “I would die for that floolf.”</p>

                 <p>The importance of this day, a day to acknowledge and celebrate trans voices in our communities, is punctuated by recent political actions seeking to prevent trans youth from receiving medical care, yet another attempt in a long history to silence a group of people and strip away their humanity. This day is highlighted by its relation to the Transgender Day of Remembrance (November 20th) which honors the trans lives lost to violence, bigotry, and indifference. We hope that this day of visibility can stand as a beacon of light and hope for the trans people in all of the different roles in our gaming community: from colleagues to contractors, players to partners. Wherever you are on your journey, we’re glad to have you around the table to roll dice, tell stories, and make some truly fantastic memories together.</p> 
                 <p>Below are contributions from several of our transgender community members, each focused on their personal truth and experience. Some of these entries are raw and emotional. This is a very personal topic, and we support our contributors in speaking genuinely about a subject that affects every part of their lives. We thank them for taking the time to share their insight with the wider community. </p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5d96c141-7350-41cc-a478-5b5da2cb0301/033121_Medda.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5d96c141-7350-41cc-a478-5b5da2cb0301/033121_Medda.png" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A long haired warrior dressed in leather armor with a fur mantle, carrying a spear"></a>

                 <p>I’ve spent a lot of time playing and making TTRPGs. When I first started playing Pathfinder regularly in 2013, I already knew I was trans. It took me a while before I started playing explicitly trans characters, since I was worried that people who played in my local area wouldn’t be welcoming. Since then, the world has changed. While I still experience transphobia, I’m more confident moving through the world as a trans person. Part of this comes from having more stability in my life, but a big part is seeing other trans people be able to live genuinely. Inclusion of trans characters in Paizo books, particularly the wealth of characters in Lost Omens: Legends, often starts with individual contributors deciding to push for more trans representation. Representation can never replace having trans people creating and playing TTRPGs, but it sends a clear sign that trans people are invited in. I live my life as open as possible and include trans characters in my writing to let trans people know they’re welcome, and to let people who are thinking about coming out as trans see full, happy trans lives.<br> <em>Rigby Bendele, freelance author (they/them)</em></p> 
                 <br> 
                 <p>I’m Alison Cybe, and I’ve been playing TTRPGs since 1993. That makes me older than most types of fossils. I started early, when my parents bought me one of TSR’s black box games for my birthday. Because of that, I’m one of those people who will talk endlessly about how important a good starter set is for a game. I was also one of those players who was always “happy” to play a female character as well as a male one. I kinda noticed that a lot of players in my local club were the opposite, but a few of us were content to “cross-RP,” as it was called back then. I’ve not actually heard anyone call it that for years now, which is good. Shows that we’ve moved on a lot. This means that, for me, gaming provided a safe “fantasy space” to explore the way that gender is constructed and perform as the type of woman I had always somewhat wanted to be. Over the years, I've met a lot of trans and nonbinary people whose first avenues of exploration were the same and ultimately lead to understanding their own identities. Because of that, I always tend to be quite outspoken on the idea that trans characters should be visible in games. There are no settings that don’t benefit from the added diversity of characters, and the value that they give to the audiences outweighs the upset that they cause to bigots (which is, in my honest opinion, an additional bonus). The best way to do this is to create avenues for trans people to write trans characters and subjects—in fact, publishers should do this with people of every minority as much as possible. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.<br> <em>-Alison Cybe, freelance author (they/them) or (she/her)</em></p> 
                 <br> 
                 <p>I know that “visibility” is an issue I’m supposed to care about. I know that it’s the first step along the very, very long path toward you people treating us like actual human beings, rather than aberrations. Honestly, though, this week? I really couldn’t care less.</p> 
                 <p>I’m supposed to use this blog to talk about how including trans characters enriches a fictional world. They do, of course—at bare minimum because trans people exist in the real world. To not include us in your narratives, or in your games, is a quiet signifier that you really wouldn’t mind if we were gone. Believe me when I say: trans people notice when you do this. We put you on the list of cissies we don’t trust. And we all have a list. We have to—you might kill us, after all. </p> 
                 <p>Don’t believe me? Ask one of your trans friends. You do have trans friends, right?</p> 
                 <p>Personally, I’d love to talk about examples of trans characters enriching fictional worlds—but then, of course, I’d need some examples. Which examples should I use? The ones where we’re monstrous, misogynistic villains, like in Silence of the Lambs? The ones where we’re broken, made to suffer, in the hopes that you all might actually start caring about our struggle, like The Last of Us Part 2? Or maybe softer ones, like The Danish Girl, where you couldn’t even be bothered to cast an actress to play the title role? Which disrespect would you like me to entertain?</p> 
                 <p>(Perhaps you think I’m being unfair, by lumping you in with the others. Can’t imagine what that’s like.)</p> 
                 <p>I don’t know how I’m expected to talk about how trans characters enrich a fictional world when I’ve almost never seen a fictional world that let a trans character enrich it. I can count on one hand the number of positive media representations of trans people that I’ve personally witnessed, let alone enjoyed. But then again, this is just art imitating life: as the Arkansas legislature so forcefully reminded us this week, you don’t want trans people to enrich the real world, either.</p> 
                 <p>I would love to be proven wrong on this. But the operative word there is “prove.” This is the thing that none of you seem to get: you have to prove it. By default, to protect ourselves, I and other trans people have to assume you hate us. So prove us wrong. </p> 
                 <p>Prove us wrong by writing us into your stories. Write us with rich inner lives. Write us messy and flawed and full of joy. Write us full of hatred for a world that hated us first. And then, when you’re done, pay a trans person to tell you all the ways you got it wrong. Because you will get it wrong, and that’s okay. What’s not okay is complacency in the face of that wrongness. Cis complacency digs trans graves.</p>

                 <p>My name is Sasha Laranoa Harving, although I also go by the name Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, and I am neither male nor female. That doesn't mean I lack a gender, although it does for some, and I personally use nov/nov/novs/novself pronouns. For me, my experience with gender was always one of looking up at the stars on dark nights in the countryside and feeling at home, more so than I ever did in the house I lived in. I felt like I was one with the stars for many years, in a way no other person I meet seemed to resonate with. And as time went on, as I realized there was something else to me than my mediocre life had implied, I discovered roleplaying games, and I saw characters who expressed their gender more freely than I had, colorful gnomes whose stats proudly declared them nonbinary! Spiteful dragons who dared to lack a gender in a time when the roles forced upon us were clear and seemingly constant! I also discovered Starfinder with its acknowledgment of the power the stars have: fiery and passionate, cold and distant, a variation for every pinprick of light in the sky, just like the people upon this world. I realized my gender was more than an expression along a two-point scale; my gender was that of the stellar world above and deserving to be acknowledged, embraced, and loved, just like every other light above and every life below. So, when you call me, hear me: I am a star.<br> <em>- Sasha Laranoa Harving, freelance author (nov/nov)</em></p>

                 <p>My name is Sol, short for Solomon, though you won’t see that on any of Paizo’s products—yet. I hemmed and hawed a lot about taking part in this blog as, compared to a lot of people here, I’m very new. I’ve only been at Paizo for about six months. It’s my first job in the RPG industry, and the first where I felt comfortable enough to publicly use they/them. It is, in fact, the first place outside the internet where I’ve started taking steps to be visible as who and what I am. These steps are not steady. To be visible to others, to be known, and to admit that those who knew me maybe don’t—it’s scary. I think lots of people with recently-cracked eggs feel the same way, even if they—like me—have a good and trusted support network, and even if they—like me—have dabbled with the thought of transitioning for years. Like others, I used RPGs to play with gender long before I thought to apply those principles to myself. Recently, though, it’s been the growing number of visibly trans, nonbinary, and just plain queer characters in the gaming sphere and beyond that have bolstered my courage and reaffirmed my intent. Every casual, singular “they” and genderless or trans NPC that comes across my desk leaves me thinking, “I want that. Someday. And I can have it, when I’m ready.” For those like me, who aren’t quite ready, that representation offers comfort, lessons, and a promise. It reassures that there has always been a place for us, a place that will wait until we’re ready to be seen. So, this is me tilting my hand. I’m here. I’m almost ready. And for those like me: I know you’re out there. Take all the time you need. We’ll see you.<br> <em>-Solomon, Paizo staff (they/them)</em></p> 
                 <br> 
                 <p>Roleplaying games helped me discover who I am. By being able to play different characters, all with aspects of myself imbued within them, I have been able to discover more about myself than I thought possible. Growing up, I’d play RPGs, video game and tabletop, and I’d play powerful women doing amazing things as often as possible. When I’d get stuck playing a “boy character,” I’d often just focus on mechanics and ignore the character, or imbue these compulsory male heroes with stereotypical traits, betraying my disingenuous view of masculinity. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I started researching transgender women in order to properly write one into an adventure. I found the experiences, thoughts, and feelings of these women to be eerily like my own. It was then that I had the realization that I am trans. My own journey of accidental self-discovery by writing a trans character into an adventure inspired me to stay visible and keep trans characters visible in our games. I hoped that it would help other people discover themselves by seeing someone like them depicted in stories. And it has worked. I’ve heard from multiple gamers that seeing a transgender character, written by transgender authors, has lead them to self-acceptance and given them courage to confront the social norms of our society and the roles that have been thrust upon us by the circumstances of our birth. Representation matters. Being visible matters. It’s a small step, but one that will lead us to a more peaceful and prosperous future.<br> <em>-Vanessa Hoskins, freelance author (she/her)</em></p> 
                 <br> 
                 <p>To our trans community members: we see you, we hear you, and we support you! Thank you for enriching our community with your presence. </p>

                 <p>I first started working in the video game industry where I worked with Nintendo on many fun projects, a favorite being <em>Zelda: Twilight Princess</em>. While there, I got to work with Sonja and met Sarah briefly. I then worked freelance making strategy guides for Pokémon and video game maps for guides like <em>Skyfall</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em>. I was then offered a great opportunity to join the Paizo family and learn about producing TTRPGs and have been there ever since. I now get to work with Sonja, Sarah, and an incredible art team. I once again am working on maps, laying out new products, and really enjoy ordering art as a Senior Graphic Designer. I love seeing the amazing pieces we have come in and the fans reactions to them.</p> 
                 <br> 
                 <h3>Sonja Morris</h3> 
                 <p>I have been working in gaming since 1991, starting in the video game industry then moving to TTRPG in 2012, achieving the position of Managing Art Director. I have many favorite projects that I have worked on at Paizo, but the thing I love the most is collaborating with my colleagues to come up with fun and engaging art and design. In addition to gaming, I love horror movies, music, and spending time with my wife Alex and chihuahua Max.</p> 
                 <br> 
                 <h3>Sarah Robinson</h3> 
                 <p>I am one of the most senior employees here at Paizo and hold the position of Director of Visual Design. I started with <em>Dragon Magazine</em> and have worked on almost every project since. Working with the many artists that take our art descriptions to final illustrations, for all of our projects, is the best part of my job. I knew Sonja long before my days here at Paizo when we were creating layouts for <em>Nintendo Power</em> and I met Emily during that time. It has been great to work with them again, along with the rest of the art team.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/24327b12-d026-4970-b4cb-1f88222b9acf/102120_Storm-Bear.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/24327b12-d026-4970-b4cb-1f88222b9acf/102120_Storm-Bear.png" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A large blue and white bear with ruins on its chest and lightning between its claws"></a>

                 <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> 
                 <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica Catalan. I’m a mom, freelance author, and blogger, and I’m thrilled to stand alongside the many talented women working in tabletop gaming. As a huge fan of Pathfinder and Starfinder, writing for Paizo is a dream come true. It’s been a wonderful experience full of exciting projects, fulfilling work, and welcoming people, both in the company and among my fellow freelancers. (You can find my announced projects here: <a href="https://paizo.com/people/JessicaCatalan">https://paizo.com/people/JessicaCatalan</a> )</p> 
                 <p>When I was offered the opportunity to write for today’s blog, I pounced—then faltered. The words wouldn’t come and, as much as I’m happy in my skin, that wasn’t always true. Like many women, I heard “you can’t” and “you’re just a girl” more than I care to remember. I endured the insults and arbitrary constraints. But as a girl growing up in the 90s, when ‘girl power’ was in full swing and sarcastic girls kicked ass in robot pterodactyls, I reclaimed my femininity with pride while young. Media—from Sailor Moon to Pink and countless others—made all the difference. I had it easy.</p> 
                 <p>I’ve always been a quiet person—never one to stand up or seek recognition. But I have a daughter. And when she came home from Kindergarten a few years ago, in tears from enduring all too familiar insults for the first time, it became glaringly obvious the issues I’d thought I’d left behind weren’t better; I’d just became accustomed to fighting past them. Now I had to teach her to do the same.</p> 
                 <p>There’s a moment in Avengers: End Game where the Marvel women unite onscreen. It’s short, but the sight brought my daughter to tears. That was her Spice Girls—forty seconds of female superheroes carrying a glove—and then it was gone. My son didn’t even notice. Representation matters—for girls like my daughter, yes, but also for countless other people enduring so much worse with less visibility.</p> 
                 <p>My name is Jessica Catalan. I’m a Canadian, Métis woman and author in the gaming industry. This is me standing up to be counted. Whoever you represent and whatever you stand for, I hope you join me. To someone out there, it means world.</p> 
                 <br> 
                 <h3>Jenny Jarzabski, Starfinder Society Developer</h3> 
                 <p>Jenny Jarzabski is a longtime Paizo freelancer who writes prolifically for Pathfinder and Starfinder, though authoring organized play scenarios was always her favorite. She’s best known for her <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0w?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-107-The-Solar-Sortie">Starfinder Society scenarios #1-07: The Solar Sortie</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn3/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-201-Pact-World-Warriors#2">#2-01: Pact World Warriors</a>, and the interactive special <a herf="https://paizo.com/products/btq024x0?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-300-The-Last-Bite">#3-00: The Last Bite</a>. Jenny now works as the Starfinder Society Developer at Paizo, helming the strange and beautiful ship that is SFS full time. You can find her on Twitter (@jenjski), Twitch (jezebel77), and Instagram (cutie_gothbot).</p>

                 <h3>Simone D. Sallé</h3> 
                 <p>Hi fellow creatives! I first worked with the Paizo team in 2018 as a contract editor for the 2e Playtest, then spent the past few years as a freelance contributor (including the Starfinder Character Operations Manual, Lost Omens: Gods and Magic, Bestiary 3, &amp; more). As of this month I'm once again contracted with the editorial team full-time! I'm so grateful to get to learn from and work alongside such bright, creative people who are as passionate as I am about making TTRPGs accessible and welcoming to all. There are so many more stories to be told, so for those who want to be involved in making games—especially if you haven't seen yourself well represented in gaming spaces before—I'll share the same advice I needed to hear: don't tell yourself you're not experienced enough to belong! GM that game, join community groups like Freelance Forge, answer the open author calls. There's room for you at the table.</p> 
                 <br> 
                 <h3>Nicole Heits</h3> 
                 <p>Nicole joined the Paizo organized play volunteer community with a bang, jumping in to get a group going in her town, becoming a venture-agent in April of 2020. Since then, she’s lent her hands and her typing skills to many a convention online, including ConCurrent, Gen Con Online, PAX Online, and ReaperCon. The latter was a short notice event when the original organizer became ill and needed assistance and Nichole responded instantaly with offers of assistance. She lends experience to any event she’s involved in. More recently, she took on a larger leadership role in the volunteer community, including building a Rivers Region discord and helping process volunteer agreements. Her energy and enthusiasm spread to the venture-officer corps and she is an important member of the team.</p> 
                 <br> 
                 <p>There are more women working on projects at Paizo, sharing their creativity and energy with our community. To those in the blog and those who prefer to remain behind the scenes, we thank you for sharing your gifts with our community. For anyone interested in joining the greater Paizo community of freelancers, games professionals, and volunteer coordinators, please take the leap and join us. </p>

                 <p>First, <a href="http://www.paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online 2021</a> registration is currently open and game sign ups for players opens April 1st. On Monday, we’re updating our PaizoCon website with this year’s information, including the Paizo Twitch streaming schedule. This year also sees the return of the PaizoCon Puzzle Hunt for the 5th consecutive year. Join us May 28th-31st for four days of gaming, chatting, and exploring everything Paizo!</p> 
                 <p>Second, while we are working toward population vaccination, there is not enough certainty around the timeline to proceed with an in-person PaizoCon UK this year. We’d like to thank Dave Harrison, PaizoCon UK coordinator, and his event team for thinking of the safety of the community this convention season. </p>

                 <p>Fortunately, Dave is teaming up with Benoit Grȏs and the team that brought you PaizoCon Francia to offer PaizoCon Europe Online! Slated for August 19th-22nd, the game schedule will be centered around European time zones, but will also feature an overnight block of games aimed at America-based gamers. Need another reason to attend PaizoCon Europe Online? We are launching the new season and metaplot of the Pathfinder Society! We’ll have more information soon, including how to register as a player or GM.</p>

The date and location are still TBD, though we expect it to be a weekend in November and somewhere in the Sydney/Brisbane/Canberra region. We will pass information on to the community as soon as decisions are made so keep an eye on our blog for updates.</p>

                 <p>A second survey is online, this time on which monsters should be included in the monsters’ expansion pack. Pathfinder Arena divides monsters into four tiers, one per each round of the game. The higher the round, the stronger the monsters. </p> 
                 <p>The range of monsters eligible for the survey are: </p> 
                 <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                  <li>Tier 1: Goblin Pyro (a group of 2-3 miniatures), Ghoul, Orc Warchief</li> 
                  <li>Tier 2: Cyclops, Harpy, Gargoyle</li> 
                  <li>Tier 3: Hobgoblin General, Nightmare, Fleshwarped Drow</li> 
                  <li>Tier 4: Lamia Matriarch, Onidoshi, Mummy Pharaoh</li> 
                 </ul> 
                 <p>The most voted monsters of each tier will be included in the expansion pack.</p> 
                 <p>Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/403722200813208" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> to vote for your favorite monsters. We will add them in the future campaign!</p> 
                 <p>The crowdfunding date is yet to be determined, as well as the platform hosting it.

                 <h3>Tineke Bolleman</h3> 
                 <p>If you’ve ever been to PaizoCon, either online or in the flesh, you probably have a memory of a friendly conversation or late-night shenanigans with Tineke Bolleman. Tineke’s a longtime volunteer— she started in 2014 and became the Venture Captain of the Netherlands region in 2017, to be exact—and is a positive force for change, inclusion, and welcoming others into our shared spaces.<br> After years of serving our community as a volunteer, Tineke started freelancing for Paizo. She’s an author for Starfinder Society scenario’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya08w?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-116-Dreaming-of-the-Future">#1-16: Dreaming of the Future</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01va4?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-124-Siege-of-Enlightenment">#1-24:Siege of Enlightenment</a> as well as Pathfinder Society scenario’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0217l?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-105-Trailblazers-Bounty">#1-05: Trailblazers’ Bounty</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zi?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-203-Catastrophes-Spark">#2-03: Catastrophe’s Spark</a>. Her work has also been published by Rusted Iron Games, Wayfinder, Eyes Unclouded (a really neat setting based on Studio Ghibli’s works), and A Crystal Heart. On working with a few months ago on Starfinder Society <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026hp?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-315-Frozen-Ambitions-The-Preluria-Connection">#3-15: Frozen Ambitions: The Preluria Connection</a>, Starfinder Society Developer Jenny Jarzabski says, “I feel confident saying that she’s a rising star you should keep your eye on! Whether she’s writing adventures, roleplaying vesk in tiaras, or telling us all about weird animals, Tineke brings joy and laughter to our community. We’re lucky to have her!”<br> When asked, Tineke noted she is very proud of writing the Marixah Republic and the Gideron Authority in SFS 1-24 and Near Space and that she has written many favorite characters including the Chelaxian kids from Trailblazer’s Bounty, Amkha from Catastrophe’s Spark, and Kanavu from Dreaming of the Future. She also gave a honorable mention to Wilbert the Saint Bernard.</p> 
                 <br> 
                 <h3>Linda Zayas-Palmer</h3> 
                 <p>Linda participated in the Pathfinder Society as a player, then GM, then volunteer coordinator several years before she join the Paizo staff as a Pathfinder Society developer in spring 2015. Over the past six years, she’s help shepherd the Society through an edition change and several in-game world shattering events. As managing developer, she worked closely with the Lost Omens team of Eleanor and Luis in creating the Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide. Linda is known for her love of leshys, creating many of the creatures that appear in the Pathfinder RPG. Lesser known, but as loved, is venture-captain Armeline Jirneau, a reform-minded-member of the Envoy’s Alliance with a secret identity. First introduced in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9oij?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-806-Reaping-What-We-Sow">PFS 8-06: Reaping What We Sow</a>, Armeline’s part of a new generation of venture-captains. Readers can learn more about Armeline in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide">Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide</a>. </p>

                 <h3>Hilary Moon Murphy</h3> 
                 <p>Hilary Moon Murphy (aka Hmm) is a librarian, mom and a gamer chick. She's passionate about building community, and so has spent a lot of time as an Paizo Organized Play GM and volunteer. Writing for Paizo has been a ton of fun, and she always loves when she sees players using something cool that she wrote for either Starfinder or Pathfinder. Instead of talking more about herself in the third person though, she'd like to address all the other women who may be reading this blog and asking themselves the question: "Could I become a freelancer too?" So, here's the straight answer: if you're a female gamer, chances are you already know a lot about working hard, being creative and finding time for what's important. If you want to write, go for it! Submit to Wayfinder. Write for 3PP products. Get business cards. Contact Paizo developers at conventions and say, "I want to write for you" and hand them your business card. Do it and be awesome!</p> 
                 <br> 
                 <h3>Sara Marie</h3> 
                 <p>While many of the women in this blog are from our editorial department, Sara Marie comes from the operations side of Paizo. Sara Marie started at Paizo over ten years ago, working her way up through the ranks of Customer Service to her current position of manager of the Customer Service and Community departments. This is a huge amount of effort, as not only does she lead one of the most public facing teams, but she also moderates the forums and is a staunch advocate of our play-by-post community. If you’ve ever travelled to PaizoCon or Gen Con, you most likely encountered her expertly directing activities in the registration queue or store. When she isn’t busy keeping the wheels turning, she loves crafts and exploring the beautiful outdoor landscape of the Pacific Northwest. Sara has also been learning about the interactions between businesses and local government, and how the community of tabletop roleplaying games here in Washington can continue to grow and thrive.</p>

                 <h3>Jessica Redekop</h3> 
                 <p>My name is Jessica Redekop and I'm a woman in tabletop gaming. I contributed to the recent <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide">Pathfinder Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3">Bestiary 3</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jf?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-216-Freedom-for-Wishes">PFS #2-16 Freedom for Wishes</a>. I was also a contributor to Lost Spheres Publishing's City of 7 Seraphs, and I play Xiadani on Know Direction's Valiant, an actual play podcast. I'm on twitter and Instagram as @tectonomancer.<br> I love RPGs and I am grateful to every person I've known on my journey into this industry, to the people I've played games with and to those who gave me a chance as a writer, who welcomed me into this hobby and made me feel like I belonged. I know how often women and enbies are turned away from gaming, heard the horror stories about convention experiences, and have had some of those horror story experiences myself. It's easy to imagine how differently I'd feel about RPGs with that kind of introduction to them. I'm grateful that didn't happen to me. </p>

                 <h3>Tonya Woldridge</h3> 
                 <p>Hello nufriends! My Paizo-adjacent journey started as a volunteer in England. I was venture officer of several places before joining the Paizo team as the Organized Play Coordinator in 2015. Though I joined a publishing company, I never thought of writing as a creative outlet. My goals focused on growing the organized play program, partly through making play spaces more inclusive so that everyone would want to participate. A couple years in, I wanted to understand more about the publishing side of our business. I mentioned this to Linda. She helped me secure an assignment and mentored me through the whole process. This help gave me the confidence to ask for another assignment, which led to me writing for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide">Pathfinder Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide</a>. While I’m not seeking a writing career, being part of the production of a book led to deeper insight and helps me be a more effective manager of the Organized Play program. <br> Between organized play and freelancing, I’ve met a host of fantastic people I love spending time with! To anyone thinking they want to join gaming communities, please do, we can’t wait to meet you! You can find me on Facebook (PaizoOrgPlay), Twitter (@PaizoOPM) and Discord (TonyaOPM#6396). I look forward to saying hi!</p>

                 <h3>Ivis Flanagan</h3> 
                 <p>Hi, I’m Ivis – one of Paizo’s newer freelancers, and OPF Venture Officer. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mu?Pathfinder-Bounty-8-The-Tireless-Path">Bounty 8: The Tireless Path</a> comes out at the end of this month. I also wrote part of quest pack <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0251a?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-311-Into-the-Veskarium">SFS 3-11 Into the Veskarium</a>, was released late last year, which was written and developed by a group that was all women or non-binary!<br> Marian Wright Edleman once said “you can’t be what you can’t see,” and it is a thought that comes full circle for me. I was taught as a kid that “girls can’t play RPGs” by the boys who ran them, and since I never saw anyone other than that core crew doing so, I took it to heart that they must be right. For years I stayed out of the tabletop space, believing that it wasn’t a place that I belonged. Then I found Paizo’s Organized Play, where for the first time I saw people that looked like me participating, and I felt like I could take part. <br> In my time in this space, I have met some incredible women. Many of them I have looked up to as mentors, and some I am even lucky enough to call friends. They have all encouraged me to move forward, to step into out and into my own, becoming confident in my abilities through the process. I have come from being very shy player, to a competent gm, and now to an author – getting to help build the worlds that I love for those that come after. My greatest hope in all of this is to be seen by someone else and help them step forward onto their own path. </p> 
                 <br> 
                 <h3>Devinne Caples</h3> 
                 <p>Devine joined us just over a year ago as our HR generalist. It was just before we transitioned to work from home. She moved into the office next to the Customer Service department. Sara Marie shared her experience of Devinne. “Often in the mornings, we would be arriving at the same time for work and get to catch up about work and life while I got a pot of coffee started for the day. Devinne has been a source of inspiration and camaraderie over the past year, checking in on me during some very rough spots, being a compassionate listener as I try to navigate my career as a parent and a woman. Devinne provided insight, advice, empathy, and so much knowledge. From my colleagues at here Paizo, I’ve heard so many similarly positive things about how she has been able to help and support them.”<br> Writing this out for this blog is bittersweet, as this March also marks the end of Devinne’s time at Paizo, as she had an absolutely wonderful opportunity come up elsewhere. Her new organization is lucky to have her, though she will be sorely missed here at Paizo. Congratulations Devinne! </p> `
                 <p>These are just a few of the absolute rock stars involved in producing the games you love. If you get a chance, please let them know how much their contributions benefit your hobby! </p>

                 <p itemprop="description">The organized play development team prepared quite a few treats for the community this month. From the developers:</p> 
                 <p>For over a century, a massive rift into the Abyss plagued Golarion--the Worldwound. Though this rift has finally closed, the people who are slowly reclaiming their ancestral land from demonic influence face all manner of corruption and chaos. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027je?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-215-A-Dirge-for-Sarkoris">A Dirge for Sarkoris</a>, by Kendra Leigh Speedling, Pathfinder agents come to the aid of their old allies in the Farheaven Clan, facing blight and death on their quest to retrieve the remains of the honored from desecrated burial sites. This adventure is written for levels 3–6.</p> 
                 <p>Wishcrafting is fraught with both power and peril. The infamous genie-binder Corvius Vayn is now faced with the consequences of exploiting beings who wield this reality-warping magic. But wishcraft is rarely subtle, and what was supposed to be a party has now become a fantastical prison for Corvius and dozens of others. Explore the wonders and dangers of Vayn’s wishwarped manor in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jf?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-216-Freedom-for-Wishes">Freedom for Wishes</a>, a level 5–8 adventure by Jessica Redekop.</p>

                 <p>Hi there, Starfinders! I’m sure most of you have heard the rumors by now, so I’m here to confirm it for you—the ysoki you all love to hate is back! Before the Society wrecked her plans, Datch planned multiple countermeasures in the event of failure, one of which threatens to massively disrupt AbadarCorp. In a rare act of repentance (or perhaps a bid to lessen her sentence), Datch directs a group of Starfinders to stop the disaster from happening! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jc?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-319-Rats-Repentance">Rat’s Repentance</a> is an adventure for PCs of levels 1–4 and is written by four amazing new authors: Lau Bannenberg, Dave Nelson, Shay Snow, and Drew Taylor.</p> 
                 <p>We have an extra special treat planned for you this month, as well. Our first ever level 11–14 adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jd?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-320-Fleeting-Truth-Everchanging-Revelation">Fleeting Truth: Everchanging Revelation</a> also releases in March. Travel to the dangerous and mysterious planet Aucturn to retrieve the final data fragment before your Hellknight rivals can destroy it. I’m not saying there’s going to be eldritch horrors in this adventure, but it’s going to get pretty weird. Veteran author Cole Kronewitter did a fantastic job exploring Aucturn and you won’t want to miss this trip.</p>

                 <h3>Divine Warden of Brigh</h3> 
                 <p>Imbued with the divine energy of the goddess of clockwork and invention, divine wardens of Brigh are prominent in Alkenstar as guardians of the Temple of Brigh there. The Bronze Lady might have her largest following in this metropolis. But the city’s boomtown atmosphere means that security is a concern even on holy ground. Citizens and visitors to Alkenstar know about its wind-up sentries or quickly learn about them. The High Clockmother, head priestess of Brigh’s holy place, keeps divine wardens in the goddess's image visible in the sanctuary and on the grounds. These automatons are as much a warning to would-be thieves or troublemakers as they are an inspiration to Brigh’s worshippers. The mixing of divine and arcane in these constructs is intended to show off innovation and evoke Brigh’s power over earth, fire, metal, and smoke.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com//a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/604c096a-4527-421a-b7d3-776a1d72eb49/031921_DivineWarden.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/604c096a-4527-421a-b7d3-776a1d72eb49/031921_DivineWarden.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A clockwork woman covered in golden fillagree reaches into an opening in her chest to touch a glowing red gem."></a>

                 <p><b>Uncommon N Medium Clockwork Construct Divine Mindless</b></p>

                 <p><b>Wind-Up</b> For a divine warden of Brigh to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can’t act until it’s wound again. The divine warden shuts down immediately once it has 0 time remaining.<br> A divine warden can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn’t decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception). It can’t act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).<br> A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a divine warden down (DC 27). For each success, the warden loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the warden is in standby mode.</p> 
                 <p><b>AC</b> 28; <b>Fort</b> +18, <b>Ref</b> +20, <b>Will</b> +18<br> <b>HP</b> 135; <b>Immunities</b> death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poisoned, sickened, unconscious; <b>Weaknesses</b> electricity 10, orichalcum 10; <b>Resistances</b> physical 5 (except adamantine or orichalcum)</p> 
                 <p><b>Clockwork Wand</b> The divine warden uses a mechanical wand as a focus to channel magical energy. This wand is built into the divine warden’s chest, with only the crystal at the end exposed. The warden can Interact to remove the wand, or someone else can remove it with a DC 32 Thievery check to Disable a Device. The divine warden becomes unable to cast any spells except cantrips while the wand is removed.<br> When removed, the <em>clockwork wand</em> is a <em>magic wand</em> containing the last 2nd-level innate spell the divine warden cast (the GM determines the spell randomly if the divine warden has not cast any eligible spells). The spells are placed within the wand while the divine warden is created, and the creator can substitute other arcane spells of the appropriate level.</p> 
                 <p><b>Divine Destruction</b> (divine, necromancy) When the divine warden is reduced to 0 HP, it erupts with divine energy in a 30-foot emanation, dealing 10d6 positive damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 29 Will save with the following outcomes.<br> <b>Critical Success</b> The creature takes half damage.<br> <b>Success</b> The creature takes full damage.<br> <b>Failure</b> The creature takes full damage and becomes temporarily cursed by Brigh to be enfeebled 1 and stupefied 1 for 1 day; this is a curse effect with a counteract DC of 29.<br> <b>Critical Failure</b> As failure, except the creature becomes enfeebled 2 and stupefied 2.</p> 
                 <p><b>Faith Bound</b> (abjuration, divine) The divine warden can’t attack a creature that openly wears or displays Brigh’s religious symbol unless that creature uses a hostile action against the divine warden first.</p> 
                 <p>Speed 25 feet</p> 
                 <p><b>Melee [one-action]</b> fist +20 (agile, finesse), <b>Damage</b> 2d10+6 bludgeoning</p> 
                 <p><b>Melee [one-action]</b> light hammer +20 (agile), <b>Damage</b> 2d6+6 bludgeoning</p> 
                 <p><b>Ranged [one-action]</b> light hammer +20 (agile, thrown 20 feet), <b>Damage</b>2d6+6 bludgeoning</p> 
                 <p><b>Arcane Innate Spells</b> DC 29, attack +21; <b>5th</b> <em>cloudkill, cone of cold</em>; <b>4th</b> <em>dimensional anchor, fly, wall of fire</em>; <b>3rd</b> <em>haste, invisibility, stinking cloud</em>; <b>2nd</b> <em>glitterdust, obscuring mist, web</em>; <b>1st</b> <em>feather fall, floating disk, grease</em>; <b>Cantrips (5th)</b> daze, detect magic, ray of frost, shield, tanglefoot</p> 
                 <p><b>Divine Innate Spells</b> DC 29; <b>Cantrips (5th)</b> daze</p> 
                 <p><b>Divine Domain Spells</b> 2 Focus Points, DC 29, attack +21; 5th hurtling stone, localized quake</p> 
                 <p><b>Energize Clockwork Wand [one-action]</b> (concentrate) <b>Frequency</b> once per 10 minutes; <b>Effect</b> The divine warden regains a spell it has already cast that day. It must spend 1 hour of its operational time, or 2 hours if the spell is 3rd level or higher.</p> 
                 <p><b>Faithful Weapon</b> light hammer, <em>striking</em> rune</p> 
                 <p><b>Instrument of Faith</b> The divine warden is a beacon for Brigh’s faith. A cleric of Brigh can channel a <em>heal</em> spell through a divine warden of Brigh they can see within 60 feet. The cleric determines any targets or area for the spell as if they were standing in the divine warden’s space.</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p itemprop="description">Last week, we revealed the title for Year 4 of Starfinder Society: <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shlp?Introducing-Starfinder-Society-Year-4">Year of the Data Scourge</a>. This week, we wanted to talk a little bit more about what we’re doing to kick off the season.</p> 
                 <p>One of our most common pieces of feedback from players and GMs is that it can be tough to figure out where to start new players. Do they play the most recent low-level scenario released? The first one of the season? Start at the beginning with 1-01 <em>The Commencement</em>? In an effort to make it easier for everyone, as well as refresh some of our older program pieces, we’re releasing a three-part Intro series at <a href="http://www.paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online</a>. I’ll let Jenny talk a bit about what’s in each Intro scenario now.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bc1b66da-9164-4eb6-8461-fa1df82f4c36/031821_Celita.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bc1b66da-9164-4eb6-8461-fa1df82f4c36/031821_Celita.png" align="left" width="300" hspace="5" alt="Celita, a blue haired android in a long black jacket holding a datapad"></a>

               <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027nd"><em>Starfinder Society Introduction #1: The First Test</em></a> is an introduction to the Starfinder Society for characters of levels 1-2. Brand new players (and GMs!) can learn what the Society is all about, as well as experiencing a variety of common encounters found in Starfinder Society adventures, by playing this scenario. The best part is that this adventure incorporates repeatable elements so that the same players can experience the fun again with a different character, making this an evergreen scenario to incorporate into your game days and conventions. This adventure is written by Paizo’s own Jason Keeley!</p> 
               <p>After players have an introduction to the campaign with Intro #1, they are encouraged to play <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ne"><em>Starfinder Society Introduction #2: For the Factions</em></a>. This adventure introduces the four major factions (Acquisitives, Dataphiles, Exo-Guardians, and Wayfinders) to players and GMs. In this adventure, the PCs complete a short mission for each faction and are encouraged to choose a faction they’re interested in working with at the end. This adventure is structured similarly to our classic Starfinder Society #1-01: The Commencement, but is full of exciting new content to tempt our veteran Starfinders as well as new players! This adventure is also for characters of levels 1-2, and was written by fan favorite freelancer Kate Baker. </p> 
               <p>Finally, get a taste of Year 4 by playing <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027nf"><em>Starfinder Society Introduction #3:Year of the Data Scourge</em></a> (also known as SFS 4-01). This scenario follows a team of Starfinders returning to the Society hub on Absalom Station when a series of digital attacks rocks the Pact Worlds. Play as a Starfinder battling their way across a dangerously glitching Absalom Station in search of answers, and find out what the Data Scourge event is all about! This scenario is written by yours truly, Starfinder Society Developer Jenny Jarzabski, and I promise it’ll be a great time. </p>

               <p>This three-part repeatable Intro arc will get a new character up to second level and allow them to learn about the Society and the current storyline through play. While Intro #1 and #2 are intended to anchor this arc for the foreseeable future, we plan to swap Intro #3 out every year with the first scenario of the new season, to introduce all players to the new season’s metaplot.</p> 
               <p>We hope everyone finds these scenarios both exciting and useful! They will launch at <a href="http://paizocon.com/">PaizoCon Online</a> at the end of May along with two new Pathfinder Society scenarios and the final Pathfinder Adventure Card Society special. We can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been cooking up! </p> 
               <p>Don’t forget to set reminders to join the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/">Know Direction Network</a> on March 24th as they chat with Linda and Alex about PaizoCon Online and info on our Organized Play Programs. If you missed Jenny’s interview on Know Direction, it will be uploaded soon!</p> 
               <p>Come back next week for a preview of this month’s new releases. Until then - Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

                <h3>Calder CaDavid</h3> 
                <p>Hello, Calder here! I was thrilled to write for some of my favorite ancestries – aasimar and orcs in <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. I’ve been a freelancing TTRPG writer for a little over two years and loving every moment. I’ve written for previous Lost Omens books, the PFS adventure (1-22) <em>The Doom of Cassomir</em> and several adventures for the subscription service Dungeon in a Box. I hosted and ran the actual-play and GM discussion podcast Mythos Manual, which post-modern plague may actually get back to. I work in television production and live in Los Angeles with my cat, dog and fiancé. Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/CaDavidCalder" target="_blank">@CaDavidCalder</a>. Enjoy more Lost Omens goodness!</p>

                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica Catalan and I wrote androids and azarketi for <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. I’ve been freelancing for Paizo’s Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs for nearly two years. In that time I’ve contributed to twenty three projects for Paizo (and counting!), including <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, <em>Alien Archive 4</em>, five Organized Play scenarios, and a variety of other products that will release over the next year or so. In between freelancing and parenting, I occasionally find time to update <e href="http://d20diaries.com/" target="_blank">

                <h3>Lyz Liddell</h3> Hey, everyone! I’m Lyz Liddell, <a href="https://twitter.com/lyzmaytweet/status/1296135733208465408?s=20" target="_blank">former</a> designer and editor for Pathfinder, back on the job to nurture my beautiful goth children: dhampirs! When I created this versatile lineage for the Advanced Player’s Guide, there was so much more we wanted to do than we had space for, so it was a delight to put those ideas into action for the Lost Omens Ancestry Guide. Dhampirs in fiction bear an unfortunate and long-held association with violence and loss, but I wanted to break those assumptions in Pathfinder so you have the freedom to tell any stories you want with these physically, socially, and emotionally complex characters. I hope you enjoy them!

                <h3>Ron Lundeen</h3> 
                <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, a developer on the Pathfinder Adventure Path line here at Paizo. I really wanted to write up the fleshwarps for this book, because they could be tentacled and gross. I initially thought of them only as grotesque creations for players who want to be a monster (which their ancestry feats really reflect), but as I thought about fleshwarps' place in the world, I realized that even these physically distinct people would have conventions, hopes, goals, and self-images of their own. Incorporating these thoughts made them a much deeper and more flavorful ancestry. With a fleshwarp, you can still "just be the monster," or you can explore what it means to have a shockingly inhuman appearance in a world of wonders and terrors. Plus, Gaping Flesh is maybe my favorite feat I've ever written. You can check out my RPG advice, including an entire free Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure Path I wrote, on my blog at <a href="http://runamokgames.com/" target="_blank">RunAmokGames.com</a>.

                <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> 
                <p>Hello from the US Southwest! I'm Andrew Mullen, who you might know from Old-Mage Jatembe's section of Lost Omens Legends and xulgath culture in the Extinction Curse Adventure Path. For Lost Omens Ancestry Guide, I worked on fetchlings and aphorites. I've always liked shadows' place in fantasy, but as someone who doesn't play much with the chaos/law axis, aphorites were a new challenge. I quite enjoyed thinking through what it means to have an intrinsic connection to order!<br> Ancestries aside, and assuming this blog presents authors in alphabetical order by last name, I'm going to scoop Mikhail's bit - we're working on a third-party project!<br> Was the world plunged into darkness because the prior civilization exsanguinated god to death, and when his eyes closed the stars went out? Was it because the wreckage of the gods' civil war blotted out the sky? In <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em>, there's no certain answer: this truth is a matter of faith. The Luminant Age is a Weird Fantasy world with a robust, nuanced take on fictional culture. But that level of detail doesn't mean an impenetrable mess of lore! We want players to be able to dive right into a game, even one that takes into account the power struggles and intrigues of a technological renaissance fueled by god's blood.<br> Oh, and we've got vampire anteater dogs and flying rays with gardens on their backs! Adorable!<br> Keep an eye on our Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a> - there's strange stuff on the horizon! </p>

                <p>Hi! I'm Jess, and this blog means I can finally tell everyone I'm the author of the geniekin versatile heritages for Ancestry Guide. This was a real dream for me! I'm not sure I can express how much of a joy the geniekin heritages were to write, and I hope you'll enjoy reading about and playing the elemental planar scions as much as I will.

                <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
                <p>Здравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! (Hello, dear readers!) My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may remember me from <em>Lost Omen Legends</em> (Baba Yaga) PFS 1-15 <em>Blooming Catastrophe</em>, and PFS 2-8 Frosty Mug, amongst a great deal of other writing. In my significantly more boring daily existence, I’m a Russian-American historian and educator, presently working in China.<br> In <em>LOAG</em>, I wrote the entries for the tieflings and the duskwalkers. Duskwalkers and I go way back—my very first assignment for Paizo was writing Duskwalker feats for the <em>Plane-Hopper’s Handbook</em>, and my first ‘big’ Paizo assignment was the <em>Half-Dead</em> backmatter in AP139 <em>The Dead Roads</em>.<br> Here and today, though, I want to mention a new project I’m working on, a bit outside of the Paizo umbrella. <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> is an upcoming third-party setting for Pathfinder Second Edition, a Weird Fantasy Swashbuckler set in a world without stars, where players will have a chance to set the course of history—or maybe just get run over by it, as the case may be.<br> It’s still early days, but we have a Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a> and plans for some fun stuff in the near future.<br> Досвидания! (Goodbye!)</p>

                <h3>David N. Ross</h3> 
                <p>I'm something of a jack-of-all-trades freelance writer and developer peddling novel rules, vibrant settings, and intrigue-laced adventures. This book is also a major milestone for me: my 50th contribution to Paizo's catalog! Although I'm best-known as a writer for Paizo's various lines, I also develop rules and write new content for other clients including Petersen Games, Raging Swan Press, AAW Games, Legendary Games, and a dozen more using rules for Pathfinder (both editions), Starfinder, and D&amp;D. This time, I'm excited to revisit catfolk and provide them with some new tricks! I previously wrote some of their <em>Inner sea Races</em> mechanics in first edition and helped flesh out their lore in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #152: Legacy of the Lost God</em>. My next major release will be my first Adventure Path installment, "Ready? Fight!" which comes out in May.

                <p>I'm Mark Seifter, Paizo's design manager and one of the four leads on the creation of Pathfinder Second Edition.<br> In Lost <em>Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, I created the sprites. I'm a big fan of fey, and I wanted to express that in this section. Plus, since I was also working on Bestiary 3, I was able to coordinate adding three brand new types of sprites in both books, as heritages and new creatures: Thanks to the creativity of Eleanor and Luis, we came up with draxie (dragon sprites), melixies (insect sprites, often bees), and nyktera (bat sprites)!<br> Check out my twitch stream with Linda Zayas-Palmer, Arcane Mark, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7PM Pacific, and Saturdays at 10 AM Pacific at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/arcanemark" target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/arcanemark</a>.

                <p>Our brand new company, Digital Dragon Studios, is dedicated to making apps that gamers love, and our very first offering is the Combat Tracker App for Pathfinder Second Edition. It’s all the goodness of the Pathfinder Combat Pad in a fantastic pocket-friendly app for you and your party to use everywhere you go. </p> 
                <p>We’ve done our best to ensure the app is as useful as it can be with features such as online play for long distance games, condition tracking, and Bluetooth connectivity for those times when the internet just isn’t an option. The app was created so that users from across the room or across the world can login together, see combat order, and hear the alert when combat advances. It can also be used solo by manually entering players in the Game Master Control Panel. Even better, both Android and Apple users can track combat together! </p> 
                <p>The Pathfinder Second Edition Combat Tracker app is currently available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pathfinder-2e-combat-tracker/id1553689267">Apple</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitaldragonstudios.rpgcombattracker">Google Play</a> stores, and you can keep up with current news regarding updates and future apps by following us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Digital-Dragon-Studios-100888535406058">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalDragonS3">Twitter</a>.</p> 
                <p>Wherever and however you game, we hope it’s epic, and our app makes your life a little easier.</p>

              <p>We are excited to return to a traditional metaplot for Starfinder Society Year 4. Scenarios that directly influence the Data Scourge metaplot will be marked with a special image. Scenarios without this branding are stand-alone adventures that do not tie into the events of Year of the Data Scourge. The metaplot kicks off with a scenario titled, appropriately, Year of the Data Scourge, written by yours truly, Jenny Jarzabski. If you have a PC in the levels 1-4 range and you’re ready to find out what this new season is all about, make sure you don’t miss this one! And if you don’t have a character made yet, what are you waiting for?!</p> 
              <p>In addition to our campaign’s new season, we’re pleased to announce that the Society’s efforts detailed in the Vast Experiment series have finally paid off! Starting in Year 4, Starfinders can choose to take the Society’s newest ship, the <b>Azata</b>, for a spin on their missions! </p>

                <center>
                 <p><b>Chapter One</b></p>
                </center> 
                <center>
                 <h2>DOWN AND OUT</h2>
                </center> 
                <p>Misree crawled out of an air duct and looked around the hangar bay, one of the cheapest and most cluttered on Absalom Station. She crouched behind a pile of spent energy cells and listened past the hiss of leaking hydraulic lines and the clang of someone banging on a bolt for anything that sounded... worrisome. Like, say, snippets of conversation between enforcers bent on capturing her. She didn’t pick up anything alarming.</p> 
                <p>There were two dozen ships in the bay, arrayed in uneven lines, from little one-person runabouts to bulky cargo vessels, and her own swift courier, the <em>Up and Out</em>, was way in the back, closest to the exit, just where she liked it. This was the kind of hangar where you had to pay your docking fees up front, so there was nothing stopping her from jumping on board, spinning up the engines, and racing out of here. Sure, coming back to the station without getting murdered on arrival would be tricky, but once she got her hands on some credits, she'd make paying back Zephonith her first—second—at least <em>third</em>—priority. In Misree's experience, enough credits could smooth over just about any difficulty. It was just a shame she always had more difficulties than credits lately.</p> 
                <p>Once she was confident the way was clear, Misree ran across the hangar toward her ship... and was within steps of the boarding ramp when a vesk shimmered out of some kind of stealth field and stood in her way, holding an immense wrench casually in one clawed hand. </p> 
                <p>Misree stopped short, very nearly colliding with the vesk, which would have made a bad situation even worse. She looked up (and up, and up) into the reptilian smile. The vesk was easily seven feet tall, while Misree was on the short side for a human. "Smeliel! I was just looking for you."</p> 
                <p>"Isn't that lucky," the vesk enforcer rumbled. "I was looking for you, too." She rapped the nose of the <em>Up and Out</em> with her wrench. "You weren't going to leave, were you? You have an appointment with our mutual employer, and I’m sure you don’t plan to keep her waiting."</p> 
                <p>Misree's smile slipped. "I don't work for Zephonith." Misree didn't work for anyone anymore. She charted her own course, made her own choices, and didn't have to answer to anyone—or answer for them, either. Flying solo was better in every way. Though it did mean, at times like this, that nobody had her back. </p> 
                <p>"Zephonith owns you, though." Smeliel crouched, bringing her closer to Misree's eye level. "Until you pay what's owed."</p> 
                <p>Misree had borrowed heavily from Zephonith to finance a heist, outfitting the <em>Up and Out</em> with the latest infiltration, stealth, and combat tech, all part of a plan to rob the orbital pleasure palace of a lashunta oligarch... but it turned out her contact sold the same security system plans and station blueprints to <em>another</em> crew: one that managed to strike a lot faster. The prize was stolen from Misree, which meant she didn’t have the capital to repay her loan, or even keep up with the eye-watering interest. "I'm going to pay,” Misree said. “In fact, I was just going out to scout a new job, so I’d have good news for Zephonith at our meeting."</p>&nbsp; 
                <p>Smeliel turned her head and looked at the ship. "You've got everything you need on here, don't you?" Her voice was full of undisguised admiration. "I had a word with the engineers you hired. The <em>Up and Out</em> is a custom-built flying crime spree. Seems a shame to leave it in such.... ineffectual hands."</p> 
                <p>Misree's guts went cold. "Smeliel, no, you can't—"</p> 
                <p>"Half the value of that vessel comes from upgrades you made with Zeph's money," the Vesk said, as if idly musing. "The other half... should pretty much cover the interest, plus a gratuity to thank my employer for not tossing you out an airlock for trying to run away today. In which case, you can just transfer the title, and we’re done." </p> 
                <p>Misree gritted her teeth. "You can't take my ship. She's all I've got. I poured my life into the <em>Up and Out</em>—"</p> 
                <p>Smeliel clamped an immense clawed hand on Misree's shoulder. "Then don't make me pour your life out all over this hangar deck."</p> 
                <p>Did you always want to be a hired thug? Was this your childhood dream? Beating people up for a crime boss?" Misree winced at herself. Sometimes her thoughts slipped out of her mouth before she could stop them. </p> 
                <p>"I'm a poet, actually," Smeliel said, grinding down on Misree’s shoulder. "That's why I left home, originally—my family didn't understand my dreams. But poetry doesn't pay very well. Not compared to enforcing the interests of a local entrepreneur. Sometimes you need a night job. I will say, doing this kind of work?" She showed all her serrated, triangular teeth. "It does give me a great deal of insight into the sapient condition, and that's helpful in my art. Maybe I'll write something about you—'An Ode to Misery.'"</p> 
                <p>"I've never heard a joke like <em>that</em> before," Misree said. "Can I at least get my stuff?"</p> 
                <p>"You don't have any stuff," Smeliel said. "You walk away with your life. And that deal is only good for the next minute or so. Transfer the title <em>now</em>."</p> 
                <p>Misree looked wistfully at the <em>Up and Out</em>—her home, her livelihood, and practically her only friend. But you had to know when to let things go, and “two seconds before a vesk enforcer splits your head open with a wrench” was an excellent time to do so. She tapped a command into her wrist-mounted computer and gave up her one true love.</p> 
                <p>Smeliel looked at a readout on her own datapad, grunted, and said, “Good choice. I hate getting blood all over my good wrench.” She made a shooing gesture. “I'd say 'Don't let me see you on this station again,' but since it's a big place, and you don't have access to a vehicle anymore, I'll settle for saying, 'Stay out of Zephonith's club.'"</p> 
                <p>“The drinks are overpriced anyway,” Misree muttered. </p> 
                <p>“True,” Smeliel said. “You couldn’t afford the cover charge anyway, now that I think about it. Stop loitering around my ship.”</p> 
                <p>Misree trudged out of the hangar. At least she didn’t have to sneak through air ducts and service tunnels anymore. She reviewed her assets. She still had a day left on the rental for the sleep-pod where she'd been hiding out from Zephonith. She had a change of clothes in the bag strapped to her back, an ultrathin switchblade in her pocket, and a few credsticks squirreled away here and there on the station—she'd learned early in life not to keep everything of value in one place. </p> 
                <p>That was the totality of her net worth, though, and it wasn’t enough to finance any kind of comeback or fresh start. Ugh. Would she be reduced to running short cons on tourists in bars? Or worse, rolling drunks and emptying their pockets? She’d never been into strongarm robbery, and it was a dangerous proposition. She knew a guy who’d mugged a defenseless-looking human who’d turned out to have an integrated cutting torch hidden in a cybernetic arm, and everybody called the mugger “Cyclops” now because he only had one eye left. But even robbery was a better option than hiring herself out to one of Zephonith's competitors, which was her only other plausible path to financial security. It was pretty easy to get a job with a crime boss when you had the kind of skills and résumé Misree did... but it was really hard to quit that job if you ever wanted to move on.</p> 
                <p>She turned onto a crowded thoroughfare, through a gray-market bazaar that filled a hub where three corridors intersected. She headed down an alley that led to her sleeping pod, one of two dozen stacked cubbyholes, each just barely big enough to sleep in. At least her pod was on the bottom level, so she didn’t have to climb a rickety ladder to reach—</p> 
                <p>Misree froze. The door to her cubby was ajar. In theory it was biometrically locked to her for the duration of her rental, but there were ways to spoof the locks, or you could always just bribe the manager. Who was inside? Another of Zephonith’s enforcers, one who hadn’t been called off yet? </p> 
                <p>She crouched beside an overflowing trash bin and watched her door swing all the way open. An android stepped out of her room—ebony skinned with a shining bald head of some silver alloy and bright yellow eyes, wearing a slick black overcoat. </p> 
                <p>Zephinoth never employed androids; Misree didn’t know why, but she assumed she’d been wronged by one too many androids on her climb up the crime boss career ladder. Which meant... this was some <em>other</em> kind of trouble.</p> 
                <p>The android turned his head, his stoic yellow eyes fixing immediately on her. “Misree Ludovic! I’ve been looking for you!”</p> 
                <p>Misree ran.</p>

               <p>The bonanza will be the last published Society adventure for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. From May, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society will join the Pathfinder Society (first edition) as a legacy program still available for convention support, but for which we will no longer produce new content. All scenarios will remain available for play and we will publish one last Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Game in early May which will include blog items such as adventure packs as well as a few rules revisions. Players may still report games on paizo.com and tables of Pathfinder Adventure Card Society will still count towards table limits for convention support.</p>

               <p><a href="/products/btq027oe">Pathfinder One-Shot: Sundered Waves</a> is the first of this product line and available for download at the Paizo Store right now! We hope that you’ll join us for this pirate adventure; it’s what our dear, departed Captain Renlock would have wanted!</p> 
               <p>We’ll follow that up with two more new One-Shot releases at PaizoCon 2021 — one for Pathfinder and one for Starfinder. You’ll hear more details about those in the weeks to come. </p> 
               <p>And now some Q&amp;A…</p> 
               <p><b>Will Paizo One-Shots be available as a subscription or in print?</b> We don’t have any plans to offer these adventures as a subscription or print product. </p> 
               <p><b>Will these be available on virtual tabletops?</b> With the high-resolution maps and image handouts included these should be easy to add to your favorite virtual tabletop. <a href="https://www.fantasygrounds.com/store/?sys=24">Fantasy Grounds</a> plans to have these available today, with other partners working on making these available natively on their platforms. Make sure to check in with your favorite VTT for an update. </p> 
               <p><b>Will these One-Shots be sanctioned by Organized Play?</b> Indeed they will be; in fact, you can download the sanctioning documents for Sundered Waves <a href="https://paizo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/OP-Sanctioning/Sundered+Waves+Sanctioning.pdf">right here</a>! We are adding the May releases to the PaizoCon schedule.</p> 
               <p>In celebration of this new release, Pathfinder Society Organized Play will be running a special Double Points weekend for Sundered Waves! All sessions of Sundered Waves run this weekend, <b>March 12-14</b>, will earn double the Achievement Points (8 points for players, 16 for GMs). Games must be reported by 9am Pacific on Wednesday, March 17; any games reported after that will not earn double points. Play-by-post games which begin during the weekend will also qualify; those GMs should email organizedplay@paizo.com after their games conclude and are reported to earn the additional rewards.</p>

               <h3>Botanical Wardens — CR 8</h3> 
               <p>A group of kiirintas (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026jv?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-4"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em></a> 62) botanists on Stabrisis-14 are creating an interstellar botanical garden, featuring plant species from all across Near Space. Leading this program is a headstrong kiirinta named K’voo za Vivza, whose ambitious nature and tendency to overreach has upset the Builders of the K’voo tribe.</p> 
               <p>When a shepherd blossom, a rare species of harpy jasmine from Castrovel, started exerting control over other plant creatures in the garden, Vivza was at a loss as to how to proceed. Her requests for aid have been ignored by the Builders, and the other Reflectors of the K’voo tribe aren’t equipped for such an aggressive task. The shepherd blossom has moved deep within the botanical garden and is using a small cadre of carnivorous plant to defend itself against all intruders. Vivza turns to the PCs for help, hoping they can end the shepherd blossom’s control over the other plant creatures, but desperately hopes that they can preserve the other plants in the area. She hopes that by disrupting the shepherd blossom, the other plant creatures will cease to be hostile and can be guided back to their portions of the garden.</p> 
               <p><b>Creatures</b>: A single mature shepherd blossom has gathered other aggressive plant creatures around itself, intending to keep them there until it is ready to pollinate the area with fresh buds. It has managed to gather two lumocanthas from the Veskarium Gardens exhibit and a single supenga pup from the nearby Desert Garden enclosure. While the resulting bloom of several shepherd blossoms might be interesting, it would cause enough chaos in Vivza’s Near Space botanical garden project to shut it down permanently. The supenga pup stays near the shepherd blossom, ready to pursue any threats while the two lumocanthas stand near the hiking trails nearby, ready to fire their laser spines on anything that moves.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84f193d0-f47e-4c98-b7f6-da6a991d50d5/030521_SheperdBlossom.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84f193d0-f47e-4c98-b7f6-da6a991d50d5/030521_SheperdBlossom.jpg" align="left" width="50%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A large, bulbous pink plant resembling the maw of a vicious predator"></a>

                <li>6/day—<em>charm person</em> (DC 16), <em>lesser confusion</em> (DC 16), <em>wisp ally</em></li>

               </ul> <b>Offensive Abilities</b> verdant call
               <p></p> 
               <p><b>Tactics</b><br> <b>Before Combat</b> The shepherd blossom stays near its plot, hoping to bud soon. However, it continuously searches for more plant creatures to help protect itself during its reproductive cycle.<br> <b>During Combat</b> The shepherd blossom uses verdant call on any plant creatures not under their control, otherwise they uses their magic to ward off powerful creatures or befriend them and convince them to care for their offspring.<br> <b>Morale</b> The shepherd blossom protects its young buds until death.</p> 
               <p><b>Statistics</b><br> <b>Str</b> +5; <b>Dex</b> +0; <b>Con</b> +3; <b>Int</b> –3; <b>Wis</b> +1; <b>Cha</b> +2<br> <b>Skills</b> Athletics +11</p> 
               <p><b>Special Abilities</b><br> <b>Verdant Call (Su)</b> Once per day as a full-round action, a shepherd blossom can create psychic echoes that resonate with nearby plant creatures, creating an intense feeling of empathy for the shepherd blossom. This functions as a 5th-level <em>dominate person</em> spell (CL 5th, Will DC 15) but only affects plant creatures. The shepherd blossom can target any single plant creature it is aware of within 600 feet.</p> 
               <br> 
               <h4>Lumocantha (2)— CR 2</h4>

               <br> <b>During Combat</b> The lumocanthas focus their laser spines on any creature stained by one of their dye capsules, otherwise they fire on the closest non-plant that has moved from their square in the last round.
               <br> <b>Morale</b> These plants fight until destroyed as long as the shepherd blossom lives. As soon as the shepherd blossom is destroyed, or if the lumocanthas are otherwise moved out of the range of its verdant call, they become docile.
               <p></p> 
               <br> 
               <h4>Supenga Pup — CR 5</h4> 
               <p><b>XP 1,600</b><br> <b>HP</b> 75 (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026jv?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-4"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em></a> 120)</p> 
               <p><b>Tactics</b><br> <b>Before Combat</b> The supenga patrols around the shepherd blossom’s glade, searching for predators.<br> <b>During Combat</b> The supenga pup focuses its attention on whatever creature is attacking the shepherd blossom, or whatever creature is closest to the blossom; the supenga generally ignores paralyzed targets.<br> <b>Morale</b> This plant fights until destroyed as long as the shepherd blossom lives. As soon as the shepherd blossom is destroyed, or if the supenga is otherwise moved out of the range of its verdant call, it becomes docile.</p>

               <h2>OPM Musings</h2> 
               <p itemprop="description">I really believe we are caught in a time loop. I am absolutely certain I wrote my February musings last week. The past month’s flurry of activity involved much planning - we are just a week away from revealing information regarding Starfinder Society Year 4, and we’ve mapped a solid plan for Pathfinder Society Year 3. PaizoCon planning is moving forward, which means convention season is well under way, and we’ve got a few upcoming announcements on that front. In addition, we’re talking to our pals at Know Direction about appearing on their show. Plus a few more still undisclosed projects that we hope to share shortly! </p> 
               <p>Be sure to keep your eyes on the blogs as March will bring many announcements and I don’t want any of our community members to miss the great information we have to share. </p> 
               <h2>PaizoCon Volunteers</h2> 
               <p>The first day of GM signups saw over 90% of our offered games filled. Plan is to add more games on the Warhorn, then do round 2 of signups. We will continue until we run out of GMs. Last year, we ran over 800 games. Let’s see if we can top that this year! Anyone who wants to join the GM or HQ teams should visit the <a jref="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/popvo/">Organized Play Foundation’s website</a> for volunteer benefit information and to access the registration form. From there, the organizing committee reviews the form information and sends an email acceptance outlining the next steps. If you want to participate in wave two of registrations, be sure to complete the form by noon Friday, March 5th. There is no last day to volunteer, but spaces are filled on a first registered basis and GMs get access to player registration 24 hours early (March 31) alongside Warhorn VIPs.</p> 
               <p>Anyone wanting to play at PaizoCon can register for badges in advance of the April 1st player signup date; to do so, visit the <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-2021">PaizoCon Warhorn</a> and follow the instructions on the main page.</p> 
               <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
               <p>Last week, we posted <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shla?February-Sanctioning-Update-Lost-Omens">an update on our sanctioning progress</a>, and we already have an update to that post. Bestiary 2 is now sanctioned on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options</a> page and is available to use! It joins the <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, <em>The Slithering</em> and all our previous rulebooks as usable Pathfinder Society material. Our next focus is <em>Bestiary 3</em> as well as the <em>Abomination Vaults</em> Adventure Path.</p> 
               <p>We’ve got new Character Options pages for Starfinder Society in the works to replace the current pdf Additional Resources document. When that rolls out (maybe even this month, if everything aligns), it will include new sanctioning for <em>Alien Archive 4</em>. After that, we’ll look to catch up with the <em>Devastation Ark</em> and <em>Fly Free or Die</em> Adventure Paths as well as investigate sanctioning the Starfinder Beginner Box.</p> 
               <p>On the Pathfinder (first edition) front. Our hope is to produce sanctioning documents out for the remaining content by the end of the summer, but that will depend on available time as convention season ramps up.</p> 
               <h2>GM Achievements</h2> 
               <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
               <p>Two GMs received their fifth nova in the past month. We have no new 5 Star or 5 Glyph GMs to announce.</p> 
               <p><b>5th Nova</b>: <em>John Godek</em> and <em>Nils Janson</em></p> 
               <p>Congratulations to our new 5 Nova GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com</p> 
               <h2>Conventions</h2> 
               <p>In addition to PaizoCon Online, we have a number of conventions offering Pathfinder and Starfinder Society! </p>

               <h3>Phinelli’s Miracle Elixir — Severe 3</h3> 
               <p>Edolpho Phinelli, the notorious con artist, has developed a new scheme. He’s selling an elixir that he claims can heal wounds, erase scars, and regrow hair. The citizens that live in the red light district are buying it by the case-full. Edolpho is looking to get rich quick! Fast enough to hop on a ship out of the city with enough earnings to set himself up in a new town.</p> 
               <p>The elixir is, of course, a watered-down minor elixir of life mixed with several inexpensive alchemical reagents. The effects are an intense euphoria followed by a heavy hangover unless more of the elixir is ingested. He’s selling each dose for 1 gp. While the brew does restore 1d2–1 Hit Points, the fumes the imbiber belches carry tuberculosis (<em>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide 118</em>), exposing themselves and anyone around them for 1 hour after they’ve consumed the elixir.</p> 
               <p>An outbreak of tuberculosis has started to spread throughout the district and the city guard are getting desperate. They suspect that this new “miracle cure” might have something to do with it, but their forces are spread thin due to the disease and a long-standing labor dispute. They’ve hired the adventurers to investigate and point them toward Edolpho’s last known location—a shipping crate dais overlooking the canal.</p> 
               <p><b>Creatures</b>: Edolpho stands above a crowd of roughly a dozen onlookers, waving his arms and barking his well-rehearsed pitch. Two burly assistants flank the charlatan, holding up vials of his wares and waving them enticingly in the audience’s faces. If the adventurers approach him looking to incite violence, then Edolpho’s two “assistants” step in to carry out their true role as bodyguards, putting themselves between the PCs and their employer, and trying to push any attackers into the adjacent canal. Given his control of the rapt crowd and the carefully staged environment, Edolpho uses Performance instead of Perception when rolling initiative.</p> 
               <p>He also attempts to turn the fervent (and quite addicted) crowd against the adventurers. If the adventurers succeed at a DC 18 Diplomacy or Deception check to persuade the crowd that the elixir is toxic, then the commoners disperse as soon as violence commences. Otherwise, they fervently attempt to defend their elixir supplier.</p> 
               <p>Any commoner who is damaged immediately flees. If the bodyguards reach 5 Hit Points or fewer, they surrender. Edolpho attempts to flee if he reaches 10 Hit Points or fewer but refuses to surrender.

               <p>But this book has more than new ancestries. It’s chock-full of new lore, heritages, and feats to expand the ancestries and versatile heritages from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide">Advanced Player’s Guide</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Pathfinder Lost Omens: Character Guide</a>--so if your character’s ancestry and heritage aren’t from the Core Rulebook, there’s probably something new for you on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options</a> page! One of the ancestries featured in this book, the azarketi, will be featured in a book that hasn't been released yet: Absalom, City of Lost Omens. In the meantime, the ancestry’s rules appear as a <a href="https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/Azarketi+Ancestry.pdf">free download here</a>, and we’ve gone ahead and sanctioned them as well.</p> 
               <p>Speaking of expanding your horizons beyond the Core Rulebook’s ancestries, you can now receive Pathfinder Society credit for playing <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering">The Slithering</a>. Play as a kobold, lizardfolk, orc, or catfolk on a quest to save the city of Kibwe from a horrific curse. This brings us current in sanctioning Pathfinder Adventures for credit in the Pathfinder Society.</p> 
               <p>This month’s update to the Character Options page also includes updates to the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp4?Pathfinder-Bestiary">Pathfinder Bestiary</a>. The update to the Bestiary opens up the Bestiary languages to characters who have means of learning uncommon languages, like your Multilingual PCs. I know folks are wondering about Bestiary 2 as well. We’ve started work on it, but it’s a bigger project, so we’ll need a bit more time. Once that’s ready, we’ll be sure to let you know.</p> 
               <p>We’re still working on the next project for Starfinder sanctioning and will have more information in the March update blog next week.</p>

               <h3>Expanded Ancestries and Heritages</h3> 
               <p>The first half of the book provides an in-depth look at ancestries and versatile heritages that premiered in previous book. Each entry presents information on how each ancestry or heritage fits in the Lost Omens setting as well as provide new ancestry feats, heritages, and lineages. The section includes the following entries.</p> 
               <p><b>Aasimar (Calder CaDavid):</b> Aasimars result from celestial influence, but only rarely are they literally descended from celestials, more often coming from special blessings or the residual energies in holy places. This book presents three new lineages, emberkin, idyllkin, and plumekith, for aasimars descended from peris, agathions, and garudas respectively.</p> 
               <p><b>Azarketi (Jessica Catalan):</b> Often known as “gillmen” or “Low Azlanti,” azarketis are the descendants of the Azlanti Empire. They survived Earthfall by being mutated by their foes, the alghollthus, to become an aquatic people tied forever to seas and waterways—but their history draws them back to the land. This book presents new azarketi options, exploring their magical connection to water and adds the inured, murkeyed, spined, and tactile azarketi heritages.</p> 
               <p>Check out the Azarketi ancestry today with this <a href="https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/Azarketi+Ancestry.pdf">pdf download</a>!</p> 
               <p><b>Catfolk (David N. Ross):</b> Native to the nation of Murraseth in southern Garund, catfolk are feline humanoids who believe they were created to hunt down threats to Golarion as a whole. This book presents new options to double down on catfolk’s agility and luck and adds the flexible, liminal, and sharp-eared catfolk heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Changeling (Isabelle Thorne):</b> The offspring of wicked hags, changelings are often left in the cradles of their mortal parent’s people and raised without understanding what makes them different. They often feel disconnected from their communities early in life, the subtle call of their hag mother coaxing them to abandon those they love. This book presents the moon may, snow may, veil may, and virga may lineages for changelings descended from moon hags, winter hags, blood hags, and storm hags respectively.</p> 
               <p><b>Dhampir (Lyz Liddell):</b> Dhampirs are mortals descended from a living and a vampiric parent. Marked forever by their hungers, some may learn to draw strength from the blood of others, while others drink subtler substances, such as pain. This book presents three new lineages, adhyabhau, cel rau, and ru-shi, for dhampirs descended from psychic, strigoi, and jiang-shi vampires.</p> 
               <p><b>Duskwalker (Mikhail Rekun):</b> Reincarnated souls, duskwalkers gained leave to have one more chance at life. All duskwalkers have strong connections to their previous identities, but each must decide for themselves whether to learn more about their past or forge a new path. This book contains options for duskwalkers based on how their previous life ended.</p> 
               <p><b>Hobgoblin (Owen K.C. Stephens):</b> Many hobgoblins have been drawn toward the nation of Oprak, which seeks to forge pacts and earn respect through methods other than war and conquest. While clearly related to their goblin cousins, hobgoblins are less frenetic and more careful planners. This book contains options for hobgoblins to assist their fellow warriors or to tap into the legendary Cantorian Spring—the source of the hobgoblin ancestry—to gain healing effects. It also introduces the shortshanks and steelskin hobgoblin heritages.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c1266455-b649-4567-b8ee-bb277569c79b/022421_cactusleshy.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c1266455-b649-4567-b8ee-bb277569c79b/022421_cactusleshy.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A cactus leshy. This living cactus is squat and spherical with a small flower on the top of its head."></a>
               <p style="font-size: 13px;">Art by Alex Stone</p> 
               <p><b>Kobold (Owen K.C. Stephens):</b> These expert trap makers often live in secluded places that most other ancestries eschew. Kobolds operate in a world of larger, stronger creatures who often dismiss them—until these cunning survivors reveal what they can unleash on their foes. This book contains options for kobolds to improve their use of traps and kobold weapons, and even to grow draconic wings. It also includes the caveclimber and tunnelflood kobold heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Leshy (Linda Zayas-Palmer):</b> Leshys are immortal spirits temporarily given mortal forms in bodies made of plants and fungi. Created by powerful primal rituals, leshys come into the world fully formed and self-sufficient, independent of any settlement or even the ritualist that gave them form. This book grows the leshy options by adding the cactus, fruit, lotus, root, and seaweed leshy heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Lizardfolk (Patchen Mortimer):</b> The powerful reptilian lizardfolk call themselves iruxi and have a history that stretches back thousands of years. Patient and confident, lizardfolk explorers travel from their ancient nations to explore the world of younger ancestries and kingdoms. This book contains options for lizardfolk to gain insights from astrology or power from the bones of their ancestors and adds the cloudleaper and woodstalker lizardfolk heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Orc (Calder CaDavid):</b> Orcs were driven from their homelands by the dwarven Quest for Sky and thrust into a foreign world where they had to carve a place for themselves. A troubled history of warfare and grudges has left most orcs at odds with other surface ancestries. This book contains options for orcs to gain power from special painted warmasks. It also introduces the battle-ready, grave, and winter orc heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Ratfolk (Patchen Mortimer):</b> Small rodentlike humanoids, ratfolk are clever, adaptive, and communalist. Known amongst themselves as ysoki, ratfolk are natural explorers, travelers, and, most of all, merchants. This book contains options for ratfolk to squish, sneak, roll, and otherwise move about. It also adds the snow and tunnel rat heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Tengu (Eleanor Ferron):</b> The beaked and feathered tengu originate from Tian Xia. Nearly always in the minority, tengu have learned to use their knack for languages and blades to find space for themselves. This book contains options for tengu to store magic in specially made fans and adds the dogtooth and wavediver tengu heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Tiefling (Mikhail Rekun):</b> Tieflings are planar scions born with a fiendish stain in their blood. Though tieflings are not inherently evil, they are often mistrusted and many do find that fiendish powers and associated temptations come easily. This book presents the beastbrood, riftmarked, and shackleborn lineages for tieflings descended from rakshasas, qlippoths, and velstracs respectively.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7bd85011-51db-4e3f-af37-57669668fdd9/022421_enshrakorc.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7bd85011-51db-4e3f-af37-57669668fdd9/022421_enshrakorc.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="An Enshrak orc.

               <h3>New Ancestries and Heritages</h3> 
               <p>The latter half of the book introduces new ancestries and heritages to Pathfinder Second Edition. Some of these entries include old favorites making their second edition premiere and even includes some brand new entries, each with their own rules options. The section includes the following entries.</p> 
               <p><b>Android (Jessica Catalan):</b> Brought to Golarion by a starship crash in the land of Numeria, androids are half organic, half-machine lifeforms produced by alien technology. Though often looked upon with fear by superstitious communities surrounding the crash site, changing politics and the rise of the android goddess Casandalee have led to androids expanding their influence in nearby regions. The section includes feats that allow androids to tap into the power of their nanites and the artisan, impersonator, laborer, polyglot, and warrior android heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Aphorite (Andrew Mullen):</b> Aphorites are beings with a mortal base infused with the pure essence of law by the enigmatic axiomites of Axis. Originally designed to form a diplomatic bridge between the perfect logic of the axiomites and the constant contradictions of free-willed creatures, aphorites’ ability to choose has seen them grow beyond their original intent and into their own people. This versatile heritage allows a character use the crystalline motes that cover their body to conceal themselves or their allies.</p> 
               <p><b>Beastkin (Luis Loza):</b> While most werecreatures are cursed with bloodlust at the sight of the full moon, some of their kin are born without this dire affliction. These beastkin are a source of respect and envy among their fellows, as they also lack werecreatures’ burning vulnerability to silver. This versatile heritage allows for characters with a connection of animals of any type that can tap into their animalistic instincts and senses.</p> 
               <p><b>Fetchling (Andrew Mullen):</b> Fetchlings are scions of Ancient Azlant who escaped the cataclysm of Earthfall by fleeing to the Shadow Plane. As generations passed, more and more supernatural gloom seeped into these refugees until they evolved into something beyond their human origins. Fetchlings can gain control over their shadows and are shaped by the bright, deep, liminal, resolute, and wisp fetchling heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Fleshwarp (Ron Lundeen):</b> Fleshwarps are beings transformed either by magic or by technology beyond Golarion’s ken. Most commonly, they result from drow or other sinister forces transforming their victims out of sadism, yet fleshwarps can also be created from scratch through magical or alchemical manipulation of raw tissue. Fleshwarps are capable of transforming their bodies further to gain darkvision or grow new weapons. Depending on the nature of their transformation, a fleshwarp will have the created, mutated, shapewrought, or technological fleshwarp heritage.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/832395d7-dd45-495d-ba1f-4bbc1b2669fc/022421_eaglekin.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/832395d7-dd45-495d-ba1f-4bbc1b2669fc/022421_eaglekin.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="An eaglekin.

               <p><b>Ganzi (Isabelle Thorne):</b> Born wherever and whenever they’re least expected, these scions of chaos rarely conform to any overarching culture among themselves. Ganzi reside in the greatest numbers in the nation of Holomog, with their influence spilling out into Nex, Geb, and the Mwangi Expanse. The ganzi versatile heritage allows characters to tap into the power of chaos and produce random magic or new body parts.</p> 
               <p><b>Geniekin (Jessica Redekop):</b> Kin to the elements and infused with the power of the planes within the Inner Sphere, geniekin live scattered all over the world, especially wherever extreme environments provide a conduit to primal energy. Most commonly found in Katapesh and Qadira, many geniekin gather in small communities both within and outside of major cities. Geniekin include five new versatile heritages: ifrits, keepers of elemental fire; oreads, wardens of elemental earth; sylphs, followers of the freedom of elemental air; undines, individuals adaptable like elemental water; and sulis, embodiments of the complex relationships between multiple elements.</p> 
               <p><b>Kitsune (James Case):</b> Kitsune change shapes as easily as clothing, often living undetected among other peoples. Though these mischievous tricksters almost never gather in numbers large enough for political clout, their natural charisma and cunning mean they can have a significant impact on worldly events. Kitune are wielders of powerful magic and have the celestial envoy, dark fields, earthly wilds, empty sky, and frozen wind kitsune heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Sprite (Mark Seifter):</b> As denizens of the First World, sprites sometimes tire of their realm where choices hold no permanence and consequences don’t matter. These Tiny fey venture into the Material Plane in hopes of making their own mark. Sprites can empower their wings to grant them flight and sprite heritages vary to include draxies, grigs, luminous sprites, melixies, nykterasm, and pixies.</p> 
               <p><b>Strix (Samantha Phelan):</b> These avian humanoids maintain small populations within Cheliax and the surrounding environs. Long persecuted by the humanocentric rule of House Thrune, strix have been enemies of the Chelaxian state for almost a century. This section provides feats that allow strix to take to the skies and attack with their wings, as well as the nightglider, predator, scavenger, shoreline, and songbird strix heritages.</p> 
               <p><b>Ancestral Gear (Luis Loza):</b> The book’s final section provides new weapons and magic items with ties to the ancestries of Golarion.</p>

               <h3>Vizaix, Reluctant Mercenary</h3> 
               <p>Vizaix owes his life to a ysoki scavenger named Arlos who helped him narrowly escape being press-ganged by Akitonian munitions smugglers. Vizaix is known to smile at Arlos’s jokes from time to time and even calls the ysoki his friend, but he has trouble believing other people like him, given gnolls’ reputations as bloodthirsty cannibals. It doesn’t help that Vizaix has trouble reading others’ emotions and intentions—he relies heavily on Arlos in most social situations.</p> 
               <p>Arlos recently encouraged Vizaix to put his skills to good use, explore Near Space, and make a few more friends. The gnoll is offering his services as a mercenary, hired security, or hunter, especially with smaller crews where he won’t have to remember so many names. When he wants to ease into conversations with potential employers, Vizaix tells one of Arlos’s jokes—even if he doesn’t “get” them himself, he has found that the jokes help others see him as more than just a gnoll and a soldier.</p> 
               <p>When he is overstimulated—especially after a battle or heated social confrontation—Vizaix needs several minutes alone to calm his anger. He recenters himself by methodically checking his equipment and muttering punchlines. Though he is uncomfortable around others, he values teamwork and has a stronger sense of personal accountability and morality than many gnolls, especially when it comes to his companions.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9dbed918-6aca-4ef8-b98a-ffd2e72bb6ab/022421_Gnoll.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9dbed918-6aca-4ef8-b98a-ffd2e72bb6ab/022421_Gnoll.jpg" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A hyena-headed humanoid wears yellow, futuristic armor and wields a space rifle."></a>

               <h3>Plot Hooks</h3> 
               <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Vizaix into any Starfinder game.</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Vizaix has learned that his most recent employers are using funds from their last job to fund an illegal poaching outfit. He has inside knowledge about their plans, and their ship, but he needs help to sabotage their efforts.</li> 
                <li>The ysoki, Arlos, is looking for someone to go in search of Vizaix, who was working security on a starship in the Diaspora that has been missing for 3 months.</li> 
                <li>Vizaix hates the instability of mercenary life, but he is having trouble getting more permanent employment. He asks to accompany the PCs on a mission, hoping his association with them leads to further opportunities.</li> 
               </ul>

           <p itemprop="description">Hey everyone! Michael Sayre here, ready to discuss the Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears playtest that just wrapped up!

               <p itemprop="description">Hey everyone! Michael Sayre here, ready to discuss the Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears playtest that just wrapped up! We’ve had some time to go over the survey results and contextualize all of the amazing posts, videos, and playtest reports you all shared during the course of the playtest. Now that we’ve had a chance to go over that data ourselves and make some decisions, we’re here to talk to you a bit about the direction we’d like to take. Keep in mind, while we’re going to talk about some broad points here, there are likely to be dozens of little changes throughout both classes—covering everything from adding more feats and class options to minor tweaks in the way existing abilities or options function.

Also, feel free to stick around to the end of the blog to check out a preview of one of the cool new options that’ll be included in the final release of Guns &amp; Gears!</p> 
               <h3>Gunslinger</h3> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f68010b7-5697-402c-8ccc-b840849b0b0d/012221_PZO2109_Gunslinger01.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f68010b7-5697-402c-8ccc-b840849b0b0d/012221_PZO2109_Gunslinger01.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="pathfinder guns and gears second edition playtest gunslinger iconic with a large rifle over her shoulder"></a> 
               <p>Not surprisingly, a lot of the feedback on the gunslinger focused on the execution of firearms and the Reload mechanic. We also collected some really remarkable data related to the gunslinger ways, so I want to be sure to spend some time exploring what that data could mean for us going forward. Finally, I’m going to talk a bit about the types of gear that weren’t present in the playtest, but that should have a significant impact thanks to inclusion in the final release.</p> 
               <p><b>Firearms</b>: Firearms remain a divisive subject when it comes to fantasy roleplaying games, and this particular iteration was no exception, though we did learn some interesting information. The first and most relevant data point suggests that the version of guns we have in the playtest are far and away the most popular choice for how people want to see firearms executed in this edition, so we’re going to stick pretty close to that model. That being said, there are opportunities for improvement here.</p> 
               <p>The first thing I’ll note is that the final version of <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> is going to have more than double the number of firearms than the playtest had. This is going to include things like one-handed scatter weapons and guns that fire big, relatively slow-moving rounds that have a higher base damage die but no fatal property. We also plan to incorporate quite a few other variations on the theme that you’ll have to wait to see more of in the final book!</p> 
               <p>We also embraced a conservative approach to firearm design going into this playtest, keeping the ranges very tight to represent the relative inaccuracy of these kinds of smooth bore weapons and using primarily preexisting weapon traits that people already know how to use. As we go through and develop all of the firearms, we’ll consider opportunities to explore these options: such as extending the range of a few different weapons, potentially introducing new traits that do a better job of telling the story of a firearm, and addressing small oversights in the playtest options. For example, the penalty and action cost for unsteady probably shouldn’t apply to a prone character, so adding that clarification should enhance the usability of unsteady weapons while also adding interesting new dynamics to feats like Hit the Dirt!</p> 
               <p><b>Reload</b>: Reload times inspired a lot of constructive debate during the playtest. Many people found that they were an important part of the story of firearms and greatly preferred the tone and era of weapons we used in the playtest, feeling that they were a more natural fit for a fantasy world than things like revolvers and cartridge-loaded rifles. Others felt like the action cost of reloading was a real stumbling block that got in the way a player making the character they wanted. Running Reload was an incredibly popular feat choice for really helping people maximize the value of that action. Consequently, we’re looking at granting each of the gunslinger ways their own unique Reload action. For example, gunslingers who choose the way of the sniper could receive a built-in action to Reload and Hide or Take Cover. We’ll also likely use some of the additional feats that will appear in the final version of the class to expand your options for more robust Reload activities even more, giving gunslingers a highly efficient action economy with lots of ways to interact with the battlefield.</p> 
               <p><b>Gunslinger Ways</b>: So, normally in any playtest for a class that has multiple “subpath” options, there’s a clear first-place choice that selected significantly more often by players. That was not the case with the gunslinger ways. While there were small variations between the number of people choosing a given way, they were each so close to a third of the total respondents that it was clear that each of these concepts has just as much draw and appeal as the others. As a result, it’s pretty likely that each of these ways will be present in the final release, though with some changes informed by the experiences from this playtest. A lot of the feedback we received also suggested some possibilities for new ways that weren’t featured in the playtest, so we’ll be looking into those as well. Expect these concepts to stick around but their execution to evolve in multiple ways (pun intended) going forward.</p> 
               <p><b>Gear</b>: This is one area where I wish we’d just had a little more time before the playtest to show you what we’ve got lined up, as I think that would have had a really positive impact on some playtesters’ experiences. That said, I think this is as good a place to give you a sneak peek at what’s ahead as any. First, let me just say this. Yes, we plan to include bayonets in the final release. </p> 
               <p>More than that, we’re looking at an entire section of the book that explores black powder and the things you can do with it (like leaving a trail of powder you can light on fire to blow up a powder keg) and the things you can’t (like igniting it underwater). We are going to include cool options and accessories you can use to customize your gun, though, and that’ll feature options for using your preferred weapon in just about any environment, including underwater. We’re looking at all kinds of choices for accessories, from scopes to holsters, bandoliers to weaponized bipod/tripods, and just about anything else you can think of to customize your gunslinger. There’s always going to be more cool ideas for a product than you can fit into the page count, but we’ll continue to provide players as much variety and as many unique avenues for their character builds as we can.</p> 
               <p>And that’s about all I’ve got for you at the moment. I’ll pass this over to Mark so he can talk about the inventor!</p> 
               <h3>Inventor</h3> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/416ab8c5-fddc-4d79-9d17-efe8b55fc86d/012221_PZO2109_Inventor01.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/416ab8c5-fddc-4d79-9d17-efe8b55fc86d/012221_PZO2109_Inventor01.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="pathfinder guns and gears second edition playtest inventor iconic with with a small construct"></a>

              </blockquote>
             </div> 
             <p>Hi everyone! Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the inventor class. I want to start off by thanking you all so much for your feedback, and especially for the way you've given it to us. At the start of the playtest, I mentioned that since we had two playtests so close to each other, we needed the community's help to avoid too many circular arguments and focus on new data and analyses on various topics. And boy did you deliver! So thank you for giving us great data, ideas, and feedback. This helps make it easy for us to follow along and incorporate your ideas. In terms of the ratio of insights to arguments, this playtest has one of the best I've ever seen, and that starts with you. </p> 
             <p>Overall people really liked the inventor, almost as much as the swashbuckler with a big gap before the summoner, gunslinger, and a few others that are clustered below. But that doesn't mean that there aren't things about the class that need to change. Brigh knows, I even announced in the “Welcome to the Inventor” thread that unstable had to change after we accidentally didn't use the version asked about in the survey! Thank you for bearing with me on this journey and also at looking past the roughness with unstable to really dig deep on every other aspect of the class, which needed a close eye too.</p> 
             <p><b>Unstable</b>: The unstable trait will change. My goal is to make the trait present a gamble that weighs risk versus reward. Unlike the playtest version, you'll always get to perform the action when you take the risk. The gamble will be whether something goes wrong, causing something bad to happen in addition to the action succeeding. I have one very exciting idea for this that I can't share yet until I'm sure it works. In the meantime, if you want to keep playing your inventor in your home game, you can just roll the flat check after you use the unstable ability (including the first time) to see if you can use it again. I'm hoping the final version will be more exciting than that, but that should work okay for now. </p> 
             <p><b>Gadgets</b>: We will be adding a fun gadgets feat path for the inventor to make special gadgets each day! It won't be mandatory, as most playtesters expressed that they didn’t want it to be. It will be nice to include it as an option so a player can opt in to the complexity that comes with having to read through a big gadget section.</p> 
             <p><b>Innovations</b>: Playtesters asked for more options for modifications and feats for innovations, and the final version will add more of them. All of you inventor playtesters really captured the weird science vibe and had some great ideas, and I took careful and extensive notes. For example, giving the construct companion with a ranged attack a "turret mode" option sounds like a lot of fun, and playtesters had some great ideas for ways to increase the construct's abilities at the expense of the inventor's actions. This helps lend support the playstyle of inventors who want to hang back and let the construct do the work. In that vein, I'm strongly considering giving the construct innovation inventor the baked in ability to spend two actions to give the construct three. This will allow the construct to move and Explode, for example, and helps avoid friendly fire.</p> 
             <p><b>Overdrive</b>: While the inventor's special powers are dispersed throughout several abilities, playtesters were interested in consolidating a little more of them into Overdrive, and that's something I'm definitely looking into. If that occurs, expect to see Overdrive scale a bit more than it does now, especially on a success. Hopefully, I’ll be able to do so just enough to make a big difference.</p> 
             <p>These are just a few of the ways in which I'm tinkering and tweaking my invention thanks to your notes and efforts. In the end, expect the class to look extremely similar to the way it does right now, except with several little improvements in almost every area that will really add up in the long run. </p> 
             <p>Thanks for reading! For sticking to the end, we’re throwing in an advance treat from the book, an intelligent weapon! The final version is very likely to be one of the new types of gun in the book, but this version for the blog uses the basic pistol so you can throw it into your game right away and have it start mouthing off at enemies.</p> 
             <h4>Sunken Pistol — Item 8</h4> 
             <p><b>Rare, CN, Arcane, Enchantment, Intelligent</b><br> </p>
             <p><b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; Bulk 1<br> <b>Perception</b> +12; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet<br> <b>Communication</b> speech (Common)<br> <b>Skills</b> Intimidation +19, Navigation Lore +14, Sailing Lore +14<br> <b>Int</b> +0, <b>Wis</b> +2, <b>Cha</b> +4<br> <b>Will</b> +16</p> 
             <p>A <em>sunken pistol</em> is imbued with the unfulfilled desires and insatiable greed of its previous wielder, a notorious pirate drowned at sea. Once a beautiful and artistically wrought weapon, a <em>sunken pistol</em> is coated in a fine layer of dried salt and is encrusted with barnacles. Each shot fired from this <em>+1 striking flintlock pistol</em> is coated in a layer of salty ectoplasm, and has the effects of a ghost touch rune. You can shoot the <em>sunken pistol</em> underwater, even when using black powder ammunition.</p> 
             <p>A <em>sunken pistol</em> urges you to amass a horde of treasure even a dragon would be proud of. The methods used to acquire these riches matter not to the greedy pirate pistol, so long as you amass and hoard excessive wealth. Above all else, a <em>sunken pistol</em> desires the return of its own treasure, which might rest in the wreck of its sunken ship’s hold or be hidden on a dangerous island.</p> 
             <p>In pursuit of treasure, a <em>sunken pistol</em> offers nautical and navigation advice to you, though it refuses such aid during less lucrative ventures. If you prove a profitable partner, the <em>sunken pistol</em> aids you in combat by Demoralizing your opponents (see the first Activation below). If you prove charitable or unwilling to retrieve its treasure, the <em>sunken pistol</em> turns its ire on you, Demoralizing you during combat until you relent. If you repeatedly refuse the <em>sunken pistol</em>, it would be wise to not accept <em>water breathing</em> from it, as it might attempt to drown you to allow a more suitable wielder to acquire it from your corpse. The sunken pistol can use the following activations.</p> 
             <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] command; <b>Frequency</b> once per minute; <b>Effect</b> The <em>sunken pistol</em> curses and insults a creature it can see, attempting an Intimidation check to Demoralize that creature.</p> 
             <p><b>Activate</b> [three-actions] command; <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b> The <em>sunken pistol</em> casts <em>water breathing</em> on you as a 3rd-level arcane spell. The <em>sunken pistol</em> can Dismiss this spell, so be sure to keep the gun happy if you’re relying on its good graces to breathe!</p>

              <p>First, from Aballon, we have two sizes of SRO (Small and Medium commons) as well as the eye-covered predator known as the Sharpwing (Large rare).</p>

              <p>Skipping Absalom Station and moving straight on to the red planet of Akiton, we have the four-armed giant Shobhad (large uncommon). Hailing from the Diaspora asteroid belt is the winged Sarcesian Sniper (Large uncommon). We cruise past a few more planets since we’ve already seen the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk5?Set-Course-For-Planets-of-Peril">dragonkin</a>, but we must stop at Liavara to glimpse the Bantrid (Small uncommon) who makes its home on the shepherd moon of Hibb. While Liavara itself is home to the entities known as dreamers, they’re physiologically identical to the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk5?Set-Course-For-Planets-of-Peril">barathus</a> of neighboring Bretheda, and they showed up at the very beginning of this journey, so we’ll move on to the last stop on the trip: the mysterious planet of Aucturn, where the Orocoran (Medium rare) lives.</p>

While I’d love to go on and explore more amazing aliens in plastic form, right now I’m going to take a break. Lie down. Get some rest. The strangely melodious tinnitus that has accosted me since we left Aucturn is growing to an unbearable cacophony, and I must get sleep. While I slumber in dreams I’m sure will be nothing but pleasant, may you all enjoy your new Starfinder miniatures, friends, and stay safe!</p>

              <p itemprop="description">Last week, we shared a no-prep character, Urok, to give you a brief glimpse at the orderly aphorite versatile heritage.

This week we’re going to preview another new versatile heritage: beastkin! I’ll talk a bit more about beastkin after showing you the NPC, but for now, let’s look at our no-prep beastkin, Chea.</p> 
              <h3>Chea, Student of Unfolding Wind</h3> 
              <p>Born to a large family of werecrocodiles in the nation of Jalmeray, Chea was envied by her fellows for her strange lack of the werecreature's curse. Chea's mother assured the girl that her blessing proved she was meant for great things, though her bitter cousins mocked her for her soft heart and lack of killer instinct. One night when she was a teenager, she went out for a swim, sick of the insults and teasing from her peers. The beastkin accidentally stumbled across an adventurer, who was stargazing by the riverside. The strange woman didn't attack, however, instead introducing herself as Nisha and inviting Chea to come look at the stars. Nisha pointed out a glowing comet in the sky and told Chea that the star was actually an elemental lord named Ranginori, and that Nisha's fellow adventurers, the Pathfinders, were working to set Ranginori free. When Nisha left that evening, she gave her telescope to Chea. From then on, Chea spent her nights gazing up to the glowing star, whispering secret prayers in hope they might comfort the trapped god.</p> 
              <p>Chea saw the moment her bright star burst across the sky, freeing Ranginori from his uncounted years of imprisonment. Knowing the hard journey that Ranginori faced ahead of him, Chea was among one of the first to pledge her faith to the elemental lord. Encouraged by her mother, Chea approached the Monastery of Unfolding Wind in Jalmeray. Though she had to hide her true nature from her fellow acolytes, her determination saw her excel in her monk training. Yet when she returned to visit her family after her initial studies were complete, she found them decimated and scattered. The survivors gave confused, conflicted reports, but several of them claimed that Pathfinders had attacked them.</p> 
              <p>Though Chea knew her family weren't always saints, she found she couldn't let this go. The monk now searches for answers to what truly happened, and vengeance for those who killed her kin.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/516e9c59-a320-4bbe-b485-a862cc091321/021821_Chea.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/516e9c59-a320-4bbe-b485-a862cc091321/021821_Chea.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A human woman covered in crocodile’s scales is clad in monk’s robes.

              <h4>Plot Hooks</h4> 
              <p>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Chea into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
              <ul> 
               <li>Chea seeks out the heroes in hopes of learning a new fighting technique to give her a further edge in combat. She’s willing to share an aspect of her training in return.</li> 
               <li>As the heroes leave a dungeon, some ruins, or another adventuring site, Chea makes her presence known. She challenges the heroes to a fight, believing them to be Pathfinders.</li> 
               <li>A whisper on the wind guides the heroes to Chea. The monk notes that she’s received a message from her god about the whereabouts of a gem that holds another elemental lord. Chea believes it is her fate, and the heroes’, to rescue the trapped god.</li> 
              </ul> 
              <h4>About Beastkin</h4> 
              <p>Beastkin is a blanket term for any person who has gained the ability to partially or fully transform into an animal through any number of means, while maintaining a balance with their humanoid side. Beastkin might have a lineage that traces directly to werecreature parents. Other beastkin might have received their abilities from a deity or even as a result of polymorph magic. Regardless of their origin, a beastkin is tied to a particular animal, such as bat, eagle, shark, spider, tyrannosaurus, wasp, or wolf. This animal is known as the beastkin’s inherent animal. Beastkin feats allow a beastkin to further tap into their animalistic connection and gain new senses, the ability to fly or swim like their inherent animal, or even fully transform into that animal in combat. Beastkin is a rare versatile heritage and you can learn all about it when <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide">Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</a> releases on February 24th!</p>

              <p>The Pahtra Stalker we revealed <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk5?Set-Course-For-Planets-of-Peril#discuss"></a> makes its home on Vesk-6, while the helpful Skittermander (Small common) and the decidedly less helpful Stridermander (Medium uncommon) hail from Vesk-3. Skittermanders are known for their bright colors, and we knew we couldn’t get away with making just one. But the set only had so many slots and we didn’t want to take up too many of them with a single alien species, even one as popular as skittermanders. The solution, at least for now, is in alternate-paint promos, of which we made two. We’ll have more information in the future about how you can get your six hands on these little guys. In future sets, if we have alternate-paint figures built into the main set, skittermanders will likely make a reappearance there. </p>

              <p>While the Veskarium was initially at odds with the peoples of the Pact Worlds, the two warring star systems had to put their differences aside to face an enemy that threatened both of them: the Swarm! Perfect for use in the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/attackOfTheSwarm">Attack of the Swarm!

              <p>Since most of the remaining aliens in the set call the Pact Worlds home (and thus would make an excellent theme to explore next week), let’s look at some of the aliens from other parts of the galaxy you’ll find in <em>Planets of Peril</em>, as you might encounter them on a journey across the galaxy. </p> 
              <p>First is the Jinsul Warrior (Medium common), which Starfinder Society players should recognize immediately (and which I won’t say much more about to avoid spoilers for past Starfinder Society plots). And since you’re not likely to get to the jinsuls’ home without going through the Drift, how about a Garaggakal (Medium rare), an outsider native to the hyperspace plane? Along the way, you might need to deal with an infestation of Electrovores (Small common), for which you consult an Orashu Headteacher (Medium uncommon) for advice, and ultimately employ an Uplifted Bear (Large uncommon) to handle them with brute force. Sadly, when you emerge from the Drift, you find the wreckage of another starship, its crew exposed to the vacuum of space and now haunting the area as dread Nihili (Medium common).</p>

             <blockquote> 
              <p itemprop="description"><em>Sixteen point five two eight… move the seven</em>… Taihei tried to hold the quantities in his head, but they jittered and danced. No matter, he could manage. He dipped a brush into his inkstone and found a patch on the back of his right wrist where a cluster of silver dots raised in precise intervals against his golden skin, counted off ten dots, drew lines on either side, and covered seven dots with ink. <em>Leaving three. Now… what was the trajectory coefficient again…</em> he felt for a second like the answer was close, before the chirping of bell crickets pierced the tearoom-turned-study. </p> 
              <p>The remainders and decimals and factors scattered immediately. Taihei groaned, crumpled his sheet of paper, and threw it to join its fellows in the corner. As a distant chime rang, he retrieved a heavily notched metal rod from his writing case and made a small cut in it to mark the time before going to wash off in a basin by the door. <em>Another hour, another year.</em></p> 
              <p>The entrance examination for the College of Celestial Study would come in a few months with the snows, and Taihei couldn’t come back empty-handed <em>again</em>—he’d failed six times already, and this was getting embarrassing. <em>You wouldn’t even use half these formulas in the field, we have counting boards and number familiars for that.</em> Taihei just wanted to peer within a star, to chart the comets as they flowed through the sky, but he’d be earthbound forever if he couldn’t get into the program first. </p> 
              <p>Taihei allowed himself a moment to find his favorite constellations before getting back to study, but he couldn’t see a thing through the neighbor’s persimmon trees, which seemed to almost be mocking him—they’d shot up sometime when he wasn’t looking, sealing off the courtyard in a riot of red leaves and orange fruit. It made for a picturesque sight at least: persimmons, courtyard, and harvest moon, even a small fox in frame near the koi pond. “Must be nice, to just be a fox. You don’t have to worry about trajectories or tests, do you?” </p> 
              <p>“I’ll have you know I have two degrees from the College myself, so I find I rarely have to worry anymore” the fox stated matter-of-factly. </p> 
              <p>He bowed to Taihei before striding forward on four legs, though only two remained by the time he reached the door as his form blurred and shifted to that of a wavy-haired elf man in a professor's robes and pleated trousers. “And once I’m done with you, you won’t have to either.”</p> 
              <p>“Taihei, remember to clean up before your new tutor arrives!” Taihei’s mother called from the house, unfortunately a hair too late to save him the embarrassment. Sheepishly, the student slid open the door and placed a cushion on the floor, but the man strode right past him, taking a seat on the edge of the table instead</p> 
              <p>“So, out with it, why can’t you seem to pass the exam? Shouldn’t you be able to just…” the professor appraised Taihei, noting a golden mote flickering off his arm,” I don’t know, <em>aphorite</em> this?”</p> 
              <p>Taihei seethed at the assumption that being born under the sign of Axis somehow granted immediate knowledge of trigonometry and calculus, though he remembered his manners and prevented the emotion from reaching his face. “I’m afraid that numbers are my weakest subject. I’m not sure how to understand what they all mean in the real world.”</p> 
              <p>“In that case,” the fox in elf shape coughed into a fist, and when he withdrew his hand, a curious crystal ball sat in it, glowing soft and blue, “we should simply hammer all possible test questions into you so thoroughly that you’ll pass the test even if you don’t understand.” He tapped the orb, which floated across the room to hover in front of Taihei. “Write down your answers to the following questions. Beginning immediately.” Before Taihei could voice his confusion at this novel teaching strategy, the orb began reciting:</p> <b>
               <ul> 
                <li>“List the seventeen most common alchemical components of an extraplanar being in reverse alphabetical order of closest-affinity celestial body, beginning from Aucturn”</li> 
                <li>“Compute trajectory of this model of a transiting comet with a fey toroid structure and…”</li> 
                <li>“What is the average density of a sixth-order star, assuming Positive Energy gateways have mass according to Gyoen’s Third Theorem of…”</li> 
               </ul></b> 
              <p>Taihei was overwhelmed swiftly and ruthlessly. He began trying his best to answer the questions, but no sooner had he begun writing than his teacher cleared his throat. “Keep in mind that the exam is 258 questions, so you’ll need to average one question every 90 seconds.” </p> 
              <p>“Y-yes... of course, Professor.” Taihei desperately tried to rejoin his train of thought. The orb carried on:</p> <b>
               <ul> 
                <li>“Solve for X to yield the minimum possible amount of teleportation inaccuracy given a conjurer using …”</li> 
                <li>“If ten human ganzi assistants and one brilliant kitsune professor are each holding a planar tuning fork, then…”</li> 
               </ul></b> 
              <p><em>Wait, wha—</em></p> 
              <p>“You know,” the professor interrupted again, “What if you just found a way to visualize the problems? Or like a feeling or something. Why, I used to be terrible at changing forms, but look at me now!” The professor waggled his long elven ears as they shifted back into those of a fox. “I just think of a sensation I connect with being a kitsune, like the feeling of grass under paw, and it comes to me.”</p> 
              <p>“That…” Taihei struggled to find a polite way to tell his teacher to please shut up, missing a question about two ships leaving Sakakabe (one at noon, the other at midnight) in the process, “That’s very helpful.”</p> <b>
               <ul> 
                <li>“The aforementioned brilliant kitsune professor is planning a three-day planar expedition. How much fried tofu should his students gift him to ensure his rations are…”</li> 
               </ul></b> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5de65657-1cce-4277-8be6-4db9be151308/021721_SeventhFall.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5de65657-1cce-4277-8be6-4db9be151308/021721_SeventhFall.jpg" width="80%" hspace="5" alt="A fox with star-speckled fur covered in silvery whorls steps across a math-filled parchment on a table, leaving ink footprints behind.

              </div> 
              <p>“Oh, this one’s very important!” the professor noted most unhelpfully, and Taihei looked up to see he had fully resumed fox form and was now pacing across the desk, stepping in Taihei’s inkstone each time.</p> 
              <p>“Professor, you’re tracking paw prints on my practice tests,” Taihei pleaded, on his very last nerve.</p> <b>
               <ul> 
                <li>“Solve for X, where X is the number of years an aphorite who can’t perform basic calculations without scribbling on his arms will attempt the entrance exam before…”</li> 
               </ul></b> 
              <p>“Okay, that does it!” Taihei snatched the orb from the air and ran to the door. Looking out into the courtyard, he spied a nest under the eave of the neighbors’ estate, recently abandoned by migrating swallows. In that moment, he wanted nothing more than to throw the orb into the nest, but those blasted trees were in the way and he didn’t have a clear shot. </p> 
              <p>No matter. He could manage.</p> 
              <p>Taihei’s eyes darted around the courtyard, taking in angles and forces. He felt his mind… not expand, exactly—the opposite. Connect. Point to point. Intention joined result. He flung the orb, feeling its complete trajectory even before it had left his hand. It skipped twice off the surface of the pond. It spun as it struck the tiles of the courtyard wall and flew high into the sky. And it danced in the autumn night as a breeze adjusted its path ever so slightly to the left, before it fell perfectly between the branches of the trees to land in the abandoned nest. </p> 
              <p>No sooner had it touched down than something strange happened. The trees that Taihei had tried so hard to avoid shimmered in the night air, dissolving into ghostly blue flames, and when Taihei had finished rubbing his eyes, they were gone and the sky was visible once more. Rather than the blue sphere, a roasted chestnut sat perfectly in the swallows’ nest. </p> 
              <p><em>Huh</em>. “The coefficient was zero point nine two,” Taihei said to himself, perfectly recalling the problem he had been working on earlier, every page in his textbook, and where he had forgotten one of his sandals that morning. The strange clarity left him as subtly as it arrived, but in its wake, he felt like he understood just a little bit more of the test than he had in years.</p> 
              <p>“Oh, very nice! It looks like you’re one of those students that learns better by doing. That’ll make the rest of this so much more fun.” </p> 
              <p>Taihei looked back at the desk to once more see an elf, eating from a bag of chestnuts. The professor flicked a wrist and the glowing orb reappeared in his hand, and as he absentmindedly tossed it into the air, nothing came back down. As he strode to the door and waved one of his tails from beneath his robes, illusory equations and vectors sprung into glowing existence around the courtyard, illuminating each phase of Taihei’s throw in precise and clear mathematical detail.</p> 
              <p>“I think,” Taihei said slowly, “you’re probably the worst teacher I’ve had.”</p> 
              <p>“You know, for some reason, I get that a lot,” the fox said in mock offense. He tossed a chestnut to Taihei before popping seven more in his mouth. “Now, do that again, and this time, let's go through the calculations, step by step.”</p>

              <h3>Devinne Caples (she/her)</h3> 
              <p>My name is Devinne and I am the HR Generalist for Paizo. I am also a wife and mom to three children. I wear a lot of hats. I enjoy working in Human Resources and working at Paizo has given me the opportunity to work in a very diverse work environment. Working at Paizo has opened my eyes to the RPG world and how beneficial it can be to be part of such a community, especially during these uncertain times. These communities connect individuals and provide a means to still feel a part of something bigger than themselves while in isolation. I admire what we do here.</p>

              <h3>Travis “Rabbit” Lionel (he/him)</h3> 
              <p>Travis, circa 1994. Writer, gamer, black guy. Growing up, I was always told I wasn’t black enough or I was trying too hard to “act white” due to my hobbies and interests. I always loved games like Final Fantasy and became invested into tabletop games such as Magic: The Gathering and Pathfinder 1st Edition by the beginning of high school. However, I never let these things stop me from loving my blackness, my history and my hobbies no matter how far removed. Okay, that’s partially true; I did have some identity issues. Now, I’m in a position to not only show that black people can participate in these hobbies, but centralize themselves into the hobby as well. I was blessed with the opportunity to work with Paizo on Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse in 2020. I wanted this to be a chance for an African inspired setting to have a black voice on it as often we have so few chances to make African settings anymore than mud huts. I also wanted to show little black children that tabletop games and other hobbies are not the exclusive domains of white people and that everyone is welcome.</p> 
              <p>I love love love, 2nd Edition Pathfinder and I hope to continue playing and working on it in the future. In addition, you can find me on Twitch (<a href="https://twitch.tv/eightbitrabbits" target="_blank">https://twitch.tv/eightbitrabbits</a>) giving lots of opinions about games of both the tabletop and video variety here.</p> 
              <br> 
              <h3>Erin Roberts (she/her)</h3> 
              <p>I'm a new(ish) freelancer for Paizo, but I have been a writer for some time, telling stories of impossible magic, maybe-one-day technology, and all-too-real things that go bump in the night (feel free to check me out on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/nirele" target="_blank">@nirele</a>). I am also a child (and current resident) of East Coast cities like New York and DC, with roots in the Deep South and Panama, who grew up in a family that ensured that the lessons and pride and continued journey of Black history were a fundamental part of who I am.</p> 
              <p>One of the reasons that I enjoy writing so much is that I love to tell a good story, but also that I love to think about the story beneath the story, the iceberg that the tales we spin are only the very tip of. After all, even the silliest, most ridiculously fluffy pieces of creative work teach you a little something, from who gets to shape the world to what places make interesting backdrops to which stories are worth telling. Part of why I love my creative work is that I have the opportunity to bring who I am to the page, to add the people and places and stories that I know from my experience as a Black woman to the undercurrents of the collective tale we’re telling, and to lift up the power of community, the fight against injustice, the distinction between race, culture, and destiny, and the deep importance of collective joy.</p> 
              <br> 
              <h3>Isis Wozniakowska (she/her)</h3> 
              <p>I’m one of Paizo’s newer freelancers. I’ve written for the upcoming Secrets of Magic book and my first Starfinder scenario, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ms?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-321-Frozen-Ambitions-Renewals-Blight">#3-21: Frozen Ambitions: Renewal's Blight</a>, was just announced. I’ve been involved with Organized Play off and on for five years, but I’ve really become a more active member within the past two. I also both play and GM Paizo APs and adventures regularly. You might have even heard me in the most recent Starfinder Society special voicing Luwazi Elsebo, a role which I’d be happy to reprise anytime (wink wink).</p> 
              <p>I’m the daughter of a Black woman and a Polish immigrant man. My mother is a Blues musician, and a former belly dancer, which ended up giving me a Black music and musical history education in my childhood. She has also always been a major science fiction and superhero movie nerd. She and her siblings loved watching Star Trek as kids and seeing a Black woman like Uhura on screen each week inspired all of them.</p> 
              <p>The first time I showed my mother a picture of a Black elf in one of my Pathfinder books she got so excited that she bought elf ears for herself for Halloween because she’d never seen a classic fantasy race that looked like her. I’ve gotten my passion for science fiction and fantasy from her, and I can only hope to recreate more moments like this for her and other Black people in the future through my time spent participating in Organized Play, and through further work in writing for RPGs.</p>

              <h4>Urok, Kobold Infiltrator</h4> 
              <p>When the Yioxat tribe of kobolds was subjugated by a local devil, its members feared that their children might be corrupted by their parents' unwilling agreements with Hell. Yet when Urok cracked open his shell, his caretakers were shocked to see the kobold hatchling had unique gold and silver scales, unlike even the scales of a metallic kobold. Though his soul was unclaimed by the forces of evil, Urok grew up arrogant and overbearing, enforcing the strict order that the devil imposed on his tribe. He was quick to realize that his fellows weren't carrying out their tasks as efficiently as they could be, and his efforts to organize his tribe more effectively always seemed to fail. It was only after investigating that he realized how much the Yioxats were deliberately undermining his efforts, as they despised their devil overlord, and despised Urok by association.</p> 
              <p>Though he was heavily tempted to double down on his attempts to control, Urok instead fled, hiding in the wilderness as he tried to make sense of his life until this point. It was there that a Yioxat dragon sorcerer found him. The sorcerer explained that the Yioxat tribe had warded Urok's egg against evil influence before he was born, to protect him from the risk of Hell claiming his soul. Realizing that he had repaid his people's kindness with oppression, Urok decided to serve the law by returning sovereignty to his tribe. Though he doesn't want to approach his fellows just yet, he keeps watch over them, looking for an opportunity to kill the devil and free his family. However, this has also resulted in Urok clashing with well-meaning adventurers who seek to destroy the Yioxat tribe without realizing the kobolds are unwilling servants.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b3bdca0b-06e2-4e62-9c8c-b6449bf95acb/021221_urok.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b3bdca0b-06e2-4e62-9c8c-b6449bf95acb/021221_urok.jpg" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt=": A small kobold is covered in brilliant golden scales.

              <h4>Urok — Creature 9</h4> 
              <p><b>Unique, LN, Small, Aphorite, Humanoid, Kobold</b><br> Male aphorite kobold infiltrator</p> 
              <p><b>Perception</b> +18; darkvision, low-light vision<br> <b>Languages</b> Aklo, Common, Draconic, Infernal, Undercommon, Utopian<br> <b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +20, Arcana +20, Athletics +13, Deception +16, Devil Lore +20, Diplomacy +16 Nature +16, Intimidation +16 Occultism +20, Religion +16, Society +20, Stealth +20, Survival +16, Thievery +20, Yioxat Tribe Lore +20<br> <b>Str</b> +0, <b>Dex</b> +4, <b>Con</b> +0, <b>Int</b> +4, <b>Wis</b> +2, <b>Cha</b> +2<br> <b>Items</b> <em>+1 striking returning dagger</em><br> <b>AC</b> 27; <b>Fort</b> +15, <b>Ref</b> +21, <b>Will</b> +18<br> <b>HP</b> 140</p> 
              <p><b>Preemptive Reconfiguration</b> [reaction] <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Trigger </b>Urok would take bludgeoning piercing, or slashing damage; <b>Effect</b> Urok’s body anticipates the blow and the impact area briefly reorganizes into a strengthened tissue lattice that blunts the attack. He gains resistance 9 against the triggering damage type, which applies against the triggering damage</p> 
              <p>Urok can expend his daily use of Crystalline Dust when using this reaction. If he does, his daily use of Preemptive Reconfiguration isn’t expended and he can use it a second time.</p> 
              <p><b>Speed</b> 25 feet</p> 
              <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action] dagger +19 (agile, finesse, versatile S), <b>Damage</b> 2d4+8 piercing</p> 
              <p><b>Ranged</b> [one-action] dagger +19 (agile, finesse, thrown 10 feet, versatile S), <b>Damage</b> 2d4+8 piercing</p> 
              <p><b>Crystalline Dust</b> [two-actions] <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b> Urok disperses the crystalline motes coating his body as a haze. He becomes concealed, though he can’t use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. The motes stay within an inch of his skin, move with you, and last for 4 rounds.</p> 
              <p><b>Draconic Exemplar</b> green dragon</p> 
              <p><b>Kobold Breath</b> [two-actions] (arcane, evocation, poison) Urok breathes a poisonous mist that deals 5d4 poison damage in a 15-foot cone (DC 25 basic Fortitude save). He can’t use Kobold Breath again for 1d4 rounds. </p> 
              <p><b>Mastermind</b> If Urok successfully identifies a creature using Recall Knowledge, that creature is flat-footed against his attacks until the start of his next turn; if he critically succeeds, it’s flat-footed against his attacks for 1 minute.</p> 
              <p><b>Skirmish Strike</b> [one-action] <b>Frequency</b> once per round; <b>Effect</b> Urok either Steps and then Strike, or Strikes and then Steps.</p> 
              <p><b>Sneak Attack</b> Urok’s Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage to flat‑footed creatures.</p> 
              <h4>Plot Hooks</h4> 
              <p>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Urok into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
              <ul> 
               <li>Urok arrives in the same town as the heroes. He is met with unwelcoming glances and even fear from the townsfolk. The pleading kobold asks anyone who will listen that he is in need of cold iron weapons to slay the devil that terrorizes his kin.</li> 
               <li>A local noble tasks the heroes with clearing the Yioxat kobold tribe from the nearby wilderness. As they approach the tribe, Urok makes himself known and attempts to force the heroes away.</li> 
               <li>A fleeing Urok runs into the heroes as they are travelling. He is holding a large egg and shoves it into the heroes’ hands. He explains the egg has been warded and needs to be kept away from evil eyes before he runs away.</li> 
              </ul> 
              <h4>About Aphorites</h4> 
              <p>Aphorites were first forged by axiomites to serve as liaisons between their lawful progenitors and frustratingly unpredictable mortal allies. Over time, aphorites’ appearances and personalities grew to resemble their mortal comrades as they were increasingly born among mortals. Aphorites still exhibit Axis’s touch in their metallic skin coated in crystalline dust, aptitude for logic, strength in artisanship, and propensity for order and cooperation. Aphorite feats allow an aphorite to draw upon the power of their crystalline dust, analyze a situation on the battlefield to maximize effectiveness, and even call upon order to find success when catastrophic failure was all but absolute. Aphorite is an uncommon versatile heritage and you can learn all about it when <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide"><em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide releases on February 24th!</em></a></p>

               <p><em>Kia Ora from Aotearoa, the Land of the Long White Cloud, home of Hobbiton, Xena, and both of the Conchords, my home: New Zealand! I am Paul Trani, one of the Venture Captains of this exquisite place, and just like you, I have seen my role-playing game practice change dramatically this past year, in both how and why I game. With respect to the latter, I am so grateful for the Organized Play (OP) community, both in-person and virtual, for preserving (slightly) my sanity, and when the opportunity to give back came around, I critically failed my Will save. On purpose. </em></p><em> <p>And so I find myself the chairperson of the Onboarding Task Force, a newly-created volunteer group of venture officers working to help new players discover the world of Pathfinder Society (PFS) and wow! am I both excited and humbled by the talented people that populate this group. The taskforce team is made up of Daniel Baker, Douglas Hahn, Katrina Hennessy, Kevin Baumann, Kristin Wilhite, Michael VonHasseln, Peter Nalepa, Nicole Heits, Kiela Butson, Kara Kramer-Rapp, Dustin Knight, and Joel Hager.</p> <p>But Paul, you ask, doesn’t New Zealand have an official wizard? Yes, he lives in Christchurch - you can look it up, but I’d like to tell you about what the Onboarding Task Force has been doing in the course of the past four months</p> <p>We started work with a specific request - reduce the barriers to entry for new players. In the current mostly-digital world, that translated to finding a way to transition the chronicle sheets to allow for treasure and scenario rewards to be tracked differently. We created a format that can be used either physically or electronically and we’re continuing to look at more ways that this can be tracked even more simply. You can find the <a href="https://www.orgplayfoundation.org/join/new-players-pop/" target="_blank">tracking tools here</a>.</p> <p>Since that time, we’ve been asked to do a few more things. We’ve been working extra hard on helping you to take characters from that cool new <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> that you or a loved one got for Christmas and played all the way through. We’re publishing a guide that will help transition characters built with Beginner Box rules into full-fledged Pathfinder Society Characters. You can find the guide here: <a href="https://www.orgplayfoundation.org/pf2bb/" target="_blank">Beginner Box conversion guide</a>.</p> <p>We’ve got lots more in the pipeline that we’re working on, which will post to the Organized Play Foundation website when finished. We’re really excited about our new projects and can’t wait to show them to you. </p> <p>Our team is here to help the community get involved in organized play. Got a suggestion? We’re always open to new ideas. You can send them to me at <u>we.be.dunedinpfs@gmail.com</u>. </p> <p>It’s a pleasure to be helping bring the new generation of Golarionites to the Starstone, as it were, and we on the Onboarding Team wish you all the natural 20s that are coming to you. </p> </em>
               <p><em>Cheers!</em></p>

I also spend a lot of free time either playing CRPGs and MMOs or reading horror fiction.

              <p><b>Logan Harper, Customer Service</b> – Hi! I’m Logan (she/her). I’m a bit of a hobbit who you can usually find curled up with my pups watching movies.

Feel free to follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganHarper_" target="_blank">@LoganHarper_</a></p> 
              <p><b>Kyle Hunter, Art Director</b> (November) (he/him) – After about 15 years, I’m back! I was part of the original WotC Periodicals crew that split off to form Paizo.

In addition to designing the Paizo logo, I created the droid manufacturing logos for Star Wars.</p>

When I’m not playing games, I’m probably outside. I love the great outdoors—cycling, hiking, and rock climbing are some of my favorite activities. I sometimes ramble about various topics on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenjski" target="_blank">@jenjski</a>. See you in space!</p>

              <p><b>Levi Steadman, Tech</b> – Hello, I’m Levi (he/him). I’m a Michigander who has been playing Pathfinder for half his life adjusting to my new life here in the PNW. I’ve joined the team to help with the QA process for the website and automated some of the monotonous QA tasks that tend to slow things down. When I’m not doing my day job or playing Pathfinder I’m almost always playing MMOs with my wife and our friends back in Michigan.</p>

              <p><b>Adam Daigle</b> (he/him): Managing Developer to <b>Director of Game Development</b>—As I mentioned in my teary blog this past summer, when Amanda left us for other ventures, I took over management of the Starfinder development team in addition to the Pathfinder development team. Now I have the duty and honor of managing the development of both of our games, and this new title represents that. It’s weird that I was a fan and freelancer posting on our messageboards less than ten years ago. I’ve been stoked to see so many awesome new people joining us and seeing other people rising through the ranks to well-deserved positions.</p>

              <p><b>Avi Kool</b> (they/them): Editor to <b>Senior Editor </b><br> After working on Pathfinder Second Edition since the playtest, I have a huge amount of love for the system and the stories it empowers us to tell. I can’t wait to lead the Editing team on the Pathfinder line to further explore the way the game works as well as the world of Golarion and the people who inhabit it.</p> 
              <p>When I’m not editing, I enjoy learning about nature, cross-stitching, watching horror movies, and petting my dog. I am the company’s resident expert on bears, for which I have no certifications whatsoever. You can find me talking about bears and making tabletop RPGs queer on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/legalizegoblins" target="_blank">@legalizegoblins</a>.</p>

              <p>Most Paizo employees continue to work from home and we have no return date scheduled.

This also means our Customer Service team is unable to take calls directly in the office they continue to work via email, the forums, and the main Paizo voicemail box. We thank you for your support, patience, and patronage. </p>

             <blockquote> 
              <p itemprop="description">The creature ripped out the man’s throat with its claws, blood spraying across the leaf-littered forest floor. Its furry bulk pinned the body to the ground. Lips pulled back from razor-sharp teeth as a low, ripsaw growl rumbled deep in the thing’s throat.</p> 
              <p>Leaning close, the lupine head sniffed at its victim’s pulsing neck. Then the beast threw back its head, spine arching. Its shrill howl split the chill, nighttime air.</p> 
              <p>“AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” </p> 
              <p>“Archie? Archie, stop! Archibol Frigasson the Third!”</p> 
              <p>The creature’s howl stopped abruptly. It blinked, looking around in confusion.</p> 
              <p>“Goria... what?” </p> 
              <p>“Stop. There could be more bandits, you little twit. Calm down.”</p> 
              <p>Archie cleared his throat. “Ah. Of course. My apologies. I quite got carried away.”</p> 
              <p>Archibol rose carefully to his feet. He was not particularly tall, but his broad shoulders and thick arms gave him a hulking quality. His gray fur shone almost white in the light of the full moon. For a moment, he looked down on his blood-soaked hands with wonder, then blinked. He crouched and pulled at the dead man’s cloak, gathering enough fabric to start meticulously cleaning his claws and fur.</p> 
              <p>“Archie? We good?” Goria asked, her voice like gravel rolling around in a dry bucket. The blades of her daggers flashed as she twirled and pushed them into scabbards at her hips. Although the woman was both preternaturally quick and strong, she looked neither. Long, stitched scars zig-zagged everywhere across her flabby skin. It was as if someone had patched Goria together from dozens of long-dead, mismatched bodies. </p> 
              <p>Which, of course, is precisely what Archibol’s mad father had done, years before he had turned to polymorph experiments upon his only son. The two oddities had clung to each other ever since their escape.</p> 
              <p>“Of course, big sister, of course. Heh. Nothing to fear. Merely lost in the moment.”</p> 
              <p>Goria watched him with a milky, unblinking stare. An awkward moment of silence passed.</p> 
              <p>The wolf-man cleared his throat again. “Right. Everyone accounted for, then? Where’s our lovely oracle?”</p> 
              <p>“I’m here, Archibol!”</p> 
              <p>He could smell her before she emerged from the shadows, the scent of an open grave. Normally, Ashka Midnighter was a young, doe-eyed kayal—a shadow person—her pale skin and white hair seeming as if all color had drained from her and giving her an exotic beauty. Now, however, her cheeks were sunken, her perfect smooth skin marred by rot. She still moved gracefully, though, skipping gleefully through branches and leaves and hardly making a sound.</p> 
              <p>“Ah, splendid. I say, Ashka. Do these oracular powers of yours hurt you when they desiccate your body so?”</p> 
              <p>Her cracked lips split into a wide grin. “Of course not! Oh, I feel a bit tired, but I’m fine. Ready for more adventure!” She hopped on one foot and thrust a fist into the air. </p> 
              <p>“Hrmph. As my new ward, my dear, I must insist we do some investigation to determine any long-term negative effects from putting your body through such an ordeal.”</p> 
              <p>Ashka looked down at her exposed, decaying arms with glowing, white eyes. “It’s just the mystery of the bones, Archibol. I get glimpses into death, and death reaches back out to me. But it’s temporary, silly. Don’t worry.”</p> 
              <p>“Still, data is knowledge, eh? I would be comforted with some empiricism behind your changes. For now, though,” he grunted as he stood, hands cleaned. “We appear to have more pressing concerns.”</p> 
              <p>The three of them looked around the clearing, dappled by moonlight. </p> 
              <p>A dozen bodies lay scattered. </p> 
              <p>“What a simply preposterous disaster,” Archibol grunted. “Alright, let us begin with the facts.”</p> 
              <p>“Blast it, Archie...” Goria growled.</p> 
              <p>“How long have you known me? We must always begin with the facts.”</p> 
              <p>She rolled her patchwork eyes but did not argue.</p> 
              <p>“Now,” he began reciting, as if giving a university lecture, one clawed finger raised. “Nobleman Cammack Guthor’s caravan left Caliphas at dusk this evening, headed to a remote holiday estate. The nobleman traveled with,” Archibol’s eyes roamed the clearing. “Two servants, one carriage driver, and... let’s see, one, no, two armed guards. The carriage was led off the road to this clearing, where Guthor and his entire party were slain. Their rather impressive store of valuables has been gathered in sacks.”</p> 
              <p>Archibol began moving, stepping gingerly between corpses.</p> 
              <p>“When we arrived, we found four men and two women dressed in matching cloaks and leather armor, all armed, picking through the sacks. Each wore a red mask painted with the visage of...” he leaned down and fingered one of the wooden masks. Its bulbous nose and leering smile might have been comical in a different setting. </p> 
              <p>Ashka appeared silently at his shoulder. “Ooo! I know! Devil masks!” she clapped enthusiastically. “Like from a carnival.”</p> 
              <p>Archibol nodded once. “Devils, yes. Some fanciful conceit in pursuit of notoriety, I suppose. And calling themselves the Tricksters! As if they were some famous band of villains instead of a two-copper band of thugs.”</p> 
              <p>Goria nudged one of the bandits disdainfully with a boot. “Trying to sneak wearing red in a forest. Idiots.” </p> 
              <p>Archibol grunted. “Indeed. Alright, we have six dead victims, including our Ustalavic nobleman. However, thanks to us, we also have six dead Tricksters.” He scratched at his chin, lost for a moment in thought. “I say! How long do you suppose it would take to waylay the carriage, lead it here, kill everyone, and pick through their belongings?”</p> 
              <p>Goria shrugged one shoulder. “Hour?”</p> 
              <p>Archibol looked up to the full moon. “And yet it’s before midnight. Blast! The scroll we intercepted correctly identified Guthor as the target of the ambush, but why did the Tricksters strike early? We should have left one of the bandits alive for questioning.”</p> 
              <p>“Yes,” Goria frowned, the stitches on one cheek going taut. She looked at him pointedly. “We definitely should have.”</p> 
              <p>Archibol avoided her gaze. “Well, then. I propose we begin examining how the Tricksters arrived at the ambush point. Perhaps we can track them back to—” </p> 
              <p>Someone nearby groaned.</p> 
              <p>No sooner had Archibol’s wolf-like ears flicked at the sound, than he was bounding across the clearing to a low bush. Goria followed protectively close behind. </p> 
              <p>Both pairs of eyes looked down on an older, pale-skinned human man in an ornate breastplate, his legs tangled in the bush and the rest sprawled out of sight of the clearing. A dented helm lay nearby. </p>

              <p>“Ho ho!” Archibol exclaimed. “We have ourselves a thirteenth! One of Guthor’s guardsmen, it seems. My dear fellow, it looks as if you’ve taken quite a blow to the head. Please allow me to help you up. We have a number of questions as we pursue those who waylaid you.”</p> 
              <p>The man groaned again and rolled onto his back. He blinked once, twice.</p> 
              <p>“Yeaargh!” the man squealed. “Werewolf!”</p> 
              <p>“Ah,” Archibol chuckled. “Honest mistake. Actually, you see, I am—”</p> 
              <p>The guard’s wild eyes swiveled to Goria. “M-monster!”</p> 
              <p>“Now listen here, good fellow. That’s hardly fair,” Archibol frowned. “I believe you’ve got the wrong—”</p> 
              <p>Ashka’s grave smell washed over them as she approached. The man yelped, “Zombie!” before fainting dead away.</p> 
              <p>“Bother,” Archibol sighed. “Not again.”</p>

              <p>We wanted to also announce that for our final days we will be unlocking ALL color combinations and five more spell glyphic designs we had yet to unlock!

              <p>We have a huge announcement or three coming soon but let's focus on what we have at hand. At the completion of the campaign we must wait 14 days before the Backerkit can be opened to you. As soon as we can, we will have that available to you and we will be closing it 14 days after opening it. There is a possibility of extending if we have a significant number of backers that have yet to pledge, but we are trying to turn this around as fast as possible and are simply waiting for the orders to be processed to get started. Hopefully, all of this preparation amounts to everybody getting their dice much earlier than expected, but let's temper our expectations just in case of, you know, another worldwide pandemic or something happening. </p>

             <blockquote> 
              <p itemprop="description">The <em>Pathfinder</em> core rules contain 289 spells by our count. <em>Savage World Adventure Edition</em> includes 54 powers. When it came time to figure out how to translate the expansive, robust <em>Pathfinder</em> magic system to work in the smaller, dynamic <em>Savage Worlds</em> power system, we had to boil everything down to their core.</p> 
              <p>As designers, one of the most useful tools we have is constraining the problem. When you’re staring down the barrel of holding nearly three hundred spells in your head all at once to figure out how to combine and represent them, it’s too much for anyone to handle. But if we categorize these items and constrain them to a pre-defined structure, they’re much more manageable.</p> 
              <p>What do spells in Pathfinder accomplish? In general terms, we can assign all Pathfinder spells up to three of the following trait categories (in order of how core that trait is to the spell) and effectively summarize what they do: </p> 
              <ul> 
               <li>Deal Damage</li> 
               <li>Deal Damage in an Area</li> 
               <li>Heal</li> 
               <li>Heal in an Area</li> 
               <li>Buff an Ally</li> 
               <li>Buff Allies in an Area</li> 
               <li>Debuff an Enemy</li> 
               <li>Debuff Enemies in an Area</li> 
               <li>Remove an Effect</li> 
               <li>Remove Effects in an Area</li> 
               <li>Cause a Social Effect</li> 
               <li>Cause Social Effects in an Area</li> 
               <li>Mimic the Usage of a Skill</li> 
               <li>An Impossible Effect </li> 
              </ul> 
              <p>Now that we’ve got everything grouped, we can organize the spells into buckets. If we look at the spells that “Deal Damage” or “Deal Damage in an Area,” the list trims down to 31 spells:</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5105298d-b7be-4b01-bf49-bad24c45829a/020921_31Damage Spells.JPG"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5105298d-b7be-4b01-bf49-bad24c45829a/020921_31Damage Spells.JPG" width="80%" hspace="5" alt="A list of thirty-one Pathfinder spells in an excel spreadsheet that deal damage or damage in an area"></a>
               <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
              </div> 
              <p>That’s a lot less to think about all at once! We grouped both damage traits because we know that in <em>Savage Worlds</em>, our direct damage powers either damage everything in an area already (<em>blast, burst, &amp; damage field</em>) or have a way to hit multiple targets at once (<em>bolt</em>). Our next step is to figure out which of those spells we can reproduce the effect of using our existing powers.</p> 
              <p>We need to understand our toolset to finish our work, so let us digress for a moment and describe how powers work in <em>Savage Worlds</em>. Instead of having spell slots of different levels, you have a pool of Power Points. Each power has a listed cost you spend when you successfully activate that power (a roll of four or greater on your arcane skill). In addition to the base cost, most powers also have Power Modifiers that increase the power’s cost to give it extra effects. They also have trappings: the narrative description of how the power functions that the player defines when they gain the power.</p> 
              <p>For example, the bread-and-butter direct damage power in <em>Savage Worlds</em> is bolt. It costs one Power Point, shoots out at range, and deals a base of 2d6 damage. It also has the Damage Power Modifier that increases our base damage by 1d6. Remember, we don’t have hit points in <em>Savage Worlds</em>, so doing an extra d6 damage at any point is a pretty good damage bump.</p> 
              <p>With trappings alone, we can use bolt to mimic <em>call lightning, lightning bolt, magic missile</em>, and <em>scorching ray</em>. Magic missile has many additional rules that tie into Pathfinder’s specific systems, but otherwise is just like <em>bolt</em>; it’s a ranged attack that hits a target to deal damage.</p> 
              <p><em>Scorching ray</em> is more or less <em>bolt</em> with a fire trapping. Suppose we wanted to fire multiple rays in a single round. Instead of using the baked-in rays per four levels mechanic of <em>Pathfinder</em>, we’d leverage the Multi-Action economy of <em>Savage Worlds</em> to cast our fire-trapping <em>bolt</em> up to three times in a single round. And that’s before we use any new Power Modifiers from our work-in-progress <em>Fantasy Companion</em>. Like Onslaught, that lets us fire two <em>bolts</em> per activation. In the end, the list looked like this:</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/104b9458-4782-45d9-bfe6-f0735995debc/020921_SWADEVersions.JPG"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/104b9458-4782-45d9-bfe6-f0735995debc/020921_SWADEVersions.JPG" width="80%" hspace="5" alt="The list of Pathfinder spells from earlier with how you would cast those spells as powers in Savage Worlds.]"></a>
               <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
              </div> 
              <p><em>Cloudkill</em> is an excellent example of how a mechanically complex spell can be re-created in <em>Savage Worlds</em> using our Power Modifiers and trappings. It’s based on <em>damage field</em>, which deals 2d4 damage to everyone adjacent to the caster by default. Well, to start, <em>cloudkill</em> automatically kills creatures below three hit dice, kills creatures from four to six hit dice on a failed save, and deals constitution damage to anything with more than six hit dice.</p> 
              <p>In <em>Savage Worlds</em>, 2d4 isn’t going to wipe out a lot of folks outright, so let’s up the damage to 3d6 Heavy Damage using the new exalted Power Modifier, Greater Damage Field. Against most Extras (minor NPCs like most goblins that tend to die quickly), that’s going to be vicious, while our Wild Cards (player characters and tougher creatures) will have a chance to get out unharmed.</p> 
              <p>The next piece of the puzzle is the size of <em>cloudkill</em>. It’s a 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high cloud. The Radius modifier expands our damage field to a Small Blast Template (that’s a 4-yard diameter in <em>Savage Worlds</em>, about 12 feet across). Well, that’s smaller than its <em>Pathfinder</em> cousin, so we can pause a moment and consider if <em>damage field</em> needs an edited version of Radius that lets us use a Large Blast Template (12 yards diameter, or 36 feet across). Given that taking damage every round is much more lethal in <em>Savage Worlds</em> than <em>Pathfinder</em>, probably say not. Even Wild Cards will start to wither and die if they’re in a 3d6 Heavy Damage field for a few turns, so constraining our <em>cloudkill</em> to a smaller size works better for our game.</p> 
              <p>Next, we need to address how <em>cloudkill</em> can be placed anywhere within 100 ft. + 10ft./level in <em>Pathfinder</em> and moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round. First, we must accept a difference in the presumption of scales between our two games. In <em>Savage Worlds</em>, we generally assume you use your powers within the scope of an encounter instead of at long distances, limiting the ranges of our powers. That said, by using Mobile we can let the caster move their <em>damage field</em> up to their arcane skill on each of their turns. That means we take the maximum number from their arcane skill die (anywhere from a d4 to a d12+#), and the cloud moves that far. That’s between 8 and 24 yards (24 to 72 feet). We trade a higher range for the cloud’s starting location for the ability to move it to a specific spot on each of our turns. On average, the two balance out so we can move on.</p> 
              <p>As Mike Barbeau (the chief designer on the <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> conversion) pointed out, one of the things GMs love to do with <em>cloudkill</em> is block line of sight for their players. Taking damage in a cloud is one thing; not finding your way out is another level of pain. To that end, we can use the universal modifier (these are available to almost every power in <em>Savage Worlds</em>) Shroud to mimic this effect. It doesn’t completely block line of sight in the same way, but given that the Savage <em>cloudkill</em> is more lethal to our player characters, that’s preferred.</p> 
              <p>We describe our <em>damage field</em> as a noxious, yellow cloud to assign its trapping, and we have our <em>Savage Worlds</em> version of <em>cloudkill</em> ready to <strike>murder</strike> encounter player characters everywhere! Sometimes, however, our existing toolkit isn’t large enough to encompass everything we want a power to do in <em>Pathfinder® for Savage Worlds</em>. A great example of this is <em>disintegrate</em>! It’s an iconic spell with an effect that doesn’t have a strong translation in the existing powers, so we get to have some fun and create something new. If we look at the other effects of <em>disintegrate</em>, we can see it fits mostly under <em>bolt</em>, so we can get away with just adding a new Power Modifier that looks like this:</p>

              </div> 
              <p>By building spells using our existing tools, we can exemplify the breadth of expression our powers system allows and capture the expanse of <em>Pathfinder</em> spells in our game. When we encounter spells outside of our usual portfolio or too cool to resist making anew in <em>Savage Pathfinder</em>, we follow the existing principles behind our system to expand our powers and their modifiers to capture the spell’s essence.</p> 
              <p>Without a doubt, the category that resulted in the most new powers was the “An Impossible Effect.” This was the catch-all category for spells that had effects you couldn’t replicate without the usage of magic.</p> 
              <p>We don’t want to give too much away, but we grouped these spells to inspire some of our new powers for <em>Savage Pathfinder</em>:</p>

              <p itemprop="description">Coming soon to a Drift beacon near you, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027lz?Starfinder-Battles-Planets-of-Peril"><em>Starfinder Battles: Planets of Peril</em></a> is the first full set of Starfinder miniatures from our partners at WizKids.

Each starship comes on a hexagonal base with a sturdy clear support column, making it a perfect fit for any starship battle using the Starfinder RPG.</p> 
              <p>A handful of starship miniatures were produced a few years ago by Ninja Division and players seemed to like being able to get multiple ships around a single theme—specifically the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ub5?Starfinder-Miniatures-Corpse-Fleet"><em>Eoxian Corpse Fleet</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ub4?Starfinder-Miniatures-Pact-Worlds-Fleet">Pact Worlds fleet</a>. So when it came time to pick the ships to include in Planets of Peril, we decided to do something similar, this time offering three Veskarium ship models. Here you can see the BMC Mauler, Norikama Dropship, and Vindicas Tyrant, which are uncommon, rare, and rare, respectively. (Note also that all starships, regardless of their size, are represented on a single hex, so they’re all on 1-inch bases.)</p>

              </div> 
              <p>We had originally included only these three starships in the set, in part because we weren’t sure what ratio of creatures to ships was right for the set. We knew that we didn’t want common starships, as most of the time a combat is between the PCs and only a few other combatants. Most GMs, we figured, would need just one copy of any given model.</p> 
              <p>Fastforward a few months, to when WizKids approached us about pulling some figures out of the set to release earlier as the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024sv?Starfinder-Battles-Galactic-Heroes"><em>Galactic Heroes</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024su?Starfinder-Battles-Galactic-Villains"><em>Galactic Villains</em></a> blister packs. We now had to replace those figures, and used that opportunity to not only add a dozen creatures that didn’t make the initial cut (for what was, at the time, a 30-figure set), but also to add another two starships at the uncommon rarity. These, we knew, needed to be something that would be useful to GMs and players both (given their uncommon status) and applicable to the most possible adventures. Thus, we landed upon including the Starfinder Society’s Drake and Pegasus. Each ship was presented at a variety of tiers and were, at the time, the only two ships available to every Starfinder Society party. </p>

              <p>PS - WizKids really went above and beyond with the promo images they provided to show off the set’s contents. These are final production models pulled from a retail case. Let us know in the comments what you think of these (compared to the renders we’ve shown in the past, or the photos of the miniatures on plain white backgrounds) and we’ll work with WizKids to perfect future blogs. Thanks for your feedback thus far, and we look forward to continue working with the community to best promote Pathfinder and Starfinder Battles.</p>

              <p>This encounter is Average difficulty for a group of PCs flying a tier-4 starship, but your PCs may be higher or lower in level. “False Flags over Castrovel” is an Easy encounter for 5th-level PCs, Challenging for 3rd-level PCs, Hard for 2nd-level PCs, and Epic for 1st-level PCs.</p> 
              <h3>False Flags over Castrovel — CR 2</h3> 
              <p>The player characters have just arrived in their starship at Castrovel and are on course to their landing destination when they receive a message over their ship’s comms</p> 
              <center>
               <hr width="70%">
              </center> 
              <p>“This is <em>Blue Talon 1</em>, ordering you to stand down. Repeat, this is the <em>Blue Talon 1</em>. Land for inspection. You must comply immediately.”</p> 
              <center>
               <hr width="70%">
              </center> 
              <p>The <em>Blue Talon 1</em> comes into view on the PCs’ sensors, along with an identical ship; they are single-seat interceptors. They transmit codes identifying the craft as the <em>Blue Talon 1</em> and <em>Blue Talon 2</em> and indicating they are a patrol squadron for the Pact Worlds defensive fleet. A PC who succeeds at a DC 19 Sense Motive check can tell that the interceptors are moving to attack. A PC who succeeds at a DC 21 Computers or Profession (bounty hunter or smuggler) check recognizes that the codes are fake. A PC who succeeds by 5 or more notices the codes were altered to conceal that the ships are flagged as “AWOL.”</p> 
              <p> The <em>Blue Talons</em> aim to make the PCs hesitate long enough for the interceptors to close in before the PCs understand their hostile intentions. The pilots do not respond to any attempts to communicate and fight until the PCs’ ship is disabled.</p> 
              <p><b>Starship Combat</b>: The PCs’ starship begins three hexes away from a short edge of the map. The <em>Blue Talons</em> enter the map from the long edge. In battle, the Blue Talons use their fast speed to harry the PCs with hit-and-run tactics. When the PCs move to pursue one ship, the other moves to attack from another direction.</p> 
              <p><b>Hazard</b>: This combat occurs in the third-highest layer of Castrovel’s atmosphere. Castrovel has a normal atmosphere, so a starship can move up to 3 hexes without taking damage each round. A starship takes Hull Point damage to its forward quadrant equal to the starship’s tier × 2 for every hex moved each round beyond 3. If a <em>Blue Talon</em> has 50% or more Hull Points remaining, its pilot accepts this damage if they can gain an advantageous position. Furthermore, a storm coming in over the ocean is a moderate obfuscation hazard for any ship flying over the water. This imposes a –2 penalty on gunnery and Piloting checks, as well as Computers checks that use a starship’s sensors.</p>

              <h2>OPM Musings</h2> 
              <p itemprop="description">Wow, the month flew by. Activity the last few weeks focused on getting January scenarios out of the door, working on future scenarios, planning for our new seasons, and ramping up for convention season. We’re putting some finishing touches on our plans and will share them with everyone in a few weeks. </p> 
              <p>It’s been satisfying to have some of our longer-term projects come to fruition. Over the next few months, we hope to bring a few more projects across the finish line. I’ll leave it to Alex to reveal our latest project.</p> 
              <h2>New FAQ Pages</h2> 
              <p>We’re glad there was such a positive response to the new <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options</a> page last week because we’ve got another new set of pages for you: <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/faq">FAQ pages for Paizo Organized</a> Play have now been updated! We’ve got areas for general organized play questions, as well as areas for program-specific questions. Just like the Character Options page, this update both refreshes the look of the pages and will make it easier for the Organized Play team to publish content. We’re still tweaking these pages, so you may see some changes in how the content is organized, but if you have feedback, let us know! We’ve kept the <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/legacy/faq">Pathfinder Society (first edition) pages</a> in the legacy format.</p> 
              <p>Eagle-eyed players will notice that the Pathfinder Society FAQ page currently contains the full text of a number of boons. You’ve been asking for a place to view the full text of boons before buying them, and now we’ve got one! Any boon that is more complicated than its short description will have its text published on this page. Boons that unlock ancestries or similarly self-evident boons will not have their text published. </p> 
              <p>The FAQ page also contains the full text of our Year 2 Chronicle Boons. As we discussed in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk2?Pathfinder-Society-Digitization-Update">last week’s blog</a>, there is an issue where GMs cannot download these boons after running the game, so we’re pleased to offer this workaround. <b>Any GM with a chronicle sheet for running a Year 2 scenario with a boon attached can use the full text as published on the FAQ page instead of downloading the boon</b>. Once the bug is fixed, these boons will be removed from the FAQ page to avoid spoilers.</p> 
              <h2>Fame</h2> 
              <p>Last week, we updated the community regarding our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk2?Pathfinder-Society-Digitization-Update">Pathfinder Society digitization efforts</a>. At this point, Fame is no longer a spendable currency and we are not tracking it in any way. Reputation still exists and unlocks benefits for characters via the Achievement Point system on your “My Organized Play” page. You can see your current Reputation with the factions (note, it is called Fame on the webpage in a holdover from Pathfinder Society (first edition), which is something we have queued to fix.)</p> 
              <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
              <p>We caught up on some of the outstanding tasks, as well as kept up with our goal of day one sanctioning. Last month, we finished up <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k1?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari">Troubles in Otari</a> and added the character options from the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy">The Threefold Conspiracy</a> to the Starfinder Society Additional Resource document. By the end of this month, we hope to have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg/discuss&amp;page=last?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering">The Slithering</a> and another update to Starfinder Society Additional Resouces. We also are on target to have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide">Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</a> ready on release day (February 24th). We haven’t forgotten the Pathfinder (first edition) outstanding items, but we haven’t had the capacity to dip back into that system yet.</p> 
              <h2>GM Achievements</h2> 
              <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
              <p>We had one GM earn their 5th star this month. No GMs earned their fifth Nova or Glyph.</p> 
              <p><b>5th Star</b>: Dawn Upson</p> 
              <p>Congratulations on your achievement, Dawn!</p> 
              <h2>Conventions</h2> 
              <p>Convention season is just around the corner, and we’re starting to kick up planning for our major conventions. We hope to have information on how to volunteer soon! In the meantime, there are plenty of local events offering Paizo Organized Play. If you don’t see a convention on the list that you think should be there, contact the event organizer and ask them to register their event for organized play support.</p>

             <blockquote> 
              <p itemprop="description"><em>Flowers. Puh.</em></p> 
              <p>Teph grumbled as he trudged over the uneven ground. The tended dirt path was long gone by now, and his boots felt every bump of root and pinch of pebble. In the distance, well past the canopy and out of sight, thunder growled. The boy pulled his jacket tighter, hoping the storm would miss them tonight; he still had one more task before he could return home.</p> 
              <p>Gathering splitheart flowers. </p> 
              <p>The spiky, red flowers were a favorite of Mom’s, and they had just started to burst, revealing their perfect, crimson seeds. <em>The seeds fight off mosquitos. The leaves you boil for fevers.</em></p> 
              <p>Also, Teph noted, Mom liked to turn the petals into a paste to deepen the shade of her lips. He’d even tried it once himself, but found it altogether unpleasant; it smelled funny and he didn’t like how dark it made his mouth. He liked his lips just fine the way they were, thank you. Why did girls even <em>like</em> lip-color?</p> 
              <p>He arrived at the patch of splitheart and drew out his gathering pouch. Selecting only the ripest of the prickly flowers, he gathered each with a pinch of his fingers and a quiet word of thanks to the earth.</p> 
              <p>He arrived at the patch of splitheart and drew out his gathering pouch. Selecting only the ripest of the prickly flowers, he gathered each with a pinch of his fingers and a quiet word of thanks to the earth.</p> 
              <p>Flower picking. Teph rolled his eyes. This was not what heroes did.</p> 
              <p>The thought lingered as Teph wound his way back home. Real heroes got to solve mysteries, fight evil creatures, and save the day. Some day, he’d be a hero, like the ones in his favorite book, <em>The Grand Adventures of the Golden Wayfarers</em>. He’d be fast like Celadir Wind-Blown, dancing from rooftop to rooftop, his arrows always finding their mark. He’d be strong like Ukhul the Just, defending the helpless with a swing of his mighty sword. And he’d be wise and magical, like Zuridani Sunborn, summoning the elements themselves to help him win the day.</p> 
              <p>Teph painted his fingernails silver so they glittered when he moved his hands—just like Zuridani’s hands sparkled when he cast his spells. He even knew what his familiar would be: a fae dragon with one of its insectile wings blue and the other green—just like its eyes would be. Just like Teph’s were.</p> 
              <p>With his heroic heart and brave soul, he’d solve the world’s mysteries and save the day, and everyone would finally welcome him in the city instead of stare, distrusting. He wouldn’t have to keep a low profile or avoid the city at all; instead, they’d build him a tower of his own right in the middle of town, and his dad would never have to leave home again!</p> 
              <p>He’d make them welcome his mom, too, and make everyone apologize to them—for everything. For the ugly names they called him. For the horrible accusations they leveled at her.</p> 
              <p>The air grew colder, as did the boy’s mood; Teph knew in his stomach that the storm would arrive before dawn. Best not to dawdle. He skipped his usual extra stop at the eldest annon tree, and instead retraced his steps to the dirt path that led home. </p> 
              <p>The cottage just within the woods’ edge had been carefully built between the trees, with wild grasses and long stalks of cultivated herbs bending lazily in the chilling wind. The area was thick with the smell of herbs, intermingled with the sharp, stinging scent of the coming rains. It was usually a comfort. Usually a feeling of safety.</p> 
              <p>Right now, though, it was...<em>off</em>.</p> 
              <p>The heavy front door was halfway open, and no light could be seen from within. The decorative wreath and spiraling horn they kept on the door had been knocked off and lay, unloved, in the dirt. The comfort of being home disappeared, sinking heavily into his stomach with the weight of fear. What happened? Where was Mom? Did she need help?</p> 
              <p>The butterflies in his stomach warred with the excitement pounding in his chest. This was his moment. The first of many. He could be a hero, if he could just push back his fear.</p> 
              <p>Steeling himself, Teph crouched low, like Celadir might. Moving slowly, carefully, he approached the cracked door, senses alert for anything <em>off.</em></p> 
              <p>One step. Another. And then he was at his door.</p> 
              <p>What would Celadir do? Right. Check for traps. Trip-wires. Sounds of monsters past the doors.</p> 
              <p>…There was nothing.</p> 
              <p>Silence lay in wait just beyond, a stillness that made him hold his breath to quiet his own heartbeat. Fear was okay. Even Dad had said so. Fear was okay as long as it didn’t stop you completely.</p> 
              <p>He reached for the spiraling horn, the only potential weapon nearby, and his fingertips winked silver at him. His “magic,” there with him. It seemed to settle his heart and bring additional resolve; he knew this place inside and out. He would be okay. He would find whatever had broken into his home and bring it to justice.</p> 
              <p><em>One day I will save everyone. Let it start with this.</em></p> 
              <p>His fingers tightened around the curled horn, and with a mighty roar to make Ukhul the Just proud, Teph knocked the door completely open and charged inside, ready to fight.</p> 
              <p>The burst of sound startled the large figure shadowed in the corner, and it jumped to attention. Drawing itself to its full, massive height and towering over the boy, the shadows rolled off of a bent, pockmarked hide. The wrinkled, gnarled face loomed large, glowing, green eyes placed low on the face and emphasizing a hunched back and strong muscles. Magic gathered at two gnarled, meaty fists, and mighty Teph…screamed a high-pitch scream.</p> 
              <p>So did the figure.</p> 
              <p>The book the figure held flared as an illumination spell revealed the craggy, lined face of the green hag made plain. Teph barked out a surprised yelp and launched himself at it, dropping the curved horn and winding his arms tight around her. </p> 
              <p>The hag’s arms matched the boy’s, wrapping him up tightly. With the shock melting from her face, she squeezed him. “Sprout! You scared me.”</p> 
              <p>“Mom,” gasped Teph. “I saw the door and it wasn’t closed right and the wreath and knocker were on the ground and—”</p> 
              <p>Mom chuckled softly at the stream of words flowing from Teph’s mouth. “There, there, Sprout. All is well; I was just resting a bit. Catch probably just knocked the wreath loose trying to get in.” She looked around, her vivid, emerald eyes landing on her familiar. The spindly monkey drew the edge of the tablecloth around himself and chittered guiltily.</p> 
              <p>“See, there you go,” Mom said. “Did you bring the splitheart? Your father’s sure to be home soon.”</p> 
              <p>Teph nodded, handing over his collecting pouch and immediately starting for the bookshelf. He was safe, Mom was safe, and <em>The Grand Adventures of the Golden Wayfarers</em> called to him. </p> 
              <p>“Ah-ah,” Mom croaked, re-lighting the room’s mirrored lantern and letting her illumination spell fade. “Bath first. Story time later.”</p> 
              <p>“Mooooom,” whined Teph, giving up the path to the bookshelf even as he complained.</p> 
              <p>Several scrubbings later, after a change into fresh clothes, Father was home and the family basked in the glow of an over-full dinner table and a warm fire in the hearth.</p> 
              <p>Mom always made fantastic dinners, but they especially shone when Dad came home. The flatbreads were rolled tight and sliced extra-thin. She’d roasted peppers and tomatoes, skewering them between perfect, tender squares of meat. Roast honey-squash sweetened the air and lent a mouth-watering contrast to the sharp spice of the peppered rice. And for dessert? Hot cassava cakes with cold custard. </p> 
              <p>It almost made it worth the <em>icky stuff.</em></p> 
              <p>Teph knew he should be happy; not everyone had parents who loved each other so much. Not everyone even had parents. And especially someone like him, a callow may with a human father and a hag mother; the relationship that birthed the changeling was something special. Something genuine.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>That didn’t stop him from being grossed out every time Dad came home, all lovey-dovey kissy-sissy. Tonight, it had been flowers and a poem. </p> 
              <p>“From seven bright meadows I gathered you flowers,<br> From seven great trees I gathered the dew,<br> And long have I been gone, just counting the hours<br> And following my heart’s Call here, home to you.”</p> 
              <p><em>Eww.</em></p> 
              <p>After clearing the food from the table, Teph grabbed <em>The Grand Adventures of the Golden Wayfarers</em> and high-tailed it into the garden. The rain hadn’t started yet; he could still get a few stories in before they called him for bedtime. He lit his lantern and settled onto the cracked stone bench near the weeper tree. </p> 
              <p>Partway through the second story, the trees <em>groaned</em> suddenly, snapping the boy’s attention as something at the edge of the garden erupted from the ground. Twisting, sharp, and half-hidden by the shadows, the thing creaked and crackled, sinews twisting in the dim light of the boy’s lantern.</p> 
              <p>And then it was silent again. Still. And not for the first time today, Teph’s heart raced as he faced down a potential danger. Hiding in the weeper tree’s folds, he carefully aimed his lantern in the direction of the <em>thing</em>, and paused as he tried to understand the sight.</p> 
              <p>It was…a tree, but not. Spiraling grains of branches twisted about themselves over and over, like a strange series of veins making one large, tall structure. The wood looked old and petrified, as though it hadn’t just been born from nothing.</p> 
              <p>Was it….a tooth? It couldn’t be; it was definitely wood. He knew that much at first glance. A giant, petrified wooden tooth, swirling and vein-like.</p> 
              <p><em>No</em>, something in his mind insisted. Not just a tooth. Something far better! A <em>mystery</em>!</p> 
              <p><em>Real heroes solve mysteries, fight evil, and save the day. Let it start with this. </em></p> 
              <p>Eyes wide, heart pounding excitedly, Teph stepped toward the tree.</p>

              <p>In Starfinder AP #1, the first iconic encounter takes place at a loading dock on Absalom Station, so it’s only fitting that our first premium set of Starfinder Battles miniatures is also a docking bay. This piece features a two-person cargo transport vehicle with detachable trailer, a bench for waiting passengers or resting crew, and a variety of cargo containers in several size, shape, and color configurations. These are perfect for providing cover for any battles that might break out while your party is loading or unloading their starship, and work well as accents with any number of Starfinder Flip Mats and Flip-Tiles.</p>

              <p>No docking bay would be complete without aliens and starfarers to inhabit it. In two of the above scenes you can see the Pahtra Stalker (Medium Uncommon) and Cybernetic Golem (Large Uncommon), either of which you could find in a docking bay. Heck, since there are player character rules for the pahtra, you could even be one of them meeting the other one! The possibilities are endless.</p>

Our previous playtests have made a big difference for the final classes, and this one will as well. We appreciate you taking time in your games to improve our future releases! I want to give a special thanks to everyone who has worked hard to make sure the discussions highlight as many ideas, discoveries, and issues as possible without circular discussion on the same few points. This has been crucial in allowing us to keep up with the analysis and ideas, and your excellent engagement is going to be a huge help for these classes!</p>

              <h4>Bequeathal Boons</h4> 
              <p>As of today, there are Bequeathal boons available in the AcP store! They will allow you to transfer access to a character option from one character to another, whether that option is access to an item, feat, background, or another option. The price varies based on the rarity of the option in question, and the boon should be purchased on the character <b>giving up access</b> to that option. </p> 
              <p>For recordkeeping (either digital or analog), write “Bequeathed” and the gaining character number on the chronicle/boon. Make a copy of the original chronicle/boon sheet and include it with the gaining character, leaving the original, along with the bequeathal boon, on the character which earned the chronicle/boon.</p> 
              <p>This is one of our most-requested options and should complete the transfer of existing Fame boons into the AcP store. The text of the boon is below for your reference.</p> 
              <p></p>
              <details> <summary><b>Bequeathal Boon Text</b></summary> 
               <p>When you acquire this boon, select one [Uncommon/Rare/Unique] character option to which you’ve gained access through an adventure’s Chronicle Sheet or via a no-cost boon from the online boon store (e.g., a listed magic item or a boon that allows you to acquire a special animal companion).</p> 
               <p>Choose another of your characters. That character gains access to that special option instead, though they may only use the option once their level equals or exceeds the lowest level able to play the Chronicle Sheet’s adventure (e.g., 5th level for Levels 5–8). The receiving PC must also meet any prerequisites for the boon (e.g. they must be Liked by a particular faction to access that faction’s unique gear from <em>Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide</em>). On the Chronicle Sheet, write “Bequeathed” and the recipient character’s number next to the option. You no longer have access to that option (and must retrain the character option or sell an item back for full cost if you acquired the option and would no longer qualify for it). </p>
              </details>
              <p></p> 
              <h4>New Character Options Page</h4> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f31c5ea4-79df-4e4e-9fdf-05dca325f459/012821_Seelah.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f31c5ea4-79df-4e4e-9fdf-05dca325f459/012821_Seelah.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" width="300" alt="Pathfinder Iconic human paladin, Seelah"></a>

            <p>We’re also happy to announce the launch of our brand new <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options</a> page for Pathfinder Society! This page, in addition to looking fantastic, will allow us to get sanctioning out to you faster than before.</p> 
            <p>Big thanks to our tech team and art department who have worked with us over the past couple of months to get this online; we’re very excited about it, and we hope you find it more useful than its predecessor. Once we know we’re happy with this page, we’ll be doing the same for Starfinder Society. This isn’t the only page revamp we have in the works; expect more news soon!</p> 
            <h4>Status of Known Bugs</h4> 
            <p>Last week, we met with the tech team to check in on the status of some of the known bugs with the AcP &amp; reporting system. We identified four major issues that we believe should be fixed with rollouts in the next couple of months. Those bugs are:</p> 
            <ul> 
             <li>Capping Reputation for a table at 8, when Adventures award 12</li> 
             <li>The boon store rearranges the order of boons, so sometimes incorrect boons are purchased</li> 
             <ul> 
              <li>Related to this, we currently have no way to sort the boons within the store, this is also on the fix list</li> 
             </ul> 
             <li>And finally, GMs cannot currently download chronicle boons for scenarios they run</li> 
            </ul> 
            <br clear="all"> 
            <p>As these bugs are fixed, we’ll notify you via blog posts. If we don’t believe they will be fixed by the deadlines we’ve set internally, we’ll provide workarounds until they are. We thank you for your patience! If you’ve noticed any bugs with reporting or the boon store that don’t fall under any of these umbrellas, let us know on the forums or by emailing pfsreportingerrors[at]paizo[dot]com.</p> 
            <h4>End of Fame Purchases</h4> 
            <p>As we announced last month, <b>January 31</b> is the last day to use Fame to purchase boons. As of that date, any remaining Fame will have no value and cannot be used. The “Retired Rewards” section will remain in the Guide for reference, but Fame will no longer be earned or spent in any way. Boons purchased with Fame can still be used, and progression boons such as Eager Protégé can be fulfilled.</p> 
            <p>We thank you all for your patience as we transition our programs. We know there are bumps any time we make program changes, but once these final pieces settle into place, we believe the program will be better for it.</p> 
            <p>A gentle reminder that the <em>Guns and Gears</em> playtest ends on February 5th, so you are in the last week for running games and taking the survey. Please check back next Thursday for our February program updates. </p> 
            <p>As always, stay healthy and safe, and don’t forget to Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

              <p>The core box of the game will feature fourteen monsters and four heroes: Kyra (Human Cleric), Merisiel (Elf Rogue), Valeros (Human Fighter), and Ezren (Human Wizard). We have already revealed all four heroes' miniatures and ten of the fourteen monsters. </p> 
              <p>The first expansion pack includes two new heroes and new features to enhance the game's longevity and increase the number of strategies to win the game. According to the class, each hero has weaknesses and strengths, which influence the way the character is played in the game. Moreover, each hero has access to exclusive features, including armor, weapons, skills, and magic.</p> 
              <p>Giochi Uniti and Paizo aim to involve the community as much as possible in the game's creation process. It is just the first survey, but more will follow (e.g. about the monsters' expansion pack).</p> 
              <p>The range of heroes eligible for the survey is the remaining eight iconic heroes: Fumbus (Goblin Alchemist), Seelah (Human Paladin), Amiri (Human Barbarian), Harsk (Dwarf Ranger), Lem (Halfling Bard), Lini (Gnome Druid), Sajan (Human Monk), and Seoni (Human Sorcerer).</p> 
              <p>Join the Facebook group to vote for your favorite hero. We will add it in the future crowdfunding campaign!</p> 
              <p>The crowdfunding date is yet to be determined, as well as the hosting platform. Subscribe to the Pathfinder Arena webpage to stay updated on this project and be notified of crowdfunding campaign news.</p>

              <h4>LISAVET, WELL-READ ACOLYTE</h4> 
              <p>Lisavet found two callings in the Dawnflower Library. She was not only drawn to the faith of Sarenrae, benevolent goddess of the sun and healing, but also adored the numerous and varied books within the library. Although trained as a healer, she spent most of her time reading adventure stories. When the opportunity came for adventure of her own, Lisavet put her self-doubt aside and embraced her faith, becoming a righteous hero. Lisavet’s adventures are described in <em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em>.</p> 
              <p>Lisavet is just the sort of person anyone would want to find at a local shrine or hospital: caring, intelligent, and eager to provide whatever assistance she can. Although she puts on a greater show of confidence than she sometimes feels, she knows that Sarenrae will never let her down. </p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3fee1e01-77d5-4b5d-a4ef-37a52a7be82e/012721_ShroudLisavet.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3fee1e01-77d5-4b5d-a4ef-37a52a7be82e/012721_ShroudLisavet.jpg" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A young blonde woman in blue and gold robes with an icon to Sarenrae on her belt"></a>

              <p><b>Plot Hooks</b></p> 
              <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Lisavet into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
              <ul> 
               <li>Lisavet needs some special herbs to make a rare healing poultice she’s read about. She knows she’s ill-suited to handle an expedition to find the herbs on her own and wants the heroes to accompany her. </li> 
               <li>Having suffered a strange wound that resists ordinary attempts to heal it, the heroes must come to a specialist like Lisavet.</li> 
               <li>While perusing an ancient folio, Lisavet discovered a map to a forgotten shrine of Sarenrae in a forlorn section of wilderness. She needs aid to reach it and restore it to its former glory.</li>

              <p>Our journey began back in 2017. After losing two friends to suicide in a ten-month period, our creator, Fenway, teamed up with her mentor, Satine Pheonix, to use TTRPGs to help prevent others from going through similar losses. Partnering with local conventions, they used the games we all love to play to raise money to support local Suicide Crisis Centers to aid with resources and spread awareness. </p> 
              <p>Since that humble first event, Jasper’s Game Day has grown into an international movement that is raising more money than Fenway and Satine could have imagined. In 2020 alone, over $100,000 dollars has been raised in the name of Jasper’s Game Day for fighting suicide. </p> 
              <p>While active all 365 days of the year with streams and games, the main event is Jasper’s Game WEEK. This annual event in May has brought together gamers from around the world with guest DMs and players, many of whom are household names in the TTRPG community. When first starting, Jasper’s Game Day focused mainly on Dungeons and Dragons but has since grown to include players of different TTRPGS, including Vampire: The Masquerade, Star Wars, and, of course, Pathfinder and Starfinder. Thanks to our new partnership with Paizo, we look forward to expanding our tables with members of the Pathfinder and Starfinder community.</p> 
              <p>If you or someone you know is interested in hosting or playing in a Pathfinder or Starfinder game through Jasper’s Game Day, you can contact us at our website, <a href="https://jaspersgameday.com/" target="_blank">jaspersgameday.com</a>. Or find us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/JaspersGameDay" target="_blank">@JaspersGameDay</a>. We’d love to have you playing with us and part of our party as well all fight to prevent suicide. </p> 
              <p>If you need help or someone to talk to about your mental health please call the suicide hotline at 1-800-273-8255.</p> 
              <p>Until the next game and remember #everyrollmatters!</p>

              <p>This month brings you a fantastic new scenario in the form of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023dg?Pathfinder-Society-Special-199-The-Pathfinder-Trials">Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-11: The Pathfinder Trials</a> by veteran author Sean McGowan. Originally intended to be a special interactive for the past year’s convention season, world events had the team reconsider the role of this product. We took the time needed to turn this product into a repeatable scenario geared towards new players and experienced (but still 1st level) Pathfinder players.</p> 
              <p>During <em>The Pathfinder Trials</em>, a junior group of Pathfinders is set against unique trials from each of the Pathfinder Society’s three deans. The Masters of Scrolls, Spells, and Swords each prepared a challenge catered to their respective schools of tutelage, and it’s up to the PCs to devise a means of overcoming them. Once the PCs complete these challenges, they receive a well-earned rest, as well as one extra chance to prove their skills as Pathfinders.</p> 
              <p>I look forward to seeing everyone get a chance to participate in this scenario. For those looking for more introductory content, be sure to check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> and keep your eyes peeled to this blog for future Organized Play content!</p>

              <h3>ELEUKAS, COURAGEOUS GUARD</h3> 
              <p>Eleukas grew up in Otari, working hard in the logging camps and getting to know the townspeople. When he was old enough to join the Otari town guard, even the curmudgeonly Captain Longsaddle couldn’t deny that the muscular lad had martial talent. What he didn’t realize is that Eleukas also has heart. Though unsure of his own abilities, Eleukas joined with his friends to avert a serious threat to Otari, as described in <em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em>.</p> 
              <p>Eleukas is an excellent example of a local folk hero. He’s willing to raise his magical axe, <em>Visperath</em>, for coin, but he’s more likely to raise it to protect the innocent.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9e4f3f3f-88f5-4600-9820-e652036c3b18/012021_ELEUKAS.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9e4f3f3f-88f5-4600-9820-e652036c3b18/012021_ELEUKAS.png" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A young man in his early 20s wears hand-me-down town guard armor and has a battered axe resting on his shoulder.

              <p><b>Plot Hooks</b></p> 
              <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Eleukas into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
              <ul> 
               <li>Eleukas needs help recovering an escaped prisoner who has made threats on the lives of a local family</li> 
               <li>The heroes must defeat a marauding creature that can only be permanently killed by acid damage.</li> 
               <li>Eleukas falls victim to some charm or possession effect and the heroes must stop him without killing him.</li> 
               <li>While the heroes are investigating strange happenings in Otari, Eleukas lends his aid as someone who can make introductions to helpful townspeople and perhaps even convince Captain Longsaddle to overlook well-intentioned misdemeanors.</li> 
              </ul>

              <p>Welcome to the Marvelous Merfolk Compendium of PC Races! Merfolk are legendary water-dwelling human-like beings. They are attested in folklore and mythology throughout the ages in various parts of the world. While the standard setting offers a pittance of various merfolk races, this book stands to rectify that by providing a veritable rainbow of 22 playable merfolk races to entertain, inspire, and educate players and Game Masters alike. Aside from a small handful of races that draw on material in Psionics Unleashed (Dreamscarred Press), this tome is intended to work with Paizo Publishing’s Pathfinder RPG core books alone. Although the races can be used in the Cerulean Seas Campaign Setting (Alluria Publishing), this setting is not required to use this tome. In addition, this tome provides optional mechanics for buoyancy, drag, water pressure, and water current to add a bit more realism to your aquatic encounters.</p>

              <p>The Treasury of Winter brings you three dozen magical items ideal for any Pathfinder Second Edition campaign but especially suited to adventures into the icy lands of the north, where frozen fey and winter witches rule a cold-hearted kingdom and seek to spread their wintry reach across this world and beyond. Even beyond the general themes of frost and fey, these treasures draw upon Russian myth, legend, and folk traditions, as befits a campaign where meeting Baba Yaga herself is a definite possibility, and where the veil between worlds dissolves to the point that heroes from a world of magic might venture forth to a war-torn world like our own on the trail of the queen of witches herself!</p>

              <p>Starfarer Adversaries: Legacy Bestiary is a collection of more than 200 classic fantasy monsters, updated for a science-fantasy universe!

              <p>With help from some friendly goblins and skittermanders, our folks in the warehouse have just finished sweeping away the last remnants of 2020 to make room for the year ahead. With fresh new inventory counts, we’ve come across some great finds that are getting low and won’t be restocked. </p> 
              <p>We’ve broken down our list a bit for you, because it’s cram-packed with items from Pathfinder – 1st and 2nd editions – and Starfinder goodies, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, even some fun PaizoCon glassware! </p> 
              <p>Don’t forget, you can use the code <b>holiday21</b> to save 10% off a single order through Sunday January 17th, so it’s a great time to save on these items before they run out! </p>

              <p>If you are new to Pathfinder or an Adventure Path, welcome! The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jb?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Abomination-Vaults-Players-Guide"><em>Player's Guide</em></a> is your spoiler free introduction for getting started. Inside you will find the following three chapters:</p> 
              <ol> 
               <li><h3>Coming Together</h3></li> 
               <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                <li>The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path begins near the small town of Otari on the southern shore of the Isle of Kortos. A robust and spoiler-free description of the town can be found in this player’s guide. While this gazetteer does mention things that aren’t frequently discussed in polite company (such as the rough crew that hangs out at the Crook’s Nook), the contents of this gazetteer are considered common knowledge among Otari’s citizens. It’s possible for some (or even all) of the heroes to hail from Otari, but that isn’t necessary. Although most of the campaign’s action takes place in the dungeon about a half hour to the north in the swampy Fogfen, the heroes will return to Otari many times and should come to rely on its people.<br> The heroes might or might not know each other, but all of them should have a friend in common: the town’s eccentric oddities merchant, Wrin Sivinxi.</li> 
               </ul> 
               <li><h3>Cosmic Caravan Pantheon</h3></li> 
               <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                <li>As friends of Wrin Sivinxi, the heroes all know that she follows a pantheon of deities collectively known as the Cosmic Caravan. Any hero who wants to can also follow this pantheon. The rules for following a pantheon are set forth on page 92 of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf/discuss&amp;page=7?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic">Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods and Magic</a>.</li> 
               </ul> 
               <li><h3>Otari Gazetteer</h3></li> 
               <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                <li>Otari is a thriving, diverse lumber town and trade port with a storied past and its fair share of sinister secrets. Founded by a group of adventurers over 400 years ago, the town has weathered attacks from kobolds and strange monsters, economic woes and windfalls, and cycles of prosperity and strife. Today, the town is a prosperous community and one of the largest settlements along the island’s southern coast, other than the metropolis of Absalom.</li> 
               </ul> 
              </ol> 
              <h3>Additional Information</h3> 
              <h4>Content Warning from Volume One, <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hs">Ruins of Gauntlight</a></em></h4> 
              <p>While Ruins of Gauntlight contains typical Pathfinder action and adventure, it also presents themes of suicide. Before you begin, understand that player consent (including that of the Game Master) is vital to a safe and fun play experience for everyone. You should talk with your players before beginning the adventure and modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate.</p> 
              <h4>Planning For The End</h4> 
              <p>The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path takes characters from 1st level to 10th level and concludes at about 11th level. There are certainly opportunities to continue the campaign (such as with the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix">Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path</a>, which starts at 11th level and begins in the next volume after Abomination Vaults concludes). As such, keep in mind that if you’ve got your eye on a particular 12th-level feat or 15th-level class feature, it’s not something you’ll likely get the chance to select during the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path.</p> 
              <p>The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path Player's Guide is by Ron Lundeen, with James Jacobs. The cover artist is Kiki Moch Rizky.</p>

               <p>Hello! I’m Mike Kimmel, and last week I joined the Organized Play team as the newest Organized Play Developer. I’ve been freelancing for Paizo for the past six years following my Top 4 placement during RPG Superstar 2014. Some of my recent work includes the upcoming Starfinder Society scenario <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026hq?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-316-The-Vast-Experiment-Fast-Choices">The Vast Experiment: Fast Choices</a>, as well as contributions to the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide">Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society</a> Guide and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026jv?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-4">Starfinder Alien Archive 4</a>. I am also the founder of Freelance Forge, a forum community where current and aspiring freelancers can network and hone their skills.</p> 
               <p>One of my most memorable experiences working with the Org Play program was volunteering as a GM for GenCon 2018. I got to run seven sessions of the second edition playtest and one interactive special. I also witnessed the debut of my own interactive special, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm">Pathfinder Society 10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm</a>. I’ll never forget that event, and I look forward to attending many more conventions in the future, in person and online.</p> 
               <p>When I’m not working on role-playing games, playing role-playing games, or thinking about role-playing games, I am probably doing something to relax: spending time with my family, reading a book, playing Zelda (again), walking my dogs, or forcing anyone in the radius of my dad joke aura to make Will saves. You can sometimes find me fumbling with Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/_MikeKimmel" target="_blank">@_MikeKimmel</a>.</p>

               <h3>Norgorber's Many Masks</h3> 
               <p>The evil god Norgorber is unusual in that he maintains many guises. His four aspects are Blackfingers, god of alchemy and poison; the Gray Master, god of thievery; Father Skinsaw, god of ritual murder; and the Reaper of Reputation, god of lies and secrets. His worshipers usually follow just one of these aspects, although the heroes in <em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em> discover something that those cultists dedicated to the worship of all four aspects of Norgorber might create. </p> 
               <p>Norgorber’s worshipers delight in being as crafty as they are cruel, and they might fashion any number of wicked items to further their sinister plans. Followers of Norgorber might create one of these masks, bearing the aspect of Norgorber they worship. </p> 
               <h4>Secret-Keeper’s Mask — Item 3+</h4> 
               <p><b>Rare, Divination, Enchantment, Invested, Magical</b></p> 
               <p><b>Usage</b> worn; <b>Bulk</b> — <br> Each of these full-face masks is made of stitched materials—often including humanoid skin—and has a single, bulbous eye. While wearing the mask, you gain a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Lie and the mask doesn’t impair your vision. The mask can also be activated, with an ability based on its type.</p> 
               <p><b>Type</b> Blackfingers; <b>Level</b> 3; Price 60 gp<br> This featureless mask is made of thin, papery skin. Its single eye is a fragile bubble of venom-filled glass.</p> 
               <p><b>Activate</b> [two-actions] Interact (divination); <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b> You twist the mask’s eye and peer at an object. You know whether the object is poison or has been poisoned, but you don’t learn the number or type of poisons present in the object.</p> 
               <p><b>Type</b> Gray Master; <b>Level</b> 5; <b>Price</b> 150 gp<br> This monochrome mask is made of tattered rags of gray and black cloth and bleached fragments of skin. </p> 
               <p><b>Activate</b> [reaction] Interact (illusion, visual); <b>Trigger</b> You succeed on a Thievery check to Steal an item of negligible Bulk; <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b> You create an illusory duplicate of the item you just stole. This duplicate has the appropriate appearance and weight, but it doesn’t make sounds or generate smells. The illusion vanishes after 10 minutes, or earlier if anyone examines or manipulates the illusory duplicate (such as to try to use it).</p> 
               <p><b>Type</b> Father Skinsaw; <b>Level</b> 6; <b>Price</b> 250 gp<br> This mask is a patchwork of tanned skins, each with a distinctive scar. It is contorted into a caricature of a face with a leering eye. </p> 
               <p><b>Activate</b> [reaction] Interact; <b>Trigger</b> You deal persistent bleed damage to a creature; <b>Frequency</b> once per day; Effect The bleeding wound you cause is particularly mutilating. The DC of flat checks to recover from the persistent bleed damage is increased by 2, and the target creature has a –2 status penalty to Deception, Diplomacy, and Performance checks while it is bleeding and for 1 minute after it ceases bleeding.</p> 
               <p><b>Type</b> Reaper of Reputation; <b>Level</b> 3; <b>Price</b> 60 gp<br> This mask is made of gray and black tiles sewn together. It has a messy, inky spiral over the mouth. </p> 
               <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact (auditory, linguistic); <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b> You touch the mask’s spiral and identify a target creature within 30 feet. For the next 10 minutes, any normal speech you utter can, at your discretion, be inaudible to all creatures except the target creature, who can hear you clearly regardless of ambient sound so long as it is within 1 mile.

              <p>And now, we delve back into the bowels of the earth to reveal the final batch of figures in this amazing set! We’ve shown off the many Darklands denizens like drow, deep gnomes, and urdefhans in the set, but none of the fey, so let’s remedy that, shall we? Here’s we’ve got the Leprechaun, Grodair, Lurker in Light, and Norn. Of these, none is really linked heavily to the Darklands, but they can nevertheless serve as potential foes or allies of adventurers in just about any campaign, including those set beneath Golarion’s surface. The Leprechaun is a Small common figure, the Grodair a Medium common, Lurker in Light a Small uncommon, and the Norn is a Large rare. </p>

              <p>Fey are generally represented as the guardians or custodians of the natural world, so it’s fitting that we also included the Arboreal Regent in this set to accompany them. This Huge uncommon figure can serve both as a treefolk character as well as an animated or awakened tree (which isn’t the same thing!) Similarly, the Wood Giant, also a Huge uncommon figure, can serve as friend or foe depending on what the party wants to do with the forests it calls home. The decidedly less amiable Cavern Troll, a Large uncommon figure, serves a less foliated, more crystalline foil to his fellow giants, and fits right in among the Darklands’ many threats.</p>

              <p>Rounding things out in Darklands Rising are two rather frightening animals, two classic fantasy beasts, and a weird aquatic aberration. They are the Emperor Cobra (Large uncommon), Giant Toad (Large uncommon), Leucrotta (Large uncommon), Peryton (Medium common), and Quoppopak (Large uncommon).</p>

              <p>And that, as they say in show business, is a wrap! Pathfinder Battles: Darklands Rising is available for preorder now and will be available everywhere miniatures are sold on February 3. Next week, we’ll take off for the far horizons of distant worlds as we take our first look at Starfinder Battles: Planets of Peril, the first full set of prepainted plastic miniatures based on the Starfinder game and setting. See you then!</p>

              <p itemprop="description">We are very excited to be given the opportunity to partner with Paizo, and knew we had to try something new with it, though at that stage we were unsure what that would be. After we had met with the Paizo team for the first time, and the creative juices were flowing, the idea of doing something big for Pathfinder Second Edition kicked in. We had an interesting thought: <em>what if you could truly, completely customize your dice to your character?</em> Not only by selecting dice colors that match the color palette of your character but also unique glyphs to represent their class, their abilities, their weapons, and their choice of spells. </p> 
              <p>Introducing <em>Adventurer’s Curated Dice Collection</em> by Level Up Dice - a customizable dice set that fits all of your character needs. A way to not only purchase the specific dice you need to make the most out of your hard earned gold, but also a way to curate a set for your wizard with force damage d4’s and fire damage d6’s, or your ranger with their sword d12 and bow d8 (including the deadly d10!) </p> 
              <p>The first step in fleshing out this idea was taking in the sheer scale of this project. Level Up Dice decided: if we’re going to create something completely new, we have to do this the right way. Now, to do this and to limit risk we need to use a material we’re familiar with and is highly customizable, which is where we decided on aluminum. It allows us to make the 200+ highly detailed glyphic designs we need to implement this new system properly. This also contributes to working toward the goal of doing this across multiple materials... (hint hint)</p>

              </div> 
              <p>To show you exactly what we mean, we’ve taken Alex, the CEO and mastermind behind LUD, and made a set specifically for his rogue he’s playing: two rogue d20’s, three precision damage d6’s to cover the sneak attack, and two knife d4’s for their dual weilding daggers. It's all he needs, no fluff, no dice sitting in the corner of the tray unused!</p> 
              <p>Once this process was extended to the whole team the excitement was palpable, and we will be sharing our teams sets with you all very soon! For now, the one thing we found incredible and something we thought would get you excited is that we have a potential of over 8,000 dice to choose from in this initial launch alone! Below, we’ve displayed a small selection of these dice for you to see!</p>

              <p>With so many options, we knew almost immediately that the best way to bring this to all of you would be with a Kickstarter. It was the only way to properly manage the myriad factors in a project of this scale. So, what now? </p> 
              <p>We launched our Kickstarter today, January 12, and we want you to join us on this journey! You can click <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/levelupdice/level-up-dices-complete-character-dice" target="_blank">here</a> to check it out, and we can’t thank you enough for doing so. It’s only through you, the player, that any of this is possible. So join us in spreading the news so that we can create and innovate with our partners at Paizo. <br> Thank you. You’ll hear more from us soon!</p>

              <p>A special image will indicate the scenarios that directly influence the Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot. Scenarios without this branding are stand-alone adventures that don’t tie directly to the events of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. The introduction to the metaplot is an adventure by Mike Kimmel (hey, that’s me!), titled “Year of Shattered Sanctuaries.” It’s a full-length scenario for characters of levels 1–4.</p>

              <p>The Year of Shattered Sanctuaries debuts at PaizoCon Europe Online 2021 (August 19–22), along with two other full-length introductory scenarios for characters of levels 1–2, much like the launch of Starfinder Society Year 4 at PaizoCon Online in May. Stay tuned for more information, and some answers to frequently asked questions, in next week’s blog!</p>
