  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"><b>25 Lamashan</b></p> \n\
  \     <p>I’ve visited observational posts on asteroids less lonely than the Citadel\
  \ on Aucturn. As I crossed the courtyard today, I saw no one, heard not a soul.\
  \ Not in the courtyard, nor in the halls that open onto its damp cobblestones, nor\
  \ again from the towers rising high above me—wet-black and spine-like, helixing\
  \ and branching—to poke like bony fingers at an ochre sky.</p> \n     <p>As Aucturn\
  \ daylight is brief and dim, I tarried before a carapaced rail near the bridge to\
  \ the Nisk Archives. A spot there overlooks a steep drop to the levels below, where\
  \ the bases of the towers splay into the ground like the roots of a tree. All below\
  \ appeared quiet and still and yet not peaceful, conveying nothing like tranquility—\
  more the patience of an ambush predator, of something which stares back. </p> \n\
  \     <p>In total that day, I saw just three people. Two in the Archives: the librarian\
  \ and a hooded figure slouching through the Stacks, the latter glimpsed for only\
  \ a second. A bespectacled man muttered nervously to himself in the courtyard as\
  \ I returned to the Defenestrom dormitories, a tumorous growth sprouting from the\
  \ side of his neck, bobbing with every syllable.</p> \n     <p>Everyone here is\
  \ so cloistered and isolated that you’d never guess more than a hundred thousand\
  \ souls reside in the Citadel. In quiet moments, however, you can imagine them sealed\
  \ away—below, above, around—and, as you imagine them, you inevitably imagine they\
  \ bend their attention toward you, and you scurry faster. Or perhaps I project.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Of my visit to the Archives, there is little to talk about.</p> \n \
  \    <p>They weren’t why I came anyway.</p> \n     <p><b>26 Lamashan</b></p> \n\
  \     <p>I’m told machines are here which purify the air, but I hear nothing and\
  \ have never seen one. I can’t escape the impression that the towers themselves\
  \ breathe in the poisonous yellow air and sigh forth oxygen. I wonder what would\
  \ befall me if, of a sudden, they all chose to hold their breath. </p> \n     <p><b>27\
  \ Lamashan</b></p> \n     <p>When does a series of noises become a song?</p> \n\
  \     <p>Is it a song if it’s arrhythmic? </p> \n     <p>What if its patterns are\
  \ so broad, you can listen for hours before those sounds repeat? I once did exactly\
  \ this, huddled over a receiver high above this planet, twelve and terrified, monitoring\
  \ signals while my father salvaged the Gjálfrmarr, a ruin of a ship still drifting\
  \ over Aucturn.</p> \n     <p>What if the whine of wings, the clucking of proboscises,\
  \ and telepathic blurtings of orphaned Aklo nouns are unpleasant to hear? </p> \n\
  \     <p>Is it music then? </p> \n     <p>The processional noises of orocoran monks\
  \ have all these qualities. </p> \n     <p>Every day, I sneak from the Archives\
  \ to witness their cacophonies, to record, to verify, each time with a twinge of\
  \ guilt; I’m here on fellowship for work I’m not doing. But this may be my only\
  \ trip to Aucturn. And the song calls me. </p> \n     <p>A song, I say.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Its patterns repeat every three hours.</p> \n     <p>Every day the patterns\
  \ have been the same. </p> \n     <p>The monks only make this music when lined up\
  \ before the Seep of the Earth, a fane on the sepulchral ground level of the Citadel.\
  \ </p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>It rained\
  \ this morning, viscous, jaundiced drops that sizzled on the stone and bone of the\
  \ towers. Though the air is safe to breathe, the rain is far from safe, and so I\
  \ found myself navigating the passages and stairwells of the Occular Ward, a task\
  \ for which neither paper map nor computer records proved entirely helpful, and\
  \ I soon lost my way.</p> \n     <p>It was only by blind (and momentarily terrifying)\
  \ luck that I stumbled into the procession of monks then winding through passages\
  \ near the Seep. They paid me no heed. Eyes glazed forward. Proboscises twitched.\
  \ Wings buzzed under robes, a mumbled hum. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     <p>I sat on flagstones and watched. </p> \n     <p>Shuffle, step, buzz.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A psychic blurt of a word in the Aklo tongue, screamed by a hundred\
  \ nearby minds: <em>Uulth</em>. And an image entangled within it, a <em>fountain</em>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Wary of discovery, I’d never been as close to the monks as I was now.\
  \ Had I been missing psychic imagery all along?</p> \n     <p>Over three hours,\
  \ I noted more images. </p> \n     <p>A stairwell. </p> \n     <p>An obelisk with\
  \ wings. </p> \n     <p>A jagged alley with a stone floor that climbed and fell.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>All knotted to blurt-screamed words.</p> \n     <p>Step, shuffle.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Every step exactly the same length.</p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"\
  50%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>Nomadic cultures yet to invent writing sometimes\
  \ employ a memory-palace trick called a <em>songline</em>. They map a song to the\
  \ geography of their world. Into this song they encode their lore. As they travel,\
  \ they perform their song, as though the tribe is a needle on a phonograph, each\
  \ landmark a music cue. And they remember. </p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"\
  50%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>After the rain stopped, I stayed late at the Archives\
  \ surrounded by a constellation of city maps that failed to capture the three-dimensional\
  \ madness of the Citadel. I worked by the glow of a table lantern, the Archives\
  \ as always an undead space, neither alive with activity nor ever quite closed,\
  \ the silence blemished by bumps without visible authors.</p> \n     <p>In time,\
  \ I found it: the Sarrocian Ward. Sealed off and reportedly forbidden. </p> \n \
  \    <p>Home to the Fountain of Uulth. </p> \n     <p>The Aeskerian Stairs. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Winged Obelisk of Sarroco. </p> \n     <p>One city engineer’s maps\
  \ were quite precise. I counted thirteen monk-steps from the Fountain of Uulth to\
  \ the top of the Askerian Stairs. In the song, thirteen proboscian clucks separate\
  \ the blurting of those landmarks. </p> \n     <p>Three hours’ mapping produced\
  \ something like a spiral, a vortex. </p> \n     <p>Eyes blurred with exhaustion,\
  \ I returned to the Defenestrom, confident of a breakthrough but with no sense what\
  \ it meant.</p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n   \
  \  <p>Have you received my first few entries, Meera? The silence in place of your\
  \ response unsettles me. You’ve heard me in my sleep, humming and smacking echoes\
  \ of what I heard as a child, obsessively cycling through them as though in search\
  \ of a missing ending. And so I’d hoped you’d understand that my departure is no\
  \ referendum on our affair. Please reply, even if angry, so I may cross out at least\
  \ one hypothesis concerning your silence. In notes I’ve not sent, I’ve imagined\
  \ many. </p> \n     <p><b>28 Lamashan</b></p> \n     <p>I’m shaking, sheets damp\
  \ with perspiration. </p> \n     <p>What the hell was that dream?</p> \n     <p><b>29\
  \ Lamashan</b></p> \n     <p>Finally, a response bearing your signature. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Yet the audio file contains just a laugh, one that does not sound like\
  \ yours. </p> \n     <p>I must admit to feeling unsettled. The repeated dream last\
  \ night doesn’t help.</p> \n     <p>If, indeed, it was a dream.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ remain in my room. Read the humorist Josadine. All I hear is that laugh.</p> \n\
  \     <p>It sounds like the buzzing of wings.</p> \n     <p><b>30 Lamashan</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Three nights now. Same dream every time, except—</p> \n     <p>No, I\
  \ get ahead of myself. The phenomenon I study already involves psychic imagery.\
  \ I can no longer ignore the possibility I may be suffering side effects beyond\
  \ the psychological. </p> \n     <p>This then must be part of my record: </p> \n\
  \     <p>In the dream, I race through the Citadel. Places I’ve never been, imagery\
  \ as vivid as the room around me now. Chiaroscuro and shadow. Damp flagstone under\
  \ bare feet. Odors of rot.</p> \n     <p>Also, behind me: the leathery flap of wings\
  \ and click of talons on stone.</p> \n     <p>When I glance over my shoulder, always\
  \ by the Fountain, the creature stalking me bends all light to it, everything whorled\
  \ and distorted, as though terror has its own gravity, its own singularity. Ahead,\
  \ everything to either side of the avenue directly before me stretches and curves.\
  \ I try breaking left. My feet slow, and my pursuer gains.</p> \n     <p>Panicked,\
  \ resuming the forward path, I stumble down the Aeskerian Stairs, which is as far\
  \ as I make it the first night.</p> \n     <p>On the second, the dream ends as I\
  \ lurch into Myopic Alley.</p> \n     <p>The third night, I reach the end of the\
  \ alley. Stand in a puddle that reeks of decay and buzzes with biting things.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There, a closed door waits, plain and patient.</p> \n     <p>I feel\
  \ like I’ve been driven here. Why this door?</p> \n     <p>I refuse to open it.\
  \ Instead I turn, certain I’ll be torn asunder by the tidal forces of the Beast\
  \ that Follows.</p> \n     <p>Then I awaken, feet damp, flesh swelling around a\
  \ bite on my ankle.</p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center>\
  \ \n     <p>I’ll be forced to follow the orocoran path again, when next I dream.\
  \ I’m sure of it.</p> \n     <p>I’ll stand before the Door again.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ must plan.</p> \n     <p>I have no plan.</p> \n     <p><b>31 Lamashan</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Too terrified to sleep last night. A small blessing.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ tried to find solutions in the Archives, but by afternoon could no longer keep\
  \ my eyes open as I read.</p> \n     <p>I hear the song every minute now. It lulls.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Sleep beckons and will not be denied.</p> \n     <center>\n      <hr\
  \ width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>Consider, Meera—</p> \n     <p>(Are you\
  \ there?)</p> \n     <p>—what if the thing pursuing me wants to <em>stop</em> me\
  \ from opening the Door? </p> \n     <p>Perhaps what lies on the other side means\
  \ it harm.</p> \n     <p>I think: <em>Let them fight</em>.</p> \n     <p>It’s the\
  \ only solution I can think of.</p> \n     <p>Tonight, I’ll open the Door.</p>\n\
  \     <p> </p>\n     <p>And if all goes well, I will write again.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
