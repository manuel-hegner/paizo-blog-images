  >Valeros</a>. Today I’m going to talk about friend and boon companion to everyone\
  \ (unless perhaps your name is Meligaster), the iconic bard <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5la2j?Meet-the-Iconics-Lem\"\
  >Lem</a>.</p> \n      <p>“Player types” is one of those perennial topics in games\
  \ and game design, equally as likely to come up in discussion of everything from\
  \ the first tabletop RPG to the latest AAA console title. Anyone who’s looked into\
  \ any of the academic, professional, or hobby-level study of games and gaming is\
  \ likely to have run across at least one attempt to analyze things from the player\
  \ point of view. Whether it’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types\"\
  >Bartle’s Taxonomy</a>, lists of fantasy roleplaying archetypes, <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes\"\
  >3 well-known player psychographics</a>, or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNS_theory\"\
  >G/N/S model</a>, both gamers and game designers frequently revisit the (important!)\
  \ idea that different parts of games are better for different kinds of game experiences.\
  \ There are many examples of this in PACG, but few stand out as clearly as our awesome\
  \ halfling helper, Lem.</p> \n      <p>When we first put together characters for\
  \ <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, we knew that we wanted Lem to be good at all sorts\
  \ of things. As a bard, we wanted him to have a bunch of skills. Mike flat-out refused\
  \ to let him out the door without Knowledge. Gaby wanted him to be charming and\
  \ friendly, and Paul and I both wanted to make sure that he was good enough at a\
  \ variety of things that he could choose to fill any gaps in your particular party.\
  \ That said, he’s a halfling with a troubled history, so he clearly had some weaknesses.\
  \ We gave him a large Knowledge bonus, made him a Charisma powerhouse to sometimes\
  \ rival Seoni, and made sure he had a respectable starting point for Ranged weapons\
  \ and both Arcane and Divine spellcasting. For his cards list, he has a good spread\
  \ of card types, letting him dabble in any type while also giving him multiple choices\
  \ for focus. A large hand size represents his inherent versatility as well as a\
  \ relative fragility, and the option to get into either weapons or light armor means\
  \ that he can make use of almost any card you find.</p> \n      <p>For most people,\
  \ though, Lem’s powers are really where he shines brightest. With a long list of\
  \ skills and proficiencies, we knew that we’d need his powers to be relatively concise\
  \ (a theory that I think we proved, the bad way, in Skull &amp; Shackles). We wanted\
  \ to emphasize his helpfulness and his versatility, so he got one power for each.\
  \ The first lets him spend cards from his hand to help other nearby characters at\
  \ <em>whatever they wanted to do</em>. This power has a cost—putting a card from\
  \ your hand on the bottom of your deck—which helps make it an interesting choice.\
  \ Over time, players are likely to realize that this “cost” is often a benefit:\
  \ if you have cards in your hand that are useful some of the time, but just not\
  \ right now, you can tuck them away for later use, opening up space to draw new\
  \ cards without the increased risk of death that comes from just discarding at the\
  \ end of your turn. </p> \n      <p>The second power helps create the “just the\
  \ thing!” moments, since it’s easy for him to swap out a “good, but not right now”\
  \ card for an especially relevant card from his discard pile. These two powers together\
  \ let Lem invest in a wide variety of cards, even cards with potentially niche utility.\
  \ If you find that a particular card isn’t useful right now, you can recharge it\
  \ to help (first power) or swap it for something more relevant in your discard pile\
  \ (second power). There’s also an element of mastery at play here—once you get a\
  \ good handle on the game, you realize that after Lem casts a spell, he might want\
  \ to recharge it—and thus get it back for “free,” but not immediately. Or he might\
  \ want to fail to recharge it, so he can swap another spell for it next turn. The\
  \ latter approach costs him a “hit point” if he’s going to take damage, but it lets\
  \ him have more control over when he has certain key cards in his hand.</p> \n \

  \ a lot—of help from Lem.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>When we were putting together\
  \ characters for <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, we knew we wanted to change things\
  \ up a little. Ideally, the characters would feel recognizably themselves, but would\
  \ also be changed by their experiences at sea. (If you’re familiar with Lem’s history,\
  \ you probably understand that falling victim to a press gang is especially transformative\
  \ for him!) While S&amp;S was letting us swap in some new iconics, we all agreed\
  \ we wanted to bring back Lem in some form: Swashbuckling Lem, Sea Captain Lem,\
  \ Dread Pirate Lem.</p> \n      <p>With that in mind, and with apparently wanton\
  \ disregard for the extra pain we were dropping on the shoulders of the Paizo layout\
  \ team (<em>To Sonia, Crystal, and Sarah: we apologize. Deeply. Again.</em>), we\
  \ added Craft to Lem’s list of skills (enabling both Alchemy and ship repair) and\
  \ gave him our new power for Finesse weapons. This new, tougher Lem swapped a spell\
  \ out for a weapon, dropped hand size by one, and gained weapon proficiency. His\
  \ “resourcefulness” power was reduced to let him get back recharged cards more quickly\
  \ (by shuffling), and his “helping” power was increased to let it apply to himself.\
  \ It’s still possible to build a super-helpful Lem, but now he can also be a bit\
  \ more selfish if he wants.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_SSLemFront.png\"\

  ></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">He <em>is</em> the very model of a modern\
  \ major pirate lord!</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>For his <em>Bard Class Deck</em>\
  \ treatment, we wanted to change the focus again, so we looked more to the magical\
  \ side of bardishness—but not bardiche-ness. (This also contrasted nicely with the\
  \ other bards in that deck.) Class Deck Lem got a die bump to the top-end d12 Charisma,\
  \ pushed his hand size back up to variety-and-fragility, and focused his powers\
  \ more on spells. His helping power gained a new trick: if he used a Healing card\
  \ to help others, he also got a little self-healing out of it; everybody wins!</p>\

  \      </div> \n      <p>Finally, we come to the new <em>Core Set</em>. We wanted\
  \ to build a friendly, helpful, “classic” Lem, using our new templates and layout\
  \ methods. The switch to a vertical layout let us add yet another skill to one of\
  \ our skill-monkey characters without causing the designers so much pain (again,\
  \ we’re sorry!); this let us give Lem Acrobatics out of the gate, which makes him\
  \ seem more like the halfling he is, and also opens up some weapons options without\
  \ requiring two lines of powers text. Adding Instrument proficiency lets us cleanly\
  \ represent his facility without recourse to the clumsy “if you have the Bard or\
  \ Skald trait” wording on each instrument. </p> \n      <p>His Knowledge and spellcasting\
  \ skills drop back down to “great” (from “outstanding”), and his first power lets\
  \ him make up the difference when it counts most. His deck list spreads out evenly\
  \ while giving him at least one weapon (you might choose a strong Acrobatics-based\
  \ weapon, or one of Core’s new helpful weapons). Finally, his second power gives\
  \ him back some of that resourcefulness while avoiding the potential repetitive\
  \ play concerns I always drone on about, and also moves the processing to the end\
  \ of the turn (while the next player is likely already starting).</p> \n      <div\

  \      </div> \n      <p>Once you get a couple adventures under his belt, you can\
  \ choose to focus in either <b>Busker</b> or <b>Poet Laureate</b>. Both roles are\
  \ meant to reflect the performance aspects of Lem, with Busker offering access to\
  \ some nifty street-performer tricks for getting by, especially in Urban settings\
  \ (my favorite being “I’m afraid I cannot fight you… <em>but they can!</em>”). Poet\
  \ Laureate leans more towards the occult power of Lem’s performances. Also, who\
  \ doesn’t like drawing cards at the start of their turn?</p> \n      <div class=\"\
