  artist: "a mighty champion, but such was the power of the god that he remained alive\
    \ in two pieces. Now his mindless body thrashes recklessly, and his head is lost\
    \ and presumably rotted away to a skull. But there are some that say the skull\
    \ still thinks and can control a tiny measure of power, and if it and the body\
    \ were ever reunited, Ydersius would heal and lead his people in an attack on\
    \ the surface world. Gods & Magic, scribed by the newest addition to Paizo staff,\
    \ theologian Sean K Reynolds, hits the shelves in October. F. Wesley Schneider\
    \ Pathfinder Managing Editor"
