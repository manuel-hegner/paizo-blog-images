  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Howdy! Joe Pasini here, Starfinder developer\
  \ and monstrous humanoid. One of my favorite things about Starfinder is that it's\
  \ chock full of alien creatures that you can not only crush, kill, and destroy,\
  \ but also befriend, bedazzle—and become!</p> \n    <p>Today we'll meet a few of\
  \ the 16 new playable species presented in <span><i><a href=\"/products/btpya20r?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-2\"\
  >Alien Archive 2</a></i></span>, along with notes from their writers.</p> \n   \

  \ \n     <p>Careful readers of the Starfinder Core Rulebook might have noticed a\
  \ brief write-up in the setting chapter about Daimalko. On that blasted planet,\
  \ horrific colossi have rampaged among the ruins of two once-great civilizations\
  \ since an event called the Awakening. The survivors—the damai—have turned to empathic\
  \ leaders and their powerful magical orbs to keep these roving beasts away. That\
  \ planet is one of my strange little Starfinder children, and in Alien Archive 2,\
  \ I had the privilege of dropping another piece of Daimalko into the game—now you\
  \ can play a damai! When you do, your racial traits will reflect these people's\
  \ time subsisting in underground caverns, as well as their now-innate survival senses.\
  \ For those interested in Daimalkan lore, the write-up also includes the story of\
  \ Reirali Kokolu, the first Guardian who both discovered the orbs linked to the\
  \ colossi and united the disparate pockets of survivors into the pseudocivilization\
  \ that exists on the planet today. If Daimalkan lore—or kaiju survivors, empaths,\
  \ or scrappers—are your thing, playing a damai might be right up your alley!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>—Amanda Hamon Kunz, Managing Developer</p> \n     <p>I wrote about Orry,\
  \ the home planet of the phentomites, in the Starfinder Core Rulebook. The location\
  \ was inspired by a homebrew Runequest game I played over a decade ago, where the\
  \ players and GM worked together to collaboratively create an original setting.\
  \ It was a thrilling creative exercise for everyone, and though we only played that\
  \ game a handful of times, the experience has stuck with me. Of course, we pictured\
  \ humans exploring this world's floating islands, but when you adapt something for\
  \ a science-fantasy game, you get to make things a little more… alien. While they\
  \ weren't named or described in the Core Rulebook, the inhabitants of Orry were\
  \ illustrated, and I had a hand in that as well. When it came time for Alien Archive\
  \ 2, I pitched giving these folks full stats and a bit more information about their\
  \ home world and culture. Now that they are fully entrenched in the Starfinder canon,\
  \ I just hope I can expand further on the phentomites at some point in the future!</p>\

  \     <p>I did the embri! In the spirit of honesty, I hadn't even noticed these\
  \ mollusk-people tucked in the Starfinder Core Rulebook at first. But I discovered\
  \ their write-up was really evocative: it starts with their eerily orderly society,\
  \ then reveals that Hell is behind it all. Cue the ominous music! I tried to keep\
  \ the same themes in my <i>Alien Archive 2</i> entry, but I had to think more about\
  \ embri masks. Why do these emotionless critters wear them? Probably as identifiers,\
  \ but maybe also because showing even a little bit of emotion is exceptionally rude\
  \ in their society, so they're socially expected. I thought about giving the ubiquitous\
  \ masks some game benefit, but ultimately went the other direction—not wearing a\
  \ mask makes an embri feel exposed and dangerously expressive, so they take penalties\
  \ when not wearing one. If you play an embri, you'll want to keep your mask in place.\
  \ The <i>hivemask</i> magic item helps you work well with your teammates—and keep\
  \ a close eye on them!</p> \n     <p>—Ron Lundeen, Pathfinder Adventure Path Developer</p>\

  \   <p>Hi! I wrote bolida and osharu. The bolida were my attempt at the molefolk\
  \ trope—except instead of being inspired by adorable rodents, they're horrifyingly\
  \ gigantic centipedes, 'cause why not! They otherwise stay true to the trope: a\
  \ hardy, subterranean people who minded their own business deep underground for\
  \ centuries. They didn't really care (or even know?) about the outside world until\
  \ they were discovered by accident. The osharu were quite shamelessly inspired by\
  \ the Bajorans from Star Trek. I was enamored of the idea of a spacefaring society\
  \ whose religion takes the forefront in their culture. The osharus' cities were\
  \ actually inspired by my daily commute through a pretty much town-sized college\
  \ campus. I thought it would be interesting to have metropolis-sized settlements\
  \ composed entirely of different departments of learning, where everybody worked\
  \ together for a common cause (in this case, scientific and spiritual enlightenment).\
  \ I must admit it was intimidating writing two races and cultures from scratch,\
  \ with no previous material to use! I hope y'all enjoy my additions to the Starfinder\
  \ universe!</p> \n     <p>—L Pellazar, Editor</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a> \n      <br><i>Illustration by Mary Jane Pajaron</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Design\
  \ of the quorlus is rooted in history and novelty. My assignment was to create a\
  \ unique quadruped species that's not like a centaur. Long ago, I really loved dralasites—\
  a species of little, shapeable blobs who could have multiple legs. (They're from\
  \ the Star Frontiers RPG.) I started with bloblike, and then decided to use environmental\
  \ extremes. What if quorlus adapted to harsh tectonics? From that came the silicon-based\
  \ physiology and geothermic nature, along with no need to breathe. It also sparked\
  \ a culture of practical, skilled engineers and miners who find it easy to accept\
  \ loss. The seismic violence of the quorlu home world instilled within them a spirit\
  \ of cooperation and love of peace. I also decided quorlu voices must be highly\
  \ resonant, carrying through earth and stone (and quorlu \"flesh\") rather than\
  \ air. A short leap led to the idea that other species might find these sonorous\
  \ voices pleasing. Then, I integrated them with Pact Worlds species as ideal explorers\
  \ and surveyors of harsh environments. That's the quorlu, in a lithic shell.</p>\

  ></a> \n      <br><i>Illustration by Raph Lomotan</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>I'm\
  \ responsible for adding the kanabo, which are oni (ja noi)/hobgoblin crossbreeds.\
  \ I wrote up the kanabo in Distant Shores for Pathfinder, and I thought that as\
  \ a species of mystic outsider goblinoid warriors they were perfect for the science-fantasy\
  \ feel of Starfinder. Of course since we haven't introduced either oni or hobgoblins\
  \ to the Starfinder universe yet, I had to write both of those up for the book as\
  \ well. That meant establishing what hobgoblins are like in the universe after the\
  \ Gap, and if ever there was a group that seemed well-suited to the risks to pre-Drift\
  \ space travel, the ruthless, organized hobgoblins fit the bill. That allows them\
  \ to have spread far and wide from their origins on Golarion. With that in place,\
  \ having ja noi be oni champions embraced by nations of expansionist hobgoblins\
  \ gives a strong background for what kanabo origins are likely to be. Both hobgoblins\
  \ and kanabo are available as PC races.</p> \n     <p>—Owen K.C. Stephens, Starfinder\
