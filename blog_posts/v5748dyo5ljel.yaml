  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Stepping through the heavy marble doors, Alahazra\
  \ felt the jeers and laughter of the crowd ringing in her ears. Next to her, the\
  \ surly elf breathed heavily with exertion. The air wafting past him took on the\
  \ heavy salt note of sweat below the sharp metallic tang of the potions he carried.\
  \ The camel race had been more difficult and dangerous than expected and, worst\
  \ of all, had been deeply embarrassing. But empires are built on the vulgarities\
  \ of those in power. Muminofrah, who had the ear of the Ruby Prince himself, was\
  \ exceptionally petty. Still, camel spit and grimacing flattery were the price for\
  \ their prize: a piece of serpentine—a stamp carved with a name better than any\
  \ key. Well, when it came to dealing with Osirion bureaucrats, anyway.</p> \n  \

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Shh!</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Dark and quiet, the twisting\
  \ chambers of the Great Library of Tephu echoed with the footsteps of curators and\
  \ the hush of papyrus turned by diligent students. Alahazra remembered the sound\
  \ from a sunny afternoon long ago—before the gods struck her eyes—spent with her\
  \ tutor learning ancient script. Sometimes she missed reading. This vast repository\
  \ was only the public face of the library, the oracle knew. Below the stacks that\
  \ held dull histories, philosophies, and trade records lay a trove of terrible secrets.\
  \ More than a thousand years of renovation had pushed these chambers deep underground,\
  \ where the human librarians dared not tread.</p> \n     <p>Footsteps approached.\
  \ They held the certainty of a library curator. \"We have the permission of Muminofrah\
  \ herself to enter the Vault of Hidden Wisdom,\" Alahazra said as she held up the\
  \ stamp of favor, her low, soft voice husky with dust from the chariot race. The\
  \ curator coughed, \"You need Governor An-Keret for that. No one enters those chambers\
  \ without her approval.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Couldn't you show us the way?\" Alahazra\
  \ purred, reaching out to stroke the cheek of the nervous librarian. The curator's\
  \ skin was soft, unweathered, and suddenly warm as she blushed. \"Follow me,\" she\
  \ whispered. Past several creaking doors and down an uncountable number of marble\
  \ stairs, the curator's feet stopped. \"The Head Librarian went back here. We will\
  \ have to wait.\"</p> \n     <p>The Symbol of Fear inscribed upon the door hummed\
  \ with arcane malfeasance. Damiel set his bag on the ground with a clatter. \"I\
  \ have something for this,\" he mumbled, more to himself than anyone. \"So do I,\"\
  \ Alahazra replied, stretching sensuously as her limbs lengthened into cloudlike\
  \ tendrils. A heartbeat later, the door clicked open as if unlocked from behind.</p>\

  \ \n     <p>The lack of light in the deeper rooms of the library didn't bother Alahazra,\
  \ but her companions stumbled and kicked loose rocks as they navigated through the\
  \ labyrinthine shelving. The hard sound of claws on stone stopped her in her tracks.\
  \ \"Shhh,\" she snapped. But it was too late. The undead thing, home among the dark,\
  \ and hungry for knowledge itself, had found them. Its massive leonine form wrapped\
  \ in immaculate linen, Alahazra could hear the bones of the mummified sphinx creak\
  \ as it approached.</p> \n     <p>The little librarian scampered to safety as the\
  \ oracle and the alchemist prepared their attack. They would have to be careful:\
  \ any destruction of the library would bring down its protectors upon their heads.</p>\

  \ the last bits of the necromantic abomination fizzled away in holy light, another\
  \ set of footsteps approached from the furthest corner of the room, followed by\
  \ the soft slither of scaly things. \"You were not looking for my friend there,\
  \ I take it.\" The medusa's voice was filled with gravel, and without mercy. \"\
  I can show you tomes. Secret things. For a price.\" Her forked tongue glided over\
  \ her teeth.</p> \n     <p>Behind Alahazra, the little curator clutched her robes\
  \ and squeaked, \"She's real.\" The elf stood back; diplomacy was not his forte.\
  \ The burns from the last time he attempted to impress someone were yet healing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Deka An-Keret—we need to see her,\" Alahazra boomed with authority.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Come,\" the medusa hissed, leading them even deeper into secrets so\
  \ dark the parchment had never seen the light of day.</p> \n     <p>Liz Spain<br>\
