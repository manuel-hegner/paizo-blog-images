  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I find that every time I take time\
  \ off to visit family at the end of the year, I bring a project to work on in my\
  \ spare time. As I packed my bags and finished my last minute Christmas shopping,\
  \ the Adventure Path section of my Pathfinder bookshelf begged my attention. There\
  \ huddled <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods\"><em>Iron Gods</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/giantslayer\"><em>Giantslayer</em></a>\
  \ between a support group of other volumes, staring out at me with what I surely\
  \ imagined were the tear-streaked puppy dog eyes of misfit toys positively quivering\
  \ with sadness. This hallucinatory guilt trip continued, even as I tried to show\
  \ that I had downloaded all twelve PDFs for review as though it were some sci-fi\
  \ version of the Twelve Days of Christmas. Even while I watched the latest Star\
  \ Wars installment with my family, I had the premonition that some Ghost of Christmas\
  \ Past were hovering over my shoulder asking, \"Rey gets a spaceship. Why can't\
  \ we have spaceships in <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>?\"\
  \ By the end of it, I was running through the rain-flooded streets of the southeast\
  \ United States, shouting holiday well wishes, hefting Tiny Tim on my shoulders,\
  \ and telling him how to be one of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\"\
  ><em>Hell's Rebels</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>At least that's how I'd rather remember\
  \ it. Ultimately, it comes down to telling a fun story, and today we add two more\
  \ fun stories to the list of sanctioned Adventure Paths: <em>Iron Gods</em> and\
  \ <em>Giantslayer</em>. I recognize that it's been quite a while since I first acknowledged\
  \ that I would sanction these adventures for the organized play campaign, and I\
  \ know that some of you already started playing them. In the past, we've prohibited\
  \ retroactive credit for adventures played before the Chronicle sheets were available.\
  \ This time we're doing something a little different. If you are still in the middle\
  \ of playing one of these Adventure Paths but have not yet concluded it, you can\
  \ receive retroactive credit for all of that Adventure Path's earlier volumes the\
  \ next time you earn a Chronicle sheet for that campaign. For example, if you're\
  \ just about to finish #93 of <em>Giantslayer</em>, when you receive that Chronicle\
  \ sheet, you can also earn the Chronicle sheets for #91 and #92.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
