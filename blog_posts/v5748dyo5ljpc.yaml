  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It should come as no surprise that,\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy9r1y?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6\"><em>Bestiary\
  \ 6</em></a>, when you turn to the \"D\" section, you'll see some welcome and familiar\
  \ reptilian shapes. I'm talking about dinosaurs of course. Who doesn't love dinosaurs?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>OH! There's also true dragons.</p> \n    <p>One of the increasingly tricky\
  \ things to do with true dragons is that we've established them as existing in families\
  \ of five—not six, not four, but five. So when we do a set of true dragons in a\
  \ book, that's pretty much it for that category, which means the next bestiary that\
  \ comes along has to have a new category. Fortunately, there's a LOT of really cool\
  \ categories to explore when it comes to true dragons, and with <em>Bestiary 6</em>\
  \ I was able to explore one that I'd been itching for since <em>Bestiary 2</em>,\
  \ which presented dragons associated with several of the inner planes.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>I'm talking, of course, about <em>Bestiary 6</em>'s planar dragons. At first\
  \ I wasn't sure how to pull this off, since there are, after all, nine significant\
  \ outer planes, each of which map to one of the nine alignments. Doesn't that imply\
  \ that there should be 9 planar dragons? Perhaps... but in the end I decided it\
  \ did not. Instead, I picked five alignments out of nine. These planar dragons include\
  \ the crypt dragon (representing the neutral plane of the Boneyard*), the havoc\
  \ dragon (representing the chaotic good plane of Elysium), the infernal dragon (representing\
  \ the lawful evil of Hell), the paradise dragon (representing the lawful goodness\
  \ of Heaven), and the rift dragon (representing the chaos and evil of the Abyss),\
  \ yet the role these dragons play is not \"Dragons you meet on the outer planes.\"\
  \ Instead, they're dragons that you'll normally encounter on the Material Plane,\
  \ after migrating there via portals or other methods with a singular goal—to reshape\
  \ a material plane lair to reflect their home planes. In this way, we give this\
  \ group of five dragons a unique shared trait beyond \"they're all from the outer\
  \ planes,\" in a way that doesn't make a potential future category of other planar\
  \ dragons from existing. We'd just need to figure out a different theme or niche\
  \ other than \"dragons who come to the Material Plane to colonize\" is all.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The fact that this gives GMs one more vector to include other-planar\
  \ elements in Material Plane adventures without resorting to the old trope of \"\
  a wizard conjured things\" is icing on the cake.</p> \n    <p>Pictured below are\
  \ three of the five planar dragons. You'll need to wait for the book's release to\
  \ check out the havoc and infernal dragons, of course!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
