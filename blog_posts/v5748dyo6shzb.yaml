  \ Season 2022</h2> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week we announced PaizoCon\
  \ 2022, a four-day online event with a simultaneous three-day physical event. I\
  \ can’t wait to see you all online and in Seattle for this year’s convention! We’\
  ve got lots of exciting new products to announce via our online streams, as well\
  \ as tons of Organized Play games during the weekend. For more information, <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shz3?We-invite-you-to-PaizoCon-2022\"\
  >check out last week’s blog</a>.</p> \n      <p>If you’re interested in volunteering\
  \ during the event, please <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shz4?PaizoCon-2022-Call-for-Volunteers-and\"\
  >visit this blog</a> and fill out the attached form! We need GMs and volunteers\
  \ to make the event run, so even if you’re a first-time volunteer, we’d love to\
  \ have you. The deadline for early GM signups is <b>March 17</b>; signups received\
  \ after that date might not be cleared in time for game selection.</p> \n      <p>For\
  \ those waiting patiently for Gen Con volunteer information, I’m meeting with the\
  \ Gen Con committee this week to work on putting the final pieces into place. I’\
  m hoping to have volunteer signups open in the next couple of weeks.</p> \n    \

  >As we announced last week</a>, Year 5 of Starfinder Society is titled “Year of\
  \ Redemption’s Rise!” We’ll be launching this year’s storyline at PaizoCon 2022,\
  \ both online and at the physical show, with three brand-new scenarios. Strap in,\
  \ Starfinders, and get ready for a year like you’ve never seen!</p> \n      <p>It\
  \ was also announced that five new species will be made always-available, and three\
  \ new factions will be opened up to all Starfinders. Information on these changes,\
  \ as well as any other new rule changes, will be discussed further in a blog prior\
  \ to PaizoCon focused specifically on these changes. We don’t have any other major\
  \ program changes planned at this time, but if we change course, we’ll be sure to\
  \ let you know well before PaizoCon.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Sanctioning</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>We didn’t have any new material sanctioned this month, mostly because\
  \ there wasn’t much more material to sanction yet! Behind the scenes, we’re starting\
  \ to work on <em>Book of the Dead</em>, which I anticipate we’ll have ready for\
  \ its street date. We’re also working on polishing off sanctioning for the <em>Tyrant’\
  s Grasp</em> AP, the last of our PF1 Adventure Paths to be sanctioned, and we’re\
  \ looking ahead to <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>, the <em>Quest for the\
  \ Frozen Flame</em> and <em>Horizons of the Vast</em> APs, and even the <em>Drift\
  \ Crisis</em> rulebook. </p> \n      <p>While I have you all here, there were a\
  \ couple other topics I wanted to touch on.</p> \n      <p><b>Retroactive Sanctioning:</b>\
  \ In the past, there have been questions about how to handle chronicle sheets for\
  \ adventures that have been sanctioned after a group completes the adventure. Previously\
  \ the guidance has been that while this is technically illegal, there were ways\
  \ to skirt the system by having a fake wrap-up session, which is silly and weird,\
  \ so I’m doing away with that loophole.</p> \n      <p>Going forward, if an adventure\
  \ is sanctioned after your group completes it, your GM is <b>absolutely permitted</b>.\
  \ (and encouraged!) to issue chronicles for all interested players. These chronicles\
  \ should be applied as if your group had finished the session on the day you receive\
  \ the chronicle. You couldn’t, for example, retroactively apply it to a character\
  \ at an earlier date and bump all their future chronicles up in level; this breaks\
  \ the timestream and makes the Hounds of Tindalos mad.</p> \n      <p><b>Updated\
  \ Sanctioning Documents:</b> Wayyyyy back in August we <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shrt?Organized-Play-Update-Increased-Rewards-for\"\
  >announced an update to our sanctioning documents</a> and the increase in Reputation\
  \ that would come along with it. And then, y’know, we had a busy few months. However,\
  \ I am now pleased to announce that the project has been finished! All sanctioning\
  \ documents have been fully updated and should reflect the most recent version of\
  \ the rules. Please let me know if you encounter any issues!</p> \n      <p>Normally\
  \ this would be where I’d put GM Recognition, but this month I don’t have any new\
  \ 5-rank GMs to announce. Instead, I’ll just thank all our GMs, especially those\
  \ who have volunteered already for PaizoCon and Gen Con. You’re all fantastic and\
  \ we literally wouldn’t be able to do this without you!</p> \n      <p>Until next\
  \ time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And don’t forget to sign up for PaizoCon!</p>\
