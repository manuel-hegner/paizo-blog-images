<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p class="date">Tuesday, October 31, 2017</p>

<p itemprop = "description">Since people starting telling stories around the very first campfires, there have been heroes and villains who could shuffle off the coil of humanity in favor for something a little more wild, more primal, and more powerful. While shapechangers are nothing new in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, for the upcoming <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness"><i>Ultimate Wilderness</i></a>, we wanted to present a new take on the old trope&mdash;the shifter.</p>

<div class="blurb360"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20171031-ShiftersRush.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20171031-ShiftersRush_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>This class is one infused with primal magic. The base class serves as a guardian for druidic circles and is firmly rooted in those ancient religious traditions. While she is no spellcaster, a shifter's innate shifting magic is partly druidic mystery. The shifter learns Druidic and adheres to a philosophy similar to her druidic cousins, but her magic is very different. Like the hunter, the shifter is the master of the animal aspect, from the stealty bat to the terrifying deinonychus, but even more visible results. She uses those aspects to change her form and gain the power in more powerful ways. The most overt of these aspects is her ability to grow powerful claws. Without the need for manufactured weapons, she can defend the wilderness and her circle with ever-growing power that few can face for long. With increased experience comes increased control over her gifts. As she gains levels, she gains more aspects, as well as the ability to take her aspect's true form via akin to <i>beast shape II</i>. But unlike other shapechangers, she is not rooted in a single form. She can meld her lesser aspects and even enrich her true polymorphed forms with her lesser aspects, creating a chimeric form which can enrich her scouting and combat prowess.</p>


<p>Fully at one with the natural world, the shifter is more than a pure brawler. She also sports a defensive instinct granting her greater defenses when unfettered by armor or shields. She also gains wild empathy, track, woodland stride, and trackless step, making her as at home in the wild lands as any druid, hunter, or ranger.</p>

<p>At the highest levels, the shifter becomes a true master of forms. Her claws can tear through the most powerful enemy defenses. Her shape can be fine-tuned to confront whatever challenge she faces. She can slip into the mists and the shadows, only to return as a raging beast unrivaled by her foe's greatest nightmares. She is nature's wrath incarnate</p>

<p>While the base class is firmly tied to the world of druid circles, archetypes allow you to play shifters of a different stripe. The elemental shifter grants forms tied to the various elemental planes, the fiendflesh shifter detail those who make fiendish pacts for their power, while the oozemorph allows you to play an oozy creature who takes humanoid form as its disguise instead. Of course, just like all our Ultimate books, the new class isn't the only one getting new toys to play with. <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness"><i>Ultimate Wilderness</i></a> features a bunch of new archetypes for all the nature-themed classes and nature-infused takes on other classes. A personal favorite of mine is the green knight archetype for the cavalier. This archetype melds the Arthurian myths with high fantasy resulting in a stalwart protector of all things verdant and wild.</p>

<p>In case you haven't heard, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness"><i>Ultimate Wilderness</i></a> also features new, nature-based, core races that you can play. Two of those races&mdash;the long-time favorite and delicious ghoran, and the band new vine leshy&mdash;are plant creatures. Those of you who pay close attention to the game's creature types might be wondering how these new races can become shifters. After all, the plant creature type has immunity to polymorph effects. No worries, we have you covered, we have made some adjustments to the plant creature type when they are played as a PC race. While you may lose some of the more powerful immunities to damage types, you gain the ability to use the shifter class, and polymorph spells to their full effect. You'll find these changes in a sidebar located in Chapter 1: Wilderness Heroes of the book.</p>

<p>Altogether, the new shifter class along with a wealth of new options presented in <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness"><i>Ultimate Wilderness</i></a> will enrich your game, whether you are out in the wilderness or just have a hankering for playing some wild and different. Enjoy your walk on the wild side!</p>

We made that change to have a wholly accurate character representation, while changing her stance to be more generic.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Scanning for Intelligent Life-Forms</h1>

<p class="date">Friday, October 27, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">By now, many of you have seen the myriad of interesting and incredible creatures found within <a href = "http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em></a> (and if not, what are you waiting for?), but you might be wondering how we went population this book. After all, the galaxy is a very big place, full of all manner of beings&mdash;and that doesn't even begin to cover the infinite planes of existence.</p>

<p>Luckily, we had a few places where we could start. When we started thinking about <em>Alien Archive</em>, the Pathfinder RPG had already printed five Bestiary volumes (<a href = "http://paizo.com/products/btpy9r1y?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 6</em></a> was at the printer at the time) that we could mine for ideas. In addition, <a href = "http://paizo.com/products/btpy8qib?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Worlds"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Worlds</em></a> established a number of tentpoles regarding the Starfinder setting, albeit in the distant past. Conceivably though, some of the monsters and cultures name-dropped in that volume would still be around!</p>

<p>However, to truly capture the feel of a weird, science-fantasy universe, we also needed brand-new creatures. To that end, several of us here at Paizo absconded to a conference room and began filling up a whiteboard with ideas: general concepts (space mermaid), cool-sounding names (assembly ooze), and specific alien features (ability to break into constituent pieces). The fruits of our labor can be seen below.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MountainEel.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MountainEel_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-AkitonianLizardfolk.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-AkitonianLizardfolk_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-GravityUndead.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-GravityUndead_120.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>After all that, we needed to make some hard cuts. We knew dragons should be in the book, but we couldn't give them the space that <em>Bestiary</em> volumes give them, so we stuck with the evil chromatic dragons. We thought angels and devils should be represented, but we could only have one of each. We wanted to make sure that each creature type would be represented, and  And, of course, each of us had our own ideas for the book.</p>

<p>I argued that we needed at least one starship-sized creature. Rob McCreary noted the Azlanti Star Empire with their Aeon Guard was one of the setting's core threats and should be in the book. Owen K.C. Stephens persistently urged for the inclusion of the nuar, a nod to one of the first things he ever wrote for the world of Golarion. Amanda Hamon Kunz wanted to design a creature for the kaiju-infested planet she wrote for the core rulebook. Similarly, James Sutter was interested in fleshing out some of the races he originally wrote about in <em>Distant Worlds</em>. Some of our other coworkers who took freelance assignments for the book (Crystal Frasier and John Compton) voiced their own opinions on what it would be fun to write.</p>

<p>All this information went into several spreadsheets and we organized and re-organized it until we hit on a final list, which was sent out to writers, who returned with some terrific takes on what were sometimes very odd requests. In the end, I think we curated a fine collection of creatures that flesh out the world of Starfinder, as well as provide GMs with a wide array of foes for their players and players with some exciting new choices for races they can play!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Meet the Iconics—Zova</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday, October 26, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<p><i>Today we introduce the latest Pathfinder iconic character, courtesy of the upcoming <a href = "/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness"></i>Ultimate Wilderness<i></a>&mdash;Zova the Shifter!</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>By the time she'd come of age, Zova had long known she didn't fit in with the Clan of the Moon.</p>

<p>Although Zova's parents loved her and supported her in all ways, she was still the only daughter among four siblings, and while she got on well with her brothers, she often felt left out. As Zova grew older, her parents' Desnan teachings intrigued her, yet she felt a stronger kinship to the animals of the world than to the night sky above. In training for the hunt, Zova reveled in the act of stalking and pouncing like the animals she so empathized with, but she found herself impatient with her mother's preferred method of hunting with the bow and struggled to train her own archery skills. In time, when her friends began to flirt and pursue romantic trysts, Zova realized that while she valued and greatly enjoyed the company of those friends, she felt no drive to find such a romantic partner for herself. Increasingly she found herself restless, curious about the world beyond the Cinderlands. She'd seen illustrations and heard stories of the vast oceans, glacial wonderlands, and above all else the wonders of the deep forest, but paintings and tales could not sate her curiosity. Where the Clan of the Moon's territories in the arid west of the Cinderlands seemed to contain all the necessities of life for everyone she knew, Zova longed for the color green.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Zova's parents saw it coming, of course, well before she made clear her intention to travel the world and seek its wonders. They worried for her safety, but they also knew that of all their children, Zova's passion for life, her respect for the natural world, her keen perception, and her almost uncanny knack for getting the upper hand in a fight made her the best suited to leave the proverbial nest. Despite her awkward place in the clan, she still loved her family and adored her home, and promised to return as often as she could&mdash;and to bring stories of marvels from her adventures when she did.</p>

<div class="blurb360"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1140-Zova.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1140-Zova_360.jpeg"></a><br /><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></div>

<p>She had no real plan or timetable to follow as she left the Cinderlands, knowing only that she wished to travel west, toward the oft-glimpsed lands of vibrant green she'd long been lured by. Whenever she felt homesick, Zova found she need only look to the sky to feel at home, knowing she gazed upon the same sights her family did. The moon was always there, a welcome and soothing constant in her life. As days turned to weeks, Zova found that nature itself was a more than adequate surrogate family, and more besides. Though she had always felt alone in crowds as a child, watching everyone else interact with each other, here in the natural world she felt like she belonged. The animals of the world were as companionable as anyone as long as they were treated with respect&mdash;and certainly more diverse and interesting as a whole than the people she'd known up to that point!</p>

<p>The Storval Rise presented Zova her first significant challenge. She knew of its existence, but had never seen the massive cliffs with her own eyes. Standing atop them, the sweeping expanse of greenery below seemed to taunt her&mdash;so near, yet so far. The carefree antics of falcons as they swooped out over the cliff filled Zova not with jealousy, but with inspiration. If only she could fly, she could join them in their graceful exits from the Cinderlands! But as she watched the falcons hunt and play, she felt her own perception grow keen, like a kinship with the raptors was waking in her vision. As if using a falcon's eyes while gazing down the cliffside, Zova found that she could pick a treacherous but navigable path down the cliffs. She did not marvel at this&mdash;she accepted it with simple pride.</p>

<p>Despite her keen eyesight, Zova's descent was fraught with peril. She nearly died thrice on the climb (twice to near falls, once to a redback rattlesnake she accidently stepped upon and was only just able to calm before it bit her), but late that night, as the waxing moon rose, she finally set foot into the Ashwood. Lit by the moon, the forest's greens appeared almost black, yet Zova reveled nonetheless. Here was the world she'd dreamed of, a realm that she had to imagine back home in the scrubby Cinderland hills. For the remainder of the night and well into the next day, Zova sprinted and explored, climbed trees and delved into tangles of roots, hunted and played and delighted until she finally came to a toppled statue along the banks of a rushing river. She made camp in the shelter formed by the oversized statue's moss-draped chin, and soon collapsed into exhausted sleep.</p>

<p>When she woke, it was deep night once again. The now-full moon's light filtered through the canopy in pale beams, and while the ground was hard and the air was cool, it was the peal of an unearthly howl that had roused Zova from sleep. The howl was unlike anything she had ever heard&mdash;plainly the cry of an alpha wolf, yet carrying within it tones of malevolence and cruelty that felt far too human. Truly frightened for the first time in her life, Zova staggered to her feet and took her bow in hand, only to find campsite surrounded by a pack of the largest wolves she had ever seen.</p>

<p>For the first few moments, Zova's arrows held the strangely aggressive pack at bay, but as the fight wore on, it became apparent to the wolves that Zova was no predator of note. Her arrows missed more often than not, and those lucky few that scored hits were only glancing blows. As she fought, Zova did her best to empathize with the wolves, only to realize in horror that a stronger will than her own imposed upon them. When the wolves finally overcame all fear of her archery, Zova threw aside her useless bow and reached for her knife&mdash;only to find she had lost it at some point during the previous night's enraptured frolic through the woods. The wolves closed in, and Zova feared her journey was about to come to a sudden end.</p>

<p>Again that malignant howl scarred the night, and Zova could feel a presence approaching through the tangles. As the wolves closed their circle around her, she found herself hoping that the wolves would kill her before whatever hateful thing they obeyed arrived to finish the job. When the first wolf struck, she frantically swiped at it with her hand, a desperate attempt of self-preservation. For a few moments, she couldn't understand what had caused the wolf's yelp of pain and its sudden retreat. The other wolves had frozen as well, as if confused&mdash;a confusion that Zova felt as she looked down at her bloodstained hands... only to see that they were now bloodstained talons.</p>

<p>The will to survive rose in Zova, and with a snarl, she went on the offensive. She lunged at the next wolf, slashing across its snout with the birdlike talon that, a moment before, had been her hand. Again and again she cut and clawed, and the wolves, unsettled by her transformation, fell back. Zova became the predator, and as the last wolf fled, she held high her talons and cried out in triumph.</p>

<p>That cry was answered by the selfsame hateful howl. The master of the wolves had come. Zova whirled, raised her claws in a challenge, and froze in fear. What had emerged from the darkest part of Ashwood was neither person nor beast&mdash;nor was it strictly alive. A ghostly form, seemingly shed from moonlight itself, crouched in the air above, a towering man-wolf with orange eyes, fur that shimmered and wavered in unfelt wind, and teeth and claws of all-too-solid razor-sharp bone. Yet what the thing said was the crowning horror.</p>

<p>"Welcome, sister..."</p>

<p>Zova didn't attempt to fight. She whirled and fled, never looking back as the mad howl of the ghost wolf pursued her. She clambered onto the toppled statue, sprinted across its brow, and plunged from its crown into the churning river below. Perhaps it was the current's speed that saved her, or perhaps it was the ghost's inability to pursue, or maybe it was just luck. Whatever the cause, Zova washed ashore a mile downstream, barely alive&mdash;but alive she was.</p>

<p>Zova never returned to the Ashwood. Those to whom she's told her tale smirk in disbelief&mdash;not from claims of an encounter with a ghost wolf (for many parts of Varisia host stranger terrors than ghosts or werewolves), but that she had escaped to tell the tale at all. The legend of Loper, the ghostwolf of Ashwood, has frightened many listeners, for in most of these tales the victims are lucky just to survive. Zova never revealed to anyone the two words Loper spoke to her that night, yet she feels that in those two words lies the explanation of her escape. She vowed to some day return to Ashwood and solve this mystery&mdash;preferably in the company of a group of adventurers, for a faithful pack brings so much more to a fight than can a lone predator!</p>

<p>Until that day, Zova travels from town to town, exploring her growing power as a shifter and the confusing nature of adventuring party dynamics. Her protective nature is augmented by the compassion she feels for these all-too-often orphans, for she knows she is not the norm among her traveling companions in having a family who loves her and a home she can some day return to.</p>

<p>Yet on nights when the moon rises high and unwelcome dreams torment her sleep, Zova can't help but wonder&mdash;are those she calls her brothers really her brothers at all?</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p class="date">Thursday, October 26, 2017</p>

<p itemprop = "description">We're deep in design on the Ultimate add-on series of character decks for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game&mdash;<a href = "/products/btpy9vmz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Combat-AddOn-Deck"><em>Ultimate Combat</em></a>, <a href = "/products/btpy9vtb?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Magic-AddOn-Deck"><em>Ultimate Magic</em></a>, <a href = "/products/btpy9wmw?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue-AddOn-Deck"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>, and <a href = "/products/btpy9x03?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Equipment-AddOn-Deck"><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a>. (We broke the news on this series in <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz5?Announcing-Ultimate-AddOn-Decks">an earlier blog</a>.)</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "/products/btpy9vmz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Combat-AddOn-Deck"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6828_180.jpeg"></a>

<p>So far from final art, it's not even in the same dictionary as "final" and "art."</p></div>

<p>The idea is to supplement all the character decks we've made so far with decks of new cards. If you're playing a home game, you can just add Ultimate decks into any Adventure Path box. If you're playing in organized play, you'll be able to use a character deck&mdash;say, the <a href = "/products/btpy97if?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Wizard-Class-Deck"><em>Wizard Class Deck</em></a>&mdash;and one Ultimate deck. If you'd like to play the character that's in the Ultimate deck, you can supplement that character with the cards from one other character deck. (There will likely be some limitations on which decks you can use with each of the characters from the Ultimate decks, but we haven't settled this yet.)</p>

<p>So as we're making these decks&mdash;moving cards in and out, designing cycles, even rethinking their reasonings for existence&mdash;we keep hitting three questions. If you'd like to participate in helping us think these things out, <b>leave your suggestions in the comments</b>.</p>

<h2>Question 1: What utility cards must be in the decks?</h2>
<p>We need to give all of the existing characters the cards they need to be more awesome. For some of those characters, they need cards they don't have access to, such as Potion of Healing. A melee character who can't get a Greatsword at any tier is going to be sad about it. And even if your character deck has a Cure in it, you're unlikely to be upset about having access to a <i>second</i> Cure. So we're tracking all the cards we just can't get along without.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6821-PotionOfHealing.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6821-PotionOfHealing_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Greatsword.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Greatsword_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-RemoveCurse.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-RemoveCurse_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>Sometimes "boring" is another word for "gimme that."</p></div>

<p>And sometimes we need to help characters play in sets they weren't designed for. All those Curses in Mummy's Mask are pretty nasty, so you might want Remove Curse. A lot.</p>

<p>Where in the Ultimate series such a card goes is also relevant. <em>Ultimate Intrigue</em> doesn't need a Greatsword. <em>Ultimate Combat</em> does.</p>

<p>Just as significantly, we're looking at cards we don't need to put anywhere. We don't need to put any Blessings of the Gods in the Ultimate decks, because the other character decks have as many as they need. Low-powered cards like Dart and Leather Armor seem unlikely to make an appearance in a deck with the word Ultimate in the title.</p>

<h2>Question 2: What cards are our favorites?</h2>
<p>We want to see reappearances of many of the cool things we've created over the years, especially since Skull & Shackles. (That's the set that was mostly done when we made the first seven class decks.) Every designer on this team has a different set of these, but there are some we're quickly reaching consensus on.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-FalconCrown.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-FalconCrown_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-RiffleScrolls.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-RiffleScrolls_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-BabyTriceratops.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-BabyTriceratops_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>One of these is particularly fun at parties.</p></div>

<p>For example, Mummy's Mask was the set where we made some bizarre armors. Even people who ragged on armor on a daily basis were stopped cold by a card like Falcon Crown from <a href = "/products/btpy9nd7"><em>Secret of the Sphinx</em></a>.</p>

<p>We also love cards that let someone be something their deck wouldn't otherwise allow them to be. Riffle Scrolls, from the <a href = "/products/btpy9s2e?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Pathfinder-Tales-Character-Deck"><em>Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</em></a>, lets a player with the <a href = "/products/btpy97ib?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Fighter-Class-Deck"><em>Fighter Class Deck</em></a> hold on to spells he might play, even if that opportunity is rarer than it is for, say, Ezren.</p>

<p>And of course, it's often just about what makes a certain designer smile. For example, I find the Baby Triceratops adorable. Hey there! Who's a good little trikey-wikey? You are. YES, <em>YOU</em> ARE. So yeah, there's probably going to be a Baby Triceratops in one of these decks. You might want to prepare to bury a lot of cards.</p>

<h2>Question 3: What cards are missing?</h2>
<p>This is where we're spending a lot of our time. Usually when we make a set or a character deck, we're trying to model something specific. Write a Demon-fighting set, make a lot of things to fight Demons.</p>

<p>But left unchained, what are we going to do? Well, a lot of things. Create more stained-glass blessings for our favorite gods, for example. Japanese weapons for Hayato. New books for Enora. Maybe some new poisons in <em>Ultimate Intrigue</em>. And some just weird things like&mdash;hey, did you know there's a luchador mask in the <a href = "/products/btpy8tmc?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Equipment"><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a> book? We did.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1123-GrapplerMask.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1123-GrapplerMask_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>Por el bando rudo.</p></div>

<p>Chad noted the other day that we had exactly one pair of non-promo shoes in the entire game, the Boots of Teleportation. (I suggested the Reed Moccasin, but he wasn't buying it.) Now, why do we need more shoes? Beats me. But now that he's said it, somebody on the team is likely to demand more shoes.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of things we'd like to do with these decks. But what do you want to see? Leave comments below about what cards you'd like us to include and where. Thanks!</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">I've been loving this season from the moment we started planning it, and every batch of scenarios makes me love Season 9 of <a href = "/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> a little more. Not only are we gearing up for a series of Sovereign Court adventures leading up to the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown">War for the Crown Adventure Path</a>, working on an exciting Exchange storyline, outlining a powerful Silver Crusade arc, and using the <a href = "/pathfinderSociety/acg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a> to pursue one of the perpetrators behind <a href = "/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsrpg/scenarios/season9"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em></a>, but we're also in the early stages of locking down Pathfinder Society's Season 10. If you've seen team members cackling with barely-contained glee on social media, it's likely for these reasons and more.</p>

<p>And if you've seen us bouncing excitedly in the months leading up to now, it's probably because of the excellent scenarios we're releasing today.</p>

<div class="blurb360"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0906E-Zepha.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0906E-Zepha_120.jpeg"></a>

<p><i>Illustrations by Juzef Kucera</i></p></div>

<p>First up is the Tier 1-5 delight <a href = "/products/btpy9weq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-906-The-Shores-of-Heaven"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-06: The Shores of Heaven</em></a>, which dispatches the PCs to Heaven itself to research and perform a ritual that might purify a beloved Pathfinder colleague. This is exciting for several reasons. First, this scenario's a direct result of the reporting data participants like you provided for <a href = "/products/btpy9huy?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-17-Thralls-of-the-Shattered-God"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-17: Thralls of the Shattered God</em></a>. Second, it's another chance to adventure with the Pathfinder "venture-captain" Valais. Third, it's an adventure... in Heaven. This last point's been something of a personal challenge for me, as the common response to proposing a Heaven adventure is "There's no point; the archons would destroy any threats immediately." Linda and I have had a few days where we shouted the equivalent of "They said it couldn't be done! They said we were MAD!" Then we would cackle and go back to outlining. More accurately, Linda would go back to outlining, as she oversaw this project as its development lead.</p>

<p>Really, though, this came together as cleanly and beautifully as it did thanks to the author, Cole Kronewitter. Cole's worked on several other scenarios, and we found his character portrayals in <a href = "/products/btpy9m00?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-25-Orders-from-the-Gate"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-25: Orders from the Gate</em></a> represented exactly the kind of talent we'd need to make this scenario happen. He delivered, and this scenario with Silver Crusade ties is absolutely charming. What's more, there's a delightful section about how characters with evil auras or evil familiars function during this adventure, including one of the most explicit "Don't mess this up" warnings I think we've ever included in a scenario&mdash;including in the Bonekeep series.</p>

<p>Included here are two preview illustrations, including a powerful celestial you'll meet as well as a disfigured fiend that's played an ongoing roll in Valais's story.</p>

<p>Last month we featured <a href = "/products/btpy9weo?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-04-The-Unseen-Inclusion"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-04: The Unseen Inclusion</em></a> by Mike Kimmel, which kicked off a very fun Scarab Sages narrative in Thuvia. This month, Matt Duval has taken the baton and brought us <a href = "/products/btpy9wer?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-07-Salvation-of-the-Sages"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</em></a>, an epic Tier 7-11 showdown in which the PCs face off against an ancient enemy and hold the fate of a faction in their hands. Need another reason to be excited? How would you like the opportunity to adventure alongside all of the Jeweled Sages? Yes, all of them. Yes, that includes one who might not be on the best of terms with the Society.</p>

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0907E-AryanaTahari.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0907E-AryanaTahari_120.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Marco Horvatin</i></p></div>

<p>I recruited Matt Duval to write this in part because he has such a history with the Scarab Sages storyline, but also because he knows how to make a big and flashy event that reveals long-held secrets. The two of us had a chance to brainstorm the details at Gen Con, where we devised some terrific scenes that I feel really shed light on many of the extant sages and allow the PCs to uncover information central to the campaign and its NPCs in new ways.</p>

<p>There are a few tools and design variations that appear in this scenario that we're testing out. These won't necessarily become the norm, but Linda and I are interested in hearing whether these are easy to use, helpful, and something you might want to see more in the future. Specifically, #9-07 uses a skill DC table that has appeared in past multi-table interactive specials, which assigns an Easy, Average, and Hard DC value for each level range. This scenario also provides a few GM reference handouts that summarize who certain NPCs are and which past Chronicle sheets the players have might factor into the scenario. Although I don't plan on including these handouts in anything but very canon-heavy adventures, I would like to hear how we can make them as useful as possible for GMs.</p>

<p>This is a big scenario with big implications for the Scarab Sages, and our team reserved it as high a level tier as we could to ensure that as many faction PCs can play this&mdash;and enjoy its Chronicle sheet&mdash;as possible. I think Salvation of the Sages really drives home that Season 9 really is the Season of Factions' Favor, and we're only three months in!</p>

Of course, any good mystery needs a strong cast, and this month's scenario also introduces several new important NPCs to the campaign.</p>

<p>Fellow staffer and editor extraordinaire, Lyz Liddell, took up the challenge of writing this important scenario. She not only produced a strong story, but she also introduces us to a cast of unique characters that we will be seeing more of in future scenarios. The First Mandate begins with the PCs attending an important gala, where First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo intends to announce the future mission of the Starfinder Society in the wake of achieving a significant recovery from the events of the Scoured Stars. Radaszam "the Dealmaker" stands beside Luwazi, offering the services of his private mercenaries and the Acquisitives faction in ensuring the announcement occurs off without incident.</p>

<p>Here's a quick look at the tags that accompany this scenario:</p>

<ul><li>Faction (Acquisitives)</li>
<li>Faction (Second Seekers [Luwazi Elsebo])</li></ul>

<p>The art I'm including here showcases two of the major NPCs introduced in this adventure, but rest assured that there are several more. For veteran Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild participants out there, you'll note that The First Mandate takes a lot of cues from a well-known Pathfinder Society scenario, namely <a href = "/products/btpy8u8v?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-4-09-The-Blakros-Matrimony"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-09: The Blakros Matrimony</em></a>. As the author of that venerable scenario (wow, I'm getting old) I obviously had reservations about passing this outline on to any freelancer, but I can safely say that Lyz did a fantastic job of bringing a scenario that incorporates social influence&mdash;and some other explosive encounters&mdash;to the far future!</p>

<p>I suspect that players and GMs alike will start concocting all sorts of theories about the ongoing campaign storyline after playing this adventure. I also anticipate some "theory crafting" of the motivations for some of the new NPCs&mdash;especially our blue-skinned android displayed in this post. Along with my usual request of "please leave a review&mdash;they really do help," I also encourage our campaign participants to post their opinions in a spoiler-marked thread in the Starfinder Society boards. One of the things that the organized play team really enjoys seeing are some of the "conspiracy theories" regarding campaign storylines. I suspect this scenario will throw some gasoline onto that slowly growing fire of the Starfinder Society storylines.</p>

<p>Come back next month, when we preview our next scenario <a href = "/products/btpy9weu/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-06-A-Night-in-Nightarch"><em>Starfinder Society #1-06: A Night in Nightarch</em></a>, our first scenario at Tier 3-6, and our first look at the nefarious drow of Apostae!</p>

<p>Until then!</p>

<p itemprop="description">The second installment of the Dead Suns Adventure Path, <a href = "/products/btpy9ujm?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Temple-of-the-Twelve"><em>Temple of the Twelve</em></a>, has hit the space lanes this month, bringing us one-third of the way through Starfinder's inaugural starfaring campaign. As a result, it seemed a good time to show off some more of the art from Dead Suns and hint at some of the friends, foes, and extraterrestrials the heroes might encounter during the Adventure Path.</p>

<p>In <a href = "/products/btpy9tmf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Incident-at-Absalom-Station"><em>Starfinder Adventure Path #1: Incident at Absalom Station</em></a>, the heroes acquire their very own starship, a Sanjaval Spaceflight Systems Vagabond named the Sunrise Maiden. But the ship is far more than just a stock light transport/freighter. The Sunrise Maiden will accompany the heroes on their adventures throughout the campaign, and as the player characters advance in level, they'll be able to improve and customize their vessel to truly make it their home among the stars.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-PactCorvette.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-PactCorvette_360.jpeg"></div>

<p>Meanwhile, in <a href = "/products/btpy9ujm?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Temple-of-the-Twelve"><em>Starfinder Adventure Path #2: Temple of the Twelve</em></a>, the heroes head to the planet Castrovel, home to the lashuntas, elves, and formians, though the famed universities of Qabarat welcome scholars of other species as well. The Cult of the Devourer also makes an appearance in this volume, along with new Devourer-themed gear, spells, and the devastator mystic connection.</p>

<p>Among the creatures presented in this volume's Alien Archives are the woiokos, a humanoid species native to the planet Heicoron IV (itself detailed in <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #1</em>'s "Codex of Worlds" article). Woiokos have two subspecies, the Floatborn, who live on the ocean's surface, and the Deepborn, who embraced their ancestral aquatic heritage to live underwater, and their entry includes racial traits for woioko player characters.</p>

<p>We'll end with a taste of <a href = "/products/btpy9sxf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Splintered-Worlds"><em>Starfinder Adventure Path #3: Splintered Worlds</em></a>, available in December, which sees our heroes visiting the scattered asteroids of the Diaspora and the dead world of Eox. The native inhabitants of Eox, the elebrians, turned to undeath long ago to survive a planetary cataclysm, but a handful of living elebrians survive, making an appearance in this volume's Alien Archives, along with racial traits for elebrian player characters.</p>

<p>Stay tuned! There's plenty more to come in the Dead Suns Adventure Path, from yaruks to skreelings to four-eyed bug-weasels, not to mention frailty cannons, necrografts, and much, much more!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">That Cantina Feel</h1>
 
<p class="date">Wednesday, October 18, 2017</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">Ever since <a href = "/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Alien Archive</em></a> was announced, the organized play team has received a veritable flood of questions concerning the legality of this new book. As was <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk7b?Just-My-Luck-I-Get-Stuck-with-a-Race-that">recently revealed</a>, <em>Alien Archive</em> contains 22 new playable races for the Starfinder Roleplaying Game. So today, I want to take some time to discuss our current and future plans for getting these amazing new alien races into the Starfinder Society.</p>

<p>First off, I want everyone to know that the "cantina feel" is important to the Starfinder Society campaign. We want players to have access to a wide array of fun and unique species to create characters with. We want those characters to explore the similarly diverse universe that is Starfinder. Along with that, we also want to balance the experience for those dedicated people behind the GM screen. Most people are still getting acquainted with the Starfinder rules, so introducing 22 playable races right away can be another layer of complexity for some. So, to start, we will be introducing several of the new playable races in a way that shouldn't overwhelm GMs, while still promoting some of our core goals for the campaign.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Regional Convention Support</h2>
<p>Conventions are a major source of pride for many communities, and we've repeatedly heard from event organizers and venture-officers that access to race boons is a big draw for many people attending conventions. We'll be providing several <em>Alien Archive</em> races via conventions, but with some additional tweaks to make a wider array of races more accessible to people across the world.</p>

<p>First, over the coming weeks, we'll be creating a group of four informal "mega regions" that group together existing organized play regions; these are just ways for us to organize this distribution, not a new administrative unit with assigned leaders. Conventions in each of these larger regions will receive a GM reward Chronicle sheet that provides access to a choice of two different <em>Alien Archive</em> races, similar to how existing convention support works for the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild but with more options. Because these mega regions will have different available races, it should also provide some additional incentive to travel to different areas in search of new race boons.</p>

<p>If you're concerned about missing a desired race boon because it might be in a different region, fear not! We're aiming to regularly rotate which races are available&mdash;roughly every quarter&mdash;so that players can still have a chance to collect these boons locally, without having to travel outside their region. For example, Races A and B might start in Region 1, and Races C and D might start in Region 2. After about three months, they might swap so that Region 1 GMs would have access to Races C and D.</p>

<h2>Method 2: Player Focused Boon</h2>
<p>For those of you who are not able to attend conventions, we recognize that there needs to be other means of accessing playable races. The first method, available today, has its roots in the Regional Support Program GM incentive. Rather than focusing on GMing, this new Chronicle sheet is entirely based on games played. In the same vein as the Regional Support Program, this is a multi-tiered boon that will begin by allowing players access to a ryphorian or wrikreechee after playing in six unique scenarios with any combination of characters. For those holding onto the Chronicle sheet a bit longer, the barathu race becomes available after playing 12 unique scenarios.</p>

<p>There are some key things to note about this boon. First, it is entirely based on games played, so GMing does not count towards completion; we have the Regional Support Program and convention rewards for GMs. Second, while the boon itself requires that you "...play an adventure for which you have not previously received credit on this boon..." it does provide greater progress for playing sanctioned Adventure Path material. Along the same lines, once you apply a boon from this Chronicle sheet to a character, the Chronicle sheet is considered used, but you can immediately start filling in a new copy of this Chronicle sheet. While standard replay rules apply, you can fill in a few of the lines by partaking in repeatable content&mdash;so while you can't fill these Chronicle sheets out by continually replaying <a href = "/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario: #1-01: The Commencement</em></a>, you can still get a few extra lines filled from those repeatable adventures when you start filling in a new Chronicle sheet.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll note that this boon has a limited period of validity. This is intentional, as we hope to swap out the races on this boon to make more available to the general player base. Given this shortened period, it seems appropriate to issue an immediate ruling: previously played Starfinder Society scenarios are considered valid and can be applied to this Chronicle sheet immediately, so long as they follow the required rules listed in the Chronicle sheet. For some of you, this might mean you've already completed the Tier 2 requirements and now have access to the associated races&mdash;enjoy!</p>

<p style = "text-align: center;"><a href = "/include/PZO7105-Boon.zip"><b>Download the <em>Alien Archive</em> Player Boon</b></a> &mdash; 533kb zip/PDF</p>

<h2>Method 3: You Decide the Future</h2>
<p>Finally, I want to open up a discussion in the comments below about future methods of distributing playable races to our players. We're already hard at work planning out scenarios that could allow access to new races, as well as other potential events where we can release Chronicle sheets opening up further options. But, despite our best-laid plans here on the organized play team, I would like to get some feedback on how our players would like to see playable races added into the campaign. As we're really just finishing our "First Steps" (bad pun, sorry) feedback is important, and now is a great time to see what you, the players and GMs, think about how we can proceed.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Faith in Azlant</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday, October 17, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<p itemprop="description">Subscribers have already started thumbing through their copies of the third installment of the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant">Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path</a> as they arrived in the mail, and one of the first things I saw people talking about was the article on the gods of ancient Azlant. I'll talk a little more about that in a bit, but for now here's a look at some of the other exciting things in <a href = "/products/btpy9uk2?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-123-The-Flooded-Cathedral"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #123: The Flooded Cathedral</em></a>.</p>

<p>Up until this point in the Adventure Path, the PCs have had to deal with only a few encounter locations that are submerged, but this one takes the water wings off and drops the adventurers into the deep end in&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;a flooded cathedral. Don't get scared off yet! The entire cathedral isn't flooded, and not all of the adventure takes place in that one location. This adventure reveals some of the secrets of Azlant as the heroes explore a temple of Amaznen on an island near Ancorato. While inside they get to see some of the amazing wonders engineered by that dead god's priesthood like clockwork winding stations, seismic power generators, intelligent clockworks, and an analytical engine.</p>

<p>This volume also contains an article about clockworks, which talks about their origin and places they are more common on Golarion. It also includes a number of new augmentations for clockwork creatures to keep them fresh in your games, including ioun memory nodes, which grant clockwork creatures a measure of sentience.</p>

<p>I also got the chance to explore religion in ancient Azlant with a full pantheon of gods commonly worshiped during the height of the empire. With the utter destruction of Azlant, it's a wonder that any knowledge of these gods carried through to the current age. That many did is a testament to faith. Some of these gods are familiar faces that were worshiped slightly differently over 10,000 years ago, while others deities in the article are new and mostly unknown to the Inner Sea and current day Golarion. In this article you can learn about how Shelyn was depicted as being in mourning after her brother left for places unknown, and how Pharasmins during the height of Azlant still trusted in prophesy.</p>

<p>Some people who've already read this article have commented that the details on Nurgal don't exactly add up to what's mentioned in <a href = "/products/btpy9tok?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned"><em>Pathfinder RPG Book of the Damned</em></a>. Much of this is due to the focus of the pantheon article, where I was focusing on how things were close to the end of the Azlanti Empire. The ancient origin of Nurgal as presented in <em>Book of the Damned</em> happened long before the empire's collapse, and frankly an expansive origin story for that demon lord deserves to be in the <em>Book of the Damned</em> where it has more space than a single column in an Adventure Path.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Hello and welcome to the last set of reveals for <a href = "/products/btpy9u16?Pathfinder-Battles-Maze-of-Death"><em>Pathfinder Battles: Maze of Death</em></a>! This includes the rest of our rare figures, dungeon dressings, and the elemental lord case incentives. We'll start off with Talmandor, a rare medium figure, whom those familiar with the Pathfinder Campaign Setting will recognize. If not, this miniature is a good stand-in for any avoral agathion, or feathered player character. And if that's not quite enough for you, we have the swashbuckling Tengu Hero, also a rare medium. If you like bird men, this miniature would make a great swashbuckler, gunslinger, rogue, fighter, ranger, or thief.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20171016-Talmandor.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20171016-Talmandor_180.jpeg"></a>

<p>Looking to expand your options for spellcasting figures? <em>Maze of Death</em> includes the rare large Cyclops, rare medium Diabolical, and rare medium Elf Mystics, based off of artwork from the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance">Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9elc?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Monster-Codex"><em>Inner Sea Monster Codex</em></a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Set the scene for a creepy encounter with the Barred Door and Blood Stained Altar! Almost every adventurer, at some point in their career, needs a barred door in between them and some monster. Don’t forget, that monsters also need barred doors to keep the pesky murder hobos out of their lairs. And what credible villain wouldn't use one of these altars in their decor?</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20171016-BarredDoor.jpg"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20171016-BarredDoor_180.jpeg"></a>

<p>The next few dungeon dressing pieces are great flexible items to drop into just about any scenario. <em>Maze of Death</em> includes a Fireplace, Fountain, Knight Statue, and Portcullis. Especially good for any adventure you may be running that say, has a fountain whose waters act as a potion of healing, or take up for a rest in a local estate (that totally isn't haunted). WizKids took the extra step to make the logs in the fire removable for the Fireplace, but unfortunately, creating a Portcullis that would open and close is a bit too expensive for the price point. Suspend your disbelief, remember this is a mini, and remember that magic and extra dimension space saving spaces exist in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p>

<p>And finally, here come the big guns! I present you with the Air and Fire Elemental Lords, the case incentive figures for <em>Maze of Death</em>! These miniatures are Huge, and based off of artwork from the <a href = "/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures"><em>Mythic Adventures</em></a> hardcover.</p>

  ... Just My Luck, I Get Stuck with a Race that Speaks Only in Macros Friday, October 13, 2017  The first hardback sourcebook for Starfinder is Alien Archive, a book with scores of npcs and monsters drawn from numerous species and rules for creating brand new creatures. That obviously makes it a book GMs are going to get a lot of use out of. But there's a great deal more to it than just a bestiary of space monsters.

<h1 itemprop="headline">Just My Luck, I Get Stuck with a Race that Speaks Only in Macros</h1>

<p class="date">Friday, October 13, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">The first hardback sourcebook for Starfinder is <a href = "/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Alien Archive</em></a>, a book with scores of npcs and monsters drawn from numerous species and rules for creating brand new creatures. That obviously makes it a book GMs are going to get a lot of use out of. But there's a great deal more to it than just a bestiary of space monsters. <em>Alien Archive</em> has lots of additional material that's useful to players, from new player character races to new equipment options and even a whole set of summoning spell rules.</p>

<p>While there are stat blocks appropriate for GM use with every species, 22 of them also give the traits that allow the creation of player characters of that race. The races that receive the racial traits to allow them to be used as player characters (along with their size when it is different from Medium, and their type and subtype if any) are: barathu (aberration), contemplative (monstrous humanoid), draelik (humanoid, draelik), dragonkin (Large dragon), drow (humanoid, elf), formian (monstrous humanoid), space goblin (small humanoid, goblin), gray (small humanoid, gray), haan (Large monstrous humanoid), ikeshti (small humanoid, ikeshti), kalo (monstrous humanoid, aquatic), maraquoi (humanoid, maraquoi), nuar (monstrous humanoid), reptoid (humanoid, reptoid, shapechanger), ryphorian (humanoid, rhyphorian), sarcesian (Large humanoid, sarcesian), shobhad (Large monstrous humanoid), skittermander (Small humanoid, skittermander), urog (Large magical beast), veranthi (humanoid, veranthi), witchwyrd (monstrous humanoid), and wrikreechee (monstrous humanoid, aquatic). While some of those races are familiar to players from Pathfinder or earlier Starfinder products, others appear here for the first time.</p>

<p>As a sample of the new kinds of creatures available to players, here are the racial traits for wrikreechees, chitinous natives of the watery planet of Akchios.</p>

<div class="blurb180"><a href="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-Wrikreechee.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-Wrikreechee_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<blockquote>
<h3>Wrikreechee Racial Traits</h3>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Ability Adjustments</b>: +2 Con, +2 Int, -2 Dex</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Hit Points</b>: 4</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Size and Type</b>: Wrikreechees are Medium monstrous humanoids with the aquatic subtype.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Amphibious</b>: Wreikreechees are able to breath both water and air normally.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Cooperative (Ex)</b>: Wrikreechees spend much of their lives in close contact with one another, learning to predict their neighbors' reactions and coordinate their actions. A wrikreechee gains a +2 bonus to skill checks for the aid another action and to attack rolls to provide harrying fire. A creature using the aid another action to assist a wrikreechee's skill check gains a +2 bonus to her check.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Darkvision</b>: Wrikreechees have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Sheltering (Ex)</b>: A wrikreechee instinctively knows how to exploit sources of cover. When a wrikreechee is benefiting from partial cover, cover, or improved cover, the granted bonus to its AC and Reflex saves increases by 1. Snag (Ex): Thanks to the feathery material lining its forelimbs, a wrikreechee is adept at grabbing small prey. A wrikreechee gains a +4 bonus to attack rolls when attempting to grapple a creature smaller than itself. As a full action, a wrikreechee can make two attempts to grapple a creature with a -4 penalty to the attack rolls.</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><b>Wrikreechee Movement</b>: A wrikreechee has a base speed of 20 feet and a swim speed of 30 feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-NuarMaztech.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-NuarMaztech_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Beyond the expansion of 22 new players races, many of the creature entries also include equipment that can potentially be made from a slain monster (such as the bones cestuses that can be crafted from a crest-eater), or that is an advanced item most often found in the possession of members of a specific race (such as the grays' memory expunger) or even a whole new kind of technology (such as the nuar's multifunction maze-core technology). Each piece of new equipment is tied to a new race in some specific way, allowing players to know what kinds of gear is preferred by members of various races, or to allow them to benefit from overcoming foes that can be usefully turned into equipment that may not otherwise be available.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>Alien Archive</em> includes the summon creature variable-level spell, which is available to both mystics and technomancers. This spells allows spellcasters to select four types of planar creatures that can be summoned, ranging from angels, devils, and other outsiders to elementals, shadow creatures, or even beasts from the First World (only for mystics) or robots drawn from pieces scattered through the Astral Plane (only for technomancers). Where appropriate, specific creatures from the <em>Alien Archive</em> are available as choices to be summoned by the spell, but a series of simple templates ensures a wide range of generic outsiders can also be called upon. If a mystic wants to focus on summoning good outsiders, it's possible to have an agathion, angel, archon, and azata at every spell level the mystic can cast summon creature.</p>

<p>While not every player may wish to use equipment from distant cultures, and GMs may not make all the new potential player character races available in every campaign, the ability to have new life forms and new civilizations impact player options is an important part of the information presented in <a href = "/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Alien Archive</em></a>.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">How We (Sometimes) Name Cards</h1>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p class="date">Thursday, October 12, 2017</p>

<p itemprop = "description"><i>Sometimes we like to give you nice folks a window into the strange ways that Lone Shark and Paizo do things on the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. Here's Chad on our patently rigorous standards for naming cards.</i></p>

<p>Way back when, we set out to make an adventure card game for the glorious world of Pathfinder. Our friends at Paizo had just the right Adventure Path in mind: <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords">Rise of the Runelords</a> was being prepped for the <a href = "/products/btpy8tc0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Anniversary-Edition"><em>Anniversary Edition</em></a>. The developers had taken a fresh look at the story, the art was getting refreshed and expanded, and the publisher likes it when products lined up nicely. We&mdash;Lone Shark and Paizo both&mdash;set up a giant playtest, the results of which included "huge mounds of feedback" and "Vic learning more about various local FedEx policies and peccadilloes than any human should." Everything looked great, <i>but...</i></p>

<p>While we were busily putting together the game system, the characters, the Adventure Path, <i>and</i> the giant box and tray, that still didn't cover everything. We still needed some introductory material&mdash;something to go into the base box alongside the first adventure. And because we knew that the second adventure was going to arrive two months after the first, we thought there was a decent chance that people would play the introduction more than once. (In this, we were both right and very wrong.) We talked to Paizo to see if they had any suggestions, and eventually settled on a few varied scenarios around Sandpoint. We conscripted the dragon Black Fang from an encounter in the <a href = "/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box"><em>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</em></a>, and from the Sandpoint appendix in Rise of the Runelords, we took the alchemist Pillbug Podiker and the handsome bandit leader Jubrayl Vhiski.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-BlackFang.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-BlackFang_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-BlackFangsDungeonFront.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-BlackFangsDungeonFront_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-PillbugPodiker.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-PillbugPodiker_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ThePoisonPillFront.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ThePoisonPillFront_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>These names were obvious.</p></div>

<p>Thus armed with a cadre of ne'er's-do-well (I'm pretty sure that's the correct pluralization), we set about building some relatively simple scenarios around them. Black Fang got himself an eponymous Dungeon, Pillbug the poisoner gave us The Poison Pill, and Vhiski... Hmm.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-JubraylVhiski.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-JubraylVhiski_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>The man with no scenario name.</p></div>

<p>As it turns out, I've heard at least three versions of this next part. Most agree that it was late, at the end of a long day. We were all sitting around a table, or a couple tables. There's always at least one laptop; sometimes next to piles of rough-cut cardstock, other times next to small fortress-walls made of <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgbp?Skull-Shackles-All-Aboard-for-Adventure#29"><del>Gary's</del></a> <i>Gaby's</i> mostly-empty beverage containers. We're always tired. Someone always says "I dunno; just give it a name, and we'll figure it out later." Then someone says some version of "I got it" and types into a spreadsheet cell. Often someone looks at the spreadsheet and proclaims it perfect, done, finished, "Ship it!"&mdash;sometimes it's even the same person who entered it into the cell.</p>

<p>Now, something that you might not know, but probably could have guessed, is that both Lone Shark and Paizo always do a review pass on the material, just to make sure that everything lines up right&mdash;that the art matches the concept matches the name matches the world. Sometimes we catch things like "That is clearly not an Elf," so we change a trait. Other times, we've used a name that might be technically correct but just doesn't sound right&mdash;"Force Pike" is a perfectly reasonable Pathfinder weapon that will just <i>not sound right</i> to a huge number of people. And sometimes, the Lone Shark tendency to <del>sneak</del> <i>perfectly innocently insert</i> puns into the game runs afoul of Standards and Practices. For example...</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-HeartbreakHinsin.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-HeartbreakHinsin_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>Not the name his mom gave him.</p></div>

<p><i>Mike here, rudely interrupting Chad's soliloquy. Now, just look up there and you'll see: that is one handsome fellow. When we were thinking of dreamy chaps in old-timey naval garb for Skull & Shackles, one image came to mind: Benedict Cumberbatch in <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Horatio-Hornblower-Collectors-Edition/dp/B004G8N9VO" target = "_blank">the BBC production of </i>Horatio Hornblower<i></a>. So we wrote an art description asking for Cumberbatch in a faux–British naval uniform, just like he wore in that series. But we couldn't just name him "Benedict Cumberbatch," so we hopped over to the YouTube series How to Pronounce, which will teach you many things (but not how to correctly pronounce anything). <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxEA5UFpTGw" target = "_blank">The entry for Benedict Cumberbatch</a> pronounces his name "Bucket Crunderdunder" (among other things). So that's what we named him. Of course, Vic caught wise to us and made us change that ridiculous name to something less ridiculous, so Heartbreak Hinsin was born. There's only one problem with this story: Benedict Cumberbatch was never actually in <i>Horatio Hornblower</i>&mdash;it was Ioan Gruffudd. So we based an ally on a mispronunciation of a mistake. Par for the course round the Lone Shark offices. OK, back to Chad.</i></p>

<p>In the case of the first base scenario for Runelords, the name Mike chose was in danger of running into this particular filter.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-BrigandoomFront.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-BrigandoomFront_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>A pun like that only comes around every hundred years.</p></div>

<p>Brigandoom! It's like <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpk9JNUDr9k"><em>Brigadoon</em></a> but with brigands! How droll!</p>

<p>Thing was, "Standards and Practices" (in this case, Paizo's development staff) had noticed our "clever" name, and flagged it for review. The jig was up, we thought. We'd have to abandon our fun name and come up with something else. Given how late we were in the process, we were starting to resign ourselves to a plain, boring name, when someone else spoke up; the Chief Creative Officer and Publisher, in fact.</p>

<p>"Far be it from me to stand between a man and his pun," Erik Mona said, and cleared the flag.</p>

<p>And we love him for it to this day.</p>

<p class="date">Tuesday, October 10, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "/products/btpy9wn2?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Coven"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9485_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Eh? Is that you, girl? It's about time! I have a blasted archive to run, and I can't lollygag all day in some café waiting for a single customer! I'm Gloamont Sanderson, genealogist to kings! I don't care if I was the one who insisted on meeting here. My time is valuable!</p>

<p>And this? Your family? This is the kind of trouble I don't want walking through my front door. So thank you for that.</p>

<p>So you want to know about your mother, and unlike those cheapskate sorcerers you had the coin to cover my considerably expenses. Well, it's been six weeks and have I got bad news for you.</p>

<p>I found her.</p>

<p>But before we reach deep inside this squirming sack of ettercrap I've opened, let's take a step back. There I was, handsome shopkeep that I was, minding my little business when a healthy young woman walks in with coin in her purse and mud on her boots. That combination means one thing: Adventurer. And adventurers mean trouble. You get yourselves mixed up in drama and intrigue and five-generation curses and then you come to me to dig up the dirt on your behalf. Last adventurer I took work from wanted me to research his "friend's" grandparents, so he could travel back in time and murder some evil overlord none of us have even heard of yet!</p>

<p>That can't be healthy.</p>

<p>But all you want is to meet your mom. Gave me a sob story about never feelin' like you belong anywhere, but girl, no teenager feels like they belong anywhere. But you're persistent. I hate persistence. And so I take the job before I notice your blue eyes. Not very common among garundi. I thought to myself, maybe mom's an Ulfen lass sailing south, and your daddy couldn't fess up to a little foreign indiscretion. I'd be remiss if I didn't admit to a certain fondness for family gossip. It's what makes me so good at my job.</p>

<p>But no. No Ulfen on any passenger manifests in or out of Botosami near the time of your birth. Not many passengers at all&mdash;storms kept 'em away. Unseasonable storms. Your mother's storms.</p>

<p>Your mother is Panrael, the Thunder of the Jagged Reach. A storm hag. A nasty one, too, by all accounts. Vengeful, cunning, short-tempered, possessive. Persistent. Yeah.</p>

<p>You're a "changeling," a "virga may" if you want it a little honey to wash that vinegar down. And don't shake your head at me, because I may be irritable and arrogant but I'm never wrong. Hag blood runs in your veins; old magic from places people never walk. I don't care if you've never cast a spell in your life, when you're mama gets ahold of you, she'll tear away every trace of humanity and decency that keeps it bottled up, and you'll be like her. They're like cuckoos, leaving their eggs with some other fool bird to raise, and once you're ripe they come back to pluck you... and I, I lost that bird metaphor along the way. Apologies.</p>

<p>You understand, though, that you are in great danger, yes? And by proximity, so am I! I obtained your half-sister's folio in an auction selling all her belongings after she wandered out into the rain one night and never returned. She had also been researching Panrael; assembled extensive notes not just your mother, but hags and what they're capable of. I'm not a paranoid man, but your mother almost certainly has already called to her and transformed her, and that means now there are now two storm hags on your scent, and two storm hags who likely know I bought this folio!</p>

<p>And hags hate each other, especially mama and daughter! If there's two of them, that means they want three to make a coven. A coven means power, and power is the only thing hags love more than they hate. With a little training they can tap that bond for more magic, meaner spells, perform rituals to make spies or jinxes or curse a family for five generations! <i>My family line is impeccable and does not need a curse, thank you quite plainly!</i></p>

<p>Your best bet is to do like me and find yourself a witch. I know, wizards seem educated and sorcerers seem powerful and you'd think a cleric would be ideal for repelling ancient evil, but hags don't give one whit about mortal gods. They worship power, and hags and witches draw from the same primeval font. Hell, some witches get their power by way of a hag, but you don't want to go to one of those. A witch can outwit a hag, because they're at least a little bit hag themselves.</p>

<p>Yes, even boy witches. Do you want to nitpick or do you want advice?</p>

<p>Kids these days.</p>

<p>Find yourself a nice vellemancer, they're wish-granters. Not as buff as an efreeti, but also a lot less likely to enslave you for a thousand mortal lifetimes. That doesn't work, look up an arakineticist&mdash;they throw curse magic around like hags do, and some of 'em can even turn that kind of magic back on a source. There are witch-hunters, too, like hexbreakers and malice binders, but I don't know how they'd take to a half-hag girl knocking at their door. If you're particularly vindictive, track down a hag-riven; they're changelings like you, but they escaped their mothers before they could be turned all hag. They're mean, and bloodthirsty, and want someone to take out all that misplaced aggression on. Great buncha ladies.</p>

<p>Now get out, and stay away from the woods. And the coast! Take the folio, too; I'm not giving your family any other reason to come looking for me! You're the third changeling I've worked up a genealogy for, and it never ends well. No one should see the inside of a stewpot more than once in a lifetime.</p>

<p itemprop="description">With the release of <a href = "/products/btpy9u16?Pathfinder-Battles-Maze-of-Death"><em>Maze of Death</em></a> nigh, this week, we are revealing the remaining common and uncommon sculpts for the set. So buckle up!</p>

<p>First, we have the Werebear, a common medium. I have been wanting to make this miniature for quite some time. So I am very excited for this to finally happen! The miniature is based off of the <em>Bestiary</em> art for this creature. A reminder to always be nice to random woodsman NPCs...</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-WereBear.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-WereBear_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Next is the Wood Golem a common medium. My favorite part of this guy is the cut pieces with the internal grain of the wood. Very cool.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-WoodGolem.jpg"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-WoodGolem_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Then we have the Urdefhan Warrior an uncommon medium. Disturbing, as all Urdefhans are. I think Wizkids did a great job in communicating the semi translucence of his skin. Also, who doesn't love a ghoul esq tongue. This miniature is based off of art from the Inner Sea Monster Codex.</p>


<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-UrdefhanWarrior.jpg"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-UrdefhanWarrior_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>We also have the Urdefhan Necromancer another uncommon medium. I really like the small detailing on her outfit. Nothing says necromancer like skulls. Lots of skulls. This miniature is also based off of art from the <a href = "/products/btpy9elc?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Monster-Codex"><em>Inner Sea Monster Codex</em></a>.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-UrdefhanNecromancer.jpg"><img src= "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-UrdefhanNecromancer_180.jpeg"></a></div>


<p>Here we have the Blight Druid an Uncommon Medium figure based off of art from the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a>. Don't let her name keep you from using her for your good aligned druid, ranger, or hunter player character. The wooden armor came out great on this figure.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-BlightDruid.jpg"><img src= "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-BlightDruid_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Next we have the Gate Hellknight an uncommon medium figure based off of one of my favorite prestige classes in Pathfinder, the Hellknight Signifier. Tapping on their face covering and yelling "hello?! Hello!!" is not advised.</p>


<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-GateHellknight.jpg"><img src= "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-GateHellknight_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Finally, the Ghul an uncommon medium figure and malignant spirit. This guy has it all. Cloven hooves. A missing lower jaw, and malevolently eerie glow where his happiness should be.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-Ghul.jpg"><img src= "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-Ghul_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Build Your Own Aliens</h1>

<p class="date">Friday, October 6, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">There's a chill in the atmosphere, a hint of pumpkin spice in the air recyclers, and fallen leaves are littering the floor of the hydroponics bay. Yes, October is here, and so is the <a href = "/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em></a>! Over the next few weeks, we'll be previewing some of what can be found in this newest offering for the Starfinder RPG, starting with some goodies for Game Masters!</p>

<p>The <em>Alien Archive</em> is chock full of strange alien creatures and fearsome extrasolar monsters to populate your Starfinder games, but when your players discover an uncharted world deep in the Vast, you'll want to create your weird own native life-forms to inhabit it. Fortunately, the <em>Alien Archive</em> has you covered!</p>

<p>First off, in Starfinder, all nonplayer characters (NPCs as well as monsters) are built using different rules from those used to create player characters. Since most monsters are needed for just one encounter, this system allows GMs to quickly and easily create NPCs and monsters without having to go through the entire process of building a player character. So how does it work?</p>


<p>The central components of monster creation in Starfinder are arrays and grafts. Every monster derives the majority of its statistics from one of three arrays, which define the monster's primary role: combatant, expert, or spellcaster. Unsurprisingly, combatants are those who excel in combat, experts are more skill-focused, and spellcasters primarily use spells or other magic. The numbers from a monster's array are not set in stone, but they give you a baseline that can be modified by grafts, special abilities, or your own preferences.</p>

<p>After you've chosen an array for your monster, you add grafts to it, which adjust the monster's various stats and add additional abilities. There are grafts for creature types and subtypes, as well as a graft for each character class. Generally speaking, an NPC or monster will only use a creature type graft or a class graft, not both, depending on the monster's focus. Template grafts are another option that transform a creature in some way. For example, you might create a new alien using the combatant array and the monstrous humanoid creature type graft, then turn it into a shambling, technological undead horror by adding the cybernetic zombie template graft.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MonsterCreation1.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MonsterCreation1_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MonsterCreation2.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MonsterCreation2_360.jpeg"></a>
</div>

<p>Once you have these basics in place, you can start giving your monster special abilities. The monster's array and its CR determine how many special abilities it has. If a monster has a class graft, that class determines most, if not all, of its special abilities, but for non-classed monsters, you can add your own abilities or choose abilities from the list of Universal Creature Rules&mdash;those special abilities that appear in the stat blocks of the various creatures in the <i>Alien Archive</i>.</p>

<p>By this point, you're mostly done. Choose your monster's skills and determine a few other statistics like initiative, speed, and languages. If your monster has spells, you'll need to determine which spells it can cast, and you might need to outfit your monster with some armor, weapons, and other gear, but you should have all the statistics you need to use the monster in play.</p>

<p>In addition to dozens of fully detailed creatures, <a href = "/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive </em></a>provides GMs with tons of options to build and customize NPCs and monsters for Starfinder. Check out the full rules and keep your eyes on the blog for more <em>Alien Archive</em> previews!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Not Half Bad Indeed: Hell's Vengeance Makes Its PACG Debut</h1>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p class="date">Thursday, October 5, 2017</p>

<p itemprop = "description">Finally! I get to tell you about the most fun I've had designing the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. It's time to talk about the <i><a href = "/products/btpy9s2o">Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</a></i>, the first half of the two-part evil block in the PACG line.</p>

<p>When we first thought of adapting the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance">Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a>, we knew we couldn't resist some of our darker impulses. These guys work well in groups, but not in a way that benefits everyone equally. Playing them takes some selfishness.</p>

<p>The first trio of these rotters is the more martial half of the team; we saved the sneakier folks for the <a href = "/products/btpy9sjy">next deck</a>. First up, the interrogator extraordinaire, Linxia the Hellknight.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LinxiaTokenFront.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LinxiaTokenFront_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LinxiaCharacterFront.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LinxiaCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LinxiaRoleKnightOfTheRack.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LinxiaRoleKnightOfTheRack_360.jpeg"></a>
<p>So many spikes!</p></div>

<p>I don't think we've made a character more lawful than Linxia. She demands order, and not the for-the-good-of-all kind. Take a look at that last power on Knight of the Rack. It sounds good, right? A character can banish a boon to add a turn to the scenario&mdash;but wait, it's a boon of the character's favored card type. The stuff you like. Linxia is going to be saying "You don't <i>really</i> need that" a lot, and you will find yourself agreeing with her.</p>

<p>And that second checkbox on the Knight of the Rack's second power! It's <i>totally</i> like healing. When James Ernest and I went to a Vegas time-share presentation, we had a sleazy agent who said things like "It's like taking money from this pocket and putting it into that pocket! Except this pocket is in <i>my</i> pants." Linxia's like that. She's the first character I can remember who heals you for your own <i>bad</i>.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-UrgrazTokenFront.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-UrgrazTokenFront_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-UrgrazCharacterFront.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-UrgrazCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-UrgrazRoleTyrant.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-UrgrazRoleTyrant_360.jpeg"></a>
<p>I think he sharpens his beard.</p></div>

<p>The Antipaladin Urgraz has a phrase we've used exactly once on a character before: "increase the damage." When we gave it to the <a href = "/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn! Class Deck</em></a>'s Zibini, we didn't expect our playtesters to take it. They took it. A lot. But that was on a checkboxed power on a role. This is on the main power on the character card. Along with a handy ability to discard cards from other players' decks.</p>

<p>Then when Urgraz gets into his roles, it gets even more colorful. You can redirect that damage you'd suffer from failing a check to someone else. You can take cards other people bury and put them in your hand. Now, of course, you should really give those back afterward.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LazzeroTokenFront.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LazzeroTokenFront_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LazzeroCharacterFront.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LazzeroCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LazzeroRoleAsmodeanAdvocate.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LazzeroRoleAsmodeanAdvocate_360.jpeg"></a>
<p>At least the hat is nice.</p></div>

<p>The Cleric Lazzero has his own painful sort of healing. And he does some magnificent things with blessings of a particular evil type. Good news: Quite a few of the blessings in here are Corrupted. But the even better news is that power which says "You may ignore the Corrupted trait on a blessing you play on your (□ or any) check." That sounds great, right?</p>

<p>Hey, let's just check the rules on that. The Golden Rule says "If a card tells you to ignore something, the thing you're ignoring never has any effect <i>on you</i>." Those last two words are really important. Because Lazzero's happy to give you that d12 on whatever you're doing. But you sadly don't have his ability to ignore the Corrupted trait. And so this stuff happens.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-BlessingOfMephistopheles.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-BlessingOfMephistopheles_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-CircleOfEvil.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-CircleOfEvil_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-Jheraal.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-Jheraal_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>Does Mephistopheles really "bless" people?</p></div>

<p>That doesn't sound so fun if you're the beneficiary of Lazzero's largesse, but to Lazzero it sounds great! All the major devils get new Corrupted blessings. Some of them do great things at a price. If you're Urgraz, it might be a price <i>other</i> people pay.</p>

<p>The spells in this deck do some things we haven't had spells do before; that theme is followed through in a big way in the next deck. The allies have a nice evil feel too: some imps and devils, a few hellknights, and even a Redeemer Blacksmith to temper what I'm about to show you.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-Bloodblade.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-Bloodblade_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-DevilArmor.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-DevilArmor_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-TheAsmodeanDisciplines.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-TheAsmodeanDisciplines_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>I feel dirty already.</p></div>

<p>Here's my favorite thing about this deck: It comes with its own redemption card, similar to the one in the <a href = "/products/btpy9a46"><em>Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</em></a>. If you have it, you can redeem the boons when you play Wrath, or via methods such as banishing that Asmodean Disciplines. (You can even banish that book to redeem itself.)</p>

<p>And oh, the things you get to do. Banish allies you encounter to heal yourself. Grab monsters and turn them into fireballs. Deal damage to other characters to reduce damage dealt to you. All the things an evil person would want to do, and feel good doing it.</p>

<p>Sound like fun? Trust me, it is. And wait till you see Deck 2!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Science, Huh? Ain't It a Thing</h1>
 
<p class="date">Wednesday, October 4, 2017</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">With any new game system, and associated organized play campaign, there are rules questions that even the designers and developers could not predict. I was surprised to find out that batteries are one of the more discussed issues in <a href = "/starfindersociety">Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. There have been several discussions, both on the forums and among the venture-officers, about how to handle some of questions that came up with regards to handling batteries in Starfinder.</p>

<p>So, let's start with some new rulings!</p>

<h2>New Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Rulings</h2>

<p><i>The following rulings are official for the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and go into effect immediately.</i></p>

<ul>
<li>Any equipment a PC owns that comes with a battery is automatically recharged to its full number of charges between scenarios. The same applies to any individually purchased batteries a PC owns. It is assumed that PCs have access to free recharging stations within the Lorespire Complex or from their starship.</li>
<li>Starfinder Society starships, unless otherwise noted, can recharge batteries. If a scenario involves a starship, and the PCs have access to the ship, they can use the recharge station onboard at no cost.</li>
<li>The current number of charges on a battery does not impact the sale price of an item. Any items that are sold with a battery (such as energy weapons) must be resold with the associated battery, regardless of the battery's current charge.</li>
<li>Update the Pulsecaster Rifle (<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> 176) statistics as follows: Capacity 20 charges, Usage 1.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Character Updates:</b> If you previously purchased recharging services on your character between scenarios, you can reclaim any credits spent on these services. If you purchased a pulsecaster rifle for a character, prior to the publication of this blog post, you must use the new statistics, as presented above, or immediately exchange the weapon back at full credit value (instead of the standard 10% resale cost).</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>After reading various forum comments, receiving private messages, attending conventions where I discussed this matter with players, and hearing from our venture-officers, the Organized Play team decided the above rulings worked best with our campaign. Tracking charges on batteries (beyond just weapons) between scenarios was cumbersome on players, and it just added another layer of complexity to GMing a scenario. There were some rightful fears that PCs might spend more time using the <i>transfer charge</i> cantrip to completely drain obtained equipment, to bypass having to purchase replacement charges&mdash;let alone the final impact on how equipment sharing would work with that cantrip.</p>

<p>As currently written in the <a href = "/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, the pulsecaster rifle comes with a battery that's more expensive than the actual weapon purchase. The update above is in line with an upcoming FAQ/Errata from the Starfinder team that will address this issue. This future FAQ update should also include some other rules clarifications and updates, so keep an eye out for a future Starfinder FAQ</p>

<p>I suspect that these rules should alleviate most concerns with regards to tracking battery charges for a character. Players are still expected to track charges during a scenario, but I suspect that most PCs relying on energy weapons will pick up a secondary battery and have ample charges to get through even the most grueling encounters.</p>

<p>Now, go forth, and pew pew pew with all the lasers!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">The Changing Lore Warden</h1>

<p class="date">Wednesday, October 4, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">The <a href = "/pathfindersociety/rpg/additional">Additional Resources </a>for <a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Adventurer's Guide</em></a> notes that any material that changed when it appeared in this book (and underwent several additional rounds of development) would be the default version once the book's contents appear on the <a href = "/prd">Pathfinder Reference Document</a>. Until then, we've let both versions remain legal, for we're not going to institute a change that requires someone to buy another book to use a previously legal character. When we made that Additional Resources update, we expected the PRD would appear soon afterward. It's looking like it will be a while yet before it shows up, and consternation about one of the archetypes in particular&mdash;the lore warden&mdash;has been building enough that we're resolving it today.</p>

<p><b>Officially Updated:</b> The <a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><em>Adventurer's Guide</em></a> version of the lore warden becomes the sole version used in Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild on <b>October 18, 2017</b>. Aim to update your characters using the allowances below before the next time you play a character with fighter (lore warden) levels. This change doesn't become binding for two weeks, which allows you some time to make adjustments and doesn't require you to perform any modifications before your imminent game or convention.</p>

<p><b>Full Rebuild:</b> If your character had one or more levels of lore warden on or <b>before August 11th, 2017</b>, you can freely rebuild your character as you like. That includes changing up basically anything about the character except the Chronicle sheets you've assigned to them.</p>

<p><b>Partial Rebuild:</b> If your character took their first level of fighter (lore warden) or otherwise retrained into the lore warden archetype <b>after August 11, 2017 but before October 4, 2017</b>, you can freely rebuild these recently-acquired fighter (lore warden) levels and any other levels taken since; this includes any other character choices you've made since then, such as feats, spells known, recent purchases, and the like. If you adopted the archetype after this date through retraining, you may freely retrain the archetype&mdash;removing it entirely or replacing it with one or more other fighter archetypes.</p>

<p><b>Resources:</b> Both the <a href = "/products/btpy8mfq?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Pathfinder-Society-Field-Guide%20"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Pathfinder Society Field Guild</i></a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><i>Adventurer's Guide</i></a> are legal sources for the lore warden. If you own the former, simply use the updated text from the <a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><i>Adventurer's Guide</i></a>, reprinted below.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>Lore Warden (Fighter Archetype)</h3>

<p>Quick wits and deceptive techniques can often succeed where brute force might not. A lore warden is the consummate warrior-scholar of the Pathfinder Society, outsmarting her competition even when locking blades with powerful foes. Outside of combat, a lore warden's extensive education also helps her document the past and survive great danger.</p>

<p><b>Scholastic (Ex):</b> A lore warden gains 2 additional skill ranks each level. These ranks must be spent on Intelligence- based skills. All Craft and Knowledge skills are class skills for lore wardens, as are Linguistics and Spellcraft.</p>

<p>This ability replaces the fighter's proficiency with medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.</p>

<p><b>Skill Over Strength (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a lore warden qualifies for feats and other abilities as though she had the Combat Expertise feat. At 6th level, she gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, even if she would not normally qualify for the feat. If she already has Combat Expertise, she instead gains any one combat feat that includes Combat Expertise as a prerequisite (and for which she otherwise qualifies). At 10th level, she can treat her base attack bonus as though it were 2 higher for the purpose of calculating the effects of Combat Expertise.</p>

<p>This ability replaces bravery and the fighter bonus feat gained at 2nd level.</p>

<p><b>Swords Secret (Ex):</b> A lore warden learns specialized techniques that help her to quickly analyze and defeat her foes. At 3rd level, a lore warden gains one swords secret, and she gains an additional swords secret for every 4 fighter levels gained after 3rd. Except where noted, a lore warden cannot select the same swords secret more than once.</p>

<p><i>Exploit Weakness (Ex):</i> The lore warden adds one-third her class level on attack rolls to confirm critical hits. At 11th level, whenever she confirms a critical hit, her weapon attacks ignore the first 5 points of damage reduction or hardness the target has until the end of her next turn. At 19th level, the lore warden can automatically confirm a critical hit once per round when she threatens a critical hit.</p>

<p><i>Hair's Breadth (Ex):</i> Once per day when subject to a critical hit, the lore warden can attempt an Acrobatics check to reduce the damage as an immediate action. If the result of this Acrobatics check is greater than the opponent's confirmation roll, she negates the critical hit; the attack still hits and deals normal damage. The lore warden must be at least 11th level to select this swords secret. At 15th level she can use this secret one additional time per day.</p>

<p><i>Know Thy Enemy (Ex):</i> When the lore warden succeeds at a Knowledge check to identify a creature's abilities and weaknesses, she can also use a standard action to grant herself a +2 insight bonus on all attack and weapon damage rolls made against that enemy. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to half her class level (minimum 2 rounds), or until the lore warden uses this ability against a different creature. At 11th level, she also gains a +2 bonus to her AC against the creature when using this ability. At 19th level, the insight bonus increases to +3.</p>

<p><i>Maneuver Training (Ex):</i> The lore warden gains a brawler's maneuver training class feature, treating her fighter level as her brawler level.</p>

<p><i>Swift Assessment (Ex):</i> The lore warden can now use her know thy enemy swords secret as a move action. At 15th level, she can use this ability as a swift action. She must have the know thy enemy swords secret before choosing this swords secret.</p>

<p>This replaces armor training and armor mastery.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The <b>enlightened bloodrager</b> and <b>Qadiran horselord</b> archetypes are receiving the same treatment with two exceptions: we're not reprinting the updated archetype text here (it will still await the PRD update), and the date by which any updates need to happen will be based on when the PRD's updated. The cut-off dates for partial and full rebuilds will be the same, however, as will the legality of the respective previous sources for these archetypes. If you would like to perform those rebuilds for characters with those archetypes now, you're welcome to do so.</p>

<p>In <a href = "/products/btpy9uk0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-122-Into-the-Shattered-Continent"><em>Into the Shattered Continent</em></a> the PCs continue to explore their new island home after dealing with some of the issues in the previous adventure. This adventure takes the PCs across the island of Ancorato and to one of the neighboring islands as the heroes makes sure that there aren't any more threats to the new colony.</p>

<p>Of course there are more threats, but the PCs also meet some friendly inhabitants that can help make their stay on the island much more pleasant. The adventurers come across these people as they explore the island and find relics of a lost empire, specifically some of the items they used, such as an <i>ioun gauntlet</i>, or places they inhabited, such as a ruined observatory.</p>

<p><i>Illustrations by Valeria Lutfullina</i></p></div>

<p>During the course of the PCs' survey of the island, they are asked to check out a few particular locations&mdash;spots that a certain early pathfinder who penned volume 1 of the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles</em> might have visited. If they make it through all of that, the PCs can tackle the end of this adventure in a blaze of glory!</p>

<p><i>Illustration by Sandra Posada</i></p></div>

<p>In addition to the adventure, this volume of the Pathfinder Adventure Path also includes an 8-page article about the region where this campaign takes place, including some other points of interest that a GM could incorporate into this campaign. There's also a look at seven magic items and artifacts left over from broken Azlant that a GM could seed into the adventure for PCs to find.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes on this blog in a week or so when I give some teasers about what's in <a href = "/products/btpy9uk2?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-123-The-Flooded-Cathedral"><i>The Flooded Cathedral</i></a> and go into some more detail about the gods of ancient Azlant!</p>

<p itemprop="description">Hello and welcome to this week's <a href = "/products/btpy9u16?Pathfinder-Battles-Maze-of-Death"><em>Pathfinder Battles: Maze of Death</em></a> preview! This week we are looking at scaly horrors from the swamps, bogs, and other dark and scary places. To start this week, we have the Lizardfolk Warrior, a common medium. This miniature is based off of the art from the <a href = "/products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>, and I think Wizkids did a great job changing the pose and keeping it looking awesome.</p>


<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-LizardfolkWarrior.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-LizardfolkWarrior_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Next we have the Lizardfolk Mireborn, an uncommon medium. This one is based off of art from <a href = "/products/btpy9jbf?Pathfinder-Module-Ire-of-the-Storm"><em>Pathfinder Module: Ire of the Storm</em></a> and helps highlight the variety of appearance in both coloration and stance that all of our creatures in Pathfinder possess. As an alternate sculpt to the Warrior, I think this one fits the bill.</p>


<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-Lizardfolk.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK73037-Lizardfolk_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Finally, we have the Deep Lurker, an uncommon large. This beauty is based off of art from the <a href = "/products/btpy8l3e?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-46-Wake-of-the-Watcher"><em>Wake of the Watcher</em></a> the fourth volume in the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown">Carrion Crown Adventure Path</a>. You may recognize this creature by other names, such as Lobster Monster, Chuul, or Old Man of the Sea (probably not that one, as I just made it up). I love the sea life that has taken up residence on its carapace.</p>
