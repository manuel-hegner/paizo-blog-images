  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">With the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> comes a bevy of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpm?A-Galaxy-Of-Character-Options\"\
  >player options</a>, but there’s plenty more value packed into this tome. While\
  \ you’ll want to keep an eye out for an upcoming blog that details the world-building\
  \ system, today we’re looking at the multitude of toolboxes and tables provided\
  \ in the Galaxy Exploration Manual!</p> \n     <p>While some of these tools will\
  \ be useful to players building their characters’ backstories, GMs will find them\
  \ invaluable in running open-ended adventures. So, let’s put ourselves in a Starfinder\
  \ GM’s shoes and see what we can get out of GEM</p> \n     <p>Let’s suppose our\
  \ party has used the exploration system in the book’s first chapter to identify\
  \ a new system and decides to travel through the Drift to find it. Our first stop\
  \ as GM can be the <b>Drift Encounters Toolbox</b>, where we have a d% table with\
  \ 50 options for encounters in the Drift, ranging between combat and exploration.\
  \ We roll a 42 and get “A time dragon travels the Drift, ensuring any temporal differences\
  \ of active planar bubbles are not being abused.” Depending on our party’s makeup,\
  \ their actions, and their goals, this usually neutral dragon might be a help, a\
  \ hindrance, the quest giver of a new side quest—or merely another interesting but\
  \ brief sighting on a journey through the Drift.</p> \n     <p>Our players might\
  \ also encounter another ship in the Drift, so let’s turn to the <b>Starship Toolbox</b>\
  \ and roll up a random name and a quirk! We roll 42 for the first word of the ship\
  \ name (Infinite) and a 42 for the second word (Hope), as well as a 13 for the starship\
  \ quirks table, which tells us that “the ship is a replica of a fictional ship from\
  \ a popular holovid.” Again, we can make as much or as little of this as we and\
  \ our party is interested in. We could instead roll on the legendary starships table\
  \ to have a brush with a famous (or infamous) starship from the Starfinder setting.</p>\

  \ Victor Manuel Leza Moreno</p>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>Our next stop\
  \ is a new world the party is exploring! Again, a future blog will cover the world-building\
  \ system, which includes fleshing out a world’s physical and cultural characteristics\
  \ and it inhabitants, but for now, let’s use the <b>Settlement Toolbox</b> to inspire\
  \ us for the first settlement our PCs visit! Rolling on the settlement quirks table,\
  \ we get 42: Many inhabitants claim to be descended from a lost line of an important\
  \ family that originates from this world or another. We then roll 42 on the settlement\
  \ challenges table and learn that the settlement’s inhabitants enjoy a form of entertainment\
  \ that surreptitiously carries a supernatural form of illness. We also have a table\
  \ of locations for when the PCs want to wander around, do some investigating (or\
  \ window shopping). Rolling 42, we get the local transport dealer, where people\
  \ can purchase or repair ground-based transportation (the details of which will\
  \ vary wildly depending on our world’s tech level, biomes, and so forth).</p> \n\
  \     <p>Of course, there are people populating this settlement, and our PCs are\
  \ bound to want to harangue—I mean, meet—some of them, so let’s turn to the <b>NPC\
  \ Toolbox</b> and see who their first victim—I mean, new friend—is! Perhaps they’\
  re the transport dealer we just met. We roll twice on the name and species table\
  \ (two 42s) and get Lajai, an ikeshti. Of course, to bring the character alive,\
  \ we’ll want a personality quirk, so let’s roll on that d% table. We get a 42, so\
  \ now we know that Lajai hates their day job and dreams of becoming a vid star.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Finally, we’d be remiss to overlook the <b>Treasure Toolbox</b>, full\
  \ of story-rich treasure that can be far more interesting than another credstick\
  \ or hunk of starmetal. Perhaps Lajai knows of one of these treasures and offers\
  \ to split the profits if the PCs can recover it (finally allowing Lajai to pursue\
  \ their vid-star dreams!) We roll 13 on the table for treasures worth 5,000 credits\
  \ (there are tables for multiple values) and get a computerized music box that algorithmically\
  \ generates new songs based on what other music it has overheard. </p> \n     <p>Of\
  \ course, if we want to reroll any of these results, or even just handpick them,\
  \ we’re free to (and we might want to get our d% dice checked out, anyway…). These\
  \ toolboxes provide inspiration for countless adventures throughout the galaxy!\
  \ </p> \n     <p>We’ll see you next time, when we build a world from scratch with\
  \ just a few rolls.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
