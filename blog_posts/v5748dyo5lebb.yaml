  \     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">We're less than a month from the formal\
  \ release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a> set of Pathfinder\
  \ Battles prepainted miniatures! Here in the Paizo offices, things are very, very\
  \ quiet, as it seems just about everyone but me remembered to take the day off to\
  \ have a continuous holiday between Christmas and New Year's Day. Well, my mistake\
  \ is your reward, as all this silence in the office during the \"Winter Break\"\
  \ has given me more than enough time to whip up a brand new Pathfinder Battles Preview\
  \ Blog!</span></p> \n     <p>And since it's been a while since I've been able to\
  \ hit my regularly scheduled deadlines for these mini reveals (and since we're running\
  \ out of time before you'll have the figures in your hands yourselves), I want to\
  \ make today's reveal a doozy.</p> \n     <p>Four figures this week, five if you\
  \ include the latest repaint reveal for Goblinworks' Pathfinder Online Kickstarter\
  \ Campaign, but more on that later.</p> \n     <p>First up this week, we've got\
  \ a couple of dogs. Not dogs in terms of bad miniatures, of course, but dogs in\
  \ terms of canine critters for your Pathfinder RPG enjoyment. Now, I've been collecting\
  \ prepainted plastic miniatures for years, and if there's one thing I feel like\
  \ I've got a lot of, it's dogs and wolves and various canines of all types and sizes.\
  \ I don't really <i>need</i> more dogs, so if we wanted to include them (for whatever\
  \ reason) in Pathfinder Battles, I knew they needed to be really, really special.\
  \ I think these two figures ably fit the bill.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121228-ShadowHound_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>First up we have the Shadow Hound, a nasty evil\
  \ outsider who appears in <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"><i>Bestiary 3</i></a> under\
  \ a slightly more specific name. I'm not sure if the photo does full justice to\
  \ this guy. He's got a base coat of black with some gray highlights that really\
  \ pull out a lot of details for such a dark miniature. Gray fingernails and bright\
  \ red eyes sell the ferociousness of this clever canine, and at the common rarity\
  \ you'll easily be able to assemble a pack of them to threaten your player characters.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121228-HellHound.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121228-HellHound_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Speaking of hounds, what RPG campaign would be complete\
  \ without a pack of fire-breathing flame dogs from the pits of Hell? Our Hell Hound\
  \ (also at the common rarity) is a truly remarkable figure, sculpted in clear plastic\
  \ and painted in tones of red, orange, and yellow that combine with the clear to\
  \ give a true burning appearance. I absolutely love this sculpt, which is a requirement\
  \ when dealing with a figure many players already have in one form or the other.\
  \ At almost as large (or maybe even a bit larger) than a human, this is one unforgettable\
  \ puppy.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121228-RavenousOoze.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121228-RavenousOoze_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>From the unforgettable to the never-made-before\
  \ in prepainted miniature form, we turn to the Ravenous Ooze, an uncommon slimy\
  \ gray pseudopod eager to digest your metal bits (including most of your treasure).\
  \ I love throwing oozes at my players, but the game has relatively few appropriate\
  \ for lower-level charcters. At CR 4, the Ravenous Ooze is perfect to teach PCs\
  \ respect at a relatively young age. Players have been asking for this miniature\
  \ since we announced the launch of Pathfinder Battles, and I am thrilled to finally\
  \ deliver.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121228-PallidPathCultist.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121228-PallidPathCultist_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>I may be mistaken, but I believe this\
  \ skulking murderer has likewise never been produced in prepainted plastic. We call\
  \ him the Pallid Path Cultist, and he and his brethren play an important role in\
  \ the opening chapters of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>. The grayish clear plastic of the Pallid Path\
  \ Cultist perfectly suggests his chameleon skin ability, which allows him to blend\
  \ easily into his surroundings. WizKids did a terrific job capturing the dynamic\
  \ pose we first presented in <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"><i>Bestiary 2</i></a>,\
  \ and again miniatures collectors who have been looking for a guy like this for\
  \ years have much reason to rejoice.</p> \n     <p>Lastly, I'd like to remind everyone\
  \ that we've got a fun Pathfinder Battles miniatures component for the Pathfinder\
  \ Online Kickstarter Campaign from our friends over at GoblinWorks, who are raising\
  \ money for their upcoming Pathfinder-inspired MMO. Crowdforger backers will receive\
  \ several special repaint figures as thanks for their support, including the Bloodbriar\
  \ Goblin Raider, Lava Lurker, Shadowfire Elemental, and Mudlord! And since the campaign\
  \ just passed $500,000, we've revealed the next figure to be unlocked, the Moon\
  \ Spider!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121228-MoonSpider.jpg\"\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online Kickstarter Campaign</a> project page and\
  \ consider joining up! If the campaign hits its ambitious $1 Million goal, you'll\
  \ receive NINE figures (and a whole bunch of other awesome stuff), and if they manage\
  \ to exceed that goal, there are even cooler Pathfinder Battles rewards in store!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And that's it for this week. I wish you all a fantastic new year filled\
  \ with gaming and miniature delights. Next week we'll show off even more amazing\
  \ figures from the Shattered Star set, and a few weeks after that, you'll have them\
  \ in your own hands!</p> \n     <p>(And then we'll start previewing images from\
  \ the NEXT set, which looks INCREDIBLE!)</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
