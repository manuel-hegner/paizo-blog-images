  \  <p><span itemprop=\"description\">My first RPG game was a high-level adventure,\
  \ and had something to do with queens, demons, webs, and pits. We didn't last long,\
  \ but I was hooked on the concept. Over the years, I graduated from aimless power\
  \ gamer to aspiring storyteller. I've been blessed with great friends and great\
  \ campaigns. Though I cherish my faith and family more than anything, I have been\
  \ a gamer longer than any other attribute or hobby I could ascribe to myself, so\
  \ this opportunity is very special to me.</span></p> \n     <p>I'll compete for\
  \ my third Iron GM crown at Gen Con this year. As I became a better GM and storyteller,\
  \ I began to flirt with the idea of adventure and game world design, even making\
  \ notes on a few novels. I entered every year of RPG Superstar thinking I'd improved\
  \ from the year before, and hoping I could get past the gatekeepers into a round\
  \ where I might shine. When I made it in this year, I immediately started working\
  \ to take advantage of this great opportunity.</p> \n     <p>Fortunately, I have\
  \ lots of contacts from my two favorite gaming towns, both those who know about\
  \ the large events I host at Gen Con and organizers and fellow competitors at Iron\
  \ GM, LLC. In addition to gathering support from multiple areas, I worked on several\
  \ design options. In fact, not a single entry for any round of Superstar this year\
  \ was among my first three ideas.</p> \n     <p>If I have advice to offer next year's\
  \ contestants, \"never give up\" seems pretty strong. Also, I'd offer the same counsel\
  \ I give hopeful Iron GMs. Always keep your brain (and your flashdrive) stocked\
  \ with new ideas. The first one or two might not be your best. A rules twist might\
  \ make your adventure pitch impossible to submit in the final round. Have confidence,\
  \ and never stop working or improving. Submit cinematic ideas, and surround yourself\
  \ with honest editors and writing critics.</p> \n     <p>I'm working on <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8xss\">Tears at Bitter Manor</a> every day. My goal is to deliver\
  \ a gritty horror/mystery adventure, and to include plenty of new material so players\
  \ who read the proposal round will still be challenged and surprised. I look forward\
  \ to your comments and questions about the adventure when it's released, as well\
  \ as a lengthy and detailed obituary. Thanks to Paizo for this fantastic contest,\
  \ and to the online community of Pathfinder players for making me this year's RPG\
  \ Superstar!</p> \n     <p>Steven Helt<br> <i>Contributor</i></p> \n    </div> \n\
