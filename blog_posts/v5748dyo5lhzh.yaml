  \ Sajan</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, September 8, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Now that most of the design team\
  \ has told us about their favorite characters, we thought we'd invite <a href=\"\
  /paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">PACG messageboards</a>\
  \ MVP <a href=\"/people/Hawkmoon269\">Hawkmoon</a> to tell us who <i>his</i> favorite\
  \ character is.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ is a game about rules. At its core, it's really about one rule, the most important\
  \ rule, appropriately named \"The Golden Rule.\" That rule starts out with this\
  \ sentence: \"If a card and this rulebook are ever in conflict, the card should\
  \ be considered correct.\" A character really shows what makes him special when\
  \ he gets to break those rules. What makes Damiel great? Recharging potions that\
  \ should be banished. What makes Darago special? Putting cards in your hand that\
  \ would normally go back in the box. Those powers let you break the rules and bring\
  \ the most fun to the game.</p> \n     <p>Everyone who plays this game learns two\
  \ rules pretty quickly: You can only play one card of each type per step or check,\
  \ and if you don't have a way to determine which skill you are using, you have to\
  \ use Strength or Melee. The Best Character Ever gets to break both those rules\
  \ on a regular basis, and his name is Sajan.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-SajanBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p><em>Rise of the Runelords</em> Sajan can go crazy with\
  \ blessings, and he's got a deck full of them to do just that. Anyone who has ever\
  \ played him for a few adventures has probably enjoyed rolling over 100 on a check.\
  \ Nothing makes you want to buy more dice for the game more than Sajan does. In\
  \ fact, if you want to answer the question of how many dice of each type you could\
  \ possibly ever need at one time, the answer has to involve Sajan (and is probably\
  \ somewhere north of sixty dice). If you play Sajan, you'll usually save some time\
  \ if you start your turn by saying \"I'm going to need ALL the dice.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Sajan doesn't need a card to determine the skill for his check. His powers\
  \ do that for him, and they let him throw some traits on there, too. Sajan won't\
  \ have a problem with those pesky monsters that need you to use the Magic trait\
  \ to defeat them. He's got some magic in those flaming fists of his.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>But before I go too much further, let's look at the basics. One of the first\
  \ things I do when deciding on a character is see if I can find his weakness. The\
  \ easiest way to do this is to find the d4 in his stats. For Sajan, you'll notice\
  \ the distinct absence of a d4 on his character card. Don't bother searching the\
  \ back of the card either. It isn't misplaced. It just isn't there. That's right:\
  \ no d4. The worst he'll do is a d6. Your friends won't complain when Sajan encounters\
  \ the card they really want. He's got a d6, so just throw him some blessings, and\
  \ he can acquire it. It's not like Valeros running into that spell Ezren has wanted\
  \ for the past two adventures. You're worried about a nasty barrier? No problem.\
  \ Sajan's got a d6 and loads of blessings to take care of that. He's also a template\
  \ breaker. You thought Ezren was a bit odd with no blessings? How about a guy that\
  \ starts with only three of the six types of boons? And more than half of those\
  \ are blessings!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-DrunkenMaster.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-DrunkenMaster_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-ZenArcher.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-ZenArcher_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Now, let's examine his roles, Drunken Master and Zen\
  \ Archer. Both roles give you ways to soak up non-Combat damage, and they both let\
  \ you draw a card at the start of your turn. I consider that to be a safer way to\
  \ increase your hand size. Since the card isn't in your hand, you are less likely\
  \ to lose it when someone else does something foolish and that leads to you taking\
  \ damage. Also, it keeps other players from greedily asking for all your blessings.\
  \ Now, yes, as a Drunken Master he must draw 1 card. And yes, that can have some\
  \ negative consequences, namely, getting him killed. But if you aren't recharging\
  \ lots of cards with Sajan anyway, then you aren't playing him right.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>My personal favorite role is Drunken Master, for this reason: \"After you\
  \ play a boon with the Liquid trait, you may succeed at a Fortitude 6 check to recharge\
  \ it instead of banishing it.\" Throw in some skill feats to improve his Constitution,\
  \ and at 1d6+4, that 6 is almost a guarantee. Give him the Amulet of Fortitude or\
  \ a similar card, and it is a guarantee. Sajan was Damiel before being Damiel was\
  \ cool. As a Drunken Master, almost no check is impossible. Give him a Potion of\
  \ Healing, and he can go all-in, playing his massive amounts of blessings on other\
  \ characters' checks and then healing them all back in. Or better yet, give him\
  \ allies he can use to heal himself. (Father Zantus and the promo Poog of Zarongel\
  \ were constants in my deck throughout <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>.) When my\
  \ wife and I played a four-character party through <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>,\
  \ Sajan was probably the biggest reason we didn't need a character with the Divine\
  \ skill to heal us. And Drunken Master gets bonus points for probably being the\
  \ most thematic role in the game.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>But Zen Archer is no slouch either. He's recharging\
  \ those ranged weapons he would otherwise discard. Give him some bows, and he can\
  \ help with combat at other locations for the cost of a recharge. And don't miss\
  \ the fact that his \"go crazy with blessings\" power still works, even when he\
  \ plays a weapon to determine the skill for his check.</p> \n     <p>Recharge, recharge,\
  \ recharge. Sajan's character card and both his roles center on recharging things.\
  \ That's what he does! He can do it so often that you should get to see your whole\
  \ deck multiple times in a game. And what's more fun than that? No waiting around\
  \ for that particular card to come back up! Instead, you'll see it next turnâ€¦ and\
  \ probably again two turns after that.</p> \n     <p>And that is what makes him\
  \ the best. Recharge cards, cycle your deck, shrug off non-Combat damage, and roll\
  \ an unseemly number of dice. What's better than that?</p> \n     <p><a href=\"\
