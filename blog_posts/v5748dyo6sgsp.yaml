  \ Steven Walker</p> \n      </div> \n      <p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b> (@JasonBulmahn)\
  \ got his start in gaming administering the Living Greyhawk campaign, but soon after\
  \ was hired as the Managing Editor of Dragon magazine. After the end of the magazine’\
  s print run, Jason became the Lead Designer of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\
  \ Now, as Paizo’s Director of Game Design, he leads the team behind Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition. He is also an experienced Game Master, writing and running the Oblivion\
  \ Oath, a Pathfinder Actual Play stream on Twitch, and the Knights of Everflame,\
  \ a new series for Geek and Sundry.</p> \n      <p><b>Gina DeVivo</b> (@PocketGina)\
  \ is your friendly neighborhood RPG craft wizard. Having been in the entertainment\
  \ industry since she was 11 years old means she's got some groovy stories from the\
  \ sets of Madmen, Scrubs, and Hannah Montana to name a few. Lately, she's been three\
  \ character sheets stacked in a trench coat on Geek &amp; Sundry's Callisto 6, Shield\
  \ Of Tomorrow, and TBD RPG. If podcasts are your jam you can find her providing\
  \ the voices of Windsgar the goblin on Plunders and Blunders and lover of magic,\
  \ Olive, on Champions of the Earth. Also, minty things make her sneeze.</p> \n \
  \     <p><b>Jeremy Steven Walker</b> (@JwalkerScene) is an American actor originally\
  \ from Memphis, Tennessee. His first television appearance came by way of a national\
  \ commercial for Crocs that aired during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Since then, Jeremy’\
  s resume has grown considerably, as he has starred in over thirty film and television\
  \ productions, several award nominated stage plays, and dozens of worldwide and\
  \ national commercial campaigns. Quoted by film producer, Mark G. Mathis (Precious,\
  \ Brick, The Identical) as \"an extraordinary talent with recognizable star quality,\"\
  \ Jeremy's dynamic on camera presence and effortless charm have helped solidify\
  \ his place as one of the film industry's top actors to watch.</p> \n      <p><b>Aki</b>\
  \ (@MxGiniInABottle) is a recent transplant to Los Angeles and is a relative newcomer\
  \ to the world of online RPG-E, though they have been rolling dice and playing tabletop\
  \ games since university. Their most recent on-screen work includes New Pantheon,\
  \ a Scion game on Saving Throw Show, and a guest spot on Geek &amp; Sundry’s Callisto\
  \ 6!</p> \n      <p><b>Erika Fermina</b> (@astylepixie) is an actress, stylist,\
  \ and fantasy enthusiast. You can sometimes spot her on a commercial but usually\
  \ she’s playing games with Girls Guts Glory! </p> \n      <p><b>Rachel Seeley</b>\
  \ (@Sunnyseeley) is a fan of all Tabletop RPGs and an actress is always ecstatic\
  \ to combine the two. She has appeared on G&amp;S before playing on Tales from the\
  \ Loop, Weave, the Critical Role anniversary prequel and GMing on Weave!</p> \n\
  \      <p><b>Chris Fishel</b> (@AKAthefish) grew up on the sets of sitcom television\
  \ from the time he was seven years old where he discovered his true passion for\
  \ storytelling and fell in love with making feature films. 25 feature films later\
  \ Mr. Fishel brought his talent for narrative storytelling into the RPG-E space\
  \ in September 2017 when he joined the team at Geek and Sundry. After producing\
  \ shows like Starter Kit, Painters Guild and Game Masters Hall, Mr. Fishel is proud\
  \ to be the Director and producer of the new The Knights of Everflame series. </p>\
