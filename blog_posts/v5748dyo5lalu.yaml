  \ are sated; It's time to blog!</p> \n   <p>Time for a little back history on everyone's\
  \ favorite literate goblin (and by that, I mean Golarion's only literate goblin):\
  \ I love science fiction, but I am woefully ignorant of the subject. I sat on my\
  \ mother's knee and watched <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Star Trek</i>, I read through\
  \ my father's dog-eared old copy of <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i>, and a few\
  \ of my Saturday morning cartoons were set in space. That's about it. I remember\
  \ reading some <i>John Carter of Mars</i> in junior high, but it didn't leave enough\
  \ of an impression on me at the time that I even remember it that well. As embarrassing\
  \ as it is for any goblin to admit, I just don't know much about this subject I\
  \ enjoy, least of all its mysterious origins.</p> \n   <p>I supposed that's why\
  \ Erik Mona, Pierce Watters, Christopher Carey, and James Sutter, the quartet behind\
  \ Paizo's <a href=\"/planetStories\"> <i> Planet Stories</i></a>, line, asked me\
  \ to start reading and reviewing this classic science fiction. Without any fond\
  \ childhood memories (literally; my childhood involved being locked in a rabbit\
  \ hutch with my 27 siblings), I wouldn't be viewing any of our Planet Stories fiction\
  \ through the lens of nostalgia. Instead, I can dole out honest thoughts and observations\
  \ on twentieth-century classics from a twenty-first century perspective.</p> \n\

  \ \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>From my perspective, this is both thrilling and terrifying,\
  \ like riding one of those blood-thirsty horses humans are so fond of. Now I get\
  \ to read the classic origins of science fiction from almost a century ago <i>for\
  \ work</i>, but at the same time, these are books that my boss loves. If I don't\
  \ like them, will he feed me to the dreaded bandersnatch? Plus the library of Planet\
  \ Stories is huge, and getting bigger every other month! Growing like a well-fed\
  \ literary octopus (and you thought those metaphors were dead and gone). For my\
  \ very first Sci-Fried, I decided to look at Henry Kuttner's <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81tx\"\
  > <i>The Dark World</i></a>. </p> \n   <p>Time for another confession that will\
  \ get me laughed at in the forums: I selected Mr. Kuttner because I really enjoyed\
  \ the movie <i>The Last Mimzy</i>, which is based on Kuttner's short story <i>Mimsy\
  \ Were the Borogroves</i>. I imagined that <i>Dark World</i> would be somewhat similar,\
  \ familiar, and comforting in this strange new land of fiction. </p>\n   <p>But\
  \ no. There was nary a stuffed rabbit to be found.</p> \n   <p>Instead, the story\
  \ follows Edward Bond, who is not a little girl but rather a World War II veteran\
  \ who feels strangely out of place in his own skin. It turns out that Edward Bond\
  \ is not Edward Bond at all, but rather the wizard Ganelon from a parallel world,\
  \ trussed up with Edward Bond's memories and life as a prison. I don't want to share\
  \ too much of the story, but obviously the majority of the book takes place in the\
  \ bizarre titular \"Dark World,\" and many of the descriptions of this setting are\
  \ both psychedelic and believable.</p> \n   <p>Kuttner's writing style is distinctively\
  \ \"chunky;\" very intricate descriptions and bulgy sentences that can be a little\
  \ difficult to handle at first if you're used to the \"say it all now\" style of\
  \ modern authors. But <i>The Dark World</i> drew me in after the first chapter,\
  \ and I had trouble putting the book down once that happened. What at first seemed\
  \ like a fantasy story instead took a sharp turn into sci-fi as Kuttner tried to\
  \ explain everything from vampires and werewolves to Cthulhian gods with the science\
  \ of the 1940s. Some of the theories stretched my suspension of disbelief, but never\
  \ quite broke it. Having finished the book now, I almost wish it were longer, with\
  \ more time to examine the uncanny science and history of the Dark World itself.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The narrator is probably the best part of the book. We see everything\
  \ through the protagonist's eyes, but until the very end we're never told for certain\
  \ whether it's Ganelon with Edward's memories, or Edward with Ganelon's memories.\
  \ Control switches between the two personalities, and bits of memory bleed through\
  \ to the other, which makes what could've been an obnoxiously perfect hero into\
  \ an underdog I could root for. I really want to spoil the ending, because it made\
  \ me cackle with delight, but instead I will demand that you order your own copy\
  \ and read it for yourself.</p> \n   <p>My final impressions of <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81tx\"\
  > <i>The Dark World</i></a> are that it can be a difficult book to start, but once\
  \ you get into the pace and get used to Kuttner's narrative flavor, it's an impossible\
  \ book to stop. Once all the pieces are in play, the action flows fast and furious,\
  \ with only occasional chapter breaks to let you catch your breath. <i>The Dark\
  \ World</i> is relatively short, making it a great first step into the genre of\
  \ pulp that you can read in one sitting. If you love science and history as much\
  \ as I do, then some of the genre explanations will make you positively giddy. A\
  \ fun book, even 63 years after it was originally published, and definitely one\
  \ I'd recommend.</p> \n   <p><i>Dark World</i> may have lacked hyper-advanced stuffed\
  \ bunnies, but that's only because this book is for grownups.</p> \n   <p>Crystal\
