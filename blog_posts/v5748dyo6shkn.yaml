  \ the Land of the Long White Cloud, home of Hobbiton, Xena, and both of the Conchords,\
  \ my home: New Zealand! I am Paul Trani, one of the Venture Captains of this exquisite\
  \ place, and just like you, I have seen my role-playing game practice change dramatically\
  \ this past year, in both how and why I game. With respect to the latter, I am so\
  \ grateful for the Organized Play (OP) community, both in-person and virtual, for\
  \ preserving (slightly) my sanity, and when the opportunity to give back came around,\
  \ I critically failed my Will save. On purpose. </em></p><em> <p>And so I find myself\
  \ the chairperson of the Onboarding Task Force, a newly-created volunteer group\
  \ of venture officers working to help new players discover the world of Pathfinder\
  \ Society (PFS) and wow! am I both excited and humbled by the talented people that\
  \ populate this group. The taskforce team is made up of Daniel Baker, Douglas Hahn,\
  \ Katrina Hennessy, Kevin Baumann, Kristin Wilhite, Michael VonHasseln, Peter Nalepa,\
  \ Nicole Heits, Kiela Butson, Kara Kramer-Rapp, Dustin Knight, and Joel Hager.</p>\
  \ <p>But Paul, you ask, doesn’t New Zealand have an official wizard? Yes, he lives\
  \ in Christchurch - you can look it up, but I’d like to tell you about what the\
  \ Onboarding Task Force has been doing in the course of the past four months</p>\
  \ <p>We started work with a specific request - reduce the barriers to entry for\
  \ new players. In the current mostly-digital world, that translated to finding a\
  \ way to transition the chronicle sheets to allow for treasure and scenario rewards\
  \ to be tracked differently. We created a format that can be used either physically\
  \ or electronically and we’re continuing to look at more ways that this can be tracked\
  \ even more simply. You can find the <a href=\"https://www.orgplayfoundation.org/join/new-players-pop/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">tracking tools here</a>.</p> <p>Since that time, we’ve been\
  \ asked to do a few more things. We’ve been working extra hard on helping you to\
  \ take characters from that cool new <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox\"\
  >Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> that you or a loved one got for Christmas and played\
  \ all the way through. We’re publishing a guide that will help transition characters\
  \ built with Beginner Box rules into full-fledged Pathfinder Society Characters.\
  \ You can find the guide here: <a href=\"https://www.orgplayfoundation.org/pf2bb/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Beginner Box conversion guide</a>.</p> <p>We’ve got lots more\
  \ in the pipeline that we’re working on, which will post to the Organized Play Foundation\
  \ website when finished. We’re really excited about our new projects and can’t wait\
  \ to show them to you. </p> <p>Our team is here to help the community get involved\
  \ in organized play. Got a suggestion? We’re always open to new ideas. You can send\
  \ them to me at <u>we.be.dunedinpfs@gmail.com</u>. </p> <p>It’s a pleasure to be\
  \ helping bring the new generation of Golarionites to the Starstone, as it were,\
  \ and we on the Onboarding Team wish you all the natural 20s that are coming to\
  \ you. </p> </em>\n       <p><em>Cheers!</em></p> \n       <p style=\"margin-left:\

  \    <p>Update time! We uploaded sanctioning documents for <em>Pathfinder Adventure:\
