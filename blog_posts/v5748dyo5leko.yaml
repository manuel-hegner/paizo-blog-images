  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">WizKids secret agents have been making\
  \ multiple weekly trips to Paizo these days, and each time they show up they have\
  \ a chest full of pirate's treasure. Ok, that's not true, but for nerds like me\
  \ it's pretty close. In fact they've been bringing over the latest paint masters\
  \ for figures in this summer's <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures, and man, they shine like the brightest gold\
  \ to these old pirate eyes!</span></p> \n    <p>The new set supports the popular\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure\
  \ Path</a>, and provides a host of creatures that have never before appeared in\
  \ prepainted plastic (many of which, I might add, came from suggestions from the\
  \ Pathfinder faithfulâ€”so keep those requests coming!). This week I present a motley,\
  \ more or less random assortment of figures from the set.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130315-Selissa.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130315-Selissa_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first is Selissa, a young aquatic naga pushed into\
  \ the \"civilized\" lands of the Shackles isles by unusually dry conditions in her\
  \ usual river habitats. That means she's hungry and desperate, and ready to bite\
  \ a chunk of refreshing meat from your player characters.</p> \n    <p>Selissa is\
  \ an interesting figure because she's size Medium, one step smaller than standard\
  \ aquatic nagas. One of the cool things about basing these sets on actual characters\
  \ from actual adventures is that it gives us a chance to do some oddball figures\
  \ that maybe wouldn't make sense in a more \"generic\" set.</p> \n    <p>The figure\
  \ looks amazing in hand, with vibrant blues and greens and an aquatic shine that\
  \ adds an extra layer of creepiness.</p> \n    <p>\"But she's the wrong size!\"\
  \ some might exclaim. \"Why didn't you include a Large aquatic naga in the set?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>To which I'd reply. \"She's the right size for Selissa, and a cool\
  \ figure to boot. You'll just have to wait a bit longer to see the Large version\
  \ that's ALSO in this set!\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-Shimerae.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-Shimerae_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up next we have a classic creature of fantasy\
  \ gaming that to my knowledge has never before been produced in prepainted plastic.\
  \ We call this Large abomination Shimerae, and in the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure\
  \ Path she's the beloved pet (and convenient poison source) for a nasty alchemist.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In the real world, she's an amazing, amazing miniature that I can't wait\
  \ to throw up against my hated enemies (by which I mean my players).</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130315-Arronax.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130315-Arronax_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>But it wouldn't be a proper <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> preview without a kick-ass pirate, and this week we've\
  \ got a baddy who you really don't want to run into on the open sea. I give you\
  \ Arronax Endymion, Lord of Hell Harbor and renegade former commander of the Fourth\
  \ Fleet of Imperial Cheliax. That didn't turn out for him, and now he ranks among\
  \ the most powerful pirate lords of the Shackles Isles.</p> \n    <p>I think he\
  \ also makes a nice sub for any kind of naval officer or player character with a\
  \ naval background. By the time we're done with this set, you'll be able to pair\
  \ him up with tons of different pirate lords OR team him up with Chelish naval officers,\
  \ all of whom will be sailing into view in the coming weeks.</p> \n    <p>You can\
  \ make sure you get all of these figures by setting up an <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\"\
  >Ongoing Pathfinder Battles Subscription</a> today!</p> \n    <p>The set is scheduled\
  \ for a summer release, so start getting your sea legs. There's a long and exciting\
  \ voyage ahead!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n \
