  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/Qadira_med.jpg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n    <p><i> The western tip of the vast, continent-spanning\
  \ Padishah Empire of Kelesh, the Satrapy of Qadira serves as the gateway between\
  \ the wealth and resources of eastern Casmaron and the eager ports and markets of\
  \ the Inner Sea. Its singular position as the funnel through which Casmaron's wealth\
  \ f lows has painted Qadira's outlook on the world, and from the richest trade prince\
  \ of Katheer to the lowliest caravan driver of the vast southern deserts, Qadirans\
  \ recognize that the way to true power and influence is through trade and economic\
  \ dominance. And no single city or nation is more strategically placed to rule the\
  \ markets of the entire region than Absalom, which is why the satrap has invested\
  \ substantial resources and his best agents in ensuring that Qadira gains control\
  \ over trade in Absalom and—shortly thereafter—the entirety of Avistan and northern\
  \ Garund.</i></p> \n    <p>The weekend is over and now there's profit to be made!\
  \ And that's Qadira's bag. In many ways, it's the most accessible faction for those\
  \ of us living in the real world, because, you know, we all understand how much\
  \ power comes with money. It is nice, after all, to be able to buy the things you\
  \ need and to charge what you think you're worth for the services you provide to\
  \ others.</p> \n    <div align=\"right\"> \n     <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"\
  0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"right\">\n      <tbody>\n       <tr>\n        <td><a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZO9235-NewGuy.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZO9235-NewGuy_180.jpeg\" border=\"\

  >Illustration by Ryan Portillo</td>\n       </tr>\n      </tbody>\n     </table>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>So we already talked about a few changes coming to some of\
  \ the other factions, but Qadira is one of the two getting the largest shakeup.\
  \ I don't want to spoil anything, especially in light of two new scenarios coming\
  \ out later this week, but I will say this: the change is going to take place \"\
  on screen.\" So once people have played the scenario in which the proverbial stuff\
  \ hits the fan, use this thread to discuss it. Just use spoiler tags, or at least\
  \ charge your fellow Pathfinders a fee for the information you possess. After all,\
  \ what true Qadiran wouldn't profit when profit can be had?</p> \n    <p>And you're\
  \ likely wondering who the mysterious stranger is in this blog post. Well, I'm not\
  \ going to say. At least not for free... </p>\n    <p>Come back next week for a\
  \ look at how to get ahead in the Pathfinder Society, or how to take your time and\
  \ enjoy the scenery a bit more. Next Monday's blog is likely to make a lot of players\
  \ very happy.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n   </blockquote>\
