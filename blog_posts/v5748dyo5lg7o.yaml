  /products/btpy951a\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords</i></a>\
  \ will be hitting shelves, stores, and front steps. In <a href=\"/products/btpy92vf\"\
  ><i>Rise of the Runelords Adventure Deck 6: Spires of Xin-Shalast</i></a>, our heroes\
  \ have mastered the lore and magic of the Runeforge, and are now ready to take the\
  \ battle to the ultimate force behind their troubles to date: an ancient master\
  \ of magic, the Runelord of Greed, somehow returned from the long-lost Thassilonian\
  \ Empire. Armed now with Runeforged Weapons, you need but find the secret redoubt\
  \ of the Runelord, and you will be able to end his threat once and for all.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Where might it be? I'll give you a hint.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>When I said \"scale the mountain face\", that's not\
  \ what I meant!\n    </div> \n    <p>The legends say that Mhar Massif is the final\
  \ resting place of a colossal entity that attempted to force his way into Golarion\
  \ from some alien realm. Mhar was stopped, somehow—stories vary—but his titanic\
  \ face still adorns the top of the great peak. Guess where you need to go?</p> \n\
  \    <p>Regardless of which parts of the story are true and which are fancy, one\
  \ thing is certain: scaling the Mhar Massif is a deadly undertaking. There are many\
  \ paths, but only one actual choice. Climb into and through the Death Zones, defeat\
  \ or negotiate with the otherworldly creatures that dot the mountain, and reach\
  \ the top... if you can.</p> \n    <p><i>I'm sorry, did someone say Death Zones?</i>\
  \ As you ascend, the air supply ranges from thin to non-existent, and soon enough\
  \ altitude sickness will set in. Though heat and air may be in short supply, the\
  \ other legacy of Mhar's petrified presence—the thin veil between Golarion and the\
  \ nightmare realm of Leng—is all too present. In the Death Zones, the surreal spectacle\
  \ of strange creatures and freak magical happenings is punctuated only by the occasional\
  \ avalanche.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6006-DeathZone1.jpg\"\

  \     <br>Well, it's not called the \"Puppies and Sunshine Zone\".\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Speaking of strange... Strange alliances abound, as these mammoth-sized\
  \ spider creatures demand that you destroy the enigmatic Leng Device, or become\
  \ spider food. They won't tell you exactly what the device <i>does</i>, but they\
  \ do insist that its destruction will distress their enemies in a most pleasing\
  \ way. Should you refuse the demand or negotiate badly, the Leng Spider's unnatural\
  \ poison will cause terrible paranoia and hallucinations. Just ask your friends!</p>\

  \ known as the Pinnacle of Avarice, seat of power for every Runelord of Greed in\
  \ the ancient Thassilonian empire. Recently awakened from thousands of years of\
  \ frozen stasis, the well-equipped denizens of the Pinnacle await the return of\
  \ their master.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6006-Pinnacle1.jpg\"\

  \    <br>You climbed the great mountain, survived the Death Zones, and \"convinced\"\
  \ the Leng Spiders to let you pass—and what do you find? Something else to climb!\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Whether you negotiated through or negotiated with the Leng\
  \ Spiders, your path forward will eventually cross the Leng Device. Constructed\
  \ through an alliance between the immoral arcanists of Xin-Shalast and the inhuman\
  \ denizens of Leng, this recently-reactivated device seems to be warping time—and\
  \ <b>something</b> is coming through!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \    <p>An unearthly howl echoes around the Pinnacle as this enormous hound-shaped\
  \ creature ripples in and out of reality. A malign intelligence peers out of bulging\
  \ black eyes as the creature clacks forward on razor-sharp talons, and a long, tentacle-like\
  \ tongue darts back and forth, tasting the minds nearby. Beware the Thing From Beyond\
  \ Time, or you might find your own time running out!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \   <p>But wait, there's more! While it is certainly <i>a</i> threat, the Thing\
  \ From Beyond Time is really more of a houseguest. Before you deal with the master\
  \ of the house, you'll need to deal with the welcoming committee.</p> \n    <p>First\
  \ up, the Wardens. These blue-skinned, rune-covered giants send arcs of lightning\
  \ through the area before taking up titanic blades easily capable of slicing through\
  \ the entire party at once.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6006-Warden.jpg\"\

  \ recently awakened from stasis, the First Apprentice of the Runelord of Greed has\
  \ fallen out of favor. Destroying your party seems like just the opportunity he\
  \ needs to remedy that situation!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Oi! Ten thousand years will give you <i>such</i>\
  \ a crick in the neck!\n    </div> \n    <p>The favored champion of the Runelord,\
  \ Viorian Dekanti, has given herself over to the artifact weapon known as Chellan,\
  \ Sword of Greed. If you can overcome their combined threat, perhaps you might take\
  \ the sword for your own!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6006-Viorian.jpg\"\

  \ remains. Even the dreaded lamia matriarchs bow to the unholy oracle Ceoptra. Her\
  \ strikes leave withered destruction which cannot be healed by normal methods, so\
  \ we recommend that you not fail. Should your first attempt provide a worthy challenge,\
  \ she will fully prepare for the second round.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ to heal ...\"—Kyra\n    </div> \n    <p>As we approach the final confrontation\
  \ of the <i>Rise of the Runelords adventure path</i>, there are still some boons\
  \ to go along with the banes. For example, our heroes are now powerful enough to\
  \ invoke the aid of the gods directly against the advancing plots of their enemies\
  \ (i.e. the blessings deck). In dire circumstances, the truly desperate—and the\
  \ truly prepared—can call upon the power of the gods to give themselves that extra\
  \ chance to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Turning \"almost\" into \"just enough\"!\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>You might find this buried amongst the trappings of the Pinnacle of Avarice,\
  \ or worn on the finger of an opponent. Either way, this protective ring can prove\
  \ a lifesaver when enduring the elements, be they natural or (more often) not.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6006-Ring.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6006-Ring_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\
  \ \n     <br>Whether facing dragons (yes, plural), ancient Azlanti wizards, or rune-covered\
  \ giants, this ring is sure to come in handy.\n    </div> \n    <p>Even in these\
  \ rarefied heights, it is possible to find help in unlikely places—or is that unlikely\
  \ faces? Gyukak is a resident of Xin-Shalast who isn't exactly your friend <i>or</i>\
  \ your enemy. Rather, this Oni has disguised and ingratiated himself with several\
  \ stone giants in Xin-Shalast, with the goal of eventually leading them to greener\
  \ pastures. A potent distraction like the PCs might be just the sort of thing Gyukak\
  \ needs to make his move, so he's willing to help out—for a while.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6006-Gyukak.jpg\"\

  \ enjoyed this peek ahead into <a href=\"/products/btpy92vf\"><i>Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure Deck 6: Spires of Xin-Shalast</i></a>. If you can make it through this,\
