  \    </div> \n    <p>Cave raptors are sated, so now it is time for blogging!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Few things spring into the world fully formed, and game products are\
  \ no exception. And if you aren't involved in the publishing industry, you might\
  \ expect the life cycle of a supplement as unknowable as that of an octopus.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And it is.</p> \n    <p>As a neophyte nanny in the Paizo maternity ward,\
  \ my elbows-deep, on-the-job training has been a real eye-opener. And if I have\
  \ to suffer through that experience, then there's no reason not to share the pain.\
  \ Over the next few weeks, we'll take a look at the stages of development of a young\
  \ sourcebook, show off embarrassing baby pictures, and generally demystify the miracle\
  \ of life as we follow <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj&quot;\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><i>Dwarves of Golarion</i></a> from Outline, to Development,\
  \ through Art Orders, Editing, Layout, Extra Editing, and finally Printing and Shipping.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The octopus knows it is time to reproduce when the seasons are right.\
  \ Similarly, Paizo Publisher par excellence, Erik Mona, explains that a product\
  \ first emerges when the various carriers demand a season's previews for their catalogs.\
  \ At this point, the development team enters a furious ritual to determine whose\
  \ memes are passed on to the next generation of Pathfinder canon.</p> \n    <p>Once\
  \ the product ideas are agreed upon, each one goes on to outlining.</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ a book egg, the outline doesn't tell us much, except that the book is healthy\
  \ and to start preparing the office for its blessed arrival. We know who the proud\
  \ papas are, and the outline hints if the book will grow into a fluffy nerd or crunchy\
  \ jock, but nothing is set in stone just yet. Developers dig out warm nests in a\
  \ hard drive to house the outline, lining it with file folders and sticky notes\
  \ until writers can be assigned to help the book hatch and develop. A title (and\
  \ adorable nickname) is decided upon, the chapters are parsed out, words counts\
  \ are decided, and a handful of notes give developers and contributors an idea what\
  \ the baby book will look like all grown up.</p> \n    <p>Unlike the noble octopus,\
  \ the developer does not hover over the outline, constantly blowing salt water over\
  \ it. Sean Reynolds occasionally spills latte on his, but more in a crude ritual\
  \ to beg the gaming gods for the product's continued health.</p> \n    <p>Some things\
  \ are immutable: Companions and Modules are Small sized (32pages), while Chronicles\
  \ and APs will grow to Medium size (64 and 96 pages). Much like octopi, the largest,\
  \ healthiest writers get first claim to the larger, healthier books, though until\
  \ the outline hatches into development, even it's parentage can change.</p> \n \
  \   <div>\n     <table border=\"0\" align=\"right\">\n      <tbody>\n       <tr>\n\
  \        <td><a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCompanion/PZO9408-SampleOutline.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCompanion/PZO9408-SampleOutline_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a></td>\n       </tr>\n       <tr>\n        <td align=\"center\">Dwarves of Golarion\
  \ Outline</td>\n       </tr>\n      </tbody>\n     </table>\n    </div> \n    <p>As\
  \ we can see from these adorable <i>Dwarves of Golarion</i> baby photos, the prenatal\
  \ book doesn't resemble the adult product except in title. As the final draft of\
  \ the outline, it's already showing the beginning signs of development: Exact words\
  \ counts for each chapter have been decided and writers have been assigned to sit\
  \ on the project until it hatches. We can also see in the bottom, left-hand corner\
  \ that a goblin has chewed on this outline: an obvious indicator of superior product!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Without the outline, development would grow higgledy-piggledy, with chapters\
  \ repeating each other, growing like tumors until they stretched the page count\
  \ to breaking. Writers would run free, uncontrolled and burning things they shouldn't\
  \ burn. Chaos would spill into the streets, and civilization as we know it would\
  \ crumble.</p> \n    <p>So remember kids, be like the mighty octopus: plan your\
  \ books carefully before getting started and save us all unneeded anarchy.</p>\n\
