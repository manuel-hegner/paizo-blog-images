                <p itemprop="description">Today, the International Transgender Day of Visibility, we celebrate and recognize the lives of transgender people in our gaming community. As several of the authors in today’s blog point out, roleplaying games have a unique ability to let us explore, sometimes for fun, sometimes to learn about ourselves, and often both at the same time. By continuing to work to ensure that Paizo has transgender representation in our stories, and our community, we hope to provide space and time for players and GMs, authors and artists, partners and competitors, employees and fans, to be able to travel through life’s journey, living, learning, growing, and of course, gaming.</p> 
                <p>The importance of this day, a day to acknowledge and celebrate trans voices in our communities, is punctuated by recent political actions seeking to prevent trans youth from receiving medical care, yet another attempt in a long history to silence a group of people and strip away their humanity. This day is highlighted by its relation to the Transgender Day of Remembrance (November 20th) which honors the trans lives lost to violence, bigotry, and indifference. We hope that this day of visibility can stand as a beacon of light and hope for the trans people in all of the different roles in our gaming community: from colleagues to contractors, players to partners. Wherever you are on your journey, we’re glad to have you around the table to roll dice, tell stories, and make some truly fantastic memories together.</p> 
                <p>Below are contributions from several of our transgender community members, each focused on their personal truth and experience. Some of these entries are raw and emotional. This is a very personal topic, and we support our contributors in speaking genuinely about a subject that affects every part of their lives. We thank them for taking the time to share their insight with the wider community. </p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5d96c141-7350-41cc-a478-5b5da2cb0301/033121_Medda.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5d96c141-7350-41cc-a478-5b5da2cb0301/033121_Medda.png" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A long haired warrior dressed in leather armor with a fur mantle, carrying a spear"></a>

                <p>I’ve spent a lot of time playing and making TTRPGs. When I first started playing Pathfinder regularly in 2013, I already knew I was trans. It took me a while before I started playing explicitly trans characters, since I was worried that people who played in my local area wouldn’t be welcoming. Since then, the world has changed. While I still experience transphobia, I’m more confident moving through the world as a trans person. Part of this comes from having more stability in my life, but a big part is seeing other trans people be able to live genuinely. Inclusion of trans characters in Paizo books, particularly the wealth of characters in Lost Omens: Legends, often starts with individual contributors deciding to push for more trans representation. Representation can never replace having trans people creating and playing TTRPGs, but it sends a clear sign that trans people are invited in. I live my life as open as possible and include trans characters in my writing to let trans people know they’re welcome, and to let people who are thinking about coming out as trans see full, happy trans lives.<br> <em>Rigby Bendele, freelance author (they/them)</em></p> 
                <br> 
                <p>I’m Alison Cybe, and I’ve been playing TTRPGs since 1993. That makes me older than most types of fossils. I started early, when my parents bought me one of TSR’s black box games for my birthday. Because of that, I’m one of those people who will talk endlessly about how important a good starter set is for a game. I was also one of those players who was always “happy” to play a female character as well as a male one. I kinda noticed that a lot of players in my local club were the opposite, but a few of us were content to “cross-RP,” as it was called back then. I’ve not actually heard anyone call it that for years now, which is good. Shows that we’ve moved on a lot. This means that, for me, gaming provided a safe “fantasy space” to explore the way that gender is constructed and perform as the type of woman I had always somewhat wanted to be. Over the years, I've met a lot of trans and nonbinary people whose first avenues of exploration were the same and ultimately lead to understanding their own identities. Because of that, I always tend to be quite outspoken on the idea that trans characters should be visible in games. There are no settings that don’t benefit from the added diversity of characters, and the value that they give to the audiences outweighs the upset that they cause to bigots (which is, in my honest opinion, an additional bonus). The best way to do this is to create avenues for trans people to write trans characters and subjects—in fact, publishers should do this with people of every minority as much as possible. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.<br> <em>-Alison Cybe, freelance author (they/them) or (she/her)</em></p> 
                <br> 
                <p>I know that “visibility” is an issue I’m supposed to care about. I know that it’s the first step along the very, very long path toward you people treating us like actual human beings, rather than aberrations. Honestly, though, this week? I really couldn’t care less.</p> 
                <p>I’m supposed to use this blog to talk about how including trans characters enriches a fictional world. They do, of course—at bare minimum because trans people exist in the real world. To not include us in your narratives, or in your games, is a quiet signifier that you really wouldn’t mind if we were gone. Believe me when I say: trans people notice when you do this. We put you on the list of cissies we don’t trust. And we all have a list. We have to—you might kill us, after all. </p> 
                <p>Don’t believe me? Ask one of your trans friends. You do have trans friends, right?</p> 
                <p>Personally, I’d love to talk about examples of trans characters enriching fictional worlds—but then, of course, I’d need some examples. Which examples should I use? The ones where we’re monstrous, misogynistic villains, like in Silence of the Lambs? The ones where we’re broken, made to suffer, in the hopes that you all might actually start caring about our struggle, like The Last of Us Part 2? Or maybe softer ones, like The Danish Girl, where you couldn’t even be bothered to cast an actress to play the title role? Which disrespect would you like me to entertain?</p> 
                <p>(Perhaps you think I’m being unfair, by lumping you in with the others. Can’t imagine what that’s like.)</p> 
                <p>I don’t know how I’m expected to talk about how trans characters enrich a fictional world when I’ve almost never seen a fictional world that let a trans character enrich it. I can count on one hand the number of positive media representations of trans people that I’ve personally witnessed, let alone enjoyed. But then again, this is just art imitating life: as the Arkansas legislature so forcefully reminded us this week, you don’t want trans people to enrich the real world, either.</p> 
                <p>I would love to be proven wrong on this. But the operative word there is “prove.” This is the thing that none of you seem to get: you have to prove it. By default, to protect ourselves, I and other trans people have to assume you hate us. So prove us wrong. </p> 
                <p>Prove us wrong by writing us into your stories. Write us with rich inner lives. Write us messy and flawed and full of joy. Write us full of hatred for a world that hated us first. And then, when you’re done, pay a trans person to tell you all the ways you got it wrong. Because you will get it wrong, and that’s okay. What’s not okay is complacency in the face of that wrongness. Cis complacency digs trans graves.</p>

                <p>My name is Sasha Laranoa Harving, although I also go by the name Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, and I am neither male nor female. That doesn't mean I lack a gender, although it does for some, and I personally use nov/nov/novs/novself pronouns. For me, my experience with gender was always one of looking up at the stars on dark nights in the countryside and feeling at home, more so than I ever did in the house I lived in. I felt like I was one with the stars for many years, in a way no other person I meet seemed to resonate with. And as time went on, as I realized there was something else to me than my mediocre life had implied, I discovered roleplaying games, and I saw characters who expressed their gender more freely than I had, colorful gnomes whose stats proudly declared them nonbinary! Spiteful dragons who dared to lack a gender in a time when the roles forced upon us were clear and seemingly constant! I also discovered Starfinder with its acknowledgment of the power the stars have: fiery and passionate, cold and distant, a variation for every pinprick of light in the sky, just like the people upon this world. I realized my gender was more than an expression along a two-point scale; my gender was that of the stellar world above and deserving to be acknowledged, embraced, and loved, just like every other light above and every life below. So, when you call me, hear me: I am a star.<br> <em>- Sasha Laranoa Harving, freelance author (nov/nov)</em></p> 
                <br> 
                <p>My name is Sol, short for Solomon, though you won’t see that on any of Paizo’s products—yet. I hemmed and hawed a lot about taking part in this blog as, compared to a lot of people here, I’m very new. I’ve only been at Paizo for about six months. It’s my first job in the RPG industry, and the first where I felt comfortable enough to publicly use they/them. It is, in fact, the first place outside the internet where I’ve started taking steps to be visible as who and what I am. These steps are not steady. To be visible to others, to be known, and to admit that those who knew me maybe don’t—it’s scary. I think lots of people with recently-cracked eggs feel the same way, even if they—like me—have a good and trusted support network, and even if they—like me—have dabbled with the thought of transitioning for years. Like others, I used RPGs to play with gender long before I thought to apply those principles to myself. Recently, though, it’s been the growing number of visibly trans, nonbinary, and just plain queer characters in the gaming sphere and beyond that have bolstered my courage and reaffirmed my intent. Every casual, singular “they” and genderless or trans NPC that comes across my desk leaves me thinking, “I want that. Someday. And I can have it, when I’m ready.” For those like me, who aren’t quite ready, that representation offers comfort, lessons, and a promise. It reassures that there has always been a place for us, a place that will wait until we’re ready to be seen. So, this is me tilting my hand. I’m here. I’m almost ready. And for those like me: I know you’re out there. Take all the time you need. We’ll see you.<br> <em>-Solomon, Paizo staff (they/them)</em></p> 
                <br> 
                <p>Roleplaying games helped me discover who I am. By being able to play different characters, all with aspects of myself imbued within them, I have been able to discover more about myself than I thought possible. Growing up, I’d play RPGs, video game and tabletop, and I’d play powerful women doing amazing things as often as possible. When I’d get stuck playing a “boy character,” I’d often just focus on mechanics and ignore the character, or imbue these compulsory male heroes with stereotypical traits, betraying my disingenuous view of masculinity. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I started researching transgender women in order to properly write one into an adventure. I found the experiences, thoughts, and feelings of these women to be eerily like my own. It was then that I had the realization that I am trans. My own journey of accidental self-discovery by writing a trans character into an adventure inspired me to stay visible and keep trans characters visible in our games. I hoped that it would help other people discover themselves by seeing someone like them depicted in stories. And it has worked. I’ve heard from multiple gamers that seeing a transgender character, written by transgender authors, has lead them to self-acceptance and given them courage to confront the social norms of our society and the roles that have been thrust upon us by the circumstances of our birth. Representation matters. Being visible matters. It’s a small step, but one that will lead us to a more peaceful and prosperous future.<br> <em>-Vanessa Hoskins, freelance author (she/her)</em></p>

                <h3>Emily Crowell</h3> 
                <p>I first started working in the video game industry where I worked with Nintendo on many fun projects, a favorite being <em>Zelda: Twilight Princess</em>. While there, I got to work with Sonja and met Sarah briefly. I then worked freelance making strategy guides for Pokémon and video game maps for guides like <em>Skyfall</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em>. I was then offered a great opportunity to join the Paizo family and learn about producing TTRPGs and have been there ever since. I now get to work with Sonja, Sarah, and an incredible art team. I once again am working on maps, laying out new products, and really enjoy ordering art as a Senior Graphic Designer. I love seeing the amazing pieces we have come in and the fans reactions to them.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Sonja Morris</h3> 
                <p>I have been working in gaming since 1991, starting in the video game industry then moving to TTRPG in 2012, achieving the position of Managing Art Director. I have many favorite projects that I have worked on at Paizo, but the thing I love the most is collaborating with my colleagues to come up with fun and engaging art and design. In addition to gaming, I love horror movies, music, and spending time with my wife Alex and chihuahua Max.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Sarah Robinson</h3> 
                <p>I am one of the most senior employees here at Paizo and hold the position of Director of Visual Design. I started with <em>Dragon Magazine</em> and have worked on almost every project since. Working with the many artists that take our art descriptions to final illustrations, for all of our projects, is the best part of my job. I knew Sonja long before my days here at Paizo when we were creating layouts for <em>Nintendo Power</em> and I met Emily during that time. It has been great to work with them again, along with the rest of the art team.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/24327b12-d026-4970-b4cb-1f88222b9acf/102120_Storm-Bear.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/24327b12-d026-4970-b4cb-1f88222b9acf/102120_Storm-Bear.png" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A large blue and white bear with ruins on its chest and lightning between its claws"></a>

                <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> 
                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica Catalan. I’m a mom, freelance author, and blogger, and I’m thrilled to stand alongside the many talented women working in tabletop gaming. As a huge fan of Pathfinder and Starfinder, writing for Paizo is a dream come true. It’s been a wonderful experience full of exciting projects, fulfilling work, and welcoming people, both in the company and among my fellow freelancers. (You can find my announced projects here: <a href="https://paizo.com/people/JessicaCatalan">https://paizo.com/people/JessicaCatalan</a> )</p> 
                <p>When I was offered the opportunity to write for today’s blog, I pounced—then faltered. The words wouldn’t come and, as much as I’m happy in my skin, that wasn’t always true. Like many women, I heard “you can’t” and “you’re just a girl” more than I care to remember. I endured the insults and arbitrary constraints. But as a girl growing up in the 90s, when ‘girl power’ was in full swing and sarcastic girls kicked ass in robot pterodactyls, I reclaimed my femininity with pride while young. Media—from Sailor Moon to Pink and countless others—made all the difference. I had it easy.</p> 
                <p>I’ve always been a quiet person—never one to stand up or seek recognition. But I have a daughter. And when she came home from Kindergarten a few years ago, in tears from enduring all too familiar insults for the first time, it became glaringly obvious the issues I’d thought I’d left behind weren’t better; I’d just became accustomed to fighting past them. Now I had to teach her to do the same.</p> 
                <p>There’s a moment in Avengers: End Game where the Marvel women unite onscreen. It’s short, but the sight brought my daughter to tears. That was her Spice Girls—forty seconds of female superheroes carrying a glove—and then it was gone. My son didn’t even notice. Representation matters—for girls like my daughter, yes, but also for countless other people enduring so much worse with less visibility.</p> 
                <p>My name is Jessica Catalan. I’m a Canadian, Métis woman and author in the gaming industry. This is me standing up to be counted. Whoever you represent and whatever you stand for, I hope you join me. To someone out there, it means world.</p>

                <h3>Simone D. Sallé</h3> 
                <p>Hi fellow creatives! I first worked with the Paizo team in 2018 as a contract editor for the 2e Playtest, then spent the past few years as a freelance contributor (including the Starfinder Character Operations Manual, Lost Omens: Gods and Magic, Bestiary 3, &amp; more). As of this month I'm once again contracted with the editorial team full-time! I'm so grateful to get to learn from and work alongside such bright, creative people who are as passionate as I am about making TTRPGs accessible and welcoming to all. There are so many more stories to be told, so for those who want to be involved in making games—especially if you haven't seen yourself well represented in gaming spaces before—I'll share the same advice I needed to hear: don't tell yourself you're not experienced enough to belong! GM that game, join community groups like Freelance Forge, answer the open author calls. There's room for you at the table.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Nicole Heits</h3> 
                <p>Nicole joined the Paizo organized play volunteer community with a bang, jumping in to get a group going in her town, becoming a venture-agent in April of 2020. Since then, she’s lent her hands and her typing skills to many a convention online, including ConCurrent, Gen Con Online, PAX Online, and ReaperCon. The latter was a short notice event when the original organizer became ill and needed assistance and Nichole responded instantaly with offers of assistance. She lends experience to any event she’s involved in. More recently, she took on a larger leadership role in the volunteer community, including building a Rivers Region discord and helping process volunteer agreements. Her energy and enthusiasm spread to the venture-officer corps and she is an important member of the team.</p> 
                <br> 
                <p>There are more women working on projects at Paizo, sharing their creativity and energy with our community. To those in the blog and those who prefer to remain behind the scenes, we thank you for sharing your gifts with our community. For anyone interested in joining the greater Paizo community of freelancers, games professionals, and volunteer coordinators, please take the leap and join us. </p>

                <p>First, <a href="http://www.paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online 2021</a> registration is currently open and game sign ups for players opens April 1st. On Monday, we’re updating our PaizoCon website with this year’s information, including the Paizo Twitch streaming schedule. This year also sees the return of the PaizoCon Puzzle Hunt for the 5th consecutive year. Join us May 28th-31st for four days of gaming, chatting, and exploring everything Paizo!</p> 
                <p>Second, while we are working toward population vaccination, there is not enough certainty around the timeline to proceed with an in-person PaizoCon UK this year. We’d like to thank Dave Harrison, PaizoCon UK coordinator, and his event team for thinking of the safety of the community this convention season. </p>

                <p>Fortunately, Dave is teaming up with Benoit Grȏs and the team that brought you PaizoCon Francia to offer PaizoCon Europe Online! Slated for August 19th-22nd, the game schedule will be centered around European time zones, but will also feature an overnight block of games aimed at America-based gamers. Need another reason to attend PaizoCon Europe Online? We are launching the new season and metaplot of the Pathfinder Society! We’ll have more information soon, including how to register as a player or GM.</p>

                <p>Wrapping up our 2021 PaizoCon offerings is PaizoCon South-Pacific, coordinated by Daniel Flood and his team. The date and location are still TBD, though we expect it to be a weekend in November and somewhere in the Sydney/Brisbane/Canberra region. We will pass information on to the community as soon as decisions are made so keep an eye on our blog for updates.</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <p>We look forward to seeing you at these upcoming PaizoCon events!</p>

                <p>A second survey is online, this time on which monsters should be included in the monsters’ expansion pack. Pathfinder Arena divides monsters into four tiers, one per each round of the game. The higher the round, the stronger the monsters. </p> 
                <p>The range of monsters eligible for the survey are: </p> 
                <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                 <li>Tier 1: Goblin Pyro (a group of 2-3 miniatures), Ghoul, Orc Warchief</li> 
                 <li>Tier 2: Cyclops, Harpy, Gargoyle</li> 
                 <li>Tier 3: Hobgoblin General, Nightmare, Fleshwarped Drow</li> 
                 <li>Tier 4: Lamia Matriarch, Onidoshi, Mummy Pharaoh</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>The most voted monsters of each tier will be included in the expansion pack.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Both in the office and in our works, Paizo honors the presence of women creators and professionals in our spaces. Today, we want to introduce you to a few of those fantastic staffers and freelancers that make our games amazing! Some submissions came from the women themselves, some from their friends and colleagues, and we are so very pleased to share them with you!</p> 
                <h3>Tineke Bolleman</h3> 
                <p>If you’ve ever been to PaizoCon, either online or in the flesh, you probably have a memory of a friendly conversation or late-night shenanigans with Tineke Bolleman. Tineke’s a longtime volunteer— she started in 2014 and became the Venture Captain of the Netherlands region in 2017, to be exact—and is a positive force for change, inclusion, and welcoming others into our shared spaces.<br> After years of serving our community as a volunteer, Tineke started freelancing for Paizo. She’s an author for Starfinder Society scenario’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya08w?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-116-Dreaming-of-the-Future">#1-16: Dreaming of the Future</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01va4?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-124-Siege-of-Enlightenment">#1-24:Siege of Enlightenment</a> as well as Pathfinder Society scenario’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0217l?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-105-Trailblazers-Bounty">#1-05: Trailblazers’ Bounty</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zi?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-203-Catastrophes-Spark">#2-03: Catastrophe’s Spark</a>. Her work has also been published by Rusted Iron Games, Wayfinder, Eyes Unclouded (a really neat setting based on Studio Ghibli’s works), and A Crystal Heart. On working with a few months ago on Starfinder Society <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026hp?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-315-Frozen-Ambitions-The-Preluria-Connection">#3-15: Frozen Ambitions: The Preluria Connection</a>, Starfinder Society Developer Jenny Jarzabski says, “I feel confident saying that she’s a rising star you should keep your eye on! Whether she’s writing adventures, roleplaying vesk in tiaras, or telling us all about weird animals, Tineke brings joy and laughter to our community. We’re lucky to have her!”<br> When asked, Tineke noted she is very proud of writing the Marixah Republic and the Gideron Authority in SFS 1-24 and Near Space and that she has written many favorite characters including the Chelaxian kids from Trailblazer’s Bounty, Amkha from Catastrophe’s Spark, and Kanavu from Dreaming of the Future. She also gave a honorable mention to Wilbert the Saint Bernard.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Linda Zayas-Palmer</h3> 
                <p>Linda participated in the Pathfinder Society as a player, then GM, then volunteer coordinator several years before she join the Paizo staff as a Pathfinder Society developer in spring 2015. Over the past six years, she’s help shepherd the Society through an edition change and several in-game world shattering events. As managing developer, she worked closely with the Lost Omens team of Eleanor and Luis in creating the Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide. Linda is known for her love of leshys, creating many of the creatures that appear in the Pathfinder RPG. Lesser known, but as loved, is venture-captain Armeline Jirneau, a reform-minded-member of the Envoy’s Alliance with a secret identity. First introduced in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9oij?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-806-Reaping-What-We-Sow">PFS 8-06: Reaping What We Sow</a>, Armeline’s part of a new generation of venture-captains. Readers can learn more about Armeline in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide">Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide</a>. </p>

                <h3>Hilary Moon Murphy</h3> 
                <p>Hilary Moon Murphy (aka Hmm) is a librarian, mom and a gamer chick. She's passionate about building community, and so has spent a lot of time as an Paizo Organized Play GM and volunteer. Writing for Paizo has been a ton of fun, and she always loves when she sees players using something cool that she wrote for either Starfinder or Pathfinder. Instead of talking more about herself in the third person though, she'd like to address all the other women who may be reading this blog and asking themselves the question: "Could I become a freelancer too?" So, here's the straight answer: if you're a female gamer, chances are you already know a lot about working hard, being creative and finding time for what's important. If you want to write, go for it! Submit to Wayfinder. Write for 3PP products. Get business cards. Contact Paizo developers at conventions and say, "I want to write for you" and hand them your business card. Do it and be awesome!</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Sara Marie</h3> 
                <p>While many of the women in this blog are from our editorial department, Sara Marie comes from the operations side of Paizo. Sara Marie started at Paizo over ten years ago, working her way up through the ranks of Customer Service to her current position of manager of the Customer Service and Community departments. This is a huge amount of effort, as not only does she lead one of the most public facing teams, but she also moderates the forums and is a staunch advocate of our play-by-post community. If you’ve ever travelled to PaizoCon or Gen Con, you most likely encountered her expertly directing activities in the registration queue or store. When she isn’t busy keeping the wheels turning, she loves crafts and exploring the beautiful outdoor landscape of the Pacific Northwest. Sara has also been learning about the interactions between businesses and local government, and how the community of tabletop roleplaying games here in Washington can continue to grow and thrive.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Jessica Redekop</h3> 
                <p>My name is Jessica Redekop and I'm a woman in tabletop gaming. I contributed to the recent <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide">Pathfinder Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3">Bestiary 3</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jf?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-216-Freedom-for-Wishes">PFS #2-16 Freedom for Wishes</a>. I was also a contributor to Lost Spheres Publishing's City of 7 Seraphs, and I play Xiadani on Know Direction's Valiant, an actual play podcast. I'm on twitter and Instagram as @tectonomancer.<br> I love RPGs and I am grateful to every person I've known on my journey into this industry, to the people I've played games with and to those who gave me a chance as a writer, who welcomed me into this hobby and made me feel like I belonged. I know how often women and enbies are turned away from gaming, heard the horror stories about convention experiences, and have had some of those horror story experiences myself. It's easy to imagine how differently I'd feel about RPGs with that kind of introduction to them. I'm grateful that didn't happen to me. </p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Tonya Woldridge</h3> 
                <p>Hello nufriends! My Paizo-adjacent journey started as a volunteer in England. I was venture officer of several places before joining the Paizo team as the Organized Play Coordinator in 2015. Though I joined a publishing company, I never thought of writing as a creative outlet. My goals focused on growing the organized play program, partly through making play spaces more inclusive so that everyone would want to participate. A couple years in, I wanted to understand more about the publishing side of our business. I mentioned this to Linda. She helped me secure an assignment and mentored me through the whole process. This help gave me the confidence to ask for another assignment, which led to me writing for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide">Pathfinder Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide</a>. While I’m not seeking a writing career, being part of the production of a book led to deeper insight and helps me be a more effective manager of the Organized Play program. <br> Between organized play and freelancing, I’ve met a host of fantastic people I love spending time with! To anyone thinking they want to join gaming communities, please do, we can’t wait to meet you! You can find me on Facebook (PaizoOrgPlay), Twitter (@PaizoOPM) and Discord (TonyaOPM#6396). I look forward to saying hi!</p>

                <h3>Ivis Flanagan</h3> 
                <p>Hi, I’m Ivis – one of Paizo’s newer freelancers, and OPF Venture Officer. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mu?Pathfinder-Bounty-8-The-Tireless-Path">Bounty 8: The Tireless Path</a> comes out at the end of this month. I also wrote part of quest pack <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0251a?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-311-Into-the-Veskarium">SFS 3-11 Into the Veskarium</a>, was released late last year, which was written and developed by a group that was all women or non-binary!<br> Marian Wright Edleman once said “you can’t be what you can’t see,” and it is a thought that comes full circle for me. I was taught as a kid that “girls can’t play RPGs” by the boys who ran them, and since I never saw anyone other than that core crew doing so, I took it to heart that they must be right. For years I stayed out of the tabletop space, believing that it wasn’t a place that I belonged. Then I found Paizo’s Organized Play, where for the first time I saw people that looked like me participating, and I felt like I could take part. <br> In my time in this space, I have met some incredible women. Many of them I have looked up to as mentors, and some I am even lucky enough to call friends. They have all encouraged me to move forward, to step into out and into my own, becoming confident in my abilities through the process. I have come from being very shy player, to a competent gm, and now to an author – getting to help build the worlds that I love for those that come after. My greatest hope in all of this is to be seen by someone else and help them step forward onto their own path. </p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Devinne Caples</h3> 
                <p>Devine joined us just over a year ago as our HR generalist. It was just before we transitioned to work from home. She moved into the office next to the Customer Service department. Sara Marie shared her experience of Devinne. “Often in the mornings, we would be arriving at the same time for work and get to catch up about work and life while I got a pot of coffee started for the day. Devinne has been a source of inspiration and camaraderie over the past year, checking in on me during some very rough spots, being a compassionate listener as I try to navigate my career as a parent and a woman. Devinne provided insight, advice, empathy, and so much knowledge. From my colleagues at here Paizo, I’ve heard so many similarly positive things about how she has been able to help and support them.”<br> Writing this out for this blog is bittersweet, as this March also marks the end of Devinne’s time at Paizo, as she had an absolutely wonderful opportunity come up elsewhere. Her new organization is lucky to have her, though she will be sorely missed here at Paizo. Congratulations Devinne! </p> `
                <p>These are just a few of the absolute rock stars involved in producing the games you love. If you get a chance, please let them know how much their contributions benefit your hobby! </p>

                <p>For over a century, a massive rift into the Abyss plagued Golarion--the Worldwound. Though this rift has finally closed, the people who are slowly reclaiming their ancestral land from demonic influence face all manner of corruption and chaos. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027je?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-215-A-Dirge-for-Sarkoris">A Dirge for Sarkoris</a>, by Kendra Leigh Speedling, Pathfinder agents come to the aid of their old allies in the Farheaven Clan, facing blight and death on their quest to retrieve the remains of the honored from desecrated burial sites. This adventure is written for levels 3–6.</p> 
                <p>Wishcrafting is fraught with both power and peril. The infamous genie-binder Corvius Vayn is now faced with the consequences of exploiting beings who wield this reality-warping magic. But wishcraft is rarely subtle, and what was supposed to be a party has now become a fantastical prison for Corvius and dozens of others. Explore the wonders and dangers of Vayn’s wishwarped manor in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jf?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-216-Freedom-for-Wishes">Freedom for Wishes</a>, a level 5–8 adventure by Jessica Redekop.</p>

                <p>Hi there, Starfinders! I’m sure most of you have heard the rumors by now, so I’m here to confirm it for you—the ysoki you all love to hate is back! Before the Society wrecked her plans, Datch planned multiple countermeasures in the event of failure, one of which threatens to massively disrupt AbadarCorp. In a rare act of repentance (or perhaps a bid to lessen her sentence), Datch directs a group of Starfinders to stop the disaster from happening! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jc?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-319-Rats-Repentance">Rat’s Repentance</a> is an adventure for PCs of levels 1–4 and is written by four amazing new authors: Lau Bannenberg, Dave Nelson, Shay Snow, and Drew Taylor.</p> 
                <p>We have an extra special treat planned for you this month, as well. Our first ever level 11–14 adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jd?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-320-Fleeting-Truth-Everchanging-Revelation">Fleeting Truth: Everchanging Revelation</a> also releases in March. Travel to the dangerous and mysterious planet Aucturn to retrieve the final data fragment before your Hellknight rivals can destroy it. I’m not saying there’s going to be eldritch horrors in this adventure, but it’s going to get pretty weird. Veteran author Cole Kronewitter did a fantastic job exploring Aucturn and you won’t want to miss this trip.</p>

                <h3>Divine Warden of Brigh</h3> 
                <p>Imbued with the divine energy of the goddess of clockwork and invention, divine wardens of Brigh are prominent in Alkenstar as guardians of the Temple of Brigh there. The Bronze Lady might have her largest following in this metropolis. But the city’s boomtown atmosphere means that security is a concern even on holy ground. Citizens and visitors to Alkenstar know about its wind-up sentries or quickly learn about them. The High Clockmother, head priestess of Brigh’s holy place, keeps divine wardens in the goddess's image visible in the sanctuary and on the grounds. These automatons are as much a warning to would-be thieves or troublemakers as they are an inspiration to Brigh’s worshippers. The mixing of divine and arcane in these constructs is intended to show off innovation and evoke Brigh’s power over earth, fire, metal, and smoke.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com//a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/604c096a-4527-421a-b7d3-776a1d72eb49/031921_DivineWarden.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/604c096a-4527-421a-b7d3-776a1d72eb49/031921_DivineWarden.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A clockwork woman covered in golden fillagree reaches into an opening in her chest to touch a glowing red gem."></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;">While divine wardens of Brigh can take any form, most are clockworks crafted in the goddess's image.<br>Illustration by Leonardo Borazio." </p> 
                <h4>Divine Warden of Brigh — Creature 10</h4> 
                <p><b>Uncommon N Medium Clockwork Construct Divine Mindless</b></p> 
                <p><b>Perception</b> +18; darkvision<br> <b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +18<br> <b>Str</b> +2, <b>Dex</b> +6, <b>Con</b> +4, <b>Int</b> –5, <b>Wis</b> +2, <b>Cha</b> –5<br> <b>Items</b> <em>clockwork wand</em></p> 
                <p><b>Wind-Up</b> For a divine warden of Brigh to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can’t act until it’s wound again. The divine warden shuts down immediately once it has 0 time remaining.<br> A divine warden can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn’t decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception). It can’t act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).<br> A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a divine warden down (DC 27). For each success, the warden loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the warden is in standby mode.</p> 
                <p><b>AC</b> 28; <b>Fort</b> +18, <b>Ref</b> +20, <b>Will</b> +18<br> <b>HP</b> 135; <b>Immunities</b> death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poisoned, sickened, unconscious; <b>Weaknesses</b> electricity 10, orichalcum 10; <b>Resistances</b> physical 5 (except adamantine or orichalcum)</p> 
                <p><b>Clockwork Wand</b> The divine warden uses a mechanical wand as a focus to channel magical energy. This wand is built into the divine warden’s chest, with only the crystal at the end exposed. The warden can Interact to remove the wand, or someone else can remove it with a DC 32 Thievery check to Disable a Device. The divine warden becomes unable to cast any spells except cantrips while the wand is removed.<br> When removed, the <em>clockwork wand</em> is a <em>magic wand</em> containing the last 2nd-level innate spell the divine warden cast (the GM determines the spell randomly if the divine warden has not cast any eligible spells). The spells are placed within the wand while the divine warden is created, and the creator can substitute other arcane spells of the appropriate level.</p> 
                <p><b>Divine Destruction</b> (divine, necromancy) When the divine warden is reduced to 0 HP, it erupts with divine energy in a 30-foot emanation, dealing 10d6 positive damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 29 Will save with the following outcomes.<br> <b>Critical Success</b> The creature takes half damage.<br> <b>Success</b> The creature takes full damage.<br> <b>Failure</b> The creature takes full damage and becomes temporarily cursed by Brigh to be enfeebled 1 and stupefied 1 for 1 day; this is a curse effect with a counteract DC of 29.<br> <b>Critical Failure</b> As failure, except the creature becomes enfeebled 2 and stupefied 2.</p> 
                <p><b>Faith Bound</b> (abjuration, divine) The divine warden can’t attack a creature that openly wears or displays Brigh’s religious symbol unless that creature uses a hostile action against the divine warden first.</p> 
                <p>Speed 25 feet</p> 
                <p><b>Melee [one-action]</b> fist +20 (agile, finesse), <b>Damage</b> 2d10+6 bludgeoning</p> 
                <p><b>Melee [one-action]</b> light hammer +20 (agile), <b>Damage</b> 2d6+6 bludgeoning</p> 
                <p><b>Ranged [one-action]</b> light hammer +20 (agile, thrown 20 feet), <b>Damage</b>2d6+6 bludgeoning</p> 
                <p><b>Arcane Innate Spells</b> DC 29, attack +21; <b>5th</b> <em>cloudkill, cone of cold</em>; <b>4th</b> <em>dimensional anchor, fly, wall of fire</em>; <b>3rd</b> <em>haste, invisibility, stinking cloud</em>; <b>2nd</b> <em>glitterdust, obscuring mist, web</em>; <b>1st</b> <em>feather fall, floating disk, grease</em>; <b>Cantrips (5th)</b> daze, detect magic, ray of frost, shield, tanglefoot</p> 
                <p><b>Divine Innate Spells</b> DC 29; <b>Cantrips (5th)</b> daze</p> 
                <p><b>Divine Domain Spells</b> 2 Focus Points, DC 29, attack +21; 5th hurtling stone, localized quake</p> 
                <p><b>Energize Clockwork Wand [one-action]</b> (concentrate) <b>Frequency</b> once per 10 minutes; <b>Effect</b> The divine warden regains a spell it has already cast that day. It must spend 1 hour of its operational time, or 2 hours if the spell is 3rd level or higher.</p> 
                <p><b>Faithful Weapon</b> light hammer, <em>striking</em> rune</p> 
                <p><b>Instrument of Faith</b> The divine warden is a beacon for Brigh’s faith. A cleric of Brigh can channel a <em>heal</em> spell through a divine warden of Brigh they can see within 60 feet. The cleric determines any targets or area for the spell as if they were standing in the divine warden’s space.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Last week, we revealed the title for Year 4 of Starfinder Society: <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shlp?Introducing-Starfinder-Society-Year-4">Year of the Data Scourge</a>. This week, we wanted to talk a little bit more about what we’re doing to kick off the season.</p> 
                <p>One of our most common pieces of feedback from players and GMs is that it can be tough to figure out where to start new players. Do they play the most recent low-level scenario released? The first one of the season? Start at the beginning with 1-01 <em>The Commencement</em>? In an effort to make it easier for everyone, as well as refresh some of our older program pieces, we’re releasing a three-part Intro series at <a href="http://www.paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online</a>. I’ll let Jenny talk a bit about what’s in each Intro scenario now.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bc1b66da-9164-4eb6-8461-fa1df82f4c36/031821_Celita.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bc1b66da-9164-4eb6-8461-fa1df82f4c36/031821_Celita.png" align="left" width="300" hspace="5" alt="Celita, a blue haired android in a long black jacket holding a datapad"></a>

              <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027nd"><em>Starfinder Society Introduction #1: The First Test</em></a> is an introduction to the Starfinder Society for characters of levels 1-2. Brand new players (and GMs!) can learn what the Society is all about, as well as experiencing a variety of common encounters found in Starfinder Society adventures, by playing this scenario. The best part is that this adventure incorporates repeatable elements so that the same players can experience the fun again with a different character, making this an evergreen scenario to incorporate into your game days and conventions. This adventure is written by Paizo’s own Jason Keeley!</p> 
              <p>After players have an introduction to the campaign with Intro #1, they are encouraged to play <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ne"><em>Starfinder Society Introduction #2: For the Factions</em></a>. This adventure introduces the four major factions (Acquisitives, Dataphiles, Exo-Guardians, and Wayfinders) to players and GMs. In this adventure, the PCs complete a short mission for each faction and are encouraged to choose a faction they’re interested in working with at the end. This adventure is structured similarly to our classic Starfinder Society #1-01: The Commencement, but is full of exciting new content to tempt our veteran Starfinders as well as new players! This adventure is also for characters of levels 1-2, and was written by fan favorite freelancer Kate Baker. </p> 
              <p>Finally, get a taste of Year 4 by playing <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027nf"><em>Starfinder Society Introduction #3:Year of the Data Scourge</em></a> (also known as SFS 4-01). This scenario follows a team of Starfinders returning to the Society hub on Absalom Station when a series of digital attacks rocks the Pact Worlds. Play as a Starfinder battling their way across a dangerously glitching Absalom Station in search of answers, and find out what the Data Scourge event is all about! This scenario is written by yours truly, Starfinder Society Developer Jenny Jarzabski, and I promise it’ll be a great time. </p>

              <p>This three-part repeatable Intro arc will get a new character up to second level and allow them to learn about the Society and the current storyline through play. While Intro #1 and #2 are intended to anchor this arc for the foreseeable future, we plan to swap Intro #3 out every year with the first scenario of the new season, to introduce all players to the new season’s metaplot.</p> 
              <p>We hope everyone finds these scenarios both exciting and useful! They will launch at <a href="http://paizocon.com/">PaizoCon Online</a> at the end of May along with two new Pathfinder Society scenarios and the final Pathfinder Adventure Card Society special. We can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been cooking up! </p> 
              <p>Don’t forget to set reminders to join the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/">Know Direction Network</a> on March 24th as they chat with Linda and Alex about PaizoCon Online and info on our Organized Play Programs. If you missed Jenny’s interview on Know Direction, it will be uploaded soon!</p> 
              <p>Come back next week for a preview of this month’s new releases. Until then - Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

               <h3>Calder CaDavid</h3> 
               <p>Hello, Calder here! I was thrilled to write for some of my favorite ancestries – aasimar and orcs in <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. I’ve been a freelancing TTRPG writer for a little over two years and loving every moment. I’ve written for previous Lost Omens books, the PFS adventure (1-22) <em>The Doom of Cassomir</em> and several adventures for the subscription service Dungeon in a Box. I hosted and ran the actual-play and GM discussion podcast Mythos Manual, which post-modern plague may actually get back to. I work in television production and live in Los Angeles with my cat, dog and fiancé. Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/CaDavidCalder" target="_blank">@CaDavidCalder</a>. Enjoy more Lost Omens goodness!</p>

               <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> 
               <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica Catalan and I wrote androids and azarketi for <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. I’ve been freelancing for Paizo’s Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs for nearly two years. In that time I’ve contributed to twenty three projects for Paizo (and counting!), including <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, <em>Alien Archive 4</em>, five Organized Play scenarios, and a variety of other products that will release over the next year or so. In between freelancing and parenting, I occasionally find time to update <e href="http://d20diaries.com/" target="_blank">
                 d20diaries.com, a personal blog focusing on my family’s experiences in gaming. For a full list of my announced TTRPG credits, visit

               <h3>Lyz Liddell</h3> Hey, everyone! I’m Lyz Liddell, <a href="https://twitter.com/lyzmaytweet/status/1296135733208465408?s=20" target="_blank">former</a> designer and editor for Pathfinder, back on the job to nurture my beautiful goth children: dhampirs! When I created this versatile lineage for the Advanced Player’s Guide, there was so much more we wanted to do than we had space for, so it was a delight to put those ideas into action for the Lost Omens Ancestry Guide. Dhampirs in fiction bear an unfortunate and long-held association with violence and loss, but I wanted to break those assumptions in Pathfinder so you have the freedom to tell any stories you want with these physically, socially, and emotionally complex characters. I hope you enjoy them!

               <h3>Ron Lundeen</h3> 
               <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, a developer on the Pathfinder Adventure Path line here at Paizo. I really wanted to write up the fleshwarps for this book, because they could be tentacled and gross. I initially thought of them only as grotesque creations for players who want to be a monster (which their ancestry feats really reflect), but as I thought about fleshwarps' place in the world, I realized that even these physically distinct people would have conventions, hopes, goals, and self-images of their own. Incorporating these thoughts made them a much deeper and more flavorful ancestry. With a fleshwarp, you can still "just be the monster," or you can explore what it means to have a shockingly inhuman appearance in a world of wonders and terrors. Plus, Gaping Flesh is maybe my favorite feat I've ever written.

               <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> 
               <p>Hello from the US Southwest! I'm Andrew Mullen, who you might know from Old-Mage Jatembe's section of Lost Omens Legends and xulgath culture in the Extinction Curse Adventure Path. For Lost Omens Ancestry Guide, I worked on fetchlings and aphorites. I've always liked shadows' place in fantasy, but as someone who doesn't play much with the chaos/law axis, aphorites were a new challenge. I quite enjoyed thinking through what it means to have an intrinsic connection to order!<br> Ancestries aside, and assuming this blog presents authors in alphabetical order by last name, I'm going to scoop Mikhail's bit - we're working on a third-party project!<br> Was the world plunged into darkness because the prior civilization exsanguinated god to death, and when his eyes closed the stars went out? Was it because the wreckage of the gods' civil war blotted out the sky? In <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em>, there's no certain answer: this truth is a matter of faith. The Luminant Age is a Weird Fantasy world with a robust, nuanced take on fictional culture. But that level of detail doesn't mean an impenetrable mess of lore! We want players to be able to dive right into a game, even one that takes into account the power struggles and intrigues of a technological renaissance fueled by god's blood.<br> Oh, and we've got vampire anteater dogs and flying rays with gardens on their backs! Adorable!<br> Keep an eye on our Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a> - there's strange stuff on the horizon! </p>

               <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
               <p>Здравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! (Hello, dear readers!) My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may remember me from <em>Lost Omen Legends</em> (Baba Yaga) PFS 1-15 <em>Blooming Catastrophe</em>, and PFS 2-8 Frosty Mug, amongst a great deal of other writing. In my significantly more boring daily existence, I’m a Russian-American historian and educator, presently working in China.<br> In <em>LOAG</em>, I wrote the entries for the tieflings and the duskwalkers. Duskwalkers and I go way back—my very first assignment for Paizo was writing Duskwalker feats for the <em>Plane-Hopper’s Handbook</em>, and my first ‘big’ Paizo assignment was the <em>Half-Dead</em> backmatter in AP139 <em>The Dead Roads</em>.<br> Here and today, though, I want to mention a new project I’m working on, a bit outside of the Paizo umbrella. <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> is an upcoming third-party setting for Pathfinder Second Edition, a Weird Fantasy Swashbuckler set in a world without stars, where players will have a chance to set the course of history—or maybe just get run over by it, as the case may be.<br> It’s still early days, but we have a Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a> and plans for some fun stuff in the near future.<br> Досвидания! (Goodbye!)</p>

               <h3>David N. Ross</h3> 
               <p>I'm something of a jack-of-all-trades freelance writer and developer peddling novel rules, vibrant settings, and intrigue-laced adventures. This book is also a major milestone for me: my 50th contribution to Paizo's catalog! Although I'm best-known as a writer for Paizo's various lines, I also develop rules and write new content for other clients including Petersen Games, Raging Swan Press, AAW Games, Legendary Games, and a dozen more using rules for Pathfinder (both editions), Starfinder, and D&amp;D. This time, I'm excited to revisit catfolk and provide them with some new tricks! I previously wrote some of their <em>Inner sea Races</em> mechanics in first edition and helped flesh out their lore in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #152: Legacy of the Lost God</em>. My next major release will be my first Adventure Path installment, "Ready? Fight!" which comes out in May.

               <p>I'm Mark Seifter, Paizo's design manager and one of the four leads on the creation of Pathfinder Second Edition.<br> In Lost <em>Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, I created the sprites. I'm a big fan of fey, and I wanted to express that in this section. Plus, since I was also working on Bestiary 3, I was able to coordinate adding three brand new types of sprites in both books, as heritages and new creatures: Thanks to the creativity of Eleanor and Luis, we came up with draxie (dragon sprites), melixies (insect sprites, often bees), and nyktera (bat sprites)!<br> Check out my twitch stream with Linda Zayas-Palmer, Arcane Mark, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7PM Pacific, and Saturdays at 10 AM Pacific at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/arcanemark" target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/arcanemark</a>.

               <p>Our brand new company, Digital Dragon Studios, is dedicated to making apps that gamers love, and our very first offering is the Combat Tracker App for Pathfinder Second Edition. It’s all the goodness of the Pathfinder Combat Pad in a fantastic pocket-friendly app for you and your party to use everywhere you go. </p> 
               <p>We’ve done our best to ensure the app is as useful as it can be with features such as online play for long distance games, condition tracking, and Bluetooth connectivity for those times when the internet just isn’t an option. The app was created so that users from across the room or across the world can login together, see combat order, and hear the alert when combat advances. It can also be used solo by manually entering players in the Game Master Control Panel. Even better, both Android and Apple users can track combat together! </p> 
               <p>The Pathfinder Second Edition Combat Tracker app is currently available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pathfinder-2e-combat-tracker/id1553689267">Apple</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitaldragonstudios.rpgcombattracker">Google Play</a> stores, and you can keep up with current news regarding updates and future apps by following us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Digital-Dragon-Studios-100888535406058">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalDragonS3">Twitter</a>.</p>

             <p>We are excited to return to a traditional metaplot for Starfinder Society Year 4. Scenarios that directly influence the Data Scourge metaplot will be marked with a special image. Scenarios without this branding are stand-alone adventures that do not tie into the events of Year of the Data Scourge. The metaplot kicks off with a scenario titled, appropriately, Year of the Data Scourge, written by yours truly, Jenny Jarzabski. If you have a PC in the levels 1-4 range and you’re ready to find out what this new season is all about, make sure you don’t miss this one! And if you don’t have a character made yet, what are you waiting for?!</p> 
             <p>In addition to our campaign’s new season, we’re pleased to announce that the Society’s efforts detailed in the Vast Experiment series have finally paid off! Starting in Year 4, Starfinders can choose to take the Society’s newest ship, the <b>Azata</b>, for a spin on their missions! </p>

              <blockquote> 
               <center>
                <p><b>Chapter One</b></p>
               </center> 
               <center>
                <h2>DOWN AND OUT</h2>
               </center> 
               <p>Misree crawled out of an air duct and looked around the hangar bay, one of the cheapest and most cluttered on Absalom Station. She crouched behind a pile of spent energy cells and listened past the hiss of leaking hydraulic lines and the clang of someone banging on a bolt for anything that sounded... worrisome. Like, say, snippets of conversation between enforcers bent on capturing her. She didn’t pick up anything alarming.</p> 
               <p>There were two dozen ships in the bay, arrayed in uneven lines, from little one-person runabouts to bulky cargo vessels, and her own swift courier, the <em>Up and Out</em>, was way in the back, closest to the exit, just where she liked it. This was the kind of hangar where you had to pay your docking fees up front, so there was nothing stopping her from jumping on board, spinning up the engines, and racing out of here. Sure, coming back to the station without getting murdered on arrival would be tricky, but once she got her hands on some credits, she'd make paying back Zephonith her first—second—at least <em>third</em>—priority. In Misree's experience, enough credits could smooth over just about any difficulty. It was just a shame she always had more difficulties than credits lately.</p> 
               <p>Once she was confident the way was clear, Misree ran across the hangar toward her ship... and was within steps of the boarding ramp when a vesk shimmered out of some kind of stealth field and stood in her way, holding an immense wrench casually in one clawed hand. </p> 
               <p>Misree stopped short, very nearly colliding with the vesk, which would have made a bad situation even worse. She looked up (and up, and up) into the reptilian smile. The vesk was easily seven feet tall, while Misree was on the short side for a human. "Smeliel! I was just looking for you."</p> 
               <p>"Isn't that lucky," the vesk enforcer rumbled. "I was looking for you, too." She rapped the nose of the <em>Up and Out</em> with her wrench. "You weren't going to leave, were you? You have an appointment with our mutual employer, and I’m sure you don’t plan to keep her waiting."</p> 
               <p>Misree's smile slipped. "I don't work for Zephonith." Misree didn't work for anyone anymore. She charted her own course, made her own choices, and didn't have to answer to anyone—or answer for them, either. Flying solo was better in every way. Though it did mean, at times like this, that nobody had her back. </p> 
               <p>"Zephonith owns you, though." Smeliel crouched, bringing her closer to Misree's eye level. "Until you pay what's owed."</p> 
               <p>Misree had borrowed heavily from Zephonith to finance a heist, outfitting the <em>Up and Out</em> with the latest infiltration, stealth, and combat tech, all part of a plan to rob the orbital pleasure palace of a lashunta oligarch... but it turned out her contact sold the same security system plans and station blueprints to <em>another</em> crew: one that managed to strike a lot faster. The prize was stolen from Misree, which meant she didn’t have the capital to repay her loan, or even keep up with the eye-watering interest. "I'm going to pay,” Misree said. “In fact, I was just going out to scout a new job, so I’d have good news for Zephonith at our meeting."</p>&nbsp; 
               <p>Smeliel turned her head and looked at the ship. "You've got everything you need on here, don't you?" Her voice was full of undisguised admiration. "I had a word with the engineers you hired. The <em>Up and Out</em> is a custom-built flying crime spree. Seems a shame to leave it in such.... ineffectual hands."</p> 
               <p>Misree's guts went cold. "Smeliel, no, you can't—"</p> 
               <p>"Half the value of that vessel comes from upgrades you made with Zeph's money," the Vesk said, as if idly musing. "The other half... should pretty much cover the interest, plus a gratuity to thank my employer for not tossing you out an airlock for trying to run away today. In which case, you can just transfer the title, and we’re done." </p> 
               <p>Misree gritted her teeth. "You can't take my ship. She's all I've got. I poured my life into the <em>Up and Out</em>—"</p> 
               <p>Smeliel clamped an immense clawed hand on Misree's shoulder. "Then don't make me pour your life out all over this hangar deck."</p> 
               <p>Did you always want to be a hired thug? Was this your childhood dream? Beating people up for a crime boss?" Misree winced at herself. Sometimes her thoughts slipped out of her mouth before she could stop them. </p> 
               <p>"I'm a poet, actually," Smeliel said, grinding down on Misree’s shoulder. "That's why I left home, originally—my family didn't understand my dreams. But poetry doesn't pay very well. Not compared to enforcing the interests of a local entrepreneur. Sometimes you need a night job. I will say, doing this kind of work?" She showed all her serrated, triangular teeth. "It does give me a great deal of insight into the sapient condition, and that's helpful in my art. Maybe I'll write something about you—'An Ode to Misery.'"</p> 
               <p>"I've never heard a joke like <em>that</em> before," Misree said. "Can I at least get my stuff?"</p> 
               <p>"You don't have any stuff," Smeliel said. "You walk away with your life. And that deal is only good for the next minute or so. Transfer the title <em>now</em>."</p> 
               <p>Misree looked wistfully at the <em>Up and Out</em>—her home, her livelihood, and practically her only friend. But you had to know when to let things go, and “two seconds before a vesk enforcer splits your head open with a wrench” was an excellent time to do so. She tapped a command into her wrist-mounted computer and gave up her one true love.</p> 
               <p>Smeliel looked at a readout on her own datapad, grunted, and said, “Good choice. I hate getting blood all over my good wrench.” She made a shooing gesture. “I'd say 'Don't let me see you on this station again,' but since it's a big place, and you don't have access to a vehicle anymore, I'll settle for saying, 'Stay out of Zephonith's club.'"</p> 
               <p>“The drinks are overpriced anyway,” Misree muttered. </p> 
               <p>“True,” Smeliel said. “You couldn’t afford the cover charge anyway, now that I think about it. Stop loitering around my ship.”</p> 
               <p>Misree trudged out of the hangar. At least she didn’t have to sneak through air ducts and service tunnels anymore. She reviewed her assets. She still had a day left on the rental for the sleep-pod where she'd been hiding out from Zephonith. She had a change of clothes in the bag strapped to her back, an ultrathin switchblade in her pocket, and a few credsticks squirreled away here and there on the station—she'd learned early in life not to keep everything of value in one place. </p> 
               <p>That was the totality of her net worth, though, and it wasn’t enough to finance any kind of comeback or fresh start. Ugh. Would she be reduced to running short cons on tourists in bars? Or worse, rolling drunks and emptying their pockets? She’d never been into strongarm robbery, and it was a dangerous proposition. She knew a guy who’d mugged a defenseless-looking human who’d turned out to have an integrated cutting torch hidden in a cybernetic arm, and everybody called the mugger “Cyclops” now because he only had one eye left. But even robbery was a better option than hiring herself out to one of Zephonith's competitors, which was her only other plausible path to financial security. It was pretty easy to get a job with a crime boss when you had the kind of skills and résumé Misree did... but it was really hard to quit that job if you ever wanted to move on.</p> 
               <p>She turned onto a crowded thoroughfare, through a gray-market bazaar that filled a hub where three corridors intersected. She headed down an alley that led to her sleeping pod, one of two dozen stacked cubbyholes, each just barely big enough to sleep in. At least her pod was on the bottom level, so she didn’t have to climb a rickety ladder to reach—</p> 
               <p>Misree froze. The door to her cubby was ajar. In theory it was biometrically locked to her for the duration of her rental, but there were ways to spoof the locks, or you could always just bribe the manager. Who was inside? Another of Zephonith’s enforcers, one who hadn’t been called off yet? </p> 
               <p>She crouched beside an overflowing trash bin and watched her door swing all the way open. An android stepped out of her room—ebony skinned with a shining bald head of some silver alloy and bright yellow eyes, wearing a slick black overcoat. </p> 
               <p>Zephinoth never employed androids; Misree didn’t know why, but she assumed she’d been wronged by one too many androids on her climb up the crime boss career ladder. Which meant... this was some <em>other</em> kind of trouble.</p> 
               <p>The android turned his head, his stoic yellow eyes fixing immediately on her. “Misree Ludovic! I’ve been looking for you!”</p> 
               <p>Misree ran.</p>

              <p>The bonanza will be the last published Society adventure for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. From May, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society will join the Pathfinder Society (first edition) as a legacy program still available for convention support, but for which we will no longer produce new content. All scenarios will remain available for play and we will publish one last Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Game in early May which will include blog items such as adventure packs as well as a few rules revisions. Players may still report games on paizo.com and tables of Pathfinder Adventure Card Society will still count towards table limits for convention support.</p>

              <p>And now some Q&amp;A…</p> 
              <p><b>Will Paizo One-Shots be available as a subscription or in print?</b> We don’t have any plans to offer these adventures as a subscription or print product. </p> 
              <p><b>Will these be available on virtual tabletops?</b> With the high-resolution maps and image handouts included these should be easy to add to your favorite virtual tabletop. <a href="https://www.fantasygrounds.com/store/?sys=24">Fantasy Grounds</a> plans to have these available today, with other partners working on making these available natively on their platforms. Make sure to check in with your favorite VTT for an update. </p> 
              <p><b>Will these One-Shots be sanctioned by Organized Play?</b> Indeed they will be; in fact, you can download the sanctioning documents for Sundered Waves <a href="https://paizo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/OP-Sanctioning/Sundered+Waves+Sanctioning.pdf">right here</a>! We are adding the May releases to the PaizoCon schedule.</p> 
              <p>In celebration of this new release, Pathfinder Society Organized Play will be running a special Double Points weekend for Sundered Waves! All sessions of Sundered Waves run this weekend, <b>March 12-14</b>, will earn double the Achievement Points (8 points for players, 16 for GMs). Games must be reported by 9am Pacific on Wednesday, March 17; any games reported after that will not earn double points. Play-by-post games which begin during the weekend will also qualify; those GMs should email organizedplay@paizo.com after their games conclude and are reported to earn the additional rewards.</p>

              <h3>Botanical Wardens — CR 8</h3> 
              <p>A group of kiirintas (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026jv?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-4"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em></a> 62) botanists on Stabrisis-14 are creating an interstellar botanical garden, featuring plant species from all across Near Space. Leading this program is a headstrong kiirinta named K’voo za Vivza, whose ambitious nature and tendency to overreach has upset the Builders of the K’voo tribe.</p> 
              <p>When a shepherd blossom, a rare species of harpy jasmine from Castrovel, started exerting control over other plant creatures in the garden, Vivza was at a loss as to how to proceed. Her requests for aid have been ignored by the Builders, and the other Reflectors of the K’voo tribe aren’t equipped for such an aggressive task. The shepherd blossom has moved deep within the botanical garden and is using a small cadre of carnivorous plant to defend itself against all intruders. Vivza turns to the PCs for help, hoping they can end the shepherd blossom’s control over the other plant creatures, but desperately hopes that they can preserve the other plants in the area. She hopes that by disrupting the shepherd blossom, the other plant creatures will cease to be hostile and can be guided back to their portions of the garden.</p> 
              <p><b>Creatures</b>: A single mature shepherd blossom has gathered other aggressive plant creatures around itself, intending to keep them there until it is ready to pollinate the area with fresh buds. It has managed to gather two lumocanthas from the Veskarium Gardens exhibit and a single supenga pup from the nearby Desert Garden enclosure. While the resulting bloom of several shepherd blossoms might be interesting, it would cause enough chaos in Vivza’s Near Space botanical garden project to shut it down permanently. The supenga pup stays near the shepherd blossom, ready to pursue any threats while the two lumocanthas stand near the hiking trails nearby, ready to fire their laser spines on anything that moves.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84f193d0-f47e-4c98-b7f6-da6a991d50d5/030521_SheperdBlossom.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84f193d0-f47e-4c98-b7f6-da6a991d50d5/030521_SheperdBlossom.jpg" align="left" width="50%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A large, bulbous pink plant resembling the maw of a vicious predator"></a>

However, it continuously searches for more plant creatures to help protect itself during its reproductive cycle.<br> <b>During Combat</b> The shepherd blossom uses verdant call on any plant creatures not under their control, otherwise they uses their magic to ward off powerful creatures or befriend them and convince them to care for their offspring.<br> <b>Morale</b> The shepherd blossom protects its young buds until death.</p>

              <p><b>Special Abilities</b><br> <b>Verdant Call (Su)</b> Once per day as a full-round action, a shepherd blossom can create psychic echoes that resonate with nearby plant creatures, creating an intense feeling of empathy for the shepherd blossom. This functions as a 5th-level <em>dominate person</em> spell (CL 5th, Will DC 15) but only affects plant creatures. The shepherd blossom can target any single plant creature it is aware of within 600 feet.</p>

              <br> <b>During Combat</b> The lumocanthas focus their laser spines on any creature stained by one of their dye capsules, otherwise they fire on the closest non-plant that has moved from their square in the last round.
              <br> <b>Morale</b> These plants fight until destroyed as long as the shepherd blossom lives. As soon as the shepherd blossom is destroyed, or if the lumocanthas are otherwise moved out of the range of its verdant call, they become docile.

              <p itemprop="description">I really believe we are caught in a time loop. I am absolutely certain I wrote my February musings last week. The past month’s flurry of activity involved much planning - we are just a week away from revealing information regarding Starfinder Society Year 4, and we’ve mapped a solid plan for Pathfinder Society Year 3. PaizoCon planning is moving forward, which means convention season is well under way, and we’ve got a few upcoming announcements on that front. In addition, we’re talking to our pals at Know Direction about appearing on their show. Plus a few more still undisclosed projects that we hope to share shortly! </p> 
              <p>Be sure to keep your eyes on the blogs as March will bring many announcements and I don’t want any of our community members to miss the great information we have to share. </p> 
              <h2>PaizoCon Volunteers</h2> 
              <p>The first day of GM signups saw over 90% of our offered games filled. Plan is to add more games on the Warhorn, then do round 2 of signups. We will continue until we run out of GMs. Last year, we ran over 800 games. Let’s see if we can top that this year! Anyone who wants to join the GM or HQ teams should visit the <a jref="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/popvo/">Organized Play Foundation’s website</a> for volunteer benefit information and to access the registration form. From there, the organizing committee reviews the form information and sends an email acceptance outlining the next steps. If you want to participate in wave two of registrations, be sure to complete the form by noon Friday, March 5th. There is no last day to volunteer, but spaces are filled on a first registered basis and GMs get access to player registration 24 hours early (March 31) alongside Warhorn VIPs.</p> 
              <p>Anyone wanting to play at PaizoCon can register for badges in advance of the April 1st player signup date; to do so, visit the <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-2021">PaizoCon Warhorn</a> and follow the instructions on the main page.</p> 
              <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
              <p>Last week, we posted <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shla?February-Sanctioning-Update-Lost-Omens">an update on our sanctioning progress</a>, and we already have an update to that post. Bestiary 2 is now sanctioned on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options</a> page and is available to use! It joins the <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, <em>The Slithering</em> and all our previous rulebooks as usable Pathfinder Society material. Our next focus is <em>Bestiary 3</em> as well as the <em>Abomination Vaults</em> Adventure Path.</p> 
              <p>We’ve got new Character Options pages for Starfinder Society in the works to replace the current pdf Additional Resources document. When that rolls out (maybe even this month, if everything aligns), it will include new sanctioning for <em>Alien Archive 4</em>. After that, we’ll look to catch up with the <em>Devastation Ark</em> and <em>Fly Free or Die</em> Adventure Paths as well as investigate sanctioning the Starfinder Beginner Box.</p> 
              <p>On the Pathfinder (first edition) front. Our hope is to produce sanctioning documents out for the remaining content by the end of the summer, but that will depend on available time as convention season ramps up.</p> 
              <h2>GM Achievements</h2> 
              <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
              <p>Two GMs received their fifth nova in the past month. We have no new 5 Star or 5 Glyph GMs to announce.</p> 
              <p><b>5th Nova</b>: <em>John Godek</em> and <em>Nils Janson</em></p> 
              <p>Congratulations to our new 5 Nova GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com</p> 
              <h2>Conventions</h2> 
              <p>In addition to PaizoCon Online, we have a number of conventions offering Pathfinder and Starfinder Society! </p>
