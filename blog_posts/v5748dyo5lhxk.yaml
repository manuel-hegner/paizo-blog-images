  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Of all the\
  \ questions we get asked about the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game</a>, one gets asked most often. It first showed up when we\
  \ were coming close to releasing the last adventure in <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>,\
  \ \"Are you making any adventures for my characters who completed <em>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</em>?\"</p> \n     <p>And Vic said, <a href=\"/threads/rzs2r9wf\">\"\
  There are no immediate plans for an official set where you can use your characters\
  \ that have completed an AP.\"</a></p> \n     <p>Then we got asked it again as we\
  \ came close to completing <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>. \"Are you making any adventures\
  \ for my characters who completed <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>?\"</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ Vic said, <a href=\"/threads/rzs2rvz5&amp;page=2?Questions-wed-like-to-ask-the-designers-about#67\"\
  >\"There are currently no plans for additional content for characters that have\
  \ completed an Adventure Path.\"</a></p> \n     <p>And for the most part, that was\
  \ true. But I said, as quietly as I could, so no one could hear, \"Okay, but I <i>might</i>\
  \ have some plans.\" In fact, it was...</p> \n     <h2>A Cunning Plan That Cannot\
  \ Fail</h2> \n     <p>My plan was for my design team to do some shenanigans with\
  \ the power curve on <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>. Developer Chad Brown talks\
  \ a lot about it in <a href=\"/blog/v5748dyo5lhm4\">this blog on power curves</a>.\
  \ They have different curves: <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> is character-linear\
  \ and difficulty-parabolic, while <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em> is difficulty-linear\
  \ and character-parabolic. But both of them end in roughly the same place: a character\
  \ who can go toe-to-toe with Karzoug the Claimer has a roughly similar chance against\
  \ the Hurricane King. When you complete adventure 6 in either of those APs, you\
  \ are a mighty hero indeed.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9077-Baphomet.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9077-Baphomet_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br><i>Illustration by Ekaterina Burmak</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ thing is, those sets couldn't just keep climbing, because they had maxed out their\
  \ story progression. There wasn't anything more we could add to the cards in those\
  \ sets other than more dice and higher difficulties, and eventually, that would\
  \ be unsatisfying. Sure, it's fun to roll 12 dice once in a while, but if you're\
  \ doing it on every turn, the high will soon mellow out.</p> \n     <p>You would\
  \ need something else to build a spike in difficulty beyond where we were at the\
  \ end of those APs. Thankfully, <em>Wrath</em> had \"something else\" in spades.\
  \ It had cohorts, it had a d20, and it had Corrupted cards. All of those tweaked\
  \ the power level without increasing the number of dice rolled. (You may notice\
  \ I left something off that list. We'll get to that.)</p> \n     <p>And as we designed\
  \ it, we realized that <em>Wrath</em> is a perfect place to bring your conquering\
  \ heroes from the first two adventure paths, maybe using some of that nifty loot\
  \ you got from completing those final adventures. You just need a few small tricks\
  \ and a whole lot of gumption.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9076-DemonicAssassination.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9076-DemonicAssassination_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br><i>Illustration by Diego de Almeida</i>\n     </div> \n     <h2>How\
  \ to Use Wrath as \"Adventure 7\"</h2> \n     <p>First, finish another Adventure\
  \ Path, whether it's <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>,\
  \ <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season0\">Season of the Shackles</a>, or one of the\
  \ many homebrews. Record the state of your character on your downloadable character\
  \ sheet, if you like. If you haven't finished an AP, go to the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2r81m\"\
  >Conquering Heroes</a> thread or the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2s3bd\">Conquering Pirates</a>\
  \ thread and copy some of the ones you find there.</p> \n     <p>That's what we\
  \ did, anyway. We grabbed Hawkmoon269's <a href=\"/threads/rzs2r81m?Rise-of-the-Runelords-We-Need-A-Snapshot-of#2\"\
  >Ezren</a>, Aolhelm's <a href=\"/threads/rzs2r81m&amp;page=2?Rise-of-the-Runelords-We-Need-A-Snapshot-of#51\"\
  >Kyra</a>, and isaic16's <a href=\"/threads/rzs2s3bd?Skull-Shackles-We-Need-a-Snapshot-of-Your#13\"\
  >Merisiel</a> and <a href=\"/threads/rzs2r81m?Rise-of-the-Runelords-We-Need-A-Snapshot-of#8\"\
  >Seelah</a>. (Check out that not-so-paladinly weapons list!) Note that these were\
  \ not optimized characters: Merisiel has some items that only work in <em>Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles</em>, Ezren has a Divine spell, and so on. Where there was only\
  \ one of something, we replaced it. (I particularly liked swapping the angel Ayruzi\
  \ out for the demon Zuvuzeg on Seelah's list.) Otherwise, they went in as-is.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Second, get the <i><a href=\"/products/btpy9a46\">Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ Base Set</a></i> and adventures <a href=\"/products/btpy9b9r\">2</a>, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9bs3\">3</a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu8\">4</a>, plus the <i><a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9a47\">Wrath Character Add-On Deck</a></i> if you have more\
  \ than 4 characters (or just because you want to). Dump them into the box and then\
  \ remove all the Basic cards. However, if there are Basic boons you specifically\
  \ want to keep, do so. (I highly recommend keeping all the Blessings of Ascension.\
  \ Trust me on this.)</p> \n     <p>Third, you know those mythic path cards I pointedly\
  \ forgot to mention when I talked about Wrath's power curve? Yeah, screw 'em. You\
  \ don't get mythic paths, because you're not the mythic heroes that blew up the\
  \ wardstone in <em>Wrath</em>. You're the guys who beat Karzoug, for Pulura's sake.\
  \ You don't need no stinkin' mythic paths.</p> \n     <p>But here's a tip: Even\
  \ though you don't start with any mythic charges, you can still use them. Those\
  \ Blessings of Ascension are great for generating charges, and every time you kill\
  \ a mythic bane, you'll get one too. So when you find a Terraform or Anarchy Hammer,\
  \ you can still power it up. Just get yourself some charges along the way. (A very\
  \ small number of cards, like Lend Mythic Path, won't work at all. If you hit one\
  \ of those, chuck it aside and draw a new card of the same type.)</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9077-Bestiary.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9077-Bestiary_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br><i>Illustration by Jon Neimeister</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Fourth,\
  \ start with <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhwb\">scenario 4-1: The Abyss Gazes\
  \ Also</a>. You're going into the Abyss! After defeating Karzoug or the Hurricane\
  \ King, you were drawn through a magic portal that chucked you into the pits of\
  \ despair. Will you find your way home? Run through adventures 4, 5, and 6 and find\
  \ out!</p> \n     <p>FYI: While you can keep all of your cards from the previous\
  \ AP, treat any card in your deck that has an adventure deck number higher than\
  \ the adventure deck number of the current scenario as if it had the adventure deck\
  \ number of the scenario. (So when you're playing chapter 4 of <em>Wrath</em>, treat\
  \ those cards from <em>RotR</em> or <em>S&amp;S</em> 5 and 6 as if they're from\
  \ Adventure Deck 4.) Why did your hexing suddenly drop in power, Feiya? You're in\
  \ the Abyss! Things are crazy there.</p> \n     <p>Fifth, when you get a reward,\
  \ claim it! But hey, what about when you've already checked your last card feat\
  \ or power feat and you're awarded another one? Just make it a skill feat. We've\
  \ done the math, so you're good there. When you're done with the final scenario\
  \ of <em>Wrath</em> 6, your set of feat boxes will be real close to entirely filled\
  \ in. Now that's a hero.</p> \n     <p>It's possible some of your power feats won't\
  \ be particularly great in <em>Wrath</em>. (I'm looking at you, Pirate Queen Jirelle.)\
  \ Well, life's tough in the Abyss. But if you want to make some mods, swapping out\
  \ a trait like \"Pirate\" for one like \"Aberration,\" fine. Just don't make a habit\
  \ of it. The idea is that you're taking your characters from those adventures into\
  \ the Abyss, so it's up to you to see how you survive. If you want to play a character\
  \ that's <i>built</i> for <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, then start a character\
  \ (be it Ezren, Jirelle, Sajan, or Lini) anew and enjoy it. This is explicitly for\
  \ people who want to see what their <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> or <em>Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles</em> conquerors would do if they pushed on to even more perilous\
  \ heights (or depths, as the case may be).</p> \n     <p>Oh, and hey, now you have\
  \ something to do with that loot you picked up at the end of the previous Adventure\
  \ Path!</p> \n     <p>So that's \"adventure 7.\" If you haven't picked up <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOftheRighteous\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>\
  \ and you're wondering what to do with your <em>Runelords</em> or <em>Shackles</em>\
  \ characters now, give <em>Wrath</em> a try. You asked for a chance to adventure\
  \ beyond set 6, and we've given it to you. It's your choice to take the plunge into\
  \ the Abyss.</p> \n     <p>Don't say we didn't warn you.</p> \n     <p>Mike Selinker<br>\
