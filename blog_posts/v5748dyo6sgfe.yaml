  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Critical hits are among the most dramatic,\
  \ and most popular, moments in a Starfinder game session. A player scoring a critical\
  \ hit is generally rewarded with cheers from fellow players, while an NPC scoring\
  \ one often leads to groans and (hopefully good-hearted) booing. A critical hit\
  \ can change the course of a battle, force new tactics to be adopted, and may also\
  \ set a foe on fire, leave them insensate for a round, or even chop off a limb.\
  \ Critical hits are rare, but memorable.</p> \n    <p>Now, groups can choose to\
  \ make them MORE memorable.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ \n     <br><i>Illustration by Taylor Fischer</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpya17c?Starfinder-Critical-Hit-Deck\"><i>Starfinder\
  \ Critical Hit Deck</i></a> offers hundreds of new critical hit results that can\
  \ be used to boost the breadth and impact of that natural 20. Critical hits results\
  \ are divided into three broad categories of attacks listed on every card (kinetic,\
  \ energy, or spell), and one specific \"Extreme Critical\" on each card that can\
  \ be selected if the attack meets it's narrower definition (such as fire damage,\
  \ or melee attack). When an attack is a critical hit, you use the appropriate critical\
  \ for your broad attack category, or if you attack matches the extreme critical\
  \ you can choose to use that instead.</p> \n    <p>A card's rules may give you an\
  \ optional critical hit effect (one you can use in place of your attack's normal\
  \ critical hit effect, if any), or a bonus effect (which you add to any critical\
  \ hit effect you already have). These effects can add weapon special features, existing\
  \ critical hit effects, extra damage, impose conditions on your foes, or grant bonuses\
  \ to you or your allies. The rules card outlines how to determine the level of an\
  \ effect, any required save DC, how to remove penalties that last until healed,\
  \ and other details of applying the critical effects.</p> \n    <p>For example,\
  \ if you critically hit a foe with a thunderstrike pulse gauntlet, you might pull\
  \ a card with the energy critical \"Which Way is Up?\" with the listed effect \"\
  Crit Effect: The target is flat-footed for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude negates).\" You\
  \ can then choose to use your pulse gauntlet's normal critical hit effect (knockdown),\
  \ or the energy critical effect, giving you a chance to make the target flat-footed\
  \ for 1d4 rounds. However, the same card with \"Which Way is Up?\" also gives the\
  \ extreme critical \"Extreme Sonic: Sound of victory.\" That critical says \"Bonus\
  \ Effect: Allies within 60 feet (not including yourself) regain Stamina Points equal\
  \ to their level.\" Since a thunderstrike pulse gauntlet is a sonic weapon, you\
  \ can choose the extreme sonic critical rather than the energy critical, and since\
  \ that's a bonus effect, you can both knock down foes and inspire your allies so\
  \ much they regain Stamina Points.</p> \n    <p>Of course part of the fun of a critical\
  \ hit deck is the names of the various critical, which often get a laugh or cheer\
  \ from players. While not every critical hit name is humorous, the hope is that\
  \ enough are to bring some grins to a typical game. Along those lines my personal\
  \ favorites are \"Kinetically Induced Stupidity\" (Bonus Effect: The target moves\
  \ 1 step down the Intelligence poison track until healed), \"Shoot the Chandelier\"\
  \ (Bonus Effect: Create a square of cover adjacent to you or the target, as if using\
  \ the Barricade feat), \"Aftereffect Alacrity\" (Bonus Effect: You gain the benefits\
  \ of <i>haste</i> for 1d4 rounds), and \"Extreme Piercing: Nailed in Place\" (Bonus\
  \ Effect: The target cannot leave its space [Strength DC 20 negates].)</p> \n  \
  \  <p>So grab a deck, get an enemy in your sights, and hope you roll a 20!</p> \n\
