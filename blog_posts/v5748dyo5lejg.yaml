  \ Tim Pratt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Serpent and Bow</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Rodrick dropped the bell\
  \ and scrambled toward the slope that led back to the barrow. The linnorm uncoiled\
  \ with impossible speed, and suddenly its head filled Rodrick's vision, blocking\
  \ his route to the treasure room.</span></p> \n    <p>The miniature snowstorm Rodrick\
  \ had accidentally spawned with the bell sent snowflakes spiraling all around, limiting\
  \ visibility, but not enough to matter at this range. The coins and stones beneath\
  \ the soles of his feet were icy, so cold Rodrick worried he'd lose his toes to\
  \ frostbite—and then realized such a worry was the least of his problems, as he\
  \ was standing nose-to-snout with a linnorm. </p> \n    <p>Rodrick had never seen\
  \ a dragon or dragon-type creature in person, but this one looked more or less like\
  \ the statues and drawings of such creatures: a huge reptilian head with twisted\
  \ horns, immense black eyes, and a mouth full of teeth like broken daggers. It was\
  \ unmistakably an apex predator of such power and size that Rodrick would barely\
  \ count as a mouthful. </p> \n    <p>He froze, still holding Hrym aloft, as the\
  \ creature gazed at him. It opened its jaws, and Rodrick prepared himself to be\
  \ bitten in half. The preparation mostly involved whimpering and trembling. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Instead, the creature began to draw in a vast breath. Rodrick's relief\
  \ lasted only for an instant. Could linnorms breathe fire, or ice, or poison, as\
  \ their less snakelike cousins the dragons did?</p> \n    <p>At least it would be\
  \ a quick death, Rodrick thought. Not as good as no death, but better than many\
  \ of the other alternatives.</p> \n    <p>\"Point me at the beast!\" Hrym shouted.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Rodrick complied, though it was more of an involuntary muscle spasm\
  \ than a conscious effort.</p> \n    <p>A cone of swirling, bluish-white crystals\
  \ shot forth from the point of the sword, and the blade sent up great billows of\
  \ freezing white mist. The linnorm disappeared in the torrent of ice, and when Hrym\
  \ ceased his frigid attack, the beast's head was encased in an irregular ball of\
  \ ice the size of a boulder. The linnorm's body began to whip around wildly, and\
  \ Rodrick threw himself to one side—careful to keep his grip on the sword—to avoid\
  \ being crushed by the creature's coils. The boots wrapped around his neck nearly\
  \ strangled him in the process, but he managed to cram himself against the cavern\
  \ wall. </p> \n    <p>The linnorm's ice-encrusted head slammed into the wall that\
  \ led to the treasure room, smashing down enough rocks to block access to the barrow.\
  \ Rodrick whimpered again—he was doing a lot of that lately. Trapped in a cavern,\
  \ in a magical ice storm, barefoot, with a furious linnorm lashing around. The day\
  \ just got better and better.</p> \n    <p>The torch he'd jammed into the coins\
  \ was dislodged by the beast's lashings, and it came sliding down the mound of treasure\
  \ toward Rodrick. He scooted away on his butt to avoid having his feet set on fire,\
  \ then picked up the torch. It flickered weakly, its fuel nearly extinguished. The\
  \ thought of being trapped here <i>blind</i> was too horrible to contemplate.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The linnorm continued to bash its head against the cavern wall, trying\
  \ to break the armor of ice before it suffocated. Rodrick wondered if it would die\
  \ or escape before causing the entire cavern to cave in. </p> \n    <p>\"Good thing\
  \ it's a mountain linnorm,\" Hrym said. \"They breathe fire—or, actually, molten\
  \ rock. Ice linnorms are immune to my powers.\"</p> \n    <p>\"How fortunate,\"\
  \ Rodrick rasped. He struggled to his feet, shivering in the cold. \"We have to\
  \ kill the beast before it collapses the whole cavern on top of us.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"I wouldn't recommend that,\" Hrym said. \"When linnorms die, they curse their\
  \ killers. Don't you think your luck is bad enough already?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'd\
  \ rather be cursed and alive than blessed and <i>dead</i>, sword.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Hmm,\" Hrym said. \"You make a point. Being an immortal magical sword, I don't usually\
  \ see things in those terms. There <i>is</i> another option, though.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>The ball of ice encrusting the linnorm's head began to glow deeply red, like\
  \ an immense ruby. Rodrick realized the monster was trying to use its breath weapon—\
  magical lava-breath versus magical ice. Which would prevail?</p> \n    <p>\"Don't\
  \ you want to hear about the other option—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, yes, of course!\"\
  \ Rodrick shouted.</p> \n    <p>\"We could just leave.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The monster\
  \ has sealed off the entry to the barrow—\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-DwarfMiner.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-DwarfMiner_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> Never get between a dwarf and his ore.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"Yes, I\
  \ <i>can</i> see, you know, even if I don't have eyes. I don't mean we can leave\
  \ that way. There's a tunnel toward the back of the chamber, probably too small\
  \ for the linnorm to fit through. But a tiny little humanoid like you—\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Rodrick was moving before the sword even finished speaking. The cavern was\
  \ brighter now, with the monster's fiery breath shining through the prism of ice\
  \ around its head, casting rays of ruby light all around—and revealing a spot of\
  \ deeper shadow in one wall, a tunnel big enough for Rodrick to fit through if he\
  \ crouched.</p> \n    <p>Once outside the main cavern, the horrible biting cold\
  \ diminished. Rodrick's spine protested as he shuffled along bent forward, torch\
  \ in one hand, icy sword in the other, following the curving contours of the tunnel.\
  \ Behind him there was a great thump, and the sound of cascading rock. He paused\
  \ and looked back in time to see the mouth of the tunnel go totally black, sealed\
  \ off by a cave collapse.</p> \n    <p>\"Is it dead?\" he asked.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I don't know,\" Hrym said. \"Do you feel cursed?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Now that you mention\
  \ it... But wouldn't you be the one to get cursed?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I believe traditionally\
  \ the <i>wielder</i> of a weapon is held to be the responsible party, not the weapon\
  \ itself.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick grunted. He leaned Hrym against the tunnel wall,\
  \ jammed the spluttering torch into a scree of small stones, and sat down on a flattish\
  \ outcropping of rock. He crammed his feet—they felt like lumps of ice—into the\
  \ magical boots, which shifted and squirmed to fit his feet perfectly. He leaned\
  \ against the wall with his eyes closed and exhaled. \"It's good to be alive.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I wouldn't know.\"</p> \n    <p>The thief opened one eye. \"You\
  \ can shoot ice, then. That's handy.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, that's just a small part\
  \ of what I can do. I hail from the north, and all things of frost, ice, and cold\
  \ are within my power.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't suppose you can <i>withdraw</i>\
  \ cold? My ears are freezing.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, but I could make the rest of\
  \ you even colder, to make the ears seem warm in comparison.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I\
  \ think I'll pass,\" Rodrick said. \"Do you have any other tricks? Glowing in the\
  \ presence of evil, flying around and fighting on your own, things like that?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Total elemental mastery of ice isn't <i>enough</i> for you?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Yes, well. Hmm. So you can't move on your own, then. You need a wielder.\
  \ Someone to carry you around.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, humans are to me as horses\
  \ are to humans.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Ha. Horses aren't the ones who decide where to\
  \ go, though.\"</p> \n    <p>The sword's voice grew harder. \"A man who tries to\
  \ take me somewhere I don't wish to go will find himself with his hand frozen off,\
  \ adventurer. And now that we're on the subject, I don't want to be carried around—\
  I want to rest on a heap of treasure. Specifically the untold riches I was promised.\
  \ Shouldn't we be on our way?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Do you know a way out of this black\
  \ cave, then?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I barely knew there was a tunnel. I just remembered\
  \ glimpsing this one when the linnorm dragged me into his hoard. Aren't you living\
  \ creatures attuned to subtle drafts and currents of air and so forth?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Not especially.\" Rodrick stood up, his head brushing the top of the tunnel.\
  \ \"But it's not as if we're faced with a wealth of choices. This tunnel only goes\
  \ in one direction.\"</p> \n    <p>\"If you die and leave me stuck in some dark\
  \ hole with <i>no gold</i> I will be very annoyed.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm sure knowledge\
  \ of your unhappiness will make my afterlife miserable, sword.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick\
  \ picked up the sword and the torch and made his way along the tunnel, trying in\
  \ vain to feel a waft of air suggesting a route to the upper world. He also did\
  \ his best to avoid facing the possibility that he might simply be sealed in the\
  \ dark forever, plunging ever deeper, eventually starving to death. The torch's\
  \ light grew ever more inconstant and flickering as he progressed, and he wondered\
  \ how long he'd be able to force himself to keep going once the light was gone,\
  \ and he was inching along by feel—</p> \n    <p>\"Do you hear that?\" Hrym said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Rodrick cocked his head. He did hear <i>something</i>—a distant sort\
  \ of knocking, seemingly coming from the rock wall before him. \"It's not the linnorm,\"\
  \ he said. \"That's still behind us, unless I've become hopelessly turned around.\"\
  \ </p> \n    <p> \"Jam me in that crack in the rock,\" Hrym said. \"As far in as\
  \ you can.\"</p> \n    <p>\"As you wish.\" Rodrick shoved the point of the sword\
  \ into a fissure in the wall. \"Now what—\"</p> \n    <p>The exposed length of sword\
  \ began to steam and billow mist, and ice crystals poured out of the hole. Cracks\
  \ spread across the wall, like thin ice breaking over a pond, as magical frost filled\
  \ every minute fissure and pushed it wider. </p> \n    <p>\"If you bury me, you\
  \ stupid sword—\"</p> \n    <p>The wall collapsed inward in a cascade of frozen\
  \ stone, and Hrym stopped steaming mist. A hole three feet across yawned open at\
  \ chest height, light glowing on the other side. A man with a filthy face, holding\
  \ a pickaxe, gaped in astonishment at Rodrick. </p> \n    <p>\"Hi there,\" the thief\
  \ said, clambering through the hole, leaving the torch behind. \"A miner, are you?\
  \ Good man. I have only the greatest admiration for those who wrestle wealth from\
  \ the very bowels of the world—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Are you mining for gold?\" Hrym\
  \ said. \"Answer me, man!\"</p> \n    <p>The miner stared, wide-eyed, at the talking\
  \ sword, then dropped his pickaxe and ran away, leaving a sack and a lantern behind\
  \ with his tools. </p> \n    <p>\"Hmm,\" Rodrick said. \"We may as well follow him.\
  \ I doubt he's running in terror <i>deeper</i> into the mine, so he's probably headed\
  \ for the surface.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't see anything shiny at all,\" Hrym said.\
  \ \"They must be mining something boring here.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick picked up\
  \ the lantern and began to walk, whistling, through the tunnel. \"Things are looking\
  \ up, sword. You'll be resting on a bed of gold in no time, and more importantly,\
  \ so will I—\"</p> \n    <p>A dwarf stepped from a side tunnel and into Rodrick's\
  \ path. He wore a miner's helmet set with a magical glowing gem, and held a battleaxe\
  \ with a head approximately as large as his own chest. </p> \n    <p>\"Breaking\
  \ into my mine?\" he rumbled. \"Trying to steal from me? Nobody steals from me!\
  \ This mine is mine!\"</p> \n    <p>\"You don't—\" Rodrick began, but then the dwarf\
  \ was coming at him, axe held high.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Finder's\
