  \      <br>\n      <p>Of course, we can’t talk about solarians without shining the\
  \ spotlight on Dae, the new iconic solarian. In fact, Dae has already had their\
  \ blog debut, and you can read all about them in our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6ufzl?Meet-The-Iconics-Dae\"\
  >Meet the Iconics: Dae</a> post from June. They’d appreciate it if you like, comment,\
  \ and subscribe.</p>\n      <p>Solarians are solar knights who harness the powers\
  \ of light and gravity to manifest powerful armaments in their quest to understand\
  \ the cosmic forces of the universe.</p>\n      <p>Designing solarians for Starfinder\
  \ Second Edition presented the team with an opportunity to reexamine the solarian\
  \ toolset. In Starfinder First Edition, solarians had a key choice at first level\
  \ when selecting whether their solar manifestation would be armor or a weapon. As\
  \ the solarian leveled up, they chose stellar revelations, special powers they could\
  \ use while attuned to gravitons or photons. Some powerful revelations could be\
  \ used only if the solarian spent enough time building up their attunement points\
  \ to become “fully attuned.” To match the mechanics to solarian beliefs about the\
  \ cosmic cycle, First Edition solarians were encouraged to select an equal number\
  \ of graviton and photon revelations.</p>\n      <p>With Starfinder Second Edition’\
  s three-action economy in mind, the team took a new approach to solarians. We wanted\
  \ the narrative of the Cycle to continue to match the mechanics while still offering\
  \ solarians flexibility, both in their character build and in their round-by-round\
  \ action economy. To that end, solarians in Second Edition don’t have to choose\
  \ between armor or a weapon: from level 1, they can manifest a <strong>solar flare</strong>\
  \ (ranged attack), <strong>solar nimbus</strong>(defensive reaction), and <strong>solar\
  \ weapon</strong> (exactly what it sounds like—a melee attack). Each of these manifestations\
  \ has a different function based on whether the solarian is graviton-attuned or\
  \ photon-attuned.</p>\n      <p>So, what major choice do Second Edition solarians\
  \ make at level 1? That’d be their <strong>solarian arrangement</strong>! All solarians\
  \ have personal beliefs, practices, or training that cause them to gravitate (pun\
  \ intended) toward a specific aspect of the Cycle, whether that’s gravitons, photons,\
  \ or balance. This arrangement grants them <strong>revelations</strong>, which (like\
  \ in First Edition) are special abilities that interact with the different states\
  \ of attunement and, in many cases, interact with their targets’ Hit Point totals,\
  \ enemy positioning, the solarian’s mobility, and so on.</p>\n      <p>Okay, so\
  \ if solarians choose a solarian arrangement that focuses on gravitons, are they\
  \ going to spend all their time attuned to gravitons? Doesn’t that go against the\
  \ narrative of the “Cycle” and balance between stellar forces? This is where we’\
  ve made what is possibly the biggest change to solarians: their attunement works\
  \ differently now. Gone are the days of tracking attunement points: you’re either\
  \ attuned to gravitons, photons, or neither. Furthermore, we’ve introduced a new\
  \ type of ability: those with the <strong>cycle </strong>trait, which—you guessed\
  \ it—cycle your attunement! Using a cycle ability while graviton-attuned means that\
  \ you resolve that ability (applying any additional effects from being graviton-attuned),\
  \ and then immediately become photon-attuned. If you want to be graviton-attuned\
  \ again, you’ll need to use another cycle ability or take the Attune action, which\
  \ attunes you to your favored attunement state. If you want to play a solarian who\
  \ does lots of attunement swapping and has greater attunement flexibility, you’\
  ll want the “balanced” solarian arrangement, because (among their other fun abilities)\
  \ the Attune action lets you pick either graviton or photon!</p>\n      <p>This\
  \ round-by-round decision-making process based on each ability’s unique attunement\
  \ effects has played out quite well in both internal and public playtests, and we\
  \ can’t wait for you to try it out. Players seem to enjoy the rush of cycling between\
  \ graviton and photon attunement, and the “combos” they can create with a solarian’\
  s abilities. You might not need to take the Attune action during combat at all if\
  \ you’re intentional about how and when you use your cycle abilities, but if you\
  \ really want to make an impact, you’ve got another exciting new type of ability:\
  \ actions with the <strong>disharmony </strong>trait have a big effect, then completely\
  \ end your attunement. You’ll need to spend an action to Attune again after using\
  \ a disharmony ability—otherwise, you can’t manifest your solar shot, nimbus, or\
  \ weapon. Then again, by that point, the battle might be over!</p>\n      <p>Okay,\
  \ we’ve talked about the cool things solarians can do, but one big question we get\
  \ a lot is how solarians will work as primarily melee-focused characters in an otherwise\
  \ ranged-combat “meta.” We’ve mentioned their solar flare, a fun way to attack enemies\
  \ at a short distance; it’s a great ability to fire off while closing the gap. Speaking\
  \ of closing the gap, solarians have a plethora of options when it comes to battlefield\
  \ positioning, whether that’s gaining a big speed boost or taking a more direct\
  \ approach and moving enemies around with gravity powers. You might need to work\
  \ a little harder than the sniper in your party when it comes to tactical positioning,\
  \ but the cinematic combos you can pull off while getting into position will be\
  \ a blast! If you’re worried about what might happen to your Hit Points while you’\
  re moving in, you’ve got options there, too: <strong>Solar Shield</strong>, a level\
  \ 1 feat, allows you to manifest a stellar shield that floats nearby. You’ll also\
  \ likely have a decent AC and a fair number of Hit Points to rely on. Because your\
  \ key attribute is Strength and the damage of your primary ranged attack (solar\
  \ flare) uses Strength as well, you’ll likely be able to make room in your build\
  \ for attribute boosts to Dexterity, Constitution, or both!</p>\n      <p>We’re\
  \ excited to see what kinds of solarian builds you create during the playtest. In\
  \ our own internal playtesting, we’ve built solarians who focus on big speed boosts\
  \ to get in close and deal tons of damage, others who stay in the front lines to\
  \ fight like a tank, and still others who pin enemies down as masters of battlefield\
  \ control. Every solarian we’ve playtested has felt different. Most importantly,\
  \ though, each of them has felt very much like a solarian.</p>\n      <p>Remember\
  \ to keep an eye on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest\">Starfinder\
  \ Playtest</a> site for more news and info about the playtest and feedback process.\
  \ We’ll have lots more Starfinder Second Edition news to announce at GenCon 2024,\
  \ when you’ll finally be able to purchase the Starfinder Playtest Rulebook (or download\
  \ the free PDF)!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
