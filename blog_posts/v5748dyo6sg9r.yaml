  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The Pathfinder Playtest is roaring along as\
  \ we move our focus to <em>Part 4, The Mirrored Moon</em>. This adventure sees the\
  \ return of your characters from Part 1. In the years that have passed, these heroes\
  \ have grown to be powerful adventurers in their own right, but the mystery that\
  \ started all those years ago in Keleri's basement has yet to be solved. In Part\
  \ 4, you'll rejoin them as they continue the quest in Thicketfell, in the faraway\
  \ River Kingdoms.</p> \n    <p>Once you have completed your playthrough of Part\
  \ 4, please remember to take the following surveys. Your data is critical in helping\
  \ us make the second edition of Pathfinder be the best game it can be!</p> \n  \

  \ target=\"_blank\">Game Master Survey</a> | <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP4OP\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Open Survey</a></p> \n    <p>As a reminder, if you have not\
  \ completed Parts 1, 2, or 3, you still have plenty of time to finish your sessions\
  \ and get us <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\">your survey feedback</a>. The more\
  \ data we get, the more certain we are of how various parts of the game are performing.\
  \ I should also note that as we get further into the playtest, some of the goals\
  \ of each part of the adventure become a bit more extreme. You might play sessions\
  \ that seem out of balance or somewhat harder than you're used to as we push the\
  \ system to its limits and beyond. We've endeavored to make sure each part of <em>Doomsday\
  \ Dawn</em> provides a fun and engaging adventure, but the goals of the test come\
  \ first. We want to thank all of you for your patience and understanding as we delve\
  \ deeper and deeper into the system.</p> \n    <h2>All of the Changes in Update\
  \ 1.3</h2> \n    <p>Today also marks the release of Update 1.3, which promises to\
  \ deliver a number of substantive changes to your game. Before I launch into the\
  \ details, why don't you go grab a copy?</p> \n    <blockquote>\n     <div class=\"\
  playtest-link\" style=\"margin:2rem;font-family:Verdana;text-align:center;\">\n\
  \      <a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/paizo-images/image/download/PZO2100UE-1.3.zip\"\
  >Download Rulebook Updates</a>\n     </div>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>So, first\
  \ and foremost is a revision to the Proficiency and DCs of the game. As of today,\
  \ if you're untrained in something, your bonus is now equal to your level -4! This\
  \ change was made to ensure that characters who haven't specialized in a given skill\
  \ or ability aren't directly competing with those who have made the choice to invest\
  \ in it. We've also made significant alterations to Table 10-2, Skill DCs by Level\
  \ and Difficulty. In most cases, we lowered the DC by a point or two (but sometimes\
  \ by 4 or more at higher levels). We made this change so that players who focus\
  \ their character choices around a task have a better chance of success and so that\
  \ this chance of success grows as you do. As a result, we have included errata for\
  \ all 7 parts of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, updating all of the skill DCs across the\
  \ adventure to reflect this change.</p> \n    <p>Death and dying receives another\
  \ revision in this update. After looking at playtest data, we saw a significant\
  \ change in dying rates and play style due to the way that characters came back\
  \ from being unconscious. As of this update, we have removed the slowed condition\
  \ that applied to characters after they were revived, and we've replaced it with\
  \ a new condition: the wounded condition. This condition doesn't penalize your checks\
  \ or DCs, but if you fall unconscious again, your dying condition is increased by\
  \ your wounded condition. This means that while you're not penalized directly for\
  \ getting up and charging back into the fray, your chance of dying increases the\
  \ more times you're knocked out in a fight.</p> \n    <p>To go along with this change,\
  \ we've also added a new way to use the Medicine skill, allowing you to spend 10\
  \ minutes to bandage the wounds of up to six creatures (one of which can be you).\
  \ Depending on the check, this allows you to heal a significant amount of damage\
  \ to everyone under your care! The best part is, you don't have to be a cleric to\
  \ use this ability and it doesn't rely on your magic resources, so you can save\
  \ those for combat. We made this change so that out-of-combat healing was a bit\
  \ easier to manage, which allows you to heal up between fights and rely a bit less\
  \ on the classes that have access to magical healing.</p> \n    <p>Finally, there\
  \ are a lot of smaller changes in this update, including revisions to a number of\
  \ classes, most notably the ranger and the rogue, both of which got some much-needed\
  \ versatility added to their builds. But there's one other gigantic addition I want\
  \ to talk about.</p> \n    <h2>Multiclass Archetypes Update</h2> \n    <p>Today\
  \ we're releasing playtest material for all 12 of the multiclass archetypes, along\
  \ with some revisions to the existing multiclass archetypes found in the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Rulebook</em>. These additions expand your range of tools when building\
  \ new characters. With these changes, you can now play a bard that dabbles in the\
  \ strange mysteries of the monk, or a barbarian with a sorcerous lineage!</p> \n\
  \    <p>We put all of these archetypes in their own document for ease of reference.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote>\n     <div class=\"playtest-link\" style=\"margin:2rem;font-family:Verdana;text-align:center;\"\

  >Download Multiclass Archetypes Updates</a>\n     </div>\n    </blockquote> \n \
  \   <h2>The Future of Resonance</h2> \n    <p>Since the start of the playtest, we\
  \ have heard a lot of feedback on the resonance system and we have been working\
  \ hard to come up with a way to make it a better part of the game. Currently, we're\
  \ looking at ways to use the resonance system just for tracking the items you wear,\
  \ purely as a replacement for the slot system from Pathfinder First Edition. At\
  \ the same time, we're looking to add a system that allows you to focus on the magic\
  \ that your character <i>can</i> utilize to give it a boost in power when you need\
  \ to, but otherwise allowing you to use it in a simpler way in an emergency. It's\
  \ a little early to go into too many details, but I will say this: under this new\
  \ system, you'll always be healed when you drink a <i>healing potion</i>.</p> \n\
  \    <p>While our current plan for the system is still coming together, we know\
  \ that a change of this size is going to be challenging for us to fully implement\
  \ before the end of the playtest. But, we do have a way to ensure that you can give\
  \ it a try before we're done. In the coming weeks we're going to release a special\
  \ version of the Pathfinder Society Playtest Scenario <em>Raiders of the Shrieking\
  \ Peak</em>. This adventure is played using pregenerated characters, which allows\
  \ us to create a conversion to the new system without having to convert the entire\
  \ game all at once. When this scenario becomes available, we'll be asking everyone\
  \ to give it a try, and we'll generate a specific survey looking at the new systems\
  \ to get your feedback.</p> \n    <p>Well, that's about all for this week! Let us\
  \ know what you think about these changes in the comments down below. And as always,\
  \ we thank each and every one of you for participating in the playtest!</p> \n \
