  \ Dive with Undersea Characters</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 11, 2017</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're on\
  \ the cusp of releasing <a href=\"/products/btpy9trg?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Sea\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of the Sea</em></a>, and I wanted to provide\
  \ a glimpse beneath the surface at its contents. I think this product's existence\
  \ isn't a huge surprise: a player focus on underwater adventuring naturally follows\
  \ the recent <a href=\"/products/btpy9toq?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Aquatic-Adventures\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures</em></a> and the upcoming Ruins\
  \ of Azlant adventure path (<a href=\"/products/btpy9sxi?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-125-Tower-of-the-Drowned-Dead\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #125: Tower of the Drowned Dead</em></a> takes place\
  \ entirely underwater, with an exception I hope people find as awesome as it is\
  \ unexpected). I also think this product's structure isn't a huge surprise: as with\
  \ other Player Companion volumes such as <a href=\"/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast\"\
  ><em>Blood of the Beast</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows\"\
  ><em>Blood of Shadows</em></a>, you'll see PC races highlighted and expanded. What\
  \ will surprise most people is how awesome and useful <em>Blood of the Sea</em>\
  \ really is.</p> \n    <p>First, the book was penned by Amber Scott, a long-time\
  \ contributor for Paizo who devotes as much attention to flavor as rules. Amber's\
  \ text was a delight to develop. She took a close look at several aquatic races\
  \ and added innumerable roleplaying touches; for example, the notoriously lawful\
  \ tritons are often asked to serve as mediators by other aquatic races, many aquatic\
  \ elves are incorrigible treasure-seekers, and quite a few locathahs like potatoes.\
  \ She also provided cool race-specific mechanical options for each, including archetypes,\
  \ feats, and gear. For example, merfolk are deeply connected to musical expression\
  \ and therefore have new bardic masterpieces and the song-bound oracle curse.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In addition, <em>Blood of the Sea</em> provides racial trait lists for\
  \ races that didn't have them—such as locathahs, sahuagin, tritons, and more. These\
  \ traits span a wide range to suit many campaign types: locathahs and tritons have\
  \ the same power level as existing PC races (10 RP and 11 RP, respectively), while\
  \ other races are slightly more powerful but fit perfectly into an underwater campaign.\
  \ Like an octopus-person? Yes!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ it neat?<br> <i>Illustration by Kent Hamilton</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Cecaelia\
  \ Racial Traits (23 RP)</h2> \n     <p>As cecaelias are unusual and powerful monstrous\
  \ creatures, you should play one only with your GM's permission. Cecaelias normally\
  \ have racial Hit Dice, skills, and other abilities. PC cecaelias, however, calculate\
  \ these benefits based solely on their class. Note that these abilities are only\
  \ an approximation of the cecaelia monster from <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-3\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</em></a> and may not match exactly. PC cecaelias\
  \ have the following racial traits.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>+2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, –2 Intelligence</b>: Cecaelias are nimble\
  \ and have a canny insight, but they tend to be flighty.</p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Monstrous Humanoid</b>: Cecaelias are monstrous humanoids with\
  \ the aquatic subtype.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Medium</b>: Cecaelias\
  \ are Medium creatures, and they have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Darkvision</b>: Cecaelias have darkvision\
  \ with a range of 60 feet.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Tentacle Sense\
  \ (1 RP)</b>: While swimming and not grappled or grappling, a cecaelia can spread\
  \ her tentacles wide to form a sensory net around herself as a swift action. This\
  \ grants blindsight to a range of 10 feet and lasts as long as the cecaelia concentrates\
  \ or until the cecaelia attacks with a tentacle or moves.</p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Natural Armor</b>: Cecaelias have a +2 natural armor bonus.</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Normal Speed</b>: Cecaelias have no trouble\
  \ moving about on land using their tentacles and have a base speed of 30 feet.</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Swim Speed</b>: Cecaelias have a swim speed\
  \ of 40 feet.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Jet (1 RP)</b>: Cecaelias\
  \ can swim 200 feet backward as a full-round action. A cecaelia must move in a straight\
  \ line when jetting and does not provoke attacks of opportunity when she uses jet.</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Tentacle Attacks (3 RP)</b>: Cecaelias have\
  \ two tentacle attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage. These attacks are primary\
  \ natural attacks and have a reach of 10 feet. This extended reach only applies\
  \ to the cecaelia's tentacle attacks and not to any other attacks she makes.</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Amphibious</b>: Cecaelias are amphibious\
  \ and can breathe both air and water.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Ink\
  \ Cloud (3 RP)</b>: Once per hour as a standard action, a cecaelia can emit a 10-foot-radius\
  \ sphere of ink while underwater. This ink cloud provides total concealment and\
  \ persists for 1 minute.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Stable Tentacles\
  \ (4 RP)</b>: Cecaelias cannot be tripped.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Languages</b>: Cecaelias begin play speaking Aquan and Common. Cecaelias with\
  \ a high Intelligence score can choose from the following: Aklo, Celestial, Draconic,\
  \ Elven, Giant, Gnome, and Halfling.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><em>Blood of the Sea</em> isn't just about aquatic races; it's also extremely\
  \ useful for land-bound races venturing beneath the waves. You'll find several archetypes,\
  \ magic items, and spells useful for undersea exploration, such as the tempest tamer\
  \ archetype (a druid that transforms into air or water elementals rather than animals\
  \ or plants) and the <i>suspend drowning</i> spell. A useful magic item for PCs\
  \ with little critters is the <i>familiar bubble</i>. Useful how? Take a look!</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p>Did someone say there were sahuagin PCs down here?<br> <i>Illustration\
  \ by Alyssa Davis</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Familiar Bubble <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Price 2,500 GP</span></p> \n    \
  \ <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 3rd; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.<br>\
  \ <b>Aura</b> faint conjuration</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>familiar\
  \ bubble</i> looks like nothing more than a pair of reinforced leather straps designed\
  \ to fit over the shoulders—until it is worn. Once the straps are donned, a bubble\
  \ of force forms on the wearer's back, large enough to hold a Tiny or smaller creature\
  \ and 1 pound of items (usually food for the creature). The bubble is transparent\
  \ and continuously generates fresh, breathable air within. While the bubble keeps\
  \ air in and water out, it is permeable to other objects. Spells and weapons can\
  \ target the creature in the <i>familiar bubble</i> normally.</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block\">As a standard action, the <i>familiar bubble</i>'s user can designate\
  \ a specific creature within 30 feet that can pass freely in and out of the bubble.\
  \ All other living creatures find the bubble impenetrable. This selection remains\
  \ until the wearer chooses a different creature or removes the <i>familiar bubble</i>\
  \ (which causes the bubble to disappear). Normally, the user selects a creature\
  \ in order to get it into the bubble and then selects himself so he can retrieve\
  \ the creature, if needed.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-breaker\">Construction\
  \ Requirements <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Cost 1,250 gp</span></p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\">Craft Wondrous Item, <i>air bubble</i><sup>UC</sup></p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><em>Blood of the Sea</em> also discusses the roleplaying\
  \ elements that can confront landwalker PCs, such as why aquatic disguises can be\
  \ difficult to pull off and why Common is hard to speak underwater. It also discusses\
  \ the most useful and relevant magic items and spells that already exist. I'll conclude\
  \ with a personal story: in an adventure path I'm playing, our group needed to embark\
  \ on a lengthy underwater excursion. While the other players scoured the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy88yj?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook\"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy8tmc?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Equipment\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a> to see how best to pull it off, I just consulted\
  \ page 29 of Blood of the Sea and noted that cloaks of the manta ray were probably\
  \ our cheapest effective option, and that we should carry back-up potions of water\
  \ breathing as well. Useful advice! The journey went well, although my hobgoblin\
  \ druid was slain by our party's oread monk who had been dominated by—whoops, spoilers.\
  \ But any way you look at it, <a href=\"/products/btpy9trg?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Sea\"\
  ><em>Blood of the Sea</em></a> brings new depths to underwater adventuring!</p>\
