  \ Bones: An Evolution Of Gaming Miniatures</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thu, Aug\
  \ 16, 2012 at 08:00 AM Pacific</p> \n    <p>I don't normally contact you about another\
  \ company's products like this, but in this case, it was such a great project that\
  \ I felt compelled to let you know so you wouldn't miss out!</p> \n    <p><span\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">Our friends at Reaper have been running a <a href=\"\
  http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1513061270/reaper-miniatures-bones-an-evolution-of-gaming-min\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter project</a> to ramp up their Bones miniatures line.</span>\
  \ Bones is the line that takes their award-winning metal minis and makes them much\
  \ more affordable by casting them in an amazing plastic material. (Like Reaper's\
  \ metal minis, Bones are unpainted.) We have a number of Bones minis in the Paizo\
  \ offices and everyone is amazed by them. </p> \n    <p>So why the Kickstarter?\
  \ Well, the molds to make plastic miniatures cost a LOT more than molds to make\
  \ metal. So even though Bones have been well received and are selling very well,\
  \ Reaper has only been able to add to the line slowly—until now. Their Kickstarter\
  \ project is going to allow them to jumpstart the process and make a lot more affordable\
  \ Bones figures. They started with a very reasonable $20,000 goal that they quickly\
  \ smashed through! They have passed the $565,000 goal as I type this—a truly remarkable\
  \ feat!</p> \n    <p>So what does this have to do with you as a Paizo customer?\
  \ I'm glad you asked! Reaper has just announced their first Pathfinder Bones stretch\
  \ goal. The \"We Be Goblins\" stretch goal will bring nine Pathfinder goblin minis\
  \ to the Bones line. Yep, you heard that right—nine!</p> \n    <p>The purpose of\
  \ this blog is let you know about Pathfinder Bones, but it's also a heads-up from\
  \ one gaming friend to another about this amazing Kickstarter. If you use miniatures\
  \ at all in your game, you're going to want to get involved in this Kickstarter.\
  \ You can support it at a number of different levels, but I really want to draw\
  \ your attention to what Reaper calls the \"Vampire\" level, for backers who kick\
  \ in $100. When this Kickstarter began, you got 30 Bones miniatures for that $100.\
  \ Well, because Reaper keeps reaching more and more stretch goals, that $100 pledge\
  \ currently gets you 132 Bones miniatures and a special metal Sophie (their iconic\
  \ succubus) for that same $100 pledge! And it's only going to get better—the \"\
  Vampire\" level is where the Pathfinder goblins will kick in!</p> \n    <p>When\
  \ I personally got in on this Kickstarter, my $100 got me 44 miniatures. Now, because\
  \ of the pledges of other gaming fans out there like me, I am getting the 132 figures\
  \ plus the Sophie. And it is going to become even more because of the way the Kickstarter\
  \ stretch goals work. As more and more people join into the Kickstarter at any level,\
  \ but especially the Vampire level, we will pass more stretch goals and more minis\
  \ will be added to my $100 Vampire reward level. At $605,000, we Vampire-level backers\
  \ will all get 4 very cool demon miniatures, bringing our new total to 136. And\
  \ then when the stretch goal after that gets hit—boom—NINE Pathfinder goblins added\
  \ for the same $100 pledge. And each stretch goal gets you more cool minis.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>You can see why I wanted to tell you about this. Right now, backers are\
  \ getting Bones minis for well under a buck apiece—this is by far the best deal\
  \ in miniatures that I have ever seen. And as more people join in, it gets better\
  \ and better for all of us. And for Reaper, because they'll be able to get a whole\
  \ bunch of new Bones figures out there.</p> \n    <p>There are nine days left in\
  \ the Reaper Bones Kickstarter—it ends Saturday, August 25 at 6pm EST. If you are\
  \ at all interested in miniatures, seriously think about pledging to this Kickstarter.\
  \ What a great way to grow your miniatures collection AND help out a great game\
  \ company like Reaper. (And I've been told that there is another Pathfinder stretch\
  \ goal buried in that crypt somewhere. Can't wait to find out what it is!)</p> \n\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Bones are the best plastic gaming models\
  \ to hit the industry in the last decade. We've taken the best miniatures in the\
  \ Reaper product line and converted them into plastic - high quality, low price.\
  \ What more could you ask for? For more info, <a href=\"http://www.reapermini.com/Bones\"\

  \ \n    <p><a href=\"http://www.reapermini.com/kickstarter\" target=\"_blank\">Reaper\
  \ Miniatures Bones Kickstarter</a> is a project to ramp up the production of the\
  \ Bones plastic miniatures line and to get you the miniatures you want now! And\
  \ to make things even better, we're adding our officially licensed Pathfinder Miniatures\
  \ line to our project!</p> \n    <p>Since the launch of Bones in March 2012, a full\
  \ third of the figures we ship are Bones plastic gaming miniatures. We have eight\
  \ pages of Bones suggestions going in our forum. It's clear that our fans want more\
  \ of these Bones figures. And why not? They're awesome sculpts at a terrific price!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As it turns out, they're also really expensive to produce. The mold costs\
  \ alone are astronomical. In order to grow this line, we can do it slow and steady\
  \ over the next several years, or we can defer to you guys and launch a bunch of\
  \ new ones as soon as possible. By the end of the year, we anticipate having 30\
  \ products in the Bones line. What this Kickstarter will do is at least double the\
  \ Bones line to 60 total models: character models, new sculpts, big monsters...\
  \ the sky's pretty much the limit.</p> \n    <p>All we need to kickstart this thing\
  \ is your support.</p> \n    <p><b>What Do I Get For Supporting You?</b></p> \n\
  \    <p>We have a number of opportunities available for our supporters. </p>\n \
  \   <p>These include, but are not limited to, various apparel items, a chance to\
  \ receive each of the new 30 Bones plastic models, a metal Kickstarter-exclusive\
  \ Sophie model, Design-Your-Own-Miniature packages, not to mention some of the most\
  \ valuable one of a kind Crown Jewel items from the Reaper archives. (And we have\
  \ some incredible stretch goals in mind – we remain ever optimistic!)</p> \n   \
  \ <p><b>Something for everyone who loves miniature gaming.</b></p> \n    <p>Now\
  \ we're offering some of the most popular miniatures from the officially licensed\
  \ Pathfinder Miniatures range. What do you have to do to get these Pathfinder Bones\
  \ miniatures? Simple! All you have to do is pledge either the <b>Vampire</b> or\
  \ <b>Undertaker</b> Levels from the Pledge List, and if we hit the Pathfinder Bones\
  \ stretch goal, they'll be added to your Pledge Level at no additional charge! And\
  \ if you want extras, simply add them to your pledge amount.</p> \n    <p>The first\
  \ Pathfinder Bones stretch goal has been revealed. Go join in and pledge to the\
  \ Reaper Miniatures Kickstarter project and bring them to life for everyone to enjoy!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Kickstarter has funded, and in fact, it is now over $500,000 and\
  \ at this point It has been running for over 20 days. There's just over a week left\
  \ until the project closes on August 25th 2012 at 5:00pm CST. Hurry and get involved\
  \ and let's see how many Pathfinder Bones we can uncover!</p> \n    <p align=\"\
