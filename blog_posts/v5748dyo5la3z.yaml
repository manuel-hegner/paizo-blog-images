  date\">Tuesday, November 6, 2007</p> \n   <p>After combing through more than 150\
  \ initial queries and almost a dozen detailed outlines, we have finally found our\
  \ winner of the GameMastery Open Call contest. The winner will write <i>GameMastery\
  \ Module W3: Flight of the Red Raven</i>. Scarce information about the plot was\
  \ given out, and the entrants had to combine that, along with the title, to come\
  \ up with a compelling adventure full of exciting encounters and memorable villains.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>In the end, David Schwartz came out on top. David's proposal hit\
  \ a nerve with the staff, as his submission was both well-written and full of evocative\
  \ scenes. This adventure is slated to hit store shelves in May 2008. While you might\
  \ not see any more news on this one for a while (as David will be busy writing it!),\
  \ here is a revised blurb describing David's adventure, along with our mock-up cover:</p>\

  \ been stolen from the town of Azurestone and the notorious Red Raven is the culprit.\
  \ With a terrible winter setting in, the small community faces a gruesome fate without\
  \ its protection. To recover the Key, the heroes must face off against brazen outlaws,\
  \ freezing weather, and dangerous predators, but the trail leads to even greater\
  \ peril. For the Red Raven's path heads straight into the Jarl's Prison, a maze\
  \ of ice and snow from which there is no escape!</i></p> \n   <p>Hearty congratulations\
  \ go out to all of our finalists. Picking one of them as the winner was not easy\
  \ task, as any one of them might have made for a great adventure. And don't forget,\
  \ for all those who didn't win this contest, there's still plenty of time to enter\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a> and make your big\
  \ break that way! </p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn <br>GameMastery Brand Manager</p> \n\
