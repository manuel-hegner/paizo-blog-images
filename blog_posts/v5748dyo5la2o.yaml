  \   <p>Back on November 14th, we had a sort of cryptic post here on the blog. Well,\
  \ more of a warning, really: \"THE YETI IS COMING!\" Well, later this month, the\
  \ yeti will arrive—just one of many dangers awaiting the PCs in \"Spires of Xin-Shalast,\"\
  \ the final adventure in Rise of the Runelords. <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpw\"\
  >Pathfinder</a></i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpw\"> #6</a> also presents a short\
  \ article that talks about other dangers that await any who dare explore the Kodar\
  \ Mountains, one of Golarion's most inhospitable regions. This article opens with\
  \ some words of advice from one of Varisia's most widely traveled explorers—the\
  \ currently missing Ronagard Roteshield. </p>\n   <p><i>\"The cold's not your enemy.\
  \ No, when you get it in your fool head to go gallivanting up to the top of the\
  \ world, there's plenty else to be worried of. Up there, there's mountains that\
  \ roar and try to eat you alive. There's air that quits caring and does you about\
  \ as much good as trying to breathe a lake. There's rock that's solid as a fortress\
  \ wall 'til it's the only thing holding you over a gap a mile deep. And then there's\
  \ the things. The snowy, hungry things that don't let anything made of meat just\
  \ pass on by. </i></p> \n   <p><i>\"The cold, though, it'll kill you slow and quiet.\
  \ It'll be there when you're fallen and broken, half-eaten at the bottom of some\
  \ ravine. It'll make the hurting stop, wrap you up in that dull, soft numbness,\
  \ and make your forget any thought of climbing back down. </i></p> \n   <p><i>\"\
  No, the cold's not your enemy. Up there, it's the best friend you've got.\" </i></p>\
