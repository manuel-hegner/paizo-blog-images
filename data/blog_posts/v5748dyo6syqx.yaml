  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">From first light\
  \ to sunset, the Indraracha Institute bustles with activity. The docks continually\
  \ ferry people in and out of the campus. Meal, study, repeat—every day is a routine\
  \ at the academy, a routine strengthening the minds and sharpening the skills of\
  \ the future sorcerers and politicians of Tang Mai.</p>\n      <p>For one young\
  \ boy, though, things were different. School was just school. Sometimes, all he\
  \ wanted to do was to just run around, not bury himself nose-deep in a book about\
  \ the nation’s history. One morning, he was doing just that—running through the\
  \ halls of the Institute, weaving between his classmates that filled rooms and corridors\
  \ studying all things magical.</p>\n      <p>Asok’s circuit ended in one of the\
  \ many gardens. Resting under a tall banyan tree, the boy began to doze off. He\
  \ snapped his eyes open when he heard a familiar voice.</p>\n      <p>“What are\
  \ you doing here?” A tattooed young man strode over, a basket of herbs in hand.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Thanom!” The boy scrambled up to his feet, putting his hands together\
  \ in a greeting. “I’m just on my way to study hall... unless you need help in the\
  \ gardens?” He gave a wide grin.</p>\n      <p>“And take you away from your studies?\
  \ Your instructors will have my head! And if I’m gone, there will be even fewer\
  \ people who tolerate your behavior.” He pulled out a mangosteen and handed the\
  \ fruit to Asok. “Now go to class. Next time I need help, <em>I’ll</em> come to\
  \ <em>you</em>. When you’re not trying to hide from your instructors.”</p>\n   \
  \   <p>Asok gave another huge grin to the alchemist before rushing off to his class,\
  \ conveniently located in a quieter corner of the Institute. He tucked himself alongside\
  \ his classmates as they all settled in, twisting open the mangosteen and eating\
  \ the meat inside. Mali, his seatmate, glared. In return, he smiled and offered\
  \ a piece to her, but she turned her head away in annoyance.</p>\n      <p>“Remember,\
  \ students, placement tests are coming up soon. While you all are young, it’s important\
  \ you take your exams seriously.” Teacher Chai walked around, handing out textbooks.\
  \ “We want to make sure you all end up learning subjects you enjoy and excel at.”\
  </p>\n      <p>Asok opened the book to the lines, “Sorcerer diplomats provide the\
  \ Chaophaya counsel and identify magical phenomena to aid them in their rule. Following\
  \ the precepts of the Indraracha Institute, diplomats must be impartial...” The\
  \ text was dizzying.</p>\n      <p>“Aiyyyyy, I’m tired,” he groaned.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>“Shhhhh!” Mali nudged him. “Stop complaining. You’re going to get us in trouble.”\
  </p>\n      <p>“It’s hot and it’s sooooo boring.” Asok began fanning himself with\
  \ the textbook.</p>\n      <p>“It’s always hot,” the girl reminded him, “and you\
  \ say everything is boring.”</p>\n      <p>Asok nudged her back. In a huff, they\
  \ both started jostling each other, though mostly in jest.</p>\n      <p>Their instructor\
  \ eyed them with suspicion, but before he could say anything, sparks coalesced in\
  \ the air.</p>\n      <p>“Teacher Chai!” An illusion of an older student sprung\
  \ into being. “Apologies for the disturbance—we could use some assistance with an\
  \ artifact in the south research laboratory.”</p>\n      <p>“Of course. Right away.”\
  \ The instructor turned to the class, saying, “Now, students, be diligent while\
  \ I’m gone,” before hurrying out.</p>\n      <p>In the heat and humidity, diligent\
  \ self-study didn’t last long. Mischievous as ever, Asok got to his feet and reached\
  \ for the magic within him. A small flame sparked to life in his hand.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>“Asok, stop,” Mali chided. “You shouldn’t be doing that.”</p>\n      <p>“\
  Come on, we’re studying, right?” Asok juggled the flame between his fingers. “If\
  \ we don’t break anything, it’s fine. Unless you’re a scaredy-cat?”</p>\n      <div\

  \ <p>“Am not!” She frowned before standing up, a spell coming to her as easy as\
  \ breath. “You know I’m sooooo much better than you at casting.”</p>\n      <p>Students\
  \ discarded their textbooks and started chatting among themselves. In a moment,\
  \ the alcove filled with all sorts of spells. A young nagaji girl conjured a bubble\
  \ of water and began shaping it into a flower. Another student drew a monstrous\
  \ face on a nearby stone before levitating it to chase their classmates through\
  \ the alcove.</p>\n      <p>Between the two rival factions, a heated competition\
  \ quickly drew the class’s attention. Mali shot her hand up in the air, spraying\
  \ an array of bright colors. The crowd was mesmerized with the lights. She gave\
  \ her opponent a playful grin.</p>\n      <p>Asok huffed, “It’s just colors—isn’\
  t this so much cooler?” He caught the ember in his fist before shooting it out.\
  \ The small burst of fire cut through the rainbow. The boy puffed his chest in pride.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The “oooohs” from the crowd turned to a giggle as Mali wiggled her fingers\
  \ and a second image of Asok appeared next to him. While crude, the illusion was\
  \ unmistakably of the boy. It hopped around, flexing in an exaggerated manner. Asok\
  \ frowned at his double, which frowned back.</p>\n      <p>Not to be outdone, Asok\
  \ threw his memory and being back into his blood, finding the might of elementals.\
  \ He breathed in deep before releasing a gust of flame that spilled from his lips\
  \ and billowed outwards. The fire dispersed the illusion before launching upward\
  \ to the sky. Asok was careful to not let it hit Mali or their classmates, but the\
  \ size of the breath was growing larger than he could control. The expanding heat\
  \ licked the roof of the outdoor galleries that surrounded their study area, lighting\
  \ up small pieces of foliage.</p>\n      <p>“Asok! Look what you did,” Mali yelled,\
  \ taking a step back from the sparks.</p>\n      <p>“I didn’t mean to,” Asok stammered,\
  \ ashamed about his mistake. “I—I’m sorry!”</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;“Come on, we have\
  \ to stop this before Teacher Chai comes back.”</p>\n      <p>The nagaji student\
  \ guided her water magic to the fire. While it extinguished some of it, the flames\
  \ were spreading faster than she could handle. The class chipped in with various\
  \ spells, with little impact.</p>\n      <p>Suddenly, a chill wind gusted through\
  \ the alcove, frost trailing in its wake and collecting on the stones. The winds\
  \ roared across the roof, blowing the fires out as easily as candles, making Asok\
  \ and Mali shiver and clutch their arms close despite the fires and the Tang Mai\
  \ sun. Turning around, the students saw Teacher Chai with an expressionless face,\
  \ magic still trailing from his fingers as his incantation left him.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>“Spellcraft is not allowed without instructor supervision at your age.” Teacher\
  \ Chai said sternly as he walked toward the panicked students. “I expected as much\
  \ from you, Asok. But you, Mali...”</p>\n      <p>“I—I—I’m sorry, Teacher!” Mali\
  \ bowed her head, “We tried to stop it ourselves. We know it was wrong, but—”</p>\n\
  \      <p>The teacher put a hand up to stop the student. “While you all showed responsibility\
  \ in fixing your mistakes, magic is volatile. One misstep, one wrong incantation,\
  \ can cause chaos. Now, back to your studies.”</p>\n      <p>As the young students\
  \ began to quiet down and shrink themselves back into their texts, Teacher Chai\
  \ looked at Asok and Mali. “Though, I must admit it was quite the impressive feat.\
  \ You two have the makings of incredible sorcerers.”</p>\n     </blockquote>\n \
