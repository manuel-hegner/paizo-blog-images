  description\">Last October the Venture-Officers became aware of some family health\
  \ issues that caused a change in my employment status at Paizo and I was allowed\
  \ to telecommute. This change led my family and I to make the move from Seattle\
  \ to the New Orleans area. This has worked fairly well for almost a year as I traveled\
  \ to Paizo from New Orleans regularly but, as with most situations, things continue\
  \ to evolve and my work status is changing yet again.</p> \n    <p>It is with a\
  \ sad heart I announce today that my tenure with Paizo will end on August 7. This\
  \ should allow me to say personal goodbyes at both PaizoCon UK and Gen Con. The\
  \ day after I leave my position, I will be closing my public Campaign Coordinator\
  \ Facebook page as well.</p> \n    <p>It has been a pleasure working with, and for,\
  \ all of you. I was always taught to leave a situation better than I entered it.\
  \ I hope I have done that. Some changes I take pride in being heavily involved with\
  \ are:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Updating the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><em>Guide</em></a>\
  \ with a more professional appearance and outline</li> \n     <li>Implementing <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8vq7\"><em>GM 101</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy919f\"\
  ><em>GM 201</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8vq8\"><em>Kid's Track</em></a>\
  \ (with the help of some awesome VOs)</li> \n     <li>Expanding our volunteer base\
  \ from 13 VOs to more than 470</li> \n     <li>Growing the playerbase from around\
  \ 12,000 to more than 60,000</li> \n     <li>Expanding Pathfinder Society's presence\
  \ from 5 countries with an active PFS presence to 29 (including regions that had\
  \ little or no prior Organized Play)</li> \n     <li>I have also taken a great deal\
  \ of pride in watching PFS expand from one small room of 30 tables at Gen Con, to\
  \ taking over the entire Sagamore Ballroom (with 180 tables of PFS gaming this year!),\
  \ as well as numerous other activities planned for the space</li> \n     <li>Additionally,\
  \ I've been working with our Tech Team over the past few months on an array of improvements\
  \ to the Pathfinder Society section of paizo.com, and think you will approve of\
  \ the changes that are coming</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>There are many other changes\
  \ that I have initiated and been a part of, and I think have improved the overall\
  \ quality of Pathfinder Society, but are too numerous to list here.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ wish you all well. Again, thanks for the opportunity of letting me be the Global\
  \ Organized Play Coordinator for almost 4 full years.</p> \n    <p style=\"clear:\
