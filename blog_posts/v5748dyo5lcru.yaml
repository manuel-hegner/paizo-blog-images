  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Beginner Box</i></a>\
  \ and celebrate the biggest Pathfinder RPG release since the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"\
  ><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>? Then you’ll want to head to your local game store for\
  \ the Beginner Box Bash!</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >Venture-Captains</a> across the world are organizing gaming days on October 29th\
  \ and 30th to bring together Pathfinder players, debut the Beginner Box, teach new\
  \ gamers how to play, and introduce players new and old to the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play Program. The day’s events include four new, one-hour quests highlighting\
  \ the Beginner Box characters and rules. Special Beginner Box Bash punch cards allow\
  \ players to keep track of their adventures and learn more about the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG and Pathfinder Society. Those who complete all four adventures will receive\
  \ a special reward: a Pathfinder Society Chronicle sheet to welcome them into the\
  \ Pathfinder Society (or to enhance any existing Pathfinder Society character).</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ready to find out where and on what day the Beginner Box Bash is happening\
  \ in your area? Just check for your region on our <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/beginnerbox\"\
  ><b>Beginner Bash page</b></a> for all the locations currently signed up. This list\
  \ is still expanding, so be sure to check back for updates as we get closer to the\
  \ weekend of the 29th. Additionally, if you’re a game store owner, or want to get\
  \ your local game store involved in the Beginner Box Bash, there’s still time! Please\
  \ contact your regional <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >Venture-Captain</a> for details.</p> \n   <p>As always, we couldn’t pull off such\
  \ an exciting event without the help of all of our amazing Pathfinder Society Game\
  \ Masters. We know our Game Masters’ time is valuable, and we want to thank them\
  \ in advance for all their effort. To show our appreciation, all Game Masters who\
  \ run four events during the Beginner Box Bash can expect their own special Pathfinder\
  \ Society Chronicle sheet. If you’re a Pathfinder Society Game Master interested\
  \ in running games at your local Beginner Box Bash, please contact your local Venture\
  \ Captain for details.</p> \n   <p>Thanks to everyone for all their enthusiasm and\
  \ support for the <a href=\"/beginnerbox\"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Beginner\
  \ Box</i></a>, and we’ll see you at the Beginner Box Bash on October 29th and 30th!</p>\
