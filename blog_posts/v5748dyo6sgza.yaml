  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings everyone! I have\
  \ some good news, some neutral news, and a general conversation that I’m pretty\
  \ sure is also neutral (or at least not actively evil), so I’m going to open up\
  \ with the good news- Fall of Plaguestone is sanctioned! Assuming the technology\
  \ gods have not conspired against me once more, you should find those sanctioning\
  \ docs on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zoh?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Fall-of-Plaguestone\"\
  >Fall of Plaguestone</a> product page. But wait! I know you’re eager to start clicking\
  \ so you can collect your Chronicle sheet, but there’s a bit more to this conversation.</p>\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>You’re going to notice that this Chronicle sheet is\
  \ a bit different. It doesn’t specify a Tier, and the rewards are a bit different\
  \ than we’ve structured them in the past. There’s also only a single Chronicle sheet,\
  \ which is a hair different than you may have seen in past modules. So, here’s the\
  \ explanation for all of that. We want you to have more stuff that you can play\
  \ and use in PFS, and we want to get it to you quickly. We also want you to get\
  \ sanctioned materials faster than has happened in the past.</p> \n     <p>Flashback\
  \ to when I joined the organized play team two years ago. At that time, additional\
  \ resources sanctioning was 15 months out and we had 10-year-old adventure paths\
  \ that had never been sanctioned. Priorities always focused on scenarios first,\
  \ convention items second, and sanctioning third. A lot of my early work in the\
  \ department involved shrinking those numbers and getting materials in player’s\
  \ hands faster. That was going pretty well right up until around June of this year,\
  \ when the mad dash towards Gen Con began. The triple hit of increased scenario\
  \ production, launch of a new edition, and John Compton moving to the Starfinder\
  \ team took its toll on our workflow. Linda stepped up as organized play lead developer,\
  \ which meant that she has less bandwidth to help me out with scenario development\
  \ and so sanctioning slowed down. But it’s important to note, it never stopped.\
  \ The team spent chunks of our weekly meeting since mid-August looking at ways to\
  \ get materials sanctioned for use faster and let GMs and players take the shiny\
  \ modules and Adventure Path (AP) volumes they’ve been buying and use the treasures\
  \ presented therein with their organized play characters. We also fielded some concerns\
  \ from other departments about the way we had been sanctioning modules and adventure\
  \ paths, and those concerns happened to sync up with some of our own scheduling\
  \ and production issues.</p> \n     <p>Traditionally, the sanctioning process for\
  \ an AP or module required a developer to read the entire adventure path or module,\
  \ figure out a way to cut the material down to about 12 hours per module or volume\
  \ without making the story indecipherable, and then create the guidelines for that\
  \ new play window and the various Chronicle sheets that go along with it. This is\
  \ a pretty time-consuming process and must wait until all publication of all volumes\
  \ in the Adventure Path. It’s part of why you’re getting Fall of Plaguestone before\
  \ the final two PF1 adventure paths (which we’re absolutely still working on sanctioning\
  \ for those of you still enjoying the PF1 organized play campaign). Fall of Plaguestone\
  \ represents a new adventure sanctioning model that we <i>hope</i> is going to be\
  \ something you’ll enjoy, and which will allow us to sanction much faster than we\
  \ have in the past. The Chronicle sheet gives you access to all of the approved\
  \ treasures and other goodies presented in the module, one level’s worth of experience\
  \ for a character of your choice, and gold appropriate to a character of that level.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“One level?” you ask. Yep. This Chronicle is set up so that you can\
  \ play Fall of Plaguestone as it was intended to be played, with a non-PFS character\
  \ of the appropriate level, level up with that character when the module expects\
  \ you to, and then when the adventure is complete, take that Chronicle sheet and\
  \ apply it to any of your Pathfinder (second edition) organized play characters,\
  \ giving them a level up, a hefty bag of loot, and access to all kinds of uncommon\
  \ goodies. If this works, we’re going to do the same thing for Age of Ashes, and\
  \ it’ll mean we can do it a lot faster. We need your feedback on our system to know\
  \ if this will be the model going forward, so please post commentary below for our\
  \ team to review.</p> \n     <p>We realize that this might not be the ideal solution\
  \ for everyone. Some of you want that streamlined adventure with bits cut out to\
  \ make it fit in a two or three-block convention schedule. Our current understanding\
  \ of our player demographics is that those of you looking for thus trimmed versions\
  \ are both a very small percentage of the player base, but also some of our most\
  \ dedicated players. Ideally, we’d like everyone to get the full adventure experience\
  \ as the author intended, but we also don’t want those of you who enjoy those convention\
  \ marathon playthroughs to feel like you got the short end of the stick. Our potential\
  \ solution involves adding a section to the <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/encyclopedia/pfs2guide/\"\
  >organized play guide</a> discussing convention play and providing tips to GMs and\
  \ organizers on how to run these adventures in a way that fits into your slots and\
  \ would still allow you to receive and issue Chronicle sheets for completing the\
  \ playthrough. If that feels like a solution you think will work for you and the\
  \ way you play, please let me know in the comments below! This program exists for\
  \ you, our community, and we want to find the version of this that works best for\
  \ everyone. We cannot do this without comments, so please add your viewpoints on\
  \ our sanctioning ideas to the thread below.</p> \n     <p>Next week, join us for\
  \ scenario previews for both Pathfinder and Starfinder. Thank you all, and until\
  \ next time, Explore, Report, and Cooperate!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
