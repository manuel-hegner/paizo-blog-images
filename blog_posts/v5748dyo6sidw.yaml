  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Here’s a look behind the scenes at Paizo’s internal\
  \ playtests.</b></p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to one of our first\
  \ blogs following up on the recent announcement of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sidk?Starfinder-Second-Edition-is-Coming\"\
  >Starfinder Second Edition</a>! For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Thurston\
  \ Hillman, the Managing Creative Director for Starfinder. Basically, that means\
  \ that I guide the creative vision for the Starfinder brand, while also managing\
  \ the great folks who work on the Starfinder Roleplaying Game. Today, as we continue\
  \ our open playtest experience, I wanted to give you a behind-the-scenes look at\
  \ some of the internal playtesting we’ve been doing here at Paizo!</p> \n     <p>Up\
  \ until this point, the team has been doing some immediate stress tests of new classes\
  \ under the GMing stewardship of our Director of Game Design, Jason Bulmahn. These\
  \ involved some themed adventures about a starship that went too close to the Horizon\
  \ of an Event, or a deadly jungle encounter where we learned the creature hunting\
  \ us could bleed and so we could kill it. The playtests we’re reviewing here take\
  \ place after those, bypassing some of our rockier initial class design, and instead\
  \ focused on exploring some other aspects of Starfinder in a new game engine.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h2>Playtest #1: Streetsweep</h2> \n     <p><b>Map:</b> <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ejn?Starfinder-FlipMat-Enormous-Battlefield\"\
  >Starfinder Flip-Mat: Enormous Battlefield</a><br> <b>Character Level</b>: 5th</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Our initial playtests generally took place in confined environments,\
  \ or locations that forced some tight-quarters gameplay. This was great, because\
  \ we all know that there’s going to be a ton of adventures happening in cramped\
  \ starship corridors or on alien worlds with lots of dense foliage. However, those\
  \ situations are only a small part of the Starfinder experience. One element that\
  \ I’ve been passionate about—speaking as the developer who proverbially trademarked\
  \ “1 square = 30 feet” in an adventure I developed for Organized Play—was that we\
  \ needed to try out some open-area and long-range combats to make sure all these\
  \ futuristic guns and grenades we’ve been working on were going to be fun and balanced\
  \ in play.</p> \n     <p>Starring in this playtest:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><strong>GM:</strong>\
  \ Thurston Hillman (Managing Creative Director for Starfinder)</li> \n      <li><strong>Operative:</strong>\
  \ Jessica Catalan (Starfinder Society Developer)</li> \n      <li><strong>Mystic:</strong>\
  \ Dustin Knight (Starfinder Developer)</li> \n      <li><strong>Soldier:</strong>\
  \ GM NPC played by Thurston</li> \n      <li><strong>Witchwarper:</strong> Jenny\
  \ Jarzabski (Starfinder Senior Developer)</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>For a quick\
  \ recap of the classes at play here…</p> \n     <p>The <strong>operative</strong>\
  \ focuses on using guns and taking an aim action to get extra precision damage.\
  \ Jessica’s operative for this playtest was built to be a sniper (as opposed to\
  \ our iconic, who is more focused on using pistols at close range).</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ <strong>mystic</strong> class creates a bond with their party members and has\
  \ a vitality network that allows them to store Hit Points and deliver them to bonded\
  \ allies with a single action (for those clutch heals). Dustin attempted a test\
  \ build using the song connection to provide some buffs in addition to healing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The <strong>witchwarper</strong> class activates a quantum aura, which\
  \ creates bizarre effects and manipulates nearby space. Jenny’s witchwarper used\
  \ the precog anomaly to help control the flow of time in and around them (as well\
  \ as stacking grenades in their cheek pouches).</p> \n     <p>Finally, my <strong>soldier</strong>\
  \ was built using a bombard-focused style, packing a stellar cannon and a machine\
  \ gun to take advantage of being a kasatha and having four arms. For more info on\
  \ the soldier and how it plays, check out <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest\"\
  >Field Test #1</a>.</p> \n     <p>We got right into the action, with the party confronting\
  \ a group of Azlanti Star Empire Aeon Guards advancing through the streets of an\
  \ embattled city. These well-trained troops used an ability called “aeon advance”\
  \ that allowed them to spend a single action to move and fire their rifles if they\
  \ ended adjacent to another Azlanti ally. This led to a vicious opening salvo, as\
  \ the Aeon Guards had some exceptional initiative rolls, and advanced to slam a\
  \ withering fusillade of fire into the soldier. This also led to the enemies clustering\
  \ up, which turned out to be pretty useful in testing out how the soldier worked.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Once the PCs got to go, the situation quickly changed. Jessica’s operative\
  \ took their first shot and opened (naturally) with a critical hit. This single\
  \ shot dealt a whopping 2d12+2d6+1 damage, then doubled, then another 1d12 for the\
  \ extra fatal damage dice. This dealt in the 40s for damage and immediately popped\
  \ one of the Aeon Guards down, as they only had 30 Hit Points.</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ set the tone for the combat as the soldier began unleashing hell with their stellar\
  \ cannon, dealing regular damage to the clustered Aeon Guards. The mystic provided\
  \ spot healing through their vitality network, while the witchwarper opted to try\
  \ out grenades. Right now, the Starfinder team is experimenting with grenades as\
  \ placed area effects with a limited range and no attack roll that use a character’\
  s Class DC to determine targets’ saves. Our tactics were a success, and it didn’\
  t take long for the players to overcome this Moderate threat encounter.</p> \n \

  font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>The second encounter\
  \ of this playtest had the PCs advance further into the city, where they came under\
  \ fire from additional Aeon Guard ground troops, as well as a pair of Aeon Guard\
  \ snipers. These snipers held back and used a ported-over version of the “Sentry’\
  s Aim” action found on the Archer Sentry in the <em>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide</em>,\
  \ which let them sit back and fire with their long-range weapons and ignore cover\
  \ on targets—a VERY powerful ability. Currently, the operative’s aim action isn’\
  t quite this good, but NPCs get to cheat every once in a while!</p> \n     <p>What\
  \ stood out most about this fight was the use of a simple piece of terrain on the\
  \ map, a downed tree, for cover. Much of the combat saw both sides on opposite ends\
  \ of a toppled tree stump, each firing at one another and then taking cover for\
  \ increased AC against return fire. This led to a really fun and cinematic combat,\
  \ which also forced a “sniper duel” as Jessica’s operative had to battle the two\
  \ enemy snipers, one of which was almost 200 feet away, so far away they aren’t\
  \ even visible on the screenshots.</p> \n     <p>This fight had some other interesting\
  \ mechanics at play. The soldier fired a warning shot prior to the start of combat\
  \ to suppress one of the Aeon Guards, applying a combat penalty that actually stopped\
  \ the guards from hitting in the first round, and slowing their advance into cover\
  \ thanks to the suppressed condition (see Field Test #1 for detailed info on how\
  \ all this works). Our witchwarper was able to flush the Aeon Guards out of cover,\
  \ and then the mortal coil, by zipping forward with the help of magic and tossing\
  \ grenades into them as they clustered for cover behind the tree stump. Meanwhile,\
  \ the mystic continued to provide healing to everyone through their vitality network,\
  \ while also tossing out reliable offensive spells like <em>noise blast</em> to\
  \ help overcome immediate threats. The combat was over in round 5, thanks in part\
  \ to the precog’s aura giving a speed boost to allies that let them close the gap\
  \ with the snipers in short order.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>This was the end of\
  \ the playtest session. In the team’s debrief we discussed how area weapons were\
  \ overall way more effective on groups of enemies (big surprise, I know). This had\
  \ been a sticking point in our prior playtesting where enemies were spread out or\
  \ we battled single foes where the area damage didn’t make much difference. This\
  \ really made us think that the soldier might need more abilities to focus on single\
  \ targets, something we’re already started pondering. </p> \n     <p>It also got\
  \ us talking about adventure design and including options for encouraging creatures\
  \ to group up for benefits. The sniper operative was consistent, with strong capabilities\
  \ of popping lower-level threats through crits and dealing reliable damage with\
  \ their aimed shots, which made us concerned about the overall damage the class\
  \ could put out (more on that in our next playtest!). The mystic felt like it was\
  \ in a good place with how they could provide secondary healing while also actively\
  \ participating in battle. The witchwarper continues to be one that we fine tune,\
  \ as its quantum aura ability requires them to stay mobile and play close to enemies\
  \ to take advantage of some of their unique warp spells and effects.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Stay tuned for more behind-the-scenes looks at our playtests, news about our\
  \ ongoing releases, and discussions about Starfinder Second Edition!</p> \n    \
