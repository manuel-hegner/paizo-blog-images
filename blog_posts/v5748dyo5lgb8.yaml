  \ recent PaizoCon announcement of next year’s Giantslayer Adventure Path, it’s safe\
  \ to say that we have giants on the brain here at Paizo HQ. November’s <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy96kb?Pathfinder-Battles-Lost-Coast\">The Lost Coast</a>\
  \ set of prepainted fantasy miniatures from our partners at WizKids gave us the\
  \ perfect opportunity to add a few more giants to the growing ranks of <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ Large monsters. The set is technically “generic” in that it does not support a\
  \ specific <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Adventure Path</a>, but as I’ve\
  \ mentioned in previous Friday blogs, the Lost Coast location gives us plenty of\
  \ opportunity to revisit some familiar characters and concepts. </span></p> \n \

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up this week we have Conna the Wise, a semi-major\
  \ character in the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8tc0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Anniversary-Edition\"\
  ><em>Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</em></a> and our first ever female stone\
  \ giant miniature! Conna is an interesting character in that she is presented as\
  \ either a friend or a foe, and I always wanted to include her back when we did\
  \ our dedicated <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rqs?Pathfinder-Battles-Rise-of-the-Runelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> Pathfinder Battles set, but there just wasn’t room (or,\
  \ at the time, an appropriate illustration). I think she goes very well with her\
  \ stony brethren in that set. I hope to eventually produce female giants of all\
  \ of the standard giant types, and Conna is just the beginning of that trend (or\
  \ maybe more of the middle, if you consider the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8sft?Pathfinder-Battles-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Storm-Giant\"\
  >Storm Giant</a> from Rise of the Runelords). Conna the Wise is an uncommon, Large\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140718-Fire.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140718-Fire_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Fire Giant King, a mega-impressive\
  \ figure I’ve been waiting to unleash on the world since he was cut from the <a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8v0b?Pathfinder-Battles-Shattered-Star\"\
  >Shattered Star</a> set due to too many awesome Larges. Ironically, the image we\
  \ used as reference for this figure did not appear in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>, but from <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv4?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Giants-Revisited\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Giants Revisited</em></a>. Specifically, he is\
  \ Orynox Marchelin, king of the fire giant realm of Kragnaroth in the Mindspin Mountains\
  \ east of Varisia. The figure is cast in clear plastic, giving his hair a cool “\
  on fire” effect. The Fire Giant King ended up at the uncommon rarity, meaning those\
  \ of you buying cases might want to consider him more of a “Fire Giant Noble.” He\
  \ is, of course, a Large figure. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140718-Ogre.jpg\"> <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140718-Ogre_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This Hill Giant Chief originally appeared\
  \ in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\">Kingmaker Adventure Path</a>,\
  \ where he is a wandering giant called Munguk. I like to think his political fortunes\
  \ increased as he traveled west to the Lost Coast, to the point at which he now\
  \ rules a small, dim-witted tribe of fellow Hill Giants. The actual story is that\
  \ I fell in love with the picture and didn’t really care that this NPC doesn’t really\
  \ live in the Lost Coast region of Varisia. If you don’t tell anyone, I won’t, either.\
  \ Because, hey. Sweet mini. The Hill Giant Chief is a Large, uncommon figure. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>And that’s it for this week’s previews! Please join me next week as we\
  \ take a look at some more exciting images from <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy96kb?Pathfinder-Battles-Lost-Coast\"\
