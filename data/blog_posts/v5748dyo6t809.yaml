  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">One of my favorite places\
  \ aboard the <em>Zoetrope</em> was the menagerie, where I would tend to the flora\
  \ and fauna we’d taken aboard temporarily for further study. Unfortunately, things\
  \ were decidedly less peaceful this evening as I raced up the steps to the upper\
  \ deck, pausing to catch my breath before a small blue creature scampered past me\
  \ along the ship’s outer railing, giving me a dreadful start.</p>\n      <p>“She’\
  s still not eating, Baranthet.” Charikleia came around the side, gingerly navigating\
  \ the narrow space between the railing and the <em>Zoetrope</em>'s menagerie. Through\
  \ the structure’s glass walls—perfect for letting in natural light—I could see our\
  \ other specimens settling in for the evening amid the lush vegetation, under ballast\
  \ rocks, or near the drinking pond. The little blue creature, however, swiveled\
  \ her enormous amber ears in my direction as Chari spoke, resolutely ignoring the\
  \ seedcake in Chari’s hand.</p>\n      <p>“Hmmm.” I leaned down and peered at our\
  \ guest, who chirped plaintively at me in a way that sounded like speech. “Chari—\
  ”</p>\n      <p>“I agree,” she said, already scribbling notes. “That sounded like\
  \ language. Can you understand us, little one?”</p>\n      <p>The creature surveyed\
  \ us solemnly, then without warning sprang from the railing and scrambled through\
  \ a window.</p>\n      <p>I let out a rather undignified yelp of surprise and hustled\
  \ to the nearest door, Chari following soon after. Dr. Pom was at the helm this\
  \ evening (she was always a bit more alert at night), and the <em>Zoetrope</em>\
  \ was well underway; we couldn’t have our small guest accidentally falling overboard!</p>\n\
  \      <p>The tiny patter of paws overhead led us upstairs to the mess deck, where,\
  \ sure enough, the creature perched in the doorway to Grefu’s kitchen, sniffing\
  \ the air with a disappointed look.</p>\n      <p>“Well now, who’s this?” Grefu\
  \ turned from a simmering pot and looked from the creature to us. “I didn’t set\
  \ a place for an honored guest.”</p>\n      <p>She emitted the sound—a word?—again,\
  \ but Grefu looked as nonplussed as the rest of us.</p>\n      <p>“Well, it’s not\
  \ Jotun or Thalassic,” muttered Chari, surely making a mental note for our records.\
  \ Before I could reply, the creature shot between the legs of the chairs and dining\
  \ table and tore back downstairs. Grefu shrugged and returned to his work as Chari\
  \ and I gave chase.</p>\n      <p>The creature was perched on a crate as we came\
  \ downstairs to the storage area but looked almost disapprovingly at us before scrambling\
  \ down the stairs to the next flight. We heard a “Goodness! What—?” from Dr. Pom\
  \ as the creature chirped at her and continued down another level, then a clang\
  \ a few seconds later. She must have already reached the engine room on the next\
  \ deck down.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/78fecfcc-a8e9-4151-83f5-f6f4ffbe7b47/Marp_2000x2130.png\"\

  Hey; I need that!” called Ten as the creature emerged clutching a small gear in\
  \ her hands. She chirped at them, placed the gear gently on the ground, and took\
  \ off once more.</p>\n      <p>“She’s very energetic,” I observed to Chari, pausing\
  \ to catch my breath.</p>\n      <p>“And she’s not speaking Surki either,” said\
  \ Chari, who seemed unaffected by our unexpected evening exercise. “Oh no!”</p>\n\
  \      <p>We heard a distant splash and ran down another level to find the creature\
  \ sputtering and pulling herself out of the access pipe leading down to the aquatic\
  \ deck. She looked rather affronted as Lythea swam up the pipe and broke the surface,\
  \ inadvertently splashing a few droplets onto the creature’s head.</p>\n      <p>“\
  So sorry, little one,” our navigator said, holding out a hand. “How can we help?”\
  </p>\n      <p>The creature instead clambered up onto Chari’s arm, flicking water\
  \ from her ears. She chirped again. It sounded so familiar! I was increasingly convinced\
  \ that lyrical chirp was, in fact, a word in a language I’d heard before.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“I’m going to stop for my notes before we go back up,” Chari called over\
  \ her shoulder, turning down the hall toward the crew quarters. I followed her,\
  \ thinking to peruse my own small collection and check again for any clues as to\
  \ this creature’s identity.</p>\n      <p>“Professor, is that you?” Telero opened\
  \ the door at the end of the hall, emerging from the shuttle bay just as I stepped\
  \ into my own room. “Hey, who’s this?”</p>\n      <p>The creature, catching a glimpse\
  \ of the darkening sky through the branches of the shuttle bay door, squawked and\
  \ leapt from Chari’s shoulder to her head, climbing up one of her horns and chattering\
  \ at Telero. He quickly closed the door behind him and approached slowly. “Hey there,\
  \ it’s okay, friend,” he said. “You’re safe. What’s your name?”</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ creature blinked at him, then chirped that same familiar syllable.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>Telero frowned in confusion. “Gold?”</p>\n      <p>I’d become distracted while\
  \ opening the door to my own room, bemoaning the untidy stack of scrolls and maps\
  \ I’d meant to organize the previous day, but I turned at this. “Wait, did you say—\
  ?”</p>\n      <p>The creature leapt from Chari’s head and shot into my cabin, papers\
  \ flying as she disappeared under my desk. I crouched at once to see her clutching\
  \ my long-missing volume of <em>The Thrilling Tales of Spiridendra</em> (so that’\
  s where it had gone!). She chirped once more.</p>\n      <p>“She’s saying ‘gold’\
  \ in Fey,” Telero said, he and Chari crowding in behind me.</p>\n      <p>“Of course,”\
  \ I breathed, looking back up at Chari.</p>\n      <p>“A marp!”</p>\n      <p>“\
  They usually communicate in both Common and Fey, but perhaps this one is too young,”\
  \ I reasoned, reaching out for the book as she began to lick its gold embossing\
  \ experimentally. “Wait, please! I’ll trade you.” I slowly reached into my pocket\
  \ and withdrew a gold piece. “Would you like to return to the menagerie? We’ll make\
  \ sure you’re well fed!”</p>\n      <p>The marp reluctantly relinquished her grip,\
  \ but cheered up when she grasped the gold piece with her small hands. We climbed\
  \ back up to the menagerie, the marp riding on Chari’s shoulder and crunching happily.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The rest of the crew gathered around to exclaim over our guest and her\
  \ unique menu. (Ten dashed off and returned with an armful of metal scraps to see\
  \ if the marp found anything else to her liking, but as you’ll see in Charikleia’\
  s notes, gold remains the preferred meal.) As I looked around at my companions,\
  \ the moonlight streaming through the menagerie’s glass dome, a wave of joy overcame\
  \ me, as it has so often done on this journey—the joy of discovery, of reaching\
  \ shared understanding, and of building communities. The joy of belonging.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The <em>Zoetrope</em> hummed quietly under our feet, whisking us away\
  \ to our next adventure.</p>\n      <br>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n      <table\
