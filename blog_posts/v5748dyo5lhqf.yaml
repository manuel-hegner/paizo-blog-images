  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 17, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week, WizKids announced the release dates\
  \ for the next two <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\">Pathfinder Battles\
  \ Iconic Heroes</a> boxed sets of premium-quality prepainted plastic figures for\
  \ use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game.\
  \ This week, I'd like to take a closer look at three of the figures from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9f9q\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a>, which features familiar faces\
  \ from the <a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a> and\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\"><em>Ultimate Combat</em></a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150717-Lirianne.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150717-Lirianne_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>I want to start with Lirianne, Half-Elf Gunslinger today,\
  \ because I had a chance to review the paint master for this figure in-hand last\
  \ week, and I was really impressed with the overall improvement since Lirianne's\
  \ first miniature, which appeared in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"><em>Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles</em></a> set.</p> \n    <p>The original Lirianne is a perfectly\
  \ acceptable miniature, even a good one when you consider the amount of detail on\
  \ her outfit. But I was never completely thrilled with the way her face came out,\
  \ and overall the pose wasn't terribly exciting. With the <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a> version, Lirianne appears to be aiming or even\
  \ firing her gun, and overall the pose is much more dynamic and interesting. Coupled\
  \ with the superior paint jobs that are the hallmark of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  >Iconic Heroes</a> sets, this figure is well-positioned to end up looking really\
  \ spectacular.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150717-Hakon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150717-Hakon_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The iconic skald Hakon has always held a special place\
  \ in my heart. I had a chance to write his <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgac\"\
  >\"Meet the Iconics\"</a> backstory, where I not-so-subtly made him the brother\
  \ of my long-running character in Paizo Creative Director James Jacobs's office\
  \ Pathfinder campaign. So, in a way, Hakon is family, and it's been very important\
  \ to me that he get an amazing miniature!</p> \n    <p>I'm pleased to report that\
  \ WizKids definitely delivered on that score. Of the six paint masters we reviewed\
  \ in-hand last week, Hakon was my second favorite (after Shardra, whom we'll see\
  \ up close next week). Hakon definitely works as a skald, as a barbarian, as a ferocious\
  \ villain, or really as just about any axe-wielding maniac.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150717-Jirelle.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150717-Jirelle_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week is our iconic swashbuckler, Jirelle.\
  \ When Wayne Reynolds's original art first came in to Paizo I was thrilled and terrified,\
  \ all at the same time. Thrilled, because here we had a fully clothed, fully ass-kicking\
  \ woman warrior. Terrified because her costume was so complex I wondered how we\
  \ were ever going to do justice to it in miniature form. I shouldn't have worried.\
  \ That was before the advent of WizKids's super-premium <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  >Iconic Heroes</a> sets, which are more than up to the challenge. Once again, the\
  \ paint master for Jirelle looks wonderful, and is a great representation of the\
  \ character and the digital sculpt revealed above.</p> \n    <p>\"Hey,\" I can hear\
  \ some of you asking. \"If you've already seen paint masters, how come we only get\
  \ to see digital sculpts? Why are you holding out on the real thing, Mona?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>That's a fair question, and the answer is that the final figures in all\
  \ cases have sooooo many tampos—stamped-on details like face tattoos, clothing adornments,\
  \ and so on—that the paint masters wouldn't reveal an accurate look at what the\
  \ final figures will look like. They're very much a part of the process, in this\
  \ case, and I want to wait until I have samples with the tampos finished before\
  \ we show off actual minis. In the meantime, the digital sculpts I've revealed today\
  \ do a very good job of showing what we're shooting for.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9f9q\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a> hits stores and ships to subscribers\
  \ in November. I'll reveal the last three figures in the set next week, and after\
  \ that we're deep into Gen Con territory, and to see new <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> figures you'll have to track me down personally on the convention\
  \ floor, get them as a $50+ sales incentive at the Paizo booth, or play one of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society Specials.</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain,</p> \n    <p>Erik\
