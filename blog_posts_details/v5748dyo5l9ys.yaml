  artist: "R. A. Salvatore and Michael A. Stackpole. This week, rather than gushing\
    \ further about the book, I thought I'd just jump right into the snippetsâ€”after\
    \ all, anybody who wants to hear my opinion (or express their own) can always\
    \ jump over to the Planet Stories messageboards and chat with me, Erik, and the\
    \ rest of the crew at their leisure. So without further ado, I'd like to introduce\
    \ Jeff Grubb, whose fingerprints are undoubtedly all over your favorite game settings,\
    \ regardless of what they might be. In addition to rulebooks like the original\
    \ Manual of the Planes and D20 Modern, he's been heavily involved in novels, comics,\
    \ and design work for everything"
