  \ itemprop=\"description\">It's about time we wrap-up our previews for the Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild Gen Con 2017 releases. Moving away from the quest pack\
  \ and special we previewed in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk18?Pathfinding-to-Starfinding\"\
  >our last blog post</a>, today we're going to talk about scenarios #1-01, 1-02,\
  \ and 1-03!</p> \n    <p>I've previously gushed about Eleanor Ferron's work on <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-01: The Commencement</em></a> in some of our faction\
  \ blogs. This scenario follows in the footsteps of many Pathfinder Society \"evergreen\"\
  \ scenarios, like <a href=\"/products/btpy92ci?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-08-The-Confirmation\"\
  ><em>The Confirmation</em></a> and the venerable <a href=\"/products/btpy8jor?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-Intro-1-First-Steps-Part-I-In-Service-to-Lore\"\
  ><em>First Steps</em></a> (wow, now I feel old). Like those well-known introductory\
  \ Pathfinder scenarios, <em>The Commencement</em> is a repeatable scenario for characters\
  \ in Tier 1-2 where the PCs partake in some missions for four of the Society's primary\
  \ factions—sorry Second Seekers, but you get a whole season metaplot dedicated to\
  \ your missions! The Organized Play team agreed that <em>The Commencement</em> would\
  \ be an introduction to the Starfinder Society and our initial factions, so we knew\
  \ we wanted someone who could really take the skeletal outlines of our faction leaders\
  \ and run with them. If you've been reading the faction blogs, you can get a sense\
  \ of these faction leaders. When you play The Commencement, you'll see exactly how\
  \ superb a job that Eleanor Ferron has done in bringing each of these major NPCs\
  \ to life.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZOSFS0101E-Guidance.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <p>One scenario we haven't had a good chance to spotlight, at least until\
  \ now, is <a href=\"/products/btpy9tsy?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-102-Fugitive-on-the-Red-Planet\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-02: Fugitive on the Red Planet</em></a>. Let me be blunt:\
  \ this adventure takes place on Akiton and is our first attempt at telling a \"\
  space western\". Jim Groves, a longtime friend and longstanding Adventure Path and\
  \ organized play freelance author, took up the challenge of writing this scenario.\
  \ I knew Jim had really nailed the theme when I found myself humming a tune during\
  \ my development pass—a tune about \"a hero from some place\" and \"a man they call\
  \ something\". Beyond these obvious homages to western stories, there are some strong\
  \ connections to the greater Starfinder setting. This is our first view of Starfinder's\
  \ rendition of Akiton, as well as the introduction of some key Starfinder Society\
  \ issues brought forth by the disastrous Scoured Stars incident. My favorite aspect\
  \ of <em>Fugitive on the Red Planet</em> is the introduction of a particular shirren\
  \ NPC. I have noticed a lot of fans referring to Keskodai as \"bug dad\" in conversations;\
  \ well, this new NPC quickly became known as \"business bug\" during my development\
  \ pass.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9tt0?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-103-Yesteryears-Truth\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-03: Yesteryear's Truth</em></a> is our final Gen Con\
  \ 2017 Starfinder Society release. I have a strange professional relationship with\
  \ the author of this adventure, the incredibly talented Jason Keeley. It seems that\
  \ over the past year, Jason and I have been leapfrogging on developing each other's\
  \ work. Since Jason had just recently finished developing some of my text from the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, I figured\
  \ I needed to return the favor and offer him one of our launch scenarios so I could\
  \ get back in the development seat. The result is a scenario that I think a lot\
  \ of people are going to be talking about for quite some time. In <em>Yesteryear's\
  \ Truth</em>, the PCs set foot on a previously unexplored world wracked by a nuclear\
  \ war. This scenario has it all: starship combat, exploration, social encounters\
  \ with alien species, and even some archaeological discoveries with some hefty moral\
  \ quandaries. On top of all those things, this is our first scenario with a special\
  \ faction opportunity (denoted by the Faction tag on the adventure's credits page).\
  \ The Wayfinders, being a faction about exploration and peaceful first contact,\
  \ understandably have some vested interest in the PCs' success!</p> \n    <p>That's\
  \ it for Gen Con previews! I'm now in Indianapolis and getting ready for \"the best\
  \ four days in gaming.\" If you spot me at the convention—likely in the Sagamore\
  \ Ballroom—please feel free to say hi! Otherwise, we'll be back soon to talk about\
  \ the Starfinder Society its base of operations, the Lorespire Complex.</p> \n \
  \   <p><b>John's Note</b>: Need more playable Starfinder Society content? We've\
  \ also finished sanctioning the first volume of <a href=\"/products/btpy9tmf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Incident-at-Absalom-Station\"\
  ><em>Starfinder #1: Incident on Absalom Station</em></a>! Take a look at its product\
  \ page for a link to download the sanctioning document. We (okay, admittedly it's\
  \ more Thursty) will be sanctioning subsequent volumes closer to their respective\
  \ release dates.</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder Society Developer</i></p>\
