  \ \n     <p>2018 brought a lot of change, and with change comes a lot of work. Thankfully\
  \ we expanded the organized play team further this year, bringing on board Michael\
  \ Sayre to develop Pathfinder Society scenarios and power us into Season 10's exciting\
  \ stories. This has allowed the team as a whole to meet the demand for more Starfinder\
  \ Society content (increasing our publication rate to two per month), create four\
  \ Pathfinder Playtest scenarios, develop playtest surveys, and shape the future\
  \ of Pathfinder Society as a campaign. Starfinder Society wouldn't be what it is\
  \ without Thurston Hillman's creativity and long hours. All the while, Linda Zayas-Palmer\
  \ has handled so many scenarios while simultaneously taking the lead on Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Guild adventures.</p> \n     <p>It's probably because of all of\
  \ this new activity and new content that 2018's seemed so long! Let's see some of\
  \ the highlights!</p> \n     <h2>Pathfinder Society</h2> \n     <p>First off, we\
  \ had Pathfinder Society's the Season of Faction's Favor to wrap up, and that meant\
  \ delivering scenarios that addressed ongoing faction storylines in big ways. The\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-920-Fury-of-the-Final-Blade\"\
  >Liberty's Edge faction launched a daring raid into Galt</a> as <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4k?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-915-The-Bloodcove-Blockade\"\
  >the Exchange flexed its economic muscles</a> at long last to crush an unjust operation\
  \ in the Mwangi Expanse. <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-917-Oath-of-the-Overwatched\"\
  >The Dark Archive dug into the foundational lore of the Blakros Museum</a>, one\
  \ of the campaign's oldest touchstones, as the Silver Crusade returned from Heaven\
  \ (no biggie) in time to <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk3?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-919-Clash-in-Kaimuko-Wood\"\
  >crush a fiendish invasion</a>. The newly incorporated Concordance faction's hit\
  \ the ground running by shutting down <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4j?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-914-Down-the-Verdant-Path\"\
  >extraplanar rifts and cosmic anomalies</a>, and the <a href=\"/products/btpy9wer?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-907-Salvation-of-the-Sages\"\
  >Scarab Sages have settled on their laurels for the time being after 2017's powerful\
  \ capstone scenario</a>.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/OrganizedPlay/20121226-Urich.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/OrganizedPlay/20121226-Urich_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Illustration by Dion Harris</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ Sovereign Court had a big payoff in major crossover event with the <a href=\"\
  /store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/warForTheCrown\">War for the Crown Adventure\
  \ Path</a>, culminating in an opportunity to <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4h?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-913-The-Lions-Justice\"\
  >play out one of our most dramatic scenes of the year from multiple perspectives</a>.\
  \ But perhaps most notably of all, <a href=\"/products/btpya18i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-925-Betrayal-in-the-Bones\"\
  >the Society at last tracked down several of its oldest foes, defeating them decisively</a>\
  \ in the name of the Grand Lodge and Pathfinder Society. There's so much going on\
  \ that it's hard to really focus any one Season 9 scenario, so follow the links\
  \ and dig in for a wonderful experience.</p> \n     <p>Season 10 kicked off in style,\
  \ and the team's been relishing the opportunity to revisit some of the favorite\
  \ storylines and characters. Far and away, one of the most dramatic must be <a href=\"\
  /products/btq01vpj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1009-The-Rasping-Rebirth\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #10-09: The Rasping Rebirth</i></a> by Cole Kronewitter, which\
  \ not only addresses what the state of the Worldwound is since Season 5, but it\
  \ also allows the PCs to confront one of the campaign's greatest villains as players\
  \ have been requesting since, oh, <a href=\"/products/btpy8wdz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-4-19-The-Night-March-of-Kalkamedes\"\
  >the third scenario I ever developed</a>. We've worked to make choices matter in\
  \ scenarios, and Cole delivered a scenario that includes one of my absolute favorite\
  \ and powerful choices in the whole campaign.</p> \n     <p>This has also been a\
  \ year for exploring hitherto untouched realms, made all the more possible by Mike\
  \ Sayre's personal expertise. This really came through in <a href=\"/products/btpya1y2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1003-Death-On-The-Ice\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-03: Death on the Ice</i></a> by Scott Young,\
  \ taking us far north into the Crown of the World to resolve a dangerous issue resulting\
  \ from bad translations—remember to put a few ranks in Linguistics!</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ it's hard to overshadow the season's interactive special debut. Veteran author\
  \ Mike Kimmel stepped up to deliver one of the sharpest specials yet with <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Special #10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm</i></a>. It kicked off the latest\
  \ troubles in the Hao Jin Tapestry demiplane with style, allowing us to revisit\
  \ so many old plot threads in compelling vignettes that collectively told a much\
  \ bigger story. It benefited all the more from Linda taking the role of development\
  \ lead and bringing a fresh perspective to interactive specials that made this adventure's\
  \ energy all the greater.</p> \n     <h2>Starfinder Society</h2> \n     <p>Ah, did\
  \ someone say multi-table interactive specials? Starfinder Society—driven largely\
  \ by the development talents of Thurston Hillman—marked another milestone in the\
  \ young-yet-acclaimed campaign by launching its first large-scale event, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Special #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</i></a> by Mikko\
  \ Kallio. The Scoured Stars even has claimed the center stage in the ongoing Starfinder\
  \ Society narrative, and Mikko not only gave us one heck of a space opera confrontation\
  \ but also did so in a way that kept transitions smooth by introducing new opportunities\
  \ as the House did well, creating an experience in which the players (not the scenario)\
  \ really controlled the pacing.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \      <br><i>Illustration by Graey Erb</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>When I think\
  \ of influential scenarios, though, there are some absolute rock stars—literally.\
  \ Since she wrote the very first Starfinder Society scenario, Eleanor Ferron's had\
  \ the players demanding more of the in-world pop band Strawberry Machine Cake, and\
  \ she delivered a spiritual sequel with <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjx?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-114-Star-Sugar-Heartlove\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-14: Star Sugar Heartlove</i></a>. I think it's\
  \ really illustrative of the wonderful real-world tropes we get to play with in\
  \ Starfinder, and Thursty and I often throw scenario ideas at each that seem like\
  \ satirical jokes, only to realize that they're perfect for the setting and a few\
  \ stat blocks away from becoming fan-favorite adventures. The ever-handsome Vossi\
  \ is truly the mascot of this potential as he stars in <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjy?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-115-Save-the-Renkrodas\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-15: Save the Renkrodas</i></a> by Vanessa Hoskins,\
  \ who brought this delightful \"Save the Whales\" concept to life. Likewise, it\
  \ seems everyone's trying to be a celebrity after the reality tv show antics of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-09: Live Exploration Extreme!</i></a></p> \n\
  \     <p>But you know what might just win for the most influential scenario of 2018?\
  \ Which one inspired the cries of \"where can I find a mini for this\" followed\
  \ by a hundred epiphanies of \"I'll make my own and bring it to PaizoCon\"? It's\
  \ the same scenario that brought us the blubbery majesty of morlamaws, often remembered\
  \ as \"those psychedelic walruses.\" That's right, it's <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-108-Sanctuary-of-Drowned-Delight\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-08: Sanctuary of Drowned Delights</i></a> by\
  \ Kate Baker.</p> \n     <h2>Art</h2> \n     <p>We focus a lot on the authors and\
  \ stories when we tell these stories, yet we'd be remiss if we overlooked the artists\
  \ who illustrate our favorite villains, heroes, beasts, and scallywags—and the graphic\
  \ designers who make our scenarios so beautiful. Senior graphic designer Emily Crowell\
  \ has led the charge in evolving Pathfinder Society's look and layout, creating\
  \ so many pregenerated character and Chronicle sheet variants as we've continually\
  \ tinkered with their design. Her work makes me excited about the Second Edition\
  \ and the ways in which we can streamline our tracking sheets and make our pregenerated\
  \ characters more intuitive.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Illustration by Graey Erb</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>As for\
  \ illustrators, I've included some of our favorite pieces from the year. I also\
  \ want to call attention to Graey Erb for his extraordinary work in breathing life\
  \ into many of our most iconic creatures and characters. Most noteworthy among these\
  \ is the jinsul, the arch-nemesis of the Starfinder Society during Season 1. Thursty\
  \ and I came up with a basic visual concept for the jinsuls, all the while praying\
  \ that our art brief would translate well into the final image, and we were blown\
  \ away by result. I'm also appreciative of how senior graphic designer Adam Vick\
  \ has strengthened our campaign's visual continuity by having the same illustrator\
  \ depict multiple facets of a planet, species, or society. In this way Graey's really\
  \ made jinsuls his own unrighteous terrors.</p> \n     <p>Learn about him and our\
  \ other talented illustrators in our preview blogs (we make a point to credit them),\
  \ follow them on social media, support their work, and let them know you appreciate\
  \ their illustrations in the latest scenarios!</p> \n     <p>It's been a great year,\
  \ and we're looking ahead to a wonderful 2019!</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized\
