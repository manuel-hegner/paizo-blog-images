  ></a>\n   </div> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">A HUGE Announcement: Deadly Foes!</h1>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, March 11, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I'm thrilled to announce that the next set of\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic gaming\
  \ figures will be <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>! Deadly\
  \ Foes is a 45-figure \"full\" Pathfinder Battles set with 6 pieces of bonus \"\
  dungeon dressing\" randomly inserted into standard 4-piece booster boxes. The set's\
  \ general theme allows for a huge variety of high-utility monsters and allies, with\
  \ a focus on key creatures we've not yet produced and some exciting new surprises.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The biggest surprise, both literally and figuratively, is that the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set includes two HUGE figures\
  \ as its limited-edition case incentive! It's been a long, long time since we've\
  \ been able to include Huge creatures in Pathfinder Battles, for a number of largely\
  \ boring reasons related to production hurdles, form factors, and the like. I'm\
  \ thrilled to report that we worked with WizKids for a solution to this problem.\
  \ Past case incentive figures have been Gargantuan, the Pathfinder RPG size just\
  \ above Huge, and we'll continue to include Gargantuan case incentives when they\
  \ make sense. Mixing things up with our previous set, <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> was so successful that we're in an experimental\
  \ mood. And we've decided to experiment by making the <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcv\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em> Case Incentive</a> a two-pack of two of our favorite Huge\
  \ creatures: the Clockwork Dragon and the Spawn of Cthulhu!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72379-Dragon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72379-Dragon_500.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Here we have the insanely detailed Clockwork Dragon, from the\
  \ pages of <a href=\"/products/btpy91ds\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</em></a>!\
  \ The creature's neutral alignment makes it the perfect foe for good or evil characters,\
  \ and its looming size make it an impressive addition to any tabletop battle. The\
  \ art for this creature is one of my favorite pieces to ever appear in a Pathfinder\
  \ monster book, so I'm extra delighted to see it come to glorious three dimensions!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72379-Cthulhu.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72379-Cthulhu_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>\"That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange\
  \ aeons even death may die\" is not just a sweet line from a Metallica song, it's\
  \ also a key phrase in the mythology of American horror author H. P. Lovecraft,\
  \ creator of the Cthulhu Mythos. It's also the inspiration for Pathfinder's next\
  \ Adventure Path, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\">Strange Aeons</a>,\
  \ which launches in August. Here we have the dreaded Spawn of Cthulhu as it emerges\
  \ from the water to destroy the sanity of your player characters. The world has\
  \ seen a lot of Cthulhu miniatures over the years, but I've never quite seen one\
  \ emerging from the ocean like this guy. WizKids's brilliance with clear water effects\
  \ is sure to make this a distinctive, pants-ruining experience for your players\
  \ when you plop down the Big C on your game table.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this\
  \ week! I've got a ton of other images to show for this set, but it's unfortunately\
  \ going to take two weeks to get to them. I'm off to the GAMA Trade Show in Las\
  \ Vegas on Monday, and will be out for the entire week. I will try to get a blog\
  \ completed while I am on the road, but I expect to be very, very busy next week\
  \ and don't want to make any promises I can't keep.</p> \n    <p>But I did promise\
  \ the Huge figures would reappear in <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>,\
  \ so I think you can count on my word!</p> \n    <p>Until the stars are right, I\
  \ remain,</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
