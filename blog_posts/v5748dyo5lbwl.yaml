  date\">Wednesday, February 16, 2011</p> \n   <p>In the next month or so the next\
  \ book in our Pathfinder Player Companion line will be released. <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/v5748btpy8g7f\"\
  ><i>Faiths of Purity</i></a> isn't a book about the gods. It's not even just about\
  \ their clerics. It's really a book about the vast masses of the faithful, the worshipers\
  \ of the gods of absolute good and their place on Golarion. It's about the living\
  \ religion, and how that religion ties into the everyday lives of its followers.\
  \ More importantly, it outlines the role of adventurers in the faith, and why an\
  \ adventurer might choose a particular god—not merely because the god's alignment\
  \ matches, or because the best spells come from his domains, but because your philosophies\
  \ match. Most importantly, it's about how your story can encompass faith, and how\
  \ a myriad of different heroic characters can battle evil and live in the light\
  \ of the gods.</p> \n   <p>This is an awesome book that focuses on the seven major\
  \ good-aligned gods, provides an outline of the god in question, and summarizes\
  \ the deity's domains and interests, and why that god might be a good fit for your\
  \ character. In addition to new feats, spells, and write-ups on different organizations\
  \ officially sanctioned by the various churches, <i>Faiths of Purity</i> also discusses\
  \ the various codes paladins of the different good gods live by. As a teaser, here's\
  \ the code that paladins of Shelyn (yes, she has paladins) follow:</p> \n  </blockquote>\
  \ \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <table hspace=\"9\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\"\
  \ cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n    <tbody>\n     <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9416-ShelynPaladin_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a></td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" class=\"\
  tiny\">Illustration by Sara Forlenza</td>\n     </tr>\n    </tbody>\n   </table>\n\
  \  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p>Paladins of Shelyn are peaceable\
  \ promoters of art and beauty. They see the ugliness in evil, even when cloaked\
  \ in the form of beauty, and their job is to prevent the weak and foolish from being\
  \ seduced by false promises. Their tenets include:</p>\n    <ul> \n     <li>I am\
  \ peaceful. I come first with a rose. I act to prevent conflict before it blossoms.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>I never strike first, unless it is the only way to protect the innocent.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>I accept surrender if my opponent can be redeemed—and I never assume\
  \ that they cannot be. All things that live love beauty, and I will show beauty's\
  \ answer to them.</li> \n     <li>I will never destroy a work of art, nor allow\
  \ one to come to harm unless greater art arises from its loss. I will only sacrifice\
  \ art if doing so allows me to save a life, for untold beauty can arise from an\
  \ awakened soul.</li> \n     <li>I see beauty in others. As a rough stone hides\
  \ a diamond, a drab face may hide the heart of a saint.</li> \n     <li>I lead by\
  \ example, not with my blade. Where my blade passes, a life is cut short, and the\
  \ world's potential for beauty is lessened.</li> \n     <li>I live my life as art.\
  \ I will choose an art and perfect it. When I have mastered it, I will choose another.\
  \ The works I leave behind make life richer for those who follow.</li>\n    </ul>\n\
