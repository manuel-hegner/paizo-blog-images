  \ that Erik Keith, who has been a pillar of the Customer Service team, is moving\
  \ over and up into new and exciting things. At the beginning of September, Erik\
  \ transitioned into his new role as Paizo's Software Test Engineer. I am both excited\
  \ for him as he takes on this new role, and also a little sad that I will no longer\
  \ get to work next to someone who has become not only someone I enjoy working with,\
  \ but a friend as well. While Erik won't be directly assisting customers with their\
  \ orders or issues, he will still be helping fans and the Paizo community, albeit\
  \ in a more abstract manner. He will be using his extensive knowledge of our internal\
  \ software to help the Tech Team test new code and features that will make our customers\
  \ and our employees' experience better.</span></p> \n    <p>Erik has been with the\
  \ Customer Service team for three years. It will be impossible to find someone with\
  \ his same spirit and natural skill for helping people, but I couldn't be happier\
  \ to see him launching into this new career opportunity.</p> \n    <p style=\"clear:\
