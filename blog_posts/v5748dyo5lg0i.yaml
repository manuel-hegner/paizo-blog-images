  \ Like A Little Conflict?</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 29, 2014</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The\
  \ release of <a href=\"”/products/btpy95b1”\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner\
  \ Sea Combat</i></a> is approaching, and it's a book I'm particularly proud of.\
  \ Since I've taken over the Pathfinder Campaign Setting line, we've released a number\
  \ of books, but this one is perhaps the most jam-packed with amazing new rules and\
  \ thematic elements of the lot. Just about every page has something on it that makes\
  \ me want to run a new campaign or build a new character. If only I had the time\
  \ to do so! But as a developer, I often game vicariously through the players and\
  \ GMs who use the content I have a hand in delivering, and I can't wait to hear\
  \ what fun you fine folks have with this one!</span></p> \n    <p>Let me show off\
  \ a few of my favorite pieces of art from the book, and tell you what about these\
  \ images and the content related to them really excites me.</p> \n    <p>First we\
  \ have this amazing half-page chapter opener by Jason Rainville, of Sajan sparring\
  \ with a fellow monk. She's proof positive that an <i>amulet of mighty fists</i>\
  \ doesn't just affect your hands. This illustrates the chapter on new combat schools\
  \ of the Inner Sea, including gladiatorial arenas like the orc-run Bloodworks in\
  \ Urglin, dojos like the Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray, war colleges such as\
  \ Ironstock Hall in Alkenstar and Brevoy's Aldori Academy, and thieves' guilds like\
  \ the Bloody Barbers of Absalom. Players can join schools to gain new abilities\
  \ to represent their training, as long as they can make the grade.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9268_MonkBattle.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9268_MonkBattle_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>When we sat down to outline this book,\
  \ I was absolutely amazed at how large and varied our list of potential archetypes\
  \ was, and I think people are really going to like the ones that ended up making\
  \ the cut. We have archtypes for Shoanti burn riders; Bekyar slavers; undead-loving\
  \ antipaladins known as seal-breakers; Iroran paladins; Sable Company marines; Osirian\
  \ Ouat dwarf monks; the Qadiran horse lord (depicted here, by Kim Sokol); and dozens\
  \ more.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9268_QadiranHorseLord.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9268_QadiranHorseLord_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of horses and riders, we couldn't\
  \ do a book about combat and not present a stable of new material for cavaliers,\
  \ masters of battlefield strategy and horsemanship. <i>Inner Sea Combat</i> presents\
  \ two new cavalier orders, rules on taking a monstrous mount (like a hippocampus,\
  \ hippogriff, or worg), and context for where in the Inner Sea region the knightly\
  \ orders presented in our setting-neutral hardcover rulebooks fit in. Alain may\
  \ get a lot of heat for being a jerk (not undeservedly, I might add), but with <i>Inner\
  \ Sea Combat</i>, he gets the ability to show that his attitude isn't completely\
  \ undeserved (as this action-packed illustration by Jason Rainville shows).</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9268_CavalierCharge.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9268_CavalierCharge_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>That's all I have time for (and that they'll\
  \ let me spoil) so you'll just have to wait to see what else <a href=\"”/products/btpy95b1”\
  \"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Combat</i></a> has in store for you.\
  \ The wait shouldn't be too long. It's on its way soon!</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
