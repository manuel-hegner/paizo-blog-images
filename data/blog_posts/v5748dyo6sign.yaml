  s more to life than fighting monsters and looting treasure. What happens when a\
  \ PC wins a deed to a tavern in a game of cards, crafts a magical item, builds a\
  \ home, or pursues a relationship? All these goals and more are resolved by running\
  \ downtime. Downtime is the space between adventures, where your PCs take a step\
  \ back before the next chapter starts. In downtime, you can sum up the important\
  \ events of a whole day with just one roll. Use this mode when the characters return\
  \ home or otherwise aren’t adventuring.” —</em></strong><em>Pathfinder GM Core</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>With the lowest stakes and longest time covered, downtime is a great way\
  \ to start sessions, or take a break between major beats of a campaign. While most\
  \ groups will do downtime activities in a few minutes, some downtime periods may\
  \ last an entire session to suit the story beats. Just like exploration mode, downtime\
  \ mode can be interspersed with encounters and roleplay beats to keep things moving.</p>\n\
  \      <p>There are a variety of tasks characters can take during downtime, such\
  \ as taking long-term rests, earning income through a variety of avenues, going\
  \ shopping, and retraining skills! Some of these tasks take longer than others—\
  happening over a series of days or weeks, rather than hours in game. But take care\
  \ not to linger too much in downtime at the table—15 minutes to half an hour is\
  \ a good baseline for most downtime activities.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \      <p>Downtime should always start with each player deciding what activity their\
  \ character doing—or a group of characters deciding to collaborate on a downtime\
  \ activity, like putting on a show to earn income. Some downtime tasks only require\
  \ a simple roll and a little embellishment; for example, rolling a 22 to Earn Income\
  \ via Crafting only requires the character stating what they’ve made and what it\
  \ looks like. The GM might choose to roleplay a short scene of the buyer complimenting\
  \ the work.</p>\n      <p>This is also a great time for daily preparations, such\
  \ as choosing spells. Players should decide on a standard set of daily preparations,\
  \ which will then be assumed to be the default unless the player states otherwise\
  \ during a given downtime.</p>\n      <p>For longer periods of downtime that may\
  \ take place over weeks, months, or even years, the GM and players should check\
  \ in about long-term goals for the downtime. Then, rather than rolling for every\
  \ single day and activity, the GM can lay out specific events that are bigger stepping\
  \ stones to that end goal.</p>\n      <p>Using downtime is a great way to slow the\
  \ game down after a stressful adventure or battle, as well as ease players into\
  \ the session at the beginning of a new chapter! <em>Pathfinder GM Core</em> goes\
  \ into detail about running downtime, to support GMs as they help characters achieve\
  \ long-term and short-term goals. <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> outlines some\
  \ basic downtime activities for player characters, as well as suggestions for thinking\
  \ outside the box!</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej2\"\
