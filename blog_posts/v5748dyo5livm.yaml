  \ \n    <p>Why yes, that DOES settle the matter quite nicely, thank you.</p> \n\

  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Spies and information brokers are\
  \ a fact of life on Golarion, for nearly any large organization. Kingdoms need to\
  \ know what other kingdoms are plotting, so as to best make their own plans, while\
  \ at the same time keeping their own secrets hidden. Churches, schools, guilds,\
  \ and merchants have their own need to control the flow of information leaking out\
  \ of their inner chambers. Many groups have dedicated espionage branches, such as\
  \ the Twilight Talons of Andoran, while others combine information gathering and\
  \ enforcement, as with the Silent Shroud in Nidal. Smaller or less wealthy groups\
  \ often must depend on independent spymasters, which may be as simple as buying\
  \ information from the Church of Calistria to as complex as putting together bands\
  \ of freelancers to acquire specific intelligence.</p> \n    <p>The <em>Spymaster's\
  \ Handbook</em> explores all these options, beginning with what causes a character\
  \ to become some kind of spy. Numerous espionage backgrounds are presented, along\
  \ with related traits (from Chelish Sympathyzer to Youthful Infiltrator) and drawbacks\
  \ (many spies must deal with being Betrayed, or hiding some Secret Shame). Secret\
  \ agendas are presented in new Story Feats, to allows an espionage character to\
  \ have an element of spycraft added to their character as part of a typical ongoing\
  \ campaign. New rules on information dealing allows secrets to be bought and sold\
  \ as commodities, making secret-running a potentially lucrative line of work.</p>\
  \ \n    <p></p>And of course new character options tie characters with secret to\
  \ the lore of Golarion. Spy elements within groups ranging from the Blackjackets\
  \ to the Starwatch are tied to be magic items, feats, and spells. Espionage spells\
  \ allow you to steal a victim's face, or encourage a target to speak endlessly on\
  \ a topic of your choice. And the ultimate secret-keeper, the vigilante, is given\
  \ three new archetypes, and a host of social and vigilante talents.\n    <p></p>\
  \ \n    <p>For a little extra I can even preview one of the new spells present in\
  \ the book? Ah yes, always a pleasure doing business with you.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Claim Identity</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>School</b> transmutation (polymorph); <b>Level</b> alchemist 3, antipaladin\
  \ 3, bard 3, druid 4, inquisitor 3, shaman 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 3<br> <b>Casting\
  \ Time</b> 1 standard action<br> <b>Components</b> V, S, M (a needle and thread)\L\
  <br> <b>Range</b> touch\L<br> <b>Target</b> humanoid creature touched\L<br> <b>Duration</b>\
  \ 1 hour/level\L<br> <b>Saving Throw</b> Fortitude negates; <b>Spell Resistance</b>\
  \ yes\L</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">You steal the target's face, transforming\
  \ yourself into a flawless imitation of it. All of the target's facial features,\
  \ vocal cues, and identifying physical traits change, transforming it into an unremarkable\
  \ member of its race and gender. You transform into a perfect likeness of the target's\
  \ true form, as if affected by alter self, and gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks\
  \ to impersonate the original subject of this spell; you take no penalties on this\
  \ check if the original target is of a different race, age, size,\Lor gender.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">Claim identity prevents any other polymorph effects\
  \ from restoring the target's true face for the spell's duration, though the target\
  \ can still assume\Lother forms or faces via magic or any natural shapechanging\
  \ ability.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Owen K.C. Stephens<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
