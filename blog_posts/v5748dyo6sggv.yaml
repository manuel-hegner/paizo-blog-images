  description\">January brings us two scenarios that build on more recent stories,\
  \ taking us to the forests of Iobaria and back into the Hao Jin Tapestry.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Taking us to Iobaria is <a href=\"/products/btq01wkp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1012-Breath-of-the-Dragonskull\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-12: Breath of the Dragonskull</em></a>, a Tier\
  \ 1-5 scenario written by yours truly that has the Pathfinders returning to the\
  \ town of Mishkar to help out some old friends who are in a bit of a jam. The PCs\
  \ will have to navigate both a delicate political situation and a blazing forest\
  \ fire if they are to complete their mission successfully.</p> \n    <p>When I developed\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-918-Scourge-of-the-Farheavens\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society #9-18: Scourge of the Farheavens</em></a>, I realized that\
  \ the story of the people of Sarkoris, whose homeland was devoured by the Worldwound,\
  \ were people I wanted to get to know better. <em>Breath of the Dragonskull</em>\
  \ touches on a lot of stories that I really care about and wanted to spend a little\
  \ more time with and I jumped at the opportunity to write it. As we look forward\
  \ to a new edition where the heroes of Wrath of the Righteous have successfully\
  \ closed the Worldwound, I thought it would be a great opportunity to revisit the\
  \ god-caller Nelket and her deity Dolok Darkfur as the Society makes good on its\
  \ promises from #9-18 and helps the Sarkorian refugees and their allies retake their\
  \ new home.</p> \n    <p>Since announcing goblins as a playable race in the next\
  \ iteration of the Pathfinder RPG, we've seen much commentary about the status of\
  \ goblins and how they fit into Golarion. Not only what their role not just in the\
  \ Society is, but also in the larger world. As we've done previously, the team took\
  \ advantage of using the ongoing narrative of the Pathfinder Society to explore\
  \ how goblins, specifically forest goblins, of all alignments handle situations.\
  \ Though one thing hasn't changed, goblins still love burning things. I did mention\
  \ that there's a forest fire, right? You'll get to see how goblins interact with\
  \ less populated ecosystems and might even find some roots that could grow into\
  \ goblin PCs when the new Core Rulebook releases in August.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  /products/btq01wkq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1013-Fragments-of-Antiquity\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #10-13: Fragments of Antiquity</em></a> is a Tier 5-9 scenario\
  \ that takes the Pathfinders once more into the unraveling demiplane known as the\
  \ Hao Jin Tapestry. The PCs endeavor to discover the fate of the legendary sorcerer\
  \ Hao Jin as they trek their way through an ancient library filled with deadly traps\
  \ crafted by a clan of clever kobolds.</p> \n    <p>Kobolds, libraries, and strange\
  \ planar phenomenon present a robust and challenging mix of encounters for a group\
  \ of players to confront, but veteran scenario author Sam Polak was excited for\
  \ the challenge. The Scalebreaker kobolds are a memorable addition to the organized\
  \ play catalogue of NPCs. Attentive and diplomatic players may even have the opportunity\
  \ to figure out which kobolds are responsible for their particular woes as they\
  \ traverse the library depths. It'll be up to the players to decide if the Scalebreakers\
  \ are friends or foes, but kobold chieftain Bridge-and-Logs gets to make an early\
  \ appearance here in the blog, courtesy of Tom Ventre!</p> \n    <p style=\"clear:\
