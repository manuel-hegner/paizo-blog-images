  \  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <h1>How Do I Play a Barbarian in Service to Andoran?</h1>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 17, 2008</p> \n   <p>Continuing the idea\
  \ of the July 10 blog post, we thought we'd give you another sneak peak at the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Player's Guide and touch on some of the 3.5 OGL base classes that might\
  \ not mesh well with the \"Freedom over tyranny!\" theme prevalent in both the nation\
  \ of Andoran and the Andoren faction of the Pathfinder Society. We also threw in\
  \ a few other base classes just to give you an idea of possible themes for your\
  \ Andoran-based character.</p> \n   <p><b>Andoren Pathfinders</b></p> \n   <p>Andorens\
  \ are particularly suited to the life of a pathfinder. Natural explorers with the\
  \ bravery to face ominous frontiers of mystery and danger, these sons and daughters\
  \ of freedom are perfect candidates for membership in the world's most elite adventuring\
  \ society. </p> \n   <p><b>Barbarians</b>: The freedom fighter tradition is a long\
  \ and gloried one in Andoran. Past freedom fighters prowled hard stony hills and\
  \ dense forests, striking out against Chelish oppressors in brutal, guerilla assaults.\
  \ Freedom fighter tactics are a point of honor among the old revolutionary families,\
  \ and training in these warrior traditions have passed from father to son over many\
  \ generations. Also found among the Andoren ranks are former gladiatorial slaves,\
  \ refugees from less enlightened regions of Golarion. These peerless warriors embrace\
  \ the dogma of freedom and Common Rule and lend their ferocious fighting skills\
  \ to the defense of their new home. </p> \n   <p><b>Fighters</b>: Andoran's military\
  \ traditions are myriad. Before their independence, Andorens often served as the\
  \ vanguard in the armies of Cheliax and Old Taldor. The finest naval captains and\
  \ dragoons of Old Taldor's armada were also largely Andoren, and the tradition of\
  \ excellence in combat on land and sea persists now that the nation's independence\
  \ is won. Brave, intelligent, and tactically-minded warriors serve in Andoran's\
  \ modern military, and the best among them eventually earn the mantle of the Eagle\
  \ Knights. The threats against Andoran's fledgling democracy are very real, and\
  \ only the best, most highly-trained military men and women can keep the armies\
  \ of darkness at Andoran's borders at bay. </p> \n   <p><b>Rogues</b>: There is\
  \ a saying among Andoran's thieves: \"You can't eat freedom.\" While liberty is\
  \ the right of every citizen, Andoran was forged by the mercantile class and is\
  \ fueled by gold and silver. In the teeming cities of Augustana, Carpenden, and\
  \ Oregent, the unwashed masses are slaves to poverty instead of a dictator's lash.\
  \ The burning desire for freedom instilled in all Andorens often manifests as a\
  \ complete disregard for law and order resulting in outbreaks of larcenous behavior.\
  \ A great number of the privateers in service of His Excellency are little more\
  \ than pirates granted letters of marque to prey on the nation's many enemies and\
  \ the host of slaver ships sailing the Inner Sea. Merchant consortiums and patriotic\
  \ nobles maintain circles of spies to pry into the affairs of the nation's enemies\
  \ as well as rival groups inside Andoran's borders. </p> \n   <p><b>Wizards</b>:\
  \ The musty tomes and old ways of wizardry are unpopular in Andoran, as the fledgling\
  \ democracy is more concerned with the bright prospects of the future than they\
  \ are the clouded secrets of the past. Wizards in Andoran are confined mostly to\
  \ large cities, though some remote training academies exist in the wild frontiers\
  \ where research into fel magics can be conducted without interference. Many Andoren\
  \ wizards focus their studies on breaking enchantments and liberating the minds\
  \ and souls of those oppressed by evil magic. Necromancy and any magic that enslaves\
  \ others are widely frowned upon, and the open practice of either can earn one a\
  \ prison sentence. Beyond these taboos, magical research is fairly unrestricted.\
  \ While it may be unpopular, the right of citizenship gives every wizard the freedom\
  \ to delve into any studies they wish so long as they do not harm others. </p> \n\
