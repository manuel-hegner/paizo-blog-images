  Barsala, the iconic kasatha biohacker, brandishes a pistol and a syringe in two\
  \ of her four hands.\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration by\
  \ Remko Troost</p> \n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The daughter\
  \ of a renowned biotechnician and a respected priest of Talavet, Barsala Zharliska\
  \ Sonari of House Ulanda grew up in Trillidiem, the arcology of bubble-shaped domes\
  \ that floats above Bretheda’s northern pole. Her parents maintained a household\
  \ in which discussion and debate were encouraged, with most dinnertime talks focused\
  \ around the dichotomy between faith and science. Even at a young age, Barsala was\
  \ included, her questions and opinions treated with respect. As a result, she found\
  \ herself drawn to studying scientific disciplines, but focused on how they could\
  \ help her neighbors and her community. Barsala witnessed the power of community\
  \ early in her life when she lost her lowleft hand due to severe nerve damage sustained\
  \ in a nasty fall and many of her family’s neighbors came together to help her get\
  \ used to her new cybernetic prosthesis.</p> \n     <p>Years later, Barsala earned\
  \ her doctorate from the prestigious Sui Saolus Academy and landed a job as a junior\
  \ research assistant at Iratha Incorporated, a biotech firm in Trillidiem founded\
  \ by a lashunta and a kasatha. Despite barathus nearly dominating the biotech field,\
  \ Iratha Incorporated is a successful corporation, focusing exclusively on augmentations\
  \ for humanoids. Barsala was happy with her job, but after several months, she began\
  \ to worry that her research—though pivotal for reducing implant rejection rates\
  \ among other things—was far too niche. She wondered if there was something else\
  \ she could do to aid the community at large.</p> \n     <p>Explaining her dilemma\
  \ to a friend, Barsala hit on an idea that sparked her interest: she would start\
  \ a regular holovid stream in which she would explain the basic concepts of science\
  \ to viewers in a way that was fun and engaging. Branding herself as “Dr. B,” she\
  \ rented a small studio, set up a simple lab, donned a white lab coat, and began\
  \ broadcasting in her off hours. Dr. B’s first holovids featured very basic principles—\
  gravity, magnetism, and the like—and her production values were rough around the\
  \ edges, but Barsala’s enthusiasm and easy-to-understand explanations quickly gained\
  \ her a wide audience on Bretheda’s infosphere and beyond. </p> \n     <p>However,\
  \ her program didn’t reach the same popularity as reality shows and sporting events\
  \ until it caught the attention of Thalus Enthremian Damru, the kasatha co-founder\
  \ of Iratha Incorporated. He saw the show’s potential as a marketing tool but also\
  \ respected Barsala’s commitment to education. One day, Thalus approached Barsala\
  \ in her Iratha lab to offer her holovid stream an official sponsorship, which would\
  \ include a new studio, as well as a small staff to ensure that everything looked\
  \ and sounded professional. Her new role as “scientific ambassador” was added to\
  \ her job description, and she soon became the holovid icon she is today.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Dr. B’s Science Jubilee” is popular with young sentients throughout the\
  \ Pact Worlds and most of Near Space, thanks to Barsala’s engaging personality and\
  \ flashy experiments. With Iratha Incorporated’s funding, Barsala has been able\
  \ to travel across the galaxy to showcase interesting scientific phenomena first-hand,\
  \ including such topics as the life cycles of unusual flora and fauna, the formation\
  \ of bizarre minerals and crystals, and the odd interactions between certain fundamental\
  \ forces of physics. Some of the program’s most shared episodes feature Barsala\
  \ being introduced to a new species of alien animal (often with hilarious results)\
  \ and the kasatha putting a scientific myth to the test (usually accompanied by\
  \ explosions).</p> \n     <p>Between these on-location shoots, Barsala continues\
  \ her research on biotech augmentations, and occasionally, topics on her show have\
  \ led her to small breakthroughs in her work and research. While these advancements\
  \ have garnered some praise in the scientific community, most people only recognize\
  \ the kasatha through her holovid work, with some people even believing that the\
  \ “Doctor” part of “Dr. B” is merely an affectation. Nevertheless, Barsala presses\
  \ on with both aspects of her job, hoping she can positively impact the lives of\
  \ people in one way or the other.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Jason Keeley<br>\
