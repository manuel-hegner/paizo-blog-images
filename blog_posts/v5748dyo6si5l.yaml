  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello, all! I’m Logan\
  \ Bonner, Pathfinder Lead Designer and the primary designer of the kineticist. Now\
  \ that we’ve finished up the class playtest, I want to cover where we’re planning\
  \ to go with the class. Many of these changes are based on your survey feedback,\
  \ as well as common comments we witnessed monitoring the forums and social media.\
  \ This took a while, because the playtest had a big turnout. We don’t usually share\
  \ these numbers, but the kineticist got <b>exactly 1,000</b> survey responses, and\
  \ that was too fun to keep to ourselves! (There were fewer for the open response,\
  \ as is typical.)</p> \n      <p>I want to hit the main changes we’re planning to\
  \ make. These aren’t necessarily the final changes, as our internal testing and\
  \ number-crunching might nix some of them. Also, there are many other small changes\
  \ I won’t be covering here to keep things brief(ish)—some of you dropped fun little\
  \ ideas that we’ll just implement, but aren’t massively important to the bigger\
  \ picture of the class.</p> \n      <br> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <table\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b> Overall, the class had good ratings,\
  \ but not top tier. If it went in the book as-is, it would be pretty effective and\
  \ fun, but we think there’s clear room for improvement to make it a standout. Respondents\
  \ vastly preferred the impulses of the playtest over expressing elemental powers\
  \ as spellcasting of any kind. One common refrain though, was that damage was too\
  \ low, especially on many of the overflow abilities. We were pretty conservative\
  \ on the playtest, and we’ll be carefully turning some of the damage up. We’re also\
  \ planning to reduce the overall number of overflow impulses while dialing up their\
  \ effects, keeping the trait just for those impulses that have a major effect on\
  \ the battle and feel worth spending a lot of actions to do.</p> \n      <p>Though\
  \ the class is intended to be pretty focused on combat, we do have some concerns\
  \ about the lack of options for kineticists during exploration, downtime, and the\
  \ like. We’ll be seeing what we can do to make feel less narrow in those situations.\
  \ It’s yet to be determined whether that comes in the form of more skills, some\
  \ specific abilities, or a mix.</p> \n      <p><b>Complexity vs. Simplicity:</b>\
  \ The big challenge of this class is making it simple enough that it’s accessible\
  \ and fun for a new player or a player who wants to play a character with a more\
  \ straightforward playstyle. Many of the classes after the <em>Advanced Player’\
  s Guide</em> have needed to be more complex to convey their concept. With the kineticist,\
  \ we wanted to pull this back! Attaining the variety the class needs while not adding\
  \ even more rules to remember is tricky, but rest assured we want the final class\
  \ to make sense for its target audience. We did have a small number of respondents\
  \ who wanted many different mechanics in the class at once (like having impulses,\
  \ focus spells, cantrips, AND burn), but we’re not looking to go in that direction\
  \ so that we can keep things streamlined. </p> \n      <p>Our ultimate goal is to\
  \ have a class that feels extremely adept with their elements or elements. They\
  \ will resemble a non-spellcaster in that they have a small set of tools they’ve\
  \ very strong with, but also will resemble a spellcaster in their ability to create\
  \ magical effects and straightforward focus on their impulses. It’s worth noting\
  \ that, because kineticists have fewer tools, some impulses will just be stronger\
  \ than comparable spells. Wings of Air from the playtest was often noted as being\
  \ stronger than <em>fly</em>, but it’s intentional that the kineticist who is fully\
  \ dedicated to mastering air is better at flying than a wizard who knows many spells\
  \ and simply prepares one spell slot with a <em>fly</em> spell.</p> \n      <p><b>Lack\
  \ of Clarity:</b> One of the major problems we saw frequently was confusion over\
  \ the intended role of certain parts of the class. What was meant to be important?\
  \ What’s more of a side benefit? We saw this in attack rolls vs. class DC, the specialty\
  \ of each element, the difference between overflow impulses and other impulses,\
  \ and so on. We’re looking to streamline these for the final, to introduce bigger\
  \ differences and clearer paths. For one example, multiple elements having healing\
  \ abilities made it a bit muddy about what “belonged” to each element. So, for the\
  \ final, expect each element to have a clearer identity while still allowing enough\
  \ variety to not feel too stale. </p> \n      <p><b>Elemental Blast:</b> The contrast\
  \ between Elemental Blasts and other impulses touches on the lack of clarity too.\
  \ After seeing feedback, we’re looking at switching it to function similarly to\
  \ other impulses and act more like an attack cantrip. This will likely require something\
  \ similar to a spell attack roll, letting you use your Constitution for it. This\
  \ has several benefits: it should let us simplify how it works, make Con clearly\
  \ the best choice for your top ability score, free up kineticist characters’ ability\
  \ boosts for a wider variety of characters, and still allow upgrades to the blast.\
  \ This does leave some challenges, especially around a kineticist’s item loadout.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>We intend to move any “use your element as a weapon” options into\
  \ the Elemental Weapon feat so that still remains as an option—especially for melee\
  \ kineticists. The final form of the Elemental Blast is still to be decided, since\
  \ it relies on a lot of other moving parts, but we intend to keep it as a versatile\
  \ option with some variety between the elements.</p> \n      <p>There was plenty\
  \ of disagreement among playtesters about whether the class should be primarily\
  \ a single-target damage dealer or be built around more varied effects. Much of\
  \ this had to do with whether the player believed the Elemental Blast or the other\
  \ impulses were the core mechanic of the class. Going all-in on single-target blasts\
  \ can lead to extremely stagnant, repetitive play, so we aren’t planning to make\
  \ that the sole focus. However, we will be exploring what room we have for boosting\
  \ single-target damage as an option for those who want it, without making that the\
  \ only role the class can fill.</p> \n      <p><b>Constitution?:</b> The survey\
  \ asked whether people preferred Constitution or a mental score for class DC. Though\
  \ the responses wanting a mental score were quite low, there were a significant\
  \ number of write-in responses that liked Con but also wanted it to be more important\
  \ to the class. Looking at the issue and the target audience of the class, we’re\
  \ planning to make Constitution matter a bit more so it’s the <em>clear</em> choice\
  \ for your top ability score. This should allow more flexibility in other scores\
  \ and open up a broader array of character concepts.</p> \n      <p>The change to\
  \ Elemental Blast noted above is linked to this. We might also use Constitution\
  \ for damage on some impulses or in certain circumstances.</p> \n      <p><b>Gates:</b>\
  \ We had a mixed bag of feedback about the gate options (dedicated gate, dual gate,\
  \ and universal gate). Taking it as a whole, we’re currently leaning toward having\
  \ a dedicated gate or dual gate option at 1st level, with class feature later on\
  \ that let a kineticist either further specialize in an element they can channel\
  \ or to expand to a new element. Universal gate had issues at low levels because\
  \ it felt like the best option in some ways, but was also limited too severely by\
  \ a small number of impulses. We think the new version will enable a story of a\
  \ kineticist developing their elemental breadth over time in a more organic way,\
  \ rather than locking them in tightly at level 1 with nowhere to grow.</p> \n  \
  \    <p><b>Gathering your Element:</b> Many playtesters noted that Gathering an\
  \ Element felt like an action tax. Lots of folks equated it with drawing a weapon,\
  \ which was the intended equivalent, but many people really wanted it to be more\
  \ exciting, like the actions a swashbuckler can use to gain panache. There were\
  \ also some mentions that it could be too much bookkeeping to track multiple elements\
  \ for dual gate and universal gate—easy to forget which one you currently have gathered.\
  \ The current plan for this part of kineticist play is to replace gathering an element\
  \ with a process that serves a similar rules function, but has a theme that’s a\
  \ bit more fun and fits the kineticist’s presentation a bit better.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Our current thinking is to have the kineticist surrounded with their kinetic\
  \ aura at all times, letting their elements swirl around them. The aura doesn’t\
  \ have any effect on its own—it’s just for show—though dedicated gate kineticists\
  \ might get a minor benefit. To use an impulse, the kineticist directs the flowing\
  \ elements with a free hand. Overflow impulses exhaust the aura, similar to expending\
  \ a gathered element in the playtest. It would then take a single action to cause\
  \ a resurgence from your inner gate, also granting an added benefit. This might\
  \ be using a kinetic aura impulse to alter the effect of the aura, making an Elemental\
  \ Blast, or a specific benefit related to an element. The final form will depend\
  \ on the complexity of the other options in the class. We think this will be easier\
  \ to understand, link better to other abilities within the class, and better tell\
  \ the class’s story.</p> \n      <p><b>Manipulate Trait:</b> There was a lot of\
  \ conversation about the manipulate trait triggering Attacks of Opportunity and\
  \ putting the melee kineticist in danger. This isn’t a factor in most combats, but\
  \ in combats against many monsters with Attack of Opportunity, it’ll get you dead\
  \ in a hurry! The discussions about this reinforced that the inclusion of concentrate\
  \ and manipulate on all impulses was carried forward from how spells work... and\
  \ these aren’t supposed to be just like spells! So, it’s likely the final impulses\
  \ will still include concentrate, but manipulate will only appear on impulses where\
  \ it’s essential to the action taking place in the story.</p> \n      <p><b>Burn:</b>\
  \ Burn was a hot topic, as expected! Survey feedback found that using impulses and\
  \ gathering elements came out ahead, even when we combined burn and the “other”\
  \ survey choice. There were plenty of votes for burn and for “other,” though, so\
  \ it was far from a blowout. Fundamentally, we’re aiming at the “nonstop magic”\
  \ fantasy for this class—the kineticist isn’t meant to be about long-term resource\
  \ management. That means burn has to clear a pretty high bar to be included, since\
  \ it pulls the class into relying more on resource management and limited-use abilities.\
  \ Most suggestions we’ve seen so far for including a burn-type mechanic lead to\
  \ the class feeling either too heavy on long-term planning, or too repetitive or\
  \ exploitable. We’ll continue looking at possibilities as we work on the final version.\
  \ It’s possible there might be a niche for implementing burn as an option for those\
  \ interested, provided we find a way to make it dynamic.</p> \n      <p><b>More\
  \ Stuff... and Less Stuff:</b> The kineticist is a very big class, as we want each\
  \ element to feel fun and distinct, and keeping it within the book’s page count\
  \ is pretty difficult. As we add more elements to the class for the final version,\
  \ there’s a high likelihood we’ll have to condense and trim back some other options.\
  \ We’re aiming to condense down some of the overly complex bits rather than chopping\
  \ whole impulses, but we might end up between a rock and a hard place, so be forewarned!</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Initial Playtest and Design</h3> \n      <p>We did a\
  \ bit of a different process for the kineticist class design, as mentioned when\
  \ I talked about James Case’s prototype kineticist character. That was part of an\
  \ early playtest with the design team, Solomon St. John, and Shay Snow. Each designer\
  \ made a single kineticist character. Not a list of feats, proficiencies, and all\
  \ that—just the most basic playable character possible. Jason Bulmahn GMed a short\
  \ adventure, and we tried out many different takes on the class! This hearkens back\
  \ to the very first days of 2nd edition design, when we did something similar with\
  \ a cleric, fighter, rogue, and wizard based on some basic benchmarks.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>How about another peek behind the curtain? Here are the elemental webs showing\
  \ the strengths of the various elements. This was for the playtest version, so you’\
  ll see some big alterations for the final as we differentiate the elements more,\
  \ as mentioned above. Metal and wood were purely speculative! We didn’t write any\
  \ impulses for those before the playtest.</p> \n      <table style=\"width:90%\"\
