  artist: "a few years, and has a definite florid charm of her own, Brackett stands\
    \ out with just how modern her work feels. In reading The Ginger Star, the first\
    \ of Brackett's Eric John Stark books set on the planet Skaith, I'm constantly\
    \ struck by the smooth flow of her prose, the way it slips cleanly through your\
    \ mind and leaves nothing behind but an image. There's a school of thought that\
    \ says the best sort of writing is invisible, work in which the author herself\
    \ disappears and you're left with only the story. Brackett obviously understood\
    \ that. And what ideas she presents! The intentionally mutated Children of the\
    \ Sea and Children of Skaith-Our-Mother, humans who sought to avoid their planet's\
    \ apocalypse by returning to the embrace of the sea and the subterranean realms.\
    \ The Corn King and his masked men of the northern towers, who worship only hunger\
    \ and cold. Even the psychic wolves that guard the citadel of the Lords Protector,\
    \ who kill by projecting paralyzing fear into the minds of their prey. Ideas like\
    \ these flow fast and furious in her books, and it was these flights of fancy\
    \ that ultimately inspired so many. And if my own reasons aren't enough to convince\
    \ you that The Ginger Star is worth checking out, consider this: Many years ago,\
    \ at the height of her career, Ms. Brackett was sought out by a young author named\
    \ Ray Bradbury in search of a mentor, and was taken on as her protégé. He's said\
    \ himself that he learned much about the craft of writing at the feet of her and\
    \ her husband, Edmond Hamilton. Which leads me to ask: who are we to argue with\
    \ Ray's taste? James Sutter Planet Stories Editor"
