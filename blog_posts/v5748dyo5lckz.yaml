  \ at Paizo, the design team has a host of challenges. Some of the greatest challenges\
  \ come when dealing with the rules of our game that don't work as well as we would\
  \ like. For a number of weeks we have been talking about the issues concerning the\
  \ Stealth skill. Over the course of those conversations we have come up with many\
  \ ideas to improve this skill and make its use both clearer and more playable.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>So, here is our crazy idea: We are thinking about just rewriting the skill.\
  \ This is our first stab at a rewrite, but before we make any definitive change,\
  \ we want to unleash our crazy ideas to you—the Pathfinder players—to poke holes\
  \ in, give us input on, and playtest. The following changes to the Stealth rules\
  \ are by no means final, nowhere near official, and definitely not usable in Pathfinder\
  \ Society. They're here for you to read, think on, playtest, and then for you to\
  \ give us feedback. We will be listening for the next week. Have fun!</p> \n   <h2>Stealth</h2>\
  \ \n   <p><b>(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)</b><br> You are skilled at avoiding detection,\
  \ allowing you to slip past foes or strike from an unseen position. This skill covers\
  \ hiding and moving silently.</p> \n   <p><b>Check:</b> Your Stealth check is opposed\
  \ by the Perception check of anyone who might notice you. Usually a Stealth check\
  \ is made at the start of a free, move, or swift action when you start that action\
  \ with either some kind of cover (except for soft cover) or concealment. You can\
  \ always spend a swift action to stay immobile and make a Stealth check. You cannot\
  \ spend a free action to initiate a Stealth check, but if you spend a free action\
  \ while under the effects of Stealth, you must make a new Stealth check in order\
  \ to continue the effects of Stealth. You can move up to half your normal speed\
  \ and use Stealth at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than half and up\
  \ to your normal speed, you take a –5 penalty. It's usually impossible to use Stealth\
  \ while taking an immediate action, standard action, or a full-round action, unless\
  \ you are subject to <i>greater invisibility</i> or a similar effect, you are sniping\
  \ (see below), or you are using a standard action to ready an action. When you make\
  \ your Stealth check, those creatures that didn't succeed at the opposed roll treat\
  \ you as invisible until the start of your next action or until the end of your\
  \ turn if you do not end your turn with cover or concealment. When you use Stealth,\
  \ creatures that are observing you (creatures that you didn't have cover or concealment\
  \ from) or that succeed at the opposed check do not treat you as invisible.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty\
  \ on Stealth checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny\
  \ +8, Small +4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.</p> \n   <p><b>Attacking\
  \ from Invisibility:</b> Usually making an attack against a creature ends the invisible\
  \ condition. If during your last action were invisible to a creature, you are still\
  \ considered invisible when you make the first attack of that new action.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Other Perception Checks:</b> If a creature makes a Perception check as\
  \ a move action to notice an invisible creature, the DC of the Perception check\
  \ is the invisible creature's last Stealth check. This is also the case if a creature\
  \ makes a Perception check to notice an invisible creature because the perceiving\
  \ creature is entering an area where it could possibly notice an invisible creature.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Sniping:</b> If you already are invisible to a target and you are 10\
  \ feet from that target, as a standard action, you can make one ranged attack against\
  \ that target and immediately make an opposed Stealth check to stay invisible. You\
  \ take a –20 penalty on your Stealth check when attempting to snipe.</p> \n   <p><b>Creating\
  \ a Diversion to Hide:</b> If you do not have cover or concealment, as a standard\
  \ action, you can attempt a Bluff check opposed by the Perception of opponents that\
  \ can see you. On a success, you become invisible to those creatures and can move\
  \ up to half your speed. When you do this, you take a –10 penalty on the Bluff check.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Action:</b> Usually making a Stealth check is not an action. Using\
  \ Stealth is part of the action are taking.</p> \n   <p><b>Special:</b> If you are\
  \ subject to the <i>invisibility</i> or <i>greater invisibility</i> spells or a\
  \ similar effect, you gain a +40 bonus on Stealth checks while you are immobile,\
  \ or a +20 bonus on Stealth checks while you're moving. If you have the Stealthy\
  \ feat, you get a bonus on Stealth checks (see Chapter 5).</p> \n   <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br>\
