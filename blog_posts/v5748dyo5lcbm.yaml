  \ Society Organized Play, Part XVI: Use Pathfinder Missions as a Front for Personal\
  \ Gain</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 4, 2011</p> \n    <p><i>A loose\
  \ affiliation of Varisian swindlers, thieves, and smugglers, the Sczarni don't have\
  \ much in common with the average Pathfinder. But to many, there's little distinction\
  \ between someone who robs the grave of an ancestor and someone who cons one out\
  \ of her night's dinner. Thus, when Sczarni and Pathfinders come to town, both are\
  \ often lumped into the same category by suspicious natives and watchful legal authoritiesâ€”\
  troublesome people to watch out for. Though not officially allied, many Pathfinders\
  \ work with local Sczarni throughout the region to aid one another in surviving,\
  \ hopefully gaining a leg up in their own endeavors in the process.</i></p> \n \
  \   <div align=\"right\"> \n     <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"\
  3\" align=\"right\">\n      <tbody>\n       <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/SczarniSymbol.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/SczarniSymbol_180.jpeg\"\

  \ \n    <p> Since the earliest days of Pathfinder, Varisians have been a large part\
  \ of the world. We did, after all, start out with three Adventure Paths set in Varisia.\
  \ So it was only natural that we include a faction aligned with what is arguably\
  \ our most thoroughly developed part of Golarion. But we didn't just want an ethnic\
  \ Varisian faction, as we'd then need Ulfen, Kellid, Mwangi, and Garundi factions\
  \ as well. Similarly, a political faction didn't seem right given the fractured\
  \ nature of Varisia's three major city-states, as we would have had to choose which\
  \ city would get a faction and which wouldn't. So we started to think about what\
  \ elements of Varisian life most aligned with the Pathfinder Society.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The Sczarni seemed to fit quite well, so we went with them. I swear there was\
  \ no knee-breaking involved in the decision. People have, after all, been asking\
  \ for a long time to make Sleight of Hand checks as their Day Job rolls. The fact\
  \ that people wanted to play pickpockets and con artists seemed fairly obvious.\
  \ We expect this faction to appeal to people currently playing Taldor-faction PCs,\
  \ and many of its faction missions will deal with deception and pilfering with a\
  \ more criminal than political manipulation bent.</p> \n    <p>Anyone who's played\
  \ the <i>Pathfinder Society Quest: Ambush in Absalom</i> will recognize the faction's\
  \ head, a man named Guaril Karela, who operates all of Absalom's Sczarni activity\
  \ out of his dockside curiosity shop, the Pickled Imp. He'll likely assist the Pathfinder\
  \ Society in getting goods or people past unfriendly city watchmen, through hostile\
  \ territory, or even out of some legal binds they may find themselves in. If he\
  \ and those agents loyal to him happen to make some money along the way, how does\
  \ that hurt anyone else?</p> \n    <p>That brings our new factions revealed to three,\
  \ leaving just two more to go before Gen Con! Next week, we'll look at the Silver\
  \ Crusade, the new \"good guy\" faction that should appeal to paladins, clerics\
  \ of any good-aligned deity, and characters who want to help others while they travel\
  \ the world working for the Decemvirate. Until then, all you Americans, enjoy the\
  \ day off, and we'll see you tomorrow!</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p>\
