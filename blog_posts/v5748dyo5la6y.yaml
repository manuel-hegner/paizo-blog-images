  \ \n    <h1>The New Stat Block</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 22, 2007</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Since we have sent a number of modules out to the printer, we recently\
  \ came to the realization that it was high time to show off the new stat block.\
  \ Mind you, there are a lot of things you are going to find familiar, but some things\
  \ are brand new. When it came time to start working on <a href=\"/pathfinder\"><i>Pathfinder</i></a>\
  \ and the <a href=\"/gameMastery/modules\"><i>GameMastery Modules</i></a>, we took\
  \ that opportunity to improve and tinker, while still trying to retain the easy-to-use\
  \ format everyone has come to know and love.</p> \n    <p>Specifically, we tried\
  \ to streamline the information a bit, so that you can more easily get at what you\
  \ need. For example, AC, hit points, and saves now come first in the defensive section.\
  \ All other abilities (such as immunities, resistances, and so on) get grouped together\
  \ beneath these (as evasion is in the example). The offense section gets a similar\
  \ treatment, with the information you need most grouped toward the top.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Next is the tactics box. Instead of having a tactics section in the encounter,\
  \ it made more sense to include that with the stat block, so that each monster could\
  \ have its own information. You get a section for what it does before and during\
  \ combat, as well as a small bit on its morale telling you if it ever decides to\
  \ run away from the fight. Some kobolds make great use of this particular section.</p>\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\" alt=\"stats!\"></a> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>The\
  \ last section in our examples covers the creature's statistics. This information\
  \ is not generally vital to every combat situation and thus gets referenced far\
  \ less often. This is not always the case, though, so you might see some of these\
  \ statistics noted in earlier section so you don't miss them. For example, if a\
  \ creature has improved grab, you can be sure that we will note its grapple bonus\
  \ up in the offense section. </p> \n    <p>The two particular monsters in our sample\
  \ page from <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wix\"><i>D1: Crown of the Kobold King</i></a>\
  \ do not have any special abilities that require in-depth explanation. If they did,\
  \ this information would go at the very end in its own section. The slurk, for instance,\
  \ has a pair of abilities describing how its slimy belly grease and sticky back\
  \ goo work (and no, those aren't the real ability titles).</p> \n    <p>As always,\
  \ we want to hear from you. What do you think about the new stat block? <a href=\"\
