               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">They all agreed that it was Ak’s fault. Poog, Reta Bigbad, Mogmurch, Chuffy Lickwound, even Mogmurch’s toad Amfibier agreed—in a gravelly voice that sounded nothing at all like Mogmurch muttering through closed lips. Ak had been the first to climb into the back of the wagon, and so the other four goblins had no choice but to follow him, only to become trapped when the longshanks and his two terrible horses had arrived, forcing them to cower under a tarpaulin as the wagon rolled into... a human village? The sounds and smells were inconclusive. </p> 
                <p>“Didn’t want to,” Ak said mournfully. “Reta said she would bash me if didn’t.”</p> 
                <p>Reta smacked the other goblin hard across the back of the head. “Was a test!” she snapped. “You coward enough to go just because I tell you? Weak, Ak. We all <em>very</em> disappointed.”</p> 
                <p>The other three goblins, and Amfibier, all muttered in agreement. It was not the first time Ak had disappointed them all, and it would surely not be the last. After a few moments, the muttering trailed off into awkward silence.</p> 
                <p>“What do we do now?” Mogmurch said in a harsh whisper. “Longshanks gone. Don’t hear horses. Maybe it’s safe outside, maybe good time to flee.”</p> 
                <p>“Yes, maybe,” said Reta. “Ak. You go outside, check and see if it’s safe to come out.”</p> 
                <p>Ak looked warily into his companion’s faces, his eyes narrowed. “This also a test? If I go outside, I fail again, Reta hit me?”</p> 
                <p>“No,” Chuffy responded. He pulled a jagged, filthy blade from a sheath at his belt that looked like it was held together with tar, leather straps, and spite. “You stay in here, I stabs you. Go check now. If anything kills you, make lots of noise, so we know not safe to come out yet.”</p> 
                <p>Ak’s head cautiously emerged from under one corner of the canvas drop cloth, almost immediately followed by the rest of his body as someone behind him delivered a swift kick to his backside. The goblin landed in a heap, glancing furtively around as he took in his surroundings. They were in what appeared to be a dimly lit barn. No longshanks (or worse, horses) were in sight, but there were two more wagons, one to either side. Someone had pulled back the canvas covering the nearest wagon, revealing a rack of colorful kites and an opened crate. The crate was packed with straw to protect its contents, but Ak could see enough to immediately recognize what it contained.</p> 
                <p>The goblin’s beady red eyes went wide. He clambered up and into the wagon, thrust his hand into the crate, and pulled out a decorated red paper tube about the length of his arm, attached to a long stick and trailing a short length of fuse. <em>Fireworks!</em> The best kind of fire! And fire was already the best kind of almost anything. A slow smile spread across Ak’s face, taking several seconds to traverse the distance from one ear to the other. This was going to change everything. Once they saw what he’d found, his companions were sure to be so grateful that...</p> 
                <p>“Stupid!” someone yelled from the other wagon. “You dead yet? Or it safe to come out?”</p> 
                <p>Ak looked down at the rocket in his hand, his toothy grin somehow growing even wider. “Just moment,” he said “Found something! You wait there, I show you!” His other hand went to the pouch at his belt, which contained a cache of special ingredients belonging to Mogmurch—ingredients so volatile and dangerous that his alchemist companion had insisted that only Ak could be trusted to carry them—and drew out a single tindertwig. He struck the twig against the rough surface of the canvas, lit the fuse, waited for a tense moment, grew tired of waiting, and jammed the burning twig into the back of the rocket. There was a blinding flash, a deafening report, and Ak was knocked flat on his back. Somewhere nearby, he could dimly make out the unmistakable sound of goblins suffering painful burns, followed by muffled cursing and scrabbling as his companions vacated their hiding place, which quickly gave way to shouts of excitement as they spotted Ak’s discovery.</p> 
                <p>His senses were still clearing when Reta grabbed him by the throat and hauled him to his feet. “Ak,” she said through gritted teeth, staring into his eyes as they struggled to focus. “You try to kill us. With firework.” She motioned to the gently smoldering wagon behind them, then to the other goblins greedily rifling through the opened crate. “But. You also find us many, many firework. You are forgiven, Ak. Today... today you are one of us.”</p> 
                <p>A single tear of pure joy ran down Ak’s cheek. “R-really?” he whispered.</p> 
                <p>Reta smiled, her mouth bristling with needle-sharp teeth. “No,” she said. “Not really.” She gave him a hard push, and Ak topped backwards over the edge of the wagon. Before he could hit the ground, the rocket that Chuffy had stuffed down the back of his leather jerkin went off, propelling him across the warehouse and into the darkness of the hayloft overhead with a strangled yelp and a gout of colorful flame.</p>

                </div> 
                <br> 
                <p>Behind Reta, Poog and Mogmurch were busily pulling more fireworks out of the crate. “Smoke bomb,” Mogmurch said, lighting the fuse of a wrapped paper bundle and tossing it aside with an exasperated sigh. “Not explode. Not start fire. No point.” Poog nodded in agreement, holding the end of another lit tindertwig to the fuse of a bright purple rocket, then deftly spinning the rocket around to use its fuse to light another, even larger, green rocket. He was still clutching both when the door flew open at the other end of the barn.</p> 
                <p>“Who’s in here?” bellowed a tall figure, silhouetted against the light streaming in from outside the barn. The goblins froze. A second shadow, four-legged, growled deep in its throat and stalked ahead of its master into the barn.</p> 
                <p>Poog panicked. Immediately. “DOG!” he shrieked, lowering the green rocket so that it pointed at the oncoming animal a split second before it went off. The rocket missed the dog by more than a goblin’s full height and shot directly out the open entryway, where it struck the inner wall of a stable next door and ricocheted wildly from stall to stall, trailing a shower of sparks. A moment later, the purple rocket in Poog’s other hand went off, striking Mogmurch squarely in the face. The other goblin’s skull-faced helmet flew off as he toppled backward into the crate, followed by the sparking purple rocket. The straw cushioned his impact for a brief moment before bursting into flames.</p> 
                <p>“GOBLINS!” the longshanks in the doorway yelled, taking a step back as the dog, followed by two others, charged snarling into the barn. Poog shrieked in terror and leaped from the wagon, scampering across the cluttered floor and clambering up the assortment of riding tack that hung on one wall of the barn, with Reta right on his heels. There was a tremendous crack, and a blast of heat and smoke washed over them as the wagon below erupted in a massive storm of shrieking multicolored fireballs. One of the fireballs, shrieking slightly louder than the others, darted across the floor and up a rickety ladder toward the hayloft. </p> 
                <p>“That way!” Reta snarled at Poog, gesturing toward the loft as she began to swing, hand over hand, across the wall of saddles and wagon wheels. Below, the dogs barked in rage and confusion as something else caught fire with a satisfying <em>whoosh</em>. There were more longshanks outside now; she could hear them. More dogs, too.</p> 
                <p>In the loft they found Mogmurch, still smoking but no longer actually aflame, peering out a small window that opened out over the street. A moment later, Chuffy hauled himself up and over the ledge, blade clenched between his teeth. He scowled down at Ak, whose unconscious body was still sprawled face down on the floor where he had landed at the end of his brief flight. “Stupid Ak,” he said, delivering a scornful kick that elicited a weak moan. “Mess everything up for us. Again. Now we stuck up here, probably die.”</p> 
                <p>“Yeah, not look good,” Mogmurch said. “Longshanks busy trying to put out stable fire. Way too many dogs outside, though. Maybe we throw Ak down, run away while they eat him?”</p> 
                <p>There was a moment of silent contemplation as each goblin briefly considered who they might be able to bully into dragging Ak to the window. Outside, a panicked human voice screamed, “It’s spreading! Dawnflower’s grace, stop it before it reaches the alchemist!”</p> 
                <p>Poog broke the silence, chuckling knowingly as he put his arms around his companions’ shoulders.</p> 
                <p>“Friends, friends,” Poog said, closing his eyes and shaking his head softly from side to side. “You really think Poog not have brilliant escape plan for just this moment? You forget why we call Poog the smart one?” Sliding one hand into his belt pouch, he withdrew the item inside with a flourish, grinning widely as he looked around for approval.</p> 
                <p>Reta was not impressed. “Yes,” she said. “We all have fingers, Poog. Finger not what we need right now, Poog.”</p> 
                <p>Poog glanced down at the mummified digit in his hand, scowling, and tossed it away before quickly withdrawing a second item, which he dutifully examined before displaying it to the others. “Not that. Have lots of things in here.” He took the rough wooden whistle in his hand and put it to his lips, then blew silently.</p> 
                <p>A tense moment passed.</p> 
                <p>“It broken?” Chuffy started to ask. He was interrupted as a grand commotion erupted somewhere outside. Something large skidded across the cobblestone street and crashed into something else with a dull thud. A chorus of canine yips broke out, only to be drowned out by a furious bellow that trailed off into a high-pitched squeal of rage. The five goblins crowded to the window.</p> 
                <p>“SQUEALY NORD!”</p> 
                <p>A huge pig was charging haphazardly through the crowd, scattering longshanks and dogs alike. As the last of the dogs turned tail and fled, the pig positioned itself in the street directly below the window, looking up at them expectantly. They jumped as one, pouring out of the window just as the hayloft went up in flames behind them. Poog wrapped his arms around Squealy Nord’s neck and prodded him gently on one flank. “Run, Squealy Nord!” he shouted. “Run like wind!”</p> 
                <p>They met with little resistance as Squealy Nord raced up the road leading out of town, bellowing, snorting, and squealing in equal measure; the dogs had scattered, and the longshanks, easily distracted, were busy attempting to extinguish the flames. About a quarter mile outside the village walls, the great swine slowed to a trot, and the goblins allowed themselves a moment to cautiously look back. Sure enough, no one had followed them. Also, Poog was missing. </p> 
                <p>“Reta,” Mogmurch said. “Poog fall off. We go back, get him?”</p> 
                <p>Even at that distance, they all felt the shockwave from the massive blast that came next. There was a deep, shuddering boom, and a colorful cloud in the shape of a flower bloomed over the village, mingling with the thick cloud of black smoke already spreading over the countryside. On the wind, they could hear the distant sound of screams.</p> 
                <p>“Nah,” Reta said. She slid a dried truffle from her pocket into Squealy Nord’s mouth and patted the massive pig’s shoulder. “Poog fine, he find way back. I hungry. Let’s go get food.”</p>

                <p>Let’s play games so that children’s hospitals in the United States and Canada have the funding they need.</p> 
                <p>We’ve participated in Extra Life in the past, but this year we’re excited to have a Super Team to help rally the Paizo community under our banner. Join us as we play games to heal kids. We’ll have guests, laughs, and of course... games!</p> 
                <p>Since this is our first time throwing our d20s in the ring, we wanted to make a big splash. Please create an account and join up! With the full power of Team Paizo and our amazing community, we will make a difference for the kids and Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.</p> 
                <p>Buff up those dice, sharpen your pencils, and grab your Character Folio, because we’re about to start a marathon... FOR THE KIDS!</p>

                <p>If you’re looking to add a touch of horror to your Starfinder game, Starfinder Society has you covered! Explore the corridors of a derelict starship to discover the reason behind the crew’s tragic fate. There were no survivors, but that doesn’t mean you’re the only ones lurking among the flickering lights in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9wes?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-104-Cries-From-the-Drift"><em>Starfinder Society #1-04: Cries from the Drift</em></a>. Or perhaps you’d rather investigate a lethal biotech augmentation whose victims won’t stay dead in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9y4l?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-110-The-HalfAlive-Streets"><em>Starfinder Society #1-10: The Half-Alive Streets</em></a>. If you prefer a subtler form of horror, follow the trail of a missing Starfinder that leads to threat lurking undetected on Absalom Station in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wkn?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-130-Survivors-Salvation"><em>Starfinder Society #1-30: Survivor's Salvation</em></a>. For frightening abodes, what better place to find a creepy mansion than in the center of a mysterious swamp that floats through the Drift? Trace the origin of a bizarre painting to its unnatural origins in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022lc?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-215-The-Infernal-Gallery"><em>Starfinder Society #2-15: The Infernal Gallery</em></a>. Finally, as any Starfinder knows, the space between the stars is home to wonders and terrors alike. The unseen font of knowledge worshipped by a group of morlamaws could spell doom for their entire planet. Will you stop these schemes or be among the victims in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022x4?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-218-Forbidden-Tides"><em>Starfinder Society #2-18: Forbidden Tides</em></a>?</p> 
                <p>For Pathfinder frights, let’s start with the ghost story that I’ll be playing on Halloween: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-302-The-East-Hill-Haunting"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-02: The East Hill Haunting</em></a>. Were your fellow Pathfinders responsible for murdering a woman who’s now returned as a ghost, or is there a conspiracy at work? Ustalav is a popular destination for horror adventures, and for good reason. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027l1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-217-Lost-Maid-of-Anactoria"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-17: Lost Maid of Anactoria</em></a>, the local celebrity of the town of Anactoria, who’s said to confer blessings upon those who visit her, has gone missing. The town fears misfortune if she isn’t returned soon, but this isn’t a typical missing persons case. As everyone in town knows, the maid is already dead! Now, if you’re looking for a classic haunted house, look no further than <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024wv?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-125-Grim-Symphony"><em>Pathfinder Society #1-25: Grim Symphony</em></a>, an adventure so steeped in gothic horror tropes that you can practically see the lightning flashing behind the building’s eerie silhouette. Last but not least, sometimes even the most straightforward mission can go horribly wrong. When a simple delivery to a trading post leads you into the clutches of an evil spirit, you’ll need to keep your senses sharp and weapons close to survive the night in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022lb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-113-Devil-at-the-Crossroads"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-13: Devil at the Crossroads</em></a>.</p>

Right across the street at a theater, people flood inside to catch the premiere of a highly-advertised play, but what comes out of the theater is far more dangerous. As people scatter to safety in the dusty streets, it’s up to the group of gunslingers in the bar to set things right.</em></p>

                <h4><a href="" target="_blank">Adam Conn</a></h4> 
                <p>Adam Conn hails from the many corners of The DaT Network. Starting way back in the days of Walking in Circles Season 2, Conn has now stepped out as one of the new co-online content creators of the DaT Network. He appeared in past adventures as Kimbulton and Castriel on Dragons and Things, Mooktin in Rise of the Runtlords and Kanon Featherbee in Department of Mysteries. You can currently find him on Harbingers as the best local fisherman Hadrian (Hadi) Marth and over on Norse Foundry's Twitch stream in vods of Fenrir Rising as Nix and their current live show, Alien Connections as Sergeant Trenton Barclow. And premiering Nov 14th, he will be in the GM seat for his Pathfinder show "Voyage of the Siren's Song", a pirate adventure set in the Skull and Shackles AP! </p>

                <h4><a href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaBytes" target="_blank">Chelsea Bytes </a></h4> 
                <p>ChelseaBytes is a singing, fun-focused, conversationalist who has a passion for tech, games, and anime, among many other things. Soon after she started streaming on Twitch 3 years ago, many viewers were surprised to find that she was a Computer Scientist, saying that she was too “loud” and “fun”. This Twitch Partner aims to show the world that Computer Scientists don’t look and act the way most people imagine.</p> 
                <p>ChelseaBytes plays a large variety of games over on her channel, but when she's not smashing heads in God of War or winning lane in League of Legends, her stream becomes a daytime TV show. This means cosplaying, hosting giveaways, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and cooking gourmet meals for her community, the ByteCommand. Nothing describes Chelsea's stream better than "Variety", and that variety is made up of ALL of her interests. Chelsea's performance doesn't stop at her own Channel. She is an official host of AMC's FearHQ Twitch channel (Re-Watching Dead, Play Dead, TWD Watchalong, etc.) and Amazon's Crown Channel (Fight Night, Chasing the Crown: Dreamers to Streamers, Clicksport-1, etc.), and has hosted events for companies such as Red Bull (Solo Q Tournament Series), Intel (Unboxing+PC Build), Netflix (TUDUM co-stream), and DTS (Multiple PC Builds/Giveaways), to name a few. </p> 
                <p>Not to be limited to her own stream/hosting, Chelsea spends any extra time guesting. She has had several appearances on D&amp;D Actual Play series like PixelCircus’ "Damsels, Dice, and Everything Nice" and INDG’s "Dungeons &amp; Durags". She was also invited as a Guest/Attending Professional to Dragon*Con 2021 where she co-hosted multiple panels focused on Digital Media. Not one to shy away from causes close to her heart, Chelsea has guested for several charity streams for important causes like "Color of Change" and "Rise Above the Disorder." Regardless of what genre she's in, what channel she's hosting for, or what event she's at, ChelseaBytes always throws herself fully into whatever she's doing.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Wow, as of the time I’m writing this the last couple weeks have been eventful, to say the least. One event that would be an absolute shame to overlook is this, the <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> author blog! Below are an array of the freelancers who helped make <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> possible. I want to note not everyone involved had the time to write or submit an introduction for themselves, so please keep an eye on the credits of the final book to see everyone else who helped make this project possible!</p> 
                <p>I do want to call special attention to one freelancer who is both an incredibly strong author and designer and who won’t get the recognition she deserves unless I use this opportunity to give it her but let me open with a bit of a story. In publishing, sometimes things go wrong—this is especially true when you’re undertaking back-to-back ambitious projects like <em>Secrets of Magic</em> and <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> that are looking to use new and unique templates or delivery methods for conveying information. Without getting too lost in the weeds, let me just note that basically all those things that can go wrong did go wrong at some point or another over the course of this project. One result of this was that we had to reimagine the presentation of quite a few elements in <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> during development.</p> 
                <p>Now, Jessica Redekop was absolute dynamite during this project. She provided insights and assistance to less experienced authors and designers, was an unfailing voice of support and positivity, and turned over some incredibly cool design work. Sadly, <em>none</em> of that work appears in <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>. Through no fault of her own, all of Jessica’s work ended up being in sections of the book that were heavily reworked in ways that required us to cut her submissions. I’ve done what I can to make sure at least some of those submissions make their way into other books so you’ll still get to see the incredible work Jess did, but I want to take this moment to note that even though none of her words appear in this book and she is not credited as a writer, Jess is very much a part of the team that made <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> the (in my humble opinion) incredible book it is.</p> 
                <p>With that out of the <em>way</em>, this blog is already way longer than it’s probably supposed to be, so I’m going to shut my digital mouth and let my amazing freelancers speak for themselves!</p>

                <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> 
                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a full-time freelance author. I’ve contributed to over thirty projects for Paizo, including <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, “The Gilded Cage,” and <em>PFS #3-99: Fate in the Future</em>. My upcoming releases include <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>, <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em>, and <em>Galactic Magic</em>!</p> 
                <p>I wrote a wide range of material for <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, including feats, vehicles, cursed and intelligent guns, a bunch of fun gizmos, and (my personal favorite) the dwarves of Dongun Hold. Contributing to this project was a blast and I hope it inspires.</p>

                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/companies/campaignCoins">Campaign Coins</a> and Paizo have been friends for more than a decade, and we’re always looking for new things to make together, so when the new edition came out, metal <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zq1?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Tokens">Pathfinder Hero Point tokens</a> were a perfect collaboration. Physical tokens help the players remember they have an ace up their sleeve. The detailed token design by Terry Lane has the Glyph of the Open Road on one side and the Pathfinder™ "P" symbol on the other.

                <p>When Pathfinder Second Edition debuted at Gen Con 2019, Paizo decided to commemorate the release with a special limited edition Hero Point Token featuring everyone’s favourite goblin alchemist, Fumbus. Since then, we’ve released an <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023g6?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Advanced-Players-Guide">Advanced Player’s Guide Token</a> in 2020 featuring Feiya the iconic witch, and recently the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027vl?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-PaizoCon-2021">PaizoCon 2021 Hero Point Token</a> put a bird on it with Korakai the tengu oracle.</p> 
                <p>Campaign Coins are also huge friends with <a href="https://paizo.com/companies/qWorkshop">Q-Workshop</a> and were inspired by their Pathfinder dice, and so have started making a special token for each new Pathfinder Adventure Path. In each case, the heads side features an iconic character or moment from the adventure. The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024y2?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Age-of-Ashes">Age of Ashes</a> token features the dragon Mengkare, whereas the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024y1?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Extinction-Curse">Extinction Curse</a> token has the big top, because if there’s one thing we know, it’s that players love that tent. The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xp?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Agents-of-Edgewatch">Agents of Edgewatch</a> token has the Eye of Aroden keeping watch, and the brand new <b><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap7?Pathfinder-Hero-Point-Token-Abomination-Vaults">Abomination Vaults</a></b> token has eccentric oddities merchant Wrin Sivinxi.

                <br> 
                <p>So why get an Adventure Path token? One option is as a keepsake! They’re a nice gift to your Game Master to thank them for running you through the series, or to your players as a memento.</p> 
                <p>But if you want the Adventure Path tokens to make an impact in your game, here’s a fun house rule: all the tokens share the same reverse “P” side, so mix in one from the Adventure Path you’re playing, shuffle them face down, and pass them out randomly. If a player gets the Hero Point token for the current adventure—say Abomination Vaults—then that token counts as two Hero Points. Everyone is always pleased to see Wrin already, and now they’ll be twice as pleased to see her face!</p>

                <p>The next steps will involve the United Paizo Workers (UPW) union electing their bargaining representatives and then meeting with Paizo management to negotiate terms for a collective bargaining agreement. We expect this process to take some time, but we are committed to the effort and hope to settle a contract in due course. Until an agreement is reached, the Paizo staff continues to focus on creating amazing Pathfinder and Starfinder products.</p> 
                <p>Paizo has always been about creating awesome games, and we look forward to the changes that unionization will bring to the company. Please join us on this journey by <a href="https://twitter.com/PaizoWorkers">following the UPW on Twitter</a> and stay tuned for future updates!</p>

                <p>First up, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></a>! First Seeker Ehu Hadif is sending experienced agents to Pholskar, a planet inhabited by giants, to perform an archaeological survey on ruins normally restricted to all but the planet’s ruling Cloud Imperium. During their time on Pholskar, the Starfinders will navigate the planet’s volatile environment and trade words with a cloud giant diplomat. The actions of our Starfinders will determine whether the Starfinder Society is invited back to Pholskar or banned from the planet’s archaeological scene forever! <em>Through Sea and Storm</em> is a scenario for levels 7–10 written by myself, which is certainly a surreal way to start my time at the helm of the Society. When Jenny asked me to write <em>Through Sea and Storm</em> last April, I had no idea I would be the person to announce it.</p> 
                <p>Our second mission of the month is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aks?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-410-The-Way-In"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-10: The Way In</em></a>! Acting on intel gathered by Starfinders on previous missions, Ixthia the Unbreakable leads a fleet of Starfinder vessels to a system in the Vast, aiming to disable a robotic armada controlled by the mysterious culprit behind the Data Scourge. The Starfinders take out and impersonate an isolated patrol ship, gain important intel on the enemy fleet, and infiltrate the enemy flagship while Ixthia leads the Starfinder fleet in a large-scale assault against the automated armada. This is the first time our agents have a chance to truly turn the tables on their unnamed enemy, and this adventure doesn’t disappoint! <em>The Way</em> In is a scenario for levels 5–8 written by Dennis Muldoon. You don’t want to miss this one!</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <p>Take care, Starfinders! It’s been a pleasure.</p>

                 <p><em>The Ustalavic wolfhound turned around three times before finally settling into the enormous cushion beside his master’s desk. But it was not his master’s feet that he rested his chin on. When he raised his eyebrows and let out a heavy sigh, it was not his master’s gaze he met. It was his master’s trusted friend, the one he called “Benedet.” Benedet was around a lot. More than the wolfhound’s master, even. Benedet was always calm and kind. Benedet took good care of the hound.</em></p> 
                 <p><em>But Benedet’s face was not calm now. It was worried. The master had been gone… how long? Too long. Many meals had passed since the master had been here.</em></p> 
                 <p><em>The one called Benedet sighed back at the wolfhound and spoke. Their voice quivered slightly. Not enough for people to notice, but the wolfhound knew: Benedet was terrified. “Don’t worry, Arnisant. I’m sure the Pathfinders will be along soon. I’d go looking for him myself, but—well, someone has to stay and take care of you, right? And if he turned up while I was away—no, that just wouldn’t do. I must follow the protocols. He wouldn’t have it any other way. You understand, don’t you, old friend? Of course you do. Don’t worry…”</em></p> 
                 <p><em>The wolfhound nuzzled deeper into the cushion as Benedet rested their feet once more against his fur. And they waited.</em></p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“Typically, when a patrol is sent out to escort a diplomat, they can handle themselves!”</p> 
                <p>Amircia winced, took a moment to reload her pistol, and took aim at the—eyes? hands?—eye-hands of the blood painter closest to her. “<em>Typically</em>, our patrols don’t get surrounded by aberrations.” A clean shot straight through the appendage, and she was already moving in with her machete to sever the wounded limb.</p> 
                <p>Rahaksenwe snorted, adjusting her hold on her spider gun. She took a breath in time with the gun’s pulsing and fired, covering another blood painter in webbing. Taking advantage of the shrieking creature’s immobilization, she moved closer, stomping on its torso, and fired the poison shot right into its face. “It’s just interesting to me that you didn’t need an escort into Port Valen, but you felt I needed an escort into Jolizpan. On your left!”</p> 
                <p>“And clearly I was correct!” Amircia turned in time to catch the blasted aberration’s teeth around her blade instead of her shoulder. A muttered prayer under her breath as she positioned her pistol alongside the machete, eliminating another blood painter with a shot before it could attempt to make art out of her. She spun around, aiming at another one of the creatures before it could reach Rahaksenwe and swearing when she heard the audible click of her pistol jamming. “Another one!”</p> 
                <p>“Got it!” Rahaksenwe took a half-step back, adjusting the spider gun once more to fire webbing at the blood painter’s feet, causing it to trip and stumble across the tree roots. </p> 
                <p>Amircia took advantage of the creature’s clumsiness, finishing it off with her machete before taking a moment to catch her breath and look around. “Is this... all of them?”</p> 
                <p>“Seems like it, though I have been wrong before.” Rahaksenwe leaned against a tree and slid into a sitting position. She let out a breath and returned her spider gun to its proper place on her back. “You did well, thank you,” she said softly, feeling her connection to the creature she’d made the weapon from.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>“Are you hurt?” Amircia looked the other woman over, concerned about her well-being and wanting to be on the move as quickly as possible.</p> 
                <p>Rahaksenwe shook her head, getting to her feet. “No, thank Desna. They caught your patrol by surprise, but by the time they’d revealed themselves I was already armed and ready. How far until the city?”</p> 
                <p>“A little less than a day. Strange that they would attack so close to the city and not come after you when you were alone.” Amircia nudged one of the bags of the blood painters and frowned, shaking her head. “Strange that they’re here at all, really.”</p> 
                <p>“Perhaps the beauty of the skyline drew them here.” Rahaksenwe gestured to a small, clear space in the trees. “Through here you can see the city outline against the mountains. It took my breath away. Maybe they wanted to make it theirs, too.”</p> 
                <p>Amircia followed her to the clearing and smiled a bit, looking at the outline of Jolizpan. “Maybe.” She glanced back at the scene they had left behind and grew somber. “We should be on the move. I don’t want to attract any other creatures and I’ll need to organize a larger, better trained patrol to come back for our soldiers.”</p> 
                <p>Rahaksenwe nodded solemnly, adjusting her pack and gesturing for Amircia to lead the way. “Remember, I am not as sure-footed as you. Let an old woman keep up.” She chuckled softly at Amircia’s snort and followed her lead.</p> 
                <p>“Your gun.” Amircia commented after they’d walked for some time. “It’s a beast gun.” She glanced sideways at Rahaksenwe, her statement just as much a question as it was a declaration.</p> 
                <p>“Correct. I inherited this one from my grandmother.” Rahaksenwe unholstered her spider gun, feeling it grow warm to her touch as the magic activated. “She was there to see me off on my hunt to find the ogre spider and she was there to welcome me back with herbs and soup when I returned with the components needed.” She smiled a bit at the memory before holstering the gun once more.</p> 
                <p>“So, she was also one to scope the battlefield before firing a single shot?” Amircia asked, adjusting her headdress after ducking beneath a swinging branch.</p> 
                <p>Rahaksenwe nodded, wiping sweat from her forehead. “She was. She taught me to look and listen before firing and to make sure that I kept myself at advantage. Not like my nephew, who spends all year with his screech shooter that he built from a snowy owlbear. He rolls into town like he’s never seen an angry auntie before!”</p> 
                <p>“Did your grandmother oversee his ritual, too?” Amircia asked curiously, using her machete to clear the path before them. The sun was starting to dip below the horizon, and she didn’t like the odd silence that had fallen over the jungle along with the storm clouds overhead. It felt like the creatures in the jungle, usually so chatty and busy before a storm, were preparing for something big.</p> 
                <p>“No.” Rahaksenwe sighed, shaking her head. “She’d already left us by the time he was old enough to hunt on his own. I oversaw his ritual. I’m proud of him, even if he is too cocky for his own good. Makes sense his gun chose him.”</p> 
                <p>Amircia chuckled before pausing and tilting her head. She held an arm out, stopping Rahaksenwe in her tracks. “Do you hear that?”</p> 
                <p>“The thunder?”</p> 
                <p>Amircia shook her head, earrings clinking softly. “The screaming. Sounds like a drake of some kind.”</p> 
                <p>Rahaksenwe took a second to listen before frowning and taking out her spider gun. “Do you have more bullets?”</p> 
                <p>“I always have more bullets. Do you have more energy?”</p> 
                <p>Rahaksenwe cracked a smile, dropping her pack and squaring up alongside Amircia as the sound of crashing foliage and thundering footsteps drew close. “I always have more energy for a good hunt. Lead the way, old friend.”</p>

                <h3>Luis Loza (he/him), Paizo Developer</h3> 
                <p>I’m of Mexican heritage, but always felt like I wasn’t Mexican enough growing up. I’d get weird looks for being into games or for being loud and goofy. I wasn’t always a quiet child that was into the same things as my parents, relatives, or peers. For a long time, I felt like I wasn’t being Mexican the right way, even though that’s a silly notion. A lot of my best friends growing up were white because it seemed like white people could kind of do whatever they wanted to and at best be written off as weird, rather than “not white enough.” Over the years, I learned part of it was because of boundaries as to where Mexican ended and everything else began. Mexicans did A, B, and C, but not X, Y, and Z. I saw it with a lot of people, not just Mexicans. It could be a heritage thing, a religion thing, a sexuality thing, a gender thing. These invisible boundaries were there, and I was tired of them. I like the things I like and that doesn’t make me less Mexican. Part of the reason I enjoy RPGs is because anyone can do anything they want or be whomever they want. I hope that I can extend a hand to other people to climb past these boundaries with our games. Maybe the next person we help can begin tearing these boundaries down so everyone can be who they want without feeling like they’re not doing it correctly.<br> Thanks,<br> Luis Loza</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Diego Valdez (he/him), Paizo contributor and former Customer Service Representative</h3> 
                <p>My name is Diego. I’ve been around the TTRPG industry in a few ways. You may know me from my time as a customer service representative for Paizo. But I have also done a lot of freelance writing for both Pathfinder and Starfinder! For org play I have written two Starfinder Society scenarios and a quest, and I also have three ACG adventures under my belt. I have a little bit of backmatter in an AP for each Pathfinder and Starfinder. You can also find me as a contributor on <em>Alien Archive 3</em>, <em>Near Space</em>, <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, <em>Gods &amp; Magic</em>, and the soon to be released <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em>.</p> 
                <p>I come from northern New Mexico, and I am very proud of my Chicano background and heritage. Since I was young learning about it, embracing it, and living it has always been an important part of who and what I am, even now, here in Washington so far from home. Being able to bring more of that into the worlds I write for is something I have really wanted to do. From a Curandera class, to an adventure revolving around novelas, to setting locations with a Nuevo Mejicano style, I hope to bring it all!</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Joseph Blomquist (he/him), Paizo Contributor</h3> 
                <p>Hola, my friends. I’m Joseph Blomquist, a Nuyorican writer with a decade or so of freelance work around the game industry. I’ve contributed to MWP’s <em>Smallville RPG</em> and <em>Marvel Heroic Roleplaying</em> lines, to Starfinder Society with <em>2-21: Illegal Shipment</em>, <em>3-18: Secrets in Stillness</em>, to Pathfinder Society with the upcoming <em>4-04: The Devil-Wrought Disappearance</em>, among many other projects. With the exception to some PF2 conversions for Legendary’s fantastic <em>Boricubos: The Lost Isles</em>, my Latino culture hasn’t come up as often in my freelance career as I would have liked—but it has influenced my outlook on business and the perception of Hispanic and Latino cultures in all industries, not just ours.</p> 
                <p>Twenty-five years ago, I changed my name. To honor my stepfather, I took his name, forsaking the family name I’d borne for twenty years, Rodriguez. Living in New York, where Rodriguez was a more common surname than even Smith, nothing changed. But moving back to Ohio, where I had spent much of my ill-omened teenage years, I saw a marked difference in how I was perceived. It made me reconsider the importance that a simple name could hold over someone’s life. I’ve made it my mission to help grow voices that may have been ignored or passed over in the past because of their name, sex, skin color, or any other element that makes them outside of the “normal.” I haven’t always been successful, but I’ve tried to include every dark-haired, dark-eyed, swarthy individual I could see in my mind’s eye so that others might see themselves. And to live up to the responsibilities of my name, my family, and nuestra historia.</p> 
                <br> 
                <p>We appreciate all our Hispanic community members, and we invite those who didn’t share their voices as part of this blog to say hi in the comments and share something you’re proud of! We look forward to celebrating you. </p>

                <h3>Tineke Bolleman</h3> 
                <p><em><b>The Menagerie, Familiars, Familiar and Master Abilities</b></em><br> Hello everyone, I am Tineke Bolleman (she/her) and I wrote the familiars and the Menagerie for Grand Bazaar. I love all kinds of animals, so getting to write a shop that puts the animals’ welfare first was great for me. And making new familiars so we all have new friends to take with us on adventures was amazing. Other than writing for Grand Bazaar, I do occasionally write for other Paizo lines. I volunteer for the Organized Play program and I’ve been a tabletop gamer for many years. You can follow me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DireOtterGames" target="_blank">@direottergames</a> for weird game posts, geeking out about animals, and the occasional cat picture.</p>

                <h3>Jessica Catalan (she/her) </h3> 
                <p><em><b>Merrygleam, Toys, Absalom Ads</b></em><br> Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a freelance author and Starfinder Line Developer for the Starfinder Society. I’ve contributed to over 30 projects for Paizo, including <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, <em>Starfinder #39: The Gilded Cage</em>, and <em>PFS #3-99: Fate in the Future</em>. My upcoming releases include <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>, <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em>, and <em>Galactic Magic</em>.</p> 
                <p>For <em>Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar</em>, rather than write for myself, I wrote for my children. I wrote the toy shop, Merrygleam, its quirky shopkeep Ozi and her found family, and the toys and other goodies you’ll find inside. Additionally, I wrote Absalom Ads, a ‘training-manual-by-magical-mail’ company led by an absurdly over-the-top halfling. I hope Merrygleam, in particular, brings some joy to your world.<br> All the best,<br> Jessica</p>

                <h3>Dana Ebert</h3> 
                <p><em><b>Material Changes</b></em><br> Hello! My name is Dana Ebert (she/her), and it was my pleasure to write about Material Changes and its illustrious proprietor, Iltara Clavela. This was my first contribution to Pathfinder, and I'm thrilled to finally be able to share it with all of you—although I must give credit for all the fabulous items available at the boutique to the extremely talented Jessica Redekop!</p> 
                <p>I didn't set out at first to write a transgender story, but the themes of transformation and revelation were so central to Iltara's character that as I penned my first draft, it became the obvious choice. As a trans woman myself, it was nerve-wracking to submit something that felt so personal, but I received nothing but support and encouragement from the outstanding team at Paizo. It is my sincere hope that Iltara's story will mean just as much to other people.</p> 
                <p>In the end, the Grand Bazaar is a triumph of a book, and I'm proud to have been part of it. If you want to know more about what I'm working on, the best places to visit are my Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG" target="_blank">@MistressDanaRPG)</a> or Linktree (<a href="https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG" target="_blank">https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG</a>).

                <p><b><em>Kraken's Ink Tattoo, Tattoos, Worn Items</em></b><br> Hi all! I’m Avi Kool, and I’m senior editor at Paizo. I had the pleasure of being co–edit lead on this book with Patrick Hurley, as well as writing the Kraken’s Ink section and a handful of worn items, including the tattoos. You can see my writing in books such as <em>Bestiary 3</em> (Nosferatu) and <em>Alien Archive 4</em> (The Seen), as well as in the upcoming <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>. My NPC in this book, Arhan, is meant to be a representation of my Sephardic ancestors and their flight from imperial Spain, so this book is very near and dear to my heart. I hope you all enjoy it.</p>

                <h3>Dustin Knight</h3> 
                <p><em><b>Catfish Salvage Solutions, Adventuring Gear</b></em><br> Greetings and welcome to the Grand Bazaar! I'm afraid my friend Tattletail is out getting more Anuli spice right now, but maybe I can help you. Who am I? Here, I'm known for peddling adventuring gear like fake blood packs and smoked goggles. Having the opportunity to write a character with a prosthesis like Tattletail means so much to me. I helped look after my late grandmother for many years, and her strength of character is something that helped inspire my work. You might also know me as a blogger on the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/author/dustin/" target="_blank">Know Direction Network</a>, PFS Venture Lieutenant in King County, and the host of a third-party review <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kitsunewarlock" target="_blank">Pathfinder Twitch Show every Tuesday and Friday</a>!

                <h3>Randal Meyer</h3> 
                <p><em><b>The Rune Room, Accessory Runes</b></em><br> A fan of Pathfinder since the beginning, I have always enjoyed tinkering with the rules in my own games. After joining the online Pathfinder communities, I knew that I wanted to get more involved in producing game content. That journey started with becoming a blogger at Know Direction, where I write my Groundbreaking blog (and sometimes others) and write reviews of the big GenCon releases from Paizo. I had an absolute blast writing Rakuskuk and the Rune Room. Working with the other writers made it so easy to ground him in the lore of Golarion, Absalom, and the Grand Bazaar itself. I am excited to see how his story grows. Accessory Runes are a wonderful addition to the game that I am proud to have worked on. I cannot wait to see where they go from here. When not working directly on new content, I am probably working on my other passion project... the RPG Sage. I am a big fan of playing RPGs via Discord and so I decided to write my own bot to help immerse myself and others into our games! You can learn more about it and give it a test run on my Discord Server at <a href="https://discord.rpgsage.io/" target="_blank">https://discord.rpgsage.io/</a></p>

                <p><em><b>Magic Armor, Staves, Wands</b></em><br> Hi, I’m Jacob W. Michaels, one of Paizo’s freelancers. Normally, I’d tell you here how excited I am for you all to see and play with the staves and wands I wrote. But... no, come in a little closer... closer... OK, good... the truth is I mostly just can't wait for the magic armor and runes I wrote to become available because I’ve been saving up gold pieces for a long time for them on a couple of characters. This was a great book to work on, with wonderful developers and fantastic freelancers, and we hope you love it.

                <h3>Matt Morris</h3> 
                <p><em><b>Skymetals, Spell Trickster</b></em><br> I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including <a href="http://everybodygames.net/" target="_blank">Everybody Game</a> and <a href="https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/" target="_blank">Rogue Genius Games</a>.</p> 
                <p>The Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has given me the opportunity to explore some of my favorite parts of the setting in the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, <em>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em>, and <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, and now I'm excited to be contributing to the biggest market in Absalom. If you manage to smuggle some skymetal out of Numeria or learn the secrets of the Spell Trickster, you'll be in my corner of the Bazaar!</p> 
                <p>I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to <a href="https://mattmorris.carrd.co/">contact me</a> if you are looking for a reliable writer!</p> 
                <p>When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, PA.</p>

                <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> 
                <p><em><b>Mask and Moon</b></em><br> Howdy! I’m Andrew Mullen, and I wrote The Mask and Moon, Absalom’s premier magical dining venue; Erin Roberts did a great job on the accompanying magical food section. Speaking of, why just conjure your food when you can intricately weave cooking and magic to create something truly spectacular! (The Mask and Moon apologizes for any and all beef automaton incidents, past and future)</p> 
                <p>Read Jess’s blog entry here for particular Paizo staff members you should thank - I echo her sentiments 100%. I’m proud to work with such dedicated and talented folks. I’d also like to recognize the folks at Paizo who keep the website running, books flowing in and out of the warehouse, orders and customer concerns handled, and all the less public-facing but no less essential work of running a publishing business.</p> 
                <p>Finally, I and frequent freelancers Isabelle Thorne and Mikhail Rekun are working on the Luminant Age, a 3rd-party campaign setting for Pathfinder 2E. We recently sent <em>Fauna of the Luminant Age</em> to Kickstarter backers, which includes vampire anteater dogs and rats that can make you teleport to death. We’ve got more projects in the works on the run-up to the full campaign setting book—stay updated at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">our Twitter account</a>!</p>

                <p><em><b>Historia Reliquary, Magic Ammunition</b></em><br> Greetings, traveler. You, yes you! Enter the Historia Reliquary and see the legends of Avistan long lost. Garundi history? Oh yes, we have that too, somewhere in the back. But first, look at this arrow. Carved head to look like a rhinoceros. It dates back to the Sixth Army of Exploration in Taldor. I suppose I could part with it, to someone who understands its historical significance...</p> 
                <p>Dave Nelson is a neurodivergent freelancer who is happy to have contributed to Grand Bazaar, writing the magic ammunition and the details of the Historia Reliquary. In particular he is excited to provide positive autistic representation, a cause he feels strongly about, through the proprietor of the Reliquary. Please enjoy!</p>

Credit to Dana Ebert for the rest of the Material Changes entry). I had a great time working on Grand Bazaar with my fellow authors, with Luis and Eleanor as the book's development leads, Mark as the design lead, Patrick and Avi as editorial leads, and all the other people needed to make these books happen. I am privileged to be part of this great and talented network of people who collaborate and create together, and to have such a wonderful, kind, and fierce group of peers</p>

I’m Erin Roberts (she/her), and I’m thrilled to be making my Pathfinder (and published TTRPG) debut in Logbee! I had the absolute pleasure of writing Khisa, who shares my passion for storytelling and social justice, and her Relics &amp; Remembrance shop. I also had a blast creating Alchemical and Magical Tapas to complement The Mask and the Moon, the restaurant written by Andrew Mullen that my tastebuds desperately wish existed.</p> 
                <p>While this is my first Paizo project, there's more to come, so keep an eye out for my work in <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em> and other projects yet to be announced.

I really enjoyed creating a familiar sanctuary and crafting the relationship between quiet Roswine and exuberant Cabbage, who might just a little bit be based on my orange cat, Beans! You may have also seen my writing in a couple of Starfinder Society scenarios, as well as <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, and <em>Bestiary 3</em>. I have a few more entries in upcoming books, including <em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em>.</p>

                <p>When not writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/spellsinsugar" target="_blank">@SpellsInSugar</a>, where you can also sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media. You can keep up with my work, or even contact me for hire, through my website <a href="https://shayjay.carrd.co/" target="_blank">https://shayjay.carrd.co/</a>!</p>

                <h3>Ashton Sperry (they/them)</h3> 
                <p><em><b>Tesyovensku’s Warehouse, Animal Companions, Companion Items</b></em><br> Howdy! I’m Ashton, and I wrote the animal companions, companion items, and the skymetal shop, Tesyovensku’s Warehouse! As someone who came out as nonbinary relatively recently, getting to write up a nonbinary character was a real treasure for me. Plus, I got to whip up some really interesting animal companions, and I think the <em>hosteling statuette</em> and <em>swarmform collar</em> offer some exciting options for characters with companions. Do me a favor and kill a Big Bad with a swarm of pangolins, if you can!</p> 
                <p>If you’d like to keep up with me online, I’m pretty active on Twitter, where you can find me as <a href="https://twitter.com/WhoTweetedThis">@WhoTweetedThis</a>, also known as Game Raccoon. I post up my art there on a regular basis, talk about gaming of the TTRPG and video varieties, and generally try my dangdest to make at least one corner of Twitter a warm, welcoming, inclusive space. And be sure to keep your eyes out for <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>, which I also contributed to, coming April 2022!</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Amber Stewart</h3> 
                <p><em><b>Barghest’s Bin</b></em><br> Hey there! I’m Amber Stewart (previously writing as Todd Stewart) and I’m delighted to have written the Barghest’s Bin for <em>Lost Omens The Grand Bazaar</em>, combining just the right amount of quirky charm with some darker plot hooks. I swear, I write more than planar content, even if I’ve done tons of it over the years! I do love it so very much, but my work on this book let me branch out a bit more from my last several planes-themed projects, but I still couldn’t resist adding in a plot hook with the meladaemon, Inusalia the Lady of Wasting Intoxication, in Omira’s back story, to say nothing of the petrified barghest presently used as a display model for bric-a-brac in the Bin. If you like my content, I’ve got a Patreon at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/KingOfTheCrosstrade" target="_blank">https://www.patreon.com/KingOfTheCrosstrade</a>, and if you want to follow me, you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealShemeska" target="_blank">@TheRealShemeska</a> where I talk about gaming, share quotes from my home game, post stuff about my cats, and ramble about science.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Isabelle Thorne</h3> 
                <p><em><b>Resplendent Rose, Armor and Shield Adjustments, Weapons</b></em><br> Hello, readers! I’m Isabelle Thorne, long-time contributor (five years already!) and proud trans girl. ^_^</p> 
                <p>For the Grand Bazaar, I brought to life the Resplendent Rose and its proprietor, Ralliadra. Like so many of my NPCs, she is also trans and Shelynite, and I’m incredibly happy with how she (and her music shop) turned out! Mechanically, I produced the new armor and shield adjustments, as well as the new (and, in many cases, returning) base weapons. Both of these elements build on content I produced or revised for Adventurer’s Armory 2 back when I was just starting out, and I tried to include other fan-favorites, such as a certain beloved elven weapon. I hope you enjoy my contributions!</p> 
                <p>I’m always working on new gaming content, both for Paizo and for my own Patreon, and perhaps someday for Infinite as well. I’m working on fiction, too, and will hopefully have something to show off soon! I also offer my services as an editor and developer for hire.</p> 
                <p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:kalindlara@gmail.com" target="_blank">kalindlara@gmail.com</a> (work-related matters only, please!), sign up for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ThornyRoseGaming" target="_blank">my Patreon</a> to get exclusive content, or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ThornyRoseGames" target="_blank">Twitter</a>!</p>

                <h3>Jason Tondro</h3> 
                <p><em><b>Lost &amp; Found, Structures</b></em><br> Writing for Grand Bazaar was a delight, and I picked topics that left me a lot of room to be creative: Lost &amp; Found seemed like the kind of shop that could have pretty much anything in it, and my other topic—magical structures—is unique to P2, with a lot of what we like to call “design space.” I could have written twice as much on both topics, if we’d had the room! If you’re looking for more of my work, I’ll be developing Starfinder and Pathfinder Adventure Paths here at Paizo for as long as they let me. You can also find me online <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorcomics" target="_blank">@doctorcomics</a> (Twitter) or on the BAMF Podcast (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BAMFPodcast" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/c/BAMFPodcast</a> or your favorite podcast app) where I do a deep dive on the adventures I have developed, unpacking the entire process from pitch to post-publication.</p>

                <p>But never fear; the Master of Stars is in good hands. Our new First Seeker, Jessica Catalan, has the creative vision and experience to chart a bold course for the Society’s future. Jessica has consistently proven herself as one of Paizo’s most talented, versatile, and dependable freelancers. It’s been a pleasure to work with her, and I’m delighted to bring her on to the Digital Adventures team. </p>

                <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Catalan and I’m beyond thrilled to announce I’ll be taking over as Starfinder Society Developer!</p> 
                <p>Some of you may have heard of me, but for those who haven’t, let me introduce myself. I’m a Canadian, Métis freelance TTRPG author and a regular contributor to both the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs. I’ve been a freelance author for nearly three years, and in that time, I’ve contributed to over 30 Paizo products, including three AP volumes, five Starfinder Society Scenarios, and two Pathfinder Society Scenarios, one of which was this year’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029w3/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Special-399-Fate-in-the-Future"><em>Pathfinder Society Special: #3-99 Fate in the Future</em></a>. I’ve also done freelance development work on the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027rz?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic"><em>Starfinder Galactic Magic</em></a>.</p> 
                <p>Some of my recent work includes Pathfinder’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026l5?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic"><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026mw/discuss&amp;page=1?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc/discuss?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em></a>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zu/discuss?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual#tabs"><em>Starfinder’s Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026mr?Starfinder-Tech-Revolution"><em>Tech Revolution</em></a>, and the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zw"><em>Starfinder #39: The Gilded Cage</em></a>. Some of my upcoming releases include Pathfinder’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029wb?Pathfinder-Book-of-the-Dead"><em>Book of the Dead</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ajm?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Knights-of-Lastwall"><em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029ud?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-176-Lost-Mammoth-Valley"><em>Pathfinder #176: Lost Mammoth Valley</em></a>, and <em>Pathfinder #186: Ghost King’s Rage</em>, and Starfinder’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027rz?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic"><em>Galactic Magic</em></a> and<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis"><em> Drift Crisis</em></a>.</p> 
                <p>Before becoming a freelance author, I managed d20diaries, a personal blog discussing my family’s experiences in d20 gaming. While my blog has long since taken a backseat to freelancing, it still gets a periodic update when time allows. When I’m not playing or writing for my favorite TTRPGs, I’m spending time with my kids. I’m a sucker for a good book, board game, video game, or TCG.</p> 
                <p>Jenny has made a huge contribution to Starfinder and has been a shining light as leader of the Starfinder Society. She’s left me an impressive legacy to measure up to and, while I’m still settling into my new role, I look forward to bringing my best to the Society. I hope you’ll join me.</p>

                <p>Old friends become opponents, and you are suddenly forced to compete against them! Dreadful monsters are summoned in an increasingly difficult challenge. Claim glory points by defeating monsters or by unleashing their wrath on your opponents. Players can constantly modify the Arena, pushing and rotating tiles to reach unexplored areas or to trigger a monster’s attack against other heroes. Each hero has asymmetric abilities and a tailor-made deck from which you can draft items and abilities.</p> 
                <p>Heroes level up during the game by picking up tokens in the Arena to enhance their abilities and access to their deck. The cards’ drafting and the choice of which ability prioritize develop different strategies in the Arena and make each hero unique.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">It’s strange what the mind will do when faced with a significant trauma. Some people scream or fight, others retreat inward, still others flee. As Droven’s storm-tossed ship was flung into the air only to crash and shatter upon the rocky shoals of Arcadia’s coastline, he found a strange calm settle over him. Even as a wooden spar tore free of its rigging and smashed apart his arm, he found himself calmly analyzing the situation.</p> 
                <p>Clearly, the expedition was a failure. He couldn’t find any of the other Pathfinders who had boarded ship with him, though for some reason he couldn’t seem to see out of his left eye anymore, so maybe they were nearby. The ship was clearly a loss, though. Even if its frame were somehow dragged ashore and enough of its crew survived to sail it home, the islets they’d crashed upon seemed unlikely to provide the timber necessary for repairs.</p> 
                <p>As Droven considered the likelihood of the ship even being repairable, another surge from the screaming winds and waves cast the battered wreck into the air once more, this time flipping the ship complete over. Droven’s last thought as he sank beneath the waves was that repairs <em>definitely</em> weren’t going to be an option.</p>

He wields a large bronze hammer that looks like equal parts weapon and tool and is accompanied by a small mechanical goblin with a toolbox built into its back"></a><em> Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</em> 
                <p>Much to his surprise, Droven awoke sometime later. His mouth was parched and dry and he still couldn’t make anything out through his left eye. Attempting to lever himself to his feet revealed that the arm that had likely saved him from a crushing death earlier was now incapable of supporting his weight. Worse, it seemed very likely to become a painful liability in short order. </p> 
                <p>Realizing that he had little time to spare, Droven spent the rest of the day confirming that he was alone on what he discovered to be a small islet, part of a chain ringing a larger bay between him and the continent of Arcadia proper. For supplies, he found only a half-empty wineskin and some brine-soaked hard tack. As he washed the salty biscuits down with stale wine, Droven found himself musing. “Whoever came up with the saying ‘any port in a storm’ almost certainly never saw that storm or this ‘port’. Ah, well. Am I a Pathfinder or not? There is an unexplored horizon ahead and if I’m to live, I’ll need to find a path from here to there.”</p> 
                <p>Twisting the fingers of his right hand into the sign of the key, holy symbol of Abadar, god of civilization, Droven invoked one last blessing to his lost compatriots. “May your works stand forever in the First Vault as testament to your skills and may the god that suits you each best watch over you. And if you have already claimed your final reward, do me a favor and distract any sharks between here and the coast. It’d be a shame to survive such a wreck only to feed the fish.”</p> 
                <p>His prayer complete, Droven grabbed the largest piece of wood he could find in the wreckage for floatation, bound his shattered arm in a tattered sling made from linen he suspected was once part of the wrecked ship’s sails, and began slowly swimming to shore.</p> 
                <p>Each stroke was an exercise in pain and every lapping wave seared his wounds with salt water, but somehow he reached the shore. He tried to stand and walk as the wooden plank ground into the beach, but he made it only a few steps before collapsing in a heap. As exhaustion weighed his eye shut, he thought he saw leather-booted feet moving towards him. Clinging to the optimism that had allowed him to shrug off pain and prejudice throughout his life, he hoped they belonged to someone friendly. Or at least, interesting.</p> 
                <p>Droven’s rescuer was a half-orc man named Darv, older than Droven by many years and with gray staining his long black hair. Darv and his family were from the Illani Plains, many miles to the northwest, but had settled here after a dispute with another nomadic clan had threatened to turn to violence. Darv was a gunsmith, skilled in the crafting of firearms both like and unlike those Droven had occasionally seen make their way to Absalom from Alkenstar. Darv’s son and son-in-law, Joach and Nadkym, operated a small smithy, where they forged armor, clockwork prosthetics, and other mechanical devices on par with, and often superior to, anything Droven had seen produced at Absalom’s Clockwork Cathedral.</p> 
                <p>Darv had been forced to amputate Droven’s arm to save his life, and Joach and Nadkym had already begun work on a prosthetic by the time Droven fully came to his senses and recovered enough from the wreck to move about. With nowhere to go and nothing but time on his hands, Droven joined them at the forge. Much of Droven’s knowledge of alchemy was useless here, so far from the plants and reagents with which he was familiar, but his keen mind was quick to unravel the secrets of clockwork mechanisms and forging techniques. He was able to assist in the construction of his new prosthetic arm, adding modifications to assist him in adventuring when the time inevitably came that he felt well enough to begin seeking a way back home to Absalom.</p> 
                <p>The healing process, as well as acclimating to his new arm, was a slow affair, filled with long and painful days of careful physical therapy to rebuild his strength and renew his coordination. Droven spent much of his free time tinkering with a clockwork construct. “What exactly do you have there?” Darv would ask each day. “All it does is whirp and spin around while looking like a goblin that fell in a smelting vat!” And each day Droven would reply “It reminds me of home, and an old friend. Plus, one day I’ll find a way back to Absalom and I can’t expect your family to accompany me on such a journey! I’ll need company.”</p> 
                <p>Darv’s constant references to the clockwork’s “whirping” stuck, and the little mechanical device—primarily a toolbox but one with an unusual propensity for offering assistance without being asked—was soon known as Whirp to everyone, including Droven.</p>

                <p>As Droven’s inquisitive mind devoured everything Darv and his family could teach on the subject of clockworks and forge techniques, the Pathfinder eventually realized that the time had come for him to seek a way back to Absalom. As he packed a backpack with supplies, Jaoch and Nadkym presented their departing friend with weapons they had forged for him in secret: a hammer integrated with a variety of useful tools for repairing Whirp, and a finely crafted dagger. Darv gave his young friend a pair of armored boots and an admonition. “The soles on these will take you a good while to wear out, my friend. If you still haven’t found a way back home by the time they’re worn thin, come back here, instead. You’ll always have a home.”</p> 
                <p>With a nod and a smile, Droven and his new companion, Whirp, began their long search for a way back to his home in Absalom, starting by heading toward the land Darv and his family had spoken so fondly of—the Illani Plains.</p>

                 <b>Author’s Note</b>
                 <br> I’m Michael Sayre, a designer at Paizo. As a former member of the United States Army, I couldn’t help but see the strength and resilience of the people I served with in Droven, particularly those who lost a limb or suffered significant injuries during their service. I’d like to accompany Droven’s story by bringing your attention to two organizations that are very important to me. The first is the <a href="https://support.woundedwarriorproject.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">Wounded Warrior Project</a>, which provides financial aid and medical service assistance for members of the armed forces injured in the line of duty. The second is the <a href="https://www.amputee-coalition.org/" target="_blank">Amputee Coalition</a>, who provide assistance and advocacy services for people who have lost a limb, were born with limb difference, or who are faced with the possibility of amputation.

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Arvin Utner knew his next words would save him or doom him. His head started to perspire beneath his powdered wig. A rivulet of sweat ran down behind his left ear, leaving a small white smear from the wig’s powder. </p> 
                <p>“Well?” the blonde elf demanded, her features becoming even sharper as her mouth angled downward into a frown. “Was a hood among his belongings, or not?”</p> 
                <p>Arvin looked nervously around his office, knowing nothing there would help him. He’d had this office less than a year, taking over as notary when his hardworking employer retired quite suddenly. The old solicitor had cited the drier climate of Taldor as more conducive to his failing health than that of Galt. Arvin wasn’t surprised at anyone leaving Galt—he was thinking very, very hard about it himself right now—but he’d been surprised that his employer would leave such a prosperous enterprise behind. The senior advocate had ascended to manage the business, her junior advocate had taken her position, and so on, with employees inching up through the ranks. Arvin had gone from junior scrivener all the way to notary, earning a tidy raise and this office. He’d thought it was quite a coup for his career. He heartily regretted it now. </p> 
                <p>The rotund man sitting in the plush chair next to the elf frowned. “Master Utner, it’s a deceptively simple question. But answering on behalf of the deceased could be…unwise.” The man, a pompous aristocrat named Entienne Quibnel, leaned over to examine the papers on Arvin’s desk. Arvin resisted the temptation to throw himself bodily across his desk to block Lord Quibnel’s view. It wouldn’t have helped. He felt his trail of sweat turn into a small river. It was now past sundown, with a light rain falling in the city of Litran. His sweat couldn’t be passed off as anything but nerves.</p> 
                <p>The elf, Zintaya Calbieste, sighed. “Perhaps we cut this meat from a different angle.”</p> 
                <p>Arvin found the metaphor gruesome. He was already thinking much too much of the <em>final blades</em>, the magical guillotines used across Galt to behead criminals and those who threatened Galt’s national security.</p> 
                <p>The elf kept speaking in a folksy drawl that Arvin guessed was an affectation. Secretary Calbieste was the head of Galt’s farming cooperative, a union of ranchers and farmers. The political power that came from controlling food was immense, and Zintaya talked like the dirt-diggers she represented to earn their trust and to bait rivals into underestimating her. Arvin wasn’t falling for it.</p> 
                <p>“The dead fellow, he farmed kohlrabi, I recall.” </p> 
                <p>“Yes, some of the most delicious kohlrabi in Litran,” Lord Quibnel agreed, nodding his jowly head.</p> 
                <p>The elf ignored him. “And the Gray Gardeners—the ones who name wrongdoers, arrest them, and execute them—could be anyone, right? They wear masks while on duty. But other times, they go about as anyone else, digging out traitors and revolutionaries and criminals like they were rabbits in your radish patch. Who’s a Gray Gardener? Maybe a beggar, maybe a wainwright, maybe a noble.”</p> 
                <p>“And maybe a notary,” added Lord Quibnel with a chuckle, “though certainly not <em>Arvin</em>, here.”</p> 
                <p>Arvin hated being referred to in the third person when he was present, but he didn’t hate it enough to protest. Certainly, a Gray Gardener could be anyone—such as a plump aristocrat or an elven union manager. He was certain that Gray Gardener business had brought one of these two visitors into his office this evening.</p> 
                <p>Secretary Calbieste continued, “But Gray Gardeners zealously protect their secrets. And when this kohlrabi farmer was pulped into grease under the wheels of a runaway grain wagon…”</p> 
                <p>Both Arvin and Lord Quibnel grimaced at the graphic description, but the elf seemed unbothered.</p> 
                <p>“…his property was boxed up and shipped here to the city, to a relative who’d died of the pox. So the property came to your firm, Master Utner, and you catalogued it. So, I repeat the question: <em>Was a hood among his belongings, or not</em>?”</p> 
                <p>“As a point of legal clarification,” insisted Lord Quibnel, practically preening, “the deceased was a freeholder indebted to me, so his possessions default to me. This means his secrets do so, as well. Master Utner, don’t answer her question.”</p> 
                <p>“As a counterpoint, Lord Quiverjowl Quibble, as he was a member of the farming cooperative, his affairs are <em>my</em> business. And outing one of the Gray Gardeners is a <em>very</em> serious business.”</p> 
                <p>Arvin closed his eyes, thinking hard. His father had been one of the finest and quickest tailors in the city, with a keen eye for style. He’d been taken away by the Gray Gardeners when Arvin was a boy for “promoting unpatriotic fashion,” whatever that meant, and joined those slain beneath a <em>final blade</em>. But his father never had to thread such a fine needle as Arvin did now. One of these two visitors was a Gray Gardener, Arvin was sure of it. Was it Lord Quibnel, as good as ordering Arvin to keep the dead man’s secret? Or was it Secretary Calbieste, wanting to find out whether Arvin knew about the gray silk hood jumbled among farm clothes?</p> 
                <p>Arvin opened his eyes and spoke slowly.</p> 
                <p>“Farmers have need for rough daily clothing. Fancy things don’t suit them, except for an occasional trip into Litran for a wedding, a mandatory National Day celebration, or a significant execution.” He was stating the obvious, he knew, and his visitors both listened very carefully. He pictured a very fine thread advancing toward the eye of a very small needle.</p> 
                <p>“And while a farmer might have need for a nice cloak or fine hat, he wouldn’t need a hood, no. Not at all.” He started sweating again. His visitors were becoming impatient. The thread in his mental image shook.</p> 
                <p>“And if there had been a gray silk hood among this man’s possessions, and I’m not confirming or denying that there was, only a notarized probate inventory could prove it. And as I’ve not yet concluded the notarization, there might be—officially speaking—no mention in any formal inventory, ever. Regardless of the hood’s existence.”</p> 
                <p>The office was silent. There was an instant after threading a needle when you made a slight tug, just to see whether you’d hit the eye and the thread held or missed it and the thread came free. Arvin thought about that tug.</p> 
                <p>Secretary Calbieste smiled. “A <em>gray silk</em> hood, you say?”</p> 
                <p>Lord Quibnel grinned as well. “Not yet notarized in the inventory, eh?”</p> 
                <p>The doors to the office flew open. Two large figures in rain-soaked capes and wide hats barged into the room. The facemasks they wore obscured their features and their gloved hands reached for Arvin.</p> 
                <p>In his mind, the thread flew free. </p>

You probably already know that Paizo is offering up an amazing Pathfinder adventure called <em>Threshold of Knowledge</em>. But what you might not know is that Syrinscape will be along for the ride! As you and your fellow students work to figure out the mystery of your missing teacher, you’ll have the magic of Syrinscape to help set the scene. </p> 
                <p>We absolutely love the Magaambya setting and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands">Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</a>. We’re working hard right now creating SoundPacks for each book in the series. In fact, <a href="https://syrinscape.com/store/444-kindled-magic/" target="_blank">Kindled Magic</a> is out already, and the next one is on the way. Of course, we jumped at the opportunity to work on an extra SoundPack for this colorful magical institution. Since this is an adventure for Free RPG Day, it only made sense to offer up our immersive sounds and music for free as well. To take advantage of this special offer, all you have to do is log in or <a href="https://syrinscape.com/account/register/" target="_blank">create a free account</a>. Then, on <a href="https://www.freerpgday.com/gamers/" target="_blank">Free RPG Day (October 16th)</a>, head to our <a href="https://syrinscape.com/store/voucher/" target="_blank">Voucher page</a> and enter the code: PaizoFreeRPGDay2021. Once you do, our <em>Pathfinder: Threshold of Knowledge SoundPack</em> will appear in your library for free!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">While obviously a lot has happened in the past few weeks, I wanted to give you all a recap of Gen Con Online, our last major convention of the year.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <ul> 
                 <li>We ran over 400 tables of Pathfinder Society, Starfinder Society, and the Adventure Card Society, with 131 GMs running games.</li> 
                 <li>This year’s Pathfinder and Starfinder Specials premiered at the event to great fanfare. These linked specials were a lot of fun to produce behind the scenes, and we hope you all enjoyed them! They are now available for conventions to request and will be available for sale next August.</li> 
                 <li>Our Gen Con charity auction raised $5,886 for Take This and Trinity Haven, Gen Con’s chosen partner charities. Thanks to all who participated in these efforts!</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>We hope you all enjoyed this event, as well as all our preceding events. Our major convention season has concluded for the year, though local conventions are still happening year-round with Paizo support. We encourage you all to find your local group and join up with their events!</p>

                <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                <p>Last week, I posted a longer blog post about the current sanctioning status, so <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shtp?September-2021-Sanctioning-Status-Update">I’ll link you over there</a> and summarize some of the big news:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><em>Tech Revolution</em> is now sanctioned for Starfinder Society!</li> 
                 <li>The priority order for sanctioning the upcoming Pathfinder books is <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, followed by <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>.</li> 
                 <li>Other adventures and Adventure Paths are in progress and will be released as close to street date as we can get them.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>One note I wanted to mention on the upcoming Pathfinder hardcovers: both books have accessibility and mobility devices in them. These are a little bit trickier to sanction than normal rules content; we want to ensure that you can play characters that use these devices to adventure, but we want to prevent using them to power-game, or their abuse at the tables by people who aren’t interested in representing adventurers of all capabilities. As such, we’re working on rules language that threads the needle between “policing who is <em>really</em> disabled” and “allowing open access to all adventurers at all times.” This is something I’m very invested in getting right, and we’ll be consulting with experts on the topic. As a result, sanctioning for these options may be slightly delayed behind the rest of the books. We’ll keep you informed, thank you so much for your patience!</p> 
                <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                <p>This month, we had one GM reach their fifth nova for Starfinder Society. We also welcome our second and third five-glyph GMs for Pathfinder Society (Second Edition)!</p> 
                <p><b>5th Nova</b>: Michael Beck<br> <b>5th Glyph</b>: Jocelyn Hamilton, Andrew Watson</p> 
                <p>Congratulations to our new 5 Star and 5 Glyph GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                <p>Now that our new specials have premiered to the world, we have a number of upcoming conventions offering them. Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">conventions calendar</a> for a full list, and be sure to click on the events for more details.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <h2>OMINOUS TIDES</h2> 
                <p itemprop="description">“REAGENTS!”</p> 
                <p>The goblin, Fumbus, came bounding out of the palms onto the beach with something in his hands raised triumphantly high. </p> 
                <p>Valeros had to repress the urge to pinch his brow and sigh. Whatever the excitable alchemist was on about, Valeros did not share his enthusiasm, and had a sinking feeling that was not about to change. </p> 
                <p>He had already chipped the blade of his sword beyond a whetstone’s help hacking down a half-dozen mahogany trunks for a raft; his mood wasn't going to be improving anytime soon.</p> 
                <p>“Reagents!” Fumbus skipped up to Valeros to show off his discovery. As soon as they got near Valeros’s nose, there was no mistaking what the blackish seed-sized pellets in the goblin's hands were.</p> 
                <p>“Eeuughh!” He reared back out of smelling distance. “Don't shove it my face, you—” Valeros thought back to all the innumerable goblins who had cursed at him to think of a word to really express his displeasure, and then gave up on it. “We're already up 'reagent' creek without a paddle as it is.”</p> 
                <p>Fumbus giggled and dropped the bat guano into the patched-up grog barrel lying amid the hundreds of other tide-tossed fragments from their reef-broken ship strewn across the beach. After a moment of rubbing his hands together, the goblin cackled hysterically in a way that Valeros had come to associate with imminent explosions.</p> 
                <p><em>“REAGENTS!”</em></p> 
                <p>“I get it! I can <em>speak</em> Taldane!” Valeros called after him, but the goblin, mercifully, had dashed back into the waving blade-bushes that marked the edge of the jungle, presumably toward the source of more nocturnal leavings.</p> 
                <p>He was as puzzled at Fumbus’s grog barrel as he was at Fumbus himself. Merisiel had challenged him to a drinking contest over that same barrel earlier that evening, back when they were all still on the same Arcadia-bound vessel. The voyage had been so long and tedious that he'd forgotten his two rules of drinking contests: one, never getting into a drinking contest with someone several centuries older than you; and two, never get into a drinking contest when there wasn’t more on the line than bragging rights. The problem with drinking contests was that no matter who wins, the next morning you’re both losing, and neither of you can remember who won anyway. Drinking was supposed to be fun, not a competition, after all.</p>

                 <h3>Fumbus and Valeros make the most of the tools at hand in this illustration by Firat Solhan from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a></h3>
                </div> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <br> 
                <p>The last memory he had was of the white-haired, black-eyed elf’s face going all fuzzy. Then, all of a sudden, everything was salty, wet, and getting dark fast—in that order. It took all his strength to kick his armored body upward, toward the sun shimmering above him on the ocean's surface; it took all his wits to keep from crying out and filling his lungs with seawater.</p> 
                <p>The bay of this seemingly uninhabited island was choked with the wrecked detritus of the brigantine, and every once in a while, the tides disgorged a passenger or sailor that Valeros recognized when they were onboard, and alive. Thank the Accidental God that all his friends had survived the wreck; sadly, they appeared to be the only ones. </p> 
                <p>That is, except Fumbus, whom Valeros had not realized stowed away on their vessel back in Absalom until the goblin popped out from beneath a coil of beached rope with a sputtering cry that scared him half to death. The self-taught alchemist soon began collecting random crap—literally—and filling his reclaimed cask with it.</p> 
                <p>Valeros had no idea what Fumbus was making, and once again found himself wishing Seoni was here to tell him. Everyone else had fanned out to look for food or friendly locals, and he had been left behind, as per usual, to do the grunt work because he had the muscles. He had spent several hours picking out, cutting down, and pruning the logs, then laying four side-by-side near the water’s edge—to make the completed raft easier to launch—then two under and above those at either end as pressure bars. By the time he was pulling down vines from trees, he was contemplating selling his soul for a drink, any drink—even water! The sun had had several hours to bake him inside his own breastplate. He felt like an engorged sweat sponge.</p> 
                <p>He thought he had grabbed the sturdiest vines he could find, but when he tugged the binding for the two front crossbeams together, the cord snapped in half, and he dropped on his backside in the sand.</p> 
                <p>Loud laughter behind him brought him to his feet, drawing his wrecked sword more from pique than caution. The goblin had finished whatever contraption he had been working on, having lashed on a conical nose to the top of the barrel with some of the vines Valeros had set aside for his raft.</p> 
                <p>“Okay, you!” Valeros pointed his sword at the lashed-together barrel. “This is what we call 'antisocial behavior.' <em>I</em> tore down those vines for my raft. <em>I</em> am trying to save our lives by getting us off this gods-forsaken island. <em>You</em> are yelling things in my face and stealing my stuff! Those vines are mine by right!” </p> 
                <p>He stepped toward the cone-headed barrel, but Fumbus bared his sharp, tiny teeth and leapt in front of him. “No no no no no!”</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Valeros sighed. “You know what? You win. I’m sick of this yesterday. I'm gonna go lie down on the ground over there. Maybe when Kyra returns, she can tell me what's going on. But I find everything you do unfathomable.” </p> 
                <p>He retreated up the beach to the shade of the palms, dropped down onto his back, and prayed for a swift death</p> 
                <p>The goblin’s head loomed into his field of vision. The makeshift goggles the alchemist wore magnified his eyes so they bulged like magic orbs. </p> 
                <p>“Do you want to see?” Fumbus whispered without prompting and unscrewed a scroll case he kept slung across his back</p> 
                <p>“Um, no. That's alright. You really don’t need to...” But Fumbus was already pulling out a complex diagram, unfurling it on the fighter’s chest. Valeros raised his head far enough to see that it depicted a barrel, not unlike the one Fumbus was messing about with at the moment. Various incomprehensible symbols had been scrawled across it, but one in particular stood out: the word “Droven” bearing the look of a signature more than footnotes of a technical schematic. </p> 
                <p>“Droven showed Fumbus how to make something like this once,” the goblin said. “With better supplies, and different reagents, but I can make it work.”</p> 
                <p>Intrigued, Valeros sat up on his elbows and studied the chart. “Your old half-orc buddy? You miss him a lot, don’t you, Fumbus? We’ve all lost friends, little guy, and I know it can be hard to move on.” He felt suddenly guilty for giving the goblin such a hard time.</p> 
                <p>“Droven <em>is</em> lost,” Fumbus blurted with a surprising ferocity. “But he can help us even when he’s missing!</p> 
                <p>“Huh?”</p> 
                <p>Fumbus ran down to the barrel halfway down the beach, tugging Valeros’s arm to follow. “Come, come! Make this way!” </p> 
                <p>“For Cayden's sake, Fumbus, I just laid down!” </p> 
                <p>When they reached the barrel, Fumbus snapped two shards of flint together, and a spark sprung to the oil-slick wick Valeros now saw dangled from one side. It began to fizzle and shorten.</p> 
                <p>Fumbus gesticulated wildly at the cove below. “Into the sea it goes, unless you also want to explode!”</p> 
                <p>“Oh, <em>those</em> kind of 'reagents!’ Well, why didn’t you say so in the first place?” </p> 
                <p>With a curse, Valeros hefted the sputtering barrel on his shoulder and threw it as hard as he could down the beach. It bounced and arced into the water, floating out several yards… </p> 
                <p>Suddenly, Fumbus threw up his arms, blocking his face, and Valeros copied him, just as the barrel exploded into a massive waterspout that shot straight up into the clear blue sky and dropped a curtain of seawater onto their heads, along with a shower of springs, cogs, and steaming twists of metal. He managed to grab a bronze tentacle out of the air before it landed on his head.</p> 
                <p>An overturned clockwork vessel bobbed in the surf, semi ovoid and in the shape of an octopus’s head. Half of its grasping tentacles were severed and sputtered with silvery light. Some still grasped chests and gold statues and other valuables the apparatus had been trying to loot from the wreck on the ocean floor.</p> 
                <p>Stumbling out one of the shattered bulbous portholes where the octopus’s eyes would be came the apparatus's operator, pale Chelaxian skin bleeding and satin finery shredded from numerous miniature shrapnel wounds.</p> 
                <p>“Nice reflexes,” Fumbus said, nodding at the clockwork limb Valeros was still clutching.</p> 
                <p>Valeros laughed mirthlessly. “Lying in wait for hapless ships to come by then scavenging their cargo, eh?” </p> 
                <p>The Chelaxian coughed up seawater and tried to swing a boathook-like weapon in his general direction, but Valeros didn’t even bother drawing his sword. He backhanded the submariner across the face with the bronze tentacle and knocked him flat on his back in the surf.</p> 
                <p>Valeros placed a heavy boot on the man’s chest, pushing him into the soft, wet sand. “You just let me know when you’re ready to tell me everything I want to know about whatever scam it is you’re running here.”</p> 
                <p>“And where our friends are,” Fumbus demanded.</p> 
                <p>“Yeah! Tell us what you know about them, too!” Valeros glanced back at the treeline. The rest of his party had been gone an unusually long time.</p> 
                <p>The Chelaxian spat. “The others will have taken care of them by now. I was just sent to dig through the wreckage, but the others got to have…a lot more fun.”</p> 
                <p>“Got another barrel like that in you, Fumbus?” Valeros frowned. “I have a feeling this chump and his metal contraption are going to be the least of our worries.”</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“No no no no <em>nononoooo</em>!”</p> 
                <p>Trying frantically to keep his load of boxes and bushels more or less balanced, Hanish kicked at the grinning dog that was… well, that was dogging his path through the crowded Grand Bazaar. The big white mutt wagged its tail happily at the game, dodged his foot effortlessly, and darted back in for another try at the sausages spilling from an overstuffed hamper on Hanish’s hip.</p> 
                <p>Hanish swore, but he couldn’t pause to fix the hamper or shoo the dog away. He was running late, and his customers were never patient. A double-humped camel, bent under its own mountain of chests and caskets, met his gaze with a long-lashed eye, and Hanish felt a profound understanding pass between them. Two beasts of burden, vital to the lifeblood of the city, but forever unappreciated.</p> 
                <p>All around them, merchants and buyers haggled under a dizzying array of flags, banners, wicker arbors, and sun-bleached, dusty tents. Dried fruits and ribbed purple seedpods from the forests of Kyonin dangled from poles next to tables displaying thick white pelts from the halls of the Linnorm Kings, Qadiran brass pots that shone like gold, and spiked Nidalese shadowglass sculptures. Ink-painted scrolls advertised family businesses that had held the same market stalls for centuries, while a steel-feathered parrot perched on a passing woman’s shoulder screeched “Scales and teeth! Scales and teeth! Metal skymetal scales and teeth! From star-dead wastes of Numeria to you! Two days only! Scales and teeth!”</p> 
                <p>Off to the right, a troupe of puppeteers was putting on a bedraggled but enthusiastic performance of “Iomedae’s Griffon” for an audience of enraptured youngsters and heckling drunks. Just as Hanish hustled by, the puppet-stage’s curtains blew open around a bellowing, steam-snorting contraption that was probably supposed to be Segruchen the Iron Gargoyle. The troupe’s musician banged her drums, the puppeteers shouted in rehearsed dismay, and a nearby packhorse reared and shrieked in panic, terrified by the clanking menace and its clamor.</p> 
                <p>Hanish ducked around the animal’s flying hooves, congratulated himself for the quick save, and then promptly tripped over a boy wearing a gaudy sandwich board touting Gerig’s Liquid Courage, the drink of (mostly deceased) champions.</p> 
                <p>“No no no no <em>nononoooo</em>!”</p> 
                <p>Scarves and grapes and apples flying in his wake, Hanish windmilled his arms in a panicked jig under the swinging balance of his load. Finally he stumbled to a stop, panting and sweating but basically upright. A nearby street beggar applauded briefly. Hanish sketched a bow, or as much of one as he dared, and hurried onward. That dog was, somehow, still at his heels.</p>

                </div> 
                <br> 
                <p>Hanish spotted a break in the crowds and hurried through to a storefront festooned with bits of punched metal hung from silken strings. The chimes sparkled and sang against his load of packages as he knocked on the glass-gemmed door.</p> 
                <p>“You’re late,” snapped the rotund half-orc who opened the door for him. Her tusks were painted with fanciful Osiriani hieroglyphs, and a jade Tien ornament hung from her earlobe, but her accent was as all Absalom. “I’ll wager you’ve stained and wrinkled my wares, too.”</p> 
                <p>Hanish tapped the glowing bauble on his wrist. The bobbing crystal still shone blue: he’d made the delivery window. “Not late, and your scarves are pristine, Mistress Verity.” <em>Unlike poor Ghemel’s lunch</em>, he almost added, but then decided not to badmouth his own services. It was hard enough prying tips out of Mistress Verity already.</p> 
                <p>The half-orc grunted, taking the heavy brown chest from Hanish’s aching arm and unlatching it with two quick flips. She ruffled through the fine embroidered silks and gossamer scarves, holding this one or that up to the light until she was satisfied that, indeed, Hanish had delivered the full load safely.</p> 
                <p>She hauled the chest inside and tossed Hanish a pair of copper pennies. “Commemorative,” she said, and slammed her door.</p> 
                <p>Hanish looked at the pitiful coins in his palm. They were commemorative, all right, but one celebrated the elevation of a new trademaster and the other was about some giant fish getting hauled out of the harbor, so neither was worth more than the copper it was stamped on. Mistress Verity’s generosity had struck again.</p> 
                <p>The bauble on his wrist was starting to pulse violet. Hanish grimaced, rebalanced his remaining packages, and ran.</p> 
                <p>He dropped the fruit and sausages at Ghemel’s — there was a decent tip, even though half the apples were bruised and the dog had managed to steal two sausages — and went on, faster now that the heaviest packages were gone. At Chivvi’s Apothecary, he dropped off a box of stonestalk eggs; the stiff-armored, distinctively shaped caterpillars had developed a predictable reputation as aphrodisiacs. At the Wandlin steam baths, he delivered frost teas and ice wines harvested from the Crown of the World and prized by heat-bathers in need of quick cooling.</p> 
                <p>The last stop on his route was the best: Felifer’s Bibliovary, where priceless texts were framed like gems on bronze and silver shelves, and the air carried a deep, calming perfume of ancient wood and yellowing paper. Walking into Felifer’s was like stepping into a timeless, never-hurried world of learning, and it always made Hanish wistful for the life he’d never lead. Maybe if his parents had been richer, if they’d been able to afford more schooling… well, it was no use dreaming about all that.</p> 
                <p>But for a few precious minutes, whenever he had a delivery at Felifer’s, he could breathe in that sepia-scented tranquility and pretend.</p> 
                <p>The door was already ajar when Hanish arrived. “Hello?”</p> 
                <p>There was no answer. Hanish stepped inside and set down his delivery box. The dog came with him, even though he’d already dropped off the sausages. The smell of blood was retch-thick in the shop, and the dog whined softly, lashing its tail.</p> 
                <p>“Hello?”</p> 
                <p>Nothing. Gulping, Hanish picked his way through the glowing bookshelves to Felifer’s back office. Shadows bobbed and spun away from him across the gleaming metal, teasing his eyes with premonitions of doom. The dog came with him, and though Hanish couldn’t help worrying that the old bookseller would scold him for bringing an animal into the shop, he was glad for its company. He didn’t want to be alone here.</p> 
                <p>The back office was empty. Quiet. Nothing out of place except a paper-wrapped parcel on Felifer’s desk, a note written in the bookseller’s crabbed blue pen, and the sigil-stamped luminous tag that meant Hanish was meant to take it for delivery.</p> 
                <p>Hanish bent closer to read the note. “To Pathfinder Agent Berovic, Skywatch. All speed.” That meant a breakneck run to deliver the parcel at any hour of the day or night, and triple pay if he made it within the hour. Right now, with the lull between Absalom’s daytime commerce and when the nightlife really lit up, the target should be easy to hit. Good money.</p> 
                <p>But maybe dangerous. The last two words of the message were shaky and dribbled downward, as if Felifer were losing the strength to write. Bloody fingerprints marred the paper wrapping, which bulged and sagged in its strings with uncharacteristic sloppiness.</p> 
                <p>The dog whined again. Hanish patted its head, then reached for the parcel. It was light and fragile-feeling, as though whatever was in there were dried, or hollow. Something rattled softly inside.</p> 
                <p>Already the luminous tag was starting to lose its pearly pallor. If Hanish made to Skywatch while the light was still blue, he’d get triple pay.</p> 
                <p>If he didn’t, he might land in something worse than he’d ever imagined.</p> 
                <p>Well, it wouldn’t be the first time his job had careened him into trouble, and if Desna smiled on him, it wouldn’t be the last. The City at the Center of the World never slept, never stopped, and held uncountable adventures. Hanish had taken this job because he wanted to grab his share of those adventures, and so far, he’d gotten all that he could handle.</p> 
                <p>Hanish tucked the parcel into his satchel, snapped its tag onto his bracelet, and ran.</p> 
                <p>One more delivery today.</p>
