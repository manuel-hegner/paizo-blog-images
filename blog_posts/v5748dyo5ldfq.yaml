  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: A Small Update</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Friday, May 11, 2012</p> \n   <p>We're getting to deep into the previews\
  \ for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> Pathfinder Battles\
  \ set that I've almost run out of pictures to show you! A handful of minis remain\
  \ yet to be revealed, but I'm pleased to report that some of them are among the\
  \ coolest in the set!</p> \n   <p>Today I'd like to show off two Small miniatures\
  \ from the set that leave a very big impression.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120511-Kobold.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120511-Kobold_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Up first is the dreaded Kobold Champion!\
  \ This lizard-like warrior woman might look a bit like a rank-and-file kobold, but\
  \ she's in fact encountered late in the campaign, and boy does she ever pack a surprising\
  \ punch! Although the Rise of the Runelords campaign contains only one Kobold Champion,\
  \ we decided to slot this figure in the common rarity, reasoning that game masters\
  \ can always use more well-sculpted kobolds to swarm over their players at any level!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>It's probably a bit difficult to tell from the small photos here, but\
  \ this figure has a remarkable number of paint steps for both a common miniature\
  \ and a Small miniature, making her really stand out despite her diminutive size.\
  \ From the paint gradient on her legs and tail to the bright blue tongue, this is\
  \ one of several minis in the set where I think to myself \"I can't believe this\
  \ awesome mini is a common!\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/20120511-Redcap.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120511-Redcap_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Up next is the Redcap, a fey menace from\
  \ real-world mythology with a long history in fantasy gaming. To my knowledge, no\
  \ Redcap has previously appeared as a prepainted plastic miniature, which makes\
  \ it a great addition to the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ set. This little guy comes with the appropriate metal boots, oversized scythe,\
  \ and the eponymous red cap. As fitting the Redcaps' role in the <a href=\"<a href=\"\
  \ products btpy8mqq>Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path Anniversary Edition</a>\
  \ campaign, we've slotted the Redcap in as a common, so you can easily collect a\
  \ bunch of them.</p> \n   <p>That's it for this week's preview. The set contains\
  \ at least two more size-Small figures, as well as a few more exciting surprises.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>There's lots of great stuff yet to come! Enjoy the weekend, and don't\
  \ forget to get in some gaming!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n\
