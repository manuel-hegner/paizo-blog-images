  date\">Tuesday, June 5, 2007</p> \n    <p>One question we've run into repeatedly\
  \ as we introduce the new world in which both <i>Pathfinder</i> and the GameMastery\
  \ Modules will be set is, \"What makes your campaign setting different?\" In order\
  \ to answer that, we've asked each member of the editorial design team—collectively\
  \ known as \"The Pit\"—what <i>they</i> think sets our world apart.</p> \n    <h2>Erik\
  \ Mona (Publisher)</h2> \n    <p>\"The GameMastery world will contain a wider mixture\
  \ of influences that most available on the market, making it easier to find a home\
  \ for the type of adventures you and your friends are interested in playing. The\
  \ world doesn't come burdened with a single overarching plot or expectation of play\
  \ style, but rather allows for a wide variety of campaigns. Do you feel like exploring\
  \ a savage frontier? The Lands of the Linnorm Kings or the Hold of the Mammoth Lords\
  \ provide perfect backdrops. Players who enjoy urban roleplaying and intrigue will\
  \ be drawn to the political world of Absalom or the treacherous courts of devil-tainted\
  \ Cheliax. Players interested in science fantasy will find plenty to like in the\
  \ barbarian nation of Numeria, greatest of the River Kingdoms, where a powerful\
  \ sovereign and his council of witches rule from the ancient ruins of a mighty vessel\
  \ fallen from space. They might even get a chance to explore the green and red worlds\
  \ in the heavens above. The code-phrase we've been using for development of the\
  \ world beyond Varisia (and including it) is \"Planet of Adventure,\" because it\
  \ is a place meant to accommodate great campaigns. We're hoping one of them will\
  \ be yours.\"</p> \n    <h2>James Jacobs (Editor-in-Chief, <i>Pathfinder</i>)</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I think that the big thing for our campaign setting is the fact that,\
  \ unlike most other settings, we aren't kicking things off with a line of setting\
  \ books that detail regions, religions, cities, and histories of the world. We don't\
  \ want to drown our readers in canon. Rather, we'll be developing our world primarily\
  \ through adventures written by the best writers we can find. Each adventure in<i>\
  \ Pathfinder</i> or the GameMastery line can serve double-duty, because once you've\
  \ run the adventure, there'll remain parts in there that you can use to expand your\
  \ own campaign world, be it details of a city, a new monster, a haunted forest,\
  \ a new religion, or whatever. Sooner or later we'll certainly have enough material\
  \ to cull from the adventures that we'll be able to produce a setting book or something\
  \ like that, but it won't have been designed in a vacuum. Everything in our campaign\
  \ world will evolve out of things that are already adventures, rather than evolve\
  \ from ideas that then have to be turned into adventures.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, and\
  \ demon lords and archdevils and celestial paragons and archangels can grant spells\
  \ to their cultists. That's pretty cool too.\"</p> \n    <h2>Jason Bulmahn (GameMastery\
  \ Brand Manager)</h2> \n    <p>\"One of our primary goals is to give a campaign\
  \ setting that uses all of the advantages of the modern rules set while still maintaining\
  \ a sort of \"classic\" middle-fantasy feel. We want our world to be one that has\
  \ a place for almost any sort of play style without flooding GMs and players with\
  \ a bunch of assumed baselines that make some play-styles impossible or difficult\
  \ to run. If you want to use our setting to run an Egyptian-styled adventure, you\
  \ can certainly do that, but it doesn't preclude a swashbuckling game, a feudal\
  \ knights adventure, a lich hunt, or an urban political game. The trick is balancing\
  \ these themes and flavors that everyone is familiar with, while still giving it\
  \ a fresh take that fires up the imagination and allows for GMs to give it their\
  \ own personal flair. After all, we want this to be your campaign too.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"And, of course, we got ninjas.\"</p> \n    <h2>James Sutter (Assistant Editor,\
  \ <i>Pathfinder</i>)</h2> \n    <p>\"My biggest problem with most campaign settings\
  \ is the canon. While as a writer I understand well the joy of having your ideas\
  \ set in stone, of watching people take what you've written and hold it up as The\
  \ Way It Is, with gaming I find that it's ultimately a decadent and self-indulgent\
  \ pleasure, and a little goes a long, long way.</p> \n    <p>\"When I first started\
  \ working at <i>Dungeon</i>, canon and I went head-to-head on a daily basis. It\
  \ seemed like every time I had an idea I thought was interesting, someone smiled\
  \ sympathetically and said, \"Yeah, but you can't do that because...\" As a GM,\
  \ who wants to be told \"no\" all the time?</p> \n    <p>\"That's what makes our\
  \ new setting so exciting to me. Sure, any new setting will have less baggage than\
  \ one that's been around for years, but throughout the design process of this world,\
  \ we've tried to always keep that \"less is more\" mentality in mind. This is our\
  \ world, but it's also the players' world, and every time you tell a GM or player,\
  \ \"You can't do that,\" you've just killed a fun session. It's too easy for a setting\
  \ to reach a point where, through years of development and source material, it's\
  \ been detailed down to the last commoner, with no room left to invent, explore,\
  \ and innovate. Either that, or the broad, sweeping changes you've made to distinguish\
  \ your setting (\"All elves in our setting are XXX!\") end up alienating portions\
  \ of your audience. The rallying cry at our development meetings has been, \"Never\
  \ say never.\" We've all put in a lot of work to make this setting as interesting\
  \ as possible, and there will undoubtedly be official supplements someday to support\
  \ the adventures which are the setting's driving force, but know that as we go along,\
  \ we realize that this isn't just our sandbox—it's the sandbox of everyone who does\
  \ us the honor of playing in it. And with that honor comes a certain responsibility.\"\
  </p> \n    <h2>Jeremy Walker (Assistant Editor, GameMastery)</h2> \n    <p>\"Often,\
  \ a campaign setting is defined not so much by what elements it includes, but instead\
  \ by what it precludes. Specific themes, elements, and quirks help players and GMs\
  \ connect with the setting, but oftentimes the very things that first attract gamers\
  \ become the things that drive them away, as, frustrated by the setting's inability\
  \ to adapt, they move on to the next unique setting, only to repeat the process\
  \ down the road when that setting's fresh ideas become stale.</p> \n    <p>\"One\
  \ might think, then, that the solution is to provide a setting as generic as possible,\
  \ so that any story can be dropped in just about anywhere. And yet people are looking\
  \ for more in a campaign setting than a blank sheet of canvas. They want a world\
  \ in which to tell their own stories in their own way, but they also want a living\
  \ world that seems real. In this way, a campaign setting is like a matte painting\
  \ on a movie set. A richly detailed backdrop that, while it exists independently\
  \ of the characters in the movie, gives their actions context and meaning beyond\
  \ their individual stories. To create a purely generic world is like shooting a\
  \ movie in front of a black and white painting—it is immediately, and obviously,\
  \ unreal.</p> \n    <p>\"So how to provide a rich and detailed world without running\
  \ the risk of our conventions and ideas becoming stale? Our solution is to provide\
  \ a campaign setting that includes many distinct areas, each containing their own\
  \ themes, characters, stories, and ideas. Each area of our world is almost a mini-setting\
  \ all to itself. Vibrant and lifelike, ready for any story you might wish to tell.\
  \ And when you tire of a particular style of gaming, why there is always something\
  \ new waiting over that mountain, up that river, or across that sea.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <h2>Mike McArtor (Associate Editor, GameMastery)</h2> \n    <p>\"1. <b>Interaction:</b>\
  \ One of the things that sets Paizo apart is our willingness to listen to those\
  \ who invest in our creation. Spend some time on the messageboards and I think you'll\
  \ discover pretty quickly that we interact with our readers, and those interactions\
  \ are never one-way. We're not going to create the setting through democracy, but\
  \ when the masses speak, we tend to listen.</p> \n    <p>\"2. <b>Inclusiveness:</b>\
  \ The newest edition of The World's Most Popular Fantasy Roleplaying Game (TWMPFRPG\
  \ for short) is all about showing you what you <i>can</i> do, not telling you what\
  \ you <i>can't</i>. In that spirit, our setting is going to allow for whatever you\
  \ want to include in your campaign. Everything does—or at least can—exist in our\
  \ setting.</p> \n    <p>\"3. <b>Variety:</b> It's the spice of life. It's also what\
  \ happens when you put the seven of us in a room, add caffeine, and shake. Then\
  \ open the floodgates to guys like Baur and Logue and man oh man, have you got something!\
  \ If you like dinosaurs and Cthulhu, talk to Jacobs over there. If you like your\
  \ games a little more whimsical, hey man, I've got your back. From the deepest pits\
  \ of depravity to the most ludicrous non-sequiturs, you'll find it somewhere in\
  \ this place.</p> \n    <p>\"4. <b>History:</b> We have the advantage of looking\
  \ back on three decades of what has come before to see what worked. (And of even\
  \ greater importance: what didn't.) We're building off the initial groundwork of\
  \ titans—Gygax, Kuntz, Greenwood, and Grubb, for starters. The seven of us are keenly\
  \ aware of those who came before, and we want to ensure they (and more importantly,\
  \ YOU) approve of our creation.\"</p> \n    <h2>Wesley Schneider (Associate Editor,\
  \ <i>Pathfinder</i>)</h2> \n    <p>\"We're only letting the coolest players and\
  \ GMs use our world. Rabid, endlessly yodeling goblin warchanters will infest the\
  \ homes of those found unworthy.\"</p> \n   </blockquote> \n  </div> <a href=\"\
