  \ on the road to soon release our <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-12-Ashes-of-Discovery\"\
  >twelfth</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4m?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-111-In-Pursuit-of-the-Scoured-Past\"\
  >thirteenth</a> scenarios, which is a pretty great milestone! One thing I've certainly\
  \ noticed over the course of the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild's development\
  \ is a wide array of opinions and thoughts with regards to the tier structure for\
  \ the campaign. I wanted to take some time to discuss some of our internal thoughts\
  \ on this, and what players can expect to see going forward.</p> \n    <p>First\
  \ off, let me address sanctioning. Everyone loves to see Adventure Path sanctioned\
  \ right away, and I'm proud to say that we've had a pretty good track record with\
  \ sanctioning the <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/deadSuns\">Dead Suns\
  \ Adventure Path</a>. So far, the first three adventures are sanctioned. We hit\
  \ a bit of a snag with the fourth adventure, namely because of convention season\
  \ creeping up and requiring a lot of attentionâ€”seriously, who'd think that an interactive\
  \ special and three months of early releases for scenarios would take so much effort?!\
  \ I hope to look at sanctioning for <a href=\"/products/btpy9zkj?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Ruined-Clouds\"\
  ><em>The Ruined Clouds</em></a> in the coming weeks, but I want players to know\
  \ that this project has not been forgotten. Now, with that being said, the fourth\
  \ Dead Suns installment is intended for characters of 7th to 8th level, which currently\
  \ represents some of the highest-level characters in the campaign. How about we\
  \ talk about that...</p> \n    <p>Taking a trip in the \"way back when machine\"\
  , the Organized Play team had a series of meetings to discuss the new Tier structure\
  \ for the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. The idea to condense tiers came\
  \ from an early brainstorming session sparked by fellow developer, Linda Zayas-Palmer.\
  \ This led to some future meetings where Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton\
  \ and I sat down to create a sort of road map for our first season. We've stuck\
  \ to the roadmap since the campaign started, making necessary adjustments for our\
  \ change to two scenarios per month, and it's worked out very well. I don't want\
  \ to spoil all of our upcoming scenario plans, but I do want to give some highlights\
  \ for things that players and event organizers can expect to see over the coming\
  \ months. </p>\n    <p>Following the convention season (post-August), we're going\
  \ to stick with our general scheme of including more Tier 1-4 content. Expect most\
  \ months to include a Tier 1-4, with a secondary higher tier scenario filling up\
  \ the secondary slot.</p> \n    <p>We remain committed to higher level content,\
  \ but don't expect to see a new Tier 5-8 every month. We'll be looking to mix up\
  \ some of our release with a regular offering of Tier 3-6 and some Tier 5-8s.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For the most dedicated players, August looks to be an appropriate time\
  \ to start up a new character. With <a href=\"/products/btpy9y25?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Reach-of-Empire\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Adventure Path: The Reach of Empire</em></a> debuting that month,\
  \ alongside our other recently announced Starfinder Society scenarios, the future\
  \ is ripe for new character opportunities.</p> \n    <p>Faction missions remain\
  \ something we'll be interspersing throughout our future scenarios. Expect a slight\
  \ step-back from Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo) missions for a bit. There will be\
  \ more content on that front, but expect a future blog post to further discuss that\
  \ topic.</p> \n    <p>Finally, expect to see the campaign start looking towards\
  \ more high-level opportunities closer to the end of 2019!</p> \n    <p>Alrighty,\
  \ those are some of my words of wisdom for our upcoming scenario plans. As always,\
  \ I love hearing feedback from the community, so please feel free to put any requests\
  \ or thoughts into the comments below. I know there's a wide variety of play styles,\
  \ so be respectful of other players when discussing the topic of level ranges for\
  \ new scenarios. Beyond that, it's time for me to jump back into convention season\
  \ development!</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder Society Developer</i></p>\
