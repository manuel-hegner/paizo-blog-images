  \ I am excited about the recently-released February scenarios for <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a>. This month was a little strange because both adventures\
  \ are Tier 1–5, but that's mostly because I'm saving some of the higher-level adventures\
  \ for later in the season when we resolve some other pieces of the Sky Key story.\
  \ Several months ago, I also took a long hard look at how Gen Con's earlier date\
  \ this year (July 30–Aug 2) would affect the Season 6 schedule. The Pathfinder Society\
  \ team decided that the cleanest way to handle this would be to make the Year of\
  \ the Sky Key shorter by a month and start Season 7 a month early. The result is\
  \ a slightly compressed season in which you'll see a lot of plot coming together\
  \ in the final six months and a slightly smaller number of scenarios per season\
  \ (but not per year). The last standard scenario for Season 6 will be #6–23, plus\
  \ several Special events released at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> and Gen\
  \ Con.</p> \n    <p>Now that we've talked a bit about the big picture, let's look\
  \ at some of these recent releases. <a href=\"/products/btpy9am6\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #6–14: Scions of the Sky Key, Part 2: Kaava Quarry</em></a> is\
  \ the second installment in a three-part series that takes the Pathfinders to northern\
  \ Sargava and (in this adventure) a fun stretch of jungle in the southwest Mwangi\
  \ Expanse. Author Mike Kimmel was one of the three <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG\
  \ Superstar</a> 2014 finalists, and I think it's fair to say he had the most open-ended\
  \ outline of the trio. I received a really fun proposal a few days later, and the\
  \ result is a giant dinosaur on the cover of a Tier 1–5 scenario and one of my favorite\
  \ encounters of the year. The PCs are going to need some help, so today I've included\
  \ an illustration of one of the first acquaintances they meet upon entering the\
  \ Kaava Lands.</p> \n    <p>I am also very excited about <a href=\"/products/btpy9ch0\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6–15: The Overflow Archives</em></a>, written\
  \ by Scott Sharplin. I first learned of Scott when speaking with a few freelancers\
  \ at PaizoCon, and like the professional that he is, he had an Open Call submission\
  \ waiting in my inbox soon after I got back in the office. You may already be familiar\
  \ with his work in <a href=\"/products/btpy98nh\"><em>The Silverhex Chronicles</em></a>\
  \ (namely Mists and Mausoleum), and when the schedule had an opening for a low-level\
  \ adventure tied to the Dark Archive, I asked Scott if he would be interested in\
  \ turning his Open Call piece into a full scenario. The final adventure is unlike\
  \ anything published in the campaign to date, and it's a delightful yet whimsically\
  \ dark story that takes the PCs deep into one of the Grand Lodge's more notorious\
  \ vaults. Just to give you a sense of the strangeness within, I present the Owl\
  \ and the Albatross, two figures featured in the story within a story.</p> \n  \
