  >Winter continues its cruel embrace across the United States this week (well, just\
  \ about everywhere but here in balmy Seattle, that is), and our <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"\
  >Reign of Winter</a> miniature reveals for May's <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> set just keep on coming!</span></p> \n    <p>This week I'd\
  \ like to focus on four figures that are, for lack of a better word, monsters. We've\
  \ shown off a few animals (and there are a few more to come) and a lot of specific\
  \ enemies so far, so now it's time to pull back the curtain on some of the rank-and-file\
  \ creatures you're likely to find in your <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of\
  \ Winter</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459-Maftet_500.jpeg\"\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have a Maftet, a member of a race of winged\
  \ feline humanoids inspired by an Egyptian goddess (and included on page 188 of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"><i>Bestiary 3</i></a>. Maftets dwell in crumbling\
  \ ruins and lost cities, and come up several times in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\"\
  >Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a>. This particular example wields two swords and\
  \ stands about 7 feet tall, making her an imposing encounter indeed. The Maftet\
  \ is a Medium figure slated at the common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \   </div> \n    <p>Folks have been asking for more fey miniatures for a long time,\
  \ and I'm happy to get the opportunity presented by the monster mix of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a> to\
  \ start delivering. Here we have one of my personal favorites from back in the Narnia\
  \ days, a Faun! Our Faun (also in <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"><i>Bestiary 3</i></a>)\
  \ is shown playing a pipe and cavorting around. He's pretty cool. This Medium figure\
  \ is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK7159-MirrorMan_500.jpeg\"> <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK7159-MirrorMan_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>In a recent comment thread I mentioned\
  \ that the set would include a Mirror Man, a creepy construct introduced in the\
  \ pages of <a href=\"/products/btpy8wfl\">Pathfinder Adventure Path #68</a>, the\
  \ second <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of Winter</a>\
  \ adventure. Even though your own face may reflect back on you when you encounter\
  \ a Mirror Man, rest assured that there is a human spirit giving the thing animate\
  \ force. Yes, it may be the trapped spirit of a condemned criminal, but don't let\
  \ that get in the way of your primping. The Mirror Man is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459-Catoblepas_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459-Catoblepas_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>One of my favorite aspects of building <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> set lists is including\
  \ creatures that have never before been produced in prepainted plastic. To my knowledge,\
  \ this big guy fits the bill. Here we have the lowly and unloved Catoblepas, a creature\
  \ first described by the historian Pliny the Elder around AD 77, so I think he qualifies\
  \ as a \"classic\" monster. Unlike the real version, this miniature's gaze will\
  \ not turn you to stone (I can't promise the same for your player characters). The\
  \ Catoblepas is a cool, hefty figure that makes use of his Large size. He is slated\
  \ at the rare rarity, and his stats can be found on page 52 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"\
  ><i>Bestiary 2</i></a>.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week! I'm off to the\
  \ New York Toy Fair tomorrow morning, where I will be meeting with my counterpart\
  \ at WizKids to hatch diabolical plans for the coming years (among other things).\
  \ We'll be back next week with more <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a>\
  \ miniature reveals. In the meantime, try to keep warm!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
