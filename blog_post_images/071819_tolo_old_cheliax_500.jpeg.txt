| summary  = Several terraced buildings in the late afternoon sun, the light filtering down from the upper left. The buildings are surrounded by leafy trees and plants grow on the sides of the buildings and terraces. On the right, the terrace in front of a building is neatly manicured and has a small group of people in robes gathered. One holds a staff with a glowing red end up to the sky as the others look on. A cloaked, hooded person watches from the stairs leading up to the terrace.
