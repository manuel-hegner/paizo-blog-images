  \  <h1><br>Bastards of Erebus—Playtest Two</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday,\
  \ February 25, 2009</p> \n   <p>David is pretty busy with his appendix posts, so\
  \ I'm doing the second playtest blog. It began with Sean having us reset and trying\
  \ our fateful battle over. Pre-battle, we toyed around with some new ideas, but\
  \ ultimately decided that our last tactic was working pretty well (that is, until\
  \ we died), and so decided to go with that.</p> \n   <p>The encounter actually started\
  \ off a lot better than last time. We took out our first opponent rather speedily...\
  \ and right about then things started to go against us. First my eagle got taken\
  \ out. Then our dice betrayed us. Now, I know everyone has had bad dice nights,\
  \ but this was incredulously, astronomically, and hilariously terrible. Even Sean\
  \ shook his head in dismay, chalking it up as a first in his book.</p> \n   <p>That's\
  \ when we began dropping like flies. The dwarf fighter and my druid were dealing\
  \ the most damage, but of course this meant that we were the first to drop (meanwhile\
  \ my eagle stabilized at –9). This left the gnome sorcerer and David's rogue. The\
  \ gnome, after having a series of unfortunate rolls (like all of us), finally managed\
  \ to hit one of the baddies while also providing a flanking bonus for the rogue...\
  \ and then dropped. That left David and the final baddie, mano a mano. It went something\
  \ like this (and by something, I mean exactly):</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Sean</b>:\
  \ (Rolls a d20) 1.<br> <b>David</b>: (Rolls a d20) 1.<br> <b>Sean</b>: (Rolls a\
  \ d20) 1.<br> <b>David</b>: (Rolls a d20) 1.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Two\
  \ rounds in a row! Meanwhile, the gnome, the dwarf, and my druid are slowly bleeding\
  \ to death. The gnome stabilized at I think –8, the dwarf at –9, and I just kept\
  \ dying. But then, with a mighty strike with his rapier for 1 point of damage, David\
  \ dropped the last foe and Sean declared (because he's a nice guy), that David managed\
  \ to save me—right at –9.</p> \n   <p>Afterward, we leveled up (woohoo!) and moved\
  \ on to the next phase of the adventure, which involves some careful planning on\
  \ our part...</p> \n   <p>Hank Woon <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n  </blockquote> <!--\
