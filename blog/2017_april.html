               <p>As usual, proceed with caution if you are playing in this campaign, as spoilers abound!</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>Author John Compton handed us an experience in this marathon that had a horrifically epic feel from the opening hours, and didn't let up. We dealt with threats that dwarfed anything we've seen in this Adventure Path, perhaps in a dozen campaigns we've played. As this year marked the 30th anniversary of Order of the Amber Die, we decided to try for a new record regarding the total time spent together during a marathon. Ninty-six hours was our previous tally, but we're proud to say that part five of Strange Aeons allowed for a new achievement:</p> 
                <ul>
                 <li><b>Adventure</b>: Pathfinder Adventure Path #113: What Grows Within</li> 
                 <li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 108 hours</li> 
                 <li><b>Session Hours</b>: 64</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>For immersion, the audio engineers at <a href="http://axionstudio.com/#about" target="_blank">Axion Studios</a> provided custom sounds of the eerie wind that blew through Neruzavin. We also used modeling clay and clumps of foliage to make unique versions of the fungal monsters we encountered. Lastly, we employed the author's suggestion for enhancing horror in roleplaying games (see John's foreword in "What Grows Within"), by silencing our phones and severely curtailing their usage.</p> 
                <h2>Highlights From What Grows Within</h2> 
                <ul>
                 <li>Finding the forgotten city of Neruzavin was our first challenge, made more difficult after our gnoll guides ditched us and the camels were killed by drakes. Upon surviving our first day in that terrible metropolis, the camels might have been better off.</li> 
                 <li>To earn the respect of an ash giant tribe in control of the Parchlands, we had to draw on our skill set from Giantslayer and best a colossal scorpion. Their skeptical leader shouted three words that were guaranteed to fire up our room: "Prove your might!" </li> 
                 <li>We tried everything to get answers to the mysteries hidden within Neruzavin, including a legend lore spell, a real-time harrowing by Erasmus, and a conference with an otyugh tome eater who chomped down our scrolls faster than a bag of Doritos.</li> 
                 <li>During our daily seance, an unknown spirit forced its way into Erasmus and began battling Nissa for control of his body. We don't know much about it, or even how to rid Erasmus of it; unfortunately, the spirit is beginning to manifest its unpleasant personality, and it suffers no rivals.</li> 
                 <li>Even our new companion Amrivast, a lammasu paladin, wasn't safe from the evil present in Neruzavin. We could do nothing as he struggled against its dark influences and eventually abandoned us. The lammasu returned later as a fungal abomination, calling himself "Amrivast the Seeded, herald of Xhamen-Dor!" We didn't want to put him down, but we had to.</li> 
                 <li>We found the <i>Necronomicon</i>, and even being Elder Mythos rookies we'd heard the name before. It didn't help that Quinn was the one who read it—or that Dan laughed sadistically while our GM told him its secrets.</li> 
                 <li>After having our flesh and egos scoured by what our GM told us was a "flying polyp," our poor reflex saves began dreading what was around every street corner, if corner is even the word. Please, no more polyps.</li>
                </ul> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20170430-UnderCity.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20170430-UnderCity_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20170430-Harrow.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20170430-Harrow_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20170430-Yithians.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20170430-Yithians_360.jpeg"></a> 
                </div> 
                <h2>The Experiment</h2> 
                <p>Quinn broke. Out-of-game too. Our lawful good companion murdered a man right in front of our eyes. The diseased member of a prior expedition to Neruzavin was clearly suffering from seedborne consumption, but we hadn't tried everything to save him before Quinn acted. It didn't go down easy either—the man screamed while Quinn drove his dagger home again and again.</p> 
                <h2>Character Deaths</h2> 
                <p>This marathon was as deadly as you'd expect from a semi-final matchup. On our side were stats such as Feiya's nine instant kills via <i>flesh to stone</i>, and Erasmus's 142 points of damage in a single round. On the opposing side were John Compton's twelve character deaths scored, with five of them coming from the graveknight inquisitor of Rovagug he designed. It's important to note that we had easy access to <i>breath of life</i> through Feiya's hex channeling, and Winter carried two in her daily complement.</p> 
                <h2>Best Quote From Marathon 5</h2> 
                <p><i>Alahazra</i> (during a tense parley with an irritated moon giant): "I need money. I am negotiating with a massive giant, OR WE ARE GOING TO DIE. What do we have?"</p> 
                <h2>Current Situation</h2> 
                <p>We had to make one of the toughest decisions of our Pathfinder careers, and it will surely trouble us throughout the last chapter of our story. Desperately low on resources, the debate came down to saving the multiverse from Hastur, or merely saving Golarion in the present. The vote was 3-2 in favor of leaving Golarion behind, forcing our world to face the reviving threat of a Great Old One and the polyps we unleashed. Moreover, we had taken the <i>Necronomicon</i> away from Quinn and given it to exscinder archons, which meant we would have to attempt the Path to the Black Stars occult ritual without a key focus—the ritual's costly toll now meant we had only one chance at completing it.</p> 
                <p>The result: We're headed to Carcosa and the finals of this AP!</p>

This probably won't happen until after <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> where I'll run into a few of the Order of the Amber Die folks as they come to Seattle to play some games and talk about their marathon experiences. If you're at the show, make sure to say "Hi!" You can't miss their custom shirts.</p>

In this case, since these creatures aren't protected by copyright law and aren't the intellectual property of content creators, the field is wide open—we can create specific creatures based on these things in the same way we can stat up things like donkeys and rats. But there's another category of inspiration that we often draw upon that's a bit trickier—literary sources.</p> 
               <p>In this case, we've either opted for simply taking inspiration for a monster and making up something entirely new, but that's not exactly what I want to highlight here. When we look at older stories that are now in the public domain, there are a huge number of interesting creatures we can "import" into Pathfinder. We've been doing this in every Bestiary, from the first one (which has H. G. Wells's morlocks and Lovecraft's shoggoths for example) on. That doesn't change in <em>Bestiary 6</em>.</p> 
               <p>Of course, since I was the one picking the monsters, it should come as no surprise that my favorite author, Lovecraft, has some strong representation here. In some cases, the monsters picked up from his stories are specific creatures he took time to describe and explore (such as the yaddithian and the Great Old Ones). In other cases, they're creatures he wrote entire stories about but never really named, so I came up with specific names for them (the Leng hound, from his short story "The Hound", and the unrisen, the lively awful remnants from "The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"). And in one case, they were just name drops with only a few words of tantalizing description—the urhag is a throwaway reference in "The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath" where they're described as things flying in the sky along with bats in a creepy corner of the Dreamlands. In this case, other than "they fly" we were able to create an entirely new monster to provide context for the creature.</p> 
               <p>But Lovecraft wasn't my only source of literary inspiration. Like the urhag, the whisperer is never mentioned by name in the story that inspired it, but those who have read Algernon Blackwood's "The Willows" (one of my all-time favorite stories) will recognize its themes and the weird wounds its touch causes in flesh, I hope. The other, the horla, is the opposite—a creature that not only heavily features in Guy de Maupassant's story, but gives that story its name: "The Horla." The fact that the horla is invisible in the story gave us some leeway in creating its appearance for those who insist on using methods like see <i>invisibility</i> to peer into the unknown, but its creepy abilities to feed on slumbering victims and secretly drive them to murder and insanity are right out of the pages of the tale. I've actually been trying to get the horla into print as far back as <em>Bestiary 2</em>, so I'm glad the critter finally gets to see the light of day!</p>

Anyway, the <a href="/products/btpy9qy9?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Magus-Class-Deck"><em>Magus Class Deck</em></a>, the <a href="/products/btpy9s2e?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Pathfinder-Tales-Character-Deck"><em>Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9s2o?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-1"><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em></a>, are all in Vic and Sonja's hands.

              <h1 itemprop="headline">The New Wave of Character Decks</h1> 
              <p class="date">Tuesday, April 25, 2017</p> 
              <p itemprop="description">Hey Paizonians, Lone Shark has just turned over the files for the sixth wave of class decks—which are sometimes called character decks now, because we're having fun experimenting with new class-agnostic formats, but we can't stop calling them class decks, and this is a really long sentence now. Anyway, the <a href="/products/btpy9qy9?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Magus-Class-Deck"><em>Magus Class Deck</em></a>, the <a href="/products/btpy9s2e?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Pathfinder-Tales-Character-Deck"><em>Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9s2o?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-1"><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em></a> are all in Vic and Sonja's hands. Suffice it to say, we went a bit nuts on the new cards in these sets. Maybe a lot nuts.</p> 
              <p>We've also started work on the wave after that. <a href="/products/btpy9sjy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-2"><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 2</em></a> concludes our trip to Evil Land. This November deck features the pitborn assassin <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liet?Meet-the-VillainsEmil-Kovkorin">Emil</a>, the dhampir necromancer <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lis8?Meet-the-VillainsNyctessa">Nyctessa</a>, and the human torturer <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lijt?Meet-the-VillainsZelhara">Zelhara</a>. There's a whole lot of bad news in store for the allies in this set. If you want more backstabbing, backbiting, and backbreaking than you can reasonably imagine, this is the deck for you.</p>

               <p>Where my wolf at?</p>
              </div> 
              <p>In December, we're going to get a deck together for someone we've wanted to feature for a long time. <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgdk?Meet-the-Iconics-Adowyn">Adowyn</a>, the hunter we introduced in <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous">Wrath of the Righteous</a>, is going to get her own spotlight in the <a href="/products/btpy9sxh?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hunter-Class-Deck"><em>Hunter Class Deck</em></a>, and of course her wolf Leryn is coming along for the chase. People have been asking us to make Adowyn available in the <a href="/pfsacg">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a> for a year or more, but we never thought we had the right deck. Now we will.</p> 
              <p>And then, this mic drop.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PFACG-Iconics.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PFACG-Iconics_500.jpeg"></a> 
               <p>The brainy bunch.</p>
              </div> 
              <p>The new year will kick off with <em>Occult Adventures Character Deck 1</em>. Between it and its sequel, we'll be releasing all six mental masters. You'll find new versions of three Mummy's Mask stalwarts—the occultist <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhmh?Meet-the-Iconics-Mavaro">Mavaro</a>, the spiritualist <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhna?Meet-the-Iconics-Estra">Estra</a>, and the adorable kineticist <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhqz?Meet-the-Iconics-Yoon">Yoon</a>—alongside three all-new characters: the psychic <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhob?Meet-the-Iconics-Rivani">Rivani</a>, the mesmerist <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhpw?Meet-the-Iconics-Meligaster">Meligaster</a>, and the medium <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhoy?Meet-the-Iconics-Erasmus">Erasmus</a>. Which three will be in which set? We don't know yet! We're actually engaged in a Lockhorns-level imbroglio over who gets to design what with whom here. We don't know what will happen!</p> 
              <p>If only we had a way to predict the future. Ah well.</p> 
              <p>When we get done with these, we'll have made <i>one hundred thirty-six characters</i> for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, with no end in sight. It's been quite the creative process. And we'll keep it up as long as you let us.</p> 
              <p>So those are some upcoming decks of characters for you to play with. We'll preview all of these when we get closer to the release dates. Thanks for playing!</p>

               <p>We kick off the race into convention season with an infamous race in Garund: the famous Sargava Chalice, a survival footrace through the unforgiving wilderness just south of the Mwangi Expanse. In recent years, the race has become increasingly deadly, and the Pathfinder Society has proposed allowing teams to compete as a way to revitalize the contest. The PCs are representing the Pathfinder Society in the race, and if they can brave the traceless frontier while fending off both beasts and rival competitors, they might walk away with the chalice itself—a relic with which the Society can unlock a cyclops ruin from antiquity. Lace up your racing shoes in <a href="/products/btpy9ret?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-818-Champions-Chalice-Part-1-Blazing-Dangerous-Trails"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-18: Champion's Chalice, Part 1: Blazing Dangerous Trails</em></a> by Benjamin Bruck, bravely treaded new ground by adapting a simplified version of <a href="/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em>'s</a> pursuit rules to track the PCs' progress. Just be warned that one rule hasn't changed: contestants begin the race with nothing but themselves and the cloths on their backs. Time is of the essence in this Tier 1-5 adventure!</p>

               <p>Thus far the Pathfinder Society has traveled the elemental planes, compiling what it needs to shatter the <em>Untouchable Opal</em>. We're yet to visit the Plane of Water, and that ends this month as the Society is in pursuit of a crucial tool to realize its goal. Many years ago, the ingenious Pathfinder Zahra was <a href="/products/btpy8i11?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-218-The-Forbidden-Furnace-of-Forgotten-Koor">investigating the unforgiving ruins of Koor</a>, and she has since shifted her sights to the magnificent metropolis of Vialesk, a hub for visitors to the Plane of Water. Tragic circumstances ruined the first expedition and tarnished her reputation, but she suspects foul play and has recruited the PCs to find out what really happened. <a href="/products/btpy9reu?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-819-Treacherous-Waves"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-19: Treacherous Waters</em></a> is an exciting urban adventure set in the underwater city of Vialesk, full of strange environments and even stranger characters. Its author, Eleanor Ferron, not only contributed to <a href="/products/btpy9mb9?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-Honors-Echo"><em>Pathfinder Quests: Honor's Echo</em></a>, but she also made the Plane of Water come alive in <a href="/products/btpy9ng0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Planes-of-Power"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Planes of Power</em></a>, making this Tier 3-7 adventure a real testament to her abilities and knowledge of the setting.</p> 
               <p>As a note for <em>Treacherous Waters</em>, keep in mind that its events tie closely to <a href="/products/btpy9rev?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-820-Torrents-Last-Will">Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-20: Torrent's Last Will</a>, a Tier 7-11 adventure coming out next month. It's not necessary to play these with the same character, though I do recommend playing them in order.</p>

We've been creating monsters to fill our stories and myths since we first started telling stories and weaving myths, and over the thousands and thousands of years humanity's been around, well, that's a lot of time to create a lot of monsters!</p> 
               <p>While there's always been a core collection of monsters drawn from mythology in fantasy RPGs, the ones that have appeared in print only scratch the surface. Whenever we start gearing up for a new Bestiary, one of the first places we go to is real-world myth and legend. <em>Bestiary 6</em> is no exception. From the very first monster in the book, the blood-drinking alp, we drew from mythology to populate the book with a diverse array of critters. As the book came together, I was amused to see a few unintentional themes develop among these mythological monsters—I think my favorite is the "creepy monster with one eye." The ghole, the mapinguari, and the psoglav all come from myth or cryptozoology, and it was a fun challenge for me to make sure that, while all three are similar in theme (vaguely human-shaped one-eyed menaces), they all fit different roles in the game.</p> 
               <p>Another theme that I was delighted to finally explore in a Bestiary was no accident at all. The Wild Hunt was one of the initial monsters I had in mind for the book, and for some time was my go-to in house when folks would ask me "Are there any monsters in this book that I've heard of that aren't in print yet?" or its variant, "Are there any monsters in the book that I'll be surprised HAVEN'T been put in one of our products already?" The Wild Hunt, which expanded from a single entry into several, is a prime example—a well-known entire category of mythological monster that we've done nothing with, until now. I love what Linda Zayas-Palmer did with these things, and how the art ended up making them all look of a kind even when they include such diverse shapes as horse, hound, or humanoid.</p> 
               <p>Of course, not all of the monsters inspired by myth had one eye or were part of the Wild Hunt. Check out the following three examples as proof! And I'm eager to see if folks can pick out all of the other mythological monsters from the book in the comments below!</p>

But it would be a poor game that takes place among the stars if it didn't have starships! Luckily, Starfinder gives you all you need to play the crew of an intrepid vessel exploring the galaxy—and getting into trouble along the way.</p> 
               <p>The universe is not always a friendly place and there are forces out there, from freebooting space pirates to a whole fleet of undead soldiers, who either want to incapacitate your starship and take your stuff or just blow you out of the void. And of course, you're not going to roll over and let that happen! That's where Starfinder's robust starship combat system comes into play.</p> 
               <p>While it has some similarities to character-versus-monster combat, starship combat boasts a number of unique and interesting features. It would be impossible to explore every detail in one blog (you'll just have to buy the book to find out more!), but we'd like to give you a taste of what you can expect come August.</p> 
               <p>When your characters first board their starship, each player chooses one of five roles for his or her character: captain, engineer, gunner, pilot, or science officer. Only one character each can be the captain and the pilot, but depending on the configuration of your vessel, you may want multiple engineers or gunners. Each role gives the character assuming it a number of actions she can perform during the battle. The captain can give encouraging speeches or make demands of the rest of the crew, granting valuable bonuses. A science officer can scan enemy ships and target specific systems on those vessels. An engineer can boost power to the engines or repair a malfunctioning weapon. A gunner fires the ship's weapons at the enemy, taking precise shots or unleashing a volley of lasers.</p> 
               <p>All that is exciting and vital to the success of the fight, but as Iseph would be quick to remind you, you'd still be a sitting duck without the impressive things the pilot can do!</p> 
               <p>The pilot has the important job of moving the PCs' starship across the hex-grid map that starship combat uses, ensuring that gunners can shoot the ship's biggest weapons at the most dangerous enemies while hopefully making sure that those foes don't have the opportunity to shoot back. Getting the positioning and facing of the ship right is crucial, as is knowing what the ship is capable of doing and then pushing it beyond its limits.</p> 
               <p>To that end, pilots have access to a whole suite of stunts—daring maneuvers that only the skilled can hope to pull off. Of course, if the situation doesn't call for any of these fancy tactics, the pilot can always fly normally or step on the gas for an extra burst of speed. The basic pilot stunts are:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b>Back Off</b>: The pilot throws the ship into reverse, moving backward a few hexes.</p> 
                <p><b>Barrel Roll</b>: By spinning the ship on its axis, the pilot allows the ships's port guns and shields to function on the starboard side and vice versa for 1 round. Hope your artificial gravity is turned on!</p> 
                <p><b>Evade</b>: This stunt encompasses the standard dodging maneuvers, making the ship harder to hit for 1 round. But it doesn't shake those pesky target lock-ons!</p> 
                <p><b>Flip and Burn</b>: The pilot moves the vessel forward a bit and turns it 180 degrees, surprising enemies who might have been in its wake.</p> 
                <p><b>Flyby</b>: A dangerous stunt, this takes your ship very close to an enemy vessel (through its hex), which lets a gunner fire any of his ship's weapons at any shield arc of the foe, regardless of where the two ships end their movement. Executing this stunt poorly allows the enemy vessel to get a free shot on you!</p> 
                <p><b>Slide</b>: The pilot moves the ship at an angle without changing the way it is facing, like a racecar drifting. This stunt is very useful for ships that aren't very maneuverable.</p> 
                <p><b>Turn in Place</b>: Firing up maneuvering thrusters, the pilot alters the direction the ship is facing without moving it from its hex, possibly allowing a specific weapon to make an all-important shot.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Especially talented pilots can also attempt an "audacious gambit," flying the ship in ways never intended by those who built it. But you'd have to be crazy to try something like that!</p> 
               <p>Since a pilot is nothing without a ship to helm, the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> also presents both rules for customizing your own starship and a handful of prebuilt starships ready for PCs to use or fight. Shown here are just two examples.</p> 
               <p>The Drone Mk III is a smaller ship fabricated by shirren manufacturer Starhive. As befits their name, Drones are extremely common and used as freighters, personnel transports, light colonial defense vessels, and more. Despite the ships' mass production, Starhive takes a natural shirren pride in making sure each ship's iridescent paint job is unique.</p> 
               <p>Built by the vesk munitions company Vindicas, the Tyrant is a dreadnought feared across multiple star systems. Huge weapon batteries tear through even the most formidable capital ships, while its hangars unleash squadrons of fighters to mop up foes too insignificant to be worth the Tyrant's direct attention.</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">The Riddle of the Mythopoeic Sphinx</h1> 
              <p class="date">Tuesday, April 4, 2017</p> 
              <p itemprop="description"><i><b>WARNING: This blog is a giant spoiler.</b> If you want to solve the Riddle of the Mythopoeic Sphinx, turn away now. Come back when you've solved it. Oh wait—you didn't read that last sentence because you turned away. Good job.</i></p> 
              <p>Because the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask">Mummy's Mask</a> set is loaded with sphinxes, I could not resist including a riddle. Riddles, after all, are what sphinxes do. Also, they bite your head off and use your ribcage for toothpicks. But mostly riddles.</p> 
              <p>The idea for the riddle involved isolating a loot card called the Mythopoeic Sphinx. As those who opened Adventure Deck 4 quickly realized, there was no way to get the Mythopoeic Sphinx into your deck. But, as it turned out, there was. Instead of dropping it on the Paizo forums where everyone would spot it immediately, I dropped a secret hint that there was a puzzle in Mummy's Mask into <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/60309/bggcon-2016-wrap-part-2" target="_blank">Diceychic's wrap-up of games at BoardGameGeek.CON 2016</a>: "Fun Fact: Mike Selinker says, 'There is a puzzle in the game that the Lone Shark Games design team has told nobody about until today.'"</p> 
              <p>Immediately, <a href="/threads/rzs2u2rx?The-Secret-of-the-Mummys-Mask">the speculation began</a>. Only when a valiant team of Paizo forumites cracked the code was the secret revealed.</p> 
              <p>But what was it? Venture forth only if you want to learn the secret of the sphinx.</p> 
              <div style="margin: 10px 0;"> 
               <h3 style="display: inline; padding-right: 5px;">Spoilers</h3> 
               <input type="button" value="Show" class="spoilerButton" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)"> 
               <div class="spoiler-text"> 
                <p>Step one was realizing there was a connection to the Mythopoeic Sphinx. That required downloading <a href="/products/btpy9r83"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Society Card Guild Adventure 3-4: Tomb of the Godless Host</em></a> and taking a look at scenario 3-4C, The Choked Tunnel. The reward there was awfully cryptic.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170418-Reward.jpg">
                </div> 
                <p>The stunning phrase is "if that character recites the Mythopoeic Curse when doing so." There was no text anywhere saying what the Mythopoeic Curse <i>was</i>. However, there was another clue on that very page. Right at the top, in fact.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170418-ChokedTunnel.jpg">
                </div> 
                <p>That Mythopoeic Sphinx image was tattooed by the talented Sonja Morris with five numbers: <b>4 3 2 8 3</b>. To most puzzlers, that's a clear indication of an enumeration of the letters in a phrase. In this case, that the Curse would be five words of lengths 4, 3, 2, 8, and 3.</p> 
                <p>But where was the Curse? Turns out that you had to look at my flavor text on the cards—specifically, on the nine Curses listed on the scourge table, in the order that they're listed:</p> 
                <ul>
                 <li><b>Curse of Poisoning:</b> <i>"Lo! The fire burns hot in your veins!"</i></li> 
                 <li><b>Curse of Vulnerability:</b> <i>"O, wretches! You stand helpless before me!"</i></li> 
                 <li><b>Curse of Daybane:</b> <i>"Know this! The Orb of Ra destroys!"</i></li> 
                 <li><b>Curse of the Ravenous:</b> <i>"A plague of famine upon the nation!"</i></li> 
                 <li><b>Curse of Withering:</b> <i>"To all your hopes, a decrepit demise!"</i></li> 
                 <li><b>Curse of Fevered Dreams:</b> <i>"Sir, your sanity is imperiled!"</i></li> 
                 <li><b>Curse of the Sphinx:</b> <i>"I watch over all! There is no escaping my gaze!"</i></li> 
                 <li><b>Curse of Blindness:</b> <i>"On the brightest noon, darkness shall reign!"</i></li> 
                 <li><b>Curse of the Mummy:</b> <i>"Send your best raiders! All will be lost!"</i></li>
                </ul> 
                <p>The first words of each of those oddly worded curses are <i>LO, O, KNOW, A, TO, SIR, I, ON, SEND</i>. Respaced to the enumeration on the sphinx's tattoo, they spell the invocation <b>LOOK NOW AT OSIRION'S END.</b> The Mythopoeic Curse is revealed.</p> 
               </div>
              </div> 
              <p>A lot of people worked to solve that riddle, and at the end a combination of forum members Hawkmoon269, Iammars, Frencois, and ryric <a href="/threads/rzs2u58j?Mummys-Mask-Puzzle-Discussion#30">knocked this last step down</a>. Congratulations to all—consider yourself cursed!</p> 
              <p>Meanwhile, we want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to use the loot card Mythopoeic Sphinx in your regular Mummy's Mask games, not just in Season of Plundered Tombs. So today we're issuing <a href="/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1he#v5748eaic9vlc">only our second "optional errata" ever</a>, for the adventure card Secrets of the Sphinx in Adventure Deck 4: You may change the reward to "Each character gains a power feat. 1 character may recite the Mythopoeic Curse to draw the loot Mythopoeic Sphinx from the box." (Or you can limit its appearance to the Adventure Card Guild scenario, and defeat its tricksy ways there.)</p> 
              <p>We hope you enjoyed divining the secret of the sphinx. And I promise never to include a puzzle in any of my games again.*</p>

               <p>Last November, several groups hosted <a href="https://www.extra-life.org" target="_blank">Extra Life</a> events and donated funds to their local chapters. I attended the Extra Life II event in Spokane, Washington. There were also Extra Life events in Boise, Idaho and Cary, North Carolina. John Compton joined fellow Paizonians Jason Buhlman and Amanda Hamon-Kunz, as well as several members of the Dead Gentlemen/Zombie Orpheus Entertainment cadre in a marathon gaming event streamed on twitch. All told, we raised over $5,000 for the Extra Life Cause. Get ready for November 2017, because we will be back, this time coordinating our efforts on a larger scale as well as streaming another celebrity-studded game.</p> 
               <p>Players in the metro Boston area regularly support charitable causes. Venture Captains Ray Diaz and David Montgomery coordinate ongoing charity events through their weekly games. In March, they supported National Reading Month. Prior events benefited Somerville Homeless Coalition and the Woman's Bar Foundation. They also support charity conventions such as CaptainCon.</p> 
               <p>Supporting charity isn't limited to the US groups. In Great Britain, Wyrd Sisters Carol Tierney and Chris Brockley-Blatt run several conventions aimed at raising money for a variety of organizations. They support <a href="http://www.tofs.org.uk/home.aspx" target="_blank">TOFS</a>, <a href="https://sarcoma.org.uk" target="_blank">Sarcoma UK</a>, <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk" target="_blank">MS Society UK</a> and other charities on an ongoing basis. They are responsible for 3XP Fall and 3XP Spring, as well as lending their talents to a slew of other events: ConTRAPtion, OddCon UK, Contingency, and PaizoCon UK. Other charitable events in Europe include GaelCon in Ireland, and CoNfUsIoN in Gouda.</p> 
               <p>The list below recognizes the charity events supported so far in 2017. These are not the only charity events occurring in 2017, and do not include events which occurred in 2016. A huge thank you to players, GMs, and volunteers who supported charity events in the past and those which plan to do so in the future!</p>

               <p>To support these efforts, the Pathfinder Society team initiated the Charity Boon program in 2016. The program consists of two unique boons that may be used to raise funds for a charity, usually through auctions or raffles. In 2016, the boons were "Memory of Eshiro" and "Thaneguard Mantle" andwe distributed 32 charity boons worldwide. For 2017, the boons are "Bristlecoat" and "Mana Treads" and are currently projecting 40ish being distributed throughout the year.</p> 
               <p>An event organizer may request a charity boon for their event as part of their request for convention support. A charity qualifies as long as it is non-religious and/or non-political and benefits a public group of people. With the advent of the Regional Support Program (RSP), we are accepting requests for charity boons as part of a RSP event. If you have an upcoming event you feel would benefit from charity support, contact your local Venture-Officer for more information. You can find a list of Venture-Officers <a href="/organizedplay/coordinators">here.</a></p> 
               <p>Next week, we get a double blog Monday. In one, John will introduce our April scenarios. In another, I'll reveal the results of the "OPC Needs a New Character" competition.

               <p itemprop="description"><a href="/products/btpy9r1y?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6"><em>Bestiary 6</em></a> is slithering out into the world, but even though the book is out there, I've still got a few more things to chat about the contents. Going forward, we'll continue to sow off some art from the book but these posts will be more "behind the scenes" than "monster previews."</p> 
               <p>Which brings us to today's theme—powerful monsters. For some time now I've wanted us to produce a Bestiary whose challenges skew higher than traditional. While it's true that more games are run at lower level, and thus there's a need for a lot of low and mid tier monsters, we've published a lot of those already in prior Bestiaries. One of the problems facing GMs and adventure writers of high-level content is a lack of monsters to fill the role of threat. As a result, high-level adventures tend to have lots of creatures with class levels, templates, advanced Hit Dice, or sometimes two or even three of these categories in play.</p> 
               <p>With <em>Bestiary 6</em>, I wanted to give us all more toys to play with for adventures that take place above 10th level, be they powerful creatures to fight again and again or unique foes to serve as a long quest's final boss or as the theme for an entire campaign. I also wanted to populate some niches of monsters that have long been denied higher CR representation—usually, the high CR monsters are outsiders or dragons or giants. In preparing for <em>Bestiary 6</em>, I realized that we'd done a shockingly few number of monstrous humanoids and plants above CR 10, for example, so those two categories were ones I immediately looked to address. I spoke about oozes a few weeks back with the blights, of course, but when you get your copy of <em>Bestiary 6</em>, I think you'll be delighted by the number of new options of monsters to throw at your players, particularly powerful monsters that aren't overly huge and can fit into areas as small as the player characters themselves!</p> 
               <p>Three of my favorite high CR additions to the game include the kaiju (including the most powerful one of them all—Lord Varklops), the apocalypse horse (which came about as a natural result of the decision to include the Horsemen of the Apocalypse and then realizing these high CR demigods needed something more significant than an advanced nightmare to ride around on), and the ouroboros (a monster I've wanted to get into an RPG for well over a decade). Ranging from CR 21 (the ouroboros) to CR 25 (the apocalypse horses) to CR 30 (Lord Varklops), these three make a perfect cross-section of the variety of powerful foes in <a href="/products/btpy9r1y?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6"><em>Bestiary 6</em></a>!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">I spent the past weekend on a trip to Grand Canyon National Park. Driving there, my family and I passed a variety of different climate zones. We went from the desert of Las Vegas to the scrub of Nevada/Arizona border to the pine forests surrounding Flagstaff to the windswept gorge of Grand Canyon. As a side note, the area around Flagstaff reminds me of growing up in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. In each place, our talk turned to what fantasy creatures would occupy such areas. The walk along the canyon rim started with the observation that we forgot Gobby, our Pathfinder Goblin, and couldn't take photos. That spawned discussion of goblins living in the canyon rim and launching sneak attacks against unsuspecting hikers, followed by the observation that trolls would probably like the rim and orcs the deeper crevasses.</p>

               <p>While I knew I was a geek and had lots of non-mainstream interests, I had not realized how much roleplaying games had influenced how I see the world. It isn't limited to my day-to-day life in the Paizo office, weekly games with friends, or weekend convention attendance, but permeates every part of our lives. Grocery stores lead to discussions on what may a certain race eat and how would they structure mealtimes. Craft stores yield all sorts of ideas, from houses for fairies to clothing styles among the different countries of Golarion.</p> 
               <p>Speaking of Golarion, I've been thinking about the characters submitted for the "OPC Needs a New Character" contest. The PFS team of John, Linda, and Mark, took their meeting last week to review the submissions and help me whittle down the entries to the top few. We had to throw a few out because they didn't follow the competition guidelines or used non-PFS legal archetypes or gear. Then we went through and looked at the builds, evaluating how the build and equipment supported the backstory. Alas, we could only choose three to offer for judging, but before I reveal those, I want to say thank you to all the participants. I appreciate you taking the time to put your thoughts to paper and suggest a character for me to play. I also want to recognize those characters that made the semi-finals, for all of them were interesting concepts that I would have enjoyed playing.</p> 
               <p>Three cheers to the entrants:</p>

               </ul> 
               <p>Having chosen our top three, based on backstory, creation, and playability, we turn the choice over to our readers. Please vote for one of the following finalists. The character with the most votes will be my next character and receive recognition every time I play them. In addition, the author will win $20 credit to spend on paizo.com. We've put the submissions behind spoiler tags and only included the level 1 version to keep the blog from running to pages and pages.</p>

                 <p>Life in Whistledown was never bad, but it never felt quite right. Nothing ever was the right size, the charms near home were always just a little off-pitch of each other, and I never saw something for me to do. Pa always said it would all come in time. "You'll find your place here" he said. I practiced my shots, helped around on the different farms for coin, and tried to learn what I could.</p> 
                 <p>Pa never told me what he had in that old box in his room. Just said it was his grandpappy's. When pa got sick, he told me to take the box and I'd have to take care of what's inside. That I'd know what I needed to do. He wasn't wrong. After the sickness took him, I opened the box and found a few things—a ratty pouch, a carved symbol of Erastil, a funny knife... that sort of stuff. That's when I found out, though! Great-grandpappy was a hunter! I'd always heard stories, but when I picked up that funny knife, I knew! I could feel it! Granny was a priestess, too! All these things were my family's and I felt more sure of what to do than ever: I had to help people! Show people what good folk do and get 'em safe! Start a family! Get my own farm!</p> 
                 <p>Pa's gone now, but my kin are with me. We can be good people and they can teach me how. I hear them Pathfinders go all over the place and help people. Maybe I can work with them, save up, and retire to a farmstead with a pretty girl and raise some kids right.</p>

                 <p>Gwinn is a striking young Chelish woman with black hair (a lock of which is dyed white according to the fashion in Ostenso) and hazel eyes. A minor scion of house Jeggare, throughout her childhood Gwinn eagerly anticipated the small gifts that her ‘uncle' Varian (the family relation is much more convoluted than that, but this is how Gwinn thinks of Venture-Captain Jeggare) would intermittently send her. Much to her parents' chagrin she eagerly followed her uncle's exploits in the Pathfinder Chronicles. As she grew older Gwinn learned that it was much easier to appear to give in to her parents' desire that she become a proper Chelish lady while secretly mastering those skills she believed would gain her admittance to the Pathfinder Society. Marrying some noble boor for the advantage of her family's fortunes was far from the life of excitement and adventure she saw for herself. So when around her sixteenth nameday her parents started making noises about finding her a suitable husband she enacted her escape plan. She secured what valuables she had been able to secret and booked passage to Absalom. There she leveraged her family connection to the Society and her natural talents to obtain an apprenticeship at the Grand Lodge.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Last Friday, <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/04/07/exclusive-first-look-at-starfinder-iconic-characters.aspx" target="_blank">our friends at Game Informer</a> released a sneak preview of all seven iconic characters for Starfinder. We wanted to share that image with you as well, but first—what do we mean by "iconic character," anyway?</p> 
               <p>As many of you probably already know, in the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, as in Pathfinder, every class is represented by an iconic character: a single individual who illustrates and embodies the concept behind that class. Originally, way back when Paizo was still publishing the magazines Dungeon and Dragon, this was just a convenient shorthand for us—rather than explaining to each new artist what made a ranger a ranger, we could just show them a single piece of art and say, "Draw this ranger." But to our surprise, as these reference characters appeared in more and more illustrations, fans began to grow attached to them and wonder about their stories. So when we launched Pathfinder, we went ahead and gave these characters names and backstories, and they quickly became some of our most popular characters, going on to star in comics, audio dramas, and more. (I know that I personally have a heck of a lot of fun writing Valeros, Merisiel, and all the rest in the Pathfinder comics!)</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Now, with Starfinder, we're excited to unveil a whole new lineup of iconic characters to showcase their respective classes and races! In the coming months, we'll be giving you each character's backstory in blog posts here at paizo.com, but for now here's a sneak preview of their art, plus their names, races, and classes. Going clockwise and starting with the leftmost character, we've got:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b>Raia (lashunta technomancer)</b>: Lashuntas are a race of telepaths, and technomancers are the magical version of computer programmers, hacking the laws of physics.</p> 
                <p><b>Iseph (android operative)</b>: Androids are artificial people, and operatives use stealth and skill to get in and out of dangerous situations.</p> 
                <p><b>Obozaya (vesk soldier)</b>: Vesk are powerful reptilian aliens, and soldiers specialize in heavy weapons and armor.</p> 
                <p><b>Keskodai (shirren mystic)</b>: Shirrens are insectile people who recently broke free from a predatory hive mind, and mystics channel the universe's mysterious energies, often through faith in a god.</p> 
                <p><b>Altronus (kasatha solarian)</b>: Kasathas are four-armed aliens from a desert world, and solarians shape the energy of stars and black holes into armor and weapons for themselves.</p> 
                <p><b>Navasi (human envoy)</b>: Humans are... well, humans, and envoys use wit and charm to bolster their allies and demoralize or befuddle enemies.</p> 
                <p><b>Quig (ysoki mechanic)</b>: Often called "ratfolk," ysoki are a plucky and hotheaded race, and mechanics build their own custom drones or rely on an implanted AI to aid them in combat.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Which of course leads to the question—which of these is your favorite? Let us know in the comments below, and stay tuned for more Starfinder previews and design blogs!</p>

               <p>First this week, we have the Dog, a small common miniature. This little guy looks fantastic for a common. The muscles standing out is freakin sweet. The pose could either be "waiting for you to throw the stick" or "about to maul your low level characters while they try to stand up after being knocked prone again and again and again and again and again". I may speak from personal experience. Turns out, dogs are horrifying opponents if you are short on hit points and don't have a good combat maneuver defense. This miniature could also be used as an animal companion. But lets move on.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170407-Dog.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170407-Dog_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Next, we have the Boy, a small uncommon. Don't let his baby face fool you. This miniature could be used as a halfling, the kid that delivers the message, or the prince named Joffrey that noone in the group minds finding out drank bad wine.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170407-Boy.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170407-Boy_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Then we have the Girl, another small uncommon. This young lady means business (see: knife). Highly versatile figure that could also double as a small character if one prefers.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170407-Girl.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170407-Girl_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Finally, we have the Reclamation Infantry, a medium common figure. Again, for a common, the detail on this guy is fantastic. Anyone wanting to play the grizzled old soldier should definitely pick up this miniature. Also, what GM doesn't need the drill sergeant, surly watchman, or veteran paladin npc to liven their game up?</p>

               <p>OH! There's also true dragons.</p> 
               <p>One of the increasingly tricky things to do with true dragons is that we've established them as existing in families of five—not six, not four, but five. So when we do a set of true dragons in a book, that's pretty much it for that category, which means the next bestiary that comes along has to have a new category. Fortunately, there's a LOT of really cool categories to explore when it comes to true dragons, and with <em>Bestiary 6</em> I was able to explore one that I'd been itching for since <em>Bestiary 2</em>, which presented dragons associated with several of the inner planes.</p> 
               <p>I'm talking, of course, about <em>Bestiary 6</em>'s planar dragons. At first I wasn't sure how to pull this off, since there are, after all, nine significant outer planes, each of which map to one of the nine alignments. Doesn't that imply that there should be 9 planar dragons? Perhaps... but in the end I decided it did not. Instead, I picked five alignments out of nine. These planar dragons include the crypt dragon (representing the neutral plane of the Boneyard*), the havoc dragon (representing the chaotic good plane of Elysium), the infernal dragon (representing the lawful evil of Hell), the paradise dragon (representing the lawful goodness of Heaven), and the rift dragon (representing the chaos and evil of the Abyss), yet the role these dragons play is not "Dragons you meet on the outer planes." Instead, they're dragons that you'll normally encounter on the Material Plane, after migrating there via portals or other methods with a singular goal—to reshape a material plane lair to reflect their home planes. In this way, we give this group of five dragons a unique shared trait beyond "they're all from the outer planes," in a way that doesn't make a potential future category of other planar dragons from existing. We'd just need to figure out a different theme or niche other than "dragons who come to the Material Plane to colonize" is all.</p> 
               <p>The fact that this gives GMs one more vector to include other-planar elements in Material Plane adventures without resorting to the old trope of "a wizard conjured things" is icing on the cake.</p> 
               <p>Pictured below are three of the five planar dragons. You'll need to wait for the book's release to check out the havoc and infernal dragons, of course!</p>

Now, at long last, we're revealing that final core race: the insectile shirrens!</p> 
               <p>Shirrens were once part of the Swarm, a monstrous, locust-like race that traveled from world to world, consuming all it encountered before moving on. Generations ago, however, a mysterious mutation caused an entire subcolony to break from the Swarm's hive mind, with each of its members gaining a sense of self. Addicted to the new drug of individualism, these renegades rejected the Swarm's mindless consumption, forming a new race called shirrens that eventually came to settle within the Pact World system.</p>

               <p>Shirrens are arthropods with chitinous exoskeletons, large compound eyes, and sensitive antennae that aid in their telepathy. Unlike many arthropodan races, they walk upright, manipulating items with three-clawed hands. In addition to their two sets of main limbs, they also have two sets of smaller limbs growing from their thoraxes. While often displayed, these “mating arms” are extremely weak and used only for ceremonial and reproductive purposes—to use them for mundane activities would be seen as grotesque and shameful.</p> 
               <p>Shirrens have three sexes: male, female, and host. During reproduction, female and male shirrens provide the initial eggs and sperm, and hosts incubate the fertilized eggs while also adding their own genetic material and immunities. Shirren young spend their first 2 years in a tiny, wormlike larval form, and are often carried around in protective containers to let them safely observe the world.</p> 
               <p>Shirrens define themselves by their individualism. When they left the Swarm, they assumed partial control over the neurological pleasure and pain systems by which they were formerly directed, and even generations later, making choices for themselves can literally flood them with pleasurable neurotransmitters. While this ability is not always beneficial—some shirrens deliberately drug themselves this way, becoming “option junkies” blissed out on sequences of trivial decisions—freedom of choice is crucial to shirren identity. At the same time, shirrens remain highly communal, and are valued as collaborators by other races due to their ability to foster teamwork and put the goals of the group first.</p> 
               <p>All 7 of the core Starfinder player races—humans, androids, kasathas, lashuntas, vesk, shirrens, and ysoki—are joined in the core rulebook by updated versions of Pathfinder's core races, and even more playable races will be following shortly behind in the Alien Archive. Now that the core rulebook is off to the printer, you're going to be seeing a steady stream of Starfinder-related preview blogs right up through the game's launch at Gen Con, so keep your transponders on and open to future transmissions!</p>

              <p itemprop="description"><i>This is the eighth installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href="http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml" target="_blank">Shannon Appelcline</a>.

              <p>Though they're wholly good, boons can be hard encounters to deal with, because you must decide how much effort to expend when technically none is required. The catch is that you need to acquire <i>some</i> boons for the continued health of your deck. Prioritize their acquisition appropriately.</p> 
              <h2>Spend the most effort to get cards for your deck</h2> 
              <p>It's worth expending effort to get cards that would improve characters' decks, because improving decks is the name of the game. This means that you should prioritize the acquisition of cards from the current adventure deck, because they're likely to be better than what is currently in your group's decks. In addition, you should focus on any cards that will benefit <i>your</i> character. You'll know what the gaps are in your character's deck—where he's got a surplus of lower-level cards and which cards work well with his skills and powers. So it's easy to know when you should expend effort.</p> 
              <p>Don't be afraid to discard and even bury cards to get boons of this sort. Be careful that you don't expend so many resources that you take a chance of losing the game... unless the card is <i>that</i> good, or unless you're losing already. In the latter case, go pig-from-hell wild and start expending <i>all</i> of your resources to get cool stuff.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-PR-PigFromHell_180.jpeg" alt="">
               <br><i>This card really doesn't have much to do with the topic—we just like saying “Pig from Hell.”</i>
              </div> 
              <h2>Spend some effort to get cards for your hand</h2> 
              <p>It's slightly less worthwhile to expend effort to collect boons that might be useful in your current game, but which you don't plan to keep. This includes allies and blessings that can give you turns, weapons that can let you attack, armor that can protect you, and spells that can do cool stuff.</p> 
              <p>How much effort should you spend? That depends on how good the card is.</p> 
              <p>For cards that can give you an exploration, like most blessings, it's worth spending a single blessing to guarantee (or nearly guarantee) its acquisition. Healing might allow you to see the new blessing more than once in a game, so at worst it's a break-even and at best it's an extra exploration later on. But one blessing should be the limit for a card you won't keep. And if you can instead expend a card that isn't worth an exploration (like Aid) or recharge a card to help, that's better.</p> 
              <p>For cards that don't give you an exploration, it generally <i>isn't</i> worth spending a blessing, because you're effectively trading an exploration for it. However, acquiring a decent weapon or armor that would be helpful in the short term could be still be worth discarding a non-exploration-granting card or recharging something.</p> 
              <p>And then you get to the bottom of the heap: cards that don't grant you a turn <i>and</i> aren't that great. Don't entirely ignore them; take a look and see if it serves a short-term purpose, like filling a gap in your hand. For example, if you don't have a weapon and you need a weapon, then it might be worth a minor cost to pick it up.</p> 
              <p>Of course, context is always key. If you're going to have to stop exploring because you don't have a weapon in your hand, then clearly it's worth spending a blessing to get that weapon, but that's a relatively rare case.</p> 
              <h2>Spend less effort to get fuel</h2> 
              <p>Some characters can use cards for fuel: Lem can cycle them for spell bonuses, Lini can discard them to increase her stats, and Amiri can bury cards to get stat bonuses. For these characters, <i>all cards are useful</i>. As with any less useful cards intended just for your hand, it's probably not worth a blessing to acquire these cards, but it's definitely worth some effort. For a character that must <i>bury</i> cards for fuel, like Amiri, it's even more worthwhile, because she faces the danger of her deck decreasing in size over time (something that Lem rarely worries about).</p> 
              <h2>Spend the least effort to get hit points</h2> 
              <p>Remember that every card is, at the least, a hit point—something you can discard as damage. Since even the least useful card still has some value, it's <i>always</i> worthwhile to pick up a random card at no cost (and maybe at the cost of a recharge), even if you plan to throw it out at the end of the turn. Don't forget about your reveal and recharge abilities even when you're rolling for boons that are pure dross.</p> 
              <h2>Spend at least some effort to gain trading stock</h2> 
              <p>If you're playing <i>Mummy's Mask</i>, then you have an extra card-sink to think about: traders, who let you exchange boons you don't want (of a particular adventure deck number or higher) for something better. To avoid wasting this opportunity, make sure your party has picked up some extra boons by the time you win a scenario! You don't have to worry about this if you're just trading at the Sunburst Market, which has a cost of one boon: you'd usually be swapping something in your hand for something at the market, so no problem. But, the more specific a trader is, the higher his cost. For example, Agymah and Shardizhad require three boons for each of their items. Then you should worry!</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-SunburstMarket.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-SunburstMarket_180.jpeg" alt=""></a><a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-Shardizhadr.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-Shardizhad_180.jpeg" alt=""></a><a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6033-Agymah.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6033-Agymah_180.jpeg" alt=""></a>
               <br><i>You get what you pay for. Corollary: You pay for what you get.</i>
              </div> 
              <p>To ensure that you <i>always</i> have enough trading stock for all your characters to trade, you need to have won a number of throwaway boons equal to the cost minus one for the trader that each player wants to visit. For example, if three players all wanted to visit Shardizhad and a fourth was going to the Sunburst Market, they'd need a total of six throwaway cards (plus the one each that they will usually be removing from their deck). However, this is probably an excessive count, because it's likely that many cards traders have to offer won't be any good for you. So, you'll only need enough throwaway boons for a few of the characters to trade — which is why trading stock is listed as the lowest priority here. If your group as a whole has already won a few non-interesting boons, you're probably fine. But maybe you need a few more if you plan to visit the more specific traders. However, if you're getting close to winning a scenario, and you don't have anything, then <i>spend a little effort to grab some boons</i> so that you can take full advantage of the traders at game's end.</p> 
              <h2>Prioritize boons over banes</h2> 
              <p>There's a big coda to this priority list of “boons to get”: You should generally work to encounter more boons than banes. Some of this is already covered in <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljdt?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Strategy">Choosing Location Decks</a> and <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljf8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Strategy">Moving to New Locations</a>: you might choose to start at a location because its boon-heavy, or you might choose to move to a location because a boon is on top of a deck. But be aware that you can also manipulate your decks to maximize boons. Use Auguries to push monsters and barriers down to the bottom. Use a Magic Spyglass to look at the top three cards in a deck, and if they're all banes, find a way to reshuffle the deck—perhaps even by leaving a bane undefeated! Mind you, if you're playing Mummy's Mask, Trigger cards can make explicit examination more difficult, so in that game consider other means to maximize your boons, like moving away from a deck when you've cleared out most of the boons. Just remember: To acquire boons, you must encounter boons. (Some restrictions may apply; always worry about <i>closing</i> locations first!)</p> 
              <p>Next month: Fighting the banes.</p>

               <p>As a point of note, Pathfinder designer Mark Seifter and Pathfinder Society Developer Linda Zayas-Palmer are attending to QC Gamefest. Just one more reason to attend the convention!</p> 
               <p>What does it take to run great conventions? A dedicated group of GMs, volunteers, and organizers. I want to give a huge shout out to all those individuals taking time from their own playing to work at conventions and bring Pathfinder Society to a location to you. Three cheers for your support, effort, and enthusiasm!</p> 
               <p>Speaking of which, we have a few dedicated GMs that reached the 5<sup>th</sup> star goal this month. To qualify for a fifth star, they must run 150 games, of which 10 must be special events, and run a game for a Venture-Captain, Regional Venture-Coordinator, or Paizo Org Play staff member. This does not include prep time, which can run upwards of 5 hours for each scenario ran. Three cheers for the GMs listed below, for all the time spent behind the screen!</p>

               <p>Just a reminder, the “OPC Needs a New Character” contest entries are due midnight Pacific tonight. See the organized play blog from Monday, March 20<sup>th</sup> for more information.</p> 
               <p>Next week’s blog will see a print of the top characters. You may vote on your favorite from April 10<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> and we will announce the winner on April 24<sup>th</sup>.</p>
