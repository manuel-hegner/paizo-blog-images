  \    </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">So far in our look into the forthcoming\
  \ <i>Ruins of Lastwall </i>set of prepainted plastic miniatures from our partners\
  \ at WizKids, we've seen the agents of undeath working to tighten the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant's grasp on the Inner Sea region and the noble defenders of Lastwall who\
  \ dedicate their lives to keeping the lich and his forces at bay. Today we look\
  \ at the forces of balance caught in the middle of the conflict between good and\
  \ evil.</p> \n     <p>Just as angels and daemons are the embodiment of good and\
  \ evil, respectively, so too are psychopomps the extraplanar manifestation of neutrality.\
  \ Working out of the Boneyard, these macabre outsiders work to maintain balance\
  \ in the universe, specifically around the journey of souls through life, death,\
  \ and the Great Beyond.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg8j?Announcing-Pathfinder-Battles-Ruins-of-Lastwall\"\
  ><span>when the set was announced</span></a>, we showed off the Morrigna Psychopomp,\
  \ a Medium rare figure. Two other psychopomps make their Pathfinder Battles debuts\
  \ in this set, presenting a range of challenge ratings for Game Masters. The tiny\
  \ uncommon Nosoi Psychopomp can be taken as an advanced familiar or serve as a guide\
  \ through the Boneyard, as it did for Valeros in the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/spiralofBones\"\
  >Spiral of Bones</a> comic series. The masked, birdlike figure can also stand in\
  \ for a myriad of small avians (if you can overlook its four wings and haunting\
  \ funeral mask).</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180125-Nosoi_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>At CR 7, the Vanth Psychopomp serves as the Boneyard's\
  \ foot soldiers, ensuring that nothing disturbs the natural cycle of souls—including\
  \ an army of undeath attempting to spread their foulness across an entire world.\
  \ Though they have no bias toward good or against evil, these Medium winged skeletons\
  \ are likely to side with the forces of Lastwall in the conflict against the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant. At an uncommon rarity, collectors are likely to get a handful of them\
  \ to fill out their armies.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180125-Vanth_500.jpeg\">\n   \
  \  </div> \n     <p>Similarly opposed to one another are the denizens of the Negative\
  \ and Positive Energy Planes, the forces of which play a pivotal role in the creation\
  \ and destruction of undead. From the Positive Energy Plane come the avian Jyoti,\
  \ while the Sceaduinar hail from the Negative. Like psychopomps, the jyoti and sceaduinar\
  \ have no moral bias toward good or evil, but they may serve either side in the\
  \ conflict nonetheless due to their affinity for positive and negative energy. Both\
  \ the Jyoti and Sceaduinar are Medium uncommon figures in this set.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190125-Jyoti_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190125-Sceaduinar_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>But it's not just outsiders holding steadfastly to their\
  \ neutrality! Among the strongest forces of balance on the Material Plane are the\
  \ protectors of the natural world, and one of the most disturbing of these guardians\
  \ are the equine fey known as Nuckelavees. A Large uncommon figure, this aquatic\
  \ monstrosity exacts vengeance on those who despoil nature, especially wetlands.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190125-Nuckelavee_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>Decidedly more amenable to discussion than their fey counterparts,\
  \ the enigmatic sphinxes of the deserts of northern Garund often serve as wise arbiters\
  \ in disputes or quizzical guardians of ancient treasures. <i>Ruins of Lastwall</i>\
  \ features an Androsphinx to compliment the Gynopshinx released in <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Battles: Deadly Foes</i> a few years back. A Large uncommon figure, this regal\
  \ magical beast is sure to inspire awe and respect among players and GMs alike.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190125-Androsphinx_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>While we're talking about the deserts of Osirion and its\
  \ former vassal states, it's the perfect time to show off two more pieces of dungeon\
  \ dressing from the set. The Afterlife Scale and Funerary Bed are both taken from\
  \ real-world Egyptian concepts, the former from the scale upon which Anubis weighs\
  \ the heart of the deceased to judge its worth and the latter from the actual funerary\
  \ bed found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun. Both make stunning set pieces in an\
  \ ancient tomb and could have any number of magical properties to meet a GM's storytelling\
  \ needs.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190125-EmbalmingTable_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190125-AfterlifeScale_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p><i>Ruins of Lastwall</i> features more figures of Pathfinder\
  \ deities than any previous set, and it would hardly be fair to include Iomedae\
  \ and Urgathoa without someone to represent the neutral planes. As such, Pharasma,\
  \ Goddess of Death makes her debut here, sitting regally upon her throne. The oldest\
  \ god in the current iteration of reality, Pharasma judges all souls upon their\
  \ deaths, including fellow deities, and she makes an imposing figure, worthy of\
  \ her important role in the setting. A Large rare figure, Pharasma, Goddess of Death\
  \ is probably my favorite figure in the entire set.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190125-GoddessofDeath_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>That's it for this week's previews! Next time, we'll look\
  \ at the set's offering of creatures and people who aren't necessarily involved\
  \ in the conflict between the Whispering Tyrant and the knights of Lastwall but\
  \ have nevertheless embraced darkness in their own ways.</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
