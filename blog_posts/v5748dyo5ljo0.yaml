  \ The Vesk!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, March 15, 2017</p> \n    <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">For months now, we've\
  \ been teasing the fact that <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a> has seven core\
  \ races, of which only five have been announced—humans, androids, lashunta, kasatha,\
  \ and ysoki. What's more, we've hinted that the remaining two would be brand new\
  \ races you've never seen before. So now, for the first time ever, we present...\
  \ the vesk!</p> \n     <p>Resembling 7-foot-tall humanoid lizards with beards of\
  \ spiky bone, vesk come from the nearest inhabited solar system to the Golarion\
  \ system. Fiercely militant and highly organized, vesk have strict honor codes and\
  \ social mores based on conquest and prowess in battle—a cultural focus that quickly\
  \ led them to conquer all the other races in their solar system, establishing a\
  \ massive empire called the Veskarium. For generations, their conquest ended there,\
  \ stifled by the vast distances between stars. With the introduction of Drift travel,\
  \ however, they quickly turned first contact with the races of the Golarion system\
  \ into an all-out war of invasion (and inadvertently created the Pact Worlds as\
  \ the governments of that system banded together in mutual defense). The brutal\
  \ conflict lasted for centuries, until the sudden arrival of the Swarm threatened\
  \ to annihilate all life in both systems. Forced to put aside their differences,\
  \ the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds were able to join forces and drive off the Swarm,\
  \ and the tenuous truce forged in that fight continues to this day—if only barely.</p>\

  \ merchants and others with peaceful professions can advance economically in vesk\
  \ society, political power is the exclusive domain of those who've proven themselves\
  \ in armed conflict. Surprisingly, this proof doesn't need to come through military\
  \ service, or even benefit the Veskarium. Many vesk attain similar elevation in\
  \ social status through performing mercenary work, engaging in dueling, or providing\
  \ security on exploration missions. Though obsessed with conquest, dominance, and\
  \ social rank, vesk find an equally strong sense of honor and pride in fulfilling\
  \ their agreements and treating subordinates of all races fairly. They are stoic\
  \ and taciturn with strangers but capable of great bursts of emotion in private\
  \ or in the heat of battle. Vesk society tends to be efficient, respectful, and\
  \ law-abiding—especially since nearly any insult or violation of custom could trigger\
  \ a brutally violent blood debt.</p> \n     <p>Vesk adventuring with races from\
  \ other systems fall into two categories. The first are mercenaries or glory-seekers\
  \ looking for a chance to engage in honorable combat and build up their prestige.\
  \ The second are nonwarrior vesk who have rejected their home society for its obsession\
  \ with combat and have chosen instead to seek opportunities among more open-minded\
  \ races. Warrior vesk most often fit the soldier class, though a growing number\
  \ have become intrigued by the path of the solarian. Noncombatant vesk often lean\
  \ toward becoming mystics, though some overcome the traditional vesk culture's dismissal\
  \ of education to become mechanics or even technomancers.</p> \n     <p>Stay tuned\
  \ for more Starfinder blog posts in the coming weeks as we ramp up to the game's\
