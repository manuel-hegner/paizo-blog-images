  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljtw?Wess-Last-Words\">yesterday's Paizo blog</a>, former Editor-in-Chief\
  \ F. Wesley Schneider has begun a new and exciting journey, leaving the offices\
  \ of the Paizo building behind. And as you may have gleaned from that blog, remaining\
  \ Paizonians have some words for Wes. And, without further delay, here they are!</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Wes Schneider had been at Paizo less than a year\
  \ the first time I completely changed his job and basically required him to be a\
  \ superhero. It was a trend that would continue for more than a decade, but the\
  \ difference is, that first time, I wasn't 100% certain it would work. Truth be\
  \ told, although Wes had, at that point, served as an assistant editor on <em>Dragon</em>\
  \ magazine for a half-dozen issues, I still wasn't 100% certain I could tell the\
  \ difference between Wes and the magazine's other assistant editor, the late great\
  \ Mike McArtor. Both had come to the company at the same time to do the same job,\
  \ both were irritatingly young in a way that made me realize I was no longer the\
  \ youngest scamp working on D&amp;D in an official capacity, and both pretty much\
  \ had the exact same haircut and facial hair. Both Wes and Mike had also worked\
  \ with the previous <em>Dragon</em> editor to \"relaunch\" the magazine with an\
  \ almost completely player-focused approach with <em>Dragon</em> #323. The only\
  \ trouble was, as a long-time GM and lifetime reader of <em>Dragon</em>, I didn't\
  \ really care for that approach. Fresh off my own relaunch of <em>Dungeon</em>,\
  \ I knew that improving <em>Dragon</em> to be the magazine I thought it could be,\
  \ I'd need to completely undo a lot of the work the previous team had done, within\
  \ only about two months of them doing it in the first place. And I needed to figure\
  \ out a way to have Wes and Mike do a lot of the dirty work for me. I took the two\
  \ young lads out for lunch at the local Thai spot and said, essentially, \"You know\
  \ that relaunch you guys have been working so hard on? We're not going to do that\
  \ anymore. Instead, we're going to do THIS.\"</p> \n      <p>It could have been\
  \ an utter disaster. But Wes took the news like a champ, saw the potential in the\
  \ changes I was proposing, and ably stepped up to the challenge. I was so impressed\
  \ with Wes's attitude I made him the section editor of <em>Dragon</em>'s First Watch\
  \ column. I did this mostly because I knew he could handle coordinating reams of\
  \ monthly RPG industry news and new product reviews, but I also did it because I\
  \ knew we couldn't pay Wes what he was worth and that the position would put Wes\
  \ in the path of mountains of cool free stuff that people sent to the magazine in\
  \ hopes of getting coverage. Things like gaming books, board games, soundtracks,\
  \ action figures—you know, nerd stuff.</p> \n      <p>Thirteen years later, as I\
  \ sit here writing this within hours of Wes's going away lunch, several of those\
  \ dubious treasures are sitting on the \"Free Table\" right outside my office. Some\
  \ of these well-loved artifacts are coated with a decade of dust, while others are\
  \ well-loved desk trinkets looking for a new home. In the time between that first\
  \ <em>Dragon</em> issue and today, as Wes prepares to move on to exciting new career\
  \ and creative challenges, I've set countless near-impossibly outlandish tasks before\
  \ Wes, and he has not just risen to the occasion each time, but he's basically one-shotted\
  \ all of these monsters with style, grace, and aplomb. I'll miss Wes's level-headed\
  \ clarity, his compassion for his fellow employees, his values, and his phenomenal\
  \ creative contributions to the Pathfinder line, which alas will now have to come\
  \ in the form of what I hope will be many freelance assignments.</p> \n      <p>And\
  \ while I'll also miss Wes's amazing, can-do attitude and ability to achieve the\
  \ impossible, I'm less worried about the impact of not having that around. You see,\
  \ in the last 13 years Wes has been setting his own series of impossible challenges\
  \ for his own staff of editors and developers. Following his example, they also\
  \ exceed my expectations on a daily basis. Even though Wes will no longer be walking\
  \ Paizo's halls after today, the clarity, compassion, values, and ability to achieve\
  \ the impossible with grace and aplomb lives on thanks to his amazing example.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Thanks for helping me with <em>Dragon</em> magazine, Wes, and for Pathfinder\
  \ and everything in between. We'll miss you terribly, but you've made such a huge\
  \ impact on all of us here at Paizo that your legacy will continue for many years\
  \ to come!</p> \n      <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n      <hr> \n   \
  \   <p>Maybe 10 years ago, Wes took me aside and let me know that he'd accepted\
  \ a job at Privateer Press, and would be leaving the company. I got all weepy and\
  \ hugged him, making a big scene. A few hours later he told me he'd lied just to\
  \ see what I'd do. (\"I can't believe I got a hug out of it!\" he mused.) So you\
  \ can understand why I won't quite believe he's leaving until I see his office empty.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Wes was one of the first friends I made at Paizo, back when I was 20\
  \ years old and he was only a few years older, the two of us banding together to\
  \ embrace our role as the department's hipster children. We actually shared our\
  \ <em>Dungeon</em> magazine debut, co-writing the adventure \"Shut-In\" together\
  \ in issue #128. (We would also write our first Adventure Path installment together,\
  \ \"The Lightless Depths\" in <em>Dungeon</em>'s Savage Tide AP, but we eventually\
  \ started talking to each other again after that one, so all's well that ends well.)\
  \ I often say that my first years at Paizo were spent learning what was cool, and\
  \ Wes was my primary teacher in that regard, hosting Educational Movie Nights in\
  \ which he and Jacobs attempted to correct my character flaws by showing me classic\
  \ horror films. For the last 13 years, we've constantly learned from each other,\
  \ propping each other up as we stumbled our way into managing departments, exploring\
  \ social media, or writing comics. He taught me how to write adventures. I taught\
  \ him how to write novels. He taught me how to buy jeans that fit. I taught him\
  \ how to stop using that terrible crunchy hair gel that made him look damp all the\
  \ time. He taught me to accept my own sexuality. I taught him that his garbage disposal\
  \ was a <i>perfectly acceptable</i> place to vomit after challenging Jason Bulmahn\
  \ to a drinking contest. (Wes has never accepted my explanation that, since I was\
  \ half Jason's size at the time and drunkenness is a factor of body weight, I'd\
  \ actually won mathematically.)</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      \

  \ \n       <p><i>2008—Wes and I at Erik Mona Day and Gen Con 2008, respectively.<br>\
  \ 2010—Wes and I just boldly hiked over the hill behind the Paizo offices and discovered\
  \ the fabled Treasure Mounds—colorful hills of broken glass for the nearby recycling\
  \ plant.</i></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>I'm pretty sure that at every convention\
  \ we've ever been to together, someone has mistaken us for each other (most notably\
  \ one of his longtime family friends, leading to what may well have been Gen Con's\
  \ Most Awkward Hug). And the weird thing is, it kind of makes sense—after this many\
  \ years of friendship and collaboration, probably half my verbal tics and gestures\
  \ come from Wes, to the point where <i>I can't even remember which half</i>. So\
  \ Wes, while moving on is always bittersweet, you can take comfort in knowing that\
  \ part of you will live on in this building long after you leave. (I'm talking about\
  \ your office couch. I'm pretty sure the courts will give me joint custody.)</p>\
  \ \n      <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p> \n      <hr> \n  \
  \    <p>Most of my best memories of working with Wes at Paizo are probably better\
  \ left off this blog, so I'll keep this short. Wes has been a tireless advocate\
  \ for the editorial team over the years, and more than that, a rock-solid friend\
  \ who somehow always has the perfect piece of unexpected dry wit to get you through\
  \ the rough patches. We'll miss you, Wes, but I'm happy for the bright and rewarding\
  \ future you have ahead of you.<br> </p>\n      <p>Christopher Carey<br> <i>Senior\
  \ Editor</i></p> \n      <hr> \n      <p>How do you pay adequate tribute to someone\
  \ like Wes? Charming as hell; endlessly creative; never lazy in the work of making\
  \ life better for his colleagues or repairing broken aspects of our games, our industry,\
  \ and our world; always present as the company therapist (to be fair, Wes, you brought\
  \ that one on yourself by putting a couch in your office); hilarious, especially\
  \ in moments where humor and perspective were needed; generous to a fault with his\
  \ time, brilliance, wisdom, and wit; creator of the best margin notes and doodles;\
  \ deeply kind; mind-blowingly clever; and stunningly insightful.</p> \n      <p>He\
  \ has been the genius loci of this place and this team for as long as I've been\
  \ here, and we are all richer in spirit and creativity for having had the chance\
  \ to work with him. May we do justice, as we go forward, to everything he's taught\
  \ us.</p> \n      <p>Jessica Price<br> <i>Project Manager</i></p> \n      <hr> \n\
  \      <p>Wes was one of the first people I worked with at Paizo. Together with\
  \ Mike McArtor, we were the team behind <em>Dragon</em> up through its final print\
  \ issue. While all of us had various jobs developing and editing the articles, Wes\
  \ had an extra special assignment. He got us stuff! Back then, a section of the\
  \ magazine was dedicated to new and exciting releases in the game industry and nerd\
  \ culture in general. Wes put together these articles, which often entailed getting\
  \ samples from the various companies. Once the articles were done and the products\
  \ revealed, these samples would often be put up for grabs (if Wes didn't keep them\
  \ himself). To this day, I still have a Monty Python Horse Action Figure, that Wes\
  \ got as part of a big contest, hiding in my desk. That was over a decade ago. Over\
  \ the years, Wes has been part of the bedrock of Paizo and while I am sad to see\
  \ him go, I am excited for him and his future endeavors. Now if I can just get him\
  \ to send us some swag from his new job...</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Lead Designer</i></p> \n      <hr> \n      <p>Wes was\
  \ the first Paizo editor to reach out to me and the rest of the PathfinderWiki team\
  \ asking if there was anything we needed in the site's earliest days, providing\
  \ us with specially tailored blog posts and shoutouts to increase our content and\
  \ traffic. He was also one of the first Paizo developers to give me a shot as a\
  \ freelancer (he, Josh Frost, and Sean K Reynolds all gave me small assignments\
  \ about the same time), so my career in the industry owes much to him recognizing\
  \ my potential. In our time working together, Wes has taught me countless things,\
  \ both relevant to the publishing industry and the creative process in general.\
  \ But above all, Wes has been a great friend, hosting the absolute best themed 80s\
  \ movie marathons and geeking out over the same comics and movies and video games\
  \ that I do.</p> \n      <p>I'm sad to see you go, Wes, but excited for the opportunities\
  \ that lie in your future. And I can't wait to play the games you'll make, engross\
  \ myself in the stories you'll tell, and enjoy the worlds you are sure to create\
  \ wherever you may go.</p> \n      <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n\
  \      <hr> \n      <p>As a fan, it's easy to gloss over a book's credits page.\
  \ I did it for several years as I eagerly flipped straight to the newest classes,\
  \ feats, and archetypes, rarely giving more than a casual glance at who the developers,\
  \ authors, or editors were. Even so, I had friends who had played in Wes's PaizoCon\
  \ games (and buzzed excitedly about it for days afterward), and when he chimed in\
  \ on the messageboards, fans snapped to attention. I couldn't understand quite how\
  \ important he was to Paizo until I started working here. Wes has been a tireless\
  \ advocate for each of us, whether conveying conveying our needs to the executives\
  \ or trumpeting our accomplishments to the world. He's always proven accommodating\
  \ and encouraging to us, urging us to make our mark on the world and make the most\
  \ of the setting—even the pieces that are his creations.</p> \n      <p>I may sass\
  \ him often—probably as often as he returns the favor—but for all the snark, we\
  \ all know that he's been there for us when we've needed it and given us space when\
  \ we just needed to get things done. Paizo shall continue, and though we will feel\
  \ his absence for years to come, we're ready for whatever lies ahead thanks to the\
  \ example he set.</p> \n      <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play Lead Developer</i></p>\
  \ \n      <hr> \n      <p>Wes has been a patient mentor and fierce advocate for\
  \ those of us on his team, and an able peacekeeper between people who care deeply\
  \ but in different directions about what we do (which is to say, everyone at Paizo).\
  \ Despite his attempts to maintain a Machiavellian image, his visible distress whenever\
  \ he had to ask us to do anything particularly arduous always gave away of his concern\
  \ for us. Wes, I wish you the best, will miss you heaps, and hope your future collaborators\
  \ appreciate you as much as you deserve! (P.s. No take-backs on the feathers—they\
  \ must find a new surprise home.)</p> \n      <p>Judy Bauer<br> <i>Managing Editor</i></p>\
  \ \n      <hr> \n      <p>It's still hard to wrap my head around the fact that Wes\
  \ is headed out of Paizo's doors soon for the final time. For what seemed like forever,\
  \ Wes <i>was</i> Paizo, in my worldview.</p> \n      <p>Back at Gen Con 2011, he\
  \ was the first friend from Paizo I met when I was digging for ways to break into\
  \ the gaming industry. Luckily for me, the email thread that spawned with Wes from\
  \ that meeting turned into one gig, and then many others. Then, the phone call (again,\
  \ with Wes), and here I am in Redmond. I've always kept that first email thread\
  \ with Wes in my inbox because it marked a turning point in my life, and so did\
  \ meeting Wes.</p> \n      <p>Since that first Gen Con, I have unabashedly looked\
  \ up to Wes personally and professionally, admired him, and felt a creative kinship\
  \ with him. When we moved to Redmond, Wes became one of my best friends.</p> \n\
  \      <p>It is likely that I would not be in the tabletop gaming industry without\
  \ Wes. It is almost certain that I would not work for Paizo as a developer if it\
  \ were not for him. In many ways, Wes helped me discover who I want to be as a professional\
  \ and as a creative.</p> \n      <p>You might be leaving the office, Wes, but you'll\
  \ always be on the hook for that. And, before you can say it: <i>How dare you?!</i></p>\
  \ \n      <p>Amanda Hamon Kunz<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n      <hr> \n      <p>Wes,\
  \ I will greatly miss working with you. You've taught me so much in the five years\
  \ that I've been here (and even more in the previous years while I was an up-and-coming\
  \ freelancer). I thank you for giving me some my first pieces of freelance work\
  \ for Paizo, always supporting my and other freelancer's work and ultimately giving\
  \ me a job here. I quite literally wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.</p> \n\
  \      <p>This has been a wonderful experience and your leadership and guidance\
  \ over the time has made all the difference. We've come up with cool ideas together\
  \ and imagined and developed wonderfully disturbing characters, stories, and monsters.\
  \ As you go on to your next big thing, know that I'll keep a creepy lantern burning\
  \ to attract all the scary monsters!</p> \n      <p>Adam Daigle<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
  \ \n      <hr> \n      <p>When I only knew F. Wesley Schneider as a name on a book\
  \ byline, I imagined a very different man. With a tough and academic name like F.\
  \ Wesley Schneider and a writing style that was witty and confrontational, clearly\
  \ he would be enormous and muscular, jolly and well-read, but probably kind of a\
  \ douche. Years later, at my first PaizoCon, I spent a good thirty minutes chatting\
  \ with the sweetest, most optimistic, nonthreatening, well-dressed man at the entire\
  \ hotel, talking about games and then... I want to say Zelda and Castlevania? Then\
  \ he had to run to a panel, and I realized I'd never asked his name.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>\"Oh, I'm Wes Schneider,\" he said, as if he were stunned that anyone in the\
  \ world didn't know who he was.</p> \n      <p>\"Wait, <i>you're</i> Wes Schneider,\"\
  \ I responded, dumbstruck that he was a foot shorter than me. Then I ran off to\
  \ get my copy of <em>Seven Days to the Grave</em> and made him sign it after his\
  \ panel.</p> \n      <p>Ever since that day, I've rested comfortably in the knowledge\
  \ that I could crush F. Wesley Schneider with my bare hands should the need arise.\
  \ And thankfully, since that day, the need never has.</p> \n      <p>Wes Schneider\
  \ is a unique man, above and beyond his extraordinary way with words and keen wit.\
  \ He is gifted with deep empathy, and more compassion than any one person should\
  \ be burdened with. He shepherds the best traits in others, and helps them find\
  \ what they need in themselves. He teaches in a way that leaves you feeling empowered\
  \ rather than chastised. He takes care of those around him, sacrificing his own\
  \ health and time to do so.</p> \n      <p>He's my friend, and he has helped me\
  \ become a better person. Working alongside him has been an extraordinary blessing.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Also, he's frustratingly good at <em>Battletoads</em>.</p> \n     \
