  artist: "all but the doomed through the night sky. Devil-Spawned: The Sandpoint\
    \ devil is the son of a widow named Agatha Leeds, a woman who used to live north\
    \ of town and was said to practice dark magics and consort with evil beings. When\
    \ she wandered into town round with child, she ignored all questions about her\
    \ pregnancy. Weeks later, her home was found reduced to cinders with its mysterious\
    \ owner missing. It wasn't long thereafter that the first sightings of the Sandpoint\
    \ devil began. Disappearances: Evidence of Sandpoint devil sightings often disappears\
    \ before it can be examined. Tracks, bitten animals, weapons dripping with its\
    \ blood, and similar such evidence simply vanish, no matter how well watched or\
    \ guarded. In fact, even those who have sought to catch or kill the Sandpoint\
    \ devil have disappeared without a trace, both during their hunts and in the weeks\
    \ after returning home"
