  \ itemprop=\"description\">See that photograph? That's the oldest picture I have\
  \ of me in the Paizo offices, taken by former Paizo Art Director Sean Glenn back\
  \ in early 2006. At that point, I had already been at Paizo for a year and a half,\
  \ working my way up from website image wrangler and editorial intern to Paizo's\
  \ sole customer service person, then at last into a coveted Assistant Editorship\
  \ on <em>Dungeon</em>. Much like Jon Snow, I knew nothing. While I'd spent my college\
  \ years practicing to be a journalist, and had a whole adolescence of RPG gaming\
  \ under my belt, I was a rank amateur when it came to professional game design—\
  living proof of the \"fake it till you make it\" strategy. (I actually bought my\
  \ first 3.5 rulebooks with the money from \"Shut In,\" the first <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ adventure I co-wrote with Wes Schneider.)</p> \n     <p>It was a crazy time. All\
  \ of us in the Editorial Pit were pretty much broke—until Paizo brought me on full-time,\
  \ I'd been teaching SAT prep classes at night and living off some modest Wheel of\
  \ Fortune winnings—but it didn't matter, because I was spending every day learning\
  \ about games and world-building from my coworkers. Folks like James Jacobs, Erik\
  \ Mona, Wes Schneider, and Jason Bulmahn, who remain in my eyes some of the world's\
  \ foremost experts on what makes fantasy cool. We would argue furiously. We would\
  \ go out drinking (once I finally turned 21, that is). We would occasionally all\
  \ ditch work—with Lisa's approval—and go to the movies in the middle of the day.\
  \ Wes would orchestrate elaborate pranks. Jacobs and I taped off our combined cubicle\
  \ and declared it the Independent Republic of Jameslandia, within which he would\
  \ draw me sticky-note cartoons or perform impromptu puppet shows with his collection\
  \ of Godzilla plushies.</p> \n     <p>It was, in short, freakin' magical.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Smash cut to September of 2017, and I've been at Paizo for 13 years, almost\
  \ to the day. A lot's changed. The company is huge. Pathfinder's a household name\
  \ in RPG circles. I've run a novel line, managed critical teams through high times\
  \ and crises, written probably millions of words about Golarion, and now find myself\
  \ Creative Director of Starfinder—a game which, after more than a year of grueling\
  \ (but exciting!) work, has just had one of the biggest launches of anything Paizo's\
  \ ever done. Watching the frenzy at Gen Con this year, walking down the line signing\
  \ autographs and chatting with folks who'd been waiting for two hours or more to\
  \ buy the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>, was one of the most satisfying moments\
  \ of my career.</p> \n     <p>Which is why it's time for me to leave. As of September\
  \ 12th, I'll be stepping down as Starfinder's Creative Director and resigning from\
  \ Paizo to write full-time.</p> \n     <p>Sound crazy? Let me explain:</p> \n  \
  \   <p>As a kid, I was heartbroken when Bill Watterson ended <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em>.\
  \ I couldn't understand how somebody could do such great work—work that touched\
  \ so many people—and then just stop. In the last few years, however, I think I've\
  \ finally begun to understand. By walking away when he did, Watterson ensured that\
  \ <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em> would never slowly slide into mediocrity. He'd never\
  \ burn out and start to resent it. He gave us the best of what he had to give in\
  \ that arena, and then he moved on. So even as I miss those characters, I salute\
  \ his artistic integrity. And it's in that same spirit that I'm now leaving Paizo.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/Sutter2017.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/Sutter2017_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>I'm extremely proud of everything I've helped to create here\
  \ at Paizo, but of course Starfinder is my most recent baby. While the world is\
  \ just now getting its first taste of the game, the production times involved mean\
  \ that we on the Starfinder team have been living it for a year and a half, and\
  \ I've actually already overseen the whole first year of releases. But as much as\
  \ there's still plenty more I'd love to explore with Starfinder, I can't escape\
  \ the fact that I've been making RPGs at Paizo for my entire adult life, and it's\
  \ time now to devote more than a few scattered hours each week to my other artistic\
  \ loves—particularly fiction and comics.</p> \n     <p>Does that mean I'm done writing\
  \ for Pathfinder and Starfinder? Heck no! If anything, I hope that no longer working\
  \ for Paizo full-time means I'll have <i>more</i> time to write for both games as\
  \ a freelancer. And while it's hard to give up Starfinder's captain's chair, I'm\
  \ positive that Rob, Sarah, Owen, Jason, and the rest of the team are going to continue\
  \ to take the game in amazing new directions. As both a fan and a freelancer, I\
  \ can't wait to see where they go.</p> \n     <p>After 13 years, there are far too\
  \ many people to thank, so I hope everyone will forgive me if I keep this short\
  \ and just shout out a few of my fellow old-timers. To Lisa, who scraped together\
  \ a job for an ambitious kid. To Erik, the editor-in-chief who slapped a copy of\
  \ his own adventure \"The Whispering Cairn\" down on the new editorial intern's\
  \ desk and challenged him to find things wrong with it. To Jacobs, for educational\
  \ movie nights and teaching me what makes adventures fun. To Sarah, who taught me\
  \ how to work well with artists, and Bulmahn, who taught me that you should never\
  \ bring algebra to a drinking contest. To my longtime partner in creative crime,\
  \ Wes Schneider, for always having my back and consistently forcing me to up my\
  \ game. To Chris Carey for being my fiction buddy, and Judy Bauer for kindly but\
  \ firmly teaching me to be a better, more mindful person. And to everyone else—\
  thank you. There's no one here that I haven't learned from or laughed with at some\
  \ point.</p> \n     <p>Last of all, I want to say one giant thank you to everyone\
  \ reading this. I've always found the Paizo community unbelievably supportive, and\
  \ for the last 13 years you've been the reason I'm able to live the dream. Whether\
  \ you're one of the superfans who sent us pizzas during those first big Pathfinder\
  \ crunches or a new friend trying out Starfinder for the first time—thanks.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>All right, no more stalling. It's time for me to cue up the Annie Lennox\
  \ track from the end of <em>Return of the King</em> and sail off into the west.\
  \ I hope some of you will continue to drop in and say hi on my Twitter at <a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/jameslsutter\" target=\"_blank\">@jameslsutter</a> and my <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jameslsutter/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook author\
  \ page</a>, or keep up with my latest work on <a href=\"http://jameslsutter.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">jameslsutter.com</a>.</p> \n     <p>It's been an amazing adventure.\
  \ Now on to the next!</p> \n     <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Creative Director Emeritus</i></p>\
