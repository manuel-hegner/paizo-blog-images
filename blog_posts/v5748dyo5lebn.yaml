  >We're now less than three weeks from the January 23rd release date for the new\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted\
  \ fantasy miniatures! So far we've revealed nearly 40 of the set's 55 figures, but\
  \ a little math will tell you that from now until the release date, we've got to\
  \ reveal a decent number of figures to show them all off before you can buy them\
  \ yourselves in the store.</span></p> \n    <p>So let's go off to the races!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We've previously revealed the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldwh\">Medium\
  \ and Large Fire Elementals</a>, and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le1x\">the Medium\
  \ and Large Water Elementals</a>. This week, it's time to reveal two more elementals,\
  \ leaving only two more for future previews.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-EarthElementalMedium.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-EarthElementalMedium_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up we have the Medium Earth Elemental,\
  \ a rocky bruiser erupting from the ground to smash some hurt onto the heads of\
  \ your player characters. Painted in dark browns and grays and with glowing red\
  \ eyes, this figure is a pretty typical example of its kind. Cool green crystal\
  \ formations along his arms give the Medium Earth Elemental a distinctive look.\
  \ The whole figure is sculpted in clear plastic because we originally wanted to\
  \ leave the crystals completely clear, or slightly greenish tinted to match the\
  \ colors on the original art for this creature, which first appeared in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8tj5\"><i>Bestiary Box</i></a>. Much to our surprise, versions of\
  \ the figure featuring a pearlescent coat of green paint over the crystals actually\
  \ looked much better than the clear plastic, so as in the case with some of the\
  \ other elementals, we decided to go with paint over clear plastic. This surprised\
  \ me (I thought we'd prefer clear), but in this case a huge consensus of Paizonians\
  \ agreed that the painted crystals simply looked better.</p> \n    <p>But all was\
  \ not lost for lovers of clear plastic! We used the mold for the Medium Earth Elemental\
  \ as the basis for the Lava Lurker figure that's part of the ongoing <a href=\"\
  http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online Kickstarter Campaign</a>. That figure is very\
  \ much clear, with red tints that make him look like, well, he lurks in lava.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-EarthElementalLarge.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-EarthElementalLarge_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Bigger is often better, and that adage\
  \ is certainly true when it comes to earth elementals! Behold the Large Earth Elemental,\
  \ a dude you definitely don't want pounding you into the dirt (but whom you may\
  \ wish to summon to pound someone else!). The coloration on this figure is very\
  \ similar to his Medium counterpart, only at a size pushing the very top of Large,\
  \ he's significantly more intimidating. I love this figure's wide jaw and expressive\
  \ face. You can almost hear him shouting \"IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ Medium elementals in this set are at the common rarity, while the Larges are rares.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I'm going to hold on to the Large and Medium Air Elementals until a future\
  \ preview. They are also awesome, but I don't want to over-elementalize you guys\
  \ in one sitting. I'll leave that for when you open your own boxes of the Shattered\
  \ Star set and start assembling your own elemental armies!</p> \n    <p>Instead,\
  \ let's take a look at two more Large figures from the Shattered Star set!</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-GlassGolem.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-GlassGolem_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up next we have the Glass Golem, a figure with such\
  \ a complex paint scheme that it was one of the very last to be completed (and thus\
  \ my cruddy iPhone photo will have to suffice for the moment). As the <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldnr\">Shining Child from the Rise of the Runelords set</a>\
  \ and this set's elementals have taught us, \"clear\" figures are among the trickiest\
  \ to get right in the painting stage.</p> \n    <p>Simply casting the figures in\
  \ clear plastic never works, as important sculpt details vanish without proper shading.\
  \ Painting over the clear plastic completely has proven to be the correct option\
  \ in a few cases, but it always seems like a bit of a disappointment and a copout.\
  \ The best solution, as Goldilocks certainly knew, was to get the paint balance\
  \ JUUUUUST RIGHT. In the case of the Glass Golem, we wanted not just a neat clear\
  \ effect, but something that actually looks like glass. After several tries, we\
  \ finally got the balance right.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-FireGiant.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-FireGiant_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week is the cantankerous Fire\
  \ Giant, a mean old brute ready to hack you apart with his crude sword. Thanks to\
  \ drybrushing (and a little bit of clear plastic peeking through here and there),\
  \ this guy looks like he burns with an inner fire. His face and fiery beard are\
  \ very expressive, and will make him stand out among his other giant kin.</p> \n\
  \    <p>That's it for this week! Next week we'll take a look at some more key NPCs\
  \ from the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered Star Adventure\
  \ Path</a>!</p> \n    <p>Also next week, we'll reveal additional details about a\
  \ special convention-season promotional repaint goblin figure that we'll be distributing\
  \ throughout 2013! Backers of the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online Kickstarter Campaign</a> at the Goblin Squad\
  \ level and above will get a certificate to receive this figure FREE at Gen Con.\
  \ So come on back and check it out, this is definitely a figure you will not want\
  \ to miss!</p> \n    <p>See you in seven days!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
