  description\">The <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\">Pathfinder Playtest</a> doesn't\
  \ release until August, but attendees at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2018</a>\
  \ will get a chance to see the evolution of Pathfinder in action!</p> \n    <p>Two\
  \ of our popular Delve tables have been dedicated to running Playtest mini-adventures\
  \ all weekend long. These 30-40 minute long games are designed to give you a taste\
  \ of what's new in the Playtest. There is no registration for these delves, just\
  \ stop by between 9:00 AM-6:00 PM Friday and Sunday, 9:00 AM-5:00 PM on Saturday,\
  \ or 9:00 AM-1:00 PM on Monday. On Saturday from 9:00 AM-12:00 PM we'll have the\
  \ designers themselves running the tables for groups of lucky adventurers and talking\
  \ Playtest Rules with spectators.</p> \n    <p>Friday evening in Olympic 2, Guests\
  \ of Honor: The Glass Cannon Podcast will be recording the finale for the Crypt\
  \ of the Everflame Playtest game run by Jason Bulmahn. You can listen to <a href=\"\
  https://glasscannonpodcast.com/the-pathfinder-playtest-parts-1-and-2/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Parts 1 &amp; 2</a> and <a href=\"https://glasscannonpodcast.com/the-pathfinder-playtest-parts-3-and-4/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Parts 3 &amp; 4</a> on Glass Cannon's website.</p> \n    <p>For\
  \ a more academic approach than rolling dice at the delves, the Design team will\
  \ be hosting an \"Introduction to the Pathfinder Playtest\" seminar on Saturday\
  \ from 1:00 PM-3:00 PM followed by a \"How to Playtest\" panel from 3:00 PM-4:00\
  \ PM for those who want to learn all about how to provide feedback and help shape\
  \ the next edition. Afterwards, from 4:00 PM-5:00 PM, Creative Director James Jacobs\
  \ and Franchise Manager Mark Moreland will talk about the possible changes to the\
  \ campaign setting and the world of Golarion. Rounding out the Playtest Seminars\
  \ on Saturday from 5:00 PM-6:00 PM, the Design team will be back with \"Find Our\
  \ Path\"—a panel for attendees to tell the Designers what they hope to find in the\
  \ next evolution of Pathfinder.</p> \n    <p>Sunday afternoon from 2:00 PM-3:00\
  \ PM the Organized Play Q&amp;A panel will also be including a discussion on how\
  \ the Playtest rules will interact with Organized Play Pathfinder games. Come with\
  \ your questions for Tonya Woldridge, John Compton and Linda Zayas-Palmer.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Our Celebrity Gaming events are back for PaizoCon 2018, and Sunday's game\
  \ from 3:00 PM-5:00 PM has Director of Game Design Jason Bulmahn as game master\
  \ for a group of heroes played by Customer Service Rep Diego Valdez, Managing Editor\
  \ Judy Bauer, Editor James Case, and Sales Associate Cosmo Eisele. Come cheer for\
  \ (or against) your favorite Paizonians as they try to keep their characters alive\
  \ despite the merciless machinations of Jason's GMing!</p> \n    <p>As PaizoCon\
  \ winds down on Monday morning, we will again have the entire Design team at the\
  \ delve tables from 9:00 AM-11:00 AM, followed by a Playtest Feedback seminar where\
  \ they will discuss how the Playtest events went over during the PaizoCon weekend.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, sprinkled throughout the convention, longer-form games with\
  \ the Playtest rules will be run. Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton, Editor\
  \ Leo Glass, Developer Chris Sims, Developer Linda Zayas-Palmer, and Editor Lyz\
  \ Liddell will all be offering chances to play The Rose Street Revenge, a series\
  \ of Playtest quests that will only be at PaizoCon, Origins, PaizoCon UK, and Gen\
  \ Con until its official release date on August 6.</p> \n    <p>Managing Developer\
  \ and master of RPG horror Amanda Hamon Kunz has prepared a special Playtest conversion\
  \ of the classic Pathfinder module Gallows of Madness. Designer Logan Bonner will\
  \ be offering an Osiriani Playtest adventure The House of Ekmendi and Designer Mark\
  \ Seifter will be running a classic social intrigue adventure, Bid for Alabastrine,\
  \ with Playtest rules. Finally, Developer Ron Lundeen has converted an adventure\
  \ he authored, A Lucky Morning from Run Amok Games, to playtest rules.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>These special opportunities to experience the new Playtest rules will all\
  \ be in the PaizoCon event lottery. A number of our games are in high demand with\
  \ only a few seats available in each game. The lottery is a way for attendees to\
  \ get an equal shot at the the games they are most excited about. Once events are\
  \ published on the site, attendees can rank preferences for events. We'll then run\
  \ our lottery code and place attendees into events. Once that has been determined,\
  \ we'll open up the general events (seminars, organized play, etc) for general registration\
  \ and event trading. The preferences and lottery selection will be happening at\
  \ the beginning of May—<a href=\"/paizocon\">be sure you've got your 4-day badge</a>\
