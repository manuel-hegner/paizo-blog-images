  artist: "arachnophobia, but in the end we are trying to do less spider stuff. But\
    \ it's hard to say no to something like the cutlass spider, one of four new monsters\
    \ appearing in Pathfinder #15's Bestiary. And even though we have a lot of drow\
    \ in this month's adventure, the cutlass spider's not actually a drow creation.\
    \ It's actually a construct that often sees use on pirate ships and other nautical\
    \ locations, where they serve as guardians, bodyguards, or even assassins. One\
    \ of the most interesting things about them, though, is that they can add magic\
    \ weapons to their bodies, and in so doing gain the properties of that magic weapon\
    \ to their natural attacks. A cutlass spider that snatches a vorpal sword would\
    \ be a menace indeed. And guess what happens if a cutlass spider absorbs an intelligent\
    \ weapon in this manner? In any event, for those of you who are growing tired\
    \ of spider monsters, I apologize. As it turns out, spiders are just too awesome\
    \ a source of monster inspiration to resist for long! James Jacobs Pathfinder\
    \ Editor-in-Chief"
