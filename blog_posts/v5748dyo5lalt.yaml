  \ with The Ship of Ishtar</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, November 2, 2009</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This week we released the newest Planet Stories book, <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy85jx\"\
  ><i>The Ship of Ishtar</i></a>, by A. Merritt. Not only is this my personal favorite\
  \ of the 22 books we have released since the launch of <a href=\"/planetstories\"\
  > Planet Stories</a> about a year and a half ago, but it's also an interesting look\
  \ at the Planet Stories process, and how in many ways we here in the office are\
  \ learning just as much about the history of the most important early authors and\
  \ books in the science fiction and fantasy fields as our readers are.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>I often received letters of thanks form Planet Stories readers for introducing\
  \ them to authors like Leigh Brackett, C. L. Moore, or Henry Kuttner. Most of these\
  \ authors began their careers in the 1930s and early 1940s, publishing their stories\
  \ in the pre-war pulp magazines like the original <i>Planet Stories</i>, <i>Startling\
  \ Stories</i>, <i>Thrilling Wonder Stories</i>, and similar magazines.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>In order to locate and restore the oldest, most complete texts of the tales\
  \ we've published so far, I have accumulated a respectable selection of pulp magazines.\
  \ One of my absolute favorites was called <i>Famous Fantastic Mysteries</i>. Along\
  \ with its sister magazine, <i>Fantastic Novels</i>, editor Mary Gnaedinger culled\
  \ the vast archives of the Munsey Magazines (primarily <i>Argosy</i> and <i>All-Story</i>\
  \ in their various forms and spin-offs), collecting the best fantastic material\
  \ for affordable reprints. In some ways <i>FFM</i> was the \"original\" version\
  \ of our Planet Stories book line, only in this case they reprinted work from the\
  \ first three decades of the twentieth century almost exclusively.</p> \n    <p>Two\
  \ things strike me as fascinating about these magazines beyond the actual stories\
  \ they contained (many of which were brilliant) and the fact that a woman was setting\
  \ the original \"canon\" of science fiction and fantasy in an era when many other\
  \ women had to hide behind pseudonyms to get their work published at all. Beyond\
  \ those two substantive issues, the things I find most fascinating about these magazines\
  \ are the art, and the reader letter column.</p> \n    <p>The art stands out particularly\
  \ because most of it (especially early on) came from the peerless pen of Virgil\
  \ Finlay, for my money the finest illustrator ever to work in the pulp field and\
  \ one of the greatest American illustrators of all time, period. Finlay's distinctive\
  \ scratchboard style, fine figure work, and juxtaposition of light and dark tones\
  \ is breathtaking more than six decades after it was originally commissioned, and\
  \ his work brings a continuity to the canon of <i>Famous Fantastic Mysteries</i>\
  \ that might otherwise have been less clear, different as the stories published\
  \ in the magazine may have been. Many of Finlay's works have been reprinted over\
  \ the years (and a Google image search will turn up hundreds more), but like the\
  \ authors whose work he illustrated, he was amazingly prolific. Many of his illustrations\
  \ appear only in their original pulp form, so opening a \"new\" issue of <i>FFM</i>\
  \ rescued from a used book or magazine shop can often feel like digging for visual\
  \ treasure.</p> \n    <p>Beyond the stories and illustrations, tacked onto the ends\
  \ of the magazines and presented in tiny type, came the letters to the editor, often\
  \ dozens at a time. In the course of praising or criticizing a given issue's content,\
  \ these letters often include praise of authors and stories that are nearly forgotten\
  \ today. How many readers other than the most dedicated literary archeologists know\
  \ much about authors like E. Charles Vivian or Charles B. Stilson? Beyond <i>King\
  \ Solomon's Mines</i> and perhaps <i>She</i>, who can name the titles of further\
  \ adventures of H. Rider Haggard's character Allan Quatermain or the dozens of other\
  \ high-adventure fantasy novels he wrote in the late nineteenth century? <i>FFM</i>\
  \ published many of them, and the letter columns are filled to bursting with suggestions\
  \ on even more minor or forgotten works that were fading into obscurity (rightly\
  \ or wrongly) more than 60 years ago. Of course, even back then, fantasy fans could\
  \ agree on very few things.</p> \n    <p>One thing almost everyone seemed to agree\
  \ on, however, was the overwhelming quality and beauty of language in the works\
  \ of A. Merritt, particularly his groundbreaking fantasy <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy85jx\"\
  ><i>The Ship of Ishtar</i></a>.</p> \n    <p>Merritt's influential 1919 novel <i>The\
  \ Moon Pool</i> has been in print more or less consistently since it was first published,\
  \ and it was one of several stories in the very first issue of <i>Famous Fantastic\
  \ Mysteries</i> that solidified the magazine as a major success that would last\
  \ more than a decade (not bad for a pulp focused almost exclusively on reprints!).\
  \ He was a major stylistic influence on authors like H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton\
  \ Smith, C. L. Moore, and Henry Kuttner.</p> \n    <p>Prior to coming across praise\
  \ for his works in the letter pages of <i>FFM</i>, I'd never really heard of him.\
  \ I came to Lovecraft decades ago, and in subsequent works by the above-named authors\
  \ I always identified the florid, lush description as particularly Lovecraftian.\
  \ In fact, Lovecraft was a great admirer of Merritt, and it's clear that Merritt's\
  \ style was a huge influence upon him.</p> \n    <p>Listen to what HPL said about\
  \ Merritt in a letter to a friend, praising the Merritt novel <i>The Metal Monster</i>:\
  \ \"[Merritt] has a peculiar power of working up an atmosphere and investing a region\
  \ with an aura of unholy dread... the most remarkable presentation of the utterly\
  \ alien and non-human that I have ever seen. Merritt is certainly great stuffâ€”he\
  \ has a subtle command of an unique type of strangeness which no one else has been\
  \ able to parallel.\"</p> \n    <p>In the early 20th century, Merritt was considered,\
  \ if not the most popular fantasist (that honor probably goes to Edgar Rice Burroughs),\
  \ certainly among the top two or three fantasy authors in America. A journalist\
  \ by trade, Merritt edited the prestigious <i>American Weekly</i> for Willian Randolph\
  \ Hearst, and was one of the best-paid journalists in the world, bringing in an\
  \ annual salary of $100,000 at the time of his death in 1943.</p> \n    <p>His busy\
  \ career left him relatively little time for fiction writing, limiting his output\
  \ to fewer than a dozen novels and about the same number of short stories. All are\
  \ infused with powerful, vivid imagery, an unparalleled sense of place, and unforgettable\
  \ characters.</p> \n    <p>This month's Planet Stories release, <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy85jx\"\
  ><i>The Ship of Ishtar</i></a>, is considered by most critics the finest of Merritt's\
  \ masterworks, a precursor of the sword and sorcery genre that would come to inform\
  \ the birth of fantasy roleplaying, and one of the most important fantasy novels\
  \ of the early twentieth century. Merritt was the late Gary Gygax's favorite writer,\
  \ and up until the month of Gary's recent death, he kept pushing me to publish some\
  \ of his works. I wish Gary could have survived to see us get to <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy85jx\"\
  ><i>The Ship of Ishtar</i></a>, but I know he would have been happy to have one\
  \ of his favorite tales presented to the audience of fantasy enthusiasts he helped\
  \ to create and maintain.</p> \n    <p>The Planet Stories edition of <a href=\"\
  /planetStories/v5748btpy85jx\"><i>The Ship of Ishtar</i></a> features Merritt's\
  \ complete, preferred text for the first time in more than 60 years. It also includes\
  \ 10 beautiful prints by Merritt's favorite artist and friend, Virgil Finlay, collected\
  \ into a single volume for the first time ever. Prominent modern author Tim Powers\
  \ provides a compelling introduction, and the book comes wrapped in a beautiful,\
  \ pulpy cover by artist Kieran Yanner.</p> \n    <div align=\"center\">\n     <table\
