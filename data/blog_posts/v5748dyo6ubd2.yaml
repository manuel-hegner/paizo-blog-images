  \ <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">It is with a heavy heart that\
  \ Paizo announces the passing of longtime software developer Gary Teter. Gary was\
  \ a pioneer in the development of the Paizo website and its core behind-the-scenes\
  \ software systems that have helped to deliver Pathfinder and Starfinder products\
  \ for more than 20 years. He was integral in the creation of our subscription programs,\
  \ forums, and more–all at a time when such technology didn’t exist.</p>\n      <p>Our\
  \ hearts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>We’ve asked the Paizo team to share their thoughts below, and we encourage\
  \ members of the community to do the same.</p>\n      <p>Thanks again for all your\
  \ hard work to make Paizo the success it is today, Gary. You will be missed.</p>\n\

  \  <br>\n      <p>Gary Teter came to Paizo way back in 2004 at a pivotal point in\
  \ the company’s history. We started off as a magazine company, and the process of\
  \ inputting subscriptions and renewals was eating up the small profit that magazines\
  \ made back then, so we decided to try to do it through a website. But this was\
  \ in 2004, and there just weren’t any website options you could purchase, so we\
  \ considered building it ourselves, which was a daunting task.</p>\n      <p>Gary\
  \ was brought in as we were struggling to figure out what to do. He brought vision\
  \ and hard work to the table, and lo and behold, we launched paizo.com and brought\
  \ subscriptions online. Once the magazines went away, that same subscription service\
  \ morphed into one of the financial backbones of the company. I’m not sure Paizo\
  \ would be here today if Gary hadn’t started working for us. Since then, he kept\
  \ the machine going for twenty years!</p>\n      <p>Gary also brought a sense of\
  \ humor to Paizo. Remember “Talk Like a Pirate Day,” when Gary made it so everything\
  \ you posted turned into pirate language? Or the secret Smurf thing where your avatar\
  \ changed into a Smurf whenever you mentioned them in a post? That was Gary.</p>\n\
  \      <p>I loved working with Gary during those early years of paizo.com. The website\
  \ was a blank page, and we could dream about what we wanted it to be. Some things\
  \ were instant successes, like side carts. Others were left on the cutting room\
  \ floor (I’m looking at you, Paizooties). But through it all, Gary had a love for\
  \ the customer and did his best to make their experience on paizo.com a great one.\
  \ He would spend late nights trying to shave off shipping costs just to save folks\
  \ a little more money.</p>\n      <p>Gary will be missed at Paizo.</p>\n      <p\
  \ style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;\">Lisa Stevens<br><em>CEO</em><br></p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <p>Gary Teter was never among the most well-known employees at\
  \ Paizo, but if you’ve ever interacted with paizo.com in any way, you’ve felt his\
  \ influence. And if you’ve ever noticed some feature here that no other website\
  \ has, Gary almost certainly played a major role in creating it.</p>\n      <p>Gary\
  \ was Paizo’s third-longest tenured employee, after Erik Mona and James Jacobs.\
  \ Paizo’s original webmaster, Rob Head, hired Gary in March 2004, while Paizo was\
  \ still just publishing magazines.</p>\n      <p>When we hired him, paizo.com was\
  \ mainly a collection of static pages, one for each of our magazines, plus a sidebar\
  \ for brief news updates. You could subscribe, purchase back issues, and not much\
  \ else. Twenty years ago, Gary was working furiously on changing that, adding message\
  \ boards in August, and launching a real web store offering thousands of gaming\
  \ products in November. While the site has evolved over the years, the paizo.com\
  \ you know today is still built on the foundations Gary and Rob created two decades\
  \ ago.</p>\n      <p>But as important as Gary’s contributions to the website were,\
  \ his role in shaping the paizo.com community was in many ways even more impactful.\
  \ With the launch of the message boards, Gary took on the role of “PostMonster General,”\
  \ acting not just as the community’s first moderator, but helping to set the tone\
  \ for all interactions on paizo.com.</p>\n      <p>Gary was serious about his work\
  \ and always interested in the ways that evolving technology could be used, from\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2h5ok?The-Loaf-Question\">utterly confusing\
  \ construction that is ents and loaves</a> to <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43srn?Using-a-chatbot-to-design-a-mystery-game\"\
  >using a chatbot to turn an ordinary deck of cards into a mystery game to play with\
  \ his son</a>.</p>\n      <p>Gary strongly believed in doing things the right way\
  \ with a customer-first attitude. Whenever I would approach him with a complicated\
  \ idea that I thought our customers would appreciate, he would explain the inherent\
  \ difficulties that kept every other website from doing it, and then he’d figure\
  \ out how to make it happen, and he’d usually do it quickly and do it well.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Gary also always approached things with humor. He once demonstrated a\
  \ new feature in our back-end software to our sales manager, who flippantly complained\
  \ that it had one flaw: not enough pancake bunnies (referencing a then-current meme\
  \ involving a Japanese rabbit known for balancing baked goods on its head). So Gary\
  \ added “Pancake Bunny Mode” to the tool, in which lines of animated rabbits loaded\
  \ up with syrupy goodness marched across the screen—a feature that you could toggle\
  \ on or off… unless you were the sales manager, in which case there was no off switch.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Gary was occasionally courted by companies that offered him much more\
  \ money that Paizo ever could, but he genuinely loved paizo.com and the paizo.com\
  \ community, and he told me several times over the years that he never wanted to\
  \ work anywhere other than Paizo for the rest of his life. Gary’s contributions\
  \ to Paizo were foundational and crucial, and I’m greatly saddened that he won’\
  t be here to help guide paizo.com into its third decade.</p>\n      <p style=\"\
  margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;\">Vic Wertz,<br><em>Chief\
  \ Technical Officer (Retired)</em><br></p>\n      <br>\n      <p>I remember the\
  \ change that crept through Paizo after Gary came aboard so many years ago. From\
  \ over in the editorial department, his influence was subtle at first, but then\
  \ Smurfs started showing up on the message boards. To me, those little blue gremlins\
  \ were probably the most visual (and unexpected) of the manifestations of the glory\
  \ that was Gary. But beyond the boards and the machinery of the virtual world, Gary\
  \ was someone I always felt welcome to chat with, be it a happenstance greeting\
  \ in a breakroom that developed into a full-on conversation, a discussion at a work\
  \ gathering about the intersection of internet and gamer culture, sharing quirky\
  \ cat-themed anecdotes, or just some good old reminiscing about the early days of\
  \ Paizo. His presence in the very early Paizo chat rooms was always welcome and\
  \ comforting, as was his sense of humor. He put humanity into Paizo’s infrastructure\
  \ in ways I expect I’ll still be discovering, marveling at, and appreciating for\
  \ years to come. I’ll miss you, my friend.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\

  \      <br>\n      <p>I first met Gary, like many who interacted with him, online.\
  \ I first found my way to this community through the message boards, and Gary was\
  \ the guy running the show back then. He had an interesting way of moderating conversations\
  \ and keeping the community entertained and on point. It was this community and\
  \ the people in it that led me to freelancing, and though it sounds weird for someone\
  \ in the tech side of the company being responsible for a word jockey starting his\
  \ career, that’s the case. Gary was not only fun to chat with, he was also supportive.\
  \ In the way-back times, a few of us started a chat room that served as a somewhat\
  \ real-time version of the message boards where regulars would hang out and keep\
  \ up with each other. I was in that chat room all the time and so was Gary, who\
  \ was the first Paizo staffer we asked to join. It was in that chat room where I\
  \ really got to know Gary. From the Smurf “prank” to the odd threads and experiments\
  \ that went way over my head, Gary was always up to something interesting, and I\
  \ swear, half the time you could see the twinkle in his eye even through text. When\
  \ I finally joined the company and moved out here, it was nice seeing a familiar\
  \ face in the office that was outside of my immediate department. We even lived\
  \ in the same apartment complex, so I’d see him around outside of work too. Gary\
  \ was a delightfully strange man, with a head full of concepts, ideas, and plans\
  \ that I couldn’t even fathom with my puny word-focused brain. So, thank you for\
  \ all the education and entertainment. We’ll miss you, Gary!</p>\n      <p style=\"\

  \      <br>\n      <p>Gary Teter was a passionate developer with a soft spot for\
  \ retro hardware and clicky keyboards. When we were still in a physical office,\
  \ it wasn't unusual to see Gary rolling by my window atop his Solowheel on his way\
  \ home at the end of the day. Once we all started working remotely, Gary lamented\
  \ the loss of the day-to-day impromptu conversations that would happen just by virtue\
  \ of having desks near each other. Those conversations could be about anything from\
  \ how we might solve a particular technical challenge to why we didn't have more\
  \ (or any) pneumatic tubes in the office.</p>\n      <p>Professionally, Gary loved\
  \ solving complex or tricky problems and took great delight in a satisfying solution.\
  \ He made a lasting impact with his creativity and dedication to his work. I especially\
  \ appreciated the sense of whimsy he injected into our daily conversations and many\
  \ of the things he did. His depth of knowledge and creative ideas will be missed.\
  \ He was a one-of-a-kind personality who will always be remembered at Paizo.</p>\n\
  \      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;\">Rei\
  \ Ko<br><em>Vice President of Technology</em><br></p>\n      <p>It's difficult to\
  \ share memories of a coworker and feel like you did them justice. Working together\
  \ is such a specific context that you can spend years with someone and never feel\
  \ like you got the full picture of who they truly were. So I will resist the urge\
  \ to lay out some sort of comprehensive, definitive statement on Gary Teter. I’\
  m not qualified to do that. I will simply tell what I can, in the hopes that others\
  \ will fill in the gaps in my telling to form a more complete picture.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>Gary was a wizard. If you told him you needed something built, he would go\
  \ read the book on that thing and come back having built it. He would build his\
  \ own tooling so he could have exactly what he needed to get his job done. He would\
  \ cast magic with code.</p>\n      <p>Gary was one of the most customer-oriented\
  \ colleagues I've ever worked with. Regardless of the other factors in play, he\
  \ was always deeply grateful to the people who purchased Paizo products—the people\
  \ who enable so many of us at the company to do what we love for a living. Every\
  \ feature he implemented had an eye towards surprising and delighting customers,\
  \ as well as treating them fairly and honestly, whether they found out about it\
  \ or not. It was a matter of personal principle. He couldn't <em>not</em> do that.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Gary believed that learning was a lifelong process. Twenty years into\
  \ working on the code-base for Paizo, he was still researching new algorithms, frameworks,\
  \ and techniques—either for use on the job or just for fun. He always had a handful\
  \ of pet projects at home to work on after he'd signed off for the day: an audiophile\
  \ amplifier here, a spectrum analyzer there. A few years prior to the pandemic he\
  \ learned to ride an electric monowheel because, in his own words, \"I just decided\
  \ that I wanted to be the kind of person who could ride a wheel, mostly because\
  \ it looked awesome, and I’ve always thought that sort of thing would be impossible\
  \ for me, and that it was time I let go of preconceived notions about what I could\
  \ and couldn’t do.\"</p>\n      <p>Gary was a trailblazer. If you needed to get\
  \ 30 people from <em>here</em> to <em>there</em> across all manner of difficult\
  \ terrain, he’d figure out the exact route to take. Perhaps someone else would have\
  \ to arrange the provisions, and another person would need to load and balance the\
  \ wagons, and a third person would keep the caravan together along the way. But\
  \ the path itself? The guy with the machete hacking through the underbrush 50 yards\
  \ ahead, shouting back, \"It's this way!\"? That was all Gary. It wasn't until I\
  \ reached the end of this paragraph that I realized that there's another name for\
  \ that person:</p>\n      <p>Gary was a Pathfinder. And now he's gone.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>And Paizo is the lesser for it.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
  \ font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;\">Brian Bauman<br><em>Software Architect</em><br></p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <p>Gary was one of the first people I spoke to on my first day\
  \ at Paizo, and I distinctly remember thinking, “Oh, right, I work in the TTRPG\
  \ industry now. Of course I’ll be working next to a bespectacled, bearded ponytailed\
  \ guy named Gary with an esoteric sense of humor.”</p>\n      <p>That was only my\
  \ first impression, of course; over the next six years, he made countless others.\
  \ He was an old-school geek who embodied the absolute best of classic <a href=\"\
  https://idlewords.com/2007/04/the_alameda_weehawken_burrito_tunnel.htm\">weird</a>\
  \ online and programmer culture. He was the owner of a desk that resembled the Iron\
  \ Throne if it had been built from 20 years of Paizo products. He was the guy in\
  \ our weekly Zoom meetings who always had a wall of oscilloscopes or something that\
  \ looked like a half-built robot on a workbench behind him somewhere. And, like\
  \ others have said, he was an incredibly smart and talented coder who cared tremendously\
  \ about his work and what it meant to the Pathfinder and Starfinder communities.\
  \ It didn’t matter whether he was working on code to save customers money by shipping\
  \ in as few packages as possible, an uncheatable die roller for the play-by-post\
  \ boards, banishing spambots to an endless Sartre-esque digital labyrinth, or some\
  \ shamelessly goofy forum feature; he approached every projects with the same level\
  \ of deadly seriousness and took enormous pride in ensuring that it was done right,\
  \ no matter how ridiculous it was.</p>\n      <p>It's hard to imagine a paizo.com\
  \ without Gary and his contributions, and his passing will leave a tremendous void\
  \ not only on Paizo’s tech team, but in the company as a whole. My heart goes out\
  \ to his family and loved ones, and I am proud and grateful to have had the opportunity\
  \ to work with him for as long as I did.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
