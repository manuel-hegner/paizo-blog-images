  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Is there a more elegant way\
  \ to title this post? Probably, but this is the most direct.</p> \n     <p>Hey there,\
  \ my name is Fred Van Lente, and I’m thrilled to join the Paizo community by writing\
  \ the <b>Pathfinder: Fumbus</b> one-shot comic book currently (or about to be)<a\
  \ href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dynamiteent/pathfinder-fumbus?ref=project_link\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"> Kickstarted</a>. I’m best known for writing comics like <b>Amazing\
  \ Spider-Man</b>, <b>Marvel Zombies</b>, <b>Archer &amp; Armstrong</b>, <b>Cowboys\
  \ &amp; Aliens</b>, <b>Action Philosophers</b> (<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eviltwinco/action-philosophers-vol-1-hooked-on-classics\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">currently in a Kickstarter for a color version itself</a>),\
  \ but my very first published book was an RPG supplement for <b>Call of Cthulhu</b>,\
  \ <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4449292-the-new-orleans-guidebook\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">The New Orleans Guidebook</a>, so it’s been very cool to come\
  \ back to my roleplaying roots. </p> \n     <p>I am a pretty avid TTRPGer myself.\
  \ I’ve got a monthly game I run and I’m in a weekly group where we rotate the games\
  \ and gamemastering duties. (Both currently Zoom-based, alas.) <b>Pathfinder</b>\
  \ is one of the systems I’ve most enjoyed playing; in this photo I am with Rhys,\
  \ my sea elf druid who made it to 7th level in the <b>Skulls &amp; Shackles</b>\
  \ campaign. This watercolor I’m holding was painted by my fellow player and accomplished\
  \ cartoonist, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/worldwidecox/?hl=en\">Alex Cox</a>.\
  \ Hey Paizo, you ever need another iconic druid, I submit this handsome lad for\
  \ your approval. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/99082417-7e18-4877-abbc-544a13beb034/041421_FVLWithPathfinderPC.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>We also ran <b>We Be Goblins!</b> in my\
  \ weekly group (I was Chuffy Lickwound, whose face might make you sick, but whose\
  \ knife is awful quick) so it was cool to bring to life Fumbus, everyone’s favorite\
  \ goblin alchemist, in a new adventure that is the next installment of the long-running\
  \ Pathfinder comics series—but you don’t need to be familiar with the previous adventures\
  \ of Seoni, Merisiel, Valeros and friends to enjoy this one. And in addition to\
  \ the graphic novella itself, there’s a lot of neat new playable goodies* in the\
  \ back of the book for all your goblin alchemy needs. </p> \n     <p>So, if that\
  \ sounds like something you’d be into, head over to the Kickstarter campaign and\
  \ pledge! And once again, happy to be here—thanks for having me. </p> \n     <p>*Character\
  \ options in Pathfinder: Fumbus were made by Paizo and are pre-approved for use\
  \ with the Pathfinder Society Organized Play program!</p> \n     <center> \n   \
