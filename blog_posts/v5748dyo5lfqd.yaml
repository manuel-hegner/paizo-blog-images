  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Chris Willrich</p> \n    <h2>Chapter 3: The Unexpected\
  \ Assassin</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">Old Cassomir was like a stately anchorage of petrified ships, and\
  \ in the case of Madame Velm's domain, one strewn with harbor lights.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Gull, Corvine, Thea, and Nicolaus presented their invitations first\
  \ to the constables, then the navy officers, then the manor guards, and finally\
  \ the doorman. The doorman proved the most difficult.</p> \n     <p>The man, a thick-built\
  \ but by no means thick-headed Taldan, was by his accent from Zimar and the Qadiran\
  \ frontier. Luckily he was new to Velm's service and unacquainted with Gull, but\
  \ he frowned at Gull's invitation. \"Seems to me I've heard you sing, Mr. ‘Alaric\
  \ Reynard.' The harp looks the same, but seems to me you looked different then.\
  \ Younger. Healthier.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Perhaps I have degenerated some...\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Degenerated. <i>De-gen-er-ate</i>. Sounds like a word a <i>Chelaxian</i>\
  \ would use. You Chelish? A Chelish sympathizer?\"</p> \n     <p>The objection that\
  \ he was a free man of Andoran rose to Gull's lips. It was Corvine who saved him\
  \ from such a foolish declaration. She glared at the doorman. \"Are you a Chelish\
  \ inquisitor, to speak thus to my partner?\" She linked arms with Gull, squeezed\
  \ his hand.</p> \n     <p>The doorman blinked, though his face remained stern. \"\
  My apologies, Madame Gale.\"</p> \n     <p>The musicians entered the mansion, Gull\
  \ whispering to Corvine, \"Thanks.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Don't mention it. And don't\
  \ rely too much on that cloak of yours. It doesn't seem to work on everyone.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Agreed. Those of mighty spirit seem able to resist.\"</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ blinked at that, as though turning the remark this way and that to discover the\
  \ hidden insult.</p> \n     <p>Inside they got a glimpse of the powers of Cassomir.\
  \ There was Governor Bozbeyli, gray-bearded and stout, holding forth on the promise\
  \ of magical mechanization, bearing a war-trophy scimitar where weapons were otherwise\
  \ forbidden. There was Admiral Kasaba, frowning in obvious impatience at all the\
  \ fuss, in her dress uniform the plainest woman among the mighty, and, despite these\
  \ things—or perhaps because of them—a striking presence to Gull.</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ was the high priest of Gozreh beside Madame Velm, white beard beside black crown\
  \ of hair, silken sea-green robe beside shimmering evening-blue gown. The first\
  \ had tried to convince Gull to set aside the crude worship of Erastil for the fickle\
  \ benefits of the god of ocean and weather. The second had seen Gull as a project,\
  \ a gem to be cut, before disgustedly tossing him aside.</p> \n     <p>He turned\
  \ away from the mighty. Household staff steered his group from the party proper\
  \ toward an unobtrusive passage and the narrow hallways and rooms beyond. While\
  \ not secret, these servants' domains were easily ignored by the family and guests.\
  \ It was clear to Gull this was not to be his party.</p> \n     <p>He looked around\
  \ for signs of trouble but saw nothing.</p> \n     <p>And why should he? The true\
  \ assassin was dead, and since Gull had no intention of harming Admiral Kasaba,\
  \ why, surely all would be well.</p> \n     <p>Except that by morning Mortil would\
  \ know he was a fake. Soon enough Gull would meet a Chelish killer again, and this\
  \ one wouldn't be conveniently dead.</p> \n     <p>As Thea and Alaric located the\
  \ free food (an important skill for musicians), Gull and Corvine claimed their waiting\
  \ spot beside the garden, where statues of heroes embellished a stone veranda. They\
  \ stood beside the visage of Sir Gothmoor, shown carrying the head of the enchanted\
  \ Knight of the Pit, who according to legend had cheerfully continued talking after\
  \ Sir Gothmoor beheaded him, and whose advice proved surprisingly helpful on subsequent\
  \ quests. Gull rubbed his neck as he regarded the Knight of the Pit's fey smile.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"All right, Gideon,\" Corvine said, \"I think we can talk. I asked\
  \ around. There were indeed sightings of a man in a purple cloak. The sightings\
  \ today all match your story. But the sightings last night had him fighting a group\
  \ of corsairs at the shipyards. They said the man fell into the harbor with a knife\
  \ in his back.\"</p> \n     <p>Gull felt the rip in the back of the cloak. \"That\
  \ fits.\"</p> \n     <p>She shook her head. \"What have you gotten yourself into?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"The sort of thing a bard gets into.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're no\
  \ bard, Gideon.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Perhaps I will be yet. A little fisticuffs, a\
  \ little swordplay, a little magic—these seem achievable talents, just now.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"It's that cloak. It will get you killed.\"</p> \n     <p>\"No. I have\
  \ a plan.\"</p> \n     <p>\"This ought to be good.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I will seek\
  \ a new patron tonight, and thereby find security.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Just like that?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"With this cloak I can do it. I feel it.\"</p> \n     <p>Her eyes\
  \ searched the garden's topiary as if the green animals could offer up auguries.\
  \ \"It's a false confidence, Gideon. It will betray you, and you'll be back in the\
  \ Dog's Teeth.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Amazing. You broke off what we had because I failed\
  \ to rise as a singer—\"</p> \n     <p>\"That's not—\"</p> \n     <p>\"And now that\
  \ I have a new chance, you want to reject that too.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Gideon—\"\
  </p> \n     <p>But the call came for the quartet, and there was no time for argument.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There was indeed a giant cake, and there was Admiral Kasaba beside it,\
  \ her stern face registering resigned patience. She brightened a little as the quartet\
  \ performed.</p> \n     <p>Gull struggled to pull his weight. It was not that he\
  \ lacked skill with voice and harp; rather he lacked formal training in this sort\
  \ of music, as well as the practical experience that might compensate for such a\
  \ deficiency.</p> \n     <p>He forced himself to smile. A frown could poison a perfect\
  \ performance—and this was not going to be perfect.</p> \n     <p><i>Happy happy\
  \ (la la la) happy birthday (la la) birthday birthday (la)...</i></p> \n     <p>And\
  \ yet, where in the past an icy winter of fear might freeze his throat and stiffen\
  \ his fingers, a spring returned to his voice and his joints, and he was at least\
  \ able to carry his part. The audience clapped and even the admiral looked pleased.\
  \ No one jumped out of the cake (and that seemed just as well to Gull, for Kasaba's\
  \ earlier glares looked sharp enough to cut rope) and the group was briefly free\
  \ to mingle with the elite.</p> \n     <p>\"Bravo,\" said Admiral Kasaba. She squinted\
  \ at Gull. \"Have I seen you before?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I have sung here and there.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I hope we'll hear more of you. And your companions, of course.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>And Gull understood. The listeners had been unaware of Gull's struggle;\
  \ from their point of view <i>he</i> was the strongest singer, because of the effect\
  \ of the cloak.</p> \n     <p>It was unfair. And yet... why should he not enjoy\
  \ their mistake? Having sold himself through magic, he would apply the hard work\
  \ necessary to make good on the deal. Was that really so dishonest?</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ abandoned any thought of the satirical song they'd discussed at Corvine's. He\
  \ gave Alaric's harp into Nicolaus's keeping and commenced weaving in and out of\
  \ conversations, collecting promises of future performances, encounters that could\
  \ secure patronage. At first he avoided individuals he'd met before, but he needn't\
  \ have worried. Even Madame Velm seemed to consider him somebody new. Everywhere\
  \ he left some witticism gleaned from unwritten songs, and was greeted with rapt\
  \ attention.</p> \n     <p>\"<i>Common sense can't be that common. It's mainly brought\
  \ up when people are accused of lacking it</i>.\"</p> \n     <p>\"<i>People talk\
  \ about being fat and happy as if that were a bad thing. I'd like to try it, just\
  \ to make sure</i>.\"</p> \n     <p>\"<i>You live long enough, everything's a phase.\
  \ Live a little longer, life looks like a phase, too</i>.\"</p> \n     <p>However,\
  \ even with the cloak there was an ebb and flow to the party, and as desserts vanished\
  \ and drinks took their place, Gull began getting hints the powerful wished to keep\
  \ their own company. He found himself alone in a corner among gilded eggs on display,\
  \ counting his unhatched chickens.</p> \n     <p>Corvine reappeared. She actually\
  \ seemed a trifle shy.</p> \n     <p>\"I...\" she began.</p> \n     <p>\"Yes. It's\
  \ okay. Say something.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You were wrong.\"</p> \n     <p>That was\
  \ not exactly what he'd been hoping for. He tried to sound unconcerned. \"I'm shocked.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I didn't break it off because you were failing to rise. Do you\
  \ have any idea how many good musicians never get anywhere? Even among bards—\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Don't.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I just need you to know. I always respected\
  \ you. Except when you were trying to be someone else.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You mean,\
  \ sophisticated. Charming. Witty. The things the nobility appreciate. What I was\
  \ finally managing to do, just now.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I liked my blunt Andoren man,\"\
  \ she said, \"who wasn't afraid of anyone, high or low.\" She leaned in closer,\
  \ touching his face, as if reading the music written in his weathered face. \"Except,\
  \ you were afraid, weren't you? Down deep, where no one could see. Afraid of not\
  \ measuring up.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Not anymore.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I wanted you to\
  \ read this.\" She passed him a scrap of paper filled with words, and also strikes\
  \ and smudges and second thoughts. \"I don't have the music yet. Something I've\
  \ been working on.\"</p> \n     <p>He read it.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>Spilled\
  \ Ink</i></p> \n      <p><i>I dressed your name in inkwell silks</i><br> <i>And\
  \ curled it slow through the dance of hand and pen</i><br> <i>To the wild corners\
  \ of the page and back again</i><br> <i>Dancing dark, shadow-whisper, marked for\
  \ crumpling.</i><br> <i>What if I'd rolled it out, banquet-carpet, banner unfolding?</i><br>\
  \ <i>Would you have divined the grace that runs</i><br> <i>From hand to pen to eye,\
  \ from me to you?</i><br> <i>Or would words and grace have drowned together in your\
  \ eye—</i><br> <i>Spilled ink, black oil, a blot on white water.</i><br> <i>A voice\
  \ dams up behind a quiet smile.</i><br> <i>A river swells to spill, dark and rapid\
  \ through the silent room</i><br> <i>Where I'd sing or swim, your hand in mind,</i><br>\
  \ <i>In the water-dance where voices break</i><br> <i>Crying ever over spilled and\
  \ unspilled ink.</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>He twisted the paper in\
  \ his hand.</p> \n     <p>\"What do you think?\"</p> \n     <p>The first thing that\
  \ came to his mind was not words. He wanted to take her hand. He wanted to kiss\
  \ her lips.</p> \n     <p>But something old and bitter rose within him, and it glittered\
  \ like the courts of Oppara and smelled of the Dog's Teeth.</p> \n     <p>\"It's...\
  \ precious.\"</p> \n     <p>She hesitated. \"Precious?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I mean,\
  \ its heart is in the right place but it's a little... adolescent, don't you think?\
  \ A trifle... twee?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh.\" She took the paper back. \"I see. Thank\
  \ you for looking at it.\"</p> \n     <p>He'd expected an angry waving of hands,\
  \ lashing like wild calligraphy. But her manner, her voice, was compact, withdrawn,\
  \ controlled. A blot of ink.</p> \n     <p>\"I mean—don't misunderstand—it's good...\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Don't.\" She turned and strode to where the servants were scavenging\
  \ the leftover desserts.</p> \n     <p>He stared after her, reaching out. His glib\
  \ remarks of the past half hour were like dead moths on his tongue.</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ shuffled toward the veranda.</p> \n     <p>\"Leaving so soon? You haven't tried\
  \ the cake.\" Gull glimpsed a servant with a tray veering in close.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I am not hungry...\" Gull began, and felt a dagger against his back.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Look at that,\" came the voice of the thug Eutharic, whom Gull had last heard\
  \ what seemed a thousand years ago this morning, outside the Knotty Mermaid. \"\
  There's even a rip here in the cloak, just right for a dagger. Guess it's an unlucky\
  \ bit of treasure. For you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Um, no need to be prickly.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"I got a message for you. From Tarik the Unclean.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Is\
  \ it really necessary to say Tarik <i>the Unclean</i>? It's not like I'm going to\
  \ confuse him with Tarik the Washerwoman, or Tarik the Singing Barber, or—\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Outside, Gull.\"</p> \n     <p>They stepped among the statues of heroes.\
  \ Eutharic herded Gull toward the statue of Sir Gothmoor. Gull wished the Knight\
  \ of the Pit's head would give him advice. \"What's the message?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  You know,\" Eutharic said, \"I got confused. The message isn't for you. The message\
  \ is you. Your bloody corpse at a fancy house, showing the whole city no one cheats\
  \ Tarik the Unclean—\"</p> \n     <p>\"There you go again.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Cheats\
  \ <i>Tarik the Unclean</i> of his salvage. They won't miss you, Gull. You're fooling\
  \ yourself with this lot. You're just another commodity. Plenty more where you came\
  \ from.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You might be right.\" Gull closed his hand on empty air\
  \ where verse had been. \"But you wouldn't be talking about this <i>message</i>\
  \ unless there was another option.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're right. There's stuff\
  \ going down with Cheliax, stuff you maybe know about, stuff Tarik might profit\
  \ from. I whistle, my pals Adamantius and Thok create a diversion, we get out of\
  \ here, you spill to Tarik.\"</p> \n     <p><i>Spilled ink</i>, Gull thought.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"So...\" came a new voice. \"It is as I thought.\"</p> \n     <p>It\
  \ was the governor's man—and Chelish agent—Mortil. He emerged from the veranda's\
  \ shadows and raised his hands in a way that instinctively made Gull as nervous\
  \ as if Mortil had raised an axe. He'd seen such poses from Corvine, after she'd\
  \ consulted certain books.</p> \n     <p>\"You have not sought the target,\" Mortil\
  \ said to Gull. \"Instead you have wasted your time on nonsensical activities—or\
  \ so I thought. But your true purpose was to sell your information to the highest\
  \ bidder. Disgusting.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Who's this guy?\" Eutharic said.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"I am your death,\" Mortil said, \"if you do not leave now.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Nobody talks to me like that.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Hey, that's right,\" Gull\
  \ said, \"you lose face like that, I might have to write a song...\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Eutharic lunged. It wasn't clear which—Gull or Mortil—he was seeking, especially\
  \ as Mortil immediately spoke some manner of trigger word and a blast of blue light\
  \ engulfed Gull's vision.</p> \n     <p>When he could see again, the Knight of the\
  \ Pit's head lay at his feet, freed from Sir Gothmoor's stony grip by an eldritch\
  \ blast. The same blast that had burned a hole through the chest cavity of the gaping\
  \ Eutharic.</p> \n     <p>The thug fell, smoking, and Mortil stepped forward. \"\
  I will say,\" he said thoughtfully, \"that I exposed enemy agents. It is true enough...\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"You!\" called a strident voice. \"Governor's man. Stand back from\
  \ that musician. He may be a spy—and a sorcerer it seems!\"</p> \n     <p>It was\
  \ Sebastian Tambour, stepping ahead of the astonished partygoers, a few of his fellow\
  \ corsairs close behind.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_SebastianTambour.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_SebastianTambour_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n      <br>Sebastian Tambour is first mate of the Happenstance.\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Mortil stepped back, chuckling at his good fortune.</p> \n     <p>Gull's\
  \ normal tactics in this sort of situation would be to stare, or plead, or duck,\
  \ or pray.</p> \n     <p>Instead, he did two things. With one hand he jabbed his\
  \ thumb toward the statue and shouted, \"Would I blast something <i>behind</i> me?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>With his other hand he hooked the Knight of the Pit's curly stone\
  \ hair and flung the bemused-looking boulder at Mortil.</p> \n     <p>The Chelish\
  \ agent swore—and the being sworn by had an address far removed from those of Taldor's\
  \ patron gods. Gull did not wait for the crowd's reaction, however, but dashed for\
  \ a servants' entrance and the kitchen.</p> \n     <p>At the door he paused only\
  \ to stick two fingers in his mouth and whistle.</p> \n     <p>Once inside he was\
  \ confronted by pots, pans, dangling meats, a brick oven big enough to roast two\
  \ boars, and a gaggle of scattering servants who'd probably already heard the shouted\
  \ word <i>sorcerer</i>. \"Boo,\" said Gull.</p> \n     <p>He was doomed, so he might\
  \ as well enjoy it.</p> \n     <p>Once alone in the kitchen he grabbed a large iron\
  \ skillet and crouched beside the door. It was Sebastian Tambour who entered first,\
  \ and Gull found it rather satisfying to swing something heavy at Tambour's head.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Alas, the corsair ducked sufficiently to be merely clipped. Tambour\
  \ rolled, snarling, into a bucket of fish heads.</p> \n     <p>\"I'm not a sorcerer!\"\
  \ Gull said. \"I'm not a wizard! I'm not a Chelish agent!\"</p> \n     <p>Tambour\
  \ swept fish guts from his eyes. \"Hit me again, Gideon Gull. That will make your\
  \ case more convincing.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Would a sorcerer use a skillet?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Tambour was up now, knife unsheathed. \"I might just believe you, Gull.\
  \ If you <i>are</i> a spy, you are perhaps the sloppiest, most ridiculous clandestine\
  \ agent I have ever seen.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's Mortil. I think he wants the admiral\
  \ dead. He thought I was working for Cheliax too. But you killed the real assassin,\
  \ didn't you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Perhaps...\" Tambour backed away with a calculating\
  \ look.</p> \n     <p>And Tambour's men grabbed Gull from behind.</p> \n     <p>Gull\
  \ did not resist. At this point, surrender was safer.</p> \n     <p><i>Thok</i>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Suddenly the men let go, slumping to the floor.</p> \n     <p>Gull turned\
  \ to see Eutharic's compatriots, Adamantius of the demonic tattoos and Thok of the\
  \ big stick.</p> \n     <p>\"Who killed Eutharic?\" snarled Adamantius.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Thok weeps,\" Thok said. Gull was startled. This was the first time he'd\
  \ ever heard of Thok saying anything.</p> \n     <p>\"It was not I,\" Tambour said.\
  \ \"Nor my men. I am beginning to believe it wasn't Gull.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Gull\
  \ could never kill Eutharic,\" scoffed Adamantius.</p> \n     <p>\"Gull is weak,\"\
  \ Thok said.</p> \n     <p>\"Hey...\" Gull began, and finished, \"that's right.\
  \ It was the governor's man, Mortil.\"</p> \n     <p>\"That knowledge,\" came Mortil's\
  \ voice, \"will die with you all.\"</p> \n     <p>Fire filled the doorway.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Adamantius and Thok screamed as an explosive magical blaze consumed them\
  \ and Tambour's fallen men. Gull and Tambour were barely able to take cover behind\
  \ a counter. An unused chicken on a hook burned above their heads like a comet of\
  \ culinary omen. The reek of roasted flesh made Gull gag.</p> \n     <p>\"And when\
  \ you are finished,\" Mortil said, \"so will the target burn. I may be implicated,\
  \ and that is regrettable. But in Hell my masters will laugh.\"</p> \n     <p>Wedges\
  \ of light erupted from Mortil's fingertips, and Gull heard a scream.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>He knew that voice. Corvine.</p> \n     <p>Gull scrambled around the counter,\
  \ skillet in hand, and Tambour was with him, dagger ready. Together they rushed\
  \ the wizard.</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>: The ultimate\
