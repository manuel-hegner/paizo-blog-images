  > \n    <p>Greetings, Pathfinders.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Today we'll\
  \ talk about some cards that are exclusive to the new <i>Iconic Heroes</i> miniatures\
  \ sets that hit stores at the end of this month, and a tasty new mechanic that comes\
  \ along with them. Shiny!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-Droogami.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-Droogami_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Go on. Try and pet me.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>So here's Lini's\
  \ kitty pal Droogami. She's a snow leopard who does sneaky hunter things, as you\
  \ might expect, and you can follow her keen nose to a new location and pounce on\
  \ something. But there's something interesting on this card—do you see it?</p> \n\
  \    <img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-Lini_180.jpeg\"\
  \ style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto;\"> \n    <p>Droogami's an ally with\
  \ set indicator P that has only the Animal trait, so she can't start in a character's\
  \ deck. Except her owner's, that is. Lini and Droogami have a special bond, so when\
  \ Lini builds her starting deck, she can include Droogami as one of her allies.\
  \ Anyone else who wants Droogami has to encounter her in play and succeed at that\
  \ Wisdom or Survival 11 check.</p> \n    <p>The Owner mechanic is one you'll be\
  \ seeing more of in upcoming sets (<i>coughWrathoftheRighteouscough</i>) and it's\
  \ featured on every card in the <i>Iconic Heroes</i> miniatures line. Here's one\
  \ for Seelah, also from the first set of miniatures:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-PaladinHelm.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-PaladinHelm_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>This helmet's worth stealing.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Iomedaean\
  \ helmet that changed our young paladin's life is a sweet little piece of armor,\
  \ and it too lacks the Basic trait. Revealing to reduce all kinds of damage by 2\
  \ ain't bad—maybe we should all consider taking up the paladin's mantle. Or helm.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>One of the nice things about these cards from an organized play design\
  \ perspective is that they're easy to integrate. If you're playing an iconic character\
  \ and you have a promotional card from this line that's owned by that character,\
  \ you can start with it. If you're not playing an iconic, don't despair—you might\
  \ get an opportunity to unlock access to these cards through a scenario or some\
  \ other special reward. Those of you playing Valeros might wish to <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"\

  \ this week. Until next time, Pathfinders!</p> \n    <p>Tanis O'Connor<br> <i>Adventure\
