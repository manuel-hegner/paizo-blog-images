  \  </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>The trail led, of course, to a tavern.</p>\
  \ \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Watching from a hidden perch across the street,\
  \ Ulthor studied the place. It was a stinking, squalid wreck in Absalom’s Puddles\
  \ district. Dead fish lay half-surfaced in the sucking mud around the entrance,\
  \ their rotted heads poking up as if straining for one last breath. Inside, the\
  \ air was thick with flayleaf and pesh smoke, spilled ale and unwashed bodies, and\
  \ the pervasive, inescapable stench of the Puddles’ foul tides. Dingy gray cloth\
  \ covered the grimy windows and hung from the rafters, turning the already-dim tavern\
  \ into a warren of shadows.</p> \n      <p>The Rat of Gonevar had sunk low in the\
  \ world since Ulthor had last had the trail. Still a weak man, prone to weak vices,\
  \ but without the money or friends to indulge them extravagantly anymore.</p> \n\
  \      <p>That was good. It would make apprehension easier.</p> \n      <p><i>There</i>.\
  \ Ulthor spotted the Rat’s battered hat bobbing through an alley as the man picked\
  \ his way across the muddy duckboards. The hat was different, and its jaunty feather\
  \ too, but Ulthor recognized his quarry’s limp immediately. The Rat had lost half\
  \ his left foot at their last meeting.</p> \n      <p>Beneath his grim iron helm,\
  \ Ulthor permitted himself the barest semblance of a smile. No more than the slightest\
  \ softening at the corners of his eyes and mouth, the most change he ever allowed\
  \ in his habitually stony expression. It had been a long hunt.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Prepare to move,” Ulthor told his fellow knights. He’d requisitioned three Hellknights\
  \ of the Rack as support from the local chapter house. The Order of the Rack generally\
  \ lacked the finesse he would have preferred, but its Hellknights were as terrifyingly\
  \ fierce and incorruptible as the Chain’s. They’d do.</p> \n      <p>“Terms of apprehension?”\
  \ one of the Rack knights asked.</p> \n      <p>Ulthor was briefly surprised. He\
  \ hadn’t expected the Hellknights of the Rack to care. “The Rat of Gonevar must\
  \ be taken. Preferably alive, but dead is acceptable. Minimize other casualties.\
  \ Those who do not interfere should not be harmed.”</p> \n      <p>“And those who\
  \ do?”</p> \n      <p>“Will be guilty of obstructing a lawful enforcement action.”\
  \ Ulthor tacked the arrest warrant onto the face of his shield so that he could\
  \ display it while keeping his hands free. Small chance that the patrons of the\
  \ Puddles would respect the warrant’s authority, but a small chance was better than\
  \ none. He preferred not to break skulls unnecessarily. “Further questions?”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>There were none. Ulthor dispatched two Hellknights to watch the tavern’\
  s rear and side exits. Once they were in place, he led the third to its front door.\
  \ Mud-spattered urchins and drunk idlers, suddenly and nervously sober, melted away\
  \ from the tavern as the Hellknights approached.</p> \n      <p>Ulthor ignored them.\
  \ The tavern’s door was already open, but he kicked it anyway, shattering the weather-beaten\
  \ wood against the wall to announce the Hellknights’ arrival.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ of Gonevar!” Ulthor shouted into the shocked quiet. “You stand charged with desertion,\
  \ murder, and trafficking in profane corruptions. Submit to the lawful authority\
  \ of the Order of the Chain.”</p> \n      <p>“Don’t believe I will,” the Rat drawled.\
  \ His tone was full of bravado, but even in the tavern’s poor light, Ulthor could\
  \ see the Rat’s knotted jaw and shaking hands. Withdrawal, and fear. Mostly fear.\
  \ “I’m a hero of Andoran, I am.”</p> \n      <p>“We’re free people here,” one of\
  \ the other card players blustered. He squinted at Ulthor with hostile, ale-fogged\
  \ eyes. “Free people. Unafraid.”</p> \n      <p>“You tell ‘im, Gammel,” the Rat\
  \ encouraged, scooting his own chair back discreetly.</p> \n      <p>Gammel launched\
  \ a clumsy fist at Ulthor. The Hellknight knocked his swipe away with a short punch\
  \ of his own, driving a mailed fist into the drunkard’s face. Gammel’s nose crunched\
  \ bloodily under the blow, but Ulthor held back his strength. The drunkard didn’\
  t deserve to die over this.</p> \n      <p>The Rat was reaching under the table\
  \ for a hidden weapon. Kicking Gammel and his chair aside, Ulthor brought his sword\
  \ down on the table, smashing the wooden top, the cudgel that the Rat had been reaching\
  \ for beneath it, and the Rat’s arm.</p> \n      <p>“You are a liar and a coward,”\
  \ the Hellknight announced, his voice thundering over the Rat’s cry of outraged\
  \ agony. “You murdered your superior officer and two comrades, stole a shipment\
  \ of slaves, and sold all but the youngest and most impressionable. Those you released\
  \ to spread false tales of your heroism. Then you began ‘rescuing’ slaves so that\
  \ you could pin unholy texts and secret corruptions into their clothes and minds,\
  \ using them as unwitting mules to carry foul contraband through Andoran. These\
  \ are your crimes, Dunryl of Gonevar.”</p> \n      <p>Most of Ulthor’s recitation\
  \ went unheard. At the sight of bare steel, the tavern erupted into chaos. Patrons\
  \ threw mugs and half-full slop bowls at Ulthor, and then at the Rack Hellknights\
  \ who charged in to support him. Others shouted and jeered, less interested in defending\
  \ the Rat of Gonevar than in spitting on the nearest symbol of authority. The law\
  \ wasn’t popular in the Puddles.</p> \n      <p>The Rack Hellknights moved to stop\
  \ the brawling. They were efficient, methodical, and brutal. Bones cracked. Iron\
  \ thudded into unprotected flesh. The taunts and jeers turned to panicked cries\
  \ and bloody-mouthed moans.</p> \n      <p>Ulthor didn’t give them a glance. He\
  \ reached over the splintered table, ignoring Gammel’s squeak of terror, and grabbed\
  \ the Rat by his broken arm.</p> \n      <p>“You bastard!” the Rat shouted, hysterical\
  \ with pain. “Five years it’s been, and you won’t leave me alone! You broke my <i>arm!</i>”\
  </p> \n      <p>“Submit,” Ulthor said. His gauntleted fist flexed. Bones ground\
  \ together in his grip.</p> \n      <p>The Rat swayed on the brink of blacking out.\
  \ “Let me go. Let me go! I can tell you — things. All kinds of things. Schemes.\
  \ Secrets. The — the moaners’ cults. The smugglers. The people who hired me. I can\
  \ give them to you. <i>Please!</i>”</p> \n      <p>Ulthor relaxed his grip minutely.\
  \ Behind them, the brawl had died down. Only the groans and whimpers of the injured\
  \ could be heard now. The Rack Hellknights moved among the fallen, dealing out extra\
  \ blows to those who refused to stay down.</p> \n      <p>“Please,” the Rat sobbed.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“I am a Hellknight of the Chain,” Ulthor told him. He stood, dragging\
  \ the Rat to his feet by his broken arm. “It was my duty to apprehend you. But if\
  \ what you say is true, it is not my duty to keep you. Unholy cults are not within\
  \ my order’s remit.”</p> \n      <p>Somehow the Rat managed to swallow the shriek\
  \ of pain that started up his throat. Despite it all, hope ignited in his eyes.\
  \ “Then we’ve got a deal? You’ll let me go?”</p> \n      <p>“No,” Ulthor said. “\
  I will send you to the Order of the Pyre.”</p> \n      <p>And then he smiled, <i>really</i>\
  \ smiled, as the Rat of Gonevar screamed.</p> \n      <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\
