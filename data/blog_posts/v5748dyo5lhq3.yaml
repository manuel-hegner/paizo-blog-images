  description\">The mesmerist creeps into the minds of his enemies, bending their\
  \ wills. Our initial concept for the mesmerist was a sort of anti-bard. The class\
  \ would get a similar blend of spellcasting with moderate combat ability, but instead\
  \ of buffing allies, it would penalize enemies and make them softer targets. Our\
  \ mesmerist achieves this not only through a robust selection of debuff spells,\
  \ but also through his intense stare. He can focus on a creature within 30 feet\
  \ as a swift action, imposing a penalty on the target's Will saves. Bold stare options,\
  \ which the mesmerist gains starting at 3rd level, allow him to apply that penalty\
  \ to other types of rolls or weaken the subject of his stare in other ways. The\
  \ best part? He can mentally remove the memory of his stare from the target's mind\
  \ afterward, so they forget he was manipulating them all along.</p> \n     <p>Through\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> playtest process,\
  \ we saw that the mesmerist needed a leg up, particularly when it came to the combat\
  \ side of things, so we added the painful stare ability. This comes in at level\
  \ 1 and causes subjects of the mesmerist's stare to take more damage from attacks.\
  \ We also increased the Will save penalty the stare gives (from -1 to -2) and made\
  \ it increase automatically to -3 at 8th level. The stare lost the ability to target\
  \ multiple creatures so that we could make the debuffs stronger.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ other hallmark ability of the mesmerist is his mesmerist tricks, abilities similar\
  \ to contingencies that he can set up and trigger when a condition is met. By planning\
  \ ahead and anticipating situations intelligently, the mesmerist can surprise his\
  \ foes with nasty magic. The biggest change here was the duration. Instead of lasting\
  \ for 1 minute per mesmerist level, a trick stays set up until the next time the\
  \ mesmerist prepares his spells (or until it's triggered). The mesmerist also picked\
  \ up a bunch of new tricks, like letting the subject turn into a bird and flee from\
  \ an attack or reduce the damage from an attack and simultaneously create a shadow\
  \ illusion in the attacker's form, attacking someone else.</p> \n     <p>More so\
  \ than any other class, the mesmerist is built around casting spells that manipulate\
  \ minds. This kind of class can be tricky to build, largely due to the number of\
  \ creatures in the game that are immune to mind-affecting effects and the predominance\
  \ of mental spells that get negated by a Will save. That led us down two avenues.\
  \ The first is the bold stare option called psychic inception, which gives you a\
  \ chance to affect such creatures. The second came in the form of new mind-affecting\
  \ spells that do have a partial effect if the target saves.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9egu\"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> also includes four mesmerist\
  \ archetypes. The cult master lets you control groups of cultists devoted to you,\
  \ gaining special tricks and even being reborn in a follower's body. The spirit\
  \ walker gains control over undead and adds undead-themed spells to his spell list.\
  \ The toxitician uses injuections instead of a mesmerist stare, causing pain and\
  \ delivering severe penalties. Finally, the vexing daredevil (pictured here) focuses\
  \ on the combat side of the mesmerist class, gaining additional weapon prodiciency,\
  \ bonus feats for feinting, and dazzling feint abilities she can use against creatures\
  \ she fools with a feint.</p> \n     <p>May the mesmerist's eyes never meet yours!</p>\
