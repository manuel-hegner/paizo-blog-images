  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">I've been loving this season from the moment we started\
  \ planning it, and every batch of scenarios makes me love Season 9 of <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> a little more. Not\
  \ only are we gearing up for a series of Sovereign Court adventures leading up to\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown\">War for the Crown Adventure\
  \ Path</a>, working on an exciting Exchange storyline, outlining a powerful Silver\
  \ Crusade arc, and using the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/acg\">Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Guild</a> to pursue one of the perpetrators behind <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsrpg/scenarios/season9\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em></a>, but we're also\
  \ in the early stages of locking down Pathfinder Society's Season 10. If you've\
  \ seen team members cackling with barely-contained glee on social media, it's likely\
  \ for these reasons and more.</p> \n    <p>And if you've seen us bouncing excitedly\
  \ in the months leading up to now, it's probably because of the excellent scenarios\
  \ we're releasing today.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0906E-Zepha.jpg\"\

  \ up is the Tier 1-5 delight <a href=\"/products/btpy9weq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-906-The-Shores-of-Heaven\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-06: The Shores of Heaven</em></a>, which dispatches\
  \ the PCs to Heaven itself to research and perform a ritual that might purify a\
  \ beloved Pathfinder colleague. This is exciting for several reasons. First, this\
  \ scenario's a direct result of the reporting data participants like you provided\
  \ for <a href=\"/products/btpy9huy?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-17-Thralls-of-the-Shattered-God\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-17: Thralls of the Shattered God</em></a>. Second,\
  \ it's another chance to adventure with the Pathfinder \"venture-captain\" Valais.\
  \ Third, it's an adventure... in Heaven. This last point's been something of a personal\
  \ challenge for me, as the common response to proposing a Heaven adventure is \"\
  There's no point; the archons would destroy any threats immediately.\" Linda and\
  \ I have had a few days where we shouted the equivalent of \"They said it couldn't\
  \ be done! They said we were MAD!\" Then we would cackle and go back to outlining.\
  \ More accurately, Linda would go back to outlining, as she oversaw this project\
  \ as its development lead.</p> \n    <p>Really, though, this came together as cleanly\
  \ and beautifully as it did thanks to the author, Cole Kronewitter. Cole's worked\
  \ on several other scenarios, and we found his character portrayals in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9m00?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-25-Orders-from-the-Gate\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-25: Orders from the Gate</em></a> represented exactly the\
  \ kind of talent we'd need to make this scenario happen. He delivered, and this\
  \ scenario with Silver Crusade ties is absolutely charming. What's more, there's\
  \ a delightful section about how characters with evil auras or evil familiars function\
  \ during this adventure, including one of the most explicit \"Don't mess this up\"\
  \ warnings I think we've ever included in a scenario—including in the Bonekeep series.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Included here are two preview illustrations, including a powerful celestial\
  \ you'll meet as well as a disfigured fiend that's played an ongoing roll in Valais's\
  \ story.</p> \n    <p>Last month we featured <a href=\"/products/btpy9weo?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-04-The-Unseen-Inclusion\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-04: The Unseen Inclusion</em></a> by Mike Kimmel,\
  \ which kicked off a very fun Scarab Sages narrative in Thuvia. This month, Matt\
  \ Duval has taken the baton and brought us <a href=\"/products/btpy9wer?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-07-Salvation-of-the-Sages\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</em></a>, an epic\
  \ Tier 7-11 showdown in which the PCs face off against an ancient enemy and hold\
  \ the fate of a faction in their hands. Need another reason to be excited? How would\
  \ you like the opportunity to adventure alongside all of the Jeweled Sages? Yes,\
  \ all of them. Yes, that includes one who might not be on the best of terms with\
  \ the Society.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0907E-AryanaTahari.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Marco Horvatin</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>I\
  \ recruited Matt Duval to write this in part because he has such a history with\
  \ the Scarab Sages storyline, but also because he knows how to make a big and flashy\
  \ event that reveals long-held secrets. The two of us had a chance to brainstorm\
  \ the details at Gen Con, where we devised some terrific scenes that I feel really\
  \ shed light on many of the extant sages and allow the PCs to uncover information\
  \ central to the campaign and its NPCs in new ways.</p> \n    <p>There are a few\
  \ tools and design variations that appear in this scenario that we're testing out.\
  \ These won't necessarily become the norm, but Linda and I are interested in hearing\
  \ whether these are easy to use, helpful, and something you might want to see more\
  \ in the future. Specifically, #9-07 uses a skill DC table that has appeared in\
  \ past multi-table interactive specials, which assigns an Easy, Average, and Hard\
  \ DC value for each level range. This scenario also provides a few GM reference\
  \ handouts that summarize who certain NPCs are and which past Chronicle sheets the\
  \ players have might factor into the scenario. Although I don't plan on including\
  \ these handouts in anything but very canon-heavy adventures, I would like to hear\
  \ how we can make them as useful as possible for GMs.</p> \n    <p>This is a big\
  \ scenario with big implications for the Scarab Sages, and our team reserved it\
  \ as high a level tier as we could to ensure that as many faction PCs can play this—\
  and enjoy its Chronicle sheet—as possible. I think Salvation of the Sages really\
  \ drives home that Season 9 really is the Season of Factions' Favor, and we're only\
  \ three months in!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play Lead Developer</i></p>\n\
