  artist: "a rogue's sneak attack to lose the ability to make attacks of opportunity\
    \ for 1 round. There are a number of rogue talents that affect movement, allowing\
    \ a rogue to move faster while balancing or sneaking. There are even a pair of\
    \ talents that allow rogues to cast a limited number of simple spells to aid them\
    \ in their shadowy deeds. Aside"
