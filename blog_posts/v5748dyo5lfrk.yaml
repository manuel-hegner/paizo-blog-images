  \    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">If\
  \ there's anything that we Paizonians have learned over the years, it's the value\
  \ of community. The Paizo community has been the backbone of our business and the\
  \ emotional core of our company since the beginning—the thing that carried us through\
  \ the rough patches of magazine transitions and edition changes, into this awesome\
  \ place we are now. But that's only one small part of what this community does.\
  \ On the other side, it's been amazing to watch our fans and friends interact with\
  \ each other—helping people through health crises, natural disasters, and the everyday\
  \ problems we all have to face. We talk a lot about how proud we are of our products,\
  \ but helping foster one of the friendliest messageboards on the internet? That's\
  \ a pretty big deal, too.</span></p> \n     <p>So why am I getting all sentimental\
  \ right now? Because community isn't just about helping your friends—it's about\
  \ working together to help other folks as well. Toward that end, for the last several\
  \ years we've been working with Worldbuilders—a charity started by best-selling\
  \ fantasy author Patrick Rothfuss to help get livestock and education to folks in\
  \ need all over the world—to help raise money for their annual funding drive. This\
  \ year we're auctioning off some ultra-signed copies of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>\
  \ and <i>Inner Sea World Guide</i>, as well as a copy of <i>Stalking the Beast</i>—\
  you can bid on them <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/Pathfinder-bundle-Core-Rulebook-Inner-Sea-World-Guide-Staling-the-Beast-novel-/171219843180?pt=US_Fiction_Books&amp;hash=item27dd7f786c\"\
  >here</a> or read more on <a href=\"http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2014/01/more-awesome-games/\"\
  >Pat's blog</a>. (And even if you aren't intrigued by those particular products,\
  \ check out <a href=\"http://worldbuilders.org/\">worldbuilders.org</a> to see all\
  \ the other awesome and rare stuff that's been donated by your favorite authors\
  \ and game companies!)</p> \n     <p>Whether you bid on the books, donate to Worldbuilders,\
  \ or get inspired to donate or volunteer locally, thanks for helping us make this\
  \ a community that gives back!</p> \n     <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Managing Editor</i></p>\
