  \    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 20, 2010</p> \n    <p>For a long time, the\
  \ most common question people asked me about Pathfinder fiction was, \"So when will\
  \ we see novels?\" Now that we've finally answered that one definitively—in just\
  \ a few weeks, with the release of Dave Gross's inaugural Pathfinder Tales novel\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/v5748btpy8dds\">Prince of Wolves</a>—the most common\
  \ question is, \"So how can I submit some Pathfinder fiction?\" On that front, there's\
  \ good news and bad news.</p> \n    <p>The bad news is that I have no idea. While\
  \ I'd love to do an open call someday and review submissions in search of completely\
  \ undiscovered authors, right now everyone around here is editing so hard they're\
  \ bleeding from the retinas. So I might have to wait quite a while before I can\
  \ open that particular can of worms. </p> \n    <p>The good news, however, is that\
  \ <i>you</i> don't have to wait! As of late last week, the good folks over at <a\
  \ href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Wayfinder/114977378573\" target=\"nofollow\"\
  ><i>Wayfinder</i> </a> and <a href=\"http://www.pathfinderchronicler.net/?page_id=1743\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">Pathfinder Chronicler</a> have teamed up to bring you the\
  \ first-ever Pathfinder Fan Fiction Contest. In addition to two runner-up prizes,\
  \ the grand prize winner will receive <b>one hundred dollars</b> in Paizo gift certificates\
  \ and have his or her story published in its entirety in <i><a href=\"/store/downloads/paizoFansUnited\"\
  >Wayfinder</a></i> and on Pathfinder Chronicler!</p> \n    <p>Here's how it works:\
  \ Any author who hasn't been professionally published for their fiction (and if\
  \ you aren't sure, you're probably eligible!) can submit a story of between 3000\
  \ and 4500 words, set in the Pathfinder campaign setting. The carefully selected\
  \ judges from <i>Wayfinder</i> and Chronicler will narrow the submissions down to\
  \ the top five stories, which will then be passed on to me. I'll review them blind\
  \ (meaning without access to the authors' names), and judge the stories according\
  \ to the same criteria I use when evaluating our professionally commissioned Pathfinder\
  \ Tales stories. The winner and two runners-up will then be announced on October\
  \ 1st.</p> \n    <p>Further details on the contest can be found at <a href=\"http://www.pathfinderchronicler.net/?page_id=1743\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">www.pathfinderchronicler.net</a>. The contest opens to submissions\
  \ August 15th, and closes September 12th. So what are you waiting for? Start dusting\
  \ off those old story ideas or favorite game characters, and steel yourself for\
  \ a literary battle royal! Many stories will enter, but only one will leave with\
  \ the grand prize, carried out of the arena on the virtual shoulders of the Pathfinder\
  \ community. </p> \n    <p>Do you have what it takes? </p> \n    <p>James L. Sutter\
  \ <br>Fiction Editor</p> \n   </blockquote> <!--tags: Community, Pathfinder Chronicler,\
