  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The Tempering: a time of\
  \ travel for any kasatha reaching maturity, when the young adult seeks out new experiences,\
  \ and in doing so, discovers himself. Some accept exciting internships, and others\
  \ join crews to travel beyond the stars—proud, noble, traditional stuff. It was\
  \ lost within this wistful self-reflection that Tahja gradually regained consciousness\
  \ following his accidental dive off a skybridge, his fall unceremoniously broken\
  \ by a dumpster. In his dawning lucidity, he gazed about and wondered.</p> \n  \
  \   <p><i>“How did you end up here?”</i></p> \n     <p>Tahja reflexively jumped,\
  \ or tried to, instead slipping on a lumpy trash bag below. The question mirrored\
  \ his own thoughts, yet it wasn’t his own. In his scramble for stability, he looked\
  \ up and locked eyes with a shocked shirren, her compound eyes bulging slightly\
  \ in alarm at his sudden movements.</p> \n     <p>“Whoa, hey, hang on, calm down!\
  \ Too much telepathy? Fine, hey—unarmed, see?” She raised her two main arms, splaying\
  \ her three fingers and rattling her neck barbules in alarm. After a few tense seconds,\
  \ she continued with her reedy voice. “That was quite a fall. You okay? Need an\
  \ ambulance?”</p> \n     <p>“No. No authorities,” Tahja gasped, using his lower\
  \ arms to sit up while his uppers straightened his mouth scarf. “I need somewhere\
  \ to hide.” With a glance upward toward the twisting, towering skyscraper cast in\
  \ late afternoon light, he added, “Just for a few hours, until sundown.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>The shirren’s antennae bobbed with amusement. “Oh wow, you really hit your\
  \ head. Sundown? You know you’re on Verces, right? Tidally locked? Always the same\
  \ time of day?” She cocked a claw toward the nearby skyscraper as Tahja’s eyes widened\
  \ in confusion. “Hell, this is Building 5 for the Nabokon Broadcasting Network.”\
  \ She punctuated the announcement by tapping the sewn patch on her coveralls. “\
  It’s been late afternoon here since the Gap—perfect hour for filming drama.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Verces. Nabokon. Tahja tried to remember his cultural training. That\
  \ put him somewhere in the nation Kashak, known for its cybernetics research and\
  \ heavily augmented populace. That also put him a long way from Absalom Station.\
  \ The last he remembered, he’d been early in his Tempering on the station, short\
  \ on credits, and several pages deep into the contracts for a short pharmaceutical\
  \ testing gig. He figured he would get a few shots, earn some money, and then depart\
  \ for new adventures. Instead he’d woken up from surgery less than an hour ago,\
  \ his body no longer entirely his own. He dimly remembered doctors trying to calm\
  \ and sedate him before he panicked, broke free, and started to run. His fall had\
  \ just been his latest gamble in escaping his pursuers.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>The shirren eyed him sadly. “C’mon, you’re clearly not\
  \ doing well. I’m just coming off duty and can put you up for a bit. Name’s Estrik.”\
  \ She reached up and clasped his hand, pulling him up and out.</p> \n     <p>“Tahja\
  \ Maur of Clan Estu, House Truyark, Essence of Ipu—and thank you,” he responded\
  \ while twisting his leg free from where it had punched through the dumpster lid.\
  \ “But I’m being chased by dangerous people.” With that, he extracted his left leg,\
  \ a cybernetic limb of hex-plated skin covering powerful joints and pistons.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Estrik’s barbules quivered with admiration as she inspected the limb\
  \ with interest. “No kidding! Dermasteel weave?” She flicked the knee. “Is that\
  \ adamantine? I bet it’s the debt collectors after you, with this thing’s price\
  \ tag. Weird that it doesn’t even have a maker’s mark, though.” The shirren’s antennae\
  \ suddenly twitched and she straightened with fear before pushing Tahja behind cover\
  \ and pathing a silent warning into his mind. “<i>We have company!</i>”</p> \n \
  \    <p>“That’s because it’s stolen,” remarked the alley wall as a hidden figure’\
  s skin dropped its camouflaged pattern. Eight feet tall with bulging all-black eyes\
  \ and pale, chameleon-like skin, he was a verthani, the planet’s native humanoid\
  \ species. His mostly nude frame had allowed his chromatophores to hide his approach,\
  \ but it did little to hide the artificial muscle fibers and untold other augmentations\
  \ that bulged under his skin. “This is NextStep business. Move away from the subject,\
  \ bug. This doesn’t concern you.”</p> \n     <p>“Rude!” Estrik wailed before telepathically\
  \ gushing to Tahja <i>“You’re a criminal? Wanted by a real bounty hunter?”</i> Her\
  \ eyes developed an admiring sheen. <i>“It’s just like in the stories—like Astral\
  \ Eternities or Galaxy in your Eye? I’m such a fan! So. Cool.”</i> She paused in\
  \ hearing his wordless response before adding <i>“Oh yeah, I know another way out\
  \ of here, why?”</i> His response came in the form of a swift kick that sent the\
  \ dumpster careening across the alley, powered by his leg’s mechanical strength.\
  \ It slammed into the verthani and threw him against the nearby wall, stunning him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“The escape?” Tahja insisted. Estrik goggled at the dumpster for a second\
  \ before whipping out a keycard, running to the far end of the alley, and swiping\
  \ open a service door. The two slipped inside before slamming it closed. “Where\
  \ to from here?”</p> \n     <p>“Zakol, one of the camera operators,” Estrik wheezed\
  \ through her flaring facial spiracles. “He has a bunch of family near Darkside.\
  \ It’s a trek, but maybe they could get you out of here?” The shirren mentally conveyed\
  \ a vague map interspersed with halfhearted assurances and excited squealing. The\
  \ chatter ceased as the door shuddered from a gunshot outside and the blaze of a\
  \ plasma torch punched through the lock. “New plan: we run.”</p> \n     <p>By the\
  \ time the outside door clattered open, Tahja had already bounded down the service\
  \ hall, up two flights of stairs, through a cluster of interns, and into a studio—\
  all while Estrik apologetically struggled to keep up with the kasatha’s cybernetically\
  \ enhanced strides. They caught their breath for a moment before Estrik telepathically\
  \ buzzed, <i>“No, no, we can’t stay here.”</i> Tahja stared back blankly, prompting\
  \ the shirren to continue. <i>“Hear that? They’re filming Galaxy in Your Eye, only\
  \ the premier verthani serial romantic drama. You know, the star-crossed lovers\
  \ forbidden to marry by caste, all set during the Gap? Thing’s practically a religion\
  \ for some folks. Like, I’m not even allowed to clean within a floor of this place!”\
  </i></p> \n     <p>“No other choice I see,” Tahja muttered, looking for a concealed\
  \ means of crossing the occupied set being watched by a live studio audience. He\
  \ tiptoed toward the ongoing scene featuring fantastically beautiful actors.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Zfezar,” demanded the Augmented verthani woman, her steely arm and\
  \ reinforced spine belying the melodramatic intensity in her voice as she wilted\
  \ in her partners arms. “Were our families to find us so, what would they say?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“To hell with families, traditions, and castes, Apsoria!” responded\
  \ her masculine counterpart, his chest emblazoned with Ibra’s divine constellation,\
  \ marking him as a God-Chosen. “Too long have we danced to their wishes yet denied\
  \ the duet sung by our hearts alone! Here, just the two of us, nothing can stand\
  \ in our way.”</p> \n     <p>The stage door shuddered, signaling the bounty hunter’\
  s arrival. As Estrik worriedly looked back, Tahja pushed forward onto the set, wasting\
  \ no more time. The actors, interrupted on the cusp of embrace looked up with shock,\
  \ the director off-screen seemed ready to shout, and the hundred-strong audience\
  \ gazed hungrily at this new development with an audible gasp. Tahja took to one\
  \ knee, showing his cybernetics openly. “My lady, I come with dire news. Your family\
  \ has learned of your actions.”</p> \n     <p>“Ha, they dare not intervene!” laughed\
  \ Apsoria, improvising, though her narrowing eyes conveyed how suspicious she was\
  \ of the kasatha’s sudden appearance.</p> \n     <p><i>“More dramatic!”</i> Estrik\
  \ mentally insisted from her hiding spot.</p> \n     <p>“And...they have sent assassins,\
  \ my lady!” Tahja added quickly. “By slaying your love, ah—“</p> \n     <p><i>“\
  His Occult Eminence Zfezar”</i></p> \n     <p>“—his Occult Eminence Zfezar,” Tahja\
  \ continued, silently thanking Estrik for the prompt, “you will be bound to honor\
  \ your arranged marriage!”</p> \n     <p>The audience’s gratifying gasps mollified\
  \ the director, who sat back to observe this strange turn, and the actors adapted\
  \ flawlessly to the changing script. “Villains!” growled Zfezar with a flourish\
  \ of his cape.</p> \n     <p>Just then, the stage door fell open, and the bounty\
  \ hunter stepped into the lights, at first with menace but then with quizzical uncertainty.\
  \ As Apsoria and Zfefar berated the supposed assassin, the bounty hunter struggled\
  \ to push past them, shouting. “Brightside blind you all, stand aside!” His throat\
  \ swelled as his head tilted back before he spewed a bolt of electricity from his\
  \ biotech dragon gland. Tahja’s cybernetic leg kicked into action—literally—flinging\
  \ him out of danger’s path.</p> \n     <p>The audience shrieked with delight as\
  \ Zfezar attempted a stage punch that the bounty hunter easily dodged before hurling\
  \ the actor aside. He was just beginning spit another attack when Apsoria struck\
  \ in earnest, hitting him in the throat as his dragon gland built up charge. The\
  \ hostile verthani’s eyes went wide as the gland fired prematurely, shocking him\
  \ and sending coruscating lightning ringlets dancing over his body. Smoking slightly,\
  \ he dropped to the ground.</p> \n     <p> Without hesitation, the two actors took\
  \ each other in their arms. “My family has spoken its peace, and I have delivered\
  \ my answer, Zfezar. No matter what lies ahead, we will face it...” </p> \n    \
  \ <p>“...together,” he finished.</p> \n     <p>“And scene!” cried the director,\
  \ punctuated by the audience’s applause. She hopped off her chair and snagged Tahja\
  \ by an arm. “You know that there weren’t kasathas in this system during the Gap,\
  \ right? And that makes what just happened more than a little anachronistic?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Um, yes? About that?” stuttered the young kasatha.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Ha! Soesn’t matter! The show’s set in the Gap for a reason: can’t historically disprove\
  \ anything we film! And now this is just what we need to shake up the story: aliens!\
  \ I’ll get those damn writers to revise whatever sorry script they had in store.\
  \ Let’s talk numbers—got an agent?”</p> \n     <p>Tahja desperately looked around\
  \ for any help in salvaging this awkward moment, but he saw only Estrik. Her arms\
  \ were quivering with excitement as she pathed emphatically to him one more time:\
