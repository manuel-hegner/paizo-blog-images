  \ itemprop=\"description\"> Let's get this out right away: It's an awesome feeling\
  \ to complete an Adventure Path. As we all know, you don't have to scan the message\
  \ boards very hard to find stories of how many groups almost made it to volume six\
  \ of an AP. Not too long before the historic events of 2020, we assembled for exactly\
  \ that: one final marathon of Ruins of Azlant. Our odyssey was at its conclusion,\
  \ and what made this marathon equally nostalgic was that it was our last adventure\
  \ of the Pathfinder 1st Edition era.</p> \n      <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"\

  >Part 5</a></li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>Author Thurston Hillman gave us everything\
  \ we wanted in the final volume: enormous creatures, complex battles (some underwater),\
  \ deadly magic, a climactic final encounter, and the powerful items we had patiently\
  \ climbed so many character levels to see. All we had to do was find a way through\
  \ the gathering army of ulat-kini, locate the secret facility know as the Compass,\
  \ and stop a veiled master from setting off a doomsday weapon. No prob! </p> \n\
  \      <p>To help bring the marathon experience to life, we were joined from Seattle\
  \ by OAD member <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldj9?Meet-the-Intern-Savannah\"\
  >Savannah Broadway</a> in the live-NPC role of Imiolana, a pure-blooded Azlanti.\
  \ We also contacted our friends at <a href=\"https://www.blackbardstudios.com/\"\
  >Black Bard Studios</a> for their help in creating a 3D setup for the final encounter,\
  \ along with the custom lusca and seashell buildings you see below. The talents\
  \ of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/geordiejohnstudios\">Geordie John Studios</a>\
  \ were used to create much of the beautiful colony display, and the artists of <a\
  \ href=\"http://bluetablepainting.com/\">Blue Table Painting</a> did the fantastic\
  \ paint work on our character minis. </p> \n      <p>The end of this Adventure Path\
  \ also saw two new players achieve 100 hours at our table and become full members\
  \ of Order of the Amber Die. The first was Julian Dappolone, son of OAD member <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5ljda?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons\"\
  >Michael Dappolone</a>; the second was Robert Pontious, also of <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2019/10/joining-order-of-the-amber-die/\"\
  >Know Direction</a>, who flew in from Rhode Island. Congrats to Julian and Rob,\

  \ Veiled Past</em></h3> \n      <p>We boarded our <em>apparatus of the crab</em>\
  \ one final time, cranked up the music (Borgore's <em>Dolphin Attack</em>), and\
  \ launched an amphibious assault against the massing forces of the veiled master.\
  \ These fights saw us facing units of the \"troop\" type from Bestiary 6, a monster\
  \ mechanic we look forward to seeing again in Pathfinder 2.0!</p> \n      <p>Like\
  \ <em>ioun stones</em>? You'll get plenty of them in this Adventure Path. You'll\
  \ also get a CR 17 ioun golem, which can steal your stones--absorb their power--and\
  \ fire them back at you. Just plain awesome!</p> \n      <p>The Amber Die said farewell\
  \ to this campaign the best way it knew how: by gracing everyone in the room with\
  \ a 20-20-20. If you've seen it happen, you'll never forget it.</p> \n      <p>While\
  \ defending the colony's new tavern, Valeros squared off against Sharopech, an ulat-kini\
  \ fighter older than the fall of Azlant itself. In a slugfest that would have made\
  \ Foreman and Ali jealous, the two threw out more than four hundred damage in three\
  \ rounds. When it was over, the skum was face down and the beer was safe.</p> \n\
  \      <p>We recovered an <em>unholy</em> sword made of <em>throneglass</em>, a\
  \ material once part of the Imperial Palace in Azlant. Kyra grasped the blade (known\
  \ as <em>Empire's Fall</em>), and used her prestige capstone ability to seek Sarenrae's\
  \ aid in performing a miracle. The weapon was reborn as <em>Dawnflower's Hope</em>,\
  \ and was with us to the end. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  \ plan, develop, and defend our own colony made this Adventure Path unique. We watched\
  \ proudly when the first stone structure was erected with the help of our <em>stone\
  \ shape</em> and ant haul spells. Alongside colony-building, crafting alliances\
  \ and relationships with many of the communities we encountered turned out to be\
  \ one of the defining features of this Adventure Path. In fact, by the time we reached\
  \ the final encounter, our odyssey wasn't even about us so much anymore, it was\
  \ about the NPCs who stood alongside us for volumes of play and ultimately outnumbered\
  \ us in the party.</p> \n      <h3>Character Deaths</h3> \n      <p>As the party\
  \ tried to broker a peace between the colony and nearby locathah, several ugothol\
  \ assassins were present in disguise. The author's deadly expertise with stat blocks\
  \ was evident here, leaving us to deal with the bodies of Kyra, Imiolana, and Valeros.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Once inside the secret Azlanti facility, there was the small matter\
  \ of dealing with some of its still-active defenses, which included intelligent\
  \ clockwork soldiers; unfortunately, they had already taken out Koloshkora before\
  \ we understood the threat they posed.</p> \n      <h3>Best Quote From Marathon\

  \ <b>Adam (GM)</b>: \"Go ahead and bust out the best Diplomacy check of your career.\"\
  <br> <b>Dan (Kyra)</b>: \"Ummm...(rolls, silence)...(more silence)...forty-three?\"\
  <br> <b>Adam</b>: \"Dude, that's awesome, why did you mess with us?\"<br> <b>Dan</b>:\

  \ 13px;\"></p>\n      </div> \n      <h3>How it Ended</h3> \n      <p>Thoughts of\
  \ previous final performances upped our anxiety as we gazed across a stone catwalk\
  \ toward the doomsday device we had long sought. Opposing us was the veiled master\
  \ Ochymua, accompanied by two aboleth wizards--yet that's not what made the fight\
  \ difficult. The entire room was a sphere of water with air in the center, and the\
  \ water was fair game as passable terrain. Our aquanaut and locathah guide swiftly\
  \ dove in and were upon the aboleths in short order. The battle turned into high-level\
  \ Pathfinder's version of synchronized swimming, where your character's speed and\
  \ method of locomotion determined your role. The encounter was further complicated\
  \ by the arrival of Jazradan, a fated Azlanti leader in ghost form who wasn't exactly\
  \ on our side. OAD history was made, with an astonishing fourteen <em>disintegrate</em>\
  \ spells firing back and forth as we struggled over the doomsday weapon. Things\
  \ looked pretty bleak for a while with three characters trapped in <em>maze</em>\
  \ spells, but Paizo developer Eleanor Ferron gets a nod here for designing such\
  \ a competent companion in Imiolana, whom ended up bringing down both Ochymua and\
  \ Jazradan before the device went off.</p> \n      <p>It was the cleanest victory\
  \ we've had in our years on the Paizo blog, but Kyra said it best regarding everything\
  \ about The Azlant Odyssey: \"We didn't just win. We succeeded.\" </p> \n      <p>Lastly,\
  \ a sincere thank you to Managing Developer Adam Daigle for his support throughout\
  \ this project. There is a great deal of patience and effort required to present\
  \ an entire Adventure Path on the Paizo blog, and he's been with us through three\
  \ of them now</p> \n      <h3>More Content:</h3> \n      <p>For character builds,\
