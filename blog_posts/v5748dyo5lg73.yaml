  \   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The latest volume of the Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting line has started shipping out to subscribers, and it's one that I know\
  \ a lot of players and Game Masters are very excited to get their hands on—<a href=\"\
  /products/btpy978l\"><i>Numeria, Land of Fallen Stars</i></a> I asked one of the\
  \ book's co-authors, Jim Groves, to write a few words about his own excitement surrounding\
  \ the book, and what a few of his favorite elements of it are. Here's what he has\
  \ to say (as well as a few pieces of preview art I generously appended to his text).</span></p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Like many fans, I was at home during Gen Con 2013.\
  \ My personal situation required me to live vicariously through the Twitter feeds\
  \ and messageboard posts of fans who generously kept me informed. When I read James\
  \ Jacobs had announced the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods\">Iron Gods\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, I wasted no time e-mailing him, right then and there, while\
  \ he was still on the convention floor. A few days later, I received a very friendly\
  \ and gracious reply. James already had a list of authors in mind, and it is vital\
  \ for the health of the product line to add new authors and vary the cast up from\
  \ AP to AP. So I understood James's reasoning perfectly, but when Mark Moreland\
  \ contacted me a few weeks later to work on <a href=\"/products/btpy978l\"><i>Numeria,\
  \ Land of the Fallen Stars</i></a>, I was overjoyed.</p> \n     <p>When writing\
  \ for Numeria, I felt it was important to honor the theme of otherworldly super-science,\
  \ but not to absolute exclusion. There are a number of elements, like the Plain\
  \ of Ten Thousand Swords and the Battle of Grasyhot, which are all about traditional\
  \ barbaric adventure. I was also very aware throughout the entire process that Ustalav,\
  \ the Worldwound, and the River Kingdoms were right across a borderline—a division\
  \ many adventurers and barbarians do not honor. My hope is fans gain insight into\
  \ how Numeria fits and interacts with the world around it.</p> \n     <p>Among my\
  \ favorite plots is the Chapel of Rent Flesh, dedicated to kyton activities on Golarion.\
  \ The origin and history of the kytons is wonderfully mysterious and provocative.\
  \ They demonstrate an aspect of the campaign setting which does not conform to a\
  \ tidy and artificially organized cosmology. The Chapel doesn't upend what we know\
  \ about the universe, but it asks some interesting questions. I also love Hajoth\
  \ Hakados and Chitterhome. These communities allow a GM to introduce unusual player\
  \ characters and NPCs, not just for a Numeria campaign but for all of Golarion,\
  \ without feeling they're \"fighting the campaign setting.\" GMs should never feel\
  \ that way, but I think we help with a liberal sprinkling of rationale and context.\
  \ I hope the book inspires and supports people to develop their own incredible and\
  \ original campaigns.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\
