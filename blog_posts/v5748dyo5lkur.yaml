  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">Cities rise and fall alongside the civilizations that\
  \ build them; some falling into ruin, some serving as the foundation for new settlements,\
  \ and some weathering the test of time. Among the nations of humanity, some cities\
  \ stretch back over 5,000 years of unbroken history, such as Taldor's opulent capital\
  \ Oppara. To others who live upon Golarion, even this ancient metropolis might seem\
  \ young, as the elves have civilizations that date back before Earthfall and dragons\
  \ once ruled in the lands of Tian Xia while humanity was still in its infancy. And\
  \ eons before even these legendary cities had the first stone placed for their foundations,\
  \ there were cities among the planes that had already existed for tens of thousands\
  \ of years. To venture into a planar city is to become part of a living, breathing\
  \ community that has outlived the greatest of empires on Golarion—and perhaps were\
  \ even founded before any living creature graced the surface of that world.</p>\

  \ month sees the release of <a href=\"/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Planar Adventures</i></a>, but there's far more\
  \ to the planes than could ever be covered in a single book. <a href=\"/products/btpya1b8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Realms\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Realms</i></a> offers a closer look at\
  \ six planar cities that characters can visit, either as a jumping point into the\
  \ planes or as adventure locations in their own right. Several previous previews\
  \ have revealed the identities of many of those six cities; some brave adventurers\
  \ may have already set foot in them before.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ before we get into describing the cities and outlining all of their most interesting\
  \ adventure spots, I wanted to offer a more organic impression of these fantastic\
  \ locales. So imagine you have just stepped out of a portal or off of a luxurious\
  \ howdah on the back of an astral whale, and look out onto the superbly illustrated\
  \ vistas that make up your first view of these cities. Or, if you're the less adventurous\
  \ type, imagining opening your mailbox to find a postcard with one of these landscapes\
  \ printed on the front, along with the phrase \"Wish You Were Here!\" Of course,\
  \ <i>which</i> particular landscape is printed on your postcard might give a different\
  \ tone to those words!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/20180613-Dis.jpg\"\
