  \ Paizo's Gen Con Booth</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 16, 2012</p> \n\
  \   <p>This will be my seventeenth Gen Con. The previous 16 Gen Cons I have attended\
  \ all hold different and special memories. From GMing 10 slots of Pathfinder Society,\
  \ to winning the Alternity RPG Open in the late 1990s, to taking my wife and son\
  \ to their first Gen Cons, they all hold a special meaning. One of my fondest memories\
  \ was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, when I was able to get autographs from both Gary\
  \ Gygax and Dave Arneson. As a young 20-something, it was quite the experience to\
  \ meet these two icons of the industry. Much as I was able to meet two industry\
  \ people, and later was able to brag about it to friends who didn't join me that\
  \ year, meeting the people that work in the industry is the highlight of the show\
  \ for many convention-goers.</p> \n   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">This year\
  \ at Gen Con, you will, of course, meet the Paizo celebrities that work our booth\
  \ year after year. Among these will be Jason Bulmahn, James Jacobs, Erik Mona, Sean\
  \ K Reynolds, F. Wesley Schneider, and James L. Sutter. But this year, we'll also\
  \ have several special guests that work with Paizo on various products.</span></p>\
  \ \n   <p>From Goblinworks, the company working to bring Golarion to life at Pathfinder\
  \ Online, Ryan Dancey and Mark Kalmes will make appearances.</p> \n   <div class=\"\
  blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/Logos/GenCon_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>We will also have several of our Pathfinder\
  \ Tales authors hosting meet and greets and signing your novels. Among the authors\
  \ currently scheduled to make appearances are Dave Gross, Howard Andrew Jones, and\
  \ Robin D. Laws.</p> \n   <p>Additionally, Paizo has teamed up with Dynamite Entertainment\
  \ to officially launch the brand new Pathfinder comic book with a special Gen Con-exclusive\
  \ edition of Pathfinder #1 for sale at the Paizo booth. Artist Andrew Huerta and\
  \ writer Jim Zubkavich will also be on hand to meet with fans and reveal new details\
  \ about the monthly comic series.</p> \n   <p>The cast and crew from the films <i>Dorkness\
  \ Rising</i> and <i>The Gamers</i> are planning several appearances at the booth.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>And members of our very own art department, Sarah Robinson and Andrew\
  \ Vallas, will be doing art portfolio reviews throughout the con.</p> \n   <p>All\
  \ in all, that is a great list of guests that are joining us at the Paizo booth\
  \ to round out the show for you and surely make for the most memorable Gen Con yet.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator</i></p> \n \
