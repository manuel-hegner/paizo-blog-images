  \ Defend the Gauntlet!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April 30, 2015</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Just over\
  \ one year ago, a team from Paizo made a pilgrimage to Card Kingdom to do battle\
  \ for the Gauntlet. There we fought for honor, for glory, and most importantly,\
  \ for charity. After facing off against other game companies from around the Seattle\
  \ area, we emerged victorious! The Gauntlet was ours, and it has rested in the hallowed\
  \ halls of Paizo ever since.</p> \n    <p>But now, we must defend it!</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The time has come for Paizo to defend our title. If we fail, we will have to\
  \ give up the Gauntlet, forfeiting our title as champions. We can't let that happen\
  \ and we need your help!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20150430-Gauntlet.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20150430-Gauntlet_360.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Card Kingdom is once again hosting the tournament and each team (and team\
  \ member) can raise money for charity to earn power ups for their team. Last year,\
  \ these advantages were crucial in our victory. The more we raise the more power\
  \ ups we will earn, giving us an edge in the games we must play against the other\
  \ teams. This year, all of the money raised will go to Hopelink, a charity whose\
  \ mission is to support homeless and low-income families on their way to self-sufficiency.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, we want to reward you for supporting us in our quest to defend\
  \ the Gauntlet. So, the Gauntlet team is putting together a special dungeon adventure,\
  \ \"The Champion's Gauntlet,\" and if you pledge at least $20 to our team (any one\
  \ of the team members), you can get access to a PDF of this adventure on your paizo.com\
  \ account later this summer!</p> \n    <p>To receive this PDF, you <b><i>must</i></b>\
  \ use the same email address for the charity site as you use for your paizo.com\
  \ account. We cannot send you the adventure unless you have a paizo.com account\
  \ and you use the same email address! If you need to update your email address,\
  \ you may do so on your <a href=\"https://paizo.com/paizo/account/settings/personal\"\
  >Personal Settings</a> page.</p> \n    <p>As of right now, this will be the only\
  \ way to get your hands on this exclusive adventure! To sweeten the deal, the dungeon\
  \ will grow larger and larger as the team raises more and more money. Here is how\
  \ it will work.</p> \n    <p>Regardless of how much money we raise, all four team\
  \ members (Jason Bulmahn, Erik Mona, Jessica Price, and Stephen Radney-MacFarland)\
  \ will each design one room for the dungeon. Depending on how much the Paizo team\
  \ raises, each team member will design more rooms.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n   \

  \ personal goals. Check out their individual pledge pages for details on some of\
  \ the great thank-you rewards you can score.</p> \n    <p>The fundraising ends at\

  \ House in Bellevue, WA. Donate today and if you are in the area on the 17th, stop\
