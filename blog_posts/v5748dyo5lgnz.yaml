  >The happiest of Halloweens to all of you out there in Previewland! We're a little\
  \ under three weeks from the November 19 release of <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"\
  ><i>The Lost Coast</i></a>, the newest 45-figure <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> set. We've recently simplified our <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>, so if you want to make sure you don't\
  \ miss a single figure setting up a subscription in the next week or so before we\
  \ start shipping them is your best bet. I brought home a case of my own this week,\
  \ and I'm really happy with how the set turned out. The giant <a href=\"/products/btpy96k7\"\
  >Shemhazian Demon Case Incentive</a> figure is fantastic, and the set includes lots\
  \ of other favorites like Lamashtu cultists, Lamashtu herself, and the stupidest\
  \ (and I mean that in a GREAT way) Hill Giant Chieftain ever created in prepainted\
  \ plastic. I think you guys are really going to enjoy this one.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-HillGiant.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-HillGiant_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>But we're not here today to talk about <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"\
  ><i>The Lost Coast</i></a>! Instead, let's cast our minds forward to March 2015\
  \ to take a look at the second half of figures included in <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\"\
  ><i>Iconic Heroes Set #3</i></a>. <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgn6\">Last week's\
  \ preview</a> revealed the first three iconic heroes in the set, Alhazra the oracle,\
  \ Damiel the alchemist, and Alain the cavalier.</p> \n     <p>This week, we've got\
  \ three more figures from the set.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Imrijka.jpg\"> <img\
  \ src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Imrijka_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Let's start off this week's preview with Imrijka, Half-Orc\
  \ Inquisitor! Imrijka has proven to be one of the most popular iconic characters\
  \ introduced in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>.\
  \ Outside of the iconics from the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>\
  \ and the amazingly popular witch, I tend to notice community-produced images of\
  \ Imrijka more than almost any of our other iconics. As a lot of these images are\
  \ of a decidedly adult nature, I assume we somehow tapped into the world's need\
  \ for a decent-looking orc. (How's <i>THAT</i> for a Halloween shudder?) Whatever\
  \ the reason, she's here to stay, and her new miniature looks fantastic.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Balazar.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Balazar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>And here's Balazar, Gnome Summoner. Balazar is a fun\
  \ little guy who always has a trick up his sleeve. I wrote Balazar's <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfnj\">Meet the Iconics backstory</a>, and I've had a soft\
  \ spot for him ever since. Our design team is currently at work revising Balazar's\
  \ class, the summoner, for spring's <a href=\"/products/btpy97vo\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Unchained</i></a> hardcover, so expect to see a bit more of him in the near future.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Padrig.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Padrig_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Balazar is just a weird little gnome without his best\
  \ buddy, the eidolon Padrig. Padrig can change his shape according to Balazar's\
  \ will, and the two have been inseparable ever since they met many decades ago.\
  \ As a representative of a creature type with no particular permanent shape, Padrig\
  \ also works great for just about any weird monster you might want to throw at your\
  \ players. Note the clear effect at his base. Cool!</p> \n     <p>All six figures\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\"><i>Iconic Heroes Set #3</i></a> come with a\
  \ unique card for use with the <a href=\"/pfacg\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>\
  \ that will be available ONLY in these special sets.</p> \n     <p>And that's it\
  \ for this week. Enjoy the spooky holiday, and we'll see you back next week for\
  \ a look at something REALLY SCARY!</p> \n     <p>Until then,</p> \n     <p>Erik\
