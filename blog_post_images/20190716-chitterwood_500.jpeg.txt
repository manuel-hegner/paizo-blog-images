| summary  = A path through deep, old woods. It appears to be night time. In the foreground right, a pair of females in cloaks are tucked away behind large tree roots, staring in horror at the path where a string of undead with arrows in their abdomens, are being attacked by torch-wielding goblins. The undead in the foreground has a gleeful goblin sitting on its shoulders, legs wrapped around the undeadâ€™s neck as it tries to light fire to its head.
