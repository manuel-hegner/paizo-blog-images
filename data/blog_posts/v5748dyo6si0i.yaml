  \ was I? Oh, yes! I shudder to think why anyone would enjoy learning about those\
  \ Knights of Lastwall do-gooders. If you ask me, they’re a bunch of losers who don’\

  \ advisor to the Knights of Lastwall and paladin of Iomedae by Ekaterina Burmak.\
  \ So, right away you know this will be written from a very different perspective\
  \ than say, Geb’s latest, the Book of the Dead. The style is very “pro-living,”\
