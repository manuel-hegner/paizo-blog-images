  \   </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">A cool autumn breeze\
  \ blew across the woodlands, its scent carrying the promise of snow that was, for\
  \ now, still trapped in distant mountains. The wind rustled leaves across the ground,\
  \ shaking a few remaining bits of gold and crimson foliage from their branches.\
  \ Birds sang in the background, but the clearing was otherwise silent, except for…\
  </p>\n      <p>“Amiri, can you please lie still,” Seelah’s voice was firm, and only\
  \ a touch strained, “for just a few minutes more? Once I have finished the rite\
  \ of the blade, I can heal you again, and then recite the prayer of—”</p>\n    \
  \  <p>“I’m <em>fine</em>.” Amiri’s voice was laced with frustration. “You don’t\
  \ need to finish any rites, and I certainly don’t want to wait for one of your endless\
  \ prayers. I don’t need any more healing than you’ve already provided, Seelah. I’\
  m ready to take on whatever else is out here.”</p>\n      <p>Seelah shook her head\
  \ and continued her rite. She had already cleaned her longsword with the eleven\
  \ small cloths she carried for that purpose and now needed to put it all away mindfully,\
  \ treating the cloths and her sword with the honor and respect they deserved as\
  \ instruments of justice.</p>\n      <p>“We don’t know that, because we don’t know\
  \ what’s out here.” Seelah kept her tone even and her eyes focused on what she was\
  \ doing. “Certainly, more giant ticks like that one,” she indicated the two halves\
  \ of the monstrous insect that had attached itself to Amiri before the duo had cut\
  \ it apart, “could have either killed the hunting party or sickened them enough\
  \ they can’t make it back to the village. But they’re locals, and the villagers\
  \ called these ticks a common threat; I wouldn’t expect a well-equipped party of\
  \ four men and two hunting dogs to have been overwhelmed so easily.”</p>\n     \
  \ <p>Amiri shrugged but managed to lie still, screwing her eyes shut to block out\
  \ distractions. “All true,” Amiri said, “but no one and nothing likes ticks—especially\
  \ ticks the size of badger-hounds. So, since they thrive here, these woods are unlikely\
  \ to have anything tougher than them in them, or that <em>tougher thing</em> would\
  \ have killed off the ticks. It’s one reason I insisted on coming and checking this\
  \ hunting trail while the others waste time looking through the village records.”\
  </p>\n      <p>Seelah tried to suppress a smile.</p>\n      <p>“Yes, and since you\
  \ insisted on coming out here, someone had to come with you in case you needed backup.\
  \ And as your backup, I want you fully healed before we get any deeper into the\
  \ woods.” Seelah carefully placed her ritual kit next to her backpack, then laid\
  \ her sword on the ground within arm’s reach. “Now, are you going to allow me to\
  \ ensure you are at your best?”</p>\n      <p>Amiri took a deep breath and forced\
  \ herself to relax.</p>\n      <p>“Oh, go ahead. We might as well, at this point.”\
  </p>\n      <p>Seelah knelt next to her ally and placed her left hand over where\
  \ the vile tick had dug into Amiri and begun draining her blood. “<em>Inheritor</em>,”\
  \ Seelah prayed silently, “<em>please heal this mighty warrior whom I have seen\
  \ face the greatest foes with valor, and ready her to stand against injustice in\
  \ all its forms</em>.”</p>\n      <p>A golden light formed around Seelah’s hand\
  \ and silently poured into Amiri’s remaining wounds like glowing, liquid amber.\
  \ The puncture mark from the tick’s attack, already half closed from Seelah’s first\
  \ effort at healing it, disappeared entirely, leaving no sign the wound had ever\
  \ existed. Amiri’s eyes popped open, and she grinned at Seelah.</p>\n      <div\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>“Right, now let’s get the rest of the way up\
  \ the trail and—”</p>\n      <p>Seelah shook her head.</p>\n      <p>“I know I’\
  ve already strained your patience, Amiri, but if you just wait a little longer,\
  \ I can—”</p>\n      <p>“Shh!” Amiri interrupted, holding up a finger. “Listen.”\
  </p>\n      <p>Seelah stopped talking and cocked her head to pick up whatever noise\
  \ Amiri had heard. The woods were filled with susurrant shuffling, the sound of\
  \ dead leaves brushing over thick grass and, farther away, bird noises that seemed\
  \ more like short, concerned chirps rather than the songs they’d been singing earlier.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Seelah shook her head. “Other than some bird sounds, I don’t hear anything\
  \ but the rustling of leaves.”</p>\n      <p>Amiri stood, lifting her enormous sword\
  \ into a ready stance. “Yes, the leaves are rustling… but the wind has died.”</p>\n\
  \      <p>Seelah’s eyes widened in realization, and she quickly turned to strap\
  \ her shield firmly to her forearm. Amiri was right, of course: the wind had stopped,\
  \ but the sound of rustling leaves was growing louder and closer. Amiri leaped off\
  \ the ground, already ten paces ahead by the time Seelah was standing and fully\
  \ ready, but she swiftly stopped her advance, large sword held high as she peered\
  \ into a dark copse of trees that seemed to be the source of the rustling. Seelah\
  \ knew her eyes were not as keen as Amiri’s, and she carefully glanced around them\
  \ as she closed the distance to her companion. It would not do to be caught unaware\
  \ if a threat attacked from another direction.</p>\n      <p>From the dense woods\
  \ to the side of the hunting trail, figures shambled toward them. Three were humanoid\
  \ in shape, but moved with a slow, unsteady gait. As they stumbled into the light,\
  \ their faces came into view, showing rictus grins and sagging, yellowed flesh.\
  \ The arms and legs of each were twisted and curled, as if locked in awkward positions\
  \ they could only barely control.</p>\n      <p>Beside the shuffling corpses, two\
  \ smaller figures moved jerkily forward, crawling on all fours. Once, they had clearly\
  \ been hunting dogs, but jagged wounds ran the length of one’s ribcage, and the\
  \ other’s throat was missing. Both had blank, white eyes.</p>\n      <p>Amri turned\
  \ to Seelah, her nose wrinkled in distaste.</p>\n      <p>“What in iron are those?!”\
  </p>\n      <p>Seelah’s expression darkened. “Zombies. Freshly risen, from the looks\
  \ of them.”</p>\n      <p>“But zombie… dogs?!” It was clear from Amiri’s tone that\
  \ she felt such abominations were worse than the bipedal undead shambling along\
  \ beside them.</p>\n      <p>Seelah nodded grimly. “Anything living can be perverted\
  \ to undeath one way or another. This is almost certainly the missing hunting party.\
  \ Whatever killed them visited this further indignity upon their corpses, an indignity\
  \ I will not allow to go unche—”</p>\n      <p>Amiri bellowed a challenge, charging\
  \ the nearest zombie hound. Seelah knew that cry and the expression of pure fury\
  \ on Amiri’s face.</p>\n      <p>There would be no retreat in this battle.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Amiri’s charge brought her to within reach of the zombies, and a single\
  \ swing of her massive sword felled one of the undead hounds. Seelah rushed to protect\
  \ Amiri’s flank as the zombies clumsily surrounded her companion. Their slow movement\
  \ kept the undead from overwhelming Amiri, but the remaining zombie hound bit at\
  \ Amiri’s boot and tried to pull her to the ground.</p>\n      <p>Seelah hefted\
  \ her shield as she reached the once-dog,. She slashed it with her own sword, watching\
  \ as the blade peeled its flesh apart as easily as a canvas sail. Amiri was exchanging\
  \ blows with the zombie hunters, and just as the undead hound collapsed, one of\
  \ them caught her with a powerful blow to her chin. Blood flew, and Seelah whispered\
  \ a hasty prayer to Iomedae to lessen the attack while ducking under Amiri’s massive\
  \ sword to split the zombie’s skull with her gleaming longsword.</p>\n      <p>A\
  \ fist smashed Seelah’s shield, cracking the wood and bruising her arm, but then\
  \ suddenly there was only one zombie left. Seelah deflected another blow with her\
  \ shield, then she and Amiri struck it as one, dropping the corpse back to the earth,\
  \ skewered and sliced by the pair’s steel.</p>\n      <p>Seelah saw Amiri scanning\
  \ the woods and trusted her to be alert for any danger, while the paladin ensured\
  \ all the undead were truly destroyed.</p>\n      <p>“Well, ticks didn’t do that,”\
  \ said Amiri.</p>\n      <p>“No,” Seelah agreed. “Whatever created these horrors\
  \ is either new to the area or willing to make itself known in a way it hasn’t before.\
  \ Unless it has, which is a thing that might be recorded in the village’s records.”\
  </p>\n      <p>Amiri frowned, then nodded. “All right, so we should go back and\
  \ see if the others have found anything. Right after we take whatever time you need\
  \ to heal us both. But I’m going to stay standing this time.”</p>\n      <p>Seelah\
  \ began unstrapping her shield, assessing the damage it had sustained during the\
  \ fighting in the process. “And why is that?”</p>\n      <p>Amiri grinned grimly.\
  \ “Because the villagers said four hunters went missing, and this only accounts\
  \ for three.”</p>\n      <p>A cold wind blew from the woods, bringing a chill that\
  \ no longer felt tied to any natural season.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n     <p style=\"\
