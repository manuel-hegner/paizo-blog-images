  description\">Welcome to another edition of the Friday Publisher Preview, and another\
  \ look at November's <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>\
  \ set of prepainted plastic gaming figures! Before we get to this week's reveals,\
  \ I'd like to update everyone on the status of our popular <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  >Pathfinder Iconic Heroes</a> sets. The first three sets are currently available,\
  \ and ever since they hit shelves, people have been asking for more! I'm happy to\
  \ report that WizKids has just announced official release dates for <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes Set #4</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9p\"><em>Iconic\
  \ Heroes Set #5</em></a>, which will be released in November and January, respectively.\
  \ We're also at work on a Set #6 (and possibly more beyond that!), but we're not\
  \ quite ready to announce release dates, yet.</p> \n    <p>I'll have nice images\
  \ of the figures from these sets here on the blog over the next couple weeks, but\
  \ until then, let's take a look at three more figures from <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \ <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150710-GhoulHuntsman.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150710-GhoulHuntsman_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Ghoul Huntsman, inspired by the ghoul\
  \ stalker art on page 82 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\"><em>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Monster Codex</em></a>. GMs often overlook ranged combatants when it comes to\
  \ undead hordes, and we wanted to make sure we had a figure that could help! This\
  \ is the third of four ghoul figures in <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty\
  \ Dragon Inn</em></a>, so there are even more to come! The Ghoul Huntsman is a Medium,\
  \ common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150710-RidingDog.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150710-RidingDog_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last week we revealed a <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhoj\"\
  >draft horse</a>, and we're not yet finished with the set's beasts of burden. Here\
  \ we have a handsome Riding Dog for all your Small heroes. I'm looking to see some\
  \ interesting gradients and stuff on the final paint job for this figure that don't\
  \ quite come out in the digital sculpt, but I really like the looks of this figure\
  \ and am glad to add it to the line. The Riding Dog is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150710-HalfElfBard.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150710-HalfElfBard_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally today we have the gorgeous Half-Elf Bard figure,\
  \ straight from the cover (and page 29) of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG NPC Codex</em></a>. She's great as an adventurer OR an NPC entertainer, and\
  \ pairs perfectly with the Dancing Girl figure we showed off a few weeks back. I\
  \ remember a day when literally the only bard figure available anywhere was a lute-playing\
  \ metal Ral Partha figure with a big floppy hat. We've come a long way since then!\
  \ The Half-Elf Bard is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And with that, I'm off\
  \ on a couple of days of vacation back to the ancestral homeland of Minneapolis,\
  \ Minnesota. I'll be back next Friday with a look at some of the fantastic Iconic\
  \ Heroes figures yet to come!</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain,</p> \n    <p>Erik\
