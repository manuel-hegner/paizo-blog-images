  \ a break from my current design challenges to tackle some frequently asked questions\
  \ from our files. We've got some bigger issues to tackle soon, but these are a start.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b><i>Ultimate Combat</i> seems to imply that the\
  \ Totem Warrior archetype (from the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>) allows you to\
  \ take more than one type of totem rage powers. Is this an erratum for the Totem\
  \ Warrior archetype?</b></p> \n     <p>No, the line in <i>Ultimate Combat</i> is\
  \ in error. We will get that fixed in the next printing. Until then, the restriction\
  \ on only taking totem rage powers from one group remains in place.</p> \n     <p><b>When\
  \ you cast a spell that allows you to make a ranged touch attack, such as scorching\
  \ ray, and an enemy is within reach, do you provoke two attacks of opportunity?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Yes, you provoke two attacks of opportunity, one for casting the spell\
  \ and one for making a ranged attack, since these are two separate events. As a\
  \ note, since all of the rays are fired simultaneously (in the case of <i>scorching\
  \ ray</i>), you would only provoke one attack of opportunity for making the ranged\
  \ attack, even if you fired more than one ray.</p> \n     <p><b>The Greater Trip\
  \ feat allows you to take an attack of opportunity against a foe that you trip.\
  \ The Vicious Stomp feat allows you to take an attack of opportunity against a foe\
  \ that falls prone adjacent to you. If you have both these feats and trip a foe,\
  \ do you get to make two attacks of opportunity (assuming that you can)?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Yes, the two triggering acts are similar here but they are different.\
  \ One occurs when you trip a foe. The other occurs when a foe falls prone. It requires\
  \ a large number of feats to accomplish, but you can really pile on the attacks\
  \ with this combination.</p> \n     <p><b>Does the <i>ring of continuation</i> (<i>Ultimate\
  \ Equipment</i>, page 168) allow you to cast <i>time stop</i> with a duration of\
  \ 24 hours?</b></p> \n     <p>This item has had some unintended consequences and\
  \ needs a fix. Change the second sentence of the description to read as follows:\
  \ \"Whenever the wearer of the ring casts a spell with a range of personal and a\
  \ duration of 10 minutes per level or greater, that spell remains in effect for\
  \ 24 hours or until the wearer casts another spell with a range of personal (whichever\
  \ comes first).\"</p> \n     <p><b><i>Charm person</i> makes a humanoid \"friendly\"\
  \ to you, as per the rules found in the Diplomacy skill, but it also allows you\
  \ to issue orders to the target, making an opposed Charisma check to convince the\
  \ target to do something that it would not normally do. How does that work?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>The <i>charm person</i> spell (and <i>charm monster</i> by extension)\
  \ makes the target your friend. It will treat you kindly (although maybe not your\
  \ allies) and will generally help you as long as your interests align. This is mostly\
  \ in the purview of the GM. If you ask the creature to do something that it would\
  \ not normally do (in relation to your friendship), that is when the opposed Charisma\
  \ check comes into play. For example, if you use <i>charm person</i> to befriend\
  \ an orc, the orc might share his grog with you and talk with you about the upcoming\
  \ raid on a nearby settlement. If you asked him to help you fight some skeletons,\
  \ he might very well lend a hand. If you asked him to help you till a field, however,\
  \ you might need to make that check to convince him to do it.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>That about wraps it up for this week. Keep those questions coming.</p>\
