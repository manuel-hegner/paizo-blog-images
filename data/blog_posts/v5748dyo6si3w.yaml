  \ \n      <p>I’m incredibly proud of my work on <em>Dark Archive</em>, including\
  \ the Rumored Cryptid adjustment (page 61), \"The Beast of Birchfrost\" cryptid\
  \ adventure (pages 66–71; turn to page 69 to see pictures of my son), “Tempting\
  \ Curses” (page 162) and “Bargained Contracts” (page 164). During the design process,\
  \ I spent a good amount of time at my local library flipping through folktales.\
  \ One difficulty with writing concepts based in folklore is avoiding appropriation,\
  \ as there are a number of tales and creatures that get presented as universal but\
  \ actually have specific cultural origins. I worked hard to make my pieces feel\
  \ like they could've come from real world folklore without appropriating.</p> \n\
  \      <p>This work challenged me in ways that made me grow as a designer. It was\
  \ my first time working on a Pathfinder hardcover book and focusing on mechanical\
  \ options instead of adventures. I'm excited to see it in everyone's hands at this\
  \ point. I'm particularly eager to see how people use this work in the future, as\
  \ I love the collaborative nature of tabletop games.</p> \n      <p>If you want\
  \ to hear more from me, you can find me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rigbeesknees\"\
  >@rigbeesknees</a> or check out my work in the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Travel\
  \ Guide</em>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> \n      <p>Hi, I’\
  m Jessica Catalan! I’m the current Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance\
  \ author who writes a whole lot of words for Pathfinder and Starfinder! For <em>Dark\
  \ Archive</em>, I wrote the Experimental Cryptid adjustment on page 60, “Time (Oracle\
  \ Mystery)” on page 188, and “Hazards of Perception” on pages 122–125. <em>Dark\
  \ Archive</em> is a weird, wild, and wonderful book and I’m beyond proud to be a\
  \ part of it!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Banana Chan (she/they/he)</h3> \n   \
  \   <p>Hi! I'm Banana and I'm a game designer and screenwriter. When I was asked\
  \ to write for <em>Dark Archive</em>, I was ecstatic (but I tried very hard to stay\
  \ cool so I wouldn't embarrass myself). I wrote the rituals and the adventure “\
  The Verdure of Iblydos” on page 148. Please note, I'm not a licensed psychologist\
  \ or psychiatrist, I've just done a lot of research for this adventure (this is\
  \ for any other fans of the podcast <em>Cults</em>). The big inspiration points\
  \ for me (other than the <em>Cults</em> podcast), were folk horror movies, such\
  \ as <em>The Empty Man</em>, <em>The Invitation</em>, <em>The Wicker Man</em>, <em>The\
  \ Blood on Satan's Claw</em> and (of course) <em>Midsommar</em> and how new age\
  \ beliefs currently operate. The cult leader, Mother Mitera, is specifically inspired\
  \ by Nine Perfect Strangers, Goop, and Teal Swan.</p> \n      <br> \n      <br clear=\"\

  \ I’m Michael W. Jacobs—the so-called “evil” twin of Jacob W. Michaels, or so “\
  they” would have you believe. But I ask, is it evil to expose you to the Echoing\
  \ Pale? Would it not be worse to leave you in the dark, ignorant to all the lurking\
  \ dangers blending in with the rest of us on Golarion? What if you didn’t know?\
  \ What if you didn’t have to always be looking over your shoulder, wondering why\
  \ the merchant you’ve worked with for years now scowls when you enter her shop?\
  \ That casual greeting—just a friendly passer-by, or someone who thinks they know\
  \ you, for some reason you can’t figure out? What if? (Evil twin aside, I’m actually\
  \ Jacob W. Michaels, regular Paizo freelancer. I got to do the intro to Mirrors\
  \ and Imposters section on page 116 of <em>Dark Archive</em>. It was a blast, and\
  \ I hope it gives you something to reflect on.)</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Andrew\
  \ Mullen</h3> \n      <p>Hello, Andrew Mullen here! My contribution to this book\
  \ is the Mutant Cryptid template on page 59. Want to spice up a monster by making\
  \ it weak to the memory of the taste of borscht, or some even more bizarre phenomena?\
  \ I've got you covered! I've always enjoyed monster design, so I was very glad to\
  \ offer ways GMs can make stranger adversaries.</p> \n      <p>Beyond this, I'm\
  \ involved in two other projects of note. Alongside Mikhail Rekun (who you may recognize\
  \ from the <em>Dark Archive</em> cover!) and Isabelle Thorne (who you may recognize\
  \ from the <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em> cover!), I'm a key member of\
  \ the Luminant Age team. Luminant Age is a third-party campaign setting for Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition, a post-apocalyptic world of strange faiths, strange magics, and\
  \ stranger creatures. You can find us at <a href=\"http://luminant-age.itch.io\"\

  \ Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m one of the cover authors for <em>Dark Archive</em>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>I’ve always been interested in what one might call “Weird History.”\
  \ As a historian, I mostly deal with formal, scholarly research and education—I\
  \ even have a book, <em>How Russia Lost Bulgaria, 1878-1886: Empire Unguided</em>\
  \ (Lexington Books, 2018). After hours though, I’d go down Fortean rabbit-holes\
  \ like the Eilean Mor disappearances or the Philadelphia Experiment. So, when James\
  \ Case asked if I wanted my name on the cover of the <em>Dark Archive</em>, well,\
  \ I could hardly turn him down now, could I?</p> \n      <p>I wrote the lore sections\
  \ for the Secret Societies (page 74), Deviant Abilities (page 94), and Curses and\
  \ Pacts (page 156) sections, as well as “The Sacral King” incident report (combining\
  \ Emperor Norton I of America with the Fisher King concept, for you Weird History\
  \ fans) and the “Wishes in Krasnoprudny” adventure, along with several mechanical\
  \ tidbits here and there.</p> \n      <p>If you like what you see here, I’m also\
  \ the creative director of the Luminant Age project, a Weird Swashbuckler setting\
  \ currently working on fulfilling our second Kickstarter. If you're fond of chimeric\

  \ Second Edition.</p> \n      <p>In <em>Dark Archive</em>, I wrote an assortment\
  \ of different pieces, the foremost among them being the thaumaturge class on page\

  \ reflection versatile heritage (page 119), apocryphal domain spells (page 142),\
  \ and the sleepwalker archetype (page 206). The question of what's considered \"\
  weird\" or \"mysterious\" in a setting with established magic and supernatural abilities\
  \ has always been one that's interested me (what exists on the margins of a fantastical\
  \ world?), and <em>Dark Archive</em> was a great opportunity to explore that. Getting\
  \ these sections was really cool to work on, since at one point or another, I've\
  \ written stories about both mirror people and dream magic. The apocryphal domain\
  \ spells were also a fun challenge, as I tried to come up with more metaphorical\
  \ or abstract associations with the usual domains. I hope people enjoy these new\
  \ character options! You can find me (and cat pictures) at Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KendraLS\"\
