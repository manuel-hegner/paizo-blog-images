  \ I got back from PaizoCon Oz, I keep looking at our blog schedule for an opportunity\
  \ to write of my travels and share some of the photos I took at the event. That\
  \ there hasn't been a gap testifies to how much is going on in the realm of organized\
  \ play. So, I'm going to share a couple of photos today and I promise to give a\
  \ full account of my travels next week.</p> \n    <h2>Extra Life</h2> \n    <p>Paizo\
  \ is a major partner with Extra Life this year. Extra Life is a charity that raises\
  \ funds for local Children's Hospitals. We have a Super Team and welcome anyone\
  \ that wishes to help raise money for the kids. <a href=\"https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&amp;teamID=35870\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">You can find our team page here.</a> Feel free to make an account\
  \ and join our efforts!</p> \n    <p>As part of our fundraising efforts, we will\
  \ be live-streaming games the 25 hours of the Extra Life event. Starting at 10:00\
  \ AM Saturday and running through 10:00 AM Sunday, you can watch Paizo staffers\
  \ and a few guests roll their dice, move their mice, and hope no one gets hurt.\
  \ Organized play events start at 2:00 AM Pacific standard time with a PFS scenario\
  \ brought to us by the local Seattle Venture-Officers and GMs. From 6:00-10:00 AM\
  \ Pacific standard time, John Compton takes the helm to run a Starfinder Scenario.\
  \ Tune in to watch our scenarios and help with the hijinks. Visit <a href=\"https://go.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">our Twitch stream</a> to watch the event and qualify for the\
  \ chance to earn special prizes, such as limited edition boons, Paizo books, a Gen\
  \ Con badge, and more.</p> \n    <p>Participating in the live stream event gives\
  \ the Paizo organized play team an opportunity to reveal another way in which we're\
  \ distributing race boons: via online events. From this weekend, when an organized\
  \ play team member appears on a podcast, streamed charity event, or other online\
  \ public appearance, they'll bring a few boons with them. Which boons, you ask?\
  \ How about <b>Ghorans</b> (for Pathfinder Society) and <b>Skittermanders</b> (for\
  \ Starfinder Society)! To whet your interest in these boons, please note that <em>Ultimate\
  \ Wilderness</em> (releasing in November) features new options for Ghorans. I encourage\
  \ you to join John, Thurston, myself, and a few other staffers from 6:00-10:00 AM\
  \ Pacific standard time this Sunday when we're giving away the first of these via\
  \ raffle. We are working on the method of disbursement, which will most likely involve\
  \ a $20 donation to Extra Life and some variety of raffle, but regardless of dispersal\
  \ method, you must be logged in and watching to win.</p> \n    <p>In addition to\
  \ the Paizo live-stream, there are quite a few other conventions running events\
  \ for Extra Life as well. So the organized play team decided to encourage the spirit\
  \ of generosity by shaking things up a bit. The following modifications to Society\
  \ rules apply for any games played at a venue supporting Extra between November\
  \ 2 and November 6, 2017.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>The Retail Incentive Program\
  \ applies for all locations, regardless of whether the event takes place in a location\
  \ selling items. Monies donated to Extra Life qualify as purchases for the program,\
  \ regardless of whether donated by players, GMs, or spectators.</li> \n     <li>We've\
  \ sent a special Extra Life boon to locations running events. This boon is eligible\
  \ for dispersal to players the same way other boons are available or to anyone who\
  \ makes a $10 or more donation to Extra Life.</li> \n     <li>Spectators may donate\
  \ money to Extra Life and change up the action of the game, as long as it does not\
  \ modify the adventure mechanics or the GMs ability to run the adventure as written.\
  \ So make the players talk in funny voices, dance a jig at the table, or swap character\
  \ sheets with a neighbor.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Don't forget to check out our\
  \ Twitch stream and root for Paizo and its partners in our quest of helping sick\
  \ children.</p> \n    <h2>Online Organized Play</h2> \n    <p>Over the past two\
  \ years, the numbers of GMs running games in the aether doubled, then doubled again\
  \ and is continuing to grow at lightening pace. Players with mobility issues, or\
  \ in remote locations, or on non-traditional schedules, are joining the online games\
  \ as a way to connect with other players and experience organized play. Paizo's\
  \ partnerships with online VTT platforms and hosting of Play-by-Post games on its\
  \ forums support player opportunities for online gaming. For these reasons, and\
  \ to keep up with the growing demands on the organizers' time and energy, we are\
  \ expanding the team. It is our great pleasure to announce the creation of an eleventh\
  \ region—the Online region, under the guidance of Jesse Davis, also known as Ironhelixx.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>One of the biggest changes in the online region is the addition of Pathfinder\
  \ Society Adventure Card Guild play. Stemming from our playtests of the various\
  \ base sets, we are looking to introduce more players to the Society based stories\
  \ of the Season of Faction's Favor and Season of Plundered Tombs, the swashbuckling\
  \ adventures of the Season of the Shackles, the holy fury contained in the Season\
  \ of the Righteous, the virtues and sins of the Season of the Runelords and the\
  \ fire and chaos of Season of the Goblins. If you want to experience the fun of\
  \ the card game, but haven't had a group near you, this may well be your answer.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Both the Retail Support Program and the Regional Support Program will\
  \ have online components. We are currently fleshing out the details and will post\
  \ them in the next few weeks. It is a balancing act, as we don't want to deny the\
  \ online players the benefits of the programs, but we don't want to negate the benefits\
  \ for physical locations either. At this time we are soliciting feedback for how\
  \ to integrate these programs. If you have ideas, feel free to send them to me at\
  \ <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a></p> \n\
  \    <p>To assist Jesse, we are promoting three people to the position of Venture-Captain.\
  \ Each will oversee one aspect of online play. Please welcome the following individuals\
  \ to the VC ranks:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Venture-Captain—PbP</b>:\
  \ Hilary Moon-Murphy<br> <b>Venture-Captain—ACG</b>: Tyler Beck<br> <b>Venture-Captain—\
  VTT</b>: James Bartlett</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Rounding out the team are\
  \ the Venture-Lieutenants and Venture-Agents: Gerard van Konijnenburg, Phillip Wood,\
  \ Christine Bussman, Sylvain Corbaz, Michael Hallet. Andrew Warner, Richard Lowe,\
  \ Helen Yau, and Hannes Schunk. Contact information for the above listed individuals,\
  \ as well as all volunteers, is available on <a href=\"/organizedplay/coordinators\"\
  >the Coordinators Page</a>.</p> \n    <p>We are always looking for more volunteers,\
  \ both online and around the globe. If you are interested in helping organize games\
  \ and joining the ranks of the Venture-Officers, please email me with your location\
  \ and area of interest at <a href=\"mailto:tonya.woldridge@organizedplayfoundation.org\"\
  >tonya.woldridge@organizedplayfoundation.org</a> to open a discussion.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Thank you to the team of volunteers helping spin up the new region and to\
  \ all the Venture-Officers worldwide, without whom we would not have an organized\
  \ play program.</p> \n    <h2>DIY Terrain Contest</h2> \n    <p>Last August, we\
  \ asked GMs to submit their best <b>DIY Terrain</b> photos. The four submissions\
  \ below impressed us and we couldn't choose between them, so we are posting them\
  \ all and asking you to choose a winner. Please give them a good look over and vote\
  \ for your favorite!</p> \n    <p>We will leave the polls open for 2 weeks and announce\
  \ the winner on November 22nd.</p> \n    <table class=\"table-spacing-large\" style=\"\

  \ turn of the seasons, the convention pace slows down a bit, but continues to provide\
  \ many opportunities for GMs to run games. Several of those GMs completed their\
  \ 5-star requirements. These include running 150 games, of which at least 50 must\
  \ be unique scenarios and 10 be special scenarios. These requirements don't include\
  \ the hours spent preparing their scenarios or gathering their supplies. The time\
  \ needed to reach 5* is well over 600 hours! To those listed below, who earned their\
  \ 5th star over the past few weeks, welcome to the club and thank you for your dedication\
  \ to our Society.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Matt Hill</li> \n     <li>James Hines</li>\
