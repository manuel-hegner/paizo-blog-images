  ><em>PFS2 #5-16: A Lie Told to Strangers</em></a></h3>\n      <p>Hi, I’m Alison\
  \ Cybe (they/them), and this year I’ve created <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-02:\
  \ The Blackwood Lost</em>and <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-16: A Lie Told to\
  \ Strangers</em>. If you didn’t like them, I’m sorry, I’m to blame. If you did,\
  \ feel free to let me know. Both of these adventures deal with people in risk or\
  \ dangers and cast the characters with their rescue. I didn’t want to brush too\
  \ far beyond what is generally comfortable for people with these, as they’re my\
  \ first step in creating Pathfinder adventures for folks, given that my history\
  \ is much more in Starfinder. But at the same time, my writing style for adventures\
  \ tends to emphasize a big range of diverse NPCs who I hope will remain memorable\
  \ for players, interesting and unusual landscapes, and some dramatic punch here\
  \ and there. I hope some of the work I’ve created has been able to entertain at\
  \ least a few of you at some points. Anyway, you can find me on most social media\
  \ sites under my name, so don’t be afraid to say hello.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Hilary\

  ><em>PFS2 #5-03: Heidmarch Heist</em></a></h3>\n      <p>Hello all, I'm Hmm. <em>Heidmarch\
  \ Heist</em> originated when Josh Foster came up with the idea of a theft at Heidmarch\
  \ Manor. Designing the mystery for this adventure was just plain fun. I spent time\
  \ considering how to cater to both the hard-core mystery buffs and the potentially\
  \ clueless, so the mystery includes ample handouts and a chance to explore. I had\
  \ so much fun writing this overall, that I could not pick out a favorite bit. I'll\
  \ leave that as an exercise for readers of this blog (under spoilers, of course!).</p>\n\

  ><em>PFS2 #5-08: Protecting the Firelight</em></a></h3>\n      <p>Hi everyone, I’\
  m Jacob W. Michaels (he/him), the author of PFS Year 5’s <em>Protecting the Firelight</em>,\
  \ which was my first repeatable scenario. I had so much fun trying to create as\
  \ many variations as I could, and I literally can’t figure out how many times you\
  \ could play this without repeating the scenario exactly (seriously, I remember\
  \ learning the mathematical formulas back in high school, but that knowledge has\
  \ been pushed out of my brain by Pathfinder encounter math). I was thrilled developer\
  \ Shay Snow, who’s of Indigenous heritage, entrusted me with this piece, which had\
  \ a number of Native themes. I really enjoyed diving into the research—the foods\
  \ that may get prepared during one part of the adventure are all based on real Native\
  \ dishes, as are other aspects of the traditional ritual—and working with Shay to\
  \ come up with a villain that evoked a legend from their culture. I also paid homage\
  \ to a friend and fellow Pathfinder player who died unexpectedly days before I began\
  \ working on the adventure. And finally, a pre-teen NPC evokes my niece and nephew\
  \ and all the wonderfully assertive children of the world! Thanks as always to Paizo\
  \ for letting me play in their world, and to everyone who enjoys the adventures\
  \ we create.</p>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n      <table class=\"image\" align=\"\

  ><em>PFS2 #5-15: Cleansing the Flame</em></a></h3>\n      <p>Hey all, I'm Isis Wozniakowska\
  \ (she/her), and I wrote <em>Cleansing the Flame</em>. Personally, I'm super proud\
  \ of it and have a great time running for cons whenever I get the chance, as I've\
  \ always had a particular enjoyment of orc cultures and how they've been written\
  \ in second edition. And I'm especially excited to see a new era of orc gods going\
  \ forward from here into Godsrain. One thing I really wanted to show in this adventure\
  \ is how orcs can have a culture built up around the importance of strength and\
  \ combat and how displaying that to others is such a major part of it, but to do\
  \ so in such a way that isn't inherently tied to a toxic culture of survival of\
  \ the fittest like was previously shown in orcs before. And as someone who struggles\
  \ treating an occasionally debilitating autoimmune disease these days, several parts\
  \ of the adventure (many of which I won't spoil for those of you who haven't played\
  \ it) are things I was particularly excited to learn I would be able to portray\
  \ for everyone. Organized Play also just means a lot to me in general, and I spend\
  \ a lot of time running my own local event and popping into various cons online\
  \ and locally. I hope you all enjoy it, and I hope you'll see me around at various\
  \ online cons occasionally running it for people.</p>\n      <p>I'm not on social\
  \ media as much as I used to be since I went back to grad school, but you can find\
  \ me on BlueSky as @wozenstein, but mostly I lurk on there and Insta. I don't have\
  \ any upcoming personal projects, but I can always use the support in trying to\
  \ get through my Comparative Literature MA. I study Italian literature, primarily\
  \ medieval and Renaissance, and currently am looking at the relationship between\
  \ medieval literature and modern fantasy literature (including looking at TTRPGs\
  \ as a form of literary study).</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Brite Cheney (he/they)</h3>\n\

  ><em>PFS2 Quest #16: The Winter Queen’s Dollhouse</em></a></h3>\n      <p>The pitch\
  \ to me for <em>The </em><em>Winter Queen’s Dollhouse</em> was “poppets trapped\
  \ in a dollhouse that get awakened.” From there, I thought the most fun would be\
  \ a bunch of displaced workers banding together to overcome their boss, with the\
  \ players helping them to organize. I’m sure there were headlines somewhere that\
  \ inspired this idea. Lol. #solidarity.</p>\n      <p>While everything I create\

  \ and Starfinder together.</p>\n      <p>My favorite part of this experience was\
  \ to add a piece of myself to Absalom by making the history behind the Muse of the\
