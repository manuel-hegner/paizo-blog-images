  \  <p><span itemprop=\"description\">For years the Harrow has been the domain of\
  \ home games, literature, and lore, but due to a combination of the soft time limits\
  \ inherent in organized play, the range of ways in which someone might cheat with\
  \ a deck-based mechanic, and a wealth of other considerations that predate my work\
  \ at Paizo, most Harrow-based options were never allowed. When Mike and I heard\
  \ that <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy95zm\">Pathfinder Player Companion:\
  \ The Harrow Handbook</a> was on the product schedule, we started pondering how\
  \ we might share as much of this book as possible with the campaign. We bounced\
  \ ideas off a lot of folks, and in the end we decided to make legal nearly everything\
  \ in the book as well as several previously banned Harrow character options such\
  \ as the harrower prestige class from <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ief\"\
  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide</a> and the oft-requested\
  \ Deadly Dealer feat from <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8tim\">Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion: Varisia, Birthplace of Legends</a>. Expect an update to the\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\">Additional\
  \ Resources page</a> that includes these additions.</span></p> \n    <p>Excited?\
  \ Me too!</p> \n    <p>Let's discuss some ground rules for Harrow use in Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play. These are intended to keep Harrow use from bogging down\
  \ gameplay while also providing GMs some assurance that everyone's playing fair\
  \ and showing off the beautiful new version of the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy938e\"\
  >Deluxe Harrow Deck</a>. </p> \n    <ol> \n     <li>Using a Harrow-based character\
  \ option that involves drawing one or more cards at random <b>requires a physical\
  \ Harrow deck</b>. Substituting another deck of cards or using the dice-rolling\
  \ option (such as the one presented in the harrower prestige class) is not an option.\
  \ If you aren't using a character option that does not change based on which card\
  \ you draw (such as just throwing cards with the Deadly Dealer feat), you do not\
  \ need to have a physical copy of the Harrow deck.</li> \n     <li>When you are\
  \ using a class ability that involves drawing one or more cards at random, <b>the\
  \ GM always has the option to cut the deck before you draw from the top</b>. This\
  \ is just a quick consideration to minimize cheating. The GM can also examine your\
  \ deck at any time, particularly if she believes there's anything wrong with your\
  \ deck.</li> \n     <li><b>Be considerate when performing a Harrowing</b>. Many\
  \ Pathfinder Society games are run in 4â€”5 hour time slots, so taking 10 minutes\
  \ to perform an in-character harrowing might not be an option. Be prepared to flip\
  \ cards, record results, and move on if the group is operating on a time limit.\
  \ So long as you're exercising common sense and courtesy, there shouldn't be anything\
  \ more to discuss here.</li> \n    </ol> \n    <p>Lots of great options are about\
  \ to be available. Go make something fun!</p> \n    <p>Happy gaming,</p> \n    <p>John\
