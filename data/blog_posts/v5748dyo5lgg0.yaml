  description\">Several months ago, among the earliest <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"\
  >Lost Coast</a> preview blogs, I revealed a few of the set's scaly denizens. This\
  \ week we return from Gen Con with three more reptilian foes heading your way in\
  \ November.</span></p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140822-GoblinSnake.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140822-GoblinSnake_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Here we have the weird-headed Goblin Snake, a vile creature\
  \ that made its original debut way back in <a href=\"/products/btpy7zkr\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #1: Burnt Offerings</a>, our very first Pathfinder product. As\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ campaign that adventure kicked off takes place in Varisia's Lost Coast region,\
  \ it seemed a fitting time to let this guy slither out from under the rockpile he's\
  \ been hiding in over the last seven years. Goblin Snakes occupy the low end of\
  \ the \"heads on snakes\" niche that places them as distant—if unacknowledged—cousins\
  \ of the more powerful nagas. You can find their statistics on page 132 of the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8odu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</a>. The Goblin Snake is\
  \ a Small, common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140822-GreenDragon.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140822-GreenDragon_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>This not-so-little guy leaked out a few weeks ago when a\
  \ canny retailer snapped a photo of one of my sales presentations, but here he is\
  \ in all high high-res glory. What we have here is a particularly menacing Large\
  \ Green Dragon, the latest in my quest to do all of the major dragons at all of\
  \ the major size categories. We're a bit behind with Greens, but this guy is a good\
  \ start and a fitting progeny for the <a href=\"/products/btpy909h\">Gargantuan\
  \ Green Dragon</a> case incentive for the <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends\
  \ of Golarion</a> set. The Large Green Dragon is a rare, Large figure.</p> \n  \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140822-BronzeDragon.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140822-BronzeDragon_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Metallic dragons seldom get the love of their chromatic brethren\
  \ when it comes to miniatures (prepainted or otherwise), something we'd like to\
  \ address with Pathfinder Battles. Here we have a striking Large Bronze Dragon to\
  \ lead the charge for goodness. The Large Bronze Dragon is a Large, rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Feiya Update!</h2> \n     <p>We had a series of very productive meetings\
  \ with our partners at WizKids last weekend at Gen Con, and I'm pleased to report\
  \ the final details of the replacement figures for the insufficient Feiya, Iconic\
  \ Witch figure from the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> set.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As I mentioned in previous Friday blogs, WizKids will replace badly\
  \ painted Feiyas with better versions of the same sculpt through their normal figure\
  \ redemption service at WizKids.com. Folks who want to swap out their figures one-for-one\
  \ are encouraged to use that system. That said, sending your figures in to WizKids\
  \ involves the time, effort, and expense of putting something in the mail, and WizKids\
  \ wanted to put forth some extra effort to make things a bit easier for loyal supporters\
  \ of the Pathfinder Battles line.</p> \n     <p>I'm pleased to report that for the\
  \ next set, <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">Lost Coast</a>, every case of figures\
  \ will include one \"super pack\" among the rest. In addition to the four standard\
  \ figures in that pack, the pack will ALSO include a FREE copy of the revised Feiya\
  \ figure.</p> \n     <p>IN ADDITION, that super-booster will also include a previously\
  \ unannounced improved repaint of the much-maligned King Irovetti figure from <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>, the figure that had, prior\
  \ to Feiya, been the most disappointing slide from paint master to production figure.\
  \ WizKids' figure replacement service will also handle requests for improved versions\
  \ of that figure. I'll let everyone know in this space when the replacement figures\
  \ are ready—they're at the factory now, so it's safe to assume they will be closer\
  \ to the November release of <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">Lost Coast</a> set.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Both of these figures will be identical to their previous versions,\
  \ albeit with vastly improved paint jobs. The base text and sculpts will be exactly\
  \ the same.</p> \n     <p>And that's all I've got for this week. Stay tuned for\
  \ more cool reveals next Friday!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
