  >The Dagger of Trust</a>, Chris Willrich introduces us to Gideon Gull, an Andoren\
  \ musician training at one of Taldor's greatest bardic colleges—and not just as\
  \ an artist. For in the secret halls beneath the school, Gideon studies to become\
  \ a Lion Blade, one of Taldor's elite espionage agents. When a mysterious fog starts\
  \ turning ordinary men and women into rabid monsters, it's up to Gideon and a team\
  \ of his friends to stop the chaos. But in the murky world of international politics,\
  \ there's always more at stake than just a few lives...</span></p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <h2>Chapter Two: Chamber Music for Three Assassins</h2> \n     <p>Taking\
  \ leave of the headmaster, Gideon raced into the building upon whose roof he'd greeted\
  \ the day. Footfalls echoed through halls of dwarf-cut stone from the World's Edge\
  \ Mountains and timber from the grim druids of the Verduran Forest.</p> \n     <p>Even\
  \ corridor acoustics concerned the Rhapsodic College.</p> \n     <p>Weaving and\
  \ dodging, Gideon passed classrooms, recital halls, dance studios, practice rooms,\
  \ and the big performance hall, until he reached twin oaken doors carved with musical\
  \ notes.</p> \n     <p>The smells of paper, leather, vellum, and papyrus greeted\
  \ his nose. A gruff \"Howzit, Mister Gull?\" from the gnome librarian greeted his\
  \ ears. Wintry light glowed through stained-glass windows depicting the rainbow-tailed\
  \ bird of the goddess Shelyn and the purple butterfly of the goddess Desna, two\
  \ powers particularly admired by bards. In their light, bookshelves stretched all\
  \ around him.</p> \n     <p>\"Need work, Mister Gull?\" The librarian's skin was\
  \ as dark as the oiled wood of his desk, and his gray hair had highlights that matched\
  \ the colors of the windows. \"They say a ship's in port all the way from Vudra.\
  \ Might have some new sitar tunes.\"</p> \n     <p>While the library couldn't match\
  \ the rival Kitharodian Academy's collection for size and depth, the gnome was fanatical\
  \ about competing in breadth. Students could make money scouting docks, gates, and\
  \ markets on the librarian's behalf, hunting for anyone with a new scrap of music.\
  \ When busking went dry, Gideon often worked for the librarian, expanding his own\
  \ repertoire in the bargain.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br>Gideon is a man of many talents, only some of which\
  \ are musical.\n     </div> \n     <p>\"Not today, Master Spindlegrim. Late for...studying.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"It's winter exams, boy!\" As one of the oldest students in the\
  \ college, Gideon only had to endure the term <i>boy</i> from this ancient gnome;\
  \ he didn't begrudge it. \"You're a little late indeed!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Don't\
  \ I know it!\" Gideon retreated into the stacks. He was never sure if Spindlegrim\
  \ was in on the secret of the Shadow School or not, but in any case Gideon couldn't\
  \ give the game away.</p> \n     <p>A dark turn in one corner led to Antique Musicology,\
  \ a dusty, mazelike nook. The ancient music discussed here preceded all notation,\
  \ and its true sound could only be guessed at, never recorded with certainty. Most\
  \ students were too practical-minded to venture here.</p> \n     <p>If they did—\
  if they slipped around the absurdly narrow last turn and peered through the shadows\
  \ at the farthest books—they might find a low, slim, volume titled <i>Toward an\
  \ Ethnomusicology of the Serpentfolk</i>, with letters of onyx embossed on black.\
  \ It took squinting to find it, and it appeared jammed between its bulkier neighbors.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But if you were a truly determined seeker, seizing knowledge in both\
  \ hands, you could slide the book out...and in so doing discover it was no book\
  \ at all, but a slab of stone.</p> \n     <p>Pulling it further, you'd trigger two\
  \ silent mechanisms, one shifting the stacks to cut off this alcove, the other sliding\
  \ the final shelf just a fraction, revealing a dark passageway. If bold enough,\
  \ you might slip into that tunnel before the shelves slid closed again.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Now trapped in total darkness, you'd have no choice but to descend steep\
  \ stairs to a landing where magical light suddenly sprang to life. When your eyes\
  \ at last adjusted, you might notice the murder holes surrounding you, through which\
  \ guardians might jab poisoned spears if they didn't like what stood revealed in\
  \ the light.</p> \n     <p>But if you were Gideon Gull, you said, \"The crab catch\
  \ is catastrophic in Korvosa,\" giving the passphrase of the week. \"And hurry,\
  \ I'm late.\"</p> \n     <p>Someone grunted and cranked a lever. A stone wall carved\
  \ with notation from a requiem groaned aside and revealed the Shadow School.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was not the <i>only</i> Shadow School, of course. Everyone knew there\
  \ were others. It was guessed, but never admitted, that there was another beneath\
  \ the rival Kitharodian Academy. Gideon suspected there were more, and there was\
  \ even a rumor of one under Cassomir. The mastermind of the Lion Blades obviously\
  \ liked both secrecy and redundancy. He also liked keeping his recruits on their\
  \ feet.</p> \n     <p>Gideon moved as fast as he could without alarming the hooded\
  \ guards that stood at attention like pieces of architecture. He passed quickly\
  \ through a labyrinth of drab corridors whose only ornaments were slogans spelled\
  \ out with magical glowing stones.</p> \n     <p><i>Speech is a sword</i>, said\
  \ one group of red stones, while <i>Silence is a shield</i>, answered another batch\
  \ in blue. Around the bend, purple stones announced the silent pun <i>No thieves\
  \ aloud</i>. Beyond another turn was a kind of mandala composed of green stones\
  \ spelling out repetitions of <i>Illusion Reality Illusion Reality</i> in an ever-tightening\
  \ spiral. Students argued as to what the innermost, tiniest message actually said.\
  \ (<i>Made You Look</i> was Gideon's favorite guess.)</p> \n     <p>Gideon panted\
  \ up to one particular slogan, <i>Here lies truth</i>. Gideon caught his breath\
  \ and pressed the letter <i>s</i>. Stone rumbled.</p> \n     <p>His first time in\
  \ the Shadow School had also been his first hazing, of sorts. Students were set\
  \ loose alone into the maze, which apparently had no particular rhyme or reason,\
  \ let alone classrooms.</p> \n     <p>Eventually he'd guessed that the slogans marked\
  \ concealed doors. Gideon's first class had been behind <i>Silence is a shield</i>,\
  \ where he'd met the other members of his cell. The instructor there, the Mistress\
  \ of Lies and Memory, had claimed the particular slogan you first triggered said\
  \ a lot about you, and determined which students you trained with. What exactly\
  \ it said in their case, the Mistress never explained.</p> \n     <p>The concealed\
  \ door marked by <i>Here lies truth</i> shifted inward, revealing the shape of a\
  \ tombstone, then slid sideways. Gideon stepped through, and the tombstone rumbled\
  \ back into place.</p> \n     <p>He stood within a vast chamber that at first glance\
  \ appeared mobbed. The magical illumination was silvery as moonlight. As his eyes\
  \ adapted, he recognized the crowd as fake. Mannequins, statues, straw men, and\
  \ potato sacks, all wrapped in clothing, filled this arena. Facades like those Sebastian\
  \ had spoken of created civic scenes. This time, judging by the sharply pointed\
  \ buildings and the jagged symbols of devils and diabolism, Gideon was supposed\
  \ to be in Cheliax.</p> \n     <p>The decor made the locale's nickname all the more\
  \ apt. Although officially termed the Simulation Gymnasium, students called it the\
  \ Scar Chamber.</p> \n     <p>\"You're late, Gull.\"</p> \n     <p>Above, on the\
  \ Rhapsodic campus, students were \"mister\" and \"mistress.\" Down below, you were\
  \ meat.</p> \n     <p>\"As such, the simulation will incorporate your delay.\" If\
  \ tones could cut like knives, this one was a surgeon's blade for that meat.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Yes, ma'am.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're a Lion Blade on assignment in\
  \ Cheliax, and you've stolen war plans from the desk of Queen Abrogail herself.\
  \ Her armies mass on Andoran's borders, threatening to destroy Taldor's buffer with\
  \ Cheliax—and, incidentally, your own native land.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, ma'am.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>His instructor stepped forward into the faux moonlight. She was a\
  \ short, compact woman with cropped gray hair, wearing a severe black tunic and\
  \ goggles with lenses of dark crystal. Two dueling scars sliced her impassive face\
  \ like a chart of the Porthmos and Sellen Rivers, with the curve of her left eye\
  \ the coast, the Porthmos slashing east on one side of the eye, the Sellen slicing\
  \ north on the other. She passed Gideon a scroll, sealed with a red, waxen mark\
  \ that rivaled a sea-urchin for sheer number of pointy bits. \"Find your contact\
  \ and hand over these plans. Escape by locating a spot marked <i>Exit</i> in the\
  \ language of devils. The word will be incongruous, but inconspicuous.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"How...how will I know my contact?\"</p> \n     <p>\"He—or she—is wearing\
  \ a hat marked with the azure coin of the archdevil Mammon of the Third Layer, Hell's\
  \ treasurer. Move quickly. Your colleagues Ozrif and Viridia are playing treacherous\
  \ Lion Blades in the queen's service. Their job is to ‘kill' you. I will unleash\
  \ them sooner, because you were late. Now inspire yourself!\"</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ that, the Mistress faded into shadows.</p> \n     <p>A low growl, nearly inaudible,\
  \ filled his throat. The vibration's sound and sensation triggered a series of memories:\
  \ hours spent beside the Mistress of Lies and Memory in a darkened chamber, surrounded\
  \ by anonymous Lion Blades in leonine masks, all growling and chanting about him.</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>You are loved, brother!</i><br> <i>You will\
  \ triumph!</i><br> <i>Your claws will tear the foe!</i><br> <i>Your fangs will rip\
  \ the enemy!</i><br> <i>You will taste the blood of victory!</i><br> <i>We are always\
  \ with you, brother!</i><br> <i>No force in the world can stop you!</i></p> \n \
  \    </blockquote> \n     <p>And so on, in this enthusiastically bloody vein. On\
  \ one level it was silly. Yet the sensation of trust and support had been powerful.\
  \ Daily repetitions of the ritual had clawed the feeling deep into his brain, so\
  \ that now if he merely rattled a soft, wordless echo of the chant, it was as if\
  \ every Lion Blade stood beside him, urging him on.</p> \n     <p>Now he stepped\
  \ into the crowded moonlight. The crowd wasn't moving, of course, but the Mistress\
  \ would be watching, her magical eyewear bestowing perfect vision in the dark, so\
  \ he had to behave as though it were. Gideon slipped into the frozen bustle and\
  \ wove through it.</p> \n     <p>He couldn't tell where she was—perhaps due to some\
  \ magical effect—but the Mistress's voice echoed through the chamber, goading and\
  \ encouraging.</p> \n     <p>\"The structures around you aren't lifeless, Gull!\
  \ Crowd and city aren't just random flotsam! They're embodiments of what we glibly\
  \ call ‘society.' They box in your body. Just as rules, strictures, and customs\
  \ box in your brain.\"</p> \n     <p>As a child in Andoran, Gideon had gotten used\
  \ to teachers who ordered him to sit still while they lectured. He'd never have\
  \ dreamed of an instructor like the Mistress, who shouted maxims like some Ulfen\
  \ wrestling coach.</p> \n     <p>\"You can bypass these obstacles. Your body knows\
  \ how. It's hungry to evade, to twist, to leap. Let it!\"</p> \n     <p>Something\
  \ in Gideon quickened at these words, as though every muscle he possessed yearned\
  \ for the challenge of a city and the need to traverse it. He encountered a cart\
  \ hitched to a wooden horse; he jumped smoothly over the singletree.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Most people shamble endlessly through their days, as unmindful as constructs\
  \ or walking corpses. You can be free!\"</p> \n     <p>The faux horse was triggered\
  \ to kick; Gideon spotted the danger and rolled away, getting himself around a corner.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A sound rose magically in the chamber, that of a multitude upon a busy\
  \ street.</p> \n     <p>The Mistress's voice rose above the hubbub. \"Remember,\
  \ city dwellers have a mental shorthand. Class, gender, race, objective—all are\
  \ surmised at a glance, below the level of true awareness. That shorthand is your\
  \ friend. Step lightly, and leave no trace in the pliant mud of the mind.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Gideon hustled, searching everywhere for his contact. How long till\
  \ his hunters found him?</p> \n     <p>\"But not everything can be average or ambiguous.\
  \ You can't help but present a gender and a class. Viridia! Your gender invites\
  \ danger and opportunity. There are shadowed streets a prudent woman won't walk\
  \ alone, yet also social occasions where only a woman blends in.\"</p> \n     <p>At\
  \ Viridia's name, Gideon immediately ducked close to the facade of a building and\
  \ removed his boots. This would call attention to him, and in daylight would be\
  \ a critical error. But in this moonlight, it might not matter. He pulled off the\
  \ boots and tangled the laces in his hand, so that he would have a pathetic little\
  \ club, if need be.</p> \n     <p>\"Class is more subtle,\" the Mistress said. \"\
  Its power varies by nation, city, and district. Here in Taldor, take special note\
  \ of what stratum you're emulating—especially you, Gideon.\"</p> \n     <p>Now,\
  \ as if people pulled off their shoes for no reason every Moonday night, Gideon\
  \ returned to the crowd. His footfalls would be quieter now.</p> \n     <p>\"In\
  \ Katapesh, everything's for sale—including, potentially, you. Be suspicious, and\
  \ in that way you'll be acting like everyone else. An innocent is a mark, or an\
  \ idiot, or has something up his sleeve. I don't fear for you in this, Ozrif, though\
  \ beware of sentimentality should you return.\"</p> \n     <p>A dummy moved, attempting\
  \ to block him.</p> \n     <p>Gideon had expected this, though not so soon. Many\
  \ of the figures were mounted on movable panels, responding to pressure plates or\
  \ cranks operated by unseen staff. Some of the figures were even magically self-animated.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Gideon dodged.</p> \n     <p>\"In Andoran, swagger—but not you, Gideon—\
  to the point of insulting your betters. For the point is that an Andoren has no\
  \ betters. Walk down every street as if you own it. For after all, you do.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Now he heard footfalls elsewhere in the Scar Chamber, though he couldn't\
  \ tell where.</p> \n     <p>\"It's best to think of wondrous Absalom not as one\
  \ city, but many. Its variety is such that it's always easy to blend in to a degree.\
  \ But each district has its special customs, and you'll have to learn them to operate\
  \ with real success.\"</p> \n     <p>Glints of red and gold, emerald and turquoise\
  \ lay on many of the dummies' hats or arms or necks. Gideon's eyes shifted back\
  \ and forth, hunting for the blue coin of the archdevil Mammon.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  In Cheliax, tell yourself you're smarter than anyone else, and the appropriate sneer\
  \ will develop. Learn the diabolic deferences, but remember that Cheliax respects\
  \ devils without worshiping them. And never forget your common humanity with the\
  \ Chelaxians. They'll surprise you with little kindnesses toward their foes, even\
  \ amid the business of backstabbing their friends.\"</p> \n     <p>At last Gideon\
  \ glimpsed an azure disc across an alley. He ducked low and veered between the building\
  \ facades.</p> \n     <p>A mistake. A foot jabbed from behind a mannequin and tripped\
  \ Gideon. He fell, rolled, and was up immediately, kicking at a dark shape that\
  \ skittered backward. Such was Ozrif's style.</p> \n     <p>The juggler from Katapesh\
  \ had grown up on mean streets, performing but also stealing, evading grown-up thieves\
  \ and slavers and worse. Gideon's own street experience—mainly lying insensible\
  \ in them—could not compare.</p> \n     <p>Remembering the lay of the crowd, Gideon\
  \ gambled and danced backward between dummies. When he'd gotten a sufficient distance\
  \ he threw his shoes to a point beyond where Ozrif must be.</p> \n     <p>Before\
  \ the shoes had even hit the floor, Gideon was off through the forest of mannequins,\
  \ circling the block to bypass the alley.</p> \n     <p>He reached his contact,\
  \ an unusually realistic mannequin wearing a cap adorned with a devil-faced blue\
  \ coin. Gideon stuffed the small scroll under the cap and ran, hoping neither Ozrif\
  \ nor Viridia had seen. Now his job was to run.</p> \n     <p>He rounded a corner\
  \ and met Viridia's knife.</p> \n     <p>The rough-and-tumble frontierswoman from\
  \ Stavian's Hold had good hearing, and now that Gideon was taking risks with speed,\
  \ she was quick to find him. She jabbed and swung like someone who'd grown up with\
  \ a blade in her hand.</p> \n     <p>\"Die, enemy of the queen!\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  She's a rebel!\" Gideon pointed, knowing the Mistress would be imagining a crowd's\
  \ response. \"An Andoren trying to undermine the regime!\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm a\
  \ loyal servant of Cheliax!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, yeah? Name all of the eight archdevils\
  \ below Asmodeus!\"</p> \n     <p>Viridia spat. \"Creepy, Snarly, Greedy, Nasty,\
  \ Farty, Crazy, Chilly, and Scum! Who the hell cares?\"</p> \n     <p>When you first\
  \ looked at Viridia, you thought you were looking at a weathered, strong-minded,\
  \ dark-haired young woman with the plain-spoken wisdom of the eastern frontier.\
  \ It was only after hearing her snorting bark of laughter, after watching her swill\
  \ hard liquor with a burp or listening to her haggling at the market, that you realized\
  \ either your idea of <i>the solemn dignity of the plains </i>was utterly quaint,\
  \ or that Viridia was unique. Perhaps both.</p> \n     <p>Gideon leapt onto a facade's\
  \ balcony. With Viridia swearing beneath him, Gideon jumped to the balcony of a\
  \ neighboring facade and, with one quick scan for the word <i>Exit</i>, leapt back\
  \ to the street.</p> \n     <p>He'd glimpsed a golden word...</p> \n     <p>Somewhere\
  \ out there, the Mistress said, \"Remember! Whenever you speak in the field, you\
  \ play a role! When you're silent, only then will you be yourself.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"It's well you should know the names of devils,\" said a different voice,\
  \ \"for you'll be meeting them soon.\"</p> \n     <p>He whirled and ducked beneath\
  \ Ozrif's spinning kick.</p> \n     <p>Ozrif's light brown skin, black hair, and\
  \ almond eyes revealed his Keleshite heritage; and in a nation still remembering\
  \ a withering war against a Keleshite land, this forever marked him as suspicious.\
  \ Gideon sometimes wondered if Ozrif's bardic specialty deliberately deflected that\
  \ suspicion. For a juggler is necessarily apart from his audience, the center of\
  \ a whirling, transfixing phenomenon—if all goes well, anyway. It's only if one\
  \ drops the ball that the spell is broken. It helped that Ozrif was also a bit of\
  \ a comedian.</p> \n     <p><i>Oops!</i> Gideon had once heard Ozrif say. <i>Well,\
  \ every moon must descend. Parents, thank you, and remember I have magic powers\
  \ to cure your children of childish traits. Za zim zab! There, bring them back in\
  \ thirty years and we'll see how that worked. Unattended money attracts thieves;\
  \ save yourselves from such a fate by means of my handy cup!</i></p> \n     <p>Ozrif\
  \ had no juggling clubs or quips today, but his limber punches and kicks testified\
  \ to his quick reflexes and wit.</p> \n     <p>Viridia reappeared, flanking Gideon.\
  \ She jabbed him in the arm. Gideon's old friend Pain rattled the bell of his mind.\
  \ Ozrif and Viridia were indeed the perfect couple, if you needed someone hunted\
  \ down.</p> \n     <p>Spellcasting was unwise under these conditions. But then again,\
  \ <i>anything</i> was unwise under these conditions.</p> \n     <p>He wished he'd\
  \ retained his spell to fascinate a crowd, but you played the instruments you had.\
  \ He recalled one spell he didn't associate with any particular music, but rather\
  \ with the random, perplexing, fascinating racket of an orchestra tuning up.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Waving his hands, he intoned syllables that would implant perplexity.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It probably shouldn't have worked, but it did. Ozrif froze. He began\
  \ babbling what might have been a Keleshite nursery rhyme.</p> \n     <p>Gideon\
  \ rolled away from Viridia, noticing that the straw mannequin nearest him, done\
  \ up as a Chelish Hellknight with cloth for armor, was bound together with twine.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Humming the tune of \"Haul Away for Arcadia,\" he rose beside the dummy.\
  \ Viridia advanced within a foot of the Hellknight. The shanty opened a hatch in\
  \ Gideon's mind, and out popped the arcane formulae and gestures for a spell.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The twine unraveled and engulfed Viridia.</p> \n     <p>As she shouted\
  \ \"Cheat!\" and Ozrif's addled brain set the juggler to punching himself, Gideon\
  \ reached the shadowy spot where he'd glimpsed the word <i>Exit</i>.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>He heard the Mistresses' voice again, now from a new direction. \"Remember,\
  \ you're a paradox, for Taldor is flamboyant even in its secrets. Who but Taldor\
  \ would recruit performers to become its corps of spies?\"</p> \n     <p>He spotted\
  \ a glint of gold.</p> \n     <p>The Mistress had never said <i>Exit</i> would appear\
  \ on a structure.</p> \n     <p>He ran toward the voice.</p> \n     <p>\"Only Taldor\
  \ so smoothly blends guile and show,\" the Mistress said. \"Hello, Gull.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Hello, <i>Exit</i>.\" The word glittered, golden letters strung upon\
  \ a necklace.</p> \n     <p>\"Well played,\" said the shadowy shape wearing it.\
  \ \"But you must tag me to escape.\"</p> \n     <p>Gideon circled. \"What does this\
  \ represent in the scenario?\"</p> \n     <p>\"The unexpected. No plan survives\
  \ contact with reality.\" She moved gracefully, shifting with him. \"So sometimes\
  \ our simulations simply cheat.\"</p> \n     <p>Gideon lunged. She shifted aside\
  \ easily.</p> \n     <p>Behind him he heard the footfalls of Ozrif and Viridia.\
  \ Gideon's spells had worn off or been overcome.</p> \n     <p>All he had to do\
  \ was tag the Mistress of Stillness and Motion. But she could see in the dark and\
  \ he couldn't.</p> \n     <p>Ozrif was upon him then, attempting a flying tackle.\
  \ Gideon dodged, rolled, rose—and realized what he needed to do. As Ozrif got to\
  \ his feet, Gideon treated the Mistress as a pillar, an obstacle, and she seemed\
  \ not to object, so long as he wasn't trying to touch her. He kept his distance,\
  \ so as to goad Ozrif into another leap.</p> \n     <p>Now—</p> \n     <p>Instead\
  \ of evading, Gideon threw himself into the brunt of Ozrif's tackle. He'd positioned\
  \ things so that the momentum threw him against the Mistress. Tag.</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ even as he knew his gambit would succeed, his ears brought him the sound of Viridia's\
  \ drawling incantation, the voice swiftly shifting location, for Viridia usually\
  \ danced as she cast. He recognized it as her sleeping spell...</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ awoke to the Mistress of Stillness and Motion splashing water on his face.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Wake up. You're dead.\"</p> \n     <p>He was as groggy as if awakening\
  \ in a gutter. His arm had the tingling sensation he always felt upon receiving\
  \ magical healing.</p> \n     <p>\"Twice in one day,\" Gideon groaned.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"All part of life.\" The Mistress offered him a hand and hauled him up.\
  \ The lighting in the Scar Chamber now resembled bright noontime, revealing the\
  \ mannequins in all their rumpled artificiality, the facades as disguised exercise\
  \ platforms. \"You did achieve your goal, at the cost of your death.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"It's becoming a habit.\" Gideon blinked at Viridia and Ozrif, who were\
  \ sitting nearby, drinking some of the cold water Gideon was now wearing. Being\
  \ dead was thirsty work. He took a cup from the Mistress and gulped it down. \"\
  Didn't I escape in the end?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You did, but with your opponents glued\
  \ to you. No clean getaway.\"</p> \n     <p>Viridia drew a line across her throat.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"A draw,\" the Mistress concluded. \"Class is done. I have a message\
  \ for you from the headmaster, Gull. He'd like to discuss this morning's events,\
  \ whenever you find it convenient.\" She paused. \"And do be cautious, topside,\
  \ all of you. Something strange is in the air.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I appreciate the\
  \ warning,\" Ozrif said. \"I'd appreciate specifics even more.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  That's Kelish for ‘spill it,'\" said Viridia, then added, \"please.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The Mistress shook her head. \"Just an intuition.\"</p> \n     <p>As they\
  \ left the Scar Chamber, Ozrif said, \"The longer I know the Mistress, the less\
  \ I think I know her.\"</p> \n     <p>\"She's odd,\" Viridia agreed, \"even for\
  \ this place.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'd listen to her, though,\" said Gideon.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Well, you're odd too.\" Viridia turned toward a branching corridor. \"\
  See you both later?\" The cell usually took different exits to the surface.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"This time let's stay together.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You <i>do</i> take\
  \ her warning seriously,\" Ozrif noted.</p> \n     <p>Gideon shrugged. \"She's an\
  \ honest spy, as these things go.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Do you feel a chill?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>At first, Gideon thought Ozrif was joking, but then Viridia answered, \"\
  Yes,\" and Gideon's skin felt clammy too.</p> \n     <p>All sounds were muted. Usually\
  \ there was a hint of footsteps elsewhere in the school, but now it was as though\
  \ the trio walked alone in a long-abandoned labyrinth.</p> \n     <p>They rounded\
  \ another corner.</p> \n     <p>\"—what in Desna's name is that?\"</p> \n     <p>Everyone\
  \ stopped. Viridia pointed.</p> \n     <p>Mist crawled through the corridor. It\
  \ was as though the air of some remote bog had been grasped by a divine hand and\
  \ deposited here, where it had no business being. Aside from the glow of a nearby\
  \ slogan—<i>Every brain is a pickable lock</i>—the white fog, swirling with hints\
  \ of green, obliterated vision. It didn't begin gradually, as a natural fog would,\
  \ but rather blurred into view a few yards ahead of the trio, and filled the hallway\
  \ like a mass of cobwebs. </p> \n     <p>Perhaps it was the corridor's chill, but\
  \ Gideon recalled his sessions in the Shadow School's icy dissection chamber, where\
  \ exhumed corpses were sliced to show the finer points of humanoid anatomy.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>No, that was not entirely true. It reminded him of something else as\
  \ well. Something long ago, just out of his mind's grasp.</p> \n     <p>\"This must\
  \ be a prank,\" Viridia said. \"The Night of the Pale's less than two weeks from\
  \ now...\"</p> \n     <p>\"An expensive prank,\" Ozrif said. \"Some sort of magic...\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"There are shapes inside,\" Gideon said, unable to look away.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Three long shadows of human forms stretched into the fog, as though\
  \ he and his companions were backlit. Above each shadow twisted even darker images.\
  \ At first Gideon thought of these as ink spills, then as octopuses, and finally\
  \ as shadow plays, like those Leothric performed with certain puppets imported from\
  \ Jalmeray. For now in crisp silhouette there loomed scenes from each bard's life.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Above Ozrif's shadow Gideon saw a dancing, juggling boy he was sure\
  \ was Ozrif himself. The boy jumped aboard a ship and was embraced by the people\
  \ there. The ship soon encountered a larger vessel, and it flew a chiaroscuro flag\
  \ of a crown above a lion. Many on the smaller ship were killed, and many treasures\
  \ taken from it. The ship sank into the mists.</p> \n     <p>Meanwhile over Viridia's\
  \ shadow there rose a farmstead, where a girl rode a horse through the grass. There\
  \ came an ornate carriage bearing the crown-and-lion banner, and the girl's parents\
  \ pleaded with a robed official. In the end many bags went into the laughing tax\
  \ collector's hands.</p> \n     <p>Gideon didn't want to look at his own shadow.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Above Ozrif's there was now a bazaar scene, with the boy fleeing a slave\
  \ stockade where his old crewmates stood for sale; and above Viridia's were hangman's\
  \ nooses, their purpose fulfilled, with the girl raging before them.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>And still Gideon did not look to the third scene. He saw instead his friends'\
  \ expressions, haunted, contorted in old anger and pain. But worse, they looked\
  \ also toward <i>him</i>.</p> \n     <p>\"Gideon,\" Viridia said, \"what are we\
  \ seeing? I know the girl is me, and I know enough about Ozrif's past to recognize...but\
  \ I don't understand yours.\"</p> \n     <p>\"These are scenes torn from our pasts,\"\
  \ said Ozrif. \"Grim things. Yet yours seems different, Gideon.\"</p> \n     <p>Now\
  \ Gideon looked.</p> \n     <p>In his own shadow play, a boy wrestled with his older\
  \ brother. From the little cape worn by the bigger boy, Gideon knew it was his brother\
  \ Gareth. And from the smaller boy's toy sword, Gideon knew that he was looking\
  \ at himself.</p> \n     <p>The idyllic scene by itself was not the cause of his\
  \ dread. The Singing Knight had fought the Opera Ghost many a time, sometimes with\
  \ the participation of their sisters in the form of the Captive Diva, the Master\
  \ Detective, and Chomper the Dinosaur. (That was Zitha, the littlest, who introduced\
  \ Chomper into everything from tea parties to formal dinners; after a while it made\
  \ a strange kind of sense.)</p> \n     <p>There was no diva or detective or dinosaur\
  \ this time, but there was another element. Little specks flew back and forth in\
  \ the air above the brothers.</p> \n     <p>\"What are the dark dots?\" Viridia\
  \ asked.</p> \n     <p>\"Bees.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Did the bees attack you?\" asked\
  \ Ozrif.</p> \n     <p>\"No! The bees are just bees.\" What mattered was not the\
  \ bees but what their presence said about the time and place. \"Those are the bees\
  \ of Bellis.\"</p> \n     <p>The fog curdled and thickened near the bees, and the\
  \ swarm dispersed. The boys looked up, the Singing Knight and Opera Ghost forgotten\
  \ as they looked to where the fog had congealed.</p> \n     <p>\"What are they looking\
  \ at?\" Ozrif asked.</p> \n     <p>\"It,\" muttered Gideon.</p> \n     <p>\"What?\"\
  \ said Viridia. \"I don't see anything.\"</p> \n     <p>\"That!\" said Gideon, for\
  \ it was plain as a bear on the Grand Bridge. And now it was as if he were back\
  \ in time.</p> \n     <p>He unsheathed his dagger and confronted the fog.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Gideon!\" Viridia shouted, and Ozrif tried to restrain him. But he plunged\
  \ forward.</p> \n     <p>The touch of the fog was like the caress of some undead\
  \ lover. It sickened him, for all that he remembered it well. And within it, something\
  \ touched his mind. The same presence he'd felt on the conservatory roof. Laughing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>All at once, the fog withdrew around a corner. He followed, his friends\
  \ close at his heels.</p> \n     <p>When they rounded the bend, it was gone.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What manner of monster was this?\" Viridia demanded.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Now you're leaping to conclusions,\" said Ozrif. \"It was a trick, a spell effect...\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I suggest,\" Gideon said, trying to return to the here and now,\
  \ \"that you two reach an exit and inform the guards. I'll see if the headmaster\
  \ will speak to me early.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You sure?\" Viridia asked.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"You seem most affected—\" said Ozrif.</p> \n     <p>\"I'm fine.\" Gideon\
  \ turned and walked toward the headmaster's nook of the maze, not wanting to speak\
  \ further. He needed to be alone.</p> \n     <p>The past was the past. And Gareth\
  \ was gone.</p> \n     <p>Gideon at last reached a wall where silver light stones\
  \ spelled out the sentence <i>If you want to know what lies ahead, learn what lies\
  \ behind.</i> He found a spot on the unmarked wall directly opposite the word <i>behind</i>,\
  \ and pressed the stone there. A panel slid aside, and cold rock gave way to warm\
  \ wood, silk curtains, and embroidered furnishings.</p> \n     <p>The headmaster\
  \ had an open-door policy—if you could figure out how to open the door.</p> \n \
  \    <p>In Xeritian's office hung portraits of the sort that great men, or men who\
  \ fancy themselves great, commission. Each noble or official or wealthy merchant\
  \ stood in a pose of ease and power, often fondling some token of authority—a heraldic\
  \ shield, a book of laws, or brass scales—as though it were a concubine.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In each picture Xeritian stood in the shadows behind the great personage,\
  \ a dagger in his hand, a smirk upon his face.</p> \n     <p>There was a large chair\
  \ facing a vast desk strewn with papers. Xeritian made a point of having his back\
  \ to you if you entered his office. A dare, Gideon supposed, though he personally\
  \ thought it theatrical.</p> \n     <p>The chair was empty, however.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Gideon!\"</p> \n     <p>Sebastian came down the hallway from the direction\
  \ opposite Gideon's.</p> \n     <p>\"I was hoping to catch Xeritian,\" the corsair\
  \ said. \"What are you doing here?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Sebastian. I'm glad to see\
  \ you.\" Gideon explained about the fog, though something made him hold back anything\
  \ about dead brothers or voices in his head.</p> \n     <p>Sebastian frowned. Entering\
  \ the office, he leaned over a brass horn embedded in the desk, its cone opening\
  \ onto some cavity in the wood. He blew. Gideon heard nothing. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  That should bring everyone running,\" Sebastian said. \"They'll also send a messenger\
  \ to Xeritian, wherever he might be.\"</p> \n     <p>\"They?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  A school like this requires many hidden staff. Will you show me where this fog manifested?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>When they reached the spot in question, Ozrif and Viridia were gone,\
  \ but there were guards present, as well as the Mistress of Stillness and Motion.\
  \ Sebastian conferred with her, adding, \"Do you think it was the same?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"That's supposition. But I mistrust coincidences.\"</p> \n     <p>\"The\
  \ same as what?\" Gideon asked.</p> \n     <p>Sebastian took his arm. \"Come with\
  \ me, Gull.\"</p> \n     <p>They reached a guard post and ascended a switchbacking\
  \ stairway in the dark. \"There've been reports across Oppara of these manifestations,\"\
  \ Sebastian said. \"Even in the Senate's halls.\"</p> \n     <p>\"An attack?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"A strange one, if so. Only certain people perceive it. Thus we've\
  \ not been able to convince the mighty. Also, no one's suffered worse than a scare,\
  \ and a riling of their emotions.\" He paused. \"You do seem upset.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"I'm fine. On the green, you mentioned a fog. Are these apparitions similar\
  \ to what Corvine described?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Her letter was brief, but yes, I\
  \ think so. She requested an investigation. I was personally inclined to wait, but\
  \ given the excitement her messenger caused at the debate, I had to show her letter\
  \ to the headmaster. He insisted we inform Director Rell. I did so personally, and\
  \ was returning to Xeritian when I found you. Evidently the headmaster chose to\
  \ do some investigating of his own.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'd volunteer. To go to Cassomir,\
  \ I mean.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're eager to see Corvine.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Well,\
  \ how would you feel?\"</p> \n     <p>Sebastian laughed. \"That's unclear, since\
  \ no one but you and she understands your relationship. You were clearly lovers\
  \ once, but something happened—\"</p> \n     <p>\"I became a worthless drunk is\
  \ what happened. Well, became one again. She's hinted we might start again. But\
  \ I need to build a life that doesn't center around a bottle.\"</p> \n     <p>They\
  \ reached the top of the stairs. Dim light seeped through the edges of a secret\
  \ portal. They emerged between wine barrels into a storeroom with frosted window-slits\
  \ lining the upper ceiling. A permanent illusion portrayed the squeak and scuttle\
  \ of a rat infestation. Sebastian pulled down a trapdoor from the ceiling as Gideon\
  \ rolled a barrel back into place, with beady, illusory eyes glaring at him all\
  \ the while.</p> \n     <p>\"She knows you've gone to the Rhapsodic,\" Sebastian\
  \ said. \"Does she suspect the rest?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I don't think so.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Do you think she's the sort who can love a Lion Blade?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I think that's a premature question.\" Gideon paused. <i>Unless he's asking for\
  \ his own benefit.</i> \"By the way, I hope our little argument on the green didn't\
  \ raise a cloud between us.\"</p> \n     <p>Sebastian paused on the trapdoor ladder.\
  \ \"That could never happen. Even if I'm a great believer in the Taldan way and\
  \ you're an addled democracy-fool of Andoran.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Thanks, I guess.\
  \ It's been a long while since I voted, however.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Do you ever want\
  \ to go back?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I love Andoran. But we're...estranged.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Hm.\"</p> \n     <p>They ascended to the owner's office of The Harp and\
  \ Harpoon, a tavern and inn popular with bards and sailors, and thus a natural safe\
  \ house for the Lion Blades. Sebastian hailed Tithra Sparksteel, the proprietor,\
  \ who grunted invisibly from behind her stack of ledgers.</p> \n     <p>\"Thought\
  \ that racket was you, Tambour. By the way, that girl from The Cat and Feather came\
  \ by.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I hope you told her I'm busy.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I almost\
  \ told her I had an opening. If she's going to keep popping up, she might as well\
  \ work.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You won't, of course.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Settle your business,\
  \ man.\"</p> \n     <p>\"My business is Taldor, madam.\"</p> \n     <p>Sebastian\
  \ pulled a heavy book from a shelf and led Gideon to the common room. Amid the bright\
  \ babble of seafaring conversation and snatches of song, Sebastian said, \"I must\
  \ take my leave for now. For even without these apparitions, I've a full schedule.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"You won't be investigating?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Not primarily. Not\
  \ with the faculty already involved. I've an appointment with a ship's manifest\
  \ and a mug of Bellis Mead. I'd hoped to find the headmaster here, but a school\
  \ messenger's surely found him by now. My own business with him isn't urgent, and\
  \ I'd best resume my duties.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What should I do? Before all this\
  \ happened the Mistress of Stillness and Motion told me the headmaster wanted to\
  \ see me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You've made the effort. I'll vouch for you. I suggest\
  \ you return to the college, prepare for exams, and let him find you.\" Sebastian\
  \ smirked. \"If he does, mention I'd like to speak to him again as well.\" After\
  \ a pause, he said, \"Do be careful out there.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You mean the fog?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I mean everything.\"</p> \n     <p>When Gideon emerged from the\
  \ tavern into the street, the air had changed. The sky, once so bright and clear,\
  \ was now pale gray.</p> \n     <p>As he stepped onto the cobblestones, something\
  \ swooped out of the pale sky. </p> \n     <p>Gideon dove across the street, ducking\
  \ around a carriage, a trio of sailors, and a flower girl in a way that might have\
  \ impressed the Mistress of Stillness and Motion. He rolled into a crouch beneath\
  \ a townhouse's timber jetty, dagger out.</p> \n     <p>Swooping past the staring\
  \ faces, the pigeon landed beside Gideon. A little scroll clung to its leg.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Gideon rose and bowed to the passersby. \"Alas, pigeon training is never\
  \ done!\"</p> \n     <p>There was muttering to the effect that there ought to be\
  \ laws against this sort of thing as the wayfarers moved on. Gideon removed the\
  \ scroll. The pigeon looked familiar; some of Corvine's couriers returned to her,\
  \ which spoke well of her treatment of animals.</p> \n     <p>Bard said to bird,\
  \ \"Thank you. Go free.\"</p> \n     <p>The pigeon fluttered into the dour sky.\
  \ He opened the scroll and squinted at rows of intricate and increasingly diminutive\
  \ handwriting.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><br>Dear Gideon,<br> Salutations,\
  \ greetings, waves! I'd have sent a seagull, Gull, but pigeons are better at this,\
  \ and I need to move fast. How are you? I'm haunted by eldritch forces, but otherwise\
  \ fine. No, don't be alarmed. It's not me personally, just my whole city. Maybe\
  \ that doesn't reassure you. Maybe it doesn't reassure me. Anyway, the long and\
  \ the short of it is, there's a mysterious, magical, fog-like effect that seems\
  \ to drive people mad. We've had reports of it around town and up the Sellen. Actually\
  \ one of the reports is mine! Earlier I sent a letter to our mutual friend Sebastian</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>\"A coded message from the Qadiran Satrap, Gull?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Gideon started, and pocketed the scroll. \"Headmaster!\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>Headmaster Xeritian chuckled. He was still dressed in his spattered groundskeeper's\
  \ robe. \"I fear you mistake me for someone else, Master Gull. I'm but a simple\
  \ groundskeeper.\" His eyes flashed a warning.</p> \n     <p>The day grew suddenly\
  \ warmer as Gideon realized his error. They stood in the middle of a busy street,\
  \ and here he was loudly proclaiming the headmaster's true identity. \"Of course.\
  \ My mistake.\"</p> \n     <p> Xeritian nodded to the pocket containing the scroll.\
  \ \"Your blushing haste suggests not treachery, but romance. Your friend in Cassomir,\
  \ then.\"</p> \n     <p>Gideon's face burned hotter still. He stepped closer and\
  \ lowered his voice to a safe level. \"The Mistress of Stillness and Motion said\
  \ you wanted to see me? And you were informed about the apparition at the school?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Yes and yes. Walk with me.\"</p> \n     <p>He followed the old\
  \ man through Westport, feeling increasingly agitated at Xeritian's lack of agitation.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>They crossed some of the rougher streets of that rough district. Sometimes\
  \ Xeritian would chuckle at this folly of humanity or that. Gideon had no sense\
  \ of what the headmaster was up to. From time to time a disturbance would make Gideon\
  \ ready to spring. A man came hurtling through the much-abused window of a tavern.\
  \ Beside a brothel a woman in a man's clutches laughed in a shrieking, mocking way\
  \ that hammered the ears. A man in a gutter gripped at Xeritian's leg and gasped,\
  \ \"Money for pesh?\"</p> \n     <p>Gideon wanted to say, <i>You have enough trouble\
  \ without sucking up that stuff</i>, but Xeritian passed the man a coin, to a babble\
  \ of thanks from which the headmaster silently removed himself.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  You disapprove?\" Xeritian asked Gideon.</p> \n     <p>\"I've seen pesh carve brains\
  \ like melons.\"</p> \n     <p>\"His fate isn't my concern, and I admired his candor.\
  \ A little honesty is a fine thing in this deceitful world.\"</p> \n     <p>\"In\
  \ that case: why aren't you back at the Shadow School, when something like that\
  \ fog's gotten in?\"</p> \n     <p>\"The truth isn't going to be at the school.\
  \ This is a city of a million lies, and I'm a master of liars. Sifting the lies,\
  \ I may find the answers.\"</p> \n     <p>\"If you admire honesty,\" Gideon wondered\
  \ aloud, \"doesn't it bother you, being a master of liars?\"</p> \n     <p>Xeritian\
  \ raised an eyebrow. \"Not at all. I train them, but I have the privilege of being\
  \ an honest man myself. If anything, I feel guilty at the discrepancy. Do the lies\
  \ bother <i>you</i>?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Somewhat.\" If Xeritian appreciated candor,\
  \ then Gideon would give it to him. \"Every song's a lie of sorts, you know. You\
  \ take the pose of a narrator. Sometimes that narrator is you, sometimes not. Spycraft\
  \ is kind of like that, I think. Except it isn't a show, it's a con. It does bother\
  \ me, sometimes...\"</p> \n     <p>\"Spoken like a bard. You're not the first with\
  \ that reaction.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Were you a bard, Headmaster?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  No. I was a historian.\" A few unexpected snowflakes fell around them as they spoke.\
  \ Xeritian caught the year's first snow in his hand. \"When you grow up amid the\
  \ bones of past greatness, it's a lively field.\" The snowflake melted, and they\
  \ walked on.</p> \n     <p>They departed Westport, and the snowflakes became a throng,\
  \ dancing on the air like fat, lazy gnats. At first they left only a little moisture\
  \ on the cheek or a few brief bright motes in the glorious weaves of a Taldan woman's\
  \ hair. Opparans, busy with the business of the City of Empire—or surviving the\
  \ City of Empire—ignored it. But the sky's gray mills weren't to be denied, and\
  \ relentlessly churned out their snowy flour. Bit by bit, the streets and rooftops\
  \ were covered in white, and the Gilded City became silver.</p> \n     <p>Xeritian\
  \ led Gideon to the doorstep of the House of the Immortal Son, the temple of the\
  \ dead god Aroden, now converted to an opera house. He pushed open one of the great\
  \ doors and gestured inside.</p> \n     <p>\"Headmaster? What does an opera rehearsal\
  \ have to do with the fog?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Nothing, Gull. I summoned you because\
  \ of your performance this morning. It concerns me. Crises come and go, but the\
  \ need to train new Lion Blades remains.\"</p> \n     <p>A singing troupe was rehearsing\
  \ inside, sans orchestra, yet augmented with the presence of spellcasters. As Gideon\
  \ watched, illusory fires seemed to fill the air around the singers, and blasts\
  \ of water withered the fire; yet the waves were outflanked by further flames.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Have you heard of the thaumacycle?\" Xeritian asked.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  A composition that incorporates magic. A revival of a lost Azlanti tradition. A\
  \ difficult form.\" While true bards studied both music and magic, each discipline\
  \ was quite demanding on its own. The combination defeated most composers. By tradition,\
  \ every spell in a thaumacycle performance had to be at least theoretically castable\
  \ by the author. The exact form was up to each composer, but most entries were operas.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You're aware of the Taldan Thaumacycle Festival?\"\P\"I've heard of\
  \ it but never witnessed it. It travels around.\" Corvine had spoken of it with\
  \ interest, and had mentioned wanting to try her hand at it.</p> \n     <p>\"The\
  \ next one will be held here on Longnight, a little over a month from now. This\
  \ group's already rehearsing.\" Xeritian winked. \"But I believe there's enough\
  \ time for you to enter and compose something.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Me? What about\
  \ the fog?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're forgetting you're still a student, Gull. More\
  \ experienced hands will deal with today's danger. I still need you in training,\
  \ to face tomorrow's threats.\"</p> \n     <p>\"But—respectfully—how does this help\
  \ me become a better Lion Blade? I could do it, but I'd have to drop everything\
  \ else, and I doubt very much I'd win.\" And if he were to devote his winter recess\
  \ to the work, he wouldn't be able to travel to Cassomir to investigate the fog.\
  \ And see Corvine. \"Maybe I'd manage the score, but the magic...\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Challenging, yes. But experience is the point, not victory. You seemed reluctant\
  \ to employ magic during the Shadow Taunt.\"</p> \n     <p>Gideon reddened. It was\
  \ true. He was a quick study at spells, and could cast them at need, but they never\
  \ seemed natural to him. Outside of immediate danger, he rarely thought of employing\
  \ them.</p> \n     <p>\"I suspect your difficulty with magic's less a matter of\
  \ talent, and more that you have a lopsided interest in music.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Well, I <i>was</i> just a musician until recently.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Quite. Sometimes\
  \ we must coax the brain, rather than flog it. I have recommended the thaumacycle\
  \ for others before.\"</p> \n     <p>Gideon smirked. \"And it'll keep me out of\
  \ trouble?\" And possibly, Gideon considered, give him something that could entice\
  \ Corvine to visit <i>him</i>.</p> \n     <p>\"There's that. I'll place you on special\
  \ assignment. For the college as well. As it's almost winter recess, that will be\
  \ simple. Indeed, as soon as I return I'll cancel your commitments for the day,\
  \ and rearrange your tests, so you may begin work. It might be good to keep you\
  \ out of the official eye. Be careful this fine frosty day.\" Xeritian turned.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Wait.\" </p> \n     <p>The headmaster stopped. </p> \n     <p>\"You're\
  \ the third person today who's warned me to be careful,\" Gideon said. \"Is there\
  \ something I should know? If there's danger, why can't I investigate along with\
  \ you? What does the future hold?\"</p> \n     <p>Xeritian smiled. \"I'll use the\
  \ historian's standard answer: ‘That is not my period of study.' As for the rest—\
  you're simply not ready, Gull. I'm sorry. Even I must be wary, as I go hunting.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Be careful, Headmaster.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Always, Gull.\" The headmaster\
  \ paused. \"You dislike lies, and that is admirable. Remember the value of truth.\
  \ It is high. But it is not infinite.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I don't understand.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I believe you will.\"</p> \n     <p>Xeritian walked into the crowd,\
  \ and there should have been no way that the old historian could simply disappear\
  \ from Gideon's sight, but that was exactly what happened. Of course the headmaster\
  \ of the Shadow School would have access to magic. But Gideon knew that thought\
  \ was merely an attempt to salvage his own pride. <i>You're forgetting you're still\
  \ a student.</i></p> \n     <p>Hoping his pride would be burnished by Corvine's\
  \ letter, Gideon pulled it out and finished reading.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n\
  \      <p><i>as we both know he must be rather connected in government. But he may\
  \ be at sea. Alert whom you can. You're surrounded by bards, I'm sure you can get\
  \ the word out. Sorry this is so rushed. I have good gigs, will report later. Am\
  \ I done? No, I'm never done! But there's no more room and these letters are as\
  \ tiny as I can make them GBYE</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Gideon reread\
  \ the letter and pocketed it. He smiled. The concerns about anything between Corvine\
  \ and Sebastian dissipated like morning mist. He strode jauntily into the snowfall,\
  \ looking here and there for swirling shadows. He took the letter out and read it\
  \ again, put it back in his pocket. He whistled.</p> \n     <p>A dim part of his\
  \ mind replied, <i>You are pathetic, Gideon Gull. Your would-be lover is under threat\
  \ and all you can think of is how relieved you are there's probably no reason to\
  \ be jealous of Sebastian.</i></p> \n     <p>A bright-lit part of his mind said,\
  \ <i>You have that part right, Gideon Gull! But she did say not to be alarmed!</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Pathetic.</p> \n     <p>Whistling, his mind drifted toward the problem\
  \ of a thaumacycle. It was a welcome change after the visions of the fog. Perhaps\
  \ if he completed the work quickly, he could still be involved in the investigation,\
  \ somehow.</p> \n     <p>As his thoughts drifted, so did his path through the snowfall,\
  \ his feet leading him through the city, the deep parts of his mind in charge.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Gideon's boots led him to an empty sliver of city park dominated by\
  \ a bust commemorating the sponsoring royal. Dark trees cradled the air and brought\
  \ a hush to the white cobblestones and granite benches. It reminded Gideon of the\
  \ Verduran Forest that enfolded the border of Andoran and Taldor far to the north.\
  \ He remembered the family trip to Bellis on the Andoren side, and running around\
  \ trees trying to tag Gareth...</p> \n     <p>But best not to think of that day.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He stopped and stretched. Gideon appreciated the park but could never\
  \ remember the benefactor's name, only the patrician expression the sculptor had\
  \ conjured. He decided the royal looked like he'd take chill without a hat, so Gideon\
  \ molded one from snow.</p> \n     <p>The two took up parallel views of the river,\
  \ as men in serious discussion might.</p> \n     <p>\"You know much about women,\
  \ Prince?\" Gideon asked the bust. \"I'm assuming you were a prince. If you appear\
  \ to desire a woman, she frequently edges away. If you give up your desire, she\
  \ frequently returns. This would seem to be perverse behavior, yet I've seen it\
  \ time and again.\"</p> \n     <p>Gideon paused and nodded.</p> \n     <p>\"Yes,\
  \ of course you're right, the obvious stratagem is to pretend a lack of desire.\
  \ And as a performer I normally find pretense as simple as plucking a note. Yet\
  \ in the matter of Corvine Gale, I'm just not myself. For I find, with her, I can\
  \ only <i>be</i> myself. Maddening.\"</p> \n     <p>A long-suffering member of the\
  \ Lighters' Guild shuffled into the park with his pole and began to kindle the park's\
  \ lantern. He stopped to study Gideon as the bard conversed with a stone head. Gideon\
  \ waved. The Lighter muttered a prayer to Abadar, god of cities, and hurried about\
  \ his work.</p> \n     <p>\"True,\" Gideon continued, as if the bust had just lectured\
  \ him, \"she's no flower wilting in the snow. If I want Corvine's attention, I must\
  \ live what, to my lights, is a life of attainment and honor, whether or not she\
  \ consents to share it. She won't want a man whose chief occupation is talking about\
  \ her with rocks. Thank you, Prince.\"</p> \n     <p>The Lighter might have set\
  \ a speed record, for his work was already done, and he padded on. The sky darkened,\
  \ and with the lantern ablaze there was a wash of amber light about the white-frilled,\
  \ dark-wooded branches, as though the park were some old etching in bronze.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The stillness was broken by the sounds of a snapping twig and the unsheathing\
  \ of a blade.</p> \n     <p>Gideon's well-trained ears had alerted, him but couldn't\
  \ make out the exact direction. So he did the prudent thing and scrambled onto the\
  \ bust.</p> \n     <p>A thug was approaching with a dagger, faster now that he was\
  \ discovered. The man wore a leather jerkin and breeches and a fine cloak. Even\
  \ in this prosperous swath of the city, he might pass as a well-to-do merchant or\
  \ a buccaneer who'd fetched a rich haul. For that matter, perhaps he truly was one\
  \ of those things, and was angling for supplemental funds. This was not the finest\
  \ of times for Taldor.</p> \n     <p>\"First snow's beautiful, eh?\" said Gideon.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"It is, good madman, it is!\" said the other. \"Now howsabout you throw\
  \ down your purse, and you can enjoy it with your eyes still in your head?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Crude! Uncouth! Good sir, I've lived in places where mugging is a\
  \ refined art, with certain protocols. I might say, ‘Lovely weather,' and you might\
  \ say, ‘Yes, but it's cold,' and I might say, ‘Ah, and you are seeking a donation\
  \ for those without good winter gear, who've only a rusty knife to see them through,'\
  \ and of course you might say, ‘That's about the size of it,' and then I offer my\
  \ purse out of generosity, you bow, and I run like mad. Civilized!\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"I got your civilization right here.\" The mugger waved the blade. \"Just\
  \ hand it over!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ah, you didn't specify, ‘it.'\" Gideon reached\
  \ into a pouch, but not his coin purse.</p> \n     <p>He pulled forth a small rolled\
  \ piece of parchment, wider at one end, upon which he'd written the aria \"Valley\
  \ of Echoes.\" Under his breath, Gideon incanted strange syllables to the song's\
  \ tune...</p> \n     <p><i>\"Who dares disturb the peace of my park?\"</i> rumbled\
  \ a voice. </p> \n     <p>\"What?\" screeched the mugger. \"Who's there? What was\
  \ that?\"</p> \n     <p>It was Gideon who mouthed the words, but the sounds seemed\
  \ to emanate from elsewhere. <i>\"It is I, Prince</i><i>..</i><i>.\" </i>(he thought\
  \ a moment) <i>\"</i><i>...</i><i>Acerbic, of the</i><i>...</i><i>Age of Enthronement!\"\
  </i> (As the Age of Enthronement had lasted over four and a half thousand years,\
  \ Gideon figured he could tuck an imaginary prince in there somewhere.)</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Where are you hiding?\" The mugger, while frightened, had still not discerned\
  \ that the voice emanated from the bust.</p> \n     <p>Gideon rolled his eyes and\
  \ slapped a hand over his face. He thought of the old Carpenden song \"A Helping\
  \ Hand\" and murmured another incantation as he spread his fingers to keep an eye\
  \ on his assailant.</p> \n     <p>With his other hand he gestured and caused a clump\
  \ of snow to rise from a bench and move toward the thief.</p> \n     <p>\"Boo,\"\
  \ Gideon said, and remotely shoved snow down the man's back.</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ sort of trick was commonplace enough, but the thief was already nervous. He screamed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Some people, if taken by fear, will run. Others will lash out. This\
  \ one was the second kind. He whirled and jabbed madly at the air, shouting, \"\
  Where are you where are you where are you—\"</p> \n     <p>Gideon, a person of the\
  \ first inclination, was already fleeing the scene. He could probably overpower\
  \ the thug, but it wasn't his job to protect the streets, and no amount of training\
  \ was a guarantee when a knife was involved. Besides, the college didn't need a\
  \ criminal investigation on top of their run-in with Matharic, Royal Adjunct Pain\
  \ in the Posterior.</p> \n     <p>Panting, Gideon at last stopped upon the Grand\
  \ Bridge over the River Porthmos.</p> \n     <p>A river. The thought hit Gideon\
  \ like a snowball to the face. <i>The thaumacycle—my characters will escape assailants\
  \ by taking a raft upon the Sellen.</i> That northern river, greater even than the\
  \ Porthmos, churned with more than a thousand miles of adventure and mystery. Where\
  \ better to let loose a raft of vagabonds?</p> \n     <p>His characters would come\
  \ from Galt, he decided. They would flee the guillotines of that failed democracy\
  \ and ride the river south, encountering elves and dwarves and gnomes, crusaders\
  \ and traders and pirates, Andorens and Taldans and druids. They would argue and\
  \ laugh and weep. And sing, of course. At last at the sea, all would be resolved,\
  \ as much as anything in life is resolved. Blood and crescendos.</p> \n     <p>Smiling\
  \ to himself, he nodded to the passersby, for there was always somebody on the bridge.\
  \ He came around the foot of the statue of General Coren, leader of the Third Army\
  \ of Exploration. There was a legend that if you touched Coren's foot you would\
  \ always make a return journey to Oppara. He reached out and patted the statue.\
  \ \"Just in case,\" he murmured.</p> \n     <p>An image came to him unbidden, of\
  \ a small hand touching a huge insectile leg.</p> \n     <p>Gideon stopped in his\
  \ tracks.</p> \n     <p>Snowflakes hit his face like scores of tiny biting insects,\
  \ the kind that attack once and perish. His eyes saw nothing of the bridge or the\
  \ city or the wayfarers who glanced at him curiously.</p> \n     <p>In his mind's\
  \ eye, he was ten years old again, looking up at a monster. It resembled a giant\
  \ beetle with legs like broken halberds, vast green eyes and curved mandibles, and\
  \ antennae that flexed and quivered far out from its nightmarish head. Behind it\
  \ swirled an unseasonably thick, cold fog. His heart was pounding, in the past and\
  \ in the now, and the monster had him half-entrapped by the spears of its legs.\
  \ Yet terrified as he was, the boy Gideon knew the creature didn't mean to eat him.\
  \ An eerie sound like a pipe organ cut through the fog of memory, and Gideon imagined\
  \ the monster turning its head, and the boy following its alien gaze.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Then the vision was gone, and Gideon stood alone on the Grand Bridge.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But he could still hear the dirge.</p> \n     <p>No one else appeared\
  \ to notice. The sound seemed to emanate from somewhere upriver. He moved to the\
  \ eastern edge of the bridge, leaned upon it, and looked out. He had a good view\
  \ of the river and the city. The crescent moon was up, and the lamps were lit everywhere\
  \ except the slum district known as the Narrows.</p> \n     <p>The eerie music came\
  \ louder to his ears, and squinting for a source he saw a ship beyond the city,\
  \ a long way upstream.</p> \n     <p>It was a ship that had no business being that\
  \ far inland. This was a galleon with a sweeping prow and high stern, wide amidships,\
  \ with four spindly masts, and a deep draft. Gideon was no mariner or boatman, but\
  \ even he knew that the river's unseen shallows should gut such a keel.</p> \n \
  \    <p>And perhaps such a fate had already occurred, and this was a dead ship.\
  \ For the vessel was suffused with a ghostly glow. Its torn sails gleamed, its gargoyle\
  \ figurehead glinted, and its crew stood at attention with skeletal poise, eye sockets\
  \ aimed at the Grand Bridge.</p> \n     <p>\"Do you see it?\" Gideon demanded of\
  \ the nearest bystander, a Taldan nobleman. \"Do you see the ship?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The richly garbed man's expression was unreadable. \"There are many ships,\"\
  \ he ventured, with a nod toward the harbor.</p> \n     <p>\"Not like this! Right\
  \ there! Something right out of Blacwin's <i>Wanderloss</i>. Isn't it the spitting\
  \ image of <i>Wanderloss</i>'s adversary, the cursed ship <i>Demonwake</i>?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The man took a step back, then appeared to find his courage. \"Good\
  \ sir...your accent marks you as Andoren, no? You must be a stranger here. I happen\
  \ to contribute to Madame Floret's Home for Troubled Travelers, and I'm sure they\
  \ can assist you with whatever afflicts you. If you'll just come with me...\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Don't you see?\" Gideon looked around at the few other witnesses who\
  \ might validate his vision of the ship (sailing closer, blithely unconcerned about\
  \ the Taldan noble's reaction). All looked at him blankly or with unease. A young\
  \ girl did venture, squinting at the river, \"I think, perhaps, I do see a glint\
  \ of light...\" before her parents hauled her over to watch something suddenly fascinating\
  \ on the bridge's seaward edge.</p> \n     <p>No, Gideon realized, they didn't see.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And even as he'd made the comparison, Gideon had realized that the spectral\
  \ craft didn't simply resemble the fictional <i>Demonwake</i>. It <i>was</i> <i>Demonwake</i>,\
  \ just as he'd seen it in a performance in Almas many years ago. It was correct\
  \ down to the flag of the horned skull above the crossbones and Captain Crookwing\
  \ there in his torn black cape, and his daughter Desdimira beside him, the only\
  \ human-appearing spirit aboard, ready to tempt the similarly dead cabin boy Wickham\
  \ of the <i>Wanderloss</i>.</p> \n     <p>All in a rush the ghost-craft reached\
  \ the bridge, far swifter than a true sailing ship should manage, and as Desdimira\
  \ passed beneath Gideon she looked up at him, mouthing some secret message. Then\
  \ there was a flash of light, and she and her ship were gone. Gone, too, was the\
  \ mournful dirge. Only a trace of bubbles remained below the bridge, and in this\
  \ lunar illumination Gideon doubted even these.</p> \n     <p>No one else nearby\
  \ was looking at the waters.</p> \n     <p>Just at him.</p> \n     <p>The Taldan\
  \ grandee was saying, \"If you'll just hold still a moment, sir, everything will\
  \ be all right...\" The noble inched forward, and was joined by a tough-looking\
  \ sightseer dressed for dockland work. <i>First a thief, and now these excessively\
  \ honorable citizens. A man can't win.</i></p> \n     <p>He bowed. \"Let this be\
  \ a lesson to me. This is what comes of too much opera.\"</p> \n     <p>From his\
  \ spell component pouch he plucked a feather and a clutch of diminutive fruit tarts.\
  \ He stuffed the tarts in his mouth and commenced waving the feather at the dockhand.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What?\" said the man, and with that Gideon blessed his good luck that\
  \ his spell looked too ridiculous to be considered magic. Mouth full, Gideon began\
  \ the incantation.</p> \n     <p>\"Fate and Chance walk into a tavern,\" he said,\
  \ magic embellishing his words. \"‘I wasn't expecting you,' says Chance. ‘Just the\
  \ person I wanted to see,' says Fate, adding, ‘I wanted to play some chess.' So\
  \ they agree to play chess, but every time Fate and Chance flip a coin to see who\
  \ chooses colors, the coin explodes. Every time they pick a taverngoer to choose,\
  \ the taverngoer's head explodes. By now the chess pieces have been so knocked around\
  \ by exploding coins and so bloodstained from exploding heads that you can't tell\
  \ which is white and which is black. And Fate and Chance both smile and say, ‘I\
  \ choose red.'\"</p> \n     <p>The man's eyes got big and he commenced a horrid\
  \ giggling. He collapsed upon the ground, unable to do anything but gasp and titter\
  \ at the cosmic joke.</p> \n     <p>The noble stared at Gideon. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  I can tell another,\" Gideon said.</p> \n     <p>The noble ran toward the far end\
  \ of the bridge and the vagabond camp there, which said something about his desperation.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Gideon wasted no time dashing in the opposite direction, toward the\
  \ city. </p> \n     <p>He had to talk to Xeritian about this. Even if the headmaster\
  \ decided Gideon was insane, Gideon instinctively trusted the man. Once off the\
  \ bridge, Gideon panted in the shadows of an alley and watched the river a little\
  \ longer, until the call of the fire-lit dormitory and his pillow proved too much,\
  \ and he retraced his steps to the college. Apparitions, he decided, could wait\
  \ until morning.</p> \n     <p>But in the morning Headmaster Xeritian was dead.</p>\
