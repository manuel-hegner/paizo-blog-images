  \ \n   <h2>Chapter Three: The Apprentice's Eye</h2> \n   <p>He descended several\
  \ flights of steps, took a number of turns along torch-lit corridors, and came at\
  \ last to the threshold of a windowless cell deep below ground. The glowing orb\
  \ entered and Krunzle did likewise. Once within, the light blinked out, and he had\
  \ a momentary glimpse of a small, winged man fluttering out through the open doorway\
  \ and disappearing along the corridor.</p> \n   <p>Krunzle made to put his head\
  \ through the opening to see the creature more clearly, but the air that filled\
  \ the exit now demonstrated the ability to become a clear, springy substance that\
  \ flung him back into the room. By the light from the corridor, he looked around\
  \ and found an ill-smelling pallet, a rough stool, and a terra cotta oil lamp with\
  \ a wick of greasy wool. He was able to just reach this last item around the edge\
  \ of the door to meet the torch ensconced in the passageway and, with the lamp's\
  \ feeble light, sat down on the stool and took out the scroll.</p> \n   <p>It was\
  \ written in a script that he could read, and he quickly took in what it had to\
  \ tell him. He was to wait until the pixie returned to lead him out of his cell.\
  \ Then he must go to a house in the lower town—a map to find the place, an image\
  \ of its exterior, and a second, multi-leveled map of its interior were provided.\
  \ He was to find his best way in, locate something called an \"apprentice's eye\"\
  ; the note said that the geas he was under would ensure that he recognized the object\
  \ when he saw it.</p> \n   <p><i>You may use whatever means and procedures you deem\
  \ appropriate</i>, said the note, <i>but if you offer violence against any persons\
  \ within the house, the hand you raise will instead strike you where you have already\
  \ felt a blow.</i></p> \n   <p>Once he had achieved the goal of the mission he was\
  \ to bring the apprentice's eye back to Baalariot. The note said that while exiting\
  \ the target area he was encouraged to make as much noise and commotion as possible.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Why would I do that?\" he asked the walls of his cell. He received no\
  \ answer.</p> \n   <p>Krunzle turned over the single sheet of parchment, but there\
  \ was nothing on the other side. He reread the note again and, when he realized\
  \ that the letters were steadily fading away, applied himself to memorizing the\
  \ map before it disappeared.</p> \n   <p>A few moments later, he was left with two\
  \ things: a blank piece of scraped sheepskin and a question. The question was: what\
  \ was an apprentice's eye?</p> \n   <p>Then came a third: an overwhelming urge to\
  \ sleep.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>He\
  \ awoke to find that his various pains had faded. He was also hungry, and was glad\
  \ to find that while he slept someone had brought him a platter of bread and cheese,\
  \ as well as a stoneware jug that proved to contain an almost drinkable wine. He\
  \ refreshed himself, then sat on the stool and contemplated his predicament. He\
  \ failed to see any immediate advantage to being the slave of a spied-upon wizard.\
  \ Nor did he envision that his situation would much improve: as he understood these\
  \ things, spellslingers tended to rely on conjured assistants, like the pixie, for\
  \ their domestic needs. They generally kept no slaves—which meant that upon successful\
  \ completion of his mission, he would become surplus to Baalariot's requirements.\
  \ The wizard would cast around for some useful purpose that a superfluous thief-slave\
  \ could serve. Several images came to Krunzle's mind, none of them encouraging.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>His early education at a rather prestigious rogue’s academy had taught\
  \ him the cardinal rule of the thief's life: always have a plan. He quickly devised\
  \ a scheme that had two parts. Part one: break the enchantment that bound him to\
  \ Baalariot's will. Part two: depart Elidir at maximum speed.</p> \n   <p>He was\
  \ sure he could execute part two with energy and dispatch. Part one, however, remained\
  \ a problem. His mind failed to gain traction, and soon he lacked the leisure to\
  \ pursue the matter, because now the winged manlet returned, hovering in the corridor\
  \ at the center of his globe of light.</p> \n   <p>Krunzle stood and the light moved\
  \ away. He was able to exit the cell as if the air in the doorway was nothing but\
  \ air. He strode after the guide, and noticed that he was not retracing the route\
  \ that had brought him down from Baalariot's chamber. Instead, he and the winged\
  \ fairy-man proceeded deeper into the warren of dark rooms and barely lit corridors\
  \ beneath the wizard's manse, until he came to a narrow space which contained a\
  \ spiral iron staircase leading up and a rough table on which were spread several\
  \ items Krunzle recognized.</p> \n   <p>They had all be taken from his person after\
  \ he had been delivered to the Gyve, and they constituted the tools of his trade:\
  \ picks and slips; grapples and cords; a double-bent tube with mirrors inside that\
  \ bent light and allowed him to peek around corners, under doors, and through windows\
  \ without being seen; and a handful of other objects. </p> \n   <p>Krunzle was glad\
  \ to recover them. Not only were they useful, but as part of his first tasks as\
  \ a journeyman, he had personally made each one of them. Thieves could not usually\
  \ afford much sentimentality, but an exception was made for the toolkit. He disposed\
  \ of them in the various concealed pockets and loops that abounded in his garments,\
  \ and felt slightly better about the course of events.</p> \n   <p>He was given\
  \ little time for satisfaction, however. No sooner had he stowed the last implement,\
  \ than the pixie flew up the staircase, illuminating the darkness above. Krunzle\
  \ experienced a strong desire to follow and began to climb. He noted, with faint\
  \ gratitude, that his groin no longer pained him with every lift of a foot. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>No sooner had he risen out of the small room—it turned out to have been\
  \ the bottom of a shaft—than the globe of light disappeared. In complete blackness,\
  \ Krunzle felt the flying creature flutter past him as it went back to wherever\
  \ it perched when not on duty. He was unable to do likewise and continued to ascend\
  \ until he arrived at a confined space that offered not the slightest glimmer of\
  \ light. He felt in front of him and found a wooden surface which, when he explored\
  \ further and discovered a simple latch, turned out to be a door.</p> \n   <p>But\
  \ thieves' caution prevented him from opening the portal until his searching fingers\
  \ discovered what he expected to find: another moving part at eye level that, when\
  \ he slid it aside, uncovered a peephole. He peered out and saw a darkened Elidiran\
  \ alley, lit only by a few gleams leaking through the closed shutters of houses\
  \ that turned blank walls to the narrow passage.</p> \n   <p>He opened the door\
  \ and stepped out, then looked up at the evening stars to orient himself. The map\
  \ appeared on the screen in his mind—no magic there, but the mental discipline learned\
  \ in the academy and practiced ever since—and he set off for the lower town. His\
  \ route avoided the city's major thoroughfares and plazas, leading him instead along\
  \ narrow, twisting alleys and down flights of stone steps that reeked of urine and\
  \ rotting vegetables. Clearly, he thought, whoever occupied the house to which he\
  \ was headed did not enjoy the elevated social status of the wizard who was sending\
  \ him.</p> \n   <p>The building, when he came to it, was not imposing. Mud brick\
  \ rather than stone, it stood two stories high, with a flat roof; he knew from the\
  \ map, though, that its foundations had been dug down three levels, creating sub-basements\
  \ and even a bottomless pit. Baalariot hadn't said anything, but Krunzle knew enough\
  \ about magic-wielders to have reasoned out that anyone who could steal from a wizard\
  \ was likely to be another practitioner of the arcane arts. Wizardry and subterranean\
  \ chambers seemed to be an infallible combination. Maybe it was a matter of containing\
  \ unruly powers; or maybe it was just that depth muffled the screams.</p> \n   <p>His\
  \ urge to get to the target eased when he came to the mouth of an unlit passageway\
  \ that met the sloping street on which the house stood. His vantage point was several\
  \ doors down from the entrance, which featured a sturdy-looking front door between\
  \ tapered pillars, all carved with some complex design he was too far away to see\
  \ clearly, flanked by two torches that burned with a green flame. There was something\
  \ about the arrangement of the portal that argued less for decor than for defense.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He would not be going through that door. Some thieves preferred the direct\
  \ and obvious approach—get in, grab it, and get out while they're still blinking—\
  but Krunzle was an old-fashioned practitioner of the full art. </p> \n   <p>He wondered\
  \ how much leeway Cardimion's Discriminatory Geas would grant him. Experimentation\
  \ revealed that he could move a certain distance from the target structure, but\
  \ only enough to circumnavigate it. If he tried to go farther, he experienced shaking\
  \ limbs, nausea, and a sense of impending dread. When he struggled to overcome the\
  \ resistance, his fist swung up and struck him sharply in an eye whose surrounding\
  \ flesh was still tender from the wart-nosed torturer's attentions. </p> \n   <p>Trial\
  \ and error over, the thief turned his attention to the house that contained the\
  \ apprentice's eye. The memorized map had highlighted an area in a lower, though\
  \ not lowest, level of the building. There was probably a concealed entrance much\
  \ like the one through which he had made his exit from Baalariot's manse, but it\
  \ would be a waste of time to look for it. He worked his way around the building\
  \ and its neighbors again, seeking the opportunity that would make the task easier.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The house had not been constructed as a detached structure; its sides\
  \ abutted directly against the neighboring buildings; its front was two stories\
  \ of sheer, unbroken mud brick; its rear was separated from the alley behind by\
  \ a walled courtyard, also lit by green flames. </p> \n   <p>The courtyard presented\
  \ easier access but too much light, the thief decided; besides, the rear wall was\
  \ as unwindowed as the front.</p> \n   <p>He examined the buildings to either side:\
  \ one was of stone, tall and solid as a bank, but a half-hidden glyph near the door\
  \ identified it in the language of thieves and street people as a temple of the\
  \ demon Nocticula, which meant that its main use was as a brothel, and not a particularly\
  \ safe one. The other building was a rickety, three-story tenement, with a wooden\
  \ staircase running up the rear wall to give the residents false hope that they'd\
  \ be able to escape in the event of a fire.</p> \n   <p>A lifetime of professional\
  \ experience told Krunzle that a mud-brick building's greatest weakness was in its\
  \ roof. He went up the fire steps with practiced quiet, slipping past the noises\
  \ of clattering pots, squalling babies, and arguing couples, all overlaid by what\
  \ sounded like a semi-skilled musician singing a maudlin love song while endeavoring\
  \ to accompany his cracked voice on an out-of-tune zither. At the top of the stairs,\
  \ a wooden ladder led to the tenement's flat roof. He scaled it and rolled silently\
  \ onto a surface of dried mud overlying matted reeds.</p> \n   <p>The zither player\
  \ was up there, somewhere. But the shadows were thick enough. Krunzle rose to a\
  \ crouch and made his way to the lip of the roof where it overlooked the mud-brick\
  \ house, paused to listen for any sounds that indicated someone might be enjoying\
  \ the upper air—though he was fairly sure the zither-player's amelodic strains would\
  \ have driven indoors all but the profoundly deaf. He slowly raised his head above\
  \ the low parapet until he could see down. The flat space was empty and unlit. Krunzle\
  \ readied a grapnel and its knotted cord.</p> \n   <p>Moments later, he was crouched\
  \ in darkness. He had chosen one of the corners of the roof above the front wall.\
  \ He knew that rooms at the rear of a building were more likely to contain servants\
  \ busy at their tasks; front rooms were for the quality, who more frequently left\
  \ them empty while they sashayed out to enjoy privileges denied their underlings.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He took a small, sharp blade from his toolkit and applied its point to\
  \ the roof's packed-earth surface. The desiccated soil broke into powdery flakes,\
  \ and soon he had exposed a layer of dried reeds laid over a network of thin laths\
  \ of wood. He removed a patch of reeds and beneath it saw the pale gleam of plaster.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>New tools came to his hands. He drilled a tiny hole through the plaster,\
  \ inserted a thin tube fitted with an eyepiece, and a moment later he was seeing\
  \ a fly's eye-view of a sitting room illuminated by brass lamps whose wicks were\
  \ turned low. The decor tended toward erotically curved furnishings and draped swathes\
  \ of faux-soie. The room was otherwise empty.</p> \n   <p>Busy seconds passed, then\
  \ the thief was standing on the thick-pile carpet beneath a Krunzle-sized hole in\
  \ the ceiling. </p> \n   <p>He padded silently to the closed door, opened it, and\
  \ saw a corridor ending in a downward-leading staircase lit from below. He crept\
  \ to the top of the stairs and listened, hearing a faint bustle of kitchen noises\
  \ and beneath it a female voice half-raised in a monotonous chant.</p> \n   <p>He\
  \ went down to the ground floor. The clatter of pots and pans grew louder; it came\
  \ from somewhere to the rear of the building and down another level. The chanting\
  \ also increased in volume; it originated from behind a pair of large, ornate doors\
  \ that must lead into a room that took up all of the ground floor's front. A wizard\
  \ would have his study there, he thought. Or perhaps a witch.</p> \n   <p>Krunzle\
  \ looked about. So far he had seen nothing worth stealing, even if this had been\
  \ a burglary of his own devising. It was possible the apprentice's eye, whatever\
  \ it was, was in the front chamber, being chanted over right this minute. If not,\
  \ it would be somewhere it could be kept safe and perhaps guarded. Again, experience\
  \ told him that somewhere would probably be below ground, behind layers of defense.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He searched his memory for the image of the map Baalariot had provided.\
  \ He recalled the symbols for more downward-leading steps and soon found them, through\
  \ they were behind a double-locked door, strongly made, itself concealed behind\
  \ a wall hanging that depicted a decidedly female person making an intimate though\
  \ unlikely connection with a snake at least twice her length. Krunzle swiftly picked\
  \ the locks, opened the door, and stepped through to a small landing above a set\
  \ of narrow stone steps that circled down into darkness. </p> \n   <div class=\"\

  0\"></a>\n    <br> \"So this is the apprentice's eye.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>A rank\
  \ smell wafted up from the stairwell. Krunzle didn’t recognize the odor, but some\
  \ part of him decided that it was the kind of reek that ought to raise the hairs\
  \ on the back of his neck. Cautiously, ears straining the silent darkness, he began\
  \ to descend.</p> \n   <p>He counted fifty steps before his outstretched hand encountered\
  \ a barrier: another door, also well locked. He again deployed his picks and with\
  \ small effort soon had the way clear. Beyond was yet more darkness, but here the\
  \ acrid stench was far stronger. </p> \n   <p>Krunzle put his head through the doorway\
  \ and looked to either side. There was a dim glow, enough to show him that the door\
  \ opened onto a vaulted subterranean passage. The source of the illumination was\
  \ a thin bar of yellow light that he took to be a leak of lamplight from under a\
  \ door at one end of the corridor. The other end was unlit and ended in a blank\
  \ wall with what seemed to be a pool of stygian black at its foot. <i>The pit</i>,\
  \ Krunzle thought. The stench came from there.</p> \n   <p>Krunzle went on silent\
  \ feet to the source of the light. It was definitely another door, but there were\
  \ no locks, only a thick iron bar that slid into a slot in the stone wall. And,\
  \ his fingers told him, another peephole.</p> \n   <p>The thief peeped, and saw\
  \ a windowless cell not much bigger than the one in which he had spent part of the\
  \ day, but with a good carpet on the floor, a three-wick oil lamp hanging from the\
  \ ceiling, a narrow cot (though with pillow and quilt), and a table and chair.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Seated on the chair, back turned to the door, was a small figure in a\
  \ plain white shift—by the narrowness of the shoulders and the fineness of the golden,\
  \ collar-length hair, either a young woman or an older child. She (or he) was concentrating\
  \ on something in her (or his) lap.</p> \n   <p>Krunzle studied the scene, angling\
  \ to look through the peephole into the corners of the room. He saw no intimations\
  \ of danger. After one last visual sweep, he slid the latch and eased open the door.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The figure in the chair turned and looked up at him over one shoulder—\
  a girl on the cusp of becoming a woman, startled in the act of reading poetry from\
  \ the small book now visible in her grasp. Then surprise turned to excitement tinged\
  \ with pleasure. \"Did he send you,\" she said, \"to rescue me?\"</p> \n   <p>Krunzle\
  \ ignored the girl's question. <i>You will recognize it when you see it</i>, Baalariot's\
  \ note had said. And now, as the thief looked at the slim, young figure, and especially\
  \ at the chain around her neck, and most especially at the amulet that hung from\
  \ it, he knew.</p> \n   <p>He stepped into the cell, reaching for the apprentice's\
  \ eye. It looked like nothing all that special. It was a palm-sized circle of some\
  \ shiny metal, in the center of which was set a large green cabochon. Around the\
  \ rim ran a legend carved in a script he could not read.</p> \n   <p>The young woman\
  \ stood, her face showing alarm. \"Wait!\" she said.</p> \n   <p>\"I can't,\" he\
  \ said, and took hold of the gaudy thing, giving it a yank that expertly parted\
  \ the chain. As he did so, two events occurred: the unfaceted green gem in the center\
  \ turned red; and something cold and strong curled itself around one of his ankles\
  \ and rapidly rose up his leg. The stench that had been so powerful in the corridor\
  \ was overwhelming now.</p> \n   <p>Krunzle held tightly to the amulet—the geas\
  \ made sure of that—at the same time as he tried to shake his leg free of whatever\
  \ had seized it. He looked down and saw a broad, triangular head, clad in leprous\
  \ white scales, its eyes filmed and blind but its forked tongue aflickering. The\
  \ head connected to a thigh-thick, limbless body that continued to slither toward\
  \ him along the floor of the corridor, even as it slid upward and addressed its\
  \ huge strength to the task of squeezing air and life from his torso.</p> \n   <p>He\
  \ toppled headlong onto the carpet as the great snake opened its fanged maw and\
  \ hissed into his face.</p> \n   <p>\"Oh dear,\" said the girl in white.</p> \n\
