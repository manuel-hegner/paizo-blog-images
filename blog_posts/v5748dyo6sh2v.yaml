  \   </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The people of\
  \ Golarion have literally hundreds of gods that they could choose to follow. In\
  \ fact, many people follow the teaching of multiple deities in their everyday life.\
  \ A farmer might pray to Gozreh for rain, Sarenrae for lots of sunlight, and Erastil\
  \ for a good harvest all in the same day. Considering this was a common aspect of\
  \ so many of our characters and stories in Pathfinder, we thought that <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"><i>Lost Omens\
  \ Gods &amp; Magic</i></a> was the perfect time to introduce a way to represent\
  \ polytheism mechanically.</p> \n      <p>Pantheons are groups of related gods that\
  \ can be worshipped either individually or together. In some cases, these gods share\
  \ thematic ties. The farmer mentioned above sees Erastil, Gozreh, and Sarenrae as\
  \ important because of their influence on the farmer’s crops. In other cases, gods\
  \ are all part of the same pantheon due to their common worshippers. Most elves\
  \ worship the same group of elven deities, for example. Sometimes gods might be\
  \ actually related, such is the case with Torag and his family who make up the dwarven\
  \ pantheon.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20200121-torag.jpg\"\

  \ \n      <p><i>Gods &amp; Magic</i> introduces new rules for worshipping pantheons.\
  \ A character can choose to worship a pantheon, which is very similar to the worship\
  \ of an individual deity. A pantheon features a stat block with its own set of alignment\
  \ restrictions, domains, edicts, anathemas, and so on, thus following the same rules\
  \ as the worship of a single deity. Pantheons do have a wrinkle, however. Instead\
  \ of simply worshipping the pantheon, a character must also select a patron deity\
  \ among those that are part of the pantheon. Think of the patron deity as a character’\
  s focus or guide to the specific pantheon. A character worshipping a pantheon must\
  \ follow the edicts and avoid the anathemas of both the pantheon and patron deity,\
  \ with the patron’s edicts and anathema taking precedence. Having a patron deity\
  \ prevents a worshipper from becoming caught between mutually exclusive edicts and\
  \ anathema from all the gods they worship as the worshipper can ultimately fall\
  \ back on the patron’s requirements in conflicting or unusual situations.</p> \n\

  \ \n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Art by Klaher Baklaher</p> \n      </div>\
  \ \n      <p>You could consider gods who are each other’s’ allies. Desna, Shelyn,\
  \ and Sarenrae all work together in their fight against evil and are even known\
  \ to be lovers. If we made a pantheon that included their themes and values, we\
  \ might end up with something like this. </p> \n      <h3>The Prismatic Ray</h3>\
  \ \n      <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> \n       <li><b>Alignment</b> NG\
  \ (LG, NG, CG)</li> \n       <li><b>Areas of Concern</b> Defeating evil, guarding\
  \ innocents, and wholesome creations</li> \n       <li><b>Divine Font</b> <i>heal</i></li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>Divine Ability</b> Wisdom or Charisma</li> \n       <li><b>Divine\

  \       <li><b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <i>sleep</i>, 3rd: <i>fireball</i>, 4th: <i>creation</i>\
  \ </li> \n       <li><b>Edicts</b> Create works that inspire good acts, defend those\
  \ who cannot defend themselves, pursue evil</li> \n       <li><b>Anathema</b> allow\
  \ evil to spread, destroy that which brings joy to others, fail to offer evil a\
  \ chance to surrender</li> \n       <li><b>Favored Weapon</b> shortsword</li> \n\
  \      </ul> \n      <p>Here, I tried to snag a bit from each goddess. I settled\
  \ on the Primastic Ray as a name that represents all three. The various colors represent\
  \ Shelyn, while the ray could be either moonlight for Desna or sunlight for Sarenrae.\
  \ Of course, this is just one take on these three deities. I could have chosen to\
  \ focus more on the travel and freedom aspects of Desna or the healing aspects of\
  \ Sarenrae. What’s fun about pantheons is that you can usually make them however\
  \ you like, so long as they make sense thematically.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ F.G</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Speaking of thematic ties, have you heard of\
  \ Ancient Osirion? Turns out they had lots of deities back in the ancient days.\
  \ Also, did you know that Nethys was originally an Osiriani pharaoh? That’s fun!\
  \ Well, let’s see what we can do with that. <i>Gods &amp; Magic</i> includes rules\
  \ for worshipping the Ancient Osirian gods. A good number of them (Isis, Selket,\
  \ and Thoth to be specific) also have a focus on magic, just like Nethys. If we\
  \ take those four, we might get a pantheon like this one.</p> \n      <h3>Wards\
  \ of the Pharaoh</h3> \n      <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> \n       <li><b>Alignment</b>\
  \ NG (LN, NG, N, CG)</li> \n       <li><b>Areas of Concern</b> Abjuration magic,\
  \ protection, self-improvement</li> \n       <li><b>Divine Font</b> <i>harm</i>\
  \ or <i>heal</i></li> \n       <li><b>Divine Ability</b> Constitution or Intelligence</li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>Divine Skill</b> Medicine</li> \n       <li><b>Domains</b> Family,\
  \ knowledge, magic, protection</li> \n       <li><b>Alternate Domains</b> glyph*,\
  \ healing </li> \n       <li><b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <i>soothe</i>, 4th: <i>resilient\
  \ sphere</i>, 9th: <i>disjunction</i> </li> \n       <li><b>Edicts</b> Use magic\
  \ to defend yourself and your allies, maintain magical wards, seek greater magical\
  \ knowledge</li> \n       <li><b>Anathema</b> Destroy wards that are actively protecting\
  \ innocents, refuse to use your magic to help those in need who ask you</li> \n\
  \       <li><b>Favored Weapon</b> staff</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>All of these\
  \ deities have a focus on magic, but a lot of them are also focused on the protection\
  \ of others or on knowledge. I chose to lean into these aspects a bit, creating\
  \ a pantheon themed around using magic to protect others while still keeping the\
  \ pursuit of knowledge. Nethys is a neutral deity, but I doubt that he would be\
  \ against improving one’s magical skill regardless of what school of magic it’s\
  \ for. As a result, he made a fitting, but very interesting addition to the pantheon.</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20200121-casandalee.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:50%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20200121-casandalee.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Casandalee, goddess of artificial life and free thinking, producing runes\
  \ and mathematical symbols.\"></a> \n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Art by\
  \ Emile Denis</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Let’s try one more pantheon before I\
  \ go. With the focus on knowledge, I want to snag a few knowledge focused deities\
  \ and see what we can create. I start by grabbing Brigh and Casandalee. Then, I\
  \ take Irori as he is an obvious choice. From there, I include Shyka who can understand\
  \ all events throughout time thanks to their unique focus on time. Finally, to introduce\
  \ a little chaos, I’ve added Ydajisk, a protean demigod focused on language. With\
  \ all of those deities, we might get something like this. </p> \n      <h3>Pillars\
  \ of Knowledge</h3> \n      <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> \n       <li><b>Alignment</b>\
  \ N (LN, N, CN)</li> \n       <li><b>Areas of Concern</b> Learning, innovation,\
  \ safeguarding knowledge</li> \n       <li><b>Divine Font</b> <i>harm</i> or <i>heal</i></li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>Divine Ability</b> Intelligence or Wisdom</li> \n       <li><b>Divine\
  \ Skill</b> Crafting</li> \n       <li><b>Domains</b> Creation, knowledge, secrecy,\
  \ truth</li> \n       <li><b>Alternate Domains</b> glyph*, perfection, time* </li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <i>message rune*, </i>, 3rd: <i>hypercognition</i>,\
  \ 9th: <i>retrocognition</i> </li> \n       <li><b>Edicts</b> Seek new knowledge,\
  \ use your knowledge and skill to improve the world around you, protect knowledge\
  \ from becoming lost</li> \n       <li><b>Anathema</b> Choose to use old knowledge\
  \ or tools after they have been improved upon, destroy knowledge, refuse to answer\
  \ a query for which you know the answer</li> \n       <li><b>Favored Weapon</b>\
  \ light hammer</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>Again, this leads to a fun little mishmash\
  \ of different themes and ideas for each of the deities. Some of the most fun comes\
  \ with creating anathemas for the pantheons. Brigh and Casandalee are both goddesses\
  \ related to invention and innovation, so asking a worshipper to make sure they\
  \ are using the latest knowledge and tools is an interesting way to express these\
  \ themes. Ydajisk calls for worshippers to keep old languages—and old knowledge—\
  alive, but they also keep you from holding your tongue when asked a question.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>As you can see, pantheons can make for limitless interesting combinations\
  \ and ideas. We’re looking forward to providing more pantheons in the future, but\
  \ we’re most excited to see what pantheons players and GMs create for their own\
  \ games. You could maybe take the four Horsemen and create a pantheon to worship\
  \ all four. If you like the spirit of competition, you could create a pantheon that\
  \ includes Kurgess and other sporting deities. I’m sure our fans will create lots\
  \ of fun and memorable pantheons in the years to come. If you want to check out\
  \ pantheons, make sure to snag <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"\
