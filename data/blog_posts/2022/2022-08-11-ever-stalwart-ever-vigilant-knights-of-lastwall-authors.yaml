              <h3>Banana C.</h3>
              <p>Hi! I’m Banana and I had the privilege of working on a few of the deities, specifically Iomedae, Pharasma, Ragathiel, and Sarenrae. I had such a great time writing up the rituals involved for each deity, especially Pharasma’s. I’m a sucker for any god of death and goth stuff. Aside from this book, my latest work has been on&nbsp;<em>Suburban Consumption of the Monstrous</em>,&nbsp;<em>Exquisite Crime, Jiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall</em>,&nbsp;<em>Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at House on the Hill 3rd Edition</em>.

              <p>Hi everyone! My name’s Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance author. For&nbsp;<em>Knights of Lastwall</em>, I contributed Avalorex, the Knightly Training and Lastwall Sentry feats, the spells, details on the Eye of Dread region, and—my personal favorite—entries on the gods Arqueros, Kols, and Vildeis, and all the&nbsp;<em>avatar</em>&nbsp;stats. This book was a really fun project to work on and I’m grateful to have been a part of it. Dig in and enjoy!</p>

              <h3>Ryan Costello</h3>
              <p>Hello, I’m Ryan Costello, contributor to&nbsp;<em>Knights of Lastwall</em>&nbsp;and Director of Operations at the Know Direction Network. Until recently, I was always up to my eyeballs in Pathfinder. Now that I’ve stepped away from the Know Direction podcast, it’s more meaningful to me when I get to participate in a Pathfinder project. And what a project!&nbsp;<em>Knights of Lastwall</em>&nbsp;takes the classic imagery of chivalry and combines it with the sensibilities, forward thinking, and creativity that makes the Lost Omens line some of my favorite Pathfinder content ever.</p>
              <p>I especially liked working on the “Other Groups” article and exploring the Charcoal Battalion from Oprak’s Ironfang Legion, the Final Epitaph philosophy of Pharasmin knights, the orcs of the Rampart Warband, and my favorite¬¬: the undead hunting Eagle Knight splinter group known as the Vulture Knights. By eating carrion, vultures play an important role in disease containment in our ecosystem. Tying vultures to hunting undead wrote itself, and I got to cast these vilified creatures as the noblest of heroes. The section I worked on that will probably see the most play is the “Knights of Lastwall Backgrounds” article. As my wonderful developer Luis put it, you can tell I wrote this section by the wordplay.</p>
              <p>You can follow me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/KDRyanCostello">@KDRyanCostello</a>&nbsp;and check out&nbsp;<a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/">knowdirectionpodcast.com</a>&nbsp;for more Pathfinder and other TTRPG enthusiasm and content from me and the rest of the staff.</p>

              <h3>Alastor Guzman</h3>
              <p>Hey, I am Alastor Guzman, your local Mexican game designer. I’m a freelance designer and writer and have worked on several indie games and some bigger projects like&nbsp;<em>Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</em>. I was honored to be able to write some of the factions in the “Other Groups” article as well as some magic items for&nbsp;<em>Knights of Lastwall</em>. It was lots of fun designing new magic items for a Pathfinder book, looking for the mix of utility, purpose, and awe in the items that will see your table. I also enjoyed developing the groups and their interrelationships in a way you can use in your games.</p>
              <p>Besides my work as a freelancer, I have also worked on smaller Mexican projects such as the ENNIE-nominated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/320918/The-Maze"><em>The Maze</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/390489/Tezca-Sentai"><em>Tezca Sentai</em></a>. I am currently working on new projects like a legendary fight system for fantasy RPGs, and fantasy settings based on Mesoamerican mythology. You can follow me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Alastorgv">@alastorgv</a>&nbsp;or support me on&nbsp;<a href="https://ko-fi.com/alastorgv">Ko-fi</a>.

              <h3>Erin Roberts</h3>
              <p>Hi! I’m Erin Roberts, and I loved bringing a little bit of love to this book by writing the married knights Buttons and Fenn Tunwalker, along with the intro to the “Factions” article, a few of the minor factions, and Milani, the Everbloom. While I had a wonderful time writing all of it, creating a couple whose love for each other and the knights they watch over is a source of strength during tumultuous times was particularly meaningful for me, given *gestures at the world*.</p>
              <p>I’ve appeared around these parts in the past as part of&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>&nbsp;(everything is cake!) and in&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Bounty #3: A Green Place</em>, and I have work coming up in&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Travel Guide</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em>. Follow me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nirele">@nirele</a>&nbsp;for more about those projects and other fun things I’m working on!</p>

              <h3>Ashton Sperry (they/them)</h3>
              <p>Howdy! It’s me, your nonbinary freelancer friend on the internet! I wrote the entries on Khagrig Daybreak and Gendowyn in Chapter 2, and the “Broken Lands” and “Other Campaigns” sections in Chapter 4 of&nbsp;<em>Knights of Lastwall</em>. Every project I’ve been on has been a distinct honor and pleasure, working hand-in-hand with my fellow authors as well as our developers to bring this fine material to y’all. With my sections, I got to explore some of the more unusual characters tied to the Knights, which I had a lot of fun doing; “How does a Chaotic Neutral fey queen tie into the faiths of the knighthood?” and “How would my knight character fit into a campaign set in Vudra?” were just some of the questions I got to explore in my submissions for this fine tome. As always, you can find me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/WhoTweetedThis">@WhoTweetedThis</a>&nbsp;where I talk about gaming stuff and post the occasional piece of art. Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy&nbsp;<em>Knights of Lastwall</em>!</p>

              <h3>Isabelle Thorne</h3>
              <p>Hallo everyone! I’m Isabelle Thorne, trans girl and long-time Paizo contributor. I had a big hand in this one, as you might guess from the cover! The Knights of Lastwall really are my baby; I first developed them in the Pathfinder&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>&nbsp;and followed through in&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Legends</em>&nbsp;with the Iomedars, all leading up to this. And they’re the first piece of Pathfinder I really got to shape from the start. So, this is kind of a big moment for me!</p>
              <p>And there’s so much. In addition to most of the section intros and other bridges, I contributed the in-depth looks at the Crimson Reclaimers and Shining Sentinels, and the insight in “Life as a Knight of Lastwall.” I also got to show off some of my NPCs from earlier books, like Beirivelle and Ileana (and Clarethe again!). Additionally, I had the opportunity to explore deities through a knight’s eyes; Kazutal, Falayna, Shelyn (finally!! I’m so happy), and our first look at the Vudrani deity Suyuddha. Finally, I expanded on my knight vigilant and knight reclaimant, plus feats for other archetypes.</p>
              <p>Beyond this momentous occasion, I’m expanding into freelance editing and fiction; you’ll get to see some of that in&nbsp;<em>Queerfinder</em>&nbsp;on Pathfinder Infinite and the recently crowdfunded&nbsp;<em>Sinclair’s Library</em>. Hopefully I’ll have so much more yet to show you. ^_^</p>
