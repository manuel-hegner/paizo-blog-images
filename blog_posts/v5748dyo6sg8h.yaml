  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">In <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkub\">the\
  \ first installment of this blog series</a>, I laid out the principles guiding our\
  \ new incarnation of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. We aren't rebooting the\
  \ game—everything will still work with everything else—but with the new <em>Core\
  \ Set</em>, we're making significant improvements that we've been wanting to make\
  \ for years. I will go through them one by one in the leadup to the game's intended\
  \ launch at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2019</a>.</p> \n    <p>The improvement\
  \ I'm describing today is <em>adding more story</em>. To get what I mean by that,\
  \ you have to understand what we're surrounded by. When you walk into the Paizo\
  \ conference room, you are surrounded by many bookshelves of everything Paizo has\
  \ created. There are hundreds of adventures, novels, rulebooks, setting books, and\
  \ card decks set in the world of Golarion and beyond.</p> \n    <p>For each PACG\
  \ set, we would choose an RPG Adventure Path to adapt—each consisting of six 96-page\
  \ volumes, not counting any supplemental books—and wedge that story onto 1 Adventure\
  \ Path card, 7 adventure cards, and about 35 scenario cards, each of which would\
  \ have at most 70 words on it. That meant we had to condense 576 pages of roleplaying\
  \ game text into about 3,000 words spread across 43 poker-sized cards.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>To say we fell short of the full grandeur of the Pathfinder world would be\
  \ underselling it. You had to interpret so much from the cards that our community\
  \ members wrote their own story guides to help explain the stories we were telling\
  \ to others.</p> \n    <p>Meanwhile, over on aisle <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/acg\"\
  >Adventure Card Guild</a>, we were doing something very different indeed. Our story\
  \ authors were cranking out brand new epics. We would plot out major adventure arcs\
  \ and then we would <i>write</i>. Each page—one scenario, say—would have an entire\
  \ story, with a setup, gameplay, and development, and the text for one page would\
  \ often have more story text than an entire adventure worth of cards in the main\
  \ box. This is much harder work, but it helped make our Adventure Card Guild games\
  \ even more fun than our base set games.</p> \n    <p>For example, here's a scenario\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy9h4s?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-14-The-Mighty-and-the-Righteous\"\
  ><em>Season of the Righteous Adventure 4</em></a>: The Mighty and the Righteous.\
  \ The characters are in the Abyss, having just barely escaped the dark clutches\
  \ of the demon-angel Shamira.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0104E-B.jpg\"><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0104E-B_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <br><i>We probably had a reason to name these scenarios after lyrics\
  \ from <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>'s \"The Time Warp,\" but it's lost to\
  \ the ages.</i>\n     <p></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>You can see how much fun I had\
  \ writing this. Thinking back on it, there was no reason we couldn't have that much\
  \ fun writing the box sets as well. Organized play had the right idea.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>So, we stole it.</p> \n    <p>For the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse of the\
  \ Crimson Throne</em>, I'm diving much deeper into the stories of the adventures\
  \ we're adapting. <em>Core</em> had us searching for the perfect story to tell an\
  \ introductory adventure: if this was your first encounter with PACG, we wanted\
  \ it to be a memorable one.</p> \n    <p>Enter <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvy\"><em>The\
  \ Dragon's Demand</em></a>, a brilliant bit of creativity by <a href=\"https://www.mikeshel.com/iconoclasts-series\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Aching God</em></a> author Mike Shel. This is NOT Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous. You don't exactly become mythic demigods in this one. Instead,\
  \ you get stuck in a Podunk town and have to figure out whether the townsfolk are\
  \ being harassed by a long-dead dragon. If you win, you save the town. If you lose,\
  \ well, that's just how Golarion goes sometimes. It's a great adventure where everybody\
  \ in it takes themselves very seriously and yet you just have the sense that no\
  \ one really thought their plans through too well.</p> \n    <p>The first step on\
  \ this road was to set fire to the Adventure Path, adventure, and scenario cards.\
  \ You heard me, they're gone. Poof. Instead, I'd write a storybook (a term I stole\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy9sct\"><em>Apocrypha</em></a>) which had all the\
  \ adventure content and a lot more story.</p> \n    <p>I cracked open a Word document\
  \ and started figuring out what I needed to do to tell that story. One consideration\
  \ was this: We wanted to make our Adventure Path boxes like <em>Curse</em> physically\
  \ a lot smaller than before. I once walked into my favorite restaurant/board game\
  \ store, <a href=\"https://www.moxboardinghouse.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mox Boarding\
  \ House</a>, and saw an employee sorting Netrunner cards under a hanging rack of\
  \ all my Pathfinder box sets. I gently asked him \"Do those ever fall on you?\"\
  \ and he said \"Oh, all the time,\" and I thought \"Man, I am not going to jail\
  \ for THAT.\"</p> \n    <p>So we wanted to cut it down a bit. The <em>Core Set</em>\
  \ will come in a 9\"×12\" box—that's just a little larger than the <a href=\"/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</em></a>—that holds your cards, dice, pawns (more\
  \ on that later), and rulebooks. And <em>Curse</em> will be even smaller than that:\
  \ 7.5\"×9\"—just a bit bigger than the <a href=\"/products/btpy9kfe\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Pocket Edition</em></a>. And <b>all</b> of <em>Curse</em> will be in that\
  \ box—no more individual adventure boxes, and no more five-month delays between\
  \ the first part and the last. You'll buy it all at once and you can blast through\
  \ it as fast as you like. You want it, you got it.</p> \n    <p>To play with it,\
  \ you'll shuffle the cards from your <em>Curse</em> set into your <em>Core Set</em>.\
  \ This is a trick we pulled on <em>Apocrypha</em>, and it really works. Since you\
  \ can easily tell the cards from the sets apart, you can quickly pull out the ones\
  \ you don't need and shuffle in the ones you do need. It takes only a few minutes\
  \ to change the whole play experience.</p> \n    <p>But Vic noted that the 7.5\"\
  ×9\" Adventure Path box meant we couldn't just use the Adventure Card Guild's 8.5\"\
  ×11\" page format, at least not without some TARDIS-like technology making it bigger\
  \ on the inside. I proposed we turn the page sideways and fold it in half, making\
  \ each scenario a two-page spread in a 5.5\"×8.5\" storybook. That gave me a fair\
  \ amount of room to play with. But I had a lot to wedge in there. After some brainstorming\
  \ with art director Sarah Robinson and graphic designer Sonja Morris, we found a\
  \ layout I could work with. Here's what it looks like right now. (It will have additional\
  \ attention from the art team before it's done.)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180906-Sample_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <br><i>Here's a scenario spread from <i>The Dragon's Demand</i>.</i>\n\
  \     <p></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Okay, try not to go down the rabbit-hole on all\
  \ those new terms like \"hourglass,\" \"small location,\" \"heal,\" \"story bane,\"\
  \ \"closing henchmen,\" \"Proxy A,\" and \"danger.\" I'll get to those soon, I promise.\
  \ For now, let's just talk big picture.</p> \n    <p>This scenario shows how we\
  \ put real story into a two-page spread. We get an evocative introduction that draws\
  \ you into the scenario. Then there's a section on setup and another one on what\
  \ you do during play, plus a location list. We have a nice space for art, then the\
  \ conclusion to the story and its rewards. It's a nice-looking layout, even before\
  \ Sarah and Sonja get to prettying it up.</p> \n    <p>That's a lot better than\
  \ anything that would fit on a card, I think. Let us know what you think of this!</p>\
