  >Part 3 of the <a href=\"/returnoftherunelords\">Return of the Runelords Adventure\
  \ Path</a> is on its way, and with it, the situation for Varisia in this latest\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Path kicks into high gear. Just in case there are potential\
  \ players of the campaign checking this blog post out, I'll refrain from getting\
  \ too \"spoilery\" about things, but one of my favorite parts about this Adventure\
  \ Path lies in the fact that it's a sequel. This allows us to not only make some\
  \ assumptions about characters we've established in prior adventures and campaigns,\
  \ but lets us have old favorites, be they friends or foes, come back to enjoy some\
  \ time in the limelight one more time. Folks have doubtless already noticed a few\
  \ familiar faces in the first two adventures, be they Pathfinder agents or Vancaskerkin\
  \ agents, but with the third adventure, Richard Pett's <i>Runeplague</i>, one of\
  \ these older NPCs is getting more than a cameo role.</p> \n     <p>The last time\
  \ we saw Clegg Zincher, he was having a real bad day on the small isle of Devil's\
  \ Elbow just south of Riddleport. In <i>Runeplague</i>, we find out that his mis-adventures\
  \ during the Second Darkness Adventure Path were but the start of a long, downward\
  \ spiral into trouble. Once a significant mover and shaker in Riddleport's government,\
  \ Clegg's prior clash with a group of heroes has left him in hard times. Now, as\
  \ the PCs will learn in this adventure, Clegg's in more trouble than ever, even\
  \ if he doesn't realize it, and rather than face the PCs in battle he's going to\
  \ have to rely upon them for salvation!</p> \n     <p>In <i>Runeplague</i>, though,\
  \ we don't just go to Riddleport. I challenged Richard Pett with a tall order—\"\
  Write me an adventure where the PCs go to all four of the significant cities of\
  \ Varisia—Magnimar, Riddleport, Korvosa, and Kaer Maga.\" He knocked it out of the\
  \ proverbial park, with each of this adventure's four parts having a very distinct\
  \ feel and theme. All of which builds to a climax that, I suspect, some folks won't\
  \ see coming!</p> \n     <p>In closing, I'll leave one more cryptic hint—there's\
  \ another reason I wanted Richard Pett to write <i>Runeplague</i>. The time was\
  \ right, after all, for another favorite villain from the past to rise once more!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But I promised to keep the spoilers as light as possible. So let me\
  \ just close by showing off some cool art from <i>Runeplague</i>!</p> \n     <div\
