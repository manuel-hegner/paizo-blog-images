  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">When I was given the assignment\
  \ to write <em>Assault on the Crucible</em>, the conclusion to the Dawn of Flame\
  \ AP, I immediately knew it was going to be a challenge. Most of the adventure is\
  \ a base invasion; some might even call it a “dungeon crawl in space.” But how was\
  \ I to avoid the pitfalls that a dungeon crawl can bring?</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-crucible.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"the crucible\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-right: 25px; padding-bottom:\
  \ 25px;\"></a> \n     <p>The way I saw it, <em>Assault on the Crucible</em> had\
  \ to have multiple paths. There had to be several competing factions inside the\
  \ base, and more than one way for the PCs to gain critical information they could\
  \ then use to make interesting choices. I set a goal for myself: I wanted an adventure\
  \ in which every table had a different experience. It’s my hope that, when players\
  \ get together to share their stories of the Crucible, no two groups will have the\
  \ same story to tell.</p> \n     <p>I also wanted to create a sense of urgency and\
  \ tension. This led to the development of a countdown system that represents General\
  \ Khaim’s attack on the Burning Archipelago on the surface of the sun. The longer\
  \ the PCs take in the Crucible, the more damage is done to the Archipelago; every\
  \ encounter forces the PCs to make a choice: Is this a fight we absolutely have\
  \ to have? I also added encounters that allow the PCs to undermine Khaim’s forces\
  \ directly, partially rewinding the Countdown.</p> \n     <p>This is a high-level\
  \ adventure, which means accommodating PCs armed with big, splashy, abilities. I\
  \ spent a lot of time thinking about how PCs could quickly gather information with\
  \ arcane eye, a mechanic’s scoutbot, an operative with cloaking field, or divination\
  \ and mind probe. In an adventure filled with outsiders, dismissal and planar binding\
  \ become important spells. I didn’t want to create a bunch of roadblocks to these\
  \ powers. Instead, I wanted to make an adventure in which player characters had\
  \ to use all their big guns if they were to have a chance of success. I wanted to\
  \ not just permit and reward the use of high-level abilities, I wanted to make them\
  \ an absolute necessity.</p> \n     <p>There’s so much more I could say about <em>Assault\
  \ on the Crucible</em>. Writing it was a tremendous challenge, and I had the incredible\
  \ help and support of Chris S. Sims, developer on this project and my friend. But\
  \ my turn for talking is done, and now it’s your turn. </p> \n     <p>I want to\
  \ know how you survived the Crucible… <em>if</em> you survived!</p> \n     <p style=\"\
