  \ Alahazra</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, June 23, 2010</p> \n    <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>Only those who refuse to see truth are truly\
  \ blind. Such is the verdict of Alahazra, bride of the sun and prophet of the burning\
  \ sands.</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>Alahazra was born in a small Rahadoumi town\
  \ east of Manaket, one of the many way stations on the caravan route known as the\
  \ Path of Salt, which leads from Azir all the way to distant Sothis and takes its\
  \ name from the waves of the Inner Sea and the dried tears of the slave chains that\
  \ march along it. The daughter of a wealthy and widowed wainwright, Alahazra wanted\
  \ for nothing, growing up with the best tutors money could buy, all the time being\
  \ groomed for a potentially lucrative marriage, or perhaps even induction into the\
  \ Occularium, Manaket's prestigious wizard's college.</p> \n     <p>All of that\
  \ changed on the morning when sixteen-year-old Alahazra woke to find herself suddenly\
  \ and inexplicably blind, her eyes clouded by a white mist that gave her only vague\
  \ outlines of her surroundings. Beside himself with grief, her father called in\
  \ the best healers to be found in the godless land, only to discover that the situation\
  \ was worse than he could have imagined. For when the bards with the healing touch\
  \ reached out to the fevered child, they were suddenly cast back by a blast of flames\
  \ that burned the girl's sickbed but left her magically unharmed. Yet even this\
  \ might have been bearable, had the fleeing bards not revealed the rest of their\
  \ discovery: that the girl's flames bore no hint of sorcery or arcana. Though Alahazra's\
  \ staunchly atheist father could scarcely believe it, his proper Rahadoumi household\
  \ harbored a burgeoning cleric.</p> \n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <div align=\"\

  \ </tbody>\n    </table>\n   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Confronted by her\
  \ enraged father and frightened by the new abilities that she felt burning inside\
  \ her skin, Alahazra protested her innocence loud and long, but to no avail. Sickened\
  \ by what he saw as a betrayal of both his trust and his national pride, Alahazra's\
  \ father did his daughter a final kindness and cast her out with no more than the\
  \ clothes on her back, instructing her to run before the Pure Legion arrived to\
  \ take her into custody—and let her gods be her new family, for she no longer had\
  \ one in Rahadoum.</p> \n    <p>Blind, weak, and weeping with frustration and rage,\
  \ Alahazra stumbled southeast into the desert, seeking what meager shade and water\
  \ the badlands had to offer. For days she wandered, seeking only to put distance\
  \ between herself and any pursuers who might still seek revenge for her presumed\
  \ heresy, until at last she collapsed in the lee of a dune, dehydrated and dying.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It was there, staring up through milky cataracts at the burning ball\
  \ of the sun and letting the wind slowly bury her in the hot sand of the dunes,\
  \ that Alahazra had her first revelation. Behind those ruined eyes, a vision of\
  \ debilitating color suddenly exploded. In it, Alahazra saw herself not as she was,\
  \ but as she one day would be—strong, proud, and fierce. In that moment, Alahazra\
  \ understood that she was more than just a girl. She was a force of the desert—\
  a voice of sun, sand, and flame—and she would bring its truth to the people, whether\
  \ they were ready for it or not. Baking slowly in the hot coals of the great Garundi\
  \ desert, Alahazra came to know herself, and in doing so first harnessed the magical\
  \ flames that had been building inside her.</p> \n    <p>With the aid of her newfound\
  \ abilities, Alahazra moved steadily east, crossing into Thuvia and following the\
  \ Path of Salt until she finally came to rest in Osirion. There she roamed as she\
  \ willed through the great cities and barren plains, offering wisdom and healing\
  \ to the righteous and cleansing fire to the wicked. In time, her notoriety grew,\
  \ offering her passage into higher social circles, and it's whispered that she made\
  \ consorts and admirers of several powerful men, possibly even entering the court\
  \ of the Ruby Prince. Alahazra herself, however, speaks little of her past. For\
  \ her, only the future is a concern, and her duty is to defend it as best she can,\
  \ with a clarity of vision that disdains sight.</p> \n    <p>Now a grown woman,\
  \ and still attractive enough to turn the heads of slaves and rich men alike, Alahazra\
  \ is kind but distant, often letting conversation drop in favor of taking in the\
  \ sounds and smells of her environment. When she does speak, in her low, throaty\
  \ voice, her words have the weight of command. Alahazra has little patience for\
  \ fools (most notably those who let money or pride blind them to truth and justice),\
  \ yet also has a soft spot for orphans, and in her own stern way often sees herself\
  \ as the mother to her adventuring companions. Though she maintains that she has\
  \ never worshiped a god—the cornerstone of her bitterness toward both her father\
  \ and her homeland—she has come to respect a wide variety of deities, whom she refers\
  \ to as \"powerful and strategic allies.\" And while her detractors might call her\
  \ cold, in battle Alahazra's burning rage—especially toward injustice and intolerance—\
  still comes roiling out in a wall of divine flame. </p> \n    <p>James L. Sutter\
