  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">You've asked, so we've answered! Last August,\
  \ we released seven <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks\">Class Decks</a>\
  \ for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. These decks provide new characters and\
  \ boons that can be added to any PACG Adventure Path, and they're your gateway to\
  \ the Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild Organized Play program. You've made\
  \ it clear that you want more, and we're happy to oblige.</p> \n    <p>This August,\
  \ we'll begin new monthly Class Deck releases, starting with the <b>paladin</b>\
  \ in August, the <b>monk</b> in September, and the <b>druid</b> in October. After\
  \ we complete the 11 core classes with the <b>barbarian</b> in November, we'll begin\
  \ exploring classes outside the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</em>.\
  \ As with the previous Class Decks, each deck contains 109 cards, including boons\
  \ that can take your character from the start to the end of any Adventure Path.\
  \ Meet Maznar, a character from the upcoming Druid Class Deck:</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Mariusz Gandzel</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Maznar\
  \ is part of a small sect of dwarf druids revered by his people and by many inhabitants\
  \ of wild places. He follows the Green Faith, a philosophy that commands respect\
  \ for nature. Maznar draws on the power of his spells and his animal friends to\
  \ protect himself and his party.</p> \n    <p>There's one big difference between\
  \ the previous seven Class Decks and the new one. After hearing a lot of feedback,\
  \ we decided to focus each new deck on three characters instead of four. This allows\
  \ us to add more support for each character and her roles throughout her entire\
  \ progression while continuing to bring you innovative character designs. <a href=\"\
