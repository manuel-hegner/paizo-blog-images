  >With only a couple of weeks left in this year, the Pathfinder Society team finds\
  \ itself working feverishly to wrap up loose ends before taking a few days to relax\
  \ and visit friends and family. I'm heading out this week, with Linda and John a\
  \ few days behind me. But never fear! Come January, we all will be diving back into\
  \ work, finalizing plans on Season 9 and getting the rest of Season 8 ready for\
  \ our players!</p> \n     <p>One of the loose ends we tied up neatly was our first\
  \ quarter 2017 travel. This year, we shared some of the traveling so that everyone\
  \ on the team has the opportunity to meet and greet our players.</p> \n     <p>First\
  \ up, John travels to Columbia, South Carolina to attend S.C.A.R.A.B the weekend\
  \ of January 13th-16th. This is one of the 5 largest conventions on the Pathfinder\
  \ Society calendar. Organized by RVC Del Collins and his team, this convention offers\
  \ a full slate of Pathfinder Society goodies. On offer, a variety of Roleplaying\
  \ Guild scenarios and quests, as well as the pregenerated character scenarios <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9lzy\"><em>#7-98 Serpents' Ire</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbd\"\
  ><em>#7-99 Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a>. The Season 8 interactive special, <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9mbe\"><em>The Cosmic Captive</em></a> runs during the Saturday\
  \ 8 PM slot. New this year, offerings of the Adventure Card Game and Adventure Card\
  \ Guild play. Check out their website at <a href=\"http://www.s-c-a-r-a-b.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">here</a> for more information.</p> \n     <p>Attendees of TotalCon\
  \ in Marlborough, Massachusetts, get a double header of Paizo Staff. Designer Mark\
  \ Seifter accompanies PFS developer Linda Zayas-Palmer to the convention occurring\
  \ from February 23rd to the 26th. Besides a full slate of Pathfinder Society activities,\
  \ two offerings of retired scenario <a href=\"/products/btpy88ll\"><em>#21 The Eternal\
  \ Obelisk</em></a>. Venture-Captain Ray Diaz, who is organizing the convention,\
  \ has information on how seats at Linda &amp; Mark's tables will be allocation.\
  \ Visit the<a href=\"http://www.totalcon.com\" target=\"_blank\">TotalCon website</a>\
  \ for full details on this convention.</p> \n     <p>My first trip is to Nevada\
  \ and the Las Vegas Open the weekend of February 3rd to 5th. While predominately\
  \ a war-game and miniatures convention, organizers branched out to roleplaying in\
  \ their offerings this year. We have a full slate of activities organized by Venture-Captain\
  \ Ethan Cline. I'll be running the retired scenario <a href=\"/products/btpy860c\"\
  ><em>#09 Eye of the Crocodile King</em></a> on Sunday afternoon, as well as participating\
  \ in other Pathfinder Society games. For more information on the convention, check\
  \ out their <a href=\"https://lasvegasopen.squarespace.com\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We hijacked designer Stephen Radney-McFarland and named him an honorary\
  \ Pathfinder Society team member as well. Stephen travels to Everett, Washington,\
  \ from January 13th to 15th for OrcaCon. Besides his normal shenanigans, he is running\
  \ a table of <a href=\"/products/btpy884w\"><em>#19 Skeleton Moon</em></a>, another\
  \ retired PFS scenario. Besides Stephen, you can catch up with several other Paizo\
  \ staffers participating in a variety of panels. Come out to the convention, say\
  \ hi, and join in some fun! More information for OrcaCon may be found on their <a\
  \ href=\"https://orcacon2017.sched.com\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Speaking of conventions. There still is time to submit an application to\
  \ be a 2017 convention lead or sub-lead for some of our biggest shows, including\
  \ PaizoCon, Gen Con, and PAX West. Check out <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljd6\"\
  >last week's Pathfinder Society blog</a> for the specifics!</p> \n     <p>Next week,\
  \ John gives us a peek into the December scenarios #8-10 and #8-11. I'll be back\
  \ once more before the end of the year, with tales of sun, dice, and loads of Pathfinder\
  \ Society. So happy holidays to all and see you on the 26th!</p> \n     <p>Until\
  \ next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized\
  \ Play Coordinator</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder\
