  >I’ve attached files containing the transcript of <em>Live Audition Extreme!</em>\
  \ along with the raw footage you requested and a few post-production versions. Essentially,\
  \ we have two options to choose from for our pilot episode. The first is uncut footage\
  \ shot on Kelikazord. Second, we have a cut that removes all unscripted content\
  \ related to the on-site translator malfunction. Which version to utilize is ultimately\
  \ your decision, but after talking with the other producers, they think the unedited\
  \ footage could be a fun way to spin the unpredictable nature of the program. I’\
  m available to meet whenever you’re ready to share your thoughts.</p> \n     <p\

  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> Aaaaaand action! Who’s ready for an\
  \ extreme casting call?! For today’s special broadcast, we’re here on scenic planet\
  \ Kelikazord recruiting the next team of superstars for our mega-hit series, <em>Live\
  \ Adventure Extreme!</em> Everything about this world, including the ground we’\
  re standing on right now, is one hundred percent alive. Now that’s extreme! The\
  \ weather’s mostly sunny, but we’ve got some cloud cover rolling in—our orbital\
  \ scans tell us those green clouds are highly toxic gases. Good thing I don’t need\
  \ to breathe, am I right? But you’re not here for a weather report, are you, dear\
  \ viewers? It’s about time to meet our contestants. Let’s see if they have what\
  \ it takes to become the next Extreme Adventurers! Alright, folks, why don’t you\
  \ introduce yourselves to our audience back home? Contestant Number One, you’re\
  \ up first. Tell us your name and why you want to be on the show.</p> \n      <p><b>Alien\
  \ #1:</b> (Speaking alien language)</p> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> What’s that? Wait\
  \ a minute, the translator’s not working. Wazasha, get the field-tech team on this\
  \ ASAP, will you? </p> \n      <p><b>Wazasha:</b> I’m already on it.</p> \n    \
  \  <p><b>Zo!:</b> Excellent! I knew I could count on you.</p> \n      <p><b>Wazasha:</b>\
  \ Watch where you’re pointing those finger guns, boss.</p> \n      <p><em>(Zo! laughs)</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> Haha, safety first, you got it. Now where was I? Right!\
  \ As I was saying, today we’re here for an eeeeeeexclusive first-contact scenario\
  \ with some up-and-coming reality stars from the Vast looking to break into the\
  \ Pact Worlds scene! That’s right! We’re here with three representatives of cultures\
  \ never before encountered in the Pact Worlds, folks, and they’re ready to show\
  \ you what they’re made of!</p> \n      <p><b>Alien #2:</b> (Speaking alien language)</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> Oh, I can tell they’re building up to something big! Contestant\
  \ Number Two here seems like a real pro, you can just tell by the way they move\
  \ that they’ve got some serious combat training. Ex-military, maybe?</p> \n    \
  \  <p><b>Wazasha (muffled):</b> They’re just standing around, Zo!</p> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b>\
  \ Let’s get the cameras in there, then. That might spice things up.</p> \n     \
  \ <p><em>(Buzzing and whirring sounds, followed by a series of clicks)</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> See now, what did I tell you? </p> \n      <p><em>(Deep\
  \ rumbling and growling sounds)</em></p> \n      <p><b>All Aliens:</b> (Yelling\
  \ in alien language)</p> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> —that thing! </p> \n      <p><em>(Loud\
  \ bestial roar)</em></p> \n      <p><b>Wazasha:</b> What is that?</p> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b>\
  \ That, Wazasha, is the talent! Feast your eyes upon today’s obstacle, folks. As\
  \ tall as a Vercite skyscraper, it’s a horrific sight beyond your wildest nightmares!\
  \ Look at those horns, those teeth! It could tear any of us in half just like snapping\
  \ a toothpick. Oh, it’s extreme, all right. And our three brave contestants are\
  \ going to take it down!</p> \n      <p><em>(Roaring, followed by frantic yelling\
  \ in alien language, grunts, and combat sounds)</em></p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> Oh, look at that. Number Two’s charging right in there.\
  \ It’s a good thing they’ve got that armor, because those teeth look nasty. Contestants\
  \ One and Three are setting up for some extreme teamwork. Whoa! Three boosted One\
  \ right up to smack the beast in the face with her blade. Ouch, that looked like\
  \ it hurt! Our three contestants just scored first blood! </p> \n      <p><em>(Howling,\
  \ then a resounding thud)</em></p> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> The beast retaliates!\
  \ Wow, Contestant Number Three went flying. I hope she’s okay! We’ll have our medical\
  \ team take a look after the fight. Oh, there goes One ripping into the monster’\
  s leg. Way to fight back, One!</p> \n      <p><em>(Grunting and yelling in alien\
  \ language.)</em></p> \n      <p><b>Wazasha:</b> Translator’s back online.</p> \n\
  \      <p><b>Zo!:</b> Excellent! Now we can get some extreme reactions from our\
  \ contestants. Alright, Number Two, can you tell me about your team’s combat strategy?</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Alien #2 (panting):</b> I thought this was a casting call!</p> \n\
  \      <p><b>Alien #1 (wincing):</b> Yeah, we prepared a traditional Kelikan opera\
  \ for—oh no, it’s coming, dodge!</p> \n      <p><b>Alien #2:</b> Thanks! It almost\
  \ took my head off with that hit.</p> \n      <p><b>Alien #1:</b> We thought we\
  \ were auditioning for a variety show.</p> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> What an extreme\
  \ miscommunication! But I’m sure Kelikan opera is lovely. Why don’t you go ahead\
  \ and share that performance with the audience?</p> \n      <p><b>Alien #2:</b>\
  \ We need Uaya to sing the bassline, and she’s out cold. </p> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b>\
  \ Wazasha?</p> \n      <p><b>Wazasha (sighing heavily):</b> I’m already on it, boss.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><em>(Sound of a trigger clicking)</em></p> \n      <p><b>Alien #3:</b>\
  \ Huh? What happened? Did we get the part?</p> \n      <p><b>Alien #1:</b> The smiling\
  \ dead man wants us to sing now. </p> \n      <p><b>Alien #3:</b> While we’re fighting\
  \ this thing?!</p> \n      <p><b>Aliens #1 and #2:</b> Yes.</p> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b>\
  \ You betcha! Three, you should be feeling pretty spry right about now. My assistant\
  \ just shot you with AbadarCorp’s new “Get Up ‘N’ Go” serum, a healing and enhancing\
  \ vitamin cocktail, available at pharmacy superstores near you! Alright Contestant\
  \ Number Three, hit us with that beautiful bassline.</p> \n      <p><b>Alien #3\
  \ (clearing throat):</b> Here goes. And a one, two, three—</p> \n      <p><b>Alien\
  \ Beast:</b> If they actually start singing, I’m done here. </p> \n      <p><b>Alien\
  \ #2:</b> Wait, the monster we’re fighting can talk, too?</p> \n      <p><b>Alien\
  \ Beast:</b> And how do you think I negotiated my contract? I possess the powers\
  \ of speech, but it seems you drew conclusions about my intellect based on my physical\
  \ appearance. How rude. Now listen here, Zo!, my agent said I could be on your show\
  \ if I beat up these weaklings. I took one of them out and you woke her up to belt\
  \ out showtunes? Preposterous. I’m calling my agent.</p> \n      <p><em>(Sounds\
  \ of alien beast stomping off)</em></p> \n      <p><b>Zo!:</b> What a wild turn\
  \ of events! A ferocious fight to the death gives way to a surprise musical performance,\
  \ starring our three remaining contestants. You don’t want to miss it, folks. But\
  \ first, let’s hear a word from our sponsor: AbadarCorp, makers of the new “Get\
  \ Up ‘N’ Go” serum!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p><em>[end transcript]</em></p>\
