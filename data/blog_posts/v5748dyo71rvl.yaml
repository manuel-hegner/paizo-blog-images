  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“OK, self,” Dae\
  \ said to their reflection without realizing they were speaking out loud. “You’\
  re about to knock the socks off this planet! You’re one lucky cat, you know, but\
  \ you’ve also got nerve and plenty of raw talent—the makings of a real star! Now\
  \ let’s get out there and make Miiyu look even more amazing than she already is!”\
  </p>\n      <p>The pahtra performer closed their eyes for just a moment and took\
  \ a deep breath, attuning to the vast power of the stars that filled them with inner\
  \ light. After a long and deliberate exhale, they checked their outfit one last\
  \ time. Would adding more glitter to their fur would be overdoing it? No, there’\
  s no such thing as too much glitter. They did one more spray, spinning around in\
  \ the cloud as it covered their guard hairs in iridescent splendor. Beyond the walls,\
  \ they could hear the crowd chanting for Miiyu in unison with steadily increasing\
  \ excitement. It didn’t matter that the chant wasn’t for Dae; the energy alone was\
  \ enough to make them feel as though they could fly. They absently adjusted the\
  \ woven bracelet on their left arm, smiling widely as they slinked to the curtain,\
  \ opening it ever so slightly to steal a peek at the audience—</p>\n      <p>—and\
  \ drew in a sharp breath.</p>\n      <p>There, standing in the front row, was a\
  \ lizard-like humanoid that was clearly trying to blend in and failing spectacularly.\
  \ It wasn’t that vesk were unknown or completely unwelcome on this planet; it was\
  \ her body language that caught Dae’s attention. While she tried to appear as excited\
  \ as two ysoki hanging off the railing to her right, the expression never quite\
  \ reached her eyes, which were darting around as she took stock of her surroundings.\
  \ That’s when Dae noticed the outline of a weapon under her jacket, and a shoulder\
  \ bag brimming with something that could have been eggs but were more likely to\
  \ be some sort of explosive devices. A flash of light reflected off what Dae had\
  \ initially clocked as a piece of jewelry. It was a three-pronged imperial sigil,\
  \ sharp as the claw of their cruel war god.</p>\n      <p>“A Veskarium trooper in\
  \ the front row? Oh, come on!” Dae muttered.</p>\n      <p>Another vesk joined the\
  \ first. He was doing a better job of blending in, but not by much. He’d had the\
  \ sense to hide his sigil, but he’d shown up with his admittedly stunning black\
  \ jacquard silk pants tucked into military issue boots, and he was wearing battlegloves\
  \ with clawed metal joints. The fur on Dae’s neck stood up as they scanned the crowd\
  \ and spotted another probable vesk trooper entering the theater on the right-hand\
  \ side of the stage, blending in considerably less than the two directly front and\
  \ center. This one hadn’t even bothered changing out of their uniform.</p>\n   \
  \   <p><em>They look out of place and they look armed,</em> Dae thought. <em>They\
  \ must be after Miiyu! </em>Everybody knew about Miiyu’s rebel activities during\
  \ the Veskarium occupation of Pulonis. If imperial troopers were here, they probably\
  \ weren’t fans. There were no security guards in sight, and Dae wouldn’t risk raising\
  \ an alarm this close to curtain with everyone packed in here.</p>\n      <p>Dae\
  \ needed a plan that would protect both the star and the audience while avoiding\
  \ panic. An idea flared up immediately. With absolute confidence, they stepped out\
  \ from behind the curtain and sashayed toward the crowd. The cheers that burst forth\
  \ simmered to a buzz as it became clear that Dae wasn’t Miiyu.</p>\n      <p>“Hey,\
  \ posers!” Dae shouted, directly addressing the two vesk sitting front and center,\
  \ who looked around at the others in their row as if they hadn’t been directly pointed\
  \ at. One of the ysoki pointed at himself in utter confusion before pointing at\
  \ the vesk to his left, who shot him a withering glance before scowling up at Dae.\
  \ “First of all, there’s no replica weapons allowed at this venue, and second of\
  \ all, they don’t even match your outfits,” Dae accused. “Not to mention Imperial\
  \ vesk attire is terminally out of style.”</p>\n      <p>“We’re just here for the\
  \ show,” the latecomer replied. She wasn’t convincing at all.</p>\n      <p>“Speaking\
  \ of shows, this one’s about to start!” Dae was pleased when the spotlight landed\
  \ on them. They began tapping their foot in a steady rhythm as a ribbon of pulsing\
  \ midnight unspooled from their finger—the manifestation of their solar weapon in\
  \ graviton mode. Dae flicked the ribbon with a sound like spring thunder and snatched\
  \ the female vesk’s shoulder bag, pulling it up on stage and spilling its contents.\
  \ A jumble of wired pipes gleamed under the stage lights. As always, Dae’s instincts\
  \ were on point.</p>\n      <p>The vesk imposters immediately gave up on their ruse.\
  \ The man cracked his knuckles and scrambled onto the stage, hefting his bulk in\
  \ slow motion with a bestial grunt. The woman pulled a baton from under her jacket\
  \ and squeezed. The baton elongated into a triple-bladed polearm—a doshko with a\
  \ collapsible design created for smuggling into secure venues like this, used for\
  \ assassinations ordered by Veskarium military leaders with grudges. Miiyu was in\
  \ danger.</p>\n      <p>Sparks reflected in Dae’s goggles as they attuned with the\
  \ blazing creative energy at the heart of every star, turning the dark ribbon into\
  \ a whip of fire. Dae leapt high into the air with deceptive ease, swirling their\
  \ ribbon behind them in blazing circles. They landed on the opposite side of the\
  \ doshko-wielding vesk, smiling as they spun around and lashed the ribbon out like\
  \ a solar flare. The crowd screamed and cheered as the vesk was engulfed in flames.\
  \ She staggered stage left and fell to her knees, where black-clad crew tackled\
  \ her with fire blankets.</p>\n      <p>The male vesk dashed forward, punching wildly\
  \ with clawed fists as his wicked tailblade sliced the air. Dae gracefully dodged\
  \ the swings. Every slash, duck, and weave became part of an elaborate dance made\
  \ up on the spot.</p>\n      <p>Then Dae missed a step. Pain hit Dae like a truck\
  \ as one of the vesk’s underhanded punches slammed into their face. A second later\
  \ the vesk shoved Dae hard with both hands. The crowd booed and Dae stumbled back\
  \ awkwardly, pinwheeling their arms. A tongue of flame shot out as Dae’s nimbus\
  \ reacted to the assault, but they were already off-balance, their dance streak\
  \ was ended, and the crowd was beginning to rumble with panic.</p>\n      <p><em>Meyel,\
  \ help me pretend that didn’t happen</em>, Dae prayed. A comforting warmth spread\
  \ through them. Dae cartwheeled and called their solar flare, which appeared like\
  \ an extra spotlight hovering overhead and blasted the vesk who’d shoved them with\
  \ a ray of sunlight. He tried to flee then, but Dae streaked forward, leaving a\
  \ contrail of hypnotic light in their path and twirling the burning ribbon like\
  \ a lasso.</p>\n      <p>By now Dae was getting bored with this interruption and\
  \ was ready to take on the last target. Though it wasn’t necessary, they couldn’\
  t help but add a few flourishes to their movements—a quick flick of the left wrist\
  \ in this direction, a more dramatic swoop of the right arm that way. Their left\
  \ leg swept forward, leading the rest of their body in a graceful slide. Small motes\
  \ of light first emerged from their core and then glittered down around their body\
  \ before beginning to gather around their elegantly outstretched hands, quickly\
  \ compounding into a glimmering, dynamic brightness that drew cheers from the audience.\
  \ Seconds later, a blast of solar energy erupted from their outstretched hands,\
  \ firing a searing beam of light into the group of soldiers. Two of the three enemies\
  \ cried out in shock and pain as the light burned through their defenses. At the\
  \ same time, Dae felt the deep shifting of the stars within them as photon became\
  \ graviton, and fire extinguished into pulsing dark.</p>\n      <p>Dae landed with\
  \ grace, seamlessly going down on one knee in a dramatic bow. Becoming the opening\
  \ act was completely unintentional. They felt electrified, like they could dance\
  \ for the next week straight.</p>\n      <p>On cue, the theater went dark. Dae exited\
  \ the stage and found their position for the main show. The Veskarium saboteurs\
  \ had been dealt with without any innocent bystanders getting hurt, and the audience\
  \ was clearly entertained. The night was off to a fantastic start and was sure to\
  \ only get better.</p>\n      <p>“Nice work,” Miiyu purred as she breezed past Dae.\
  \ Dae felt as if they smiled any larger, their face would break open.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>In front of them, the curtain rose as neon pink and teal lights danced over\
  \ Miiyu. The diva strutted on stage in a shimmering holofiber gown custom made for\
  \ this song only. The crowd erupted in deafening, delirious cheers. It was going\
  \ to be a phenomenal show.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
