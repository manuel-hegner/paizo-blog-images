  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I'm the first to admit\
  \ that when I first read the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, I quirked an eyebrow at some of the environmental\
  \ protections armor offers. Coming from other RPGs, it was clear that Starfinder\
  \ had a different concept of what environmental hazards should challenge PCs. When\
  \ it came time to outline <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-108-Sanctuary-of-Drowned-Delight\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-08: Sanctuary of Drowned Delight</em></a>, I discovered\
  \ that Starfinder armor provided a plethora of opportunities for adventuring in\
  \ environments often reserved for higher-level play in other games. So, despite\
  \ being a Tier 3-6 scenario, this month's scenario is going underwater!</p> \n \
  \   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0108E-Oshessa.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0108E-Oshessa_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>With this scenario, the PCs travel to a mostly unexplored oceanic\
  \ world in the Vast. The Starfinder Society once set-up a forward outpost on the\
  \ world, only to hastily abandon it shortly after the complex came online. Now,\
  \ the planet is the only known source of a rare mineral required to repair the Society's\
  \ most storied starship, the Master of Stars. It's up to the PCs to visit the planet\
  \ and reclaim the sunken lodge. Of course, things aren't always as easy (or difficult)\
  \ as they appear, and the lodge has some new occupants...</p> \n    <p>Kate Baker\
  \ makes her debut as an author for Organized Play with Sanctuary of Drowned Delight.\
  \ Once I assigned the outline, Kate went to work at creating some truly unique creatures.\
  \ The term \"psychedelic walruses\" soon became a common term when discussing this\
  \ scenario. In fact, you can see one of these creatures (who prefer to be called\
  \ morlamaws) in this blog post's attached art preview. The morlamaws are an entirely\
  \ new species debuting in this scenarioâ€”one of the cool avenues we can explore in\
  \ Starfinder Society is the introduction of new species to the setting. I suspect\
  \ players are going to enjoy the morlamaws quite a bit, if only because alien space\
  \ walruses are pretty rad. I'm sure players will also enjoy morlamaws for other\
  \ reasons... but you'll need to play this scenario to find out!</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ scenario uses the Faction (Wayfinders) scenario tag.</p> \n    <p>While I'm still\
  \ in the flurry of outlining summer scenarios, there's a lot of upcoming content\
  \ to get excited for. Next month sees the hotly anticipated release of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-09: Live Exploration Extreme!</em></a> by Organized Play's\
  \ own, John Compton. Following that, we have the start of our two scenarios per\
  \ month rollout, with <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4l?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-110-The-HalfAlive-Streets\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Scenario #1-10: The Half-Alive Streets</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4m?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-111-In-Pursuit-of-the-Scoured-Past\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Scenario #1-11: In Pursuit of the Scoured\
  \ Past</em></a>. There's a whole lot of Starfinder Society coming up, so be sure\
  \ to keep your eyes peeled on this blog for more updates!</p> \n    <p>See you soon!</p>\
