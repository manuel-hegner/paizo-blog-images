  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">In my\
  \ Las Vegas-fueled GAMA Trade Show enthusiasm of last week, I somehow missed the\
  \ fact that the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> set\
  \ includes at least three more alien creatures from the frigid world of Triaxus,\
  \ as featured in the fifth <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign\
  \ of Winter Adventure Path</a> adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy8vss\">The Frozen\
  \ Stars</a>. Check out <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfz4\">last week’s preview\
  \ blog</a> for a sense of some of my original trepidation about including “furry\
  \ elves” in the miniatures set.</span></p> \n    <p>As it turns out, I shouldn’\
  t have worried so much. The set’s Triaxians look absolutely fantastic, and all of\
  \ them easily double as other creatures for GMs who have no intention of taking\
  \ their campaigns to the stars.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_DrakelandsBarbarian.jpg\"> <img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_DrakelandsBarbarian_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up this week is the menacing Drakelands Barbarian,\
  \ a sworn enemy of the Dragon Legion officers we previewed <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfz4\"\
  >last week</a>. I’m holding the final production run version of this figure as I\
  \ write this, and I’m blown away by the paint quality WizKids has pulled off on\
  \ this set. The Barbarian has a great feral snarl on her face, and her armor looks\
  \ fantastic. Her fur is not too furry, and the figure easily doubles as a rather\
  \ pale half-orc. From the wooden shield to the fine sculpt detail, it’s almost impossible\
  \ for me to believe that I’m looking at a common. But I most certainly am. The Drakelands\
  \ Barbarian is a fantastic-looking Medium common.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_CommanderPharamol_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of fantastic Medium figures,\
  \ here we have Commander Pharamol, the cover figure from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8vss\"\
  >The Frozen Stars</a> adventure. Pharamol commands the Dragon Legion aerie of Spurhorn,\
  \ and could end up as either an ally or an enemy of the player characters. One thing\
  \ is for sure, he’s is absolutely PERFECT for a male catfolk ranger. Again, the\
  \ paint detail on this guy is unbelievable, with amazing red outlines on his white\
  \ skirt, brilliant gold trim along his fine green cloak, and an excellently executed\
  \ face. If a near-perfect sculpt and excellent paint job is enough to convince you\
  \ to take a second look at a weird miniature, you’re going to love this guy. Commander\
  \ Pharamol is a Medium miniature slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_GeneralMalesinder_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_GeneralMalesinder_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And then we have General Malesinder, an\
  \ enormous female silver dragonkin with a sword made of ice, some cool jewelry,\
  \ and an absolute hate-on for Commander Pharamol and his Dragon Legion ilk. If you\
  \ can handle weapon-wielding dragons, this figure is just about perfect. Your players\
  \ are definitely going to freak out when this nasty lady hits the table. She’s great,\
  \ and looks even better in-hand. General Malesinder is a Large, rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Ok, now I’m pretty sure I’ve featured all of the Triaxian aliens in the\
  \ set. Except for one, that is. I’ll get to that furry fellow in a future week.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In the meantime, please consider setting up an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
  >ongoing case subscription</a> to ensure you don’t miss a single <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"\
  >Reign of Winter</a> figure. </p> \n    <p>Don’t get caught out in the cold!</p>\
