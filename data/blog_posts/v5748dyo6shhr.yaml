  \ itemprop=\"description\">In many ways, I’m relieved to see the home stretch of\
  \ 2020 and that the new year lies just beyond the horizon. With Covid, murder hornets,\
  \ wildfires, protests, elections, and beloved icons passing, this year packed more\
  \ into it than I’d expect in a decade. I felt the lack of conventions the most.\
  \ You, our community, mean the world to me and it physically hurt not to get to\
  \ meet up with you and get to chat about gaming, organized play, and maybe even\
  \ our favorite television shows (though I have a great store of talking points now!).\
  \ As vaccine availability allows us to reopen, I urge everyone to not rush back\
  \ into games spaces, but to do so responsibility in an effort to keep our communities\
  \ safe! We will be back together again soon, but only by being careful can we all\
  \ be together again.</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <h2>Scenario Release\
  \ Update</h2> \n      <p>As mentioned above, this year dealt us unforeseen challenges.\
  \ Almost as if to put convention season crunch into perspective, good ole 2020 gave\
  \ us a “hold beer” moment scenario production. We’ve done our best to not let the\
  \ difficulties of remote work impact our production schedules, but as we come to\
  \ the end of the year, we just didn’t quite meet our goals. We felt it best to share\
  \ the changes to our schedule now, so that organizers and GMs can plan accordingly,\
  \ instead of waiting for our monthly release blogs. Here’s a summary of our changes:</p>\
  \ \n      <p>December scenarios (PFS 2-09 and 2-10, Bounty 5 and SFS 3-13 and 3-14)\
  \ will be released on December 30th, the last Wednesday in the month. While we ordinarily\
  \ try to release early due to the holidays, a pile up of products in the pipeline\
  \ meant we just couldn’t meet our desired release of December 16th, and are opting\
  \ to go with the standard organized play release date instead. </p> \n      <p>Due\
  \ to an author not being able to complete their contract, we have to push one Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenario out of January release and into February. In January, we will\
  \ release <em>PFS 2-11: The Pathfinder Trials</em>, and Bounty 6 for Pathfinder\
  \ Society. Both Starfinder Society scenarios (3-15 &amp; 3-16) will release as well.\
  \ February releases include PFS 2-12, 2-13 and 2-14, as well as Bounty 7 and SFS\
  \ 3-17 and 3-18. Thank you all for your understanding and patience!</p> \n     \
  \ <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n      <p>Last month, we announced <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shhd?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box-Sanctioning\"\
  >sanctioning for the Pathfinder Beginner Box</a>. We divided the adventure in the\
  \ box, “Menace Under Otari,” into two parts and wrote a chronicle for each part.\
  \ As an incentive to reaching out to new players and building your communities,\
  \ we designated the adventure as a repeatable event which awards double AcP; players\
  \ must use the pregens in the Beginner Box or build characters using the rules within\
  \ the product.</p> \n      <p>Originally, our next agenda included <em>The Slithering</em>\
  \ for Pathfinder (second edition). To capitalize on the <em>Beginner Box</em> momentum,\
  \ we’re diverting briefly to sanction <em>Troubles in Otari</em> first. For Starfinder,\
  \ we queued up the <em>Devastation Ark</em> AP. Of course, we still have the remaining\
  \ PF1 content on radar as well. </p> \n      <p>Several people asked what about\
  \ our timelines and priorities regarding sanctioning. We tried a different process\
  \ with the <em>Beginner Box</em> that worked reasonably well, so we will use that\
  \ method on the next few projects and refine the process. We hope this will get\
  \ the adventure sanctioning out the door without placing as large a burden on the\
  \ product line developers and get us caught up so that we can achieve our goal of\
  \ day one sanctioning on all products. But until that point, we are still a bit\
  \ behind. We’ll inform you in these blogs as we have updates to share, so stay tuned!</p>\
  \ \n      <h2>Stars/Novas/Glyphs</h2> \n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs,\
  \ achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To\
  \ achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must\
  \ be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three\
  \ games for venture-captains (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the\
  \ time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n      <p>Two GMs received\
  \ their fifth star in the last month. We had no one reach 5 Novas or 5 Glyphs.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>5th Star</b>: Densial Edmonds, Daniel Harvey</p> \n      <p>Congratulations\
  \ to our new 5 Star GMs, and thank you for your dedication!</p> \n      <h2>Conventions</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>December is usually a quiet month for conventions, but 2021’s schedule\
  \ is starting to roll in. If you don’t see a convention on the list that you think\
  \ should be there, contact the event organizer and ask them to register their event\
  \ for organized play support!</p> \n      <table width=\"95%\"> \n       <thead\
