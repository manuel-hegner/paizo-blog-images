  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">First, the elephant: Let me\
  \ say that we did not expect the title of our latest Pathfinder Adventure Card Society\
  \ epic to be so prophetic. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pacg/pacs/year6\"><em>Year\
  \ of Rotting Ruin</em></a> brought gamers a sweeping torrent of plagues, economic\
  \ chaos, civil unrest, and... well, anyway. Sometimes you pick a theme and sometimes\
  \ the theme picks you.</p> \n     <p>With that said, I want to wrap up one of the\
  \ best Adventure Paths you’ll find in our eight-year Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ history. Year of Rotting Ruin was the first Pathfinder Adventure Card Society\
  \ AP to use our new <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7\"><em>Core Set</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> Adventure Path. Coordinator Linda Zayas-Palmer,\
  \ designer Keith Richmond, and storytellers Elizabeth Corrigan, Katina Davis, Jaym\
  \ Gates, Steven Hammond, Ron Lundeen, Jennifer Povey, and Diego Valdez crafted an\
  \ intricate and pulse-pounding series of tales. These are not the kind of tales\
  \ you tell your kids. These are the kind you read with one hand in front of your\
  \ face.</p> \n     <p>If you’ve finished <em>The Dragon’s Demand</em> and <em>Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</em>, and are wondering what to do next, here’s a travelogue\
  \ through your next nightmare.</p> \n     <br> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0601E.jpg\"\

  \   <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p>To start off, in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zry?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-6-1-City-of-Sails-and-Shrouds\"\
  ><em>Adventure 1: City of Sails and Shrouds</em></a>, the forces of evil blew up\
  \ a city. Straight up obliterated Vigil clean off the map. With the capital of Lastwall\
  \ destroyed by the long-dead lich called the Whispering Tyrant, the Pathfinders\
  \ faced the challenges of trying to help the citizens of the nearby city of Vellumis\
  \ deal with the strife. Ron Lundeen and Linda Zayas-Palmer came up with scenario\
  \ concepts that dealt with evacuations of refugees, uprisings of looters, and demonic\
  \ forces stoking fear and chaos. </p> \n     <p>I’ll offer spoilers on one scenario\
  \ per adventure in this blog. Scenario 1D: Treating the infection had a rude awakening\
  \ for the players: You get arrested! Keith invented a delightful (to me, not to\
  \ you) mechanic for how you deal with life behind bars. Good luck with that.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Also, there are sharks. Jigsaw Sharks. I don’t think there’s a card\
  \ in this game whose title I love more than that.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\">\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <hr> \n     <br> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0602E_500.jpeg\"\

  \   <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p>Dealing with these problems treated\
  \ the symptoms, not the cause. Vellumis was wracked with peril, but it would have\
  \ to fend for itself. To save the splintering province of Lastwall, writer Steven\
  \ Hammond sends our heroes far into darkness in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0217d?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-62-Urgathoas-Persistent-Shadow\"\
  ><em>Adventure 2: Urgathoa’s Persistent Shadow</em></a>. </p> \n     <p>Scenario\
  \ 2B: Spoiled Victuals features the return—and return, and return—of a card that’\
  s been with us from the beginning: Plague Zombie. In this scenario, you really would\
  \ prefer they stayed dead. It’s good to want things.</p> \n     <p>Also in this\
  \ scenario, we meet the supporters Ketrik, Boors, and Moise, a trio of guards whose\
  \ allegiance will become important. You decide which to rally when, and those decisions\
  \ will affect your game thereafter for quite some time.</p> \n     <br clear=\"\

  https://paizo.com/products/btq021d5?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-63-Fortress-of-Ruin\"\
  ><em>Adventure 3: Fortress of Ruin</em></a> with a deeply involving harrow reading,\
  \ and—spoiler alert—it doesn’t augur well. </p> \n     <p>Scenario 3B: Fear and\
  \ Flame begins with a sentence I’m sure you’re thrilled about: “Add the Perils wildcard\
  \ Ablaze.” It’s a scenario Keith Richmond festooned with Traps amid burning buildings.\
  \ Can you run through a maze of fire to get out? I’m sure it won’t hurt much.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Hey, I mentioned there’s a lich at the heart of this Adventure Path.\
  \ I’ll bet you think that means you’ll fight that lich in Adventure 6. Nope! You\
  \ run into a most fearsome foe halfway through the Adventure Path. If you win—no\
  \ guarantee there—what could possibly await on the other side of an undead lord?</p>\

  ><em>Adventure 4: What Stalks the Shadows</em></a>, you return to Vellumis in the\
  \ wake of the battle with the lich. Unsurprisingly, things haven’t gone perfectly\
  \ in your absence. It seems that the Whispering Tyrant had conspirators in your\
  \ city. In Diego Valdez’s story, you have to navigate a twisty road of backstabbing\
  \ and betrayal.</p> \n     <p>Like for example, when all the statues take wing and\
  \ ambush you. Scenario 4B: Rock and Steel features a host of Ashwing Gargoyles pounding\
  \ you with rocks, and also the first (but not last) appearance of a sentence that\
  \ will tempt you in ways you won’t comprehend at first: “Once each turn, you may\
  \ bury a card to explore.” Let’s see if you are willing to strip down that deck\
  \ to make progress. Sounds good, right? Did I mention the Ashwing Gargoyles?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Time for Adventure 5! Wait, is that a record scratch I hear?</p> \n\

  \   <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p>Surprise! We dropped a totally\
  \ unexpected standalone adventure in between AP chapters. In <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Standalone-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor\"\
  ><em>Standalone Adventure 1: A Night at Bloodthorn Manor</em></a>, a group of children\
  \ wander into a haunted house, and you have to get them out. The story text by Jaym\
  \ Gates is fun and creepy and really weird, and I love all of it.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ mean, how confident are you when you read a note that says:</p> \n     <center>\n\
  \      <b>“We are safe. Daddy will take care of the bad people.”</b>\n     </center>\
  \ \n     <p>Some confident? None confident?</p> \n     <p>I also love how Keith\
  \ sets a trap for you in <em>Scenario D: Unfinished Business</em>. You get to choose\
  \ your wildcards, one per character for this one. A six-player group starting with\
  \ six wildcards had better make some careful choices.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"\

  \   <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p>Taking us back to the AP, Katina\
  \ Davis sets the stage for the return to Lastwall and a journey to the city of Ardis\
  \ in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c5?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-65-Echoes-of-Death\"\
  ><em>Adventure 5: Echoes of Death</em></a>. The city faces an uprising of previously\
  \ dead monsters as well as an assassination attempt on its noble countess. Plus,\
  \ there’s a giant golem in your way. That’s a lot to handle.p&gt; </p>\n     <p>In\
  \ Scenario 5B: Race for the Cemetery, Keith asks the heretofore unasked question,\
  \ “What if every location was a Graveyard?” In case you’ve blotted it out of your\
  \ memory, Graveyard is the Core Set location where every monster is Undead, and\
  \ closing it spawns more Undead. So if every location is a Graveyard... well, you\
  \ do the math.</p> \n     <p>And look, if there’s Undead everywhere, and this whole\
  \ Adventure Path centers around a long-slain lich, you probably want to re-slay\
  \ the Whispering Tyrant here. Otherwise, you’ll never make it to the end of this\
  \ epic quest.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <br> \n     <hr> \n     <br>\

  \ Extinction Curse Adventure Path: The Apocalypse Prophet book cover\"></a>\n  \
  \   <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p>All right, you’ve finally ended\
  \ the threat of the Whispering Tyrant. Except... you haven’t. You still have to\
  \ find his phylactery, which is the only way you can guarantee you won’t have to\
  \ re-re-slay him. And that’s going to lead you to <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0232x?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-66-Deaths-Vengeance\"\
  ><em>Adventure 6: Death’s Vengeance</em></a>.</p> \n     <p>Lich-fighting makes\
  \ strange bedfellows, so in the middle of this adventure, Elizabeth Corrigan and\
  \ Keith Richmond give you one of the nastiest choices this game has ever seen: either\
  \ ally with the Red Mantis assassins who promise they’re going to kill you later,\
  \ or refuse their help and expect them to try to kill you now. Whether you choose\
  \ to play <em>Scenario 6C1: An Unlikely Alliance</em> or <em>Scenario 6C2: Backstabbed</em>,\
  \ you’ll come out of it in quite a different shape for your final boss fight. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>It all ends in an arena of blood, but I won’t say any more about that.\
  \ Well, except that once you’ve finished the six-course meal that is the Adventure\
  \ Path proper, we tempt you with a wafer-thin mint of a bonus scenario that puts\
  \ the lever controlling risk versus reward directly into your own hands. After all\
  \ this, are you going to take the easy way out? (We didn’t think so.)</p> \n   \
  \  <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p>Year of Rotting Ruin is a big, soaring, down-in-the-muck\
  \ Adventure Path. If you’re done with The Dragon’s Demand and Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne, you owe it to yourself to pick it up. Maybe, just maybe, you’ll make it\
  \ through alive.</p> \n     <p>Adventures Ahead!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
