  \ itemprop=\"description\">When the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> is released in August, some of the things\
  \ players are sure to look at first are the classes—envoy, mechanic, mystic, operative,\
  \ solarian, soldier, and technomancer. Along with the core races and character themes,\
  \ these classes are a major part of defining a Starfinder player character.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"BodyCopyIndent\">Of course, we don't want to make people wait\
  \ until August to learn anything about all the fun things we have crammed into our\
  \ new game, so we're going to be doing a series of class previews over the coming\
  \ weeks, starting with the envoy. So, let's take a quick look at what the book has\
  \ to say about the envoy.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>“<em>You make your\
  \ way in the universe with a charming smile, quick wit, and keen sense of self-preservation,\
  \ and excel at getting others to do what you want. You might be a trickster, hustler,\
  \ or con artist, or you might serve as an actor, ambassador, or businessperson,\
  \ paving the way for negotiation through kind words or the occasional dirty trick.\
  \ You are often the group's strategist, using your quick wit and tactical acumen\
  \ to push your friends to greater heights. You may also be skilled in diplomacy,\
  \ serving as the face for a starship crew, talking your way into restricted systems\
  \ or gaining audiences with local politicians or warlords.</em>”</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>As that description suggests, envoys are good at social skills. Whether\
  \ they're using those skills to make friends, fool victims, or threaten foes, envoys\
  \ often use their wits and charm to get the job done. (And when that doesn't work,\
  \ well, there's always your laser pistol.) Some of that ability to affect others\
  \ is modeled by their 8 skill points per level and 16 class skills, which allow\
  \ them to pick up a lot of social skills while still being able to put ranks into\
  \ skills such as Acrobatics, Computers, and Stealth, as appropriate for your character\
  \ concept. The class couples that with an average base attack bonus, poor Fortitude\
  \ saves, good Reflex and Will saves, light armor, and proficiency (and eventually\
  \ specialization) with basic melee weapons, grenades, and small arms.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Envoys gain the expertise and skill expertise class features at 1st level.\
  \ Expertise grants the envoy a 1d6 expertise die that she can add to Sense Motive\
  \ skill checks as an insight bonus, and skill expertise extends that bonus to one\
  \ other skill. As the envoy gains levels, she expands the number of skills she can\
  \ apply her expertise die to and gains expertise talents, which give her additional\
  \ options for those skills. These can extend the effects of a skill check, allow\
  \ her to perform acts the skill doesn't normally grant, or alter how long it takes\
  \ her to use a talent.</p> \n     <p>Each envoy also gets to select a number of\
  \ envoy improvisations over the course of her career, beginning at 1st level. These\
  \ allow the envoy to more directly hinder her foes and aid her allies. Many improvisations\
  \ are sense-dependent, and some are also language-dependent or mind-affecting. Clever\
  \ use of envoy improvisations can turn the tide of battle, as the envoy can bolster\
  \ allies actions and defenses, warn them of impending dangers, and—with higher-level\
  \ options—even give them additional actions in a turn. Here's an example of a 1st-level\
  \ envoy improvisation.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <h3>Clever Feint (EX) [sense-dependent]</h3>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"StatBlock1\">As a standard action, you can fake out an enemy\
  \ within 60 feet, making that enemy open to your attacks. Attempt a Bluff check\
  \ with the same DC as a check to feint against that enemy (though this isn';t a\
  \ standard check to feint, so Improved Feint and Greater Feint don't apply). Even\
  \ if you fail, that enemy is flat-footed against your attacks until the end of your\
  \ next turn. If you succeed, the enemy is also flat-footed against your allies'\
  \ attacks until the end of your next turn. You can't use clever feint against a\
  \ creature that lacks an Intelligence score.</p> \n      <p class=\"StatBlock1\"\
  >At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to treat a failed Bluff check for clever\
  \ feint as if it were a success.</p> \n     </blockquote> We'll present more information\
  \ on the other six classes in the coming weeks, and of course, you can read the\
  \ full classes this August when the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
