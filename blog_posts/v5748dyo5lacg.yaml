  date\">Tuesday, June 9, 2009</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/paizocon\">PAIZOCON</a> approaches!\
  \ In less than a week's time, Paizonians from throughout the country and around\
  \ the world will arrive in Bellevue to take part in the furious and fun convention\
  \ here at the Coast Bellevue Hotel. As a little teaser for what to expect, I spoke\
  \ to Events Manager Joshua J. Frost and Pathfinder Lead Designer Jason Bulmahn about\
  \ some of the most exciting events attendees can anticipate.</p> \n   <p>On Saturday,\
  \ PAIZOCON attendees will enjoy an enormous banquet, as the Paizo staff and attendees\
  \ mingle with one another, swap stories, and chow down on delicious food. Highlights\
  \ of the banquet include a preview of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy8255\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG</a> and a Q&amp;A with Jason Bulmahn, a five-round quiz game with\
  \ special prizes, a keynote address by CEO Lisa Stevens, and a preview of unannounced\
  \ products by Publisher Erik Mona.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn's Fight Club will also\
  \ be a particularly fun highlight of PAIZOCON. Only one word most accurately depicts\
  \ the Fight Club: Meatgrinder. To put it simply, players are seated around four\
  \ tables and given a stack of 3rd-level characters to chew through. Jason runs around\
  \ each table activating monsters; it's up to the players to accomplish the task\
  \ of slaying impossibly tough creatures (or each other!) with their measly characters.\
  \ Expect death and mayhem. Points are distributed according to damage dealt to monsters\
  \ and who delivered the killing blow, and subtracted when a character dies. Prizes\
  \ will be awarded for—among other things—the most points, the most damage dealt,\
  \ the most deaths, and the quickest death.</p> \n   <p>The Pathfinder Society also\
  \ boasts a number of special events for PAIZOCON. To begin with, attendees will\
  \ be able to run through all four June scenarios, as well as a mid-level and high-level\
  \ scenario, using pregens or their existing Pathfinder Society characters. On Friday,\
  \ Pathfinder Society will host an Interactive, in which attendees can battle against\
  \ one another using their Society characters in a Grand Melee and participate in\
  \ a joust. These are just a sampling; other activities will be included in the Interactive\
  \ as well!</p> \n   <p>It should be noted, however, that characters must bring their\
  \ own Society characters to participate in the Interactive—to create a Pathfinder\
  \ Society character, just head to the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society homepage</a> and download the Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I hope you're all as excited and impatient as I am for the craziness to\
  \ ensue this weekend!</p> \n   <p>David Eitelbach <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n  \
