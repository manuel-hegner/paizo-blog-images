  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Since we first revealed the\
  \ map of the Age of Lost Omens campaign setting, with its ten meta-regions and updated\
  \ names for existing locations, fans have been asking for more information about\
  \ the Mwangi Expanse. Well today I'm happy to be able to grant that wish, with a\
  \ brief overview of how the setting's iconic jungle has evolved between editions!\

  \ 13px;\">Illustration by Roman Roland Kuteynikov</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>One\
  \ of the key differences between the Mwangi Expanse and other regions of the Age\
  \ of Lost Omens campaign setting is that it (mostly) lacks nation-states with capitals\
  \ and well-established borders, instead offering a number of city-states spread\
  \ throughout a vast wilderness of adventure-filled jungles, savannahs, swamps, and\
  \ mountains. Whether it's Nantambu, with its ancient magic academy, the Magaambya;\
  \ Mzali, ruled by the mummified child-god Walkena; or the mercantile pirate port\
  \ of Bloodcove; each of these political entities is presented with the same level\
  \ of detail as the nations on the Inner Sea. We took special care to ensure that\
  \ each one is described from the perspective of a native rather than from the eyes\
  \ of outlanders coming into the region to explore and research the “lost” civilizations\
  \ within, and longtime fans of the Mwangi Expanse should appreciate the new point\
  \ of view for the variety of stories it can inspire in players and GMs alike.</p>\

  \ palace on the left. \"></a> \n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration\

  \ lie the Sodden Lands—a collective name for the flooded nations of Lirgen and Yamassa,\
  \ which were destroyed with the Eye of Abendego formed off their shores. No centralized\
  \ government rules these waterlogged lands, and what antediluvian settlements survive\
  \ are now mostly ruined spectres of their former glory, overtaken by cannibals,\
  \ cultists, and monsters. Many Lirgeni refugees and lizardfolk resettled in the\
  \ Mwangi city of Jaha, and unlike the city's vanished former inhabitants, open the\
  \ city to visitors who hope to learn from the famed astrologers and work with them\
  \ to find a way to end the raging hurricane and reclaim their homeland.</p> \n \

  \      </div> \n      <p>South of the Sodden Lands, the former nation of Sargava\
  \ has undergone incredible change in the last few years. A revolution mounted by\
  \ the nation's native population overthrew the Chelish colonial government that\
  \ had ruled for centuries, establishing the new land of Vidrian in Sargava's place.\
  \ As with all new nations, Vidrian has a long road to stability ahead of it, but\
  \ its people are hopeful that self-rule will bring about an era of prosperity and\
  \ innovation. Under the leadership of heroes of the revolution, the ruling council\
  \ of Anthusis (what used to be Eleder) hopes to establish new trade and military\
  \ alliances with nations both abroad and in the Expanse, and prevent colonization\
  \ efforts like that of Sargava from occurring again elsewhere in the Mwangi.</p>\

  \ of the Mwangi Expanse, however, and rich societies of elves and orcs are also\
  \ present. The elves of the Mualijae nations—the Ekujae, Kallijae, and Alijae—occupy\
  \ most of the Expanse to one degree or another, and though no longer part of a unified\
  \ nation as they once were, the elves nevertheless exert incredible influence over\
  \ the entire region. The orcs of Lake Ocata, for their part, have a much more localized\
  \ reach, but their influence is no less important. In the wake of the Gorilla King's\
  \ death and the fall of Usaro, it has been these jungle orc tribes who have led\
  \ the efforts to re-stabilize the region and retake their homeland from the demon-tainted\
  \ forces that once ruled.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190709-mwangielves.jpg\"\
