  \ \n   <p>I'm never too sure what to write when these blog entries sporadically\
  \ fall to me. While I am only here three days a week (as opposed to the eight or\
  \ so put in by the management) and not exactly <i>the</i> authority on \"what's\
  \ new at Paizo,\" I can tell you \"what's new with Patrick in relation to Paizo\
  \ and its products.\"</p> \n   <p>I've been formatting lots of things, mostly Word\
  \ documents for the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b6g\"><i>Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide</i></a>. This entails going through material sent in by authors, selecting\
  \ chunks of text, then applying a style to said chunk. Lather, rinse, repeat. While\
  \ the process may sound mind-numbing, I actually find this activity somewhat calming,\
  \ peaceful—Zen-like, as it were. It's a nice break from the epic Russian literature\
  \ I'm reading in one of my English classes, which takes my brain, shatters it into\
  \ fine granules, and demands that I pick up the mess it's made.</p> \n   <p>Anyway.\
  \ Said brutal English classes have unfortunately taken me away from my beloved Pathfinder\
  \ campaign, in which the PCs are about to wrap up a huge plot arc, protecting the\
  \ city from a demon-witch and the hordes of ungodly creatures she's summoned from\
  \ the Abyss. I may also actually get to play in a game some time soon, which will\
  \ be the first time in almost a year. Yippee!</p> \n   <p>At any rate, all the things\
  \ in development here are looking super-awesome, as usual, so if you aren't looking\
  \ forward to any particular Paizo product's release—well, you should be.</p> \n\
