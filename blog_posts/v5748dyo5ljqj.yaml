  description\">As we ramp up convention season, not that it feels like it ever truly\
  \ slowed down, I'm processing many event support requests. Each month, a handful\
  \ of conventions note that they are supporting a charity or raising money to donate\
  \ to a group. In 2015, we ran a spotlight blog on the Minnaepolis-St. Paul extraordinary\
  \ fundraising efforts during SkalCon. The blog included photos of Venture-Captain\
  \ (retired) Jon Dehning and Andrew Christian undergoing the clippers as an incentive\
  \ for donations. If you missed it, you can see the blog <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li46?Return-to-SkalCon\"\
  >here</a>. Today felt like a great day to highlight some of our other charity events.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Last November, several groups hosted <a href=\"https://www.extra-life.org\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Extra Life</a> events and donated funds to their local chapters.\
  \ I attended the Extra Life II event in Spokane, Washington. There were also Extra\
  \ Life events in Boise, Idaho and Cary, North Carolina. John Compton joined fellow\
  \ Paizonians Jason Buhlman and Amanda Hamon-Kunz, as well as several members of\
  \ the Dead Gentlemen/Zombie Orpheus Entertainment cadre in a marathon gaming event\
  \ streamed on twitch. All told, we raised over $5,000 for the Extra Life Cause.\
  \ Get ready for November 2017, because we will be back, this time coordinating our\
  \ efforts on a larger scale as well as streaming another celebrity-studded game.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Players in the metro Boston area regularly support charitable causes.\
  \ Venture Captains Ray Diaz and David Montgomery coordinate ongoing charity events\
  \ through their weekly games. In March, they supported National Reading Month. Prior\
  \ events benefited Somerville Homeless Coalition and the Woman's Bar Foundation.\
  \ They also support charity conventions such as CaptainCon.</p> \n    <p>Supporting\
  \ charity isn't limited to the US groups. In Great Britain, Wyrd Sisters Carol Tierney\
  \ and Chris Brockley-Blatt run several conventions aimed at raising money for a\
  \ variety of organizations. They support <a href=\"http://www.tofs.org.uk/home.aspx\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">TOFS</a>, <a href=\"https://sarcoma.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Sarcoma UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mssociety.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">MS Society\
  \ UK</a> and other charities on an ongoing basis. They are responsible for 3XP Fall\
  \ and 3XP Spring, as well as lending their talents to a slew of other events: ConTRAPtion,\
  \ OddCon UK, Contingency, and PaizoCon UK. Other charitable events in Europe include\
  \ GaelCon in Ireland, and CoNfUsIoN in Gouda.</p> \n    <p>The list below recognizes\
  \ the charity events supported so far in 2017. These are not the only charity events\
  \ occurring in 2017, and do not include events which occurred in 2016. A huge thank\
  \ you to players, GMs, and volunteers who supported charity events in the past and\
  \ those which plan to do so in the future!</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>ShadowCon XXI—\

  Martinsburg, WV</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>To support these efforts, the Pathfinder\
  \ Society team initiated the Charity Boon program in 2016. The program consists\
  \ of two unique boons that may be used to raise funds for a charity, usually through\
  \ auctions or raffles. In 2016, the boons were \"Memory of Eshiro\" and \"Thaneguard\
  \ Mantle\" andwe distributed 32 charity boons worldwide. For 2017, the boons are\
  \ \"Bristlecoat\" and \"Mana Treads\" and are currently projecting 40ish being distributed\
  \ throughout the year.</p> \n    <p>An event organizer may request a charity boon\
  \ for their event as part of their request for convention support. A charity qualifies\
  \ as long as it is non-religious and/or non-political and benefits a public group\
  \ of people. With the advent of the Regional Support Program (RSP), we are accepting\
  \ requests for charity boons as part of a RSP event. If you have an upcoming event\
  \ you feel would benefit from charity support, contact your local Venture-Officer\
  \ for more information. You can find a list of Venture-Officers <a href=\"/organizedplay/coordinators\"\
  >here.</a></p> \n    <p>Next week, we get a double blog Monday. In one, John will\
  \ introduce our April scenarios. In another, I'll reveal the results of the \"OPC\
  \ Needs a New Character\" competition. If you haven't voted, follow <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljqf?Fantasy-All-Around-You-OPC-Character-Contest\"\
  >this link</a> and vote for your favorite.</p> \n    <p>Until next week—Explore,\
  \ Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
