  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">\"And then\
  \ he walked face-first into a swarm of mosquitos, just like that!” Lini chuckled.\
  \ “I remember the first time I did that, so many years ago! It nearly scared the\
  \ life out of me. He’s fine, though; just rattled from the experience.”</p> \n \
  \     <p>The orange-haired dwarf grunted acknowledgement, pausing in his forward\
  \ motion long enough to ask, “This was while I was scouting?”</p> \n      <p><br>“\
  Right,” the lively gnome confirmed. “That’s why Valeros and Ezren stayed back at\
  \ camp. Val wanted to sleep off the mosquitos…”</p> \n      <p>“…and Ezren wanted\
  \ to avoid getting his shoes wet again,” her friend grumbled.</p> \n      <p>“You’\
  re not wrong.” Lini grinned, hopping over an old, grounded vine. “But I can’t really\
  \ blame him for wanting to stay behind, Harsk. He’s been seeing enemies everywhere.\
  \ Every plant’s a flesh-eater and each low-hanging vine’s a snake to the poor guy.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“He’s not like us,” Harsk summarized.</p> \n      <p><em>Straight\
  \ to the point as usual,</em> the little druid mused,<em> but no less correct for\
  \ it.</em> The three of them—her beloved companion Droogami, the ranger Harsk, and\
  \ she—had already fallen into a comfortable pattern. Each of them knew the best\
  \ places to set one’s feet to keep their steps as unobtrusive as possible, and they\
  \ had a general knowledge of what to watch out for in this environment. Each was\
  \ more comfortable here, in the middle of the thick-grown jungle, than in the chaos\
  \ of “civilized” settlements. Likewise, they each trusted the other to be competent\
  \ in their own skills.</p> \n      <p>“Right. And it’s never good to be alone, so\
  \ I didn’t really mind them hanging back at camp while we went ahead,” Lini finished.\
  \ She saw the momentary flicker of a grin cross Harsk’s face and knew he’d been\
  \ thinking much the same thing about their traveling companions.</p> \n      <p>Exploring\
  \ the jungle <em>had</em> been a lot easier since letting Ezren and Valeros stay\
  \ back, she had to admit.</p> \n      <p>A short, sharp hiss of sound from the dwarf\
  \ interrupted the conversation. Lini crouched instinctively and then rolled her\
  \ eyes at herself; she was the one holding the torch. Most obvious target, anyone?</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Fortunately, the ranger’s quick warning was not immediately followed\
  \ by an attack. It was just a signal for her to be cautious. Moving forward quietly,\
  \ keeping low, the green-haired druid soon discovered what Harsk had seen: through\
  \ the darkness ahead, a stone monolith reached up through the shadows, impeding\
  \ their chosen path.</p> \n      <p>Lini’s curiosity tingled through her, the thrill\
  \ of discovery barely held at bay until she received an all-clear signal from Harsk\
  \ and saw Droogami return from circling in the opposite direction. She practically\
  \ bounced as she approached, hopping atop a nearby root, a thick but sturdy remnant\
  \ from a long-fallen tree. At this greater height, she raised her small hand and\
  \ gently cleared away a curtain of overgrown moss, then rested it along the edge\
  \ of the strange, sculpted rock.</p> \n      <p>“Another one in the distance,” Harsk\
  \ said, pointing out a similar shape at the edge of their vision. “Wonder how far\
  \ these go.”</p> \n      <p>“Droo, look at this,” she breathed, running her fingers\
  \ along the rock. “How old do you think this thing is?”</p> \n      <p>As ever,\
  \ the snow leopard refused to lend her appraisal to the situation. Lini chuckled.\
  \ “I bet Ezren’s kicking himself now. He’d have wanted to see this.” <em>Though,</em>\
  \ she had to admit to herself, <em>he’d have certainly seen that vine over there\
  \ as another snake, that plush leaf as a squirmy caterpillar, that hanging bit of\
  \ moss as a bat…</em></p> \n      <p>“We’ll bring them tomorrow. More light then,”\
  \ Harsk said.</p> \n      <p>Nodding, Lini’s hand brushed over a dip in the stone’\
  s surface. Following a hunch, the gnome cleared away more of the moss. “Hang on\
  \ a tic...! Hey, Harsk, there’s some sculpted <em>stuff</em> on the monolith! Kinda\
  \ looks all swirly and serpentine. Come and look!”</p> \n      <p>“One moment,”\
  \ answered the ranger. His own exploration had turned up something odd: dark, splotchy\
  \ stains on an otherwise-green leaf. <em>Blood...?</em> He looked up, trying to\
  \ locate the source of any drip, but found nothing of interest above. His stomach\
  \ tensed, as it often did when he realized there was likely danger nearby.</p> \n\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <p>Meanwhile, Lini’s eyes shifted, focusing\
  \ just beyond the edges of the monolith, past the normal spectrum of light, into\
  \ the space that allowed her to detect the presence of magic. What she found drew\
  \ a thoughtful sound from her. “Huh. There’s a faint magical aura on it, too...”\
  </p> \n      <p>Harsk’s warning whistle came just in time. Lini dropped down and\
  \ saw the emerald green blur of a reptilian tail jam into the stone right where\
  \ her head had been. Instinctually, she pulled magic around her, drawing from the\
  \ earth and tightening her skin to mimic the stony strength of the monolith. If\
  \ not for Harsk’s well-timed warning, she’d have been mincemeat! The creature righted\
  \ itself along the side of the stone and reared up over the top, its bright, leathery\
  \ wings catching the torchlight.</p> \n      <p>“Drake!” the ranger called. As if\
  \ in answer, a second serpentine hunter launched itself from the trees, angling\
  \ towards him. That was a mistake; lightning quick, Harsk brought his axes to hand\
  \ and left a long wound along the creature’s side as it flew by, hearing a satisfying\
  \ shriek in reaction.</p> \n      <p>Meanwhile, Droogami launched herself towards\
  \ the perched dragon threatening Lini, deftly avoiding the swing of the creature’\
  s stinger and swiping at it with her mighty claws.</p> \n      <p>Despite the danger\
  \ she was in, Lini had to admit that jungle drakes were simply gorgeous creatures.\
  \ Sure, they were larger than she was by a notable amount, and sure, their stingers\
  \ hurt like nobody’s business and had enough goopy venom in them to sicken even\
  \ the hardiest body. But they were just trying to eat, after all, and a dwarf, a\
  \ gnome, and a big cat sure seemed like an easy meal. Lini could totally understand\
  \ how tempting a target she must make. Still, how majestic they looked when they—\
  <em>Oops, it’s diving again!</em></p> \n      <p>Rolling clear of claws and dodging\
  \ the drake’s stinger, Lini gathered her magic and aimed it at Droogami. Focusing\
  \ nature’s might, she used herself as a conduit, feeding power into the great snow\
  \ leopard. The little druid felt her bond with the cat strengthen, their shared\
  \ energy invigorating her friend. “Droo!” she called. “Like we practiced!”</p> \n\
  \      <p>Her stalwart companion and protector stood between Lini and the hungry\
  \ drake. Fixing the creature with its most menacing gaze, Droogami let loose a long,\
  \ primal growl, a burst of sound that shredded the air before her. <em>You are not\
  \ hunter, </em>the magically enhanced noise insisted as it tore into the drake.\
  \ <em>You are prey.</em></p> \n      <p>Even Harsk had to glance over his shoulder\
  \ at the great cat; he’d never heard Droo do that before. He was glad he wasn’t\
  \ the target of her aimed, pain-inducing yowl.</p> \n      <p>The drake, however,\
  \ wasn’t so fortunate: it reeled, knocked off balance and startled by the painful\
  \ sound. Its eyes widened with fear, and for a moment, it seemed to reconsider its\
  \ options. Jungle drakes typically didn’t prefer to stay and face down their prey,\
  \ instead opting to fly by, letting their venom do the work for them. This one’\
  s meal had just become more trouble than it was worth.</p> \n      <p>Noting the\
  \ creature’s hesitation, Lini pressed the attack, pulling her sling and sending\
  \ sharpened, stinging rocks hurtling towards it. “Harsk, watch for the stingers\
  \ and the spit,” she called.</p> \n      <p>“D’ya think?” countered Harsk, diving\
  \ out of the way of a flailing stinger. He rolled closer to the great creature,\
  \ angling his axes with the movement, and was rewarded with a horrible screech—\
  and a spray of hot blood as he severed the drake’s stinger from its tail. Using\
  \ his momentum, he leapt from the ground, slicing his weapons upward and catching\
  \ the creature’s wing. It was all but done for, and the ranger wasted no time finishing\
  \ the job.</p> \n      <p>That left the one facing Lini and Droogami. By now, the\
  \ gnome had moved into a flanking position, sending stinging stones at its back\
  \ while Droo slashed and clawed at the creature’s front. It was going to lose.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>This was too much for the creature. In perhaps the smartest choice\
  \ of its entire life, the drake decided that the small, helpless meal was neither\
  \ as small nor as helpless as originally thought. It displayed its wings broadly\
  \ to buy itself some space and, hissing, leapt into the canopy above, beating a\
  \ hasty retreat.</p> \n      <p>The victory didn’t make the druid or her friends\
  \ feel much better. Taking only a moment to catch his breath, Harsk asked tersely,\
  \ “You hurt?”</p> \n      <p>“No,” breathed Lini, turning her attention to Droogami.\
  \ A few moments reassured her that her friend was in healthy condition. “We’re both\
  \ good. You?”</p> \n      <p>Harsk nodded, voicing the thought in the same moment\
  \ Lini had it: “Strange that it chose to retreat so suddenly. I don’t like it.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“I mean, we were more than it bargained for,” Lini said. “But I\
  \ don’t like it either. They love to fly-by and poison, but it’s very rare for those\
  \ things to only fly in twos.”</p> \n      <p>“Then there might be more,” Harsk\
  \ said. “It might be getting friends. Let’s get back to camp.”</p> \n      <p>“\
  And quickly,” agreed Lini. “Ez and Val may be in danger!”</p> \n      <p>Wasting\
  \ no more time, Harsk bounded away. Lini hopped onto Droogami’s back and the giant\
  \ cat was quick to follow. Tomorrow, they could return, clean the carcass, and continue\
  \ exploring the ruins. Tonight, Ezren and Valeros might need help, and neither Lini\
  \ nor Harsk intended to let their teammates down.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n  \
