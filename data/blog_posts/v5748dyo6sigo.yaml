  \ mission that lost 80% of the organization’s personnel and resources. The players\
  \ take on the role of new agents working to uncover the mystery behind the disaster\
  \ and eventually mount a rescue mission for the trapped survivors. In the end, it’\
  s up to the player characters (PCs), now the Society’s most experienced agents,\
  \ to defeat a threat accidentally unleashed by the Society and prevent their newfound\
  \ foes from gaining the power of a slumbering god. All in a day’s work for your\

  \ SEEKER JADNURA </em></strong></h3>\n      <p><em>Jadnura began his Starfinder\
  \ agent career as a solitary explorer. A kasatha who wanted to share his knowledge\
  \ with the wider galaxy, Jadnura always went about his missions on his own and rarely\
  \ interacted with fellow Society members. As his expeditions became more and more\
  \ dangerous, Jadnura eventually came to rely on his fellow Starfinders and developed\
  \ a genuine love of the organization that allowed him to explore his passion for\
  \ archaeology and exploration. </em></p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  \ Giorgi</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p><em>Over a career spanning nearly\
  \ two decades, Jadnura excelled at two things: his solarian training, and his ability\
  \ to fill the Starfinder Chronicles broadcasts. Anyone reading the Chronicles over\
  \ the last decade had likely seen Jadnura’s name countless times as the leader of\
  \ an expedition or a wise voice adding opinion or additional fact to a specific\
  \ chronicle. Throughout the Society, Jadnura was a respected leader and was often\
  \ nominated for a position in the Forum. </em></p>\n      <p><em>Everything changed\
  \ when Jadnura undertook his mission to the moon of Kukanou-2b. On that mission,\
  \ Jadnura uncovered the mentrasi Tear, though he didn’t yet realize the full implications\
  \ of the relic’s discovery. Returning to the Lorespire with the Tear, Jadnura dedicated\
  \ himself to uncovering its mysteries. Though he barely scratched the surface of\
  \ its true powers, Jadnura discovered a strong connection to the mysterious region\
  \ of space known as the Scoured Stars. Dreams and waking visions drew Jadnura’s\
  \ attention to the region, and as the current First Seeker stepped down, Jadnura\
  \ took his first grasp at leadership by nominating himself as a successor. </em></p>\n\
  \      <p><em>The Society’s membership overwhelmingly supported Jadnura, and many\
  \ saw the quest to the previously forbidden Scoured Stars as the start of a new\
  \ chapter in the Society’s history. They weren’t wrong. </em></p>\n      <h3><strong><em>THE\
  \ MISSION </em></strong></h3>\n      <p><em>Jadnura assembled an overwhelming force\
  \ to travel to the Scoured Stars. Every major starship and group of agents was prepared\
  \ to descend on the abandoned worlds of the trinary star system to catalogue data\
  \ and uncover the truth of the mysterious Tear relic. Jadnura himself took charge\
  \ of the mission, leaving behind only what assets were already committed to other\
  \ missions, or those too unsuited to travel (such as the Wayfinders’ flagship, the\
  \ Master of Stars). </em></p>\n      <p>Upon entering the Scoured Stars, Jadnura\
  \ began to coordinate missions across the three systems. However, in the expedition’\
  s opening hours, the Tear relic started to act in a strange manner. Soon all sorts\
  \ of horrors, from fiends to robotic defenders to enraged fauna, began to assail\
  \ the Society’s expedition. Before Jadnura could call for a general retreat into\
  \ the Drift, all communication stopped. Later expeditions would find the Scoured\
  \ Stars inaccessible, the system entirely covered in a shield of aurum energy that\
  \ prevented any means of entry. The Society lost most of its agents and resources\
  \ in a handful of hours</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \      <p><em>The chaos that followed the Scoured Stars incident almost tore the\
  \ surviving Society membership apart. The few members of the Forum who hadn’t taken\
  \ part in the mission openly debated how to handle the situation. Debates turned\
  \ to bickering and then into outright hostility as members of the Society proclaimed\
  \ their vision for the future as the only right way forward. Much time was spent\
  \ on infighting or trying in vain to breach the Scoured Stars, instead of stabilizing\
  \ the </em><em>fractured Society.<br><br></em></p>\n      <p><em>With creditors\
  \ and outside forces poised to take the venerable institution of the Starfinder\
  \ Society down for good, one agent stepped forward. Luwazi Elsebo was an experienced\
  \ Starfinder who had been on a long-range mission near the Azlanti Star Empire’\
  s space at the time of the Scoured Stars incident. She ended her mission early and\
  \ returned to the Lorespire Complex when the news reached her. When she saw the\
  \ squabbling members who fought for power, she stepped away and focused on keeping\
  \ the Society intact.</em></p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\
