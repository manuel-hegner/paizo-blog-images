  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Paizo and Geek &amp; Sundry\
  \ will produce a second season of the successful <i>Knights of Everflame</i> for\
  \ Pathfinder Second Edition later this year! Once again, Game Master Jason Bulmahn\
  \ will lead an amazing cast of adventurers into the heart of darkness on <a href=\"\
  https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry\">Geek &amp; Sundry on Twitch</a> (<a href=\"\
  https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry\">twitch.tv/geekandsundry</a>). The Season 1\
  \ finale airs on Tuesday, Sept. 17 at 4 p.m. Pacific, and you can catch up on past\
  \ episodes on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/geekandsundry\">Geek &amp; Sundry\
  \ YouTube channel</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/geekandsundry\">youtube.com/geekandsundry</a>).</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The show began with five strangers boarding a caravan heading to Lastwall,\
  \ an ancient kingdom watching over the grave of a long-dead menace. Signed up as\
  \ conscripts in the army, they faced years of training and service. But when smoke\
  \ began to rise from the horizon, they had to come together as friends to have any\
  \ chance at survival!</p> \n     <p>“I could not be more excited to bring another\
  \ season of <i>Knights of Everflame</i> to all of you! With the epic conclusion\
  \ of Season 1, there were a number of stories left unresolved. The trail of one\
  \ foe stands before them, but it is a journey that leads into the deepest darkness,\
  \ and none of them will emerge unscathed,” said Jason Bulmahn.</p> \n     <p>“While\
  \ filming Season 1 of <i>Knights of Everflame</i>, I knew magic was happening almost\
  \ immediately. Something special was occurring at the table, and I was just fortunate\
  \ enough to be the guy tasked with capturing it. Jason Bulmahn is one of the greatest\
  \ storytellers I’ve ever had the fortune of working with. The cast at the table\
  \ are some of the most brilliant live performers I’ve ever known, and I am overjoyed\
  \ to call all of them my friends. I am so excited to embark on the journey that\
  \ is Season 2 with every single one of them,” said director and producer Chris Fishel.</p>\

  \ Steven Walker</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>The #KnightsOfEverflame are:</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b> (@JasonBulmahn) got his start in gaming administering\
  \ the Living Greyhawk campaign, but soon after was hired as the Managing Editor\
  \ of Dragon magazine. After the end of the magazine’s print run, Jason became the\
  \ Lead Designer of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Now, as Paizo’s Director of\
  \ Game Design, he leads the team behind Pathfinder Second Edition. He is also an\
  \ experienced Game Master, writing and running the Oblivion Oath, a Pathfinder Actual\
  \ Play stream on Twitch, and the Knights of Everflame, a new series for Geek and\
  \ Sundry.</p> \n     <p><b>Gina DeVivo</b> (@PocketGina) is your friendly neighborhood\
  \ RPG craft wizard. Having been in the entertainment industry since she was 11 years\
  \ old means she's got some groovy stories from the sets of Madmen, Scrubs, and Hannah\
  \ Montana to name a few. Lately, she's been three character sheets stacked in a\
  \ trench coat on Geek &amp; Sundry's Callisto 6, Shield Of Tomorrow, and TBD RPG.\
  \ If podcasts are your jam you can find her providing the voices of Windsgar the\
  \ goblin on Plunders and Blunders and lover of magic, Olive, on Champions of the\
  \ Earth. Also, minty things make her sneeze.</p> \n     <p><b>Jeremy Steven Walker</b>\
  \ (@JwalkerScene) is an American actor originally from Memphis, Tennessee. His first\
  \ television appearance came by way of a national commercial for Crocs that aired\
  \ during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Since then, Jeremy’s resume has grown considerably,\
  \ as he has starred in over thirty film and television productions, several award-nominated\
  \ stage plays, and dozens of worldwide and national commercial campaigns. Quoted\
  \ by film producer, Mark G. Mathis (Precious, Brick, The Identical) as \"an extraordinary\
  \ talent with recognizable star quality,\" Jeremy's dynamic on-camera presence and\
  \ effortless charm have helped solidify his place as one of the film industry's\
  \ top actors to watch.</p> \n     <p><b>Aki</b> (@MxGiniInABottle) is a recent transplant\
  \ to Los Angeles and is a relative newcomer to the world of online RPG-E, though\
  \ they have been rolling dice and playing tabletop games since university. Their\
  \ most recent on-screen work includes New Pantheon, a Scion game on Saving Throw\
  \ Show, and a guest spot on Geek &amp; Sundry’s Callisto 6!</p> \n     <p><b>Erika\
  \ Fermina</b> (@astylepixie) is an actress, stylist, and fantasy enthusiast. You\
  \ can sometimes spot her on a commercial but usually, she’s playing games with Girls\
  \ Guts Glory! </p> \n     <p><b>Rachel Seeley</b> (@Sunnyseeley) is a fan of all\
  \ Tabletop RPGs and an actress is always ecstatic to combine the two. She has appeared\
  \ on G&amp;S before playing on Tales from the Loop, Weave, the Critical Role anniversary\
  \ prequel and GMing on Weave!</p> \n     <p><b>Chris Fishel</b> (@AKAthefish) grew\
  \ up on the sets of sitcom television from the time he was seven years old where\
  \ he discovered his true passion for storytelling and fell in love with making feature\
  \ films. 25 feature films later Mr. Fishel brought his talent for narrative storytelling\
  \ into the RPG-E space in September 2017 when he joined the team at Geek and Sundry.\
  \ After producing shows like Starter Kit, Painters Guild and Game Masters Hall,\
  \ Mr. Fishel is proud to be the Director and producer of the new The Knights of\
  \ Everflame series. </p> \n     <p>Don’t miss it! Catch the finale of <i>Knights\
