  \ \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Murky Waters</h2> \n   <p>\"I know that the Imjaka, dwelling\
  \ so near those reaches, have made a greater study of these ‘scavenger gangs' than\
  \ I,\" Seyusth continued. \"<i>That</i>, Ameyanda, is why I come to you, though\
  \ finding you proved far from simple.\"</p> \n   <p>This time, Ameyanda didn't bother\
  \ to suppress her sigh. \"All right,\" she said, once more hefting her pack. \"\
  Lead the way, shaman, and tell me what you know.\"</p> \n   <p>Seyusth spoke of\
  \ his travails as they began to walk, and the huntress—so far as her exertions allowed—\
  listened.</p> \n   <p>\"It was over half a moon,\" he explained, \"before we realized\
  \ that the hunting patrol was overdue. Another moon, and more, before I could make\
  \ my own apprentice ready to see to Haa-Ok's needs during my prolonged absence.\
  \ And then, as I told you, almost another moon still before I finally tracked down\
  \ the remains of Issisk's band.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Remains?\" <i>If this lizard is\
  \ hauling me into the Sodden Lands to retrieve a</i> body...</p> \n   <p>\"A smattering\
  \ of parts, not entirely rotted into the soil. No intact bodies, and no remaining\
  \ tracks. So I spoke a time with the serpents and birds and toads of the area.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Of course. Who wouldn't?\"</p> \n   <p>\"It was then I learned that\
  \ Issisk was led away in chains, the others slain and their bodies taken. And I\
  \ learned that the attackers were not my people but humans, both living and unliving.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Ameyanda staggered to a halt, her skin breaking out in goosebumps despite\
  \ the sapping heat. She swallowed hard. \"Unliving? Your cousin was taken by the\
  \ dead-who-walk?\" She'd never faced such horrors herself, but the folklore of her\
  \ people was rife with them.</p> \n   <p>\"Alongside the living, yes.\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>She felt her lips moving in silence. Seyusth watched her, unblinking.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Does this pose a problem for you?\" he asked finally.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  A <i>problem</i>? I think this is a bit more severe than a ‘problem'!\" Still, it\
  \ was enough to stiffen her resolve. She'd almost announced that she was going back,\
  \ but no.</p> \n   <p><i>The Imjaka repay our debts</i>. Ameyanda would not be the\
  \ one to violate that tradition, no matter what.</p> \n   <p>Especially not when\
  \ that one detail—the presence of the dead-who-walk—was indeed sufficient to suggest\
  \ to her which of the savenger gangs they sought.</p> \n   <p><i>The White Leech.\
  \ Grandmother Sun, help us...</i></p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> \"Seyusth is a powerful shaman, but woefully ignorant\
  \ regarding the Sodden Lands.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>\"All right, shaman. Follow me;\
  \ I know who you're searching for.\"</p> \n   <p>They trekked beneath shrouding\
  \ canopies of leaves and low-hanging lianas, over fallen logs and rotten fungi,\
  \ through brambles and ferns glistening with condensation and sticky secretions.\
  \ Seyusth slipped through without effort; thorns and foliage ran off him like water.\
  \ Ameyanda, for all her skill, had a harder time. More than one scrape or sting\
  \ brought a grunted curse, and her resentful gaze on the lizardman's back nearly\
  \ set his vest to smoldering.</p> \n   <p>Embarrassment, more than pain, chafed\
  \ her. It had been many years since Ameyanda had required anyone else to slow their\
  \ passage through even the wildest jungle.</p> \n   <p>\"You are certain this White\
  \ Leech is the band we seek?\" Seyusth asked.</p> \n   <p>\"They're the only border\
  \ scavengers who make use of the dead-who-walk. Rumor and tales have it that their\
  \ chieftain, Montirro the Thrice-Blind, learned his necromancies from the Koboto\
  \ people themselves.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I had heard that the Koboto sacrifice anyone\
  \ who nears their lands.\"</p> \n   <p>\"True.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Then how—?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ameyanda shrugged. \"As I said, rumor and tales. But that the White Leech\
  \ raises the dead is no mere tale. I know warriors who have seen it themselves.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"But can you be <i>certain</i> the White Leech is the <i>only</i>\
  \ such band?\" he pressed.</p> \n   <p>\"As certain as you can be that Issisk still\
  \ lives.\"</p> \n   <p>The following miles passed without further conversation.</p>\
  \ \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>They crossed\
  \ no border. No fences, no signposts; no mighty river or towering escarpment marked\
  \ the transition.</p> \n   <p>The trees grew sparser, their roots and branches more\
  \ crooked. Fern leaves and winding briars gave way to hanging mosses and slender\
  \ reeds. The lush scent of loam and sprouting things wafted away beneath the odor\
  \ of rot and stagnant pools.</p> \n   <p>The mud grew thicker, more greedy as it\
  \ tugged at scaled or sandal-wrapped heels. Worse, it became vaguely caustic, just\
  \ enough to cause irritation and a sanity-threatening itch.</p> \n   <p>By the time\
  \ they'd passed beyond the mud flats into the swamp proper, the filthy, lukewarm\
  \ water was almost a relief.</p> \n   <p>This far from the sea and the eternal hurricane\
  \ dubbed the Eye of Abendego, the Sodden Lands were indeed simply a swamp, if a\
  \ swamp with abnormally deep patches and river-like currents. Ameyanda knew that\
  \ the further west they progressed, the worse it would become. Mires of impossible\
  \ size, plague-bearing floodwaters as deep as any lake, a barrage of wind and rain\
  \ so constant as to wear down the heaviest stone.</p> \n   <p>They shouldn't have\
  \ to go so far—to the huntress's knowledge, the White Leech operated primarily here\
  \ in the outskirts—but even this was far from pleasant.</p> \n   <p>When the shallow\
  \ marsh began to develop waves high enough to slap at her chest, and a tepid, breath-like\
  \ gust began to herald the promise of rain, Ameyanda pulled a face and reached out\
  \ to stop her companion in his tracks. Already she had to raise her voice to be\
  \ heard over the building winds.</p> \n   <p>\"We're not going much farther in this\
  \ without a raft of some sort,\" she told him, running a hand through the stubble\
  \ on her scalp. It itched, and retained a surprising amount of water, but she hadn't\
  \ had the opportunity to shave her head in days.</p> \n   <p>Seyusth stepped aside\
  \ to haul a thick vine from a nearby cypress. \"Use this to secure yourself.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Secure myself to wh-<i>augh!</i>\"</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda leapt backward,\
  \ splashing murky water in all directions, as the shaman <i>shifted</i>. One moment,\
  \ a lizardman; the next, over the span of seconds, his limbs drew into his body\
  \ and thickened, his torso elongated, his snout lengthened. His pebbly flesh bulged\
  \ in some spots, smoothed in others.</p> \n   <p>Lurking in the water, eyes and\
  \ nostrils protruding menacingly, was a full-sized crocodile.</p> \n   <p>\"Warn\
  \ me before you do that!\"</p> \n   <p>The crocodile, in a very familiar and languid\
  \ expression, blinked.</p> \n   <p>\"You can't speak when you've turned yourself\
  \ into an animal?\"</p> \n   <p>Blink.</p> \n   <p>\"Oh.\" Ameyanda stepped forward—\
  less gingerly than she felt—looped the vine around the reptile's chest, and climbed\
  \ aboard. <i>Not the most comfortable mount, but it must beat walking.</i></p> \n\
  \   <p>After hours of being tossed about by the beast's wriggling swim, her arms\
  \ and legs bruised raw against its knobby hide and savaged mercilessly by vermin\
  \ both above the water and below, she wasn't so sure of that anymore.</p> \n   <p>Early\
  \ the following day—not that one could <i>tell</i> it was day, given that the pounding\
  \ rains still hadn't moved on—Seyusth apparently scented or detected <i>something</i>.\
  \ With an abrupt twitch that nearly unseated his partner, the crocodile shot through\
  \ the swamps on a new course.</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda, who knew that asking him what\
  \ they were doing was a waste of time and breath, instead wasted that same time\
  \ and breath in a litany of curses.</p> \n   <p>A reed-covered hillock was their\
  \ destination. Seyusth had barely climbed atop the rise before shifting back into\
  \ his natural shape. Anyone with lesser reflexes than the huntress would have been\
  \ sent sprawling.</p> \n   <p>\"You have some steed etiquette to master,\" she groused\
  \ at him. \"Why—?\"</p> \n   <p>\"There.\" Black talons pushed a tuft of reeds so\
  \ she could see. \"Are those White Leech?\"</p> \n   <p>In what amounted to a wide\
  \ corridor of swamp hemmed in by cypress walls, a pair of skiffs moved sluggishly\
  \ across the water. The wood of the haphazard vessels was stained with old blood—\
  old and dry enough that the rain washed absolutely none of it away. The men aboard\
  \ were clad in tatters and leather scraps, held together by everything from cowhide\
  \ straps to sodden twine, and armed with roughly hammered and sharpened scrap metal.\
  \ One man poled each of the skiffs, while the others argued over the choicest cuts\
  \ of... something that had once drawn breath.</p> \n   <p>\"Difficult to tell,\"\
  \ Ameyanda told him, struggling to peer through the downpour. \"We're in their territory,\
  \ but I wouldn't know how to tell the White Leech by sight. They... No,\" she said\
  \ with sudden certainty. \"They're not White Leech.\"</p> \n   <p>\"How do you know?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Because,\" she said, pointing at the ominous shapes suddenly looming\
  \ from the corridor of trees, or rising from beneath the swamp to surround the skiffs\
  \ and their frantic crew, \"I'm fairly sure <i>those</i> are the White Leech.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>They seemed no more than phantoms, obscured by the downpour. Some of\
  \ the silhouettes that formed from within the trees, or from deep within the murky\
  \ waters, appeared humanoid. Others were most assuredly nothing of the kind.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>That the first group they'd spotted were thrown into utter panic by the\
  \ arrival of the second was clear enough, but precisely who the newcomers were,\
  \ or what about them was so horrifying, neither the brown-skinned huntress nor the\
  \ green-scaled shaman could see.</p> \n   <p>The feeblest remnants of what might\
  \ have been shouts or screams drifted through the downpour.</p> \n   <p>\"We must\
  \ get nearer!\" Seyusth yelled in her ear.</p> \n   <p>\"How wise of you, great\
  \ shaman,\" Ameyanda retorted with bitter sarcasm. \"And how do you suggest we...\"\
  \ But the lizardman had already dived into the choppy swamp.</p> \n   <p>\"Spirit-damned\
  \ lizard,\" she hissed at the fading ripples. He'd retained his natural shape, but\
  \ even so, Ameyanda knew she couldn't match his speed in the water. Still grumbling\
  \ under her breath, she hung her quiver of spears across the thickest reeds—the\
  \ weapons would just float away anyway—checked that both mambeles were snug in their\
  \ sheathes, and waded reluctantly into the waters.</p> \n   <p>Even over the course\
  \ of only a few dozen paces, the treacherous mud, the submerged and rotting logs,\
  \ and the abnormal waves conspired to constantly alter the depth of the swamp. At\
  \ times she was submerged to the waist; at others, the crests of those waves passed\
  \ over her head, slapping her across the face with filthy water and reeking algae.\
  \ Still, she preferred to wade, though she was a strong swimmer; she wanted to keep\
  \ her feet under her and her eyes at least mostly clear.</p> \n   <p>She finally\
  \ clambered once more onto a solid surface—a floating tussock of sticks, moss, and\
  \ mud—and spent a moment gasping for breath, coughing up water, and trying with\
  \ all her might to strangle the lizardman with her eyes. \"Some of us,\" she began,\
  \ \"do not swim like—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Look.\"</p> \n   <p>Whatever protests remained\
  \ died in Amayanda's throat.</p> \n   <p>One of the primitive skiffs had already\
  \ been overturned, partly smashed to kindling by a reptilian juggernaut of flaking\
  \ scales and protruding bone. Two more crocodiles—though these two were alive—had\
  \ surfaced alongside the undead monstrosity to snap at men in the water. Nearby,\
  \ bobbing almost peacefully in the currents and waves, five of the dead-who-walk,\
  \ naked and sloughing waterlogged flesh, advanced on the remaining raft.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Beyond those, the huntress could begin to make out the details of the larger\
  \ force emerging from the tree line. A skiff of prodigious size, stained white,\
  \ led the way, followed by two of more traditional girth. The men standing on those\
  \ skiffs, hooting worse than the charau-ka and waving rusted blades overhead, wore\
  \ leather armor clearly formed from a wide variety of creatures. Not a single greave,\
  \ spaulder, or breastplate matched any other, and while some were obviously crafted\
  \ from the tanned hides of swamp beasts—crocodiles and great snakes, primarily—\
  others appeared mammalian and even, on occasion, humanoid in origin. A few of the\
  \ latter still sported locks of hair, flapping wildly in the rain.</p> \n   <p>At\
  \ the forefront, bellowing to shame an enraged elephant, was the most monstrous\
  \ man—if man he was—Ameyanda had ever seen. Easily half again as tall as she and\
  \ monstrously obese, he must have outweighed any three of the others put together.\
  \ Rolls of fat, maggot-pale and glistening with rainwater, bulged from between the\
  \ slapdash components of his armor. He carried a hammer, its head large enough for\
  \ a halfling to have used as an anvil, waving it about with apparent ease. His head\
  \ and jaw seemed subtly misshapen, but that could have been an illusion of distance,\
  \ combined with his straggly, sickly hair—thinning up front, hanging to his shoulder\
  \ blades behind.</p> \n   <p>That mass of flesh and his smaller allies blocked Ameyanda's\
  \ sight of whoever or whatever poled the skiff from the rear, but it shot forward\
  \ with startling speed, seeming to crush the waves before it. Already they were\
  \ near enough to their victims for the most lithe of the White Leech warriors to\
  \ leap from one raft to the other.</p> \n   <p>\"We,\" Seyusth announced suddenly,\
  \ a gleam in his golden eyes, \"could certainly do with local allies. The enemy\
  \ of my enemy, as your people say...\"</p> \n   <p>Had Ameyanda not been so astonished,\
  \ so horrified and repulsed, by the blasphemies of the White Leech—had she not still\
  \ been trying to gather her breath—she might have stopped him. As it was, by the\
  \ time she registered what he was doing, it was already too late.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Seyusth! <i>Damn it!</i>\"</p> \n   <p>The shaman rose, arms held high. The combatants\
  \ might not have noticed his appearance, distracted as they were, until the first\
  \ of the lightning bolts roared from the heavens.</p> \n   <p>Several of the White\
  \ Leech fell to the deck of the skiff or into the ever-hungry waters, their bodies\
  \ blackened. Their gelatinous mountain of a leader recoiled, one arm raised to protect\
  \ his face. The skin along that arm, and across his gut, turned red, then black,\
  \ but he hardly seemed to notice.</p> \n   <p>Almost immediately, every eye present\
  \ scanned their surroundings and fixed on Seyusth. Though the attack had not come\
  \ from him directly, nobody was stupid enough to think the stroke a coincidence.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The lizardman opened his mouth, perhaps to shout something to the men\
  \ he'd meant to rescue, when the entire mass of humanity and undead—<i>including</i>\
  \ those whom the White Leech had just been slaughtering—began shoving their rafts\
  \ through the water, closing on the startled shaman.</p> \n   <p>\"The scavenger\
  \ gangs,\" Ameyanda hissed through heaving breaths, \"<i>always</i> band together\
  \ against outsiders!\"</p> \n   <p>\"I see...\"</p> \n   <p>\"Get us out of here!\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Seysuth stepped to the far side of the floating tussock, presumably\
  \ to once again assume his own crocodile form and carry them beyond the reach of\
  \ the slower skiffs.</p> \n   <p>The undead crocodile erupted from the swamp like\
  \ a breaching whale.</p> \n   <p>The snout, a battering ram of dead scales, rotting\
  \ flesh, and stained bone, slammed the shaman backward to land sprawled, half in\
  \ the swamp. It spun, its jaws a gaping pit to the Abyss. The overwhelming miasma\
  \ of decay, to say nothing of the sprayed droplets of liquefying muscle, nearly\
  \ paralyzed the Imjaka warrior.</p> \n   <p>Nearly.</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda leapt from\
  \ the quivering mass of vegetation, tucking her knees high, just barely clearing\
  \ the oncoming snout. Crying aloud, she kicked down with both legs, slamming the\
  \ jaws together and down into the tussock. Now crouched atop the shambling horror,\
  \ she drove both mambeles deep into its flesh.</p> \n   <p>Muscle tore; bone splintered;\
  \ chipped teeth flew to land scattered amidst the twigs. For a living creature,\
  \ a fatal blow.</p> \n   <p>For the unliving crocodile, an inconvenience.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Seyusth!\" She stepped off the mangled snout, blades raised. \"I could\
  \ do with some—\"</p> \n   <p>The sound of splashing water, thrashing limbs, and\
  \ the impact of <i>something</i> on roughened flesh suggested that the shaman had\
  \ his own problems.</p> \n   <p>The crocodile snapped, attempting to skewer her\
  \ with the edge of a broken jaw. Ameyanda backpedaled, seeking any escape, and glanced\
  \ over her shoulder just in time to see Seyusth fall.</p> \n   <p>A handful of the\
  \ dead-who-walk had followed their crocodilian ally through the waters and clambered\
  \ atop the floating isle. One lay, truly dead, lacerated by the shaman's spear;\
  \ another had been brought down by a second lightning bolt from on high. But even\
  \ as Seyusth turned to handle a third, a head broke the surface of the swamp—a humanoid\
  \ head not mammalian, but reptilian.</p> \n   <p>Seyusth froze, his whole expression\
  \ slack. Ameyanda could only assume he was trying to tell if the unliving thing\
  \ was the missing Issisk. And in that moment of distraction, one of the White Leech\
  \ leapt from the skiff—<i>gods and spirits, how did that ponderous vessel move so\
  \ swiftly?</i>—and slammed a thick cudgel into the lizardman's skull.</p> \n   <p>A\
  \ cudgel... yet he carried a serrated falchion in his other hand.</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda\
  \ saw the grin of the monstrous fat man, the clubs and ropes held by his fellows,\
  \ and knew they had something far worse than a quick death in mind.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming\
