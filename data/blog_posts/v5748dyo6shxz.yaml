  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">I remember the years of\
  \ struggle. Long, stretching seasons where sunlight was sparse, and the hungry night\
  \ arrived all too quickly. I remember the rites and songs as we laid follower after\
  \ follower to rest, forced to move ever onward. Parent and child, animals, friends:\
  \ none were safe as we carved our new paths and founded our new lives.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>Tonight, in the shadow of these great mountains, I share with you a story\
  \ from another time. In this time, your grandparents were small, squalling babes—\
  some of whom I sang lullabies to, heh!—and instead of a seer’s sharp mind, I had\
  \ the strength and skill of a hunter.</p> \n      <p>I was a young man back then,\
  \ instead of Grandfather Eiwa. Oh yes, and I was a skilled archer! With the silence\
  \ of a great cat I stalked prey. With the sharpness of eye to rival a falcon’s,\
  \ I watched over our following. With the patience of a mammoth, I knew when to lay\
  \ still and when to strike with all the strength I had. </p> \n      <p>What I did\
  \ not know was <em>when</em> to use each. Sometimes, a well-meaning action creates\
  \ more trouble than anything.</p> \n      <p>Take this journey with me, and see\
  \ things as they were. The time of the year was close to the very season we enjoy\
  \ now, when daylight just begins to stretch further than the darkness, and the snow\
  \ finally begins to melt. Around our feet, the trails grew slushy and difficult\
  \ to traverse, but the days began to grow brighter, and with them came hope. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>These were my favorite times of the year. The crispness of the blue\
  \ sky was a welcome friend. Have you noticed that the sky never seems so bright,\
  \ so vivid, as during the melts? Perhaps these days I am more comfortable in the\
  \ warmer seasons, but I will always love the newness of the daylight, reborn and\
  \ glorious, as it chases the hard winter away.</p> \n      <p>During this time,\
  \ we were only a few years into establishing the routes we now use every year. Both\
  \ our herd and our numbers were still small; we had only recently started recruiting\
  \ others into our following and teaching them the ways of the Broken Tusk. I was\
  \ a young man, perhaps only a little older than some of you are now. Still an adult\
  \ in the eyes of the following, but young enough to be over-eager to prove myself.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>My day’s task was to scout ahead. I was to learn which creatures\
  \ had awakened from slumber, which patches of grass had revealed themselves from\
  \ beneath the snow, and to ensure the herd’s next resting spot would be free of\
  \ predators and other dangers.</p> \n      <p>I took no partner with me save for\
  \ Isul, my beloved friend, my air-rider. Such a magnificent falcon. He, too, was\
  \ eager to explore the way ahead, and so I encouraged him to go. It was exhilarating\
  \ to be exploring by myself, knowing Isul was not too far away. </p> \n      <p>Stepping\
  \ carefully along the sprouting grasses and dotted pools of melted snow, I came\
  \ upon a spot that led to a shallow riverbed. I was stirred by its beauty and felt\
  \ a swell of pride; this would be a fantastic resting spot for the herd. </p> \n\
  \      <p>In my excitement, I did not pay close enough attention. For by the time\
  \ I had approached, too late did I see the giant creature already exploring the\
  \ waters.</p> \n      <p>I froze in place, watching and waiting. Hoping the massive\
  \ bear would be more interested in the potential fishing spot than in me. For now,\
  \ it seemed oblivious to my presence. </p> \n      <p>I should have let it be and\
  \ reported back to the others. But a thought crossed my mind: how fantastic would\
  \ it be, not just to return to the following with news of this beautiful resting\
  \ site, but to crown that achievement with another: a grizzled bear already brought\
  \ down to feed our people?</p> \n      <p>I see some of you already shaking your\
  \ heads at the thought. And you are right to do so. Well you know by now that you\
  \ should never hunt bear by yourself. </p> \n      <p>Only, I was convinced I was\
  \ not alone. I could call for Isul, and together we could handle anything. And the\
  \ longer I thought about it, the more I persuaded myself it was the best choice.\
  \ Food was in short supply, after all, and the great creature could provide much.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>I crouched low in the muddy bank and began readying my bow. But\
  \ when I looked up, I was not ready to see the great beast charging me! </p> \n\
  \      <p>It had seen me; my presence startled it, and I suddenly understood how\
  \ alone I really was. In the space of a few seconds, many thoughts ran through my\
  \ mind: <em>where is Isul? I cannot outrun the bear. I don’t have time to make more\
  \ than one shot. I should have waited. Ancestors, let me live through this and I\
  \ shall not make this mistake again!</em></p> \n      <p>The brown bear bounded\
  \ toward me, then stopped short with a mighty thump of its front paws. It growled\
  \ at me, teeth clacking. I began backing away from it slowly, hoping this was the\
  \ only charge the creature would make.</p> \n      <p>It was not. It surged forward\
  \ again with similar body language, only this time it connected, knocking me back\
  \ into the mud. Panic surging, I knew my greatest chance of living right now was\
  \ to feign death. I rolled instantly to my stomach and cradled my head and neck\
  \ with my arms. Already my hip was stinging from where the bear had made contact,\
  \ but at least my instinct was correct. With a mighty thump that shook the mud,\
  \ he stomped once more, but not on me.</p> \n      <p>I could not see him, but in\
  \ my mind’s eye, he was only a few scant feet away. <em>Let him be content, I prayed.\
  \ Let him go away…</em></p> \n      <p>He was not content. He did not go away. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>I felt the air leave my lungs as his snout dug under my side, trying\
  \ to flip me over. Every last bit of me wanted to yelp, to flee. <em>No, do not\
  \ flee, for you will make him chase you!</em> It took all my strength to keep my\
  \ stomach to the ground, keep my arms shielding my head and neck.</p> \n      <p>He\
  \ must have been as frustrated as I, for the next thing I knew, I felt his snout\
  \ at my hip again, strong claws burning into my leg. I felt a moment of weightlessness,\
  \ soon followed by flattening, encompassing pain along the front of my body and\
  \ an icy splash of water above my shoulders. I barely had enough time to lift my\
  \ head and take a breath before continuing to feign death. <em>He tossed me into\
  \ the water!</em></p> \n      <p>Through the panic and the loud rush of water over\
  \ my ears, it took me a moment before I realized two important things: first, despite\
  \ the pain, I was still alive, and second: my hips were still connected to solid\
  \ ground. I was not too far under the water.</p> \n      <p>But there was still\
  \ the bear! I held my breath, feeling another tap, this time at my ankle. <em>Leave\
  \ me be</em>, I begged, remaining still as possible, half in the water and my lungs\
  \ burning with need. <em>Go find something else, before playing dead becomes being\
  \ dead!</em></p> \n      <p>I felt nothing else. I knew I shouldn’t move until the\
  \ bear was long gone. But my lungs were done recycling my one breath; I had no more.\
  \ My body ached from claw and earth. Moving was my only chance at life, and yet\
  \ if I moved while the bear was still near, it was certain death. </p> \n      <p>I\
  \ waited. And waited.</p> \n      <p>I felt no more contact. </p> \n      <p><em>Must…\
  wait. </em></p> \n      <p><em>Wait.</em></p> \n      <p><em>Wait.</em></p> \n \
  \     <p><em>I NEED AIR.</em></p> \n      <p>I turned my head just enough to take\
  \ in a breath and open one eye and was rewarded. For the bear had reared up, swiping\
  \ at a blur of speed, dark feathers surrounding sharp eyes. Isul had returned! My\
  \ beloved friend dove at the bear, distracting him, leading him away from me!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>I sat up gasping and, in frenzied haste, looked around for my bow.\
  \ There! At the water’s edge! I dove for it despite my pain and saw more than felt\
  \ my hand close around its haft. My other hand fumbled to draw an arrow from my\
  \ quiver, and with horror, I realized only one remained! The others had tumbled\
  \ out as the bear tossed me around.</p> \n      <p>I had to make my shot count.\
  \ I whistled sharply—a signal to Isul. My falcon friend responded immediately, as\
  \ I knew he would. He circled up around the bear’s head once, leading the great\
  \ creature just far enough away. In a moment, he would circle again and expose the\
  \ bear’s chest and shoulder to me.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \     </div> \n      <br> \n      <p>It is very hard to get an exact shot at a bear’\
  s heart, especially when it’s already aggravated. But Isul was well-practiced, and\
  \ we had hunted together many times. This, at least, was a perfect moment in an\
  \ otherwise-messy situation. Isul wheeled. The bear turned. For one frozen moment,\
  \ our eyes met, the bear and me. And then, with more precision than I’d ever had,\
  \ I loosed the arrow. </p> \n      <p>The missile flew true, and I was rewarded\
  \ with the telltale spray of blood, the muscular spasm as the animal decided whether\
  \ to flee or fight . . . and then it slumped over.</p> \n      <p>It took me a long\
  \ moment to work up the nerve to ensure the bear was finished. But finished it was.\
  \ I sent Isul back to the following with a message asking for assistance. It wasn’\
  t precisely as I’d imagined; the following had to help me as much as help with the\
  \ bear.</p> \n      <p>And truly, my following, this is the most important lesson\
  \ I can give from the tale tonight: we are best when we work together. We must learn\
  \ to ask for—and accept!—help when needed. My intentions were good, but it was a\
  \ foolish choice that nearly cost me my life, and nearly cost the following one\
  \ of its hunters. We are made weaker with each loss of life, just as we are made\
  \ stronger with each new addition to the following. </p> \n      <p>This night,\
  \ I see you all here with me, listening and learning our ways, honoring each other\
  \ and those who came before. I see you gathered, people of all shapes, all sizes,\
  \ and my heart is happy. We are stronger for having you. </p> \n      <p>I celebrate\
  \ you this night, Broken Tusks. And I know you will face bravely whatever challenges\
  \ come your way.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
