  \ Pass 2</b><br> New friends and enemies, dangers and rewards await you—both as\
  \ extensions of the main <em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em> campaign and\
  \ as standalone experiences.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>DLC #4</b><br>\
  \ Here comes a new companion for the Knight Commander’s party and a new playable\
  \ class: the ever-changing shifter! Bolster your party with a reliable brawler capable\
  \ of taking on the aspects of various wild beasts. Delve into the lost secrets of\
  \ Old Sarkoris. And who knows? Maybe you will even find new love, one transcending\
  \ time itself.</p> \n      <p><b>DLC #5</b><br> This new standalone campaign picks\
  \ up where the “Through the Ashes” DLC story left off. A new demon lord with hordes\
  \ of frozen minions is emerging from the depths of the Abyss. With the Knight Commander\
  \ busy elsewhere, what can a group of regular adventurers with no mythic powers\
  \ do to save the day? This expansion offers a 6-7 hour story, which you can play\
  \ independently or with the hero from your “Through the Ashes” saved game. And when\
  \ you’re done, a new dungeon in the main campaign will be open for the Knight Commander\
  \ to explore.</p> \n      <p><b>DLC #6</b><br> During your first visit to Kenabres,\
  \ things didn’t go well. Now that the demonic assault has been thwarted and the\
  \ crusaders are preparing their final counterattack, why not take a little break?\
  \ Kenabres, burned and rebuilt, is holding a new festival, and the Knight Commander\
  \ will be the guest of honor. This is your chance to spend some quality time away\
  \ from the battlefields together with your companions—and, perhaps, go on a special\
  \ date with your loved one. Be careful, though: the war isn’t over yet, and even\
  \ the new, peaceful Kenabres might be hiding its share of secrets...</p> \n    \
