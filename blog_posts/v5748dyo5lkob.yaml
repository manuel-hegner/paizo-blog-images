  \    <p itemprop=\"description\">In addition to a vast amount of information about\
  \ the Pact Worlds themselves, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9zkn?Starfinder-Pact-Worlds\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Pact Worlds</em></a> book also contains numerous new player options\
  \ tied to specific groups and places within the setting. Some of this material,\
  \ such as the many new themes (biotechnician, corporate agent, cultist, cyberborn,\
  \ death-touched, dragonblood, dream prophet, gladiator, roboticist, solar disciple,\
  \ space pirate, tempered pilgrim, wild warden, and xenoarchaeologist) is presented\
  \ alongside the specific planets or societies within the Pact Worlds each item is\
  \ most strongly associated with. In most cases such material is also useable for\
  \ characters from disparate backgrounds, but it makes the most sense to present\
  \ them in the context of the worlds and groups they are most likely to be connected\
  \ with.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7107-PlayerOptions.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7107-PlayerOptions_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Other player options, such as the new archetypes, feats,\
  \ equipment, spells, and races are gathered into a player support chapter for ease\
  \ of reference. Like the themes, the archetypes (Arcanamirium sage, divine champion,\
  \ Skyfire centurion, star knight, Starfinder data jockey, and Steward officer) exist\
  \ to show ways in which player characters can be part of specific groups and benefit\
  \ from the training and techniques those groups provide. Feats are a mix of those\
  \ which are popular with numerous groups within the Pact Worlds (such as Close Combat)\
  \ and those that provide a strong link to specific elements of the Pact Worlds (such\
  \ as Divine Blessing). Much of the equipment has explicit links to some group that\
  \ manufactures or uses it extensively (sword canes are popular on Absalom Station,\
  \ the interposing weapon fusion was developed by the Knights of Golarion, and so\
  \ on).</p> \n    <p>The new playable races presented all have very strong ties to\
  \ the Pact Worlds, though the exact nature of those ties vary considerable depending\
  \ on the race. Astrazoans are shapeshifters that often pass as other races, and\
  \ may trace their origin back to Apostae. Bantrids are a race of rolling creatures\
  \ that have awoken from a long hibernation on a shepherd moon of Liavara. Borai\
  \ are an unusual form of undead, most common on Eox, where an undead spirit possess\
  \ a still-barely-living host body. Khizars are a plant race that evolved on Castrovel.\
  \ SROs (sentient robotic organisms) are highly-evolved true machine intelligences\
  \ most commonly found of Aballon, with a wide range of appearances 9and existing\
  \ in both Small and medium frames). Strix are one of the many orphan races of lost\
  \ Golarion, who have managed to adapt to life among the stars. Each of these races\
  \ is designed to take its place alongside the core and legacy races presented in\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a>,\
  \ and each tie themselves to one or more of the worlds outlined in <em>Starfinder\
  \ Pact Worlds</em>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7107-Eoxian.jpg\"\
