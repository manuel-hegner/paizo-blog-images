  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Ishaani walked through the\
  \ bustling market in the shadow of her efreeti guardian, Shadqadir. \"I don't like\
  \ this. It's dangerous, dealing with... these matters... out in the open.\" She\
  \ clutched the scroll case close to her chest, though it was already secured across\
  \ her body on a leather strap and further sealed with magic. </p> \n      <p>Shadqadir\
  \ rumbled his volcanic laugh. \"You feel unsafe in my company, little Ishi? Have\
  \ I not protected your family against every harm for six generations?\" </p> \n\
  \      <p>The crowded lanes were rather less crowded for them than they were for\
  \ everyone else, as people gave Shadqadir a wide berth. Genies of all sorts were\
  \ common enough here in Niswan, but Shadqadir was no aloof marid or benevolent djinn.\
  \ Efreet were made of fire and fury, and he radiated heat and malice. Though Shadqadir\
  \ had been a constant presence in her life since infancy, Ishaani still found his\
  \ burning eyes, razored horns, and knowing grin disturbing at times.</p> \n    \

  \      </div> \n      <p>She would never show him fear, though. \"I am no longer\
  \ a child,\" she snapped. \"I'm capable of taking care of myself. I've studied at\
  \ the—\"</p> \n      <p>\"Yes, yes, a House of Perfection.\" The efreeti yawned,\
  \ smoke rising from his mouth. \"We're all very impressed. You probably thought\
  \ attending the Monastery of the Unblinking Flame would flatter my fiery nature\
  \ and stop me from eating your young when the time comes.\"</p> \n      <p>\"My\
  \ choice was not influenced by you at all. I chose that House because the study\
  \ of occult philosophy interests me more than strength of arms.\" </p> \n      <p>\"\
  Why would you worry about martial skills when you have my powers to command? At\
  \ least until you spawn.\" </p> \n      <p>Ishaani's ancestor had bound Shadqadir\
  \ to service centuries before, with direct control of his considerable powers passed\
  \ to the firstborn of his previous owner... but the binding was flawed, and Shadqadir\
  \ would go free upon the birth of the seventh generation. He made no secret of his\
  \ plans to take revenge on Ishaani's entire family for his time of servitude once\
  \ she had a child.</p> \n      <p>Ishaani had therefore decided to be the last of\
  \ her line. If she died without a child, he would also go free, but she was young,\
  \ and had time to work on <em>that</em> problem. If her legacy could not continue\
  \ in the form of children, she needed to make her mark on the world in other ways.\
  \ This scroll, found behind a false wall in a forgotten store room deep in her family's\
  \ estate, presented the greatest opportunity to do that. \"Just be watchful, Shad.\
  \ I am less concerned with assault or theft than with someone overhearing our discussion.\
  \ We should have found someone to authenticate the scroll who would come to us.\"\
  \ The scholar they were going to see had actually offered to come to the estate...\
  \ in six weeks, when his schedule opened up.</p> \n      <p>\"You made no mention\
  \ of convenience, Ishi. You asked for the best, and the most discreet. As always,\
  \ I followed your instructions to the letter.\" </p> \n      <p><em>And not one\
  \ syllable beyond</em>, she thought. \"The best is an Avistani man? I still find\
  \ that hard to believe.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Sometimes the perspective of an outlander\
  \ offers clarity. For instance, as a human, you find Jalmeray to be an isle of wonders\
  \ and Niswan a city of splendor. You marvel at its golden temples, its graceful\
  \ pagodas, its perfumed streets, its shining palaces, its bridges and towers wrought\
  \ of magic and metal together, at all these myriad mortal glories.\" He gestured\
  \ widely, sending the people nearby scurrying away. \"While I, unblinded by sentiment,\
  \ hailing from a more rarefied plane, see this place for what it truly is.\" </p>\n\
  \      <p>\"Which is?\"</p> \n      <p>Shadqadir sniffed. \"Kindling.\" </p> \n\
  \      <p>They reached a book-filled stall draped in colorful cloth, the largest\
  \ in a lane full of booksellers, scribes, and calligraphers. A dapper man, paler\
  \ than Ishaani and elaborately bearded and mustachioed, approached them. \"You must\
  \ be the young lady who wanted to see me. And your companion.\" He nodded respectfully\
  \ to the efreeti. \"How may I be of service?\"</p> \n      <p>\"You are Zotikos\
  \ the Wise?\" Ishaani said. </p>\n      <p>\"Some flatter me so.\"</p> \n      <p>She\
  \ glanced around, then leaned close. \"I am told there is no greater expert in the\
  \ antiquities of Jalmeray dating from the reign of the Arclords.\" </p>\n      <p>\"\
  This I can confirm.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I have a scroll that purports to be from\
  \ that era. I wish to determine its authenticity.\" </p> \n      <p>Zotikos nodded.\
  \ \"The world is awash in false treasure maps and forgeries.\" </p> \n      <p>\"\
  It is a matter of some discretion—\" </p> \n      <p>Zotikos touched a jewel at\
  \ his throat and the bustling noise of the market vanished, some spell to exclude\
  \ sound and prevent eavesdropping. \"We have complete privacy now.\"</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Ishaani opened the scroll case, carefully removed the document within, and\
  \ unrolled its delicate length.</p> \n      <p>Zotikos leaned close, scanned the\
  \ document, then looked into Ishaani's face. \"This purports to be a letter detailing\
  \ the hiding place of the legendary artifact known as the Scepter of the Arclords,\
  \ written by a leader of that order before they fled the island.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Oh good, he's literate,\" Shadquidar said. \"We know what it says. Is it <em>real</em>?\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Mmm. Probably not. There was a rumor the Scepter had been found\
  \ recently by an Andoren fool, but that wasn't true, either. May I?\"</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Ishaani handed over the scroll. Zotikos pinched the document between his\
  \ fingers, put it close to his eyes, and even sniffed it. She was afraid he might\
  \ taste the ink. He instead took a round lens from his pocket and gazed through\
  \ it. After a moment he handed the scroll back. \"I don't know if the contents are\
  \ true, but the document comes from the right period. The quality of the ink, the\
  \ level of fading, the composition of the paper—it's all consistent with the last\
  \ years of Arclord dominion over Jalmeray. Even if it's accurate, the Scepter is\
  \ doubtless long gone, looted or moved—\"</p> \n      <p>\"We don't need that kind\
  \ of advice.\" The efreeti opened his hand, and gold coins dropped onto the table.\
  \ Zotikos went to scoop them up and hissed, dropping them, and making the efreeti\
  \ chuckle. \"Those may be a bit warm.\"</p> \n      <p>Ishaani glared at the effreeti\
  \ and said, \"Thank you for your help, Zotikos. I can count on your discretion?\"\
  \ </p> \n      <p>\"Of course.\"</p> \n      <p>\"If not, it can be compelled,\"\
  \ Shadqadir growled, and the man looked appropriately worried.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ two of them stepped out of the bubble of privacy, and the sound of the market\
  \ returned. They walked for a couple of minutes, Ishaani in silent thought as she\
  \ considered her next moves, and then the efreeti spoke again.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  The terms of my service require me to tell you that man was not actually Zotikos,\
  \ the Avastani scholar, but an imposter. I suspect he was a rakshasa cloaked in\
  \ illusion.\"</p> \n      <p>Ishaani wanted to stop and look back, but she kept\
  \ walking as naturally as possible. \"How do you know?\"</p> \n      <p>The efreeti\
  \ chuckled. \"I met Zotikos once before, years ago, on an errand for your mother.\
  \ He initially proved reluctant to turn over a volume she desired, so I persuaded\
  \ him, and left a small mark on his wrist to remember me by—a brand in the shape\
  \ of my fingertip. Even if Zotikos somehow forgot me, his flesh would remember our\
  \ meeting, but the skin was unmarred. I only noticed when his sleeve slid back as\
  \ he handed over the scroll or I would have alerted you earlier.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  A rakshasa,\" she murmured. \"We can't trust his appraisal, then. The letter may\
  \ be false.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Or it's real, and now one of the devil-born knows\
  \ your quest. Perhaps the fiend even replaced Zotikos in order to meet with us.\
  \ We arranged this meeting two days ago, after all. Plenty of time for an interested\
  \ party curious about the scroll to make their own plans.\"</p> \n      <p>\"How\
  \ could anyone even know about the scroll?\" </p> \n      <p>Shadqadir shrugged.\
  \ \"Treacherous servants, spies, magical surveillance... your parents are known\
  \ to dabble in powerful matters, and it wouldn't surprise me if your estate is watched.\
  \ The point is, we can no longer count on security through obscurity. We now face\
  \ potential opposition in your quest for greatness.\" Shadqadir's smile was like\
  \ a forge fire.</p> \n      <p>She scowled. \"You don't need to look so happy about\
  \ it.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Oh, but I am. I'm pledged to protect your life and well-being\
  \ to the fullness of my abilities... but if sufficiently powerful enemies rise against\
  \ you, my best might not be good enough. In that case, you could die, and I would\
  \ be free to eat your family.\" He sighed contentedly.</p> \n      <p>She'd heard\
  \ this sort of thing from him before... but she'd never worried about it until now.\
  \ \"Efreet don't need to eat anything at all,\" she grumbled. \"Let alone my relatives.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>He shrugged. \"I don't expect to enjoy the process, but a promise\
  \ is a promise. So. Shall we go out and seize your destiny, Ishi?\"</p> \n     \
