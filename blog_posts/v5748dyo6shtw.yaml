  description\">While obviously a lot has happened in the past few weeks, I wanted\
  \ to give you all a recap of Gen Con Online, our last major convention of the year.</p>\n\
  \     <p> </p>\n     <ul> \n      <li>We ran over 400 tables of Pathfinder Society,\
  \ Starfinder Society, and the Adventure Card Society, with 131 GMs running games.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>This year’s Pathfinder and Starfinder Specials premiered at the event\
  \ to great fanfare. These linked specials were a lot of fun to produce behind the\
  \ scenes, and we hope you all enjoyed them! They are now available for conventions\
  \ to request and will be available for sale next August.</li> \n      <li>Our Gen\
  \ Con charity auction raised $5,886 for Take This and Trinity Haven, Gen Con’s chosen\
  \ partner charities. Thanks to all who participated in these efforts!</li> \n  \
  \   </ul> \n     <p>We hope you all enjoyed this event, as well as all our preceding\
  \ events. Our major convention season has concluded for the year, though local conventions\
  \ are still happening year-round with Paizo support. We encourage you all to find\
  \ your local group and join up with their events!</p> \n     <h2>Digital Adventure\
  \ Releases</h2> \n     <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available October\
  \ 27, 2021. Releases marked with an asterisk are part of a subscription</p> \n \
  \    <h3>Pathfinder</h3> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ajc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-DevilWrought-Disappearance\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-04: The Devil-Wrought Disappearance*</a><br> <a\

  \ \n     <p>Last week, I posted a longer blog post about the current sanctioning\
  \ status, so <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shtp?September-2021-Sanctioning-Status-Update\"\
  >I’ll link you over there</a> and summarize some of the big news:</p> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li><em>Tech Revolution</em> is now sanctioned for Starfinder Society!</li>\
  \ \n      <li>The priority order for sanctioning the upcoming Pathfinder books is\
  \ <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, followed by <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Other adventures and Adventure Paths are in progress and will be released\
  \ as close to street date as we can get them.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>One note\
  \ I wanted to mention on the upcoming Pathfinder hardcovers: both books have accessibility\
  \ and mobility devices in them. These are a little bit trickier to sanction than\
  \ normal rules content; we want to ensure that you can play characters that use\
  \ these devices to adventure, but we want to prevent using them to power-game, or\
  \ their abuse at the tables by people who aren’t interested in representing adventurers\
  \ of all capabilities. As such, we’re working on rules language that threads the\
  \ needle between “policing who is <em>really</em> disabled” and “allowing open access\
  \ to all adventurers at all times.” This is something I’m very invested in getting\
  \ right, and we’ll be consulting with experts on the topic. As a result, sanctioning\
  \ for these options may be slightly delayed behind the rest of the books. We’ll\
  \ keep you informed, thank you so much for your patience!</p> \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program\
  \ involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must\
  \ run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent).\
  \ A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This month, we had one GM reach their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.\
  \ We also welcome our second and third five-glyph GMs for Pathfinder Society (Second\
  \ Edition)!</p> \n     <p><b>5th Nova</b>: Michael Beck<br> <b>5th Glyph</b>: Jocelyn\
  \ Hamilton, Andrew Watson</p> \n     <p>Congratulations to our new 5 Star and 5\
  \ Glyph GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved\
  \ your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> \n     <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n     <p>Now\
  \ that our new specials have premiered to the world, we have a number of upcoming\
  \ conventions offering them. Check out the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\"\
