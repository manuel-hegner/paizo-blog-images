  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I hope this blog finds our\
  \ communities of players weathering the social distancing restrictions. As we noted\
  \ in last week’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh54\">organized\
  \ play blog</a>, we already moved some of our organized play activities online and\
  \ are working to add more over the upcoming weeks. A huge shout out to the GMs who\
  \ are learning new platforms and offering their skills via different mediums. For\
  \ those that prefer play-by-post to virtual tabletops, Outpost III launches this\
  \ week. You can find more information here.</p> \n     <p>With working from home\
  \ causing a new set of challenges for the organized play team, we decided to combine\
  \ our preview blogs into one for this month. We’d appreciate feedback on this new\
  \ format, so please put any constructive criticisms below.</p> \n     <p>We hope\
  \ you enjoy playing these scenarios as much as our team enjoyed working on them!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>If you didn’t see it earlier, check out our blog where we showed off\
  \ the fantastic <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh5a\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society (second edition) faction art</a>.</p> \n     <p>Next week, tune in for\
  \ a status update on organized play. Until then, Explore, Report, Cooperate (and\
  \ wash hands!)</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Tonya\
  \ Woldridge<br><em>Organized Play Manager</em></p> \n     <h2>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Releases</h2> \n     <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! This month we’ve got a couple\
  \ exciting scenarios for you and one awesome quest, so I’ll be jumping right in\
  \ and letting you know what those are.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0232v?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-116-The-Perennial-Crown-Part-1-Opal-of-Bhopan\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario # 1-16: The Perennial Crown Part 1, Opal of Bhopan</i></a>\

  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-17: The Perennial Crown Part 2, The Thorned Monarch</i></a>\
  \ are a pair of back-to-back Tier 3–6 scenarios written by Alex Augunas, veteran\
  \ Paizo freelancer and third-party publisher, and Thilo Graf, who you might know\
  \ for his comprehensive reviews of tabletop gaming products at <a href=\"http://endzeitgeist.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">endzeitgeist.com</a> and contributions to high-profile third-party\
  \ products like Lost Sphere Publishing’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01y52?The-City-of-7-Seraphs\"\
  ><i>City of 7 Seraphs</i></a>. When I reached out to Alex and Thilo about working\
  \ on this project, I knew I had something really unique and I had a strong feeling\
  \ that they were the ones who could give it to me. <i>The Perennial Crown</i> adventures\
  \ are part of the Open Road season metaplot, which send the Pathfinders sailing\
  \ down the eastern coast of Garund to the famed island of Bhopan, where founding\
  \ Pathfinder Selmius Foster met his end some four centuries ago. On this island\
  \ that much of the Inner Sea has considered to be practically mythological for hundreds\
  \ of years, the PCs will find that both their enemies and allies are fey and inscrutable,\
  \ bound by beliefs, traditions, and ambitions far older than the Pathfinder Society\
  \ or most nations of the Inner Sea.</p> \n     <p>In addition to exciting new NPCs\
  \ like the one pictured here, be ready to see these adventures showcase some of\
  \ the exciting new subsystems introduced in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c1?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide\"\

  \ shares her awesomeness and takes us to Numeria with Tier 3–6 quest <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq0232u?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-8-Shadows-of-the-Black-Sovereign\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Quest #8: Shadows of the Black Sovereign</i></a>! Numeria\
  \ is a land of high technology ruled by a warrior-king, and for years the Pathfinder\
  \ Society has been banned from operating within its borders. This hasn’t stopped\
  \ Venture-Captain Dagur Hawksight from maintaining a secret lodge in the border\
  \ town of Hajoth Hakados, however, and now the time for the Pathfinders to step\
  \ out of the shadows has come once more! Not everyone is excited to see the Pathfinders\
  \ joining Numeria’s political scene, and as the Black Sovereign himself makes his\
  \ way to the lodge, Dagur finds that a scribe has gone missing with ledgers critical\
  \ to sealing a deal that would allow the Pathfinders to more openly explore the\
  \ country and its technological wonders. Can the PCs track down the critical documents\
  \ and missing scribe before Numeria’s iron-fisted warlord arrives to drive the Pathfinders\
  \ from Numeria once and for all?</p> \n     <p>That’s all I’ve got for you adventurers!\
  \ Good luck in the battles to come, and until next time, Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>\

  \ <p>Two new adventures coming to you this month, including our first trip to Vesk-controlled\
  \ territory, as well as an extraplanar jaunt that starts the endgame for our Season\
  \ 2 storyline. Let’s see what’s on the docket!</p> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022x5?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-219-Truth-Keepers\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society #2-19: Truth Keepers</i></a> is a repeatable Tier 3-6 scenario\
  \ from 5-nova GM Natalie Kertzner and new author (and prolific GM) John Curtin.\
  \ This one starts with a bang, as an evening of relaxation at a Starfinder bar is\
  \ interrupted by an attack! To retrieve a stolen artifact, the PCs will have to\
  \ travel to the heart of the Veskarium itself and tangle with a fringe cult of vesk\
  \ soldiers. This adventure features randomized elements, as well as a number of\
  \ colorful NPCs, that are sure to keep you coming back for more! And if you’re really\
  \ hungry for more Veskarium, pick up <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zud?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space\"\
  ><i>Starfinder: Near Space</i></a>, on shelves next week! </p> \n     <p>The Seeker’\
  s Respite (the bar in question) is a regular hangout for Starfinder agents. Inside,\
  \ while your time away celebrating Starfinders new and old, joining in a vidgame,\
  \ or just stewing with other agents over this terrible equipment they keep sending\
  \ you out with, I mean, this battery barely holds a charge, and I’m pretty sure\
  \ this second skin is more like a fifth skin at this point…</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ Shades of Spite is a Tier 7-10 scenario from veteran author Vanessa Hoskins. Those\
  \ of you keeping up with the Year of a Thousand Bites storyline will likely have\
  \ strong feelings about a particular white-furred ysoki, and many are asking: “\
  Why is Datch like this?” To get the answer to that question, the PCs, along with\
  \ a priest of Lao Shu Po, venture to the Shadow Plane. While there, a master assassin\
  \ tests their mettle, in the hopes that they get what they need to finally defeat\
  \ their foe.</p> \n     <p>We’re in the endgame of year 2 now, and the only thing\
  \ standing between the Starfinders and Datch’s machinations is this enigmatic individual.\
  \ Will the PCs convince him to share what he knows, or does he have other motivations\
  \ entirely?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/031820_SilentStrike.jpg\"\
