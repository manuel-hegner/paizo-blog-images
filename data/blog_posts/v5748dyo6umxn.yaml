  \      <br>\n      <h2>Joseph Blomquist (he/him)</h2>\n      <h3><em>SFS1 #6-03:\
  \ Project Dawn</em> and <em>SFS1 Special #6-99: The End Awakens</em></h3>\n    \
  \  <p>This season, I had the opportunity to put my stamp on two adventures that\
  \ couldn’t be more different.</p>\n      <p>For the first one, <em>Starfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #6-03: Project Dawn</em>, I was given the chance to dive back into the\
  \ nostalgia of my gaming youth when Shadowrun was my game of choice. <em>Project\
  \ Dawn</em> is truly intended to be a standard espionage run against an evil corporate\
  \ entity and was a ton of fun to write. Jess even let me bring back an NPC from\
  \ my first ever SFS adventure! In all honesty, using a simple subsystem to create\
  \ tension while sneaking around the Dayside Inc. head office was a treat unto itself.</p>\n\
  \      <p><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-99: The End Awakens</em> brought entirely\
  \ different obstacles and opportunities. As a special, its needs were far different\
  \ than a standard SFS adventure. Fortunately, I was working alongside the dev of\
  \ some of my favorite PFS adventures, Mike Kimmel. While our styles are very different,\
  \ they complement each other well, which just shows Jess’s high Wisdom score in\
  \ pairing us together. One of my goals was to bring a lot of the big moments and\
  \ decisions back to the table instead of solely allowing the house to have all the\
  \ fun. And we got away with it! We had forking paths, aid tokens based on table\
  \ decisions, and even a big moment to understand Krethiskar that occurred at a table\
  \ level! But more importantly, I got to return to terrorizing Starfinders with bugs,\
  \ as happened in my somewhat infamous adventure <em>Illegal Shipment</em> from four\
  \ seasons ago. Starfinder tears really do taste so sweet…</p>\n      <p>Anyway,\
  \ for more about me, check out the blog I never update at www.UnderwearOnTheOutside.com\
  \ or on social media under the name DoctorMono. Or better yet, pick up <em>Mechageddon!</em>\
  \ and get to know what makes me tick (spoilers: Mechs vs. kaiju).</p>\n      <p>See\
  \ you in Second Edition!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \      <h3><em>SFS1 #6-09: Ridgerock Rescue</em></h3>\n      <p>Hi everyone! My\
  \ name is Charlie Brooks, and my pronouns are he/him. I had the privilege of writing\
  \ <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-09: Ridgerock Rescue</em>, which was my first\
  \ Starfinder publication and an opportunity to engage with this season’s metaplot\
  \ by revealing the truth behind the Organization.</p>\n      <p>My gaming group\
  \ loves “adopting” cute and unusual creatures. Since I was going to involve them\
  \ in the playtest for this scenario, I made sure to add some elements that would\
  \ make them smile. A big piece of that picture was the skittermander Baazo and his\
  \ “burnydooms.” Jessica Catalan provided sage advice in crafting this encounter,\
  \ leading to a sidebar with sample “chitter-chatter” and placing Baazo in a control\
  \ center so particularly quick groups wouldn’t wipe him out in a single round. In\
  \ playtesting, the encounter went exactly as I hoped, which is a rare thing in any\
  \ game for me.</p>\n      <p>Writing a revelation scene in an RPG adventure is different\
  \ from doing it in a novel, since you don’t have control over the characters and\
  \ their reactions. The end of <em>Ridgerock Rescue</em> features a lot of exposition\
  \ about the Organization. I tried to use Ongie’s voice in a compelling way so players\
  \ felt like they were unraveling a mystery.</p>\n      <p>Outside of the RPG sphere,\
  \ my recently-released novel <em>Meddling Heroes</em> mashes up a hard-boiled detective\
  \ story with Silver Age super-heroics. You can find more about that and my other\
  \ projects at www.ChBrooks.com.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Alison Cybe (they/them)</h2>\n\
  \      <h3><em>SFS1 #6-10: The Death of Kortus IV</em></h3>\n      <p>In <em>The\
  \ Death of Kortus IV</em>, your characters enter a region to evacuate citizens facing\
  \ the threat of genocide, proactively interceding against the forces trying to destroy\
  \ them. Starfinders are not a military faction, but they possess enough strength,\
  \ expertise, and allies to be a positive force for change in the galaxy.</p>\n \
  \     <p>The Starfinder Society has been shown to possess corruption, and no small\
  \ number of agents have gone rogue; this isn’t a utopian setting. But at the same\
  \ time, they’re the protagonists and can act heroically.</p>\n      <p>And I don’\
  t believe that any true hero, any group on the side of good, would stand by idly\
  \ while an entire country or planet is subject to genocide. At the time I wrote\
  \ this adventure, that wasn’t a heavily political statement to make. Things have\
  \ changed. My position has not. All genocides are an act of raw, unfiltered evil\
  \ and must be acted against unilaterally.</p>\n      <p>I’m aware that the adventures\
  \ I’ve written are highly political; I include transgender characters where I don’\
  t have to and make political stances very clear. I strongly believe gaming can be\
  \ used as a means to discuss, explore, and unify ourselves. I’m also well and able\
  \ to make a load more of these; ask the devs, loudly and repeatedly, to give me\
  \ more. You do that, you’ll get more queer and political adventures like this.</p>\n\

  \      <p>Hello! I’m Jeremy Corff (he/him) and I wrote <em>Starfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #6-11: Gifts Ungiven</em>. Inspired by a few antics from my own childhood, as\
  \ well as classics like <em>Home Alone</em>, I tried to set a light tone while still\
  \ keeping to the “well-meaning disaster” theme. Without giving away spoilers, I\
  \ think my favorite part of the adventure is the running gag of Big Cherry Goo-gurt\
  \ (tm). No doubt available at all respectable space ports in the Pact Worlds and\
  \ beyond! I just hope folks have enjoyed the scenario half as much as I enjoyed\
  \ writing it.</p>\n      <p>If you’d like to find out more about other projects\
  \ I’ve worked on, you can find me on Blue Sky at @solorunstudio.bsky.social or at\
  \ my Starfinder blog https://solorunstudio.com/ where I post weekly homebrew Starfinder\
  \ content.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Hilary Moon Murphy</h2>\n      <h3><em>SFS1\
  \ #6-12: Yesteryear’s Hope</em></h3>\n      <p>Hello, I’m Hilary Moon Murphy, also\
  \ known as Hmm. I wrote <em>Starfinder Scenario #6-12: Yesteryear’s Hope</em>, a\
  \ whimsical and hope-filled repeatable adventure that can be summed up as a party\
  \ on a bug planet. It takes the Starfinders back to Elytrio, home of two very thought-provoking\
  \ early scenarios by Jason Keeley (<em>#1-03 Yesteryear’s Truth</em> and #<em>1-21\
  \ Yesteryear’s Sorrow</em>).</p>\n      <p>There are so many things to mention about\
  \ this scenario. I had a chance to return to the delightful ghibrani and give them\
  \ a brighter future, while showing Elytrio in all its radiation-blasted glory. Fans\
  \ of the earlier scenarios will find many callbacks to the earlier storyline.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Shortly after getting the scenario assignment, my dear friend, Jack Brown,\
  \ died. I made a request to my developer, Jessica Catalan. Could I write Jack’s\
  \ favorite PC, Lucius, into <em>Yesteryear’s Hope</em> as a special tribute? She\
  \ said yes (with the approval of Jack’s family). The scenario is dedicated to his\
  \ memory. In writing this story, I felt that I had come full circle. <em>Yesteryear’\
  s Truth</em> was the first Starfinder Scenario that I GMed, and Jack and I had prepped\
  \ it together for GenCon, learning the starship combat system as we did. I think\
  \ Jack would be very happy to see Lucius returning to the planet where his career\
  \ had gotten its start.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \     <h3><em>SFS1 #6-16: Dawning Fate</em></h3>\n      <p>Hi folks! I’m Linda Zayas-Palmer\
  \ (she/her), former development manager for the Organized Play team and current\
  \ full-time freelancer. I was delighted to have the opportunity to write <em>Starfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #6-16: Dawning Fate</em>, the epic finale to the machinations\
  \ of the villainous Order of Dawning Fate. Jessica Catalan and the authors of previous\
  \ scenarios stretching all the way back to the Order’s first appearance in <em>Starfinder\
  \ Society Special #3-00: The Last Bite</em> gave me plenty to work with. Storming\
  \ the stronghold of an organization that has been reading and twisting fate for\
  \ over a century is no easy task, but the Starfinder Society isn’t going to back\
  \ down. To avoid spoilers, my favorite parts of the adventure are the lasers and\
  \ the timey-wimey stuff. I’m excited to see what people think!</p>\n      <p>You\
  \ can find me on my twitch stream Arcane Mark [link] twitch.tv/arcanemark [/link]\
  \ on Tuesdays at 8pm Eastern and Saturdays at 1pm eastern, and on the Arcane Mark\

  \      <p>‘Way! Hello! I’m Sara Jeffers (she/they), and I’m the author of <em>Starfinder\
  \ Bounty #10: Those Who Were Taken</em>. I really enjoyed pulling inspiration from\
  \ personal experiences and cultural influences to create a banal evil, a thoroughly\
  \ unremarkable force that can permeate quietly—something that has directly impacted\
  \ my lives and the lives of my family. It was freeing to channel that, and now I\
  \ can repeatably defeat it in a variety of exciting ways! The anacites are one of\
  \ my favorites in the whole game because the idea of self-modification to become\
  \ who you truly are and need to be is something I feel to my core. The idea that\
  \ each individual is not only allowed to but is celebrated for their uniqueness\
  \ is something I staunchly and stubbornly support. You can catch me on Twitter @BabaYagaQuest,\
  \ Discord @babayagacreative, and on Twitch with Enchanted Sorcery Productions in\
