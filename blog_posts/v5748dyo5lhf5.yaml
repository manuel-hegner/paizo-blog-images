  \ <p class=\"date\">Friday, May 1, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\">\
  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're now a little over a month away from the\
  \ release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set of\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic figures,\
  \ and I'm getting very excited! I can see the set clearly on the horizon, so today\
  \ let's talk about some of the \"clear\" figures in the set!</p> \n    <p>Clear\
  \ plastic is one of my very favorite \"tricks\" WizKids pulls to make our figures\
  \ look incredible. From the elementals and incorporeal undead of past sets to a\
  \ few knock-outs from <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>,\
  \ these figures always seem to deliver something special.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Ochre Jelly, one of the deadliest oozes\
  \ in the \n     <link>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. You definitely don't want to get\
  \ enveloped by one of these acidic bastards, that's for sure. The Ochre Jelly is\
  \ a Large, uncommon figure, making it the first Large ooze we've yet created for\
  \ the line. Best of all, the clear plastic of the Ochre Jelly allows us to take\
  \ a peek at what he's been eating, as you can clearly see skeletal remains floating\
  \ around inside him. Or it. I dunno how to sex a jelly.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Daughter of Urgathoa appears on page 309 of the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea World Guide</em></a>\
  \ hardcover. Clocking in at an imposing CR 8, the Daughter of Urgathoa are monstrous\
  \ undead creatures \"promoted\" from Urgathoa's wickedest priestesses at the moment\
  \ of their death. As the book says, \"Even after their transformation into things\
  \ of pestilence and dead flesh, Daughters of Urgathoa remain social beings who typically\
  \ surround themselves with fanatical cults.\" We've already supplied lots of cultists\
  \ (notably in <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><em>The Lost Coast</em></a>), so we\
  \ thought it high time to add something worth idolizing to the line. The Daughter's\
  \ diaphanous dress is a chilling blue clear plastic fading up into a dark black\
  \ skirt. It looks gorgeous.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150501-Punk.jpg\"><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150501-Punk_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, step right up and meet the Pickled\
  \ Punk, a disgusting little creature straight from the pages of <a href=\"/products/btpy91ds\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</em></a>! You may not have realized that you need\
  \ a \"deformed, often humanoid fetus raised by necromancers and stored in jars of\
  \ embalming fluid\" until now, but once you get a look at this adorable little rascal,\
  \ you'll want to adopt him into your campaigns with no time to lose. Although the\
  \ Pickled Punk is quite small relative to the other figures in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"\
  ><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set (and especially when compared to the other figures\
  \ in this week's preview), he is exceptionally gross, and rewards you with some\
  \ new discovery each time you look at him (not unlike an adorable child). The contours\
  \ of his skin folds mix with expert inking to create a hideous skin texture I really\
  \ think you will enjoy. Here's looking at you, kid! The Pickled Punk is a Small,\
  \ rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week. Be sure to check back next\
  \ week for an early look at three more figures from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"\
  ><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set!</p> \n    <p>In the meantime, please swing by my\
  \ <a href=\"http://thegauntlet2015.causevox.com/erik-mona\" target=\"_blank\">donation\
  \ page</a> for Paizo's team in this year's \"The Gauntlet\" Seattle area game company\
  \ charity tournament. This year we're raising money for Hopelink, a great charity\
  \ that helps homeless families, and your support will help the Paizo team get the\
  \ edge it needs to retain the Gauntlet trophy, which we won last year. I've added\
  \ some fun personal \"thank-you\" rewards to folks who participate, so if you're\
  \ in a giving mood, please swing by the link and help us out if you can!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Thanks, and we'll see you next week!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
