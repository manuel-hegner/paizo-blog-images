  \ weird time for us, as we alternate between manic, panicked productivity and post-Gen\
  \ Con recovery. As a result, sometimes we get so wrapped up in our projects that\
  \ we forget to tell you what it is we're even working on! Such was the case with\
  \ Elaine Cunningham's new Pathfinder Tales novel, <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8ddr\"\
  >Winter Witch</a></i>, which after a long run-up finally shipped to the printer\
  \ two weeks ago! </p> \n   <p>While I won't spoil the plot, (which you can <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy8ddr\">check out here</a>), <i>Winter Witch</i> is primarily the\
  \ story of two characters: Ellasif, a shield maiden from the Lands of the Linnorm\
  \ Kings who's determined to rescue her little sister from the witches of Irrisen,\
  \ and Declan, a young Korvosan wizard-turned-mapmaker who gets drawn to Irrisen's\
  \ capital of Whitethrone when the girl he's infatuated with gets kidnapped by weird\
  \ ice magic. Together with the help of a Varisian caravan, gruff Ulfen barbarians,\
  \ and a plucky pseudodragon named Skywing, the two make their way across hundreds\
  \ of miles of dangerous landscape in order to infiltrate the witches' stronghold.\
  \ Yet it quickly turns out that nothing about their quest is as simple as it appears...</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Speaking as the editor, this book is a lot of fun. Though I adore Dave's\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/v5748btpy8g3n\"><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a> and the\
  \ gritty, noir-ish feel Radovan and Jeggare brought to Ustalav, I was glad that\
  \ this book presented a very different voice. In my opinion, <i>Winter Witch</i>\
  \ has more of a traditional epic fantasy flavor, with a solid dose of Slavic fairy\
  \ tale thrown in there. I think people will enjoy the characters a lot, and particularly\
  \ Skywing—it's hard to resist falling for a tiny, overconfident dragon.</p> \n \
  \  <p>And since the subject of <i>Prince of Wolves</i> came up, I think it's high\
  \ time to reveal a closely guarded secret: <i>Elaine wasn't working alone.</i> It's\
  \ true! Though the book was originally solicited as being by Elaine, back when she\
  \ created the characters and outlined the plot, as the writing went on—and as she\
  \ saw her old friend Dave's excellent work on <i>Prince of Wolves</i>—she decided\
  \ to bring him in on the project as well, turning it into a collaboration. Given\
  \ how happy we were with <i>Prince of Wolves</i>, the idea of having <i>two</i>\
  \ awesome authors on the book sounded fine to us, and together Dave and Elaine wrote\
  \ what I think is going to be an instant fan favorite.</p> \n   <p>This post also\
  \ wouldn't be complete without mentioning that in <i>Winter Witch</i>, and in each\
  \ Pathfinder Tales book going forward, there's also going to be an excellent new\
  \ map at the front of the book, detailing the areas where most of the action takes\
  \ place. For <i>Winter Witch</i>, that map was hand-drawn by our own Crystal Frasier,\
  \ and it looks marvelous!</p> \n   <p><i>Winter Witch</i> should be available in\
  \ November in time for the holidays, and I sincerely hope you all enjoy it as much\
  \ as I have. Elaine and Dave have done a bang-up job, and I can't wait to see what\
  \ they do next!</p>\n   <p> <br clear=\"all\"> </p>\n   <p>James L. Sutter <br>Fiction\
