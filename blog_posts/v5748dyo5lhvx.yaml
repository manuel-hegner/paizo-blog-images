  \ by Dmitry Burmak</i>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As many of\
  \ you are probably well aware, we have had a number of update documents drop in\
  \ the past few weeks, correcting a wide array of issues with some of our rulebooks.\
  \ Seeing that some of these have caused some controversy among players and GMs alike,\
  \ I thought I would take a moment to talk about the process of creating these documents\
  \ and give you all some insight on how we decide on the changes made to the game.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>No book is perfect. It's an unfortunate reality of the publishing industry.\
  \ Despite all of our best efforts and countless hours spent poring over proof copies\
  \ and making corrections, every time we send a book to the printer, it is with the\
  \ nagging knowledge that there are at least a few mistakes lurking in its pages.\
  \ Almost without fail, we spot one within a week of getting the first printed copies\
  \ shipped to our office, well after it is possible for us to fix it. At this point,\
  \ the first internal correction file is made. As the staff here at Paizo starts\
  \ using the book, we usually find a few more, and the file grows. Then the book\
  \ ships out to the public and the questions begin in earnest.</p> \n    <p>After\
  \ that point, we primarily rely on the FAQ system and forum threads to point out\
  \ errors in our books that need to be addressed. When people on the forums notice\
  \ problems, post threads, and click the FAQ button, we get notified through our\
  \ system. About once per week we take a look at some of the most pressing issues,\
  \ answering them as needed and noting many of them in our corrections file.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Finally, when it comes time for us to actually assemble the updates document\
  \ that you see for each printing of our books, we get together as a team to discuss\
  \ each issue. While many of the problems are straightforward mistakes that are easy\
  \ to fix, some require us to rework a rule or make an adjudication on how it actually\
  \ works in play. These can be contentious issues, both on the forums and internally,\
  \ but we are always trying to do what is in the best interest of the game. Which\
  \ brings me around to the most recent update document that is releasing today, making\
  \ more corrections to <a href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\"><em>Ultimate Combat</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And the Crane Wing feat.</p> \n    <p>Many of you might remember the\
  \ conflict over this feat when <em>Ultimate Combat</em> was first released. We felt\
  \ it was just too good for a heavily defensive build, so when the second printing\
  \ of the book was released, we made changes to bring it more inline. Some people\
  \ on the forums let us know that they felt we went too far in \"nerfing\" the feat\
  \ and at the time, we said that we would keep an eye on it and see if it required\
  \ further adjustment.</p> \n    <p>As it turns out, the feat did need some work,\
  \ so we changed it so that it provides a +4 bonus to AC until you are missed by\
  \ 4 or less (at which point it turns off until the start of your next turn). You\
  \ can still use it to deflect an attack when taking the total defense action. This\
  \ is an improvement and one that we hope makes the feat a more viable choice.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, this is only one of a number of changes we made to various\
  \ rules in <em>Ultimate Combat</em>. There were changes to the Musket Master and\
  \ Pistolero archetypes, removing an ability that allowed them to ignore misfires\
  \ at 13th level and double-barreled guns saw a change to balance them as well. The\
  \ Myrmidarch and Titan Mauler both saw changes that strengthened them, allowing\
  \ them to work better as originally intended, while the Master of Many Styles was\
  \ altered a bit to make it more rewarding to those that stuck with it, as opposed\
  \ to just dipping into the class for quick benefits. You can download the appropriate\
  \ update document below, or from the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/resources\">Free Downloads</a>\
  \ or <a href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\">product page</a>.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\

  \ \n    <p>The process of updating our books is never simple and it is a job we\
  \ take very seriously. We know that many of you are invested in these rules and\
  \ the characters that rely upon them. Hopefully this gives you a little bit of a\
  \ better understanding about the process of updates. If you have any thoughts or\
  \ comments about the most recent <a href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\"><em>Ultimate Combat\
  \ update</em></a>, please post them in this thread (as opposed to making a bunch\
  \ of individual threads) and we will try to answer your questions.</p> \n    <p>Jason\
