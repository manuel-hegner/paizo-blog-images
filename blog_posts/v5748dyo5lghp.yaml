  \ <p class=\"date\">by Stephanie Lorée</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: No Love Like Gold</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Sunlight\
  \ dripped from a tiny window into her cell. Brea lay on her doublet atop the cold\
  \ ground and tried to remember how many days had passed. Four? Seven? A dozen or\
  \ more? She had seen no one, heard only the moans of distant neighbors, and received\
  \ no nourishment of any kind. The dungeons of Deagan's Hold were not a place to\
  \ keep prisoners for questioning or before a trial, but a place to forget they had\
  \ ever existed.</span></p> \n    <p>The brigand's face flashed in Brea's mind. His\
  \ words that the dungeon offered a death worse than a sword lingered in her ears.\
  \ His hollow cheeks lifted in laughter, his sunken eyes watching over her. She could\
  \ not shake his image nor the inescapable knowledge that without food or water,\
  \ she would lose her mind shortly before she died.</p> \n    <p>But Brea had taken\
  \ precautions. Months in encampments with limited supplies had taught her how to\
  \ survive. And in his arrogance, Deagan had left her fully armored. Her cuirass\
  \ lay against the wall of her cell, its curve deep enough to catch a dribble of\
  \ water that snaked down the stone. Those few drops of moisture had kept her alive,\
  \ hoping that an opportunity to escape might present itself. She'd stayed quiet\
  \ and calm, tried to conserve as much energy as possible, but another sunset slipped\
  \ below the window and nothing changed.</p> \n    <p>Hope became a fleeting, foolish\
  \ memory. Like love.</p> \n    <p>Footsteps echoed down the corridor. Brea lifted\
  \ her head as torchlight flickered along the dank dungeon walls. The light grew\
  \ closer, and she squinted. The resounding steps stopped in front of her cell.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It's me, Captain,\" Etrim whispered and settled her torch in a nearby\
  \ sconce.</p> \n    <p>Brea pushed herself to her feet. She wobbled, but steadied\
  \ herself against the wall.</p> \n    <p>\"I brought food and water, sir,\" Etrim\
  \ said and shoved a hunk of bread through the barred window of the door. \"And keys,\
  \ most importantly, I have the gaoler's keys.\"</p> \n    <p>Brea considered it\
  \ might be a trap. Etrim might have been the traitor in her own ranks, reporting\
  \ to Deagan on her plan to stage a coup. But the lure of food and water made Brea’\
  s stomach grumble in protest to her thoughts, and she accepted the bread.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"How's that?\" she asked. The bread made her mouth water with what little\
  \ moisture remained in her body. She took a tentative bite, chewed, and tore into\
  \ the rest with all the ferocity of a starving animal.</p> \n    <p>Etrim fumbled\
  \ with the keys, testing each one on the heavy gaoler's loop, and cursing under\
  \ her breath as each failed to turn the lock. \"Things have been bad, Captain, ever\
  \ since Lieutenant...\"</p> \n    <p>Her words died as she peered through the small\
  \ window, meeting Brea's eyes. Farnick was truly dead then. Her old friend, hanged\
  \ by her lover. The bread turned heavy in her stomach.</p> \n    <p>\"The squadron,\"\
  \ Etrim continued, \"it's mutiny, sir. The lieutenant's death was a clear violation\
  \ of our contract. No trial. Not even the slightest evidence. There.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>The lock clicked. She pulled the door open with a creak, and Brea stumbled\
  \ out.</p> \n    <p>\"Let me, sir.\" Etrim slung Brea's arm over her shoulder and\
  \ grabbed her torch.</p> \n    <p>\"Thank you.\"</p> \n    <p>Etrim managed to smile\
  \ the same overeager grin she'd always had. Only now, in this wretched place, Brea\
  \ found it comforting.</p> \n    <p>\"So who planned my rescue?\" Brea asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Etrim blushed. \"I couldn't let you rot down here, Captain.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Brea squeezed the younger woman's shoulder as Etrim led them up and into\
  \ Deagan's keep.</p> \n    <p>The great hall, which normally bustled with servants,\
  \ sat empty save for the Blackjackets guarding the doors. They straightened as they\
  \ saw Brea and saluted.</p> \n    <p>\"Sir,\" one of them said, \"Lord Callimedes\
  \ has barricaded himself in his office with his personal guard.\"</p> \n    <p>Etrim\
  \ helped Brea into a chair at a long, wooden table. A meager plate of jerky and\
  \ parsnips was laid before her.</p> \n    <p>\"How many?\" Brea asked and reached\
  \ for Etrim's waterskin.</p> \n    <p>\"Four or five.\"</p> \n    <p>She nodded,\
  \ nibbling on a bit of jerky. \"And how many have taken arms against our lord?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The man shrugged. \"Maybe twice that. Most are staying out of it,\
  \ sticking to the barracks or taverns until they see who wins.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No doubt Deagan has sought outside help. He must realize he can't quell his soldiers\
  \ on his own,\" she said.</p> \n    <p>\"We've stopped any messengers from coming\
  \ or going, sir.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Armored-Etrim.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br> Etrim's steafast loyalty outweighs her inexperience.\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Brea considered as she finished her first meal in so many days. \"He'll\
  \ find a way, if he hasn't already. I need to deal with him quickly.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>She struggled to stand, and Etrim helped her to her feet.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Captain,\" Etrim started, but didn't need to finish.</p> \n    <p>Brea knew she\
  \ was too weak to face him. And perhaps she had always been, too weak and blinded\
  \ by feelings she should never have possessed. None of that mattered now. She would\
  \ finish this.</p> \n    <p>Something in her eyes must have told Etrim that her\
  \ Captain would not back down today, for the young trooper nodded and said, \"I'll\
  \ get your sword and armor, sir.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Brea said. \"Leave the armor\
  \ in the dungeon where it belongs. My sword will be enough. I will no longer bear\
  \ the blackjacket.\"</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The climb up the stairs to Deagan's office was longer and more arduous than\
  \ Brea remembered, even lacking the weight of her armor. Her legs ached nearly as\
  \ much as her heart.</p> \n    <p>Etrim and two other Blackjackets flanked her.\
  \ They carried a portable battering ram, but Brea paused outside the double-doors\
  \ to knock. It seemed ridiculous, to announce herself before breaking in, but she\
  \ wanted to hear what her former lord had to say.</p> \n    <p>\"Deagan,\" she called.\
  \ \"Open the doors and surrender. Your troops might yet spare you.\"</p> \n    <p>Silence\
  \ greeted her.</p> \n    <p>She sighed and nodded to her soldiers. \"Break it down.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The slam of the ram pounded in time with her heart. Whatever affection\
  \ she had for Deagan had died with Farnick and rotted in that cell, but there was\
  \ a sadness there, a remorse over losing the possibility of something better. When\
  \ the doors finally gave way, the tearing of timber became the scream Brea could\
  \ not herself release.</p> \n    <p>She stepped over the threshold. Deagan stood\
  \ with his back to the window from which he'd watched Farnick swing. Four Blackjackets\
  \ formed a semicircle in front of him, their swords drawn. Among them stood Soltez,\
  \ sword in hand despite his injury. </p> \n    <p>Brea frowned. She wondered if\
  \ his injury had been staged, purposeful so he might scout ahead and lead them to\
  \ the hobgoblin trap instead of remaining among her ranks.</p> \n    <p>\"It's over,\"\
  \ she said. \"Don't risk your lives for a lord who has used your brothers like fodder\
  \ for a few coins. Lay down your weapons.\"</p> \n    <p>She approached warily,\
  \ her sword held before her. The men guarding Deagan hesitated a fraction at her\
  \ words. Their posture turned unsure.</p> \n    <p>For his part, Prophet Deagan\
  \ Callimedes looked regal in his white robes and jewels. He also appeared shocked\
  \ and scared. In all their time together, Brea had never seen him lose his composure.\
  \ Now he seemed an arrogant child, unwilling to admit defeat.</p> \n    <p>\"Kill\
  \ her,\" he ordered his men. Their hesitation disappeared, and they charged.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Brea moved faster without the weight of her armor, but she was also exposed\
  \ and weary from her time in the dungeon. She sidestepped the blow and twisted awkwardly\
  \ to dodge another. She caught sight of Etrim and the others who’d accompanied her\
  \ from the corner of her eye. They danced with their own opponents.</p> \n    <p>Brea\
  \ lifted her sword to parry as Soltez advanced on her. The block was well timed,\
  \ and the clash of steel rang down her arms. She didn't want to kill him, this brother\
  \ who’d abandoned her to remain loyal to his lord. Her reservations and weakened\
  \ state would cost her, she knew. </p> \n    <p>As she spun to avoid another thrust\
  \ and place herself behind Soltez, pain flared hot and violent across her hip. He’\
  d caught her, but it was shallow enough for her to ignore. She brought the pommel\
  \ of her sword down on the back of his head.</p> \n    <p>Soltez staggered.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>“Don’t do this,” she said.</p> \n    <p>The scout turned to face her,\
  \ too slow by half. He swung his sword awkwardly, and Brea easily parried it.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>“Our lord has betrayed us,” she said. She kept a low guard, waiting for\
  \ the inexperienced soldier to make his decision.</p> \n    <p>“You’re the traitor.”\
  \ Soltez’s words were slurred. He touched the back of his head with one hand as\
  \ if to slow the dizziness her blow had delivered him. “The High Prophet will come,\
  \ and he will reward my loyalty.”</p> \n    <p> Brea sighed. She almost admired\
  \ his devotion. Years ago, she had been just like him, fanatical in her loyalty\
  \ to the Kalistocrats. But war and sacrifice, love and betrayal had changed her.\
  \ The Prophets were but men and women, nestled atop their piles of gold, sending\
  \ their soldiers to die for scraps of power. They hid their bloodstained hands inside\
  \ white gloves. Soltez was now part of their machinations, and his actions had caused\
  \ her friend’s execution.</p> \n    <p>Soltez lunged at her. She stepped away with\
  \ ease and drove her blade cleanly through the gap between his armor and lagging\
  \ sword arm. It was precise, deep, and killed him instantly.</p> \n    <p>“I’m sorry,\
  \ brother,” she said as he crumpled to the floor.</p> \n    <p>The other Blackjackets\
  \ were occupied among themselves. She scanned the room for Deagan.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ would not have noticed him if it wasn't for the flash of golden embroidery trailing\
  \ from under his desk. The hem of his robe peeked at her, beckoning her.</p> \n\
  \    <p>She marched around the desk and lifted his cowering form by his bejeweled\
  \ lapels.</p> \n    <p>\"Coward,\" she said, dragging him to face her.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>He squirmed and tried to push her away. His hands were familiar, almost comforting,\
  \ but his eyes shone with a cold fury.</p> \n    <p>\"I am your lord,\" he said.\
  \ \"You can’t do this.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You lost that title when you murdered my\
  \ friend.\" She shoved him against the wall. The tapestry of the Prophecies draped\
  \ overhead.</p> \n    <p>\"You should have hanged me. If you couldn’t love me, you\
  \ should have let me go,\" she said. “Instead you killed an innocent man. A good\
  \ man.”</p> \n    <p>Something in his eyes softened. The sounds of battle around\
  \ them melted. Deagan smiled, a small laugh escaping his lips.</p> \n    <p>\"I\
  \ did,\" he said. “For you. Had you but left then instead of attacking your lord...”\
  </p> \n    <p>His voice drew her closer, the pain in his expression weakening her\
  \ further. She could barely lift her longsword, and her muscles quivered with exhaustion.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I loved you despite everything.\" He reached for her face.</p> \n \
  \   <p>A white-gloved hand cupped her cheek. She let herself fall into it, close\
  \ her eyes, and sigh. In that moment, she realized he was telling to truth.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Brea turned her grip and thrust her longsword up through her lord's body.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I loved Farnick like a brother,\" she said, watching his eyes widen\
  \ in shock then empty of life. She followed him to the floor, slumping next to him\
  \ and laying her head against his shoulder. His freehand released the dagger he'd\
  \ palmed, and she watched it splatter into the pool of blood gathering around them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Her hip throbbed. Her head swam from blood loss and exhaustion. But she\
  \ could no more lie down and die now than she could've in her cell. She would survive.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Captain?\" Etrim stood over her, her hand extended in offering.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Brea grasped the young warrior’s bloodstained hand and staggered to her\
  \ feet.</p> \n    <p>\"No longer,\" Brea said. \"I need to leave.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I don't understand, sir?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Take what you can from his holdings and\
  \ distribute it among our soldiers. Other Kalistocrats and their Blackjackets will\
  \ arrive soon, and they'll claim whatever remains.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Where will you\
  \ go?\" Etrim asked.</p> \n    <p>\"I am a traitor. They’ll hunt me across Druma,\
  \ and you will let them,\" she said, meeting Etrim’s gaze.</p> \n    <p>Hope glimmered\
  \ in the young woman’s eyes. She recognized it from her own reflection, before Deagan,\
  \ before the Goblinblood Wars.</p> \n    <p>\"For all of this,” she said, her voice\
  \ almost a whisper, “I am to blame. I’ll run until they find me, or I become too\
  \ expensive to chase.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I could go with you.\"</p> \n    <p>Brea\
  \ smiled and shook her head. \"I need you here, Etrim, to set things right. You're\
  \ a fine trooper, and you'll make a fine Captain.\"</p> \n    <p>Even smeared in\
  \ the blood of her fellow soldiers, Etrim's armor seemed clean. There were no golden\
  \ etchings in the black, no magic from a lord to sully it. She wore her blackjacket\
  \ with pride, and Brea hoped she would always keep her body armored, as well as\
  \ her heart.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Coming Soon:</b> An unexpected\
