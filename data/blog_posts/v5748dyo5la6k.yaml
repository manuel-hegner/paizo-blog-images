  \    <h1>The Sandpoint Devil</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, June 13, 2007</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The real world is a great resource for monsters. Many of the game's critters\
  \ come from real-world myth and legend, but one venue that seems to have been largely\
  \ ignored are cryptozoological accounts. I'm talking about Bigfoot and the Loch\
  \ Ness Monster, of course, but also about more obscure creatures like the hodag,\
  \ Mokele-Mbembe, and the Yowie. And, of course, the Jersey Devil, the inspiration\
  \ for one of <i>Pathfinder's</i> first new monsters. Rumors and legends of a rarely\
  \ seen but terrible monster have preyed upon the fears of Sandpoint's populace for\
  \ decades. The rumors listed below comprise the most common—though oft-conflicting—\
  tales regarding the famed Sandpoint devil.</p> \n    <p><b>Bad Omen:</b> It's bad\
  \ luck to see the Sandpoint devil. Any who do are cursed to suffer an ill fate.\
  \ Before tragedies, murders, and shipwrecks, it's said the devil flies unseen by\
  \ all but the doomed through the night sky.</p> \n    <p><b>Devil-Spawned: </b>The\
  \ Sandpoint devil is the son of a widow named Agatha Leeds, a woman who used to\
  \ live north of town and was said to practice dark magics and consort with evil\
  \ beings. When she wandered into town round with child, she ignored all questions\
  \ about her pregnancy. Weeks later, her home was found reduced to cinders with its\
  \ mysterious owner missing. It wasn't long thereafter that the first sightings of\
  \ the Sandpoint devil began.</p> \n    <p><b>Disappearances: </b>Evidence of Sandpoint\
  \ devil sightings often disappears before it can be examined. Tracks, bitten animals,\
  \ weapons dripping with its blood, and similar such evidence simply vanish, no matter\
  \ how well watched or guarded. In fact, even those who have sought to catch or kill\
  \ the Sandpoint devil have disappeared without a trace, both during their hunts\
  \ and in the weeks after returning home from a failed attempt.</p> \n    <p><b>Fire\
  \ Starter: </b>Paintings and reports of the Sandpoint devil mysteriously catch on\
  \ fire, sometimes burning entire homes to the ground.</p> \n    <p><b>Immortal Protector:\
  \ </b>Some Varisians claim they Sandpoint devil has lived along the Lost Coast for\
  \ thousands of years, and that it protects the coast's resources from those who\
  \ seek to exploit the land. Its modern misdeeds are merely its way of fending off\
  \ the most recent encroachment of civilization.</p> \n    <p><b>One of Many: </b>The\
  \ Sandpoint devil is sometimes seen in the company of other local legends and spooks,\
  \ most commonly a white stag, the ghost of a young girl, and a zombie with missing\
  \ feet.</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs <br>Editor-in-Chief, <i>Pathfinder</i></p> \n\
