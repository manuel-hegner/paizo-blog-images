  \ – James Jacobs (Part 1)</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 9, 2009</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As part of the ongoing series about Paizo's own Appendix N, I had the\
  \ opportunity to interview the editor-in-chief of <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i>,\
  \ James Jacobs, about the books and movies that most inspire his own writing. He\
  \ proved very generous with his time and gave me quite a detailed look into his\
  \ plan of a \"shared mythology\" for Pathfinder and the sources that inspired its\
  \ creation. Once again, the interview proved long enough that I have had to break\
  \ it into two parts. In this first part, James discusses his literary influences.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>David</b>: Although I know you're a huge fan of movies, and horror\
  \ films in particular, let's discuss books first. Which authors or works have stuck\
  \ the longest in your mind?</p> \n    <p><b>James</b>: H. P. Lovecraft was definitely\
  \ the biggest inspiration. He's my favorite author, and not just mine: Stephen King,\
  \ Robert Bloch, Gary Gygax, and others expanded on the themes that he created. Lovecraft\
  \ didn't want to write about vampires or other classic creatures of horror, as these\
  \ had become cliché at the time when he was writing, so he created his own pantheon\
  \ of cosmically horrific, god-like beings. He was particularly successful because\
  \ he encouraged other authors to use the names he had used. Robert Bloch, Fritz\
  \ Leiber, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard, and Henry Kuttner were all contemporaries\
  \ of Lovecraft who communicated with him and were influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos\
  \ that he created. He also pieced together another pantheon of creatures throughout\
  \ the works of authors for whom he was a ghostwriter, which expanded the Mythos.\
  \ So his influence is pretty far-reaching.</p> \n    <p>This is very much like what's\
  \ going on with the OGL—here are the base concepts of D&amp;D, and other writers\
  \ or companies can build and share a single mythology. This is what happened with\
  \ Lovecraft—his themes of cosmic horror influenced the likes of Stephen King; this\
  \ was the horror of the ordinary, in which libraries and shacks in the woods could\
  \ become places of terror. Horror is the main source of my inspiration, and why\
  \ grisly things are going on in <i>Pathfinder</i>. I like to find authors who can\
  \ carry on this vision—Nic Logue and Richard Pett being two great examples.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Clive Barker is another big inspiration. My grandma and grandpa introduced\
  \ me to old horror novels and comics when I was young. I remember reading my grandpa's\
  \ <i>Vault of the Unknown</i>, <i>Tales of the Unexpected</i>, <i>House of Mysteries</i>,\
  \ and <i>Beware!</i> My grandma would shove Clive Barker or Stephen King into my\
  \ hands and tell me, \"Read this! You'll enjoy it!\" Zon-Kuthon is the most obvious\
  \ example of Barker's influence on Pathfinder, as he is basically a Cenobite from\
  \ <i>Hellraiser</i>. As Barker's stories mellowed out and became less gory, they\
  \ took on a more magical, fantastical tone. In fact, his novel <i>Weaveworld</i>\
  \ served as a primary inspiration for the demiplane of Kakishon in <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy85jn\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #22, \"The Edge of Eternity.\"</a></p>\
  \ \n    <p>It appears that this post has already exceeded the length I was aiming\
  \ for; the rest of the interview, it seems, must wait for later. In the second installment,\
  \ James rounds out his discussion of his favorite authors, discusses the fine line\
  \ between homage and pastiche, and talks about the movies that most influenced his\
  \ style of game design.</p> \n    <p><i>\"In space no one can hear you scream.\"\
  </i></p> \n    <p>David Eitelbach<br> Editorial Intern</p> \n   </blockquote> <!--\
