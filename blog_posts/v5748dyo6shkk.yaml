  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As we close in on the completion\
  \ of our campaign, we can't thank those who have already backed the Adventurer’\
  s Curated Dice Collection enough and encourage those that are on the fence to grab\
  \ these for when we (sooner than later) get back to gaming in person! </p> \n  \
  \   <p>We have a stream this Friday (2/12) from 4:15 PM - 6 PM Eastern on our Twitch\
  \ (<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/levelup_ttv\" target=\"_blank\">twitch.tv/levelup_ttv</a>)\
  \ where Shawn, our Corporate Manager and one of the leads on this project, will\
  \ be building out characters from all sorts of systems to show you how to build\
  \ your character's dice set! </p> \n     <p>We wanted to also announce that for\
  \ our final days we will be unlocking ALL color combinations and five more spell\
  \ glyphic designs we had yet to unlock! We couldn't bring ourselves to keep them\
  \ from you as you're all near and dear to us as our first group of backers and hope\
  \ you'll follow us in our journey forward. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ have a huge announcement or three coming soon but let's focus on what we have\
  \ at hand. At the completion of the campaign we must wait 14 days before the Backerkit\
  \ can be opened to you. As soon as we can, we will have that available to you and\
  \ we will be closing it 14 days after opening it. There is a possibility of extending\
  \ if we have a significant number of backers that have yet to pledge, but we are\
  \ trying to turn this around as fast as possible and are simply waiting for the\
  \ orders to be processed to get started. Hopefully, all of this preparation amounts\
  \ to everybody getting their dice much earlier than expected, but let's temper our\
  \ expectations just in case of, you know, another worldwide pandemic or something\
  \ happening. </p> \n     <p>We hope you have the best of times until we can all\
  \ get together again at conventions and the like!</p> \n     <p>Adventurers Curated\
  \ Dice Collection could be yours by clicking the link: <a href=\"http://ow.ly/Qmap50D5YVz\"\
