  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Zellara sat at the table\
  \ in her small house, her Harrow deck centered on the red tablecloth. The lantern\
  \ light cloaked as much as it illuminated, leaving deep shadows to gather in the\
  \ corners of the room, in the spaces behind furniture and under cupboards.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Fatigue made her eyelids heavy and blurred her thoughts. Zellara knew she\
  \ should go into a Harrow reading well rested. She likewise knew that rest would\
  \ not come. Ever since Eran died, sleep eluded her. The toll of daily living—waking,\
  \ eating, breathing—exhausted her. Her work tracking down her son’s killer added\
  \ to the burden.</p> \n     <p>She passed a hand over the deck. Today had been spent\
  \ at the local guardhouse, presenting her case to an indifferent Korvosan captain.\
  \ She laid out her evidence like it was a Harrow spread, setting each piece in its\
  \ place to show the pattern. His eyes remained closed, and this latest defeat on\
  \ top of a year of defeats wearied Zellara further.</p> \n     <p>She picked up\
  \ the deck and shuffled. The cards felt strange, as if she were a novice again,\
  \ training at her grandmother’s knee. She shuffled until she felt an energy awaken\
  \ in her fingertips.</p> \n     <p>There were many spreads available to her. The\
  \ Tapestry, showing the nuances and influences in past, present, and future. The\
  \ Bridge, providing guidance and insight toward her chosen plan—if she had one.\
  \ But her meeting today had been the last resort. All doors seemed closed to her\
  \ now. All avenues exhausted.</p> \n     <p>The past would not help her. She needed\
  \ to look to the future. To leap ahead into the unknown.</p> \n     <p>Zellara set\
  \ the deck back on the red tablecloth and drew the first card.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ by Mark Molnar.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>She had learned long ago to respect\
  \ the cards, not fear them. All the same, she recoiled at the image of the bound\
  \ man hanging above a bubbling cauldron. The Waxworks. A card of great distress,\
  \ of helplessness and torment.</p> \n     <p>Was the man in the image hanging helplessly?\
  \ Did unseen hands lower him into the wax? Or was he on the verge of escape? Zellara\
  \ instinctively found an interpretation.</p> \n     <p>At the most basic level,\
  \ this card represented her life. She was the one in torment, suffering every day\
  \ as she hunted her son’s killer. Every night when she closed her eyes, the last\
  \ image she saw before sleep was the memory of her son’s severed head and hands.\
  \ A message from his killer.</p> \n     <p>On a deeper level, the Waxworks encompassed\
  \ all the humble streets under Gaedren Lamm’s influence. Zellara’s neighbors struggled\
  \ to get through each day while the petty crime lord wreaked havoc. He stole, extorted,\
  \ and slaughtered his way through the district, and none seemed able to stop him.\
  \ The people were trapped, dangling over the boiling cauldron of Lamm’s evil.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I know this,” Zellara whispered. She knew to be patient during a reading.\
  \ The Waxworks could be necessary to properly interpret the rest of the cards.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She still hadn’t decided what spread she was using. It was dangerous\
  \ to read a Harrow without a clear framework in mind, but caution had taken her\
  \ as far as it could. She was leaving the shore, swimming into deep waters.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Zellara frowned. Water… there was something there. The hanging figure\
  \ above the cauldron looked shadowed in the faint light, dusky of hair and skin\
  \ as Eran had been. Was it wax he descended toward, or murky water?</p> \n     <p>Leaving\
  \ the image of water to linger in her mind, she drew the next card.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ colorful image showed a man with the head of a crow, staring at a table covered\
  \ in wealth. Two masked figures sat to either side. The Crows.</p> \n     <p>Another\
  \ seemingly obvious card. The Crows signified murder and loss, especially of that\
  \ which was loved. Zellara tried to stay patient, but a bubble of frustration rose\
  \ within her. Why were the cards showing her what she already knew? Gaedren Lamm,\
  \ the crime lord who used murder and theft to acquire his wealth. What was she missing?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She went back to the Waxworks. The victim, Eran, descending toward death.\
  \ Wax—or water? The bubbles of boiling wax could be the froth on the waves. Water\
  \ and crows. She’d seen flocks of black-winged scavengers clustering by the docks\
  \ last week. A lead drew her to the water’s edge, a rumor that Lamm worked out of\
  \ a shabby tavern catering to fisherfolk. Zellara’s inquiries turned up no sign\
  \ of the crime lord.</p> \n     <p>As she stepped out of the tavern, she startled\
  \ a flock of crows. They rose from a pile of fish guts and discarded bones, their\
  \ rough cries cutting through the still morning air.</p> \n     <p>“Loss of something\
  \ loved.” Zellara spoke the words aloud, trying to fit them into the pattern. The\
  \ loss of her son, yes, but beyond that? </p> \n     <p>She’d discovered several\
  \ of Lamm’s previous lairs during her investigation. Always too late. Destitute\
  \ businesses or abandoned buildings where Lamm had run his operations and terrorized\
  \ his crew of street urchins. Buildings that had once been the hope of their owners,\
  \ locals who had poured all their money and hard work into their craft. Now sad\
  \ and empty, the gold that should have filled their coffers instead spilling over\
  \ Lamm’s table.</p> \n     <p>Water. The crows at the docks. A place that once held\
  \ industry and hope, now full of broken dreams.</p> \n     <p>Zellara reached for\
  \ the deck, but hesitated. She’d laid the first two cards side by side. Their faces\
  \ showed Eran’s death in the past, her search for Lamm in the present. The pattern\
  \ implied the next card would show the future.</p> \n     <p>The first rule of Harrowing\
  \ was to always spread a branching path. To cast a single future card was not only\
  \ foolish, it was dangerous. It left no recourse for turning aside or following\
  \ a different current of fate. To lay a third card now would be to end the spread\
  \ and commit herself to this path.</p> \n     <p>Perhaps that was the price the\
  \ cards required. To avenge Eran, she would make any sacrifice.</p> \n     <p>Zellara\
  \ turned the third card up. Her eyes widened.</p> \n     <p>A stout woman held a\
  \ screaming devil-child by the leg. Her other hand pointed up, two fingers extended\
  \ and bathed in a blue flame. Behind her, a transparent figure hid his face.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Zellara had not been expecting the Midwife.</p> \n     <p>A disturbing\
  \ card, but also an optimistic one. The Midwife heralded arrivals and indicated\
  \ the discovery of new information. The ghostly figure could be Eran, mourning his\
  \ own fate—or a fate yet to come. Zellara herself was the midwife, channeling her\
  \ discoveries into the world. But who was the child?</p> \n     <p>A new companion,\
  \ perhaps. A stranger instrumental to her quest for vengeance. Possibly a literal\
  \ child. Lamm was well known for using orphans and street children in his organization.\
  \ “Lamm’s Lambs” the locals termed them.</p> \n     <p>Zellara had seen such a child\
  \ not long ago. A starved, sickly-looking imp with a mop of dark hair that reminded\
  \ her of Eran. The boy had offered dock-dumplings for sale, lumpy and smelling of\
  \ fish and decay. Zellara had bought one out of charity and tossed it to a street\
  \ cat on her way home.</p> \n     <p>She traced the image of the child on the card\
  \ with one finger. Water. The docks. The crows feasting on fish guts. A dead business,\
  \ a place of broken dreams. Lamm’s Lambs. A thin child selling dumplings made of\
  \ old fish.</p> \n     <p>A thrill of excitement rippled through Zellara. The Harrowing\
  \ had been a risk, but it had been worth it. She had what she needed.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>She picked up the cards and returned them to the deck, hesitating only for\
  \ a moment over the Midwife. New arrivals. She felt with a Harrower’s instinct that\
  \ a stranger or strangers awaited in her future. Ones with an important role to\
  \ play. She would remain alert for those who could offer aid.</p> \n     <p>Zellara\
  \ wrapped the cards in her kapenia and put them away. She donned her cloak and took\
  \ up her walking stick. It was a dark night, perfect for exploring the docks under\
  \ cover of shadow.</p> \n     <p>The cards had guided her true. Now she took the\
  \ final steps on her path to revenge.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
