  \ to be a good day.</i></p> \n     <p>That’s what Major Ramalakesh remembered telling\
  \ himself this morning while he was putting on his uniform. Now he wasn’t so sure.\
  \ He looked up at the starry sky above Absalom Station’s Eye, squinting in the harsh\
  \ light of the yellow sun, and thought of the relentless hard vacuum beyond the\
  \ thin layer of polycarbon plate. The transparent dome looked so fragile. One crack,\
  \ one tiny hole in that flimsy bubble, and everyone and everything in the Eye would\
  \ die horribly and without honor in a matter of seconds. And the Pact Worlders placed\
  \ their government here, without even a hint of defensive fortifications. Ramalakesh\
  \ couldn’t comprehend it. It made him uneasy.</p> \n     <p>He lowered his gaze\
  \ and tried to not to think about the dome overhead. He had been so excited this\
  \ morning! This was his first day of leave since arriving from the Veskarium a week\
  \ ago, and his first opportunity to really explore Absalom Station. It was what\
  \ he had always dreamed of. This is why he had joined the Imperial Diplomatic Corps.\
  \ This is why he had fought so hard to be assigned to the Veskarium’s diplomatic\
  \ mission to the Pact Worlds. What better place to experience the galaxy’s wealth\
  \ of alien cultures than the very hub of the Pact Worlds?</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>So why did he feel so anxious? Why was he on edge? It\
  \ wasn’t just the bubble, or the days that were four hours shorter than on Vesk\
  \ Prime. It was something more, something unexpected. As Ramalakesh walked among\
  \ the government buildings and gardens of Parkside, he studied the people passing\
  \ by and marveled again at the sheer diversity of alien life all around him. Humans,\
  \ kasathas, lashuntas, barathus, ryphorians, and countless others. There were so\
  \ many of them, speaking so many different languages, it was almost overwhelming.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But why would that unsettle him? Ramalakesh was only a junior attaché\
  \ on his first assignment outside the Veskarium, but this wasn’t his first encounter\
  \ with alien species. The Veskarium was a multicultural society, especially on Vesk\
  \ Prime. He had interacted with ijtikris, pahtras, skittermanders, and even a few\
  \ Pact Worlders—humans and lashuntas, mostly—before, with no problems whatsoever.\
  \ They were always accommodating, almost even subservient at times. They knew their\
  \ role and position in society, just as they recognized his.</p> \n     <p>Slowly,\
  \ it dawned on him what was so different here. Why he felt so uneasy, so out place.\
  \ He was vesk, and back home in the Veskarium he enjoyed an entitlement he had never\
  \ lived without.</p> \n     <p>In the corridors and streets of Absalom Station,\
  \ people still gave him a wide berth, but that was only because of his imposing\
  \ physical presence. Not because he was vesk. There wasn’t the automatic, deferential\
  \ respect he was used to from non-vesk. Instead, there was indifference. The Pact\
  \ Worlders didn’t care that he was vesk. He was surrounded by a multitude of people,\
  \ different species from worlds scattered across the galaxy, and he was just one\
  \ more alien, a single drop of water in a vast galactic ocean. He looked around\
  \ and couldn’t find any other vesk in sight. At home on Vesk Prime, they thronged\
  \ the streets, but here on Absalom Station, vesk were a distinct minority. Ramalakesh\
  \ suddenly felt very alone, as if he was on the front line of a battle and his all\
  \ comrades had suddenly deserted him, abandoning him to face the enemy alone. And\
  \ a hot anger began to stir in his belly.</p> \n     <p>Lost in his thoughts and\
  \ not paying attention to his surroundings, Ramalakesh bumped hard into an android\
  \ passing by. The android spun around and gave him a rough shove.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Watch where you’re going next time, lizard,” the android said, the circuitry tattoos\
  \ on their expressionless face glowing brightly.</p> \n     <p><i>Did they just\
  \ call me lizard</i>? Ramalakesh thought incredulously. In an instant, a predatory\
  \ rage dropped over him at the affront. Instinctively, Ramalakesh bared his teeth\
  \ and growled in the back of his throat. His heart sung in exhilaration, and he\
  \ could hear the war-songs of his ancestors ringing in his ears. His clawed hand\
  \ flashed to the dueling sword at his waist. This android would learn to respect\
  \ their betters.</p> \n     <p>The android’s face was unchanged as they flipped\
  \ aside their cloak, revealing a disintegrator pistol pointed right at the vesk’\
  s midsection.</p> \n     <p>“Back off, repto. I’d hate to have to melt a hole right\
  \ through those pretty little scales of yours.” Somehow, the android’s monotone\
  \ voice made them sound even more threatening.</p> \n     <p>Ramalakesh knew that\
  \ if he got into a fight here in public, he risked creating a diplomatic incident.\
  \ His career would be ruined. He would be cashiered and sent back to the Veskarium\
  \ in dishonor. His heart was pounding in his chest, but whether from bloodlust or\
  \ fear, he didn’t know. There was only one thing to do. Breathing heavily, Ramalakesh\
  \ held up his hands and lowered his head. When he wasn’t immediately shot, he turned\
  \ and fled into the crowd.</p> \n     <p>Everything around him was a blur, a clashing\
  \ cacophony of lights, colors, and noises. But it was all wrong. The light was wrong,\
  \ the smells were wrong, the people were wrong, and the babble of their languages\
  \ was incomprehensible. Ramalakesh understood now why so many of his compatriots\
  \ preferred to stay in the Vesk Quarter, where the blue lighting felt more natural,\
  \ where the smell of spiced talakka meat filled the air, where they could hear and\
  \ speak their native tongue, comfortably surrounded by their own people. A place\
  \ where everything was in order, everyone followed a regimented routine, just the\
  \ way things were supposed to be. It wasn’t home, but it was the only place on this\
  \ station that felt even close. Ramalakesh hurried through Parkside, head down,\
  \ retreating to the safety of the Vesk Quarter.</p> \n     <p>Just as Ramalakesh\
  \ was nearing the exit from the Eye that led to the arm of the station that held\
  \ the Vesk Quarter, a jumpsuited ysoki walked into his legs, halting them both in\
  \ their tracks. The small ratfolk had been talking animatedly to his companion and\
  \ hadn’t noticed the vesk coming toward him.</p> \n     <p>“Whoa! You’re a big one,\
  \ aren’t you?” the ysoki said, looking up. Without thinking, Ramalakesh showed his\
  \ teeth and growled, glaring down at the ysoki. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to hold\
  \ back this time. The ysoki’s eyes widened and he scrambled backward, hand scrabbling\
  \ toward the flame pistol on his belt.</p> \n     <p>“You walked right into him,\
  \ Quig,” said the ysoki’s companion, a human female. “Now apologize to the nice\
  \ vesk.”</p> \n     <p>“Hey, hey, all right,” the ysoki said, raising both hands.\
  \ “Sorry, my friend. Wasn’t watching where I was going. My mistake.”</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Ramalakesh took a deep breath and gritted his teeth, trying to will away his\
  \ anger, his frustration, his doubt. The human woman gazed at him with thoughtful,\
  \ appraising eyes.</p> \n     <p>“New here?” she asked. Her smile was friendly and\
  \ genuine. “Welcome to Absalom Station. Don’t worry. You’ll get used to it. And\
  \ if you haven’t checked out Golotra’s in the Freemarkets yet, you should! She has\
  \ the best grilled talakka steaks on the station. Trust me.” She winked at him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Have a nice evening.” The human woman gave a wave that was half salute,\
  \ put her hand on the ysoki’s shoulder, and the two of them walked past, disappearing\
  \ into the crowd.</p> \n     <p>As he turned to watch them go, Ramalakesh suddenly\
  \ realized he felt more at ease. Maybe Absalom Station and the Pact Worlders weren’\
  t so bad, after all. He would retreat—briefly—to the Vesk Quarter and regroup in\
  \ the comfort of his bunk in the diplomatic barracks. And in the morning, after\
  \ a good night’s rest, he would again be ready for battle, of a sort. Ramalakesh\
  \ would do his duty to the empire and conquer Absalom Station. He would make it\
  \ a part of him, and himself a part of it, and maybe his efforts would help bring\
  \ the peoples of the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds just a tiny bit closer together\
  \ in true friendship.</p> \n     <p>Major Ramalakesh looked up at the stars overhead,\
  \ the same stars that shone above Vesk Prime. He could almost smell spiced talakka\
  \ in the air. He straightened his spine and smiled. </p> \n     <p>Tomorrow was\
  \ going to be a good day.</p> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
