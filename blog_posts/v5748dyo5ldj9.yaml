  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, June 14, 2012</p> \n   <p>Hello all!</p> \n \
  \  <p>I'm Savannah Broadway, the newest resident of Internistan, which was established\
  \ by my fellow intern, Jerome. For those of you that were wondering, he's still\
  \ alive and well as far as I knowâ€”our schedules don't often overlap, lest we be\
  \ forced to knife-fight to the death over the computer. I don't know if you all\
  \ remember the pictures of the desks of previous interns, but our realm has relocated\
  \ to the warehouse. On the plus side, this means access to a lovely set of windows\
  \ that mostly overlook bushes and bit of the parking lot, and getting to listen\
  \ in on whatever music the warehouse crew is currently playing.</p> \n   <p>I'm\
  \ new to the state of Washington, having temporarily relocated here from tiny southern\
  \ Illinois. Next fall will be my junior year at Southern Illinois University Carbondale\
  \ studying Creative Writing and working in the Preservation lab. I've been into\
  \ reading and writing for as long as I can remember, but I started roleplaying games\
  \ about two and a half years ago. Since then I've loved the storytelling aspect\
  \ of the game, both as a player and a GM. I enjoy running bards, barbarians, a few\
  \ sorcerers, and once a chaotic good necromancer with an undead dodo familiar named\
  \ Percy.</p> \n   <p>Working at Paizo (even for the week or so that I've been at\
  \ it) has been a blast. The first time I pulled into the parking lot I saw that\
  \ the car next to me sported a pair of fuzzy d20s and knew that I had found the\
  \ right building. My tasks so far have been writing summaries for some of the Pathfinder\
  \ Tales, working on maps, and updating the infamous Rules Database. Also on the\
  \ list is braving Cosmo, who hasn't quite given up on insisting that I bring him\
  \ coffee and likes to <i>try</i> to act like a ninja. On another note, you'll be\
  \ able to see my very first work for Paizo in the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8moh\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #59: The Price of Infamy</i></a>.</p> \n   <p>All\
  \ in all, I'm sure that this summer will be a blast. The database may be intimidating\
  \ and the mouse wheel may refuse to scroll down, but I can't think of any other\
  \ place I'd rather intern. With any luck, I'll see you all at PaizoCon!</p> \n \
