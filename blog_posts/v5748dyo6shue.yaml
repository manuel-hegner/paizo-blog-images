  \ time to honor the accomplishments, culture, and history of folks whose ancestors\
  \ came from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. Here at\
  \ Paizo, we’re proud of our Hispanic coworkers, contributors, and community members!\
  \ We’re taking an extra day to celebrate them and all the amazing work they do.\

  \     <p>I’m of Mexican heritage, but always felt like I wasn’t Mexican enough growing\
  \ up. I’d get weird looks for being into games or for being loud and goofy. I wasn’\
  t always a quiet child that was into the same things as my parents, relatives, or\
  \ peers. For a long time, I felt like I wasn’t being Mexican the right way, even\
  \ though that’s a silly notion. A lot of my best friends growing up were white because\
  \ it seemed like white people could kind of do whatever they wanted to and at best\
  \ be written off as weird, rather than “not white enough.” Over the years, I learned\
  \ part of it was because of boundaries as to where Mexican ended and everything\
  \ else began. Mexicans did A, B, and C, but not X, Y, and Z. I saw it with a lot\
  \ of people, not just Mexicans. It could be a heritage thing, a religion thing,\
  \ a sexuality thing, a gender thing. These invisible boundaries were there, and\
  \ I was tired of them. I like the things I like and that doesn’t make me less Mexican.\
  \ Part of the reason I enjoy RPGs is because anyone can do anything they want or\
  \ be whomever they want. I hope that I can extend a hand to other people to climb\
  \ past these boundaries with our games. Maybe the next person we help can begin\
  \ tearing these boundaries down so everyone can be who they want without feeling\
  \ like they’re not doing it correctly.<br> Thanks,<br> Luis Loza</p> \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <h3>Diego Valdez (he/him), Paizo contributor and former Customer Service\
  \ Representative</h3> \n     <p>My name is Diego. I’ve been around the TTRPG industry\
  \ in a few ways. You may know me from my time as a customer service representative\
  \ for Paizo. But I have also done a lot of freelance writing for both Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder! For org play I have written two Starfinder Society scenarios and\
  \ a quest, and I also have three ACG adventures under my belt. I have a little bit\
  \ of backmatter in an AP for each Pathfinder and Starfinder. You can also find me\
  \ as a contributor on <em>Alien Archive 3</em>, <em>Near Space</em>, <em>Starship\
  \ Operations Manual</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, <em>Gods &amp; Magic</em>, and\
  \ the soon to be released <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em>.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ come from northern New Mexico, and I am very proud of my Chicano background and\
  \ heritage. Since I was young learning about it, embracing it, and living it has\
  \ always been an important part of who and what I am, even now, here in Washington\
  \ so far from home. Being able to bring more of that into the worlds I write for\
  \ is something I have really wanted to do. From a Curandera class, to an adventure\
  \ revolving around novelas, to setting locations with a Nuevo Mejicano style, I\
  \ hope to bring it all!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Joseph Blomquist (he/him), Paizo\
  \ Contributor</h3> \n     <p>Hola, my friends. I’m Joseph Blomquist, a Nuyorican\
  \ writer with a decade or so of freelance work around the game industry. I’ve contributed\
  \ to MWP’s <em>Smallville RPG</em> and <em>Marvel Heroic Roleplaying</em> lines,\
  \ to Starfinder Society with <em>2-21: Illegal Shipment</em>, <em>3-18: Secrets\
  \ in Stillness</em>, to Pathfinder Society with the upcoming <em>4-04: The Devil-Wrought\
  \ Disappearance</em>, among many other projects. With the exception to some PF2\
  \ conversions for Legendary’s fantastic <em>Boricubos: The Lost Isles</em>, my Latino\
  \ culture hasn’t come up as often in my freelance career as I would have liked—\
  but it has influenced my outlook on business and the perception of Hispanic and\
  \ Latino cultures in all industries, not just ours.</p> \n     <p>Twenty-five years\
  \ ago, I changed my name. To honor my stepfather, I took his name, forsaking the\
  \ family name I’d borne for twenty years, Rodriguez. Living in New York, where Rodriguez\
  \ was a more common surname than even Smith, nothing changed. But moving back to\
  \ Ohio, where I had spent much of my ill-omened teenage years, I saw a marked difference\
  \ in how I was perceived. It made me reconsider the importance that a simple name\
  \ could hold over someone’s life. I’ve made it my mission to help grow voices that\
  \ may have been ignored or passed over in the past because of their name, sex, skin\
  \ color, or any other element that makes them outside of the “normal.” I haven’\
  t always been successful, but I’ve tried to include every dark-haired, dark-eyed,\
  \ swarthy individual I could see in my mind’s eye so that others might see themselves.\
  \ And to live up to the responsibilities of my name, my family, and nuestra historia.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <p>We appreciate all our Hispanic community members, and we\
  \ invite those who didn’t share their voices as part of this blog to say hi in the\
  \ comments and share something you’re proud of! We look forward to celebrating you.\
