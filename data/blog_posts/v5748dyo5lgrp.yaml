  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Almost a week has passed since <a href=\"paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgri\"\
  >the <em>Occult Adventures</em> playtest closed</a>, and I've heard very positive\
  \ feedback from the Design Team about the playtest contributions of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a> players. Thank you for participating in the playtest and\
  \ helping us tweak the classes and make <a href=\"/products/btpy9a0h\"><em>Occult\
  \ Adventures</em></a> the best Gen Con release yet. Note that as of the playtest's\
  \ conclusion, creating characters using the playtest versions of the Occult Adventures\
  \ classes is no longer legal; only those who unlocked the ability to play a psychic\
  \ character can continue to use that PC before the book's publication and inclusion\
  \ on the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\">Additional Resources\
  \ page</a>.</p> \n     <p>This year we put together something different for Pathfinder\
  \ Society: we offered a four-part boon to incentivize playtesting and reward those\
  \ who ran a lot of tests across a wide range of levels. The Chronicle sheet addressed\
  \ a few concerns we have had during past RPG hardcover playtests, such as limited\
  \ higher-level playtest reports and a glut of playtest characters running around\
  \ the campaign between December and August using non-final versions of the classes.\
  \ Mark Seifter and I worked together to build an incentive to assist the designers\
  \ while also keeping the impact of the playtest to a minimum after it wrapped up.\
  \ We also knew that unlocking that fourth and final boon would be difficult but\
  \ that we wanted to reward anyone who was so dedicated to the playtest process.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I'm certain there are ways to improve the process even further, and\
  \ I would like to hear your feedback on what went well and what could be better\
  \ in the organized play playtest. Did this Chronicle sheet inspire you to try a\
  \ class and provide feedback? Were you more inclined to test just one character\
  \ to unlock as many boons as possible, or did you try out several classes? Did you\
  \ or anyone you know unlock the third boon (6 play credits) or the fourth boon (9\
  \ credits)? Did the boons strike a good balance between being attractive and not\
  \ being game-breaking? Did you find the Chronicle sheet easy to use and understand?\
  \ These are just a few questions on my mind, and if you have related feedback about\
  \ some other aspect of how we handled the playtest for <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a>, let me know here.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
