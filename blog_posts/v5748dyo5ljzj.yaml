  description\"><i>Churches, corporations, governments, and other organizations all\
  \ have secrets. The Dataphiles work to uncover these secrets, deciding what to share\
  \ and what to store in their vast data vaults inside Archive's Cortex, a sector\
  \ of the Lorespire Complex in Absalom Station. While not all information is shared\
  \ beyond the Dataphiles' archives, the simple act of guarding knowledge acts as\
  \ a guiding light for the Dataphiles. Data comes in many forms, and the Dataphiles\
  \ employ more than just computer-specialists in their ranks. Those Starfinders skilled\
  \ at withdrawing information from sentient creatures—either by coercion, discourse,\
  \ or trickery—are highly valued. As their sites of interest are among the best-defended\
  \ installations in the galaxy, the Dataphiles also have a pressing need for trained\
  \ combat specialists—whether to have a strong arm protecting a hacker during a delicate\
  \ operation, or to have an armed ally capable of getting the prize out alive.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>If you have been following Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild news\
  \ from the start, you have probably heard about the Dataphiles. They are the first\
  \ faction we announced almost four months ago over on the <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2017/03/know-direction-153-starfinder-pathfinder-society-interview/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Know Direction Podcast</a>. It is quite appropriate if you've\
  \ listened to entire that podcast and are still ravenous for more information on\
  \ the Dataphiles; after all, the Dataphiles are all about getting as much information\
  \ as they can!</p> \n    <p>You can't have a futuristic setting without addressing\
  \ important things like computers, corporate espionage, the flow of information,\
  \ and hackers. The Dataphiles specialize in researching, finding, codifying, and\
  \ controlling any information they can get their hands on (or other suitable appendage...\
  \ yes that's an ongoing theme in Starfinder descriptions). The organized play team\
  \ really wanted to have an organization that would appeal to not only computer specialists,\
  \ but to those characters interested in accumulating vast amounts of key information.\
  \ We see the Dataphiles as letting us explore some themes from modern organizations,\
  \ like Anonymous or Wikileaks, while also letting us throw in a scenario or two\
  \ where the PCs can \"Hack the Gibson.\"</p> \n    <p>This brings us to the leader\
  \ of the Dataphiles, the android, <b>Historia-7</b> (LN female android mechanic).\
  \ In keeping with the Dataphiles theme, rather than give all the details on Historia-7\
  \ and history with the Starfinder Society, I think it's appropriate to present some\
  \ tidbits of information that might be important to Historia-7. I'll leave it to\
  \ all you intrepid data seekers out there to figure out what you can from these\
  \ details.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>You'll have a chance to meet Historia-7 in <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-01: The Commencement</em></a>. (Ok, easy start)</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Historia-4 compiled a significant record on the divergence of Corpse\
  \ Fleet construction practices from those of their Eoxian counterparts, submitting\
  \ the details for publication in the Starfinder Chronicles.</li> \n     <li>Historia-6\
  \ strongly supported the election of First Seeker Jadnura, and was subsequently\
  \ lost during the Scoured Stars incident.</li> \n     <li>Kuthona.</li>\n    </ul>\

  \  <p>I hope you will all have some fun scrutinizing these tidbits.</p> \n    <p>Now,\
  \ it's time for our regularly scheduled boon reveal! This week's boon is something\
  \ very different from what you've seen with our previous previews. Much like the\
  \ capstone boon we showcased last week, this week's boon is another informal category\
  \ of boon that John and I concocted after several cackle-filled meetings. To set\
  \ the mood, \"It was a vibrant and joy-filled PaizoCon when Thurston and John first\
  \ conjured the idea for the meta boons...\"</p> \n    <p>So here it is!</p> \n \
  \   <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Digital Presence (Slotless*\
  \ Boon)</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-\">You work to propagate a thriving digital\
  \ community.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dataphiles:\
  \ Tier 1</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Cost</b>: 0 Fame (see below)</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Benefit</b>: If you complete a scenario that\
  \ you played online, such as by using a virtual tabletop or a play-by-post format,\
  \ you earn 1 additional Fame and 1 additional Reputation with the Dataphiles faction.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b>: You can only benefit from this\
  \ boon a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Dataphiles\
  \ faction (maximum four total times at Reputation Tier 4). Each time you fulfill\
  \ the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the\
  \ associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation.</p> \n    \
  \ <p class=\"tiny\">*After receiving some editorial and community feedback, we're\
  \ moving away from the term \"Untyped Boon\" and are now using \"Slotless Boon\"\
  \ instead. This should be a clearer title for how these boons work, and avoid any\
  \ confusion about how many boons of this type you can slot.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Story time! Each faction will have a boon like the Digital Presence boon.\
  \ These unique \"meta boons\" operate outside of regular play conditions, often\
  \ requiring player-initiated actions to achieve. As you can see with the Dataphiles'\
  \ boon, we're trying to encourage online play—after all, it seems pretty appropriate\
  \ for a faction that's all about information and technology. Because we wanted these\
  \ to be bonuses, rather than things you had to buy to take advantage of, the meta\
  \ boons are all about giving characters a small Fame and Reputation bump for completing\
  \ certain out-of-game objectives. But to make it more than a one-time objective,\
  \ we opened it up so that a character can benefit from these bonuses up to once\
  \ per Reputation Tier (so, up to 4 times on a high-level character).</p> \n    <p>Ok,\
  \ so that's it for our latest faction reveal. Come back next week when we talk about\
  \ our final Starfinder Society faction: the Acquisitives.</p> \n    <p>Thurston\
