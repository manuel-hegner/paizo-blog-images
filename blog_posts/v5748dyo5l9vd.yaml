  \ <p>It's teaser time! <a href=\"/search?q=otis+adelbert+kline&amp;what=all\">Otis\
  \ Adelbert Kline</a>, the man who brought you so much sword-swinging, dalf-fighting,\
  \ empire-overthrowing Martian action in <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\"\
  >The Swordsman of Mars</a></i>, is back again with all that and more in <a href=\"\
  /planetStories/v5748btpy83x8\"><i>The Outlaws of Mars</i></a>! Scroll down to take\
  \ a peek at the action that's in store: </p>\n    <blockquote> \n     <p>She screamed\
  \ and shrank back from him, evidently rooted to the spot with terror.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Scarcely had he regained his balance, when Jerry's attention was attracted\
  \ by a new soundâ€”a terrific roar which came from a huge beast that was bounding\
  \ toward them along the path. With a yawning, tooth-filled mouth as large as that\
  \ of an alligator, a furry black body fully as big as that of a lion, short legs,\
  \ and a hairless, leathery tail, paddle-shaped and edged with sharp spines, the\
  \ oncoming monster certainly looked formidable.</p> \n     <p>Jerry thought and\
  \ acted swiftly. He realized that to attempt to stop such a creature with one shot\
  \ would be futile. If his first bullet should not be instantly fatal, it would be\
  \ upon them, a wounded and enraged instrument of death and destruction, before he\
  \ could bring it down with a second. His first duty was to get the girl out of the\
  \ path of the charging monster.</p> \n     <p>Gripping his rifle in his left hand,\
  \ he bent and encircled her slender waist with his right arm. Then he leaped to\
  \ one side, just in time to avoid those gaping jaws. But the spring he made surprised\
  \ him fully as much as it did the baffled beast, for it carried him clear over the\
  \ hedge, and into a carefully tended bed of tiny flowering plants upon the other\
  \ side.</p> \n     <p>For the first time since he had landed on Mars, he realized\
  \ the tremendous advantage of his Earth-trained muscles. Nor was he slow to make\
  \ use of it. The short-legged beast, unable to leap over the hedge, was crashing\
  \ through it. So he turned, and still carrying the girl beneath his arm, bounded\
  \ away with the tremendous leaps which it would have been difficult for a terrestrial\
  \ kangaroo to equal in its native habitat.</p> \n     <p>The slender form of the\
  \ girl was feather-light, and impeded him scarcely at all. On Earth she would have\
  \ weighed about ninety pounds; on Mars she weighed but thirty-four.</p> \n     <p>Glancing\
  \ back over his shoulder, he saw that although he had a good start on the beast,\
  \ it was following him with a speed that was amazing in a creature with such short\
  \ legs. Instinctively, he had started toward the wall. Soon the stairway loomed\
  \ before him, and he bounded up it, five steps at a time. As soon as he reached\
  \ the top of the wall he put the girl down and turned to face their pursuer, which\
  \ had meantime reached the steps.</p> \n     <p>Snapping his gun to his shoulder,\
  \ he took careful aim between the blazing green eyes, and fired...</p> \n    </blockquote>\
