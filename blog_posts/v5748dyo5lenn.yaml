  \ Champions of Purity</i></a> is on its way to stores and subscribers soon, and\
  \ I thought I'd take this opportunity to point out some of my favorite parts of\
  \ this book. While it has all the delightful crunch readers have come to expect\
  \ in the Player Companion line (including new feats, magic items, spells, bardic\
  \ masterpieces, subdomains, inquisitions, and a whole ton more I don't want to give\
  \ away), the most exciting part about this volume for me is the careful and thought-out\
  \ discussions regarding alignment and playing good characters. Some of the most\
  \ interesting matters considered in this book include:</span></p> \n    <ul>\n \
  \    <li>Explorations of the methodologies, advantages, and challenges of each good\
  \ alignment. Examples of philosophies followed by characters of various good alignments\
  \ ensure that no two chaotic good characters are the same, while suggestions on\
  \ how to play alongside characters of opposing or conflicting alignments make certain\
  \ your group doesn't fall apart just because the paladin caught the rogue stealing\
  \ something.</li> \n     <li>Thoughts on putting good characters in bad situations\
  \ and tips on how to handle moral quandaries as they apply to rules for characters\
  \ such as paladins as well as for purely roleplaying purposes.</li> \n     <li>A\
  \ discussion of redemption and how this might play into capturing villains both\
  \ mortal and otherworldly. While that misled farmer stealing his neighbor's sheep\
  \ might be redeemable, how does one go about handling a tiefling foe or even a crib\
  \ full of goblin babies? Examples of possible penances and other ways characters\
  \ might go about achieving atonement abound.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>If you're\
  \ tired of playing the same old lawful good holy knight or even just want to put\
  \ a new spin on your chaotic good barbarian, <i>Champions of Purity</i> is an absolute\
  \ don't-miss. Coming soon!</p> \n    <p>Patrick Renie<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n\
