<p itemprop="description">Over the past year, Society GMs and players opened their hearts (and wallets) in support of other people. While the reasons varied from sick children to cancer research to wounded service members to animal shelters, the generosity of our community didn't waver. Thank you and a huge round of applause to all the organizers on the list for the extra effort it takes to include a charity component in your event. Through the efforts of your labors and the generosity of your players, someone's day brightened.</p>

<p>Below is a list of all conventions that submitted requests for convention support from Nov 2017 through October 2018. This doesn't include the smaller events that may have had a charity component, but not reached the 15-table minimum needed for event support. Colorado Springs, CO, hosted the most charity events with 3 apiece. Looking at the regional standings, we had a three-way tie between Great Lakes, Northeast, and Western Eurasia-Middle East with 9 events each. Again, thank you to all the organizers listed below for their time and energy in support of their chosen charities!</p>

<h2>Extra Life</h2>
<p>Two years ago, several Pathfinder Society lodges supported Extra Life events independent of each other . Last year, Paizo engaged directly in fundraising for Extra Life through live play events hosted at our offices and available via a 25-hour Twitch stream. The Paizo efforts were in addition to Society Lodges hosting Extra Life events throughout the end of October and early November.</p>

<p>This year, the Organized Play team decided to support Extra Life by releasing world-wide benefits to any convention running between now and November 12, provided the monies raised from the charity component go to the Extra Life campaign.</p>
<p>The benefits include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Retail Incentive Program status regardless of having a retail presence at the convention.</li>
<li>Access to the charity boons Hubris Coil (PFS), Lucky Knuckles (PFS), Manticore Starship (SFS), Skittermander (SFS). One boon from each program may be requested. Email <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with the choices for your convention and for guidelines on how to report boon winners.</li>
<li>Purchasable d20 rerolls - you may pay $10 for an additional reroll and $1 to bump the result up 1. So for $30, you may have a guaranteed "20".

		<p>A new update to the <a href = "/products/btpy9vlp?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide"><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a> is due... well, right now!</p>
		
		<p>That's right. <span itemprop="description">As of now, the guide has been updated to include a variety of updates put together by the Organized Play Team and built from the feedback of countless players and organizers across the world. I'd like to also give a special thanks to anyone who contributed to the thread that was started months ago on this topic as your comments were invaluable in coming up with these updates.</span></p>
		
		<p>So, let's hop into a summary of the major changes:</p>
		
		<div class = "blurb360">
			<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7107-DataJockey.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7107-DataJockey_360.jpeg"></a>
		</div>
		
		<ul><li>A new playable faction has been included: the Second Seekers loyal to First Seeker Jadnura. This includes a table of associated boons, including numerous new boons unique to this faction.</li>
			<li>The list of always available playable races has been expanded to include the legacy races included in the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>.</li>
			<li>The required resources necessary to create a character of a new race have been clarified to accommodate special rules reference handouts included in certain scenarios.</li>
			<li>The rebuilding rules for characters and personal boons has been clarified.</li>
			<li>Numerous faction-associated boons have been clarified or expanded, including hirelings, basic purchases, and improved faction champion boons.</li>
			<li>Details are now available for the Exo-Guardians and Wayfinders capstone boons, providing playable statistics for a new race and starship hull.</li>
			<li>The instructions for filling out a Chronicle sheet have been updated, including when a PC can purchase and sell gear.</li>
			<li>Rules for applying credit have been relaxed slightly when using pregenerated characters in adventures that require the use of such characters.</li>
			<li>Information about the Vehicle scenario tag and the Vanity boon descriptor has been added.</li>
			<li>GMs' Chronicle sheet rewards have been clarified.</li>
			<li>UPBs are now purchasable in single units rather than only in lots of 1,000.</li>
			<li>The Tier 2 and Tier 6 Drake starships' shields and armaments have been updated to better match the hull's intended function.</li>
			<li>The list of Regional Venture-Coordinators and regions has been updated.</li></ul>
		
		<p>From this list, there's a few points I'd like to highlight:</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p><b>Second Seekers (Jadnura)</b>: Ohhhhhhh a new faction! For those who've been interested in seeing how we're going to handle multiple Second Seekers factions, then Jadnura is our first example of that. I suspect a lot of the boons are going to interest some players out there, especially the ability to replay content and earn full credit for it. Similarly, if you like your growing stable of ally boons, then this faction is a great opportunity for those of you who want new characters to earn even more ally potential.</p>
			
			<p><b>New Capstones</b>: Veteran Exo-Guardians can bestow a new ship on new Starfinder recruits: the Gorgon. This vessel is essentially a murderboat intended to render opposing starships down to fine particulate matter&mdash;have fun with that. The Wayfinders also reveal their associated new race, which shouldn't come as a surprise to players who've been playing Starfinder Society since the beginning.</p>
			
			<p><b>A More Toothy Drake</b>: The Drake base hull has received some further updates. The Tier 2 version of the ship has had some weapon upgrades to make it more in line with the type of starship role we wanted it to have (at a small cost to its shields). Meanwhile, the Tier 6 version of the ship had its erroneous linked missile weapons replaced with a potent torpedo launcher.</p>
			
			<p><b>Legacy Races Always Available</b>: It may not be uplifted bears (don't worry, I'm working on that) but players can now enjoy all the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> legacy races as being always available. Go forth and populate the universe with dwarves, elves, gnomes and all the other legacy races!</p>
			
			<p><b>Quality of Life</b>: We've eased some of the Additional Resources requirements on new races, allowing players to play their new races with handouts provided by scenarios. We've also allowed players to apply credit to a character of any level within the level range of a pregenerated character scenario, which should ease up some of the credit discussions around <a href = "/products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Special-100-Claim-to-Salvation"><em>Starfinder Society #1-00: Claim to Salvation</em></a>. There's also been some tightening of language around GM Chronicle sheet rewards and how a GM can apply character boons during the course of a scenario they run. Finally, you can now purchase UPBs in single units rather than in lots of 1,000, which should further encourage crafters to build equipment!</p>
			
			</blockquote>
		
		<p>I'd like to give a big shout out to our editors, art and layout folks, and Managing Developer Adam Daigle for helping out in getting everything ready for distribution to the masses.</p>
		
		<p>This update to the <em>Guide</em> should last us until the start of our next season, currently slated for June of 2019. Of course, feel free to continue posting feedback about the <em>Starfinder Society Guide</em> on the Organized Play forums, and we'll do our best to keep compiling all the information for future updates.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The following additions have been added to clear up some of the questions we've seen about the new "always available" status for legacy races in the new update to this guide.</p>

<blockquote>		
<h2>Legacy Race Clarification</h2>

<p>There have been some questions about how players who'd previously unlocked legacy races should handle them now that legacy races are always available. The following are official clarifications on how players should handle legacy races previously earned in the campaign.</p>

<ul>
<li>Characters who've earned a Legacy Race boon from RSP or a special convention boon prior to the publishing of this blog can create or continue playing a Legacy Race and increase one ability score that is 14 or lower by 2. These characters retain their Personal boon slot but cannot slot in a Personal boon that would augment an ability score (such as any of the admittance boons.)</li>
<li>Characters who've earned a Legacy Race boon via a scenario prior to the publishing of this blog can convert the Personal Boon from the "New Character" option to the "Existing" option and earn the +2 in one ability score that is 14 or lower. This occupies the Personal boon slot.</li>
<li>Characters who earn a Legacy Race boon following the publishing of this blog can slot the Personal Boon onto their character and select the "Existing" option to earn the additional ability score boost. This occupies the Personal boon slot.</li>
<li>For Characters who've applied two legacy race boons to a character (one for race access and one for the stat boost) those characters now only gain the benefit of the "Existing" portion of the race boon. The initial "New Character" application of the boon is ignored. In no circumstance, can a PC ever earn more than one +2 increase to an ability score modifier.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

		<p>So how about making some new characters?</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">As we draw ever closer to the end of the playtest, there are still a number of questions we need to ask you about the way the game works and how that's conveyed to you in the book. Today, we're launching a pair of surveys that do just that, one focusing on presentation and another focusing on magic.</p>

<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>First up, we have a survey looking at the presentation of the book. This survey looks at our use of symbols, color, and language to convey game rules to you. We tried some experimental things with the <a href="/products/btq01vb7?Pathfinder-Playtest-Rulebook"><em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em></a>, and want to know what you think of these tests. Your answers will help us determine what the final version of the game actually looks like. When you're ready to take this survey, follow the link below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPPresentation"><b>Presentation Survey</b></a></p>

<h2>Spells and Magic</h2>
<p>Next up, we've opened up a survey to look at how spells and magic items work in the game. This isn't the first time we've asked about these topics, but previously, it's always been in the context of other surveys with other goals. This time, we want to know specifically what you think about how magic works in the Pathfinder Playtest.</p>

<p>One of our primary goals in designing the playtest rules was to ensure that spells and magic items are still an integral part of the game, but also to make sure characters who don't rely heavily on such abilities aren't overshadowed. We did this in a variety of ways, but there are some places where it seems clear that the restrictions may have taken away a bit too much from magic and its role in the game. This survey looks at ways that we might add some sizzle back into your <i>lightning bolt</i> and some charm into your, well, <i>charm</i>.</p>

<p>In particular, there are three levers we can manipulate to add power and versatility to magic that we want you to think about when taking this survey:</p>
<ol>
<li>Number of spells per day.</li>
<li>Chance that a spell will succeed (or that foes will fail saving throws).</li>
<li>Power of individual spells.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you've given those some thought, you can find the survey at the link below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPSpellsMagic"><b>Magic Survey</b></a></p>

<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>Finally, I want to take a moment to talk about where we're at right now in the playtest and where we're heading in the future. We've gotten a lot of data about the game, and much of it has been synthesized into a very large list of tasks and things that we need to do to the game before it goes to the printer next year. In the coming months, the playtest will draw to a close, and there will be no additional public updates to the rules while we focus on making changes to the game.</p>
<p>That said, we're not going to leave you without an idea of where things are going. Next week, we'll be dropping an absolutely huge Update 1.6, which adds or adjusts aspects of every class in the game! This ranges from a small alteration in stances that affects the fighter to major changes for the alchemist and paladin. We think you'll see a lot of your concerns addressed in some of these changes, and the best part is, these are just a fraction of what we're doing behind the scenes to make the game even better!</p>

<p>As always, I want to thank each and every one of you for participating in this playtest. The game is really shaping up to be something great, and you helped make that happen!</p>

<p itemprop="description">Do you want to hear a scary story?</p>

<p>It all began on a cold, dreary winter's night. A thin mist covered the ground, and the streetlights did little to pierce the gloom. Most people were in their homes, huddling under blankets, sipping warm cocoa, and basking in the comforting glow of their television sets. Most sane people, that is.

<p>&hellip;That man, dear reader, was yours truly! *lightning flashes* *thunder rumbles* And that screed I wrote was none other than the outline for the upcoming <a href="/store/starfinder/adventurePath/signalOfScreams">Signal of Screams Adventure Path</a>! *more lightning and thunder* *also, a wolf howls in the distance for some reason*</p>

<p>Seriously though, this three-part space horror Adventure Path is the first Starfinder product that I had the pleasure of concepting and developing from start to finish, and I couldn't be prouder or more excited to share it with you. While I didn't actually spend any late nights putting it all together, I couldn't have done it without the entire Starfinder team (who helped brainstorm the spookiest of ideas) and all the terrific authors that agreed to work on this project! And of course, I can't forget the artists who helped bring these chilling visions to life, as well as the art, editing, and other departments here at Paizo that make sure you get the best product possible!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20181026-Corrupted.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20181026-Corrupted_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>The first adventure, <a href="/products/btq01vb2?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-10-The-Diaspora-Strain"><i>The Diaspora Strain</i></a>, comes out very soon and sees a group of 7th-level characters get invited to the grand re-opening of a luxury resort asteroid in the Diaspora called New Elysium. The facility has been newly automated with a virtual intelligence program and the PCs, along with a handful of celebrities, will be the first guests to put the system to the test. I don't want to spoil any surprises, but of course, things don't go quite as planned. Author (and fellow Adventure Path developer) Chris Sims has put together a spooky adventure that will have player characters question their sanity.</p>

<p>In addition to some creepy new monsters and details on a lonely world accessible only through the Drift, this first volume features an article about a corruption system new to Starfinder that will get used throughout the campaign (by me) and advice on to run and play in Starfinder horror adventures by Epidiah Ravachol, author of the very popular indie horror RPG Dread!</p>

<p>What is the mysterious Signal of Screams? Find out this winter, if you dare!</p>

<p itemprop="description">October brings with it all manner of spooky gifts! While this month's Starfinder releases may not as overtly spooky in nature as some past releases, I can assure you that both scenarios involve some scenes that scream for GMs to ramp up the tension. Let's dive into this month's offerings.</p>

<p>Our first scenario for this month, <a href="/products/btq01va4?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-124-Siege-of-Enlightenment"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-24: Siege of Enlightenment</i></a> really comes from a conversation I had with Organized Play Lead Developer, John Compton, regarding other civilizations near to the Pact Worlds. We both agreed that we wanted to show some minor powers throughout the region and bring in future allies/foes we could later call upon. This scenario showcases two previously unheard of powers in relative proximity to the Pact Worlds and a growing conflict that threatens to destroy them both. Tineke Bolleman, who you may recognize as one of the quest authors from <a href="/products/btpya08w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-16-Dreaming-of-the-Future"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-16: Dreaming of the Future</i></a> jumped right into the task of creating two new space-faring civilizations and the I think the results speak for themselves. Fans of more traditional Pathfinder won't be disappointed, as this month's Tier 1-4 scenario also brings a fan favorite species into the Starfinder limelight: hobgoblins!</p>

<p>Now, Organized Play Lead Developer, John Compton, is going to take some time to tell you about this month's second scenario!</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20181025-MP8.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20181025-MP8_180.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Michele Giorgi</i></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>For many months, Adrian Ng has been the behind-the-scenes champion of organized play, which is to say he's taken the lead in editing most of our scenarios. As you might guess, he's very familiar with not only our style but also our stories, and the time was right for him to show off has narrative skills with <a href="/starfindersociety">Starfinder Society's</a> latest repeatable scenario, <a href="/products/btq01va5?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-125-The-Beacon-Code-Dilemma"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-25: The Beacon Code Dilemma</i></a>. Not only does this explore some of the Society's past and the machine god Triune's lore (including an influential priest, pictured here), but it's also a fun romp through space in search of a lost starship and priceless artifact&mdash;classic! Adrian's included a lot of fun ways to vary the experience, providing fun ways for the GM to both personalize some of the discoveries and shake up the combats. Be sure to check out this Tier 3-6 scenario.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So with all that, I think you can see why we're pretty darn excited for October's offerings. Stop by the blog next month, when we'll be previewing the next set of scenarios, including our first scenario for a brand new faction that some of you may already be familiar with. Speaking of familiarity, fans of Pathfinder Society are in for a treat as we explore a Starfinder follow-up to one of Pathfinder's earliest scenarios!</p>

  <p itemprop="description">As we brainstorm adventures, the team often comes up with ideas that we have to shelve for months or even years before they come to fruition. When we were looking at our season's schedule months ago, we had several open Tier 3-7 slots, and at long last there was the opportunity to realize one of my dream two-part series that's perfect for the Halloween season. It's been floating in my head since a shortly after <a href = "/products/btpy93m4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-16-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-3-Sanctum-of-the-Sages"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-16: Destiny of the Sands, Part 3: Sanctum of the Sages</em></a>, which has a somewhat famous and temporary character augmentation. The idea that we could use that concept for something as strange as a monstrous template, though... that's always been a bit of a dream. Thankfully, Linda was ready to take the lead on developing our Mysteries Under Moonlight series, and she's going to jump in to say some more.</p>

			<p>In last month's adventure, <a href = "/products/btpzgd7n?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1005-Mysteries-Under-Moonlight-Part-1-Testament-of-Souls"><em>Mysteries Under Moonlight, Part 1: Testament of Souls</em></a>, the PCs received a unique blessing. Put this blessing to use in <a href = "/products/btq01va3?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1007-Mysteries-Under-Moonlight-Part-2-The-Howling-Dance"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-07: Mysteries Under Moonlight, Part 2: The Howling Dance</em></a>, a Tier 3-7 scenario by Crystal Malarsky. Crystal has a real knack for atmosphere, which is perfect for this spooky adventure. Race into the haunted Mushfens swamp on the trail of an evil being who has been spreading corruption through Magnimar and beyond. Save innocent spirits from a creeping malevolence, face your fears, and put an end to a terrifying ruler. Trust me, the grinning skull surrounded by tormented spirits so delightfully illustrated by Leonardo Santanna does not have your PCs's best interests in mind.</p>

		<p style = "clear: both;">My first love in the Pathfinder campaign setting was far and away Katapesh, both where my first AP experience takes place in Legacy of Fire, but also the adopted home of my first Pathfinder Society character. We've wanted to do more of a follow-up to the Liberty's Edge developments from <a href = "/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em></a>, and Katapesh feels like the ideal place not just for that, but also to meet some enterprising goblins who have adapted quite admirably to city life (including their leader, illustrated by Marko Horvatin).</p>

It's not all fun and games though, as the PCs must navigate a treacherous web of ambition, betrayal, and worse when the long-running feud between two venture-captains, human seer Wulessa Yuul and the half-orc potions merchant Phlegos Dulm, finally comes to a head as each makes their move to seize the opportunities created by Roderus's pending absence. The PCs will have some help along the way though, including unexpected allies like this individual illustrated by Marko Horvatin.</p>

<p itemprop="description">While much of the fun in <a href="/products/btpya20r?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-2"><em>Alien Archive 2</em></a> for players is looking at new playable species, there's much more player-facing content than just aliens to make into new characters. Like the first <em>Alien Archive</em>, we wanted to help describe the strangeness of a science-fantasy universe with rules elements any character can pick up and use.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Alien Archive</em></a>, we made sure to create an index (Appendix 9: Rules Options) to list them all in one place for easy reference.</p>

<p>There are lots of items, including weapons (such as the phasic scythe), defensive items (such as the adaptive defense module), technological items (such as the plasma diverter), hybrid items (from the <i>mi-go brain cylinder</i> to the <i>Shotalashu saddle</i>), magic items (such as the <i>calecor skull-globe</i>), a surprising number of augmentations (six of them!) , and even a computer upgrade (the telepathic user interface).</p>

<p>Each of those is tied to a specific creature entry, in ways that help define that creature's place in the galaxy. For example, the glass serpent is a terrifying ambush predator that roams the blasted wastelands of Eox (though similar creatures have been found on dozens of planets, including many outside the Pact Worlds). The scales of a glass serpent can absorb and bend light, which the creature controls with its musculature to become invisible. While a glass serpent's skin isn't a continuous cloak of invisibility just because you remove and present it, it can be used as the basis for stealth technology, including the glass skin augmentation and lightwarp inlay armor upgrade (previewed below).</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20181023-Armor.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20181023-Armor_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title"><b>Lightwarp Inlay</b></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price:</b> 5,000 <b>Level:</b> 6</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Capacity:</b> 10 <b>Usage: </b>1/round</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Armor Slots:</b> 1 <b>Armor Type:</b> Any <p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Bulk:</b> L</p>

<p>This specialized coating of glass serpent scales shifts its collective angle in response to localized electrical fields created by a delicate circuitry inlay, allowing the bending of light around you. You can activate this inlay as a standard action to become temporarily invisible (as the <i>invisibility</i> spell, save that the process is purely technological rather than magical). This invisibility lasts until you deactivate it (which you can do as part of any other action) or the inlay runs out of charges. A lightwarp inlay's charges replenish each day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also two feats (Polymorph Adept and Squox Companion), which tie to specific new options, one of which is obviously an element of magic that so far Starfinder hasn't gone into&mdash;polymorphing.</p>

<p>A set of core rules present a flexible set of general guidelines for what happens when magic changes your form and then a set of variable level spells (<i>polymorph</i> and <i>baleful polymorph</i>, along with mass versions of each) give spellcasters access to those shapechanging powers. A number of forms are presented (from simple kalo form to more complex blue dragon and fire elemental forms) to allow polymorphing to be accessed quickly, but the rules are also presented to allow a player and GM to build forms for nearly any conceivable creature. After all it's a big galaxy out there, and there's no telling what weird things a character might want to change into!</p>

		<p>We're left now with six unrevealed figures that exemplify some of the weirder fantasy elements in the Kingmaker campaign, so I won't bore you with further theatrics. Just imagine what would happen if a bunch of drunk proto-deities made a first draft of the world, threw in some magic and glitter, and then sort of left their creations to evolve in isolation for a few millennia. That's how you end up with things like the strange (but incredibly cute) fey dragon, a Small common figure. How does something so silly looking even fit into an ecosystem without going extinct? By having magic powers, that's how!</p>
		
		<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-FeyDragon.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-FeyDragon_500.jpeg"></a></div>

		<p>It's not the only creature in the set tainted by magic and a pastel filter. Check out this dwoemercat, a creation of none other than Ed Greenwood, for the very first volume of Kingmaker. What better size and rarity could one ask for in a dwoemercat than Medium and common, respectively? No better size and rarity, I say!</p>
		
		<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-Dwoemercat.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-Dwoemercat_500.jpeg"></a></div>
		
		<p>Are you liking the fuzzies? Here's another new fuzzy, albeit a waterlogged one. The fur on an ahuizotl clumps to form weird little spikes, hence its name, which translates to "spiny aquatic thing" according to Wikipedia. Originating in Aztec myth, these Large rare cuties like human flesh, “especially nails, eyes, and teeth.” YUM!</p>
		
		<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-Ahuizotl.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-Ahuizotl_500.jpeg"></a></div>
				
		<p>But wait! It gets cuter! Who's a good boy? Trollhound's a good boy! Yes he is! Look at that well maintained coat of luxuriant mussed hair and thick hide of trollish green. He's even trained: "Roll over! Sit! Don't eat me!" Well, two out of three isn't bad. <span class = "unlink"><i>Cue Sarah McLachlan music.</i></span> Give this poor creature a home, because every Medium uncommon figure deserves a chance to murder PCs.</p>
		
		<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-Trollhound.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-Trollhound_500.jpeg"></a></div>
		
		<p>Ok, I admit I may have gone overboard with the whole "things get weird" blog theme, but I'm committed now, so there's no stopping me. Spider-man himself couldn't put an end to my antics! Not even Pathfinder's own version of Spider-man, the web lurker. Less an awkward nerd bitten by a radioactive spider and thrust into a life of crime fighting, secret identities, and heartbreak than a literal man-spider, the web lurker is a Medium common figure who can't wait to be your friendly neighborhood aberrant horror.</p>
		
		<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-WebLurker.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181023-WebLurker_500.jpeg"></a></div> 
		
		<p>Finally, we have the weirdest addition to the set yet, as saving the best for last seemed appropriate: a danged-old <i>gnome</i>! Here, good reader, we have a fine specimen of pedantic, pompous, and generally insufferable gnome alchemist, the inimitable Jubilost Narthropple. In his myriad published works, he makes an irrefutable case for being the best companion in not only <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>, but in the entirety of Golarion and the history of CRPGs as well. It is only fitting, then, that he offset his Small size with an uncommon rarity, so that no adventuring party suffers the indignity of not having him along to tell them everything they're doing wrong.</p>

	<p>We know that the hectic pace has been hard to keep up with, but we would like to encourage you to keep playing and submitting your playtest results, even if the focus has moved on. As a reminder, all of the Doomsday Dawn surveys will remain open through the end of the playtest period!</p>
	
	<h2>Update 1.5 Is Alive!</h2>
	
	<p>Throughout the playtest we’ve been gathering a lot of feedback about spells and their relative power level in the game, especially regarding how they compare to spells as they were used in Pathfinder First Edition. While some of these changes were made to prevent problematic situations in play, others were made to help them function more cleanly in the new edition’s structure.</p>
	
	<p>The survey results are pretty clear that we have succeeded in those goals for some areas of spellcasting and fallen short in others—sometimes significantly short. Fortunately, because this is a playtest, we can make adjustments and get more feedback. As of this update, we are increasing the power level of some spells, starting with those that deal damage, as they are the easiest ones to adjust, update, and test. Update 1.5 contains a list that includes the majority of the damage-dealing spells in the game, revising their overall damage values. Fireball, for example, has gone from dealing 6d6 fire damage to dealing 8d6 fire damage. This doesn’t affect how the spells scale, other than to adjust the base value (so a 4th-level fireball spell will deal 10d6 fire damage).</p>
	
	<p>We want to stress that these are not the only changes that will be happening to spells between now and the final version of the game, but they are the ones that we can most easily present for additional playtesting.</p>
	
	<p>This update also contains a few other small alterations. While the dying rules have been well received since Update 1.3, there are still some improvements that might be made. In this update, we’ve changed the saving throw for stabilizing when dying to a flat check (DC = 10 + the dying value). We want to stress that this is purely a test to see how players respond to this as opposed to the Fortitude saving throw with a DC set by the monster. This is a change that we might roll back depending on feedback.</p>
	
	<p>There has also been a small change to Treat Wounds: the DC of the skill check is now set by the highest level of the character being treated. This was changed to clear up some odd issues with high-level characters having difficulty when healing targets that are of a much lower level. Again, Treat Wounds is still very much a rule that we are evaluating, and I think it is safe to say that it will probably change in some ways before we see a final version.</p>

	<h2>Updates and Changes</h2>
	
	<p>There has been some amount of consternation here and on other sites about the changes that are being rolled out as part of the updates, and what those changes say about the other rules that aren’t included in the updates. Right now, to keep the test focused, we are releasing rules updates only for things that we feel we can cleanly update and that need more testing, but that is by no means the full scope of the changes happing to the game here in the office.</p>
	
	<p>Your feedback has told us a great many things about the game, and we’ve been using that feedback to shape the rules as we move through the process. It is important for all of you to understand that even if you don’t see a rule being addressed in the updates or we aren’t speaking about it directly on the forums, that doesn’t mean it isn’t being modified or reevaluated for the final version of the game. As we said at the start of the playtest, every aspect of the game is on the table to change, depending on your feedback. Even if some of those changes might be too sweeping to implement in the midst of the playtest, we will make the changes needed to make the final game the best it can be. We’re excited to share what those changes and alterations will be, but the right time for that is after we have completed the playtesting process and are certain of what those changes will be.</p>
	
	<p>Having participated in every open playtest this company has ever conducted, I can honestly say that this one has provided us with more valuable feedback and insight into how you play than any other test we have ever conducted. I am confident that it will show through in the new version of Pathfinder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After our initial experiences in <a href="http://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">Part One</a>, <a href="http://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9p?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">Part Two</a>, and <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgb4?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">Part Three</a> of the playtest, it was time for part four and our first adventure by author Mark Seifter. The pressure was a little higher for this one, because it was Mark who first sat with us at PaizoCon 2018 and tossed around the idea of doing a full playtest for the Paizo Blog. As this scenario focused on overland exploration in an area of the River Kingdoms known as Thicketfell, our GM gathered images to match the varying terrain, as well as nature soundscapes to build immersion. Perhaps the best effect though, was that while our characters searched extensively for a remote pond called the Moonmere, we spent most of the scenario in the natural light of a New Jersey autumn.</p>

<h2>The Party</h2>
<p>As this part of the playtest was designed to use the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">same four characters as part one</a>, we were able to see how well this non-traditional roster of iconics would hold up at higher levels. While Resonance would presumably be tough on us without a cleric, this party set out to prove that even a lineup without major access to healing could thrive in the new edition. Moreover, this was our first time updating characters instead of creating new ones, and as expected, it was much faster than drawing them up from scratch. For playtest purposes, the same four OAD members played the same iconic characters as part one and listed with their names is the year each became a member of the Order (when a player has reached 100 hours at our table).</p>

<h2>Highlights From "The Mirrored Moon"</h2>
<p>We can count on one hand number of rocs we've encountered over the years. Iconic yet elusive, we consider ourselves lucky to come across even one of these birds of legend, and "The Mirrored Moon" generously delivered two. Our GM was so excited that he gleefully placed Fumbus's miniature in its talon when one of them snatched the goblin up, then dropped him 135 feet to the ground.</p>
  
<p>This scenario featured some new game mechanics that had us seeking out potential allies as we acquired treasure and research points to aid us in the final confrontation. That being said, we did not deliberately set out to exterminate an entire clan of cyclopes. Negotiations were going south after a failed diplomacy check, and we had our chance to leave, but the halfling's smooth tongue had always saved us from these situations. As nine angry cyclopes and their pet smilodon closed in, we thought this was going to be the shortest blog report of the past few years&mdash;until three critical fails against <i>synaptic</i><i>pulse</i> bought us precious time, and the win.</p>
  
<p>We challenged norms regarding party construction and executed well in what was a very melee-heavy encounter against a sizeable force of five trolls and two giants. Seoni's heightened <i>invisibility</i> was key here, as was Sajan's ability to run up walls and across water. With the battle lasting a grueling 22 rounds, Fumbus's persistent fire damage made a nice highlight reel as he lit the trolls up.</p>
  
<h2>Character Deaths</h2>
<p>After two months of searching, we discovered the Moonmere with just a few hours to spare before the Night Heralds summoned a Mu Spore; as such, we had to attack without support from potential allies. The result: we TPKed out. This scenario was certainly fair&mdash;definitely fun&mdash;and we gladly accept that this loss was on us!</p>
  
<h2>Current Situation</h2>
<p>Our record is now a gritty 2-2 across the first four scenarios of the <i>Doomsday</i><i>Dawn</i> playtest. As you can see from the hex map we marked while exploring Thicketfell, we wasted too much time searching for a gnome settlement and still missed it by one hex. If we had found it, we'd have procured the necessary ally points and would likely be reporting a win. It's a game of inches.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Why the River Kingdoms are called such has always puzzled me, given that rivers are only the second most plentiful resource in the region behind bandits and other ne'er-do-wells who find the largely lawless lands a safe place to practice their chicanery.

<p itemprop="description">Why the River Kingdoms are called such has always puzzled me, given that rivers are only the second most plentiful resource in the region behind bandits and other ne'er-do-wells who find the largely lawless lands a safe place to practice their chicanery. Thus, no adventure set in the region would be complete without its fair share of cutpurses and footpads, and the Kingmaker Adventure Path is no exception. As such, it seemed only natural to include a number of these nefarious characters in the associated Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker set coming out later this month.</p>

<p>All three of the set's bandit figures first appeared in print as specific lieutenants of the sinister Stag Lord (whose figure I showed off in the previous blog), but can easily stand in for any number of more generic baddies at your table. So while some may know them as Kressle, Dovan from Nisroch, and Auchs, their common rarity means that they can just as easily represent a whole band of Stolen Lands bandits, shadow rogues, or River Kingdoms ruffians (respectively). All three are humans, and thus stand on Medium bases.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-stolenlandsbandit.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-stolenlandsbandit_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-shadowrogue.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-shadowrogue_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-riverkingdomsruffian.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-riverkingdomsruffian_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Despite being river pirates, these highwaymen do most of their robbing on the roads that wind their way through the forests and plains of the Stolen Lands, and as such need places to lie in wait for their unsuspecting victims. The set's final piece of set dressing serves as just such a hiding spot! While it might seem unassuming on its own, the large bush figure can easily become deadly if you put the right threat behind it. It's got a relatively flat top as well, so you should have little trouble putting a figure atop the plant to represent that it's literally popping out of the foliage.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-bush.png"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-bush_360.png"></a></div>

<p>Finally, we need someone to keep these common criminals in line and bring them to justice. And who better to do that than the paragon of lawful neutrality herself, Pathfinder: Kingmaker's own Valerie. A rare Medium figure, Valerie makes a great PC miniature or NPC general, and her lack of specific insignia on her shield or livery means she can serve as both ally or enemy without looking like she's wearing some other soldier's armor.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-Valerie.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181019-Valerie_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20181018-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20181018-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181018-Niobe.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181018-Niobe_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">A while back, our friends at Stranger Comics, creators of the Niobe comic, launched a Kickstarter that had a reward level that included a limited-edition Pathfinder book that brought the world of Niobe into the Pathfinder rules, allowing fans of the comic and character to play within the fantasy world of Asunda. They recently launched a second Kickstarter, with the finished Pathfinder book including exclusive new art. I sat down with Sebastian A. Jones, Niobe's creator, and talked about roleplaying games and their inspiration on the world of Asunda.</p>

<p>Here's what Sebastian had to say:</p>

<blockquote>

<h2><i>What are your previous roleplaying game experiences that were an inspiration for Niobe?</i></h2>
<p>Dare I show you my LARP outfits over the years?</p>

<p>Honestly, I found Niobe, or perhaps she found me, some thirty years ago amidst my adolescent fears hidden under the invisibility cloak of being too cool for school. People tend to see through that crap - she did.</p>

<p>Niobe would soon reflect my own ambitions, rage, and whatever raw emotions I was feeling. As I grew, she grew with me, a mirror of my own design and desire. A being of darkness and light, she would make the fantasy world of Asunda I was creating a better place, no matter the cost. As an outlet for Niobe and her world I created Stranger Comics, where I could tell her stories as well as other tales of conflicted characters. She was first introduced in <i>The Untamed</i> painted by Peter Bergting (<i>Lord of the Rings</i>), dubbed a "Frazetta Western," and then <i>Niobe: She is Life</i> coauthored by Amandla Stenberg (<i>Hunger Games</i>) and now... she is about to be deified in Pathfinder! (All of which are available <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1182319554/niobe-returns-in-erathune-she-is-death-and-essessa?ref=user_menu">on our current kickstarter</a>, titled <i>Niobe Returns</i>).</p>

<p>I mostly GM'd, so sculpting Asunda was a constant. MERP and Rolemaster, First and Second Edition D&amp;D, and a healthy dose of wielding foam swords kitted out in my Mum's bathrobe. (I did eventually level up to thrift store attire).</p>

<p>The stories (campaigns) I wanted to tell always had grand world changing underlying plots, but the seasonal arcs reflected what we would go through&mdash;the pain and beauty of coming of age, revenge vs. redemption, love vs. lust, and so on. I was usually inspired by my personal life and creators across all genres ranging from Kurosawa to Kirby, John Lennon to John Coltrane. How could we translate an emotional connection to gaming was important, so being in character was second nature, but I don't want to sound all melodramatic - we had a boat load of fun!</p>

<p>It also was apparent as a young mixed kid, that there were little to zero characters that reflected folks of color in these worlds I played in, unless they were a fetish sidekick, an obligatory dark elf, or the easily seduced Umbar in Middle Earth. And the stories told, as amazing as they were, well, I wanted them to reflect not only a global audience, but the duality of sinner and saint within us all.</p>

<p>That is who Niobe is, half angel, half demon. The chosen one. And anyone can be her, all they have to do is pick up the sword.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181018-Untamed.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181018-Untamed_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<h2><i>What are you most excited to see translated into Pathfinder?</i></h2>
<p>All of it! I think the new races and feats that have been with me, Darrell, Josh, and the rest of the Asunda crew&mdash;to be able to experience them in an official Pathfinder game setting (<i>no house rules lol!</i>) is such a dream. Paizo are kicking ass with their designs on everything, I can't wait for folks to also share their own experiences in the same world, it has me geeked out. To everyone reading this, please check out the Esufey race&hellip; our elemental first born fairies, and of course Niobe's own paladinic type class, the paragon. Yeah, goosebumps.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181018-Erathune.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181018-Erathune_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<h2><i>Why did you choose Pathfinder for this project?</i></h2>
<p>From a mechanic perspective I have played a lot of systems, and Pathfinder seems to have nailed down the perfect harmony of simple to complex. You can mold the character you want to play, in any way shape and form, while maintaining originality in a well-balanced gaming world. I love it! From a social standpoint, I love how the team at Paizo clearly believes that representation matters in a most authentic way. So, Niobe's world of Asunda fits in perfectly.</p>

<h2><i>What are you most excited about seeing in the World of Niobe book?</i></h2>
<p>Niobe herself&mdash;and all of the people that can now be her. That is just badass.</p>

<h2><i>What from Erathune do you think would best fit in a roleplaying game?</i></h2>
<p>MOOOOOOOOOG!!! Moog Thrak Gorbak, our resident Ogre Queen, ain't pretty but she will jack you up if you tell her otherwise. She killed enough of us when we were gaming. My co-creator Darrell May is responsible for this tons-of-fun menacing masterpiece.</p>

<p>Erathune, which is also available now in oversized deluxe hardcover on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1182319554/niobe-returns-in-erathune-she-is-death-and-essessa?ref=user_menu">our Kickstarter</a>, is probably the most gamerish and RPGesque of all our Asunda titles (plus it has Niobe in it). Four issues of full-scale war bedlam between Macgrom (dwarves) and Grachukk (great orcs) should rattle any roleplayer's senses, plus it ties in all of our other titles&mdash;and all of this is set in the icy mountains of Herfang with art by Hyoung (<i>The Last of Us</i>) and Sheldon Mitchell (<i>Cable</i>, <i>Vampire Hunter D</i>).</p>

<p>Regarding the question, I think what Darrell has created as far as a full town setting above ground as well as below, with trade routes, surrounding Isinniel (elven) and Urzoth (barbarian) clans easily lends itself to any campaign. Plus, I am excited to finally show off Soul Sunder, King Buxton Stonebeard's legendary cursed axe of Madraq (<i>The Goddess of Death</i>).</p>

<p>Every item across our various books will have runes on them, it is up to you to translate. Every race has a story to tell, every town has a past, it is up to you to dive in and explore. So click the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1182319554/niobe-returns-in-erathune-she-is-death-and-essessa?ref=user_menu">Kickstarter link</a> and roll d'em dice.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Currently, we're finishing up development of the <i>World of Niobe</i> Pathfinder book and hope to have it in backers' hands very soon. I hope you all have enjoyed this glimpse into another world.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Welcome to the next installment in our series of blogs about the future of Pathfinder Society in the <a href="/pathfinderplaytest">second edition of Pathfinder</a>! Setting the course for Pathfinder Society in second edition is lot of work, but it's an exciting time too. After all, we get to pull together your feedback and ideas with the lessons we've learned to make a better campaign. In addition to considering the suggestions we've often heard over the years on the forums, in game stores, and at conventions, we launched a <a href="/community/forums/organizedPlay/playtest">series of sticky threads on the forums</a> about specific topics. Now, we're revising our biggest topics, starting with a <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9l?Future-of-Pathfinder-Society-Update">blog</a> that Tonya and I wrote at the end of September on tiers, level gain, and the structure of the <a href="/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide"><i>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</i></a>. Last week, John and Mike wrote a <a href="/community/blog/tags/organizedPlay">blog about boons and chronicle sheets</a>. If you missed either of those, I recommend checking them out. This week, we're tackling pregenerated characters.</p>

<p>Pregenerated characters (aka "pregens") wear quite a few hats in the Pathfinder Society campaign: they serve as the first characters for many new players, let people jump into games when they don't have a character of their own, and give people the chance to try out new character classes. Over the years, we've received a lot of feedback on the design of our pregenerated characters for Pathfinder Society. Those ideas shaped the design of the <a href="/pathfinderplaytest#downloads">pregenerated characters</a> for the Pathfinder Playtest.</p>

<p>Now that folks have had a chance to try out the new pregens, we'd like to hear from you about your experiences with them. Are they easy to understand? Are they effective? Are they fun to play? Do you have suggestions for improvement? To that end, we have a new pregenerated character survey, linked at the bottom of the blog.</p>

<p>The survey's last page is about the layout and organization of pregenerated characters. For that, we have 5 proposals, linked below. We chose 5th-level Seoni for these comparisons, not only because spellcasters have an extra section on their character sheets that any design will need to accommodate, but also because a higher-level character requires more space for rules. You can view all of the designs below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/y1z37wt1116x44l/Proposal%20A%20%28Portrait%29.pdf?dl=0"><b>Prop</b><b>osal A (Portrait)</b></a><b>:</b> This is a vertically aligned pregenerated character. It is similar to the pregenerated character released at the beginning of August. The largest change is that more information has been moved to the first page&mdash;most notably, Seoni's spells and equipment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j1p403b7clly9uo/Proposal%20B%20%28Landscape%29.pdf?dl=0"><b>Proposal B (Landscape)</b></a>: This is a horizontally aligned version of Proposal A. It has less open space, but the art fits more naturally on the page.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gf1oox9be07dajg/Proposal%20C%20%28Chronicle%20Sheet%29.pdf?dl=0">Proposal C (Character Sheet)</a>:</b> Some people have suggested that pregenerated characters use exactly the same character sheets as players will be using for their own characters. This version includes a scan of hand-filled copy of the latest Chronicle sheet to give a general sense of what that might look like, followed by the reference sheets from the landscape layout.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8y3fi8qbzgldoat/Proposal%20D%20%28Original%20Playtest%29.pdf?dl=0">Proposal D (Original Playtest)</a>:</b> This is the Playtest pregenerated character for Seoni that we released in the beginning of August.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3fgtrwxxaoovpi3/Proposal%20E%20%28First%20Edition%20Style%29.pdf?dl=0">Proposal E (First Edition Style)</a>:</b> This is the 4th-level pregenerated Seoni from the first edition of Pathfinder. We're including it as a baseline to see how well the new designs are improving on what we used before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd like to give a big shout out to Emily Crowell on the art team, who has done all of the layout work for the pregens for the Pathfinder Playtest, as well over 100 pregens for current version of Pathfinder Society. She does the vast majority of layout and art design for Pathfinder Society as a whole, and she's really awesome to work with. Thanks, Emily!</p>

<p>Finally, I want to talk a bit about surveys as a whole. This is now the third blog to ask for your feedback in surveys. This is because we are starting with the most important pieces of the campaign, the ones that we are planning to lock in place by the end of the year. With that in mind, giving us your results by <b>November 30th</b> will give you the best chance of having your voice heard as we push forward. While there may be more survey blogs in the future about critical topics (such as when we revisit the topic of factions), we do not plan to establish an ongoing model where we are asking you to fill in detailed surveys every week.</p>

<p>The first of these is the imposing smilodon, a saber-toothed tiger from the nearby Realm of the Mammoth Lords. This primordial feline takes up the entire base, and makes for a very intimidating opponent (or animal companion, if you like that sort of thing). The smilodon is an uncommon Large figure.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-Smilodon.png"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-Smilodon_360.png"></a></div>
	
<p>Since we're showing off some exceptionally large creatures, how about a big-ass frog? You'll be adventuring in the River Kingdoms, after all, and that means swamps and rivers and stuff. So I bet you'll be facing a few of these amphibious menaces. Despite their size, they remain frogs, so you should have no problem making them croak. The giant frog is a common Medium figure.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-GiantFrog.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-GiantFrog_360.jpeg"></a></div>
	
<p>Amphibians and reptiles are similar, right? I'm no biologist, so I think they're all just different levels of slimy&mdash;beasts I'd rather kill than touch. So we included a monitor lizard to kill (or touch, if you like that sort of thing). Based on new concept art for the Kingmaker CRPG, the purple monitor lizard is a common Medium figure.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-MonitorLizard.png"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181016-MonitorLizard_360.png"></a></div>
	
<p>Since I'm sure the comments are going to be full of slimy creature-lovers yelling at me for being mean, I'll distract you all by showing off a creature everyone likes: a swarm! Swarms are tough to do in miniature form, because they don't always take a square shape, and they are at their best when they are sharing a square with other creatures. That has resulted in many, many swarm figures looking more like bumpy coins than the creatures they're meant to represent. So we went with a more cinematic look for the army ant swarm, a common Medium figure, which is a 4-foot-tall mass of insects that have already stripped an earlier victim to the bone.</p>

<p>Finally, we need a skilled ranger to hunt or tame these beasts of the Stolen Lands, and who better to fill that role than the quiet archer, Ekundayo, from the <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em> CRPG. A Garundi native of Absalom, Ekun makes an excellent PC or ally mini, with his nocked arrow and sweeping cape. His rare rarity means he'll remain unique in most collections, making him stand out among the myriad bow-wielding ranger figures out there.</p>

<p>Just two more previews left before the set releases on October 24, so keep your eyes tuned to this spot in the coming days. Until then, roll 20s and don't split the party!</p>

		<p itemprop="description">Today, we're happy to release an alternate version of the item Resonance system for testing using the <a href = "/products/btpya1y4?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-2-Raiders-of-Shrieking-Peak"><em>Raiders of Shrieking Peak</em></a> adventure and an encapsulated set of rules. So, how did we get to this release, how do you use it, what's different, and what do we expect out of it?</p>
	
		<h2>The Survey Data</h2>
		
		<p>First, let's talk about what our survey data has shown us. All the surveys you've been filling out during the playtest process have helped us immensely, and the Rules Survey in particular is telling us a lot about how the rules are being received. The Rules Survey asked quite a few questions about the Resonance system. As you can probably tell from some of the questions on that survey, we looked at things people in the community were already saying to gauge how widespread those sentiments really were. For example, we had seen a lot of people comment that they thought it didn't make sense for potions to cost Resonance Points, so we included this in the survey to gather more information. The results so far show that 55% of respondents have said that while it makes sense that other items cost Resonance, it doesn't make sense for potions. (26% have said it doesn't make sense that <i>anything</i> costs Resonance.)</p>
		
		<p>The main set of questions we asked about Resonance showed us pretty strongly that Resonance as printed was highly unpopular. Few people thought characters had the right number of points, there was too much tracking, the rules on overspending weren't engaging, and only about 20% of respondents thought the system was a clear improvement over First Edition. When introducing a <i>new</i> system, it's especially important that the system be seen as a clear improvement, or it's not pulling its weight.</p>
		
		<p>However, not all of the feedback was negative. The rules had good ratings on being easy to understand, and there was strong support (both in the surveys and in forum posts we've been seeing) for Resonance as a way to make it easier to track multiple-use items. Though we didn't ask about it directly in the survey, we've also seen solid support for a more flexible system of worn items compared to First Edition's item slots. So, the new iteration of the Resonance system looks to expand on these few elements that were well liked, while reducing the elements that felt like burdens.</p>

		<h2>How to Test Resonance</h2>
		
		<p>I'm going to go into plenty of detail on why we're testing the changes we are, but some of that info is also in the test document. So, if you want to just get on with it and pick up the file, here's how.</p>
		
		<p>To test the new Resonance system, you'll need to download two files: the adventure <em>Raiders of Shrieking Peak</em> and the Resonance Test file. The adventure is the same as the preexisting Pathfinder Society Playtest Scenario (and as we've mentioned before, you can run either version in Pathfinder Society for credit). The Resonance Test file contains the rules for this alternate system, design notes on our intent with various rules, lots of new versions of items, the pregenerated characters to use in the adventure, and a short GM section with the few thematic adjustments you need to make to the adventure and items that appear in the adventure.</p>

		<p style = "clear: both;">When you're done, go to the <a href = "https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPResonanceTest" target = "_blank">Resonance Test Survey</a> and tell us what you thought! This survey will give you questions depending on whether you ran it, played in it, read it, or any combination thereof. We expect this survey will remain open till the end of the year like the other surveys.</p>
		
		<h2>The Changes</h2>
		
		<p>So what did we change? As we said from the outset, the Resonance Points system in the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> was highly experimental, and it was clear that experiment had failed. Jason quite correctly pointed out that we needed to show where our line of thinking is going in the wake of this and solicit additional feedback&mdash;telling everyone to wait for the final rules isn't enough. Hence, this new experiment takes what we learned from play and the surveys and takes a crack at something we think is more interesting and flexible, and that we hope you feel the same way about. Much of what I'm about to say here is replicated in the document, and just included here to give you the full perspective.</p>
		
		<p>This test is checking to see whether some version of the system is satisfying. Resonance has its roots in concepts that appeared in First Edition through the occultist class, resonant powers between certain magic items, and several other places in the lore. Is there something valuable in the idea that items can be made stronger though the user's strength of personality and essence?</p>
		
		<p>First off, let's clarify that while the term "Resonance Points" is still in the document, that's not what's being used to activate items any more (we'll get to those in a bit). Instead, Resonance Points are just to track your capacity to wear items. This aspect of Resonance had a favorable response, and so we're hoping to maintain the flexibility of item choice that comes with removing item slots. However, the point value for Resonance is now different. You get 10. At 1st level, at 20th level. This is because when we use Resonance for just worn items, we're only looking to prevent extreme cases of abuse and discourage extreme item loadouts. For most characters, 10 worn items is plenty. Think of it like Bulk, where the number is high enough that characters rarely need to worry about it unless they have extremely low Strength or they try to carry way too much.</p>
		
		<p>As for getting more out of items, that's where Focus Points come in. This new pool unites two similar concepts: the extra spells you could cast via Spell Points and the extra energy you could put into magic items to get more out of them (think of this along the lines of the occultist's focus powers or the Charisma-based Use Magic Device skill from First Edition). Unlike Spell Points, all characters have Focus Points, and your number per day is equal to your Charisma modifier plus 1 or 2, depending on your ancestry. You can spend a Focus Point to cast a power (in the Resonance Test, this is a cleric's domain power or a sorcerer's bloodline power), or can spend a Focus Point when activating an item to improve its effect.</p>
		
		<p>Notice I said <i>improve</i> it. In this test, items don't normally cost anything to activate. If you use a scroll or drink a potion, you spend nothing but the consumable itself. You can activate your <i>bracers of missile deflection</i> once per day, spending nothing to do so. What you get out of spending a Focus Point depends on the item: A healing potion doubles its healing, the <i>bracers of missile deflection</i> can be activated again, the splash damage from an <i>alchemist's fire</i> has a bigger area, and so on. One of my favorite little distinctions is the <i>invisibility potion</i>. If you only need to move into a combat and make an attack while invisible, you can drink the potion to get 1d4 rounds of invisibility. However, if you have a lot of sneaking around to do before you plan on fighting, you can extend the effect to 10 minutes instead by spending a Focus Point!</p>
		
		<p>The pool of Focus Points doesn't grow as huge as the Resonance Point pool did, since your level isn't added to it and, unlike Spell Points, you don't get more points when you take new powers. The goal here is to make each use of Focus more exciting and interesting. When someone spends a Focus Point, it should be a capital-M Moment. One of the overall goals for the Second Edition is to make your individual decisions during play more impactful and exciting, with fewer set routines. The printed version of Resonance didn't do that, and we're hoping Focus Points give you something exciting to look forward to rather than a chore to carry out. If you look at the cleric and sorcerer powers from the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> compared to the ones in the Resonance Test, you'll see that they got stronger, because they now cost a more precious resource.</p>
		
		<p>I want to address a couple concerns briefly. One is that classes that thematically should have a decent number of Focus Points will be left out if the pool is Charisma-based. We expect that these classes would have solid methods to adjust their number of points. For instance, a wizard might get some points each day from his arcane focus, or a ki-using monk might meditate to refresh some Focus Points. However, we'd be looking at these remaining Charisma-based, so a wizard who wants to increase Charisma gets a Focus Point benefit from it just like a fighter would. The other concern is that we're weakening items to make room for these Focus Point abilities, such as the shorter duration for the <i>invisibility potion</i> mentioned above. Some of the baseline effects of these items are weakening for another reason. Namely, when removing the Resonance Point requirement for activation, we do need to rein in some of the baseline abilities, since now money is the only limit on how often you can use them. The Focus Point additions are on top of this adjusted baseline power, and if they were removed, the base items would <i>not</i> end up as strong as they are in the current printed version of the book, when they cost a Resonance Point each time.</p>
		
		<p>Will having Focus Points be entirely optional satisfy people's desires for a different system? Will the folks who said spending Resonance on items doesn't make sense think any differently now that Focus is an addition that allows characters to gain more power or benefit out of their items? Will a substantial number of people think that it's a cool system, but that there's still too much bookkeeping? That's what we'll be looking for you to tell us in the survey and your comments.</p>
		
		<h2>The Long Term</h2>
		
		<p>So, if this test (or parts of it) goes well, what can you expect the long-term changes to be? First off, we need to be clear: Regardless of what people think of the system, there's just no way, logistically, to implement a full change within the playtest period. We might&mdash;and I stress <i>might</i>&mdash;be able to put out some more samples or previews of where we think we're going, and possibly even guidelines to adapt the printed Resonance system further, but you won't be seeing a total rewrite of the rules.</p>
		
		<p>It's also unlikely that the final items in the book or the final system rules will look exactly like what you see in the Resonance Test, even if the test goes great. Opening up more free magic might necessitate some other changes once players would gain unbounded access to crafting magic items. For example, wands, staves, or scrolls might need to be a higher level or more expensive. And if we get feedback that the Focus Points system should be scuttled entirely, an item like a wand might need to go still higher regardless. We're going to try and minimize that as much as we can, though! Keeping magic items magical and coming to your character when their abilities are still useful is hugely important, and we don't want to go from one system that feels too restrictive to another that feels restrictive, just in a different way.</p>
		
		<p>Some of the terminology and presentation of the rules might change too. "Resonance Points" might make a little more sense if phrased in a different way, such as an interference field that builds up from 0 to a limit of 10 rather than points you spend from 10 down to 0&mdash;for the purposes of this Resonance Test, some of the wording was just kept intentionally close to the printed text so it's easier to understand and compare for readers who've been keeping up with the playtest from the start.</p>
		
		<p>We can say with confidence that the printed rules in the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> won't be in the final version of the book as is. The Resonance Test is an experiment to see whether there's still an interesting idea in there. The most extreme case we might end up with looks more like Pathfinder First Edition, with something like the items you see in the Resonance Test, but with no extra benefits for spending Focus Points.</p>
		
		<p>And all this, of course, relies on you and what you have to say. We deeply appreciate all the time you've put into playtesting this game. If you have time to playtest the Resonance Test, that's fantastic! The playtest schedule is tight, and if you only have time to give the test a read but not to play, that's also so, so helpful. We look forward to hearing more from you as you lament the fates of your characters, struggle against the clock, achieve the impossible, punch holes in the rules, and click through another set of surveys. From Jason, Stephen, Mark, and me, thank you all!</p>

<p itemprop="description">Howdy! Joe Pasini here, Starfinder developer and monstrous humanoid. One of my favorite things about Starfinder is that it's chock full of alien creatures that you can not only crush, kill, and destroy, but also befriend, bedazzle&mdash;and become!</p>

<p>Today we'll meet a few of the 16 new playable species presented in <span><i><a href="/products/btpya20r?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-2">Alien Archive 2</a></i></span>, along with notes from their writers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Careful readers of the Starfinder Core Rulebook might have noticed a brief write-up in the setting chapter about Daimalko. On that blasted planet, horrific colossi have rampaged among the ruins of two once-great civilizations since an event called the Awakening. The survivors&mdash;the damai&mdash;have turned to empathic leaders and their powerful magical orbs to keep these roving beasts away. That planet is one of my strange little Starfinder children, and in Alien Archive 2, I had the privilege of dropping another piece of Daimalko into the game&mdash;now you can play a damai! When you do, your racial traits will reflect these people's time subsisting in underground caverns, as well as their now-innate survival senses. For those interested in Daimalkan lore, the write-up also includes the story of Reirali Kokolu, the first Guardian who both discovered the orbs linked to the colossi and united the disparate pockets of survivors into the pseudocivilization that exists on the planet today. If Daimalkan lore&mdash;or kaiju survivors, empaths, or scrappers&mdash;are your thing, playing a damai might be right up your alley!</p>
<p>&mdash;Amanda Hamon Kunz, Managing Developer</p>

<p>I wrote about Orry, the home planet of the phentomites, in the Starfinder Core Rulebook. The location was inspired by a homebrew Runequest game I played over a decade ago, where the players and GM worked together to collaboratively create an original setting. It was a thrilling creative exercise for everyone, and though we only played that game a handful of times, the experience has stuck with me. Of course, we pictured humans exploring this world's floating islands, but when you adapt something for a science-fantasy game, you get to make things a little more&hellip; alien. While they weren't named or described in the Core Rulebook, the inhabitants of Orry were illustrated, and I had a hand in that as well. When it came time for Alien Archive 2, I pitched giving these folks full stats and a bit more information about their home world and culture. Now that they are fully entrenched in the Starfinder canon, I just hope I can expand further on the phentomites at some point in the future!</p>

<p>I did the embri! In the spirit of honesty, I hadn't even noticed these mollusk-people tucked in the Starfinder Core Rulebook at first. But I discovered their write-up was really evocative: it starts with their eerily orderly society, then reveals that Hell is behind it all. Cue the ominous music! I tried to keep the same themes in my <i>Alien Archive 2</i> entry, but I had to think more about embri masks. Why do these emotionless critters wear them? Probably as identifiers, but maybe also because showing even a little bit of emotion is exceptionally rude in their society, so they're socially expected. I thought about giving the ubiquitous masks some game benefit, but ultimately went the other direction&mdash;not wearing a mask makes an embri feel exposed and dangerously expressive, so they take penalties when not wearing one. If you play an embri, you'll want to keep your mask in place. The <i>hivemask</i> magic item helps you work well with your teammates&mdash;and keep a close eye on them!</p>

<p>Hi! I wrote bolida and osharu. The bolida were my attempt at the molefolk trope&mdash;except instead of being inspired by adorable rodents, they're horrifyingly gigantic centipedes, 'cause why not! They otherwise stay true to the trope: a hardy, subterranean people who minded their own business deep underground for centuries. They didn't really care (or even know?) about the outside world until they were discovered by accident. The osharu were quite shamelessly inspired by the Bajorans from Star Trek. I was enamored of the idea of a spacefaring society whose religion takes the forefront in their culture. The osharus' cities were actually inspired by my daily commute through a pretty much town-sized college campus. I thought it would be interesting to have metropolis-sized settlements composed entirely of different departments of learning, where everybody worked together for a common cause (in this case, scientific and spiritual enlightenment). I must admit it was intimidating writing two races and cultures from scratch, with no previous material to use! I hope y'all enjoy my additions to the Starfinder universe!</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20181012-Quorlu.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20181012-Quorlu_180.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Mary Jane Pajaron</i></div>

<p>Design of the quorlus is rooted in history and novelty. My assignment was to create a unique quadruped species that's not like a centaur. Long ago, I really loved dralasites&mdash;a species of little, shapeable blobs who could have multiple legs. (They're from the Star Frontiers RPG.) I started with bloblike, and then decided to use environmental extremes. What if quorlus adapted to harsh tectonics? From that came the silicon-based physiology and geothermic nature, along with no need to breathe. It also sparked a culture of practical, skilled engineers and miners who find it easy to accept loss. The seismic violence of the quorlu home world instilled within them a spirit of cooperation and love of peace. I also decided quorlu voices must be highly resonant, carrying through earth and stone (and quorlu "flesh") rather than air. A short leap led to the idea that other species might find these sonorous voices pleasing. Then, I integrated them with Pact Worlds species as ideal explorers and surveyors of harsh environments. That's the quorlu, in a lithic shell.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20181012-OniKanabo.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20181012-OniKanabo_180.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Raph Lomotan</i></div>

<p>I'm responsible for adding the kanabo, which are oni (ja noi)/hobgoblin crossbreeds. I wrote up the kanabo in Distant Shores for Pathfinder, and I thought that as a species of mystic outsider goblinoid warriors they were perfect for the science-fantasy feel of Starfinder. Of course since we haven't introduced either oni or hobgoblins to the Starfinder universe yet, I had to write both of those up for the book as well. That meant establishing what hobgoblins are like in the universe after the Gap, and if ever there was a group that seemed well-suited to the risks to pre-Drift space travel, the ruthless, organized hobgoblins fit the bill. That allows them to have spread far and wide from their origins on Golarion. With that in place, having ja noi be oni champions embraced by nations of expansionist hobgoblins gives a strong background for what kanabo origins are likely to be. Both hobgoblins and kanabo are available as PC races.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Part 3 of the <a href="/returnoftherunelords">Return of the Runelords Adventure Path</a> is on its way, and with it, the situation for Varisia in this latest Pathfinder Adventure Path kicks into high gear. Just in case there are potential players of the campaign checking this blog post out, I'll refrain from getting too "spoilery" about things, but one of my favorite parts about this Adventure Path lies in the fact that it's a sequel. This allows us to not only make some assumptions about characters we've established in prior adventures and campaigns, but lets us have old favorites, be they friends or foes, come back to enjoy some time in the limelight one more time. Folks have doubtless already noticed a few familiar faces in the first two adventures, be they Pathfinder agents or Vancaskerkin agents, but with the third adventure, Richard Pett's <i>Runeplague</i>, one of these older NPCs is getting more than a cameo role.</p>

<p>The last time we saw Clegg Zincher, he was having a real bad day on the small isle of Devil's Elbow just south of Riddleport. In <i>Runeplague</i>, we find out that his mis-adventures during the Second Darkness Adventure Path were but the start of a long, downward spiral into trouble. Once a significant mover and shaker in Riddleport's government, Clegg's prior clash with a group of heroes has left him in hard times. Now, as the PCs will learn in this adventure, Clegg's in more trouble than ever, even if he doesn't realize it, and rather than face the PCs in battle he's going to have to rely upon them for salvation!</p>

<p>In <i>Runeplague</i>, though, we don't just go to Riddleport. I challenged Richard Pett with a tall order&mdash;"Write me an adventure where the PCs go to all four of the significant cities of Varisia&mdash;Magnimar, Riddleport, Korvosa, and Kaer Maga." He knocked it out of the proverbial park, with each of this adventure's four parts having a very distinct feel and theme. All of which builds to a climax that, I suspect, some folks won't see coming!</p>

<p>In closing, I'll leave one more cryptic hint&mdash;there's another reason I wanted Richard Pett to write <i>Runeplague</i>. The time was right, after all, for another favorite villain from the past to rise once more!</p>

<p>But I promised to keep the spoilers as light as possible. So let me just close by showing off some cool art from <i>Runeplague</i>!</p>

<p itemprop="description">Since the beginning of the year, many of our organized play meetings have revolved around the <a href="/pathfinderplaytest">second edition of Pathfinder</a> in one way or another&mdash;especially since we launched <a href="/community/forums/organizedPlay/playtest">a series of sticky threads asking for your feedback</a>.

We began <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9l?Future-of-Pathfinder-Society-Update">revisiting those topics in blogs</a> last month with Linda's and Tonya's examination of tiers, level gain, and the structure of the <a href="/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</a>. This week we're exploring two related topics: boons and Chronicle sheets.</p>

<h2>Boons in Second Edition</h2>
<p>Boons were one of the first elements I brought up in the very first Pathfinder Society playtest blog because they're so important to so many people. At the time, I brought up the boon format used in Starfinder Society, which provides a character six fixed slots: Ally, Faction, Personal, Promotional, Social, and Starship. Just after the mission briefing, a player can activate one boon of each type, representing the favors she's calling in, the special equipment she's requesting, the faction she's actively representing, or the non-combatant friend that she's bringing along. In addition, there are some slotless boons that represent obligations, reminders, and other extras that we don't want taking up a space or feeling optional (e.g. "Oh, you're out of luck, Mr. Villain, for I didn't slot my 'Mr. Villain will get his revenge' boon today!").</p>

<p>From a design perspective, we've been really happy with Starfinder Society's model. It helps us make informed decisions about scenario power level knowing that each PC only has a handful of upgrades not normally assumed in the RPG, rather than having several dozen upgrades. This is even more important in Starfinder than it is in Pathfinder RPG's first edition because the former has fewer bonus types and thus tighter math, so it behooves us not to throw off the math too much by inundating players with modifier-altering boons. The same is true for Pathfinder's second edition, and we have the same concerns about providing so many campaign bonuses that the gameplay or character design feels drastically different from a "classic" game.</p>

<p>That's nice in theory, at least. At this point, we've had more than a year to see the Starfinder Society boon system in action, and I've been following <a href="/threads/rzs2ux64?Boons">the boons discussion thread</a> since it began. There are really mixed feelings about boon slots. Some people really like them, in some cases even citing the balance-related reasons above. Some folks feel that the boon slots are too restrictive, preventing someone from using a boon on the fly that they may have kept in their back pocket. For others, the boon slots are confusing or cumbersome, and I've read some very cross commentary that slotting boons just after the mission briefing breaks immersion or grinds play to a halt. For others still, the concept of slotless boons seems very jarring, as though including slotless boons undermines the concept of boon slots as a whole.</p>

<p>In compiling the messageboard feedback and discussing this with the rest of the team, we see three primary ways forward: typed boon slots, universal boon slots, and limited boons. For each of these, there's still a good chance that we'd tag each boon with a type (e.g. Ally or Social) because it provides more design space for us later (e.g. an assassin kills one of your Ally boons&mdash;how morbid).</p>

<ul>
<li>In the <b>Typed Boon Slots model</b>, Pathfinder Society's boon system would look a lot like that of Starfinder Society. We would swap out one or more of the boon types (e.g. Starship) for something more befitting the setting and system. For example, we might have a Relic slot that's for especially strange or special gear (like an intelligent weapon), a Downtime slot that provides special uses of the downtime mechanic in second edition, or a Legacy slot that references some reward from a different campaign (like something carried over from first edition or earned in the Adventure Card Guild).</li>
<li>In the <b>Universal Boon Slots model</b>, a PC would still have a limited number of slots; however, there would be no Ally boon slot, Social boon slot, or the like. Instead, every slot would be equal. Do you want to slot a pile of Ally boons? Sure. Want to have several Downtime benefits at once? Go for it. Want to represent several factions at a time, gaining all of their benefits? Okay, that would theoretically be possible, even though we haven't worked out quite what it would mean to champion multiple factions simultaneously. Whatever mix of boons you'd want to use, you could do so with universal boon slots. My suspicion is that this would also be a little easier to manage with boon slotting during an adventure, for it would be easier to have a default array of boons that a player tweaks as necessary based on the adventure.</li>
<li>If we don't go with boon slots, we really have to consider a <b>Limited Boons model</b> to rein in the potential for mechanical bloat&mdash;the gradual increase in character power as more options or rewards become available. Limited boons could translate as awarding roughly the same number of boons as in first edition yet with each boon doing less, yet that's not a terribly fun approach; I can already hear some folks quipping that some First Edition boons are too weak as is. Instead, a Limited Boons model would be one in which boons are overall rarer so that their likelihood of stacking in a disruptive way is reduced. On the other hand, this wouldn't involve boon slots at all. The main complication is what happens to "convention boons," the incentives distributed at conventions, special events, and game days participating in the Regional Support Program. If boons are more rare overall, does that risk making convention rewards overly potent? No doubt we could find a solution, but it's one more hurdle.</li>
</ul>

<p>What does this mean for slotless boons? Well, there would likely still be some form of Chronicle sheet tracking for events that we want to reference later, but depending on the Chronicle sheet format (see Mike's section below), there might be a means to record some of that in a non-boon format. That way, when you earn the "Grandmaster Torch's cat always hisses at you" outcome, you might not need a boon to remember it; it might instead appear in the adventure summary.</p>

<p>As an aside, one of the fun considerations to come out of our boon slot discussions was the idea of Events, which are ongoing situations that last for one or more scenarios. During the event (or at its end), some special effect would take place. For example, an investment might mature and give you extra gold at the end of an event, or you might earn the assistance of someone important for only a limited time. A Voluntary Event would be one that you could activate between scenarios, but it would likely occupy a boon slot during that time. A Forced Event would be one that happens whether you intended it or not, such as being the subject of negative propaganda that haunts your character for three scenarios&mdash;all the while taking up a boon slot. I'm mostly bringing these up as a possibility, and if it's something we want to explore more, we'll likely do so in an upcoming blog.</p>

<p>All told, there are lots of possibilities, and they intersect in many places with our exploration of Chronicle sheets. Michael Sayre takes it from here.</p>

<h2>Chronicle Sheets</h2>
<p>In addition to the threads we've opened to gather feedback from the community, we've worked internally to find solutions that can make Pathfinder Society more accessible, affordable, and interesting. I'll be discussing some of the proposals we have for what Chronicle sheets will look at in the new campaign and what goals the various styles are trying to address. Before I can do that to any meaningful degree though, you'll want to check out four different references: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/krlilq8f0nef33t/Proposal%201%20%28Single%20Full%20Sheet%29.pdf?dl=0">Chronicle sheet 1</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kuxgab42x9l3z21/Proposal%202%20%282x2%29.pdf?dl=0">Chronicle sheet 2</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/in9nuwfiibmzfmr/Proposal%203%20%283%20landscape%29.pdf?dl=0">Chronicle sheet 3</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pnsxjwo6vpcv1ah/Proposal%204%20%28Cardstock%29.pdf?dl=0">Chronicle sheet 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vzsw8wild9jvevb/Scenario%20Logsheet.pdf?dl=0">a sample log sheet</a>. I'll be referencing these below as well as in our Chronicle sheet survey.</p>

<p>One of the major goals we'd like to accomplish is maximizing the real estate on each Chronicle sheet, and we're looking to tackle that in a few different ways. First, most Chronicle sheets would present a single significant boon related to the adventure, as well as only small selection of magic items that would not commonly be available to players. Wealth would be evenly distributed across scenarios, rather than having the current situation that can occur where some adventures which give somewhat more wealth are preferable to play over other adventures that give somewhat less. Ultimately, if something appears on a Chronicle sheet, we want it to be significant and as broadly applicable as possible for the largest number of characters, though this doesn't mean we won't include particularly cool items that appeal more to (for example) fighters than wizards or vice versa when the adventure calls for it.</p>

<p>We quickly discovered that the community had all kinds of feedback on how Chronicle sheets are currently handled and what pieces of the Chronicle sheets people felt were pulling their weight and which were lagging behind. We also heard from a lot of event coordinators concerned with the growing costs of printing Chronicle sheets at events. In addition we're considering various proposals to allow players to experience stories in the manner most appealing to them, normalizing the value of Chronicle sheets in wealth, number and value of boons, and other areas across scenarios.</p>

<p>Chronicle sheet proposal 1 is the closest approximation to our current Chronicle sheet that we believe would be viable going into the new system. This full sheet style should be easily stored in a standard binder or character folio and has space for us to include a brief synopsis of the adventure in which you earned the Chronicle sheet, a small space for tracking purchases, and room for adventure-specific notes.</p>

<p>Chronicle sheet proposal 2 uses a 2-by-2, four-to-a-page style that should reduce costs for GMs and event coordinators who would normally be printing off 6 separate sheets of paper. Since this style only has room for a boon and item, it would need to be used in conjunction with the Scenario Logsheet (see the link above) or a similar tracking sheet.</p>

<p>Chronicle sheet proposal 3 features a 3-column, landscape oriented Chronicle sheet that gives us more room for boons and unique items while still reducing the print-load on GMs and event coordinators. This version would also require the Scenario Logsheet or a similar tracking sheet.</p>

<p>Chronicle sheet proposal 4 is a cardstock style sheet where each Chronicle sheet would be a single boon card. In this example we would generally not include magic items on Chronicles, unless the item was of Uncommon or greater rarity; instead Common rarity items would be broadly available based on your character's level. Beyond just the printing cost, though, this has the advantage of providing a smaller surface area that could let a player keep any slotted or active boons very accessible at the table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us know what you think of the new proposals, and which options you'd most like to use going forward! We're including a link to both the Boons survey and the Chronicle sheet survey here, each of which include optional free response sections.</p>

		<p>For a Pathfinder Battles set called "Kingmaker", we certainly haven't seen much in the way of kings, now have we? Well, this week's preview should address that oversight.</p>
		
		<p itemprop="description">First, we have the Stag Lord, a Medium uncommon figure, who is in charge of the Stolen Lands when the PCs first arrive to settle the region. A sadistic and cruel bandit king, the Stag Lord is the first major threat the Kingmakers must defeat before they can establish their own barony in the River Kingdoms.</p>

		<p>Humans aren't the only civilized creatures in the AP who have hierarchies and rulers, however, and goblins, lizardfolk, kobolds, and mites all have their own kings, queens, and chieftains the PCs must interact with. Heck, even giants have their own rulers, such as the Frost Giant Jarl, a Large rare figure perfect for recreating Amiri's <a href = "/community/blog/v5748dyo5la16?Meet-the-Iconics-Amiri">origin story</a>.</p>
		
		<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181009-GiantJarl.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181009-GiantJarl_500.jpeg"></a></div>
		
		<p>The players' only truly royal rival in the Kingmaker Adventure Path is King Irovetti of the neighboring River Kingdom of Pitax, who got his own figure in the <a href = "http://paizo.com/products/btpy9iyh?Pathfinder-Battles-Rusty-Dragon-Inn-King-Irovetti">Rusty Dragon Inn set a few years back</a>. Never one to fight his own battles if he can avoid it, Irovetti has employed the services of the intimidating, heavily armored Pitax Wardens to do his dirty work for him. The Pitax Warden is a Medium common figure.</p>
		
		<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181009-PitaxWarden.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181009-PitaxWarden_360.jpeg"></a></div>
		
		<p>No ruler worth her salt leaves it up to chance to secure her legacy, and no one is better suited for that task than Linzi, Halfling Bard, this week's featured companion from the Pathfinder: Kingmaker CRPG, out now on Steam and GOG! A Small uncommon figure, Linzi will be sure to offer her unique take on the events in your kingdom, whether you like it or not.</p>
		
		<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181009-Linzi.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181009-Linzi_360.jpeg"></a></div>
		
		<p>But what good is a king without a throne? The barbarian throne and raised dais, based on this iconic illustration from the Beyond Kingmaker article back in Pathfinder AP #36, are packaged individually as bonus set dressing, but were intended to work together. The throne fits most Medium figures (at least standing on its seat, but who's going to tell the king he has to sit?) and the dais can sport any number of set dressings at its apex, from the depicted throne to the <a href = "/products/btpy9puv?Pathfinder-Battles-Deadly-Foes-Book-of-the-Damned"><em>Book of the Damned</em></a> or any number of pieces from the <a href = "/products/btpy9p8l?Pathfinder-Battles-Crown-of-Fangs-Court-of-the-Crimson-Throne"><em>Court of the Crimson Throne</em></a> premium set. The dais has a flat cobblestone surface on the bottom as well, so even if you don't have something you want to put on the red carpeted top side, you can flip it over and have a weird stone table or platform for some ritual or elaborate trap or whatever other inventive encounter you come up with.</p>

		<p>Now, I don't want to give away any spoilers, but for those of you who are playing, make sure to touch base with your GM, as they have very special instructions for you as to how you should make your character for this dangerous mission!</p>

		<p>As a reminder to all of you playtesters out there, the surveys for all of the previous parts of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> are still open. Once you and your group have completed playing <em>Part 5, The Heroes of Undarin</em>, make sure to take the following surveys! Your feedback is vital in making sure we get the game right for its final release!</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;margin:2rem;"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP5PC" target="_blank">Player Survey</a> | <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP5GM" target="_blank">Game Master Survey</a> | <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP5OP" target="_blank">Open Survey</a></p>

		<p>If you have completed the <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> surveys, consider giving us your feedback in the general surveys for Ancestries, Classes, Rules, and the Bestiary. These surveys can be found on the <a href = "/pathfinderplaytest#playtesting">Pathfinder Playtest landing page</a>.</p>

		<h2>Update 1.4 - All About Ancestry</h2>
		<p>The past two weeks have been a real whirlwind for us in the design pit. In the two weeks since the release of Update 1.3, which brought some pretty big changes to the game, we've been hard at work on Update 1.4. While this one is much more modest in terms of scope, it nevertheless brings a pretty big change to your game: an overhaul of the ancestries!</p>

		<p>The one thing we've heard mentioned over and over (as well as in our <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPAncestry" target = "_blank">Ancestry Survey</a>) is that many of you felt like the ancestries weren't quite giving enough at 1st level. We also saw a number of responses saying that taking a feat to be a half-elf or half-orc was too steep a price to pay. This update makes changes to the way that ancestries work, while also giving you some additional high-level ancestry feats to use in your game!</p>

		<p>Starting with this update, when you make a character, you select not only an ancestry, but also a heritage from within that ancestry. Your heritage gives you additional physical characteristics based on your lineage, and your choice of heritage is in addition to the ancestry feat that you gain at 1st level. Half-elf and half-orc are now choices within the human heritage list, which means that you can play a character from one of these heritages, and still take a 1st-level feat from either of your parents as well!</p>

		<p>So go grab Update 1.4! Those new feats might just give your characters a shot in the arm for the upcoming challenges they must face in the horrible, demon-infested lands to the north!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After our initial experiences in <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">Part One</a> and <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9p?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">Part Two</a> of the playtest, it was time for part three and our first adventure by author Amanda Hamon Kunz. To set the atmosphere for the land of gothic horror, our GM decided to render the old mansion on vinyl and bring it to life with some custom pieces from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/geordiejohnstudios/">Geordie John Studios</a>. Having full access to the mansion in 3-D allowed us to better appreciate, explore, and eventually defend it. Then we surrounded our play area with candles, put on some dark music, and ventured out toward Sombrefell Hall on the shores of Lantern Lake.</p>

<h2>The Party</h2>
<p>In much the way part two had certain guidelines for character creation, part three had its own interesting challenge regarding party construction: a group in which every member had access to healing. With that before us, we tried to make heroes that fit into both the setting of Ustalav and conformed to the guidelines for part three, while still allowing ourselves the opportunity for some character customization. To add some mood to our interactions with each other, our GM decided that while our characters all had ties to the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, they didn't necessarily know each other very well. Exploring an old mansion by candlelight when we weren't completely secure with each other added tension, but we clicked well enough when combat broke out.</p>

<h2>Highlights From Affair at Sombrefell Hall</h2>
<p>The narrative structure of this part was entirely different from the first two. After the all-too-quiet build up we experienced while exploring the mansion, things exploded into frantic wave-by-wave action against undead. We rushed to build barricades along the mansion's key entry points, and things started to feel like the best mashup of both Pathfinder and Call of Duty: Zombies. Props to the author here, as tactical awareness was just as valuable as the dozen channels our clerics fired off.</p>

<p>Our first paladin of the playtest had a great showing, and it's hard to select a single highlight out of her many: kill-stealing a wave of ghasts from the party, landing a couple of clutch retributive strikes, and standing toe-to-pincer with a brain collector at the end.</p>

<p>After several intense game hours of holding back undead, resources were starting to run low and our potential for error grew. Dan is laughing about a second stat like this, but a surprise appearance by an aberration leading the undead resulted in another <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkyn?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-4">"own goal" on his record</a>. Granted, he missed the identification roll, but Tinryl healed it nonetheless when trying to channel it down. The ungrateful brain collector returned the favor by dishing out two critical hits to the cleric in the same round: 105 damage.</p>

<h2>Character Deaths</h2>
<p>None. While we can chalk this up to the massive amount of healing power this party was packing, it can't go without mention that we played a tight game when it came to barricade placement.</p>

<h2>Current Situation</h2>
<p>What was supposed to be an information-gathering mission to contact a professor on sabbatical, became a five-hour scrap against a variety of undead and one of our best performances in recent years. We did lose an NPC, a research assistant who hid well enough in a bedroom--which happened to become a battleground. As we build characters for part four, despite this being a playtest we're too competitive with ourselves not to tally up our record: 2-1.</p>

  <h1>The Long Road to Sandpoint</h1>

<h1 itemprop="headline">The Long Road to Sandpoint</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday, October 4, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/20181004-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/20181004-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">I've made no secret of the fact that Sandpoint, the scene of the action in the first Pathfinder Adventure Path adventure, <i>Burnt Offerings</i>, was based in large part on my hometown of Point Arena, California. Some elements, such as the town dump consisting of "just throw your trash off the cliff into the ocean," huge cliffs surrounding a perfect little cove, the presence of a large theater in a relatively small town, or the mirror posted just outside of town that sports a sign asking visitors to see themselves as the townsfolk see them first are from Point Arena's real-world history. And then there's the fact that the town's original name translated roughly into "Sand Point"... although time and the tides have long since washed away the point bar of sand that once protected the harbor.</p>

<p>But most of Sandpoint came from my imagination, and that includes its diverse cast of citizens. In <i>Burnt Offerings</i> I was able to explore several of these characters and locations, but for many of Sandpoint's locals I was only able to scratch the surface. I never had room to go into full detail about the extent and dangers found in the old smuggler's tunnels below town, who's been leaving birthday presents for Rynshinn at Vernah's Fine Clothing, or exactly what drove Jervis Stoot to become a relentless serial killer, but that doesn't mean I didn't have an idea even at the time what was going on.</p>

<p>With <a href="/products/btpya21b?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Sandpoint-Light-of-the-Lost-Coast"><i>Sandpoint: Light of the Lost Coast</i></a> I can finally pull back the curtain and expose some, but not all, of Sandpoint's secrets. It was a blast finally getting to set these mysteries down on paper for others to explore, and just as fun to make my own discoveries along the way. I'd never given any thought as to what danger might lurk near the headwaters of the Turandarok River, for example, or figured out exactly why a ghost haunts Biston's Pond in the hinterlands. As I got to these locations and more while writing about them, their stories seemed almost to write themselves.</p>

<p>In fact, I wrote a lot more than I could ever fit into even a 96 page book. There's plenty more to find out about Sandpoint, and in time, and if I can pester the right folks to help make it happen, I'd love to present the nearby complex known as "the Pit" in the format of a deluxe adventure. I've already run this adventure once for several folks here at the office in my old <i>Shadows Under Sandpoint</i> campaign. Many of the elements of that campaign, from the Red Bishop to Pillbug Podiker's antics are direct results of that campaign.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's hoping that you all enjoy your upcoming visit to Sandpoint as much as I enjoyed setting the place up for you to explore! Have fun, enjoy the curried salmon and raspberry ale, and keep watching out for that pesky Sandpoint Devil!</p>

<p>PS: Check out what might be one of my favorite pieces of art we've ever published&mdash;a bird's eye view of the town itself! I can totally see my house from here!</p>

<p>Upon locating where the Azlanti are keeping the rune drive, the PCs must confront the scientists studying the ancient device, some of whom might even be sympathetic to the PCs' cause. (The Azlanti Star Empire doesn't exactly pay for overtime, after all.) As the PCs try to unravel the mysteries of the rune drive in hopes of either destroying it or using it, they are hounded by an elite member of the Aeon Guard and eventually face the Azlanti noble in charge of the entire operation! Will they survive to return to the Pact Worlds? Or will the Azlanti Star Empire be triumphant once again?</p>

<p>In addition to this gripping adventure, this volume features some ideas brought to you by Tracy Barnett of how you can continue this campaign after the last battle, including a way to bring the characters to our next 3-part Adventure Path, Signal of Screams. Incidentally, this article also features a combination of creature and artifact that makes me very happy.</p>

<p>Finally, apart from the usual array of new aliens and worlds, you can read all about the Stewards in this detailed article by Lyz Liddell. We're very excited to bring you information about this peacekeeping organization's history, leaders, and goals, which we have only touched on before now. You'll also find two new Steward archetypes to supplement the one we presented in Starfinder Pact Worlds!</p>

<p>As this brings us to the end of our first experiment into shorter Adventure Paths, we hope we enjoyed coming along with us for the ride. And if you want to see us try this abridged length again, please let us know!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">October Update—PAX Unplugged, Spotlights and Conventions!!</h1>

<p class="date">Wednesday, October 3, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">I just returned from Hurricon in Orlando, Florida. Two weekends earlier found me in the Twin Cities attending SkalCon and in two weeks I'll be on the Gold Coast of Australia attending PaizoCon Asia-Pacific. Lots of travel, but after this I'll only have two shows left in 2018. Around this travel, I'm still focused on catching up on the backlog of tasks and looking forward to convention planning for 2019. Paizo organized play is still on target to attend Origins, Gen Con, and PAX Unplugged 2019 in force, as well as support the multitude of conventions arranged by local teams.</p>

<p>Some of you noted on Facebook that we've been friends over social media for three years. September 28<sup>th</sup> marked my three-year anniversary with Paizo. Reflecting over my time spent in the OPC/OPM role, there've been some bumps in the journey, but my net sum is positive. Part of the reason for that involves our community! The past three years offered many chances to hang out with players and volunteers, meet new members of our community, and engage in some positive debate on the future of organized play. You energize me and help me look forward to the next three years. Here's to many more exciting adventures together!</p>

<h2>Campaign Coins</h2>
<p>While I travelled to Hurricon this past weekend and SkalCon a few weeks ago, I awarded no new campaign coins! One of the criteria used by the team and I when evaluating potential recipients are recommendations. For those individuals that submitted recommendations that haven't been acted on, rest assured I have them in a file and refer to them often.</p>

<p>If you know a deserving member of your community, please email me at <u><a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a></u> with their name, location, and the reasons you feel they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please include what events they may attend in 2018. This is especially helpful if they will be at an event with a member of the organized play team (see further down the blog for that list of events.)</p>

<h2>Stars and Novas</h2>
<p>A new month brings new GM additions to the 5-star roster. Huge congratulations to all those that achieved their fifth star over the past month!</p>
<p>To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Kudos on your achievement!</p>

<ul>
<li>Gerard van Konijnenburg</li>
<li>Geoffrey Peart</li>
<li>Quinn Shannon</li>
<li>Alex Bielke</li>
<li>Nick Oswald</li>
<li>Tristian Sullivan</li>
</ul>

<p>The organized play team formulated their first draft of the 5-nova qualifications and are soliciting feedback from a variety of sources. We should have an update next month!</p>

<p>Looking forward to Pathfinder Society version 2, I've seen suggestions for using either Glyphs (using the Symbol of the Open Road) or Sigils (using the Sihedrion) for the GM designator. Vote in the poll at the end of this blog</p>

<h2>PAX Unplugged</h2>
<p>Organized play is coming to PAX Unplugged! Led Venture-Captain Quinn Shannon, a team of volunteer GMs offer up Pathfinder Society, Starfinder Society, and Pathfinder Playtest for attendee enjoyment. We are doing warhorn.net preregistration for the first 4 seats at every table, with seats 5&amp;6 available for signup onsite daily from 8 am. We feel this is the best way for established players to know there is something they can play, but also allows for recruitment onsite. Registration opens October 26<sup>th</sup> at 10 am Pacific time. <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizo-org-play-pax-unplugged">Visit Warhorn</a> to register for games.</p>

<p>We also have a Paizo Booth on the floor running demos of Pathfinder Playtest! If you're at the event but not interested in a full game, stop by and try it out. If you are already part of the Playtest, feel free to come by and say hi!</p>

<p>Volunteers who completed the registration form, look for acceptance emails and scenario assignments before I leave for Brisbane mid-October. If you are interested in volunteering, we still have a few spaces available. To sign up, complete <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Winpf95cZt55SPJC2">this questionnaire</a>.</p>

<h2>Convention Listing</h2>
<p>Want to attend a convention in the next few months? Check out the list below! The list includes all the event support requests received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>

  <h1>The Makings of the Kingdom</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2018-10-02T21:00:00Z">Oct 2, 2018, 02:00 pm</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">One of the most popular and innovative elements of the original Kingmaker pen-and-paper campaign was the introduction of kingdom-building and -management elements to the standard hack-and-slash gameplay of the tabletop RPG experience.

<p itemprop="description">One of the most popular and innovative elements of the original Kingmaker pen-and-paper campaign was the introduction of kingdom-building and -management elements to the standard hack-and-slash gameplay of the tabletop RPG experience. Starting with the beginning of the second chapter, the players find themselves the rulers of a fledgling nation and are tasked with resolving conflicts, allocating resources, appointing trusted advisors, and even urban planning.</p>

<p>Players and Game Masters alike raved about the kingdom rules presented in the adventure path so much that we included them as a major section of <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</i> a few years later. When we realized that the system would be ported over to the CRPG format along with the rest of the adventure path in <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i>, we were excited to see how the folks at Owlcat adapted and expanded on the system.</p>

<p>Not only can you select what buildings and public works your capital will feature, but you'll be able to gather additional resources by uncovering hidden locations throughout the land during the course of your adventuring. Sit upon your throne, hear the pleas of your subjects, and decide upon their fate. How you resolve conflicts, who you select as your advisors, and whether you rule with an iron fist or a benevolent smile all influence your kingdom's destiny.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181002-UrbanPlanning.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181002-UrbanPlanning_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>While you're out adventuring&mdash;whether you're more a diplomat, monster hunter, or canny explorer&mdash;you can leave those companions not actively in your party to manage different aspects of the kingdom in your absence. Even non-companion NPCs can fill such roles as treasurer or general, so who you befriend and who you make enemies of can have farther reaching consequences than you might expect. Balance the right skills with the needs of your kingdom, keeping the alignments and temperaments of your proxies ever in mind, to ensure the vision of your kingdom comes to fruition!</p>

<p>Now that the game's been out a week (Cayden's cup, time flies, doesn't it?) many players are likely already starting to shape their own kingdoms. I'm already starting to see some really exciting results on my favorite Twitch streams, message boards, and even some coworkers' computer screens! What's your kingdom's story?</p>

<p itemprop="description">Hey there everybody. As of today, we're just about halfway through the spotlight period of the <i>Doomsday Dawn </i>adventure, and while we still have many months to go before the end of the playtest period, we've learned a lot in the past two months!</p>

<p>First and foremost, thank you for your participation! We could not do this without you. Your feedback has been vital in telling us where the game needs work, and we're looking forward to seeing what you uncover in the last parts of the adventure. I'd also like to take this opportunity to remind you that if you haven't played up through Part 3 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, you have nothing to fear. The surveys for all of the previous parts are still open, and there's still much more for us to learn from your input.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Goals?</h2>
<p>In the past few months, the design team has been on just about every different news and interview forum out there. We've talked about the changes we've made and why we made them. We've talked about where we wanted to go and why we wanted to take the game there; but in all the rush, we've realized that the one place where we haven't categorically stated our goals is right here, in this blog. So without further delay, here are our primary goals for the playtest.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new edition of Pathfinder that's much simpler to learn and play&mdash;a core system that's easy to grasp but expandable&mdash;while remaining true to the spirit of what makes Pathfinder great: customization, flexibility of story, and rules that reward those who take the time to master them.</li>
<li>Ensure that the new version of the game allows us to tell the same stories and share in the same worlds as the previous edition, but also makes room for new stories and new worlds wherever possible.</li>
<li>Work to incorporate the innovations of the past decade into the core engine of the game, allowing the best rules elements and discoveries we've made to have an integrated home in the new system (even if they aren't present in the initial book).</li>
<li>Forge a more balanced play environment where every character has a chance to contribute to the adventure in a meaningful way by allowing characters to thrive in their defined role. Encourage characters to play to their strengths, while working with others to bolster their place in the group.</li>
<li>Make Pathfinder a game that's open and welcoming to all, no matter their background or experience.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are plenty of other things that are important to us as we work to create a new edition of Pathfinder, but these points are some of our strongest motivators. I think it's important to note that these are guidelines and not necessarily listed in order of importance. Furthermore, a guideline might be more important in some parts of the game than it is in others. When making something this challenging, it's very useful to give yourself guiding principles, while also understanding that you're never going to be 100% perfect. In any case, for those of you who were interested in why the game has changed in the ways that it has, we hope that laying out our goals for the process can help you understand our decisions.</p>

<h2>MORE Surveys</h2>
<p>The surveys never end here at Paizo, and this week is no exception. We have been incredibly pleased by the results from the <i>Doomsday Dawn</i> surveys as well as the more general surveys we launched two weeks ago looking at <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9c?Ancestry-and-Class-Surveys">ancestries, backgrounds, and classes</a>. Today we'd like to open up two more general surveys.</p>

<p>The first is focused on the general rules for playing the Pathfinder RPG. This survey is a large one, going over a wide range of topics and touching on nearly every chapter in the <em><a href="/store/pathfinder/playtest">Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</a></em>. Set aside about an hour for this survey if you can, and make sure to go all the way to the end if you want your results to count.</p>

<p>The second survey takes a look at the monsters in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Bestiary</em>. We want to see what you thought about the stats in that PDF and how they were presented.</p>

<p>Well, that about does it for this week. Make sure to stop back in here next week for Update 1.4 and the start of Part 5 of the <i>Doomsday Dawn </i>playtest!</p>
