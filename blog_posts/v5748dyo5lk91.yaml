  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk8t?How-About-One-More-Ultimate-Deck\">revealing\
  \ the surprise fifth entry in our upcoming Ultimate Add-On Deck series</a>, and\
  \ now it's time to get back to evildoings. Remember when I showed you <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk6l>the three \" heroes< a> in </a><a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o\"\
  ><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em></a>? I'll bet you thought, \"Okay, these\
  \ guys are awful people. But I <i>get</i> them. Linxia's just the anti-Seelah; strong\
  \ and lawful but not at all good. Lazzero is Kyra with a downward-pointed star around\
  \ his neck. Urgraz is kinda like Oloch with his pounding things flat and his abilities\
  \ to 'help' his 'allies' with 'useful' tricks.\" And before you got too caught up\
  \ in all those air quotes, you thought, \"I'll bet the three characters in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9sjy\"><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 2</em></a> are gonna be\
  \ just like that.\"</p> \n    <p>I'mma go with a big \"No\" on that one, pally.\
  \ The next three characters you will meet are not like anything we've ever done\
  \ before. And the fact that they're willing to gut you like a trout makes them all\
  \ the more likable.</p> \n    <p>Let's start with Zelhara.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6824-ZelharaFront.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>She's got scars upon thars.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Zelhara is\
  \ an inquisitor just like Imrijka! Except in no way like Imrijka. Because Zelhara\
  \ is a straight-up torture fiend. Burying cards, shuffling other people's discarded\
  \ cards into her deck, making her companions discard their alliesâ€”Zelhara is a pincushion\
  \ of uncomfortable choices.</p> \n    <p>This whole deck is loaded with cards that\
  \ have the Corrupted trait. Zelhara is so corrupt that she barely knows the rules\
  \ for Corrupted cards exist. She doesn't even interact with the Redemption card\
  \ that's in the deck (or the one in Wrath of the Righteous). She just blasts by\
  \ all those penalties and clamps the thumbscrews to the world.</p> \n    <p>Oh,\
  \ also, Zelhara is into whips and chains. She's so good with those that she can\
  \ use her Divine skill to cut things to ribbons. Rolling Divine checks for weapons\
  \ is awesome. Especially when these cards are on the table:</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>Next, see this guy Emil? He's a pitborn, with a little bit\
  \ of Hell in him. <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk4h?A-Novel-Approach\">We've done\
  \ a pitborn character before</a>; what makes Emil special is he's our first-ever\
  \ assassin. Here's what that's like:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \

  ></a> \n     <p>Killing you softly.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Emil doesn't fight\
  \ anything unless he wants to, and can evade his encounters at the cost of <i>your</i>\
  \ cards. He can Harsk you from a distance. He can handle poisons like no one else;\
  \ burying cards to poison is what happens to other people.</p> \n    <p>And when\
  \ he turns into a bug-faced Red Mantis Assassin, he turns weapons into killing machines\
  \ without having to play them as weapons, which means no Harpy Monk is gonna ruin\
  \ his day.</p> \n    <p>Here are some cards Emil's going to want to have around:</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p>Reepazo called. She wants her mask back.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally,\
  \ we get to our first-ever kinda-undead character. Nyctessa is a dhampir, the offspring\
  \ of a vampire and a human. Lone Shark's editor Aviva recently told us all about\
  \ what happens in the <i>Twilight</i> novels when this occurs, and I tell you, Chad\
  \ and I have never been more horrified. Anyway, Nyctessa is many things, but <i>sparkly</i>\
  \ isn't one of them.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6824-NyctessaFront.jpg\"\

  \ in the style of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhem?Mikes-Best-Character-Ever-Darago\"\
  >my favorite character, Darago</a>. But Nyctessa is really, really good at it. She\
  \ hoovers up monsters and banishes not only them but allies and Corrupted cards,\
  \ which might be <i>your</i> cards if she's checked the right boxes.</p> \n    <p>Then\
  \ there's what might be the most interesting power in the whole box. Once per turn,\
  \ if Nyctessa would die, she doesn't. If she checks both boxes on that power, she\
  \ might siphon her discards when she's in dire straits. She's not invulnerable,\
  \ but she's way less vulnerable than most beings tend to be.</p> \n    <p>Plus she\
  \ does these things with those beings:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
