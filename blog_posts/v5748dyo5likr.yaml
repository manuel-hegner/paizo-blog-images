  \ first rules preview blogâ€”this time focusing on classes!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">The new class in <em>Ultimate Intrigue</em> is the vigilante. An upstanding\
  \ member of society by day and adventurer by night, the vigilante has two different\
  \ identities which can even have different alignments. Unless someone discovers\
  \ that the two identities are the same, divinations like <i>scrying</i> only work\
  \ when the vigilante is in the form the diviner is trying to scry. Each vigilante\
  \ chooses to be either a stalker, focusing on sneaking up on foes and punishing\
  \ them before the foe notices the stalker is there, or the avenger, focusing on\
  \ giving foes a more straightforward beatdown and gaining a full base attack bonus.\
  \ The vigilante class is extremely modular, with a talent option at every level,\
  \ switching off between social talents that give him an edge in social situations\
  \ and other intrigue hijinks out of combat, and vigilante talents, which generally\
  \ provide powerful combat options that he can use in either identity, though it\
  \ might give him away if people see him using them in his social identity.</p> \n\

  \      <br> <i>Illustrations by Tomasz Chistowski</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>If\
  \ you've been with us since the playtest, the biggest change is that zealot and\
  \ warlock are now archetypes, and while avenger and stalker each have some talents\
  \ that only that specialization can choose, many of the talents that seemed like\
  \ they fit the vigilante in general are now available to all vigilantes, as you\
  \ requested in the playtest. Also, you asked for social talents based on being a\
  \ craftsman or professional, and those are now available as well!</p> \n     <p>So\
  \ I mentioned that warlock and zealot (which were arcane and divine vigilantes for\
  \ those of you not part of the playtest) are now archetypes. All told, the vigilante\
  \ has <i>10 pages</i> of archetypes, the most that any class has ever received in\
  \ a book. After all, he has plenty of catch-up in order to match his older cousins\
  \ that have been around for more books. The brute has a hulking out-of control vigilante\
  \ identity, and he can't always stop the transformation when he's in danger. Cabalists\
  \ make blood pacts with dark patrons, gaining witch spells, blood powers, and a\
  \ familiar. Gunmasters bring justice with firearms, and they gain a bunch of deeds\
  \ as potential vigilante talents. The magical child archetype covers the \"magical\
  \ girl\" trope, with a transformation sequence ability (faster switch between identities,\
  \ but with flashy lights and music), summoner spells, and an otherworldly buddy.\
  \ Mounted furies are mounted vigilantes like Zorro whose steeds also have a secret\
  \ identity. Psychometrists are gadgetmasters and tinkerers who create personal occult\
  \ gadgets to do things like fly (basically creating gadgets that each perform a\
  \ single occultist focus power). Warlocks, are arcane casters from the magus list,\
  \ with elemental options and mystic bolts of energy. Wildsouls are vigilantes who\
  \ gain animalistic features in their vigilante identity. Finally, zealots are secret\
  \ champions of their faiths, often because their religion is outlawed or persecuted,\
  \ who cast from the inquisitor list and smite foes of one opposing alignment. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>But vigilantes aren't the only ones with archetypes. Exciting archetypes\
  \ for other classes include the tyrant (a lawful evil antipaladin archetype!), cardinal\
  \ (a politics-heavy cleric with 6 skill points per level), gray paladin (can be\
  \ one step from lawful good and smite any foe, but the lack of absolute conviction\
  \ makes many abilities less absolute), fey caller (unchained summoner that summons\
  \ a fey, with an all-new fey eidolon), zeitgeist binder (spiritualist that calls\
  \ in a local zeitgeist based on a settlement statistic like corruption or society),\
  \ battle scion (Celt/King Arthur blend skald that can call others to a quest and\
  \ go into a deathlike sleep to return some day), dandy (a courtly ranger with the\
  \ ability to manipulate rumors instead of wild empathy), vizier (a mesmerist that\
  \ has a \"power behind the throne\" ability to make it look like his allies are\
  \ the real threat while insidiously influencing them for his own agenda), feyspeaker\
  \ (a fey-themed druid with 6 skill points per level that casts using Charisma!),\
  \ and plenty more. In addition, the classes chapter two new inquisitions (Crime\
  \ and Secrets), three new ranger combat styles (deceptive, menacing, and underhanded),\
  \ four new rogue talents (follow along, shades of gray, hidden mind, and stalker\
  \ talent), an oracle mystery (Intrigue), and even five intrigue-themed kineticist\
  \ utility wild talents (earthmeld, flame trap, spying touchsight, greater voice\
  \ of the wind, and greater watersense).</p> \n     <p>Tune in next week to hear\
  \ more about some of the cool feats, spells, and magic items of intrigue!</p> \n\
