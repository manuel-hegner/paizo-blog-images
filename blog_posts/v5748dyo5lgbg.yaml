  articleBody\"> \n    <p>Caron woke in darkness.</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Stale smoke had brought her round. The only sound on the entire mountainside was\
  \ her own breathing. Her hands were tied behind her back. A cloth, damp with her\
  \ own saliva, was bound across her mouth.</span></p> \n    <p>Hands moved behind\
  \ her head. She felt them tugging at the knot that was caught in her hair. Instinctively,\
  \ she struggled against them.</p> \n    <p>\"Don't fight me, please.\" An old woman's\
  \ voice. Caron couldn't see anything.</p> \n    <p>Finally, the cloth blinding her\
  \ was tugged down from over her eyes and the gag was pulled free, leaving Caron's\
  \ mouth harsh and dry.</p> \n    <p>An old woman leaned over her.</p> \n    <p>Caron\
  \ stiffened, ready to fight for her life, but the woman shook her head and whispered\
  \ fiercely, \"Your husband went after the boy...\" She looked up toward the mountain.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The woman struggled with the ropes binding her wrists and feet together.\
  \ She wasn't working fast enough.</p> \n    <p>\"What were those things?\" Caron\
  \ rasped.</p> \n    <p>\"Shadow men,\" the woman said. \"Daemons to some. Old creatures\
  \ from the dark.\" She cut Caron's ties.</p> \n    <p>Keir had gone after Caleb.\
  \ He wasn't like her. He wasn't a fighter. He was a good man. A peaceful one. Kindhearted\
  \ and quiet, thoughtful. And now he'd chased the monsters back into the damned earth\
  \ they'd crawled out of. He would tear the mountain apart rock by rock if he thought\
  \ it could save his son, but what he couldn't do was face down the shadow men and\
  \ win. He would die up there.</p> \n    <p>She had to stop him before he reached\
  \ their sanctuary.</p> \n    <p>Caron could only hope that she could follow them\
  \ all the way and that they hadn't gone deep into the Darklands yet, because that,\
  \ surely, was where they had come from. Some crack in the earth or tunnel down into\
  \ the dark. They would be moving much faster than Keir. They knew where they were\
  \ going. He was driven by fear and panic. For all she knew, he could be stumbling\
  \ around in the dark, lost.</p> \n    <p>That was a better, safer alternative than\
  \ catching up with them.</p> \n    <p>\"They've taken all our children,\" the woman\
  \ said. \"They took my son. My niece. They took Jakan's three boys. We were trying\
  \ to save ourselves...\"</p> \n    <p>That explained the lack of children, but not\
  \ why they'd offered Keir's child to the daemons.</p> \n    <p> \"Why did you do\
  \ it?\" Caron spat out the words like a curse.</p> \n    <p>The old woman shook\
  \ her head. \"We have no young men or women of our own left for them to take.\"\
  \ She said it as if it was a reasonable explanation. \"It's too late to save your\
  \ son, but if you're fast you might still have a husband. Go, and may your god go\
  \ with you.\"</p> \n    <p>Caron's arms ached from being bound so tightly. She tried\
  \ to massage the life back into them and get the blood flowing.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Where are my things?\" she asked. \"My bow, my sword?\"</p> \n    <p>The woman shook\
  \ her head again but offered her a rusty knife she'd probably rescued from the communal\
  \ cooking area. \"I have this,\" she said hopefully.</p> \n    <p>Caron took the\
  \ knife, but it was a useless thing, with no balance for throwing, its blade too\
  \ short to be particularly good for cutting. But it was better than nothing. Barely.\
  \ She tucked it into her belt and set off.</p> \n    <p>She moved fast, racing back\
  \ up what had been the path of light. It had burned out while she'd been unconscious.\
  \ She saw the dark shadow of the Briar Throne up ahead, and paused, remembering\
  \ where she'd first seen the so-called shadow men up in the fissures of the mountain\
  \ above her. She called out Keir's name.</p> \n    <p>There was no reply.</p> \n\
  \    <p>She pushed on, stopping a couple of times to check the ground for tracks.\
  \ It was all but impossible to see anything, with dawn still an hour or more away,\
  \ but the shadow men hadn't been particularly careful when they'd come down from\
  \ the mountain. She could just make out the trampled undergrowth where they had\
  \ descended.</p> \n    <p>Up ahead she saw a light.</p> \n    <p>It was the faintest\
  \ glow coming through the dense foliage that clung to the actual rock face. She\
  \ pushed her way through, bracken cutting her hands and pulling at her trousers.\
  \ Two burning torches were driven deep into the dirt, between them a wide fissure\
  \ in the stone. Her breathing slowed, but her heart beat faster.</p> \n    <p>There\
  \ was no sign of any of the thin-skinned, ivory-boned creatures, nor of Keir.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She stood at the mouth of the cave, listening to the eerie cry of the\
  \ rising wind and the shell-like echo as it funneled through the mountain. She knew\
  \ that Caleb was down there somewhere, and that Keir had plunged into the darkness\
  \ after him, desperate and unprepared.</p> \n    <p>The bones of a savaged sheep\
  \ carcass festered on the threshold, surrounded by the smaller bones of small forest\
  \ animals with strands of meat still hanging from them. They marked the way. The\
  \ shadow men weren't picky when it came to their diet: meat was meat, be it sheep\
  \ or boy.</p> \n    <p>She was dragged from those dark thoughts by the distant sounds\
  \ of shouting and the clash of steel.</p> \n    <p>Then Keir's voice split the night.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Caron pulled the knife from her belt and snatched up one of the guttering\
  \ torches. Then she plunged into the darkness.</p> \n    <p>She ducked beneath an\
  \ overhanging spur of rock, moving over loose stones as she closed the gap between\
  \ her and the sounds of Keir fighting for his life. The acoustics inside the cavern\
  \ mouth were disconcerting; all of the sounds seemed so much closer than they really\
  \ were. Caron had never felt comfortable underground, with the weight of the world\
  \ just a few feet above her head and pressing down on all sides. She moved as quickly\
  \ as she dared, the light of her torch seeming all too weak. The place smelled fetid\
  \ and foul. It reeked of carrion and dead air.</p> \n    <p>She heard a cry. The\
  \ sound echoed back to her, seeming to come from all sides at once.</p> \n    <p>Her\
  \ heart hammered in her chest as cold sweat broke and ran down her back. She gripped\
  \ the dagger tighter in her hand and went deeper into the twisting passage, quickly\
  \ losing her orientation in the darkness. The sound of her own breathing filled\
  \ the cramped confines.</p> \n    <p>The passage opened into a wider space. It offered\
  \ her choices: three tunnels feeding off it. There was no obvious way of knowing\
  \ which way Keir had gone. She kicked out in frustration at a cairn of stones, sending\
  \ them skittering across the ground and raising a high-pitched chittering from high\
  \ up above her. Caron raised the firebrand over her head and saw a chimney that\
  \ stretched up and up. The flame guttered in a draft and she realized the flue must\
  \ open out somewhere. The chittering intensified. She felt a sudden surge of air\
  \ and in seconds the sound transformed into a flurry of wings. Blackness came sweeping\
  \ down the shaft, swelling until it seemed to fill the entire the cavern. Then she\
  \ was being beaten and battered on all sides as bats stormed out of the chimney,\
  \ swooping through the cave back toward the mouth.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> Keir will do anything to protect his son.\n    </div> \n    <p>She\
  \ stood stock still, letting the bats flitter and flap all around her, until finally\
  \ they were all gone and any hope of stealth with them.</p> \n    <p>Caron dropped\
  \ to her knees at the entrance to the first of the three choices, looking for some\
  \ sign of disturbance, something to signify that Keir had come this way. There was\
  \ nothing. She did the same at the middle passage before moving on to the opening\
  \ on right-hand side, where she saw a single score mark cut into the stone at waist-height,\
  \ marking the way.</p> \n    <p>She smiled; even in the heat of the moment Keir\
  \ knew she wouldn't abandon him.</p> \n    <p>Caron set off down the tunnel. The\
  \ ground inclined steeply after a turn and turnabout, with a series of staggered\
  \ drops taking her down fifty feet in a tight stair.</p> \n    <p>The air was thicker\
  \ down here, but not cold. That was peculiar. But then, there was nothing natural\
  \ about this passage.</p> \n    <p>The torch in her hand burned low, the fire consuming\
  \ the reeds woven around the wood. It wouldn't burn forever. She felt the heat against\
  \ her fingers.</p> \n    <p>And then a cool breeze touched her face. That shouldn't\
  \ have been possible this far under the mountain. Suddenly, the walls echoed with\
  \ a low cry of pain. It was the only sound in the darkness and seemed to fill the\
  \ entire mountain, as though the rocks themselves were crying out.</p> \n    <p>At\
  \ the foot of the stair another series of choices confronted her, but scoring on\
  \ the stone marked the way ahead. More choices met her, but with each one came another\
  \ of Keir's marks.</p> \n    <p>Time lost all meaning in the darkness.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>She kept moving, following the occasional cry or clash of steel, not understanding\
  \ how the sounds could carry so far, or if they could be trusted. Abruptly, she\
  \ came upon the edge of a vast pit lined by a winding, wood-and-rope stairway. The\
  \ stair coiled its way down and down, disappearing into the darkness long before\
  \ it reached the bottom—if there was a bottom.</p> \n    <p>The pit's walls were\
  \ lit by shallow bowls of flaming oil set into sconces every so often, creating\
  \ a spiral of light that corkscrewed its way down into the heart of the earth. From\
  \ where she stood the sight looked spectacular, but the lamps provided scant light\
  \ for anyone making the journey down.</p> \n    <p>Movement caught her eye.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Halfway down the staircase—before shapes lost all meaning to the shadows—\
  she saw her husband fighting for his life.</p> \n    <p>Caron didn't hesitate. She\
  \ stepped out onto the first rung of the wooden ladder-stair, gripping the guide\
  \ rope as the wooden slats swayed alarmingly beneath her weight. Then she was racing\
  \ down to reach Keir.</p> \n    <p>The entire construction creaked alarmingly as\
  \ it took the strain. But it held. She felt the vibrations and impacts of Keir's\
  \ desperate fight shiver up through the timbers.</p> \n    <p>One of the shadow\
  \ men would have been more than a match for a simple man like Keir, no matter how\
  \ strong his heart, but Keir wasn't facing just one. There were three of the vile\
  \ creatures down there. He didn't have a prayer. Caron sent a silent entreaty to\
  \ Erastil, hoping Old Deadeye could hear her from so far deep beneath the land that\
  \ was his domain, offering up her life in return for Keir's.</p> \n    <p>Her shoulder\
  \ scraped against rough stone as she descended deeper and deeper, eyes fixed on\
  \ the shadows fighting below her. More than once, hugging the stone wall brought\
  \ her perilously close to toppling one of the oil bowls.</p> \n    <p>The three\
  \ black shapes clustered around a fourth one unmoving on the ground. Keir. She had\
  \ heard no screams. She desperately hoped that the shadow men had feasted before\
  \ their battle with Keir, but even if they had, the reek of blood and the promise\
  \ of fresh meat must surely be irresistible to their kind.</p> \n    <p>The platform\
  \ lurched precariously beneath her. Keir couldn't defend himself. It was as simple\
  \ as that; she was his only hope—if he wasn't dead already.</p> \n    <p>The black\
  \ shapes looked up at her as she charged down the curving wooden platform, the feeble\
  \ knife held out before her.</p> \n    <p>\"Keir!\" she called, turning his name\
  \ into a battle cry, desperate for him to respond in some way, any way, even if\
  \ it were just a sound—anything that meant he was still alive. She refused to believe\
  \ she was too late. Refused with every bone in her body, every ounce of her being.\
  \ She used her fear and anger as a font of energy, channeling it into her weapon\
  \ arm.</p> \n    <p>She would save him.</p> \n    <p>Even in the grim half-light\
  \ she could see Keir had given as good as he got. The three creatures were badly\
  \ injured, with deep cuts flaying their eerie flesh, the opening folds exposing\
  \ brightly colored organs beneath. Keir had given everything to try to save his\
  \ son. But it wasn't enough.</p> \n    <p>The first of the damned creatures launched\
  \ itself at her, but Caron was ready for it.</p> \n    <p>She held the knife as\
  \ tightly as she could. She couldn't afford to lose the blade if it caught against\
  \ one of those ivory-white bones visible beneath the shadow man's transparent skin.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The first slice tore through the creature's flesh, slicing its throat\
  \ and showering her with a fountain of its acidic blood.</p> \n    <p>The acrid-smelling\
  \ air burned her lungs, but the shadow man fell, convulsing as it clawed at its\
  \ own throat, unable to stem the flow of death pouring out of it.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ moved lightning-fast, dropping on the fallen spawn and rising with its vicious,\
  \ two-bladed weapon in her hand before either of its kin could fall on her.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Caron plunged the blade into the second shadow man's heart, ripping it\
  \ open with the weapon's serrated edge as she pulled it clear, and turned on the\
  \ third before it could flee.</p> \n    <p>She roared her primal rage and launched\
  \ herself at the thing as it charged at her. Their weapons met, the impact shivering\
  \ down the length of her arm. The jagged blades ground against each other, slipping\
  \ hilt to hilt as both combatants refused to break. The creature came in so close\
  \ she could smell the vile, sulfurous reek of its breath as it bared its teeth and\
  \ tried to take a chunk out of her neck. She drove a knee up, and its jaws snapped\
  \ together, forced closed inches from her throat by the body blow. The shadow man\
  \ loosed a howl that echoed from the rock to the very depths of the pit. She forced\
  \ it away, but it came back at her twice as hard, twice as fast, driving her back\
  \ up the unsteady platform, trying to use its momentum to take her over the edge.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Caron felt the wood beneath her shift alarmingly, cracking around her\
  \ heel, as the shadow man launched himself at her again. She felt something explode\
  \ inside her, pain threatening to blind her as the creature's clawed hand gouged\
  \ into the soft meat of her side.</p> \n    <p>The pain was excruciating—but so\
  \ much worse when the creature withdrew, pulling at her flesh.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ thought of death, here, beside the man she loved, flashed through her mind, but\
  \ she clung on to the possibility that Caleb was still alive down there and focused\
  \ on that instead of the pain. She rammed her borrowed two-bladed weapon up into\
  \ the multi-colored organs of the beast, and forcing it up until it tore through\
  \ the creature's throat. Gore and blood spilled forth as the mocking howls of the\
  \ shadow man went silent.</p> \n    <p>It was over.</p> \n    <p>But even in death\
  \ the thing was still a danger. She fought against its corpse, the cumbersome bulk\
  \ of which sought to pull her from the platform. After an awkward struggle, she\
  \ managed to extricate herself from it, but then lost purchase on the corpse and\
  \ watched as it fell from the platform and was swallowed quickly by the darkness\
  \ below. The impact came long seconds later. The shadow man's blood dripped from\
  \ one step to another like something alive.</p> \n    <p>Keir still hadn't made\
  \ a sound.</p> \n    <p>She could not leave him, but she couldn't abandon Caleb\
  \ either. It was a dreadful choice.</p> \n    <p>She crouched beside her husband,\
  \ running her fingertips across his cheek, barely holding back her tears. Her thumb\
  \ touched his lips, split and caked with blood. She almost pulled it away when one\
  \ swollen eye flickered open. He groaned. It was the faintest of noises, and she\
  \ wouldn't have heard if her ear hadn't been so close to his lips. He was alive.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Caleb,\" he said. One word. It was all he had the strength to say.\
  \ It spoke more eloquently to the man he was than a million fancy words could have.\
  \ Even now his only thought was for his boy.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm going to get him\
  \ back,\" Caron said. \"Trust me.\" He didn't argue with her. \"You have to go back\
  \ to the surface. I will get him. I promise you, my love.\"</p> \n    <p>He tried\
  \ to rise, but even in the dim light of the oil lamps she could see the agony etched\
  \ on his face.</p> \n    <p>\"Promise me,\" she said, and meant it. She loved him.\
  \ She would bring his boy back, though it might cost her everything. It was a price\
  \ she was willing to pay, for him. For them. Because that was what love really was.\
  \ \"Please. Promise me you'll get out of here.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I need... to come\
  \ with you... He's my son.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You'll only slow me down. Trust me.\
  \ I won't let you down.\"</p> \n    <p>It was an impossible promise, but she needed\
  \ him to believe in her.</p> \n    <p>With his teeth clenched tight he nodded and\
  \ took her hand as she helped him to his feet. He had to brace himself against the\
  \ wall to stay standing.</p> \n    <p>\"Promise me. I need to hear you say it.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Keir looked at her. He knew.</p> \n    <p>He nodded again. \"I promise.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>She kissed him then, on those cracked and bloody lips, and said, \"\
  I love you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I know,\" he said and turned away, using the guide\
  \ rope to haul himself step by agonizing step up the winding stairway. When he was\
  \ thirty feet above her, Keir turned. She wanted to believe he was smiling. \"I\
  \ love you, too,\" he called down to her. She swallowed. It was the first time he'd\
  \ said those words to her.</p> \n    <p>\"I'll bring him home,\" she whispered.\
  \ It was a promise not just to Keir or herself, but to the world.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ turned her back on the love of her life and descended.</p> \n    <p>Far below,\
  \ she saw the glow of more lights. There was nothing welcoming about them.</p> \n\
