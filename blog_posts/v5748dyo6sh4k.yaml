  \ Watery Graves</i><br> <b>Diameter</b>: x1; <b>Mass</b>: x1<br> <b>Gravity</b>:\
  \ x1<br> <b>Location</b>: The Vast<br> <b>Atmosphere</b>: Normal<br> <b>Day</b>:\
  \ 27 hours; <b>Year</b>: 2 years</p> \n      <p>Though the ninth planet of its system,\
  \ Neidr Nine still lies comfortably in its bright sun’s habitable zone due to the\
  \ fact that the star’s other satellites are clustered together in tight orbits.\
  \ Neidr Nine is covered in a shallow ocean, with continent-sized masses of floating\
  \ kelp forests that support much of the planet’s non-aquatic life.</p> \n      <p>Neidr\
  \ Nine’s post-Gap history is marred by tragedy. In the first few decades after Drift\
  \ travel was granted to the galaxy, a civilization of orcs calling themselves the\
  \ Lesser Belkzen Imperial Alliance attempted to conquer the Neidr system. At a casual\
  \ glance, Neidr Nine seemed to be an ideal target, with its oceans and landmasses\
  \ a likely supply of natural resources. Unfortunately, as the Lesser Belkzen ships\
  \ descended into Neidr Nine’s atmosphere, they discovered an overwhelming abundance\
  \ of life-forms not picked up by their scanners: proteans, the chaotic serpentine\
  \ outsiders from the Maelstrom.</p> \n      <p>What started as an organized colonizing\
  \ expedition quickly became an all-out war as the proteans wreaked havoc on the\
  \ various orc landing parties. Though the orcs fought back with gun and blade, the\
  \ anarchic proteans—for reasons unknown—used a wide variety of tricks and tactics\
  \ to disorient and kill the interlopers. The seaweed forests came alive to strangle.\
  \ The waves rose up to drown. Weapons misfired to electrocute and burn. Starship\
  \ hulls turned to basalt or stranger materials to cause deadly crashes. Soldiers\
  \ suddenly turned on one another. All thanks to protean magic.</p> \n      <p>Centuries\
  \ later, what was the Lesser Belkzen Imperial Alliance is nothing more than a few\
  \ scattered pockets of orc mercenaries, many of Neidr Nine’s proteans have seemingly\
  \ returned to the Maelstrom, and the planet’s waterways are haunted by the ghosts\
  \ of the orcs that were killed there. However, this hasn’t stopped recent attempts\
  \ to turn Neidr Nine into a home.</p> \n      <p>Over a decade ago, a collection\
  \ of mutated astrazoans, each no larger than a pebble, landed their miniscule starship\
  \ at the planet’s northern pole. They established a bubble city and factory named\
  \ Reefworks just under the surface of the water in the crevices of a large section\
  \ of brightly colored coral. The Reefworks astrazoans claim to be able produce a\
  \ “ghost-proof” glass, citing the safety provided by their city’s bubble as evidence,\
  \ and are happy to take purchase orders from those who can find them, although it\
  \ takes them at least a month to manufacture enough of the material to be usable\
  \ to larger species. Some of these astrazoans admit that the secret of the glass\
  \ comes from the coral itself, which they claim can speak, though this is dismissed\
  \ as rumor by Reefworks officials.</p> \n      <p>More recently, a network of platforms\
  \ and watercraft has been built on Neidr Nine’s equator by a group of intrepid skittermanders.\
  \ Known as Floatsbarely, this community is at the whims of the planet’s faint currents.\
  \ Friendly and welcoming, these skittermanders are willing to trade the trinkets\
  \ they dredge up from beneath the waves—remnants of the Lesser Belkzen Imperial\
  \ Alliance’s failed attempt to conquer the planet—for goods and supplies. As Floatsbarely\
  \ travels close to the places where the Lesser Belkzen orcs suffered their largest\
  \ defeats, many wonder why the community isn’t routinely harassed by ghosts and\
  \ proteans. Some believe the evils find the skittermanders inoffensive enough to\
  \ leave alone, while others believe the furry, six-armed sailors must offer tributes\
  \ or sacrifices. Religious scholars posit that Floatsbarely must have a divine patron\
  \ who keeps the residents safe, a fact given some credence by the strange temple-like\
  \ structure at the community’s center. However, the skittermanders refuse to allow\
  \ just anyone entrance to the building, claiming safety reasons. If an enquiring\
  \ individual could discover what secrets Floatsbarely holds (if any), several interested\
  \ parties would be willing to pay handsomely for them.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
