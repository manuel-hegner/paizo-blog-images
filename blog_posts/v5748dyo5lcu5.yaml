  \ to Fill the Ranks</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, November 14, 2011</p> \n\
  \   <p>As we continue to expand Pathfinder Society to areas where players are looking\
  \ for organization, it is important to me to find the right people to serve as ambassadors\
  \ of the game, to present a positive light for new players, and to try to bring\
  \ veteran players who have left back into the fold. Three more Venture-Captains\
  \ have been chosen to fill those roles.</p> \n   <p>The Venture-Lieutenant program\
  \ was established just a few weeks ago but we are already seeing the positive results\
  \ from it. One of these is the promotion of Tracy Windeknecht. She served a short\
  \ time under Mark Garringer when he was a Venture-Captain of Indiana. Since Mark\
  \ has stepped down, I have chatted with Tracy and have utmost confidence she will\
  \ pick up right where Mark left off and continue to grow Pathfinder Society in Indiana.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I am also excited to add two new areas to our Venture-Captain regions.\
  \ The first is Virginia. Paul Rees has a unique region due to the high population\
  \ of military in his area. Pathfinder Society is a perfect mesh for gaming interest\
  \ due to deployment schedules and transfers. But Paul is not just taking care of\
  \ the coast. He is there to help all of Virginia.</p> \n   <p>It also is exciting\
  \ to add our third Canadian Venture-Captain, Brent Jans. Edmonton already has a\
  \ strong core of Pathfinder Society players. In truth, Brent and several other people\
  \ were already doing a terrific job organizing Pathfinder Society in that area.\
  \ After talking with Brent, and hearing some of his ideas, I am excited to see how\
  \ much more Pathfinder Society can grow in this area of Canada.</p> \n   <p>In addition\
  \ to the three Venture-Captains above, we have added the following Venture-Lieutenants\
  \ to help some of our current Venture-Captains reach out to areas in their regions\
  \ that are either too far away to cover on a regular basis or where there are too\
  \ many locations in a region to cover at all. They include the following:</p> \n\
  \   <p>Chicago – Brad Ruby<br> Connecticut/New York – William Wadhams<br> Los Angeles\
  \ – Brian Darnell<br> Minnesota – Andrew Christian<br> New York/New Jersey – David\
  \ Santana<br> New York/New Jersey – Vincent Colon-Roine<br> San Francisco – Joshua\
  \ Archer<br> United Kingdom – Rob Silk<br> Vermont – Myles Crocker<br> Washington\
  \ D.C. – Bruce Chang</p> \n   <p>We are still in need of additional Venture-Captains\
  \ in some regions and you can find the list <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >right here</a>. If you’re interested in applying, please contact me after reviewing\
  \ the application process in the previous link.</p> \n   <p>Welcome aboard to all\
  \ my new captains and lieutenants!</p> \n   <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Campaign Coordinator</i></p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder Society -->\
