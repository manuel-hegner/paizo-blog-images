  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Fingers of Death—No, Doom!</h1> \n   <p>by\
  \ Lucien Soulban</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: A Helping Hand</h2> \n   <p>The ancient\
  \ mechanisms thundered, the giant gears crushing boulder-sized rocks between their\
  \ iron teeth and spitting out rubble in disdain. Beyond them, the furnaces set into\
  \ the stone dwarf mouths glowed with Abyssal fury and spewed rivers of molten rock\
  \ destined for the deeper bowels beneath Darkmoon Vale.</p> \n   <p>Darvin couldn't\
  \ concern himself with that, however. To his left, Fife—halfling, adopted brother,\
  \ and friend—lay unmoving on the giant conveyor belt that ferried him closer to\
  \ the hungry gears eager to gnash him into bloody pudding. To Darvin's right, however,\
  \ the beautiful Princess Miranna dangled from a metal chain, her once stunning gown\
  \ in tatters and hanging only by the curve of her ample hips and shoulders. Inch\
  \ by inch, the mad, twisted dwarves from beneath Darkmoon Vale, long forgotten by\
  \ wind and sunlight, cackled monstrously and lowered Miranna closer to the vat of\
  \ molten ore.</p> \n   <p>Darvin couldn't save them both, he realized. Or could\
  \ he? He glanced left at Fife (still unconscious as the belt carried him doomward),\
  \ then right at Princess Miranna (screaming his name, the vat warming the pads of\
  \ her naked feet). Then up at the dwarf king, Madbeard IV, who laughed maniacally\
  \ at his evil cunning, the Necklace of Fortune's Charms with its dozens of luck\
  \ rings hanging from his neck. Finally, Darvin looked down at his hands, and at\
  \ the only thing he hadn't yet spent or broken in their quest to uncover the Vale's\
  \ secrets: a lockpick. </p>\n   <p>It would have to be enough.</p> \n   <p>\"Too\
  \ late!\" Madbeard IV cried triumphantly, his half-burned face twisted in a sneer,\
  \ the rings of his necklace jangling. \"You cannot save them both!\"</p> \n   <p>Darvin\
  \ grit his teeth and steeled his jaw. His voice, low and dangerous, sliced through\
  \ the clamor.</p> \n   <p>\"I'm thirsty,\" he said. </p>\n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n\
  \    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>\"What?\" an old man asked, leaning so\
  \ far forward that he almost spilled from his chair.</p> \n   <p>\"I'm thirsty,\"\
  \ Darvin repeated. He smacked his lips as though dismissing a bad taste. \"Where's\
  \ that serving wench?\"</p> \n   <p>Three of the men shouted for another barley\
  \ stout from the kitchen. Fife pretended to annotate the ledger on his lap, but\
  \ a sideways glance told him the story. Seven men and two women sat around their\
  \ table, on the edge of their seats. They eyed the necklace hanging in Darvin's\
  \ languid grip, a handful of rings all that were left of its charms. </p>\n   <p>When\
  \ the black-haired lass appeared from the kitchen carrying a serving tray, they\
  \ motioned her over impatiently. </p> \n   <p>She set the drink down, at which point\
  \ Darvin rolled his eyes. \"Damn it all... Fife, old friend, I've forgotten my monies\
  \ upstairs. Go fetch my purse?\" </p> \n   <p>Fife nodded and jumped down from his\
  \ large chair.</p> \n   <p>\"This won't take a moment,\" Darvin said.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Here,\" one of the men said, slapping down coin on the serving tray and glancing\
  \ at the necklace of lucky rings. \"Go on with your story. The lockpick?\" </p>\
  \ \n   <p>Darvin nodded as Fife quietly took his seat again. The halfling tried\
  \ not to smirk. Darvin had them wrapped around his finger.</p> \n   <p>It was only\
  \ when Fife glanced again that he saw the two men seated away from them, in the\
  \ shadows. Neither appeared to be smiling.</p> \n   <p>When the evening ended, Fife\
  \ followed Darvin as he swept into their room. The human collapsed into the hay\
  \ bed with a groan, his belly distended. \"I may have eaten too much,\" he admitted,\
  \ draping an arm over his forehead.</p> \n   <p>\"No no,\" Fife said, closing the\
  \ door, \"you had to eat all that food before it threatened anyone else. You're\
  \ a hero.\" </p> \n   <p>\"I am, aren't I?\" Darvin said with a chuckle. He jangled\
  \ the copper necklace, now bereft of its rings. \"We need more charms for tomorrow\
  \ night. I had them eating out of my hand.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Oh, so you did leave\
  \ some food?\" The halfling sat on the opposite bed and opened a leather-bound book\
  \ that swallowed his entire lap. \"I hadn't noticed.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Pff. You halflings\
  \ eat like birds anyway.\" Darvin glanced over to see if he'd hit a nerve, but Fife\
  \ pretended to study the page. </p> \n   <p>\"Now... you got the princess's eyes\
  \ wrong,\" Fife said. \"You called them blue when they're supposed to be sea-green.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"So?\"</p> \n   <p>\"It's the reason why Madbeard IV decides to sacrifice\
  \ her. Because of his promise to the Mage of Conqueror's Bay.\"</p> \n   <p>\"So!\"\
  \ Darvin said.</p> \n   <p>Fife sighed. \"The waters of Conqueror's Bay are green!\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Fife,\" Darvin said, \"nobody here's been to Nidal. We haven't been\
  \ to Nidal—or Darkmoon Vale, or anywhere else for that matter. Nobody's going to\
  \ notice.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Authenticity is key. Speaking of which, it's getting harder\
  \ to keep track of your... embellishments.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I go with the moment,\"\
  \ Darvin said, closing his eyes.</p> \n   <p>\"For example, I never described the\
  \ princess as a ‘plump sausage.'\"</p> \n   <p>\"Some moments are better than others,\"\
  \ Darvin said, grinning. \"Besides, I grow bored. Have you written something new?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I'm working on it,\" Fife said, flipping through pages. The comment\
  \ rankled him. Like it was that easy to create something worthwhile.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  You worry too much,\" Darvin said. He sounded like he couldn't fight the iron weights\
  \ of sleep any longer.</p> \n   <p>\"Darv... did you notice those two men seated\
  \ away from everyone else?\" Fife asked.</p> \n   <p>But Darvin was already asleep,\
  \ and soon Fife was fast dreaming as well. </p>\n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗\
  ∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>It wasn't the two new men in the room that awoke\
  \ Fife that morning. It was Darvin's deep snort that did the trick. For a moment,\
  \ the halfling had forgotten where they'd taken shelter, then it slowly bubbled\
  \ to the surface... the Andoren inn, the food and drink, another community entertained\
  \ and bilked.</p> \n   <p>\"Hello,\" Fife said to the seated man. The intruder wore\
  \ a grey tunic with a thick peppered mustache, and had shoulders wider than Fife\
  \ was tall. </p> \n   <p>\"Mmm... ‘ello,\" Darvin muttered back and then turned\
  \ over. He snored almost immediately.</p> \n   <p>The human who stood behind the\
  \ seated one was black haired and balding, his arms thick with equal measures of\
  \ muscle and fat, his face knotted in a disapproving scowl. Neither man appeared\
  \ armed; Fife remembered them both from last night as the pair who had watched them\
  \ from the shadows. </p> \n   <p>\"Darvin, we have guests,\" Fife said.</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"Mmm... are they pretty?\" Darvin muttered.</p> \n   <p>\"Give him a moment,\"\
  \ Fife said, smiling nervously at the visitors. \"His instincts are slow to start,\
  \ but you'll find none sharper.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I hope so,\" the seated man said\
  \ in a deep voice.</p> \n   <p>Darvin cheered softly. \"Huzzah! Fife's voice has\
  \ finally broken.\" </p>\n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p>\

  ></a>\n    <br> \"For an ordinary merchant, Cullins is exceptionally persuasive.\"\
  \n   </div> \n   <p>\"You don't look like much,\" the standing man said. He'd introduced\
  \ himself as Harvander, Master-at-Arms for the Merchant Cullins. Cullins remained\
  \ seated, his arms crossed as though daring someone to entertain him and certain\
  \ they'd fail.</p> \n   <p>\"It helps if people underestimate us,\" Darvin said,\
  \ splashing his face with cold water from the rinse bowl. The shock jolted him awake.\
  \ Fife handed him the washcloth. \"Lulls them into a false sense of security.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I assure you, it's working,\" Cullins replied.</p> \n   <p>\"Good,\"\
  \ Darvin said, deciding to smile at the insult. \"How may we be of service?\" He\
  \ already knew these two would be tough to charm or crack.</p> \n   <p>Harvander\
  \ paused and stage-whispered in Cullins ear, \"I don't think this is a good idea.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Cullins shrugged. \"They die, we don't pay them.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Die?\"\
  \ Fife said.</p> \n   <p>\"Pay?\" Darvin said at the same time.</p> \n   <p>\"The\
  \ village is cursed,\" Cullins said. \"For five years, we suffered under the rule\
  \ of Malificar—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Who names their child Malificar?\" Darvin whispered\
  \ to Fife, but Fife shushed him with a motion.</p> \n   <p>\"He blighted our crops,\"\
  \ Cullins continued. \"He raised the dead and conducted foul, perverse experiments\
  \ on our livestock.\"</p> \n   <p>Fife elbow-jabbed Darvin in the ribs just as a\
  \ snarky comment rose to the human's lips. </p> \n   <p>\"We killed him for it,\"\
  \ Harvander said flatly. \"A year ago, in fact. And we destroyed his manse.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"But the killings didn't stop?\" Fife asked. </p> \n   <p>Darvin noticed\
  \ the halfling squirming eagerly in his seat, and realized he was in trouble.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Foolish locals,\" Harvander replied. \"They looted his stead and awoke...\
  \ something.\"</p> \n   <p>\"There's been a death every week or two since,\" Cullins\
  \ said. \"Their throats opened.\"</p> \n   <p>Fife smiled up at Darvin. This is\
  \ fantastic! his expression read, but Darvin tried to look indifferent.</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"Over thirty deaths in total,\" Harvander replied. \"All farmers or travelers,\
  \ their throats slit cleanly.\"</p> \n   <p>\"We've searched the ruins during the\
  \ daytime, but at night, nobody dares approach the property.\" Cullins studied them\
  \ both and then tossed a leather pouch to Darvin. The pouch clinked when he caught\
  \ it, and the weight felt solid. \"Silver—not a copper piece among them. Yours if\
  \ you help us.\"</p> \n   <p>\"If not,\" Harvander continued. \"Well, there's no\
  \ telling what the hard-working people of this town would do to the liars who sold\
  \ them cheap trinkets as luck charms.\" </p>\n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n\
  \   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>Harvander escorted them through the gray drizzle\
  \ to the ruins of a manse outside of town, then left them to their business.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Only a shell remained of the main building, the wings of the manse upright\
  \ except for a collapsed roof, the middle of the home burnt and in rubble. A mess\
  \ of blackened timbers and shattered bricks reached plaintively for the dismal skies.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"We should run,\" Darvin said.</p> \n   <p>\"They need our help,\" Fife\
  \ replied. The halfling poked about with his walking stick, deftly jumping across\
  \ patches of floor that would have collapsed under a human's weight. Darvin envied\
  \ him that grace.</p> \n   <p>\"This isn't one of your stories,\" Darvin warned.\
  \ He paused near a hole and peered down. Here, a fire-eaten grid of floor beams\
  \ separated the main floor from the dark pit of the basement.</p> \n   <p>\"This\
  \ is better!\" Fife replied. Grinning madly, he pulled his cloak over his head to\
  \ ward off the rain, opened a small ledger, and began jotting something down.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"What do you think you're doing?\" Darvin asked. He tested one of the\
  \ beams, but it groaned; Darvin backed away.</p> \n   <p>\"Recording every detail,\"\
  \ Fife replied, and then read aloud, \"The heroes stood over the black gulf, staring\
  \ intently into the abyss.\"</p> \n   <p>\"All the while\" Darvin continued, \"\
  Fife unaware that his partner was about to kick him over the edge.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Not in character,\" Fife responded absently. \"Let's go down.\"</p> \n   <p>Darvin\
  \ peered over the edge. \"How?\"</p> \n   <p>The halfling looked around, and Darvin\
  \ followed his gaze over to a debris slope of collapsed bricks, timber, and furniture\
  \ mounded up on the floor below. </p> \n   <p>\"Follow me,\" Fife said, slapping\
  \ the book shut and jumping from beam to beam, seemingly oblivious to their poor\
  \ state. He reached a broken ledge, the remnant of the floor abutting an exterior\
  \ wall, and from there jumped down to the slope. From beam to tabletop to broken\
  \ wall, he reached the plank-floored basement in a series of deft hops, barely disturbing\
  \ the slope. </p> \n   <p>\"You next!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Not on your life, you malnourished\
  \ hummingbird!\" Darvin called down, then quietly cursed the easy grace of halflings.\
  \ Darvin took looped rope from his bag and secured it to an exposed foundation stone.\
  \ \"You know,\" he said, \"I bought this rope strictly for show.\" He swung his\
  \ legs over the side and, inhaling, lowered himself into the darkness. His heart\
  \ beat harder.</p> \n   <p>\"Hey,\" Fife chirped, peering at a hole in the floor.\
  \ \"There's a level below this.\" </p> \n   <p>Darvin concentrated on his descent.\
  \ He spun gently and dropped in fits and jerks. He flailed his legs trying to steady\
  \ himself and quickly found his world spinning even faster around the axle of the\
  \ rope.</p> \n   <p>\"Darv,\" Fife said, with concern in his tone.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I've got this,\" Darvin said, but the taste of breakfast in his mouth told him perhaps\
  \ not.</p> \n   <p>\"Darv!\" Fife shouted. \"Above you! Spider!\"</p> \n   <p>Darvin\
  \ jerked his head up and saw it: a fist-sized spider descended down the rope. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>No, he realized. Not a fist-sized spider, but—</p> \n   <p>\"It's a hand!\"\
  \ Darvin shrieked. \"A fist-sized hand!\" </p> \n   <p>Runes marked the amputated\
  \ hand, the skin gray, wrist terminating at a bronze band. The knuckles were exposed\
  \ to the bone, and the fingers sheathed in steel blades. </p> \n   <p>A rock careened\
  \ through the air, missing the hand. Darvin swung around to find Fife aiming again.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Don't make it mad!\" Darvin screamed.</p> \n   <p>\"How do you make\
  \ a hand mad?\" Fife screamed back.</p> \n   <p>The hand twirled around the rope\
  \ once, and then the line creaked. Darvin realized too late that the creature had\
  \ just cut halfway through the rope with its fingers. Braiding frayed with a snapping\
  \ sound, and before Darvin could drop down, the rope broke completely. </p> \n \
  \  <p>Darvin fell ten feet, the planks of the basement floor shattering under his\
  \ weight. Then both he and Fife were falling once more, down into the darkness that\
  \ yawned below the basement.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> The further misadventures\
