  \   <h2>Character Tips</h2> \n    <p>Curse of the Crimson Throne is primarily an\
  \ urban-based campaign set in the city of Korvosa in southeastern Varisia, although\
  \ there are a few lengthy portions of the Adventure Path that take place outside\
  \ of Korvosa's walls. To a certain extent, these portions of the game are intended\
  \ to force urban-themed PCs out of their comfort zone, but the reverse certainly\
  \ holds true. You can absolutely play a barbarian or druid or other nature-themed\
  \ PC in Curse of the Crimson Throne, but you should come up with an in-character\
  \ reason to explain why your non-urban character is in Korvosa at the start of the\
  \ campaign, as well as why you'd want to stay in Korvosa as things inevitably start\
  \ to go bad for the city. Building strong links to other player characters is a\
  \ great solution—your druid or barbarian might normally just abandon the city, but\
  \ not when a close friend or relative or other ally who lives in the city is in\
  \ danger!</p> \n    <h3>Character Races</h3> \n    <p>Korvosa is predominantly a\
  \ human city, although all of the PC races in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook are welcome\
  \ within its walls. Korvosa itself was founded many years ago by Cheliax, and most\
  \ of its human citizens are of the Chelaxian ethnicity today as a result, although\
  \ there are large numbers of Varisians, Taldans, and Vudrani present within the\
  \ city walls as well.</p> \n    <p>Shoanti are also quite common, although they\
  \ tend to be less welcome in certain parts of the city and face the specter of racism\
  \ that lingers still in Korvosa, thanks in part to the city's unfortunate history\
  \ of Chelaxian conquerors claiming the land from the Shoanti and forcing them to\
  \ flee to the northeast to the harsh Cinderlands. While a Shoanti character may\
  \ be subjected to bigotry from some of Korvosa's more narrow-minded citizens, having\
  \ a Shoanti PC may open up other advantages later in the campaign. Other ethnicities\
  \ are rare but not unknown in the city.</p> \n    <p>Dwarves mostly hail from nearby\
  \ Janderhoff, many of whom have ties to robust trade and mercantilism between Korvosa\
  \ and the nearby Sky Citadel.</p> \n    <p>Elves and gnomes are relatively rare\
  \ in Korvosa, but not so much that they'd turn heads when spotted walking down the\
  \ city streets.</p> \n    <p>Halflings are relatively common in the city; many have\
  \ escaped from lives as slaves in Cheliax to the south, and many of Korvosa's shipping\
  \ concerns have large numbers of halfling sailors on their payroll.</p> \n    <p>Half-elves\
  \ and half-orcs are present in the city as well, but while half-elves can generally\
  \ pass uncommented upon, many of Korvosa's inhabitants (particularly the Shoanti,\
  \ who have a long, bitter history with orcs) react poorly to half-orc presences;\
  \ bigotry and fear are unfortunately not uncommon against these oft-misunderstood\
  \ folk.</p> \n    <h3>Character Classes</h3> \n    <p>Curse of the Crimson Throne,\
  \ as an urban-themed campaign, presents numerous opportunities for intrigue-based\
  \ characters to shine, yet there remain plenty of old-fashioned dungeon crawls and\
  \ dangerous combats awaiting as well. As with all campaigns, having a balanced party\
  \ with regards to combat prowess, magical ability, and intrigue skills will go a\
  \ long way toward success.</p> \n    <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n     <b>Character\
  \ Classes:</b> \n     <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\"\
  \ onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <p><b>Alchemist,\
  \ Arcanist, Magus, Sorcerer, Summoner, Witch, Wizard</b>: Korvosa is welcoming to\
  \ those who specialize in arcane magic, and there are numerous opportunities for\
  \ an arcane spellcaster to flourish in the city—and being an adventurer is certainly\
  \ one option for prosperity! One important thing to keep in mind, though, is that\
  \ Korvosa's most well-known school for arcane spellcasters, the Acadamae, does not\
  \ play a significant role in Curse of the Crimson Throne. If you wish your character\
  \ to be associated with the Acadamae, speak to your GM or build your character so\
  \ those links are relatively minor. All of the standard familiars are good choices\
  \ in Korvosa. There is a long-standing feud in the city between imps (who've escaped\
  \ servitude to Acadamae students and teachers) and pseudodragon-like creatures called\
  \ house drakes. Both of these are classic choices for improved familiars. (A spellcaster\
  \ must be 7th level and chaotic good to gain a house drake as a familiar; full statistics\
  \ for these tiny dragons appear in Curse of the Crimson Throne.) Other commonly\
  \ seen improved familiars in Korvosa include dire rats, lyrakien, nosois, and pseudodragons,\
  \ but anything approved by your GM could serve.</p> \n      <p><b>Barbarian, Bloodrager,\
  \ Druid, Hunter, Shaman, Skald</b>: These classes are not normally associated with\
  \ urban regions, but as long as you have a reason for your character to live in\
  \ or be on an extended visit to Korvosa, the campaign will accommodate such characters\
  \ (and in fact, when the plot moves beyond the city walls, such characters may well\
  \ be particularly helpful!). A character associated with one of the Shoanti quahs\
  \ might provide some additional advantages or opportunities as the campaign progresses,\
  \ particularly if the PC hails from one of the quahs that dwells in the Cinderlands\
  \ (the Lyrune-Quah, the Sklar-Quah, or the Skoan-Quah)—although if your PC is a\
  \ member of one such tribe, don't assume that you'll be automatically welcomed back\
  \ into your tribe's arms after spending a significant amount of time in Korvosa!\
  \ Classes that take animal companions should be able to function normally in Korvosa—\
  after all, this is a city where defenders mounted on hippogriffs exist. The sight\
  \ of someone with an exotic animal companion is unlikely to raise many eyebrows,\
  \ provided the animal companion is well behaved. Nonetheless, there are certain\
  \ types of animal companions that are more commonly encountered in this part of\
  \ Varisia, including alligators, badgers, bears, birds, boars, dogs, horses, ponies,\
  \ small cats (mostly firepelt cougars), wolverines, and wolves.</p> \n      <p><b>Bard,\
  \ Investigator, Rogue, Slayer, Swashbuckler</b>: These intrigue-focused characters\
  \ make excellent choices for an urban campaign like Curse of the Crimson Throne.\
  \ Korvosa has a wide range of organizations and groups that characters like this\
  \ can belong to, but the campaign works best for \"freelancers\"—intrigue-based\
  \ characters who haven't yet selected a group to associate with, be they underground\
  \ guilds or high society. As the Curse of the Crimson Throne campaign progresses,\
  \ you'll encounter several groups with which your intrigue-themed character might\
  \ ally with or oppose, and coming to these groups without having a strong affiliation\
  \ at the outset makes for a more rewarding play experience. Of course, there's one\
  \ group your intrigue-focused character should start quite loyal to—that of the\
  \ player character party! If you want to associate with a particular group, speak\
  \ to your GM before the game begins. Note also that any of these intrigue-focused\
  \ characters could benefit from the specific information provided below for vigilante\
  \ characters.</p> \n      <p><b>Brawler, Cavalier, Fighter, Monk</b>: As with intrigue-focused\
  \ characters, there are numerous options for martial classes to flourish in Korvosa.\
  \ The most appropriate group to ally with in this campaign would be the Korvosan\
  \ Guard, which serves as the city's police force and plays a significant role in\
  \ the campaign. Other groups, like the Hellknight Order of the Nail and the Sable\
  \ Company have specific roles to play in Curse of the Crimson Throne that make them\
  \ poor choices for PCs. If you wish to associate with one of these two groups, speak\
  \ with your GM before the game.</p> \n      <p><b>Cleric, Inquisitor, Oracle, Warpriest</b>:\
  \ All four of these divine spellcasting classes are well known and welcome in Korvosa—\
  provided they do not use their religious beliefs and zeal to cause trouble. Consult\
  \ the Religions section below for further details.</p> \n      <p><b>Kineticist,\
  \ Medium, Mesmerist, Occultist, Psychic, Spiritualist</b>: There are a few opportunities\
  \ for psychic classes to particularly shine throughout the Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne Adventure Path, be they links to the deep themes of spiritualism associated\
  \ with the Harrow or explorations of particularly notorious haunted sites. Make\
  \ sure your GM is familiar with and comfortable with options from <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em></a> before choosing one of these classes\
  \ for your character.</p> \n      <p><b>Paladin</b>: Paladins are an excellent choice\
  \ for Curse of the Crimson Throne—with one caveat: do not let the lawful portion\
  \ of your alignment rule your play choices. Things rapidly get out of control and\
  \ go bad in Korvosa as the campaign unfolds, and your paladin's choices should put\
  \ her or him firmly on the side of the PCs. Speak to your GM before playing a paladin\
  \ in this game. As a general rule, it's probably better to play a paladin of a neutral\
  \ good deity than of a lawful neutral deity in Curse of the Crimson Throne.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Ranger</b>: If you choose to play a ranger, make sure to consult\
  \ the information above for other nature-themed classes (barbarian, druid, etc.),\
  \ including advice on animal companions. Note also that while Korvosa has a ranger-themed\
  \ organization that operates within its walls (the Sable Company), that group is\
  \ not a great choice for association with as a player character. If you wish to\
  \ be associated with the Sable Company, clear it with your GM before play. The best\
  \ options for favored enemy are animal, humanoid (human), undead, and vermin. These\
  \ choices remain strong in the later parts of the campaign, but outsider (evil)\
  \ and outsider (native) grow stronger as options. Most other favored enemy choices\
  \ will be represented now and then in the campaign, but not nearly as often. The\
  \ best favored terrain choices are (in descending order of importance) urban, underground,\
  \ desert, swamp, and plains.</p> \n      <p><b>Gunslinger, Ninja, Samurai</b>: These\
  \ three classes are all but unknown in Korvosa. While samurai and gunslingers can\
  \ fit in well with other martial-focused classes and ninja fit in well with intrigue-focused\
  \ classes, there are no specific themes in Korvosa tailored specifically for these\
  \ exotic class choices.</p> \n      <p><b>Vigilante</b>: Korvosa's current political\
  \ climate is ripe for the attention of a vigilante. In fact, the city already has\
  \ one notorious legend in this category: Blackjack, a figure at once beloved and\
  \ reviled, is a masked hero who has fought for Korvosa's downtrodden for many decades.\
  \ Rumors about his or her identity, race, and gender are across the board, as are\
  \ opinions as to whether Blackjack is one person or a role held by several over\
  \ the course of the city's growth. Whatever the truth, Blackjack has been lying\
  \ low of late, perhaps retired, perhaps dead, or perhaps (as the downtrodden hope)\
  \ merely waiting for the right time to burst back onto the scene. Of course, this\
  \ means the city is potentially ready for a new vigilante to look up to or to fight\
  \ against. Your vigilante could even be interested in taking on the role of Blackjack,\
  \ although if you do so, speak to your GM first to determine how that might be worked\
  \ out.</p> \n      <p><b>Prestige Classes</b>: The Harrow plays a significant role\
  \ in Curse of the Crimson Throne, and as such, the harrower prestige class from\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea\
  \ World Guide</em></a> would make a particularly interesting choice for anyone who\
  \ can qualify for it. Certain prestige classes are associated with key organizations\
  \ in Golarion, and some of those organizations have key roles to play in Curse of\
  \ the Crimson Throne. As such, these prestige classes are inappropriate for use\
  \ in this campaign, but in order to avoid spoiling too much, those classes are not\
  \ called out here. If you wish to build your character toward a specific prestige\
  \ class, make sure to let your GM know as soon as possible so that she or he can\
  \ either approve or deny your choice based on whether it makes sense to take levels\
  \ in that class for Curse of the Crimson Throne.</p> \n     </div>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <h3>Languages</h3> \n    <p>The Common tongue is the most appropriate language\
  \ for this campaign, but two others that will see a lot of use are Shoanti and Varisian.\
  \ Beyond these three obvious choices, Orc, Thassilonian, and Vudrani will have some\
  \ sporadic uses here and there. You can expect to encounter the typically wide range\
  \ of creatures in a lengthy campaign, with more common languages (such as Dwarven,\
  \ Elven, and Draconic) likely being more useful than obscure ones (such as Azlanti,\
  \ Cyclops, or Orvian), which may not have much use at all.</p> \n    <h3>Religions</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>Korvosa is tolerant of a wide range of religions and doesn't favor any\
  \ one faith over another. The city's largest and most publicly active temple is\
  \ the Bank of Abadar, but the city also hosts temples devoted to Asmodeus, Pharasma,\
  \ Sarenrae, and Shelyn. Beyond these temples, the Pantheon of the Many in southern\
  \ Korvosa represents 17 of the core 20 deities of the Inner Sea region—the only\
  \ three deities who are not represented here are Gorum, Lamashtu, and Rovagug. While\
  \ worship of Gorum isn't illegal in the city, his following has never been strong\
  \ in the region (even among the Shoanti, who prefer a more shamanistic or druidic\
  \ form of worship). While the faiths of Zon-Kuthon, Urgathoa, and Norgorber are\
  \ represented in the Pantheon of the Many, their shrines are generally unused and\
  \ neglected. When choosing a faith for your character, it's best overall to avoid\
  \ worshiping an evil deity—if you do wish to worship such a deity, speak to your\
  \ GM as your choice may be inappropriate (for reasons beyond alignment!) for this\
  \ campaign.</p> \n    <h2>Campaign Traits</h2> \n    <p>Korvosa, like any city,\
  \ has its share of undesirables. Cutpurses, thugs, thieves, burglars, assassins,\
  \ and lowlifes of every sort can be found in waterfront slums, creeping in the sewers,\
  \ or hiding in the tangled rooftop-scape known as the Shingles. The Korvosan Guard\
  \ does what it can to keep the city's criminals from causing too much harm, but\
  \ the cold reality is that crooks will always outnumber the law. And that means\
  \ some crimes go unpunished and some criminals see great success.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ worst of these, perhaps, are the city's crime lords. Dozens of them operate in\
  \ Korvosa today, from the scheming leader of the Cerulean Society all the way down\
  \ to the Varisian Sczarni thugs who preside over a gang of a half-dozen friends\
  \ and cousins. These minor crime lords are often, ironically, the ones who do the\
  \ most damage to Korvosa's law-abiding citizens, as larger organizations have little\
  \ need to bother commoners. One such undesirable is Gaedren Lamm, a despicable wretch\
  \ who missed his chance at being somebody big in Korvosa's murky underworld. Well\
  \ past his prime, the decrepit thief abducts orphans and forces them to support\
  \ his parasitic lifestyle with petty crime. Many members of Korvosa's lower class\
  \ have had dealings with Lamm, and even a few of the city's middle class and nobility\
  \ have had their lives complicated by this foul old man. Yet no matter what he does,\
  \ he always seems to slip away from the guards and avoid answering for his crimes.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Gaedren Lamm's luck is about to change, though. For among those his actions\
  \ have recently touched are men and women destined to become some of Korvosa's greatest\
  \ heroes—your player characters!</p> \n    <p>Before your Curse of the Crimson Throne\
  \ campaign begins, look through the following Campaign Traits and select one that\
  \ works well for your character. These traits detail how your PCs has been wronged\
  \ by Gaedren Lamm, and set up the initial events for the Adventure Path—events that\
  \ may well allow you and your fellow PCs to see that Gaedren Lamm answers for his\
  \ terrible crimes, be that in a court of law or at the edge of a vengeful blade.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The campaign traits all tie Gaedren to a PC, and represent historical\
  \ snippets that explain how this detestable crime lord has affected each PC in the\
  \ past. Each trait is categorized into one of six unique themes with two separate\
  \ choices for each campaign trait. In addition to selecting one of these campaign\
  \ traits, each player should select an additional character trait; see <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8fo1\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</em></a> for more\
  \ rules on character traits.</p> \n    <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n     <b>Campaign\

  \ class=\"stat-block-title\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">Betrayed</p> \n  \
  \    <p class=\"stat-block\">You were hardly a model citizen as a child or young\
  \ adult. Your reasons for turning to a life of crime may be varied, but what matters\
  \ is that you eventually fell in with a certain well-connected and notorious crime\
  \ lord named Gaedren Lamm. His reputation as a snake and a treacherous scoundrel\
  \ was known to you, but for reasons of your own, you chose not to turn him down\
  \ when he offered you a chance to work for him. You may have assumed you were an\
  \ exception, or that you'd be able to handle him, or perhaps even planned to betray\
  \ him. As it worked out, though, Gaedren got the upper hand and took you down you\
  \ first. You may have served time in jail, may have been beaten by his thugs and\
  \ left for dead, or could simply have had your profits stolen out from under you.\
  \ Whatever the cause, Gaedren wronged you, and you are eager for the chance to get\
  \ revenge.<br> Choose one of the following benefits.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Hungry for Revenge</b>: You've never forgiven Gaedren for his betrayal, and\
  \ have vowed to make him pay for what he did. Whether that's seeing him rot in jail\
  \ or a shallow grave, you hope to taste vengeance someday. Whenever you deal damage\
  \ with a melee weapon on a creature that is flat-footed, you gain a +1 trait bonus\
  \ on the damage roll.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Reformed Criminal</b>:\
  \ You've given up the life of crime, and managed to talk your way out of any repercussions\
  \ such as jail time or fines. You've told yourself that you would rather leave your\
  \ past behind, yet the concept of seeing Gaedren Lamm pay for his crimes still appeals\
  \ to you. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks, and Diplomacy is a class\
  \ skill for you.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\" style=\"margin: 20px\
  \ 0 10px 0;\">Drug Addict</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block\">Someone you know has\
  \ become addicted to shiver, a drug distilled from the venom of tropical arachnids\
  \ known as dream spiders. The drug induces sleep filled with vivid dreams, during\
  \ which the user's body shakes and shivers, giving the substance its street name.\
  \ You've always thought of shiver as a problem of the lower class, but then someone\
  \ you know overdosed on the stuff. You've done a bit of investigating and have learned\
  \ that the villain who got your friend addicted in the first place was a crime lord\
  \ named Gaedren Lamm. Unfortunately, the guards seem to be focused on the bigger\
  \ dealers. They don't have time to devote many resources to what they've called\
  \ \"a bit player in a beggar's problem.\" It would seem that if Gaedren's operation\
  \ is to be stopped, it falls to you.<br> Choose one of the following benefits.</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Addicted Friend</b>: The addict is a friend\
  \ or lover who might or might not have survived the overdose. Your research into\
  \ the drug scene and local politics has given you a respectable education in street\
  \ knowledge. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks, and Knowledge\
  \ (local) is a class skill for you.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Personal\
  \ Addiction</b>: You were the addict. You blame Gaedren for your brush with death\
  \ and hate how his drugs are causing similar problems among other youths. Fortunately,\
  \ your body recovers quickly from toxins, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude\
  \ saving throws.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\" style=\"margin: 20px\
  \ 0 10px 0;\">Framed</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block\">Someone you know and love\
  \ was accused of murder. A supposed eyewitness account from a local fisherman seemed\
  \ to be enough to seal the case, but the accused had enough alibis that sentencing\
  \ wasn't immediate. Someone confronted the fisherman and discovered he was intimidated\
  \ into providing false witness and forced into planting the murder weapon by the\
  \ actual murderer—a local crime lord named Gaedren Lamm, whose thugs killed the\
  \ fisherman before he could recant his testimony. Although this removed the key\
  \ witness and resulted in the accused being set free, the stigma was enough to badly\
  \ damage the accused's reputation. If you can find Gaedren, you're sure you can\
  \ find evidence that ties him to the murder and can clear the accused's name.<br>\
  \ Choose one of the following benefits.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Dropout</b>:\
  \ You were the one accused of the murder. Although you were eventually freed when\
  \ a friend confronted the fisherman and got the truth, the damage had been done.\
  \ You were forced to leave your school or church. As a result, you were forced to\
  \ self-train and promised yourself you would become better at your chosen profession\
  \ despite the spurning of your peers. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Spellcraft checks,\
  \ and Spellcraft is a class skill for you.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Family Honor</b>: The person who was framed was a family member, perhaps a father\
  \ or sister. You managed to trick the fisherman into revealing the truth with your\
  \ skilled tongue. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks, and Bluff is a class\
  \ skill for you.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\" style=\"margin: 20px\
  \ 0 10px 0;\">Love Lost</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block\">Someone you loved was\
  \ knifed to death in a dark alley one night. You were called to the scene by the\
  \ Korvosan Guard to identify the body, and as rough as that was for you, you also\
  \ noticed a ring was missing from your loved one's finger. Whoever murdered your\
  \ loved one stole that ring—you're convinced of it. You've done some investigation\
  \ on your own and recently found the ring for sale at a local merchant's shop. To\
  \ your great frustration, you can't yet afford the 500 gp to buy it back, but the\
  \ merchant did tell you from whom he purchased the ring: a man named Gaedren Lamm.\
  \ It seems likely this criminal killed your loved one, or at the very least, he\
  \ knows who did. The only problem is finding him.<br> Choose one of the following\
  \ benefits.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>All Alone</b>: The murder victim\
  \ was a lover. With your lover's death, a part of you died as well, leaving you\
  \ haunted, grim, and prone to dark musings. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Intimidate\
  \ checks, and Intimidate is a class skill for you.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Orphaned</b>: The murder victim was your only surviving parent. You had to work\
  \ hard to make ends meet for yourself and any siblings, and often had to scavenge\
  \ for food. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Survival checks, and Survival is a class\
  \ skill for you.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\" style=\"margin: 20px\
  \ 0 10px 0;\">Missing Child</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block\">You suspect that\
  \ a child you know has been abducted by Gaedren Lamm. Whatever the relationship,\
  \ you've heard rumors about \"Lamm's Lambs,\" and of how the old man uses children\
  \ as pickpockets and agents for his crimes. You've even heard rumors that the child\
  \ you're looking for has been spotted in the marketplaces in the company of known\
  \ cutpurses and pickpockets. Although the Korvosan Guard has been understanding\
  \ of your plight, it has its hands full with \"more important\" matters these days,\
  \ it seems, and has not yet been able to learn anything more about Gaedren. No one\
  \ else is interested in bringing Gaedren down and rescuing his victims—that task\
  \ falls to you. Yet where could the old scoundrel be hiding?<br> Choose one of the\
  \ following benefits.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Missing Sibling</b>:\
  \ The missing child is a brother or sister. Although everyone else has given up\
  \ hope, you believe your sibling still lives. Your constant search for the missing\
  \ sibling has developed into great skill at rumormongering and finding out information\
  \ from others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive checks, and Sense Motive\
  \ is a class skill for you.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Missing Son\
  \ or Daughter</b>: The missing child is your own son or daughter, a niece or nephew,\
  \ or a child you were charged with protecting. The child was abducted during a trip\
  \ to the market or other daily event. Your stubbornness and long hours spent searching\
  \ for rumors grant you a +1 trait bonus on Will saves.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  \ style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">Unhappy Childhood</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block\"\
  >You spent a period of time as one of Gaedren Lamm's enslaved orphans, doing all\
  \ manner of dirty work for him. Maybe you were abducted from your parent's home\
  \ or during a trip to the market. Perhaps the irresponsible matron who ruled your\
  \ orphanage traded you to him in return for a desperately needed financial loan.\
  \ Or perhaps you, like most of Gaedren's slaves, were merely a child of the street\
  \ who succumbed to his promise of regular meals and a roof in return for what he\
  \ said would be \"a little light work.\" Whatever the case, you spent several years\
  \ of your life as one of \"Lamm's Lambs\" before escaping. You've nursed a grudge\
  \ against the old man ever since.<br> Choose one of the following benefits.</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Religious</b>: One day, while on a job for\
  \ Gaedren, you found a holy symbol of the god you worship, and intrigued by it,\
  \ you snuck off to attend services. When Gaedren found out, he beat you to within\
  \ an inch of your life and broke your holy symbol. Your faith let you block out\
  \ the pain, and you escaped his control and took shelter in the church, where you\
  \ spent the rest of your youth. You gain a +2 trait bonus on concentration checks\
  \ and Constitution checks to stabilize at negative hit points.</p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Tortured</b>: After you made one too many errors, Gaedren tortured\
  \ you and left you for dead in a garbage heap. Your scars and memories have motivated\
  \ you to hone your reaction speed and make you rather jumpy. You gain a +1 trait\
  \ bonus on Reflex saves.</p> \n     </div>\n    </div> \n    <p>James Jacobs<br>\
