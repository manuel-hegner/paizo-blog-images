  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 27, 2012</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">This is an exciting time at Goblinworks,\
  \ and we wanted you to know about our latest development! As our biggest fans and\
  \ customers, it is important to us that you are in the loop right away. Your support\
  \ for Paizo and Pathfinder has allowed us to make Pathfinder the top RPG in the\
  \ world! That success has lead us to license the MMORPG rights to our sister company,\
  \ <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Goblinworks</a>, so they\
  \ can make a next generation fantasy sandbox MMO called Pathfinder Online. Last\
  \ May, we launched a Kickstarter to fund a <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-technology-demo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Technology Demo</a>, and many of you supported us there. In\
  \ turn, that Demo allowed us to get the funding we needed to put Pathfinder Online\
  \ into production. Right now, a small team of very cool professionals are working\
  \ very hard on building Pathfinder Online, and we have you to thank for that!</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>But right now our team is limited in size. There are nine people working\
  \ on Pathfinder Online—enough to get us to launch in a few years, but not enough\
  \ to do it with the speed and scope we really want. So we are launching a <a href=\"\
  http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo\"\
  >new Kickstarter for the Pathfinder Online Fantasy Sandbox MMO</a>. The purpose\
  \ of this second Kickstarter is to get the money we need to make Pathfinder Online\
  \ bigger, faster and better than we can with our current level of funding. It will\
  \ let us hire more people and dedicate more resources to Pathfinder Online, potentially\
  \ cutting the time to launch in half, and massively expanding the content and features\
  \ available on release.</p> \n    <p>Could we have gone out and got investment capital\
  \ to do this? Sure, but with that investment comes costs and entanglements that\
  \ could very well derail the vision that we have for Pathfinder Online. Investors\
  \ don't like to push boundaries, color outside the lines, or think outside the box.\
  \ Instead, they want you to do things only in ways already proven successful for\
  \ other companies. It is their money, after all.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20121127-Goblin.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20121127-Goblin_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Our vision for Pathfinder Online doesn't\
  \ fit those boundaries. It doesn't color within the lines. It doesn't want to exist\
  \ inside of a box. You already get that—you have believed in Paizo from the beginning\
  \ and helped us to create a unique community around the Pathfinder RPG. We would\
  \ rather report to you than to a group of investors who are only interested in making\
  \ the biggest pile of money and having an early exit strategy. You are with us for\
  \ the long haul. You believe in our vision for Pathfinder. We would prefer never\
  \ to sacrifice this vision in pursuit of bigger profits. With you, we can make an\
  \ MMO that we can all be proud of, and it can happen if we are successful with this\
  \ Kickstarter. We can do this if enough folks want to become our \"bosses\" and\
  \ work with us to make Pathfinder Online.</p> \n    <p>Another cool aspect of this\
  \ Kickstarter is that we are finally revealing how YOU can become an Early Enrollee\
  \ and get involved with the Pathfinder Online Beta. As you probably already know,\
  \ during the Beta, we are going to limit the number of folks who can enter the world\
  \ of Pathfinder Online each month, so that we can slowly begin building the society\
  \ that is going to make Pathfinder Online so successful. The new Kickstarter offers\
  \ a limited number of slots for each month on a first-come, first-served basis.\
  \ The earlier you back this Kickstarter, the earlier you will be able to get into\
  \ the Beta. After the Beta, we'll open the game to everyone, and as part of this\
  \ Kickstarter, you can preorder your copy of the game at a discounted price.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Because our customers are so important to us, we're contacting you right\
  \ away. We hope you take advantage of this early notice to become the first to join\
  \ us as we crowdforge Pathfinder Online. Crowdforge? Glad you asked. Crowdforging\
  \ is the word that we've come up with to represent the intense process we will use\
  \ to work with you, our customers, to make Pathfinder Online the best MMO it can\
  \ be. When you get into the Pathfinder Online Beta, you will become intimately involved\
  \ with the decisions that go into making a game of this size. If you have helped\
  \ Paizo playtest our various RPG projects, you understand what we are aiming for\
  \ here. No other game will give you this type of access and input into its creation.\
  \ But there are only a limited number of folks who will be able to get into the\
  \ early stages of crowdforging this game, so make sure you back our Kickstarter\
  \ soon!</p> \n    <p>In closing, we would like to thank all of you for helping us\
  \ make our dream a reality. We wouldn't be here without you, and we very much appreciate\
  \ your ongoing support. For this Kickstarter to be a huge success, we're going to\
  \ need your help getting the word out to the MMO and RPG communities. Please tell\
  \ your friends on Facebook, Twitter, various messageboards, and anywhere gamers\
  \ congregate. Together, we can grow the legions of fans interested in building our\
  \ next generation fantasy sandbox MMO. With enough support, we can all make Pathfinder\
  \ Online faster, bigger and better.</p> \n    <p>The journey is just beginning!</p>\
