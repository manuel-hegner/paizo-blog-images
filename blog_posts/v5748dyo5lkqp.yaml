  >previous article</a> offered some general strategies for choosing cards as you\
  \ build your characters; this one goes into the tactics: which cards are you looking\
  \ for?</p> \n    <h2>Upgrade your magic and elemental traits</h2> \n    <p>Your\
  \ characters will start off with mundane weapons and with subpar elements like Poison.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Prioritize grabbing Magic weapons and especially Fire magic. One of the\
  \ main reasons for this is monsters like Rise of the Runelords' Troll, which is\
  \ one of the most annoying banes ever if you don't have the Fire (or Acid) trait\
  \ to permanently put him to rest. Every Adventure Path has cards that require specific\
  \ traits to defeat, and Magic and Fire are two of the most important.</p> \n   \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-Troll.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-Troll_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ScorchingRay_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Burn it with <i>fire</i>.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Generally, it's\
  \ good to accumulate cards that upgrade your elemental traits. Poison is the worst,\
  \ because many things are immune to it. Force is the best, because not much is immune\
  \ to it. So replace Poison with Acid, Cold, Electricity, or Fire when you can, then\
  \ replace those with Force.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Diversify your traits.</i>\
  \ When you're upgrading, don't get too focused on one trait. Occasionally you'll\
  \ meet monsters like the Troll that require a specific element to defeat; more frequently\
  \ you'll meet a monster immune to particular elements. So it's always good to have\
  \ variety in your hand.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-SunFalcon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-SunFalcon_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Sometimes nothing burns like the&nbsp;cold.</p>\n    </div> \L\n\
  \    <h2>Offset gaps in your party</h2> \n    <p>When you're gathering cards, look\
  \ for ones that offset ability gaps in your party. That means if you're missing\
  \ a specific skill, get cards that will help you succeed at tests of that skill.\
  \ Allies are the most common card type that give you a bonus in a particular skill,\
  \ and they have the additional advantage that they can usually be used to explore,\
  \ which means they won't be stuck in your hand: use them to explore when there's\
  \ not an obvious need for their skill bonus.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: If you're\
  \ short on healers, get healing.</i> To offset a lack of healing spells or powers,\
  \ you can most obviously get Potions of Healing. However, there are also occasional\
  \ allies or other items that can offset this deficit. Spread these healing cards\
  \ out, and in particular give them to characters who are light on recharging and\
  \ heavy on discarding, like Seelah or Seoni.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #2: If you're\
  \ short on disablers, get toolkits.</i> If your party generally lacks the Disable\
  \ skill, spread around items that can help with traps and other barriers. Thieves'\
  \ Tools and Masterwork Tools are the obvious choices, but the Crowbar can also be\
  \ shockingly useful.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ThievesTools.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ThievesTools_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Crowbar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Crowbar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Sometimes the right tool for the job is a Tool.</p>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <h2>Upgrade your skills</h2> \n    <p>Sometimes, instead of filling ability\
  \ gaps in your party, you want to accentuate what you already have. Hunt for items\
  \ that will improve the characters' best skills to make them all the more able to\
  \ close locations (or to succeed at other skill tests). Get Merisiel Boots of Elvenkind\
  \ and Seoni a Crown of Charisma. Find a Sage for Kyra or a Standard Bearer for Harsk.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>These might not be the best boons for these characters long-term, but\
  \ improving good stats should always be a consideration.</p> \n    <h2>Don't be\
  \ afraid of inappropriate cards</h2> \n    <p>When you're improving your characters,\
  \ you'll generally want to take cards that the characters are proficient with and\
  \ to avoid the ones that they can't use to their best effect. But this is not always\
  \ the best strategy. Sometimes you'll want to take an inappropriate card because\
  \ it's better than an appropriate card, because it helps your character (or the\
  \ party) fill an ability gap, or just because it's what's available.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #1: Remember that inappropriate spells still allow one use.</i> It's perfectly\
  \ okay for Arcane casters to pick up Divine-only spells and for Divine casters to\
  \ grab Arcane-only spells. They just end up being single shots. This works best\
  \ for spells where you're not adding the skill's die. So, if your party really needs\
  \ healing, don't be afraid to give your Arcane caster Cure. Similarly, a Divine\
  \ caster could take Mirror Image to help with damage or Teleport to help with movement.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Cure.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Cure_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Teleport.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Teleport_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Don't fear that last paragraph.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #2: Remember that inappropriate armor is usable.</i> Armor can be ineffective\
  \ in two ways if you don't have the appropriate proficiency. First, it often gets\
  \ banished when you reduce large amounts of damage. Second, it often can't be recharged\
  \ at round's end. The first problem is not a problem at all: if it's great armor,\
  \ keep it, and if you use it, you can hopefully replace it with something else great.\
  \ However, not being able to recharge is problematic, because it clogs your hand.\
  \ Still, there will sometimes be inappropriate, non-recharging armor that's worthwhile.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Corollary #3: Remember that inappropriate weapons… are probably still\
  \ bad.</i> If you don't have the required proficiency for a weapon, it tends to\
  \ increase the difficulty for challenges, usually by 4. It feels like a really good\
  \ weapon should overcome this problem, but that doesn't tend to be the case. You're\
  \ unlikely to find an inappropriate weapon that adds at least 5 (or a d10) more\
  \ than an available weapon that [i]doesn't[/i] require proficiency, and that's what\
  \ you typically need for it to actually be better.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-DjinniQuarterstaff_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>The right weapon in the wrong hands is the wrong weapon.</p>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p><i>Corollary #4: Use inappropriate card to create voids.</i>\
  \ Inappropriate items that get banished (i.e. spells and armor) can work very well\
  \ in a voiding strategy where you're trying to end up with too few of a card type\
  \ so that you can choose a new card from the box. Hold onto these banishable cards\
  \ during a game when you have an excess of the card type, then banish them in a\
  \ later game when you're not gaining that type of card.</p> \n    <h2>Plan for your\
  \ blessings</h2> \n    <p>Some characters get benefits from specific blessings on\
  \ their role cards. Try to plan for this. Look at your role card early on, choose\
  \ your preferred role, and start collecting any appropriate blessings. If you don't,\
  \ it's possible you'll never get many of the right blessings, because the role card\
  \ arrives relatively late in the game.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-InheritorsBlade_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Count your blessings before they hatch. (Or something like that.)</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Sometimes building your deck is as much about what you get\
  \ rid of as what you keep...</p> \n    <h2>Don't get hung up on banishable cards</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Cards that must be banished to be used are usually powerful, so it's\
  \ tempting to always put them in your deck. Don't. Consider any banishable card\
  \ carefully and be sure that it's a great card that you'll actually use.</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>Corollary #1: Throw out banishable cards you're not using.</i> If you\
  \ didn't manage to use a banishable card for two or three scenarios, get rid of\
  \ it. It might have a great power, but if you never play it, who cares? (But before\
  \ you put it back in the box, see if perhaps another character would be more likely\
  \ to play it.)</p> \n    <h2>Don't get hung up on loot</h2> \n    <p>There's a tendency\
  \ to hold onto loot because it's unique and was given as a special prize. There's\
  \ a lot of loot that <i>is</i> worth keeping through an entire Adventure Path, but\
  \ some loot may never be valuable to you, and other loot may get overshadowed over\
  \ time. Toss it out if something else looks better!</p> \n    <p>And that brings\
  \ my look at improving characters to a close… and it also ends my series of general\
  \ strategy articles for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. I've thought about writing\
  \ some articles about the specifics of certain characters and about all the different\
  \ sorts of cards, but for now other writing is calling me. Maybe I'll return some\
  \ day.</p> \n    <p>For now, thank you to Mike Selinker and Paizo for giving me\
  \ this opportunity to talk about my strategy ideas and for publishing a game that's\
  \ racked up over 100 games on my tabletop. And thank you to everyone here on the\
  \ forums who contributed corrections and additional strategy ideas. I intend to\
  \ gather them all up at some point and use them to put together a v2 of these strategy\
  \ articles, probably on my <a href=\"http://mechanics-and-meeples.com\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Mechanics &amp; Meeples</a> blogs.</p> \n    <p>Until then, see you in\
  \ Golarion!</p> \n    <p>Shannon Appelcline<br> <i>Game Historian</i></p> \n   </div>\
