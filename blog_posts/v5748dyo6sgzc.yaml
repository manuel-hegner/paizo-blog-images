  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello! If you’re reading\
  \ this, then hopefully you’re excited to hear about the new Pathfinder Society adventures\
  \ we’re getting ready to release, because that’s pretty much all I’m going to be\
  \ talking about.</p> \n     <p>One thing I’ve seen a lot of conversation about on\
  \ the forums is how long it might take for the organized play campaign to go back\
  \ to adventuring in Tian Xia. The answer, as I’m sure you’ve just guessed, is about\
  \ this long, plus one week! Veteran author Christopher Wasko takes us back in <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021ce?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-106-Lost-on-the-Spirit-Road\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-06: Lost on the Spirit Road</a>, a Tier 1-4 repeatable\
  \ scenario. The Pathfinders head over the Crown of the World towards the nation\
  \ of Goka, where Venture-Captain Amara Li needs some help tracking down a shipment\
  \ that seems to have gone missing along the Spirit Road, a narrow trade route skirting\
  \ the Forest of Spirits. I’d love to be able to tell you more, but as a 4-hour-long\
  \ repeatable adventure, the numerous randomized elements mean even I can’t tell\
  \ you exactly what your adventure might look like! Perhaps this enterprising kitsune\
  \ can give you some advice, assuming he’s an ally this time around…</p> \n     <div\

  \ In <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021cf?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-107-Flooded-Kings-Court\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-07: Flooded King’s Court</a>, author Brian Duckwitz\
  \ takes us to the Puddles district of Absalom for a visit with royalty. Goblin King\
  \ Zusgut claimed a ruined “castle” that sits atop even older ruins. Unfortunately,\
  \ the things occupying those ruins seem less than thrilled to have a goblin “kingdom”\
  \ growing over their heads, and now Zusgut is looking for some enterprising explorers\
  \ to go search and clear the passages beneath his royal abode. Venture-Captain Drandle\
  \ Dreng looks to get on Zusgut’s good side and calls upon his Pathfinder associates\
  \ to assist. With a steady hand like Dreng’s guiding the mission and a heroic ally\
  \ like Zusgut, what could possibly go wrong?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ certainly not least, our new quest from Kate Baker takes the Pathfinders to the\
  \ high seas! In days of yore, the mighty Ulfen warrior Grehunde the Sunchaser earned\
  \ fame and glory in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. The only goal she yearned for\
  \ but never achieved was to end her days in the Ulfen holy land of Valenhall. Her\
  \ descendant, Hlavard, sought to honor her wish by taking Grehunde’s famed magical\
  \ gorget on his own journey to Valenhall, but his ship was lost somewhere in the\
  \ waters between Avistan and Arcadia. Now, Hlavard’s surviving family has reached\
  \ out to the Pathfinder Society for assistance in locating the shipwreck and retrieving\
  \ the family heirloom.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102319_GrehundesGorget.jpg\"\
