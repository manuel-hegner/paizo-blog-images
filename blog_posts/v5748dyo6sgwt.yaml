  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Velloro was adopted into a large\
  \ ysoki family on the dusty planet of Akiton as an infant, never knowing another\
  \ home—and never having much interest in finding one. His family were devout worshipers\
  \ of Iomedae, goddess of justice and honorable battle, virtues the young lashunta\
  \ gladly embraced. He spent his youth playing and scavenging among Akiton’s numerous\
  \ wrecked starships with his many siblings. Time and again, Velloro proved a fierce\
  \ protector of his family, whether extracting them from collapsed wreckage, fighting\
  \ off rival scavengers, or otherwise putting himself between them and the many other\
  \ dangers of their dying world.</p> \n     <p>When Velloro reached adolescence,\
  \ he developed into the korasha clade of his species, packing on muscle and becoming\
  \ rather headstrong. As he grew, he became less able to squeeze into the small spaces\
  \ common to salvage sites and began to look around for other ways to expend his\
  \ boundless energy. His years of roughhousing and scrapyard scrapping quickly pointed\
  \ him toward one obvious direction in Akiton’s limited job market: Velloro traveled\
  \ to the ancient city of Arl to become a gladiator. The VitariTech Coliseum, a new\
  \ sporting venue that hosted nonlethal gladiatorial combats, began rotating Velloro\
  \ into their regular fight schedule. The arena promoters capitalized on his youthful\
  \ and attractive appearance and off-world species, dubbing him the Castrovel Kid\
  \ and giving him a set of armor sporting the planet’s ancient symbol. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>As Velloro moved up through the ranks of other local combatants and gained\
  \ a small following, he also became close with a fellow gladiator, a shobhad named\
  \ Dhareen. She saw potential in the young competitor, and after defeating Velloro\
  \ in a particularly important show match, Dhareen invited the dejected lashunta\
  \ to take the Test of the Mountain. In this shobhad tradition, travelers climb to\
  \ the summit of Ka, Pillar of the Sky, the tallest mountain in all the Pact Worlds.\
  \ Velloro accepted the challenge, making the grueling 22-mile climb over several\
  \ months.</p> \n     <p>While climbing Ka, the charismatic and sociable Velloro\
  \ experienced something entirely new and, at first, unpleasant: loneliness. Yet\
  \ as his isolation grew, so too did his connection to the mountain and to his home\
  \ planet. He spent long evenings watching the wind blow dust off the volcano in\
  \ arcing swirls, and took note of how each step he took changed the mountain in\
  \ an almost imperceptible way. </p> \n     <p>One night, while sheltering under\
  \ a shallow outcropping during a violent storm, Velloro felt a strange acceptance\
  \ and calm wash over him. As he did, he noticed the whirling mixture of ashy sleet\
  \ around him turn to a gentle eddy. With sudden clarity, Velloro remembered dozens\
  \ of instances earlier in his life when he had subtly affected the state of matter\
  \ around him—events he had dismissed as coincidence or even imagined. Invigorated,\
  \ the lashunta began to intentionally exert control over his surroundings, structuring\
  \ and deconstructing the molecular lattice all around him, draining energy from\
  \ one system and pouring it into another as easily as pouring red tea between cups.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Upon his return to the Coliseum, Velloro had new purpose. He honed his\
  \ newfound skills, mastering the subtleties of molecular change and using it to\
  \ great effect in his gladiatorial matches. His tendency to crumple the armor and\
  \ weapons of his opponents as he sent them flying across the arena quickly earned\
  \ him the nickname the Castrovel Crusher. But change is constant, and as Akiton’\
  s gladiatorial combats continued to gain in popularity, the demand for blood sport\
  \ also grew. Claiming the need to compete with other arenas, including Eox’s infamous\
  \ and deadly Halls of the Living, the Coliseum’s management began to pressure Velloro\
  \ to mortally wound his opponents. Velloro adamantly refused; he saw no honor in\
  \ needless blood sport.</p> \n     <p>One day, just before a match against Dhareen,\
  \ Velloro’s manager told him, “finish her—or you’re finished.” Velloro walked into\
  \ the arena, embraced his mentor, and deliberately walked out to an uproarious mixture\
  \ of cheers and mockery, knowing he could never return to his beloved profession.\
  \ Instead, Velloro turned an eye to the stars, where he knew there were others like\
  \ his family, others who needed protection and assistance—and he knew he had the\
  \ power to help.</p> \n     <p>Having inherited no small part of his ysoki family’\
  s gregariousness, Velloro is quick to laugh and make new friends, and is an amiable\
  \ adventuring companion. His Iomedaean personal code predisposes him to giving second\
  \ chances, even to the seemingly irredeemable—but he doesn’t hesitate to unleash\
  \ his full might against unrepentant foes. And despite the sour end to his gladiatorial\
  \ career, his love of games and sport have not waned, and he is always happy to\
  \ strike his famous Castrovel Crusher pose at a fan’s request.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
