  \ only wrote some of the most chilling and flat-out awesome horror stories of the\
  \ Twentieth Century, but he also knew how to get his monster on. Fantasy author\
  \ China Miéville, one of my personal favorite modern writers, was one of the first\
  \ to point out to me that fantasy fiction monsters could basically be divided into\
  \ pre-Lovecraft and post-Lovecraft, and my own obsession with reading early Twentieth\
  \ Century genre stuff suggests he has a point. Before Lovecraft, monsters in fiction\
  \ were usually giant animals, human-animal hybrids, or basically animals with multiple\
  \ limbs. A few writers, like Edgar Rice Burroughs, mixed things up enough to invent\
  \ awesome stuff like plant men with mouths on the palms of their hands, but for\
  \ the most part you were looking at a field of giant animals.</p> \n    <p>Lovecraft\
  \ changed all of that with an assortment of alien, eldritch beings designed to scare\
  \ the crap out of his protagonists—and his readers. Many of those monsters have\
  \ gone on to inspire tabletop games and the gamers who make them, and we here at\
  \ Paizo are very much in thrall of Lovecraft's creations. Judging by the response\
  \ to our past dabbling with his themes and creatures, such as the now-classic Greg\
  \ A. Vaughan Carrion Crown adventure <a href=\"/products/btpy8l3e\">\"Wake of the\
  \ Watcher\"</a> and the monster article that accompanied it, Pathfinder players\
  \ also love his creations.</p> \n    <p>So it seemed like a good idea to get some\
  \ of them out in prepainted plastic.</p> \n    <p>Here then are three Lovecraftian\
  \ monsters from June's <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>\
  \ set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy\
  \ miniatures.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150403-MiGo.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150403-MiGo_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>One of Lovecraft's most famous monsters is the brain-stealing\
  \ Mi-Go, a flying alien creature that just loves to experiment on mankind. We've\
  \ featured Mi-Go in a few Pathfinder adventures to date (notably in James Jacobs's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\"><em>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</em></a> level),\
  \ and in the Iron Gods Adventure Path's awesomely named <a href=\"/products/btpy99sg\"\
  >\"Valley of the Brain Collectors\"</a>. The Mi-Go in Dungeons Deep is a Medium,\
  \ uncommon creature.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150403-ElderThing.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150403-ElderThing_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Elder Thing, or Old One, is one of the foremost stars\
  \ of Lovecraft's famous novella \"At the Mountains of Madness,\" one of our favorite\
  \ of his tales. It was thus a certainty that we'd get to them as prepainted miniatures.\
  \ The Elder Thing, like the Mi-Go, appears in <a href=\"/products/btpy91ds\"><em>Bestiary\
  \ 4</em></a>, where we learn that in addition to having the ability to fly around\
  \ in outer space, Elder Things \"possess a boundless capacity for war and egotism.\"\
  \ The Elder Thing is a Medium, uncommon creature.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150403-Yithian.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150403-Yithian_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Yithians starred in Lovecraft's tale \"The Shadow\
  \ out of Time,\" where they play the role of a prehistoric time-traveling race responsible\
  \ for populating much of the Earth. <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"><em>Bestiary\
  \ 3</em></a> describes them as planetary explorers eager to discover new worlds,\
  \ where they fancy swapping minds with natives to experience strange planets from\
  \ a local perspective. The Yithian, from my perspective, is one of the most impressive-looking\
  \ figures in the set, a true \"WTF\" alien to drop on your unsuspecting player characters.\
  \ The Yithian is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week!\
  \ Tune in next Friday for another glimpse at the horrors and wonders yet to come\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set!</p> \n \
