  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>Today,\
  \ we begin a strategy blog written by game historian <a href=\"http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Shannon Appelcline</a>. As Shannon says, these are strategies\
  \ for one way to play the game, based on tabletop playthroughs of all three current\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Adventure Paths, plus about a gazillion plays of\
  \ Obsidian Entertainment's addictive Pathfinder Adventures.</i></p> \n    <p>The\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is a complex game that supports extremely high\
  \ replayability. That's because you can play it in many different ways. The core\
  \ of playing PACG is understanding the three crucial resources that form the core\
  \ of the game: <i>time</i>, <i>cards</i>, and <i>decks</i>.</p> \n    <h2>Time is\
  \ the First Most Valuable Resource</h2> \n    <p>PACG has a constantly ticking clock.\
  \ Normally, if you advance through 30 player-turns without completing your goal,\
  \ you lose the game. It's a balance between two hourglasses: the blessings deck\
  \ timer, which counts down the turns, and the location timer, which lays out what\
  \ still needs to be explored.</p> \n    <p>That means that <i>everything</i>should\
  \ be seen through the lens of time. If you fail to defeat a bane, that's not necessarily\
  \ disastrous, but it <i>does</i> cost you a turn. Conversely, if you play a blessing\
  \ or an ally that allows an extra exploration, or a detection spell that successfully\
  \ enables an exploration, you gain a turn. Minimize your lost turns and maximize\
  \ your gained turns and you'll practically guarantee a win.</p> \n    <p>With that\
  \ said, running out of time and losing isn't a big deal. It just means that you\
  \ need to play the adventure again. Don't put your character's life at risk to win\
  \ an adventure, and if you get to the point where you decide you're losing, look\
  \ toward other priorities (like improving your deck).</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #1: Build decks to take extra turns.</i> Give your character cards that will maximize\
  \ your turns. This is easy for Kyra, who has tons of blessings, and Lini, who recharges\
  \ her animal companions. It's trickier for Ezren, who has no blessings, and Sajan,\
  \ who needs to conserve his blessings for super punching. Though most characters\
  \ should give preference to allies who give extra explorations, that's particularly\
  \ important for these blessing-impaired characters. Characters like Ezren also need\
  \ to concentrate on gaining turns via other means, such as the Detect Magic and\
  \ Haste spells.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #2: Play cards to take extra turns.</i>\
  \ This mostly refers to blessings: you want to be conservative about using them\
  \ for their extra dice effect when they could otherwise provide extra turns. It's\
  \ particularly easy to misuse blessings when you're trying to save a character who\
  \ got backed into a dark alley by a bad combat. If you're looking at spending two\
  \ or four blessings to save him, carefully consider whether it's worthwhile. Is\
  \ saving the cards in his hand plus killing the monster really worth those two to\
  \ four lost bonus turns? (Maybe, but you should make the calculation.)</p> \n  \
  \  <p>You should even think about whether it's worth recharging a card like an ally\
  \ that you could otherwise discard for a new turn. This is a tougher calculation\
  \ because it's advantageous to keep cards in the deck, and you will <i>probably</i>\
  \ eventually get to discard that card for its extra turn when it drifts back up\
  \ through your deck.</p> \n    <p>The idea of focusing on cards' turn-gaining ability\
  \ becomes moot if you've played aggressively enough that your blessing timer has\
  \ caught up with your location timer. When this happens, become more willing to\
  \ play your blessings and allies for purposes other than just pushing forward—particularly\
  \ for improving your deck, another PACG priority.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #3:\
  \ Don't worry about player count!</i> When you have more players, it feels like\
  \ you need to play faster, but that isn't necessarily true. Whatever your player\
  \ count, you just need to close two locations, then you have the right number of\
  \ characters left to spread out and be ready to temporarily close all the locations\
  \ when someone stumbles upon the villain.</p> \n    <p>With that said, player count\
  \ does change the way that PACG plays. Lower player counts bring the blessing timer\
  \ and the location timer into balance, but they decrease the amount of support you\
  \ get from other players (in the form of blessings) and the amount of coverage you\
  \ have for different skills. PACG is probably tougher with a smaller party… but\
  \ that's not necessarily due to the timer.</p> \n    <h2>Cards Are the Second Most\
  \ Valuable Resource</h2> \n    <p>PACG has another ticking clock: the cards in your\
  \ character deck. If they run out, your character dies. And you're encouraged to\
  \ run out because playing more cards generally helps you accrue time, and that's\
  \ the <i>biggest</i> ticking clock in the game.</p> \n    <p>This means that Cure\
  \ is the most important card in the whole game. It lets you recycle 1d4+1 cards,\
  \ which could easily be 1d4+1 extra turns. If you know there are Cures in the game,\
  \ then you can play more aggressively and make it more likely that you'll complete\
  \ the scenarios.</p> \n    <p>The other healing spells and powers are important\
  \ too. Kyra is likely the most powerful character in Rise of the Runelords because\
  \ of her heavy density of blessings combined with her Heal power, which gives her\
  \ the ability to return cards just by spending one of her plentiful Divine cards\
  \ and a first exploration. Seelah is probably the second most powerful character\
  \ if you take the Hospitalizer role, because she can freeform heal by burying Divine\
  \ cards. And that's to say nothing of cards like Father Zantus, Staff of Minor Healing,\
  \ and others.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Give multiple heals to Divine casters.</i>\
  \ Consider giving any Divine spellcaster in your game two Cures so that they'll\
  \ come up frequently, and so that you can use one to recover the other if you roll\
  \ badly on a recharge. At higher levels a Mass Cure or even a Pillar of Life can,\
  \ of course, substitute for one of those Cures.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #2: Give\
  \ healing ability to other characters!</i> This can take the form of Father Zantus,\
  \ Staff of Minor Healing, or even Potion of Healing. This lets these characters\
  \ play aggressively too, without worrying about having to hook up with Kyra, Seelah,\
  \ Lini, or Lem.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #3: Back off if you need healing!</i>\
  \ You never, ever want to lose your character to death in PACG. Do your best to\
  \ ensure it's not a possibility. If you're getting to the point where your draw\
  \ pile is the same size as your hand size, give up adventuring. Stay in a nice,\
  \ safe, closed location while the rest of your fellows continue on. (And tell someone\
  \ to come heal you!)</p> \n    <h2>Decks Are the Third Most Valuable Resource</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>One of the trickiest aspects of PACG is that you're not just trying to\
  \ win an individual game. You're also trying to improve your character to make it\
  \ more likely that you'll win future games too. That means that you sometimes have\
  \ to spend your short-term time resources and card resources to improve your long-term\
  \ deck resources.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Don't worry about gathering boons\
  \ you don't want.</i> If you encounter a boon that's clearly not going to improve\
  \ anyone's deck, and if it's not likely to give you extra turns or other notable\
  \ advantages in your current game, don't expend resources to collect it.</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>Corollary #2: Do worry about gathering boons you do want.</i> If a card\
  \ <i>would</i> improve someone's deck, expend the effort to collect it. If it's\
  \ a big improvement, you should do this even if you have to spend turns (blessings)\
  \ to do so, and maybe even if you might lose the game as a result.</p> \n    <p><i>Next\
