  \  </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hail and well met to the Paizo community!\
  \ My name is Tonya Woldridge and I am the new Organized Play Coordinator for the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I am honored to be chosen and will strive to step up and swing for the fences.\
  \ The creativity of my Pathfinder Society teammates, John Compton, Linda Zayas Palmer,\
  \ and Tanis O'Connor, defies words. The dedication of the \"Venture Officer Corp\"\
  \ is the stuff of legend. Together, we are working to bring you the best campaign\
  \ possible and I look forward to unveiling more over the upcoming months.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Working at Paizo is returning to my roots. I grew up in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho,\
  \ about 5 hours from the Paizo office, and spent 2 years at the relatively local\
  \ University of Puget Sound. My extended family is dotted throughout the Pacific\
  \ Northwest. I love the rain, mist, and mountains! If you want a beautiful vacation\
  \ destination, the Olympic Peninsula is the best.</p> \n    <p>My gaming journey\
  \ started in high school with 2nd Edition AD&amp;D. Over the years, my various home\
  \ groups worked their way through Earthdawn, and 3.0/3.5. We were on the Shackled\
  \ City Adventure Path when Pathfinder Beta released, and our GM (My husband, 5-Star\
  \ GM extraordinaire \"Crispy3ed\") converted the campaign from 3.5 to Pathfinder.\
  \ I went to the third PaizoCon UK and was hooked on organized play. Since then,\
  \ I've been a Venture-Lieutenant in the United Kingdom, a Venture-Captain in Canada,\
  \ a Gen Con HQ volunteer for the past three years, and achieved 5 Star GM status.\
  \ When the Adventure Card Game released, we started with the <em>Runelords</em>\
  \ box set and have continued through the next editions.</p> \n    <p>My husband\
  \ is a Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force and we have 2 children. As\
  \ a military spouse, my family has been fortunate enough to travel the world, spending\
  \ 14 of the past 18 years living in England, Canada, and Korea. Our US posts include\
  \ Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. While not fluent in foreign languages, I understand\
  \ Korean, German, French, and several varieties of English.</p> \n    <p>Outside\
  \ of Pathfinder, I enjoy reading books across a variety of genres, with Anne McCaffrey,\
  \ Sharon Shinn, George R. R. Martin, David Gross, and Diana Gabaldon all in my top\
  \ 10 author list. Another hobby is researching historical methods of crafting, sewing,\
  \ brewing, dancing, singing, and cooking. I have been a member of the Society for\
  \ Creative Anachronism for over 20 years. This love of all things medieval led to\
  \ getting a Bachelor's degree in History from the University of Maryland. I also\
  \ have a Bachelor's in Asian Studies, as I fell in love with Korea when we lived\
  \ there and needed to know more.</p> \n    <p>I thank the leadership at Paizo for\
  \ their trust and support as we strive to bring a fantastic experience to the community.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Cheers!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
