  \ Game Returns to Gen Con!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 2, 2016</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p>We're going back to Gen Con, the\
  \ place the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game made its debut! And boy, do we have some\
  \ cool stuff for you to see and do.</p> \n     <p>But before we dive into that,\
  \ Paizo's kind enough to let me share this: Tanis, Gaby, and I wrote a puzzle novel\
  \ called <em>The Maze of Games</em> a few years back, and it's featured in a <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/books/puzzle-book-bundle\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Humble Puzzle Bundle</a> we're running for <i>one more day</i>. Some of the proceeds\
  \ go to our favorite charities: the It Gets Better Project, Worldbuilders, and Child's\
  \ Play. If you like our puzzles and you like ponying up for good causes, pop on\
  \ over there and take a look.</p> \n     <p>OK, Gen Con!</p> \n     <h2>Come See,\
  \ Hear, and Talk to Us!</h2> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/RetaBigbad.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/RetaBigbad_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>You can come see Paizo in booth #300—we'll be demoing\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask\">Mummy's Mask</a>, which will\
  \ be out in October. And a lot of the Lone Shark team will be in booth #2847 showing\
  \ off the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OizL5EZMzVM\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Apocrypha</a> adventure card game. If you're an ACG fan, this is the show to be\
  \ at.</p> \n     <p>Say you want the signature of some of the designers. My crewmates\
  \ and I will be signing at the Paizo booth on Sunday from noon to 1 pm. You can\
  \ also find me and the other designers signing at the Lone Shark booth for an hour\
  \ on each of the four days; check the schedule at booth #2847. You can get your\
  \ Reta Bigbad signed!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">There's more Pathfinder\
  \ ACG to be found in the seminar rooms. Mike and Chad will join Penny Arcade's Mike\
  \ \"Gabe\" Krahulik to talk about the evolution of their arc of games, including\
  \ some discussion of PACG, at the panel Big Co-Op Game: From Betrayal to Thornwatch\
  \ on Thursday at 1 pm. Right after that, at the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game panel\
  \ on Thursday at 2 pm in room 212 of the convention center, our team members will\
  \ talk about Mummy's Mask, the Goblin decks, and other such awesomeness. Then on\
  \ Friday at 1 pm, at the Pathfinder &amp; Obsidian Entertainment panel, we'll chat\
  \ up the digital game and all the cool things to come from that. If you like hearing\
  \ us talk about things you like, you'll hear us a lot at Gen Con.</p> \n     <h2>Come\
  \ Play the Adventure Card Guild With Us!</h2> \n     <p>The Sagamore Ballroom will\
  \ have lots of Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild games running, including\
  \ not-yet-released installments of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liyq\">Season\
  \ of the Runelords</a>. Plus there are three events that are anything but ordinary.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS02B01.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS02B01_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>First up: <a href=\"http://gencon.highprogrammer.com/gencon-2016.cgi/event/CGM1699620\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Season of the Goblin</a>! (That link is to the first session,\
  \ but there are about a million others.) You can play characters from the brand-new\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9k5m\"\
  ><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> decks if you like, or you can play a character from\
  \ any other class deck, but—spoiler alert—you get turned into a goblin. So if you\
  \ always wanted to play Seelah without all that do-goodnik attitude, this is your\
  \ time. Adventure 1 (of 2!) in Season of the Goblin was written by Tyler \"Cartmanbeck\"\
  \ Beck, David \"Theryon Stormrune\" Jacobson, and our own Keith \"Keith Richmond\"\
  \ Richmond. It's freakin' bonkers. Go play it at Gen Con.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOACGS0800E.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOACGS0800E_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>There's a very special tournament called <a href=\"\
  http://gencon.highprogrammer.com/gencon-2016.cgi/event/CGM1698008\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >The PFS Interactive Special: The Cosmic Captive</a>. This is an idea we've been\
  \ kicking around for a while: What if we bring together Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild players and Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild players in a single\
  \ cooperative event? And then [redacted] you to [redacted]? Well, you should have\
  \ heard us snickering about it. If you like either the ACG or the RPG, you'll find\
  \ this a perfect match for your sublimely good taste in games.</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ then there's the <a href=\"http://gencon.highprogrammer.com/gencon-2016.cgi/event/CGM1699638\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild: Gen Con Open Tournament</a>,\
  \ our competitive battle between teams of PACG players. This year, we have a cunning\
  \ twist to the format: You don't need to bring a class deck to this one. Instead,\
  \ we'll give each four-player team four class decks at the start of round one. We're\
  \ not going to tell you what class decks they are, though I will say that they each\
  \ have three characters in them. From those four class decks, each player chooses\
  \ a character, marks it on their team's form, and builds a deck in a limited time.\
  \ Should that team be lucky enough to make it to round two, they'll get the same\
  \ four class decks, except this time they can't play any of the four characters\
  \ they played before. Then if that team makes it to the finals, they have to use\
  \ the last unused character in each deck. So this is an exercise in careful planning\
  \ and time management. Also, we aim to kill some characters. Good luck to all the\
  \ challengers!</p> \n     <p>Those are our plans for Gen Con. It'll be a wild time\
  \ and we hope you can join us. See some of you there!</p> \n     <p>Mike Selinker<br>\
