  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">September 15th through October 15th is recognized\
  \ in the United States as Hispanic Heritage Month, recognizing the independence\
  \ dates of many Latin American countries, including Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador,\
  \ Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Chile. Since 1988, the United States has celebrated\
  \ Hispanic and Latine contributions to American culture during this month. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>The theme of this year’s Hispanic Heritage Month is Prosperity, Power,\
  \ and Progress! In celebration, we’ve invited some of our Latine contributors and\
  \ coworkers to speak on our blog.</p> \n     <br> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Joseph Blomquist (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>¿Qué es la que\
  \ hay corillo?</p> \n     <p>This month’s theme of prosperity, power, and progress\
  \ is a chance to talk about growth in my freelance work. I’ve worked for a slew\
  \ of companies over the years on reviews, rules, and narrative work. I’ve had the\
  \ chance to include elements of the islands I love in the games I love. And over\
  \ time, my stories, word counts, and NPCs have (some literally) grown.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>If you’ve played my previous adventures here at Paizo, you know that I try\
  \ to toss in a lot of theme and character into the background. For example, in <em>SFS\
  \ 2-21 Illegal Shipment</em>, I leaned into the claustrophobia of Fogtown; in <em>PFS\
  \ 4-02 Return to the Grave</em>, the dark haunted forests of the Gravelands were\
  \ as much a character as the fallen NPCs you face; and the upcoming <em>PFS 5-05\
  \ The Island of the Vibrant Dead</em> is set on an island inspired by the Caribbean\
  \ paradises I only visited in my youth.</p> \n     <p>Yet how much can ambiance\
  \ prepare you for what is to come? How ready are you for giant robots versus kaiju\
  \ in both <em>Mechageddon!</em> and <em>Pacific Rim</em> coming for you ahorita?\
  \ Everything that went into my scene building has grown to encompass the scale of\
  \ what is coming soon. And I can’t wait to share it with you.</p> \n     <br> \n\
  \     <h3>Carlos Cabrera (he/they)</h3> \n     <p>Hi everyone. I am a third party\
  \ and Paizo freelancer for Pathfinder, voice actor, and as of last year and concurrently\
  \ along with my daughter, burgeoning board game designer! With this year’s theme\
  \ I thought I would highlight where I’ve come from personally, professionally, and\
  \ culturally.</p> \n     <p>The board game design I sold felt more my own than my\
  \ usual work. It was made without outline or prompt, pitched, and sold, and not\
  \ so much a piece of a greater whole as RPG books go (which I still do, gratefully).\
  \ Then a cousin of mine reminded me I said at 9 years old I wanted to make my own\
  \ game. I was 39 then, so you can imagine how emotional I was that it took me that\
  \ long.</p> \n     <p>In addition to that accomplishment, I have special reason\
  \ to be proud this month. As a mixed-race person of color, I have had my words in\
  \ print, my voice and likeness in video games, and I’ve become more comfortable\
  \ with myself, using aspects of my own culture in the characters I create—be it\
  \ in LARP or future works. Eventually that will include my own logo, and for my\
  \ daughter’s works as well.</p> \n     <p>To see more of what our Latine contributors\
  \ bring to Paizo, take a look at these previous Hispanic Heritage Month blogs:</p>\

  \ have a diverse set of voices contributing to the games we make here at Paizo,\
  \ because we know their perspectives make our worlds richer and better!</p> \n \
