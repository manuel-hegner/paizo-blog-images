  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, January 22, 2018</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p>Greetings, Pathfinders!</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It's been\
  \ a while since the last Pathfinder Battles preview blog, in part because the blog,\
  \ like the proverbial torch, has passed to a new patron: Me! As Paizo's Franchise\
  \ Manager, I work closely with all of our licensors to ensure that their products\
  \ are the highest quality and accurately reflect both the Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ brands. This includes, of course, the Pathfinder Battles line of pre-painted plastic\
  \ miniatures from our longtime partner, WizKids!</p> \n    <p>And what better debut\
  \ blog content than the announcement of a new set?</p> \n    <p>In May, WizKids\
  \ and Paizo will be releasing the fourteenth (!) full set in the line: <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"><em>Pathfinder Battles:\
  \ Jungle of Despair</em></a>. This set features 44 randomized figures, plus six\
  \ new pieces of set dressing, all themed around jungle exploration, ancient ruins,\
  \ and (mostly) natural threats. As with past sets, those fans who purchase a full\
  \ case of <em>Jungle of Despair</em> will be eligible to purchase a Huge case-incentive\
  \ figure, and man is this one fun!</p> \n    <p>Hydras are a classic jungle threat,\
  \ dating back to ancient Greek mythology, and we're happy to introduce the legendary\
  \ beast to Pathfinder Battles with this incredible figure. While it's impressive\
  \ on its own, what really makes this sculpt exciting are its interchangeable heads.\
  \ That's right. When your neophyte adventurers chop one of the beast's five heads\
  \ off without proper application of fire to the writhing stub, you can simply replace\
  \ the single head with two, representing in exquisite plastic detail the growing\
  \ threat facing the poor player characters. Check out both the 5- and 10-headed\
  \ versions of the Hydra!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-Hydra5.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-Hydra5_180.jpeg\"></a> <a\
  \ href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-Hydra10.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-Hydra10_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The hydra isn't the only serpentine threat found in <em>Jungle\
  \ of Despair</em>, either! The featured villains in this set are none other than\
  \ the sinister, ancient serpentfolk, who ruled the world for thousands of years\
  \ before the advent of pesky, warm-blooded humanity. The Serpentfolk Cleric, below,\
  \ is just one of the new serpentfolk figures in the set (stay tuned for previews\
  \ of the rest in the coming weeks). The Serpentfolk Cleric is a Medium uncommon\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-SerpentfolkCleric.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-SerpentfolkCleric_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Not all serpentine threats in the set are members of\
  \ the psychic ophidian race, however. Some, like the Hollow Serpent, are undead\
  \ monstrosities the serpentfolk create to defeat their foes. Animated from the sloughed-off\
  \ skin of a giant snake, the Hollow Serpent is a perfect high-level threat for any\
  \ serpentfolk-based campaign (including the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/serpentsSkull\"\
  >Serpent's Skull Adventure Path</a>). The Hollow Serpent is a Large Rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-HollowSerpent.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-HollowSerpent_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The jungle also serves as home to countless natural inhabitants,\
  \ including innocent animals and vermin just trying to get by in a harsh, unforgiving\
  \ world. Take this Giant Leech, for example. It doesn't mean you any harm, really.\
  \ It's just hungry. Why'd you have to go swimming through that murky water in the\
  \ first place? You had it coming, honestly. The Giant Leech is a Medium Common figure,\
  \ meaning you're likely to get a few of them in your collection, and you can fit\
  \ eight of them around the typical player character for some bloodsucking fun.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-GiantLeech.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-GiantLeech_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, we have the mischievous Tanuki—raccoon-like\
  \ monstrous humanoids inspired by Japanese mythology and common in the temperate\
  \ forests of Tian Xia. While they often appear in disguise as other creatures (especially\
  \ when infiltrating sake-filled festivities in human civilizations), this figure\
  \ represents the creature as it's most likely to appear in combat against the player\
  \ characters. The Tanuki is just one of several protectors of the natural world\
  \ found in <em>Jungle of Despair</em>, but certainly the cutest! The Tanuki is a\
  \ Medium Uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180122-Tanuki_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>That's it for this week's preview! Fans with max ranks in Perception\
  \ may note that WizKids previewed all of these figures last fall when they announced\
  \ the set, but have no fear! Next week it's all new reveals — When Plants Attack!</p>\
