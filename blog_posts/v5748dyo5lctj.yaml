  date\">Monday, November 7, 2011</p> \n   <p>We are very proud to announce PaizoCon\
  \ 2012, our annual gathering of Paizo staff, special guests, Pathfinder RPG players,\
  \ and members of our message board community! 2012’s event will take place on July\
  \ 6–8 at the Marriot Redmond Town Center hotel in Redmond, Washington. In addition\
  \ to the regular annual festivities, PaizoCon 2012 is a celebration of Paizo’s 10th\
  \ anniversary, as well as 5 years of the Pathfinder Adventure Path! The entire Paizo\
  \ staff as well as a community of Pathfinder gamers, artists, and designers will\
  \ be on hand with special events created just for the show. If you’ve never had\
  \ a chance to visit PaizoCon, 2012 is definitely the best year to start. And if\
  \ you have been to the show before, we look forward to seeing you again!</p> \n\
  \   <p>You can <a href=\"/store/byCompany/p/paizoPublishingLLC/paizocon/v5748btpy8pfa\"\
  >order your $40 three-day convention badge</a> today. While you’re at it, be sure\
  \ to pick up <a href=\"/store/byCompany/p/paizoPublishingLLC/paizocon/v5748btpy8pfd\"\
  >a ticket to the highly anticipated Pathfinder Preview Banquet</a>, where we show\
  \ off upcoming products and reveal secrets you won’t be able to learn anywhere else!\
  \ The banquet has sold out every year we’ve held it, so it’s a good idea to pick\
  \ up a ticket as soon as you’re sure you can make it to the convention.</p> \n \
  \  <p>This year we are pleased to announce a new location for PaizoCon: <a href=\"\
  http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/seamc-redmond-marriott-town-center\" target=\"\
  _blank\">The Marriot Redmond Town Center</a> hotel, a great facility situated along\
  \ an outdoor shopping center with plenty of excellent options for local dining and\
  \ quality shopping (including a game store and comic shop!). The hotel features\
  \ more space for games and seminars than our previous location, an on-site bar and\
  \ restaurant, and more rooms for attendees. The Marriott has extended a special\
  \ offer of $85 per night for PaizoCon guests, available until June 13th. Make your\
  \ hotel reservation by calling 1-425-498-4000, and don’t forget to mention PaizoCon\
  \ to get the special room rate!</p> \n   <p>Stay tuned to the Paizo Blog in the\
  \ coming weeks for more announcements about our Guests of Honor, special game industry\
  \ guests, and events. In the meantime, please check out the <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fy\"\
  >PaizoCon FAQ</a>, which answers a lot of commonly asked questions about the convention.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Please also visit <a href=\"/paizocon\"><b>paizo.com/paizocon</b></a>,\
  \ the official homepage of the convention, where we’ll post additional details as\
  \ they become available.</p> \n   <p>We’re delighted to host this convention again,\
  \ and to celebrate 10 successful years in game publishing! Please help us celebrate\
  \ in July by attending PaizoCon 2012. We can’t wait to game with you!</p> \n   <p>Erik\
