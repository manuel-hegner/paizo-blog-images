               <blockquote>
                <p itemprop="description">No two characters worship the same way. How and why they worship their deities are as varied as the player base of Paizo’s organized play campaign. Many players choose for their characters to follow the examples of several deities, seeing a personal connection between them that motivates and inspires their journey. In some cases, adventuring parties form around one of these custom pantheons, becoming regional memes that take on a life of their own. Perhaps you have created a Pathfinder pantheon yourself?</p>
                <p>Now you have the chance.</p>
                <p><em>Lost Omens: Gods &amp; Magic</em> introduced us to a set of rules for creating and worshiping polytheistic pantheons. Developer Luis Loza graciously showed us more examples in his blog post, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh2v">Friends in High Places</a>. The Know Direction Network in collaboration with the Organized Play Team invites you to submit a brand-new pantheon, with the best submission becoming a sanctioned option for the Pathfinder Society!</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20200121-godesses.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="max-width:75%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20200121-godesses.jpg" alt=""></a>

                </div>
                <p>There will be several stages to the contest. Upon receipt, Know Direction staff will review all submissions for contest criteria compliance (say that five times fast). After that, Know Direction judges will select their top pantheons from the anonymized entries and send them to Paizo Organized Play staff, for vetting as potential includees in the organized play program. From the vetted pool, the Know Direction judges will select their favorites. Paizo will host a highlight blog about the finalists and launch a period of voting by the public. Once voting closes, the winner will be announced via blog post on paizo.com, invited to participate in an episode of the Know Direction podcast, and the pantheon will be sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder (second edition) Society.</p>
