  description\">It seems obvious that you want to beat banes, because they can hurt\
  \ you ... but it turns out that the calculation <i>shouldn't</i> be that simple.\
  \ It's about knowing when to be brave.</p> \n     <h2>Be brave if you have armor</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Fighting monsters and leaping through barriers is dangerous, so there's\
  \ the temptation to massively overinvest in a way that you wouldn't for other encounters—\
  to increase the odds to an almost certainty.</p> \n     <p>You should avoid this\
  \ temptation <i>if you have armor</i>. Most armor (but not shields) allows you to\
  \ bury (or banish) the card to reduce all damage to you. You should consider this\
  \ armor's main use: it lets you take chances when you're fighting monsters, without\
  \ large repercussions.</p> \n     <p>Yes, you potentially lose a turn, because you\
  \ may have to fight that same monster on a future turn. But no matter what the results,\
  \ if the alternative is to use one or more blessing, you probably come out ahead:\
  \ maybe you win despite the lack of blessing or maybe you won't encounter the monster\
  \ again. Either way, you potentially gain a turn. And if you were going to play\
  \ a couple of blessings, you came out way ahead.</p> \n     <p>So that's what being\
  \ brave means: <i>take the chance of being defeated by the bane</i>.</p> \n    \
  \ <h2>Be even braver if you have no cards</h2> \n     <p>Similarly, you shouldn't\
  \ worry too much about losing to monsters if you have few or no cards in your hand.\
  \ In this case, there's almost no downside, other than the potential to lose an\
  \ exploration if you must fight the monster again. But since the alternative is\
  \ usually to burn blessings ... give yourself a good chance, but don't worry about\
  \ making it a sure chance.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Empty your hand if you're\
  \ going to lose.</i> Sometimes, you might choose to create the situation where you\
  \ have few or no cards. This is particularly applicable if you think you're going\
  \ to lose the fight. Recharge everything that you legally can, so that those cards\
  \ don't get discarded. Then play all the discardable cards that might give you a\
  \ bonus on the check. It might seem a waste to spend cards just to give yourself\
  \ a very unlikely chance of beating a bane, but if you're going to lose your cards\
  \ anyway, then you might as well try. (If a bane isn't actually going to empty your\
  \ hand, such as the Charmed Faceless Stalker or many barriers, then obviously this\
  \ advice does not apply.)</p> \n     <h2>Be the bravest if you are encountering\
  \ a summoned bane</h2> \n     <p>These rules about being willing to lose when faced\
  \ with damage are especially true when you're fighting summoned monsters that you\
  \ don't actually benefit from beating. This doesn't include summoned monsters that\
  \ you must beat to close locations or to defeat barriers like Zombie Horde. But\
  \ it does include those annoying skeletons that are summoned by the Skeleton Horde\
  \ barrier or the bandits that are summoned at the Guard Tower. If you don't need\
  \ to beat them, then don't expend <i>any</i> resources if you have another out (like\
  \ armor or an empty hand).</p> \n     <p>The one caveat to this approach is that\
  \ sometimes those summoned banes are summoned by other banes, and you usually need\
  \ to beat <i>the summoners</i>. Getting your hand wiped before you do is rarely\
  \ a good strategy.</p> \n     <h2>Be less brave otherwise</h2> \n     <p>If you\
  \ don't have armor, if you have lots of cards, and if you're not fighting a summoned\
  \ beast, then you should be less brave; in other words, worry more about beating\
  \ the beast.</p> \n     <p>Still, you shouldn't consider victory over the bane a\
  \ necessity. Think about what you would lose in your hand if you got beat up, add\
  \ in the possibility of a lost turn if you encounter the bane again, and weigh that\
  \ against the turns and other opportunities that will be lost from played cards.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Maybe you'll decide that the bane must be beat or maybe you'll decide\
  \ that it's acceptable to take a chance. The important thing is to consider it as\
  \ a <i>choice</i>—not a <i>fait accompli</i>— just because you're meeting a scary\
  \ monster or bane.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: The more blessings you spend,\
  \ the more blessings you should spend.</i> Whenever you decide to spend resources\
  \ rather than bravely taking the chance of being defeated by a bane, you need to\
  \ make sure that you spend enough. That's because you're now spending turn-resources\
  \ and you don't want to waste them. So if you're playing no blessing, because the\
  \ circumstances warrant it, that's fine. But if you're playing one blessing, then\
  \ consider whether playing two would increase your chances enough to be worthwhile.\
  \ Every turn <i>and</i> every blessing is an investment: spend them wisely.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Be even less brave against annoying monsters</h2> \n     <p>You should\
  \ work even harder to beat a monster or a barrier if it's particularly annoying\
  \ for some reason. The Enchanter is a prime example of an annoying monster, because\
  \ she does 1 Force damage before then 1 Fire damage after every fight. Similarly,\
  \ Collapsed Ceiling is definitely an annoying barrier, because it can do damage\
  \ and sticks around. There are even more annoying banes at higher levels.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In general, if a bane has other costs every time you meet it, particularly\
  \ if those costs are high, or if a bane sticks around on top of a deck or next to\
  \ someone's character, be a little less brave when fighting it—not because you're\
  \ afraid of it, but because you want to get rid of the darned thing!</p> \n    \
  \ <h2>Be the least brave against villains and henchmen</h2> \n     <p>Finally, don't\
  \ be brave at all when fighting villains and henchmen. They're the critical-path\
  \ banes in PACG because defeating them lets you close locations and eventually win!\
  \ These are the fights where you should be quite conservative, making your odds\
  \ as good as you possibly can (within reason).</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Don't\
  \ spend too much on henchmen.</i> With most henchmen, however, be aware of what's\
  \ on the other side. Usually, you must do something to close the henchman's location.\
  \ If you spend your last blessing on the henchman, and then need to banish a blessing\
  \ to close the location, you did all that work for nothing.</p> \n     <p>As for\
  \ villains...</p> \n     <p><b>Next month:</b> Fighting the villains.</p> \n   \
