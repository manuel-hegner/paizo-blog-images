  \ Gets Difficult</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 8, 2016</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">A couple of weeks\
  \ ago, we debuted <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventures</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/obsidian\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Obsidian Plays Twitch Stream</a>. Viewers got to see a new feature that\
  \ many card game players have been begging for: adjustable difficulty. Now you can\
  \ play in several modes: Normal, Heroic, and Legendary Difficulty, with or without\
  \ permanent character death. To kick things off, I played Black Fang's Dungeon on\
  \ Legendary Difficulty with 6 characters. Even though I've played Black Fang literally\
  \ hundreds of times at this point, I still sweat bullets in this, my favorite play\
  \ mode.</p> \n    <p>Let me walk you through another good scenario...</p> \n   \
  \ <p>I recently jumped into Trouble in Sandpoint in \"Burnt Offerings.\" After selecting\
  \ the scenario and watching a short cutscene, we see the scenario preview which\
  \ would normally show a power telling me that after encountering a Wrathful Sinspawn,\
  \ I would have a 1 in 6 chance of discarding blessings from the blessings deck.\
  \ As you see below, things have changed... a bit.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Scenario_360.jpeg\"></a>\n     <br> <i>Who\
  \ needs a blessings deck anyway?</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Instead of a 1 in 6 chance\
  \ of losing blessings, it's 1 in 2. Given that most of the henchmen, one of the\
  \ location closing conditions, and the villain's summoning power will trigger this,\
  \ my time is limited.</p> \n    <p>But wait, there's more! I've also been given\
  \ two \"Wildcard\" powers. Wildcards are additional randomly chosen increases in\
  \ difficulty. Night is approaching which means that each time I fail to get a boon,\
  \ I lose another blessing, and coupled with the driving rain, those boons will be\
  \ even harder to get. Time is definitely not on my side.</p> \n    <p>But wait,\
  \ there's even more! I can move only to an adjacent location. Let's see what that\
  \ means.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Setup.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Setup_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Amiri and Seelah leap into danger, while Ezren and Lem chill\
  \ at the Apothecary. Yeah, that's about right.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is\
  \ our location selection screen to place characters before the scenario begins.\
  \ There are now connections between all of the locations and now movement is limited\
  \ to those travel lines. No longer will healers be able to parachute into any location\
  \ they're needed. So I have to place each character carefully using a strategy that\
  \ takes into account location deck composition, location power, closing check, connections\
  \ to the locations around it, distance from other characters, and an ideal path</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I see a couple challenges immediately:</p> \n    <ol>\n     <li>Two Intelligence/Knowledge\
  \ location closures are spread far apart, but for Lem to be effective, I want to\
  \ group him with Ezren.</li> \n     <li>Shrine of Lamashtu is connected only to\
  \ the Old Light, so it's isolated. I decide to post Seelah there because, let's\
  \ face it, she was made to face the Shrine.</li>\n    </ol> \n    <p>So we're set!\
  \ Let's take a look at what this looks like in game.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Map.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Map_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Welcome to Sandpoint, where you'll find bunyips aplenty in Ven\
  \ Vinder's general store.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>From this view, which we call\
  \ the scenario view, you can better see the spatial and thematic reasons that the\
  \ travel lines are configured in this way. The Village House is acting as a hub\
  \ and the Shrine to Lamashtu is the most remote location on the map. Not all locations\
  \ map exactly to a place in Sandpoint, but if you look at the map of Sandpoint in\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0\"><em>Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition</em></a>,\
  \ you’ll find that the Old Light, Junk Beach, and the Glassworks are all in the\
  \ right places; the Apothecary is located at Pillbug Podiker’s, and the Village\
  \ House is at the White Deer tavern and inn.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of the Village\
  \ House, let's fast forward to the end of the Scenario. I have 2 blessings left\
  \ before the scenario ends. Those blessings went fast! Ezren's moved over to Village\
  \ House, Lem and Harsk have converged on the Waterfront, Amiri and Merisiel are\
  \ tied up at their starting locations, and Seelah's just closed the Shrine. Ezren\
  \ defeated the henchman last turn so he knows he's about to fight the villain. The\
  \ Old Light is open.</p> \n    <p>If only I had a way to get someone over to Old\
  \ Light...</p> \n    <p>Ezren knows that he's got a useful spell in his deck and\
  \ he just drew Detect Magic. Ezren understands that the best way to hit a dangerous\
  \ enemy is... carefully. And he embarks on some rather arcane planning. He casts\
  \ Detect Magic to look at the villain he already knows to be there, and activates\
  \ his Expanded Spellbook and comes across...</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Stride.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Stride_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Swift like a Sajan!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>...Stride! Perfect!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Stride is Obsidian's version of Levitate. We found that while Levitate\
  \ was a good card (particularly for Legendary difficulty), it would have to prompt\
  \ at the end of each character’s turn to activate properly, which can get old real\
  \ fast. We pitched an alternate version with less versatility in some ways and more\
  \ in others to Mike Selinker, Chad Brown, and Vic Wertz. Vic made an excellent point\
  \ that we'd be diverging enough from the original Levitate card that it would make\
  \ sense to call it something else. And since it's a new card, new art!</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Anyway, back to the matter at hand. It's time for Seelah to move to The Old\
  \ Light and do hero's work. Ezren pulls Erylium from the location deck and trusts\
  \ in his friends to close their locations. Everyone does their part, leaving Seelah\
  \ to try an Intelligence check.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-TempClose.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-TempClose_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <i>Seelah's got this because she's literally the best character.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>It's tough, but with the power of prayer and Irori's blessing...</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Closed.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Closed_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Faith is just as good as brains to Seelah.</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>She nails it! Now all that's left is for Ezren to blast Erylium to bits\
  \ with all of the remaining dice.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Zap.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Zap_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Lightning never gets old!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Boom!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Now that you have a sense for how Legendary Difficulty works, I'll give\
  \ a super-brief history of this feature. One of the first big shifts we made from\
  \ PACG was the use of maps and points to show the locations. Almost immediately,\
  \ it was clear that we could do something more with maps, but we held off for a\
  \ long time. We started developing the concept for having increased difficulties\
  \ based on a number of factors. We knew that there was a strong desire to replay\
  \ scenarios from Rise of the Runelords and many of you have run through Perils of\
  \ the Lost Coast many, many times. I also spent some time checking out a lot of\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/homebrew\"\
  >homebrew mods</a> people had done to make the game their own. I put this version\
  \ of restricted movement together before PaizoCon last year (along with some other\
  \ stuff we will talk about soon) and requested a meeting with the original PACG\
  \ development team at the convention.</p> \n    <p>I think I led with, \"We love\
  \ your game! Development is going really well! Here's my plan to screw it all up.\"\
  \ Mercifully, the whole team was excited and on board! They gave us a lot of fantastic\
  \ input across the board.</p> \n    <p>The plan simmered for a while as we were\
  \ nailing down other parts of the project, like the tutorial and roles. At the end\
  \ of last year, David Williams (Designer for Legend of the Five Rings, Doomtown,\
  \ and so many more) joined the team here at Obsidian and locked down our difficulty\
  \ design and added the concept of randomly chosen Wildcard powers which makes such\
  \ a big difference in replayability and challenge level.</p> \n    <p>Dave will\
  \ be joined by art lead and UI designer Andre Nguyen and artist Lindsay Laney in\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/obsidian\" target=\"_blank\">another Twitch stream\
  \ this Friday at 4 PM Pacific time</a>! Be sure to check it out!</p> \n    <p>Nathan\
