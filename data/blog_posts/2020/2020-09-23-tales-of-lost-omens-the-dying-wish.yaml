  description\">At least this time, Newt knew the firestorm he was heading toward.</p>\n\
  \              <p>It was Johenn’s fault. It was always Johenn’s fault. What was\
  \ worse, Newt owed him a favor. So when the longshank had discovered him in the\
  \ middle of some research at Forae Logos, the largest library in Absalom, the uncharacteristically\
  \ erudite monkey goblin found himself recruited.</p>\n              <p>Within the\
  \ hour, they returned to the safety of the Grand Lodge and made their way into the\
  \ lowest level of the gardens. Still a few too many longshanks to make Newt comfortable,\
  \ but at least there were fewer stares, fewer glares. Here, at least, he knew he\
  \ belonged, and he had the wayfinder to prove it.</p>\n              <p>The first\
  \ to spot Johenn was a young woman in a fancy, blue and white dress, her light brown\
  \ hair tied in a playful braid at the back of her head. Her eyes brightened as she\
  \ recognized the young man and perked in excitement. She did a quick double-take\
  \ upon seeing Newt, but her attention was fast to return to the young man, and her\
  \ voice rose to greet him.</p>\n              <p>“<em>Please</em> tell me you found\
  \ it.”</p>\n              <p>Johenn flashed her a playful grin as he hopped the\
  \ last stair, answer in itself. With his usual flair for the dramatic, the dark-haired\
  \ man reached into his long overcoat and revealed a large, leather-bound book. He\
  \ pranced over to where the young woman sat, sweeping the journal in an arc to rest\
  \ before her.</p>\n              <p>“Tonight’s selection for the lady,” he crooned\
  \ as she accepted it. “Hadagaskar’s <em>Recollections on the Lost Kingdoms</em>.\
  \ Might I suggest a pairing of some blackberry wine or perhaps a dessert plate?”\
  \ Not waiting for an answer, he turned his attention to another nearby companion.\
  \ This elder human held himself proudly, his copper-and-white beard carefully braided\
  \ and ringed.</p>\n              <p>Reaching into another pocket of his longcoat,\
  \ Johenn withdrew a scroll case, twirling it expertly in one hand before presenting\
  \ it with a flourish. “And for the distinguished gentleman, a light palate cleanser:\
  \ <em>From [Horn] to [Chair-with-Raised-Staff]: a Refresher on Pre-Giant Logograms.\
  \ Volume 3.</em>”</p>\n              <p>The man nodded, taking the scroll case,\
  \ gently releasing its protective latch and sliding the contents into his eager,\
  \ gnarled hand.</p>\n              <p>“And, my friends, please allow me to introduce\
  \ to you the sharpest mind I know.” Johenn motioned towards the dark blue monkey-goblin.\
  \ “My old friend and adventuring companion, Newt. Newt, might I present to you Lady\
  \ Zaya—“</p>\n              <p>“Just Zaya,” she corrected.</p>\n              <p>“\
  —just Zaya, and her beloved hound, Alouicious.” The gray mutt looked up upon hearing\
  \ his name, took quick account of the surroundings, and laid his head back down.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Ranger,” Newt said with a nod, and was met with a delighted smile.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Well spotted,” Johenn grinned. “Our dear lady is with the Horizon\
  \ Hunters, and a forward scout for her team when she is not taking her leisure among\
  \ us.”</p>\n              <p>Newt was amused to find Zaya rolling her eyes – something\
  \ which he himself had done at Johenn’s dramatics many times.</p>\n            \
  \  <p>“And our be-robed gentleman is Cromberly,” Johenn continued. The elder’s age-clouded\
  \ eyes were already darting eagerly over the scroll; he raised a gnarled hand, distractedly\
  \ waving a greeting.</p>\n              <p>“Cromberly here has a heart for adventure\
  \ to put shame to us all,” Johenn smiled. “And an impressive knack for survival,\
  \ I hear.“</p>\n              <p>“Fine to meet you both,” Newt acknowledged, “but\
  \ let’s get right to the import of it. Johenn’s only started telling me about your\
  \ mystery, and I’m keen to help. Catch me up.”</p>\n              <div class=\"\

  \  </div>\n              <p>Zaya considered where to begin. “We discovered Five\
  \ Eyes by accident; my team was originally sent to the Impossible Lands, off the\
  \ coast of Jalmeray.”</p>\n              <p>“Following up on Padiskar?” guessed\
  \ Newt.</p>\n              <p>Zaya chuckled. “That’s what Cromberly guessed too.\
  \ But no, Padiskar’s old news.”</p>\n              <p>Without looking up, Cromberly\
  \ entoned, “Padiskar was built around the ruins there, with strict laws and lots\
  \ of borders to make sure no one intrudes on the creature down there. It was even\
  \ reviewed by the Vigilant Seal and is considered safe for now.”</p>\n         \
  \     <p>Zaya agreed. “Padiskar’s in the north, and we were off Jalmeray’s southern\
  \ coast. We were there to investigate an environmental phenomenon: the sudden appearance\
  \ of odd-shaped trees, fully formed and emerging straight from under the water.”\
  </p>\n              <p>Newt nearly interrupted with a question, but then stopped\
  \ himself. <em>Impossible Lands</em> indeed.</p>\n              <p>“Their sudden\
  \ arrival attracted a number of pilgrims, who claim the appearance of these trees\
  \ was the dying wish of their old, benevolent god, Five Eyes. The trees themselves\
  \ seem harmless, and the pilgrims have been peaceful. We’re keeping an eye out.\
  \ Since I’m here, I’ve been taking the opportunity to look more into Five Eyes.”\
  \ Zaya lifted the tome Johenn just gave her.</p>\n              <p>Newt nodded thoughtfully,\
  \ his golden eyes shifting to Johenn as the dark-haired man continued the story.\
  \ “I’d really just meant to assist our beautiful ranger in her research” – another\
  \ eyeroll from Zaya – “but, through fate or folly, my own recent adventures seemed\
  \ tied to hers.”</p>\n              <p>He paused for a moment, allowing the silence\
  \ to stretch. And stretch.</p>\n              <p>“Johenn,” Newt said distastefully,\
  \ waving his hand. “Performance later. Details now.”</p>\n              <p>Johenn\
  \ grinned sheepishly, caught in his old habit. “Of course, of course. Forgive me.\
  \ My most recent assignment was in the Menador Mountains, in Old Cheliax. We were\
  \ sent there to investigate some newly-discovered caves in the area. Imagine my\
  \ surprise when we discovered our old <em>friend</em> there.”</p>\n            \
  \  <p>This time, Newt <em>did</em> understand the meaningful pause. He hissed a\
  \ quiet name. “Alden.”</p>\n              <p>Johenn nodded somberly. “Apparently,\
  \ the Aspis Consortium also heard of this potential find. It got….<em>tricky</em>.\
  \ It became less of a careful expedition and more of a race to find and catalogue\
  \ everything we could before Alden and his team got a hold of it or destroyed it.”\
  </p>\n              <p>Newt grumbled, and Johenn nodded empathetically. “We’d discovered\
  \ a series of old cave paintings, sculptures, and inscriptions… Newt, it was <em>amazing</em>.”\
  </p>\n              <p>The goblin asked the more pressing question: “Was anyone\
  \ hurt?” <em>Again</em>.</p>\n              <p>Johenn shook his head, and Newt released\
  \ the breath he didn’t remember holding.</p>\n              <p>“It was close,” Johenn\
  \ admitted. “But we got out safely. The fool demolished the cave to get at something\
  \ beyond the wall. We held the area as long as we could, while I combined all of\
  \ our bookthief brew. We copied everything we could, but there was so much. It was\
  \ nearly impossible to figure out which paintings were the most important. With\
  \ a fight incoming, we had to make a lot of guesses. I’d been taking tracings of\
  \ some of the inscriptions, but there wasn’t time to complete them.”</p>\n     \
  \         <p>“You did well,” the goblin rumbled. “Agents first.”</p>\n         \
  \     <p>Johenn nodded, though Newt could tell that the loss of the information\
  \ hurt the archivist keenly. “We got out with what we could. I made copies of what\
  \ we were able to save with the brew…seems to be a series of writings on an enormous\
  \ creature…”</p>\n              <p>“…with five eyes,” Newt finished the sentence,\
  \ guessing. Johenn arched his brows in ascent.</p>\n              <p>“Zaya and I\
  \ have been pooling our resources since then. Some of my saved pages caught complete\
  \ phrases, so we’ve been able to translate those. With the rest, well…that’s where\
  \ Cromberly comes in. He’s got a knack for languages.”</p>\n              <p>“Got\
  \ it,” Newt nodded. “So what do you have so far?”</p>\n              <p>“It’s patchy,”\
  \ admitted Zaya. “Johenn’s team did a fantastic job saving what they could. But\
  \ that still leaves us with only snips of information and a lot of guesswork.”</p>\n\
  \              <p>Johenn offered his journal to Newt. The goblin accepted it and\
  \ sat down a few paces from Zaya. The monkey-goblin grunted as he paged through\
  \ the scribed, translated pages. “Five Eyes Awakened…mm-hmm…old wrongs set right…\
  unbound, unfettered, unrestricted…the dying wish…”</p>\n              <p>“There\
  \ were a lot of those symbols repeated on the lost cave wall,” Johenn offered, reading\
  \ over the goblin’s shoulder. “Especially mentions of Five Eyes, and a lot of repetition\
  \ about his dying wish.”</p>\n              <p>“Hm. What’s this part here, about\
  \ ‘no dragon remains, only bones’? And here, where it’s paired with the dying wish.”\
  \ Newt squinted at one of the pages critically, tucking a pinky into the book to\
  \ save his spot while he looked back a few pages. A grunt of annoyance passed his\
  \ lips as he found another passage; his tail snaked around to help him hold the\
  \ extra page.</p>\n              <p>“Hm. Here.” His tail pointed to one page. “\
  It’s talking about Five Eyes ending the age of dragonkind. And here, again. Is that\
  \ part of this ‘dying wish?’ Or was that maybe how he himself died…?”</p>\n    \
  \          <p>“I’m not sure,” Zaya admitted.</p>\n              <p>“It all reads\
  \ like a prophecy,” grunted Newt, the last word dripping, poisonous.</p>\n     \
  \         <p>“Well. At least <em>that</em> would be nothing to worry about,” chuckled\
  \ Johenn with a sardonic smile. “Prophecies are reliably unreliable these days.”\
  </p>\n              <p>“True,” acknowledged Cromberly, finally looking up from his\
  \ scrolls. “But it’d be folly to ignore what we found, even if it’s a legend we’\
  re researching. The sudden trees in Jalmeray means <em>something’s</em> happening.\
  \ Best if we went in prepared.”</p>\n              <p>Newt nodded and continued\
  \ paging through Johenn’s sketches. Something nagged at him. “Tell me more about\
  \ the trees you discovered, Zaya.”</p>\n              <p>The woman nodded, reaching\
  \ into her satchel and drawing out her own field notebook. “The trees were petrified.\
  \ Each had its own root system extending below the water, with tendrils lost in\
  \ the ocean floor.” She turned a page. “All these trees had a spiraling grain along\
  \ the wood, but each spiral was grown over itself. It looked like veins, really.”\
  </p>\n              <p>Zaya turned another page and flipped the book around to show\
  \ Newt a rough sketch. “None of the trees had any growth or sign of life. Just…\
  a copse of petrified, swirling trees.”</p>\n              <p>Newt blinked a few\
  \ times. “I don’t know if you meant to do so, but your sketch certainly makes those\
  \ trees look like pointed teeth to me.”</p>\n              <p><em>Root System. Veins.\
  \ Teeth.</em></p>\n              <p>And that was what he needed to remember. He\
  \ snapped his fingers. “Several months ago, I was part of an investigative crew\
  \ in the thick of the Mwangi Expanse. We were looking into the theft of relics from\
  \ a local museum. The thieves completely bypassed some of the more obvious and lucrative\
  \ targets, instead opting to take the petrified remains of an ancient, mostly unknown\
  \ creature.”</p>\n              <p>“What did you learn about it?” prompted Cromberly.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“There were more questions than answers. The display was of several\
  \ petrified teeth the length of a human arm, and a few, sharp-ended scales that\
  \ belonged to a creature only called <em>Ko’kquali</em>, so named for the formation\
  \ of its teeth. There wasn’t much more to learn about it – it’s largely a mystery\
  \ – but professors believed the creature to be the apex predator of its time, feasting\
  \ on dragons as easily as today’s dragons feast on sheep.”</p>\n              <p>“\
  Oh, my.” Cromberly had grown pale</p>\n              <p>“I see your friend speaks\
  \ the dialect,” the goblin ventured.</p>\n              <p>Nodding, Cromberly spoke\
  \ up. “Ko’kquali. Five <em>points</em>. Not eyes.”</p>\n              <p>“So…” Johenn\
  \ swallowed. “So hear me out here. It seems like Zaya here discovered a newly-formed\
  \ place, set for worship by pilgrims for Five Eyes. A place that looks like petrified,\
  \ stony teeth.”</p>\n              <p>Zaya nodded.</p>\n              <p>“Some ancient\
  \ remnants of an old creature that <em>ate dragons for a teatime snack</em> have\
  \ been stolen. And that creature was named Five Points.”</p>\n              <p>Newt\
  \ nodded.</p>\n              <p>“…and my team just found a whole bunch of cave paintings\
  \ – literally writing on the wall! – about Five Eyes, how the age of dragonkind\
  \ will come to an end, and how there’s some dying wish.”</p>\n              <p>A\
  \ long silence hung over the agents. Johenn reached for his journal, and Newt handed\
  \ it back wordlessly.</p>\n              <p>Johenn lifted the book and asked one\
  \ last, quiet question. “What if this isn’t a legend, isn’t a prophecy… What if\
  \ these are <em>instructions</em>?”</p>\n              <p>Newt cleared his dry throat.\
  \ “Then I’d say that we have a long journey ahead of us, Johenn. Let’s get the word\
  \ out, and then we have a lot of answers to find. And <em>quickly</em>. Before we\
  \ find out what the Dying Wish can do to Golarion.”</p>\n             </blockquote>\n\
