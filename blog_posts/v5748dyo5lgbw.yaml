  \ by Wayne Reynolds\n    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Open hostilities between\
  \ the kingdoms of Taldor and Qadira ceased more than 200 years ago, but subtle squabbles\
  \ and sub-rosa schemes continue to the present. Often these intrigues take the form\
  \ of economic influence or political stratagems, but occasionally, when the stakes\
  \ are high enough, they extend to outright atrocities. Triggering these strikes\
  \ (or answering them in kind) without sparking an open war requires an agent with\
  \ particular expertise. An agent like Zadim.</p> \n     <p>Zadim, the so-called\
  \ \"Shadow of Sarenrae,\" travels the lands of the Inner Sea as an associate of\
  \ Sarenrae's church, providing deadly solutions to problems the religion cannot\
  \ resolve through diplomacy and forgiveness. The world of Golarion teems with misguided\
  \ folk who can be turned from darkness, but it also contains multitudes who are\
  \ beyond redemption, who revel in evil, wickedness, and selfishness. Zadim is one\
  \ answer to their depravities, and his response comes with an unmistakable air of\
  \ finality. Zadim was born into Qadira's influential Cult of the Dawnflower, a militant\
  \ sect devoted to rooting out evil and spreading Sarenrae's light throughout foreign\
  \ lands cloaked in the darkness of ignorance. His early studies at the great temple\
  \ in Katheer distinguished Zadim as a dedicated servant of the cult. True, Zadim\
  \ lacked the divine connection to the goddess that granted many of his fellow cultists\
  \ command over fabulous magic powers, but his acumen in other affairs soon gained\
  \ the attention of the cult's inner circle. Zadim excelled in battle training, easily\
  \ besting his young peers in combat. He also proved himself an expert in observation\
  \ and understanding, often taking advantage of personality quirks and tells among\
  \ his fellows that they weren't even aware they had. The cult's leaders knew exactly\
  \ what they had in Zadim—a weapon to strike killing blows against their enemies.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Zadim's masters began tempering their stories of Sarenrae's mercy and\
  \ redemption with encouragement to bring justice to the irredeemable. They revealed\
  \ the scope of their designs not just on familiar foes like the creaking \"empire\"\
  \ of Taldor to the north, but also on places like Osirion, Katapesh, and Absalom.\
  \ Zadim was trained to stand in the shadowy vanguard of their efforts throughout\
  \ the Inner Sea region, clearing away enemies with blade and garrote long before\
  \ the more visible elements of the Dawnflower Cult made their presence known.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As the depth of the cult's plan became clear to him, Zadim began to\
  \ realize that his masters were just as interested in spreading the political influence\
  \ of Qadira—and its distant puppetmasters in the Padishah Empire of Kelesh far to\
  \ the east—as they were in spreading the doctrine of the Everlight, but the revelation\
  \ came too late to inspire a change in Zadim's direction. He had trained for years\
  \ to become a killer, and kill he must, in the name of Qadira, Kelesh, or the cult.\
  \ Sarenrae had blessed him with unique talents, and he intended to put them to use\
  \ in the field.</p> \n     <p>Zadim's first assignment outside Qadira was meant\
  \ to be easy, a clear-cut case of a true villain deserving of the cult's final justice.\
  \ The noble Sir Gordreth Chrysolian—Gordreth the Butcher—had been an administrator\
  \ in the Taldan caravan city of Yanmass when he publicly executed twenty clerics\
  \ of Sarenrae about 30 years ago, during a particularly vicious Taldan pogrom against\
  \ the Cult of the Dawnflower. Shortly thereafter, the Butcher vanished, escaping\
  \ divine retribution for his unholy crimes. Recently, though, agents of the cult\
  \ spotted the aging aristocrat in Yanmass, and Zadim was dispatched to put him to\
  \ the blade.</p> \n     <p>Upon arriving at the caravan city, Zadim learned from\
  \ his informants that the Butcher had sought asylum at the manor house of a respected\
  \ paladin of Abadar named Jevantus, who had gained widespread acclaim in the city\
  \ after using his god-given abilities to cure hundreds of children infected with\
  \ the deadly dvezda plague. Further investigation revealed that the paladin Jevantus\
  \ and Gordreth the Butcher were one and the same man. The decades in hiding must\
  \ have taught the vile Taldan noble something of chivalry and honor, for Abadar\
  \ himself blessed the one-time villain with miraculous powers of healing.</p> \n\
  \     <p>A chance encounter with a fellow servant of Sarenrae, an earnest young\
  \ cleric named Kyra, triggered a crisis of faith in Zadim, and the killer revealed\
  \ his role in the plot to the young woman. Kyra, who subscribed to a far less militant\
  \ doctrine than that preached by the Dawnflower Cult, rejected Zadim's bloody tactics,\
  \ reminding him that Sarenrae herself valued goodness, redemption, and healing over\
  \ murderous tactics, no matter the quarry. If Gordreth the Butcher had truly been\
  \ redeemed, killing him for past deeds meant directly violating the most holy values\
  \ of Sarenrae, erasing the man's redemption in an act of bloody murder.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Such an affront, she assured, would be enough for Sarenrae to withdraw her\
  \ favor from a dedicated follower, stripping away the divine bond so important to\
  \ the servant's faith and work. But Zadim was not a cleric, and had no spells to\
  \ lose. His duty was not just to Sarenrae, but to his masters in the Cult of the\
  \ Dawnflower, and to Qadira, and to the Padishah Empire of Kelesh. If they decreed\
  \ that Gordreth the Butcher must die, who was Zadim to deny their wisdom? He assured\
  \ Kyra that he would not strike against the paladin, but to himself he resolved\
  \ that he could not make the decision of whether his target would live or die until\
  \ he could look him in the eye and judge the quality of his character for himself.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That evening, Zadim crept into the private gardens of Jevantus, kukris\
  \ in hand, his pounding heart nearly giving him away with its thundering. At the\
  \ center of the garden he discovered the old paladin praying to Abadar before a\
  \ beautiful fountain. Statues of children rescued from the ravages of disease peered\
  \ over the paladin's shoulder as Zadim stepped silently toward his prey. As he approached,\
  \ the paladin turned toward Zadim, a strange expression of calm and acceptance marked\
  \ upon his visage. It was as if he had expected such a visitor for many years, and\
  \ knew that final judgment had finally arrived.</p> \n     <p>As he looked into\
  \ the eyes of his quarry at last, fists clenched around the hilts of his hungry\
  \ blades, Zadim made his choice.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
