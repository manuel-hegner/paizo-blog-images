  description\">A few weeks ago, Christopher Carey let me know he was leaving Paizo\
  \ to begin a new adventure in California. My heart was heavy, since Chris has been\
  \ a mentor and friend throughout my time here, but it was also full of joy for him,\
  \ since he and his (Top Secret) new opportunity are a perfect match!</p> \n    \
  \ <p>From the Paizo crew...</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Jason Bulmahn (Director of\
  \ Game Design)</b>: \"Chris has been an institution at Paizo, or at least it seems\
  \ that way. I remember when he first started, back in our old offices and one of\
  \ his first tasks was editing the <em>Core Rulebook</em> for the Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game. It seems like forever ago, and it was. Since then, he has touched nearly\
  \ every book we've made, and all of them have been improved by his efforts, by his\
  \ insight, and by his skill. As he leaves for an exciting opportunity, I have to\
  \ wish him all the best, but I am sad to see him go. Best wishes my good man.\"\
  </p> \n      <p><b>John Compton (Lead Developer)</b>: \"Neither Chris nor I are\
  \ terribly good at small talk, so when we both slumped into lobby chairs at Gen\
  \ Con 2014(?) after a long day, we just spent a long while enjoying the silence.\
  \ At some point one of us prompted the other along the lines of \"We work together,\
  \ but I don't feel I know you. So, tell me about yourself?\" And so the floodgates\
  \ opened as we swapped life stories, nerded out about our shared backgrounds in\
  \ archaeology, discussed fiction, and talked way later than either of us had intended.\
  \ Whether it's trying to determine what the proper demonym of a made up region should\
  \ be, just walking into the other's work area to listen in on an interesting conversation\
  \ about historical nuance, or explaining \"yes, this NPC's purposefully acting this\
  \ way, but you're right that it could do with more context,\" I will miss working\
  \ with you Chris and have learned a lot from you. All the best in your future endeavors!\"\
  </p> \n      <p><b>Adam Daigle (Managing Developer)</b>: \"It's been great getting\
  \ to know and work with Chris over all these years. Editors are largely invisible\
  \ unless you find a mistake, but they are among the most valuable part of the process\
  \ of making books. They make us writers and designers look good and keep us from\
  \ embarrassing ourselves. Chris has made me look like a better writer over the course\
  \ of ten years (from freelancer to developer).</p> \n      <p>\"It's going to be\
  \ weird not having Chris here. He's been with the company over ten years, so he's\
  \ taking a lot of institutional knowledge and experience with him, but I know that\
  \ he's bringing skill, charm, and an amazing calmness to his next venture. We'll\
  \ miss you tons, Chris! Don't be a stranger!\"</p> \n      <p><b>Leo Glass (Editor)</b>:\
  \ \"When Chris interviewed me for my position at Paizo, he remarked, 'We are all\
  \ so lucky to have careers working in tabletop games, working here at Paizo.' He\
  \ followed those comments with a story of how almost 10 years ago he met Paizo's\
  \ Publisher, Erik Mona, at a convention, spent hours talking about pulp fiction,\
  \ and was subsequently hired as an editor at Paizo. The thought occurred to me that\
  \ at almost every interview I've ever had, someone has remarked how fortunate they\
  \ were to work where they were. But in Chris's tone, I inferred a subtle vulnerability,\
  \ a sense of transparency and genuine gratitude as if he was pulling back some sort\
  \ of invisible curtain, revealing to me how much working for Paizo had changed his\
  \ life for the better. And he wanted to share that with <i>me</i>. When my offer\
  \ came, those words were a big part of why I leaped off the cliff and moved whatever\
  \ belongings I couldn't part with 1,600 miles across the country to join the Paizo\
  \ family.</p> \n      <p>\"I didn't realize it then, but after a year of working\
  \ in a cubicle a few feet behind him, I have come to realize that with Chris, there\
  \ is no curtain. He wasn't just being open and honest during the interview. He is\
  \ consistently and steadfastly genuine every day. He treats every editor, every\
  \ colleague, as an old friend, no matter how long they've been there. When he followed\
  \ me on a pass, he never hesitated to compassionately and patiently walk me through\
  \ what I could have improved on or what might have been missed, not to point out\
  \ a flaw, but because he was invested in my success and continual improvement as\
  \ an editor and Paizo's commitment to producing excellent products. As a mentor,\
  \ Chris has taught me so much about how to fine-tune a sentence, edit rules text,\
  \ and make sure every table, every character, every rule, is perfect. He is a fierce\
  \ and meticulous defender of grammar, concision, consistency, and eloquence, and\
  \ I hope that in learning from his example, I can hope to help carry on his legacy.\
  \ In addition to all that, he's also damn funny, and laughing with him, especially\
  \ when we were both deliriously tired right before a big deadline, always made whatever\
  \ mountain of words we were climbing at the time seem a little smaller.</p> \n \
  \     <p>\"Thanks Chris, for your friendship, guidance, professionalism, and mentorship.\
  \ I wish you all the best in your next endeavor and can't wait to hear tales of\
  \ your adventures shaping the Burroughs 'verse over a beer soon. You were right.\
  \ We are lucky to work at Paizo because of people like you who make it a great place\
  \ to be—who make it a family. Until we meet again, my friend.\"</p> \n      <p><b>Amanda\
  \ Hamon (Managing Developer)</b>: Chris Carey is one of the most quietly loud people\
  \ I know. Sound confusing? To explain: Chris has a quiet, thoughtful, and kind demeanor\
  \ that enhances his skills as one of the best editors I know. In his understated\
  \ but self-assured way, he always suggests the best ways to clarify game text's\
  \ intended meaning—often making me, as the developer or designer, say, \"Aha! Yes!\
  \ That's so much better. Please use that phrase.\" Chris's intellectual methods\
  \ and approach have helped me become a better editor myself, whether it's editing\
  \ my own work or floating to Paizo's team of editors, as I did regularly early in\
  \ my tenure at the company. All that doesn't even touch the second part of my assertion,\
  \ though. Chris is indeed a consummate and quietly assured editor, but it wasn't\
  \ until I had worked at the company for a while that I realized he's also a big\
  \ deal as a fiction author. Google \"Christopher Paul Carey\" and you'll find reams\
  \ of novels, novellas, short stories, and more that bear Chris's name. He's written\
  \ an authorized sequel to Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Moon Maid—how cool is that?\
  \ Chris is such a metaphorically loud authorial and editorial presence, but you'd\
  \ never know it from meeting him. Chris, we're going to miss that presence here\
  \ in the office, but I know you're going to go on to do even more amazing things.\
  \ I can't wait to hear what they are!</p> \n      <p><b>James Jacobs (Creative Director)</b>:\
  \ \"I can't say that I remember the day Chris joined Paizo like it was yesterday,\
  \ because it was over a decade ago and I've gotten that much older since then. I\
  \ do remember his interview though, and being incredibly impressed by his passion\
  \ for genre fiction and his attention to detail. Over the years, between the good\
  \ (Bigfoot day and Lovecraft Film Festival trips even if the festival was sold out\
  \ by the time we got there being but the most recent examples) and the not so good\
  \ (wisdom teeth! AIEEEE! Where's a tooth fairy when you need one?), I've had the\
  \ honor of calling Chris not just a co-worker, but a great friend. He played the\
  \ ranger Zandu Vorcyon in my Shadows Under Sandpoint game back in the day, a man\
  \ haunted by the ghouls who orphaned him. When he was building his character and\
  \ agonizing over the choice of favored enemy, I mostly let him choose his own path\
  \ there—knowing that whatever he chose would end up playing a significant role in\
  \ the campaign to come. I suspect he chose ghouls because of the evocative illustration\
  \ of them Wayne Reynolds did for the cover of <em>Skinsaw Murders</em>, but whatever\
  \ the reason, the campaign certainly developed a ghoulish tinge. Trips to Pauper's\
  \ Graves, explorations of unexpected tunnels under the Sandpoint Cathedral, and\
  \ a big bad end boss of a ghoul alchemist were but three ways Chris's character\
  \ decision not only helped to shape the campaign, but build up lore surrounding\
  \ Sandpoint. Since this ghoulish alchemist, Kanker (see the Sandpoint book for his\
  \ stats!), ended up blowing up Sean K Reynold's cleric in the campaign's climactic\
  \ battle, you can, in a way, say that Chris was responsible for killing of the party's\
  \ cleric! Thanks for the monster ammo, Chris! And never fear… Zandu is in good hands.\
  \ Hands that might inflict paralysis as they reach up out of the loamy sod from\
  \ a shallow grave, but… well, no. They're chaotic evil hands. Still, I'm sure Zandu\
  \ can take care of himself and persevere and triumph. If only because I know that\
  \ you will as well, Chris, in what comes next! Congrats, man, and I'll miss ya!\"\
  </p> \n      <p><b>Jason Keeley (Developer)</b>: \"I began my career at Paizo as\
  \ an editor sitting right next to Chris, so he was constantly subjected to my questions\
  \ about style and grammar and for that, I thank him. Later, I pestered him into\
  \ letting me write one of the Pathfinder's Journals for the Strange Aeons Adventure\
  \ Path and for that, I am so grateful. Chris is a talented, thoughtful person and\
  \ we are going to miss him so much here!\"</p> \n      <p><b>Lyz Liddell (Editor)</b>:\
  \ \"Chris is a rock—in all the best ways! He's been around for so long that it's\
  \ hard to imagine our team without him, and he has the institutional knowledge and\
  \ experience that comes with having worked on an entire edition of the game. He's\
  \ always been around to answer questions, provide helpful insights, and carry on\
  \ even when things get really rough. He's also tremendously supportive, both in\
  \ words and in actions, as a team member and as a colleague and friend. I'm hugely\
  \ excited to see him move on to a job that is such a phenomenally good fit for him,\
  \ but we're gonna miss him like crazy!!\"</p> \n      <p><b>Ron Lundeen (Developer)</b>:\
  \ \"Chris is the kind of editor every developer wants to work with. He certainly\
  \ has the skill and tenure to say, \"you did this wrong, we should do it this way,\"\
  \ but that's not Chris's style. He's both collaborative and thoughtful, and he's\
  \ eager to entertain discussions about how to approach a final product with the\
  \ ultimate user—the gamers who will use it at their table—in mind. I'll always value\
  \ my discussions with Chris about how to make a product both clear and compelling.\
  \ Thanks, Chris, and I know you'll excel in your next adventure!\"</p> \n      <p><b>Robert\
  \ G. McCreary (Creative Director)</b>: \"Just over 9 years ago, I was hired as an\
  \ assistant editor for Paizo, and I joined James L. Sutter and Chris Carey as the\
  \ third member of the editorial team. Since that time, many things have changed—\
  I moved to the development side of things, Chris became senior editor, and the editorial\
  \ team has grown much larger than just three people. But what hasn't changed is\
  \ the high regard I have for Chris, both as a professional colleague and a friend.\
  \ Since my very first day at Paizo, Chris has shared his exceptional knowledge and\
  \ editorial mastery with me, making me both a better editor and better developer.\
  \ Of course, I'm not the only one who has benefited from Chris's expertise, as Paizo's\
  \ entire editorial staff can attest.</p> \n      <p>\"Chris was also my first Gen\
  \ Con roommate as a Paizo employee, and our late nights after the con discussing\
  \ our favorite pulp and sci-fi authors blossomed into a true friendship that I will\
  \ always treasure. I'm so excited for Chris about the new opportunities that have\
  \ opened up for him, and while I'll miss him, I know he'll continue to excel in\
  \ what I hope is his true dream job. Good luck, Chris, and if I ever wake up confused\
  \ on Mars like another Virginian, I know who to get in touch with!\"</p> \n    \
  \  <p><b>Sonja Morris (Art Director)</b>: \"Chris is awesome, both as an editor\
  \ and a person—I will miss him very much.\"</p> \n      <p><b>Adrian Ng (Editor)</b>:\
  \ \"Chris, thank you for being a mentor and a friend during our time together at\
  \ Paizo. I wish you the best in your adventures on Barsoom—no doubt, you'll do great!\"\
  </p> \n      <p><b>Patrick Renie (Developer)</b>: \"Chris Carey is a great editor\
  \ and a fantastic guy. During my first GenCon with Paizo in 2011, Chris was basically\
  \ my rock; we were rooming together and I was totally overwhelmed by the convention\
  \ but Chris taught me the way to stay sane during it all (go to bed early and drink\
  \ lots of water). I'll never forget our desperate search around the convention center\
  \ for a Starbucks, a cafe, one of those Seattle's Best vending machines—anywhere\
  \ we could get a latte. (We had to settle for energy drinks.) His ability to consistently\
  \ write and edit so much fiction is nothing short of awesome, and I'm not sure he\
  \ knows how much of an inspiration he is to me when it comes to getting words on\
  \ paper. While his departure makes my heart ache, I am so excited for his next adventure,\
  \ since I know that anywhere Chris goes magic is sure to follow.\"</p> \n      <p><b>Michael\
  \ Sayre (Developer)</b>: \"I am really, really bad at saying goodbye, but I feel\
  \ like I would regret not saying something about Chris and the positive impact he\
  \ had on me during this last year. Chris and I bonded over a shared love of Edgar\
  \ Rice Burroughs stories. We had a lot of great conversations that built from this,\
  \ especially during a few evenings at GenCon where other people with similar shared\
  \ interests were able to join us. Chris is someone whose quiet wisdom is readily\
  \ appreciated, and will be sorely missed in his absence. I regret that we didn't\
  \ have more time and opportunities to converse, since every time we did I felt like\
  \ I left the conversation a little better off than before we spoke. Best of luck\
  \ in your future endeavors my friend!\"</p> \n      <p><b>Owen K.C. Stephens (Starfinder\
  \ Design Lead)</b>: When I first arrived at Paizo there was a tricky transition\
  \ for me, from freelancer who never had to touch a manuscript after I turned it\
  \ over to developer who needed to shepherd it and answer questions about it at every\
  \ step, including editing. Chris was a crucial part of my coming to understand how\
  \ that process worked, and I will always be grateful to him for his professionalism,\
  \ vast knowledge base, and friendly approach to such collaboration. It's safe to\
  \ say Chris made me a better writer, and a better developer. All of that in addition,\
  \ of course, to being someone with who I could discuss John Carter, Opar, and Carson\
  \ of Venus. :)\"</p> \n      <p><b>Jason Tondro (Editor)</b>: \"Professionally,\
  \ working with Chris has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I am, quite simply,\
  \ a much better editor now than I was a year ago when I was hired, and most of that\
  \ is due to Chris's guidance. He's been a wonderful mentor, but also a good friend.\
  \ Chris and I are only a month apart in age, and that meant we had a lot of shared\
  \ experiences. I could always count on him to know my TOS references, and he could\
  \ count on me to know who Tars Tarkas was. I remember, when I interviewed for this\
  \ job, I quoted Francis Bacon. He thought I was sucking up to him, because he was\
  \ working on a Bacon-related project and had been for years. No, we had just both\
  \ read all the same books! I will miss Chris every day. But I count myself incredibly\
  \ fortunate I got to work with him at all, and there is no one in the world more\
  \ qualified for his new position. Congratulations, my friend.\"</p> \n      <p><b>Pierce\
  \ Watters (Director of Sales)</b>: \"Best regards to Ignatius Donnelly. Break a\
  \ leg!\"</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Chris started at Paizo in the last week\
  \ of the first Campaign Setting book, then launched straight into the playtest for\
  \ First Edition. During the 10+ years since then, he has helped us through two playtests\
  \ and the birth of Starfinder, has edited about 150 Adventure Path volumes, and\
  \ has shepherded Pathfinder Tales and Pathfinder Comics—plus working on over a thousand\
  \ other products. (Phew!) During that decade, Chris has been a voice of reason and\
  \ professionalism, working smoothly with everyone in the department no matter how\
  \ stressed out and wild-eyed we've gotten. He mentored many of us when we started\
  \ out here, ensuring we learned good habits and set high standards—but also building\
  \ up our self-confidence. And in addition to his expertise at editing, he is a font\
  \ of surprising knowledge, ranging from Mongolian history and Baconian conspiracies\
  \ to how to determine the gender of a skeleton from its skull.</p> \n     <p>On\
  \ top of all that, Chris has also maintained <a href=\"http://cpcarey.com/site/bibliography/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">a simultaneous career</a> as an author of numerous novels, novellas,\
  \ short stories, and comics, and as an editor of several short story compilations—\
  check out his work!</p> \n     <p>On a more personal level, Chris has been a rock\
  \ for me during my time at Paizo. He has taught me a ton about editing, and about\
  \ when to compromise and when to stick to my guns. He's also funny, kind, and compassionate,\
  \ and has been there for me during family crises and whenever I needed a sympathetic\
  \ ear. I'm a better person for having known him, and I'm going to miss him heaps.</p>\
