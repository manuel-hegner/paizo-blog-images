  \ the ship’s comm unit off with an exasperated sigh. Most miners he had flown with\
  \ over the years were tolerable, even companionable in their own right. But this\
  \ low-rent job buzzing asteroids for starmetal bits had somehow attracted all the\
  \ boisterous lowlifes that gave miners a bad name. Indra ignored the uneasy feeling\
  \ of turning off coms, normally a dangerous proposition even this close to a Star\
  \ Citadel’s protection. Communication was the real lifeline out here, not the sputtering\
  \ patrol ship assigned to escort, with its half-functioning gyrolaser turret and\
  \ a pilot who was barely out of flight school. And certainly not his ship’s mining\
  \ laser, which took a while just to cut through unmoving asteroid rock.</p> \n \

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>But Indra loved the special quiet of a coms-dead ship\
  \ in space, especially when compared to the current alternative, and he leaned back\
  \ in his seat to drink it in for a moment. Best not to linger, though; there were\
  \ plenty of dark, mineral-rich pockets in these rocks that a nest of kaions, dangerous\
  \ magnetic space squids, would love to call home. Indra pulsed his ship’s thrusters\
  \ and careened around the nearest asteroid’s rocky surface, eyes sharp for the telltale\
  \ glint of any of several starmetals.</p> \n     <p>Soon enough, a dull pulsing\
  \ crackle began to issue from the ship’s ore-detection system, increasing in intensity\
  \ as he strafed the skyscraper-sized space rock. “What’d we find, B1? More thasteron\
  \ dregs?” Indra had noticed he’d started talking to himself more and more lately\
  \ on these uneventful jobs, maybe a bit too much. So he’d taken to talking to his\
  \ onboard AI instead, which he’d named after all that was left of its worn serial\
  \ code. Of course, it couldn’t understand anything beyond basic commands, or even\
  \ respond—it was, at best, a glorified metal detector—but it made him feel better\
  \ just the same.</p> \n     <p>“Oh, my—is that…” Indra trailed off as his scanners\
  \ confirmed what he could plainly see, a dust-dulled hunk of pale-green crystal.\
  \ It was a sizable chunk of noqual, and Indra quickly set to work flipping switches\
  \ and toggles to begin extraction. He expertly guided his ship’s mining laser to\
  \ carefully etch a frame around the embedded starmetal. Periodically, Indra turned\
  \ off alarms meant to alert him to nearby magnetic disturbances that might signal\
  \ the presence of a kaion pod—but that were just as likely to be false positives\
  \ from the aging ship’s own engines.</p> \n     <p>A few tense minutes of precise\
  \ cutting later, the ship shuddered and rattled as its extraction arm ratcheted\
  \ out, snaking among the recently cut debris toward its prize. This particular deposit\
  \ was shaped perfectly for the arm’s triple-pronged gripping mechanism, and as the\
  \ noqual wrenched free, dust bloomed from the pocket, the remaining rock looking\
  \ somehow even more barren and forlorn.</p> \n     <p>Just as the hunk of noqual\
  \ ore reached the deposit basket at the rear of his ship, the asteroid in front\
  \ of Indra began to glow a dull red, bathed by pulsing emergency lights. Confused,\
  \ Indra tapped his console—had he accidentally turned them on? Then a cold realization\
  \ struck him in the stomach and he slammed the comms back on.</p> \n     <p>“—PIRATES!\
  \ Turn on your comms, you damned fool!”</p> \n     <p>Indra wrenched the flight\
  \ stick, the sudden motion disorienting him and causing the ship to groan and shake,\
  \ to see their escort fighter dead in space, its emergency lights flashing bright\
  \ red and its slight frame a tangle of shredded hull and transparent aluminum. The\
  \ other miners were already halfway back to the Star Citadel, and two sleek and\
  \ deadly Free Captain ships arced around lazily to face Indra’s virtually defenseless\
  \ vessel, much closer to him than he was to safety.</p> \n     <p>Thinking quickly,\
  \ Indra scanned the pitted surface of the asteroid. There, near a shallow-looking\
  \ cave, were piles of floating scales, shed from at least a pod of kaions—odds were\
  \ at least even that they were still in there.</p> \n     <p>“Well, B1, we don’\
  t have to fly faster than the squids…” A few careful shots from his mining laser\
  \ into the cavern had the desired effect, setting off a flurry of activity as the\
  \ tentacled creatures began to silently spew forth from their resting place. “…\
  just faster than those pirates.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight:\
