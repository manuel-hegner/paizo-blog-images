  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 3, 2012</p> \n   <p>We've been talking about\
  \ it for many months now, but we're finally getting close to the release of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a>. So, the time has\
  \ come to start giving you some previews of this hefty tome of racial options and\
  \ lore.</p> \n   <p>To start, I thought I'd give you an overview of what to expect\
  \ in the book. Inside, you will find four large, meaty chapters, filled with rules\
  \ and information concerning all of the core races and just about every player-friendly\
  \ race you'll find in the <i>Bestiary, Bestiary 2,</i> or <i>Bestiary 3</i>. The\
  \ first chapter covers the core races, giving you ten pages of information about\
  \ the race, including new alternate racial traits, favored class options (for all\
  \ of the classes), archetypes, feats, gear, spells, and magic items. Following this\
  \ up in the second chapter are sixteen races given six full pages each to explore\
  \ new options, including alternate racial traits, a handful of favored class options,\
  \ archetypes, and some additional rules to round out your choices. While not as\
  \ common as the core races, any one of these selected races would make for a fine\
  \ PC or companion (with your GM's approval, of course). Finally, we shift focus\
  \ to fifteen uncommon races. Each one of these gets two pages, presenting race history,\
  \ a few alternate traits, favored class options, an archetype a few additional rules\
  \ to get you going.</p> \n   <p>After giving you a mountain of racial options for\
  \ 38 different races, you'd think we would be just about out of space, but no. The\
  \ final chapter of the book contains a complete system for designing your own races,\
  \ balancing them against the others in the book, or even going above and beyond,\
  \ creating more powerful races that emulate monsters from a <i>Bestiary</i> or your\
  \ own imagination. This system went through a significant playtest a while back,\
  \ and we think that with the final tuning, you're really going to enjoy tinkering\
  \ with this system.</p> \n   <p>But enough of my rambling. Let me give you a brief\
  \ preview of what you can expect in Chapter One of the book. Take a look at this\
  \ art from the stonelord paladin archetype found in the dwarf section. This guy\
  \ slowly transforms into stone as he goes up in level, gaining DR, a host of immunities,\
  \ and the ability to summon a small earth elemental to serve him! Next week, we\
  \ will continue to explore Chapter One, looking at some leafy friends.</p> \n  \
