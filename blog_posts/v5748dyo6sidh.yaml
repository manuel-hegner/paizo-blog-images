  \ The team here at Wayfinder Weekly, your one-stop shop for all the latest Starfinder\
  \ happenings, are thrilled to bring you the latest in our continuing coverage of\
  \ the First Seeker Election! The race to replace Ehu Hadif is neck-and-neck according\
  \ to the latest polls, and your vote matters!</p> \n     <p>Our freelance political\
  \ reporter, Lyta Lantrell, caught up with each of the candidates at a recent mixer\
  \ in the Lorespire Complex cantina. In the interest of editorial fairness, we asked\
  \ all four of them the same questions. We hope this information helps you make your\
  \ choice!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/50d1532b-b933-4d88-85fa-5deda9c6dcc8/PZO7231-LYTALANTRELL_1500.png\"\

  \ the Starfinders the best organization in the Pact Worlds?</strong></p> \n    \
  \  <p><strong>Aurora Everbright</strong>: We’re the best in the business at what\
  \ we do, but most importantly, we ain’t scared of nothing! Starfinders are always\
  \ ready to leap into the fray or explore a new world. Whenever anybody in the galaxy\
  \ needs help, we Starfinders are right there to give folks what they need.</p> \n\
  \      <p><strong>Sarmak</strong>: My people have found that the Starfinders are\
  \ valuable allies to their friends, especially the downtrodden and disadvantaged.\
  \ The organization is willing to assist, but always tries to listen to the wishes\
  \ of those they’re aiding for how best to contribute.</p> \n      <p><strong>Dr.\
  \ Heldin Sevaile</strong>: Why, the boundless capacity to do good! This is the finest\
  \ scientific organization I’ve ever been part of, and its resources are nearly limitless!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><strong>Nykiti Lampadephoros</strong>: A light, shining in the darkness\
  \ on untouched shores. A vault of treasures, kept safe from harm and those who would\
  \ do harm. Also, excellent tea in countless varieties! [Nykiti’s offer to read our\
  \ reporter’s tea leaves was declined for ethical reasons.]</p> \n      <center>\n\
  \       <hr width=\"80%\">\n      </center> \n      <p><strong>How would you change\
  \ the organization as First Seeker?</strong></p> \n      <p><strong>Sarmak: </strong>Goodness,\
  \ you know, I hadn’t really considered that! The effect my presence would have…\
  hmm. Perhaps… [He thinks for a moment.] perhaps we could do more to ensure Starfinders\
  \ can learn a trade during their time with us?</p> \n      <p><strong>Dr. Sevaile</strong>:\
  \ Under my leadership, the Society would take its place among the academies and\
  \ laboratories of the galaxy as a revered institute for learning and experimentation.\
  \ Additionally, the discoveries we make would be used to create low-cost medicinals,\
  \ further elevating our prominence.</p> \n      <p><strong>Nykiti</strong>: The\
  \ Society would become a home for those magic users who feel adrift, supplanted,\
  \ misunderstood. There are many things the Society has discovered—so many loose\
  \ ends! We should not let them dangle. We’ve many promising adventures to return\
  \ to!</p> \n      <p><strong>Aurora</strong>: We could be the biggest name in the\
  \ Pact Worlds! We’ll turn our best agents into brand ambassadors and recruit influencers\
  \ from across the infosphere to join us! Oh, and of course, we’ll use the Starfinder\
  \ Chronicles to tell our story right—no more misinformation about us under my watch!</p>\
  \ \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"80%\">\n      </center> \n      <p><strong>What’\
  s in your adventuring kit?</strong></p> \n      <p><strong>Dr Sevaile</strong>:\
  \ Well, let’s see here…yes, about two weeks of insect protein-based rations—care\
  \ to try? [Our reporter declined this offer for gastronomical reasons.] Suit yourself!\
  \ Also a sample collection kit, never know when you’ll find something interesting\
  \ to take back. Ah! And an emergency beacon. Won’t make that mistake twice!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><strong>Nykiti</strong>: My “kit,” such as it is. Largely, I use my\
  \ divination tools on missions. [She empties her pockets, scattering what appear\
  \ to be chicken bones as well as a digital harrow deck on the counter.] I do try\
  \ to bring several aeon stones and spell ampoules to use on myself or provide to\
  \ allies as needed. I’m always prepared for the future.</p> \n      <p><strong>Aurora</strong>:\
  \ You know, I was just talking with a sponsor about selling Everbright Adventuring\
  \ Kits! I’ve always got a hygiene kit with me—gotta look good for the vidstream!\
  \ And of course, backup batteries for my vidstreaming rig. If I’m racing, I take\
  \ my lucky hood ornament with me as well. It’s gotten me out of more than one scrap!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><strong>Sarmak</strong>: Much of my kit is built from what I needed\
  \ on my homeworld. Radiation protections have always served me well. Along with\
  \ my old engineering kit, I tend to keep scrap metal, wires, screws, that sort of\
  \ thing. You never know when it’ll come in handy!</p> \n      <center>\n       <hr\
  \ width=\"80%\">\n      </center> \n      <p><strong>What’s your favorite vacation\
  \ spot?</strong></p> \n      <p><strong>Nykiti</strong>: I had a marvelous time\
  \ at this lovely resort and spa orbiting a black hole last year. The rejuvenating\
  \ facial scrub! Never in my wildest foretellings could I have imagined the effects.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><strong>Aurora</strong>: I’ve been lucky enough to get courtside seats\
  \ at a few professional brutaris games, and WOW! Seeing that much action up close\
  \ was incredible! I’m gonna try to go to the next tournament if I can.</p> \n  \
  \    <p><strong>Sarmak</strong>: Ah, well, I suppose it’s a bit of a busman’s holiday,\
  \ but I did recently travel to Arshalin to examine the Worldshards up close. The\
  \ weather was dreadful, unfortunately, but I’m eager to return someday!</p> \n \
  \     <p><strong>Dr. Sevaile</strong>: You know, I’m really more of a “staycation”\
  \ fellow myself. I’ve been on plenty of missions around the galaxy, and if I go\
  \ to the jungles of Castrovel or some such I’ll just end up collecting new specimens!\
  \ No, if I need some time off, it’s the couch, some healthy snacks, and a <em>Freedom\
  \ and Fire</em> marathon for me.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
