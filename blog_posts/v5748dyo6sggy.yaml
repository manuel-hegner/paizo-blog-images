  \ itemprop=\"description\">With the month of January a whole new year begins, but\
  \ we're still making our way through the final months of Starfinder Society's first\
  \ season. I'm excited that this month starts a very real countdown of sorts to our\
  \ end-of-season finale interactive special. While the team isn't quite ready to\
  \ start talking about our second interactive (more later, I promise) there are some\
  \ major scenarios coming up this month that start us towards our season's end.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Let me start by saying, that despite its name, <a href=\"/products/btq01wkn?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-130-Survivors-Salvation\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-30: Survivor's Salvation</em></a> is not a scenario\
  \ that continues the story of Salvation's End (though we'll be going back to that\
  \ place in due time). Author, Kiel Howell, presented this scenario to the organized\
  \ play team as an exploration into something that we've got a lot of questions about\
  \ since the events of the Scoured Stars: how Starfinders cope with the stresses\
  \ of their occupation. Called by Zigvigix to investigate the disappearance of a\
  \ fellow Exo-Guardian who spent the better part of a year within the Scoured Stars,\
  \ the PCs get to see some topics addressed that we don't tend to see in our typical\
  \ scenarios. Now, it wouldn't be a real scenario without a threat and a bit of a\
  \ sci-fi twist to things, so for those more interested in pulling out laser guns\
  \ and shooting at threatsâ€¦ well, Kiel's got you covered!</p> \n    <p>Onto our second\
  \ scenario!</p> \n    <p>Continuing to explore the repercussions of the Scoured\
  \ Stars, <a href=\"/products/btq01wko?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-131-Treading-Historys-Folly\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-31: Treading History's Folly</em></a> has the\
  \ PCs retrace the steps of First Seeker Jadnura, returning to the site where he\
  \ uncovered one of the mysterious Tear relics that would lead to the Society into\
  \ the Scoured Stars. Vanessa Hoskins brings us a delightful look into Jadnura's\
  \ past actions, as well as information that should delight those who've been following\
  \ the Scoured Stars story over the course of our first season. There were moments\
  \ when developing this scenario that I had chills from some of the information we\
  \ were finally getting out into player and GM hands. Similarly, this scenario also\
  \ goes on to remind people of a few other mysteries that we intend to showcase over\
  \ the remaining months leading up to our finale interactive.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ spur on our contingent of dedicated Starfinder conspiracy theorists, let me share\
  \ one other lovely new piece of art. I can honestly say it's going to factor in\
  \ quite a bit over the course of our coming scenarios. Whatever could it be?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Alrighty, that's it for January's release! As I write this, I'm going\
  \ through development on February's scenarios and am already excited to talk about\
  \ those. Though next month won't continue the Scoured Stars story as much as this\
  \ month, I'm excited on some of the other storylines we get to follow-up on. Expect\
  \ to hear back from me in a month with an update on the Dataphiles ongoing efforts\
  \ and the appearance of a well-known <a href=\"/deadsuns\">Dead Suns Adventure Path</a>\
  \ character asking the PCs for help with a bit of a diplomatic endeavor.</p> \n\
