  \  <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">In just\
  \ over two weeks, <a href=\"/products/btpy8vdl\"><i>Ultimate Campaign</i></a> should\
  \ hit your local game store or your mailbox. In the build up to the release of this\
  \ new 256-page hardcover expansion to the Pathfinder rules line, we are showing\
  \ off some of the things you will find inside.</span></p> \n     <p>This week, we\
  \ are taking a look at Chapter 3, which is absolutely packed with new systems for\
  \ GMs to use in their game. Each one of these sections is designed around one theme\
  \ and they are easily added to any existing campaign when the story calls for that\
  \ particular theme. For example, if the player's travel to a kingdom where honor\
  \ is valued above all else, <i>Ultimate Campaign</i> includes four pages of rules\
  \ on honor and how it can be incorporated into the game. Are the heroes tasked with\
  \ exploring a great, uncharted wilderness? No problem, there are six pages detailing\
  \ rules for exploration in a wide variety of terrains, covering everything from\
  \ hazards of travel to random map generation!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \   <br> Illustration by Sam Burley\n     </div> \n     <p>All told, this chapter\
  \ contains 15 sections detailing various rules systems you can add to your game,\
  \ including rules for alignment shifting, making contacts, developing relationships,\
  \ and retraining. This last section is sure to be popular at your table, allowing\
  \ characters to spend some time to change almost everything, from feats and skills\
  \ to class features and archetypes. You can even retrain your class levels, given\
  \ enough time and a suitable teacher!</p> \n     <p>One of my favorite sections\
  \ of this chapter includes rules for playing young characters, before they start\
  \ their adventuring career. It includes rules for young members of all of the core\
  \ races, guidelines for available classes, and tips for roleplaying and the types\
  \ of encounters young characters might face. While this is only a short section\
  \ at the end of the chapter, I can think of a number of games that would have greatly\
  \ benefitted starting the story before the PCs became the heroes they are today.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That about wraps up this week. Next week, we are going to take a look\
  \ at the final chapter of the book, dealing with kingdoms and war!</p> \n     <p>Jason\
