  \ <p class=\"date\">Friday, November 4, 2011</p> \n    <p>Just yesterday, the fine\
  \ folks from WizKids stopped by the Paizo offices to drop off the final batch of\
  \ Pathfinder Battles <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> miniatures. I now have, sitting on my desk, actual production-run\
  \ copies of all 41 miniatures in the set, from the lowly Goblin Warrior to the mighty\
  \ Huge Black Dragon. Looking at them all lined up on my desk, I’m very impressed\
  \ with the quality WizKids brought to bear on this set, and I think players are\
  \ going to be absolutely thrilled with them. As much as I like sharing these images\
  \ with you every Friday, there’s just something special about holding these miniatures\
  \ in your hand that can never come through on a photograph.</p> \n    <p>I’ll begin\
  \ revealing images of these final miniatures starting next week. This week’s batch\
  \ is the last of the pre-production samples. Generally speaking, these look identical\
  \ to the final versions except they haven’t yet been attached to the bases. I’ll\
  \ see about showing off the bottoms of the bases next week, too, as they look a\
  \ little different from prepainted plastic miniatures you’ve probably seen from\
  \ other companies, in that you can actually read the name of the monster and other\
  \ helpful information. More on that soon.</p> \n    <p>Today I want to focus on\
  \ some of the common miniatures in the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> set. When I first came into the prepainted miniature\
  \ business, my understanding was that common miniatures often had very few paint\
  \ steps, and were basically created as “cheaply” as possible as a way of subsidizing\
  \ the more complicated miniatures pegged to the more scarce rarities. While there\
  \ is some element of that in the Pathfinder Battles line (very complex minis are\
  \ indeed more likely to be rarer), I was very pleasantly surprised to see the amount\
  \ of quality and detail WizKids put into even the common miniatures in the set.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>When I’ve showed the production samples around the office, it’s often\
  \ been commons like the Orc Warrior or Lizardfolk Champion that folks identify as\
  \ their favorites. With Pathfinder Battles, we let game utility dictate rarity more\
  \ than things like sculpt complexity or paint steps. If you might want a ton of\
  \ a certain creature in your game, we did everything we could to put that creature\
  \ at the common rarity. If you only needed one, we made it a rare, and so on.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Here are preview images of three such common creatures, starting with\
  \ the friendly (or not-so-friendly) fellows who tend to show up every time your\
  \ player characters get into trouble in a town or city: the watch!</p> \n    <p>Here\
  \ we have the lowly Watch Guard, the rank-and-file police or guard who peers through\
  \ the darkness with his lantern and impales criminals with his simple spear. You\
  \ can almost hear him say, “Wot’s all this, then?” as he advances toward your criminal\
  \ player characters, with very little sense that they might have six or seven levels\
  \ on him and weapons that cost more than he will earn in a year of cleaning up the\
  \ city.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/110411-WatchGuard_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/110411-WatchGuard_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Every good gaggle of guards needs a leader, so when we were\
  \ first planning this set, I asked WizKids to add a Watch Captain to the list. The\
  \ guy they came back with looked pretty cool, but I thought he was a bit too regular-looking\
  \ to fully pull off the “captain” rank, so I busted him down. He’s now the Watch\
  \ Officer, nervously looking over his shoulder for a future set that might include\
  \ his direct superior.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/110411-WatchOfficer_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/110411-WatchOfficer_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Or perhaps he’s nervous about an attack from this next common,\
  \ the mighty Orc Brute! WizKids did an awesome job with the set’s two orcs (the\
  \ Orc Warrior, taken directly from the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8auu\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i></a> illustration, is even better than this one). This\
  \ guy is ready to knock your head off with a nasty club capped with a bunch of nails.\
  \ If it came down to the fight between the Orc Brute and both of the Watch figures\
  \ put together, my vote goes to the orc. As Wesley Snipes once famously said: “\
  Always bet on green.”</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/110411-Orc_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/110411-Orc_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>That’s it for this week. With a full set of finished minis to show off,\
  \ next week’s preview will be the cream of the crop. Let me know what you’d like\
  \ to see, and I’ll be sure to add it to the list!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
