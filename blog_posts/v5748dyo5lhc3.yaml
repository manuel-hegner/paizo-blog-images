  \    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings\
  \ and welcome to the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> preview blog.\
  \ I'm Paul Peterson, and I'll be your host as we delve into the depths of this demonic\
  \ set. We've got a lot to cover here, and I'm going to reveal everything about this\
  \ powerhouse set!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"tiny\"><i>(Mike: Everything?\
  \ No, you're actually not going to do that.)</i></p> \n      <p class=\"tiny\">Um,\
  \ okay. Then... everything that you'll let me reveal.</p> \n      <p class=\"tiny\"\
  ><i>(Mike: Okay. But rein it in. I'll be right over here. Watching.)</i></p> \n\
  \     </blockquote> \n     <p>Okay! Hold on to your souls (at least for now), and\
  \ let's dig in!</p> \n     <h2>Mythic</h2> \n     <p>From the beginning, I knew\
  \ that bringing mythic heroes into the game was going to be exciting... and a huge\
  \ challenge. I set some pretty lofty goals for this. First, the characters had to\
  \ feel epic. They had to fight demon lords and travel to the Abyss and feel like\
  \ it was well within their power to do so. Second, it had to be compatible with\
  \ everything else. I wanted you to be able to bring Lem from <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  ><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a> along and have him feel right at home.</p> \n\
  \     <p>So we created the mythic path cards.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-MythicArchmage.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-MythicArchmage_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-MythicGuardian.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-MythicGuardian_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Mythic up yourself.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>At a certain\
  \ point in the story, you get to pick one of these cards and add it to your character.\
  \ You can pick any of them, so if you want Harsk to be a Mythic Guardian, you can\
  \ make that choice (although you must live with the consequences afterwards).</p>\
  \ \n     <p>These cards bring your characters up to a level more fitting of the\
  \ word \"mythic.\" At the start of each scenario, you add mythic charges to your\
  \ card. These charges give you a bonus to EVERY roll of the dice for the skills\
  \ associated with that path. You can also spend them to change 1 or more of your\
  \ dice on a roll to a d20. That's right, a d20! And you can do it as often as you\
  \ have charges to spend!</p> \n     <p>However, the players aren't the only ones\
  \ who get to be mythic. What is the point of being a superhero if you don't have\
  \ supervillains to face? Monsters get to be mythic as well, and defeating mythic\
  \ monsters is one of the ways you can replenish your mythic charges.</p> \n    \
  \ <h2>Demons</h2> \n     <p>As you might expect in an Adventure Path about an invasion\
  \ from the Abyss, the set also has a few demons.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Those don't look nice.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>And when\
  \ I say \"a few,\" I really mean OH MY GOD, LOOK AT ALL OF THEM! They start off\
  \ a little slowly in the base set, just to give you time to adjust and put your\
  \ affairs in order, but by Adventure 6, they're an overwhelming horde of evil, pounding\
  \ at your doors and demanding entry.</p> \n     <p>And where there are demons, there\
  \ are things to help you fight them.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \
  \    <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-BattleAspergillum.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-BattleAspergillum_120.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>These might help.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>In this set, you'll\
  \ find many tools that specifically target your evil foes, including weapons that\
  \ bash them and spells that banish them.</p> \n     <h3>Khorramzadeh</h3> \n   \
  \  <p>Speaking of mythic cards and demons, I'm just going to leave this right here\
  \ for you to think about, right after I tell you that this is a card in the *<em>Base\
  \ Set</em>*.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Don't say we didn't warn you.</i>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Cohorts</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>This adventure path has a strong focus on the NPCs you'll encounter.\
  \ Some of them grow and change as they share adventures with the players. In addition,\
  \ many of the characters we were looking at creating showed a deep connection to\
  \ their companions. We brought all of that together to create a new type of card:\
  \ the cohort.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Donahan.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Donahan_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Alain.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Alain_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Alain2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Alain2_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Cohorts act much like allies, but most of them start\
  \ in your hand instead of your deck. A few cohorts have owners and appear on an\
  \ owner's cards list. For example, Donahan is owned by the cavalier Alain, so at\
  \ the start of each scenario, Alain gets to add Donahan to his starting hand. (Similarly,\
  \ summoner Balazar has his eidolon Padrig; in the <em>Character Add-On Deck</em>,\
  \ hunter Adowyn has her wolf Leryn, and shaman Shardra has her stone spirit Kolo.)</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ElvenEntanglement.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ElvenEntanglement_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ElvenEntanglement2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ElvenEntanglement2_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Cecilla.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Cecilla_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Vinst.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Vinst_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Other cohorts, like Cecilla, are handed out as part\
  \ of a particular scenario. After the players draw their starting hands, they get\
  \ to decide who gets those cohorts. Alternatively, the scenario might create a condition\
  \ under which you would get a cohort, as happens with Vinst. After the scenario,\
  \ these cohorts are returned to the box until they're called for again. Oh, and\
  \ if your cohorts get banished? They're gone <i>forever</i>. So don't let them get\
  \ killed, because if you do, they're not coming back.</p> \n     <h2>Corruption</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>One of my favorite things about this adventure path is the theme of\
  \ corruption and redemption that appears time and time again. It was essential that\
  \ we captured that theme in the card game as well.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-MonkeysPaw.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-MonkeysPaw_120.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-CorrodedHelm_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Redemption.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Redemption_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Redeem me!</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Many boons in this set\
  \ have the Corrupted trait. Corrupted boons have pretty severe drawbacks. However,\
  \ you'll have opportunities to use the redemption card to redeem some of them. Once\
  \ a boon is redeemed, the penalty is gone, and you're free to use the boon in all\
  \ of its uncorrupted glory.</p> \n     <h2>The Abyss</h2> \n     <p>This set represents\
  \ the first time that players really get a chance to spend some quality time on\
  \ a plane other than their own.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-AbyssalRift.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-AbyssalRift_120.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-AbyssalRift2_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Hold the phone. Is that a TRAIT on a location card?</i>\n \
  \    </div> \n     <p>Many of the locations in this set are in the Abyss, and the\
  \ rules on a plane full of demons are not always the same as they are here. All\
  \ of those lovely spells and weapons that give you extra dice when you're fighting\
  \ an outsider don't work when your enemy is no longer considered one.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>I hope you've enjoyed this peek at <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>. In fact, I hope you're very excited (and a\
  \ little afraid). I know that I am! I can't wait to tell you more about each of\
  \ the adventure decks, especially Adventure Deck 3, where we'll be releasing...</p>\
