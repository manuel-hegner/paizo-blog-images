  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">We're\
  \ less than a week from <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>, and the office is exploding\
  \ with activity required to get ready for the Big Show. I'm franticly working on\
  \ the Preview Banquet presentation in another window, we've just sent the on-site\
  \ book to the local printer, and the warehouse team is packing up the products that\
  \ will appear in our on-site Paizo Store. Upstairs, our CEO Lisa Stevens is playing\
  \ the just-released Alpha Build of <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Pathfinder Online</a>, and the editorial team is, as usual, working nose\
  \ to the ground to hit its regular deadlines.</span></p> \n    <p>In short, it's\
  \ chaos as usual here at Paizo, and everyone has Big Things on their minds at the\
  \ moment. But that's no reason to keep us from our regularly scheduled Friday Publisher\
  \ Preview!</p> \n    <p>This week we take a peek at three new reveals from November's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures. <i>The Lost Coast</i> covers a wide variety\
  \ of figures that represent common enemies, specific NPCs, and appropriate player\
  \ characters from the Lost Coast region of Varisia. That region has played home\
  \ to Adventure Paths like <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >Shattered Star</a>, as well as numerous <a href=\"/pathfinder/modules\">Pathfinder\
  \ Modules</a> and <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/scenarios\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play</a> scenarios.</p> \n    <p>But today's miniatures aren't\
  \ from any of that. Rather, they're of the \"fits the region\" variety, and each\
  \ was chosen for a different reason that had nothing to do with Adventure Paths.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140627-IdStalker.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140627-IdStalker_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Up first this week is a little critter we like to call the\
  \ Id Stalker, directly from page 180 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary</i></a>. These hideous Darklands creatures embed themselves in the\
  \ empty brainpans of their victims, using them like puppets to do evil in the world.\
  \ They've also been crying out for a good miniature representation for a long time.\
  \ The Id Stalker is a Small, common creature, so you'll be able to attack your player\
  \ characters with a small horde of them.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140627-EldritchKnight.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140627-EldritchKnight_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Continuing the theme of \"great things come in Small packages\"\
  \ is the Gnome Eldritch Knight, pulled from page 221 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex</i></a>. This little guy exists mostly because I think\
  \ he looks cool, but also because I want to fill the ranks with characters wielding\
  \ interesting weapons—in this case a warhammer. My biggest regret with this guy\
  \ is that the factory couldn't work in his hair-thin cigarette holder, but even\
  \ when the Gnome Eldritch Knight is a bit more health conscious, he still looks\
  \ fantastic in his fine purple suit. The figure is a Small, uncommon figure. He\
  \ was originally a rare, but the relatively simple sculpt saw him switch places\
  \ with a more complicated figure—something that upsets my \"perfect\" proposed rarities\
  \ once or twice every set. He's cool enough that I hope folks end up wanting more\
  \ than one of him.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140627-Troll.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140627-Troll_360.jpeg\"></a>\n  \
  \  </div> \n    <p>Finally, finally, FINALLY we get a standard Pathfinder Troll\
  \ at the correct size with <i>The Lost Coast</i> set. Many of you probably remember\
  \ the severely undersized <a href=\"/products/btpy8qjj\">Troll</a> from our first\
  \ set, <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids/singles/heroesMonstersSingles\"\
  ><i>Heroes &amp; Monsters</i></a>. Many gamers now semi-effectionately refer to\
  \ this little guy as the Troll Whelp because he's so small. In sets since then we've\
  \ managed to produce an appropriately sized <a href=\"/products/btpy91lq\">Sea Troll</a>,\
  \ two appropriately sized <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids/singles/reignOfWinterSingles\"\
  >Ice Trolls</a>, and a deliberately oversized <a href=\"/products/btpy8wsy\">Troll\
  \ Champion</a>, but the regular Troll has been waiting impatiently for a return\
  \ to the spotlight. Our first \"generic\" set in a while gave me the perfect opportunity\
  \ to rectify the Original Sin of Pathfinder Battles, and I'm absolutely thrilled\
  \ with how he turned out. Size-wise, he's between the Sea Troll and the Troll Champion,\
  \ which is right where he should be. I am very, very happy with how this guy turned\
  \ out. The Troll is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <p>Before I leave you today,\
  \ I also wanted to draw attention to the special promotional figure we'll be giving\
  \ FREE to all PaizoCon attendees. Here he is!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140627-BloodbriarGoblin.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140627-BloodbriarGoblin_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is the Bloodbriar Goblin Raider, straight from the\
  \ set of Emerald Spire promotional figures we produced for the Pathfinder Online\
  \ Kickstarter effort of last year. We've just started fulfilling the Emerald Spire\
  \ miniatures sets to backers, and wanted to share this figure in particular with\
  \ our hardcore fans—along with the other cool free swag that has made the PaizoCon\
  \ gift bag a legend among PaizoCon attendees!</p> \n    <p>Speaking of PaizoCon\
  \ and miniatures, I hope all minis-fiend attendees will join me Sunday at 2:00 PM\
  \ for my official PaizoCon Miniatures Trading Afterparty in the hotel bar. I'll\
  \ be bringing lots of Pathfinder Battles doubles along with tons of unpainted metal\
  \ and unwanted plastic figures from other companies, and will be trading them for\
  \ a few hours with other like-minded folks over beers to officially wind down the\
  \ convention. This event has happened every year at PaizoCon, and it's become a\
  \ really fun tradition. I urge all attendees to leave a little extra room in their\
  \ suitcases for unwanted minis. It's a great opportunity to return home with a similar\
  \ space filled with figures you DO want, and I look forward to chatting and trading\
  \ with you in just over a week's time.</p> \n    <p>Finally, I'd hoped to be able\
  \ to share a bit this week about WizKids' plan to make good on the production errors\
  \ that effectively ruined the Feiya, Iconic Witch figure from the recent <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy92s9\"><i>Reign of Winter</i></a> set. The mini was a huge disappointment\
  \ for everyone involved, and while I unfortunately cannot yet reveal any details,\
  \ I am confident that WizKids will go above and beyond to make up for the mistakes\
  \ made on this figure. I'm both surprised and impressed by what they have in mind—\
  it's somewhat elaborate, so they need to make sure everything is in place before\
  \ announcing their plans, but I wanted to make sure that you all know that those\
  \ plans ARE moving forward, and I think you'll be pleased when you learn what they\
  \ are—something I very much hope to be able to reveal next week.</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ then, or at least until PaizoCon, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
