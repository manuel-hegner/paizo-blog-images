  \ <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 7, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">By now you may have heard that we're restarting\
  \ the class decks line in August. We took a break after the <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbi\"\
  ><em>Summoner Class Deck</em></a> to reassess the decks we wanted to make, making\
  \ sure we could come up with fresh new concepts in the wake of our success with\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9k5m\"\
  ><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> We think we got there.</p> \n    <p>We've been playing\
  \ around with some of the older classes lately. We debuted a new Rogue, Cleric,\
  \ Druid, and Magus in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbg?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Mummys-Mask-Base-Set\"\
  ><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbh?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Mummys-Mask-Character-AddOn-Deck\"\
  ><em>Character Add-On Deck</em></a>, giving new life to some older playstyles. We\
  \ decided to keep that trend alive in the next wave of three decks.</p> \n    <h2>Is\
  \ It \"May-gus\" or \"Maag-us\"? Or Maybe \"May-juss\" or...</h2> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/CrimsonThrone/PZO9012-Seltyiel.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/CrimsonThrone/PZO9012-Seltyiel_180.jpeg\"></a>\n    \
  \ <br> \"I make <i>everything</i> look good.\"\n    </div> \n    <p>First up is\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy9\"><em>Magus Class Deck</em></a>, starring our\
  \ emo elf Seltyiel. You know he was saying, \"What does a pasty-skinned heartthrob\
  \ have to do to get in a class deck? Put on a shirt?\" Wait no more, Selty. You'll\
  \ be showing up in August.</p> \n    <p>Magus was the biggest oversight in the first\
  \ 20 class decks. At no time in all those decks did we make a decent Melee/Arcane\
  \ deck. The closest we got was the <a href=\"/products/btpy97i9\"><em>Bard Class\
  \ Deck</em></a>, and that wasn't very close. But now not only do Seltyiel from Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles and Ahmotep from Mummy's Mask have a deck they can call home in\
  \ the Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild, but it probably won't be long before\
  \ you read the words \"Each player unlocks the ability to play Crowe\" in an organized\
  \ play scenario near you.</p> \n    <p>Seltyiel will be accompanied by a couple\
  \ of new Magus associates—though to quash some speculation on the forums, Ahmotep\
  \ will not be making a second appearance here. We like her just fine in Mummy's\
  \ Mask, and we've got some more wrinkles we'd like to try with the Magi.</p> \n\
  \    <p>And that's the <i>only</i> deck in this first wave that features exactly\
  \ one iconic character.</p> \n    <h2>As You Can See from My Example, Persistence\
  \ Has Its Rewards</h2> \n    <p>We're finally getting to do something I've wanted\
  \ to do since we started working on the game. At the early stages of expansion,\
  \ we limited ourselves to decks based around the <a href=\" /paizo/blog/tags/iconics/meetTheIconics\"\
  >iconic characters</a> that Pathfinder fans have come to love.</p> \n    <p>Every\
  \ now and then, though, we'd grab a character from our favorite pieces of Pathfinder\
  \ fiction. First up was James Sutter's Salim from <a href=\"/products/btpy8oda\"\
  ><em>Death's Heretic</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy94r3\"><em>The Redemption\
  \ Engine</em></a>, by way of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9gdq\"><em>Inquisitor Class\
  \ Deck</em></a>. I am a head-over-heels Elaine Cunningham fan, so when we got the\
  \ green light to do non-iconic characters in Mummy's Mask, her druid Channa Ti from\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8k9m\"><em>Dark Tapestry</em></a> was the first in the\
  \ door. We also dropped Howard Andrew Jones's cleric Drelm from <a href=\"/products/btpy92f3\"\
  ><em>Stalking the Beast</em></a> into that set as well.</p> \n    <p>But with the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy97if\"><em>Wizard</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy97id\"\
  ><em>Rogue Class Deck</em></a> already out, it seemed I wasn't going to get to include\
  \ my favorite Pathfinder novel characters unless we came up with something very\
  \ clever. So, we did. For our September deck, we're unveiling a new theme concept:\
  \ the <i><a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/novels\">Pathfinder Tales</a> Deck</i>. It\
  \ stars the only two characters ever to merit the phrase \"the new Fafhrd and Grey\
  \ Mouser\": Dave Gross's Count Varian Jeggare and Radovan Virholt.</p> \n    <div\

  ></a>\n     <br> I'm just here with the boss.\n    </div> \n    <p>Dave and I go\
  \ back almost a quarter century, back when he was the editor of <i>Dragon</i> Magazine\
  \ and I was but a humble freelance writer. (I'm still a freelance writer, of course.\
  \ Just less humble.) He's since distinguished himself as one of the most talented\
  \ writers in the game industry. With these two characters, he's created something\
  \ legendary. It's about time you get to play them.</p> \n    <p>And here's the best\
  \ part: Dave's coming along for the ride. It's his third time dropping in with us:\
  \ He did a brilliant fill-in for me as the story writer for <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season1\"\
  >Season of the Righteous</a>'s <a href=\"/products/btpy9g8v\"><em>Adventure 1-3—\
  Lexicon of Paradox</em></a>, which featured Varian and Radovan as cohort cards.\
  \ Dave also wrote the flavor text for his character Alase in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbi\"\
  ><em>Summoner Class Deck</em></a>. I'm excited that we're finally going to bring\
  \ his great creations to PACG character form. Thanks, Dave!</p> \n    <p>Oh, there's\
  \ a third character—one that's <i>not</i> Dave's—from the <i>Pathfinder Tales</i>\
  \ novels in the deck along with Varian and Radovan. When we began to consider all\
  \ the possibilities from the series, the debate was over when I said only two words\
  \ to the team. More on that in a few months. </p>\n    <h2>Enough with All This\
  \ Hero Nonsense</h2> \n    <p>Finally, here's a quick look at our third class deck\
  \ in this wave. In <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season2\">Season of the Runelords</a>,\
  \ we spent a lot of time with the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain\"\
  ><em>Hollow Mountain</em></a> comics, in which Seltyiel, Oloch, Meligaster, and\
  \ Damiel are a bad-guy team. The writing team on that series (Messrs. Mona, Schneider,\
  \ and Sutter) clearly had a blast writing from the villainous perspective. As we\
  \ designed alongside them, we thought <i>we want that too</i>.</p> \n    <p>So,\
  \ I'm happy to announce that we're taking a break from all this \"goody two-shoes\"\
  \ stuff and donning our best, um... <i>\"baddy no-shoes\" stuff?</i> for October's\
  \ <i>Hell's Vengeance Class Deck</i>. Wait, scratch that: It's the first of <i>two</i>\
  \ sets of those. (Eventually, anyway.) For now, we're focusing on three of the <a\
  \ href=\"/blog/tags/hellsVengeance\">six iconic villains</a> from the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\">Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a>,\
  \ lovingly illustrated by our deity-status artist Wayne Reynolds.</p> \n    <div\
