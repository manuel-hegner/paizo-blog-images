  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I spent\
  \ the past weekend on a trip to Grand Canyon National Park. Driving there, my family\
  \ and I passed a variety of different climate zones. We went from the desert of\
  \ Las Vegas to the scrub of Nevada/Arizona border to the pine forests surrounding\
  \ Flagstaff to the windswept gorge of Grand Canyon. As a side note, the area around\
  \ Flagstaff reminds me of growing up in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. In each place, our\
  \ talk turned to what fantasy creatures would occupy such areas. The walk along\
  \ the canyon rim started with the observation that we forgot Gobby, our Pathfinder\
  \ Goblin, and couldn't take photos. That spawned discussion of goblins living in\
  \ the canyon rim and launching sneak attacks against unsuspecting hikers, followed\
  \ by the observation that trolls would probably like the rim and orcs the deeper\
  \ crevasses.</p> \n    <p>While I knew I was a geek and had lots of non-mainstream\
  \ interests, I had not realized how much roleplaying games had influenced how I\
  \ see the world. It isn't limited to my day-to-day life in the Paizo office, weekly\
  \ games with friends, or weekend convention attendance, but permeates every part\
  \ of our lives. Grocery stores lead to discussions on what may a certain race eat\
  \ and how would they structure mealtimes. Craft stores yield all sorts of ideas,\
  \ from houses for fairies to clothing styles among the different countries of Golarion.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Speaking of Golarion, I've been thinking about the characters submitted\
  \ for the \"OPC Needs a New Character\" contest. The PFS team of John, Linda, and\
  \ Mark, took their meeting last week to review the submissions and help me whittle\
  \ down the entries to the top few. We had to throw a few out because they didn't\
  \ follow the competition guidelines or used non-PFS legal archetypes or gear. Then\
  \ we went through and looked at the builds, evaluating how the build and equipment\
  \ supported the backstory. Alas, we could only choose three to offer for judging,\
  \ but before I reveal those, I want to say thank you to all the participants. I\
  \ appreciate you taking the time to put your thoughts to paper and suggest a character\
  \ for me to play. I also want to recognize those characters that made the semi-finals,\
  \ for all of them were interesting concepts that I would have enjoyed playing.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Three cheers to the entrants:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Adam Yakaboski</li>\

  > \n      <p>Life in Whistledown was never bad, but it never felt quite right. Nothing\
  \ ever was the right size, the charms near home were always just a little off-pitch\
  \ of each other, and I never saw something for me to do. Pa always said it would\
  \ all come in time. \"You'll find your place here\" he said. I practiced my shots,\
  \ helped around on the different farms for coin, and tried to learn what I could.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Pa never told me what he had in that old box in his room. Just said\
  \ it was his grandpappy's. When pa got sick, he told me to take the box and I'd\
  \ have to take care of what's inside. That I'd know what I needed to do. He wasn't\
  \ wrong. After the sickness took him, I opened the box and found a few things—a\
  \ ratty pouch, a carved symbol of Erastil, a funny knife... that sort of stuff.\
  \ That's when I found out, though! Great-grandpappy was a hunter! I'd always heard\
  \ stories, but when I picked up that funny knife, I knew! I could feel it! Granny\
  \ was a priestess, too! All these things were my family's and I felt more sure of\
  \ what to do than ever: I had to help people! Show people what good folk do and\
  \ get 'em safe! Start a family! Get my own farm!</p> \n      <p>Pa's gone now, but\
  \ my kin are with me. We can be good people and they can teach me how. I hear them\
  \ Pathfinders go all over the place and help people. Maybe I can work with them,\
  \ save up, and retire to a farmstead with a pretty girl and raise some kids right.</p>\
