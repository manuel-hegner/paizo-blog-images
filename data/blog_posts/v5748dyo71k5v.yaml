  \ runelords of Thassilon went into hiding on the eve of Earthfall, they each expected\
  \ to emerge not long after to a world ready and ripe for conquering. Yet so great\
  \ was the devastation, and so misplaced was their trust in their underlings, that\
  \ once they had stepped away from the world, they were left to languish for thousands\
  \ of years. The first to rise from this self-imposed exile was Karzoug, Runelord\
  \ of Greed. His return to the world not only thrust the runelord legacy into the\
  \ modern era, but helped trigger the other six runelords’ returns as well.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Through this all, the most powerful runelord of them all, Xanderghul,\
  \ runelord of pride, was ironically and continually caught off-guard. In the end,\
  \ he was murdered before he could awaken, yet to the most powerful of all runelords,\
  \ death was but one more indignity. One that only fueled his thirst for revenge\
  \ against the world that, by all his own accounts, should be his to destroy.</p>\n\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Revenge of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>, your characters\
  \ are already mythic heroes—legendary figures who have accomplished more than most\
  \ do in a lifetime. You’ve each answered a mythic calling and made names for yourselves—\
  enough that you’ve attracted the attention of Queen Sorshen herself. Once one of\
  \ the runelords, and arguably the only runelord who could stand toe-to-toe against\
  \ Runelord Xanderghul, Queen Sorshen has seen her fellow six runelords stick to\
  \ their natures and, time after time, be defeated by this new age’s heroes. Sorshen\
  \ chose differently, in part after spending thousands of years in magical isolation\
  \ with her own personal demons, and now she wants to help build societies rather\
  \ than tear them down. And to do so, she admits she needs help from this era’s heroes—\
  and who better to call upon than Golarion’s newest mythic adventurers?</p>\n   \
  \   <p>Inside the <em>Revenge of the Runelords Player’s Guide</em>, you’ll find\
  \ player-friendly, spoiler-free information and tips to help you make an exciting\
  \ new 12th-level mythic character perfect for the Revenge of the Runelords Adventure\
  \ Path!</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/RevengeoftheRunelord_PlayersGuide.pdf\"\

  \ player’s guide contains:</strong></p>\n      <ul>\n       <li>Character suggestions,\
  \ including recommendations for ancestries, classes, languages, skills, feats, gear,\
  \ and mythic callings and destinies well suited for this Adventure Path.</li>\n\
  \       <li>Six new backgrounds tailor-made to not only set your PC up as a hero\
  \ of the Saga Lands, but to help explain why and how Queen Sorshen chose you to\
  \ ask for help.</li>\n       <li>Four new mythic callings tailor made to match Revenge\
  \ of the Runelords’ themes, as well as brief notes about new mythic destinies designed\
  \ to fit into this Adventure Path’s story.</li>\n       <li>Advice for you and your\
  \ GM on how to run Revenge of the Runelords as a follow-up Adventure Path for a\
  \ previous campaign, be it Seven Dooms for Sandpoint, Myth-Speaker, or something\
  \ else.</li>\n       <li>A “Recap of the Runelords.” The saga of the runelords is\
  \ one that’s played out over multiple Adventure Paths and, indeed, multiple editions\
  \ of the game—this “runelords primer” intends to bring new players up to speed (or\
  \ to remind established players of what’s come before) in as spoiler-free a way\
  \ as possible as to who these runelords are and what they’ve been up to.</li>\n\
  \       <li>Finally, a brief description of the capital city of New Thassilon, known\
  \ now as Xin-Eurythinia (once known not so long ago as Xin-Shalast), presents you\
  \ with a brief gazetteer of the remote metropolis where this campaign begins, but\
  \ details six unusual downtime activities your PCs can engage in as the campaign\
  \ begins—or with your GM’s approval—even before!</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3 style=\"\
