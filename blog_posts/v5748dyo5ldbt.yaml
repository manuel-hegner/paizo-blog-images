  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>One of the defining characteristics of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign that separates it from other organized\
  \ play programs is the faction system. A few weeks ago, Paizo Publisher Erik Mona,\
  \ Campaign Coordinator Mike Brock, and I spent an obscene amount of time in a few\
  \ very long meetings really digging into factions to determine what worked with\
  \ their current implementation, what was lacking, and how we could improve them,\
  \ and in doing so improve the quality of the Pathfinder Society campaign as a whole.\
  \ We came up with a lot of great ideas, and Mike and I have hinted at them in recent\
  \ weeks on the messageboards. Well, today I'm going to pull back the curtain a little\
  \ bit and reveal a few of the changes we have in store in a bit more detail.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>First, starting in Season 4, all 10 factions will have a specific goal\
  \ they hope to achieve over the course of the year. In general, we'll be moving\
  \ away from the original metaplot of the factions vying for control of Absalom,\
  \ as the campaign has expanded to incorporate the entire Inner Sea region to a much\
  \ larger extent than was anticipated in Season 0. These goals will be clear and\
  \ will be disseminated to all members of a given faction by the faction heads at\
  \ the start of the season. Make sure all your Pathfinder Society characters are\
  \ registered on paizo.com and that your email address and privacy settings are updated\
  \ before August so you'll be sure to get any missives your faction leader may send.\
  \ All Pathfinder Society scenario designers will receive an overview of the factions'\
  \ plans in order to incorporate opportunities to achieve these goals into their\
  \ respective scenarios. </p> \n   <div style=\"float: right; padding: 1em;\">\n\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PathfinderSociety-Cheliax_90.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Note that I said opportunities and not missions?\
  \ Faction missions aren't going away, and you'll still get faction missives from\
  \ your faction head at the start of a scenario. But except in specific cases where\
  \ necessitated by the circumstances, faction missions won't just be a specific skill\
  \ check you need to make or else fail the faction mission. They'll be more general,\
  \ and tied to the overall faction goal for the season. While we'll make sure there's\
  \ an opportunity presented in each scenario for members of each faction to put forward\
  \ their factions' goals (and any specific tasks suggested in the scenario's faction\
  \ handouts), we'll also be allowing for more player creativity.</p> \n   <p>For\
  \ example, Andoran's goal for a season (and this isn't their goal next season) might\
  \ be to bring slavers to justice. In a particular scenario, the PCs may encounter\
  \ a merchant in Osirion whom they can discover has ties to slavers. Andoran faction\
  \ PCs who discover this can then deal with the guy as they see fit, or if they miss\
  \ this clue, they can use their time in the markets in a later encounter to put\
  \ together a list of slavers operating out in the open in the markets of Sothis.\
  \ In both cases, the PCs are helping their faction toward the overall season goal,\
  \ and while we will present an opportunity to do so without the need to go off the\
  \ rails, PCs will be rewarded for taking the initiative and going beyond these suggestions.</p>\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PathfinderSociety-SilverCrusade_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Another hot topic of discussion has been\
  \ the so-called \"faction war,\" in which each faction competes with the rest to\
  \ be the winner of a given season. We're revising this faction-versus-faction paradigm,\
  \ instead measuring each faction's success against its own goals to achieve varying\
  \ degrees of success. Thus, a faction whose members get all their possible prestige\
  \ in a given season achieve 100% success, and the results of their actions will\
  \ play out in the ongoing, unfolding plot of the campaign. Similarly, a faction\
  \ that struggles a bit and only gets 80% of its potential prestige might not achieve\
  \ its ultimate goal but will certainly see the results of its many successes. Finally,\
  \ a faction that only reaches the lowest threshold of success might see in-world\
  \ consequences of its failures, which may determine the faction's goals the following\
  \ season (perhaps calling into question the faction's very existence).</p> \n  \
  \ <p>We've got some pretty deep and (we think) fun plots developing for all 10 factions,\
  \ and the authors of our four Gen Con scenarios are already working to incorporate\
  \ those threads into their adventures. Stay tuned this summer for more information\
  \ from your faction heads about what your PCs are going to be working toward in\
  \ the next year.</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n   <p><i>Illustrations\
