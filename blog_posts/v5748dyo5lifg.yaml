  \ <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 3, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p>Hiya! We skipped the ACG blog last week, so we've got a lot of stuff\
  \ to share! Here are three big pieces of big news:</p> \n    <h2>The Runelords Rise\
  \ Again</h2> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We have been working hard on the\
  \ soon-to-launch Season of the Runelords (we're previewing it this weekend at <a\
  \ href=\"http://wintfan.baldmangames.com\" target=\"_blank\">Winter Fantasy</a>\
  \ in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and it's not too late to get in on that!) and we're trying\
  \ something a little different this time.</p> \n    <p>The Season of the Runelords\
  \ storyline begins after the conclusion of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  ><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a>. In that Adventure Path, the heroes defeat a\
  \ Big Bad Guy (is it possible to spoil a story we published in 2007?). We're picking\
  \ up the story of the world after that defeat, with your fresh party of adventurers\
  \ operating near the familiar town of Sandpoint.</p> \n    <p>We're big comics fans,\
  \ and we love the fact that several of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/\"\
  >Dynamite's Pathfinder Comics</a> storylines take place in and around Sandpoint.\
  \ Season of the Runelords <em>Adventure 1: Dark Waters Rising</em> and <em>Adventure\
  \ 2: City of Secrets</em> looks to some of those comics to provide their story backbone\
  \ and scenario art. Adventurers will experience the depravity of the Mosswood goblin\
  \ tribe and the intrigues of the city of Magnimar, as filtered through the collective\
  \ imagination of the Pathfinder Adventure Card game team. I'm not sure whether that\
  \ should frighten or excite you.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy921r\"><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/DYN/DYNHCV1A_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"/products/btpy98lg\"><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/DYN/DYNHCV2A_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a> <a href=\"/products/btpy9iye\"><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/DYN/DYN-SEP158424_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Adventure 1, which will debut at Winter Fantasy, is\
  \ based on the first 12 issues of the comics, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/darkWatersRising\"\
  ><em>Dark Waters Rising</em></a> and <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/ofToothAndClaw\"\
  ><em>Of Tooth and Claw</em></a>. It all starts on the road to Sandpoint, where mutated\
  \ goblins attack the hapless party. When they arrive in town, there's talk of a\
  \ flying beast that eats the local livestock. And the town council is in turmoil.\
  \ How all these things weave together into an intricate 6-scenario plot is for you\
  \ to discover.</p> \n    <p>Adventure 2 is based on <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/cityOfSecrets\"\
  ><em>City of Secrets</em></a> and <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/origins\"\
  ><em>Origins</em></a>. This arc brings us to Magnimar, where the clerics of Sarenrae\
  \ and nobles of the city are being targeted by mysterious forces. When you find\
  \ yourself embroiled in the gang turf wars of Underbridge, you'll wonder if the\
  \ big city is big enough even for you.</p> \n    <p>In adventure 3, we'll head off\
  \ to Hollow Mountain, about which we can share little at the momentâ€”the <a href=\"\
  /store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain\"><em>Hollow\
  \ Mountain</em></a> comic book arc is ongoing. The first 2 issues are out, and the\
  \ next two issues can be preordered. Get them if you want a preview of the excitement\
  \ to come!</p> \n    <h2>Did We Mention Goblins?</h2> \n    <p>Speaking of gobbos,\
  \ we announced that our Class Deck subscription has been hijacked by goblins! The\
  \ first Goblin Class Deck (yeah, <i>we</i> know \"goblin\" isn't a class, but <i>they</i>\
  \ don't seem to care) is entitled <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a>,\
  \ features the rotters Reta Bigbad, Chuffy Lickwound, and Ak the Survivor, whom\
  \ you might have met in the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/goblins\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Goblins!</em> comics</a>. They're nasty and fun, and also nasty.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"><img src=\"\
  /image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6817_360.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>So where's\
  \ Mogmurch and Poog of Zarongel? They're in the next Class Deck after that, entitled\
  \ <em>Goblins Burn!</em>, naturally. It's a lot more spell-focused than <em>Goblins\
  \ Fight!</em> is. We'll have that up on the site for preorder next month.</p> \n\
  \    <p>And who's in <em>Goblins Burn!</em> with Mogmurch and Poog? Well, that's\
  \ a secret we'll keep to ourselves for a few weeks yet. But trust us, it'll be worth\
  \ the wait.</p> \n    <h2>But If You Just Can't Wait, We've Got You Covered</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Maybe you don't want to wait for us to give you more goblin characters.\
  \ Maybe you want to make them yourselves. So here's some big news: DriveThruCards\
  \ has expanded their online <a href=\"http://drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Card Creator</a> so you can now\
  \ make your own character, role, and token cards!</p> \n    <p>This means that all\
  \ major card types can now be made with the community card creator. Check out the\
  \ Card Creator to make your own cards and see what other members of the PACG community\
  \ have cooked up.</p> \n    <p>That's a lot for one blog! So check out Season of\
  \ the Runelords, the Card Creator, and (when it warms up a bit) the Goblin Class\
  \ Decks. Have fun storming the Goblin Fortress!</p> \n    <p>Tanis O'Connor and\
