  \ Card Game blog, game designer Mike Selinker and developer Gaby Weidling stake\
  \ out positions on whether it's better to be brash or cautious in the game. We join\
  \ them in mid-session.</i></p></span> \n    <p><b>Gaby</b>: My turn! Smashy smashy!</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Mike</b>: Hold on there, buckaroo. I know you want to break everything\
  \ in sight, Valeros. Let me tell you why that's not always a good idea.</p> \n \
  \   <p><b>Gaby</b>: No, let me. Less thinking, more doing. You get to jump right\
  \ into the action, and you don't spend all your time talking like you do in an RPG.\
  \ Instead, you just wade right in because you're <i>Valeros</i>, and you smash whatever\
  \ you find. You've loaded up on cards that make you nearly invincible, so why waste\
  \ your time acting like you're… um, vincible?</p> \n    <p><b>Mike</b>: And then\
  \ you run into an Explosive Runes and your hand is in the discard pile.</p> \n \
  \   <p><b>Gaby</b>: There's like two Explosive Runes in the whole game! And so I\
  \ lose four cards? Baw-baw-baw. I'm Valeros. And I've got some wimpy-ass healer\
  \ who can put those cards back in my deck whenever I want.</p> \n    <p><b>Mike</b>:\
  \ No, whenever <i>she</i> wants. Saving your bacon is going to cost Kyra a turn.\
  \ She has to burn an exploration to heal you.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p><b>Gaby</b>: I'm the only thing standing\
  \ between her and disaster. \"There's a big scary thing over at the Old Mill, and\
  \ oh no, I looked ahead and there's another one in the Woods!\" Who's gonna go beat\
  \ that up? They're not calling Ghostbusters. It's always Valeros.</p> \n    <p><b>Mike</b>:\
  \ Kyra can bristle up with monster-killing cards just like Valeros can. She's just\
  \ smarter if she doesn't. OK, let me ask you another thing. What happens when you\
  \ blast through the door and find a Wand of Shield? It's just gonna go in the garbage,\
  \ because you're not smart enough to acquire it.</p> \n    <p><b>Gaby</b>: I don't\
  \ need no sticks!</p> \n    <p><b>Mike</b>: I think I win that argument. You're\
  \ on the side of the party, right? You want Kyra's turns to be effective, and you\
  \ just made her worse by not knowing there was something she wanted. </p> \n   \
  \ <p><b>Gaby</b>: I'm on the side of the party if the party is on the side of <i>winning</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Mike</b>: Sigh. Let me see if I can explain a simple concept called\
  \ opportunity cost to you. Let's say you take one of those item slots and put a\
  \ Spyglass in there. Spyglass says, \"Discard this card to examine the top 2 cards\
  \ of your location deck and put them back in any order.\" Then, when you find the\
  \ monster and the wand, you can crush the monster and leave the wand for the spellcaster.</p>\

  0\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p><b>Gaby</b>: Let me explain opportunity cost to <i>you</i>.\
  \ You're wasting a slot that could be used for an active item and replacing it with\
  \ a passive item. What good's knowing what's there if you can't beat it when you\
  \ find it?</p> \n    <p><b>Mike</b>: It doesn't always have to be passive. Consider\
  \ Ilsoari Gandethus, who—</p> \n    <p><b>Gaby</b>: Yes, let's!</p> \n    <p><b>Mike</b>:\
  \ —is an ally with the text, \"During your turn, reveal this card and put it on\
  \ top of your deck to examine the top card of your location deck; if it's a monster,\
  \ you may shuffle that monster back into the location deck.\" Even you'd admit there\
  \ are monsters you'd prefer to shuffle back into the deck when you find them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Gaby</b>: Read the rest of the card.</p> \n    <p><b>Mike</b>: I'm\
  \ not sure that's—</p> \n    <p><b>Gaby</b>: \"After you play this card, roll 1d12;\
  \ on a 1, summon and encounter the villain The Sandpoint Devil.\" Remember the time\
  \ Paul Peterson was so careful about what he was doing that he summoned The Sandpoint\
  \ Devil <i>three times</i>. Valeros is all about fighting the monsters that are\
  \ there, but not about <i>making extra ones</i>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Barely. But okay, I admit you have a point.</p> \n    <p><b>Gaby</b>: Yeah, you\
  \ also have a point. Sometimes you need to know where the villain or a henchman\
  \ is, and flailing about blindly isn't always the best way. It's not always about\
  \ the smashing. It's often about knowing <i>when</i> to smash.</p> \n    <p><b>Mike</b>:\
  \ And who needs to be smashed. So we can agree we're both right.</p> \n    <p><b>Gaby</b>:\
  \ Finally. Can I take my turn now?</p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags:\
