  articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The Paizo Editorial Pit can be\
  \ a busy place sometimes. And by sometimes, I mean <i>all</i> the time. So much\
  \ so that it's easy to get so focused on polishing and printing books that you look\
  \ up one day and realize you don't get to geek out publicly about them anymore!\
  \ Such was the case for me, when I realized I hadn't written any sort of behind-the-scenes\
  \ blog in months. So I petitioned Paizo's illustrious Blog Queens and asked them\
  \ to give me a digital soap box every two months, from which I can try to pull back\
  \ the curtain a little on the Pathfinder Tales novels. After all, there are a million\
  \ authors out there, and a literally infinite number of ideas. So what makes me\
  \ choose a particular book to invest in and see all the way through the Paizo process,\
  \ from concept to final printing?</p> \n     <p>Fortunately for me, this first one\
  \ is easy. You want to know why I decided to publish <a href=\"/products/btpy9e42\"\
  ><em>Beyond the Pool of Stars</em></a>? Take a look at the illustration accompanying\
  \ this blog.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8529-Mirian.jpg\"\

  \  <br><i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>That's Mirian\
  \ Raas. She's a deepwater salvager out of Sargava, and as soon as Howard sketched\
  \ her out for me, I knew we had a winner.</p> \n     <p>See, Mirian is a classic\
  \ swashbuckling, two-fisted pulp hero, an explorer and Pathfinder who's part Indiana\
  \ Jones and part Han Solo. She's also a woman of color—half native Mwangi, half\
  \ colonial Chelaxian. That combination appealed to me deeply. Not just because we\
  \ need more representation of rad women and heroes of color in the genre (though\
  \ we absolutely do—one of the reasons I'm happy to see people connecting with characters\
  \ like Seelah, or Alahazra, or Jiri from <em>Firesoul</em>). But because Sargava\
  \ isn't just some adventure site full of monsters and ruins (even if some Avistani\
  \ may see it that way). It's a society that's defined by racial tension, and Mirian\
  \ and her brother occupy a unique place within it, neither truly a ruling colonial\
  \ nor one of the native Mwangi people. That sort of conflict—both internal and external—\
  makes for interesting characters, and provides a unique perspective from which to\
  \ view that society. One of the best things fantasy can do is hold a mirror up to\
  \ social issues in our own world, in a way that draws us in and lets us see ourselves\
  \ more clearly. (And it's not just about skin color, either—that central idea of\
  \ clashing societies and building bridges across cultural divides only multiplies\
  \ when Mirian and her crew team up with a tribe of lizardfolk.)</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ while I love it when fantasy addresses important social issues or interesting\
  \ philosophical concepts, that's not enough to make a book for me on its own. (I\
  \ can read blogs for that!) Pathfinder is a game about <i>adventure</i>, and so\
  \ too do the novels need action to draw us in. Fortunately, that's something Howard\
  \ Andrew Jones knows well, being a scholar of adventure fiction both old and new.\
  \ After outlining Mirian to me, he promptly hooked me on the book's plot with the\
  \ idea of an underwater lizardfolk city hidden in a cenote—one of those beautiful\
  \ sinkholes filled with water. The idea of doing a deepwater dive <i>in the middle\
  \ of the jungle</i> was so novel that I signed off on it immediately, and Mirian\
  \ and her crew were forced to step off the rolling deck of the <i>Daughter of the\
  \ Mists</i> and into the sweltering, unpredictable jungle.</p> \n     <p>As an interesting\
  \ bit of trivia: this isn't a new story for Howard. When he originally sent me a\
  \ writing sample, many years ago now, it also featured a deep water salvager—one\
  \ who shared an eerie number of similarities with Mirian Raas. At the time, doing\
  \ anything underwater seemed too unusual—how often do you actually run campaigns\
  \ underwater?—and I was eager to have him write a more iconic \"adventuring party\"\
  \ novel, which resulted in Elyana the elven ranger and her band of heroes. Yet that\
  \ image of the bold salvagers stuck with both of us, and it's been really fun to\
  \ see the characters come back around again. Some ideas just don't take no for an\
  \ answer!</p> \n     <p>You can check out the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li2e\"\
