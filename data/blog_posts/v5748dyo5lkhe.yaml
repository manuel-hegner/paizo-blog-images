  \ Everybody Knows Your Name</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 16, 2018</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\

  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Come on in, come on in! You look thirsty. Pull\
  \ up a stool and let me pour you a drink. What's your poison? Whiskey? Wine? No\
  \ matter, we have it all here!&nbsp;<i>*polishes glass with a dirty rag*</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>What's that? You say you read about our humble establishment in some\
  \ kind of guidebook? Mind if I take a look? <a href=\"/products/btpy9u0a?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Taverns\"\
  ><em>Inner Sea Taverns</em></a>, hmm? Interesting...</p> \n     <p>Cayden's tankard,\
  \ this book is something else! Not only does it have information about a tavern's\
  \ menu and owner, there's also a map for some of these bars! And it even tells you\
  \ about a tavern's customers! I wouldn't want my patrons to find out about this,\
  \ that's for sure.</p> \n     <p>I can't say as I've been all around the Inner Sea,\
  \ but I did my fair share of traveling before I bought this place. Let's see if\
  \ I've heard of any of these places.</p> \n     <p>Ha! Here! The Whispering Stone\
  \ in Osirion. They say if you kiss the lips of the stone statue that stands in the\
  \ middle of its open-air pavilion, you'll have luck in love. Don't you believe it!\
  \ After a few mugs of their pink hibiscus punch, I pulled a chair over to that hunk\
  \ of rock and planted one right on its mouth. The next thing I remember is waking\
  \ up in a nearby stable with my face in some camel's fur! True, I later bought that\
  \ camel and she got me alive out of a number of scrapes in the Parched Dunes, but\
  \ I wouldn't call that true love!</p> \n     <p>Oh, and here's the Porthmos Club\
  \ over in Taldor! Full of snooty nobles who wouldn't give the likes of you or me\
  \ a second glance if they saw us on the street. But they still need a place to drink\
  \ and gamble, don't they? Ha! I was actually a senator's aide for a day in Oppara—\
  that's a story for another time—and had to purchase a brand-new doublet just so\
  \ they would let me in. And with my own coin no less! Truth be told, that was the\
  \ finest bar I've ever been thrown out of.</p> \n     <p>I can't believe it, this\
  \ book even has the rules for a handful of pub games! Why, I haven't played bootbeer\
  \ in ages. I think I have an old dented helmet in the back from my days in the Molthune\
  \ militia if you want to go a few rounds. Beer's on the house! No? Suit yourself,\
  \ then.</p> \n     <p>Well, friend, I have to tell you that this book is amazing.\
  \ I wonder who took the time to put this together. No matter. Say, before you leave,\
  \ keep an eye out for this pale half-elf that's been skulking around town. He's\
  \ nothing but trouble. There's a sketch of him on the notice board, but you really\
  \ can't miss him—I don't think he's ever covered up his chest in his life!</p> \n\
  \     <p>Cheers!</p> \n     <p>Jason Keeley<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n    </div>\
