  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">We've got four more figures to preview for November's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of prepainted plastic\
  \ gaming miniatures, but just to be mischievous, I'm going to split them into two\
  \ previews of two figures each. To draw things out a bit longer, next week I'll\
  \ be on-site at New York Comic Con, and there will not be a Friday Publisher Preview\
  \ (though I do hope to keep up my new <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/pathfinderWorldscape\"\
  >Worldscape Workbook</a> blog column while I'm on the road. If you haven't yet checked\
  \ out my new column, which gets into the nitty gritty of my design decisions when\
  \ putting together official Pathfinder RPG stats for legendary heroes like Red Sonja\
  \ and John Carter, I urge you to do so at the above link. I've had a ball writing\
  \ the blog series, as well as writing the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> comic itself, which hits newsstands Wednesday, October\
  \ 19th. If you enjoy my writing here on the Paizo blog or enjoy the Pathfinder comics\
  \ in general, please consider setting up a <a href=\"/products/btpy8tvw\">Pathfinder\
  \ Comics Ongoing Subscription</a>.</p> \n    <p>But enough about comics! This space\
  \ is for miniatures, and this week I've got two fantastic figures to show you from\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160930-AngelkinPaladin.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160930-AngelkinPaladin_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Ardent watchers of this space have been predicting this\
  \ Angelkin Paladin from the first day we revealed the set's packaging, and here\
  \ he is in all his celestial glory! Based off of a character who shows up semi-frequently\
  \ in our interior illustrations, as well as on covers like <a href=\"/products/btpy8sa7\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Angels</em></a>. The clear plastic effects\
  \ on his flaming sword and glowing halo make quite the impression upon evil foes,\
  \ or even goodly folks who happen to be in his way. The Angelkin Paladin is a Medium,\
  \ rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160930-Shensen.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160930-Shensen_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week is another Medium, rare figure, and what\
  \ a rare figure it is indeed. Here we have Paizo Creative Director James Jacobs's\
  \ personal character, Shensen! James has played many different versions of this\
  \ swashbuckling bard over his RPG career, but two of them are my favorites. First,\
  \ of course, is the version that appeared in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\"\
  >Hell's Rebels Adventure Path</a>. That appearance, in the blockbuster <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9grm\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #100</em></a>, came with a nice\
  \ Wayne Reynolds painting of Shensen that now hangs in James's office (which, incidentally,\
  \ is right next to mineâ€”I can hear him through the wall as I type this). But an\
  \ even better version of Shensen, or at least one that's more meaningful to me personally,\
  \ is the version James played in my old Kings of Absalom office campaign, where\
  \ she was one of many stars of the show. Shensen as presented in <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> makes a fantastic player character or NPC, whether good\
  \ or evil. Shensen, is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week.\
  \ I'm off to New York Comic Con! See you in two weeks!</p> \n    <p>Until then,\
  \ I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
