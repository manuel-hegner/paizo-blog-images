  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s 30 minutes\
  \ until midnight and the river’s delta is gleaming with bits of gold dust coming\
  \ off the tips of the fires scattered about. Dragon-tailed lanterns illuminate the\
  \ paths as multi-generational families recount raucous stories.</p>\n      <p>Overheard,\
  \ a gravelly voice mixed with sincerity comes from an elderly kobold: “Do you remember\
  \ that time when...”</p>\n      <p>Cut off, an innocent yet bright voice coming\
  \ from a toddler yells, “We’ve already gone over this, ông nội! I wasn’t even born\
  \ yet! You and grandma met <em>ages</em> ago...!”</p>\n      <p>A family of seven\
  \ bursts out into loud laughter as they filter into the streets, seamlessly mixing\
  \ in with the noises of carts carrying crafts and garments, silks and spices; from\
  \ afar, melodies of wood, wind, and percussion firmly grace the air.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>It’s the second day of the Festival of the Loss: Xa Hoi’s yearly celebration\
  \ of the lives of the recently deceased, but also the ancestors that have been watching\
  \ over the collective for centuries.</p>\n      <p>Bordering each side of the river,\
  \ home cooks, restaurant chefs, and food stall owners squat, cooking fragrant foods\
  \ on portable stoves and fires. Closer to the water are tables draped with lucky\
  \ red fabric, used year after year, dishes placed carefully. The food is surrounded\
  \ by burning incense that wafts up to the heavens:</p>\n      <p>· Pillowy, perfectly\
  \ cooked rice next to crisped, barbecued game glazed with a translucent, sweet red\
  \ sauce that reflects all the lanterns and lights.</p>\n      <p>· Bowls of fragrant\
  \ broth, simmered for a full day prior to pull the flavor from livestock bones and\
  \ aromatics into the perfect infusion, filled with tender noodles and garnished\
  \ with fresh herbs.</p>\n      <p>· Beautiful golden pancakes still sizzling on\
  \ the griddle, loaded with glowing leaves and minced meat, folded into half-moon\
  \ parcels.</p>\n      <p>· Rice paper rolls stuffed to the brim with fresh vegetables,\
  \ herbs, noodles, and steamed prawns caught and delivered just the morning prior,\
  \ served next to a sweet, crunchy peanut sauce.</p>\n      <p>· A three-layered\
  \ bean and jelly parfait drizzled with a viscous cream, multicolored glutinous rice\
  \ dumplings in a ginger syrup, and big, round fried pastries covered with seeds,\
  \ filled with a mixture of locally harvested sweet beans.</p>\n      <p>Yet, no\
  \ one has approached the tablescape. Though outsiders might be curious why this\
  \ mile-long spread adorning the riverside isn’t being touched, for the people of\
  \ Xa Hoi, it’s because it’s tradition. You see, the dead always eat first.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Legends have been told of ancestors who moved to the afterlife and existed\
  \ miserably because they were forgotten. Instead of joining those who've moved on\
  \ peacefully to look over their family’s health and luck, these now-lost souls are\
  \ cursed for eternity. Wondering why their families have forgotten them they manifest\
  \ as bad luck, nightmares, or even come to our mortal plane themselves, seeking\
  \ attention and respect.</p>\n      <p>This is why the dead always eat first. The\
  \ meals are put out under the full moon of the Festival of the Loss to invite those\
  \ who protect Xa Hoi to join in celebration, feast, and remembrance.</p>\n     \

  \ Lastra</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>As the hour and minute hand of\
  \ clocks join at midnight, there’s one more moment of silence. A single, unified\
  \ prayer. One big breath inhaled together with hands pressed close to the hearts—\
  families are sending final well-wishes to their loved ones. Then, as if on cue,\
  \ the chaotic symphony of music and laughter and joyous conversation rises back\
  \ to fill the streets along the river as families take turns making their plates\
  \ and enjoying the delicious, jubilant dinner.</p>\n      <p>As some folks go back\
  \ for seconds, many start making their way toward the center of the city of Ngon\
  \ Hoa, where the rivers meet. Shining brighter than the lanterns that line the river,\
  \ a stage next to the water is covered with vibrant tapestries lined with golden\
  \ trim. Embroidered into the curtains are stitched portraits of dragons and warriors\
  \ and empresses and flowers, seamlessly flowing into each other like scenes from\
  \ a play, draping across the fabric.</p>\n      <p>Though performers have been rotating\
  \ throughout the night, in and out of the larger festival grounds, with lighter\
  \ crowds watching and cheering them on, now, people start to enter en masse, staking\
  \ their place on the damp, grassy ground with blankets and stools to see the annual\
  \ water puppetry show, Múa rối nước. On stage, the orchestra sets up gongs, wooden\
  \ flutes, drums, chimes, and string instruments rarely seen outside of Xa Hoi. At\
  \ the stage’s edge, closest to the water, lie ornate hand-carved wooden puppets,\
  \ ranging from humans to dragons, merfolk, and nagaji, mirroring the crowd that\
  \ has gathered around.</p>\n      <p>The spotlights bolt up and down, right to left,\
  \ finally converging to shine over the river, and the water seems to slow down.\
  \ The Sorcerer Storytellers rise enchantingly from below the surface and begin the\
  \ show to roaring applause. They recount stories over the water to tell of this\
  \ year’s troubles and successes, their magic manipulating not only the puppets from\
  \ the stage, but shaping the water itself with swipes of their hands like a timeless\
  \ dance that’s both familiar and not from this world. Their silken garments, meticulously\
  \ crafted by masterful seamstresses, almost seem to enhance their dragon-blooded\
  \ magic, each embroidered stitch exuding small glimmers of light as they perform.\
  \ Dramatic scenes reenact wars with swelling, cacophonous music and powerful imagery,\
  \ these darker moments interwoven with flashes of occasional victorious triumphs\
  \ while plumes of water fly high to the sky in unison with the music.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>As the show ends with a magnificent finale, swirls of iridescent water whipping\
  \ around in a display of elegant magic, the festivities start to wane. At a glance\
  \ across the river, the ornate and lavish outfits start to dwindle as workers change\
  \ into their ordinary uniforms. The next day's tasks still must be done. The incense\
  \ has burned down to the bottom, leaving small piles of gray ash at the base of\
  \ ceramic bowls. Performers start packing up their instruments and tear down their\
  \ festival stages. Carts that once held celebratory candies and toys are stowed\
  \ away for household wares and common fabrics—the tables’ lucky red clothes are\
  \ folded up and stored for next year’s celebration, too. Farmers head back toward\
  \ their plots to tend to the crops and livestock. Store owners start opening shops\
  \ for the last few hours before the sun starts to rise once more in Xa Hoi.</p>\n\
