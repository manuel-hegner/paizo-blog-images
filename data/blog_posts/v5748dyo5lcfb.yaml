  \ older Suzeressa took to the practical household arts and younger Milliceene pursued\
  \ a love of natural sciences, middle-born Lirianne lost herself for hours at a time\
  \ in tales of shining knights, devious fairies, and mighty dragons—all subjects\
  \ absent from her homeland of Alkenstar. Raised among bricks, smoke, and bureaucracy,\
  \ the young half-elf dreamed of the life of adventure and fantasy promised by the\
  \ collection of fairy tales left by her absent mother and her own ever-growing library\
  \ of penny dreadfuls. Naturally, she aspired to follow in her father's footsteps\
  \ and become a shieldmarshal, protecting Alkenstar from the hostile giants and hideous\
  \ mutations of the Mana Wastes. Preferring to keep his little girl safe at home,\
  \ Dahmok calmly explained she could never become a shieldmarshal, running with the\
  \ first excuse he could come up with—that her beloved long hair would become entangled\
  \ in firearm mechanisms. To his surprise, he awoke the next morning to discover\
  \ Lirianne grinning like a fool, with her long tresses roughly chopped, eagerly\
  \ packed and ready to follow him to work.</p> \n    <p>For twenty years, the little\
  \ half-elf pushed herself to meet ever more insane requirements laid down by her\
  \ aging father. Schoolmates nicknamed her \"the Phantom\" as she vanished often\
  \ to practice her quick draw or memorize technical volumes. Tutors and governesses\
  \ thought her adle-brained as she sat staring, redrawing engineer's schematics in\
  \ her mind rather than follow her lessons. Even before she was old enough to entertain\
  \ her first romance, she had mastered the construction and firing of a rifle, and\
  \ could reckon complex trajectories by eye alone.</p> \n    <p>An old man and long\
  \ since retired by the time his daughter reached womanhood, Dahmok could no longer\
  \ forbid her entry into the shieldmarshals. But the old patriot's influence lived\
  \ on in his successors, and to honor his service they assigned Lirianne to a quiet\
  \ domestic position, safeguarding farming settlements along the secure Alkenstar-Martel\
  \ road. Ten years of her life passed rounding up drunks and mediating water rights,\
  \ eating away at her passion for adventure in ways her father's disapproval never\
  \ could. Her childhood dreams eventually forgotten, Lirianne's steely eyes dulled\
  \ with the tarnish of a thousand mundane details.</p> \n    <p>It was kismet when\
  \ a storm of wild magic blew off the Spellscar Desert, past Alkenstar, and into\
  \ her jurisdiction. The rampant arcane energy, fallout from centuries of wizard\
  \ warfare, warped space and time around it. The magical swells lashed out, reshaping\
  \ hillsides, boiling sand into glass, and calling forth bizarre creatures from the\
  \ dawn of history. The only marshal at hand, Lirianne leapt into service. As townsfolk\
  \ huddled in their cellars and buildings crumbled into twisted forms of misbegotten\
  \ wood and bone, a bolt of green lightning lashed out, striking the half-elf even\
  \ as she confronted the storm's abominations.</p> \n    <p>Lirianne awoke soaking\
  \ and half-drowned on distant shores. The bizarre country was flush with thick forests\
  \ and green hills—plant life like she'd never seen. Wandering inland, she soon encountered\
  \ a lumber caravan beset by malicious fey. In a heartbeat, a childhood's worth of\
  \ stories welled up inside her, and she rushed into battle with a passion long since\
  \ forgotten. The grateful caravan loaded her with all the supplies and information\
  \ she could manage, confirming that her inexplicable odyssey had deposited her cleanly\
  \ in the midst of those same shining knights, devious fairies, and mighty dragons\
  \ who had occupied so much of her youth.</p> \n    <p>Now a wanderer in the strange\
  \ land of Avistan, Lirianne struggles to balance her resurgence of childhood wonder\
  \ and adult dedication to justice, all while confronting her long-ignored elven\
  \ blood. While thoughts of family and the familiar industrial life of Alkenstar\
  \ occasionally tug at her roaming heart, sights remain unseen and people remain\
  \ unsaved, and Lirianne will be damned if she'll fail in either. </p>\n    <p>Crystal\
