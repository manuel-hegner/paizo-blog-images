  \   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 28, 2012</p> \n   <p>She’s ready to pounce!</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>If I have the pounce ability and I charge with a lance, do my iterative\
  \ lance attacks get the extra damage multiplier from charging?</b></p> \n   <p>No,\
  \ for two reasons.</p> \n   <p>One, because a lance only deals extra damage when\
  \ you’re riding a charging mount—not when you are charging.</p> \n   <p>Two, even\
  \ if you have an unusual combination of rules that allows you to ignore the above\
  \ limitation, it doesn’t makes sense that those iterative attacks gain the damage\
  \ bonus. To make that second attack, you have to pull the lance back and stab forward\
  \ again, and that stab doesn’t have the benefit of the charge’s momentum. (The <i>Core\
  \ Rulebook</i> doesn’t state that you only get the damage multiplier on the first\
  \ attack with a lance because there is no rule in the <i>Core Rulebook</i> that\
  \ allows a PC to charge and take multiple attacks with a weapon, so that combination\
  \ didn’t need to be addressed.)</p> \n   <p><b>If I drink a potion, do I automatically\
  \ forgo my save against that potion?</b></p> \n   <p>No. Nothing in the potion rules\
  \ says it changes whether or not you get a saving throw against the spell stored\
  \ in the potion. Even if someone hands you a <i>potion of poison</i> and tells you\
  \ it’s a <i>potion of cure serious wounds</i>, you still get a save.</p> \n   <p><b>Does\
  \ the dodge bonus from the “offensive defensive” rogue talent (Advanced Player’\
  s Guide, page 131) stack with itself? Does it apply to everyone, or just to the\
  \ target I’m attacking?</b></p> \n   <p>There are two issues relating to this rogue\
  \ talent.</p> \n   <p>One, in the first printing it provided a +1 circumstance bonus\
  \ against the attacked target, which was a very weak ability. The second printing\
  \ update changed it from a circumstance bonus to a dodge bonus, but accidentally\
  \ omitted the “against that creature” text, which made it a very strong ability.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Two, it doesn’t specify whether the dodge bonus stacks with itself, and\
  \ because this creates a strange place in the rules where bonuses don’t stack from\
  \ the same source but dodge bonuses always stack. While we haven’t reached a final\
  \ decision on what to do about this talent, we are leaning toward this solution:\
  \ <i>the dodge bonus only applies against the creature you sneak attacked, and the\
  \ dodge bonus does not stack with itself</i>. This prevents you from getting a dodge\
  \ bonus to AC against a strong creature by sneak attacking a weak creature, and\
  \ prevents you from reaching an absurdly high AC by sneak attacking multiple times\
  \ in the same round.</p> \n   <p>Sean K Reynolds<br> <i>Designer</i></p> \n  </blockquote>\
