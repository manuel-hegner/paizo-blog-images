  description\">In the United States and many other countries throughout Europe and\
  \ the Americas (and likely beyond), the transition between October and November\
  \ is a time for Halloween, Dia de los Muertos, and other festivals that mix spiritual\
  \ significance and macabre imagery. Having grown up loving Halloween—no surprise,\
  \ I suppose, given my love of playing other characters in RPGs—I like to include\
  \ a spooky scenario on the schedule in October whenever possible. This year, Tom\
  \ Phillips returns with his third scenario: <a href=\"/products/btpy9986\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #6-06: Hall of the Flesh Eaters</i></a>, a Tier 1-5 scenario\
  \ that takes place on one of the Gloomspires, an array of ancient towers rising\
  \ from the ocean west of the Eye of Abendego. This is a new feature of Tom's invention\
  \ picked up from his <a href=\"/threads/rzs2noiz\">2012 Top 8 RPG Superstar submission</a>\
  \ (careful—there are some light spoilers in the link), and we at Paizo agreed it\
  \ would be a great fit for Golarion. It's been fun giving Tom a lot of creative\
  \ freedom to flesh out (har har) this location, and I know you're going to enjoy\
  \ the creepy atmosphere and encounters.</p> \n     <p>The other scenario for the\
  \ month is <a href=\"/products/btpy9987\"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-07:\
  \ Valley of Veiled Flame</i></a> by returning author Nathan King. I really enjoy\
  \ picking up old plot threads, and for years players and GMs alike have asked when\
  \ they might see a use for one particular unique item that appeared on a Chronicle\
  \ sheet many years ago. In this Tier 5-9 adventure, the PCs travel deep into the\
  \ Zho mountains on the trail of a lost team of Pathfinders only to find an extraordinary\
  \ treasure hidden among the peaks. I'd rather not spoil the plot for you, so I'll\
  \ just leave you with this piece of art.</p> \n     <p>Also, you may have heard\
  \ about the upcoming Occult Adventures hardcover book and seen <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgmt&amp;page=last?Signs-and-Portents\"\
  >signs about an upcoming playtest</a>. In the past, <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign</a> has participated in the playtest\
  \ phase of other hardcover books, and we intend to continue that tradition with\
  \ Occult Adventures—with a bit of a twist: We will provide a Chronicle sheet available\
  \ as a free download that incentivizes testing one of the new classes and providing\
  \ feedback during the playtest window based on how many times you played.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Finally, I've begun experimenting with a new type of boon. I'll say no\
  \ more on the subject, but I'm interested to hear what people think when they start\
  \ seeing it on Chronicle sheets. When that time comes, I strongly encourage you\
  \ to discuss it with spoiler tags or noting the spoiler nature in the thread's subject\
  \ line, for I would appreciate players having a chance to discover it through play\
  \ and come to their own conclusions first.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
