  \ Howl of the Wild</em> is now officially out! I hope everyone’s been having fun\
  \ making new characters, whether they’re minotaur druids, centaur wild mimics, or\
  \ awakened koi witches with the Ripple in the Deep patron who navigate on land in\
  \ enchanted supramarine chairs that double as their cauldrons! I hope, too, that\
  \ you’re enjoying some new animals to throw at your PCs, or just having fun reading\
  \ the tale of Baranthet and the <em>Zoetrope</em>’s crew as they fly about Golarion!</p>\n\
  \      <p>Of course, this book had its own crew in the form of wonderful writers\
  \ and designers who each brought a taste of the wild to the project and were sure\
  \ to keep the writers’ room well supplied with animal gifs and links to nature documentaries.\
  \ Get to know some of them below and feel free to shout out any bits you enjoy!</p>\n\

  \ James pitched <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, I was immediately hooked! I want to bring\
  \ a sense of embodiment to TTRPGs so that players and GMs have tools to understand\
  \ what it might be like to live in a world so fantastic, so I was looking forward\
  \ to focusing an Attenborourgh-style lens on Golarion’s natural world. While working\
  \ on my sections—the athamaru ancestry, holdfast, some of the big game siege weapons,\
  \ and the Warden of Caverns and Burrows—I hoped to make the world seem fantastical\
  \ from its skies to its lowest depths. This book is going to be a great tool as\
  \ I continue to run my own games and design adventures, and I can't wait to see\
  \ how everyone uses it in their games.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Chris Bissette\
  \ (he/they)</h3>\n      <p>Hello! I'm Chris Bissette, a game designer from the UK.\
  \ Writing for Pathfinder has been a dream of mine for over a decade at this point,\
  \ and I'm delighted to have finally had the opportunity on <em>Howl of the Wild</em>.\
  \ Monsters were my first love in RPGs and getting to put together the dischorans\
  \ for this book was some of the most fun I've had writing games.</p>\n      <p>When\
  \ I'm not writing for Pathfinder, I can usually be found working on my free and\
  \ very imaginatively titled dungeon crawler <a href=\"https://loottheroom.itch.io/a-dungeon-game\"\
  >A Dungeon Game</a>. On socials, you can find me on Bluesky <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/loottheroom.bsky.social\"\
  >@loottheroom.bsky.social</a>.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Jeremy Blum (he/him)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>I wrote the ostilli host archetype for <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, the\
  \ anti-behemoth weaponry (anybody catch the Godzilla reference in there?), and the\
  \ decapod dinghy, which is basically Catbus as a giant crab. Contributing to this\
  \ wonderful celebration of nature's finest offerings was a nice shift, as it immediately\
  \ followed the work I did to redesign Linvarre for the <em>Lost Omens Tian Xia World\
  \ Guide</em>, which should now be in everyone’s hands. I've also penned some rad\
  \ stuff for the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> and have several unannounced Pathfinder\
  \ contributions in the pipelines.</p>\n      <p>Outside of the Paizo sphere, my\
  \ biggest project is <a href=\"https://www.threesailsstudios.com/mappamundirpg\"\
  >Mappa Mundi: An Exploration + Ecology RPG</a> for Three Sails Studios, a small\
  \ three-man company based in the UK. It's a TTRPG about mapping the wilderness,\
  \ studying monsters like a biologist instead of fighting them, and returning the\
  \ art of storytelling to a voiceless world. Our recently released playtest could\
  \ be used in conjunction with <em>Howl of the Wild</em> to run a gorgeous, monster-observing\
  \ campaign that spans Golarion and beyond, since the themes are quite similar! Mappa\
  \ Mundi's full release will crowdfund in 2025, so if you're interested, please follow\

  \ is the first Pathfinder project I’ve ever written for! A thousand thanks to James\

  \ to work on Pathfinder. It's opened a number of doors for me, and I love getting\
  \ to be a part of the game I love (and market, haha). For Howl, I worked on the\

  \      <p>Hi everyone! I first wanted to say that it was a fantastic experience\
  \ to be able to work on this project alongside so many other talented writers. Getting\
  \ to see so much positive feedback on the creatures that I wrote (apothecary bee\
  \ and hardhead mole) has already done numbers to lift my spirits, and seeing someone\
  \ refer to my beastmaster feats as \"swanky AF\" really made my day. I wanted to\
  \ give a quick shoutout to James Case and the rest of the Paizo team for having\
  \ me on this project and allowing me to pour my heart and soul into this project.\
  \ I can't wait to see what kind of characters my friends and the community at large\
  \ come up with given the sheer quantity of high-quality work that can be found in\
  \ this book.</p>\n      <p>Also, be sure to check out some of the other Pathfinder\

  \ these days, but I pop up in a few books here and there. Most recently, I worked\

  \  <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! I'm Dustin Knight, Starfinder developer and proud\
  \ freelancer for the incredible tome of beasts and critters that lies before you!\
  \ Working on the swarmkeeper archetype was a blast and fulfilled one of my long-time\
  \ bucket-list entries of designing an insect-themed archetype. While I've yet to\
  \ incorporate my own swarm of creepy-crawlies, I'm a big fan of bugs, especially\
  \ bees! If you'd like to help your local pollinators, you can find resources such\
  \ as Lawns to Legumes that can help turn your yard into a pollinator's paradise.</p>\n\
  \      <p>I also wrote some of the spells in <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, including\
  \ <em>antlion trap</em>, <em>summon stampede</em>, and <em>summon warden of the\
  \ wild</em>. You can catch me on dozens of different Paizo-adjacent Discord servers,\
  \ including my own for <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/JBERvMFVtJ\">Pathfinder\
  \ Infinite creators and fans</a> under the username KitsuneWarlock. You can also\
  \ catch me at PaizoCon on the Paizo Events Discord where I'll be answering questions,\
  \ posting memes, and participating in some panels! I'd love to answer as many of\
  \ your questions as I can and hear about the insects you'll be using with your future\
  \ swarmkeepers!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Christiana Lewis (she/her)</h3>\n   \
  \   <p>Greetings and salutations! This was my first ever TTRPG writing experience,\
  \ and I’m so grateful to James Case and the whole team for their support. I had\
  \ the unique privilege of writing up the <em>Zoetrope</em>’s design and seeing it\
  \ be brought to life by the artists was an incredible experience I’ll never forget.\
  \ Working with Paizo really set the standard for what I expect as a freelance writer.\
  \ I can’t wait for everyone to get their hands on this special book.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>I’m currently working on some other TTRPG projects, all of which will be announced\
  \ in time on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carpechristi\">Twitter</a>. You can find\
  \ me at @carpechristi on all socials. In the meantime, I love streaming TTRPG Actual\

  \ I’m also a Pathfinder author of long standing—if you’ve suffered at the hands\

  \ that is my fault. I regret nothing.</p>\n      <p>In this particular venture,\
  \ I was responsible for writing the merfolk ancestry, the sky fisher, and the character\
  \ of my beloved buggy protégé, Ten. The merfolk ancestry was a particularly interesting\
  \ challenge—usually, the trick with ancestries is filling them out, but here, we\
  \ had a veritable buffet of myth, legend, and pop culture to choose from. If you\

  \ for Paizo (credits at <a href=\"https://klspeedling.com/\">klspeedling.com</a>).\
  \ For <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, I did the bio for Charikleia, the Techniques and\
  \ Tricks story, the sharks (my favorite ocean creatures!), and the Warden of Peaks\
  \ and Skies.</p>\n      <p>When writing, I had to decide the type of contest to\
  \ choose the new warden. A sky race made sense for flying creatures, but I didn’\
  t want it to be that straightforward. I thought about what qualities the wardens\
  \ might value, and one that jumped out to me was the interconnection of the natural\
  \ world; while nature can be harsh and unforgiving, nothing within it exists in\
  \ isolation, and I felt the wardens would be mindful of that. Maybe the true test\
  \ would be the candidates’ willingness to aid others and accept help in turn. I\
  \ wondered if it was too trite, too saccharine. But I decided that if I often need\
  \ the reminder that assistance isn’t cheating or failure, just a part of existence,\
  \ well… maybe someone else might need that, too.</p>\n      <p>The storm’s rough\
  \ out there. Help others fly if you can, and don’t begrudge yourself the need to\
  \ shelter under someone else’s wing for a while.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ Tam</h3>\n      <p>Hello everyone! I'm Kyle, a writer from the Philippines, and\
  \ this is my first time writing for Paizo! For this book, I had the pleasure of\
  \ introducing everyone to your favorite navigator, Lythea, and writing the thunder\
  \ snake! I've written my own tabletop RPGs as well as writing for other people’\
  s games, and I've also published my fair share of short stories, all of which you\
  \ can find at <a href=\"https://whatkylewrites.carrd.co/\">https://whatkylewrites.carrd.co/</a>.</p>\n\
  \      <p>I LOVE mermaids, so it is with absolute joy that I took on the task of\
  \ bringing Lythea to life! She's basically the kind of character I'd love to play\
  \ in a campaign of exploration, at one with the land, sea, and sky thanks to adaptive\
  \ technologies giving her the best of all worlds. The thunder snake concept came\
  \ to me by looking at electrical cords and adjustable lamps, watching the way coils\
  \ and wires moved—so you can imagine it like a giant electrical plug!</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Thank you so much for supporting <em>Howl of the Wild</em>!!!</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h3>Ruvaid Virk</h3>\n      <p>Good day, friends! Ruvaid Virk, sometimes\
  \ Paizo contributor, here. It's so wild that they keep letting me on these books,\
  \ but I'm super grateful for it. First, I'd like to say how proud I am to have contributed\
  \ to this cool book alongside other fantastic authors. Field biology was one of\
  \ my favorite undergrad classes, and seeing this book come together has brought\
  \ me an untold amount of joy. Only one thing could make this better for me, and\
  \ that's if all of you would share your favorite parts of the book. Now, maybe you're\
  \ wondering, \"That's cool, Ruvaid, but what did you work on?\"</p>\n      <p>Surprise,\
  \ dear reader, for I have seeded a trail to answer that very question—one that can\
  \ be found by tracing steps back through these sentences of mine.</p>\n      <p>That's\
  \ right, it was the griffon section! Well, that, and some of the beast armaments\
  \ and alchemical items.</p>\n      <p>I hope you guys enjoy this awesome book. There's\
  \ a ton of cool things in here that I can't wait to play with for myself.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Should you want to know more about me or my works, you can follow me on\
