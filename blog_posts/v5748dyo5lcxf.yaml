  \ Module Play</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, December 12, 2011</p> \n   <p>A\
  \ year ago, Pathfinder Modules were sanctioned for play in Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play. As Atlanta Venture-Captain for a year, I appreciated the fact I could offer\
  \ the sanctioned modules to local players, especially those who had played every\
  \ scenario that had been released. But the rules that were established bothered\
  \ me. No negative effects carried over from module play, even death or consumable\
  \ use. Many players I talked with felt that sanctioned module play was not as good\
  \ as it could be because of the rules put into place. One of my top goals when hired\
  \ as Campaign Coordinator was to reevaluate sanctioned modules and see if we could\
  \ change the way they worked to make them a more valuable part of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play campaign.</p> \n   <p>What I would like to see in the comments\
  \ to this blog are what you do and don’t like about the below proposal. How will\
  \ this proposal affect your game in both a positive and negative way. Once I review\
  \ feedback over the next few weeks, the Venture-Captains, Venture-Lieutenants, and\
  \ I can decide what changes we want to make in the upcoming 4.1 update to the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i></a>.</p>\
  \ \n   <div style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">\n    <b>Spoiler:</b> \n    <input type=\"\
  button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\"\
  >\n    <div class=\"spoilerText\"> \n     <p>Pathfinder modules are produced for\
  \ a wider audience than just Pathfinder Society Organized Play. Because modules\
  \ are structured differently from scenarios, the specific rules changes needed for\
  \ playing sanctioned modules in Pathfinder Society Organized Play are presented\
  \ below.</p> \n     <h2>How to Play</h2> \n     <p>Sanctioned modules are generally\
  \ three times the length of a standard Pathfinder Society scenario and will likely\
  \ take players two or three 4—5 hour sessions to complete. They do not contain Pathfinder\
  \ Society faction missions, nor are they tiered for play by characters over a wide\
  \ range of levels. Thematically, modules do not assume the characters are members\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society. GMs and players are encouraged to create a reasonable\
  \ plot hook for their characters’ participation.</p> \n     <h2>Legal Pathfinder\
  \ Society Characters</h2> \n     <p>Players have the following three options when\
  \ playing sanctioned modules for Pathfinder Society:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>A\
  \ player must use an existing Pathfinder Society character (without modification)\
  \ within one level of the module’s starting level.</li> \n      <li>For modules\
  \ below 9th level, a player who does not have a character in the correct level range\
  \ may use a Pathfinder Society pregenerated character available on paizo.com. In\
  \ this case, the chronicle sheet must be linked to an existing Pathfinder Society\
  \ character and applied when that character reaches the level of the module. The\
  \ linked character must be declared before play begins and recorded on the scenario\
  \ reporting sheet.</li> \n      <li>As mentioned in Chapter 5 of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy84k4\"><i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i></a>, if you\
  \ have already played the sanctioned module and wish to play it an additional time\
  \ for any reason, you must inform the GM that you have already played the sanctioned\
  \ module. If you spoil the plot for the other players at the table, the GM has the\
  \ right to ask you to leave. You are free to replay the sanctioned module in order\
  \ to meet a minimum PC requirement (see Chapter 7), but if you already have received\
  \ a player Chronicle for this sanctioned module for any of your PCs, you do not\
  \ earn any additional rewards beyond having a good time. The Tier 1 exception still\
  \ applies for Tier 1-—2 modules.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <h2>Conditions, Death,\
  \ and Expendables</h2> \n     <p>Whether playing your own character or a pregenerated\
  \ character, all conditions (including death) not resolved within the module carry\
  \ beyond the end of the module. Likewise, any wealth spent or resources expended\
  \ during the course of the adventure are tracked and must be recorded on the Chronicle\
  \ sheet.</p> \n     <p>If you are using a pregenerated character, calculate the\
  \ cost of any consumables used and mark this cost on the Chronicle sheet. Any remaining\
  \ conditions are applied to the linked character when the Chronicle sheet is applied\
  \ to that character.</p> \n     <p>The one exception is when a character remains\
  \ dead at the conclusion of the module. In this case, the linked character is permanently\
  \ dead and removed from play immediately. In resolving any conditions on a pregenerated\
  \ character, Prestige Points and gold from the linked character may be used to pay\
  \ for the cost of the <i>raise dead</i> or <i>resurrection</i> spell.</p> \n   \
  \  <h2>Applying Credit</h2> \n     <p>All players receive a Chronicle sheet unless,\
  \ at the GM’s discretion, they are replaying the module for no credit. If a player\
  \ uses an existing Pathfinder Society character for the adventure, he must apply\
  \ the Chronicle sheet to that character immediately. A player who uses a pregenerated\
  \ character must apply the Chronicle sheet to his linked Pathfinder Society character\
  \ when that character reaches the starting level of the module.</p> \n     <p>A\
  \ GM who runs a module may likewise apply the Chronicle sheet to one of her Pathfinder\
  \ Society characters. The GM must decide which of her characters will receive the\
  \ Chronicle sheet when the module is completed and the Chronicle sheets are filled\
  \ out. Playing a module from beginning to end earns a character 3 XP and 4 Prestige\
  \ Points if that character is on the normal advancement track or 1.5 XP and 2 Prestige\
  \ Points for characters on the slow advancement track. There are no day job rolls\
  \ when playing a sanctioned module.</p> \n     <p>If a character dies and is brought\
  \ back to life, the GM must determine the rewards for that character. The minimum\
  \ possible reward is 0 GP, 1 XP and 1 PP on the normal advancement track or 1/2\
  \ XP and 1/2 Prestige Point on the slow advancement track. If a character participates\
  \ in more than 2/3 of the module, he should receive full rewards. GMs and active\
  \ players are encouraged to hasten the return of a character waiting to be raised\
  \ from the dead.</p> \n     <p>Players who do not complete each game session earn\
  \ 1 fewer XP and Prestige Point for each session missed. This also applies to players\
  \ who join later sessions; they receive 1 fewer XP and Prestige Point for each session\
  \ missed. In both cases players earn a minimum of 1 XP and 1 Prestige Point (or\
  \ 1/2 XP and 1/2 Prestige Point on the slow advancement track). If a character earns\
  \ more XP than she needs to reach her next level, she may not choose to switch advancement\
  \ tracks at the new level earned.</p> \n     <p>As always, each player may receive\
  \ credit for each module once as a player and once as a GM, in either order. Players\
  \ must accept a Chronicle sheet for their character the first time they play a module.\
  \ A player may replay a module at the GM’s discretion, but the player may not receive\
  \ more than one player Chronicle sheet per module. The only exception is Tier 1—\
  2 modules. A player may only play a Tier 1—2 module for credit once with a 2nd-level\
  \ character, but may use additional 1st-level characters to replay the same module\
  \ for credit.</p> \n     <h2>Running Multi-Session Modules</h2> \n     <p>Since\
  \ sanctioned modules can be multi-session events, Pathfinder Society characters\
  \ may not be used in other Pathfinder Society events until they receive a Chronicle\
  \ sheet for the module. This does not apply to a player using a pregenerated character\
  \ until the linked character reaches the starting level of the module.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>GMs are advised to work with players who miss the final session of the module\
  \ in order for those players to receive their Chronicle sheets.</p> \n    </div>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <h2>Retirement and Beyond</h2> \n   <p>In the interest of allowing\
  \ Pathfinder Society characters to extend their adventuring careers, and to utilize\
  \ sanctioned Pathfinder Modules to their fullest enjoyment, I would like feedback\
  \ on allowing Pathfinder Society characters to advance past 12th level for sanctioned\
  \ module play only.</p> \n   <p>The level cap for the campaign is still 12. There\
  \ are no current plans for us to publish any Pathfinder Society scenarios of 13th\
  \ level or higher. However, there are more modules on the schedule that are 13+\
  \ levels. We do have some stand-alone, Tier 12 scenarios on the radar for those\
  \ that do not wish to play <a href=\"/products/btpy8bub\"><i>Eyes of the Ten</i></a>,\
  \ but wish to play three additional scenarios at 12th level and then retire. Just\
  \ as with every other Pathfinder Society Scenario, <i>Eyes of the Ten</i> is not\
  \ open for replay and that isn't going to change. So, the addition of more Tier\
  \ 12 scenarios, or another retirement arc, allows for players to have options.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>This part of the proposal would allow people to play a “retired” character\
  \ through higher-level sanctioned modules, receive credit, and not have to play\
  \ an artificially leveled character. This also helps to balance the wealth-by-level\
  \ curve as presented currently at the end of <i>Eyes of the Ten</i> that presents\
  \ 13th-level wealth for 12th-level characters. Right now it is difficult for us\
  \ to plan special retirement events for 12th-level characters mentioned 3 years\
  \ ago because characters’ wealth-by-level is so imbalanced.</p> \n   <p>Mark and\
  \ I have discussed this and here is how I plan to incorporate advancement for 13th\
  \ level and higher. This will open up the extended career of Pathfinder Society\
  \ characters if people want to utilize modules in that manner.</p> \n   <div style=\"\
  margin-bottom:2px\">\n    <b>Spoiler:</b> \n    <input type=\"button\" value=\"\
  Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n    <div class=\"\
  spoilerText\"> \n     <p>Once you reach 12th level, it would require 3 XP to advance\
  \ to 13th level and beyond as normal. We will adjust the <i>Eyes of the Ten</i>\
  \ arc so you receive 2 XP after Part 1 and 1 XP for Parts 2, 3, and 4. Once you\
  \ complete Parts 1 and 2 of <i>Eyes of the Ten</i>, you may advance your character\
  \ to 13th level. Mark and I reviewed Parts 3 and 4 and all CRs are higher than 13\
  \ so there shouldn't be a significant effect on the play of either of those. Once\
  \ you complete <i>Eyes of the Ten</i>, you will still be 13th level and one XP short\
  \ of advancement of 14th level. This will allow you to roll right into playing <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8l3i\"><i>Academy of Secrets</i></a> at level for the module.\
  \ Any character who has completed Parts 1 and 2 of <i>Eyes of the Ten</i> may advance\
  \ to 13th level.</p> \n     <p>At 13th level, you can then play your Pathfinder\
  \ Society character in <i>Academy of Secrets</i> and receive full credit as normal,\
  \ but you may play it at 13th level. We will be adjusting the gold received at the\
  \ end of <i>Academy of Secrets</i>.</p> \n     <p>Upon completion of <i>Academy\
  \ of Secrets</i>, the character would receive 3 XP and be one short of 15th level.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>At the end of <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5y\"><i>Tomb of the Iron Medusa</i>,\
  \ the character would receive 3 more XP and be one short of 16th level.</a></p><a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8j5y\"> </a>\n     <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8j5y\">In the\
  \ future, Paizo will release additional high-level modules that will also be sanctioned\
  \ for play. We will eventually sanction </a><a href=\"/products/btpy8go0\"><i>The\
  \ Witchwar Legacy</i></a> once it is possible for someone having played everything\
  \ to reach 17th level. We will make gold adjustments accordingly for those Chronicle\
  \ sheets.</p> \n     <p>To help GMs and players use their Pathfinder Society characters\
  \ in retirement and beyond, both the wealth and Fame tables will be extended beyond\
  \ their current limits.</p> \n    </div>\n   </div>\n   <br> \n   <p>The above changes\
  \ would not go into effect until version 4.1 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"\
  ><i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i></a> is released. Also, I am very\
  \ aware that people might be in the middle of a multiple-play session for a sanctioned\
  \ module, or be involved in a play-by-post game that takes months instead of one\
  \ or two game sessions.</p> \n   <p>If these changes were to go into effect, I plan\
  \ to grandfather in modules caught in the middle of multiple sessions when this\
  \ goes live. I also plan to assign a Venture-Captain as the coordinator for this\
  \ endeavor. Players and GMs will have a month to register their games as \"grandfathered\"\
  \ games. After that time, no new module play should begin under the old rules. These\
  \ registered \"grandfathered\" games have until the start of Season 4 to complete\
  \ their games and report such to the Venture-Captain.</p> \n   <p>So there you have\
  \ it. This is a proposal to modify play of sanctioned modules to bring them more\
  \ in line with standard scenario play, as well as open options for players to extend\
  \ the life of their Pathfinder Society characters. As mentioned at the beginning\
  \ of this blog, I would like to hear what you do and don’t like about the above\
  \ proposal, and how this proposal would affect your game in both a positive and\
  \ negative way if put into place.</p> \n   <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society\
