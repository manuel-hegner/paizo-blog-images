               <p itemprop="description">The manuscript that follows is taken from but a single source, stored at Windsong Abbey. It is impossible to verify the authorship of “Fafnheir’s Lament”; the book in which it is contained also includes a bestiary and various tales of monster-hunting. If authentic, the lament—written in Skald—must have been copied and recopied many times over its ten-thousand-year history, potentially introducing scribal errors. Translation was further complicated when a fire broke out at the abbey centuries ago; an anonymous librarian saved the book, but not before the manuscript was singed along one edge.

                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>So, fresh from the First World I came, Fafnheir,<br> Burdened and brandishing the eggs of my brood.<br> Boldly I’d taken the blood of my brother<br> And the price, my penance, was the exile’s path.<br> Now on Golarion I gazed, greedily,<br> For glory and gold was mine to gather.<br> From mountains where men rode upon mammoths <br> To the Obari Ocean, none could oppose me.<br> Warriors and would-be kings both went<br> Groaning with grief into my gullet.<br> I felt certain Fafnheir was fiercest,<br> First among foes, now and forever.<br> That was good killing.</p> 
                    <p>But fat on the fear of fools, I forgot<br> The fickle future of fortune’s wheel.<br> For although the life of a linnorm is long,<br> And time toughens us like an oaken tree,<br> No royal or regent is allowed to rule<br> Longer than the law of cruel fate allows.<br> Your might won’t matter, is what I am meaning,<br> When you gaze upon a god and grasp<br> The golden age of your glory is gone.<br> Heed my history, and hew<br> To the wisdom which I have won.<br> Listen to the lament of the first linnorm.</p> 
                    <p>Millennia ago by mortal measure,<br> Veiled villains seeking vengeance<br> Summoned the Starstone from the depths of space.<br> But Acavna of Azlant, bride of Amaznen<br> Made a magnificent shield of the moon.<br> She shattered the Starstone into shards<br> And some souls were spared.<br> But gone was the glory of ancient Golarion,<br> And men became cowards crouching in caves.</p> 
                    <p>Into this apocalyptic air I ascended<br> To witness what wonder remained in the world.<br> I sojourned south, taking the swan’s road,<br> And all that my eye encompassed was empty.<br> Fewer folk than you have fingers<br> Lived in that lonely desolate land.<br> But as I approached the antipodes by air<br> Stalwart survivors began to be seen,<br> Sheltering in the shade of Mwangi’s shield.<br> Here were heroes a linnorm could hunt,<br> So down I descended, hungry for dinner.</p> 
                    <p>The trees were towering torches<br> Blazing below me, their light blinding.<br> Under that kindling canopy were helpless kin-folk,<br> Mortal men and elves, Mualijae<br> Caught in a barbarous burning. <br> Time had taught them the meaning of terror,<br> For a dreadful dragon had chosen today<br> To descend and deal devastation.<br> But the fear that filled them wasn’t for Fafnheir,<br> And my blood boiled as I wondered what bastard<br> Had the craft and the courage to steal my kill.<br> Then I drew near to dread Dahak,<br> Dealer of death and desolation.<br> Then the father of linnorms felt fear<br> For the Age of Ashes had arrived.</p>

                    <p>Dark is the day I first saw Dahak<br> Feasting on fools who howled as they fled.<br> Spells and spears he shattered for sport,<br> Shields splintered, they perished in shame.<br> Blades that breached him were, by his blood,<br> Melted to mist like ice in a meadow.<br> A Mualijae maid raised her voice in mourning<br> And the greedy one paused, engrossed by her grief.<br> She sang of centuries filled with sorrow<br> How Starstone survivors became food for the slaughter.<br> But the monster was unmoved by her music;<br> Sky swallowed the smoke.</p> 
                    <p>Many are the deaths that delvers discover<br> When they dare their descent into the depths:<br> A poisonous point in the depths of a pit,<br> Or their corpse consumed by gelatinous cube,<br> Or reduced to dust, disintegrated,<br> Or by the relentless reach of a mummy’s rot,<br> Their strength sapped as they’re turned to stone<br> By the sudden stare of a medusa’s snakes,<br> Or mauled by a minotaur lost in a maze,<br> Or by a bear with the brow of an owl disemboweled.</p> 
                    <p>But lo, this litany now must be lengthened,<br> Expanding the examples of exsanguination,<br> For dungeon delvers have new ways to die:<br> Caught and cut by the dragon god’s claws<br> Or by his bite sent to the Great Beyond.<br> A swipe of his tail scatters them stumbling,<br> Beaten by the buffet of his batlike wings.<br> And finally flames hot as a furnace<br> Brightly furious forth from him fly.<br> The fearful fools caught in that fire<br> Are fried in a flash by that perilous flood.</p> 
                    <p>Lament for the linnorm who has boasted his last.<br> Long is his life, but brief is his legacy.<br> Shunted and shamed, by Dahak overshadowed,<br> To caves in the crags Fafnheir will crawl.<br> From that darkness I’ll dare not emerge. Day’s<br> Luminous light on the father of linnorms<br> Shall not shine. And my shimmering scales<br> Will henceforth be hidden, this for my hubris.<br> Wanderers into my web will be welcomed,<br> As I break my fast on their brittle bone-house.<br> But never again by noon or night<br> Will I hunt heroes, as was my habit.</p>

                  <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the Windsong Testaments—parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Leandra slapped the screaming alarm cube and rubbed her eyes before burying her head in the pillow again. <em>Ugh, too early…</em></p> 
                   <p>A few minutes later she groaned and rolled out of her bunk, stretching as she padded her way into the communal area.</p> 
                   <p>"Oh, morning, Lea. I just drank the last of the instant. Sorry." Her overly chipper, and well caffeinated roommate held up the empty pot apologetically. </p> 
                   <p>“Nok! How could you? You knew I was pulling a double today!” The scowl she leveled at the curvy ysoki would send most others hurrying out of her way, but Nok just grinned and stretched up to kiss her on the cheek. </p> 
                   <p>“I'll pick up more on the way home tonight, promise!" She rushed out the door in a swirl of activity and perfume, leaving Leandra to put the coffee pot in the sink.</p> 
                   <p>Thirty minutes and a disappointingly lukewarm shower later (<em>thanks again, Nok</em>) Leandra stood in line at the popular coffee cart just outside Ixomander’s Throne, the Azlanti-themed casino where she was currently late for her job. She hopped from foot to foot, willing the line to move faster before Mo-var, the meticulous android running the cart, closed for their mid-morning break. Suddenly, an enormous vesk came hurtling out of nowhere and plowed into her. She was knocked onto the ground, while the vesk continued running. A willowy shirren helped her back on her feet before bolting after the vesk, shouting “Sorry!” over their shoulder.</p> 
                   <p>Leandra dusted off her dark green pants and turned to see Mo-var pulling down their cart’s shudder. <em>Damned tourists! Don’t they know how hard it is to keep this faux Azlanti crap clean?</em> She threw her hands up in despair, yelling, “Come on! I was in line and everything before those junk jockeys pushed me over!” Mo-var ignored her, and she went to give the cart a swift kick but stopped when a glint from the ground caught her eye. A misshapen piece of metal and plastic laid on the sidewalk, most likely dropped by the fleeing vesk. </p> 
                   <p>Leandra picked it up and shouted in the direction the two had ran. “Just because we live near a junkyard doesn’t mean you can litter!” She grumbled to herself about inconsiderate off-worlders and inflexible androids, absent-mindedly slipped the piece of trash into her pocket, and stepped into the casino.</p>

                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Leandra stretched she trudged out of the casino, her back aching after a grueling double shift on her feet serving drinks to increasingly inebriated gamblers. Spying Mo-var’s coffee cart—now open for the evening rush—and knowing that Nok probably forgot to get more instant, she started to wander over. Her way was blocked by a pair of local gang members (<em>True Warriors by the look of them—bunch of lowlifes</em>) diving out of the way of the wide swing of a doshko, wielded by the same vesk from earlier in the day. This time, a lashunta woman followed, her hands glowing with magic.</p> 
                   <p>“Really?” Leandra said out loud, too tired to properly process how much danger she was currently in. Mo-var, however, seemed to understand, quickly closing their cart window. Leandra was startled into action when a stray bullet from one of the True Warriors’ pistols struck the casino wall just a few feet from her. She scurried home, locked the deadbolts, and enabled the security system even though she knew it didn’t work properly. Nok had promised to get it fixed months ago.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Nok stumbled in, giggling and slightly tipsy. The security system let out a pair of weak, unconvincing beeps and gave up, but it was loud enough to startle Leandra awake from where she’d dozed off on the couch. </p> 
                   <p>“Someone had a good night.” </p> 
                   <p>Nok plopped onto the couch next to her. “Hot date with Rush! Oh, so much fun. You should come out with us one of these days! She even has a cute brother...” She chuckled, draping herself over Leandra.</p> 
                   <p>“No time. We’re short-staffed at work. Maybe next week.” She pushed her friend off her lap with a laugh. Nok was always trying to set her up on dates—when she wasn’t on the prowl for her own that is. She’d gone on more than a few disastrous outings at the younger girl’s urging but hadn't clicked with any of her suitors. “Tell you what, I’ll make us both something to eat. You need something in your stomach.” She ruffled the hair beneath Nok’s ear on her way to the kitchenette.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>The next day, Leandra had another double. Midway through, her feet and back were already aching and her ears were sweltering in her fake helmet, but she kept a smile firmly plastered on her face as she bustled between tables and the bar. Needing a break from fending off the advances of the junk jockeys who had hit a prize and enduring the glowering looks from the locals determined to lose all their cash, she gestured to her manager that she was going to briefly step outside.</p> 
                   <p>She ordered a cup of her usual from Mo-var to boost her flagging energy and had barely taken a sip when her arm was jostled from behind, sending the drink flying. </p> 
                   <p>“Oh. Come. On!” She was nearly in tears as she turned to see the shirren from the previous day. A ysoki stood next to them, looking sheepish, and the vesk and lashunta were over by the casino entrance. </p> 
                   <p>“YOU!” Leandra gasped. “You owe me at least 3 cups of coffee!” She poked the shirren in the chest, whose antennae twitched in confusion. “First, you knocked me out of line, then you started that brawl in the street, and now you made me spill this one because you can’t bother to watch where you’re going!”</p> 
                   <p>The big vesk lumbered up to them. “Is there a problem?” she rumbled.</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah! You and your buddies keep making me lose my coffee and I’m getting sick of it!” Leandra’s shouting was beginning to draw a few gawkers, but she didn't care. “And another thing! You can’t just leave trash wherever you want!” She retrieved the piece of metal and plastic from her pocket and flung it at the vesk’s chest. The vesk fumbled with it for a moment but didn’t drop it. Her eyes widened as she took a better look at the scrap.</p> 
                   <p>“Quig,” the vesk said, turning to the ysoki. “This is the other half of the keycard.”</p> 
                   <p>“You dropped it?!” the ysoki asked incredulously.</p> 
                   <p>“Uh, I guess so.” The vesk looked uncomfortable. She looked back at Leandra. “Hey, sorry about all this. Let me make it up to you. After all, I think you just saved us a lot of trouble.” She ordered an extra-large from Mo-var, handing over enough credits to cover the price a few times over. The android filled up a sizable travel mug with a secured lid and placed it in the cart’s window. Leandra scooped up the coffee and chugged half of it as if she were afraid it would get away.</p> 
                   <p>“Thank you,” Leandra said. “I have to get back to work now.” She turned on her heel to re-enter the casino, hearing the other four begin to chatter excitedly with each other.</p> 
                   <p>Later, she had quite the story to tell her roommate. Nok suspected the four were treasure hunters looking for a big score out in the junk, and they must have crossed the True Warriors in the process. Both of them speculated wildly as to what their “keycard” unlocked well into the night.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>The following evening, the four approached Leandra on the casino floor. “There she is!” the vesk bellowed with a grin on her face. “My favorite Aeon Guard! We’ve got something for you!” She dropped a credstick onto Leandra’s tray.</p> 
                   <p>A little wary, Leandra picked up the credstick, peeked at the display, and nearly fainted at the amount printed there. She wrapped her arm around the vesk’s waist in gratitude.</p> 
                   <p>“Should be enough to keep you in coffee for a while,” the ysoki smirked. “And when you’re done squeezing Obo to death, we’ll have a round of your most expensive booze. In fact, make ‘em doubles. We’re celebrating another successful mission!” </p> 
                   <p>The group cheered.</p>

But they’re so much more than that: they’re building a community of unique individuals with a love for all things RPG. They combine the fun of tabletop roleplay with the quest toward suicide awareness and prevention, and it’s nothing short of amazing.</p>

                   <p>We’ve got some great scenarios in store for Pathfinders this month as well! And, you might say, they start off with a bang.</p> 
                   <p>With Pathfinder agents spread across the Inner Sea to handle urgent problems at the Society’s lodges, shadowy enemies have decided to take advantage of the Grand Lodge’s apparent lack of defenders to infiltrate the vaults. Fortunately for the Society, it has made some new allies in recent years, and they’ve lent their cunning and expertise to bolster the Grand Lodge’s defenses. While a group of agents is preparing to embark on a mission in Osirion, the infiltrators make their move—and their leader is coming with them.</p> 
                   <p>I wonder if the new defenses are going to help repel the—<em>KRAKOOOOOOM!</em></p> 
                   <p>You’ll have to play to find out. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</em></a>, by Paizo’s own Luis Loza, is a Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot adventure for levels 3–6. It is the second part of the four-part “Absalom arc,” which began with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s9?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-of-Shattered-Sanctuaries"><em>Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</em></a> and will continue with two other scenarios in the coming months.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Meanwhile, another group of agents has learned that Venture-Captain Varian Jeggare, still a captive of nefarious enemies in Cheliax, has been taken to a secure location the Pathfinder Society has long thought to be abandoned. The site is brimming with guards and infernal dangers, and it won’t be easy for the agents to make their way in, locate the missing venture-captain, defeat his captors, and make it out alive.</p> 
                   <p>But an unexpected guest shows up as they’re preparing for their mission. A sinister guest, with a sinister offer. With so much at stake, perhaps the agents would be foolish to refuse…</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-307-The-Locked-Lodge"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-07: The Locked Lodge</em></a>, by veteran Pathfinder Society author Kalervo Oikarinen, is another Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot adventure for levels 3–6. It is the second part of the two-part “Cheliax arc,” which began with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ajc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-DevilWrought-Disappearance"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-04: The Devil-Wrought Disappearance</em></a>. </p>
                   <p>As a reminder, all of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot scenarios are part of small arcs taking place in various Inner Sea regions. The arcs can be played in any order, with any character of the appropriate level. While we recommend that you play the scenarios within a given arc in order—to better enjoy the narrative—it is not a requirement.</p> 
                   <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate! Happy holidays!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Do you remember sleep?</p> 
                   <p>It is one of the few clear memories I have from before the transplant. Falling into bed after a day of dedicated study. Waking, many hours later, to Sarenrae’s gentle wingbeats stirring the sky into morning splendor. That curious gulf between night and dawn and, after its crossing, how the voyage leaves one with only faint impressions of the journey. The remnants of dreams. Not fragments, exactly, but tiles without a mosaic.</p> 
                   <p>I remember sleep. But when I try to assemble those memories into a feeling, I cannot. I lack some essential component. Like forgetting the melody of your wedding song or straining to see through heat shimmer. There are ancient moments that I <em>can</em> feel, of course. The blood of the Pharaoh’s oathsworn on my muzzle. The uncertainty of moving on four limbs for the first time. The strange sensation of an arcane core—<em>my</em> core—thrumming where once a heart beat, and the dried blossom sorrow of seeing myself still and quiet in the sling of an artificer’s lattice. Caressing that castoff self’s face with newly forged digits.</p> 
                   <p>I have seen so many castoffs in this place; surely one of them was you. And maybe it is you who brought me here. As I picked my way through the dusty brass halls, past conduits thrumming with arcane vitality, it all felt so familiar. Not merely because of the similarity to my own second birthplace, but because the faint reflections of this creche have haunted me all these thousands of years.</p> 
                   <p>We do not sleep, you and I, but we do something like it. And so many times, upon exiting that pale facsimile of slumber, I would grasp at shards of foreign dreams. Visions like snowflakes—have you seen snow?—melting even as I touch them. Muted cataracts plummeting through crystalline bends, thaumaturgic rivers rushing toward unseen reservoirs. Rivulets of sand falling through a vault of brass and mithral and stone, down into a craftwork cathedral whose catacombs the dream fragments would not touch.</p> 
                   <p>I know that the Automaton Council left their names within our cores. Perhaps the masters somehow carved others’ memories inside my being. Gadflies in the mind, grit in a mouthful of water—and there! Drink, another thing remembered but not felt.</p> 
                   <p>One grows bored over the millennia. What does a soldier do when they find themself without a war? With need for neither sword nor plowshares? I was not built for peace. So I sought conflict. A wasted century spent stalking our first enemies from the east. Many years more chasing the thrill of the hunt, following the moonlit metal gleam of pack leaders. I clawed crimson paths up the heaving flanks of rough beasts. I even sunk my fangs into one of the architects of Jistka’s downfall; he thought himself safe in his sarcophagus. But the empire is no more, and even when I can find others like myself, those brief reunions cannot fully replace the pride of <em>belonging</em> to a thing. Of serving something greater and knowing that that service <em>matters</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Can you turn your head? Yes, the racks there—the weapons of an ancient an irrelevant war. And ourselves, of course.</p> 
                   <p>…I am sorry, truly, that you must emerge into this world. Ah, and for my rambling. I’ve been lonely, of late.</p> 
                   <p>In any case. Yes, the visions. All around me there is evidence that those visions were indeed more than spheresong footprints. After seven thousand years, I finally ceased grasping at snowflakes and simply let them fall, observing the pattern. In the shallow waterways of my dormant periods, I sieved stranger’s gold from dreamsand, reassembling the path to this place. Across tundra and lake, through the dead god’s favored city and banished gods’ ports, and into the deserts of my two births. Over the peaks—were these peaks not taller, once?—and up to the ragged edges of a basin.</p> 
                   <p>There are peculiarities to our artificed bodies; perhaps I can show you the trick of venting life force from your limbs. Trailing arcana, I descended toward the basin floor, a vulture circling the past, the heat shimmer below a mirror held up to my aimless aeons. When I touched the sands, they were familiar. Soft and quiet as a burial shroud.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>That shroud stirred. Ghosts rose around me. A convergence of minds and memories, as something in my core resonated with the emotions permeating this subterranean complex. It must be the hopes and sorrows of all those who set aside their flesh that fixed those visions to this place. I saw dozens of figures pull themselves from the sands, amber grit sloughing off gleaming brass shoulders. I padded through the arcade of long-gone servants as they set their phantasmal eyegems on the east. Plodded toward dissolution.</p> 
                   <p>Tail trailing in sorrow, I reached the basin’s center. Something glinted beneath the sand; a garnet eye set into a dais. Carved script radiating from the gem bore the Conclave’s ancient words:</p> 
                   <p><em>We leap from flesh to crafted hope<br> To safeguard nation, family, friend<br> We shuck ourselves and start again<br> We rise anew and know no end</em></p> 
                   <p>“Know no end”—foolish and prideful! One cannot live from Age to Age without experiencing endings beyond comprehension. No, the Imperium merely filled the deathless millennia with a thousand lesser endings.</p> 
                   <p>Those fools’ words, the ghosts of my fellows. I admit, I was overcome, crushed by reminders of long-mourned purpose. I sat on my haunches and wept.</p> 
                   <p>Did they give you the ocular fire? I barely notice it, now, but that is another half-remembered echo of my second dawn, that first fulminant beam scorching its way out of my head. Like screaming until your throat is raw, but strangely distant, and channeled so <em>tightly</em> through your sight. Channel your conviction and burn away the Imperium’s enemies. Crumpled in the basin, I had no conviction, and my fire merely trickled out as molten tears.</p> 
                   <p>They splashed against the gem, and the earth also wept and moaned. Sand hissed through widening cracks and, just as your eye did, this place irised open for the first time in ages. Below was the towering vault and crystal-banked streams of liquid arcana from those fragmented memory-dreams. Vindication and wonder soothed my soul. Stairs spiraled down from the dais, and I descended.</p> 
                   <p>Down to the sanctum. No signs of battle, as might be expected given the dreaming ghosts above. An entry hall, and a pristine mosaic of the Conclave breathing life into the first core. I loped through halls of the not-dead, their superfluous forms stacked in memorial niches while their spirits slumber here in the lattices. Slowed to peer into glowing cisterns of swirling arcane energy, still ready to quicken the remnants of the Imperium’s crowning achievement. Followed the burnished ribbon of names that marked the path to this creche.</p> 
                   <p>Why did they abandon this place? No matter—we are here now, together. Memories, both mine and others, lead me to you, and to your dormant siblings. We must wake them.</p> 
                   <p>…I am afraid. Of aimlessness. Of what I bartered with my death.</p> 
                   <p>Of rejection.</p> 
                   <p>I am no Conclave. I am no pack leader. I am merely one lost child of Jistka, one aimless wanderer who followed ancient memories to an ancient vault. But I am here, surrounded by an entire tapestry of lattices, and the joy of dozens of siblings opening bejeweled eyes.</p> 
                   <p>I remember sleep, but I do not remember how it felt. Perhaps you can tell me? And perhaps I, in turn can help you—us—forge a new purpose. One divorced from a Conclave that dissolved before they could lead you out of the space between sleep and death.</p> 
                   <p>The Song of the Spheres fades. The Dawnflower blooms. She reaches even here, below the earth, in this cradle tomb. And for a moment, in her light preserves glimmering dreams, perfect and within our grasp.</p> 
                   <p>Take my hand.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">It’s strange how quickly a life-changing period spanning years can be replaced by what was once normal. Droven was certainly happy to be back in the field undertaking a Pathfinder mission again, and even happier to have an opportunity to deploy some of the gadgets and weaponry he’d created during his long exodus in Arcadia. He’d even lent his latest weapon, a gun that could create portals, to his partner for the exercise, a clever halfling freelancer from Cheliax who’d come highly recommended by a fellow Pathfinder.</p> 
                   <p>The mission itself was fairly simple. There were reports of a large wolf or canine monster attacking travelers and caravans on the road between Absalom and Otari, a small port town on the western half of the Isle of Kortos. It was almost too simple, and in another place and time, the Pathfinder Society likely wouldn’t have sent a veteran agent still settling in after a long and dangerous journey abroad, but Otari was home to several friends of the Society, and perhaps just as relevant, it often served as a secondary destination for shipments too valuable to the wrong people to bring in through Absalom’s more closely watched ports.</p> 
                   <p>So here Droven found himself, his entertaining companion playing a tune as they walked the forested highway on their way to Otari. As always, Whirp accompanied him, the quirky construct mostly doing what it was designed to do, staying by Droven’s side so the half-orc could readily access the tools it carried, but occasionally wandering off to examine a flower or dew drop on a leaf. Droven had disassembled, reassembled, and repaired the goblin-shaped construct countless times over the years, and he still had no explanation for Whirp’s strange moments of seeming sapience, curiosity, and self-direction. There was some magic interwoven with the clockwork devices that powered Whirp. Perhaps over the years of journeying through Arcadia, Droven’s one-sided conversations with the construct had made some impact on these arcane forces, granting Whirp a tiny spark of personality. Droven still carried on these conversations. While they drew the occasional odd look (once convincing a passing goblin to join in and look to their mechanical counterpart for a response that came in the form of an awkward hug and offered crowbar) most of Droven’s friends and peers had grown used to them and occasionally spoke to Whirp themselves.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>On the evening of their second day out from Absalom, they finally encountered the creature they’d been sent to deal with. Droven was dozing by the fire, Whirp standing at his side and staring intently at an owl perched in the branches above, when their halfling companion whispered magically into his ear from his own hiding spot. “Barghest!”</p> 
                   <p>Droven snapped awake; those years traveling on his own had sharpened his mind and reflexes. Drawing his hammer and putting his back against a nearby tree, he whispered back. “So not a wolf? Unfortunate.”</p> 
                   <p>The same calm that always accompanied moments of stress descended once more over Droven. Later, when the fighting was done, his knees would shake and his eyes would water, but for now he was fully in the moment, the fire of his orcish blood fueling his analytical mind and sharpening his thoughts for the task at hand.</p> 
                   <p>The barghest lurked just beyond the range of the firelight, its batlike ears and hunched shoulders faintly backlit by the leaf-shrouded moon. Droven made a mental note to recommend the halfling for future work; even his own eyes, capable of navigating lightless tunnels and moonless nights with relative ease, could barely make out the creature. Droven doubted he would have noticed the monster had he been on watch, let alone correctly identified it under these conditions. </p> 
                   <p>He hoped their plan worked. Whirp was to leap in front of the threat, then scurry through a portal created by the experimental gun he’d given the halfling. Hopefully, the beast would follow Whirp through the portal, putting itself right in line for a thunderous blow from Droven’s hammer. Of course, they’d made the plan expecting a creature of animal intelligence, not a deadly fiend capable of critical thought with its own repertoire of magic.</p> 
                   <p>Before Droven could propose a new tactic, Whirp began acting on the original plan Droven had modified the little construct to perform.</p> 
                   <p>“Whirrrrrp!”</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Whether it was an intentional battle cry or merely the sound of the clockwork gears rattling throughout his small frame, it nonetheless signaled the start of the fight. Whirp’s body sparked for a moment before an explosive gout of flame vented from his chassis, launching the construct directly in front of the barghest. For Droven, an eternity seemed to pass as construct and barghest stared at one another, though it was likely no more than a few seconds. With a second “Whirrrrrp,” Droven’s clockwork companion lurched away, dashing through the woods as tools clattered out of the compartment on its back. Droven made a mental note to add a leather flap to the top of Whirp’s built-in toolbox even as he pressed tighter against the tree, hoping the barghest had failed to notice him or had forgotten him chasing after Whirp.</p> 
                   <p>The plan worked to perfection. The halfling opened a portal next to Droven’s hiding spot before opening another in front of Whirp. As Whirp dashed through the eldritch opening, the barghest sped right behind it. As Whirp exited, Droven swung, his hammer whistling above the construct’s head even as the barghest’s snout cleared the portal. With a thunderous crunch, the barghest popped back out of the entry portal, its head lolling weirdly on a broken neck. Droven looked away from the barghest’s death throes, uninterested in exposing himself to another creature’s agonized final moments, and nodded to his halfling companion. A good plan, or at least an effective one, cleanly executed without injury. As much as Droven would have liked to say, “without negative consequences,” he realized that would be an inaccurate assessment. Somewhere scattered among the leaves and roots of the roadside forest, Whirp had lost an expensive and worrisome number of the inventor’s favorite tools.</p>

                   <h3>GM Numbat (they/she)</h3> 
                   <p>I started playing RPGs in the mid-late ‘70s, enjoying the original D&amp;D with its flimsy booklets and fun dice. Within a year, I was running games at my all-girls high school. I’ve played many systems over the years, though usually only briefly and with long breaks between. Partly this was because of a complex interaction of several chronic mental and physical conditions which can limit my abilities. I am grateful for the Paizo Organized Play community, where I found an accepting and welcoming home. </p> 
                   <p>None of my health concerns are obvious by looking at me. The major advantage to this is that when I have a good day, no one prejudges me simply based on appearance. The major disadvantage is that when I am having a bad day, it is difficult for some to understand, as I look “normal.” Over time, I have become better at learning my limits and predicting some of those times that I need to cut back on commitments. Still, I can be caught out with an unexpected flare and have to pull out of playing, or worse, running a game. I always feel terrible when I do, even though most of our community has been wonderfully supportive. Dietary restrictions are a challenge, especially when traveling or wanting to socialize. I catch myself annoyed by someone’s fidgeting or apparent distraction at the table and remind myself that this may be their coping mechanism, just as I have mine. We are each so individual, with our own needs and concerns, often not obvious to others. Let us celebrate those differences and the unique perspective they bring.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Ivis K. Flanagan (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Disabilities come in many forms. There are disabilities that the world can observe and recognize. There are others, though, that people fight in the dark, because the social stigma of them can be a <em>silence</em> spell, where the anxiety of the possible response is more encompassing than the darkness of suffering alone. PTSD is one of those.</p> 
                   <p>PTSD is the demon that I fight. While many often associate this fight with former soldiers or others who have been in warzones, those are not the only demons at hand. Any traumatic event can be a catalyst. This is my fight—utilizing weapons of words, medications, and therapy in the ongoing battle. I now add to these this transparency in the hopes that someone else will see that they aren’t alone. You have allies who know these battlefields well.</p> 
                   <p>Another weapon against it is finding safe spaces and friends who care. I have been able to do that through this community—the players, volunteers, freelancers, and staff who I am lucky to call colleagues and friends. This community is ever growing, and its values of inclusion, diversity, and honesty are why it is a safe space, a space I am grateful to help create, and a place where no one has to fight alone. </p>

                   <h3>Avi Kool (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi all! I’m senior editor at Paizo (on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/legalizegoblins">@legalizegoblins</a>) and multiply disabled, both physically and mentally. Due to hypermobility and congenital muscle issues, I have numerous joint conditions and when walking for more than a few minutes, I have to wear braces on my knees to reduce pain. This can lead to awkward questions, uncomfortable assumptions, and a sense of self-consciousness. Sticking out in public is challenging, whether it’s the braces themselves or the need to use the elevator when all my friends automatically go for the stairs. Additionally, I have a whole cocktail of mental and learning disabilities. This isn’t uncommon; comorbidity is the norm for mental illness and learning disabilities, which is why you often see people listing out a number of disorders. Here’s my list: bipolar disorder, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and dyscalculia. I struggle with feeling self-conscious about the number of health problems I face, but there’s no need to be ashamed. Disability is actually extremely common, though we don’t talk about it like it is, and many people with disabilities have more than one. </p> 
                   <p>It’s been a huge pleasure to see disability become more prominent in our games. I feel so lucky to have worked on books like <em>Grand Bazaar</em>, where I gave my NPC, Arhan Benimaya, a service dog. Disability *is* normal, and we should treat it as such. </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Dave Nelson (he/they)</h3> 
                   <p>Hey everybody! I'm Dave Nelson and I live with a handful of disabilities, mainly autism, dyslexia/dysgraphia, and anxiety. Often these "invisible" disabilities get either swept under the rug or have their legitimacy questioned. It makes it quite the uphill battle to get recognized and taken seriously. I feel very strongly that more exposure to what folks with these disabilities are actually like and what they go through will help combat these issues. So from the very start of my writing career I have tried to champion neurodiverse causes and representation as best I can. You can find examples of my neurodiverse characters both in <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> in the form of Erikanesh, or the upcoming <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em> with Chun Hye-Seung. You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/davicthegrey">@davicthegrey</a>, talking about my experiences, games, and all other manner of things.</p>

                   <h3>Stefan “Waffles” Timmons (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, I am Stefan, better known in the TTRPG sphere as Waffles from WafflesMapleSyrup LLC. I am a disabled US Navy veteran with major depressive disorder, tinnitus, as well as other depressive contributing factors such as insomnia and chronic pain. I have battled with suicide in my life and strive to have nobody need to fight that battle alone.</p> 
                   <p>I am one of the two CEOs of WafflesMapleSyrup, who run two separate streams and podcasts. I am the GM of our Starfinder show Journeys Adrift, and I play an android magus (Arc II) in our <em>Strength of Thousands</em> show, Outcast &amp; Outclassed. TTRPGs have given me a close-knit group of friends and a significant other that keep my head up and let me strive to do better in life.</p> 
                   <p>WafflesMapleSyrup strives to reduce the stigma against mental health with our platform in TTRPGs, and because of their similar standards, love to do so with Paizo. We've participated in PaizoCon streams, Jasper's Game Day, and Paizo events, among other events with various creators since we began.</p> 
                   <p>We aim to build our platform into something large enough to have the reach necessary to reduce the stigma against mental health and show that it is okay to be different, it's okay to be disabled, and there should always be a place for everyone at the table.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Esther Wallace (she/her, zhe/zher)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi y’all, I’m Esther Wallace. I GM Chromythica, a Pathfinder 2E actual play, and I’m multiply disabled. I have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), two types of OI (osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare bone disease, and orthostatic intolerance, which mostly means I get really dizzy when I stand up), and other as-yet-undiagnosed chronic illnesses. </p> 
                   <p>My disabilities come with frequent symptoms of brain fog, intense pain, and exhaustion. I’m still learning how to navigate as a disabled person in the tabletop community. Gaming spaces are so often not constructed with disabled people in mind; for me, it makes all the difference in the world if a GM and fellow players ask me about my access needs and work with me to implement accessibility practices. As a player, this can take the shape of GMs building in time for me to move my body or encouraging me to play online games from bed or a couch. As a GM, this frequently takes the form of my players helping me recall rules on particularly bad brain fog days! </p> 
                   <p>I created the hashtags #tabletopaccess and #ttrpgaccess as a way for disabled people to discuss our experiences in tabletop, and I host periodic Twitter chats about disability and tabletop RPGs using these hashtags. Disabled people are welcome to respond to any of the prompts I’ve posted, and nondisabled people are welcome to follow along and learn! </p> 
                   <p>You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/dungeonminister">@dungeonminister</a> and catch me GMing @Chromythica on <a href="https://twitter.com/Chromythica">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZjsqJnhMtdH4Z-m_wzkz0w">YouTube</a>!</p>

                   <h3>Owen K.C. Stephens (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I’m Owen K.C. Stephens. I’ve been playing and homebrewing for TTRPGs for 39 years, been a professional game writer for 25 years, a developer for 21, and a publisher and consultant for 9. My involvement with Paizo goes back to the early days of the company putting out DragonMagazine. I wrote the original <em>Guide to Absalom</em> as a freelancer, was a Paizo developer on-staff from 2014 to 2019, am a co-creator of Starfinder, and have done regular freelance work for Paizo since I left. I am also the publisher and co-owner for Rogue Genius Games, and the <a href="https://greenroninstore.com/collections/fantasy-age">Fantasy AGE developer for Green Ronin</a>.</p> 
                   <p><b>Content Warning: Trauma, abuse, and suicidal thoughts discussed in the rest of this bio.</b></p> 
                   <p>I’m a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. I have Civilian Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (also known as Non-Combat PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder. I must be medicated and undergo psychotherapy in order to remain functional. This is much like having a broken leg and needing crutches—the crutches don’t let you act normally, but they do make it possible to get more done than you possibly could without them.</p> 
                   <p>Gaming, both game-writing and game-playing, have been a major source of therapy and the ability to build a social safety net for myself. Before I was diagnosed, without RPGs, I would not have survived high school. I know games are important—they saved my life—and believe representation is a crucial part of that.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">As we approach the end of the year, it's tradition to look back on the year that was. There are many words I could use to describe this year in Organized Play: turbulent, uncertain, hopeful...the list goes on. In some ways we have made progress from where we were last year: physical games are slowly starting up in some areas, we've got piles of new content for our players, and we've produced another full year of scenarios. By the same token, there are still many areas that haven't changed: conventions are mostly still online, and we're not sure what the future of large-scale shows will look like.</p>

                   <h2>OPC Musings</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">As we approach the end of the year, it's tradition to look back on the year that was. There are many words I could use to describe this year in Organized Play: turbulent, uncertain, hopeful...the list goes on.

                   <p>One certainty for me in all of this is the community. No matter what, you're all out there playing games, having a good time and enjoying our stories, I've got the table data to prove it. It's exciting to know that the work we're doing is bringing some joy to your lives. I hope that this holiday season (for those of you who celebrate), you're able to get together with your biological and chosen families, as appropriate, and throw some dice together. You never know, Grandma might get really into playing Kyra from the <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em>! If you're looking for some festive cheer this season, definitely check out this month's new Starfinder Society release, A <em>Festive Operation</em>; I think it'll be a staple of December schedules for the next few years.</p> 
                   <p>Does your gaming group have holiday traditions? Are you giving your GMs something special for the season? Let me know in the comments down below!</p> 
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month's digital releases, available December 15, 2021:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-307-The-Locked-Lodge">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-07: The Locked Lodge</a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02al1?Pathfinder-Bounty-17-Sodden-Stories">Pathfinder Bounty #17: Sodden Stories</a></p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aku?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-412-A-Festive-Operation">Starfinder Society Scenario #4-12: A Festive Operation</a>*</p> 
                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>For those of you who have not already noticed, the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options</a> page contains sanctioning for both <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a>! These two books had a lot of tricky elements, especially <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, and we're thankful for your patience while we sorted through them. I'd especially like to thank Linda Zayas-Palmer and Mark Seifter for spending a <em>lot</em> of time with me in the week before Thanksgiving working to get them out before the holiday, Pathfinders, go forth and enjoy your new content!</p> 
                   <p>For my fellow Starfinders, we've also sanctioned the most recent standalone adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xs?Starfinder-Adventure-The-Liberation-of-Locus1"><em>The Liberation of Locus-1</em></a>, for credit, and its rules options are also available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. We hope you enjoy this new adventure!</p> 
                   <p>Looking forward, there are two Pathfinder rulebooks coming out in December: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aoy?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth"><em>Lost Omens: Monsters of Myth</em></a> and the long-awaited <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>. We hope to have the sanctioning for both of these ready for street date; they're a pretty light lift, so I'm very hopeful. On the Adventures front, we're also starting to work through the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</em></a>, and hope to have more to share on that soon.</p> 
                   <h2>Nova Update</h2> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shfs?Nova-Qualifications-Update">Last year, we announced</a> that we’d be adding one high-level scenario per year to the qualifying scenarios for Nova credit. We intended for this to be our end-of-year scenario each year; however, in looking at the plan for this year, the final scenario of the Data Scourge metaplot is (spoilers!) a 5-8, which is not quite high enough level to qualify for our requirements. As a result, we are adding the Nova tag to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><b><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></b></a>. All previous and future runs (up to three) of this scenario will count towards the 10-scenario requirement for Nova qualification. Thanks to the VOs who pointed out this potential snag to me!</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p></p> 
                   <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                   <h4>Campaign Service Coins</h4> 
                   <p>At SkålCon at the end of October, we awarded two new Campaign Service Coins. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Aerine Caerwyn</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #850<br> <b>Sean Pearson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #851</p> 
                   <p>It also came to my attention that we never formally announced the two recipients from last year’s SkålCon Online, so I would like to formally recognize:<br> <b>James Anderson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #840<br> <b>Tineke Bolleman</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #841</p> 
                   <h4>GM Ranks</h4> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their fifth star for Pathfinder Society (first edition), and one GM earned their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star</b>: Idaho, Joshua Blazej<br> <b>5th Nova</b>: Hilary Moon Murphy</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com .</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the holiday season!</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>You can also try the game directly on Tabletop Simulator on Steam. You need to have Tabletop installed, then <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663893091">go to download the Pathfinder Arena demo</a> to add it to your games. Then run Tabletop Simulator and start fighting with your friends in the Arena! You can find a fast guide to the main Tabletop Simulator <a href="https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/player-guides/basic-controls/">features here</a>. We have uploaded the rulebook, plus the summary cards. You will also find the ability tokens already in the bag, according to the number of players at the table. Mind that you will need to add the extra strength tokens according to the number of players.</p> 
                   <p><b>Backers who now join the campaign</b> already get Amiri, the barbarian, as an extra hero to play with, plus four extra monsters: the hobgoblin general (level 3), the ghoul (level 1), the young red dragon (level 4), and the onidoshi (level 4). </p> 
                   <p>The onidoshi can increase its total life points by 2 (as does the troll), and <b>it deals a strong damage output in both range and melee.</b> It’s also able to attack heroes twice if they’re in the range of both attacks (as does the ettin).</p> 
                   <p>The young red dragon is a fearsome opponent that can <b>attack at 360 degrees and ignore heroes’ defenses!</b> Players would be wise to plan very carefully when to strike against it!</p> 
                   <p>The hobgoblin general brings a new special ability to the game: when it deals critical damage, <b>the targeted hero is pushed up to two tiles away</b>. This effect can lead the opponents into other monsters' range to trigger even more attacks and score more glory points!</p> 
                   <p><b>The ghoul’s only attack is a melee attack, but it has the special ability to lower the number of your action points</b> and defense through negative tokens. This is particularly effective at the beginning of the game, when every hero has only 4 actions per turn.</p> 
                   <p>A custom 8-face die has also been unlocked, along with three extra cards per each hero’s deck, including expansions and unlocked stretch goals!</p> 
                   <p><b>Seelah is also waiting in the next stretch goal</b>. As soon as she’s unlocked, she will immediately get 3 extra cards too!</p> 
                   <p>We are also releasing three social stretch goals: like and follow the game on Board Game Geek to get new Shrine Tiles dedicated to Brigh, Nethys, Calistria, and Pharasma. Brigh allows you to rotate other tiles than the one your hero stands on; Nethys enhances your magic abilities, giving you an extra spell; Calistria rewards monster-hunter heroes with ability tokens; and Pharasma adds glory points if the hero has defeated a certain number of monsters at the end of the game.</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/326030/pathfinder-arena">Like and follow Pathfinder Arena on Board Game Geek to unlock them now!</a></p> 
                   <p>The other two social stretch goals concern our Facebook group. Invite new members or join it now to unlock another extra card for each hero and the miniature of the harpy, a new level-2 monster!</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/403722200813208/members">Join our Facebook Group to unlock them!</a></p>

                   <p>These print-on-demand versions differ from the originals only in that the inside covers have been printed as additional pages in the books’ interiors (and that some are now available as softcovers for the first time), and they will easily fill out gaps in any collector’s bookshelf.</p> 
                   <p>We have more titles in the works and will keep adding more as long as folks keep buying the ones we’ve got. Make sure to let us know in the comments what out-of-print titles you most want to see available as print-on-demand offerings, and we’ll set our priorities accordingly.</p>

                   <p><b>Cosmic Crittercon 4, April 23-25</b><br> The Crittermanders raised $6,789, a very pleasing and orderly sum, for Doctors Without Borders in their fourth annual charity event. They also had cookies!</p> 
                   <p><b>Con-Current 2021, June 11-13</b><br> With charity boons, embroidered items, and rerolls, the Ohio Organized Play community raised $5,295 for Planned Parenthood and Jasper’s Game Day.</p> 
                   <p><b>Defenders of the Healing Flame, August 21 &amp; November 6</b><br> With two charity streams and many shenanigans, the team raised $6,420 and threw one glitterbomb at the OPC.</p> 
                   <p><b>Gen Con Online, September 16-19</b><br> Gen Con auctioned off boons, signed books and embroidered items to support Take This and Trinity House, raising a total of $5,886!</p> 
                   <p><b>SkålCon 2021, October 29-31, Plymouth MN</b><br> In celebration of their first physical con since the pandemic began, the community raised $4,750 for Tubman, a local shelter, and collected physical goods to donate as well.</p> 
                   <p><b>PF2e Foundry Community for Extra Life 2021, November 6th</b><br> The Foundry developers’ streamed game on their platform raised $3,567 for Extra Life.</p> 
                   <p><b>Mace 2021, November 12-14, Charlotte NC</b><br> The North Carolina community came out and raised $2,800 for the North Carolina Zoo and $3,000 for Veteran’s Bridge Home.</p> 
                   <p>If we missed your event or you want to promote an upcoming charity event, please let us know in the comments! We know there are charity events year-round that deserve the attention.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time, Explore! Report! Cooperate! and eat some pie for me!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“I don’t like the look of that <em>sloop</em>,” said Daker, punctuating the last word with his ever-present sneer.</p> 
                   <p>Callum extended his spyglass and directed it at the little vessel, a little less than two hundred feet to port. Its crew scurried about their duties as the sun reached for the golden edge of the western horizon.</p> 
                   <p>“A fisherman,” said Callum, still scanning the deck of the other vessel, “returning home. Not everyone’s a pirate, Gaius.”</p> 
                   <p>“We’re in the Shackles, Orrin,” answered Daker, still sneering at the smaller ship. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re all pirates, ‘til they prove otherwise.”</p> 
                   <p>They had the poopdeck of the <em>Madam Diabola</em> to themselves, a sleek Chelish warship armed with the latest in cannon technology, each devil-mouthed barrel etched with a magic sigil which promised every shot they fired would fly deadly and true. The <em>Madam</em> was given the honor of watching this insignificant settlement’s harbor while Admiral Lecarnas and the rest of the punitive fleet sailed off to lay siege to Drenchport that very morning. Callum didn’t even know the town’s name, but he also didn’t care.</p> 
                   <p>“I grant you, she’s a bold one,” Callum answered, watching as the sloop slowly moved in their direction. “Must’ve sailed out early morning, before we sealed the harbor. We could just warn her off with a hazard flag.”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius Daker was too bloodthirsty in Callum’s opinion, even if he was his oldest friend from his Fort Gorthoklek days. Too enthusiastic with the sap when leading a press gang, too ready to—</p> 
                   <p>“Fire a bit of iron across her bow with that pretty new swivel gun,” said Daker, eyeing the polished little cannon mounted on the port rail. “And beat to quarters. Lads and ladies need a bit of exercise, to keep ‘em on their toes.”</p> 
                   <p><em>Madam Diabola</em> was one of three vessels in the fleet outfitted with the new weapons, swivel guns similar to smaller versions of the black iron cannons on the decks below, tended by scurrying halfling prisoners the crew had taken to calling “powder rats.” Gaius Daker wanted to hear the cannon roar. Callum thought such impulse foolish. Would the captain approve of such actions?</p> 
                   <p>“Gaius,” began Callum, but swallowed the rest of his words when he caught Daker’s glare. He knew that look well. Daker was senior midshipman of the watch, and his words were no mere suggestion. That dark look made it an order.</p> 
                   <p>“Beat to quarters!” Callum shouted, turning to the swivel gun.</p> 
                   <p>Sailors across the vessel leapt into action and the sound of martial drums filled the air. Callum couldn’t help but admire the artistry of the little bronze cannon, mounted on the gunwale, its mouth fashioned like a dragon’s maw, fangs bent outward. He checked the breech, pleased to find it properly loaded and ready. Captain Hecata was fond of the lash, and her newly trained gun crews knew this better than most. They tended Madam’s newfangled weapons of war well, out of fear if not pride.</p> 
                   <p>The sloop was much closer now, turning to port so that it showed Madam her broad side. Callum, ready at the gunwale, turned to look at Gaius Daker, who he caught tugging at his officer’s jacket to sharpen the lines of his uniform.</p> 
                   <p>“They’re giving us a fat target, Gaius,” Callum said, a bit of pleading in his voice. “Maybe a signal flag’ll do the trick.”</p> 
                   <p>“A signal flag, Mister Callum?” came the lilting alto of Captain Hecata as she climbed up onto the poopdeck. “Perhaps I should prepare tea for these Shackles scum while you wave silk at them? What have we here, Mister Daker?”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius, eyes alight with bloodlust and just plan lust, grinned at the captain and saluted. </p> 
                   <p>“Suspicious vessel off the port, Captain! I ordered Midshipman Callum to fire a warning shot across her bow!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum grimaced. Just like Gaius to throw him overboard if it made him shine a bit brighter in Hecata’s emerald eyes. Daker offered the captain his spyglass and she took it, rewarding him with one of her unreadable smiles that could as easily portend divine preferment as utter doom. She looked through Daker’s brass device and within a heartbeat repeated the midshipman’s order.</p> 
                   <p>“Mister Callum, fire that shot. And I wouldn’t be cross with you if that shot puts a crimson part in someone’s hair.”</p> 
                   <p>Callum nodded and turned the swivel gun in the direction the sloop’s starboard bow. He angled the shot as low as he dared—Hecata might not care if he took off some poor bastard’s head, but he did. He asked a blessing from Abadar and fired the cannon. The shot ripped a hole low in the sloop’s staysail and a cry of fear washed across the space between the vessels, announcing the sloop crew’s shock.</p> 
                   <p>A woman in a long coat came to the starboard rail of the sloop, waving both arms frantically.</p> 
                   <p>“Ahoy, Chelish warship!” the woman cried, long brown locks freed as she added her hat to her call for mercy. “We’re honest fishermen, bringing a bellyful to our little island! See how low we ride?”</p> 
                   <p>Callum noted the ship was indeed running awfully low in the water.</p> 
                   <p>“You feed pirates then?” shouted Captain Hecata with a contemptuous air, hands on her hips.</p> 
                   <p>“Nay! Settlers, eking out a life in these hard islands! Shelly is a free port, and we give no allegiance to any pirate lord!”</p> 
                   <p>“Our intelligence says otherwise,” said the captain, and Callum saw she wore that same smile she had given to Gaius. Those fishermen had best say their prayers. It was clear now where this encounter was headed.</p> 
                   <p>Callum joined the naval academy in Hinji when it became clear his mercurial father would favor his younger brother when the inheritance was doled out. He had been fed tales of high adventure on the open seas, contending with the elements and wild creatures, bloodthirsty pirates and rebels intent on bringing Cheliax to its knees. Instead, he found himself part of an instrument of intimidation. Well-armed nautical bullies.</p> 
                   <p>“There are a dozen innocent souls on this ship, captain!” the brown-haired mariner in the sloop called out across the water. “We bring back the bounty of the sea to feed hungry bellies. Men, women, and children. No more, no less. I beg you let us pass!”</p> 
                   <p>The woman’s last words were made with hands clasped together, as if offering up a prayer.</p> 
                   <p>“Prepare to be boarded,” sang Captain Hecata, drawing her cutlass and nodding to Midshipman Daker, who wore a giddy grin on his face.</p> 
                   <p>Callum looked back at the sloop, the long-haired fisherwoman, hands still clasped like a supplicant…and then his eyes caught a shimmer, as though he looked at a painting behind glass, tilted to catch the sun’s rays. A warning tingled at the base of his spine. He turned to share his misgivings with the captain, when the unmistakable sound of a cannon report, several in fact, sent him instinctively to the deck, prostrate with his arms cradling his head. The first ball struck the portside railing on the quarterdeck below, obliterating wood and sending deadly splinters in all directions. The second tore through Gaius Daker, reducing him to an ugly spray of red.</p> 
                   <p>In the next moment Callum was helping the captain up from the deck, one side of her smart Chelish uniform painted with Daker’s blood. </p> 
                   <p>“Return fire!” she roared, shaking off Callum’s assistance. “By all the tines in Hell, that’s no bloody fisherman!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum glanced to his left—the sloop was gone. In its place was a black-sailed brigantine, the iron mouths of cannon protruding from open gun ports, its main deck alive with surly-looking sailors brandishing weapons.</p>

                   <p><em>Pirates!</em> he thought as <em>Madam Diabola’s</em> new guns answered the brigantine’s attack. But it was as if the wind took the iron hurled at their enemy away like fallen leaves. Of its sixteen guns, only a single cannonball connected with their chameleon foe. What sorcery did these brigands have at their disposal? Illusion to disguise a warship? Elemental servants to carry away iron shot? </p> 
                   <p>It was then that Callum caught sight of the brown-haired woman again. He could swear she was smiling at him directly, and as if to confirm it, she gave him a jovial wave and held her hands up to her mouth to trumpet her words across the now-smoky distance.</p> 
                   <p>“Welcome to the Shackles!” she cried.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p><b>Moderator: I understand Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Pandemonium Warehouse is releasing its first ever premium Box edition of a Pathfinder Release. Why <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens?</em></b></p> 
                   <p>Donk: Absalom is THE iconic city in Golarion. Plus there’s danger lurking around every corner, so lots of opportunity to make the characters’ lives miserable.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Pre-sales of the Gold Edition begin on Black Friday, with 10% off to anyone who orders by Nov 28th. Did you have any say in that?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Product doesn’t really talk to marketing. There’s a high wall, three moats, and pit traps filled with trolls between us and the marketing department. Our intradepartmental memos are stuffed in the mouths of junior VPs who are exchanged via catapult nightly. That said, I don’t disapprove. </p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’ve heard the Gold Edition comes with NPC cards that can hang on the GM screen, with artwork on the front for players and roleplaying info on the back for the GM. What kinds of NPCs might we expect?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: You’ll see all the most interesting denizens of Absalom: noble goblins, brave goblins, handsome goblins and brilliant goblins. Probably some other things, too, but I really haven’t checked.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3ace3216-8c8a-4a16-880d-bb48c6b1bff8/BG_Absalom-mockup-cards-Location.jpg"><img style="max-width:70%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3ace3216-8c8a-4a16-880d-bb48c6b1bff8/BG_Absalom-mockup-cards-Location.jpg" alt="Absalom building mock up cards with art on one side and information on the other"></a>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p><b>M: It also comes with location cards. Artwork of the building or location on front, background information on the back. We’ve never seen that before from the Warehouse. Why now?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Locations cards really help you understand where you are at all times. If you’re a member of the Pathfinder Society, that’s great for their motto of “Explore, Report, Cooperate”. And if you’re a member of the Bloody Barbers, it’s perfect for their motto of, “Bury the bodies further from the house.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’m surprised a goblin would come up with wearable faction jewelry for players. What was your inspiration?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: We take special pride in our jewelry pieces. They’re designed by our crack jewelry designers, and lovingly crafted from the fillings ripped out of the teeth of marketing goblin project coordinators. Reduce, reuse, recycle, but without the reduce part—we call that “maximizing operational efficiency.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I see. So, you included several short bonus adventures in this Gold Edition. How do you expect GMs to use these?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Our original design mandate for the bonus encounters was that they would be a short, sharp way to terrorize an adventuring party, complete with large battle maps to mark where the characters fell.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Oh, so you also include large battle maps? </b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Battles are more fun if you know where you are and what’s around you. After all, the difference in a five foot square is sometimes the difference between living to fight another day and your fellow party members looting your corpse.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: There’s quite a bit more that will come in the box that I saw on <a href="https://www.beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom">beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom</a>. How would you rate your website goblins?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: In general, our website goblins aren’t worth the cost of the oil to boil them. On the rare occasion that they actually manage to make the website work properly, we hold a party with floats and cake.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Any last quote you’d like to leave our readers with? Words of wisdom?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: If you open your windows after sundown, and if the wind is blowing just right, you can hear the screams of the mighty warehouse engines coming to life. They’re ready—nay, eager—to build something great for the Pathfinder audience, and I think the product department has really knocked it out of the park. Assuming the website goblins can keep the site up and the marketing department doesn’t go berserk and start handing the boxes out with happy meals, we should be in for a good ride.</p>

                   <p>In Pathfinder Arena you will take the role of one of the iconic heroes of Pathfinder, trapped in a magical entity, calling itself “Arena”.

                   <p>Players can modify the Arena structure by spending action points to push or rotate the tiles. By doing so, players can move opponents into a monster’s range and trigger an attack to score as many points as the damage the monsters inflict.</p>

                   </table> 
                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b>We tried something a little different from the conventional spellcaster model with the psychic’s lower number of spell slots and strong focus on …focus... cantrips, amps, and other special powers, with conventional slotted spells filling a more supplemental role. The overwhelming majority of you responded that you preferred this approach over a conventional spellcaster approach; however, much of the feedback also indicated that while what the psychic got in exchange for this reduced spell loadout was very interesting, it didn’t feel powerful or useful enough to make up for the difference in lost spell slots. So, a major direction of change for the psychic will be to retain the “fewer spell slots” and “cantrip/amp focus” class role, but adjust the power level of the supplemental pieces so that you can truly feel like you’ve unleashed the awesome power of your mind. I’ll get into some of the approaches we’re taking in each point below.</p> 
                   <p>We also wanted to get a sense in the playtest of what you all thought of the general tone and genre of the class. This was pretty conclusive—over two-thirds of respondents said the more magical cast was working for them, so we’ll be staying the course here as well!</p> 
                   <p><b>Spells and Spellcasting:</b> A strong majority of respondents stated that they preferred the playtest arrangement of the psychic’s spellcasting and key ability scores, so we’ll be sticking to those and keeping the psychic as a spontaneous occult spellcaster whose subconscious mind gives them a thematic choice of key ability score between Intelligence and Charisma.</p> 
                   <p>I also want to call out that, as with past spellcaster playtests, the specific spells granted on the conscious minds drew only on spells we had already published, so some needed to be chosen for role (“a damaging spell here” or “a scouting spell here”) and easy understandability even if they were a little outside the theme—for instance, <em>magic missile</em> was a stand-in for a more on-theme damaging level 1 spell on the distant grasp psychic. The final <em>Dark Archive</em> book will introduce several new spells with the psychic in mind for thematically tighter granted spells!</p> 
                   <p><b>Psyche:</b> The ability to unleash your psyche to amp spells for free was originally intended to let psychics really feel like they got to be masters of focus by cheating the Focus Point caps. However, the fact that psychics had almost unlimited Focus Points took up a lot of the power budget for the class, rippling into the psyches needing to come online later and have both benefits and drawbacks, as well as affecting the power of amps (which I'll touch on next). Therefore, one of the biggest changes we’ll be making to psychic is to remove this aspect of Unleash Psyche, and then redistribute that power through the rest of the class for a more consistent play experience. </p> 
                   <p>Consistent feedback also showed that while psyches were interesting when unleashed, most combats didn’t last long enough after the third turn to make getting into the psyche feel worthwhile (meaning that much of the psychic’s power was tied up in a feature they had inconsistent access to). While we don’t want to make Unleash Psyche an “assumed first-turn action” in the vein of Rage, Hunt Prey, or similar, we do want to make it easier to do. Thankfully, with the removal of psyche’s role as a source of unlimited Focus Points, we have a lot of options for making it more accessible, as well as for adding more punch, such as effects that happen when your first Unleash your Psyche, more special abilities that happen automatically when you are unleashed, or the ability to end your psyche earlier for a single big benefit.</p> 
                   <p><b>Amps:</b> Amps are one of the major parts of the psychic, and most respondents stated that they found these options very interesting—Mark tells me that amps scored among the highest for “interesting” of any class we’ve playtested—but also that they felt weak in comparison to normal focus spells. They were! Since Unleash Psyche meant that you could amp your focus cantrips 5 or more times in a single combat, as opposed to a hard maximum of 3, those amps needed to be a little under the balance point of spells like <em>fire ray</em>. While psychics will retain their focus on amps, they likely won’t have such an outsized number of them, so we have plenty of room to now bring the power scale of amps back up.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Stuff!:</b> Of course, we always increase the number of options between the playtest and the final class! In addition to the new spells that will be added in Dark Archive, the psychic will of course be gaining new feats and choices of both conscious and subconscious minds. In honor of our new iconic psychic, Thaleon, I’ll share his conscious mind, which is called the tangible dream. This path focuses on materializing and projecting the user’s thoughts into the physical world, allowing you to conjure walls, blades, and other constructs of force (or astral thread, or ectoplasm, as your character concept fits) around the battlefield!</p> 
                   <p>I’m getting a vision… It’s… of Mark, talking about the thaumaturge!</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the thaumaturge class. I first want to thank you all for participating in the playtest by running and playing games, posting your playtest results and analysis, answering surveys, and having good discussions! In particular, the playtest was happening during a pretty challenging period for us at Paizo, and I appreciate how all of you in the playtest stepped up your game compared to earlier playtests with extremely civil discourse, keeping repetitive points to a minimum so I could keep up with all the new ideas, and just really engaging with each other’s ideas and feelings in good faith to talk about different directions. </p> 
                   <p>Overall, people really liked the thaumaturge, with a strong good feeling from the majority of players, but there were definitely some areas where it needed tweaking or rethinking, usually in a way that didn’t detract much for most playtesters but did in a big way for a small number of them. This left the thaumaturge in an interesting situation, with about as many people who were about as many huge fans of the class as the highest-ranking class we’ve ever playtested, but then that small number with especially low rankings. The great news about that is that it left a clear path forward. </p> 
                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b> The one thing I wasn’t sure about was whether playtesters would like our new vision of the thaumaturge or would prefer something more similar to the first edition occultist. What I discovered is that you really like the martial thaumaturge concept, by an overwhelming majority, and want it to remain a magpie picking up from all four traditions. However, there was a desire to make it clearer how the class fantasy works with respect to exerting your force of personality to convince the universe, as well as to add more capacity to the class’s skills so that Charisma-based skills are front and center to match the intro lore about being persuasive. The changes to Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws (see below) may help with this as well to allow better advantage of your Charisma key ability score, while freeing up a broader variety of character concepts—this will let players freely choose whether to lean more heavily on magical learning or more on making things up as you go along as best fits the character. We’ll also be making a variety of quality-of-life changes based on other playtester proposals.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Implements:</b> As the playtest mentioned, we’ll be adding up to nine implements (three each granting active, reactive, and passive abilities). Of the four new implements, one of them will be the tome (or a ledger, notebook, or similar object), a passive implement that mysteriously writes down information about everything around you to assist you. The other implements are one to let you inspire and lead your allies, one to debuff your enemies, and one that misleads your enemies’ attacks, but I’ll leave it up to you to figure out what implements those might be!</p> 
                   <p><b>Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws:</b> One thing I’ve learned from these playtests is that our playtesters tend to be our most dedicated and experienced players (and even if you’re new to Pathfinder, you are very experienced with tabletop RPGs in general). So, whenever even our most experienced playtesters think a mechanic is complicated, I think I should take another look at that. People loved the benefits for these abilities but thought they were complex, and that they sometimes had issues being tied directly to Recall Knowledge. Our plan is to disentangle Esoteric Antithesis from Recall Knowledge (with a feat, like investigators’, to pick up a free Recall Knowledge if you want that), instead just flat-out forcing your will on the universe with a check to establish a connection (I’m thinking a name like “Forge Connection”). One consequence of this is that even on a failure, you can forge a connection, but a success or critical success will give you more. Additionally, while a high majority of players really liked the playtest benefit from Esoteric Antithesis, there were some good ideas about how to open up to allow a variety of benefits to allow for more playstyles. So, we’re looking at offering multiple benefits a thaumaturge can pick from when you successfully forge a connection. This separates out the benefit where you apply a creature’s highest weakness and the benefit where you create a new weakness as two options, to handle the feedback people gave about situations where they were already applying a creature’s highest weakness due to preparation for the encounter. It also allows you to gain new benefits, for instance, when you might prefer a special buff or debuff instead of simply more damage. Right now, we’re toying with the idea of having a different connection for each implement, as some folks also thought implements could use one more unique power, and then have more connections available through feats</p> 
                   <p><b>Pacts:</b> People loved the story of the pacts—in fact, they wanted them to have stronger effects, and many wanted the option for any character, even non-thaumaturges, to gain them. We had actually planned on including similar pacts in a yet-unannounced part of the book, but based on your feedback, we also expanded the pacts into a full-on pact binder archetype for anyone to take! Opinions were pretty varied about their rarity, perhaps the most mixed we’ve ever gotten in a multiple choice question for paths moving forward, so we’ll take that into account moving forward.</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <h2>A Glimpse, A Hunch, A Flicker of the Future:</h2> 
                   <p>Hey, thanks for sticking around! Here’s something coming up in <em>Dark Archive</em>—while the book is still in development and various things might change a little, I wanted to give a sneak peek into a new type of player option coming up in the cryptids file, one of the eight casefiles of the <em>Dark ArchiveM</em>.</p> 
                   <h3>Creature Echo Feats</h3> 
                   <p>Creature echoes are a new type of feat that grant you special powers based on exposure to an unusual creature. These are rare and usually only occur after a significant event involving the creature. Imagine a town where people have, one by one, begun to turn to stone. You might spend many months tracking down the cause of the phenomena, only to eventually find it was an ancient creature with a petrifying gaze living deep under the town. However your encounter with the creature goes, the following feat might echo with you if you survive:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><b>Stone Skin — Feat 12</b><br> Rare, Transmutation<br> <b>Prerequisites</b> You have been petrified.</p> 
                    <p>It might have been a medusa, dracolisk, or even a fossil golem; regardless of the source, you were the target of some petrifying effect, and an element of that stony gaze has remained with you, both protecting and slowly consuming you. Your limbs are coated with a layer of stone that rests atop your skin. You gain a stone fist unarmed attack which deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage, has the shove trait, and is in the brawling weapon group; unlike a normal fist, it does not have the agile or finesse traits. As your life force ebbs, this petrification spreads over more of your body to form a stony armor. When you have fewer than half your maximum Hit Points, your stone fist unarmed attack increases its weapon damage die from 1d8 to 1d10 and you gain resistance to physical damage equal to your Constitution modifier. </p> 
                    <p>If you would gain the dying condition, you can choose to instead be permanently petrified to avoid the risk of death. Counteracting this petrification requires a casting of <em>stone to flesh</em> of a spell level equal to at least half your level, as well as a counteract check against the hard DC for your level. Each time you recover from petrification caused in this way, you gain a new scar on your skin in the shape of a long, thin crack.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>When asked about his history with producing fantasy art like the imagery featured in these two puzzles, Reynolds said, “I have been working in the RPG industry for almost 30 years, with my first piece of art being featured in 1993.</p> 
                   <p>“I was working with Paizo when they took over Dragon and Dungeon Magazines,” Reynolds explained. “I was doing some cover art for them, so when they started Pathfinder, I was one of the first people they approached about providing art for the game.</p> 
                   <p>“It is exciting to be able to work on something from the ground level. My experience with Pathfinder has been massively enjoyable. I just love everything about that sort of world.”</p> 
                   <p>When asked about what pieces of art his personal favorites are to create, Reynolds said, “Mainly the iconic characters, as my specialty is in character design. I love being able to tie history to fantasy, and I always do a lot of historical research before beginning work on that type of a project.”</p> 
                   <p>Speaking specifically about his art being used to create jigsaw puzzle products, as well as how he thinks he’d fare putting them together himself, Reynolds said, “I like doing jigsaw puzzles. They are relaxing, and I think they also make for a good exercise as an artist. I am probably the wrong person to do a puzzle featuring my own artwork, though, because I already know the image so well.</p> 
                   <p>“I imagine it would be sort of like a musician dancing to their own music,” Reynolds added.</p> 
                   <p>Fans of Pathfinder, Wayne Reynolds, and fantasy art in general have made these jigsaw puzzle items two of Toy Vault’s most popular new offerings this year, and it is with great excitement that we announce two more brand new puzzles featuring Pathfinder imagery—<em>Gamemastery Guide and Gods &amp; Magic.</em></p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0294z?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gamemastery-Guide">Gamemastery Guide</a></em> once again showcases a wonderful piece of Reynolds art, this time depicting Alaznist, one of the game’s villains, ascending a staircase while holding onto an impressive-looking spear-type weapon in one hand. Towering above her is a large black dragon with giant horns, red eyes, and wings extended.</p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02950?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gods-Magic">Gods &amp; Magic</a></em> features work by the talented Russian artist Ekaterina Burmak. The scene depicts the Starstone near the top, with three characters below. These three characters are Cayden Cailean, Iomedae, and Norgorber, all of whom ascended to godhood after touching the Starstone, according to official Pathfinder lore.</p> 
                   <p>These two all-new Pathfinder puzzles are available now, just in time for the 2021 holiday season. For more information on Toy Vault, please visit <a href="http://www.toyvault.com/" target="_blank">www.toyvault.com</a>.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“Please, Dhareen, must we go through with this? A bit of rock climbing is hardly a challenge for the Castrovel Kid!” Dhareen imagined her mentee thrusting his chest out proudly, thumb pressed triumphantly above his heart as he blustered several feet below her. She smiled to herself and pushed her piston-puncher into the mountain’s side, activating the gadget with a press of her lowleft thumb.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps, but it is custom among the tribes for a Yavnii to administer a test to every hopeful Brekai wanting to undergo the Test of the Mountain, and I am afraid that not even I have the authority to make exceptions to shobhad tradition. Not even for the ‘Castrovel Kid.’”</p> 
                   <p>“See, you say that, but I can hear your grin,” Vellero replied sullenly.</p> 
                   <p>“I know not what you mean.” Dhareen grinned again.</p> 
                   <p>Both gladiators fell silent as they climbed, Dhareen pausing her ascent long enough for Vellero to scale up alongside her.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>He had taken to her tutelage well. Ka’s cliffside was grueling even for an expert; twenty-two miles long and comprised of thin basalt overtop stronger metamorphic stone, careless climbers often plummeted to their deaths after relying on pistons pounded into brittle basalt. One of the many roles of a yavnii was to ensure their breknai did not succumb to such a fate. Vellero had learned Dhareen’s lessons well thus far, scaling around several patches of basalt she had left in his path as a test.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s concentration reminded Dhareen of when she first met the headstrong lashunta in the ring at Arl’s VitariTech Coliseum. They were competing in the Icons Grand Brawl, and he was favored to win. The young man was a crowd pleaser on a seven-match winning streak. He was good, but not good enough; Dhareen scrubbed the floor with her future friend’s face. Literally. Nevertheless, there had been a spark within Vellero, a spark that intrigued her. The second time she knocked him down—or perhaps the third—he clamored to his feet with a bruised antenna and a few chipped teeth, wiped fresh blood from his lip, and grinned.</p> 
                   <p>“Why do you persist?” Dhareen had asked, scarcely winded. “You cannot win. You bring yourself only pain. Throw your towel; others have when facing me. There is no shame in surrendering to your better.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re right,” he’d replied. “But that wouldn’t be fair for the folks who came here to see me fight, and I don’t want to let a single person in this ring who believed that I could win down.” He raised his fists into a boxer’s stance, a pointless gesture against an opponent twice his size with twice as many fists. “When I go down, I want them to know I gave it my all!”</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“I don’t mean to sound indignant,” Vellero interrupted Dhareen’s thoughts. “I know that the Test of the Mountain is sacred to your people, and that it is an honor to be allowed to undergo it as an outsider.” </p> 
                   <p>Dhareen raised an eyebrow. “But?”</p> 
                   <p>“But,” Vellero took a breath. “Is the reason we’re doing this,” Vellero gestured out behind them, over red dunes and rolling clouds of dust. “Because you don’t think I can?”</p> 
                   <p>“If I didn’t think you could pass the Test of the Mountain, I wouldn’t have begun the climb with you, nor permitted you to undertake it.” Dhareen’s voice was gentle but her statement absolute. “The mountain is sacred to my people. We do not tolerate bloodshed on Ka. To send one who is unprepared up the Mountain is as shameful as slaying one’s enemies at its base.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s expression softened slightly. “Thanks.”</p> 
                   <p>“Do not speak of it. You don’t want your throat to dry from the ascent.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero blinked, then burst out laughing.</p> 
                   <p>“I don’t understand what you find so funny about that. You’ll have twenty miles left when we’ve reached the end of our shared path.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero kept laughing for a minute, wiping tears from his eyes. “Thanks, Dhareen.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re—”</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-<b>KUN.</b></em></p>

                    <h3>Dhareen reaches for a falling Vellero in this illustration by Victor Manuel Leza Moreno from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Starfinder: Galaxy Exploration Manual.</a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Dhareen gave herself no time for thinking. Before the sound of shattering basalt reached her ears, before Ka itself folded like a withered tumblefern in a windstorm, she whipped around to where Vellero was climbing even as his cliffside shifted downward, a cascade of metamorphic stone tearing free from Ka and tumbling towards the ground below. Vellero screamed as he fell, but Dhareen plucked him from the air like a corpseheron snatching a leaping spookfish out from the Irkonian Sea. Dhareen didn’t speak Ysoki, but she had spent enough time around ratfolk gladiators at VitariTech to recognize the lashunta lambasting the situation with at least six of the fourteen different Ysoki swears that she knew.</p> 
                   <p>“Hold on, Vellero!” Climbing down wasn’t an option; a rockslide was eminent, and the best place to be during a rockslide was above it. Vellero was much smaller than she and less experienced at climbing, he would only slow them down. She could climbe faster with all four of her muscled arms free, anyway. There was only one option remaining. </p> 
                   <p>Hoisting the Castrovel Kid onto her shoulders like a mother giving a youngling a backride, she placed the much smaller lashunta onto her shoulders and started climbing as fast as she could, giving only the barest of warnings. “Hold tight!”</p> 
                   <p>Though Dhareen could hear Vellero shouting, her intense focus and the earsplitting sounds of portions of the rock wall sloughing off afforded her no opportunity to comprehend him. She climbed as quick as her body would allow, muscles aching and flaring as she abandoned her piston-punch and climbed barehanded. She knew full-well that the smallest mistake would send both she and her friend to their doom.</p> 
                   <p>Ten yards from the top.</p> 
                   <p>Five.</p> 
                   <p>She was going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>She and Vellero were going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>Then her world shook as shadow overtook her vision. A boulder dislodged from above, tumbling towards her, threatening to crack her skull and send Dhareen and her breknai tumbling miles to their death. She refused to close her eyes; she would greet the Lady of Graves with firsthand tales of how she died. She was not alone; at the peak of her vision, she saw a small lashunta arm, no bigger than that of a shobhad child’s, reach out as if to catch the boulder. Dhareen admired Vellero’s bravery one last time.</p> 
                   <p>The boulder collided with Vellero, and for a moment it was like watching a diver plunge into a serene pool. Vellero’s hand, then his arm, and then both their bodies plunged into the boulder. </p> 
                   <p><em>Was it just an illusion?</em></p> 
                   <p>Fine dust covered Dhareen as the boulder passed through her. From within, she watched the metamorphic rock splinter and crack in flight, first into smaller boulders, then into stone and pebbles, and finally into dust. The boulder never touched them; it dissolved before it even struck the Castrovel Kid’s hand.</p> 
                   <p>Dhareen was stunned at first. But with safety just a few yards above and Ka continuing to shake and splinter, the feeling passed quickly as she bellowed at her peculiar friend.</p> 
                   <p>“That, Vellero! Keep doing that!”</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">On the occasion of Transgender Awareness Week, we at Paizo want to reaffirm our support for our transgender colleagues, creators, and community members. We recognize that we've not always been there for our trans community members. While things are rough now, we as a company are dedicated to improving and providing a safe space for all gamers—especially trans gamers—to play, create, and be part of a thriving community where they are not only welcomed but celebrated.</p> 
                   <p>We felt that this year, we shouldn’t place additional emotional labor upon our trans staff, creators, and community to contribute to a blog for Trangender Awareness Week. Rather, we wanted to address the issue of transphobia on our forums.</p> 
                   <p>Many members of the community have noted a high amount of homophobic and transphobic posts recently. Let us be clear: these hateful posts are not okay under any circumstances, and those who make them will be faced with <b>permanent suspension</b> from the forums. Though our customer service department is doing their best to keep watch and address moderation flags, it’s clear that the volume of moderation needed on the forums in the last few months has meant that the team sometimes takes more time than usual to moderate a thread. </p> 
                   <p>Transphobia is serious and removing it from the forums should take precedence over other more routine moderation tasks. Therefore, if you need to report transphobia on the forums, please don’t hesitate to contact customer service directly by email at customer.service@paizo.com with INTOLERANCE in the subject line. Any such hate will be dealt with swiftly and incur a permanent suspension.</p> 
                   <p>While we realize that combatting discrimination is an ongoing process and this is only a small step, we hope that it can begin to make our community forums a place where all members of our community feel welcome, and more importantly, safe.</p> 
                   <p>Thank you to our trans community members and other allies who have pushed us to be better recently. We hear you, we value you, and we will continue to improve ourselves, our games, and our community to earn back the trust we’ve lost. It’s hard to admit that we haven’t been living up to our values, but it’s the right thing to do, and we can’t move forward without doing so.</p> 
                   <p>Please also consider donating to nonprofits benefiting and supporting the trans community—members of our staff recommend <a href="http://www.tgijp.org/" target="_blank">TGI Justice Project</a> and <a href="https://ingersollgendercenter.org/">Ingersoll Gender Center</a>, though there are many great organizations doing the work that would value your contribution.</p>
