  date\"> Monday, May 24, 2010</p> \n    <p>Well, it was a fun adventure, but sadly,\
  \ my journey as an editorial intern with Paizo must come to an end. The length of\
  \ my internship seemed only a few weeks at most, though it has indeed been several\
  \ moons, and other responsibilities vie for my attention.</p> \n    <p>I’ve gotten\
  \ a taste of all this industry has to offer while working here, from the exciting\
  \ realm of creative writing and development, manifesting wondrous creatures as well\
  \ as legendary characters, to the slightly less glamorous—but nonetheless vital—\
  task of alphabetizing spell lists and creating tables. Oh, I shall never forget\
  \ the sea of tables I created for Paizo. If one can imagine mountains—nay, alps—\
  of Excel spreadsheets, then one has ideated but a fraction of the truth. I could\
  \ go on for paragraphs about the plethora of tables, which, if pasted side-by-side\
  \ on a wall and gazed at from afar, might resemble ancient Osirian hieroglyphics\
  \ that tell of brave adventurers, or perhaps an epic tale of Thassilonian lore scrawled\
  \ across countless scrolls, or maybe even the systemized end product of a sleep-deprived\
  \ college student who happens to write about dragons and stuff.</p> \n    <p>Poetic\
  \ reminiscences aside, it’s been a good experience. I’ve still got another year\
  \ of college left up at Western Washington University, but this internship has helped\
  \ reinforce my dream of writing material for tabletop games such as Pathfinder,\
  \ and assured me that I am on the right track. Perhaps you’ll see my name in future\
  \ products, loyal reader, and you’ll be able to excitedly gather your comrades,\
  \ your shaky hands barely able to retain their grasp on the Adventure Path or module\
  \ clenched between your sweaty fingers, and you’ll show all your friends and say,\
  \ “Look! I commented on that guy’s blog post before he became famous!” And everyone\
  \ will look at you in awe, and solemnly utter things like, “Dude, are you hyperventilating?”\
  \ and “Woah, are your palms sweating over this? Do you need a doctor?”</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Until that fateful day, readers, I bid you farewell, and thank you for bearing\
  \ with my garrulous blog posts and lack of proficiency in regards to the realm of\
  \ corporate salesmanship. (On an unrelated note, buy more Paizo stuff! It’s good!\
  \ Real good!)</p> \n    <p>Seriously though, it’s been good. Peace, y’all!</p> \n\
