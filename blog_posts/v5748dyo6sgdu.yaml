  description\">Back when we announced Season 10, we were really excited about some\
  \ of the big stories that we hoped to wrap up in a big way. November really kicks\
  \ off two of these payoffs with a pair of high-level scenarios written by fan favorite\
  \ authors addressing two our favorite NPCs. We're really stoked!</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ first up is <a href=\"/products/btq01vpf/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1008-What-Prestige-is-Worth\"\
  >P<i>athfinder Society Scenario #10-08: What Prestige is Worth</i></a>, a Tier 7–\
  11 scenario that begat as many \"approximately 375 gp\" jokes when we were naming\
  \ it as appeared later in the product discussion thread. An uncontrollable portal\
  \ to Hell has opened in the Grand Lodge's basement, but Zarta Dralneen has ascertained\
  \ the most likely means of closing the rift in a way that doesn't flood Absalom\
  \ with devils. The only problem's that this plan involves an elite team traveling\
  \ with Zarta to Dis: the second level of Hell and Infernal City that embodies tyranny.\
  \ Easy, right? Well even though the PCs have a bone devil's short-lived protection\
  \ and Zarta's familiarity with the planar metropolis, expect some tough challenges\
  \ ahead. After all, your typical PC's spent several scenarios bludgeoning fiends\
  \ and declaring herself a hero, but now you're in your enemies' backyard.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Creating compelling extraplanar scenarios like this is a tough challenge,\
  \ so I'm thrilled that Matt Duval was ready to work on it. He's made a really dark\
  \ and thematic scenario that reminds the PCs just how out of their element they\
  \ are without pushing into the realm of uncomfortable levels of gratuity. On top\
  \ of that, I'm really excited about how the NPCs in this adventure turned out, ranging\
  \ from unfriendly employers to unrepentant contacts to unlikely allies (like the\
  \ one pictured here by Michele Giorgi). Why is Hell one of my favorite planes for\
  \ adventures? It's because of scenarios like this. If you want to learn more about\
  \ Dis, be sure to check out its gazetteer by Amanda Hamon Kunz in <a href=\"/products/btpya1b8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Realms\"\

  \ Hell isn't your thing—I'm not judging. Perhaps instead of dealing with devils\
  \ you'd rather smash in demon faces? You're in luck, because Linda Zayas-Palmer\

  \     <p>At the beginning of Season 10, we announced that we'd be including more\
  \ high-level content, in order to do justice to the finales of several stories and\
  \ character arcs that have been brewing for multiple years. But Tier 7–11 wasn't\
  \ quite high level enough to capture this month's heroic charge into the Abyss.\
  \ The treachery demon Koth'Vaul has been a thorn in the Pathfinder Society's side\
  \ for years, most notably as one of the masterminds behind last year's <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom\">siege on\
  \ Absalom</a>. In <a href=\"/products/btq01vpj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1009-The-Rasping-Rebirth\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10–09: The Rasping Rebirth</i></a>, by Cole Kronewitter,\
  \ Koth'Vaul puts into motion his grandest plot yet, charging into the realm of the\
  \ dead demon lord Deskari and collecting what power he can to fuel his own schemes.\
  \ Cole did not pull punches when representing this cunning villain, particularly\
  \ for those of you who opt to play this scenario's optional hard mode. Whether your\
  \ character is a righteous and stalwart paladin or someone whose heart could be\
  \ swayed by Abyssal temptation, they will have a significant choice to make. The\
  \ Pathfinder Society's past interactions with Koth'Vaul have mostly been in his\
  \ innocuous mortal disguises (<a href=\"/products/btpy9zk1?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-44-Relic-in-the-Wastes\"\
  >with one notable exception</a>), but he's ready to face them in his new and improved\
  \ true form, as illustrated by Josef Kucera.</p> \n     <p>Linda Zayas-Palmer</p>\

  \ much fun playing and running these as we had in developing them. Coming up in\
  \ the next several months, we'll be looking ahead to resuming the Hao Jin Tapestry\
  \ storyline!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play Lead Developer</i></p>\
