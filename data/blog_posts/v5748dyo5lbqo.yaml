  \   <blockquote> \n    <h1>Room For Improvement</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday,\
  \ January 3, 2011</p> \n    <p>It's a brand new year, and if there's anything the\
  \ turning of a year is good for—other than spending New Year's Eve partying while\
  \ dressed like post-apocalyptic air pirates and biosculpted mutants, like Editor\
  \ Judy and I did—it's taking stock of how far we've come, and how we might do better.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>While there's always plenty of room for personal improvement (and no,\
  \ Wes, I don't need any suggestions on that front), here I'm really thinking about\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\">Pathfinder Tales</a>. In the last year—heck, in\
  \ the last six months—we've come a long way, from just a dream of publishing Pathfinder-related\
  \ novels to having two excellent books on the shelves, a third off at the printer,\
  \ and a thriving line of <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial\">free, serialized short\
  \ stories and novellas</a> available on the website every week. Not too shabby!\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Yet we want more. Not just to publish more novels—because we will—\
  or to find and woo more excellent authors to join our camp—because we are—but to\
  \ assure both that the books continue to get better, and that they manage to make\
  \ it into people's hands. </p> \n    <p>Which is where we turn to you. If you're\
  \ reading this blog, odds are good that you're one of the hardcore Paizonians, the\
  \ folks who post on the messageboards, play the games, and read the books. And we\
  \ want to know what you think. Therefore, if you have a free minute—maybe the kids\
  \ are down for a nap, or your boss just left for lunch—please post in the comments\
  \ thread and answer a few Pathfinder Tales questions for us: </p> \n    <p>1) Is\
  \ there anything you'd like to see more of or less of from the novels or web fiction?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>2) What do you think would help new readers unfamiliar with Pathfinder\
  \ pick up the novels if they ran across them randomly in a bookstore? </p> \n  \
  \  <p>3) Which cover art do you like the best? Why? </p> \n    <p>4) Are there any\
  \ fantasy-related book blogs or online communities that you think might enjoy Pathfinder\
  \ Tales, if only we were to advertise/send review copies/etc? </p> \n    <p>5) Any\
  \ other ideas for how we can get more books into readers' hands? </p> \n    <p>Thanks,\
  \ and we look forward to hearing what you think!</p> \n    <p>James Sutter <br>Fiction\
