  \ href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/Starfinder_FieldTest_4.pdf\">fourth Starfinder\
  \ Second Edition Field Test</a></strong>!</p>\n      <p>As the Starfinder team prepares\
  \ for the launch of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest\">Starfinder\
  \ Second Edition Playtest</a> later this summer, we’re releasing small snapshots\
  \ of our work in progress. So far, we’ve previewed the soldier class, a couple of\
  \ ancestries, and the mystic. Be sure to check out those Field Tests if you haven’\
  t already! We appreciate all the discussion and hype around the Field Tests, which\
  \ energizes and motivates our creative processes even more than coffee does (if\
  \ you can believe it).</p>\n      <p><br>\n       Speaking of motivation, Field\
  \ Test #4 previews Starfinder’s “team player” and “party leader” class, the envoy!\
  \ Inside, you’ll find our thoughts on the envoy’s role and capabilities, and an\
  \ alpha version of the first 5 levels of the class, just like our earlier class\
  \ previews. While you may have seen the envoy in action during the Starfinder team’\
  s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm6g2MYVUCw\">livestream playtest</a>\
  \ in October, or perhaps you were lucky enough to play a demo at a recent convention,\
  \ this is your chance to see the actual draft of the class!</p>\n      <p>Oh, and\
  \ did I mention new art? I’m sure you’ve met our iconic envoy, Navasi!</p>\n   \

  \ Hamilton<br>\n         The Iconic envoy, Navasi, is ready for the field test!</p>\n\
  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>So, what’s the envoy all about? They’re a Charisma-based\
  \ class, and the Starfinder team generally thinks of envoys as “support” characters,\
  \ though they’re quite likely to play a leadership role, whether as a mover and\
  \ shaker in your campaign, as a “party leader” or “face” for the rest of the player\
  \ characters, or all the above! For envoys in Second Edition, we’re trying a brand\
  \ new mechanic in the form of “envoy directives.” These abilities—some of which\
  \ you get automatically, and others which you can select as envoy feats—give some\
  \ direction to the envoy’s allies and grant the envoy and their allies a small benefit\
  \ for following through on the orders. Directives have a variety of uses, from singling\
  \ out targets with “Get ‘Em!” to hustling the team into a better tactical position\
  \ with “Get in There!” Envoys can also “lead by example,” following their own directive\
  \ to grant everyone an additional bonus for the round. Combined with numerous other\
  \ feats that grant envoys combat options (like doling out temporary Hit Points,\
  \ buffs, and debuffs), the ability to wield awesome sci-fi weapons, and several\
  \ unique reactions, envoys have a satisfying and flexible action economy. Every\
  \ team will be happy to have an envoy along, and your ability to build an envoy\
  \ character to fit a variety of party roles means your envoy will always have a\
  \ team to call their own!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ from performing community service to battling whatever horrifying creatures Thurston\
  \ decides to throw at the rest of the team during internal playtests! So far, we\
  \ think envoys are a blast to play. They almost always have time to get into a good\
  \ position on the battlefield while consistently dishing out damage, granting benefits\
  \ to their allies, and tackling unexpected situations with their variety of skills\
  \ and adaptive skill feats. Sometimes a single turn for an envoy has a major impact\
  \ on a fight, such as by repositioning the entire team after a nasty ambush. We’\
  d love your feedback on how envoys play at your table, especially in different team\
  \ compositions—or with multiple envoys in the same party!</p>\n      <p>So, what’\
  re you waiting for? Get in there and read that field test! Finally, if you’re hoping\
  \ to catch more snippets of the playtest, stay tuned for announcements about future\
  \ playtest livestreams. We’ve still got more to show you between now and the playtest\
  \ release at GenCon!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
