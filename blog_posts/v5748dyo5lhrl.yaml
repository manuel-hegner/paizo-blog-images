  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week, I revealed three digital sculpts\
  \ for the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a>\
  \ boxed set of prepainted plastic gaming figures. This week we complete the set\
  \ with a look at the final three figures, as well as a look ahead to a special promotional\
  \ repaint figure that will be available free with $50 purchase at Paizo's booth\
  \ at Gen Con next week.</p> \n     <p>Let's look at the minis!</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150724-Crowe.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150724-Crowe_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have Crowe, Human Bloodrager from the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy978v\"><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a>. Crowe is based on artist\
  \ Wayne Reynolds's own Pathfinder character, so when we wrote an art order that\
  \ said \"just draw your own character here, Wayne,\" we were pretty confident we'd\
  \ end up with something awesome. Since Wayne is incapable of producing anything\
  \ that isn't awesome, we knew it was a pretty safe gamble. Crowe works great for\
  \ a bloodrager, a barbarian, or really any sort of martial character. His face tattoo\
  \ gives him a cool exotic look, and his earthbraker weapon looks like it packs a\
  \ real punch.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150724-Shardra.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150724-Shardra_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>When our friends from WizKids brought the paint masters\
  \ for this set to the Paizo office last week, we all pretty much agreed that Shardra\
  \ was the most impressive of the bunch. This dwarf shaman comes from the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy978v\"><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a>, and for my money I think\
  \ she's one of the coolest dwarf minis we've done to date. The level of detail on\
  \ her headdress and the overall \"weight\" of the figure makes a strong impression.\
  \ I'm thrilled to add this figure to the collection.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150724-Kolo_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Of course, Shardra wouldn't be complete without her\
  \ rock lizard familiar, Kolo, who also makes an appearance in this set. You can\
  \ use Kolo in conjunction with Shardra or simply as a Small/Tiny lizard, something\
  \ we've produced surprisingly few of in <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> so far. He's a fun addition.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a> is expected to hit stores and subscribers this\
  \ November!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150724-Dracolisk.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150724-Dracolisk_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Let's move on from boxed sets to talk about the very\
  \ special figure above, the Red Dracolisk! This impressive lizard is available free\
  \ with a purchase of $50 or more at the Paizo booth (#203) at Gen Con next week,\
  \ while supplies last. We're leaving a few Red Dracolisks behind at Paizo to put\
  \ up for sale some time after the convention season, so if you miss out on the Red\
  \ Dracolisk or can't get to the show this year, don't despair!</p> \n     <p>We\
  \ also have TWO MORE promotional <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ miniatures that we'll be distributing at Gen Con, but I want to keep their identities\
  \ secret for now. We'll supply these figures to ticketed players of the Thursday\
  \ and Friday night Pathfinder Society Specials at Gen Con, so be sure to look out\
  \ for them at the show. Like the Red Dracolisk, we'll have several available on\
  \ paizo.com eventually, so missing out at the show won't necessarily mean missing\
  \ out forever.</p> \n     <p>I'm going to be spending most of my Gen Con packed\
  \ away in Paizo's meeting room, but if you see me wandering around the booth, please\
  \ take a moment to say hello! I love chatting about minis in person even more than\
  \ I love talking about them here, and I'm eager to see you at the show!</p> \n \
  \    <p>That's it for now. No blog next week, but we'll catch up after the Big Show!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Until then, I remain,</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
