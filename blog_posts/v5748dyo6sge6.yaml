  \ please follow the links above.</i></p> \n    <p>Today, I'll be talking about the\
  \ final thread, Factions and Fame. Who are your allies, and how can you leverage\
  \ your reputation into meaningful benefits for your character? I'll talk about fame\
  \ first, since it's a bit more straightforward.</p> \n    <h2>Fame</h2> \n    <p>There\
  \ wasn't much discussion in the sticky thread about fame, so our work on this topic\
  \ is mostly based off of the lessons we've learned from Starfinder Society. By a\
  \ large margin, we've heard that people prefer just about every aspect of the way\
  \ Reputation and Fame work in Starfinder Society to the way Fame and Prestige work\
  \ in Pathfinder Society. I'll say more on the inconsistent definition of Fame across\
  \ campaigns in a moment. But for now, I'd like to break down which changes we're\
  \ looking to make for Pathfinder Society as we transition to the future..</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Item Access:</b> In the current version of Pathfinder Society, character's\
  \ Fame determines their access to magic items. In theory, this system could be used\
  \ as a way to reward PCs who excel at their missions with better item access. In\
  \ practice, the chart is irrelevant to the vast majority of PCs, who are limited\
  \ only by the amount of money they have. This system requires us to print magic\
  \ items on Chronicle sheets that nearly all PCs would have access to anyway. We've\
  \ heard a fair amount of negative feedback about this chart, and we're not planning\
  \ to use it going forward. Instead, we are looking to tie magic item access to character\
  \ level. This would not necessarily use the same rules as Starfinder Society. Once\
  \ the new rules are finished, we'll explore the details of this method further.\
  \ Factors like the rarity system and expected item access by level need to be finalized\
  \ before we can realistically make progress on this topic.</p> \n    <p><b>What\
  \ is my Prestige good for?:</b> Other than removing the Fame chart for item access,\
  \ the other common request we've received about the fame/prestige system is to make\
  \ sure there are plenty of options for spending Prestige Points, with a focus on\
  \ options that are broadly available to characters without being gated behind purchasing\
  \ certain books or playing certain scenarios. For this, we're looking toward a model\
  \ similar to Starfinder Society, including plenty of faction-specific boons as well\
  \ as some general use boons. This would also come with a loosening of the faction\
  \ system so PCs could earn benefits for multiple factions, but I'll get back to\
  \ that in just a minute.</p> \n    <p><b>Infamy:</b> Starfinder Society has an Infamy\
  \ system, in which characters who choose particularly shady solutions to the challenges\
  \ in the adventure or otherwise act in less-than-upstanding ways become known for\
  \ their misdeeds. In Starfinder Society, infamous characters have a harder time\
  \ finding people to sell them items. If they become infamous enough and don't take\
  \ steps to fix their reputation, they could even lose their position in the Starfinder\
  \ Society. The Infamy system has been particularly well-received, so we are planning\
  \ to implement an Infamy system. We may tie Infamy to item access in the next iteration\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society as well, but like I said above, decisions on that will\
  \ need to wait until all of the changes from the Playtest are in place.</p> \n \
  \   <p><b>Fame and Prestige, or Reputation and Fame?:</b> One point of confusion\
  \ that arises between the Pathfinder Society campaign and the Starfinder Society\
  \ campaign is the meaning of Fame. In Pathfinder Society, Fame is a number that\
  \ represents your character's overall standing and influence, while Prestige Points\
  \ are a spendable resource. In Starfinder Society, on the other hand, Reputation\
  \ represents your character's standing and influence, while Fame is a spendable\
  \ resource. We've received a fair amount of feedback that this is confusing. To\
  \ make it easier for players to engage with both campaigns, we're inclined to use\
  \ the terms Reputation and Fame in Pathfinder Society version two, in a matter consistent\
  \ with the way they are used in Starfinder Society.</p> \n    <h2>Factions</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Factions have gone through quite a bit of transformation since the Season\
  \ 0 of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, when five rival factions based\
  \ around the interests of specific nations vied for influence within the Society.\
  \ In Season 3, the number of factions doubled, adding five more factions based more\
  \ on ideology than national origin. In Season 4, in an attempt to bring the number\
  \ of factions to a more manageable level, the two factions with the lowest reported\
  \ popularity, the Lantern Lodge and the Shadow Lodge, were retired from play. In\
  \ Season 6, the national factions themselves transformed into ideological ones.\
  \ While these new ideological factions were better suited to storytelling and appealed\
  \ to a broader range of characters, we received feedback that the mid-campaign switch\
  \ was jarring. Faction transformations can be tough, and retirements more so, particularly\
  \ if you've built a character around being part of a group and suddenly find yourself\
  \ needing to switch to a different cause. With that in mind, we're working to build\
  \ a system from the get-go that includes enough factions to give choice without\
  \ being overwhelming, and to create factions that appeal to a broad range of characters\
  \ without being generic.</p> \n    <p><b>One Faction or Many?:</b> As members of\
  \ the Pathfinder Society chapter one, PCs choose a single faction to represent.\
  \ They can change to another faction, but doing so often requires paying a significant\
  \ cost. In Starfinder Society, PCs can support the interests of a single faction,\
  \ or they can branch out and champion several factions. They can choose each scenario\
  \ which faction they want to champion, and there is no penalty for switching. The\
  \ feedback we've received strongly suggests that the Starfinder system is a big\
  \ improvement, so we're planning to use it in Pathfinder Society as well. This doesn't\
  \ mean we're going to create Pathfinder analogues of the existing Starfinder factions,\
  \ but rather that we want to open up more options for ways to play your character.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Scrolls, Spells, and Swords:</b> We saw a few suggestions to include\
  \ the schools within the Pathfinder Society—the Scrolls, Spells, and Swords—into\
  \ factions. We aren't planning to make them factions; instead, we'd like them to\
  \ represent another meaningful decision you can make at character creation. For\
  \ context, most agents begin their careers by training at the Grand Lodge, receiving\
  \ instruction from the three deans, adopting their respective virtues, and often\
  \ favoring one of the three schools by the point of Confirmation. The Scrolls value\
  \ knowledge, diplomacy, and the pursuit of truth. Meanwhile, the Spells value determination,\
  \ independence, and magical talent. They focus on magical studies, both those that\
  \ uncover the lost secrets of the past and those that create new items, spells,\
  \ and traditions. Finally, the Swords value personal fitness, martial training,\
  \ and sound judgment under pressure. In the future, we're planning to make this\
  \ affiliation matter. We've begun to consider several models for giving the PCs\
  \ access to resources and support based on their school (or what it might mean to\
  \ be a field-commissioned agent), but this is another factor that will need to wait\
  \ for the final game rules to consider further.</p> \n    <p><b>Factions:</b> If\
  \ the Scrolls, Spells, and Swords represent how your character joined the society\
  \ and grew to become a capable agent, factions represent your character's goals,\
  \ motivations, and allies. The shift from a rigid system of factions that demand\
  \ exclusive allegiance to a system with many choices also gives us a chance to re-examine\
  \ what the factions are.</p> \n    <p>What we aren't looking to do is simply port\
  \ over factions into Pathfinder Society chapter two. Some factions have largely\
  \ completed their goals. Others may experience changes over the course of Season\
  \ 10 or during the campaign's Interactive Finale. Rather than being bound to the\
  \ list of factions we have now, we'd like to start from the perspective of creating\
  \ a list of factions that are interesting to many different PCs. To that end, we\
  \ brainstormed a list of character motivations that lend themselves to group action.\
  \ Some of these ideas have clear parallels to existing Pathfinder Society factions,\
  \ while others explore new territory. Once we've chosen which seeds to use, we can\
  \ build more nuanced factions around them. Let us know what you think in this week's\
  \ survey, linked at the bottom of this blog.</p> \n    <p>So this raises a natural\
  \ question—what about our faction leaders? Will they end up leading some of the\
  \ new factions, taking supporting roles, fading into the background, or leaving\
  \ the Society entirely? There's a Season 10 scenario that addresses exactly this\
  \ question for one faction leader. Beyond that, we'd like to hear what you'd like\
  \ to see us do with the current leaders. When rating NPCs, be sure to rate them\
  \ based on your feelings as a player, not your character's feelings. So if there's\
  \ an NPC that one of your characters has a grudge with, but that you as a player\
  \ would like to see stick around, rate them accordingly.</p> \n    <p>We look forward\
  \ to hearing your feedback in the <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/OPFactions\"\
