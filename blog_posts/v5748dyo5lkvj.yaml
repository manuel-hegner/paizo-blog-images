  description\">Over the years, we have added a wide variety of new rules to Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition, but none has been so well received as archetypes. It's no surprise\
  \ that archetypes found such universal appeal. Allowing you to play a more specialized\
  \ character, they let you play the character you want to play in a way that a single\
  \ class often cannot support.</p> \n    <p>When the time came for us to look at\
  \ archetypes for the Pathfinder Playtest, we knew that we wanted to make them a\
  \ more integral part of the game, built to be an option from the very beginning.\
  \ We also wanted to open them up a bit, so we could build archetypes allowing more\
  \ than one class to access their features and feats, as opposed to having to recreate\
  \ a concept for every applicable class with an entirely new archetype. This doesn't\
  \ prevent us from creating more specific archetypes as well, but it opens up the\
  \ design space further. In opening archetypes up, we realized that they might be\
  \ easily abused if a player dipped into a variety of archetypes just to grab the\
  \ best rules bits to make an overpowered character. It was a tough set of challenges,\
  \ but fortunately for us, the answer was already built into the game.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Archetypes in the Pathfinder Playtest consist of a series of feats you can\
  \ choose in place of your class feats. Every class gets its feats at roughly every\
  \ other level, making them a perfect cost for archetypes. So if an archetype appeals\
  \ to you—say, the pirate archetype—the only thing you need to do to gain access\
  \ to it is take the appropriate dedication feat. Each dedication feat gives you\
  \ some basic abilities and adds all the rest of that archetype's feats to your list\
  \ of available class feats. The only catch is that you cannot take another dedication\
  \ feat until after you have taken a specified number of archetype feats from the\
  \ first one. So you can dip into a single archetype without too much trouble, but\
  \ if you want more than one, you really have to put a fair amount of your character\
  \ into the concept. For example, let's take a look at the pirate archetype.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Pirate Dedication <span\
  \ class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 2</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Archetype,\
  \ Dedication</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b> Dexterity\
  \ 12, trained in Acrobatics and Sailing Lore</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >When you Balance aboard a ship, treat a success as a critical success. You also\
  \ ignore any difficult terrain, uneven ground, or incline caused by the ship's movement.\
  \ You are trained with the hatchet, scimitar, and spear. In addition, Acrobatics\
  \ is a signature skill for you.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b>\
  \ You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats\
  \ from the pirate archetype.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>As you can see, this\
  \ first feat gives you a fair number of advantages while on a boat, certainly helping\
  \ should combat break out, but you need to take more pirate feats before you can\
  \ pick up another dedication feat. Let's take a look at two that you might choose.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Sea Legs <span class=\"\
  stat-block-cr\">Feat 4</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Archetype</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b> Pirate Dedication, trained\
  \ in Athletics</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Athletics is a signature skill\
  \ for you. Whenever you succeed at an Athletics check to Swim, treat your result\
  \ as a critical success. Additionally, you can always hold your breath for a number\
  \ of actions equal to double your Constitution score when in water (this is not\
  \ increased by using the Breathe Deep action).</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Sea\
  \ Legs really helps when you are in the water, letting you swim faster and hold\
  \ your breath longer. It's also a prerequisite for Roll with the Ship, a feat that\
  \ lets you reroll your Reflex saves when you are on your ship!</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">[[AA]] Boarding Action <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Feat 6</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Archetype</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b> Rope Runner</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Swing on a rope or Stride up to twice your Speed. As long as you either boarded\
  \ or disembarked a boat during this movement, make a Strike and deal an extra die\
  \ of damage if you hit.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Boarding Action is one\
  \ of those feats that nearly every pirate can be expected to have, since setting\
  \ yourself up to board and pillage the enemy ship is going to be vital! It lets\
  \ you close the distance to your foes, and if you move from one ship to another\
  \ during this move, you can make a strike that deals extra damage! It's a bit more\
  \ limited than the fighter's Sudden Charge, but you deal bonus damage as a benefit\
  \ if you pull it off.</p> \n    <p>The pirate archetype has six feats to choose\
  \ from (in addition to the dedication feat), which gives you plenty of variety if\
  \ you are looking to explore the archetype before heading to the next one. The great\
  \ part is that these pirate feats are part of your options list for the rest of\
  \ your character's career, so you can always go back to pick up a feat that you\
  \ missed.</p> \n    <p>Lastly, I want to take a look at prestige archetypes. These\
  \ are archetypes whose dedication feats come with some pretty hefty prerequisites\
  \ you have to meet before you can select them. In the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i>,\
  \ we included only one such archetype as an example for you to play around with\
  \ in your campaign: the Gray Maiden. Take a look at this dedication feat.</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Gray Maiden Dedication <span\
  \ class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 6</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Archetype,\
  \ Dedication, Prestige</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>\
  \ Strength 16, expert in Fortitude saves, trained in heavy armor and all martial\
  \ weapons, member of the Gray Maidens</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Your\
  \ Gray Maiden training has steeled you against harsh physical conditions. You become\
  \ a master at Fortitude saves. When you succeed at a Fortitude save, treat it as\
  \ a critical success. You also gain access to special armor: Gray Maiden plate.\
  \ Gray Maiden plate is a level 3 item that costs 600 sp, grants +7 AC and +3 TAC,\
  \ and has a Dexterity modifier cap of +0; otherwise, it uses the same stats as full\
  \ plate.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b> You cannot select another\
  \ dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Gray Maiden archetype.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Becoming a master at Fortitude saves is not something\
  \ you can easily do in most classes; in fact, level 6 is sooner than even a barbarian\
  \ can manage, and that armor is some of the best you can find. Of course, joining\
  \ the Gray Maiden organization is no simple feat either. Once you are in, this prestige\
  \ archetype includes a variety of powerful feats that you can add to your character.\
  \ Here is just a taste.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Unbreakable <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 8</span></p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Archetype</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>\
  \ Gray Maiden Dedication</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You can endure a staggering\
  \ amount of punishment. Increase your maximum HP by your level, increasing as you\
  \ gain additional levels. You die at dying 5, or dying 6 if you also have Diehard.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>This grants many of the benefits of the Toughness\
  \ and Diehard general feats combined, and it stacks with both to make an incredibly\
  \ resilient character.</p> \n    <p>That wraps up our look at archetypes. You'll\
  \ find a number of them in the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i>, and we can't\
  \ wait for you to give them a try. And come back on Monday for a massive blog that\
  \ I am sure will resonate with many of you!</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director\
