  \ Skills and Feats</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April 9, 2015</p> \n \
  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">If classes\
  \ are the main chassis of a character, skills and feats are its nuts and bolts.\
  \ When they let us designers loose in <a href=\"/products/btpy9c25\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Unchained</em></a>, it's only natural that we wanted to play around with how the\
  \ nuts and bolts attach, and even try changing the shapes of those nuts and bolts\
  \ entirely! In Chapters 2 and 3 of <em>Pathfinder Unchained</em>, there are not\
  \ only several daring subsystems that play with feats, there so many different options\
  \ for restructuring skills that it's easy to lose yourself in all the possibilities.\
  \ I've gathered some of the coolest tidbits from all those options to share with\
  \ you today!</p> \n     <p>Starting with skills, the three major skills options\
  \ each serve a different goal.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \  <br> <i>Illustration by Géraud Soulié</i>\n      </div> \n      <p><b>I Need\
  \ More Skills to Flesh Out My Character</b><br> The background skills variant separates\
  \ out certain skills as background skills as opposed to adventuring skills. It also\
  \ adds some new background skills to the game, such as Lore, a very specific version\
  \ of the Knowledge skill. To round it out, everyone gains 2 extra skill points to\
  \ spend on background skills, no matter your class!</p> \n      <p><b>There Are\
  \ Too Many Skills</b><br> The consolidated skills variant serves a somewhat opposite\
  \ goal, combining current skill functionality into only 12 skills.</p> \n      <p><b>Assigning\
  \ Skill Points Can Be Tough</b><br> The grouped skills variant makes it easier to\
  \ assign skills, speeding up the level-up process. It also gives characters a middle\
  \ tier of skills that they are pretty good at, rather than most characters having\
  \ mostly max ranks, 1 rank, or no ranks.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>As cool\
  \ as the skill sections are, the sections involving feats are the showstoppers of\
  \ today's blog!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Variant Multiclassing</b><br>\
  \ Have you ever wanted to multiclass your character for flavor reasons—maybe pick\
  \ up some bardic performances and versatile performance to represent the time you\
  \ unexpectedly spent studying music one adventure—but then you realized that your\
  \ character would be pretty significantly handicapped by taking those two levels\
  \ in bard? It happens all the time, and it requires you to sacrifice something whichever\
  \ choice you take. With the variant multiclassing option, you can choose a secondary\
  \ class and trade out half your feats (3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th) to instead\
  \ gain a progression of special abilities based on which class you pick. Want to\
  \ be a fighter who dabbles in divination magic such that he always acts on the surprise\
  \ round or vexes his foes with hexes? You're covered. Want to be a druid who specializes\
  \ in taking out dragons as her favored enemy or flies into a rage when the natural\
  \ world is in danger? You've got that too. With variant multiclassing, you can open\
  \ more combinations than ever before, without delaying your access to your main\
  \ class's cool new features!</p> \n      <p><b>Stamina System</b><br> The stamina\
  \ system offers new powers for every combat feat in the RPG line. Yes, you read\
  \ that right: it specifically lists every combat feat in the whole line and then\
  \ grants each feat new powers. Right from the start, the system offers options for\
  \ you to just give the system to fighters or to give it to all martial characters,\
  \ depending on your preference. Stamina is a new resource that allows martial characters\
  \ to boost themselves and use their feats in new and exciting ways. It regenerates\
  \ relatively quickly between battles, allowing you to enjoy an entirely new mindset\
  \ to your daily exploration; a party of stamina-users benefits from hit and run\
  \ guerilla tactics, emphasizing the value of mobility, stealth, and timing (as opposed\
  \ to the mindset of \"buff, buff, buff, speed through!\"). Stamina lets you boost\
  \ your effectiveness or change the rules of the feat in your favor. These special\
  \ stamina powers are called combat tricks. While I'm sure that the ways to use stamina\
  \ to boost your effectiveness will be quite popular (like Critical Focus, where\
  \ under certain conditions, you can increase your critical multiplier, potentially\
  \ multiple times if you roll high enough), I'm a fan of the combat tricks that let\
  \ you retroactively apply an effect (like declare a Stunning Fist after you already\
  \ know your attack connected), and my absolute favorites are the ones that let you\
  \ trick your opponent through devious tactical play. For instance, the Combat Style\
  \ Master combat trick allows you to spend stamina to switch your styles as an off-turn\
  \ free action. So you can lure people into attacking you and then suddenly be in\
  \ Snake Style before they can even call off the attack! In the same vein, I also\
  \ really enjoy the combat tricks that let you use your powers when you normally\
  \ couldn't, since that has two cool psychological effects: not only can it present\
  \ great \"gotcha\" moments, but once your enemy knows you can, say, spend stamina\
  \ to take a second attack of opportunity against them from the same opportunity,\
  \ it changes the way they view your threat, and it might allow you to control their\
  \ actions without even spending your stamina!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Tune\
  \ in next time to learn more about magic—specifically, the new scaling magic items\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy9c25\"><em>Pathfinder Unchained</em></a> that grow\
  \ with your character!</p> \n     <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p> \n   \
