               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Feiya followed her fox familiar’s nine white tails over the rocks and up the flank of a rocky butte. The night’s cold still clung to the hollows of the land, but she didn’t mind it. After years in Irrisen’s snowy woods, the chill comforted her. Cold, she understood. These too bright plains with too few trees, however, were pure mystery to her.</p> 
                <p>Daji looked over his shoulder, cocking his head a little. She had to laugh.</p> 
                <p>“Yes, my friend, I’m complaining to myself. Numeria, fascinating as it is, is a hard place.” </p> 
                <p>He almost seemed to bob his head, then went back to bounding along over the rocks and lichens that formed the skin of this gray land. Feiya found his mood infectious. After all, Numeria had already been good to her. Her contact with a Kellid tribe had given her a lead on the most promising shrine to Desna yet. A shrine built by hermits… in a cave near the top of this butte, far from any caravan routes or villages, shrouded in mystery… It all reminded her so much of the place where she believed the goddess had first called her to a life of magic</p> 
                <p>No, she was glad she had come here. She was ready to learn more about the deity who had transformed her from a scared girl to a powerful witch.</p> 
                <p>The butte grew steeper as she and the fox walked, a few dead trees clawing out between the rocks as if straining for moisture. Feiya felt herself walking more carefully, listening harder. Someone up on the summit might hear her approaching, and the trail’s hairpin turns meant blind curve after blind curve. She found herself moving her staff to the ready position, even though she heard nothing besides the wind and a distant hawk.</p> 
                <p>“Daji,” she whispered, trusting her gut. She slipped between two large boulders and felt glad for their protection. “The shrine is set in the cliffs near the butte’s summit. It’s not far now. You up to scouting it out?”</p> 
                <p>He sat down at her feet and fixed his golden eyes on her face. The hairs on Feiya’s arms tingled. Sometimes it was easy to think of Daji as a simple animal—a very special, nine-tailed animal, but an animal nonetheless. But at this moment, she could feel a wisdom emanating from his vulpine form, a wisdom older and deeper than any being, human or animal. </p> 
                <p>The world flashed white, and then her eyes adjusted, viewing the landscape in a new register of colors—the shadows more purple, the rocks more yellow. The world widened, too, her new eyes set farther apart than the ones in her own face. Daji’s eyes. The fox glanced up at Feiya’s body, quiet and senseless for the duration of the spell. She didn’t want to share Daji’s senses for more than a minute; these boulders were only a temporary shelter while she looked through her familiar’s eyes.</p> 
                <p>The fox spun around and leaped over a cluster of rocks. The lightness of his body made jumping pure joy. Feiya wished she could urge him to run even faster, just to feel his paws in motion.</p> 
                <p>He skidded to a stop, an acrid stench so powerful it was like a hand shoving his muzzle backward. His eyes watered a little at the biting stink of it. Some kind of craft sat blocking the trail, its metal flanks nearly blinding in the morning sun. The burning smell came off it in waves.</p> 
                <p>A sound whipped Daji’s head around—a sound so slight, Feiya would have never heard it with her own ears. The fox shrank beneath the nearest boulder, his heart pounding. The stinking craft had so overwhelmed him he hadn’t even noticed the horrifying creature emerging from the cliff wall above him.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Valeriya Lutfullina. The witch is one of four classes making their second edition debut in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide">Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</a>, available July 30, 2020.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>Feiya snapped her senses back into her own body. What in all Golarion had Daji just seen? She closed her eyes, drawing up her memory and trying to reacclimate to her human perspective. It was huge, she knew that. As big or probably bigger than a bear. The memory of Daji’s fear made her shiver, and she pushed it away, trying to force the jumbled images, scents, and sounds into some semblance of understanding.</p> 
                <p>But it was nothing she had ever seen or even heard of—some kind a giant insect or land lobster. She frowned, thinking harder. There’d been something strange about its legs, those spiky, lumpy, terrifying legs. </p> 
                <p>She wished she dared risk sharing Daji’s senses again, but it was too big a risk. </p> 
                <p>Which reminded her. Daji hadn’t come back yet.</p> 
                <p>Feiya lowered herself into a crouch and crept through the field of fallen boulders. Here on the north flank of the butte, she could see the strange craft, its sides a jumble of angles and colors she couldn’t begin to describe. It emanated a sense of alien power that reminded her of the few bits of skymetal she’d been lucky enough to inspect in her travels. Ancient, otherworldly stuff, it had made her skin tingle and her stomach prickle. Her eyes watered, looking at this new thing. She didn’t know what it was, but she felt certain it came from somewhere beyond her own sky.</p> 
                <p>Rocks clattered, and she pressed herself into the dirt. Boulders blocked her view, but she could hear rocks rattle, shift, and grind as something massive made its way down the cliff face.</p> 
                <p>A flick of white in the corner of her eye made her turn her head. Daji stared out at her from beneath a rock, curled as small as he could. She had never seen him look so worried.</p> 
                <p>Then one of the creature’s forelegs moved into view, and Feiya had to clamp her hand over her mouth to stifle her startled inhalation. The thing was bigger than she’d been able to see from Daji’s one quick glimpse. Its pointed foreleg drove into the ground mere feet from her head, shaking the rocks around her.</p> 
                <p>She followed the greenish armor of the leg up to a joint segment, up again, the leg widening, thicker than she was now, and—</p> 
                <p>An eye.</p> 
                <p>An enormous round orange eye, staring down at her.</p> 
                <p>The leg lifted and then slammed into the ground again. The boulders around Feiya shifted under the impact and she rolled into the trail, away from their crushing weight. Daji raced to her side.</p> 
                <p>She was exposed now, but she could see the beast in its entirety. Twice as big as a bear, its shell like an evil green mockery of a lobster’s. Giant, clacking pincers. And on its back, pink, swollen blisters, each one pulsing, beating, throbbing around a human brain.</p> 
                <p>Throbbing like a heart still pumping life into someone’s suffering soul.</p> 
                <p>She didn’t think twice. One of her oldest spells sprang into her mind, and she launched it with her full strength of will and concentration, energy pouring out of her palm and slamming into one of the pustules on the creature’s back. The power stirred a surge of dark glee in her heart, and she laughed, the laughter spurring her ray’s power longer and harder. The pustule exploded. A shriek filled Feiya’s mind, its words unfathomable but its rage palpable. Her mind faltered at the strength of the creature’s horrible anger.</p> 
                <p>The creature twitched a pincer and Feiya felt herself fly through the air, gripped by an invisible claw. For a second, she hovered above the ground, staring down at the alien monster whose magic held her tight.</p> 
                <p>Then she soared sideways into the trunk of a dead tree and slid down it, her head spinning, the air knocked out of her. Someplace in the distance, Daji growled. Feiya could only stare up at the horrible creature walking toward her, its shell nearly blotting out the sky, its remaining brains pulsing harder than ever.</p> 
                <p>There was only one way that her brain wouldn’t soon occupy another grotesque pustule on the creature’s back.</p> 
                <p>Feiya glanced toward her familiar, who now stood just behind the approaching horror, his tails splayed wide, ears back and teeth bared. “Yes, Daji,” she whispered as her fingers twitched, the magical force of a terrible curse forming around them. “I was thinking the same thing.”</p>

                <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, July 05, 4:30 p.m.</h2> 
                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li> 
                </ul>

                <blockquote> 
                 <h3>The Path of the Heavens</h3> 
                 <p><b>Areas of Concern</b> Celestial bodies, navigation, travelers<br> <b>Alignment</b> CG (NG, CG, CN)<br> <b>Divine Font</b> <em>heal</em><br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Intelligence or Wisdom<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Survival<br> <b>Domains</b> moon, stars, sun, travel<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> darkness, void<br> <b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <em>longstrider</em>, 2nd: <em>flaming sphere,</em> 3rd: <em>gravity well (Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic 108)</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> guide travelers; observe the movements of the moon, planets, and stars<br> <b>Anathema</b> mislead a traveler, permanently blind an enemy<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> Starknife</p> 
                 <p>The Path of the Heavens is well known to those who make their way in Golarion. Looking down from above, these deities help travelers and voyagers find their path. Their guidance can be literal, or for others, more spiritual—some worshippers seek to know the progress of Sarenrae (the sun), Tsukiyo (the moon), and Desna (the stars) and through this knowledge gain enlightenment. Nocticula, the last member of the pantheon, for her part uses the cover of the darkness, the gaps in between the others, to shelter travelers and outcasts. Some who worship her as their primary deity in the pantheon seek to use the void between the stars to defend voyagers on the road. Though this is frowned upon by the other members of the Path of the Heavens, it does not seem to disrupt the harmony between the gods.</p>

Paizo isn’t add any additional costs, so the block length events will cost $2.00. PACS events, being half a block in length, will be $1.00. Quests/Bounties, as 1 hour taster events, will be free. The <a href="https://www.gencon.com/online" target="_blank">event catalog</a> goes live on <b>July 6</b> and ticket sales begin on <b>July 13</b> and run through the event.</p> 
                <p>Though ticketed through Gen Con, all our games will take place on VTTs. The Paizo Organized Play Online Events (POPOE) server, which we have used successfully for PaizoCon Online and ConCurrent, will be our gathering place for muster, chat, and You can <a href="https://discord.com/invite/j3rhjJS" target="_blank">use this link</a> to join the POPOE discord now, though the channels won’t go live until closer to Gen Con</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Merisiel took a deep breath, held it, then let it out slowly as she tried to relax, her arms balanced, palms up, along the chair’s slender armrests. It wasn’t working. Her belly remained tight and crawling with gutwasps—the nervous feeling in the pit of your stomach that the church of Calistria called “the tingle you get ‘fore the trick is all set.” But this was no complex prank or long-planned vengeance that had the wasps doing their thing. It was something, Merisiel forced herself to remember, that she’d brought entirely upon herself.</p> 
                <p>Not that bringing nerve-wracking situations on herself was anything new either. </p> 
                <p>There was the time she’d crawled head-first into that narrow crevice at the base of that giant anvil-altar after Harsk had mentioned how worshipers of Droskar supposedly stashed treasures under the immense shrines. </p> 
                <p>Or the time that Valeros had challenged her to a drinking contest on that long trip to Absalom. And who could forget Lem’s face when she took him on with that dare to climb to the top of a Hellknight castle’s tower to swap out its flag for a set of ogre undergarments? </p> 
                <p>And of course, there was that stunt she’d pulled when she’d first met that cute cleric up in Sandpoint; when Merisiel had thrown herself into the thick of a fight against a pack of ghouls in order to show off that there was more than one way to destroy undead uprisings.</p> 
                <p>Thinking back on those antics did the trick, and Merisiel sighed in relief as the gutwasps settled down. After all, the cache of magic potions, scrolls, and talismans she’d recovered from the under-anvil stash ended up saving the day not long thereafter when those smoke-bearded undead guardians had risen up against them, hadn’t they? (Never mind the fact that it was the pilfering of the temple treasury that likely got their attention in the first place.)</p> 
                <p>And good, old Valeros sill thought she’d won the drinking contest fair and square and bragged about her fortitude to anyone who’d listen. (As far as Merisiel was concerned, some quick sleight of hand on the drinks was only playing to her strength anyway—it was only cheating if you got caught!)</p> 
                <p>And those insufferable Hellknights had the heraldry redecoration coming. (More to the point, everyone she told the story to agreed that ogre garments looked better on a Hellknight flagpole than any dull, old flag!)</p> 
                <p>And as for that ghoul-slaying gambit, the fact that Merisiel knew those filthy, old ghouls wouldn’t be able to paralyze her didn’t make the stunt any less risky. She’d managed to avoid any serious bites, but after finishing off the last of them with a dagger to the dome, she’d emerged completely covered with claw marks and a bit dizzy from blood loss. Of course, the dizzy only got worse when the cute cleric swooped in to catch her as she stumbled and began to heal up her wounds. Merisiel had been tempted to kiss her there and then, but those pesky gutwasps had gotten in the way. Still, she must have made an impression on Kyra, since that first kiss came not so long after. Better than the dragon’s whole treasure horde, that moment!</p>

                </div> 
                <p>And just like that, all the work she’d done to banish her jitters went out the window. Just thinking of Kyra had brought back the gutwasps. Merisiel couldn’t help but wonder, was the woman she loved experiencing the same jitters herself, one room over? She couldn’t imagine it. Kyra was always so calming, so stable, so confident. And for that matter, the church of Sarenrae probably didn’t call it gutwasps anyway. Maybe… sun-gut? Angel ache? Dawnflower jitters? The healy heaves? The last notion brought a giggle to the elf’s lips, and the nervousness in that titter startled her. She reached down to give her weal ribbon a rub, but of course that didn’t help; she’d given the yellow and black Calistrian ribbon over to the high priestess for use in the ritual.</p> 
                <p>Merisiel was out of the chair then, pacing the length of the room as she ran over her part in the ritual in her head. Here, surrounded on all sides by Sarenite art and iconography, she couldn’t help but feel inadequate. What place did an elf with no family, a thief and a smuggler, a part-time worshiper of the goddess of trickery, vengeance, and pleasure, have in a place as beautiful as this? What place did she have at the side of one of the most kind-hearted and understanding people she’d ever met? Merisiel pushed those doubts aside, reminding herself that, while she’d spent most of that night a week ago building up her courage to suggest she and Kyra take part in a heartbond, Kyra had surprised her by making the suggestion herself. This whole plan wasn’t technically Merisiel’s own, despite the months she’d taken researching the ritual and preparing for it. Kyra had been the first to suggest it, after all.</p> 
                <p>Merisiel’s nervous thoughts kept returning to the what-ifs of the pending rite. She and Kyra, as the focus of the magic, would only be secondary performers in the ritual, but that didn’t mean that their part in activating the magic wouldn’t be important. She knew that Kyra would be performing her part of the ritual using her knack at knowing the right thing to say, but Merisiel had to rely upon her skill at knowing the ins and outs of society as a whole. As with any ritual, there was a potential for backlash, but the descriptions of the jitters and shakes and dulling of wits that struck those who failed to perform a heartbond properly didn’t seem all that much worse than the gutwasps she was already dealing with.</p> 
                <p>And of course, if all went according to plan, they’d have more than a cherished memory of the declaration of their love for each other—they would be connected on a level even deeper than before, able to sense each other’s proximity, to share their thoughts and hopes, and would never feel alone. Merisiel had assumed Kyra would want to seal the ritual with traditional matched rings. In preparation, she had actually purchased jewelry for the first time she could remember (plundered or stolen rings just seemed wrong in this case), only for Kyra to suggest using Calistrian weal ribbons to symbolize the bond. Kyra must have taken Merisiel’s shock for something other than speechless love, since she’d hastened to add, “Since you’ve pushed to have the ritual performed by my church, it just made sense for there to be an element of yours involved.” Or at least, that’s how Merisiel assumed the sentence would have ended if she hadn’t stopped it with an impulsive kiss.</p> 
                <p>A knock on the door brought her pacing feet and her racing thoughts to a standstill. “The high priestess is ready for you,” came the acolyte’s voice.</p> 
                <p>“Okay!” Merisiel answered, blushing as she heard that nervous tremble in her own voice. She took a breath and stepped toward the door. She could already hear the music swelling, could even hear Seoni chiding Valeros to “Quiet down—here they come” from the far side of the door. The gutwasps were back and worse than ever, and as Merisiel opened the door, she marveled at how her hand, normally so steady, so precise, was shaking.</p> 
                <p>And then, as she stood at the edge of the room, only vaguely aware of her friends gathered (mostly) silently along the walls, she saw Kyra framed in the opposite doorway. And a moment later, as Kyra’s lips moved, Merisiel heard her beloved’s voice whisper in her ear. If the ritual was truly successful, they’d both be able to speak to each other with their thoughts, but for the moment, Merisiel knew that Kyra had cast the cantrip herself.</p> 
                <p>“Here we go, Meri! You look amazing! Hope I don’t mess this up—I’ve got a raging case of gutwasps!”</p> 
                <p>With those words, Kyra effortlessly soothed Merisiel’s nerves, and with her whispered reply, words meant for Kyra alone, they strode into the room together.</p>

                <p>As with Galactic Villains, this non-randomized set of six figures is the perfect collection to jump start your Starfinder Battles collection. One of the things we’ve heard players and GMs alike ask for are minis representing Starfinder’s unique races, as there are few other science fiction or fantasy miniatures on the market they can use as acceptable stand-ins. Thus, we focused on those same races for this introductory set.</p> 
                <p>Check out all six of the figures in the set (all Medium except the ysoki, which is Small): Android Xenoseeker, Kasatha Thaumaturge, Lashunta Mercenary Commando, Shirren Soldier, Ysoki Technomancer, and Vesk Champion!</p>

                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>This array of characters should provide most Starfinder groups with enough variety to put together a party of galactic adventurers, and GMs can easily repurpose any of the figures into enemies or potential allies.</p> 
                <p>That’s it for previews of our introductory Starfinder Battles sets. Look for Galactic Heroes and Galactic Villains in game stores or here on paizo.com in late July. We and WizKids will be monitoring performance and general reception to decide what to do next, so please make sure to leave product reviews or join in the paizo.com messageboards to let us know what you think.</p> 
                <p>Until next time, Starfinders, don’t stare straight into the Burning Archipelago!</p>

                <p>Korakai hatched and grew up on those shores, running barefoot on the beaches and rocks. Each day, his mother would dive beneath the waves, holding her breath to collect shellfish, seaweed, and other ingredients that Korakai carried to his family’s tavern. There, his father would cook and brew specialties both Tien and Avistani, many a mix of both. The tavern soon became a bustling place for sailors in port, and as Korakai took orders and carried drinks, he’d catch wind of stories from distant lands that he longed to see for himself.</p> 
                <p>Every so often, sailors would complain of ill winds or other troubles, and wonder whether the superstitions that tengu could ward off bad luck were true. Whenever they’d ask, Korakai’s father would interject, “Kora, go tell your grandfather someone’s here for him.” The old tengu with the faded feathers was well known among the sailors for his raucous stories and his rituals to dispel misfortune. Though Korakai suspected that much of the time, his grandfather was putting on a show, he knew that whenever the older tengu asked for his “walking stick”—a khakkhara, a ringed prayer staff that had been in the family for generations—what followed would be nothing less than a glimpse of old Kwanlai. As his grandfather glided in a whirling dance over the deck of a ship, magical feather fan in one hand and staff in the other, even Korakai’s clumsy grasp of the Tengu language could catch words of power amid the chiming of the staff’s rings.</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <p>One day, Korakai demanded to go with his grandfather out on the seas. A ferry needed to cross the channel to Kortos for much-needed medicines, despite signs of a storm, and the captain wanted a tengu on board. At first, it seemed like they would evade the worst, but the sea changes in the blink of an eye. A rogue gust pitched the vessel, almost knocking Korakai overboard, and he reached out with his hand for purchase, finding the end of his grandfather’s staff. For a moment, he clutched the staff, his grandfather holding the other end—then, the heirloom snapped. Korakai’s hand came away with broken metal, and as the khakkhara’s rings scattered into the raging sea, Korakai fell with them. The taste of salt assailed his open beak. </p> 
                <p>The light from the surface growing distant, Korakai glimpsed a shadow moving through the water toward him: a feathered shape, drinking gourd in one hand. Korakai reached his hand out for help, but the figure was swept away in a twin current of air and water, and Korakai could have sworn he saw a bearded man and a long-haired woman in the spiraling riptide. Again, Korakai tried to swim toward the currents, but again, shadows clashed together—a serpentine creature with a mane of lightning and a pearl-scaled sailfish battled a dragon with salt talons and an invisible force that churned the water into a glaring eye. Blasted back by their conflict, Korakai resigned himself to his fate and sank into the depths. </p> 
                <p>He fell for minutes, for hours, for an eternity, the surface a distant memory. Against flashes of lightning that had no right shining this far down, Korakai glimpsed gods, spirits, and more primordial things. Yet he saw that each shape, no matter how powerful, always coalesced from the same elements, and always returned to them once their business was done. In that moment, Korakai understood something, and with a peal of thunder, he broke the surface of the water.</p> 
                <p>On deck, Korakai coughed out seawater. The storm had ended, and though the sails were torn, the crew was miraculously unharmed. The sailors cheered for Korakai’s grandfather, thinking he had warded off the tempest, but the two tengu knew that it was no jinx-eating superstition to thank, but something deeper; the storm hadn’t passed at all, it had come to reside within Korakai. As he released his grip on the now-broken staff, sparks danced between his talons. </p> 
                <p>In the years that followed, Korakai learned how to channel and direct—never command—the powers he had discovered in the tempest. As his grandfather grew older, Korakai helped more and more with the elder tengu’s duties, and when he passed peacefully in his sleep one spring evening, sailors came from far and wide to witness Korakai return his ashes to the sea, each ship releasing a paper lantern to float across the waves in his memory. Not long thereafter, Korakai decided to leave the island. His parents were supportive; after all, they had crossed half of Golarion once before, why should they object to their son doing the same? Taking up his grandfather’s broken staff, Korakai boarded the next ship out, trading the promise of good luck for passage to distant ports.</p> 
                <p>Now, Korakai wanders the world with nothing more than the desire to see new sights and collect new experiences, above all hoping to one day visit Kwanlai for himself. Yet even so, he writes home often, sending coin for the tavern when he can, knowing that the beach he grew up on is but an ocean away.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">We at Paizo strive to represent our company’s values of inclusivity through the content of our Pathfinder and Starfinder publications. Showcasing diversity in the stories of the cultures, races, sexualities, and gender identities of our characters is something we’ve tried to emphasize since the company’s inception 18 years ago. As we wrote in our public statement earlier this month about the Black Lives Matter movement, it’s an ongoing and vital process.</p> 
                <p>The murder of George Floyd by police and the resulting political actions, increased visibility around issues of police brutality, and ongoing conversation about the role of policing in our society casts a difficult light upon Agents of Edgewatch, our upcoming Pathfinder Adventure Path in which players take on the roles of members of the city watch in a vast fantasy metropolis. As Paizo’s publisher, I want to take this opportunity to address the situation directly.</p> 
                <p>When we began work early last year on Agents of Edgewatch, we conceived of the adventures as a pseudo-Victorian crime drama in which a party of Sherlock Holmeses would bring a cult of sinister murderers to justice against the backdrop of a World’s Fair-style celebration in Absalom, the huge city at the center of the Pathfinder world. Along the way, we’d dabble in some buddy cop movie tropes and use the players’ role as new and idealistic town guards as a framing device for a tour of the city as they attempt to thwart the evil cult’s machinations.</p> 
                <p>In our heads, this was a classic detective story, not a chance for players to act out power fantasies of being militarized police officers oppressing citizens. As publisher, I was confident that we could steer well clear of egregious parallels to modern police violence and handle the material responsibly.</p> 
                <p>But there’s more to it than that. What I hadn't realized—no doubt a result of my own privilege—is that the very concept of police, the idea of in fact taking on the role of police, makes some members of the Paizo community deeply uncomfortable, no matter how deftly we might try to pull off the execution.</p> 
                <p>While I remain proud of the work we as a team have put into the Agents of Edgewatch campaign, and I believe that our writers, developers, and editors have ensured that the subject matter has been handled responsibly, I also believe that if we were making the decision about Adventure Path themes today, we would have chosen to go forward with a different idea, or a different take on a similar detective-story theme. For many of us here at Paizo, our understanding has evolved, not just of the horrible impact of police violence, but how some members of our community—especially those who are also members of the Black community—have not had the luxury of ignoring it.</p> 
                <p>To that end, I should acknowledge that some members of our staff did raise concerns about the campaign’s theme early on. In retrospect, I did not give these concerns the full audience that they deserved, and I regret this oversight. That’s part of the learning process, too.</p> 
                <p>I remain confident in our ability to create a campaign that lives up to our editorial and moral standards—even while acknowledging that we should have chosen a different approach for this Adventure Path. The events of the Agents of Edgewatch campaign assume empathic, heroic player characters who are there to serve their community. Groups who wish to play the campaign without taking on the role of city guards will be able to remove the law-enforcement element from the story without much work, instead telling the heroic tale of a band of local adventurers who take it upon themselves to rid the city of murderers and evil cultists. The free <em>Agents of Edgewatch Player’s Guide</em> (scheduled to release next week) will offer several suggestions on how to do this, as well as tips on how to utilize and adapt Pathfinder’s non-combat conflict-resolution mechanics as well as non-lethal combat rules when running the campaign.</p> 
                <p>I’d like to acknowledge the efforts of our editing team, who have been exemplary in helping us to eliminate unintentionally problematic elements, consult with sensitivity readers, and ensure that products come with detailed content warnings. The developers have likewise been striving to be more sensitive to these concerns. I hope that Agents of Edgewatch as a whole will display our ability to listen and present the subject matter respectfully. We will continue to strive to improve our sensitivity and ensure our adventure and plot elements remain firmly in the realm of fantasy.</p> 
                <p>While we cannot afford to cancel or delay the Adventure Path, we want to show our commitment to remedying our earlier choices through action. As we stated in a previous blog, we’ve contributed the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> to Humble Bundle’s <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/fight-for-racial-justice-bundle" target="_blank">Fight for Racial Justice</a> charity fundraising campaign, which has already raised more than $3,700,000 for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Race Forward, and the Bail Project. Furthermore, Paizo will donate a portion of proceeds from all volumes of the Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path sold through the end of 2021 to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Lastly, next month, we’ll announce another major fundraising effort focused squarely on Paizo’s products, with charity proceeds to benefit Black-oriented charities. We hope you will join us in these efforts.</p> 
                <p>We remain committed to the ideals of inclusivity and racial justice. We will continue to listen and will strive to do better in the future.</p>

                <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, June 28, 4:30 p.m.</h2> 
                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Juneteenth is a holiday that doesn’t get the recognition or celebration it deserves. We celebrate the Emancipation Proclamation as when enslaved African Americans were freed in the United States. But the road there was a lot more complicated—emancipation took years to happen. Juneteenth is the day we celebrate the true end of slavery in the US, or at least the day the last of the slaves in the country were told that they were free, which came more than two and¬ a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. This Juneteenth, we wanted to take the time to introduce the holiday to those who may not be as familiar with it.</p> 
                <p>On September 22, 1862, President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863. This was one of the most important moments in our nation’s history, but despite what we may have learned in school, this wasn’t the end of slavery. Particularly in states still in rebellion, the only freedom was in escaping to the Union, a tremendously dangerous journey. It wasn’t until the end of the Civil War that the Confederate states were forced to comply with the newly ratified Thirteenth Amendment (which was passed in January of 1865, but didn’t go into effect until December of that year). Even then, the news traveled slowly, and some states refused to even tell slaves that they were free. It wasn’t until Texas, the last holdout, finally complied that the slavery in the United States of the time came to an end (though modern-day slavery that disproportionally targets Black people still exists through our prison system and laws that allow it as punishment for crimes). On June 19th, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger issued the following order to the people of Texas:</p> 
                <blockquote>
                 <p></p>“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”
                 <p></p> 
                 <p style="text-align:right">—General Order No. 3; Galveston Texas, June 19, 1865<br> <a href="https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/juneteenth.html" target="_blank">https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/juneteenth.html</a></p> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p>Growing up outside the Black community, I was taught that the Emancipation Proclamation was the end of slavery. It wasn’t. It’s easy for many of us to think that emancipation happened quickly and easily. It didn’t. It took over two and half years after the proclamation for the enslaved people of Texas to be freed—and to this day, we are still struggling with the horrific legacy of slavery, and the treatment of the Black community is far from equal. This second—and in my opinion the true, Independence Day—should always have been a major national holiday. It is one of the most important days in our history, yet we as a nation have mostly, predictably, either forgotten or refused to celebrate it. Thankfully, that’s slowly starting to change. Today, 47 states have recognized Juneteenth as a state holiday or day of remembrance. But it has yet to become a major national holiday. </p>

                <p>First up, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hb?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-301-Crash-Down">Starfinder Society #3-01: Crash Down</a>, written by Paizo’s own Starfinder developer Jason Tondro. It involves the PCs experiencing an unexpected event in orbit of a planet in the Vast that leads to them needing to survive on the planet until help arrives! This scenario uses a new Survival Tag that lets both GMs and Players know the major theme of this adventure.</p> 
                <p>Second, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hc/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-302-The-Subterranean-Safari">Starfinder Society #3-02: The Subterranean Safari</a> by Jessica Catalan, has an interesting story. This scenario directly builds off the end of the upcoming Starfinder Free RPG Day product, Skitter Home. The PCs join a Veskarium military official on a hunt through the subterranean realm of the skittermander homeworld! Due to changes in timing, we couldn’t announce the Free RPG Day connection until now, but players who’ve enjoyed the story in Skitter Home can get some additional follow-up in this scenario (though it’s certainly not required!)</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <p>Besides these new adventures, the ConCurrent schedule includes lots of prior year Starfinder Society content, including higher level games, as well as Pathfinder Society (both editions) as well as Pathfinder Adventure Card Society.</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p itemprop="description">The brass-shod heels of Ambrus’s finely-crafted leather boots clack loudly off the cobblestones of the Foreign Quarter streets as he takes his morning walk. The dwarven prince and Pathfinder, Gorm Greathammer, accompanies Ambrus this day, the two long-time colleagues enjoying each other’s company and the salt-sweetened ocean air that provides a welcome relief to the pungent milieu of sweating laborers and defecating animals who fill the district streets.</p> 
                 <p>“So Dreng’s disappeared again, eh?” Gorm says, resuming the pair’s ongoing conversation.</p> 
                 <p>“Aye,” Ambrus replies, “and once again without note or explanation. I suspect he’s slipped into the group preparing for that expedition to Iobaria, likely disguised as a porter. Or Eando Kline. Did I ever tell you about the time I was in the middle of a conversation with the man I thought was Eando until the real Kline walked into the room? It was just Dreng playing one of his inscrutable pranks, but Eando and I nearly slew him, thinking we’d been infiltrated by dopplegangers!”</p> 
                 <p>Gorm unleashes a mighty guffaw, the golden clasps in his beard braids jingling in shared de light at the story. “Ah, I can see Kline’s face now! Good man, but almost as stodgy as you, my young friend!” As the man affectionately known as “Old Muttonchops” rubs the graying whiskers of said facial hair and raises a bemused eyebrow at Gorm’s use of the word “young”, the dwarf continues. “So, other than the news that my drinking buddy has wandered off, what stories do you have for me Ambrus? What legends in need of recording?”</p> 
                 <p>Ambrus snorts as he replies, “What, so you can go running off to insert yourself in someone else’s adventure? You know Zarta’s filed another complaint about you leaving her to run the faction you applied for and founded, yes?” Gorm rolls his eyes in an exaggerated gesture of amused dismissal, nudging Ambrus to get on with answering the question. With a bemused sigh, Ambrus continues. “It sounds like Calisro and Eras actually found that Iruxi city they were looking for. An entire kingdom of lizardfolk with a political system as complex and nuanced as any dwarven or human court! Thank the gods I put Eras on that mission, only Norgorber knows what might have happened if Calisro was our only diplomat present.”</p> 
                 <p>Gorm instinctively sketches the Iron Hammer of Torag on his breast at Ambrus’s mention of the dark god of secrets and murder before gesturing for Ambrus to finish.</p> 
                 <p>“Anyways,” Ambrus resumes, “I expect that between Calisro’s guile and Eras’s diplomacy, they’ll do alright. I’m more concerned with the word out of Cassomir.”</p> 
                 <p>“Ah, Cassomir,” Gorm interjects. “Is Hestia still running the lodge there? How is she? I’ve not seen the good lady in some time.”</p> 
                 <p>“Well enough, last I heard. Cassomir, perhaps less so. Hestia has noticed that her district is in the grip of some dark malaise. She suspects a cult of some dark god, or perhaps a supernatural predator that preys on mortal emotions. She’s gathered a team to investigate the matter, so I expect to hear word on what she uncovers soon.”</p> 
                 <p>‘Well then,” says Gorm, “sounds like I’m in the right place for the nonce! Now, you’ll need to tell me more about this expedition to Iobaria you mentioned, but first let me show you to this baker’s stall just down the way here. Owned by a lovely Vudran lady named Arvya who makes absolutely the best muffins I’ve ever tasted. I may have told her you’d be interested in arranging a regular delivery to the lodge…”</p>

                <p itemprop="description">At its core, Starfinder is a game about exploration and possibilities. Whether you’re excited to uncover new expressions of heroism through new character options in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0206c?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual"><em>Character Operations Manual</em></a>, explore the Pact Worlds’ closest neighbors in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-Near-Space"><em>Near Space</em></a>, dramatically expand what’s possible in spaceflight with the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hm?Starfinder-Starship-Operations-Manual"><em>Starship Operations Manual</em></a>, meet extraordinary lifeforms in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023dt?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-4"><em>Alien Archive 4</em></a>, or just blast into uncharted space with the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh8r?Starfinder-at-PaizoCon-Online"><em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a>, the past year and upcoming 12 months’ hardcover books keep bringing new reasons for excitement!</p> 
                <p>So forgive my Zo!-like theatrics in saying: “But wait, there’s more!” </p> 
                <p>That’s right! Why pine longingly for amazing 2021 content when you could playtest it this summer? Beginning in <b>July 2020</b>, Paizo is launching not one—but two—different Starfinder playtests, opening up new possibilities for your gaming experience and inviting you to become part of the creative process! Final versions of both playtests’ contents will appear in an upcoming, yet-to-be-announced book.</p> 
                <h3>A New Class!</h3> 
                <p>As a guiding philosophy when designing new classes, the Starfinder team is always pushing to expand innovative ideas and territory: the biohacker brings a new spin to the scientist trope, the vanguard weaponizes the multiverse’s fundamental energies to redirect damaging forces, and witchwarper takes a fresh approach to magic, superimposing alternate realities to create supernatural effects. Naturally, an additional class we’d make would want to meet or exceed those standards for conceptual novelty, visual wow-factor, and fun at the game table. It’s a high bar!</p> 
                <p>Enter the nanocyte.</p> 
                <p>The nanocyte’s body houses nanites in untold numbers, granting them impossible strength, transforming into tools, and coursing between obstacles to overwhelm their foes. The same nanites can reshape the nanocyte’s body to avoid harm as easily as they reconfigure features to conceal their presence or mask a lie, making the nanocyte an adept combatant and infiltrator able to manifest weaponry at a moment’s notice. Whether their powers stem from excruciating experiments, accidental infection, or voluntary symbiosis, the nanocyte’s nanites grow stronger by the day as the character evolves into a being more machine than mortal.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061720_SFBlog.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="max-width:40%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061720_SFBlog.jpg" align="right" alt="Ysoki, humanoid rat, leaning against mech"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <h3>A New Way to Play!</h3> 
                <p>Starfinder allows for so many stories and ways to play: infiltrating an embassy ball, trading shots across a shell-cratered battlefield, racing after villains in futuristic vehicles, soaring through space in elegant starships, and more! But since Starfinder’s debut in August 2017, the fans have echoed the same question: Where are the mechs? Sure, Starfinder provides powered armor that enhances a user’s natural abilities, and there are even a few larger powered armor suits that give that tower-over-the-opposition feel. Yet the game so far lacks the ability to pilot that giant robot, that titanic vehicle whose power far exceeds that of its pilot.</p> 
                <p>Not anymore! In July Starfinder will publicly playtest new mech rules, allowing PCs to jump into single-seat mechs or team up with friends in even larger behemoths to stomp, fly, and jump-jet around the battlefield! Mech combat is designed to use most of the familiar tactical rules and 5-foot squares you already use in your games, making mechs a feature you can as easily drop into a single encounter as you can build entire campaigns around them. And as you would expect, mechs represent a significant power boost, allowing PCs to take on far greater challenges than they might on their own—just what you’d expect from a system that lets you customize your mechs’ frames, limbs, armaments, power cores, and more!</p> 
                <p>Get excited and follow along for more updates! The action begins this July!</p>

                <p>One of the greatest aspects of Starfinder is that player characters can just as easily be members of strange alien races as those central to the Pact Worlds’ core, and we made sure that even this alien-centric set had a few potential PC figures in it. Whether you need a cybernetic villain to challenge your players to mining rights on a remote asteroid or a malevolent brain with an atrophied body to really test the heroes’ mental resolve, the Diasporan Space Pirate and Contemplative have you covered.</p>

                <p>Janira nods in agreement. “A vote. Exactly. Thank you, Zarta, for the suggestion. I’d better start sending messages out, if we are to get all the Pathfinders involved.

                <h2>Battle of the Pantheons</h2> 
                <p>In a <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh6q?Battle-of-the-Pantheons-Pathfinder-Society">blog several weeks ago</a>, we made a call to the community to submit their ideal pantheon for inclusion in Pathfinder Society. After several stages of selection by judges at the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Know Direction Network</a> and review by the organized play team, we’ve got four finalists to introduce to our community. Voting opens today and runs through 11:45 pm Pacific Daylight Time on 22 June 2020.</p>

                <h3>The Strings of Fate</h3> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p><b>Alignment</b> CN (N, CG, CN, CE)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b> Dream interpretation, fortune telling, and manipulation<br> <b>Divine Font</b> <em>harm or heal</em><br> <b>Divine Ability</b> Charisma or Intelligence<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Deception<br> <b>Domains</b> delirium, dreams, fate, nightmares<br> <b>Alternate Domains</b> knowledge<br> <b>Cleric Spells</b> 1st: <em>anticipate peril</em>; 5th: <em>subconscious suggestion</em>; 7th: <em>true target</em><br> <b>Edicts</b> interpret dreams and visions to support your own ends, pursue ambitious goals, seek knowledge to understand what is likely to come<br> <b>Anathema</b> engage in games of random chance, ignore a dream, show ignorance<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> bola</p> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p><b>Author Description</b> Devotees of the Strings of Fate understand that dreams can give glimpses of what’s to come - but can also be used as a tool to manipulate the future for one’s own ends. Those who bring good cheer, pleasant dreams, and hope for the future (even false hope) often focus their worship on Desna, while those who manipulate others through fear and nightmares choose Groetus as a patron. Those who venerate this pantheon also hold special reverence for Shyka, honoring the Eldest’s understanding of both past and future, and also Grandmother Spider, who pulled and weaved the strings of fate for her own purposes. The name of the pantheon itself highlights the core belief of worshipers of the Strings of Fate - our fate is certain, but those who can pull the strings of fate can make the most of its power.</p>

                <h3>Path of The Heavens</h3> 
                <blockquote>

                </blockquote> 
                <p><b>Author Description</b> The Path of The Heavens is well known to those who make their way in Golarion. Looking down from above, they help travellers and voyagers find their way. For some, this guidance is more spiritual. They seek to know the progress of Sarenrae, the sun, Tsukiyo, the moon, and Desna the stars, and through this knowledge gain enlightenment. Nocticula for her part uses the cover of the darkness, the gaps in between the others, to shelter travellers and outcasts. Some who worship her as their primary deity in the pantheon, seek to use the void and darkness between the stars to defend voyagers on the road. This path is frowned upon by the other members of the Path of Heavens but does not seem to disrupt the harmony between the gods. </p>

                </blockquote> 
                <p><b>Author Description</b> The Insightful Soul combines the discipline and training of Irori, strive for knowledge of Nethys, and creativity and passion of Shelyn. Other deities found within the Insightful Soul are Kurgiss (seeking physical perfection), Gruhastha (protecting knowledge and seeking truth), and Casandalee (knowledge and creation from all aspects), Inspired Souls come from all walks of life. A creative artist with a disciplined routine will continuously improve their craft; a dedicated yet free-thinking scholar can open their mind to creative solutions; a disciplined swordsman can flow more smoothly and improve their reactions by allowing their true selves to show in their fighting style. Inspired Souls spend their lives balancing discipline and artistry, believing that a disciplined mind and body balanced with the freedom to think and move expressively centers their soul helping them become their true self.</p>

                <p><b>Author Description</b> Golarion is a wild and dangerous place where many men, women, and children meet their ends well short of a full life. Those who are lost to the perils of the wilderness, famine, overcrowding, or even the mortal psyche leave behind others who loved them and grieve their absence. This collective grief brings together three disparate goddesses. Pulura is often called upon not only by the lost but those left at home whose loved ones are lost at sea or in the wild. Those whose loved ones have died in drownings at sea or by taking their own lives often demand answers from Naderi. Andoletta is seen as a matronly mentor to the other two, having been drawn to them by the kindness they displayed in their efforts to console those who mourn.</p>

                <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, June 21, 4:30 p.m.</h2> 
                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>

                <p>And as usual, I suggest reading the matching <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh5s?Core-Design-Lem">Core Design article</a>.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_LemCharacterFront.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_LemCharacterFront.jpg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_LemCharacterBack.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_LemCharacterBack.jpg"></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"> Core Set Character Lem, front and back</p>
                </div> 
                <h3>Core Set Lem</h3> 
                <p><b>Best Skill</b>: Charisma (d10)<br> <b>Character Type</b>: Healer, Arcane, Divine</p> 
                <p><b>Skills</b>. What does one do with a d10 Charisma? In Lem’s case, he uses it to cast his spells, whether they be Arcane or Divine... and it’s this access to both magic types that makes Lem the most versatile character in the <em>Core Set</em>. Beyond that, in a world with lots of Charisma characters, Lem’s d10+3 stands out. His Dexterity of d8 is also notable, as it lets him use Ranged weapons, sort of, and his Acrobatics of d8+1 is a nice fourth skill—mainly for its rarity, as it’s shared only with Merisiel and Sajan.</p> 
                <p><em>Weaknesses</em>. Lem is really not good at combat, and that flaw will come up more often than most any other character weakness in the game. He gets to roll just a d4 if he gets caught weaponless, and even if he has a missile weapon, he’s still rolling only a d8 (plus the weapon) because he doesn’t have the Ranged skill. The answer is obviously to use combat spells, which at least gives him a d10+1, but you’re going to want utility and healing spells too, so you won’t have too many Attacks. Worst of all, Lem’s helper feat doesn’t help his own combat! Overall, Lem needs to be careful to always have a combat card in hand, and even then he’ll do better if he can avoid fighting.</p> 
                <p><b>Cards</b>. Lem’s strength is obviously his selection of spells (4), which he can use to fill any gaps in a party’s niches. Beyond that he’s got a pretty average sampling of cards, other than the fact that he’s very low on both weapons (1) and armors (0), pointing straight back to his weakness in combat.</p> 
                <p><em>Allies</em>: As a Diplomacy-oriented character who starts with 4 allies, Lem is well positioned to take advantage of the new Core Set baseline of allies boosting local checks. This gives him another option for helping out his friends as well as himself. He can feed these boons to his character power, use them instead of his power, and when really needed, he can use both. Which specific ally cards you’ll want for Lem will depend on your particular group makeup; they can fill in gaps and/or enhance party strengths in equal measure.</p> 
                <p><em>Armor.</em> Though Lem doesn’t have armor at start, it’s sort of important, because he needs to hold onto his cards to help people. Any armor that doesn’t depend on proficiencies, and that can be recharged to help a little or buried to help a lot is a great choice, with Leather Armor being an example.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorearmorLeatherArmor.jpg"><img style="max-width:20%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorearmorLeatherArmor.jpg" alt="Core armor Leather Armor card"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreblessingShelynsSong.jpg"><img style="max-width:20%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreblessingShelynsSong.jpg" alt="Core blessing Shelyns Song card"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreblessingPharasmasKnowing.jpg"><img style="max-width:20%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreblessingPharasmasKnowing.jpg" alt="Core blessing Pharasma's Knowing card"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreblessingSarenraesLight.jpg"><img style="max-width:20%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreblessingSarenraesLight.jpg" alt="Core blessing Sarenrae's Light card"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Cards Left to Right: Core armor Leather Armor, Core blessing Shelyn's Song, Core blessing Pharasma's Knowing, Core blessing Sarenrae's Light </p>
                </div> 
                <p><em>Blessings</em>. Shelyn should be Lem’s god of choice, because her blessings can boost Dexterity and Charisma. However, as a generalist, Lem can get benefit from almost anyone, with Pharasma being a nice choice if Lem focuses on Attack spells, and Sarenrae if he focuses on healing.</p> 
                <p><em>Items</em>. Unfortunately, the Core Set has no cards that take advantage of Lem’s Instrument proficiency. (There <em>are</em> a few such cards in <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>.) There aren’t many wands either, which should be a go-to item for his Arcane proficiency. Still, Lem can pick up Core Set items like the Wand of Flame and the ever-popular Token of Remembrance. Because of his cycling powers, he might also choose items that discard when played.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreitemWandofFlame.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreitemWandofFlame.jpg" alt="Core item Wand of Flame"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreitemTokenofRemembrance.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreitemTokenofRemembrance.jpg" alt="Core item Token of Remembrance"></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"> Core item Wand of Flame and Core item Token of Remembrance</p>
                </div> 
                <p><em>Spells</em>. Lem can use any spell in the game, so he’ll tend toward whatever your party needs (or what they’re not using). It’s usually good for him to have at least one healing spell, making it even easier to cycle his deck. And since his combat is so weak, he’ll probably want an Attack spell or two. But his bread and butter will always be utility spells. These might be generic help spells such as Aid; they might be Attack cards designed to also help others such as Acid Arrow; or they might be disabler spells such as Heat Metal. Aspect of the Monkey is also a great choice (and a lot of fun) because it improves Lem’s most important skills.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorespellAid.jpg"><img style="max-width:20%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorespellAid.jpg" alt="Core spell Aid"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorespellAcidArrow.jpg"><img style="max-width:20%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorespellAcidArrow.jpg" alt="Core spell Acid Arrow"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorespellHeatMetal.jpg"><img style="max-width:20%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorespellHeatMetal.jpg" alt="Core spell Heat Metal card"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorespellAspectoftheMonkey.jpg"><img style="max-width:20%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorespellAspectoftheMonkey.jpg" alt="Core blessing Sarenrae's Light card"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Cards Left to Right: Core spell Aid, Core spell Acid Arrow, Core spell Heat Metal, Core spell Aspect of the Monkey </p>
                </div> 
                <p><em>Weapons</em>. So what do you fight with when you just have one weapon slot? Obviously, something that you’re not going to need to discard. or even recharge, and something Dexterity-based so you can roll a d8 rather than a measly d4. Crossbows are the most likely choice. Light Crossbow and Deathbane Light Crossbow are both good options because they can be used without having to get rid of the card. Though the Heavy Crossbow is tempting, if you reload it you can’t fight with it a second time in the same round, which is a problem while you have only one weapon slot.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreweaponLightCrossbow.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreweaponLightCrossbow.jpg" alt="Core weapon Light Crossbow card"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreweaponDeathbaneLightCrossbow.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CoreweaponDeathbaneLightCrossbow.jpg" alt="Core weapon Deathbane Light Crossbow card"></a>

                </div> 
                <h3>The Power of Helping</h3> 
                <p>Lem’s main powers focus on helping other people.</p> 
                <p><b>Help, Help, Help Your Friends</b>. Like Valeros, Lem is a social animal. He should hang out with his fellows so he can continually aid their non-combat tasks. The only caveat is that Lem should make sure that the game remains fun for him: he shouldn’t empty his hand helping others—he needs to make sure that he still has some cards for his own turn. (A power feat in the Poet Laureate role can help.)</p> 
                <p><b>Close, Close, Close the Locations</b>. Lem’s local non-combat bonus is particularly useful for closing locations. In many games, you seem to get stuck with a location whose closing requirement just isn’t suited to your party. Send in the most suitable character you have, then have Lem tag along to throw in a +1d4.</p> 
                <p><b>Take +1d6 Help as Your First Power Feat</b>. Since Lem’s focus is on helping other people, you really want to improve that ability, so taking the power feat that increases his help to +1d6 is an obvious first choice.</p> 
                <p><b>Choose Support Spells, Allies, and Items</b>. Because Lem will constantly be around other people, he should pick allies, items, and spells that can help other local characters. (And as noted before, these can even be more powerful if they’re discarded, because Lem can get them back.)</p> 
                <p><b>Avoid, Avoid, Avoid the Combat!</b> While he’s doing all of this helping, Lem should also do his best to avoid combat unless he’s got his weapon and/or Attack spells in his hand. OK, that’s easier said than done in PACG, but he can certainly work toward a combat-light strategy. To start with, he should always explore the locations with the fewest monsters first. Meanwhile, he should stock up on cards that can allow him to avoid monsters that are too tough. Sleep is a nice evasion spell, but Confusion and Twisted Space are even better because they can hand off Lem’s combat to other local characters. Down the road, if Lem is still having problems with combat, take a look at the Busker role, which has a power feat that allows him to give his combat bonus to others. (Given all of this, Valeros is an obvious companion for Lem: he can give Lem bonuses in combat and in the worst case, he can avenge Lem if the bard fails.)</p>

                <h3>The Power of Cycling</h3> 
                <p>Lem is one of the best cyclers in the <em>Core Set</em>, able to quickly and easily move through his deck, primarily by recharging cards to give bonuses, but also by cycling what’s in his discards.</p> 
                <p><b>Choose Your Recharges Well</b>. Think carefully about what cards Lem recharges. They should typically be those rarely used items that give a bonus for a specific situation. Maybe he’ll get lucky and have a use for them while they’re in his hand, but otherwise, they can go to the bottom of his deck, hopefully giving him something more immediately useful. But if Lem ends up with too much of anything, he might cycle that instead, especially if he ends up with his weapon and all of his Attack spells in his hand.</p>

                <h3>The Lem Roles</h3> 
                <p><em>The powers of the two Lem roles are hodge-podges of different powers, but they each have some fun element; choose the one that suits your own sense of fun and fills the gaps in your party the best.</em></p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"> Core Set Role Lem Busker &amp; Poet Laureate</p>
                </div> 
                <p><b>Busker</b>. This role simultaneously empowers Lem personally and lets him work better in concert with others. He gets a lot better in Urban locations, adding dice, blessing rolls, and avoiding damage. He also can pass off his banes to other local characters, while in turn he gets to make the ally acquisition rolls they failed. If your adventure path is Urban-focused, this is the obvious choice. </p> 
                <p><b>Poet Laureate</b>. This role also makes Lem more of a team player, but it does so by focusing on card cycling. Lem can draw cards at the start of his turn, bury discards for bonuses after the fact, and even heal characters by discarding. If you particularly like Lem’s cycling powers, or if he’s always a team player, this is the role to choose.</p>

                <h3>ConCurrent/Origins Online Update</h3> 
                <p>We did get a bit of a monkey wrench tossed at us in the 12th hour. Last night, GAMA cancelled the Origins Online event. As we noted previously, Paizo submitted games to Origins Online, more than they could schedule. So we planned to run the overflow as ConCurrent via Warhorn and our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/FXZ2ZFW" target="_blank">Paizo Organized Play Online Events Discord</a>. What does canceling Origins mean for organized play games? Not much. We are running ALL events through ConCurrent and will recognize it as a Premier Plus event for GM recognition/achievement point rewards.</p> 
                <p>Thank you to the team of volunteers who banded together last night to help input data into the Warhorn system so we will be ready to launch <b>player signups on Saturday, June 13th at 1 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)</b>. To register, visit <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/concurrent-2020" target="_blank">the ConCurrent Warhorn Site</a> and select your games. If you wanted to GM, but missed registrations, we are opening <b>GM registration from now until midnight Friday, June 12th (also EDT)</b>. To register as GM, visit the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/KrvaEDY" target="_blank">OPF Major Events discord</a> and follow the guidelines to access the ConCurrent channels. </p> 
                <p>Come back later for the Battle of the Patheon contest update!</p> 
                <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

                <p><b>"Pathfinder: Kingmaker – Definitive Edition" Content:</b><br> <b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</b> takes players on tour through the infamous Stolen Lands, the dangerous and turbulent territories well known within Pathfinder fandom. The computer RPG revisits familiar characters and well-known locations of the "series" lore and treats players to brand new adventures, deadly foes, and unforeseen twists and turns. Fans of the fantasy pen-and-paper RPG will experience its epic, heroic universe in new ways while computer RPG gamers will discover their favorite genre in a more contemporary light, in stunning 3D graphics that bring the universe to life.</p> 
                <p><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</b> will challenge players as both adventurers and rulers as they claim explored lands and carve their kingdom from the wilderness. Kingdom founding goes beyond simple stronghold-building to become a true reflection of the hero’s character and choices made throughout the game. Each kingdom is a living thing shaped by alignment, choices, allies, and the hero’s ability to lead his or her people.</p> 
                <p>The <b>Definitive Edition</b> features all previously released DLCs:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - The Wildcards</b><br> Intrepid explorers of The Stolen Lands can discover a new playable race the <b>Tieflings</b>, harness the power of a newly playable class <b>Kineticists</b>, and booster their party with the companion the <b>Tiefling Kineticist</b>, who brings her own and rich, engaging storyline.</li> 
                 <li><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - ’Varnhold’s Lot</b><br> Just as you were claiming your first title, another hero of the Stolen Lands became a baron too: Maegar Varn, captain of the Varnling Host mercenary band and rightful ruler of Varnhold. In this DLC, you join Varn as his general, and experience ’Varnhold’s valorous history first-hand.<br> Playing a full new storyline that runs parallel to the main story, players will import the results of this adventure to their main story, facing the consequences of their choices when moving forward with their main party and storyline.</li> 
                 <li><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Beneath The Stolen Lands</b><br> <b>Beneath The Stolen Lands</b>, valiant adventurers meet with the self-proclaimed protector of Golarion and discover what secrets lie buried beneath the Stolen Lands, in a shifting labyrinth of madness where nothing is what it seems as they defend the lands against one of the most deadly enemies the world has ever seen. Enter the dungeon as your main character. Alternatively, you can wait for an invitation from a mysterious protector of Golarion as you play through the main story. The pre-set version of the dungeon is included in the main campaign, allowing you to use your character and companions to conquer the Tenebrous Depths.</li> 
                 <li><b>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Bloody Mess –</b> The name says it all – adding more blood and gore to the game as an additional option.</li>

Scenarios without this branding are stand-alone adventures that don’t tie directly to the events of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. The introduction to the metaplot is an adventure by Mike Kimmel (hey, that’s me!), titled “Year of Shattered Sanctuaries.” It’s a full-length scenario for characters of levels 1–4.</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p>Growing up in Wyoming in the 70s and 80s, Pride was a distant thing to me; something I’d see on the news a few times a year. When I joined TSR in 1994, I finally had the opportunity to attend Pride events in Milwaukee and Chicago and slowly start to understand more about who I was. Boystown in Chicago and Club 94 near Lake Geneva were glorious and electrifying, and I was like a wide-eyed kid marveling at every sight and sound.</p> 
                 <p>I came out to friends and co-workers by chance after getting beaten up by my first boyfriend. I arrived at work shaking and angry, not realizing I had blood all over my face and arms. Lorraine Williams (TSR’s owner) and Carol Hubbard (head of HR) grabbed a first aid kit and gently patched me up as I explained how my roommate beat me up. My friends instantly knew something else. Sean Reynolds, David Eckelberry, and Dori Hein helped me through a pretty terrifying time and made coming out to the world easier through their acceptance and encouragement.</p> 
                 <p>Weeks later TSR would be purchased by Wizards of the Coast and Peter Adkison, Lisa Stevens, and others ushered in a wild new work environment. Peter gathered the TSR crew together and explained the new working environment of WotC, with LGBTQIA+, Goth, Satanists, and more all working in harmony. “What if my religion doesn’t allow me to work with those people?” a TSR staffer asked. Without missing a beat, Peter said “Then you should definitely not accept the job offer to relocate to Seattle.” You could hear a pin drop…</p> 
                 <p>Lisa Stevens has continued that positive work environment through Paizo, and as Pride shines forth again I look back on all that has happened in my life and see the steady march of progress. Happy Pride!</p>

                 <p>"Hi everyone! My name is Carlos Cabrera. I have freelanced for several third party publishers for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, as well as with Paizo themselves. I am 37 years old, and I have been out as bisexual since my senior year of high school. Even before I achieved my goal of becoming a game designer, I had the honor of others in the gaming community not only welcome me, but follow in the footsteps of my coming out experience with experiences of their very own.</p> 
                 <p>I have the Cape and Islands Gay Straight Youth Alliance (or CIGSYA House) to thank for providing me with a safe space when I didn't know I needed it. What I also didn't realize—until I was much older—was how large of an overlap these two communities really had. They are very much my people, and in more ways than one. I couldn't ask to be in a better crowd."</p>

                 <p>“I think it's safe to say that RPGs have cracked my shell several times over. I've never played a male character, even before I really let myself know I wasn't a man. Starfinder's solarians gave me the grounds to explore my personal brand of nonbinary, and developing relationships bound beyond romance and rooted in a shared narrative showed me how, while I still experience it, it's not all there is.</p> 
                 <p>I love my work and my community. I'm proud to throw my voice to the sky when I need to be heard. And for anyone questioning if you might want to explore who you could be through RPGs... I believe in you.”</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“The first Pride was a riot. It was a screaming and violent stand against the forces of oppression that sought to impose conformity and silence. Those forces of oppression continue to fight us, continue to silence us, and continue working to enforce their will on us. But we will not be silent. We will not hide in the shadows. We are out. We are proud. We are celebrating who we are. The very act of public celebration is defiance against our oppressors. The very act of love we share builds up our communities. Every example of self expression shows the world that we will not fade away.</p> 
                 <p>Pride is taking a stand for who we are, who we love, and making no apologies for it. Through celebration we win. Through self expression we win. Through love we win. The oppressed stand together against our oppressors, expressing our differences and embracing each other for it. The more we love ourselves, the more we support each other, and the more we remain true to who we are, the harder it is for the forces of oppression to succeed.</p> 
                 <p>They lash out in violence against our peace. They scream slurs against our celebrations. They react with hate against our love. But that just means they will lose, for love conquers hate. But love doesn't mean we are meak. Love doesn't mean we are helpless. We too, can be violent. It's not what we want, but it's what we will do to survive. We will fight back. We will take a stand. We will maintain our way of life. Pride comes from love: from loving ourselves, from loving each other, from loving our communities. That does not mean we won't fight to defend that love. The first Pride was a riot.”</p>

                 <p>“I’m James Jacobs, Creative Director of Pathfinder, and last year I wrote about how playing RPGs over the years helped me realize I was bisexual. I also wrote, “Our world is scary, and that makes RPGs so important to me.” Here we are a year later, and the world has changed so much that it feels naive to have written those words only a dozen months ago. But that doesn’t change the fact that RPGs can remain an important way for us all to get together and game, share our experiences, and support each other, even if… ESPECIALLY if… we’re doing so virtually instead of in-person. Pride in ourselves and who we are is more important than ever—which is, I suppose, a way of saying it’s more important with each passing day. So give your friends hugs, do what you can to safely support your communities and to be secure, love and be loved, and hold your heads high!”</p>

She explained that she first started playing online pet-sites, in which she got so intensely competitive that she was setting alarms to wake up in the middle of the night to perform tasks in the game just for an extra edge. Part way though her explanation she asked, “Wait, does this count?”</p> 
                 <p>Perplexed, I asked her, “Why wouldn’t that count?”</p> 
                 <p>Her answer left a profound impact on me as an anthropologist and gamer: “Because mostly girls play those.”</p> 
                 <p> I analyzed that statement a million ways, but I think it bothered me so much because I realized that a lot of the identity questions I was exploring in gender and gaming came down to that question: do we count? Getting to be a part of the gaming industry myself now, I constantly think of my own identity and all those individuals who talked to me about their experience in gaming subcultures. I hope to always be a part of projects that constantly reinforce that yes, you do count.”</p>

                 <p>“Hi, everyone! I'm a freelance writer who's worked on Paizo projects for Pathfinder 1E, 2E, and Starfinder, including SFS #2-08: The Stumbling Society, Part 2: Sangoro's Gifts and a bunch of things that are still upcoming. I'm also bisexual and demisexual, and feel like I had an unorthodox journey to realizing both of those things. I didn't actually realize I was bi until well after I was in a happily committed monogamous relationship, and for awhile after that, I wasn't sure if I "counted" as part of the LGBTQ+ community as a cis bi woman partnered with a cis man.</p> 
                 <p>Part of what helped was hearing from other bi people with similar experiences, which just goes to show why greater representation and visibility is so important. It's a scary time for so many people right now, and it can help to escape for a little while to another world less encumbered by the prejudices of ours. Seeing characters of numerous orientations and gender identities included in gaming products means a lot to me. It's a signal to the wider audience, especially those who might be queer or questioning themselves, that we exist, and we have stories too.”</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“I came to roleplaying games largely after I’d figured out my bisexuality, so for me gaming isn’t so much a story of discovery as it is one of getting to live out my fantasies of a world where I can truly be my best self. Literally no character I have ever created is both heterosexual and cisgender. I consider part of my responsibility at Paizo, with whatever platform this position gives me, to make sure our products aren’t just inclusive, but progressive.</p> 
                 <p>I’m very lucky that I have a family who has always accepted me for who I am. I know many others don’t have that, and that we find our own families through these spaces. It’s important that we as a community continue to use our positions to affirm truths: that queer people are people, and they’re here, and they’re not obligated to hide; that trans lives matter and trans rights are human rights; and that coming out is neither the start nor end of someone’s journey.”</p>

                 <p>Always living in the shadows is hard when you’re a clever and regal creature like a kobold. Now it’s time to make a name for yourself and bring honor and prestige to your clan. </p>
                 <p> </p>
                 <p>In <em>Little Trouble in Big Absalom</em>, you take on the role of one of five kobolds from the Hookclaw clan tasked with exploring a treasure-laden vault discovered by a team of Hookclaw diggers. Enticed by the potential wealth, the kobolds brave terrible dangers in what turns out to be a *spoiler* before being asked by the kind old lady to retrieve her magical hedge trimmer from a neighbor’s garden. </p> 
                 <p><em>Little Trouble in Big Absalom</em> includes two mini adventures that can be played back to back or alone—filling as much or as little time as you have for madcap adventure. In addition, the five pregenerated kobold characters provide a preview of the upcoming <em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em> in this exciting offering for Free RPG Day! Grab some dice and some friends and play the role of determined kobolds! </p>

                 <p>Even the most helpful six-armed heroes sometimes need a little rest and relaxation. But while on vacation to their homeworld, our veteran skittermanders come face-to-face with a threat far more dangerous than they could have expected. Once again, this fuzzy crew must save the day! </p> 
                 <p>In these unique adventures, players can tackle two harrowing incidents in any order they wish, or they can play them separately as standalone sessions. In the first, they party at Reetamander, a festival celebrating a lunar eclipse on the skittermanders’ homeworld, but are forced to confront a villain who attempts to sabotage the festivities. In the second, their underground hunting expedition turns into a rescue mission when stridermanders—massive, terrifying cousins of the skittermander species—wreak havoc in the caves.</p> 
                 <p>In addition to these versatile adventures, this book includes four pregenerated characters that are ready to play, with full stat blocks and backstories. The inside covers include all of the maps needed for this adventure.</p> 
                 <p><em>Skitter Home</em> is a raucous affair written for the popular Starfinder Roleplaying Game. It’s intended for four 4th-level skittermander characters who are looking for some fun before jumping into action like the helpful heroes that they are.</p>

                <p>Three major groups of mythological creatures make their homes on the planes and mountains of the Isle of Kortos, so it seemed only fitting to ensure they were each represented in this set. First among them are the centaurs, who are not as openly hostile as the other two but who nevertheless keep a wide berth between themselves and the humanoids of Absalom. Taking advantage of our final “weapon swap” slot in the set, the Centaur Outrider, comes in both sword- and spear-wielding varieties, each taking up one of the Large uncommon rarity spots in the set.</p>

                <p>Next are the minotaurs, brought to the Isle of Kortos by the legendary general, Voradni Voon, in the 23 AR when he started the first siege on the newly founded Absalom. While Voon doesn’t appear in this set (though now that I’ve mentioned it, I’m sure Erik will mandate that he appear in a future release), we nevertheless couldn’t do the Starstone Isle without at least one. This is far from the first minotaur we’ve included in Pathfinder Battles sets, but is the first since the release of Pathfinder Second Edition. The Minotaur is a Large uncommon figure.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>Last among the creatures historically said to live among the Kortos Mounts are the sinister harpies, whose songs mean death to any who venture too close to their aeries. The Pathfinder Bestiary presented a male harpy as its featured illustration, so we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to represent that for the first time in glorious plastic. The Harpy is a Medium common figure. We also requested WizKids make us a “tropical” version of the same figure, with darker skin and more colorful plumage. To my knowledge, we’ve never explicitly said that harpies living in the jungle or on the rocky shores of tropical islands don’t take after the local humanoid and avian populations in their coloration, so why not? These variant harpies will be released as a promotional figure at a future date that is yet to be determined.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Not all threats on the Isle of Kortos have their own societies like the centaurs, minotaurs, and harpies do. Some are just mindless beasts created in ages past from the corpses of soldiers felled in failed sieges upon the City at the Center of the World. One such menace is the Zombie Brute, a Large uncommon figure. This gross guy features perhaps my favorite take on zombies in any medium because it has apparently ripped its arm out of its socket and now wields the appendage as a club. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>The next two figures are decidedly less person-shaped. One is a staple of fantasy gaming since the turn of the millennia, and the other is a new creation in Pathfinder Second Editon. Here is the Chu’ulothi, a Large uncommon figure, perfect for challenging parties sailing the seas or exploring the coastline of the Starstone Isle, and the Krooth, also a Large uncommon offering, also known as a crocodile eater. Since none of the players at your table are playing crocodile characters, they’ll be fine, I’m sure.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>Okay, I’ll admit it. I couldn’t quite find a fit in these themed blogs for every figure in the set. Four figures and one piece of dungeon dressing just didn’t make sense anywhere else. So here they are, to round out our previews of the set. First is the Glimmerling, an urban fey creature that looks an awful lot like a street urchin. He’s a Small common. Next is the Knight of the Aeon Star, a Medium uncommon figure. Note her crystalline sword. That’s a replica of the sword Aroden wielded. Maybe we’ll do <a href="“https://paizo.com/products/btq01zrc?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Dead-Gods-Hand">an adventure</a> featuring that soon! If you look closely at the cover of said adventure, you’ll note a statue of a famous (not to mention dead) founder of the city. Now you can include this statue in your games, especially that forthcoming adventure I mentioned before.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>Our last two figures are among the most impressive in the set, both Medium rare offerings. Behold the Naiad Queen and Balisse Angel. While not likely enemies to a band of good-intentioned adventurers, neither is a creature you particularly want to cross.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                <p>And that wraps up our figure-by-figure look at <a href="https://paizo.com/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/miniatures/pathfinderbattles/cityOfLostOmens">Pathfinder Battles: City of Lost Omens</a>, coming later this month! Next week, we’ll jump right into our very first look at the debut figures in the Starfinder Battles line, launching in July! Until then, Pathfinders, stay safe, roll high, and don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.</p>

Increasing inclusion and representation is an ongoing process, and an absolutely critical one—not just for our game company, but for our industry and all of us who value human lives and decency. </p> 
                <p>If we stand together, we can make a lasting change to the ingrained racism that has permeated our society for generations.</p> 
                <p>In the coming weeks, Paizo will spearhead a new charity fundraising initiative to directly support Black communities. We have a voice and an audience, and we intend to use both to provide aid where it is needed most. We hope you’ll join us in doing what must be done.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Sighing, Janira puts her quill down, reaching for the cup of tea sitting next to her on the desk. Cautiously she takes a sip, testing the temperature before settling back into her seat and finishing the cup. “Well, that’s done,” she murmurs at the papers before her, before glancing at the stack sitting neatly on the back corner of the desk. She sets the empty cup back on its saucer, then picks up her quill and retrieves the top paper from the stack. “Once more into the breach, old friend. Let’s get this wrapped quickly, so that we can go see how the newest initiates fared on the obstacle course. I bet Marcos the newest Envoy’s would get through fastest and I want to see if I won.” </p> 
                <h2>AcP and GM Credits</h2> 
                <p>We made great strides on resolving the issues in the AcP program. The quests are now giving the correct number of points – 1 per player and 2 per GM – as well as reflecting any bumps for Premier and Premier Plus events. Those multiplier bumps levelled out at 1.25 for a Premier event and 1.5 for a Premier Plus event. This multiplier goes with the base points for the type of adventure being run. So, playing a scenario is usually 4, becomes 5 at a Premier event and 6 at a Premier Plus event. Running a scenario earns a GM 8 points, with 10 points at a Premier event and 12 at a Premier Plus. When you look at your My Organized Play page, you will see AcP listed in two columns. The first is the base points that type of game earns. The second, on the far right, notes the amount of points you earned, ie base times any event multipliers. </p> 
                <p>What does this mean for launch? It is imminent. We found one small bug – all boons sheets generated by the program awarded them to Org Play #8. We’re pretty sure Linda needs ALL the boons and are working to fix the code so that it populates a purchaser’s org play number. Once that change is made, we should be good to launch the purchasing.</p> 
                <p>This also means we are REMOVING the free rebuild boon from those available. At this point, we plan to remove that boon <b>2 weeks</b> after we launch AcP purchases. We will include a rebuild boon on the AcP reward chart, but it will cost. If you are planning on doing any character rebuilds, I highly encourage you to do so now!</p> 
                <p>For those watching, you’ve also seen GM credit appear for Starfinder Society games – it was listing 0 for a long time – and for Pathfinder Society (second edition) tables. We fixed the Nova image display a bit ago and just uploaded the Glyph. Those should be showing up on accounts shortly. The new rating system is built and we’re getting trained on how to implement it so that we can get five stars/nova (and soon glyph) status updated via the new method. We will catch up all those who earned the status but haven’t seen their fifth star appear, so that should be resolved shortly as well.</p> 
                <p>There is one outstanding issue with Glyph GM credit that we need to resolve. That is Quests are currently awarding 1 table credit. It is not our intention that a GM can run Quests as a way to reach their 5th Glyph faster than a GM who runs scenarios. Thus, we are changing Glyps to award award partial credit - .25 as they are one-quarter of a scenario. At the same time, we are looking at modules and adventure paths and what an appropriate GM credit would be for the longer form adventures. We anticipate this will lead to several bands of GM credit based on the size/length of the adventure. These changes are ongoing and should be resolved shortly.</p> 
                <p>Whew – that was a bit of information. But there’s still more topics to cover.</p> 
                <h2>Origins/ConCurrent</h2> 
                <p>PaizoCon Online resulted in running over 1200 games – many more than we would run at a traditional PaizoCon. Knowing the demand for online games, we submitted 450ish to Origins Online. Unfortunately, they were only able to accept 100 of our tables. This accounts for 10% of all Origins programming, which is a large portion. But what to do with the other 350ish tables? Seeing the demand for PaizoCon, we didn’t want to cancel the tables. Instead of cancelling, we decided to run ConCurrent. It will function as a Premier Plus Con with all the associated benefits. The only difference is that we are providing HQ and admin support via our online discord server, same as we did for PaizoCon.</p> 
                <p>While we aren’t going to reopen GM signups or add more RPG games, we do have a few vacancies for GMs as well as space in our on-call pool, which will allow us to cover GM illness or those that don’t show for their tables without stress. If you are interested in assisting, please join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/yxgMsRG" target="_blank">OPF Major Conventions discord</a>, join the Origins Online channel and post in the #gm-waitlist thread.</p> 
                <p>A bit of oversight on our part led to us not listing PACS games/taking PACS organizer registrations at the same time we did the RPG GM registrations. We added the PACS tables to our schedule and are asking anyone interested in running PACS at Origins Online/ConCurrant to join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/yxgMsRG" target="_blank">OPF Major Conventions discord</a> and visit the #gm-selection tab to register to be table organizer for games.</p> 
                <h2>Gen Con</h2> 
                <p>Gen Con released information about getting our events on their schedule, so we are moving forward with requesting OPF for GMs for Gen Con. Once again, we will do registration through the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/yxgMsRG" target="_blank">OPF Major Conventions discord</a> starting Saturday, June 6th at 1 PM. We post the schedule on the server and GMs may claim games on a first come, first served registration. The current plan is to offer tables of all our programs – Pathfinder Society (both editions), Starfinder Society, and Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. Once we have our schedule, we will upload it to Gen Con systems so that they can put tickets on sale. For players interested in attending Gen Con, register to attend and view events on the <a href="https://www.gencon.com/" target="_blank">Gen Con website</a>.</p> 
                <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
                <p>We awarded a number of coins at the end of PaizoCon Online. Congratulations to the newest recipients and thank you for all the effort you put into organized play.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Since we revealed last week at PaizoCon Online what new ancestries and versatile heritages would be debuting in Pathfinder Second Edition in July’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022bc?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide"><em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em></a>, I have no qualms in spoiling anything by revealing these next few figures, which represent potential player character options included in that book. Here we have the Hellspawn Adept to represent characters with the tiefling versatile heritage. As a spellcaster, this figure seemed a good fit for variant sculpts, so we have the common Medium version wielding a staff and the uncommon Medium version with an additional spell effect in her outstretched hand.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052920_Hellspawn_Adept_A.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="40%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052920_Hellspawn_Adept_A.jpg" alt=""></a> <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052920_Hellspawn_Adept_B.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="40%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052920_Hellspawn_Adept_B.jpg" alt=""></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Tieflings are far from the only versatile heritage in the book, though, so we couldn’t stop there. Here are the Angelkin Redeemer, Changling Exile, Dhampir Wizard, and Duskwalker Ghost Hunter—all Medium uncommon figures except the angelkin, who is common—representing humanoids with angelic, hag, vampire, and monitor bloodlines.</p>

                </div> 
                <p><em>The Advanced Player’s Guide</em> also features the catfolk, ratfolk, and tengu ancestries, so naturally we included a member of each in this minis set as well! Here are the Catfolk Pouncer, Tengu Rogue (both Medium uncommon figures), and Ratfolk Grenadier (a Small common figure), ready to populate Absalom or your fantasy metropolis of choice.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>The ancestries in the Advanced Player’s Guide aren’t the first to be added to Pathfinder Second Edition since the Core Rulebook came out last summer. That honor goes to the three new ancestries featured in last fall’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide"><em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em></a>: hobgoblin, leshy, and lizardfolk (called Iruxi on Golarion). We included a fair number of hobgoblins in last year’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt8?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures-Case"><em>Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures</em></a> set, but didn’t have reference art for the other two when that set was finalized. Naturally, we’re including them here; behold the Leaf Leshy (Small common), Iruxi Defender (Medium common), and Iruxi Stargazer (Medium uncommon).</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> As with the Absalom Watch Cadet promo I shared in our first look at <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02336?Pathfinder-Battles-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em> City of Lost Omens</em></a>, I also want to take this opportunity to share two more promo repaints that fit this blog’s theme. I don’t know when or how we’ll be distributing these (we still have the figures that were supposed to be swag at PaizoCon and Gen Con from the last set to find new homes for) but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy them now and relish in the anticipation of their eventual release. First among them is an autumn-themed leaf leshy, appropriate for when the seasons change and your little plant person prepares for the coming winter. Next is a dwarf sharpshooter, a repaint of the duergar sharpshooter from two weeks ago.

                <p>That’s it for this week! Next week we’ll wrap the series up with a look at the remaining creatures, all of which call the Isle of Kortos home and are the perfect fit for Game Masters running campaigns set in the lands beyond Absalom’s impenetrable walls. Until then, Pathfinders, stay safe and may your rolls all be critical successes.</p>
