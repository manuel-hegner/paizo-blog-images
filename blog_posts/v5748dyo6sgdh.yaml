  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>This is our third installment discussing\
  \ our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/forums/organizedPlay/playtest\">original\
  \ sticky forum threads</a> regarding the transition of the Pathfinder Society between\
  \ version 1 and 2 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. In past blogs, we discussed\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9l&amp;page=last?Future-of-Pathfinder-Society-Update#discuss\"\
  >Tiers, Level Gain, and the Roleplaying Guild Guide</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgba&amp;page=2?Pathfinder-Society-2-Boons-and-Sheets#63\"\
  >Boons &amp; Chronicle Sheets</a>. This week, we focus the conversations around\
  \ converting PFS version 1 items, namely GM stars and boons, and what replay may\
  \ look like for PFS version 1 after we launch version 2.</i></p> \n    <p>As each\
  \ member of the Organized Play team focused on two issues, this week's blog includes\
  \ discussion from myself, Lead Developer John Compton, and Developer Michael Sayre.\
  \ Linda's got the week off from writing blog posts, but she'll be back in two weeks\
  \ to discuss the final installment of original thread follow-up when we discuss\
  \ Factions and Fame.</p> \n    <p>With the final installment of the blog in site\
  \ and our refocusing of each issue to the most popular or most feasible options,\
  \ we are closing down the original discussing threads. We wish to thank everyone\
  \ who provided feedback, as it allowed us the opportunity to make PFS version 2\
  \ a community focused organization. While we know we cannot please everyone in all\
  \ things, creating an organized play program that appeals to our community remains\
  \ a top goal of the team.</p> \n    <p>Looking at today's topics. I focused on the\
  \ GM stars conversion and PFS version 2 GM status indicator. Currently, the community\
  \ poll regarding what to call GM status markers in PFS version 2 shows <b>glyphs</b>,\
  \ but the poll doesn't close until December 1, so you still have time to weigh in.\
  \ Submit your vote by visiting <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgav?October-Update-PAX-Unplugged-Spotlights-and#discuss\"\
  >the October 3rd Organized Play blog</a> and scrolling to the poll at the end.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>GM star conversion is one area we've mostly made a decision on, as that\
  \ choice isn't based on the results of the Pathfinder Playtest but entirely on player\
  \ feedback, our analysis, and the ability of our technical department to support\
  \ display of GM status markers. At this time, we are not planning converting GM\
  \ status from PFS version 1 to version 2. We've also decided not to do a weighted\
  \ model, where your first marker would be subsidized through your earned PFS version\
  \ 1 GM Stars. Many factors weighed in on this decision, but in the end, we noted\
  \ that the systems are substantially different, eighteen months into Starfinder\
  \ we already have 4-nova GMs and carrying over discourages newer members of our\
  \ community from participating.</p> \n    <p>We are currently in discussions as\
  \ to how to process 5-nova GMs for Starfinder. We would like to automate some aspects\
  \ of the process and are investigating with tech the feasibility of this option.\
  \ We also are looking at how to make the Venture-Captain assessment more objective\
  \ and standardized. In moving forward on the nova discussion, we intend that criteria\
  \ to become the standard for both novas and PFS version 2 GMs achieving their 5th\
  \ status marker.</p> \n    <p>Moving on from GM status, developer Michael Sayer\
  \ weighs in on the matter of replay:</p> \n    <h2>Replay Options</h2> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>As some number of you all reading this might be aware, we've asked the\
  \ community what your thoughts are on replay for the current PFS campaign and <span><a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2v0lv&amp;page=1?First-Edition-Replay-when-Second-Edition\"\
  >set up a thread for that discussion</a></span>. There were a lot of thoughts and\
  \ opinions expressed, running the gamut from not extending replay at all to opening\
  \ everything up for unlimited replay.</p> \n     <p>Taking all of your feedback\
  \ into account along with the prospective health of both editions of Pathfinder,\
  \ we've come to the conclusion that the \"no additional replay\" option is not the\
  \ correct path forward for the community as a whole. We believe that some additional\
  \ replay options for the current Pathfinder campaign will be necessary for the health\
  \ and well-being of those existing communities that rely on these play opportunities.\
  \ That being said, we will not be implementing any changes to replay until mid-September\
  \ to early October in 2019, and whatever replay option(s) we introduce will almost\
  \ certainly be specific to the existing campaign as a means of compensating for\
  \ the fact that we will no longer be producing new scenarios and will not reflect\
  \ potential changes for Starfinder or the new edition of Pathfinder.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>So, all that information out of the way, allow me to talk about what that really\
  \ means for our GMs and players! We've come up with three new variations on our\
  \ plans for expanded replay in the current PFS campaign once the new edition launches.\
  \ These take elements of some of our earlier suggestions modified through your feedback\
  \ and some discussions with our tech team to discover what was possible, and we'd\
  \ like your input here to help us narrow down which of these options you'd most\
  \ prefer as a community.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>Option 1: A modest, fixed number\
  \ of replays that would renew on a seasonal basis. These replays would not be level\
  \ or character locked and would give opportunities to progress new characters through\
  \ old stories or seat players who have already completed an adventure so that a\
  \ full table can be formed.</li> \n      <li>Option 2: A more generous but fixed\
  \ number of replays for all players and GMs. This would work much like option 1,\
  \ except instead of a small pool that would refresh each season, you'd get a larger\
  \ pool to spend at your discretion. However, with this option once you've used all\
  \ of your replays, that's it.</li> \n      <li>Option 3: A sliding scale, fixed\
  \ number of replays based on a percentage of total games played. This option would\
  \ work much like option 2, except instead of everyone getting the same number of\
  \ replays, the quantity of replays offered would scale up based on the number of\
  \ games you've completed. This option would likely include a weighting mechanism\
  \ whereby the number of GM stars you possess add some number of additional replays,\
  \ rewarding our most devoted players and GMs with additional replays. One distinct\
  \ benefit we see in this option is that it will help normalize the progress of groups\
  \ with a mix of new and long-time players; long-time players will have more replays\
  \ since they have fewer unplayed scenarios available to pick from, and newer players\
  \ should find that it's easier to get tables for the remaining scenarios they still\
  \ haven't played.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Whichever of these options you help\
  \ us choose will be implemented about 1-2 months after the new edition releases,\
  \ and will comprise the basis for continued play in the current campaign going forward,\
  \ so let us know which option you think will be best for you and your local gamers!</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Speaking to people at conventions, one of the most\
  \ frequent conversations revolves around PFS convention boons and what will happen\
  \ to them in PFS version 2. Organized play lead developer John Compton answers that:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Any discussion of how we're handling First Edition\
  \ benefits going into the Second Edition campaign has always juggled at least three\
  \ common considerations: established player loyalty, new player accessibility, and\
  \ ease of implementation. I explore these ideas in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lko1?Pathfinder-Society-2-Replay-Rewards-and-Rebuilds\"\
  >one of our earliest Pathfinder Society blogs about the new edition</a>, and these\
  \ have been key in our examination of how to handle First Edition boons—and when\
  \ I discuss boons here, I'm primarily referring to stand-alone boons commonly referred\
  \ to as \"convention boons\" or \"race boons,\" acquired through special events,\
  \ the regional support program, and more.</p> \n     <p>So how do boons play out\
  \ when examining these three considerations? From an established player loyalty\
  \ perspective, having First Edition boons grant some benefit in Second Edition is\
  \ typically good because it means that up to 11 years of play (and as much as 8\
  \ years of earning these boons) translates in some way to the new campaign. That's\
  \ generally a nice feeling. The several counterpoints are discouragement of <b>new\
  \ players</b>, <b>design load</b>, <b>bookkeeping</b>, and <b>volume</b>.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The more advantage a long-time player has, the more it can disincentivize\
  \ someone joining the campaign. We hope that Second Edition's campaign can serve\
  \ as a good jumping-on point for organized play, and starting people on a largely\
  \ even playing field is important to us. From a <b>design</b> perspective, we have\
  \ to balance how much time is involved in facilitating boons from one campaign to\
  \ affect the other; this is one of the reasons that creating a conversion guide\
  \ for all of the boons out there isn't feasible. Creating a whole bunch of conversions\
  \ for boons would also be tricky because they'd require a lot of on-the-ground <b>bookkeeping\
  \ </b>with trade-ins or validation, likely falling on the shoulders of venture-officers.\
  \ In terms of <b>volume</b>, we have to consider not only that some very active\
  \ players might have many dozens of boons, yet other campaign veterans may only\
  \ have a couple. Anything we implement would need to ensure that somebody sitting\
  \ on a boon trove wouldn't completely dominate the system while also ensuring that\
  \ someone who has only a few boons still feels there's some benefit to using those\
  \ boons for something in Second Edition.</p> \n     <p>When we considered the intersection\
  \ of modest cross-campaign boon interaction, a realistic design footprint, ease\
  \ of implementation for local organizers, and managing volume, we found ourselves\
  \ repurposing a somewhat familiar tool: the \"prize table\" mechanic. This mechanic\
  \ presents each player with their own set of potential prizes, which the player\
  \ can purchase with some campaign currency (such as with the Playtest Points from\
  \ our Pathfinder Society playtest). With few exceptions, there's only one of each\
  \ prize, so a player can't just buy the same thing over and over.</p> \n     <p>What\
  \ would this look like for boons? We're currently considering a Chronicle sheet\
  \ similar to the Master of Spells/Scroll/Swords sheets issued for Pathfinder Society\
  \ a few years ago. We intend one Chronicle for Pathfinder Society version 2 and\
  \ one for Starfinder Society. A player may use one sheet in each campaign. Each\
  \ Chronicle would include 5–8 benefits—most (or all) of them limited in scope to\
  \ a single encounter or scenario, some of them personal boosts, and some of them\
  \ benefits that could only be used on allies. In addition, we like the idea of having\
  \ several benefits that would grant a notably bigger benefit if the player spent\
  \ more than one boon when activating it. To use one of the benefits, you would take\
  \ an unassigned boon, mark it to show it's been expended, and check off the benefit\
  \ you used on this prize table Chronicle sheet.</p> \n     <p>For example, the Second\
  \ Edition benefits sheet might have one option that says \"Check the box that precedes\
  \ this benefit and expend a boon to gain 2 Hero Points that last until the end of\
  \ the adventure. If you expend two boons when activating this benefit, grant two\
  \ other players 1 Hero Point. If you expend three boons when activating this benefit,\
  \ grant every other player at the table 1 Hero Point.\" You expend your First Edition\
  \ \"Share the Wealth,\" \"Celestial Traveler,\" and \"Expedition Manager\" boons,\
  \ granting everyone at your table Hero Points that could avert death or turn the\
  \ tide in a tough encounter. Once you use it, this benefit would be gone.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>So how does the prize table approach to boon conversion aim to tackle\
  \ the issue?</b></p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>It presents the means to expend boons\
  \ from one campaign on another to a limited degree—particularly in ways that provide\
  \ a short-term benefit, not a permanent advantage.</li> \n      <li>By presenting\
  \ a strong initial benefit, players who have only a few boons can still get a substantial\
  \ benefit. By providing some options to expend additional boons when activating\
  \ a benefit, those with many boons still have an outlet that doesn't substantially\
  \ increase the frequency with which they can activate these benefits.</li> \n  \
  \    <li>By including numerous options (and in some cases requirements) for these\
  \ benefits to assist others at the table, these benefits can represent an experienced\
  \ player's sharing their wealth with others, not excluding other players who don't\
  \ have the same number of boons.</li> \n      <li>It places tracking in the hands\
  \ of the players by means of a downloadable sheet.</li> \n      <li>Creating several\
  \ such benefits sheets is a realistic project for the organized play team, in addition\
  \ to the other projects we're currently handling.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>We're\
  \ interested to hear feedback on this plan, which we believe is a solid solution\
  \ in handling the limited transfer of First Edition boons into Second Edition's\
  \ campaign.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Next week, join organized play lead\
  \ developer John Compton and developers Linda Zayas-Palmer, Michael Sayre, and Thurston\
  \ Hillman as they preview the November Society scenario releases.</p> \n    <p>As\
