  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Yesterday, we announced a\
  \ slate of new products set to release over the latter half of this year that are\
  \ all tied to the War of Immortals event. While I’ll get to those below, I know\
  \ the real reason you’re reading the blog, so without further ado, the identity\
  \ of the member of the Core Twenty who is going to die as part of the War of Immortals\
  \ is…</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/fecf6ab4-dc33-45fa-8fc3-4960fb11d8f2/shatteredGorum_2000.png\"\

  \ War of Immortals event. Illustration by Ivan Koritarev.</p>\n      </div>\n  \
  \    <br>\n      <p>Our Lord in Iron, Gorum! Now, the how, when, and why of this\
  \ deific death are elements of War of Immortals we’re not quite ready to talk about\
  \ yet, but we promise: Gorum is going to die “on screen” in an adventure in which\
  \ your player characters play a role. We’ll have more details about that as the\
  \ adventure’s release approaches. In the meantime, let’s take a brief look at the\
  \ slate of products coming in the second half of 2024 in which Gorum’s death and\
  \ the larger War of Immortals metaplot will play out!</p>\n      <p>First on the\
  \ list are an adventure and adventure path that have already been announced. In\
  \ July, we’re releasing <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eyz\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure: Prey for Death</em></a>, a 128-page hardcover adventure for 14th-level\
  \ characters, written by former Paizo Developer Vanessa Hoskins. In this adventure,\
  \ you’ll play members of the Red Mantis, the notorious and mysterious assassins\
  \ guild and cult of the mantis god, Achaekek, who must clear their names when treachery\
  \ threatens to besmirch their honor. Not only is <em>Prey for Death</em> the first\
  \ tie-in to the War of Immortals storyline, but it’s also the debut of the new ongoing\
  \ format of the Pathfinder Adventure product line!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \    <br>\n      <p>Also in July, we’ll kick off our 40th Pathfinder Adventure Path\
  \ (!!!), entitled Curtain Call, with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez2\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #204: Stage Fright</em></a> by veteran designer Richard\
  \ Pett. <em>Stage Fright</em> starts characters as 11th-level adventurers who, over\
  \ the course of the AP, help to produce an opera based on their own prior adventures\
  \ while simultaneously facing a new threat that only the most powerful of heroes\
  \ can stop. The connections between a theater-based campaign and the death of one\
  \ of Golarion’s most powerful deities may seem tenuous, but you’ll have to trust\
  \ us on this: the ramifications of Gorum’s death and the ensuing Godsrain affect\
  \ all aspects of the world. And players of the Curtain Call Adventure Path will\
  \ have a front row seat!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  ></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>In September, we’ll be releasing the first\
  \ of a pair of e-book short fiction collections exploring the event, a compilation\
  \ of Erin Roberts’s smash <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/theGodsrainProphecies\"\
  >web fiction series</a>, <em>The Godsrain Prophecies</em>, complete with additional\
  \ material exploring the identity and motivations of the mysterious seer who first\
  \ penned the prophecies.</p>\n      <p>In October, we’ll publish <em>Before the\
  \ Godsrain</em>, an anthology of short and flash fiction featuring four Iconic characters:\
  \ the barbarian Amiri, the wizard Ezren, the cleric Kyra, and elven rogue Merisiel.\
  \ These stories—mostly previously published on the Paizo Blog—explore the characters’\
  \ origins, character, and prior adventures and set the stage for something we’ll\
  \ chat about a little bit later.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      \

  \    <br>\n      <p>Also in October, Paizo is proud to announce the tentpole release\
  \ of the War of Immortals event, the aptly named <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02oar?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals\"\
  >Pathfinder War of Immortals</a></em>hardcover rulebook. This 240-page hardcover\
  \ (also available in special edition, retailer-exclusive sketch variant, and forthcoming\
  \ pocket edition) will introduce mythic rules to Pathfinder Second Edition, as well\
  \ as two brand new classes—the first original classes built on the remastered foundation\
  \ of the <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em>—the animist and exemplar! In addition to\
  \ loads of new character options, <em>War of Immortals </em>also explores Gorum’\
  s death and the ramifications. Most notable among these is the Godsrain: a literal\
  \ shower of the slain god’s blood, shattered armor, and divine essence that falls\
  \ upon Golarion and every world on which he was worshiped, leaving war and mythic\
  \ power in its wake. A book called <em>War of Immortals </em>would hardly be doing\
  \ its job if it didn’t explain the selfsame conflict, an extended period of conflict\
  \ in which gods struggle to survive a slew of divine deaths and mortals vie for\
  \ the newly available god-sparks upsetting the balance of power.</p>\n      <p>October\
  \ also brings our second War of Immortals tie-in adventure path, Triumph of the\
  \ Tusk, beginning with <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02sxe?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-207-The-Resurrection-Flood\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #207: The Resurrection Flood</a></em>, by Brian Duckwitz\
  \ and John Compton, and adventure for 3rd-level characters. Triumph of the Tusk\
  \ is a three-part monthly campaign in which an eclectic band of dignitaries become\
  \ battle-hardened survivalists fighting for the orcs’ homeland and independence.\
  \ “How does this tie into the larger War of Immortals?” you might ask. Well, let’\
  s just say that Gorum isn’t the only god who’s going to die during this event, and\
  \ some ancestral pantheons are going to get hit harder than others. For more info,\
  \ you’ll just have to wait until October!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ products we’re announcing today (though the consequences of the Godsrain and War\
  \ of Immortals will continue into 2025 and beyond) with two exciting new releases.\
  \ The first, <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02oal?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Divine-Mysteries\"\
  >Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</a></em>, explores, well, the divine mysteries of the\
  \ setting and provides an overview of the gods and faiths common throughout the\
  \ Age of Lost Omens, reflecting the changes to the setting brought about by the\
  \ War of Immortals. You’ll notice that Arazni is featured prominently on the cover,\
  \ and that’s because she’s graduating into the ranks of the Core Twenty to fill\
  \ the vacancy left with Gorum’s death. While she won’t take on his mantle of war,\
  \ she will nevertheless rise to more and more prominence within the setting as a\
  \ new status quo materializes.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  \ Pathfinder fiction to print with the much-anticipated <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02sx8?Pathfinder-Godsrain\"\
  >Pathfinder Godsrain</a></em> by fan-favorite author Liane Merciel. Unlike previous\
  \ novels published under the Pathfinder Tales brand from 2010 to 2017, <em>Godsrain\
  \ </em>will debut as a deluxe hardcover with wraparound dustjacket and will feature\
  \ Pathfinder’s popular Iconic heroes as its protagonists. In this exciting tale,\
  \ Amiri, Ezren, Kyra, and Merisiel will witness Gorum’s death, receive their own\
  \ nascent god-sparks, and even meet one of their patron deities as they take on\
  \ a desperate quest to prevent the greatest threat Golarion has ever known from\
  \ escaping an ancient prison. Can they use their unique talents, newfound mythic\
  \ power, and the blessings of the Dawnflower to maintain the seal on the Dead Vault?\

  \  <br>\n      <p>The advent of the War of Immortals on Golarion will necessitate\
  \ seasoned warriors, and we’re answering that call with the newly announced Battlecry!\
  \ Class Playtest, launching on April 29, 2024. During this public playtest, players\
  \ will have the chance to put two new war-themed classes through their paces before\
  \ their release in an as-yet-unannounced product coming in 2025. The commander is\
  \ a martial support class that can issue commands to her allies, granting them extra\
  \ movement, actions, reactions, and more. The guardian is an armored tank, who can\
  \ taunt opponents and maximize the effectiveness of heavy armor to be a bulwark\
  \ against nearly any threat. Be sure to try these exciting new classes out in just\
  \ a few weeks!</p>\n      <p>That’s all the announcements we have for now, but we’\
  ll have a lot more to say about these releases and more in the coming months, beginning\
  \ at PaizoCon in May. Until then, you can catch up on yesterday’s stream on <a href=\"\
