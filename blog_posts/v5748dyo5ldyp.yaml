  >Pathfinder Society Survival 101</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, October 8,\
  \ 2012</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >One of the concerns I have heard pop up lately, both on the messageboards and at\
  \ shows, is that Pathfinder Society scenarios have become more deadly. I've heard\
  \ horror stories about TPKs on the rise in various regions of the world. Let's see\
  \ if we can help combat some of that and help the new player, or the low-level character\
  \ of a veteran, with some options that may just prove useful.</span></p> \n    <p>One\
  \ of the benefits of being a Venture-Captain before this job was that I met a wide\
  \ variety of players throughout the southeast. Each and every one has their strong\
  \ points and weaknesses. One of the strongest rules players I know from my time\
  \ in Georgia was Jordan James. He survived quite a few tables I GMed, and most of\
  \ the time, it was because of brilliant use of a piece of equipment I had never\
  \ heard of or had seen used once at most. He has been discussing equipment that\
  \ makes survival easier, specifically when it comes to lower-level characters, with\
  \ the Georgia crowd for the last year through their Pathfinder Society lodge messageboards.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>After speaking with Jordan this past week, he proved excited to share\
  \ his thoughts on a few overlooked items that might just make the difference between\
  \ your low-level character surviving or going to meet Pharsma earlier than anticipated.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Jordan advised, \"Here we have a simple list of items I have found to\
  \ be ridiculously useful, and sometimes critical, to have around for those situations\
  \ that, if you aren't prepared, may very well turn into a TPK.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Please do reply with items I've missed (there will be many) because the sole intention\
  \ here is to provide a helpful thread for fellow adventurers, and to have a little\
  \ fun in writing it,\" he noted.</p> \n    <p>So, what are some things that are\
  \ just wonderful to have available in a pinch, and more often than not, are generally\
  \ not well known?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b><i>Elixir of Spirit Sight</i>\
  \ (1,000 gp):</b> From <a href=\"/products/btpy8h6h\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path\
  \ #38: City of Seven Spears</i></a>, 1,000 gp for 1 minute of <i>see invisibility</i>\
  \ and ghost touch for both your weapons and armor! Incorporeal entities got you\
  \ down with strength drains and random irritating things that ignore your armor\
  \ and halves your damage? Go to town on them with this wonderful concoction.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Bladeguard (40 gp):</b> Straight out of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> and into your martially inclined character's\
  \ inventory. This clear resin protects a weapon from harmful attacks from oozes,\
  \ rust monsters, and similar effects that corrode or melt weapons, rendering the\
  \ weapon immune for 24 hours. One pot can coat one two-handed weapon, two one-handed\
  \ or light weapons, or 50 ammunition items. Applying it takes 1 full round. Immersing\
  \ the weapon in water or similar liquid washes it off. That's pretty useful for\
  \ its cost.</p> \n     <p><b><i>Potion of Feather Step</i> (50 gp):</b> More <i>Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide</i> spell goodness, and bottled for your convenience. For 10 minutes,\
  \ you can ignore difficult terrain, and even take 5-foot steps in such an area,\
  \ oh HADES YES! Seriously, have you got one of <i>those</i> wizards in your party?\
  \ You know the type: crazy guy throwing around <i>stone call, sleet storm</i>, and\
  \ other such \"control\" spells thinking he's awesome, when all he's really doing\
  \ is making it impossible for you to move? This bottle is your answer (you can even\
  \ throw the empty remains at the wizard afterward as a free action!). Smart wizards\
  \ of the above type also keep a couple of these on hand.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1123-Treasure.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1123-Treasure_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p><b><i>Potion of Invigorate</i> (50 gp):</b> Going into\
  \ battle with a creature that can sap your endurance, leaving you fatigued or exhausted,\
  \ this potion will banish that pathetic mortal weakness and allow you to ignore\
  \ the associated penalties for 10 WHOLE MINUTES. Of course, when it runs out, you\
  \ get not only the penalties, but also an extra d6 points of nonlethal damage for\
  \ your arrogance in ignoring your natural limits—but hey, performance enhancements\
  \ are just an easy way of separating winners from losers! Honestly, though, ignoring\
  \ those penalties for 10 minutes, that's freaking awesome for 50 gp.</p> \n    \
  \ <p><b><i>Potion of Delay Poison</i> (300 gp):</b> 300 gp might sound like a lot,\
  \ but for that handful of gold, you get to tell any and all poisons coursing through\
  \ your veins for the next HOUR to sit down, shut up, and wait for you to finish\
  \ beating the stuffing out of the poor fool that thought poisoning you would be\
  \ its ticket to victory. This is like antitoxin, but sexy.</p> \n     <p><b><i>Smoked\
  \ Goggles</i> (10 gp):</b> So, medusa, basilisks, and other gaze-type critters suck.\
  \ You can avert your eyes (50% chance to avoid the gaze, 20% miss chance that round),\
  \ or close them (immune to the gaze, but then everything gains total concealment\
  \ from you, which kind of sucks). The answer: These cheap-as-dirt goggles grant\
  \ you a +8 circumstance bonus on your saving throws vs. gaze, and all you suffer\
  \ is a 20% miss chance (and a -4 on Perception checks—I know, a real deal breaker\
  \ there if you're using these for combat). More <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> goodness.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b><i>Smelling Salts</i> (25 gp):</b> Speaking of <i>Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide</i> goodness, one last entry is the useful smelling salts. These sharply\
  \ scented gray crystals cause people inhaling them to regain consciousness. Smelling\
  \ salts grant you a new saving throw to resist any spell or effect that has already\
  \ rendered you unconscious or staggered. If exposed to smelling salts while dying,\
  \ you immediately become conscious and staggered, but must still make stabilization\
  \ checks each round; if you perform any standard action (or any other strenuous\
  \ action), you take 1 point of damage after completing the act and fall unconscious\
  \ again. A container of smelling salts has dozens of uses if stoppered after each\
  \ use, but depletes in a matter of hours if left opened. That's just nifty.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b><i>Bracers of Archery, Lesser</i> (5,000 gp):</b> A wrist slot that\
  \ offers +1 to hit with a bow you're already proficient with is okay, but the hidden\
  \ gem is that it works like the greater variety in terms of providing you proficiency\
  \ with ANY bow (excluding crossbows). For characters without any bow proficiency\
  \ or chaffing under a short bow only restriction, save the feat, drop 5,000 gp,\
  \ and be happy!</p> \n     <p><b><i>Elixirs</i> (250 gp):</b> These are pretty well\
  \ known, but just in case, for a paltry 250 gp you can pack potions for a +10 competence\
  \ bonus on Acrobatics Perception, Stealth, and Swim checks. Handy, but keep in mind\
  \ the swimming one is sort of overshadowed by the <i>touch of sea potion</i> below.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b><i>Golembane Scarab</i> (2,500 gp):</b> It's a neck slot that detects\
  \ golems within 60 feet and ignores their DR with weapon, unarmed, or natural attacks.\
  \ This can be a nice little package of helpfulness here!</p> \n     <p><b><i>Pathfinder's\
  \ Pouch</i> (1,000 gp):</b> This little gem from <a href=\"/products/btpy8az2\"\
  ><i>Seekers of Secrets</i></a> functions as a small bag of holding, allowing one\
  \ to store up to 10 pounds of items within its 2-cubic-feet limit. Why is it special?\
  \ Because <i>detect magic</i> ain't got nothing on this pro—thus, a Pathfinder can\
  \ keep important or dangerous items safe in its confines with little worry from\
  \ guards, customs, and random searches. Even if the pouch is opened and turned upside\
  \ down with a shake, as long as the proper command word remains unspoken, nothing\
  \ in the extradimensional space will fall out.</p> \n     <p><b><i>Potion of Bestow\
  \ Grace</i> (400 gp):</b> For good characters only, but this can be a sweet bonus\
  \ if you happen to have the rare positive Charisma modifier (and aren't already\
  \ a paladin). For 4 minutes, you get a sacred bonus on all of your saving throws\
  \ equal to your Charisma score bonus. That's almost good enough to make me consider\
  \ being good, almost...</p> \n     <p><b><i>Oil of Weapon of Awe</i> (300 gp):</b>\
  \ For 3 minutes, your weapon not only gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, but\
  \ if you score a critical hit, it causes the creature hit to become shaken for 1\
  \ round with no save. It can't be used on natural weapons (though it can on unarmed\
  \ strikes), but the gravy is that when used on ranged weapons, it applies to missiles\
  \ fired. Loving some of these <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> spells.</p> \n    \
  \ <p><b><i>Potion of Touch of Sea</i> (50 gp):</b> For a measly 50 gp, you get a\
  \ 30-foot swim speed, +8 competence bonus on Swim checks, the ability to take 10\
  \ on Swim checks even when distracted or endangered, and even use the run action\
  \ while swimming. While this is more than enough to leave the poor <i>elixir of\
  \ swimming</i> curled up in a corner, the one caveat is that it doesn't enable you\
  \ to breath underwater, but for 1 minute of duration, you are bloody well near a\
  \ seal.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The following are from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mfq\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Field Guide</i></a>:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b><i>Air\
  \ Crystals</i> (50 gp):</b> An inexpensive personal <i>bottle of air</i>. Find yourself\
  \ underwater, in a void, or otherwise bereft of air? Pop some of these beauties\
  \ in your mouth and you've got 1 minute of breathing space to plan your escape (note\
  \ that you can't talk while chewing on these crystals).</p> \n     <p><b><i>Comfort</i>\
  \ (armor special ability) (5,000 gp):</b> Whoa. Okay, for 5,000 gp (doesn't even\
  \ take up a slot of enhancement bonus on your armor) you get armor that is always\
  \ clean, doesn't penalize you in hot weather, counts as cold-weather clothing in\
  \ cold weather, reduces armor check penalties by 1 (minimum 0), AND regardless of\
  \ what kind of armor it is, it can be slept in as if it were light armor! Note that\
  \ only applies to being slept in, but my goodness, for anyone concerned about getting\
  \ caught without their armor in the night, this is a sweet solution!</p> \n    \
  \ <p><b><i>Dweomer's Essence</i> (500 gp):</b> Casters take note! For 500 gp this\
  \ one-off pinch of powder may seem insane, until you notice that you can add it\
  \ as an extra material component to any spell you are casting and receive a +5 bonus\
  \ to your caster level to overcome spell resistance. It's like an on-demand <i>rod\
  \ of piercing</i> spell, except it's available whenever you need it, stacks with\
  \ the Piercing Spell feat if you really need that spell to land, and doesn't cost\
  \ you an action to get out a rod or an additional level to apply the metamagic.\
  \ This is the sort of awesome that I'd pay more than 500 gp for, so enjoy and keep\
  \ some in the component pouch!</p> \n     <p><b><i>Fortunate Charm</i> (3,000 gp):</b>\
  \ Anything that can help alleviate the terrible pain of lame dice is wonderful,\
  \ and this neck slot beauty does just that once per day on a failed skill or concentration\
  \ check. Since failing checks like that can often result in extremely severe consequences,\
  \ 3,000 gp for that kind of love is just sweet.</p> \n     <p><b><i>Runestone of\
  \ Power</i> (2,000 gp):</b> Wow, that's a lot of gold! Ever looked longingly at\
  \ wizards and their fancy <i>pearls of power</i> letting them get free spells? Well,\
  \ as long as you're a bard, inquisitor, oracle, sorcerer, or summoner you are in\
  \ luck! For the cost of double an equivalent <i>pearl of power</i>, once per day\
  \ (per runestone, of course) a spell you cast of its level uses the runestone's\
  \ power and not one of your limited spells per day.</p> \n     <p><b><i>Potion of\
  \ Stalwart Resolve</i> (300 gp):</b> New cleric spells to the rescue! For 3 rounds\
  \ per pop, this little gem lets you ignore ability damage and penalties to any one\
  \ ability score of your choice (unless it equals your total ability score, in which\
  \ case you're still screwed). It has a short duration and doesn't protect you from\
  \ ability drain, but when you really need to shake off some bad ability damage and\
  \ get back into the fight, this is what you need.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   \
  \ <p>Now for a few from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8dmf\"><i>Adventurer's Armory</i></a>:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Weapon Cord (1 sp):</b> Cheap as dirt and twice\
  \ as useful! If you are disarmed or drop your weapon, it never moves farther away\
  \ from you than an adjacent square and you can recover it as a swift action. The\
  \ caveat is you cannot wield another weapon with the same hand the cord is tied\
  \ to, and removing the cord is either a full-round action (untying) or move action\
  \ (cutting). Great for archers who never want to be separated from their bows.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Spring-Loaded Wrist Sheath (5 gp):</b> Retrieve any dagger, dart,\
  \ wand, or equivalent-sized object (forearm length or so) as a swift action. Let\
  \ me provide a simple example of why this is awesome. Your friend is 20 feet away\
  \ and dying. You move to her, get out your wand, are out of actions, and she dies\
  \ at your feet. With this wrist sheath, you move to her, produce your <i>wand of\
  \ cure light wounds</i> with a swift flourish, and save her life. </p> \n     <p><b>Antiplague\
  \ (50 gp):</b> Getting diseased can be really bad. Use this if you know you're moving\
  \ into an area where such might be likely. For an hour, you receive a +5 alchemical\
  \ bonus on Fort saves against disease. Even better, if you're already diseased,\
  \ this will let you make two saves (no +5 bonus though) and use the better result.\
  \ Good thing to have.</p> \n     <p><b>Vermin Repellent (5 gp):</b> Not a perfect\
  \ defense, but it keeps individual vermin away and swarms of vermin must make a\
  \ DC 15 Fortitude save to enter your square. Not bad for a 4-hour buff.</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>Allnight (75 gp):</b> Recommending \"herbs\" and \"black market items\"\
  —I love this guide! Allnight eliminates the effects of fatigue for 8 hours, during\
  \ which time you take a –2 penalty on all skill checks, and when the duration runs\
  \ out, you're exhausted. The good news: Combine a couple doses with a couple <i>potions\
  \ of lesser restoration</i> and you are the Energizer Bunny.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>And a few other generally useful items to have around:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b><i>Potion of Blur</i> (300 gp):</b> Sure, the miss chance may only\
  \ be 20%, but there are a couple nice bonuses during its 3-minute duration. First,\
  \ since you gain concealment, most precision-based damage, such as from sneak attacks,\
  \ won't work on you unless the user has some pretty special feats. Second, if you\
  \ like to be stealthy, then here is your bottle of \"hide in plain sight,\" since\
  \ this grants you that necessary concealment you need to hide.</p> \n     <p><b><i>Oil\
  \ of Align Weapon</i> (300 gp):</b> Your go-to spell when you need a weapon to bypass\
  \ DR of the evil/good/lawful/chaotic types. Three minutes per use, so it should\
  \ last long enough to even apply before combat if you know what's around the corner.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b><i>Potion of Remove Sickness</i> (50 gp):</b> For 10 minutes, you\
  \ gain a +4 morale bonus on saves vs. disease and the sickened and nauseated conditions,\
  \ or suppress effects already being experienced for the duration of the spell. While\
  \ being sickened is annoying, some diseases, and especially being nauseated, really\
  \ can make you useless, so this is a lifesaver. <i>Pro tip:</i> When you're nauseated,\
  \ you can't take standard actions, so either pour this down a nauseated ally's throat\
  \ on your turn, or hold it out and have one of your comrades do the same for you.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b><i>Potion of Negate Aroma</i> (50 gp):</b> For the sneaky types that\
  \ are sick and tired of being given away by scent, one hit off this potion and you've\
  \ got 1 hour of scentless scouting as long as you don't get doused in a new, smelly\
  \ substance. </p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>I know there are more, especially\
  \ out of <a href=\"/products/btpy8tmc\"><i>Ultimate Equipment</i></a>, but those\
  \ are a few I really wanted to throw out! Post other great options and we all might\
  \ just survive an extra encounter or two!</p> \n    <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Campaign Coordinator</i> </p>\n   </div> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags:\
