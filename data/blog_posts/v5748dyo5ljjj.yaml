  \ Program!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 13, 2017</p> \n    <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p>Happy Monday! Reading over social media posts,\
  \ it looks like Pathfinder Society events last weekend went wonderfully and those\
  \ that attended them had a great time! OwlCon in Houston, Texas, saw a return of\
  \ the Skeleton Moon, run by designer and honorary PFS Team member Stephen Radney-McFarland.\
  \ No deaths, but some difficult combat and a few sticky situations. From all accounts,\
  \ LodgeCon was successful as well and many people enjoyed playing PFS in Illinois\
  \ this weekend.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last spring, we rolled out\
  \ a Game Day initiative for the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. Our intention\
  \ was to respond to player requests for boons outside of conventions, for those\
  \ that could not afford time or money to attend a show. From the outset, the program\
  \ had issues. From it's unfortunate name, which was already being used to refer\
  \ to a one day function where Pathfinder Society was played, to the convoluted system\
  \ of goals and rewards, the Game Day initiative caused more headaches than it solved.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We went back to the drawing board and discussed the issue quite a bit.\
  \ As a result, we changed the name to Regional Support Program (RSP), which better\
  \ describes the program, and overhauled the requirements. What emerged is sleek\
  \ and simple, aimed at maximizing the programs reach while keeping administration\
  \ to a minimum.</p> \n     <p>This time the Regional Venture-Coordinators will oversee\
  \ the program. Any location running public games may apply for RSP event status,\
  \ provided they have a venture-officer associated with the location. The venture-officer\
  \ may be any rank, from agent to regional coordinator. Once the RVC receives the\
  \ information necessary to log the event, such as location, organizer, dates, and\
  \ number of sessions, the RVC will update the log form and will send the package\
  \ of boons and cards out to the organizer. The overseeing venture-officer will advertise\
  \ the event as a RSP event, so that players and GMs know if events are participating\
  \ or not.</p> \n     <p>As a RSP event, the overseeing venture-officer receives\
  \ a package of player boons to distribute to the players, as well as a GM boon.\
  \ Each venue determines their method of player boon distribution and provides that\
  \ information to players. The basic criterion is that a player has a 10% chance\
  \ per game played of earning a boon. For the GMs, they have a tiered boon three\
  \ levels of rewards. If a GM runs 6 games at qualifying events, they earn Reward\
  \ A. If they GM 12 games at qualifying locations, they earn Reward B. If they GM\
  \ 24 games at qualifying events over the course of the year, they earn Reward C.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The portability of the program becomes an asset. GMs count games run\
  \ at any advertised RSP event towards their total, but may only earn one check box\
  \ per game ran. Our graphic designer, Emily, made a fantastic tracking card that\
  \ the GM may slip into their wallet and carry with them. Thus they are always ready\
  \ to chart their progress and work towards their chronicle.</p> \n     <p>The full\
  \ policy is posted on the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/policies\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ policies page</a>. Any questions should be directed to your local venture-officer.\
  \ If you would like to have the RSP program in your area but do not have a local\
  \ venture-officer, consider joining the ranks of volunteers. To do this, contact\
  \ your Regional Venture-Coordinator (<a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/coordinators\"\
  >you can find a listing of regions and their respective RVCs here</a>).</p> \n \
  \    <p>I'm off for San Ramon on Thursday, to visit the lovely Bay Area Pathfinder\
  \ Society Lodge and attend DunDra Con. While there, my plans include running a few\
  \ games, playing a few games, and hanging out with fantastic people. If you're in\
  \ the area and don't have anything planned, consider coming out and joining in on\
  \ some games. Information for the con is <a href=\"http://dundracon.com\" target=\"\
  _blank\">on their website</a>.</p> \n     <p>With February being a short month,\
  \ scenario release is almost upon us. Join us next week for John's sneak peek at\
  \ February's scenarios!</p> \n     <p>Until thenâ€”Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>\
