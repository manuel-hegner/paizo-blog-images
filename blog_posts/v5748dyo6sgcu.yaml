  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Constructs have been a staple of fantasy stories\
  \ for decades and it's no surprise that they are just as prevalent in the world\
  \ of Golarion. These creatures include the likes of simple clockwork familiars all\
  \ the way to the colossi, towering constructs the size of entire keeps. <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq01vam?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Construct-Handbook\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Construct Handbook</em></a> takes a look at these\
  \ created creatures and provides new options for both players and GMs that wish\
  \ to build up the presence of constructs in their adventures.</p> \n    <p>While\
  \ the majority of this book is intended for GM use, the first portion of the book\
  \ does provide a significant amount of material for players. In particular, the\
  \ book contains a full break down of the rules for crafting a construct, providing\
  \ detailed information on each portion of the process. It also contains additional\
  \ construct modifications to expand on those found in <span><em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy8k8r?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Magic\"\
  >Ultimate Magic</a></em></span>. A number of new magical items also help with the\
  \ handling of constructs, including new <em>golem manuals</em> to ease with the\
  \ crafting of all new types of golems or <i>machinebane oil </i>that can slow down\
  \ hostile constucts.</p> \n    <p>Players wishing to receive their own construct\
  \ will find a few of the book's archetypes, such as the clocksmith wizard or the\
  \ construct caller unchained summoner archetypes, to be very helpful. On the other\
  \ hand, if you find yourself constantly fighting constructs, you might want to take\
  \ a look at some of the other archetypes within. A Forgefather's seeker paladin\
  \ is all about putting a stop to harmful constructs with abilities like smite construct\
  \ and the scrapper fighter can take parts from broken constructs to improve his\
  \ armor.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/20181101-SteamDragon.jpg\"\

  \   <p>The main portion of this book is our enormous bestiary. This bestiary has\
  \ several new constructs from different categories for GMs to use in their game.\
  \ Some of these include more common constructs like clockworks or golems, but also\
  \ a new construct category: the mysterious automatons! Automatons are constructs\
  \ created during the height of the Jistka Imperium and feature powerful abilities\
  \ like the stalker automaton's adaptive camouflage or the sharpshooter automaton's\
  \ energy beam. GMs wishing to continue using some of their favorite constructs can\
  \ change things up with several new templates. A haunted construct is a construct\
  \ infused with an evil soul that takes over the construct's body, while a runeplated\
  \ construct is one infused with the sin magic of Thassilon.</p> \n    <p>Luis Loza<br>\
