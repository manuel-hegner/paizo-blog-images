    \ was only recently introduced to Darkmoon Vale. Dowmberries: Although the plants\
    \ that bear them contain massive thorns, dowmberries remain a popular desert treat\
    \ when in season in late summer and early autumn. Dowmberries grow best in arid\
    \ climates and grow all over the eastern side of the Aspodell Mountains and Wolfrun\
    \ Hills. Elderwood Moss: This semi-magical moss only grows on the oldest tree\
    \ in a forest. As such, two known patches exist near Darkmoon Vale: one upon the\
    \ forest elder in Darkmoon Wood and another on the Green Patriarch within Arthfell\
    \ Forest. Elderwood moss, when prepared correctly, acts as a strong decongestant.\
    \ Some people claim that, when prepared incorrectly, elderwood moss causes premature\
    \ aging. Glowmold: As its name implies, glowmold glows. Rather brightly, in fact.\
    \ Glowmold grows very slowly on the undersides of igneous rocks, and the largest\
    \ concentrations of this useful mold live for centuries under stones too large\
    \ to easily flip or roll over. Smaller finds provide as much light as a torch.\
    \ Regardless of the size of the moss colony, picked glowmold glows for 3 days\
    \ once picked. Ironbloom Mushrooms: These stunty fungi only grow in dark places\
    \ thick with metal. The diets of Five Kings Mountains dwarves consist heavily\
    \ of ironbloom mushrooms, mainly because the plants grow naturally in and around\
    \ dwarven forges. Protein-rich ironbloom mushrooms bear a slight salty taste but\
    \ otherwise contain no flavor of their own, making them excellent additions to\
    \ many dwarven meals. Pesh: This strong stimulant also has mild hallucinogenic\
    \ properties, which together make its users easily agitated and randomly aggressive\
    \ (and easily identified, with bloodshot eyes and frequent nosebleeds). Originally\
