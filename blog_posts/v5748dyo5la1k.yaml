  \ Harrowing Experience</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 11, 2008</p> \n\
  \   <p> <i>From the journal of Mike Selinker, the first harrower:</i> </p> \n  \
  \ <p>The story of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80sv\">Harrow</a> starts as all good\
  \ stories do, with Erik Mona and a portent of doom. \"You, Master Selinker,\" he\
  \ foreshadowed, \"are being hunted by a undaunted band of brothers. A band that\
  \ cannot be daunted by the mightiest of daunters. I speak, perforce, of the strapping\
  \ young men of <i><a href=\"/pathfinder\">Pathfinder</a></i>. They are coming for\
  \ you.\" </p> \n   <p>I sought an exit, but these are <i>Pathfinders</i>, you see.\
  \ They can find anyone, and since I am anyone, they found me. From me they demanded\
  \ a boon: a tarot deck they could call their very own. Messrs. James and James and\
  \ Jason and F. Wesley believed that the world thirsted for such a deck. I was the\
  \ humble peddler of games that could slake this thirst. </p> \n   <p> \"Sa-ha!\"\
  \ I vocalized to all who would hear, \"I shall call this deck '<a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80sv\"\
  >Harrow</a>,' as it speaks of travels through the inferno, and it rhymes with 'Tarot.'\
  \ And I shall not be alone in this undertaking! If I am to walk this road, I will\
  \ have a mighty illustrator to illuminate my path.\" This depicter of souls would\
  \ be <a href=\"/store/comics/downer\">Kyle Stanley Hunter</a>, he who could pluck\
  \ from the darker planes the disturbing images that would force legions of gamers\
  \ into hiding betwixt carpet and bed. </p> \n   <p> \"I need one card,\" I posited\
  \ to Mr. Stanley Hunter, and his expression of relief was palpable, and just as\
  \ fleeting when I continued: \"One card for each of fifty-four intersections of\
  \ alignments and abilities laid upon an imperceptible grid. This is what I command.\
  \ But what shall they be?\" </p> \n   <p> \"There may be a prince of rabbits,\"\
  \ Kyle pronounced, \"and a cricket with a melon, and a queen with six legs, and....\"\
  \ I left him to his prattle, and hearkened for a woman who could detail our method\
  \ of beckoning that would strip the truth from the past, the present, and the future.\
  \ This woman was the oddly-named Teeuwynn Woodruff, an oracle of (Phila-)Delphi(-a).\
  \ \"Tell me of my future,\" I beseeched Mistress Teeuwynn, \"the future which involves\
  \ you writing most of this rulebook.\" </p> \n   <p>She set her laptop to such a\
  \ divinatory task, and I returned to Squire Bulmahn, he of the boisterous laugh\
  \ and unbending stomach. \"From you I do exact a concept for a cutthroat gambling\
  \ game,\" I invoked. He had been warned of his destiny. \"There shall be towers,\"\
  \ he declaimed. \"Oh, yes, there shall be towers.\" </p> \n   <p>Could there be\
  \ a pair of stalwarts to weave all this together, I conjectured? There could. We\
  \ would enlist yet another Mike (McArtor) and still a third James (Davis) in the\
  \ editing and graphic design of this most epic of decks. From hither and from yon,\
  \ they weaved. </p> \n   <p>Now it was done. The past, present, and future were\
  \ divined. All that remained was the ritual sharing of the stomach-turning soda\
  \ pops, and the recounting of the glories, and the filling of the requisite 500-word\
  \ count. Which is now complete. </p> \n   <p>I mean, now. </p> \n   <p>Mike Selinker<br>\
