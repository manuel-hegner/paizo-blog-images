  \ </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Propped on his black\
  \ toenails, Fumbus craned to see the bearings on the pretty brass compass. He swiveled\
  \ an expectant grin back and forth between the wizard and the wayfinder, not sure\
  \ which face was harder to read. Colder still was the reinforced door before them...though\
  \ not for long. The fuse on the goblin’s bomb was hissing shorter, apparently outside\
  \ Ezren’s notice.</p> \n     <p>“Through here?” Fumbus hoped.</p> \n     <p>Ezren\
  \ opened his mouth to answer—too late. The fuse’s hissing was sucked into that exciting\
  \ split-second silence before detonation. Then the bomb and Fumbus’s eyes blossomed\
  \ red all at once. A concussive ripple showered the companions in sparks and shards.\
  \ The door had blown ajar, the iron frame bent and peeled widest at the goblin’\
  s height. Ezren would have to squeeze.</p> \n     <p>The wizard shook the soot out\
  \ of his white hair. “I suspect so,” he coughed.</p> \n     <p>“Suspect?”</p> \n\
  \     <p>“The previous inscription led here,” Ezren admitted, ducking sideways through\
  \ Fumbus’s opening. “But I hoped it wasn’t the last.” He ignited a torch mounted\
  \ inside the door and looked around. “Oh,” he sighed, letting his staff and compass\
  \ droop.</p> \n     <p>The door had been reinforced for good reason. It guarded\
  \ a haphazard treasury, its golden texture illuminated in piles spread under the\
  \ torchlight. <em>Half</em>-hazard, more like—the reflective glow made up only the\
  \ left side of the chamber. Nesting comfortably in its midst was a chest larger\
  \ than Fumbus, who thought it odd that so many coins lay outside the container.\
  \ It was as if it had burst its seams. An impressive find to be sure, but the long-faced\
  \ longshanks looked hungry for something else.</p> \n     <p>“Mushrooms?” Fumbus\
  \ offered helpfully. He’d collected them for their brewing potential, but they made\
  \ a swell snack in the meantime.</p> \n     <p>Ezren only arched an eyebrow at the\
  \ blue fungi in the goblin’s outstretched palm.</p> \n     <p>“Isn’t brain mold\
  \ after all,” Fumbus reassured him. “I’m pretty sure.”</p> \n     <p>“Never mind,”\
  \ the wizard said. “It seems we’ve traced the writing to its underwhelming and predictable\
  \ conclusion.”</p> \n     <p>“Drawings,” Fumbus reminded him for the tenth time.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Er, yes.” Ezren pointed at the cords of tokens around Fumbus’s neck.\
  \ “Like those, I suppose?”</p> \n     <p>The little alchemist patted the tokens,\
  \ each scratched with runes to depict his formulas. Their satisfying clicks were\
  \ music to his ears. Ezren had tried persuading him that symbolic pictures and “\
  writing” were the same thing, but the goblin knew better. “Exactly,” he said, and\
  \ swallowed more mushrooms.</p> \n     <p>He noticed then that he was stuck. Slime\
  \ stretched between his foot and the flagstones. He wasn’t sure if it was reagent\
  \ residue from his bomb or drool dripped while he snacked.</p> \n     <p>Ezren had\
  \ begun pacing in the meantime, ignoring all distractions any shorter than the wayfinder\
  \ open in his hand. He let it lead, thinking out loud, “The inscriptions disappeared\
  \ with each reading. Ending here? Yet there’s no…affirmation.” He paused, stepping\
  \ back to take in the whole chamber.</p> \n     <p>“Not mine after all,” the goblin\
  \ muttered to the string of goo hanging from his fingernail.</p> \n     <p>“Fumbus,\
  \ what does the light in this chamber remind you of?”</p> \n     <p>“<em>Someone</em>’\
  s spit, though.”</p> \n     <p>“Fumbus?”</p> \n     <p>“Huh?” Fumbus followed Ezren’\
  s back-and-forth gestures comparing the glowing side of the room to the shadowy\
  \ side. “Oh. It’s like that face the Master of Spells prays to.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Indeed…” Ezren mused. He resumed his pacing, this time straight toward the shadowed\
  \ half. “A striking duality. Perhaps a clue that all is not what it seems. Because,\
  \ point of fact, the coordinates don’t end at that door, but—” His next step triggered\
  \ a faint, metallic ring that echoed around the empty slot in his wayfinder. He\
  \ froze as if afraid, thrilled in fact, and spoke an incantation. A familiar blue\
  \ glow spread in response, illuminating an unseen ledge and the zigzag of stone\
  \ steps leading up to it. The glow’s source was a new inscription, and even Fumbus\
  \ marveled at how much larger and longer it was than the previous puzzles.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Hmm…” the wizard purred proudly. “I can read the writing on the wall.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Drawings,” Fumbus corrected him.</p> \n     <p>Ezren gave no argument,\
  \ already ascending the first landing on his way to the ledge. Fumbus had been fascinated\
  \ to watch him decipher the other inscriptions, but the ritual had grown repetitive.\
  \ He was suddenly less concerned with the meaning behind the magic and more interested\
  \ in the mucus carpeting the chamber floor. It coated the gold coins like paste.\
  \ When one yielded to his tugging, he became suspicious whether it really was a\
  \ coin at all, but rather some kind of shed scale. He prepared to bite it to find\
  \ out for sure, then stopped with his cheeks spread wide.</p> \n     <p>The chest\
  \ was smiling at him.</p> \n     <p>He blinked and looked again. No, it had been\
  \ his imagination. The golden trim around the lid followed a curved pattern, maybe\
  \ even meant to resemble a sneering creature, but he was sure it was resemblance\
  \ only. Pretty sure.</p> \n     <p>From the ledge, Ezren gave a triumphant shout.\
  \ “A conjurer’s imprint! Of course. It’s the same inscription, traveling each time.\
  \ Relocating...”</p> \n     <p>Fumbus now had his nose close to the mucus trail,\
  \ sniffing and tracking it. Soon he stood knee-deep in sticky coins. The chest was\
  \ even larger up close; he could almost see his reflection in its viscous sheen.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He yelped then, high-pitched and giddy, because the chest’s golden lips\
  \ parted and a pink tongue lashed out. Long and twisted like a wet blanket, it snapped\
  \ in the goblin’s face and sent him stumbling backward.</p> \n     <p>Not his imagination!</p>\

  \ \n     <p>The chest shuffled toward him with eerie silence, as if it would maintain\
  \ its camouflage. Without taking his eyes from the creature, Fumbus called to his\
  \ companion. Ezren only hushed him back. This inscription was longer, more complex\
  \ than the others, and he needed time to unravel it. Fumbus cursed the human’s unassailable\
  \ focus.</p> \n     <p>The creature noticed it, too. It must have decided Ezren\
  \ himself was extremely assailable as a result, because it changed course, crawling\
  \ toward the stairs on at least eight tentacles.</p> \n     <p>Fumbus admired its\
  \ cleverness. To disguise itself and then prey on the distracted wizard? Maybe it\
  \ was more intelligent than he assumed. He knew from experience what a second chance\
  \ could mean to a misunderstood monster. A possible future flashed before his goggles:\
  \ shaking tentacles with the creature; taking it in; feeding it pickled whatevers;\
  \ definitely requiring it to wear a bell; putting its sticky mucus to good alchemical\
  \ use…</p> \n     <p>But now the creature slithered up the stairs, almost close\
  \ enough to grab Ezren from behind. Fumbus downed an elixir, which tasted like that\
  \ feeling when your foot falls asleep, and leaped over the creature onto the second\
  \ landing. It reached for him and he pelted it with bombs almost faster than he\
  \ could light them. Each stuck first and exploded second, like orange geysers erupting\
  \ on the creature’s hide. But tongue and tentacles kept whipping.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Drawings…” Ezren muttered up on his ledge.</p> \n     <p>The creature turned toward\
  \ the unsuspecting wizard again, craning like an actual chest on stilts.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In a panic, Fumbus prepared something different, injecting a spongy pellet\
  \ with a rolling chemical mixture. The sponge instantly swelled four times larger\
  \ and hardened in reaction, now a brittle shell filled with something hot and hungry.\
  \ Even so, the goblin risked a delay and even an accidental discharge: He hid the\
  \ ball behind his back and whistled at the creature, hoping it would take the bait.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It did. Mouth open wide to expose not treasure or goodies, but rows\
  \ of jagged teeth, it flicked its tongue and stretched its pseudopods at Fumbus...who\
  \ moved. Like a toad with a fly, the creature snatched Fumbus’s bomb from midair\
  \ and stowed it in its chest-mouth. First the split-second silence; then it stretched\
  \ wide with a muffled pop. Its tentacles shuddered. Its tongue spilled out like\
  \ steaming entrails, shriveled and white with acidic burns. Its body oozed off the\
  \ stones and down the stairs.</p> \n     <p>Fumbus sucked his teeth mournfully.\
  \ “Not so smart, I guess.”</p> \n     <p>“Oh, that seems a bit harsh,” Ezren said,\
  \ turning away from the wall at last. “Though I do owe you my thanks.”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The goblin shrugged and fiddled with his dogslicer, both pleased and embarrassed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The wizard’s wrinkled scowl softened into a smile and he pointed. “\
  Drawings.”</p> \n     <p>Fumbus clutched his formula tokens. “Huh?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Drawings! You were right after all. The inscription isn’t an affirmation or command,\
  \ but a combination lock. Read the runes wrong and they relocate, growing longer.\
  \ But shuffle them correctly and…”</p> \n     <p>One by one he touched his staff\
  \ to the magically bright symbols, but in a seemingly random order. Each glowed\
  \ brighter as he did, until the entire inscription had been activated. It shifted\
  \ then, rearranging in the order Ezren designated. The arched pattern swirled and\
  \ bled together until the runes were gone, merged into a single shape: a yawning\
  \ portal. A milky film of magic disguised where it led, but Fumbus had a feeling\
  \ it wasn’t to the other side of the wall.</p> \n     <p>That metallic ring echoed\
  \ off Ezren’s wayfinder again. He studied it, nodded resolutely, and clapped it\
  \ shut. “Right. On we go! But maybe less noise on the other side, eh, Fumbus? Never\
  \ know what creatures might be lurking.”</p> \n     <p>The goblin opened his mouth\
  \ to reply...and filled it with blue mushrooms instead.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
