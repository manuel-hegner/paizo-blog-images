  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The original, excellent, and\
  \ slightly too wordy PACG cleric.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>Because it was our\
  \ first Adventure Path, <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> was establishing baselines\
  \ both for iconic characters and also for character classes. Anyone who’s played\
  \ the Pathfinder RPG for a while knows that the cleric is a very versatile class;\
  \ to translate to the PACG, that meant giving Kyra both a d12 Wisdom and a good\
  \ Divine bonus, making her a very competent spellcaster. To distinguish her from\
  \ other primary spellcasters like Ezren, her cards list is more varied. In practice,\
  \ Kyra’s d12+2 can cast and recharge spells as effectively as Ezren, but with 3\
  \ to 5 spells in her deck, she’s going to use a variety of methods to solve problems,\
  \ including skills, powers, and cards of all types.</p> \n      <p>We also give\
  \ her the original built-in healing power (thankfully, we were eventually able to\
  \ clarify the wording). In this case Kyra can spend her explorations to heal someone\
  \ (including herself) at her location. This became the fundamental cleric-healing\
  \ power, later used by several characters. While keeping healing “local” seems obvious\
  \ to people familiar with Pathfinder, in PACG it adds a subtle, important effect:\
  \ when people get low on “health” (cards in their deck), on their turns, they come\
  \ to Kyra for help. In practice, this often means negotiating where they want to\
  \ take their turns so that they can be in the right place—i.e. Kyra’s—on her turn.\
  \ Since Kyra has a large number of blessings in her deck, she can choose when to\
  \ use them to help herself, to help others, and also when they can allow her to\
  \ both heal vulnerable party members and still make progress exploring the scenario.\
  \ As players gain mastery with the game, they learn that it’s important to figure\
  \ out when to ask for help, and also how to not waste Kyra’s entire turn keeping\
  \ them alive—classic shorter-term to longer-term systems mastery.</p> \n      <p>Kyra\
  \ is also especially good against Undead, as you might expect from a devotee of\
  \ the sun god. Her second power makes her better at defeating Undead (with weapon,\
  \ spell, or raw skill), and also helps her avoid nasty effects from before- and\
  \ after-acting powers. Adding the Magic trait is important for dealing with Incorporeal\
  \ Undead. Early in her adventuring career, this can be especially helpful when big\
  \ weapons fail to get rid of pernicious undead such as Ghosts and Shadows. When\
  \ she gets a role card, Kyra could choose to focus on various aspects of Sarenrae\
  \ as either a Healer, focusing on keeping everyone (including herself) going, or\
  \ an Exorcist, leaning more into the smashy-smitey side of things.</p> \n      <p>During\
  \ <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, we rested Kyra (be honest, if you had to choose\
  \ a character to “go piratical” for a bit, would you pick Kyra over <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lg6s?Meet-the-Iconics-Oloch\"\
  >Oloch</a> or <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lcs8?Meet-the-Iconics-Feiya\"\
  >Feiya</a>? Neither did we.) The next version of Kyra was in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy97ia\"\
  ><em>Cleric Class Deck</em></a>, where she strikes a strong balance between martial\
  \ and magical. As such, her skills and powers are quite different.</p> \n      <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/043020_ClericKyraFront.png\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Same great cards list, brand\
  \ new sword flex.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>Class Deck Kyra is notably better\
  \ with weapons, especially Swords, while she’s still able to marshal some potent\
  \ divine impact. If you wanted to bring her into Skull &amp; Shackles, she’s also\
  \ pretty capable with navigation and swimming via her Survival skill. Her healing\
  \ power takes a small hit in flexibility, but clever players can usually work around\
  \ it. When she gains a role card, she can choose between Fireflower and Wastelander.\
  \ The former focuses on the more aggressive aspects of the Church of the Dawnflower,\
  \ while the latter helps Kyra and her companions get around in the world.</p> \n\
  \      <p>When it came time to put together a group of characters for <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpy9a46\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>, we (okay,\
  \ I) wanted Kyra to be involved in the adventure into the Worldwound for two big\
  \ reasons: one, I thought it was an excellent fit for the character; and two, I\
  \ wanted to try a new approach to healing. For facing off against lots of demons,\
  \ we built a Kyra who is expert at dealing with Undead and Demons, and a master\
  \ at wielding the Healing Flame. She’s still capable of wading into melee with sword\
  \ and armor, but she has a larger selection of spells than previous versions. </p>\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Bringing the Everlight into\
  \ the demonic darkness.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>In this incarnation, rather\
  \ than spending her explorations healing people, Kyra instead adds a small bit of\
  \ healing to her divine channeling. This changes up the play dynamics of groups\
  \ facing a significant challenge, which is something that Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhm4?How-Hard-Should-it-Be-Adventure-Card-Game\"\
  >definitely can bring to the table</a>. People who were big fans of Kyra gave me\
  \ a pretty wide array of reactions at first, but as they gained more experience\
  \ with her, they usually found her to be effective and fun. When she gains a role\
  \ card, you can choose between Dawnflower’s Flare, which focuses on the offensive\
  \ power of divine fire, and Everlight’s Grace, which focuses on the healing and\
  \ protective elements of Sarenrae’s church.</p>\n      <p> </p>\n      <p>For the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7\"><em>PACG Core Set</em></a>, we\
  \ wanted to return to the “core” expression of the cleric. We adjusted to some of\
  \ the changes from the Second Edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, but also\
  \ brought the things we’d learned from publishing roughly a dozen different clerics\
  \ for PACG (and at least twice that many “healer type” characters). We struck a\
  \ middle ground between her strongest and weakest melee prowess, alongside a very\
  \ strong divine spellcasting ability and a strong personality. Her built-in healing\
  \ power still requires that you be in the same place, for a small healing effect\
  \ that doesn’t consume your ability to progress through the scenario. If your situation\
  \ requires bigger healing effects, you can invest in boons that provide them. </p>\

  \ \n      <p>She retains a version of her offensive channeling power against Outsiders\
  \ and Undead, but this version can be used to help herself and others, again reflecting\
  \ a change in approach from Pathfinder. The other skills that seemed especially\
  \ appropriate were moved to a power feat, making them a player choice. Her deck\
  \ list is adjusted slightly, but still represents a fairly even spread across all\
  \ card types—Kyra has weapons and armor, spells and blessings, and items and allies.\
  \ (And introducing the terms “heal” and “local” let us slash the word count of her\
  \ second power.)</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/043020_DawnSeeker.png\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Friendly friend, or fighter\
  \ of foes.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>When she gains a role card (level 3 in the\
  \ Core Set), she can choose between Dawnseeker and Smiter, effectively gaining a\
  \ greater specialization in either the helpful or aggressive aspects of her faith.\
  \ As a Dawnseeker, Kyra helps everyone local (including herself) with desirable\
  \ boons, and is effective against more kinds of harm. Kyra the Smiter instead is\
  \ helpful and effective against a larger variety of foes, including using Core’\
  s new avenge mechanic and helping make sure that Kyra is nearly always ready for\
  \ battle.</p> \n      <p>That’s it for Kyra today. This post is longer and more\
  \ detailed than some of the others I’ve done lately. I’m curious if people are interested\
  \ in the extra depth, if there are other topics they’d like to see (either in addition\
  \ or instead), and if, like me, you all correctly believe that clerics are the best.\
