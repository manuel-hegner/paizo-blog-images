  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The cards were going mad.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">Irhina felt their agitation thrumming through her tiny sea cabin.\
  \ It was a sharp, jangled vibration, like a dozen out-of-tune instruments all bleating\
  \ different songs. Something was coming, some great weight that sat on destiny’\
  s weaving and bent all the skeins of fate toward itself. </p> \n     <p> Shivering,\
  \ Irhina went to the porthole. All was dark through the bleary glass, save for the\
  \ rough shapes of heaving waves barely illumined by a cloudy and uncertain moon.\
  \ Distant lightning flashed through the heavy-bellied clouds. The storm was nearly\
  \ upon them. </p> \n     <p> The Sea Falcon bucked and dipped as another wave slammed\
  \ into it. Irhina's Harrow deck tumbled from the table. Nine cards spilled across\
  \ the cabin's well-worn rug. </p> \n     <p> Irhina's skin prickled. There were\
  \ no accidents in a Harrow deck. No coincidences, no mistakes. Only amateurs could\
  \ indulge such comfortable fantasies, and it had been many, many years since Irhina\
  \ had believed them. </p> \n     <p> Not since she'd been claimed by this very deck,\
  \ in fact. </p> \n     <p> Irhina shivered again. That had been a bad night. Fire,\
  \ screams, confusion. The Harrow deck's folded-paper box, sodden with her uncle's\
  \ warm blood, crumbling and spilling the lacquered cards into her hands. The stinging\
  \ thrill of magic against her skin, unwanted but impossible to refuse. </p> \n \
  \    <p> Then—a heavy duty, and a hard life. Years of loneliness with little laughter.\
  \ Those memories would swallow her easily, if she let them. </p> \n     <p> She\
  \ didn't. Here and now, she had a storm to survive. </p> \n     <p> The cards had\
  \ spilled into a rough square on the cabin floor. In a traditional reading, they\
  \ would have been dealt into three neat rows of three: past, present, and future,\
  \ with the pattern centered on a role card. Tonight, however, they'd formed a different\
  \ pattern on the shabby red rug. The cards had fallen into a sequence of three by\
  \ three, but the rows were interleaved, with no clean breaks between past, present,\
  \ or future. Some of the cards were not only reversed, but thrown sideways, one\
  \ image interrupting or obscuring another. </p> \n     <p> The Midwife. The Big\
  \ Sky. The Brass Dwarf askew: invulnerability under threat. The Carnival and The\
  \ Demon's Lantern bridged by The Tangled Briar: trickery and illusion on one side,\
  \ malicious deception on another, and a bloody history that gripped them together—\
  but whether that meant their shared history was the key to unlocking their deceit,\
  \ or merely signified that some great lie had continued unbroken for ages, was impossible\
  \ for Irhina to read. </p> \n     <p> Ordinarily, a role card would have guided\
  \ her through the conflicting interpretations. The role card, like a story's protagonist,\
  \ created clarity from a jumble of conflicting elements by providing perspective\
  \ and narrative structure. Even in a spontaneous reading, there should have been\
  \ a role card set out to anchor the other symbols in its orbit. </p> \n     <p>\
  \ But here there was none. No central figure, no guide toward meaning. Irhina's\
  \ fingers danced lightly over the cards, signaling her question. The vibration she\
  \ received in response was unmistakable: the deck did not hold that answer. </p>\
  \ \n     <p> There was only the chaos of future-past-present, all knotted together\
  \ and writhing senselessly. She could as easily have tried to read the future from\
  \ a bed of snakes. </p> \n     <p> She swept the Harrow cards back into their box,\
  \ ignoring the protest that prickled across her palms, and left her cramped cabin.\
  \ Storm or no storm, she needed air. </p> \n     <p> Above decks, the storm hadn't\
  \ broken. A strange yellow pall suffused the clouds' dark bellies, shocking erratically\
  \ brighter as lightning spidered across the sky. The great golden dome of Crystilan\
  \ glittered in the distance, reflecting the same eerie stormlight from its perch\
  \ above the coast's wave-lashed cliffs. </p> \n     <p> No, Irhina realized. Crystilan\
  \ wasn't reflecting the light. It was the source of that eerie, dazzling glow. And\
  \ the glow was intensifying, moment by moment, spilling ribbons of yellow light\
  \ across the sea and tinting the waves' white froth toward saffron. Luminous ripples\
  \ raced across the dome's immense interior, fracturing into runic shapes that strained\
  \ to create whirling diagrams before they shattered apart. </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ alt=\"A city surrounded by a cracking, crumbling crystal wall. Pieces tumble into\

  >Illustration by Federico Musetti</p>\n     </div> \n     <p> She wasn't the only\
  \ one mesmerized by the sight. Other passengers had come up to watch it with her:\
  \ a Tian woman, a Keleshite man, an Ustalavic nobleman in a fine cuffed shirt whose\
  \ shaggy, bestial features made her wonder if his line was cursed with lycanthropy.\
  \ It wouldn't have surprised her. The Sea Falcon charged exorbitant rates, but it\
  \ carried anyone who could afford them, and it ran swiftly to destinations that\
  \ other ships avoided. </p> \n     <p> She wondered if one of those passengers had\
  \ paid for the Sea Falcon to pass this close to Crystilan. The Thassilonian ruin\
  \ had mystified scholars for millennia. Within the great crystal dome, an entire\
  \ empty city stood perfectly preserved, untouched by time and impossible to reach.\
  \ Most assumed that the city and its people had fallen victim to some ancient archmage's\
  \ curse, and superstitious sailors tended to swing wide around it, afraid of being\
  \ snared. </p> \n     <p> Irhina had always thought that a foolish fancy, but now\
  \ she wasn't so sure. The city under crystal had always been eerie, but now it felt\
  \ different, aware and more intensely menacing, in a way she'd never sensed before.\
  \ It was as if some power within the dome was awakening, and was beginning to look\
  \ upon its surroundings with envious and hungry eyes. A malevolent power, she was\
  \ sure, though she couldn't say why. </p> \n     <p> Beneath the Sea Falcon, the\
  \ sea was lit up from within, so that it seemed they sailed on a lake of molten\
  \ gold. Lightning flashed from cloud to cloud, faster with each stroke, always strangely\
  \ soundless— </p> \n     <p> —until a stroke of thunder cracked overhead with such\
  \ ferocity that Irhina quailed. </p> \n     <p> Another sounded, and another, and\
  \ Irhina realized that it wasn't thunder at all. Crystilan itself was breaking.\
  \ Massive fissures cracked the gleaming dome. Shivering slabs of crystal tumbled\
  \ into the sea, throwing up geysers of saltwater and splintered stone that shook\
  \ the Sea Falcon from afar. </p> \n     <p> And inside the long-vacant city beneath\
  \ Crystilan, Irhina could see the tiny, impossible figures of… of people. Some were\
  \ human-sized, tiny at this distance. Others towered above them, so huge that they\
  \ must surely be giants. She could make out no details of language or dress, but\
  \ the sight of them filled her with unreasoning fear. </p> \n     <p> “What is it?”\
  \ the maybe-werewolf nobleman muttered beside her. His thick dark nails dug into\
  \ the railing's salt-spattered wood. He looked half a monster, but in that moment\
  \ Irhina felt a sudden sense of solidarity with him. If he was a monster, he was\
  \ at least a monster she knew. </p> \n     <p> “Upheaval,” Irhina said. “The future\
  \ tangled into the past, and the past into the future. The cards gave me a reading,\
  \ and now it begins to come clear. The old will clash with the new, and the new\
  \ with the old.” </p> \n     <p> “But what does it mean?” The nobleman's eyes glowed\
  \ yellow as he turned toward Irhina. </p> \n     <p> “The cards are but cards,”\
  \ she told him. “They do not know who the role card in this tale will be. So, in\
  \ this, they can tell us no meaning. That is for us to find.” </p> \n     <p> “\
  Or whoever's in there,” the nobleman said, looking back at the tiny figures in the\
  \ dome. </p> \n     <p> “Yes.” Irhina clasped her arms against a renewed chill of\
  \ apprehension. “Or whoever's in there.” </p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
