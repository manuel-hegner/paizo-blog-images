  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Over here at Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ HQ, we're getting very excited. The new <a href=\"/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Core Set</em> and the </a><a href=\"/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em></a> are due for release in\
  \ May. So we've got news about your PACG subscription!</p> \n    <p>Both of these\
  \ sets are part of the main <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6n?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Subscription\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game subscription</a>. If you aren't already a subscriber,\
  \ now's a great time to start. You currently have 3 choices for starting your subscription:</p>\
  \ \n    <ul>\n     <li>If you choose to start your sub with the previous release—\
  the <a href=\"/products/btpy9xdn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness-AddOn-Deck\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Wilderness Add-On</em></a> Deck—you'll also score a free copy of last\
  \ year's Free RPG Day promo character, Nok Nok.</li> \n     <li>If you choose to\
  \ start with the <em>Core Set</em>, you'll get both the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse\
  \ of Crimson Throne</em>.</li> \n     <li>If you choose to start with <em>Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</em>, we won't send you the <em>Core Set</em>; this option\
  \ is especially useful for non-US subscribers who want to get most of the subscription\
  \ benefits without having to pay the unfortunately hefty international shipping\
  \ fees for Core, which weighs in at a bit over 4 pounds.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>And\
  \ what are the benefits? Subscribers get 20% off the MSRP of their subscription\
  \ products, <em>plus</em> subscribers occasionally get free promo cards.</p> \n\

  \ of the six—the blessing The Real Rabbit Prince, the weapon The Tall Knife, the\
  \ item The Unveiling, and the ally Asyra—are in a special <em>Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</em> promo pack we're sending out to retailers as part of a special launch\
  \ kit in May. (If you're hoping to procure these from your favorite retailer, make\
  \ sure they're ordering the launch kit from their distributor!)</li> \n     <li>The\
  \ armor Corpse Plate will be available at larger Pathfinder Society events in the\
  \ next year, starting at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> on May 24.</li> \n \

  \ release <em>Core</em> and <em>Curse</em>. So we've got a special treat: goblins!\
  \ OK, sure, we've done a goblin character every Free RPG Day for years. So what\
  \ makes this year different?</p> \n    <p>We're not just releasing a character—\
  we're releasing a storybook. <a href=\"/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes\"\
  ><em>We Be Heroes?</em></a> is an 8-page storybook for the new <em>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game Core Set</em>. It's a PACG adaptation of the Pathfinder Module of the\
  \ same name being released at the same time for use with the Pathfinder RPG. It\
  \ features four new heroic goblin characters from the Crookedtoes tribe: the barbarian\
  \ Grenek, the ranger Crimsi, the druid Siathorn, and the bard Pizazz.</p> \n   \

  \ alt=\"A preview of the four new goblin character cards from the Cookedtoes tribe,\
  \ including Grenek, Crimsi, Siathorn, and Pizazz.\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>They're\
  \ not terribly good at being good, but they're working on it. Their opportunity\
  \ comes when a group of paladins get in trouble, and our heroes need to get them\
  \ out alive. Can they defeat the Blasted Chicken that squawks in their way? Only\
  \ you can help them.</p> \n    <p>Oh, also, Siathorn has this wolf cohort.</p> \n\

  \ for Free RPG Day, don't worry: starting July 1, you can get the PDF for free from\
  \ paizo.com, or you can pay a mere $3 for the print edition.</p> \n    <p>So all\
  \ that's very exciting! We hope you'll sign up for that subscription and get those\
  \ promo cards, then keep an eye out for <a href=\"/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes\"\
