The <a href="/starfinder/beginnerbox"><em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em></a> escaped into the wild yesterday, representing untold hours of Team Paizo's passionate work to bring an exciting and introductory Starfinder experience to players everywhere. No matter your level of experience in tabletop roleplaying games, the <em>Beginner Box</em> contains everything you need to enjoy the futuristic fun of Starfinder, either alone or with a group of friends.</p> 
               <p>As much as we worked to bring you this product, we're also working diligently to get the word about it out. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo's Twitch stream</a> brought you an exclusive live-play stream of a <em>Beginner Box</em> game. If you want to watch some space antics in action (and hear some wacky voices!), check out the replay video of Starfinder Developer Jason Keeley, Starfinder Creative Director Rob McCreary, <em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em> Design Lead Joe Pasini, and Customer Service &amp; Community Manager Sara Marie playing through a wacky adventure of my creation. (And if you'd like to read some of the <em>Beginner Box</em> designers' thoughts about making this beautiful product, check out last week's blog!)</p> 
               <p>But the stream certainly isn't the only way we're shining the flashlight on the <em>Beginner Box</em>. With our partners at Two Kings Entertainment, we have put together a character creation video to help players get started building their first (or second, or fourth) <em>Beginner Box</em> character. We hope this video, and the idea of creating your very own futuristic hero, will help players get started on the delightful path of a lifelong love of roleplaying—or supplement an existing passion for creativity, ingenuity, storytelling, and every other fulfilling aspect of tabletop games.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4atmxDg0poc" style="margin:2rem auto;display:block;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen enablejsapi="1" id="widget2"></iframe> 
               <p>So if you're inclined, check out the video, forge some ideas for a Beginner Box character, and let your science-fantasy adventures begin!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Keith here, to talk about something pretty darn shiny that we've added to the game. At the end of the day, we all like toys. And I'll admit that sometimes I've wanted to get them faster than the game has offered them. For instance, I love power feats, so waiting to win 10 scenarios in <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> to get my first was frustrating.</p> 
               <p>No more.</p> 
               <p>We've been hinting for a while that we did something fun with the backs of all of those markers we added to the game. Time to spill the beans: The <a href="/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Core Set</em></a> introduces a new game mechanic and resource called hero points. They do a whole lot of fun things.</p> 
               <p>First, when you are rewarded with a hero point, you can immediately spend it to gain a card, power, or skill feat—your choice. Now, you can take those feats in whatever order is best for your character and your group. Just got a fantastic loot card? Maybe a card feat is in order. Botched a vital roll by 1 and it's bothering you? Skill feat. Or take one of those sweet power feats to spice things up a bit. This new reward system increases your ability to decide how your character develops, but it does have limitations to keep things from flying entirely out of control: the number of feats you can have of each type is limited to the # of the adventure you're playing. So while you're playing adventure 2, you can gain up to 2 skill feats, 2 power feats, and 2 card feats.</p> 
               <p>So what do you do with your hero points when you're not buying a feat? Use them to be heroic! Or at least luckier. During a scenario, you can spend a hero point to reroll all the dice on your check. Just missed on your check to defeat the villain, and failing it will mean you fail the scenario, or perhaps even die? Or maybe you've found that fantastic boon you've been chasing, and you botched the check to acquire. You'll be glad to have a spare hero point for a reroll.</p> 
               <p>You might also want to keep a hero point on hand for their most powerful use: If you die during a scenario, spend all your remaining hero points at the end, and you're no longer dead. This provides a reasonable compromise between those who feel death should never be permanent (always have at least one hero point on hand!) and those who think it should always be permanent (spend those hero points on rerolls, so you're not going down without a fight). Death still packs enough of a punch to add consequence to your choices, but not so much that a risky decision or moment of bad luck might derail your entire Adventure Path.</p> 
               <p>The number of hero points you collect varies by Adventure Path, giving each a different feel. The Dragon's Demand gives you just enough that dying too much will eat into feats, so play carefully. <a href="/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> thinks you might need some of those rerolls, so it gives out a few more hero points.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-Bahor.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-Bahor_360.jpeg" alt=""></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-Ildervok.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-Ildervok_360.jpeg" alt=""></a> 
                <p>Sometimes a reroll is handy. And sometimes failure is not an option.</p> 
               </div> 
               <p>Starting at <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>, the freshly renamed <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgjj?Introducing-the-Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society">Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</a> replaces die bumps with hero points, and greatly simplifies its schedule for taking feats: every new scenario you complete gives you a hero point. This also helps cover for the occasionally missed scenario or <a href="/threads/rzs2t6k2?HawkCon-II-The-Wrath-Continues">mishap that might arise from playing with strangers at conventions</a>.</p> 
               <p>Since we're talking a bit about feats, let's talk about roles. Remember when I said I get frustrated waiting for power feats? I also get impatient waiting for role cards. And I'm not alone. There are many discussions around which order to take power feats on a character before you get your role, because you generally have to take almost all of them, and you have to play for probably more than half your character's career before you open up more options with your role.</p> 
               <p>No more.</p> 
               <p>(Okay, so that seemed less dramatic the second time. Well, anyway‚ After extensive testing and gathering opinions, we've moved roles to show up a bit earlier. In Dragon's Demand, you gain your role as the reward for adventure 2, and Crimson Throne gives out roles after the first scenario of adventure 3. And the new Pathfinder Adventure Card Society reward structure will give you your role along with your third power feat. In all three cases, that means you'll select your third power feat from your shiny new role card.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>Claws large enough to take Sajan's head clean off whispered past his shoulder, sliding through the air where he'd been a heartbeat earlier. The troll caught himself, following up with a kidney strike that could have eviscerated a horse, but too slowly. Sajan stepped inside the troll's guard, the combination flowing smoothly. Gut, gut, face, throat—his arms pistoned as he struck, the sound of each fist's impact blending with the others like raindrops in a storm.</p> 
                <p>The troll staggered backward, pushing Sajan away with a clumsy front kick, abandoning any attempt at grappling in order to put some space between them.</p> 
                <p>It was the wrong move. Sajan took two steps forward and launched himself into the air, rolling to his left. His chambered right leg shot out, heel catching the troll in the cheek with all the force of his momentum. Bone shattered.</p> 
                <p>Both Sajan and the troll dropped to the ground, but only Sajan landed on his feet. The troll lay on the paving stones, chest heaving as he blinked uncomprehendingly up at the hawks riding thermals high above.</p> 
                <p>Sajan leaned down and extended a hand.</p> 
                <p>"Again?"</p> 
                <p>"With you?" The troll accepted Sajan's hand, threating to pull the monk off his feet as he lurched upright. He reached up and shoved his broken jaw back into place with a crunch. "If I enjoyed hurting myself, I would have stayed in Kaer Maga and become an Augur."</p> 
                <p>Sajan grinned and slapped the troll's enormous shoulder. "Quit whining—some of us actually have to live with our injuries. In ten minutes you won't even remember that I hit you."</p> 
                <p>"Not true." The troll led him across the practice yard to the water barrel. Ignoring the dipper, the giant lifted the entire thing and took a long drink before setting it down again. "I won't be forgetting that anytime soon." He shook his head. "Tusks, Sajan—if that's how you fight when it's all in good fun, I'd hate to see you angry."</p> 
                <p>Sajan lifted the ladle, dribbling water over his shaved head. "That's my secret, Jora: I never fight angry. Anger clouds the mind, makes you stupid. Slow."</p> 
                <p>Jora raised one bushy caterpillar of an eyebrow. "Never?"</p> 
                <p>Memories rose unbidden: A battle. A lord. A hard woman with his own face.</p> 
                <p>Sajan frowned. "I—"</p> 
                <p>A gong rang. Both Jora and Sajan spun, snapping to attention. Across the yard, the temple's huge bronze doors swung open, unleashing an orderly procession of monks. And behind them...</p> 
                <p>Sajan bowed low, Jora only a heartbeat behind. "Master! You honor us."</p> 
                <p>The old woman approached. She was tiny, her silver hair bright against the deep blue of her sari, yet her ancient feet made no sound as they crossed the weathered stones. Her callused palm touched the back of Sajan's head, as gentle as a sparrow alighting.</p> 
                <p>"Sajan." Her voice was high and strong, forged on countless battlefields. "You've trained well in your time with us, yet the time for study is past. I have seen the path that Irori has set for you, and it is long—long before you came to us, and longer still once you leave. Yet before you go, if you would be a full son of the Hidden Peaks School, you must pass one final challenge."</p> 
                <p>Sajan closed his eyes.</p> 
                <p>"Tell me what I must do."</p>

               <p itemprop="description">When we announced Pathfinder Second Edition, the organized play team began gathering feedback from our player base and volunteer organizers as to what they liked about Pathfinder Society and what they would like carried over to Second Edition campaign. We continued this outreach in person and across a variety of digital platforms and the end of 2018 saw several rounds of blog posts collated from forum threads and surveys associated with the blog topics.</p> 
               <p>Your feedback and input were leading factors as we assessed what worked well that we wanted to keep, and how to incorporate your choices for a player-influenced campaign. Throughout our conversations, we regularly referred back to your responses to ensure that new rules addressed the community's concerns wherever possible. The process has taken some time, and more than a year has passed between the new edition's announcement and today's blog. Now that the Core Rulebook is at the printer, we can start announcing what Pathfinder Society will look like when it launches at Gen Con 2019.</p> 
               <p>It's worth noting that some of these decisions were contentious, often including survey data with mixed results that pushed us to deliberate how best to deliver a quality organized play experience while doing what we can to address opposing concerns. That said, these include changes. It's our goal that these changes strengthen the new campaign while maintaining the spirit of the Pathfinder Society, and we ask that you see them in action before judging their ultimate merit. We'll be listening especially closely for feedback from players and volunteers alike in the campaign's early months, and if something isn't working correctly, we'll be looking for ways to adjust and fine tune.</p> 
               <p>Also, there's far more for us to announce that can be reasonably fit in a single blog, so we'll be posting more updates over the next several months. You'll see a variety of organized play team members introducing organized play nuances of character building, running adventures, and factions. And even if a team member doesn't appear as a blog's author, know what we've all had a hand in creating these new policies and features. All told, a lot is coming between now and Gen Con.</p> 
               <p>For this week, we want to focus on what you earn—both as a player and as a PC.</p> 
               <h2>The Basics</h2> 
               <p>Let's introduce some terms, many familiar and a few new or slightly changed. In the First Edition campaign, you had four values that you might track: Experience Points (XP), Gold Pieces (GP), Fame, and Prestige Points (PP). In Starfinder Society, we renamed a few of these, but mostly just added a fifth value: Infamy. In Pathfinder Society's second edition campaign, there's a little more to track, but you'll see a lot you recognize from Starfinder Society in particular.</p> 
               <ul>
                <li><strong>Experience Points (XP)</strong>: These track a character's level.</li> 
                <li><strong>Infamy</strong>: This tracks how notorious a PC is for having performed evil or highly disreputable actions. Most PCs are unlikely to earn this.</li> 
                <li><strong>Reputation</strong>: This tracks how much influence a PC has in a faction.</li> 
                <li><strong>Achievement Points (AcP)</strong>: These are a player-based currency earned by playing and GMing Pathfinder Society games. These are used to access special character options and to gain special benefits tied to the campaign's rules.</li> 
                <li><strong>Downtime</strong>: At the end of each adventure, a PC earns Downtime measured in days (3 days per 1 XP) that should be spent by the start of the next adventure. Downtime allows a PC to earn additional money through a profession, craft gear, retrain character options, and more.</li> 
                <li><strong>Fame</strong>: This represents the PC's social capital, which they can spend on purchasing boons and services.</li> 
                <li><strong>Gold Pieces (GP)</strong>: These represent the PC's wealth, used to buy gear and services.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>Seven fields are a decent amount to manage. Fortunately, three of these are tracking numbers (XP, Infamy, and Reputation) that will go up slowly over time. Three of these are currencies (Downtime, Fame, and GP) that your character uses to acquire gear and other edges. And one is a currency for you as a player.</p> 
               <p>We imagine you have questions! Let's look at these more closely.</p> 
               <h3>Experience Points (XP)</h3> 
               <p>When working out the XP system for Second Edition, we looked at several different models, including both the model that Pathfinder Society currently uses (3 XP = 1 Level) and a true XP system (such as how the Core Rulebook requires 1,000 XP to gain a level). In the end, we chose a system where there are 12 XP within each level. A scenario grants 4 XP, while a quest gives 1 XP. The chapters of longer, sanctioned adventures grant the full 12 XP needed to gain a level. One way to think about it is that each XP represents roughly 1 hour of play.</p> 
               <p>You may have seen us talking about quests in previous blogs, but in case you haven't, we're going to be releasing more of them going forward. We're adding one quest to each month's releases starting with the launch of the Second Edition campaign, in addition to two Pathfinder Society scenarios. Having more quests allows us to explore more locations and stories, and it gives more content for times and places where people can't sit down to play for hours at a time.</p> 
               <p>However, quests in First Edition were a little challenging to handle because there were two forms those quests took: either a bundle of 4–6 quests that required players to play the whole series to earn the full rewards, or stand-alone quests that granted no XP, GP, or Fame. In Second Edition, we're building the campaign so that quests are a rewards-granting entity from the very beginning, even for stand-alone quests. With each being worth 1 XP, it should be easier to track their rewards—including no need for fractional XP.</p> 
               <p>There's one other matter to discuss about Fractional XP: the Slow Advancement Track. The slow track is an option where players can choose at the beginning of an adventure to earn fewer rewards to slow their character's advancement. We will be retaining slow track in Second Edition. A slow track scenario will grant 2 XP. The only players who will see fractional XP are those who choose to use slow advancement track while playing a quest, earning 1/2 XP per quest.</p> 
               <h3>Infamy</h3> 
               <p>Oh, but we love Infamy. In the First Edition campaign, performing evil deeds could lead to a warning or a PC's possible expulsion from the campaign (barring atonement), but it was difficult to track. Instituting a quantitative tracking system mid-campaign proved surprisingly tricky, so when we were creating Starfinder Society, we built in Infamy from the beginning.</p> 
               <p>The concept's reasonably straightforward. When your PC does something utterly notorious, uncaring, or outright evil, they can earn a point of Infamy (many scenarios also include special notes about a particular circumstance that might grant Infamy). Before you follow through, the GM's supposed to warn you about the likely consequences, and it's your call whether to do it anyway. Infamy gets tracked between adventures, and if you end an adventure with 3 or more Infamy, the Society determines your PC is too significant a threat to the Society's reputation and interests to keep around; that PC's removed from play. You can spend a notable amount of Fame to remove Infamy, and each point of Infamy you have makes it a little harder to purchase gear. From what we've seen and heard in Starfinder Society is that Infamy gain is relatively rare, and it's pretty easy to predict and avoid.</p> 
               <p>Expect to see Infamy largely unchanged in the upcoming Pathfinder Society campaign.</p> 
               <h3>Reputation and Fame</h3> 
               <p>We're also pretty happy with how factions operate in Starfinder Society, and this model is strongly inspiring the Second Edition campaign. To catch you up to speed, Starfinder Society allows each PC to represent numerous factions, and each faction represents less an outside interest and more of a subculture within the Society with unique goals. As you adventure, you can choose to focus on one faction or more evenly spread out your influence in each one (i.e., Reputation). The higher your Reputation with a faction, the more faction-oriented goodies you can access. So in practice, Reputation is like XP for a faction. You earn it slowly, and it only goes up over time.</p> 
               <p>Essentially, fame is what we know as Prestige Points in Pathfinder Society's first edition. You can spend Fame to purchase various services, such as securing spellcasting and paying off any Infamy. It's also used to buy many of those faction-oriented benefits mentioned above.</p> 
               <h3>Downtime</h3> 
               <p>Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society both have a basic Downtime mechanic already, for which the default benefit is the Day Job check—roll a skill check and earn some extract gold or credits. However, Downtime's also very direct, with each PC earning a unit of Downtime with no fractions or the like. There's some room for improvement.</p> 
               <p>Second Edition's core rules have Downtime mechanics built into the game, which makes it pretty darn easy for the Pathfinder Society experience to match how everyone else is playing the game. Downtime's used for a variety of tasks, from Earn Income to make some money, to Crafting to make your own gear (at a nicely balanced discount), to retraining class features, to any number of special outlets for Downtime that adventures might open up.</p> 
               <p>In the Second Edition campaign, expect to see Downtime and earn it after each adventure. The number of days of Downtime earned depend on the XP you earned, so barring any custom “gain bonus Downtime” rewards we might include in adventures, you can predict about how much you'll make at each level. Unlike other resources, you can't stockpile Downtime; you'll get some Downtime at the end of the adventure, and it's up to you to use it before the next adventure.</p> 
               <h3>Gold Pieces (GP)</h3> 
               <p>At face value, there might not seem to be anything to say here. Gold—and silver at earlier levels—lets you buy gear. You might have heard about Pathfinder Section Edition using a rarity system, though, so there's a little more involved when it comes to acquiring Uncommon or Rare equipment than throwing a bag of coins at the problem. For now, know that we're addressing rarities in a future blog, and every week we explore additional possibilities for opening up a portion of the Uncommon options in fun and accessible ways.</p> 
               <h3>Achievement Points (AcP)</h3> 
               <p>Okay, so gold, Downtime, Fame. These are things our organized play community has handled in some form or another before. Achievement Points may be more familiar than you think, but it's easy to overlook because their predecessor (Playtest Points) hasn't entirely wrapped up yet.</p> 
               <p>At their core, Achievement Points are about equality. As best I recall, Paizo introduced convention boons at Gen Con 2011, giving attendees a chance to win the first of many much-desired race boons. It took a little while, but slowly race boons became fairly common convention rewards beyond Gen Con, and they've been a staple of incentivizing convention play and celebrating attendees at Paizo-sponsored events since. Ah, but for as long as there have been convention boons, there have been concerns about those who can't make it to conventions (or in the case of some rarer rewards, those who can't make it to the “right” conventions). For every valid concern about missing content by not reaching conventions, there's an equally valid concern as to how the program can help keep the convention scene vibrant without great GM rewards (i.e., “If not race boons, then what?”).</p> 
               <p>Our answer is Achievement Points. Whenever you participate in—and report—a Pathfinder Society adventure, you earn Achievement Points. You'll receive a base amount for playing, earn more for GMing, and even more for GMing at Paizo-sponsored conventions like PaizoCon and Gen Con. No matter where you are or how you play, you'll be earning Achievement Points. We haven't finalized the exact numbers, as we are looking at how the Regional Support Program and Event Support for conventions interact and how we can incorporate both into the Achievement Point system. The chart of what activity earns what is one of those announcements for future blogs.</p> 
               <p>What does one <em><strong>do</strong></em> with these AcP (we're using that abbreviation to not confuse everyone about Adventure Paths)? You can redeem them on the Paizo website for different rewards that you might typically associate with convention boons or GM boons. No doubt that will include access to uncommon ancestries from upcoming products, but it could also include somewhat “meta” benefits like opening up replay options, providing a more comprehensive character rebuild, or starting a new PC at a higher level. Purchase the boon, print off a copy, and keep it with that PC. Or go digital and keep track of your AcP purchases on your My Organized Play page at Paizo.com The system we've requested and are testing auto-fills your organized play number and other key fields, limiting the potential to print off a hundred copies for all of your friends.</p> 
               <p>All told, it means that someone who plays a lot but never GMs could still save up to grab the reward of their choice, and someone who passionately GMs at numerous shows each year can accumulate and spend AcP more quickly. But everyone has access to the same rewards, with a few exceptions. We expect that there will be occasional limited-access options (like the charity boons Paizo's created for the past several years) but anticipate there to be far less Gen Con-exclusives. We also expect we'll shake up some of the options that AcP can access, but there will be an announcement period so participants can make the most informed decisions for their characters.</p> 
               <p>At this time, we are only planning AcP for Pathfinder Society and will provide physical boons for Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. If the AcP system works well, we will look at how we could incorporate it into the other Paizo organized play programs.</p> 
               <h2>In Review</h2> 
               <p>For someone familiar with our other organized play programs, there are some changes to the process. For someone new to Paizo organized play programs, it can be a lot to digest. We revisited what many of these scores to explain them more simply. Here's the TL,DR:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li><strong>Experience Points (XP)</strong>: This tells me my character level.</li> 
                <li><strong>Infamy</strong>: This is rare and tracks how much of a jerk my PC has been.</li> 
                <li><strong>Reputation</strong>: This is how much a faction likes me.</li> 
                <li><strong>Achievement Points (AcP)</strong>: I spend these on any of my PCs to access unusual character options and opportunities.</li> 
                <li><strong>Downtime</strong>: This is my character's free time for training, earning money, or making things.</li> 
                <li><strong>Fame</strong>: I spend this on buying boons and favors.</li> 
                <li><strong>Gold Pieces(GP)</strong>: I spend this on gear and services.</li>

The heroes are whisked away in an unprecedented disaster and must discover what happened to them, how they can recover, and who is responsible.

My name is Chad Brown, and I'm here to talk with you all about the hows, whats, and whys of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, starting with the new <a href="/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set"><em>Core Set</em></a>, and continuing forward to the <a href="/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em></a> and beyond.

Mike's talked about many changes for <em>Core</em>, including broad concepts of what we were (and were not) trying to accomplish. I'm going to dive in one level deeper and provide some more specifics about a couple of those things.</p> 
               <p>There are two major pillars of the revision, which I'll call "Story" and "Challenge." This probably isn't a surprise; the two main areas of feedback we've received since launching <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> are various forms of "we'd like more story" and "sometimes, the challenge level is off."</p> 
               <p>From the story side, we've adjusted the game to enhance and encourage teamwork, bringing it to a level you might see in an RPG session, adventure novel, comic, or movie. In particular, prior Adventure Paths gave groups a lot of freedom over when to split the party and when to group up. As a game mechanic, we built a balance around the advantages and disadvantages of each, and changed that balance over time, from scenario to scenario. As people played more and developed greater mastery over the game system, they came to realize that the advantages usually leaned more towards having the group spread out over multiple locations. This led to fine gameplay but didn't always match the story as much as we might have liked.</p> 
               <p>On a smaller scale, we'd frequently see new people learning the game ask how they could help each other, especially when their fellows tried something and failed. The answer (some form of "check your character and boon cards") generally created good gameplay, but often felt like a poor match for a heroic adventure story. Simply put, people felt like they were playing cool, fun characters, but they didn't always feel like they were playing those characters in an adventuring party.</p> 
               <p>To address this, we've made some adjustments to how we design cards and scenarios in Core. More character powers apply to local characters, and typical boons—including starting boons—provide more options for helping characters, especially local characters. A few examples:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-EzrenFront.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-EzrenFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Deflect.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Deflect_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-BlastStone.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-BlastStone_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Ezren shows off his knowledge of spellcasting whenever anyone finds a scroll or recharges a spell.</p>
               </div> 
               <p>Further, we've adjusted how we make allies and weapons, increasing their teamwork aspects. Allies now usually offer some form of help to local characters, giving you more options for helping your party. Similarly, more weapons have options to help others in combat, both nearby and far away.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Sage.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Sage_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-LightCrossbow.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-LightCrossbow_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-ThrowingAxe.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-ThrowingAxe_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>The sage believes the pen is mightier than the sword, but is silent on throwing axes.</p>
               </div> 
               <p>Those of you who've played PACG with groups of differing size know that the challenges the game offers to solo and two-player groups are often different from those encountered by five- and six-player groups. In particular, very small groups tend to feel very little time pressure, but individual challenges can be very tough. On the other hand, large groups usually have at least one character that is well suited to any particular challenge, so the group can bring a lot of help to bear at important moments... but they need to accomplish a lot in few turns, especially if they get unlucky at the wrong moment. In practice, this could feel almost like two different games: one for very small groups and another for very large. Up to a point, this is what we expected and wanted; after all, a giant Pathfinder RPG party does and should feel different than a solo adventure. As we (including you!) have gained more experience with the game, we've come to the conclusion that this split is often larger than we (and you) wanted.</p> 
               <p>This gave rise to the biggest rules change since <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> first premiered. Because PACG is a cooperative game, people naturally want to work together. The rules have previously allowed each character to play up to one boon of each type on a given check or step—that is, when someone's doing a thing, each player is limited to playing at most one card of each type. (For example, to help Lini's combat check, Lem can play either his Force Missile spell or his Viper Strike spell, but not both at the same time.) This ability to help other people was and is key to the cooperative aspects of PACG. Starting with the Core Set, though, we've adjusted that rule so that now the party as a whole can play up to one boon of each type:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>Each character may play any number of cards, but collectively, the party may play no more than one of each type of boon; powers that can be played freely do not count toward this limit.</i></p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>I'm going to be blunt: many of our playtesters were nervous about this change. When you read it in a PDF draft or a playtest forum, it feels like the sort of change that could totally change the game, and there were some people who enjoyed the "massive overkill" situations that the old rule would often create. What we found during testing, though, was that it doesn't change the game as often or as much as you might think. The major impact it has is to cut down on the situations where a group could unload nearly their entire hands at a key moment. What we were seeing is that large groups could, with a little planning and effort, reliably drop this sort of massive card play on key checks, so much so that they were frequently removing the tension from these dramatic points. With this small adjustment to the rule, plus the ability to sidestep it when we want to with the freely exception (it's used by a LOT of cards), we were able to leave in the option for overkill while restoring much of the tension to those key dramatic moments.</p> 
               <p>In practical terms, these changes mean that the group will have to coordinate a bit more to make optimal use of their resources, and they also bring the typical experience of a small group much closer to that of a large group. There are still differences, and your group can use some newly provided tools to adjust the effective challenge level to match your desires, but the starting points are much closer together. We've mentioned before that Core adds several new ways to adjust both the difficulty and length of the game, both up and down: wildcards, adjustable size locations, more frequent use of scaling effects, and options for adjusting the size of the hourglass. You'll find that, in addition to helping everyone have more fun playing the game that they want to play, they also help you ensure that your characters are adventuring together as a team.</p> 
               <p>The other big thing we added to enhance teamwork is a new mechanic: avenge. When introducing the game to people, we would sometimes see players go up against a nasty bane of some sort, and then stumble due to bad luck, a bad matchup, or simply not being ready to tackle the challenge. When this happened, the unfortunate character's friends would invariably ask, "Is there anything I can do?" Core offers a new answer to that question: "You can try to avenge them."</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-ArmorOfInsults.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-ArmorOfInsults_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Teamster.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Teamster_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-CalistriasString.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-CalistriasString_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Calistria, goddess of vengeance, approves of this new mechanic.</p>
               </div> 
               <p>When a character fails to defeat a bane, another local character may attempt to avenge that encounter. The original character finishes their encounter, suffering the normal consequences of failure (including damage), but just before the bane in question would go away, the avenging character may bury a card to encounter the bane themselves. Sometimes you'll want Merisiel to get rid of that trap that chomped on Valeros before it shuffles back in, just so it doesn't chomp Val or Kyra later on. When smashing a villain, sometimes Amiri will manage to roll a lot of 1s and 2s on her handful of d12s (and not on the same die face!), and Seelah will need to step up to try to avoid a painful villain escape.</p> 
               <p>Each bane can only be avenged once (no stacking; this isn't a video-game monster vending machine!), and only by a local character, and by default the avenging character must bury a card in order to avenge. So it's something that you'll want to work out with your team. But when it works, it can be a beautiful thing indeed.</p> 
               <p>This may help you understand why we removed closed locations from the game, as Mike mentioned in the previous Core Principles column. This helps tilt the game back toward a middle ground between splitting up and staying together. Instead of hiding at a closed location when you get in trouble, you can instead rely on your friends to help protect you at an active location, using tricks like avenge, the new ally and weapon powers, and other changes you'll see as you play the game.</p> 
               <p>Before you go, we've got more to share!</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <h2>Bonus Content: Making the Game</h2> 
                <p>As Chad was working on this blog, I received this photo from our printer, Cartamundi, showing their "storyboard" for assembling the finished game. I thought I'd share it with you, giving me the opportunity to guide you on a tour of the <em>Core Set</em>.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20190419-AssemblyStoryboard.jpg">
                </div> 
                <p>Clockwise from top left:</p> 
                <ul>
                 <li>The rulebook. Now expanded to 32 pages, and laid out vertically rather than horizontally.</li> 
                 <li>Token sheets. There are 3 different sheets (they're overlapping in the photo), giving you a total of 12 pawns and 63 markers (7 each of 9 different designs).</li> 
                 <li>The storybook. Its 24 pages present the <em>Dragon's Demand</em>: 9 scripted scenarios plus the tools you need to generate a huge variety of customized and/or randomized scenarios.</li> 
                 <li>The Quick-Start Guide. Much like the one in <em>Mummy's Mask</em>, it leads up to 4 characters through a shortened version of the first scenario.</li> 
                 <li>The box lid.</li> 
                 <li>4 packs of 110 cards, including the "Open Me First!" deck used for the Quick-Start scenario.</li> 
                 <li>Small components, clockwise from top right: foam blocks (4 per game), divider cards (24 per game), dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12; 1 each), and pawn stands (6 per game).</li> 
                 <li>The box bottom, packed with cards and small components.</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>You've probably noticed that there's no plastic tray. The tray was great for organizing a single Adventure Path that had a fixed number of each type of card, but it didn't work quite so well if you sleeved your cards, or if you wanted to add in a few class decks. And since the Core Set is intended to be the foundation for any number of Adventure Paths, there's going to be a lot less predictability in the card mix from here on out. So we've replaced the tray with a much more flexible solution, one capable of holding well over 2500 cards, and in a box about two-thirds the size of previous Adventure Path boxes. The 24 divider cards will keep your cards organized, and the foam blocks will keep them in place.</p>

               <p>Here at Paizo HQ, we couldn't be more excited. The <em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em> represents countless hours of passionate game design and development, layout and artwork, editing, playtesting, and much more. With the <em>Beginner Box</em>, we've put our hearts and souls into creating a great experience to introduce brand-new roleplayers into the hobby that we all love, and to create first impressions of the Starfinder RPG that players of all experience levels will never forget.</p> 
               <p>For certain, the project was a monumental undertaking. But knowing that our product might create deeply formative experiences for new players—in the same way that our early experiences with roleplaying changed our lives forever for the better—kept us all going the entire time. Now, we can't wait to share this game and this beginner's product with the world.</p> 
               <p>The <em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em> hits stores on April 24, and to help promote it, our partners at Two Kings Entertainment helped us put together the ad you see on this page.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, the Starfinder team members who helped bring this product to life have some thoughts to share about the process.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LX_4mmwb42s" style="margin:2rem auto; display: block;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>Creating the </i>Starfinder Beginner Box<i> was an extremely challenging and rewarding project that took dozens of people to execute. For my part as one of its designers, I did everything I could to pack as much of the Starfinder core experience into a package that's accessible to anyone with an itch to explore our weird and wild science-fantasy galaxy. I'm proud of the character sheet and especially happy about the player-aid cards. I hope they help give novice players a sense of agency and serve as a handy reminder for those with more experience.</i></p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>I'm really excited to share the world of Starfinder with so many more people—from those who want a handy way to check out what Starfinder has to offer, to those who have never tried a roleplaying game before. I look forward to hearing everyone's epic tales of galactic adventure!</i></p> 
                <p><i>Early on in my RPG-playing hobby, I often had no one to play with. I ended up spending a lot of time with solo adventures, which helped me learn the rules at my own pace and without the pressure of making mistakes in front of more experienced players. That kind of solo-introductory experience isn't a thing most tabletop RPGs do much anymore. So even though this game supports group play and learning how to GM, I was also super excited to see the solo portion of the game.</i></p> 
                <p><i>I hope it lets someone else who doesn't want to try to learn a game with a group, for whatever reason, figure out the basics at their own pace.</i></p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>A boxed set of basic rules was my first introduction to RPGs, so I've been looking forward to doing a </i>Starfinder Beginner Box<i> since we first started working on the Starfinder RPG. There is so much in that box that I'm excited about, but I'm particularly proud of the adventure I wrote for the </i>Starfinder Beginner Box<i>: “Steel Talon's Lair.” It was a fun challenge to write an introductory adventure for Starfinder that also would help GMs and players navigate through what could be their first roleplaying game experience ever! I don't want to spoil the adventure here for those who might play it, but one encounter features a strange effigy of an alien quadruped, and I wanted to share a little bit of flavor about the relationship between space goblins and horses that unfortunately had to be cut from the adventure for space: “Horses have long been an object of fear and hatred to goblins, and they hope that an image of such a fearsome creature will scare away intruders. Of course, these space goblins have never seen a real horse, so the effigy is more a representation of what they think a terrifying horse would look like.” Suffice to say, the sculpture looks nothing like a real horse—but it's still terrifying to space goblins!</i></p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>I had the privilege of designing most of the creatures for the </i>Starfinder Beginner Box<i>. (Rob McCreary created the adventure's villain.) The primary point was usability. It was fun to pare the monsters down to their essentials, and to rework the language and format with that goal in mind. The creature section also has plenty of evil NPCs, so GMs have scoundrels to use right out of the box. I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that other members of the team, especially Joe Pasini, made sure my work meshed with the overall system. The results take me back to when I started with RPGs nearly 25 years ago with another beginner's box. I hope the Starfinder Beginner Box does the same for a new generation of roleplayers!</i></p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>Merisiel had heard enough. The targets, the timetables, the names of the operatives—she had everything she could need to properly foil their plan.</p> 
                <p>Below, the vampires stood around their map table, arguing over details. Merisiel itched to put knives in all their backs, but even with the element of surprise, she knew the only person she was likely to kill with such an attack was herself. Besides, it wasn't in the plan.</p> 
                <p>Unfortunately, what came next <i>also</i> wasn't in the plan. She'd arrived well before the vampires, and chosen the perfect hiding place in the subterranean cathedral's upper balcony. It had been a beautiful piece of infiltration work, if she did say so herself. Yet how could she have known that the head vampire's first order of business would be making her pretty-boy underlings move the map table from its original position to a new spot directly blocking Merisiel's exit? Who orchestrated a coup and then wasted valuable conspiracy time rearranging furniture?</p> 
                <p>Regardless, Merisiel was going to have to get creative. Given the vampires' ability to see in the dark, the shadows wouldn't be much help. And from their new positions around the table, no matter which way she tried to sneak past them, at least one would inevitably spot her long before she made it to the door.</p> 
                <p>Her gaze rose, taking in the vaulted ceiling.</p> 
                <p><i>Maybe...</i></p> 
                <p>Without further deliberation, she crept to the wall and began to climb.</p> 
                <p>It was a big risk—but then, what part of this caper wasn't? And for all the vampires' supernatural senses, they'd still started out as humans, which meant they retained a human mindset. And humans rarely looked up without a reason. Silent as a ghost, Merisiel picked her way across the ceiling, spidering over ancient frescoes of rulers long since turned to dust in the crypts below.</p> 
                <p>She was almost to the door when the fop with the perfectly tousled hair made an impertinent comment, earning a backhand from the leader. The slap knocked the vampire's head backward, tilting it at just the wrong angle. His eyes met Merisiel's and widened.</p> 
                <p>She dropped the last ten feet to the floor, rolling to distribute the momentum as best she could, and darted for the door.</p> 
                <p>They were almost too fast for her. A brace of knives flung backward slowed them enough to give her a lead, but she knew that would only buy her so much time—once they realized she wasn't packing silver, they'd lose what little caution they had.</p> 
                <p>She sprinted through musty stone corridors, the pack baying like hounds at her heels. The squad of spawn who'd been keeping lookout at the main entrance appeared in the tunnel ahead, and Merisiel dodged left around a corner, barely touching the stairs beneath her as she raced downward, deeper into the crypts.</p> 
                <p>Behind her, someone shouted about the sewers, realizing how she must have gotten past them the first time. She banked around another corner—</p> 
                <p>—and into a dead end. Half a dozen sarcophagi lay in niches around the circular mausoleum, the windowless walls covered in ornate Pharasmin prayers.</p> 
                <p>She whirled just in time to see vampires fill the only doorway. Recognizing her predicament, they grinned and took the time to form up, stalking forward slowly to savor the drama. Predatory eyes glowed with reflected light from the solitary torch.</p> 
                <p>"So. A spy." The dandy with the stupid hat sneered, baring a single long fang. "Perhaps not everyone in the court is as clueless as we presumed. Too bad they'll never hear your report."</p> 
                <p>"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that," Merisiel replied. "They already know all your plans."</p> 
                <p>"What?" It wasn't really possible for someone that pale to blanch, but he made a valiant effort.</p> 
                <p>"Yeah, see, I snuck in yesterday while you were all taking your coffin naps and copied your documents." Merisiel made a face. "Honestly, I know you're a little behind the times, on account of being dead and all, but you really need to invest in some better locks. I mean, poison needle traps? What am I—twelve?"</p> 
                <p>"She's bluffing." The leader shoved her way to the front and grabbed Merisiel by her armor's leather collar. She hauled the elf close, perfect face twisting in a cruel smile. "If you had done what you say, why would you risk being here now?"</p> 
                <p>Merisiel made no move to resist, only matched that smile with one of her own.</p> 
                <p>"The thing is," she said, "it just seemed like a shame to waste the opportunity. What with all of you being together in one place."</p> 
                <p>The sound of grinding stone echoed from every direction as lids slid from sarcophagi. Kyra and the other priests stood up from their hiding places, holy symbols already extended.</p> 
                <p>Merisiel closed her eyes as the blaze of holy light washed over her.</p> 
               </blockquote>

               <p itemprop="description">With only two months left before we reach the upcoming conclusion for Starfinder Society's inaugural season, the team is excited to preview our upcoming scenarios. April brings us a new Tier 1-4 scenario following up on a past (repeatable) adventure and a Tier 5-8 scenario that brings a certain faction's ongoing effort to a conclusion.</p> 
               <p>First off, let's hear from Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton to talk about what's in store for our first scenario.</p> 
               <p>Starfinder Society's success stems in large part from the ease with which the setting folds in modern touchstones like reality TV, corporate mischief, rock bands, and nature conservancy. These themes, along with classic sci-fi tropes of exploring new worlds, meeting weird aliens, and making pew-pew sounds during starship combat, brought us a wealth of stories over these past two years. Yet there is at least one adventure concept that Pathfinder Society's mastered that is less represented in Starfinder: the dungeon. For the Tier 1-4 adventure <a href="/products/btq01x4w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-136-Enter-the-Ashen-Asteroid"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-36: Enter the Ashen Asteroid</em></a>, we wanted the opportunity to explore a small site with big implications, all the while providing a fun break from the ongoing Scoured Stars storyline to explore the Pact Worlds.</p> 
               <p>Fortunately, veteran author Larry Wilhelm was raring to go, creating an abandoned duergar complex hidden within the Diaspora. The dwarven mining consortium, Ulrikka Clanholdings, began excavating the asteroid AA-126D only to find the unholy iconography of Droskar, the exiled god of cheating, slavery, and toil. Although they'd normally obliterate the site, a longstanding contract with the Starfinder Society (facilitated by Venture-Captain Thromkendal) grants the Society a brief window to survey sites like these, identify any critical archaeological context, and make recommendations regarding further action. But there's far more than dusty halls and barren stone resting under this asteroid's surface, and it will take all the PCs' mettle to make it out!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Our second April scenario is one I'm particularly excited to highlight! <a href="/products/btq01x4x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-137-Siege-of-Civility"><em>Starfinder Society #1-37: Siege of Civility</em></a> is a partial sequel to another siege-related scenario. Written by Kalervo Oikarinen, this higher-level scenario introduces us to a new civilization within Near Space, one that the PCs may have tangled with in the past. A social scenario at its core, <em>Siege of Civility</em> offers PCs a chance to influence a swathe of new NPCs and at least one familiar (and not necessarily friendly) face! Finally, I think everyone should be happy to know that successfully completing this scenario is going to bring a certain Wayfinders project to the finish line, just in time for what's coming up.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>With that, we've got the Starfinder Society Season One's last month to look forward to. The culmination of over a year of effort comes to fruition as we enter the last two scenarios before a climactic interactive special. If you're interested in the evolving relationship between two popular faction leaders, or the first punch in the all-star bout that's going to take us back to the Scoured Stars for one last mission... well, be sure to stop by next month!</p>

               <p>Like the Shadow Plane.</p> 
               <p>Yes, that's right. After a long hiatus, we're diving back into the Shadow Plane and picking up loose threads tied to the Onyx Alliance, Blakros family, Blakros Museum, and more in the Tier 5-9 <a href="/products/btq01x4s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1018-The-Daughters-Due"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-18: The Daughters' Due</em></a>. When agents of the sinister Onyx Alliance begin appearing with equipment smuggled from the Blakros Museum, it's up to the Pathfinder Society to find out not only how the dastards did the deed but what villainy they intend to commit with these deadlier weapons. This adventure's the First Edition capstone of sorts to an ongoing Blakros tale that author (and Starfinder Society developer) Thurston Hillman's been spinning since 2012 at least, and you're sure to see some of your favorite NPCs feature in the story. And if you want more of the Shadow Plane in the meantime, you should pick up <a href="/products/btpya1b8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Realms"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Realms</em></a>, which features Shadow Absalom.</p>

               <p>In <a href="/products/btq01x4t?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1019-Corpses-in-Kalsgard"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-19: Corpses in Kalsgard</em></a>, a Tier 5-9 adventure written by Alex Riggs, the PCs are called to the icy Lands of the Linnorm Kings. The mighty Linnorm King Sveinn Blood-Eagle has declared that his long term as king of Kalsgard is over and that he plans to sail for legendary Vallenhall, but all is not right in his kingdom. With no clear heir to Sveinn's throne, his unworthy children and their followers' brawl in the streets, leaving the town guards with little time to spare.</p> 
               <p>These momentous events could not come at a worse time for some of Kalsgard's smallest residents. As the Ulfen clash, the gnomes of Kalsgard find that some of their neighbors are dying from a strange disease reminiscent of the Bleaching. A gnome Pathfinder and priestess of Nivi Rhombodazzle who calls Kalsgard home is positive that something less natural and much more sinister is afoot, but she needs the aid of her fellow Pathfinders to trace the true source of the deadly blight and put a stop to it. Perhaps Ellux Shost's interrogation of a likely suspect pictured here will reveal some clues!</p>

               </div>

Just be glad today's special sneak attack was just a new Iconic Evolution video! In this weekly video series, artist Wayne Reynolds takes Paizo's publisher and chief creative officer, Erik Mona, through his creative process in updating Pathfinder's iconic characters for the game's Second Edition, coming out this August. Check out this short video of their conversation for a glimpse into the mind of Pathfinder's most iconic visual artist and the first official look at the new version of Merisiel, the iconic elf rogue!</p> <iframe style="width: 560px; height: 315px; display: block; margin: 2rem auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSGZHiSi2XM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

               <p>I've seen that expression on the faces of mortals over the centuries. Most of them are satisfied dealing with what's set in front of their faces, but you—you're one of the ones that looked beyond. Beyond the material, beyond even good and evil, beyond the petty squabbling of angels and devils that amounts to nothing more than the shuffling of poker chips around a table for all eternity. You're looking for the monitors. You're looking for the ones that make it all work.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO92114-Opener.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO92114-Opener_500.jpeg"></a>

               <p>Who was it who drew you here? Did you feel the pull of Ceyannan the Shepard, like a call to a lost soul? Did you find salvation from danger in one of the graveyards and gargoyles of Vavaalrav, the Steeple's Skull? Did you, perhaps, discover a sentence or stray page of Tabris' <a href="/products/btq01x4d?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Concordance-of-Rivals"><em>Concordance of Rivals</em></a>? I, for one, think it's his best work.</p> 
               <p>It is, of course, natural that you would come to us above all others. The axiomites have no understanding of mortals, and their Primal Inevitables are slowly crumbling and coming to stand before our Lady of Graves. No matter how hard Jerishall strives to keep the planets turning in their perfect orbits, or how thorough Otolmens is in maintaining her laws of physics, in the end, they all must come to us. Please don't make me cry by expressing interest in those wretched protean lords. We're still cleaning the Jistkan graffiti off the walls from the last time the Mother of Tongues got in here.</p> 
               <p>As for the Monad… there aren't many who can catch that one's attention. Certainly, none have ever caught more than a scrap of its power.</p>

               <p>But enough about us. You're one of a very select few, as I'm sure you know. You even dug up some of the mantras that can call us forth in place of our true names. Such dedication requires acknowledgement—we're not ones to let our mortal agents go without tools to help them. You'll have divine protection and boons to benefit your station, of course. I might even talk that old miser Iliyai into showing you some of his ritual books.</p>

               <p>Now, if you're willing. We have a small issue with some pesky akizendri proteans scrambling up our records. Just last week alone we got a warlord's file mixed up with a milkmaid's, and let's not even get started on that disaster with that fighter and the evil wizard. And if you happen to spot the agnoia aeon that's helping them—they're about so tall, with three legs and three arms, hard to miss—please call one of the local yamarajes to deal with it. I think that one is a little beyond your just at the moment, and we don't want you meeting the Pale Lady too soon, after all...</p>

               <p>When creating the Starfinder Beginner Box, the team knew that some tough decisions needed to be made: What wouldn't make the cut from the Starfinder Core Rulebook? On this Starfinder Wednesday, we talked to Creative Director Robert G. McCreary and Developer Joe Pasini to get their thoughts on the Beginner Box and why they cut certain things before the finished product. </p> 
               <h3>Crystal Frasier, Author of Soldiers of Brass (Starfinder #32)</h3> <iframe style="width: 560px; height: 315px; display: block; margin: 2rem auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arrYQlYg4N8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
               <p>The one and only Crystal Frasier was in the studio to talk about writing the second volume of the Dawn of Flame Adventure Path! We also got into some hot tips to help with writing, ways to get into writing RPGs, and SO MUCH MORE! It's an awesome show full of super-fun!</p>

                <p>Illustration by Sam Yang</p> 
               </div> 
               <blockquote>
                Lini ducked just as the spider-lady flung a gob of green acid. It spattered across Droogami’s fur instead, sending up a waft of sickly acrid smoke. The leopard snarled, contorting in pain. 
                <p>“Droo! Don’t bite it!” Lini closed her eyes, stretching out her mind-hands to feel for the big cat’s wound. There—a twisted, blackened feeling, like the trail of a summer wildfire. She reached out to the life around her, begging and borrowing from the mushrooms and water bugs of the strange cave, redirecting their shared energy. In her mind’s eye, she pictured rain pattering down across that forest scar, feeding dormant seeds, calling forth the first green shoots of regrowth. </p>
                <p>She opened her eyes. Where the acid had burned, the leopard’s flesh had healed to gray-pink scar tissue, already beginning to sprout fur. </p>
                <p>Droogami yowled again. </p>
                <p>“Oh, hush! It’ll grow out!” Lini turned back just in time to dodge a swipe of the arachnid abomination’s claws. </p>
                <p>The fleshwarp shouted something in a language that sounded like snapping twigs, but that Lini was pretty sure <i>wasn’t</i> the language of twigs. If twigs could speak to anyone, Lini was fairly confident they’d talk to <i>her</i>, not this gross spider-lady. </p>
                <p>And she really was gross. Who’d ruin a perfectly good giant spider by fusing half an elf to it? Let alone a rude one like this. </p>
                <p>One of the spear-like spider legs shot out, catching Droogami in the chest and flinging the cat sideways against the wall. Droogami hissed and surged back to his feet. </p>
                <p><i>Definitely</i> rude. Lini fell back toward the mushroom patch and reached for the green essence that flowed through nature. </p>
                <p>Not, like, <i>literal</i> green—everything growing in these caves was purple or glow-pink or fishbelly white. But it was all still part of the green within Lini, Droogami, and even the fleshwarped dark elf: the endless cycles of the natural world that bound all things. The things that grew down here might not match the hills and forests she was used to, but that didn’t matter. Being a druid meant finding the natural in everything. You took your forest with you. She reached out to all the little lives—the skittish minds of the crawlers and burrowers, the sleeping spirits of the fungus, the unseen parasites in their water-drop empires—and asked for help. </p>
                <p>They answered in a rush, vines bursting forth from nowhere to tangle the dark elf aberration’s legs. She screeched and fell sideways, slashing with her claws, but for every vine she severed three more took hold. She turned toward Lini, one fist wreathed in black flame. </p>
                <p>Droogami pounced, landing on the angry arachnid from above and driving her down into the writhing mass. The vines immediately wrapped him up as well—there was only so much discretion you could ask from a plant, magical or otherwise—but unlike the spider-lady, he had no interest in breaking free. As the vines bound them closer together, he snarled and took the dark elf’s neck in his mouth, biting down just hard enough to draw blood. </p>
                <p>The fleshwarp went still, flame winking out as she took the hint. </p>
                <p>“Sorry about his breath,” Lini observed in the language of elves. She picked her way closer, hopping from mushroom to mushroom. “I’ve tried to show him how to scrape his teeth with twigs, but he’s too stubborn. And you wouldn’t <i>believe</i> some of the things he’s eaten down here.” She wrinkled her nose. “Or maybe you would. I don’t know what you believe. That’s your business.” She seated herself cross-legged at the edge of the vines. </p>
                <p>Through the waving tendrils, the spider-lady watched the gnome with angry, unblinking eyes. Lini drew her scythe, tapping it thoughtfully against her cheek. </p>
                <p>“<i>My</i> business, on the other hand, is finding where those slavers took our friends. And since Droogami here can smell them on you, we’d like to ask you a few questions...” </p>

               <p itemprop="description">For Pathfinder Society, we announce the yearly themes and logos at the PaizoCon preview banquet. This works well for Gen Con releases, but not so well for events in June and July. In deciding to launch new year storylines at Origins, we needed to move up our timeline for announcements. If you want to join me, lead developer John Compton, and developer Thurston Hillman at Origins for the premiere of Starfinder Season Year 2, you can find the Origins catalog of events on the <a href="http://originsgamefair.com/" target="_blank" name="Origins website">Origins website</a>.</p> 
               <p>The year numbering is a bit of a misnomer, as we’ve had the Starfinder Society for 20-ish months at this point, but this is the first major storyline pivot; hence, the Year 2 title. As the primary developer for Starfinder Society, Thurston Hillman is the best team member to provide a sneak peek into what’s coming. Without further ado, here is your glimpse into what the team has in store for you:</p> 
               <p><em>Today, the Organized Play team is proud to reveal the name and symbol for our upcoming season of Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild content. If you’ve been following Starfinder Society, you’ll know that we’re coming into the home stretch of our Year of Scoured Stars* and that there are only a few months of scenarios left before our Origins debut for Starfinder Society Year 2. With that in mind, it seemed like a good idea to provide some information on what Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild participants can look forward to starting in June of 2019.</em></p> 
               <p><em>Let me be the first to welcome all our players and GMs into the upcoming “Year of a Thousand Bites."</em></p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20190410-SFS-Yr2symbol.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20190410-SFS-Yr2symbol_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p><em>There’s a lot to parse and make guesses from in that name, but let me give you a bit of a preview of what this name and season represent. Taking a quick step back to the ongoing Year of Scoured Stars, the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild has focused a lot on a fairly sweeping “science fantasy space opera” storyline. Over the past two years of play, we’ve seen the Starfinder Society rebound from a nasty event in the Scoured Stars, come face to face with a new alien menace, and made inroads with new civilizations across the galaxy. This all culminates in our second interactive special, <strong>Starfinder Society #2–00: Fate of the Scoured God</strong>, a Tier 1–12 special debuting at Origins that bridges the gap (not that Gap) between Year 1 and Year 2. With all that in mind, our new season of play takes us back to somewhere we’ve been away from for too long: the Pact Worlds.</em></p> 
               <p><em>The Year of a Thousand Bites brings us back to the Pact Worlds and re-focuses the campaign on two major concepts: what it means to be a Starfinder and the living aspect of our campaign. Being a Starfinder can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and we’re going to get some insight into what people outside the Society think of Starfinders this season. We’re also going to get a chance to revisit some choices that players have made over the past twenty months of play and see how those choices have worked out.</em></p> 
               <p><em>Since taking on the role of Starfinder Society developer, I’ve pushed for a campaign that lets the players decide where our story goes. It’s taken some time for us to spin up this process, but I want to re-emphasize a promise that the Starfinder Society is a representative organization directly influenced by the player base. I suppose now would also be a good time to remind all our Second Seekers faction members out there to look at getting that Rising Star capstone boon and emailing us your character description—it’s going to be very important. In fact, for all you Second Seekers out there, you’ll probably want to look at getting that to us no later than 11:59 PST on April 30th**.</em></p> 
               <p><em>As for what else is in store for this year’s story… well, how about we take a brief look at our first Year of a Thousand Bites releases! (Expect product pages soon)</em></p> 
               <p><em><strong>Starfinder Society #2–01: Pact World Warriors</strong> brings back the ever-lovable undead media mogul, Zo!, who wants a group of skilled Starfinders to participate in a series of televised events. Since the Society needs to improve its reputation in the Pact Worlds (hmmmm… wonder why they need to do that?) it’s up to the PCs to step in and participate in these—absolutely not deadly and ridiculous—events.</em></p> 
               <p><em><strong>Starfinder Society #2–02: Waking the Past</strong> takes us out beyond the Pact Worlds to investigate a recently unearthed complex on an AbadarCorp-sponsored frontier colony world. I’m sure nothing could go wrong with Starfinders investigating an unearthed set of ruins.</em></p> 
               <p><em>We’ll have a lot more information on the Year of a Thousand Bites to reveal in the coming months, with a dedicated Q/A session at PaizoCon 2019 for all those of you in attendance. I’m really looking forward to showing some of the stories we have planned for this upcoming year of Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild play and am equally excited to hear from all the players who get a chance to participate in (and directly impact) where our shared campaign goes in the future!***</em></p>

               <blockquote> <em>*Ok, it's been a bit more than just a single year.<br> **Don't fret if you can't get us those capstone write-ups by this date. There will be more opportunities later on for those who complete this!<br> ***Bad sci-fi/futuristic pun. I apologize.</em>

               <p>We have Starfinder's first Creative Director, James L. Sutter on the show to take us back to the beginning. We initially set out to talk about the new Adventure Path, Dawn of Flame. We ended up talking about Starfinder elements that were created before it was a game! It's a stroll down memory lane with stories and anecdotes about a time when Starfinder was still Pathfinder. </p>

So we've got news about your PACG subscription!</p> 
               <p>Both of these sets are part of the main <a href="/products/btpy8x6n?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Subscription">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game subscription</a>. If you aren't already a subscriber, now's a great time to start. You currently have 3 choices for starting your subscription:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>If you choose to start your sub with the previous release—the <a href="/products/btpy9xdn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness-AddOn-Deck"><em>Ultimate Wilderness Add-On</em></a> Deck—you'll also score a free copy of last year's Free RPG Day promo character, Nok Nok.</li> 
                <li>If you choose to start with the <em>Core Set</em>, you'll get both the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse of Crimson Throne</em>.</li> 
                <li>If you choose to start with <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>, we won't send you the <em>Core Set</em>; this option is especially useful for non-US subscribers who want to get most of the subscription benefits without having to pay the unfortunately hefty international shipping fees for Core, which weighs in at a bit over 4 pounds.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>And what are the benefits? Subscribers get 20% off the MSRP of their subscription products, <em>plus</em> subscribers occasionally get free promo cards.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20190405-TheTallKnife.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20190405-TheTallKnife_180.jpeg" alt="The Tall Knife promo card, featuring a stylized guillotine weapon."></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20190405-Corpseplate.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20190405-Corpseplate_180.jpeg" alt="The Corpse Plate promo card, featuring a beaten set of heavy armor."></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20190405-Embiggen.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20190405-Embiggen_180.jpeg" alt="The Embiggen promo card, featuring an illustration of Seoni, the iconic sorcerer at double her height, to demonstrate the spell Embiggen."></a> 
                <p>What? "Embiggen" is totally in the OED. Look it up!</p> 
               </div> 
               <p>Yes, promo cards! There are six new promo cards for these products. Subscribers will get all six along with their subscription shipment of <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>. They will also be available in these ways:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>Four of the six—the blessing The Real Rabbit Prince, the weapon The Tall Knife, the item The Unveiling, and the ally Asyra—are in a special <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em> promo pack we're sending out to retailers as part of a special launch kit in May. (If you're hoping to procure these from your favorite retailer, make sure they're ordering the launch kit from their distributor!)</li> 
                <li>The armor Corpse Plate will be available at larger Pathfinder Society events in the next year, starting at <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> on May 24.</li> 
                <li>The spell Embiggen will appear in an upcoming issue of Game Trade magazine.</li>

               <p>Free RPG Day is June 15, less than a month after we release <em>Core</em> and <em>Curse</em>. So we've got a special treat: goblins! OK, sure, we've done a goblin character every Free RPG Day for years. So what makes this year different?</p> 
               <p>We're not just releasing a character—we're releasing a storybook. <a href="/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes"><em>We Be Heroes?</em></a> is an 8-page storybook for the new <em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Core Set</em>. It's a PACG adaptation of the Pathfinder Module of the same name being released at the same time for use with the Pathfinder RPG. It features four new heroic goblin characters from the Crookedtoes tribe: the barbarian Grenek, the ranger Crimsi, the druid Siathorn, and the bard Pizazz.</p>

               <p>They're not terribly good at being good, but they're working on it. Their opportunity comes when a group of paladins get in trouble, and our heroes need to get them out alive. Can they defeat the Blasted Chicken that squawks in their way? Only you can help them.</p>

               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20190404-Harpies.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20190404-Harpies_500.jpeg" alt=""></a> 
                <p>Illustration by Biagio d'Alessandro</p> 
               </div> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>The three harpies circled the ruins, raining threats, darts, and excrement in equal measure.</p> 
                <p>"Oh yeah?!" Lem dodged another grotesque barrage, releasing the knot of his whirling sling as he went. The bullet shot from the pouch, smashing into the leader's jaw and dropping her to the cobblestone plaza. "Bring it, birdbrains!"</p> 
                <p>The remaining harpies—a male and a female—screeched and retreated as far as the crumbling arcade, putting the ancient pillars between them and further slingstones. </p> 
                <p>Valeros cursed as one of his few remaining arrows shattered against the masonry. He nocked another. "At least we've got them on the run."</p> 
                <p>And then, like fetid angels, the harpies opened their mouths and began to sing. </p> 
                <p>The notes seemed too pure for the fanged maws that made them—high and clear, without any trace of the harpies' usual hunting shriek. Their haunting refrain echoed across the plaza.</p> 
                <p>Lem snorted. "Ah yes, natural minor—very spooky, very exotic. But you'll have to do better than that if—"</p> 
                <p>Next to him, Valeros took a staggering step forward, bow lowered and eyes rapturously blank.</p> 
                <p>"Oh come <em>on!</em>" Lem grabbed at the warrior's wrist, only to be shoved aside as Valeros broke into a stumbling run toward the grinning harpies. "<em>Seriously?!</em> They don't even have lyrics! What about rhyme and meter? Clever wordplay?"</p> 
                <p>Merisiel dodged in front of Valeros, barely managing to parry a club swing that would have taken his head off. "I don't think he's interested in an artistic education right now, Lem!"</p> 
                <p>"What else is new?" But Lem tucked his sling away. Drawing his flute, he clambered up the side of the temple entrance and perched atop its crumbled stones. Around him, the harpies' song filled the air, heavy with magic.</p> 
                <p>Lem pursed his lips. "Not a bad riff," he conceded. "A little simple, but you've got to start somewhere." He raised the flute. "Now let me try."</p> 
                <p>He played. At first, it was just notes—a quick trilling ascension to make sure he had the right key—yet it was enough to kindle his own magic. The spell swirled inside him as he found the groove, perfectly matching the harpies' melody. </p> 
                <p>For a moment, he almost didn't want to follow through. There was an infectious quality to the harpies' song—not the magical compulsion pulling Valeros to his doom, but the familiar pleasure or playing with other talented musicians. The harpies <em>were</em> talented, in their way. Under other circumstances, he would have loved to lose himself in the collaboration, feeling their tones resonating through his chest, their harmonies raising the hair on his arms and toes. Instead, he let that desire feed his magic, swelling toward a vast, impending crescendo. </p> 
                <p>Hearing their own song echoed back, the harpies looked over at him in surprise. </p> 
                <p>Lem waggled his eyebrows and triggered the spell.</p> 
                <p>Power flowed through him, surging into his lungs, coursing down into his fingers. It was still him playing, but now it was as if he'd played this particular piece a thousand times, his body moving through muscle memory, faster than conscious thought. His flute dove away from the melody line, threading through the piece like dolphins playing in the surf. And where he played, the harpies' song changed: his tones altering their chords, his notes filling their silences, each revision robbing their performance of its power. He blew harder, and the magic found their song's most crucial notes and inverted them, playing ghost notes that somehow crashed into the harpies' own and canceled them out, sucking both tones from the air.</p> 
                <p>The harpies broke off their faltering song. Screaming in outrage, they stooped and dove toward the bard, claws and clubs extended.</p> 
                <p>Valeros's arrow caught the female in the shoulder, sending her tumbling from the sky. Merisiel's dagger was a second slower but twice as sure, lancing through the male's throat and killing him before he even had a chance to fall.</p> 
                <p>Lem let the magic fade. Pulling the flute from his lips, he stared down at the fallen harpies with genuine sadness.</p> 
                <p>"Sorry," he said. "You were good, but my friends are kind of a tough crowd..."</p> 
               </blockquote>

               <p>I'm currently on a road trip through Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, getting a bit of personal time before delving back into convention season. John Compton and Jason Bulmahn just returned from GameStorm in Portland and from brief conversations the convention seemed to go well (maybe we can get a few more details in a future blog!). When I get back on Monday, I've got a few more weeks in the office packed with blog writing, con planning, meetings, finalizing details Pathfinder Society for Second Edition, and working on items for the current programs, before I head out to KoboldCon in Colorado Springs.</p>

               <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
               <p>We distributed no campaign coins in March due to our lessened travel schedule. Huge thank yous to all that sent in recommendations over the past month. We would love to have more suggestions for deserving members of our community. Anyone can make a recommendation, not just the Venture-Officer or GM teams. Please take a moment and email me at¬†organizedplay@paizo.com¬†with their name, location, and the reasons you feel they deserve recognition for their service. This message should be a synopsis of what the volunteer does that benefits your community, and does not need to be overly detailed or involved. If you are able, please include what events they may attend in 2019 so that we can either make awards in person (preferred) or make arrangements for remote presentation.</p> 
               <h2>Stars</h2> 
               <p>We are now into the second quarter of 2019 and convention season started in earnest. Our GMs this month took advantage of all the opportunities to run games and earned their 5th star. To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 Special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Huge congratulations on your achievement!</p>

               <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> 
               <p>After soliciting opinions from a variety of sources and then lots of brainstorming and discussion, we formulated a plan for Novas which also will apply to Pathfinder Society Glyphs later this year.</p> 
               <p>Requirements will remain similar to the existing Pathfinder Society Stars. A GM will need to run 150 games, of which ten must be special events, and the total must include 50 unique scenarios. Venture-Captain recommendation and processing are where the change comes in. After listening to quite a bit of feedback about what being a 5-star GM means, we've decided to add a qualitative element to the requirements. Our tech department is assisting us in making the process automated, so GMs qualifying for their 5th star won't have to wait for the monthly processing.</p> 
               <p>To add the qualitative element, we increased the number of adjudicated games 1 to 3. To help schedule the additional games, GMs can request Venture-Captain observation any time after their 100th game. Observations may be held in person, via web games, on VTTs, via PbP, or any other medium that is currently being used by the community. Venture-Captains will evaluate GMs on 5-6 criteria based on a published rubric. There will not be numerical scoring, but a system of does not meet/meets/exceeds expectations. GMs will need to accumulate a better than average score on each evaluation, which means they can have all meets and 1 exceeds expectations and qualify. They could also have a does not meet, 2-3 meets, and 2 exceeds expectations and qualify. A GM cannot complete more than three evaluations in a weekend. Any GM that fails to meet the criteria may wait three months and try again.</p> 
               <p>At this point, we have a rubric that we are soliciting feedback on and working on the last bits of tech. I hope to have the final bits hammered out in the next few weeks, so we can publish the rubric and get our 4-novas GMs started on their path.</p>

               <h2>Organized Play Staff Travel</h2> 
               <p>Want to hang out with Paizo staff? Play in a game which they are GM? Check out the list below and see us at a convention near you. I've been asked several times what it takes for a staffer to attend. At a minimum, the event should supply room(s) and badges, and the more costs covered, the easier it is to put on our schedule. Note: staff cannot attend conventions the last weekend in May or the weekend of Gen Con. We've moved our budgeting process up a bit, so if you are an event organizer and want to invite us out at your event in 2020, drop an email to¬†<a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>¬†before June 1, as we must submit the convention plan by July.</p>
