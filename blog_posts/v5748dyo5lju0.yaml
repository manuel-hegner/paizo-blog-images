  \ <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>In the madness\
  \ of the <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a> launch, I wasn't able to do my usual\
  \ blog about the new <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\">Pathfinder Tales novel</a>, which\
  \ was a real shame, given that Gabrielle Harbowy's <a href=\"/products/btpy9n4o?Pathfinder-Tales-Gears-of-Faith\"\
  ></a></i><a href=\"/products/btpy9n4o?Pathfinder-Tales-Gears-of-Faith\">Gears of\
  \ Faith<i></i></a><i> is a novel that's been so eagerly awaited by fans here on\
  \ the Paizo boards! Fortunately, Pathfinder Tales author Liane Merciel (of Nightglass,\
  \ Nightblade, and Hellknight fame) swooped in to save the day, interviewing Gabrielle\
  \ on what it was like to write the novel. For my part, I'll just say that I knew\
  \ since the very first installment of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfe6?Inheritance\"\
  >\"Inheritance,\"</a> Gabrielle's web fiction story that introduced the main characters\
  \ of Gears of Faith, that Keren, Zae, and the bold riding dog Appleslayer, were\
  \ going to star in a novel someday—there was something so deep and genuine about\
  \ all three of them, and their relationships with each other. So it was gratifying\
  \ but not surprising that the fans felt it, too! And now, 3.5 years and a new publishing\
  \ partner later, the book's finally hitting shelves, and I couldn't be happier about\
  \ it. But enough from me—let's hear from Liane and Gabrielle!</i></p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Liane Merciel: What inspired the two main characters in this piece?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Gabrielle Harbowy</b>: I love Pathfinder's take on gnomes, which\
  \ was why I wanted to feature one in the first place. In Pathfinder, gnomes crave\
  \ novelty and don't have many hang-ups about how they get it. They're long-lived,\
  \ fey-tied creatures, so they have an outsider perspective on humanity. I had a\
  \ great time diving into the gnome mindset. I've come to love Zae's skewed perspective\
  \ on the mostly human world around her. She gives me an opportunity to take things\
  \ to their literal extreme, to question things people don't question, to think about\
  \ the names of things, and to approach a fascinating world with the kind of wide-eyed\
  \ wonder that we all eventually lose when we live in a place and see it every day.</p>\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8538-Keren_360.jpeg\"></a> \n    \
  \  <p><i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Keren came\
  \ into being because a character like Zae has to have a contrast to work off of.\
  \ Keren gave me an opportunity to explore and chip away at the stereotype in our\
  \ culture of holy knights as emotionless, unquestioning valor-machines.</p> \n \
  \    <p>When I write Zae, I bring out that playful, questioning side of myself,\
  \ and I often channel Dr. Walter Bishop from <i>Fringe</i> as my guide. When I write\
  \ Keren, I bring out that using-cynicism-as-a-shield side of myself. My hope is\
  \ that both characters ring authentic because both of them are driven by sides of\
  \ me. There isn't a me-analogue and then \"the other main character.\" This is especially\
  \ important because the novel is the first time we get to see Keren's point of view.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I originally envisioned Keren as spending more time on horseback, so\
  \ Zae also needed a mount to ride if they were going to adventure together. I decided\
  \ early on that I wanted her to ride a dog, but it was a generic dog at first. It\
  \ wasn't until I met Rufus, a friend's Samoyed puppy, that Appleslayer got a personality\
  \ and a name. At eight months, Rufus was big enough for a 3'6\" child—already taller\
  \ than a gnome—to ride. He was a goofball, and he wasn't finished growing. (As of\
  \ now, full-grown, his paws are bigger than my hands.) I knew this was the dog for\
  \ Zae.</p> \n     <p><b>LM: What inspired the story itself? What part of it came\
  \ first—plot, characters, setting, or something else? And how did you build the\
  \ rest from there?</b></p> \n     <p><b>GH</b>: The characters got their start in\
  \ the short story \"Inheritance,\" to really great reader response. When it came\
  \ time to build a novel I knew I wanted to tailor it around them. I'd only written\
  \ short stories, though, and I had trouble coming up with a book-sized plot—especially\
  \ if Keren was tied to Lastwall and her vigilance against the Whispering Tyrant.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>James Sutter and I brainstormed quite a bit on where else a Knight of\
  \ Ozem could go without feeling like she was neglecting her calling, and James suggested\
  \ Absalom. As a bonus, even though it's the biggest city in the world, it hadn't\
  \ been featured in a novel yet. I was very excited to have the chance to bring it\
  \ to life. Especially fun was the Clockwork Cathedral, and the structure of its\
  \ cognates. Very little is written about it, so I got to think about what it would\
  \ be like to work there, to flesh it out and make it feel real... all without revealing\
  \ any of its secrets.</p> \n     <p>The plot was harder. I'd never written anything\
  \ as complex as a novel has to be. Just by virtue of having to take up so many words,\
  \ a novel has to have a lot more going on than a short story does. And I didn't\
  \ want them to be super powerful, so the threat had to be something they could face,\
  \ but that still had some far-reaching consequences to make it important. As it\
  \ stands, the conflict in the story provides a physical, intellectual, and emotional\
  \ challenge to Keren and Zae, and they have to fight their way into the team that\
  \ confronts it.</p> \n     <p>A random aside: the villain got his name from a kid\
  \ my niece hated at school that year. (I got serious aunt-points.)</p> \n     <p><b>LM:\
  \ What made you decide to pair up Zae and Keren?</b></p> \n     <p><b>GH</b>: What\
  \ I really wanted most was to normalize their diversity. Here's a couple who've\
  \ been together a while and aren't in the new romance phase of a relationship, and\
  \ they've obviously made it work. It's not a coming out story, because coming out\
  \ isn't the only story. And there's no way to dismiss it with \"well, it won't last.\"\
  \ It's lasted. It doesn't matter to the story that they're both female, or that\
  \ they're not both human, or whatever. They're people having genuine emotions and\
  \ genuine quirks and flaws. It's not the big reveal or the punch line or the plot\
  \ twist. It's just people being honest with themselves about who they are and/or\
  \ who they love.</p> \n     <p>In our world, people are still marginalized for these\
  \ things. And because they're not who our society sees as its default, it's rare\
  \ for people who identify in diverse ways to be able to find themselves depicted\
  \ in fiction. My intent was for diverse readers to find the perspective refreshing,\
  \ and for readers who hadn't come across much of that sort of thing to maybe find\
  \ their horizons widened and assumptions challenged.</p> \n     <p><b>LM: How exactly\
  \ did they meet? I've always wondered that.</b></p> \n     <p><b>GH</b>: I think\
  \ they met in Vigil, while shopping. There's a line about Keren helping Zae by reaching\
  \ something on a high shelf for her. :)</p> \n     <p><b>LM: There was a long gap\
  \ between the release of the short story and the release of the novel. What kept\
  \ you enthusiastic through that?</b></p> \n     <p><b>GH</b>: The Paizo forums helped\
  \ so much. The readers loved Zae and Keren and Appleslayer—Apple in particular has\
  \ some devoted fans!—and the clamoring for a novel never really stopped. Not to\
  \ mention the requests for miniature figures, cards, and other accessories. (And\
  \ yes, I would <i>love</i> to see Appleslayer as a mini.)</p> \n     <p>Publishing\
  \ is a strange beast. Between turning in the manuscript for <em>Gears of Faith</em>\
  \ and seeing it come out in print, I wrote, sold, and published another whole novel\
  \ (<em>Hellmaw: Of the Essence</em>). And that's honestly pretty normal. Working\
  \ for publishers, I saw delays happen all the time, and that helped me keep from\
  \ taking it too personally. They can only put out so many books in a year, and they've\
  \ got to balance the list, is what it comes down to.</p> \n     <p>In the end, I\
  \ think that the experience was good for Zae and Keren. I learned a lot from writing\
  \ my second first novel, after I had the confidence from having already finished\
  \ one, and that ultimately helped me come back and strengthen this book.</p> \n\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Remko Troost</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p><b>LM:\
  \ Where did the title of the novel come from?</b></p> \n     <p><b>GH</b>: From\
  \ [Pathfinder Tales author] Chris A. Jackson, actually. I'm great at coming up with\
  \ titles for other people, but awful at coming up with titles for myself. There\
  \ were words and phrases I had to avoid, because they were either too similar to\
  \ other titles or because they gave too much away, so of course the moment someone\
  \ says, for instance, \"Don't use the word <i>blood</i>,\" all your ideas include\
  \ the word <i>blood</i>. I had a two-column list of Pathfinder-title-sounding words\
  \ to mix and match, I was so desperate, and I sent it to Chris with a short synopsis\
  \ of the book. That was the one he came up with, along with a prediction that James\
  \ Sutter would like it. I sent it along to James with a list of five or ten others,\
  \ and sure enough, Chris's title was the one.</p> \n     <p><b>LM: Do you think\
  \ there's a central theme to <em>Gears of Faith</em>? If so, what is it, and how\
  \ do you see it reflected in the story and its characters?</b></p> \n     <p><b>GH</b>:\
  \ I think at its core, the book is about overcoming fear of failure.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Keren is afraid of failing—failing Zae, failing her father by learning magic,\
  \ failing her deity by not believing well or strongly enough. The villain is not\
  \ afraid enough of failing. He's convinced himself that he can become a god. Between\
  \ the two extremes is Zae. She's never really cared about failing before, but through\
  \ her relationship with Keren (and the events in \"Inheritance\") she's learned\
  \ that failure can impact others and have an emotional cost.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
