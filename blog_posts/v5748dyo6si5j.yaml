  \ a Nuyorican, my relationship to Puerto Rico was challenging at first. Whenever\
  \ I went to PR, I was the only cousin that barely spoke any Spanish. A real connection\
  \ came with food—especially once my grandmother introduced me to a tiny local fruit,\
  \ the quenepa. Each island has a different name for quenepas, and it was extremely\
  \ difficult to get back home in NY. It was a great start to a lifelong love of Puerto\
  \ Rico and a reminder of an amazing woman that never knew how much her grandson\
  \ cherished every moment we shared.</p> \n      <p>Would you like to know more?\

  \ \n      <p><b>Magic Item</b><br> <b>Price</b> 5 per bunch<br> <b>Bulk</b> L per\
  \ bunch<br> <b>Capacity</b> 10; <b>Usage</b> 1/hour<br> A <em>glowberry</em> is\
  \ a bioluminescent fruit that grows in tropical regions throughout Castrovel. The\
  \ bright-orange fruit begins to glow immediately when the thin, green-brown peel\
  \ is broken and the fruit is exposed. The flesh continues to glow even if cut into\
  \ pieces or pulverized into a liquid. Glowberries grow in bunches on trees that\
  \ can grow as tall as 100 feet, often bearing thousands of bunches every season.\
  \ While the colloquial name <em>glowberry</em> is common for the popular fruit throughout\
  \ the Pact Worlds, each individual Castrovellian culture has a different name for\
  \ the fruit. When the fruit is exposed, a <em>glowberry</em> increases the light\
  \ level by one step in a 10-foot radius for 1 hour.</p> \n      <br> \n      <hr\
  \ width=\"50%\"> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Carlos Cabrera</h3> \n      <p>Art in\
  \ one form or another has always run in my father's side of the family. I have a\
  \ younger sister who paints, my late father and one of my older brothers draw (cartoon\
  \ art and comic book art, respectively), and I've been known to draw, write, and\
  \ design games. I also have an uncle who can play Santana by ear, the musician by\
  \ which I acquired my name. My father was a huge fan of Santana's music, and on\
  \ my mother's side my grandfather's name was Charles, so they agreed. Over the years\
  \ I've dabbled in music here and there, be it ukulele or electric bass, and most\
  \ recently classic guitar.</p> \n      <p>I thought it would be a special idea to\
  \ create a magical guitar: an instrument that not only played the piece of culture\
  \ being performed but also granted a memory. This instrument can most often be found\
  \ within the hands of a calaca, which I designed for the first edition of Pathfinder\
  \ and Luis Loza brought into second edition <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2019/11/monstrous-physique-calaca-and-catrina-psychopomps-2e/\"\
  >here</a>.</p> \n      <h4>Memory Guitar – Item 4</h4> \n      <p><b>Divination,\
  \ Mental, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b> 100 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> held in 2 hands;\
  \ Bulk L This simple guitar appears worn and battered from use, but upon close observation,\
  \ the damage seems to be intentional. From the correct angle, the guitar’s scratches\
  \ and marks seem to form a simple picture, such as an environmental scene or a crude\
  \ face.</p> \n      <p><b>Activate</b> [three-actions] Interact; <b>Effect</b> You\
  \ play music with the guitar and the instrument’s power shares a memory with your\
  \ audience. When sharing with an audience, you share a memory of yours with anyone\
  \ within 30 feet. This has the effects of <em>mindlink</em> for anyone that can\
  \ hear the music. </p> \n      <p><b>Activate</b> [three-actions] Interact; <b>Frequency</b>\
  \ once per month; <b>Effect</b> You play the guitar and the instrument attempts\
  \ to help you recover a lost memory. You can either have a specific memory in mind,\
  \ such as trying to remember a childhood event, or let the guitar find a memory\
  \ for you. You recall the moment with perfect clarity and reestablish it permanently\
  \ in your mind with the failure effects of <em>modify memory</em>. </p> \n     \

  \ \n      <p>When I was a kid, I joined my school's music club and discovered the\
  \ cajón drum: a wooden, box-shaped percussion instrument primarily used in Criolla\
  \ and Afro-Peruvian music. You play it by slapping the sides and corners to mark\
  \ the beat and guide the dancers. At first glance, it doesn't look like it could\
  \ generate a great variety of sounds, but you would be surprised. Also, that instrument\
  \ helped me realize how much I enjoy working in tandem with others to create something\
  \ beautiful (in this case, music).</p> \n      <p>As a person born and raised in\
  \ Perú, the dream of entering the gaming industry seemed so distant and unattainable\
  \ that, for a long time, I didn't even think of trying to accomplish it. However,\
  \ I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Pathfinder community is one of\
  \ the most welcoming spaces to be part of. So, now, as a published author and a\
  \ co-owner of Eldritch Osiris Games (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EldritchOsiris\"\
  >@EldritchOsiris</a> on Twitter), I can explore my most quirky sides and put my\
  \ love for arts, philosophy, and storytelling to good use. If you want to see my\
  \ silly face and know more about my work, you can find me on Twitter as <a href=\"\

  \ Drum — Item 5</h4> \n      <p><b>Enchantment, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b> 160\
  \ gp<br> <b>Usage</b> held in 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> 2<br> This wooden, box-shaped\
  \ percussion instrument resonates with great power when struck. The drum is large\
  \ enough that you can’t play it while holding it. Instead, you sit on the drum and\
  \ play it with both hands. Sitting on or standing up from the drum requires an action,\
  \ which has the move trait. You’re flat-footed while sitting on the drum, but you\
  \ gain a +1 item bonus to Performance checks to play the drum. The drum is loud\
  \ and creatures within 100 feet of the drum can hear its music, regardless of the\
  \ ambient noise, though it can’t penetrate silence and similar magical effects.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact (auditory, emotion, enchantment,\
  \ mental); <b>Frequency</b> once per round; <b>Effect</b> You play the drum, unleashing\
  \ a rhythm that gets other moving. Up to 2 allies that can hear the drum can use\
  \ a reaction to Stride 5 feet.</p> \n      <br> \n      <hr width=\"50%\"> \n  \
  \    <br> \n      <h3>Luis Loza</h3> \n      <p>When I was little, I would see people\
  \ playing with trompos—wooden tops that were spun by pulling on a string. People\
  \ could perform cool tricks with them including scooping them up into their hands\
  \ or guiding along the string in intricate manners. Trompo tricks are similar to\
  \ yoyo tricks in how much coordination they require and how impressive they can\
  \ be to watch. It was only much later in life that I learned that trompos weren’\
  t exclusively a Mexican toy and were actually common throughout Latin America and\
  \ even in other parts of the world. Even knowing that, trompos still feel like a\
  \ Mexican thing to me, so I wanted to make a cool item that made use of one!</p>\
  \ \n      <h4>Tornado Trompo — Item 18</h4> \n      <p><b>Air, Evocation, Magical</b><br>\
  \ <b>Price</b> 19,000 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L<br> Various\
  \ runes are carved along the entirety of this wooden top. Spinning the top requires\
  \ wrapping a thick string around its base and pulling the string in a vigorous motion.\
  \ Wrapping a string and pulling the string each require an Interact action. The\
  \ top’s magic is connected to the power of the wind, which becomes evident when\
  \ placed on a surface as it hovers in place.</p> \n      <p><b>Activate</b> [two-actions]\
  \ envision, Interact; <b>Requirements</b> A string is wrapped around the top and\
  \ you have a hand free; <b>Effect</b> You lightly pull on the string and catch the\
  \ top in your free hand. It spins in place, hovering over your open palm, sharing\
  \ its power over the winds with you. You gain the effects of <em>fly</em> as long\
  \ as you keep the top in your hand. You can Release the top at any time to end the\
  \ effect. </p> \n      <p><b>Activate</b> [two-actions] command, Interact; <b>Frequency</b>\
  \ once per day; <b>Requirements</b> A string is wrapped around the top; Effect You\
  \ call upon the top’s power and give the string a powerful pull. The top travels\
  \ across the ground in a 120-foot line. As it does, it unleashes a powerful vortex\
  \ of winds, becoming a tornado temporarily. This tornado has the effects of <em>whirlwind</em>\
  \ (<em>Secrets of Magic</em> 141) except that it’s not limited by being used outside\
  \ or in a cramped space and can’t be sustained. Creatures in the tornado’s path\
  \ must attempt a DC 38 Reflex save to determine the effects of the tornado. The\
  \ tornado ends after traveling its full distance, causing any creatures that rose\
  \ in the air due to a failed save to begin falling immediately.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
