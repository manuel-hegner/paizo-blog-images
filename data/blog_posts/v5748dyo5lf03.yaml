  \ Preview: Ladies, Ladies, Ladies</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 19,\
  \ 2013</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"><p>We're\
  \ only a few weeks away from the August release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures, and we've saved some of the\
  \ coolest figures for the last few previews!</p></span> \n     <p>We're going to\
  \ cover five miniature reveals this week, as we have to get cracking to preview\
  \ the whole set before its release. I've got piles and piles of figures and images\
  \ from the next two sets I'm also dying to show you, but that will come after Gen\
  \ Con and the release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ set.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-LadyGhoul.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Up first this week is the Lady Ghoul, a common figure\
  \ you've already seen as an <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lewf\">Undead Horde Builder\
  \ Series</a> repaint. Here we have the original article in all her bloody glory.\
  \ Teamed up with the ghouls from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead Horde</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> sets and you've got\
  \ more than enough figures to make a really compelling series of ghoul encounters.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-SandaraQuinn.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-SandaraQuinn_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>A fellow crewmember shanghaied aboard a pirate ship\
  \ with the PCs in the very first <a href=\"/products/btpy8rcc\">Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ adventure</a>, Sandara Quinn is one of the most important NPCs in the entire Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles Adventure Path. WizKids did a great job with the magical effect\
  \ on her hand, and I dare say this is the best pipe-smoking pirate yet produced\
  \ in prepainted plastic. Sandara Quinn is an uncommon figure, as she also works\
  \ to bulk up pirate crews and would make an interesting choice for a player character\
  \ figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Luccaria.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Luccaria_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This shadowy seductress is Luccaria, high priests\
  \ of the evil god Norgorber. This ally of the Cheliax faction has plenty of nasty\
  \ surprises for your player characters. While the campaign features only one Luccaria,\
  \ we put her at the uncommon rarity because we think she makes a cool-looking cultist\
  \ in general, and you can never have enough of those.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-DaughterOfImerta.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-DaughterOfImerta_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Some of the ladies in the Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles Adventure Path are not so alluring, at least visually speaking. Daughters\
  \ of Imerta are cyclopean fiendish harpies, and what they lack in looks they make\
  \ up for in captivating songs sure to drive your player characters to distraction.\
  \ The Daughter of Imerta is a Large rare figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-IsabellaLocke_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Last up this week is Isabella Locke, a foul pirate\
  \ captain who just happens to have a treasure map tattooed on her skin. I confess\
  \ that when I added her to the list of figures for this set, I had no idea how and\
  \ even if WizKids could pull off the map tattoo effect. It's not tremendously visible\
  \ from the photos, but they managed to absolutely nail the visual effect, and you\
  \ can actually see the point on her back where X marks the spot on a little island.\
  \ Oh, and the figure also has a super-cool clear plastic spell effect on one of\
  \ her hands. This is definitely one of those figures that gets cooler ever time\
  \ you look at it, and in terms of complexity of design, the tattoos make it one\
  \ of the highlights of the set. Isabella Locke is a rare figure. </p> \n     <p>That's\
  \ it for this week! Join us next week as we finish off reveals of all the standard\
  \ figures in the Skull &amp; Shackles set!</p> \n     <p>Until then,</p> \n    \
