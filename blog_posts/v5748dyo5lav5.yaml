  \ March 10, 2010</p> \n   <p>One of my favorite parts of being an editor at Paizo\
  \ is getting to read about the new monsters in each bestiary before they come out.\
  \ My favorites are the ones whose descriptions make me shiver with a delicious sense\
  \ of horror and disgust. If the players facing these foul beasts make the same expression\
  \ that I do reading about them, GMs will be richly rewarded for including them!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Last week, James Sutter was casually describing some of the nasties in\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b7q\"><i>Heart of the\
  \ Jungle</i></a> as he handed over a copy of one of the chapters: \"You know, giant\
  \ botflies, giant leeches, and [...]\" Oh sorry, could you repeat the rest of that\
  \ sentence? I couldn't hear you over the sound of my inner child screaming in fear.</p>\n\

  \  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>You see, when I was about 10, I was reading my\
  \ dad's <i>Dragon</i> magazine back issues while en route to a week of camping in\
  \ northern Minnesota, and I came across an article called \"Ecology of the Giant\
  \ Leech.\" The description of foot-long ribbons of muscle whose bite you can't even\
  \ feel slowly fattening as they fill with your blood horrified me—suddenly I was\
  \ terrified to be spending a week canoeing and swimming in leech-infested waters.\
  \ (\"Leech-infested\" is not an exaggeration; the water along the shore of every\
  \ beach and campsite was thick with six-inch-long leeches.)</p> \n   <p>I studied\
  \ over the article again and again, poring over the stats and descriptions of their\
  \ attacks and vulnerabilities, so I'd know how to defend myself when the time came.\
  \ (You can laugh, but clearly, it worked!)</p> \n   <p>Now giant leeches are back—\
  and I can't wait to read about them again! Partly because I love being creeped out\
  \ by things that go bump in the water, and okay, I confess, partly to learn whether\
  \ leech-fighting methods have evolved over the years.</p> \n   <p>GMs, you're going\
  \ to love these wriggly critters: monsters based on one of nature's actual horrors,\
  \ and whose attack is so insidious that victims may not even notice until it's almost\
  \ too late. The only thing more priceless than the expression on your players' faces\
  \ when they find a couple giant leeches draining one of their comrades—and wonder\
  \ about that crawling sensation on their own backs—will be the look on their faces\
  \ when they realize they have to cross that swamp again on the way back.</p> \n\
  \   <br clear=\"all\"> \n   <p>Yours shudderingly,</p> \n   <p>Judy Bauer <br>Editor</p>\
