  \ Creator Spotlight blog series! Nearly every Monday, we’ll present a question-and-answer\
  \ session that highlights a different creator in the tabletop roleplaying games\
  \ industry. We plan to focus on recognizing the efforts of Paizo staff members,\
  \ freelance contractors, podcast players, streamers, YouTubers, licensed partners,\
  \ and more. Each participant is provided a list of standardized questions from which\
  \ interviewees can choose. You can request the Creator Spotlight form to be featured\
  \ here by emailing marketing@paizo.com. This week we're shining a spotlight on community\
  \ creator John Vanegas!</p> \n      <br> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \      <br> \n      <p><b>Name: John Vanegas<br> Pronouns: he/him<br> Role (if not\
  \ staff): current player, occasional DM<br> Social Media Handles: @JohnaldV (Twitter/Instagram)\
  \ and @SciStarMedia (Infinite Adventures Podcast on Twitter/Instagram)</b></p> \n\
  \      <br> \n      <h3>Tell us about yourself. What is your bio? What's your story\
  \ behind the bio? Why do you do what you do? </h3> \n      <p>I grew up and have\
  \ lived in the DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth) area. I am a second-generation immigrant\
  \ who has some mixed feelings about his place in the world: but more positive ones\
  \ than negative. I was raised under the presumption that I was a gifted kid and\
  \ rode that in stride until I was knocked down a peg when I got to high school.\
  \ Consequently, I straddle the line between grandiosity and self-forced humility.\
  \ I love creating art because as cheesy as it is, it’s the easiest and most digestible\
  \ form of self-expression. If you just say what you feel, people either write you\
  \ off or call you pretentious. But if you present a fictional fantasy that conveys\
  \ something important, the message can be taken with a bit of sugar. I think that\
  \ art is a way of connecting and building bridges between other people. Everyone's\
  \ a stranger after all. Observing and taking in art is a way to connect with the\
  \ part of you that exists within other people.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Tell\
  \ us about a project you are particularly proud of? </h3> \n      <p>Of all the\
  \ projects I’ve been a part of, I can say with absolute certainty that I am most\
  \ proud of the Infinite Adventures Podcast! We have published almost 180 episodes,\
  \ and I can’t be prouder of how far we’ve come. It is single-handedly the largest/longest\
  \ project I have worked on, and I have enjoyed every minute of it (except when I\
  \ am required to edit but that’s neither here nor there). </p> \n      <br> \n \
  \     <h3>How have you seen immersive fantasy worlds and cooperative strategic play\
  \ bring people together and create lifelong friendships?</h3> \n      <p>One thing\
  \ I can say about the TTRPG experience that I absolutely love is that it’s like\
  \ a masquerade ball. You invite a bunch of your closest friends and hope that they\
  \ get along with each other. And it becomes an easier experience in my opinion (for\
  \ more socially anxious, nerdy types) when you allow them to interact with other\
  \ people through the lens of fantasy characters. Doing so allows them to embrace\
  \ self-confidence they otherwise might not have. After a while, most gaming sessions\
  \ transform from focusing on going straight into the action to giving everyone a\
  \ place to hang out in a safe space.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Please tell us\
  \ about your pet!</h3> \n      <p>Ok! I don’t live with them anymore—they live with\
  \ my folks—but I have two adorable dobies and they are just the sweetest noblest\
  \ boys in the entire world. Tyler is a black dobie with a passive curiosity about\
  \ everything. He’s always looking around and watching what everyone is doing, and\
  \ you can just see the spark of an intellectual buried in his canine soul. Austin\
  \ is a gray dobie. He is incredibly playful, often exhibiting bursts of energy out\
  \ of the blue. You absolutely do not need a mind reader for him; he telegraphs every\
  \ minute emotion and feeling he has. If he could speak, this boy’s stream of consciousness\
  \ could be heard out loud.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>What character would you\
  \ like to play next and why?</h3> \n      <p>I have not played a dromite before\
  \ and we need to fix that one day. I have always liked insectile species in fiction.\
  \ I think that they’re not as common because many people feel scared of bugs, but\
  \ there’s something fascinating about them to me. They’re like living machines,\
  \ one of the closest things to aliens we have on our planet. We know they have societies\
  \ and systems as complex as humans and yet they live alongside us doing their own\
  \ thing. But being able to pretend what it’s like to be a large sapient ant person\
  \ in a fantasy game sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
