  \   </div> \n   <p>A short and sweet preview blog this week, focusing on some of\
  \ the Large miniatures in the upcoming Rise of the Runelords set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic miniatures. We’re still sorting out the\
  \ fine details of product format and exact release date, so again, there’s no product\
  \ page for this set, although I have reason to believe that we’ll have good news\
  \ to report on that front shortly.</p> \n   <p>In the meantime, I have more images\
  \ of paint masters to show you! This time, I’m taking a tight focus on stone giants,\
  \ the major threat of the fourth chapter of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise\
  \ of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>, “Fortress of the Stone Giants,” by Wolfgang\
  \ Baur!</p> \n   <p>If you’ve got a copy of that adventure, take a look at <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy80hm\">the cover</a>. You’\
  re about to see a lot of it in glorious three dimensions. Starting here:</p> \n\
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120210-StoneGiantSpear_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120210-StoneGiantSpear_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>This Stone Giant is a spitting image of a creature from the Wayne\
  \ Reynolds cover of “Fortress of the Stone Giants,” and I think he may be one of\
  \ the best prepainted stone giants ever created in plastic. Because you will need\
  \ a lot of them, these guys are at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120210-StoneGiantBoulder_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/120210-StoneGiantBoulder_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>You fight a lot of stone giants in “Fortress of the Stone Giants,” and\
  \ some of them have different statistics. For that reason and to mix things up visually,\
  \ we’ve included the uncommon Stone Giant Champion, complete with a boulder raised\
  \ high to crush your player characters. </p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120210-DireBear_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120210-DireBear_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Also from the cover, the Dire Bear makes\
  \ a great companion to a band of stone giants, or as a “special friend” for your\
  \ druid character. He’s also a Large uncommon.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120210-Mokmurian_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120210-Mokmurian_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>The spellcasting stone giant Mokmurian is\
  \ one of the primary villains of “Fortress of the Stone Giants,” and WizKids did\
  \ an excellent job bringing him to life in three dimensions. Note the clear blue\
  \ magical energy flaming from Mokmurian’s right hand, as well as the complex gold\
  \ pectoral, belts, armbands, and skirt hem on this miniature. This rare miniature\
  \ makes a wonderful leader for your Pathfinder Battles stone giant warband, and\
  \ we’re thrilled to have him in the set.</p> \n   <p>There are, of course, more\
  \ giants in the Rise of the Runelords set, but those will have to wait for future\
  \ Fridays!</p> \n   <p>Until then,</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
