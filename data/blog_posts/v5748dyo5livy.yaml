  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 20, 2016</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In the northern hemisphere, the celebration\
  \ of the sun is upon us as we celebrate the longest day of the year. Our compatriots\
  \ in the southern hemisphere are neck-deep in winter and short nights. Lucky for\
  \ all of us, Pathfinder plays just as well no matter where you are, and so we may\
  \ enjoy joining a table with others, roleplaying an evening away.</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ as evidenced by my Facebook feeds today, many of us did just that! While I am\
  \ still in Columbus, wrapping up Origins Game Fest and waiting for my flight back\
  \ to Seattle, my newsfeed overflows with posts of \"arrived home\", \"home and unpacking\"\
  \ and similar updates. It pleases me immensely that everyone is posting about their\
  \ experiences, as I get the chance to participate in even more cons by reading the\
  \ posts.</p> \n     <h2>Origins Recap</h2> \n     <p>This year was my first time\
  \ attending Origins. It is a longer con, stretching from Wednesday at noon to Sunday\
  \ evening. While I spent most of my time at the Adventure Card Guild tables, I did\
  \ get into the Roleplaying Guild room and got to observe some tables. Highlights\
  \ include: Erik Mona playing his monk during <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu7\"><em>#7-00\
  \ The Sky Key Solution</em></a>, Friday night's run of <a href=\"/products/btpy9lzy\"\
  ><em>#7-98 Serpents' Ire</em></a> where players took on the role of Aspis Agents,\
  \ and Sunday's tables of players dancing, flying, and moving about as they enacted\
  \ scenes from <a href=\"/products/btpy9j4r\"><em>We B4 Goblins</em></a>.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Due to construction, our tables were set up in a different area than usual,\
  \ but that didn't stop the foot traffic all weekend (which meant I got to interact\
  \ with many attendees!). We had a great turnout for the Adventure Card Guild, with\
  \ full tables and lots of new players. The Mummy's Mask demos were a hit, and many\
  \ players expressed excitement for October's Base Set release. At one point, I ran\
  \ two demos simultaneously, one on each end of the table—that was a feat! Obsidian's\
  \ <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Adventures</a>\
  \ app has also created a lot of buzz and drew many people in.</p> \n     <p>Though\
  \ reporting for Sunday's events still needs to be entered into the system, our current\
  \ PFS session count for the show is 297! This includes both the Roleplaying and\
  \ Adventure Card Guild events, and cements Origins as the third biggest convention\
  \ in the PFS circuit. Though if you listen to Mike McNerney, Venture-Captain for\
  \ Southern Ohio and Origins lead coordinator, he has plans to move to the number\
  \ two spot over <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>. Do I sense a bit of friendly\
  \ rivalry here? Which con will you come out and support next year?</p> \n     <h2>Campaign\
  \ Coins</h2> \n     <p>While at Origins, the opportunity arose to present two more\
  \ Campaign Service Coins to volunteers. Both recipients spend time helping out their\
  \ local lodges, as well as take on tasks that assist the greater community. PFS\
  \ #759 now belongs to Luke Woods. While his title is VL—Columbus, he is the con\
  \ scheduler for Southern Ohio and does analytics on the post-con data. The bearer\
  \ of PFS #760, James McTeague, may be better known as an Online VL or the preparer\
  \ of high-level GM tools. Congratulations to both recipients' on their accomplishments!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Other Conventions</h2> \n     <p>Besides Origins, we had 3XP–Summer\
  \ Edition in the United Kingdom. From all reports they had a great deal of fun,\
  \ ran many games, and raised over 1200 GBP for charities. Congratulations to Carol\
  \ Tierney and Chris Brockley-Blatt, the co-coordinators of the show!</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Esteemed Developer Crystal Frasier returned from her adventures at Comicpalooza\
  \ in Texas. Word on the street is it was a great convention, with lots of games,\
  \ panels and other activities. I cannot wait to hear her stories from the convention.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To round out the weekend shows, we had Q-Con in Ireland, Polycon in\
  \ California, and VL Weekend in New Zealand. I've not received much news on them,\
  \ but trust the attendees had a great time and more Pathfinder goodness occurred.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Travel Schedule</h2> \n     <p>I am in the office for a few days this\
  \ week, then leave again to attend the American Libraries Association convention\
  \ in Orlando. There we will demo games to librarians and discuss how to best utilize\
  \ Pathfinder in their libraries. I cannot wait to talk to those on the ground about\
  \ what they need to help introduce new players to our hobby.</p> \n     <h2>Gen\
  \ Con</h2> \n     <p>Finally, Gen Con approaches quickly. John and Linda are busy\
  \ working on scenario development—this month's offerings which John will introduce\
  \ next week as well as the final parts of Season 7 and the openings of Season 8.\
  \ While pre-registration for Gen Con closed yesterday, you can still purchase badges\
  \ and tickets for pick-up at the convention.</p> \n     <p>There are still tickets\
  \ for Pathfinder Society events, including Thursday morning tables of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9k95\"><em>#7-22: Bid for Alabastrine</em></a> (an adventure for levels\
  \ 1-5), Sunday Morning tables of <a href=\"/products/btpy9mba\"><em>#8-01: Portent's\
  \ Peril</em></a> (an adventure for levels 1-5), and the Adventure Card Guild side\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbe\"><em>#8-00 The Cosmic Captive</em></a> (the Friday\
  \ Night interactive event). You can find the complete catalog on the <a href=\"\
  http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con website</a> and search for Paizo events.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We have not closed volunteer registration either. Due to unfortunate\
  \ events, we do have some volunteer cancellations up until to the week of the show.\
  \ If your schedule allows you a short notice assignment, please consider joining\
  \ us. <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie2\">Registration details are in this blog.</a></p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Character Sketch Competition</h2> \n     <p>Voting for our latest Pathfinder\
  \ Society contest has begun! Check out the entries for our Character Sketch Competition\
  \ and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5livv\">vote for your favorite</a>. Voting continues\
  \ until Friday, June 24 at 12:00 PM Pacific time, and we'll announce the winners\
