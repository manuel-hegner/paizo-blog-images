<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20180829-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20180829-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">I've been looking forward to working on the <a href="/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/returnOfTheRunelords">Return of the Runelords Adventure Path</a> since the very start. As development on <a href="/riseOfTheRunelords">Rise of the Runelords</a> wrapped up over ten years ago, we started a tradition that's lasted ever since&mdash;the inclusion of a tiny little message at the end of the sixth volume's legal text. In Rise of the Runelords, this message simply read, "The runelords will return." Likewise, in the sequel to Rise of the Runelords, the last volume of the Shattered Star Adventure Path teased, "Sorshen lives!"</p>

<p>Now, with Return of the Runelords, we finally get to see the payoff to these hidden messages, as well as wrap up the epic storyline that began with a now infamous goblin raid on the little town of Sandpoint. If you've played through either Rise of the Runelords or Shattered Star, you'll find a lot of callbacks in Return of the Runelords to events, characters, and treasures that first debuted in those earlier campaigns, and you'll even be able to see what became of prior PCs who played through those earlier games!</p>

<p><i>Illustrations by Ekaterina Burmak</i></p></div>

<p>But even if you haven't played these prior campaigns, there's plenty of reasons to play <a href="/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/returnOfTheRunelords">Return of the Runelords</a>. This Adventure Path features longer adventures than most volumes, with the final installment being the longest adventure we've ever run in an Adventure Path volume! This increased length allows us to cover every level from 1st to 20th, without using Mythic Adventures to speed level progression along (as was the case in Wrath of the Righteous, the only other Adventure Path we've published that reached 20th level), but also pits your PCs against some of the most infamous and dangerous villains of the Pathfinder Campaign Setting.</p>

<p>So... if you think you've got what it takes to stand against the runelords, now you'll have a chance to prove it!</p>

<p>Before we move on, I want to stress that while we're shifting focus to Part 2, it's still not too late for you to contribute to the surveys for Part 1 (which you can find links to at pathfinderplaytest.com). We'll be keeping those surveys open until the end of the year, and the results will be checked regularly as we continue to analyze the data.</p>

<h2>In Pale Mountain's Shadow</h2>
<p>Starting today, we want to encourage everyone to play Part 2 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>. Your GM will have all the details you need to create characters for this adventure. You heard me correctly&mdash;you'll need to make new characters for this part of the adventure. Don't throw away those sheets from Part 1 just yet, though; we might revisit characters throughout this process.</p>

<p>Once you've played through the adventure, we once again have surveys for you to fill out to give us a sense of what everyone is playing and how the game is performing in this new adventure. You can find the surveys at the links below:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP2PC">Player Survey</a><br />
<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP2GM">GM Survey</a><br />
<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP2Op">Open Response Survey</a></p>

<p>Please note that just like last time, these surveys are ONLY for participants who have completed Part 2 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>. Also, please ensure that you complete all four pages of the Player Survey or GM Survey, since if you don't complete the survey, it'll end up not being counted.</p>

<h2>Updates to Death and Dying</h2>
<p>Before you begin your playthrough, we highly encourage you to grab the newest version of the Pathfinder Playtest Update document. Inside you'll find a host of changes to the game, as well as a revision to the Death and Dying rules, which we made based on feedback from the first round of the playtest. Make sure to incorporate these changes before you play your next game so you're playtesting the latest version of the system.</p>

<h2>Results from The Lost Star</h2>
<p>In case you missed it, we ran a stream on the Paizo Twitch channel on Friday, called Doomsday Dawn Deconstructed, in which we explored some of the survey results from Part 1 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>. Here are just a few of the highlights from the surveys (mild spoilers ahead).</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Ancestry: </b>Of the characters made for Part 1, humans were the most common (around 25%), followed by elves and goblins (around 15%) and dwarves (around 12%). The other ancestries were around 6-8% each.</li>
<li><b>Class:</b> Cleric, fighter, and rogue were the most common choice for class (around 12% each). Most others fell between 6-9%.</li>
<li><b>Dying:</b> Around 6% of characters were killed in Part 1 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, with clerics dying the most often (probably due to no one being able to heal the group's only healer).</li>
<li><b>Trivia:</b> 3 characters elected to venerate Asmodeus. 34 decided to drink from the polluted fountain. Fewer than 1 in 8 alchemists completely expended their ability to use Resonance Points during the adventure. Monks had the most coin left over after creation, at 64 sp.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's so much more for us to learn from this playtest, and we're truly grateful to all of you that have taken the time to play our game and give us your feedback. We're looking forward to seeing more as we get underway with Part 2. Good luck at your next game!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Order of the Amber Die&mdash;Doomsday Dawn Playtest, Part 1</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday, July 25, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20180519-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20180519-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">You've heard their tales of marathon Adventure Path sessions, now the folks from the Order of the Amber Die are eagerly leaping into the Pathfinder Playtest. Below is the first report from their table as they play through the first portion of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>! Beware spoilers if you intend on playing through this adventure!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Order has a storied past with edition changes, as we began playing first edition AD&amp;D in our GM's basement in 1987. Over the years, we switched to 2.0, then 3.0, next to 3.5, skipped 4th and went to 3.75&mdash;and yet now we stare at another phase of the game's evolution. For eighteen years, we've essentially played some iteration of 3.0&mdash;our longest stint in any edition. After so many years, it is an honor to be able to present our data from the dawn of a new era!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180825-PlaytestOpener.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180825-PlaytestOpener_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180825-GroupShot.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180825-GroupShot_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>We've found that one of the best ways for a group to make the shift to a new edition is simply as a group. The players held several get-togethers and also used a live document to guide each other through some of this edition's most radical changes. To physically represent the new feature of Hero Points, one of our members cut tokens from aircraft aluminum in the likeness of the Amber Die. Another member created dozens of condition cards&mdash;a set for everyone. To celebrate the debut of Pathfinder's new goblin iconic, we reached out to <a href ="http://www.aradani.com">Aradani Studios</a> for the first set of goblin ears ever to appear at our table. Lastly, Fumbus had to have a miniature to match the rest of the iconics, and the artists at <a href="http://bluetablepainting.com/">Blue Table Painting</a> made sure that a goblin would show proudly among the veteran iconic miniatures around him!</p>

<h2>The Party</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>Our roster throughout the playtest will adjust slightly for each part, consisting of OAD veterans from previous Paizo blog projects such as <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhx3?Giantslayer-Marathon-Part-6"><i>The Giantslayer Endeavor</i></a>, <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk5x?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons#1"><i>The Strange Aeons Experiment</i></a>, and <a href="/search?what=all&amp;q=azlant+odyssey+part+4"><i>The Azlant Odyssey</i></a>. Also listed is the year they became a member of the Order (when a player has reached 100 hours at our table). While Resonance was tough on us without a cleric, this party set out to prove that even a non-traditional lineup without major access to healing could thrive in the new edition.</p>

<h2>Highlights From The Lost Star</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Not long after entering the Ashen Ossuary in search of a family heirloom, we got into a sprawling melee with goblins in the dark. What we used to call the tedious "five-foot shuffle," now became the highly mobile "goblin scuttle," and they ran circles around us. Our GM used the new third action to have goblins break away and run toward our back ranks, dog slicers in hand. Without attacks of opportunity, no one was entirely safe.</p>

<p>When it came to Hero Points, we saw plenty of them. In addition to the standard one point per session and one for contributing (OAD members are expected to carry plenty of out-of-game tasks), we threw ourselves at the adventure trying to do something daring or heroic enough to warrant an additional point. In the end, we were conservative with the points we earned&mdash;maybe too much&mdash;but their ability to save us from death was worth keeping around.</p>

<p>The final battle was nothing short of the action we've come to expect from Pathfinder. Sajan led the way into the chamber occupied by Drakus the Taker, a hobgoblin thought to be a vampire. The monk let off a shot with an expert crossbow he'd picked up, enhanced with magic weapon: natural 20. Fumbus followed in, urging the party on by throwing an alchemist's fire bomb: another natural 20. Drakus reverted to his true form, then lashed out with a natural 20 of his own, dropping the goblin renegade. A round later, the monk too lay at the feet of the ugothol. With just Seoni and Lem left, the sorcerer used three Hero Points to move into line of sight, followed by a full casting of <i>magic missile</i> for the win!</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Current Situation</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Near the end of our crawl through the ossuary, Lem suffered a critical hit from a poisoned lock that left the halfling struggling for life; before the poison could advance further, we hurried to the safety of Magnimar's streets. We also recovered the lost Star of Desna, and returned it to Keleri Deverin with plenty of time to reach the Swallowtail Festival&mdash;she couldn't be late for the launch of one of Paizo's most legendary Adventure Paths!</p>

<p class="date">Friday, August 24, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurb360" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/KingmakerPreview_360.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/KingmakerPreview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Among the first minis we previewed from the forthcoming <a href="/products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker">Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</a> set way back when we announced it in the spring was the werewolf, a staple of the fantasy and horror genres for ages. But that's not the only figure in the set with a tie to the moon.</p>

<p>I'm super stoked to show off not one, but two new lycanthrope sculpts in this set, both Medium uncommon figures: the wererat archer and the weretiger. Whether they represent enemies of cursed PCs when the full moon calls, these two are sure to be a hit whenever they show up at the table.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-Wererat.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-Wererat_500.jpeg"></a><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-Weretiger.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-Weretiger_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Since we have such a great weretiger in the set (and a tiger in the previous set, Jungle of Despair), it is only fitting to also include a Tiger Lord&mdash;a tribe of Kellid barbarians from neighboring Numeria who play a pivotal role in the Kingmaker Adventure Path. And who better to epitomize the Tiger Lords than their leader, Armag the Twice-Born (a Medium rare figure) with his magic sword <i>Ovinrbaane</i>? Armag also makes a great barbarian PC for anyone not playing Kingmaker.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-Barbarian.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-Barbarian_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>A far less brutish barbarian in this set is the divine guardian, also a Medium rare figure. Perfect for a ranger, druid, hunter, shaman, or shifter, this warrior can easily be used to represent a member of many of Golarion's peoples, from Kellid to Mwangi to Shoanti (including the Shoanti moon, axe, or hawk clans, which all hold birds of prey among their favored totems).</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-Divine.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-Divine_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Lastly, we have another companion from the Pathfinder: Kingmaker CRPG, with a different link to the moon&hellip;not the moon in the night sky, but rather the skeleton moon looking over the Boneyard&mdash;Groetus, god of the end times. Harrim, Dwarf Cleric (a Medium rare figure) even has the holy symbol of his apocalyptic god emblazoned on the head of his flail. What campaign is complete without a nihilistic dwarf along to sour any joyous occasion with reminders of the futility of existence?</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-DwarfCleric.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180820-DwarfCleric_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Things Aren’t Always What They Seem</h1>
<p class="date">Friday, August 17, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurb360" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/KingmakerPreview_360.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/KingmakerPreview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Now that Gen Con is behind us, it's time to once again resume our weekly look at the next wave of Pathfinder Battles pre-painted plastic miniatures from WizKids, October's <a href="/products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker">Kingmaker</a>!</p>

<p>This week we explore a few figures in the set that are more than their initial appearance might suggest, either due to the creatures' special abilities or hidden histories. First among these deceptive creatures is the wild spriggan, a common Small figure. While these goblin-like relatives of gnomes are only a few feet tall in their normal form, they can transform into hulking brutes in an instant. The large spriggan is a Large uncommon figure, meaning most GMs should get enough of spriggans across both sizes to build a sizable (pun fully intended) war band.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-Spriggan.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-Spriggan_500.jpeg"></a><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-LargeSpriggan.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-LargeSpriggan_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>While changing size is a pretty neat ability, it doesn't necessarily help spriggans hide from potential prey or lurking threats. For that ability, one need look no farther than the gargoyle, which appears in two different forms in Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker. The first, an uncommon Medium figure places the creature on a standard round base, and depicts it in an action-packed battle pose, while the second, a similarly sized, unbased piece of dungeon dressing, appears as an intricate but completely benign statue adorning a gothic rooftop. While the pictured images depict the figures painted different colors, we asked WizKids to standardize their coloration across the two figures so a GM could place the latter as "set dressing" and then swap it for the former when the creature reveals its true nature. When we get final production samples, we'll update the images from these digital renders to actual photographs.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-Gargoyle1.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-Gargoyle1_500.jpeg"></a><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-Gargoyle2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-Gargoyle2_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Finally, we have the first of our weekly previews of the set's many player character-appropriate miniatures, based off the companions from the forthcoming <a href="http://owlcatgames.com/">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a> computer RPG from Owlcat Games (launching worldwide on September 25)! While I won't reveal the exact nature of this figure's secret, I will say that Tristian, Human Cleric&mdash;a Medium uncommon figure&mdash;is perhaps the most enigmatic and inscrutable companion in the game, and his storyline is one I'm most excited to see the community uncover when the game comes out. Armed with a Sarenite holy symbol, Tristian makes a great stand-in for clerics of the Dawnflower in any Pathfinder campaign.</p>

<p>If you prefer your interactives traveling to distant star systems, I recommend <a href="/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</i></a>, by Mikko Kallio. Debuting at Origins and with repeat runs at PaizoCon UK and Gen Con, it mixes ship combat and tactical adventure in a must-play story that pivots the action from Season 1 and sets up the events of Season 1A.</p>

<p>John departs in a couple weeks for DragonCon in Atlanta, while I have a week longer at home base and then am off for SkalCon. We are currently looking at travel for 2019 and setting up the shows we will attend. If you are an organizer who wishes for an organized play staffer to attend your show, please send an email to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with the show particulars, including if you are able to assist with airfare/hotels/badges/meals. We are working on a short timeline and need requests by <b>1 September 2018</b>.</p>

<h2>Volunteers</h2>
<p>A huge thank you to all the GMs and HQ staffers who volunteered for our conventions this year, both for the large scale shows like PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con and the local events. Without you, there would be no Society, no game rooms, and possibly no conventions. We appreciate your continued support and offer up three cheers for your continued generosity of time and energy!</p>

<p>A few final details need working out before we put out a call for PAX Unplugged, but we will be looking for some assistance with that show.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Society GM Stars</h2>
<p>A cornerstone of the Pathfinder Society is the Game Masters who To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Snowy Brierley</li>
<li>Brent Gass</li>
<li>Kevin Baumann</li>
<li>Francis Webb</li>
<li>Stefan Rohde</li>
<li>Matt Proctor</li>
<li>Geoffrey Peart</li>
</ul>

<h2>Campaign Service Coins</h2>
<p>My travels over the past six weeks afforded me several opportunities to award members of our community for going above and beyond in their dedication and service to the Society. Each of these members has been part of the venture officer community at some point, in some cases multiple times. They founded areas, setting up games where there were none. Mentorship, convention volunteer, organizer...just a few titles they've worn over the years. A huge thank you to the following volunteers. We recognized their effort with a coin and a new Organized Play number. For their effort and service on behalf of their local communities and the Society at large, vivat!</p>

<h2>Order of the Wayfinder</h2>
<p>Two years ago, we founded a new award that recognized a top volunteer in the Organized Play community. Called the Order of the Wayfinder, it is handed out once each year in recognition of exceptional service to the Society as a whole. This year, we did not award a Paizo volunteer of the year, choosing instead to wrap that award into the Order of the Wayfinder, as many of the Volunteer of the Year recipients were also organized play volunteers. The first recipient was <i>Bob Jonquet</i> for being a long term Venture-Captain/Regional Venture-Coordinator and Gen Con lead. Last year, we recognized <i>Alistair Rigg</i> for being a long term Venture-Captain (on two continents) and maintaining the Warhorn catalog for both Pathfinder and Starfinder scenarios.</p>

<p>This year, during the Venture-Captain dinner at Gen Con, we announced the third winner. Unfortunately, the recipient wasn't able to join us, so I swore the room to secrecy until I could contact them. Several hours later, after a late night (for them) Messenger conversation, I could announce the newest inductee to the Order of the Wayfinder: <i>Auke Teeninga</i>!</p>

<p>Besides being a Regional Venture-Captain, having joined the ranks of VC as part of the original 13, Auke has spent hours behind the scenes streamlining event support, boon distribution, and scenario requisition. His work, while not as visible as some volunteers, enables thousands of events to receive their support in a timely manner. He watches over the requests and makes sure they do not fall through the cracks. In addition, he participates in a variety of Task Forces and liaisons with the other RVCs to deliver a quality program. Thank you Auke, for all your efforts on behalf of Organized Play!</p>

<h2>Starfinder Society Second Seekers</h2>
<p>Over the past few months we've received emails about several characters achieving fame with the Second Seekers [Luwasi Elsebo] faction. As Rising Stars in their faction, they hope to achieve some level of renown. If you have such a character and are interested in their continued ascension within the Starfinder Society, please send their name, class, and a brief write-up, along with your organized play number and their character number, to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Conventions</h2>
<p>The summer con rush is wrapping up, but the list below shows there are still plenty of opportunities to attend conventions and play Society games! All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information! If you know of a convention running Society games that is not on this list, encourage the organizer to contact me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event.</p>

<p>With the Pathfinder Playtest in full swing, we will soon revisit the Pathfinder Society 2 topic threads we introduced when we first announced a new edition of the Pathfinder Game. While we cannot give you a full view of what the new Society will look like, we hope to be able to narrow our discussions and hone in on a few topics.</p>

<p>Until next time&mdash;Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

<p itemprop="description">Last fall, we got experimental with a set of pawns and launched the <a href="/products/btpy9ujs?Pathfinder-Pawns-Traps-Treasures-Pawn-Collection"><i>Pathfinder Pawns: Traps &amp; Treasures Pawn Collection</i></a>. The experiment seemed to work, so when there was a spot on the schedule for another Pawn Collection, we decided to try another set of pawns that represented objects rather than creatures, and that set is here this month with the <a href="/products/btpya1as?Pathfinder-Pawns-Dungeon-Decor-Pawn-Collection"><i>Pathfinder Pawns: Dungeon Decor Pawn Collection</i></a>.</p>

<p>Putting together this set of pawns was fun. We had a brainstorm where the creative team filled up an entire whiteboard in short order. We had more ideas than I could fit into this set, and more ideas than just things found in a dungeon. In this pawn collection there's a good mix of dungeon dressing, furniture, doors and windows, spell effects and hazards, and things you might find outside rather than inside.</p>

<p>When we released the <i>Traps &amp; Treasures Pawn Collection</i>, I grabbed some Flip-Mats and minis and headed to a conference room to set up some scenes to show the set off, so I figured I do the same for this new release. Check out some of the things you'll find in <i>Pathfinder Pawns: Dungeon Decor Pawn Collection</i>!</p>

<br /><i>Where are the windows on the map? Oh, right there! The set includes broken windows, intact windows, and even a few stained glass windows.</i></div>

<br /><i>Graves, open graves, and headstones allow you to set up a handy undead encounter.</i></div>

<p class="date">Wednesday, July 18, 2018</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/StarfinderSociety/SFS-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/StarfinderSociety/SFS-Preview_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">The Scoured Stars incident shaped the narrative at the launch of the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. That momentous&mdash;some say would say, catastrophic&mdash;event set the stage for the campaign's first season and the ongoing mystery of the Scoured Stars. With the recent unveiling of <a href="/products/btpya08y/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion"><i>Starfinder Society #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</i></a>, we on the Organized Play team thought it was a great time to look back in history to before the campaign started. Specifically, let's learn of the First Seeker who first brought the Starfinder Society into the Scoured Stars: First Seeker Jadnura.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180815-Jadnura.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180815-Jadnura_360.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Graey Erb</i></p></div>

<p>Jadnura joined the Starfinder Society after spending years honing his talents as a solarian within the Pradulex Monastery onboard the kasatha colony ship, <i>Idari</i>. Looking for a proper way to utilize his considerable talents, Jadnura joined the Starfinder Society, training within the halls of the Lorespire Complex along many notable Starfinder agents, such as a young Fitch and Naiaj. Jadnura preferred missions that took him to the fringes of explored space, and he specialized in exploring seemingly hostile environments. It was during his time as a field agent that Jadnura came across a mystical relic known as the <i>Tear </i>(as in "to cry tears") on an otherwise dead volcanic world.</p>

<p>When agents of the Lorespire Complex examined the <i>Tear</i>, they learned the device seemed to have some connection with the distant realm of the Scoured Stars&mdash;a trinary star system known to host a plethora hostile lifeforms and an abundance of malign outsiders. Using the <i>Tear </i>as a physical means of pointing the Society's interest at the Scoured Stars, Jadnura used his considerable charm and personal drive to attain the mantle of First Seeker, with his ultimate goal being the full exploration of the Scoured Stars. The rest, they say, is history&hellip;</p>

<h2>Second Seekers (Jadnura)</h2>
<p>Like his successor, Luwazi Elsebo, there were (and still are) many Starfinders keen to support Jadnura in his role as First Seeker. These Starfinders united under the longstanding "Second Seekers" faction, with their aims directed at exploring the Scoured Stars and enacting Jadnura's trademark "lead from the front" philosophy of exploration. Some of these agents managed to avoid the Scoured Stars incident, whereas others more recently heard of Jadnura's many endearing qualities and have chosen to serve him above the current nominal First Seeker. Where Luwazi Elsebo dedicated her nominated First Seeker term to re-unifying and reconstructing the Society, those following Jadnura have remained focused on their First Seeker's specific goal: unraveling the mysteries of the Scoured Stars.</p>
<p>With a return to the Scoured Stars, it's inevitable that we'll learn a bit more about Jadnura, so for those spoiler-conscious folks out there, I'll keep some of the particulars hidden below:</p>

<blockquote>
<div style = "margin: 10px 0;"><b>Starfinder #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion Spoilers</b> <input type = "button" value = "Show" class = "spoilerButton" onclick = "toggleSpoiler(this)"><div class = "spoiler-text">
<p>Ok&hellip; so the big news from this year's interactive special is that JADNURA IS BACK! That's right, as part of the climactic unfolding of the interactive special, the Starfinder Society has recovered the missing First Seeker and extricated him (and other survivors back to the Pact Worlds)! Of course, this leads to some interesting questions about how leadership within the Starfinder Society is going to be working going forward.</p>
<p>Over the coming months, we'll be looking at introducing Jadnura to our players through upcoming scenarios. This includes several scenarios that include the Faction (Second Seekers [Jadnura]) tag. Jadnura is going to play a major role in our upcoming stories, not to mention defining his relationship with nominated First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo. We wanted to give the interactive some time to play across all our major events before we revealed this massive lore development in a public way, and now that the summer convention season is winding down, expect to see product pages and updates for these scenarios in the near future.</p>
<p>Finally, if you played the interactive special, then you know that there's the potential to earn your first Reputation with Second Seekers (Jadnura). This was just a light tease of what we've had planned. I humbly request that you don't spoil this in the comments below, as I try to be somewhat vague with our spoiler-free players about how this new faction is going to play into our campaign's future!</p>
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p>For those of you interested in joining the Second Seekers (Jadnura) faction to honor the lost First Seeker, I have some good news! With the upcoming release of the next update to the <a href="/products/btpy9vlp?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide"><i>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</i></a> (sometime around late October or early November) we'll be introducing a whole section on this faction. The plan is to include a variety of boons along the lines of what you've seen with other factions. If you've seen the release of our limited-release first minor faction, the Manifold Host, I assure you that this will include a lot more faction-facing content.</p>

<p>Ok, alright, fine, I may have one more spoiler&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<div style = "margin: 10px 0;"><b>Starfinder #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion Spoilers</b> <input type = "button" value = "Show" class = "spoilerButton" onclick = "toggleSpoiler(this)"><div class = "spoiler-text">
<p>With Jadnura's sudden return to the Starfinder Society, he's become quite interested in what's transpired in his absence. I know there's a lot of players out there who've been interested in replaying previously played content, and I'll give a strong hint that Jadnura has your back! (In boon form, if not with his ridiculous heavy weapon as well!)</p>
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that waiting several months is a bit of a tease. I also understand that it's even more of a tease to preview all this without a means of actually getting into the faction. So, let it be known that I'm a generous developer. <b>The following boon is available to all characters as of the posting of this blog and will be reprinted in the next update to the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide. New characters created following this blog post can choose this boon for their starting faction champion boon.</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Second Seekers: Jadnura Champion (Faction Boon)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You've declared your allegiance to the Second Seekers (Jadnura) and dedicate your missions to furthering the faction's goals.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Second Seekers (Jadnura) Tier 0</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Cost:</b> 2 Fame</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> This Faction boon allows the character to gain Reputation with the Second Seekers (Jadnura) faction. A character with this boon slotted at the end of a successfully completed scenario gains Reputation as detailed in the primary and secondary success conditions of that scenario.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Normal:</b> A character gains no Reputation unless she has a Faction boon slotted.</p>

  <p itemprop="description">The initial volume of the <a href="/store/starfinder/adventurePath/againstTheAeonThrone">Against the Aeon Throne</a> Adventure Path releases this month, marking several changes to the Starfinder Adventure Path format, some permanent, some more experimental.

<p><i>Illustration by David Melvin</i></p></div>

<p>Secondly is our exploration of a shorter campaign length. Both Against the Aeon Throne and the following Adventure Path, <a href="/store/starfinder/adventurePath/signalOfScreams">Signal of Screams</a>, are presented in just three volumes, giving groups a chance for a somewhat extended experience in the Starfinder universe without having to commit to a full six-volume campaign, which can usually take at least a year to play. When we decided to double our production of adventures, we also thought the change would be a good opportunity to experiment a bit with the format. And the plots and themes we wanted to work with at the time seemed to lend themselves to shorter arcs. Thus, the three-volume campaign was born!</p>

<p>These shorter campaigns let us explore a slightly more focused narrative, much in the same way a Pathfinder Module tells a complete, self-contained story. We can really hit the most important plot points with big, splashy encounters and not have to worry about sustaining that level of energy over six adventures. While the six-volume campaign is great for telling epic, sweeping tales, these shorter adventures allow us delve into moments that might affect the characters on a more personal level. However, that doesn't mean the fate of the galaxy won't be at stake!</p>

<p>That isn't all we're trying out over the next several months. While the beginning of Against the Aeon Throne is for new 1st-level characters, the first adventure of Signal of Screams is for 7th-level characters. This will mark the first time an Adventure Path won't begin at 1st level! That being said, if your group isn't comfortable with starting at 7th level, then we made sure that the two Adventure Paths dovetail nicely into one another. Once you've finished with Against the Aeon Throne, you can transition right into Signal of Screams. Sure, there will be a slight change of tone in the adventures, but if your group doesn't mind the shift, then you should go for it!</p>

<p>As these adventures get released, we are very interested in hearing your feedback about the changes. How do you like the three-volume format? Are six-volume Adventure Paths too long for your group? Would you like to see more content that starts at higher levels? Or do you prefer the dangerous thrill of those first few levels? Let us know!</p>

<p>And don't worry, the Starfinder Adventure Path line returns to the usual six-volume campaign in February of 2019 with Dawn of Flame!</p>

<p class="date">Monday, August 13, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><a href="/pathfinderplaytest">The Pathfinder Playtest is live!</a></p>

<p>I know that it's hard to believe, but the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> is less than 2 weeks old, and we've already learned so much about the game. Feedback for the first part of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> and the three Pathfinder Society adventures is pouring in through our surveys and <a href="/community/forums/pathfinder/playtest">the paizo.com forums</a>. While there are some interesting early trends in the data that point at a few things that are going to need some work, we want to avoid getting into any of the fine details until the first part of the playtest is over (in just about 2 weeks). Until then, we'd like to talk about a number of other things.</p>

<h2>Rules Updates</h2>
<p itemprop="description">Starting today, you're going to begin seeing some rules updates from the team to clarify or fix issues with the current draft of the playtest. Rather than focusing on typos or other small errors, we're going to try and keep the updates restricted to things that we think are problematic to the gameplay if left as-is. In the coming weeks, you might also see us replace entire subsystems of the game, if warranted by playtest feedback.</p>

<p>The updates themselves are broken into two categories. The first is critical updates. These are issues that distort the game heavily and should be fixed immediately. The second category, just called updates, refers to rules that are important enough to warrant a fix, but that have a relatively limited impact at the game table. There are plenty of other changes we're noting as well, but most of these will have little to no impact on the current state of the game.</p>

<p>You can find the current updates by going to the downloads section on <a href="/pathfinderplaytest#downloads">PathfinderPlaytest.com</a>. After you download the PDF, you'll get an email notifying you of additional changes whenever we post an update!</p>

<h2>Playtest Surveys</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, some of the playtest surveys are now live! If you have completed your playthrough of Part 1 of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> or of any of the three Pathfinder Society playtest scenarios, then we have some surveys for you! For those of you who have not, I have a couple of reminders.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are playing <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, make sure your group has the playtest tracking forms, which are located at <a href="/pathfinderplaytest">PathfinderPlaytest.com</a>. These will help GMs and players track a few vital statistics during play that you might otherwise forget when it comes time to take the surveys.</li>
<li>The surveys are only for people who have completed Part 1 of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> or one of the three available Pathfinder Society playtest scenarios. Each adventure has a survey for Game Masters and a survey for players. <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> also has an open response survey, allowing you to give more descriptive feedback of your experience.</li>
<li>General surveys asking about classes, ancestries, and other mechanics will come out next month (giving everyone a chance to get in some play time first).</li>
<li>The surveys are each a few pages long (usually 4 main sections) and most should take you no more than about 10-15 minutes to complete. Please make sure you go all the way to the end of the survey!</li>
<li>Here are the links for the surveys:</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<h2>What's Next</h2>
<p>For the remainder of the playtest, you can expect to see a blog from the design team once per week looking at the playtest, talking about where we're at, what we've learned, and where we're going. In addition, you can find us livestreaming <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> as we play through the adventure in the office with staff. Finally, after each part of the playtest is over, you will find us on the Twitch stream talking about what we've learned from the playtest and taking questions from the room and from the forums. It's sure to be a lot of fun, and you will be able to watch it all live over at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target = "_blank">twitch.tv/officialpaizo</a>.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep playing and sending us that feedback. We've only just begun on our journey to make a better Pathfinder, and we need your help to see it through! Will you join our noble quest?</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">With the Ultimate Wilderness Deck, Your Power Will Be Mushrooming</h1>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p class="date">Thursday, August 9, 2018</p>

<div class="blurb180" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180809-Preview2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180809-Preview2_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Hello! We just came back from a highly successful Gen Con, where we showed off the newest stuff for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, including the debut of the <a href = "/products/btpy9xdn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness-AddOn-Deck"><em>Ultimate Wilderness Add-On Deck</em></a>. It falls to me to guide you through the wonders therein, and I'm thrilled to do so, because it allows me to talk about mushrooms.</p>

<p itemprop = "description">Yes, <i>mushrooms</i>! The fleshiest, most spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus you'll find in the moistest, least welcoming shadows of the forest. I get to tell you all about them, because I'm a fun guy. (See, if anyone else on my team had volunteered to do this blog, they could have stopped me from making that joke.) [<b>Vic:</b> So very, very tempted to delete that, but Erik Mona says not to stand between a man and his puns... much.]</p>

<p>The reason the subject of mushrooms is so fond to me is that there is an epochal divide on the PACG design team. There is one group (headed by me, Liz, and Paul) that believes mushrooms are the best! And there is another (headed by Chad, Gaby, and Tanis) that believes mushrooms are the <i>actual devil</i>. (Keith pretends to split the difference, but we all know he's just placating us mushroom enthusiasts.) So those of us who love mushrooms relish any opportunity to wax poetical about squishy, fleshy mushrooms in front of the others.</p>

<p>So I shall! The <em>Ultimate Wilderness Deck</em> is filled with them. Here are three.</p>


<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-CloudPuff.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-CloudPuff_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Angelstep.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Angelstep_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-DraughtcapFungus.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-DraughtcapFungus_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>The delight of mycophagists everywhere.</p></div>

<p>Let's address the elephant ear mushroom in the room first: The trait PLANT is not <i>quite</i> accurate, since everyone knows mushrooms aren't plants. But we needed things that worked on Plants to affect these cards, so we ignored the biological distinction. I figure everyone in Golarion thinks mushrooms are plants, even the ones that shriek all the time.</p>

<p>Once you get past that, you'll love that the deck is filled with tons of Plants, all of which have that great kicker on the bottom of the card. Basically, these plants don't count as in your hand when you set your hand size. So you can have a whole lot of them. They <i>grow</i>, you see.</p>

<p>There are also some Plant allies as well.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Leshykineticist.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Leshykineticist_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-VerdantRager.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-VerdantRager_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-SnappingFlytrap.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-SnappingFlytrap_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>Feed me, Seymour!</p></div>

<p>Of course, we also loaded the deck up with Animal allies and things that affect them.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Koala.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Koala_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-VampireSquid.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-VampireSquid_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Shadowcat.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Shadowcat_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>You are not going to argue with a person who befriends Vampire Squids.</p></div>

<p>As well as all sorts of other cards that affect Animals.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-HuntsmansGreatsword2.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-HuntsmansGreatsword2_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-UrsineRageskin.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-UrsineRageskin_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-BlessingOfKetephys.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-BlessingOfKetephys_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>There are blessings for Halflings and Gnomes too.</p></div>

<p>And if you like having animals around, why not turn into them? We have <i>nine</i> new spells of the aspect type we introduced in the <em>Hunter Class Deck</em>. The aspects are the first spells to have the Animal trait. They're kinda creepy looking, but in a good way.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-AspectOfTheFrog.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-AspectOfTheFrog_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-AspectOfTheMonkey.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-AspectOfTheMonkey_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-AspectOfTheTiger.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-AspectOfTheTiger_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>Mostly in a good way.</p></div>

<p>You know who likes all this stuff? <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk87?Meet-the-Iconics-Zova">Zova</a>, the iconic shifter. The shifter is straight out of <a href="/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness"><em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Wilderness</em></a>, and Zova has been a favorite of ours since the R&D team started cooking her up. We started designing this deck before the RPG rules were finished, then reconciled things as the shifter... well, took shape, as it were.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-ZovaCharacterFront.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-ZovaCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-ZovaTokenFront.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-ZovaTokenFront_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-ZovaTokenBack.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-ZovaTokenBack_180.jpeg"></a>
<p>Nice claws.</p></div>

<p>I'd like to call your attention to Zova's hand size. It's the first hand size line with text in it, because Zova has the spell Shapechange hardwired into her character. Every turn, you can pick your hand size from three (or even five!) options. No more dying because you drew too many cards, maybe ever.</p>

<p>Then when you get good at playing with a variable hand size, you can either blow everything up with Fire and Acid, or just be a lycanthrope.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-ElementalShifter.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-ElementalShifter_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Weretouched.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-Weretouched_360.jpeg"></a>
<p>That flavor text for Elemental Shifter is how we talk about the weather in Seattle.</p></div>

<p>The <a href = "/products/btpy9xdn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness-AddOn-Deck"><em>Ultimate Wilderness Add-On Deck</em></a> is the shiftiest deck we've ever made, and we're thrilled to end the Ultimate series with it. Now we're taking a break from class decks to focus everything on the new Core Set and Curse of the Crimson Throne. Thanks for letting us put out 27 decks in the Class Deck and Add-On lines. We hope to make more someday! For now, enjoy <em>Ultimate Wilderness</em>!</p>

<p class="date">Friday, August 3, 2018</p>

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/Starfinder/20180803-Previewjpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/20180803-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">We have an important communications dispatch to issue here at Starfinder HQ: we're working on a <em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em>!</p>

<p>Come spring 2019, you'll be able to get your hands on a box with all of the components needed to quickly learn and play the popular Starfinder RPG. From dice, to maps, to pawns, to separate books for GMs and players, this box is meant to provide a self-contained gaming experience for those with little to no experience with Starfinder&mdash;or with tabletop RPGs at all.</p>

<p>Work on the <em>Beginner Box</em> is still churning apace back in our office in Redmond, even as the project's design team is bustling around Indianapolis at Gen Con. In addition to our team's game design work, at this very moment we have the best production crewmembers in the business dedicated to making this product as awesome as possible.</p>

<p>We just announced this project at our Starfinder 101 panel at the convention, but we realize that legions of interested parties are not in Indianapolis. For those who couldn't make it to the show, check out the <em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em> cover that we revealed below!</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7110.jpg"></div>

<p>If you'd like to see the seminar where we announced this project, go to the <a href = "https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target = "_blank">Paizo Twitch stream</a> and find the video for the Starfinder 101 panel.</p>

<p>In the meantime, stay tuned in the coming months for more information about the <em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em>!</p>

<p class="date">Wednesday, August 1, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/Blog/PaizoPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/PaizoPreview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><span itemprop="description">When Paizo was planning this year's <a href = "/pathfinderplaytest">Pathfinder Playtest</a>, we expected to exceed our own ability to fulfill orders on a timely basis, so we decided to use Fulfillment by Amazon. Unfortunately, Amazon's reports indicate that most customers will not be receiving their orders by tomorrow's release date.</span> They shipped 3 orders on July 28, 3 more on July 29, and no orders on July 30 or 31. Today, they have shipped almost 10% of the outstanding orders, and they are continuing to ship through the night and into tomorrow. They have so far been unable to tell us when they will complete shipping. We will be posting updates as we receive them <a href = "/threads/rzs2v9kj?Pathfinder-Playtest-Preorder-Updates">in this forum thread</a>.</p>

<p>This delay doesn't impact preorders placed with retailers; most of them should have already received their products for release tomorrow. Paizo.com preorders for pickup at Gen Con are also unaffected.</p>

<p>We sincerely apologize for this delay. If your paizo.com Pathfinder Playtest preorder is being fulfilled by Amazon, we will be giving you $15 in paizo.com store credit in the near future.</p>

<p>PDFs of all of the playtest products will be available for free shortly after 6:00 AM Pacific time at <a href = "/pathfinderplaytest">paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest</a>.</p>
