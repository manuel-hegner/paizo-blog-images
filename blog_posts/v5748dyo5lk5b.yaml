  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, September 13, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">One of my favorite things about\
  \ Pathfinder Society (and now Starfinder Society) derives from the portability of\
  \ the campaign. I started playing during Season 2 of Pathfinder Society. Since then,\
  \ I've lived in three different locations (four, if you count my home in Las Vegas.)\
  \ No matter where my family moved, we either found a Pathfinder Society community\
  \ or built one. Being able to game anywhere made it easier to pick up roots and\
  \ move again, knowing there would be a group of friends waiting at my destination.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But what happens when you don't have people nearby, or work a non-traditional\
  \ schedule, or family commitments get in the way of participating in local games.\
  \ Great news. Not only do we have thriving gaming communities centered on physical\
  \ locations, we have a robust online scene as well. The partnership of Paizo with\
  \ several Virtual Tabletops gives a variety of platforms for play. In addition,\
  \ the Play-by-Post (PbP) community hosts loads of games. And that is the focus of\
  \ our blog this week.</p> \n    <p>Instead of bringing my limited knowledge to the\
  \ table, I'm handing the keys of the keyboard to our esteemed PbP Venture-Lieutenant\
  \ Hilary Moon Murphy (HMM). She'll give you the ins and out of participating in\
  \ one of the most roleplay driven gaming styles.</p> \n    <p>Before I do that,\
  \ I want to call out two other organized play items. The first involves the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game. Due to a few crossed wires, <a href=\"/products/btpy9wen?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-41-Chasing-Yellow-Sails\"\
  >&lt;&lt;<em>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild #4-1—Chasing Yellow Sails</em></a>released\
  \ in its' entirety last week. Next up, a special promotional adventure <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9who?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-4P-Murder-in-the-Marketplace\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild #4-P1—Murder in the Marketplace</em></a>\
  \ that ties into the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-1\"\
  ><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck</em></a> releasing in October.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ also wanted to point everyone to the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg/additional\"\
  >Roleplaying Guild Additional Resources section of the website</a>. Thanks to John\
  \ &amp; Linda, the updates are ready for June, July, and August publications.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>The Play-by-Post Community</h2> \n     <p>In December\
  \ of 2014, I stumbled into my very first Play-by-Post game as a replacement player.\
  \ It was a bizarre We Be Goblins game that turned into a musical. Everyone was engaged,\
  \ the story was a delight, and I found myself refreshing constantly throughout the\
  \ day for updates of the wacky antics of my fellow players and this delightful story\
  \ that we created as a team.</p> \n     <p>It's also the moment that I fell in love\
  \ with Play-by-Post, realizing the myriad possibilities of gaming in this manner.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>An Assortment of Cool Things</h3> \n     <p><b>Story-Driven and Flavor-Filled</b>.\
  \ Play-by-Post is Immersive, and offers the opportunity for rich roleplay. You can\
  \ do things in Play-by-Post that may not be feasible at an in-person table. Characters\
  \ often reveal hidden thoughts and motivations, building out a character's rich\
  \ backstory. Snarky familiars can get their own avatars and become fully fledged\
  \ party members. You can split the party, offer side adventures, brooding interior\
  \ monologues... all without slowing down the game for others. As a GM, one of the\
  \ things that I love to do is bring out the quirky and varied settings of Golarian.\
  \ Play-by-Post gives more time for party exploration and discovery.</p> \n     <p><b>Inclusive\
  \ &amp; Easy to Schedule</b>. \"You don't have to actually leave your home or talk\
  \ to anyone to play\" wrote a PbPer named Lady Ladile: \"It's a fantastic medium\
  \ for the shy, the introverted, the home-bound, the anxious, the stay-at home parent,\
  \ the busy worker, etc. You don't have to leave your family, or try to wrangle several\
  \ people's schedules in order to play maybe once a month if you're lucky. You don't\
  \ have to speak if you're not comfortable with speaking or not good at speaking.\
  \ All you need is some sort of internet-capable device and a connection. As someone\
  \ who <i>is</i> shy, introverted, works an oddball schedule, and isn't a good speaker\
  \ or quick-thinker, this is a key reason that I love PbP as much as I do.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>A Warm &amp; International Community of Gamers</b>. In our most recent\
  \ special, I noticed GMs that hailed not only from North America, but also from\
  \ Indonesia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland. Most of the\
  \ tables I've played at have been international in some way. PBP allows you to make\
  \ friends with people from all over the world, and our lodges love welcoming new\
  \ players.</p> \n     <h3>Some Things to Consider</h3> \n     <p><b>Play-by-Post\
  \ can be Slow</b>. Games take weeks to complete, and your characters will be tied\
  \ up in that game for the full run. However, that slowness also gives you time to\
  \ think about your next move.</p> \n     <p><b>People can flake sometimes.</b> Just\
  \ like no-shows in real life games, sometimes people disappear. In all the PBP lodges\
  \ players and GMs look out after each other; we all know that actual life can sometimes\
  \ get in the way of the game. If a replacement is needed they are found quickly;\
  \ no game is orphaned long.</p> \n     <h3>Want to Try It Out?</h3> \n     <p><a\

  \ Gameday VI starts August 25th!</b></a> A few of our GMs have even <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/PbPGD6NPGF\"\
  >reserved seats specifically for players new to Play-by-Post!</a> This is our annual\
  \ Play-by-Post Convention, one that you can attend without leaving home. We'd love\
  \ to have you try out a game, and come be a part of our community too.</p> \n  \
