  \  </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello there! In this series of blogs,\
  \ we’ve been talking about the characters from the <a href=\"”https://store.paizo.com/pacg”\
  \">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Core Set</a>, including <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgw0?Core-Design-Sajan\"\

  >Amiri</a>. Today, I’m going to talk about our latest twist on a <a href=\"”https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lb7y?Meet-the-Iconics-Valeros”\
  \">familiar iconic fighter: Valeros</a>.</p> \n     <p>In <i>Rise of the Runelords</i>,\
  \ Valeros was frequently brash, crass, and surrounded by enemies, as in the cover\
  \ of the very first Adventure Card Game:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\
  \ <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6000.jpg\"><img src=\"\

  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Friends, Foes, and Fun!]</p>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Then as now, Valeros was a common pick for people jumping into the game\
  \ quickly: he had a clear role, could easily help others, and was tough enough that\
  \ you could survive a few bumps on the road to experience. He started with an even\
  \ mix of cards types alongside an extra helping of weapons, which naturally reinforced\
  \ what you already wanted to do.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_RotRValerosFront.jpg\"><img style=\"\

  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Weapon, armor, weapon, tankard, weapon,\
  \ weapon. Seems right!</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Once you had a few successful\
  \ sessions under your weapons belt, you could start to specialize in having more\
  \ choices (hand size) or getting more oomph out of your helping efforts. Eventually,\
  \ these matured into the Guardian and Weapon Master roles.</p> \n     <p>From there\
  \ we moved into the nautical realm of <i>Skull &amp; Shackles</i>. Valeros gained\
  \ Fortitude, helpful for swimming, diving, and other sailing-related activities\
  \ (that likely involve the tankard) alongside his ability to command a ship’s crew\
  \ if needed.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_SSValerosFront.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:50%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_SSValerosFront.jpg\"\
  ></a><a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_SSValerosBack.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:50%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_SSValerosBack.jpg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Still covered in weapons? Check. Still\
  \ using that tankard? Double check!</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>His card selection\
  \ shifted slightly away from armor and towards friends and comrades. As a Corsair,\
  \ he could dive into the world of ships and swashbuckling, while the Tactician Valeros\
  \ could be especially strong and/or helpful during critical battles.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Valeros was one of the early characters to get the Class Deck treatment, giving\
  \ us the third version of the character in relatively short order. Distinguishing\
  \ him from prior versions, <i>Class Deck: Fighter</i> Valeros was focused more on\
  \ the “friendly helper” aspects of the character.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CDValerosFront.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:50%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CDValerosFront.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Fiendly? Intimidating? Why not both?]</p>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p><i>Class Deck</i> Valeros is still tough and excellent with\
  \ melee weapons, in addition to his improved personal interaction skills. His second\
  \ power lets him frequently use the “big bonus” effects on weapons, which are generally\
  \ around a third or more of his deck. Taking the viewpoint that these two things\
  \ combine to make him “good enough” at his own combats, this Valeros gains a new\
  \ ally-focused power to help his neighbors fight, while still retaining cards to\
  \ help him explore on his own turns. When he gains a role card, he can choose to\
  \ focus more on Daredevil-style antics (including an early instance of an “I can\
  \ fight this for you” power), or adopt a Liberator mantle more focused on allies.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>For the <i>Core Set</i>, we wanted to reflect the changes to Valeros\
  \ that were coming as part of the new edition, so Valeros today commonly makes use\
  \ of shield and armor in addition to his hard-earned blades. He also reflects the\
  \ new approach to ranged weapons as a way to coordinate during combat, gaining the\
  \ Ranged skill. This lets him make good use of a wide variety of weapons for his\
  \ own combats and for his friends’ combats, and with some of the exciting special\
  \ effects from certain specific weapons, effectively giving him access to a wider\
  \ toolkit of smash/help/utility while still making him a great choice for a quick-start\
  \ “I hit it. Hard.” character.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharFront.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:30%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharFront.jpg\"\
  ></a><a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharBack.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:30%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharBack.jpg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Another\
  \ new aspect of the <i>PACG Core Set</i> is the regular use of <b>local</b> in effects,\
  \ especially helping effects. The first power of Core Set Valeros lets him add to\
  \ a local combat check, which includes both his own fights as well as other characters\
  \ at the same location. The new template “on a local….” gives us clean, natural\
  \ wording for both “get better yourself” and “help your friends.” Reloading or recharging\
  \ a card to activate this power means there’s a decision involved, but the cost\
  \ is low enough that it can often be a benefit in practice. It lets you make room\
  \ in your relatively small hand for new cards while saving a key card for the near\
  \ or far future if the situation is dicey, and generally helps smooth over unwanted\
  \ “clumps” in your deck. Yet it still keeps Valeros focused mostly on the card types\
  \ most clearly associated with an iconic fighter: weapons and armor. His second\
  \ power similarly helps clearing out clumps, and also makes him effectively tougher\
  \ via a slow, automatic healing-like effect. It also encourages Valeros to make\
  \ use of big “discard to…” effects on weapon and armor cards, producing an overall\
  \ effect similar to previous iterations of the character. </p> \n     <p>In addition\
  \ to these adjustments, Valeros retains his “I can help you fight” concept via the\
  \ new <b>avenge</b> mechanic, wherein a character can “have the back” of another\
  \ character that runs into bad luck or overwhelming odds (or both). Roughly, when\
  \ a character fails to defeat a bane, another local character can step in afterwards\
  \ and take a second shot at the conflict—something that can be especially important\
  \ against henchmen and villains. While this ability is available to everyone under\
  \ the Core Set rules, most characters have to bury a card to do it. Valeros, the\
  \ friendly helpful combat monster, can do it by discarding (or even recharging)\
  \ a card… and if he uses a weapon or armor boon, he can recharge it at the end of\
  \ his turn. Aces.</p> \n     <p>Once you get a role card (which happens 1 adventure\
  \ sooner than it used to), you can choose between Compatriot or Drunken Avenger.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCompatriot.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:30%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCompatriot.jpg\"\
  ></a><a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosDrunkenAvenger.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:30%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosDrunkenAvenger.jpg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Choices, choices. But both good choices!</p>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>As a Compatriot, Valeros becomes something of a “people person.”\
  \ He may use allies to accomplish many of the things he was doing pre-role with\
  \ weapons and armor, including using them to help local combats (his or others),\
  \ “saving” them for later turns, and picking them up more often than normal. He\
  \ gains a shield-focused power to represent the new “sword and board” approach of\
  \ the character. He’s also good at making friends, even potentially “borrowing”\
  \ them from others. On the other side, Drunken Avenger leans into Valeros’ devotion\
  \ to the Lucky Drunk. He can use Liquid boons both for themselves and to “fuel”\
  \ his own abilities, and can even lean into the edges of alchemy, if you are so\
  \ inclined. He might find himself emulating Cayden Cailean’s drunken wandering,\
  \ where—somehow—things usually manage to work out. If some shouting, singing, shoving,\
  \ and even swordplay is involved, more’s the better.</p> \n     <p>That’s it for\
  \ Valeros in the PACG Core Set. Hopefully, he retains the core (heh) characteristics\
  \ that made him fun to play, while adapting some of the new concepts from the second\
  \ edition of the Pathfinder RPG, the new PACG Core Set, and beyond!</p> \n    </blockquote>\
