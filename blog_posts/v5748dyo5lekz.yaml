  \ Preview!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, March 21, 2013</p> \n    <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">It's Savannah\
  \ again. The prodigal intern from last summer returns... for Spring Break anyhow.\
  \ It's been an accidental intern reunion here at Paizo, as my predecessor Jerome\
  \ is helping out in the warehouse this week. Personally, I think I've got the better\
  \ end of the deal, since I get to tell you all about some of our upcoming products\
  \ and how exciting they're looking. So, from the depths of the Editorial Pit and\
  \ my appropriated computer comes an intern's-eye view (when that view isn't \"hiding\
  \ on pallets from the cave raptors.\")</span></p> \n     <div style=\"float: left;\
  \ padding: 0 1em .5em 0;\">\n      <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8c\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1126_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Do you want the power to challenge the\
  \ gods themselves? Then <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8c\"><i>Mythic Adventures</i></a>\
  \ is the book for you! This is the perfect resource to help you take our game up\
  \ a notch, and give your characters the power to challenge the gods themselves.\
  \ <i>Mythic Adventures</i> allows you to take up new mythic magic items, artifacts,\
  \ and legendary items, utilize news feats and spells, and walk one of six mythic\
  \ paths. However, with mythic heroes also come mythic foes, and this book has over\
  \ 40 of them, including mythic versions of the minotaur and the medusa!</p> \n \
  \    <p>Next up is the <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8d\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Demons Revisited</i></a>. This book showcases some of Pathfinder's most vicious\
  \ and well-known demons and provides in-depth information, such as what sins they\
  \ arise from. The balor, the succubus, and the vrock are among the demons mentioned\
  \ here, but <i>Demons Revisited</i> doesn't stop there! There are a list of named\
  \ demons, some of them from previous Pathfinder products, and some of them brand\
  \ new, but each of them unique in their own horrendously cruel ways. This can help\
  \ to add some spice to the conjurations of your villains (or your PCs) and nothing\
  \ says \"personal\" quite like a named summons. As an added bonus, this book ties\
  \ in with the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>!</p> \n     <p>Speaking of Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous, <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8e\"><i>The Worldwound Incursion</i></a>\
  \ is also up for August. One of the most exciting aspects of this Adventure Path\
  \ is that it is the first to utilize the rules of <i>Mythic Adventures</i>, making\
  \ it a truly epic adventure! On top of that, there will be six demon lords featured\
  \ in Wrath of the Righteous, and the first of them will be in <i>The Worldwound\
  \ Incursion's</i> bestiary.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8x8e\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9073_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Continuing our demonic theme is <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8f\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Player Companion: Demon Hunter's Handbook</i></a>. This book explains\
  \ exactly how to eradicate or control demonkind through might or magic. To help,\
  \ there are all sorts of archetypes, feats, spells, and magic items to give you\
  \ just what you need to take care of the vilest of demons and purge them from the\
  \ land (or take their power for yourself...). Don't travel to the Abyss without\
  \ one!</p> \n     <p>For the fans of steampunk out there comes <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8g\"\
  ><i>Wardens of the Reborn Forge</i></a> by Paizo's own Patrick Renie. This module\
  \ takes place in the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which has withstood the ravages of\
  \ the Mana Wastes thanks to the amazing inventions of its citizenry. When the clockwork\
  \ guardians start attacking the townspeople, though, the power balance of the city\
  \ is thrown into disarray. Can our heroes discover the cause behind these attacks\
  \ and save Alkenstar from itself?</p> \n     <p>In case you were wondering about\
  \ what you were going play some of these awesome adventures on, you can look no\
  \ further than the <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8h\"><i>Pathfinder Map Pack: Evil Ruins</i></a>\
  \ for all of your creepy, dungeon-crawling needs! From spider haunts to profane\
  \ altars to overflowing ossuaries, this map pack brings all the horror and dark\
  \ ambiance of unhallowed ruins to your game.</p> \n     <p>If frightening ruins\
  \ aren't what your game calls for, then the <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8i\"><i>Flip-Mat:\
  \ Basic Terrain Multi-Pack</i></a> might be just what you need. Its full-color textures\
  \ include grassland, stone floor, street, and water. It also folds up to be travel\
  \ sized, making it great for the GM on the go.</p> \n     <p>If you haven't had\
  \ enough of demons yet, then I'd suggest that you check out the new Pathfinder Tales\
  \ novel from fan-favorite (and intern-favorite) author Dave Gross: <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8j\"\
  ><i>King of Chaos</i></a>. This is another adventure featuring Count Varian Jeggare\
  \ and his wisecracking hellspawn bodyguard, Radovan. This time they find themselves\
  \ mixed up in the battle at the Worldwound as the demons break free of the <i>wardstones</i>.\
  \ In addition to being an excellent book with interesting characters, <i>King of\
  \ Chaos</i> is also a great resource for those who are running or playing Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6l\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6000A_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \    </div> \n     <p>To round out our Worldwound-themed August comes a <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8x8k\">new set of Pathfinder Item Cards</a>. These cards represent\
  \ the trove of treasure that characters can amass, as well as the medals that heroes\
  \ can earn in their service against the demon hordes and the legendary artifacts\
  \ that they will need to defeat the Abyssal armies.</p> \n     <p>From Paizo's collaboration\
  \ with Lone Shark Games comes an entirely new breed of game: The <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6l\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Base Set</i></a>. This\
  \ is a cooperative card game for one to four players. Choose a class and select\
  \ your cards to create a unique character to play through your first adventure,\
  \ the <i>Burnt Offerings Adventure Deck</i>. If you want even more card game goodness,\
  \ then check out the <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6m\"><i>Rise of the Runelords Character\
  \ Add-On Deck</i></a>, which adds on 110 cards worth of new classes (including druid,\
  \ monk, paladin, and my favorite, barbarian), new items, and enough cards to expand\
  \ to five or six players.</p> \n     <p>All right, well that's a wrap. Let's hope\
  \ that writing this was a good enough offering that I don't get thrown to the cave\
  \ raptors. Hope you enjoy all the new products!</p> \n     <p>Savannah Broadway<br>\
