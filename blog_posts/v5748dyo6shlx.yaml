  \ </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The release of the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024xj?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Bestiary 3</em></a> is just over the horizon, and as a preview of the content\
  \ you'll find within, we wanted to offer an exclusive stat block that GMs can use\
  \ anytime, with or without the book. Former Paizo developer Chris Sims created the\
  \ following creature by turning a clockwork mage into a divine warden (both found\
  \ in Bestiary 3) to make a mechanical servant of Brigh, goddess of clockworks and\
  \ invention. Seems like it might come in handy later this year when <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026mw?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> comes out, doesn't it?</p> \n     <h3>Divine\
  \ Warden of Brigh</h3> \n     <p>Imbued with the divine energy of the goddess of\
  \ clockwork and invention, divine wardens of Brigh are prominent in Alkenstar as\
  \ guardians of the Temple of Brigh there. The Bronze Lady might have her largest\
  \ following in this metropolis. But the city’s boomtown atmosphere means that security\
  \ is a concern even on holy ground. Citizens and visitors to Alkenstar know about\
  \ its wind-up sentries or quickly learn about them. The High Clockmother, head priestess\
  \ of Brigh’s holy place, keeps divine wardens in the goddess's image visible in\
  \ the sanctuary and on the grounds. These automatons are as much a warning to would-be\
  \ thieves or troublemakers as they are an inspiration to Brigh’s worshippers. The\
  \ mixing of divine and arcane in these constructs is intended to show off innovation\
  \ and evoke Brigh’s power over earth, fire, metal, and smoke.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com//a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/604c096a-4527-421a-b7d3-776a1d72eb49/031921_DivineWarden.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p><b>Uncommon N Medium Clockwork Construct Divine Mindless</b></p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Perception</b> +18; darkvision<br> <b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +18<br>\
  \ <b>Str</b> +2, <b>Dex</b> +6, <b>Con</b> +4, <b>Int</b> –5, <b>Wis</b> +2, <b>Cha</b>\
  \ –5<br> <b>Items</b> <em>clockwork wand</em></p> \n     <p><b>Wind-Up</b> For a\
  \ divine warden of Brigh to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature.\
  \ This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for 24 hours, after which\
  \ time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can’t act until it’s wound again.\
  \ The divine warden shuts down immediately once it has 0 time remaining.<br> A divine\
  \ warden can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn’\
  t decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception).\
  \ It can’t act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby\
  \ as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).<br> A creature can attempt\
  \ to Disable a Device to wind a divine warden down (DC 27). For each success, the\
  \ warden loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the warden is\
  \ in standby mode.</p> \n     <p><b>AC</b> 28; <b>Fort</b> +18, <b>Ref</b> +20,\
  \ <b>Will</b> +18<br> <b>HP</b> 135; <b>Immunities</b> death effects, disease, doomed,\
  \ drained, fatigued, healing, mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed,\
  \ poisoned, sickened, unconscious; <b>Weaknesses</b> electricity 10, orichalcum\
  \ 10; <b>Resistances</b> physical 5 (except adamantine or orichalcum)</p> \n   \
  \  <p><b>Clockwork Wand</b> The divine warden uses a mechanical wand as a focus\
  \ to channel magical energy. This wand is built into the divine warden’s chest,\
  \ with only the crystal at the end exposed. The warden can Interact to remove the\
  \ wand, or someone else can remove it with a DC 32 Thievery check to Disable a Device.\
  \ The divine warden becomes unable to cast any spells except cantrips while the\
  \ wand is removed.<br> When removed, the <em>clockwork wand</em> is a <em>magic\
  \ wand</em> containing the last 2nd-level innate spell the divine warden cast (the\
  \ GM determines the spell randomly if the divine warden has not cast any eligible\
  \ spells). The spells are placed within the wand while the divine warden is created,\
  \ and the creator can substitute other arcane spells of the appropriate level.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Divine Destruction</b> (divine, necromancy) When the divine warden\
  \ is reduced to 0 HP, it erupts with divine energy in a 30-foot emanation, dealing\
  \ 10d6 positive damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 29 Will save\
  \ with the following outcomes.<br> <b>Critical Success</b> The creature takes half\
  \ damage.<br> <b>Success</b> The creature takes full damage.<br> <b>Failure</b>\
  \ The creature takes full damage and becomes temporarily cursed by Brigh to be enfeebled\
  \ 1 and stupefied 1 for 1 day; this is a curse effect with a counteract DC of 29.<br>\
  \ <b>Critical Failure</b> As failure, except the creature becomes enfeebled 2 and\
  \ stupefied 2.</p> \n     <p><b>Faith Bound</b> (abjuration, divine) The divine\
  \ warden can’t attack a creature that openly wears or displays Brigh’s religious\
  \ symbol unless that creature uses a hostile action against the divine warden first.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Speed 25 feet</p> \n     <p><b>Melee [one-action]</b> fist +20 (agile,\
  \ finesse), <b>Damage</b> 2d10+6 bludgeoning</p> \n     <p><b>Melee [one-action]</b>\

  \ [one-action]</b> light hammer +20 (agile, thrown 20 feet), <b>Damage</b>2d6+6\
  \ bludgeoning</p> \n     <p><b>Arcane Innate Spells</b> DC 29, attack +21; <b>5th</b>\
  \ <em>cloudkill, cone of cold</em>; <b>4th</b> <em>dimensional anchor, fly, wall\
  \ of fire</em>; <b>3rd</b> <em>haste, invisibility, stinking cloud</em>; <b>2nd</b>\
  \ <em>glitterdust, obscuring mist, web</em>; <b>1st</b> <em>feather fall, floating\
  \ disk, grease</em>; <b>Cantrips (5th)</b> daze, detect magic, ray of frost, shield,\

  \ daze</p> \n     <p><b>Divine Domain Spells</b> 2 Focus Points, DC 29, attack +21;\
  \ 5th hurtling stone, localized quake</p> \n     <p><b>Energize Clockwork Wand [one-action]</b>\
  \ (concentrate) <b>Frequency</b> once per 10 minutes; <b>Effect</b> The divine warden\
  \ regains a spell it has already cast that day. It must spend 1 hour of its operational\
  \ time, or 2 hours if the spell is 3rd level or higher.</p> \n     <p><b>Faithful\
  \ Weapon</b> light hammer, <em>striking</em> rune</p> \n     <p><b>Instrument of\
  \ Faith</b> The divine warden is a beacon for Brigh’s faith. A cleric of Brigh can\
  \ channel a <em>heal</em> spell through a divine warden of Brigh they can see within\
  \ 60 feet. The cleric determines any targets or area for the spell as if they were\
  \ standing in the divine warden’s space.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!--\
