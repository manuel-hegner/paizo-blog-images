  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hadizah stood stiffly between\
  \ two other students—one a degenerate lizardfolk and the other a savage Ekujae elf—\
  as their frail teacher Mawunyo gestured with a staff at the vine-covered towers,\
  \ graceful arches, and broad towers of the Magaambya, greatest magical academy in\
  \ all of the Mwangi Expanse, if not the world. </p> \n     <p>\"You embark now on\
  \ a life of study and service.\" Mawunyo's voice was rich and resonant despite his\
  \ slender frame and reminded Hadizah uncomfortably of the ringing tones of the priests\
  \ of the Deathless Child back home. \"You have been chosen because we see great\
  \ promise within you, passion and will, spirit and intellect, strength and judgment...\
  \ and perhaps a few seeds of wisdom that might sprout and blossom if tended.\" The\
  \ teacher's assistant Kweku chuckled, and Hadizah risked a glance at her. She'd\
  \ been with Mawunyo for years, apparently, traveling with him to the far ends of\
  \ the world (and even, some rumors said, beyond). Her robe's hem was spattered with\
  \ mud and her hair was a thousand messy braids and an hour after meeting her Hadizah\
  \ was more than halfway in love. Inconvenient.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ alt=\"Several terraced buildings in the late afternoon sun, the light filtering\
  \ down from the upper left. The buildings are surrounded by leafy trees and plants\
  \ grow on the sides of the buildings and terraces. On the right, the terrace in\
  \ front of a building is neatly manicured and has a small group of people in robes\
  \ gathered. One holds a staff with a glowing red end up to the sky as the others\
  \ look on. A cloaked, hooded person watches from the stairs leading up to the terrace.\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Mawunyo went on. \"You come from different places, but you\
  \ are all children of the Expanse, as am I. We are the successors and inheritors\
  \ of Old-Mage Jatembe, who taught that those who use great magic bear great responsibility,\
  \ and that we must use our knowledge to better the world. I do this by teaching\
  \ such as you.\" </p> \n     <p>\"And by beating demons to death with sticks,\"\
  \ Kweku said.</p> \n     <p> Mawunyo shrugged his bony shoulders. \"When I am abroad.\
  \ As needed. With sticks made especially for the purpose.\" He thumped his staff,\
  \ which hadn't previously struck Hadizah as particularly threatening, but now did.\
  \ \"We need no such weapons here. Nantambu the Song-Wind City is the safest place\
  \ I have ever lived.\"</p> \n     <p> \"So safe we leave sometimes just to feel\
  \ the thrill of danger,\" Kweku said. </p> \n     <p> Mawuonyo took no notice. \"\
  Those who mean this city harm soon discover the folly of attacking a place hundreds\
  \ of mages call home. No invader has needed to learn that lesson recently. This\
  \ safety gives us the freedom to learn in peace. I am here to help discover how\
  \ your talents might best serve the world.\" He leaned on his staff and gazed at\
  \ each student in turn. The instructor's eyes seemed to penetrate Hadizah's soul.\
  \ Hadizah hoped they couldn't. </p> \n     <p> The old man spoke. \"Tell me: once\
  \ you have attained the power of which you dream, what goals do you wish to achieve?\"\
  </p> \n     <p> The lizardfolk spoke slowly, with many words in a tongue Hadizah\
  \ didn't know, but the gist seemed to be something about improving prospects for\
  \ the females of its species. Perhaps it was female? Hadizah had no idea how to\
  \ tell. Such creatures were not common back in Mzali. Then the elf spoke, something\
  \ abstract about combining arcane and druidic arts to make an alloyed magic stronger\
  \ and more flexible than either alone. Mawunyo and Kweku nodded along thoughtfully\
  \ during these speeches, then turned their gazes to Hadizah. </p> \n     <p> He\
  \ straightened his spine and said, \"I come from Mzali, home of the Deathless Child,\
  \ who rules my people with fire and fear. Do you know the place?\" </p> \n     <p>\
  \ \"I have been there,\" Mawunyo said. \"When it was a place of fading glory, before\
  \ the child mummy Walkena woke and seized control. Not since.\" </p> \n     <p>\
  \ \"Citizens are... not encouraged to leave,\" Hadizah said. \"Walkena demands obedience\
  \ and sacrifice, and his rule is cruel if you do not have his favor. There is a\
  \ group, the Bright Lions, who seek to overthrow Walkena's rule and return control\
  \ of the city to the living. The Lions discovered my interest in the arcane arts\
  \ and offered to help me come here. They did this purely out of kindness... but\
  \ I wish to return that kindness, and to turn whatever power I gain toward their\
  \ cause. If left unchecked, Walkena will achieve his goal of uniting the whole of\
  \ the Expanse under his burning banner. He would put even this place to the flame.\
  \ I wish to prevent that.\" </p> \n     <p> Mawunyo and Kweku nodded at that, just\
  \ as they had at the ambitious proclamations of the other students, and deep in\
  \ his hidden heart Hadizah relaxed. </p> \n     <p> \"Take the afternoon to familiarize\
  \ yourself with your living quarters,\" Mawunyo said, \"and at least the immediate\
  \ areas of the academy nearby. I will ponder what I know of your goals and resources,\
  \ and tomorrow we will meet again to discuss the first steps of your studies.\"\
  \ He turned and walked away, using the staff more as a prop than an aid to walking,\
  \ it seemed to Hadizah. Perhaps he was less frail than he seemed. </p> \n     <p>\
  \ The group broke up, and Hazidah headed for his dormitory, wondering where he might\
  \ find a place of privacy to record the day's events. Kweku fell into step beside\
  \ him. \"Mzali,\" she said. \"You still have people there?\" </p> \n     <p> \"\
  I... not really, not anymore.\" He thought, briefly, of fire, and ashes, and stains\
  \ on stones, but pushed those images away. Actions had consequences. He would make\
  \ wiser choices than his parents and siblings had. \"In a way, all the people in\
  \ Mzali are my people, and deserve liberation.\" That sounded like something a friend\
  \ of the Lions would say. </p> \n     <p> \"I'm sorry to hear that.\" She spun and\
  \ started walking backwards so she could face him while she talked, effortlessly\
  \ going up a set of stairs in reverse. \"This place must be quite a change. Not\
  \ just the change in architectural style, but all the different sorts of people,\
  \ the music in the air, the absence of a pervasive atmosphere of terror....\" </p>\
  \ \n     <p> \"It is a... most refreshing change.\" </p> \n     <p> Kweku nodded\
  \ and preceded him through a wide and empty plaza. \"I wanted to mention, there's\
  \ a small but dedicated group here studying the problem of your Deathless Child\
  \ Walkena. I know some people on it—there's even a Tempest-Sun Mage among them.\
  \ Maybe you'd like to be introduced?\" </p> \n     <p> Hazidah hesitated. He didn't\
  \ know if he'd been sent to this place on orders directly from the child-god Walkena\
  \ himself, as the priest who'd recruited him claimed, or if he was part of that\
  \ priest's own pet project, but either way, his mission was both simple and dauntingly\
  \ complex: find out the weaknesses of the academy, and discover how the mages here\
  \ would deal with an invasion from Mzali, so the Deathless Child might better counter\
  \ their plans. Being part of a group specifically addressing the threat of Walkena\
  \ would be perfect for gathering such information, but it might also expose him\
  \ to greater scrutiny, and his mission was meant to be slow, cautious, and years-long.\
  \ \"I am not sure I have much to offer to such a group.\" </p> \n     <p> \"Oh,\
  \ I don't know.\" Kweku grinned. \"Having a double agent who's trusted by the Deathless\
  \ Child's priests could be very advantageous for us.\" </p> \n     <p> Hazidah froze.\
  \ His hand crept toward the interior of his robe, but Kweku snorted. \"You'd lose\
  \ a fight with me anyway but look up before you even try.\" </p> \n     <p> He quickly\
  \ flicked his gaze upward, and saw something in the air above him, like a flash\
  \ of sunlight on bright metal. The stories said the Tempest-Sun Mages flew high\
  \ above the academy, watching for approaching threats... and they were capable of\
  \ dealing with more dangerous foes than Hazidah. He lowered his hand and gazed levelly\
  \ at Kweku. \"I suppose I should have feigned confusion.\" </p> \n     <p> \"Many\
  \ spies would have, but this saves time. We've known about you since you first applied.\
  \ The spellcraft hiding your lies is good, but we did a deeper delve into your story\
  \ and found some loose threads that unraveled when we pulled on them.\" She stepped\
  \ close to him, and he tensed, expecting an attack, but instead she looped her arm\
  \ through his. \"Walk with me.\" </p> \n     <p> \"Are you taking me to be executed?\
  \ Or to break my mind and make me your servant?\" </p> \n     <p> \"Life under the\
  \ Deathless Child has not been good for you, Hazidah. You see enemies everywhere.\
  \ I'm not your enemy. I'm your teacher. And what I'm going to teach you is that\
  \ you're on the wrong side.\" </p> \n     <p> Hazidah shook his head. Loyalty was\
  \ all—the foundation of every temple, the ground beneath every step, and to transgress\
  \ against Walkena was to face the Punishment of Seven Angry Suns. The priest who'd\
  \ recruited him had made provisions to ensure Hazidah's loyalty even if his faith\
  \ faltered, though. \"Even if I were swayed by your lies, my obedience is compelled\
  \ by powers far beyond my will.\" </p> \n     <p> \"Oh, yes, I know,\" Kweku said.\
  \ \"Your bindings have bindings. Those will have to be removed if we hope to make\
  \ any progress.\" She patted him on the arm. He tried to remember the last time\
  \ he'd been touched in such a friendly way. \"It's a good thing we're in the greatest\
  \ magical academy the world has ever known, surrounded by experts in magic, isn't\
  \ it?\" </p> \n     <p> His heart stirred at her touch. He'd never met anyone like\
  \ her at home—she was intelligent and powerful, but she was <em>messy</em>, and\
  \ impulsive, and outspoken. Everything he should hate: a native of the Expanse who'd\
  \ been corrupted and weakened by the outside world, and who sought to bring that\
  \ poison back home. And it <em>was</em> poison. He could pretend to play along,\
  \ let them think they'd won him over to their cause while he gathered intelligence\
  \ to use against them... surely there were such things as <em>triple</em> agents—\
  \ </p> \n     <p> She stumbled on a loose stone and put her hand on his arm to steady\
  \ herself... then left her hand there as they walked. </p> \n     <p> \"Will you\
  \ be... working with me closely?\" He stared down at her fingers, curled over his\
  \ forearm. </p> \n     <p> \"That's the idea. I'll be your handler, Haz. We'll do\
  \ great things.\" </p> \n     <p> <em>Haz.</em> His heart stirred again, and he\
  \ thought: what if she corrupts <em>me</em>? Would it be better to fight back now,\
  \ and die, still pure? Or had he pledged his allegiance to the wrong flame—the flame\
  \ of his master's power, rather than the flame inside himself? </p> \n     <p> She\
  \ stepped away to lead him through an archway at the base of a dark tower, and when\
  \ her back was turned, he reached out to her. </p> \n     <p> Even he didn't know,\
  \ in that moment, if he was reaching out to strangle or embrace. </p> \n     <p\
