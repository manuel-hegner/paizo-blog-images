  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As the year steadily gets\
  \ closer to ending, the Organized Play Team has been hard at work preparing for\
  \ next year’s content. While we’re still far away from announcing exactly everything\
  \ that is on the horizon for Starfinder Year 3, the team wanted to take some time\
  \ to discuss an important change coming up in the Starfinder setting. Specifically,\
  \ the change in leadership of the Starfinder Society—a new First Seeker!</p> \n\
  \     <p>Back at the end of November, the Organized Play Team hopped onto the <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\" target=\"_blank\">Paizo Twitch Steam</a>\
  \ to detail a whole bunch of new information. During <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXbSIeJ4A_s\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">this event</a>, we announced the winner of our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sguj?Choosing-the-Future-Path\"\
  >recently completed survey</a> to determine the Society’s new leader going into\
  \ Year 3. While many heard the news live on air, we’re pleased to announce here,\
  \ in the blog, that the Starfinder Society’s new First Seeker is Ehu Hadif Ko’ra\
  \ Amares of Clan Tolar.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092519_Eho.jpg\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Ehu, a male kasatha, came up in our initial selection\
  \ process as something of the “quintessential Starfinder”. He’s about bringing the\
  \ Society’s goal of exploration and research back to the forefront of the Starfinder\
  \ Society’s agenda. Given the Starfinder Society’s escapades in the Scoured Stars\
  \ and their more recent multimedia bouts in the Pact Worlds, it seems that Ehu is\
  \ poised to bring the Starfinder Society back to basics in terms of individual missions\
  \ and an overarching goal. His connection with the Kasathan deity known as Talavet\
  \ also allows for the inclusion of some previously unexplored religious elements\
  \ of Starfinder.</p> \n     <p>Organized Play Campaign participants can expect to\
  \ see Ehu take the stage as First Seeker during the events of this summer’s interactive\
  \ special, but until then, First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo still has some loose ends\
  \ to deal with. As we make the transition into our new First Seeker, players should\
  \ note that Luwazi’s Second Seekers faction will move into an inactive status.<br>\
  \ <b>Important Note</b>: this isn’t traditional retirement, just that the factions\
  \ likely won’t have major story roles in coming seasons (similar to the Jadnura\
  \ faction) and we will not have new faction boon options. This does means that a\
  \ new Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif) faction will launch with the new season, so be\
  \ on the lookout for a new faction and a bunch of new related character options!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In increasing the living world feel of the Starfinder Society, we decided\
  \ to start small and see how the experience went, which is why we limited the candidate\
  \ pool to those characters achieving the Second Seeker Capstone Boon. Analyzing\
  \ the process, including feedback on selection and voting, we are ready to expand\
  \ how we handle living world options. In the future, expect Capstone Boon options\
  \ involving inclusion in the campaign to open up for All Factions. Expect to see\
  \ this (and several other quality of life changes) in the Year 3 Guide update, set\
  \ to come out this summer!</p> \n     <p>Overall, the team is incredibly excited\
  \ in the direction that Ehu Hadif is going to take the Starfinder Society into Year\
  \ 3. I’m personally excited for the wide variety of scenarios that this new First\
  \ Seeker is going to let us tell, and the ability to focus on some particular story\
  \ arcs that fans have cited interest in since the early days of the Starfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play Campaign. Trust me when I say, you’ll lose your minds—both literally\
  \ (for your character) and figuratively (for you)—when you hear some of the stories\
  \ we’re going to tell with Ehu Hadif leading the charge!</p> \n     <p>To a bright\
  \ future,</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Thurston\
