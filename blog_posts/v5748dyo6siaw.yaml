  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“Once, epochs and days\
  \ ago, there was a fish who fell into the sea. She was, I must admit, not a very\
  \ nice fish, but a quite angry one.”</p> \n      <p>The boy stared out at the surface\
  \ of the pond. After last night’s storm had scared all the clouds from the sky,\
  \ there was nothing to stop the sun from beating down, and it seemed half the city\
  \ had come to the pond—far from the bone and glass buildings that trapped the heat\
  \ so—to cool off. Children were splashing in the shallows, and three small frogs,\
  \ one red, one blue, one yellow, were croaking on a log (for now, as the blue one\
  \ shall be eaten later) far across the pond. Baranthet and Grandmother sat on one\
  \ of the flat stone rocks by the side of the pond, a picnic basket between them.\
  \ Grandmother dipped her tail in the water, and as the ripples continued, so did\
  \ the story.</p> \n      <p>“The angry fish really had no good reason to be angry,\
  \ having experienced a completely normal life. She had hatched in a river, far inland,\
  \ with hundreds, thousands of her friends. And some of her friends had been eaten\
  \ soon thereafter, by frogs and birds and other fish, as is normal, as is nature.\
  \ And as she swam to the sea, more of her friends had been eaten, as is normal,\
  \ as is nature. Most creatures in the sea were not angry at this—you may as well\
  \ bemoan the sun setting or the sighing of the tides—and so the angry fish kept\
  \ her feelings to herself, but inside, she seethed.</p> \n      <p>“When she reached\
  \ the sea, her school’s numbers had grown lesser, but she found other schools of\
  \ fish, each coming down their own river, and they all swam together, exploring\
  \ the reefs and shelves and trenches. And as they did, every so often, some would\
  \ be eaten by a shark or a squid or a ponguzoan, as is normal, as is nature, and\
  \ the angry fish had to seethe in silence.</p> \n      <p>“One day, though, a shadow\
  \ fell over the water, from a great wood-and-metal ship from above. Nets fell, catching\
  \ hundreds of fish, far more than the great ship could have possibly needed to eat,\
  \ and metal harpoons pierced the sea, skewering hundreds more, just like you’re\
  \ doing to those poor grapes on your claw right now even when you know I’ve asked\
  \ you nicely several times not to play with your food.”</p> \n      <p>The boy turned,\
  \ sheepish, from placing alternating layers of fruit and cheese onto his pinky claw.\
  \ But in truth, Baranthet had lost his appetite, a bit. He wasn’t sure he liked\
  \ this part of the story as much as the last two. He used another claw to scrape\
  \ his food back onto the napkin, then rinsed his hands in the water. “What happened\
  \ then? Did the fish go to the warden?”</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\

  She did, for the Warden of Oceans and Rivers, like all wardens, had great power\
  \ to suit their great size. They could shape the sea and waves however they liked,\
  \ just as the other wardens could do in their domains, and with this, the angry\
  \ fish knew that the warden would—”</p> \n      <p>“They’d maybe make a big wave\
  \ to push the hunters away? Or make it so the fishes could swim away faster with\
  \ the tide? Or maybe even make an iceberg to hide behind?” Baranthet’s head raced\
  \ with the ways that a kind warden might be able to help, but Grandmother let out\
  \ a sigh, a sad one.</p> \n      <p>“No, Baranthet, for it is the duty of a warden\
  \ to protect the creatures under their charge and defend them against the depredations\
  \ of those who abuse them, and the Warden of Oceans and Rivers was nothing if not\
  \ thorough.”</p> \n      <p>In the distance, across the pond, a heron dove at the\
  \ frogs on the log, and though two leapt into the water quickly, the blue frog was\
  \ not so lucky, and it disappeared down the heron’s maw, never to sing again.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“They slaughtered the hunters to the last, in a battle much too graphic\
  \ for your young ears. But when it was done, the seas were safe, and the angry fish\
  \ resolved to follow the warden forevermore.</p> \n      <p>“And ever since that\
  \ day, after every Migration, the Warden of Oceans and Rivers has always been one\
  \ who tolerates no slight against their wards, no incursion into their domain, and\
  \ no hunter who takes with undue cruelty. Remember, Baranthet, that for all their\
  \ splendor, the animals of nature are wild and fierce, and so their boundaries and\
  \ territories must be respected, for they will defend their realms with tooth and\
  \ claw, spark and venom and even magic.”</p> \n      <p>The boy gulped.</p> \n \
  \     <p>“Don’t worry, Baranthet, that’s probably the worst the story gets. Why,\
  \ the last warden is one I’m sure will cheer you up as much as this warm sunlight!”\
  \ And with that, Grandmother jumped into the pond to cool off with a splash that\
  \ sent a wave of cold water over the boy’s head. Her head emerged soon after and\
  \ she shook more drops from her head spines Baranthet’s way.</p> \n      <p>“But\
  \ that, my little explorer, is a story for another day.” </p>  \n      <p style=\"\
