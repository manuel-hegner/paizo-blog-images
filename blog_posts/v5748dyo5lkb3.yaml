  \ and PAX Unplugged!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, December 6, 2017</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As I write\
  \ the final \"First of the month blog\" for 2017, my thoughts roam back over the\
  \ year. The Organized Play community delivered more games in 2017 than ever before—\
  kudos to everyone involved! The biggest news of 2017 was the launch of our new organized\
  \ play program—Starfinder Society. Though it had its hiccups, overall it was a resounding\
  \ success. We are seeing players return to organized play, and many more who are\
  \ new to Paizo and organized play are finding us at events around the world. Over\
  \ the next few weeks, the team and I will write more about our thoughts on 2017\
  \ and what we have in store for 2018. Keep an eye on this space!</p> \n     <h2>PAX\
  \ Unplugged</h2> \n     <p>Several members of Paizo staff, along with a cadre of\
  \ volunteers, spent the weekend of November 17th in Philadelphia at the inaugural\
  \ PAX Unplugged. There wasn't an empty seat in the booth as we ran hour long demos\
  \ using <a href=\"/products/btpy9u7x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Quest-Into-the-Unknown\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Quest: Into the Unknown</em></a>. We had a few repeats,\
  \ but most of our players were new. The enthusiasm and excitement in the booth kept\
  \ me going through some long days. A huge thank you to the volunteers that came\
  \ out and helped, both in the booth and the organized play tables downstairs. We\
  \ greatly appreciate your efforts in spreading the word of the Society!</p> \n \
  \    <p>Paizo and Organized Play are looking to return to PAX Unplugged in 2018,\
  \ with more demos and organized play tables. Currently, PAX is listing November\
  \ 29th to December 2nd as their dates for the 2018 show. Right now the plans are\
  \ nebulous, but if you're interested in helping out in the booth or running Pathfinder/Starfinder\
  \ Society scenarios, save the date and watch this space mid-year for more info!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>DIY Terrain Contest</h2> \n     <p>In August, we opened a competition\
  \ for the best homemade terrain and in November, we presented four entries to our\
  \ community and asked them to vote for their favorite. It is my pleasure to announce\
  \ the winner! The competition was tight, but the entry that received top honors,\
  \ or should I say honours, is <b>Chris Manning</b> from the UK/Online community,\
  \ for their <b>3D ship</b>. Congratulations Chris! A huge kudos to all our participating\
  \ artists, for their wonderful creations—Sam Sampson, Quinn Shannon, Scott Young,\
  \ and Chris Manning</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20171101-Ship.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20171101-Ship_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>5* GM Recognition</h2> \n     <p>Our GMs haven't let\
  \ up the pace in running games and several of them achieved recognition in the past\
  \ month. We saw more additions to the Nova Club, as GMs ran and reported games of\
  \ Starfinder. We also had several GMs completed their 5-star requirements for Pathfinder\
  \ Society. The requirements include running 150 games, of which at least 50 must\
  \ be unique scenarios and 10 be special scenarios, but are not indicative of hours\
  \ spent preparing for events. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5*\
  \ is 650 hours! To those listed below, who earned their 5th star over the past few\
  \ weeks, welcome to the club and thank you for your dedication to our Society</p>\
  \ \n     <ul>\n      <li>Jack Amy</li> \n      <li>Elizabeth R Corrigan</li> \n\
  \      <li>Andreas Frederiksen</li> \n      <li>Mario Grande</li>\n     </ul> \n\
  \     <h2>Conventions</h2> \n     <p>2018 is filling up with conventions, thanks\
  \ to the effort of our volunteer event organizers! Check out the list below for\
  \ upcoming events with Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society play. This iteration,\
  \ we added a column of where you can find the Organized Play staff hitting the tables\
  \ and rolling the dice.</p> \n     <p>While our convention schedule is pretty set\
  \ for 2018, if you are an event organizer and want to invite us out at your event\
  \ in 2019, drop an email to <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>\
  \ before next summer. We review our schedule in the fall and try to get all decisions\
  \ wrapped by the end of the year.</p> \n     <div class=\"callout-block indent\"\
