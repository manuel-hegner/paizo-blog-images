  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>It was well after midnight when Barsala had her breakthrough.</p>\
  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">She was in the temporary laboratory structure\
  \ built for her by Iratha Incorporated deep in the swamps of Zulypsindo, a Near\
  \ Space world known for its extensive marshlands and the site of the latest episode\
  \ of “Dr. B’s Science Jubilee.” The windowless, prefabricated walls provided ample\
  \ protection from nearly any environment outside, and the overhead lighting within\
  \ dispelled the shadows, providing for a clean and efficient work space.</p> \n\
  \     <p>It had been a difficult, but ultimately rewarding, day of shooting. This\
  \ particular program focused on the breed of caypin native to Zulypsindo, a large\
  \ amphibious beast with a mass of detachable appendages that function as both eyestalks\
  \ and chewing mouths. One had been captured for Barsala to show her viewers its\
  \ fascinating anatomy, and everything had gone according to the script… until the\
  \ caypin broke free from its enclosure and nearly ate one of the crew. The poor\
  \ creature had to be put down, but the vidcameras caught every last minute of it.\
  \ Edson Frost, her producer, had spent most of the dinner afterward exclaiming about\
  \ the number of clicks the episode would get. Barsala was similarly excited, though\
  \ she was more interested in getting her hands on the caypin’s corpse.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The exact way the caypin’s appendages functioned independently from its body\
  \ were still a mystery to the scientific community, and Barsala surmised that if\
  \ she could solve even a fraction of that mystery, she could help craft an entirely\
  \ new category of biotech augmentations. When the meal was over, she rushed back\
  \ to the lab, eager to begin experimentation. Hours later, as she inserted a small\
  \ vial filled with a dissolved piece of an appendage into a mass spectrometer with\
  \ one hand and typed frantically on a datapad with another, she reached for her\
  \ comm unit with a third and started a transmission.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ 13px;\">Illustration by Mark Molnar</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>A groggy voice\
  \ answered. “B? Do you know what time it is?”</p> \n     <p>“Not precisely, Edson,\
  \ I’ve been a bit too busy to pay attention to the clock.”</p> \n     <p>“Well,\
  \ it’s late and I was sleeping… trying to sleep. Is there something the matter?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“The quantum measurement paradox!” Barsala blurted.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Who? What?”</p> \n     <p>“It’s not really my area of expertise, but there is a\
  \ theory in quantum mechanics that if you could measure the state of a particle\
  \ frequently—we’re talking thousands of measurements a microsecond or more—you could\
  \ essentially arrest the decay of that particle. Like they say, ‘an observed cooking\
  \ receptacle on a heating unit never reaches its boiling point.’”</p> \n     <p>“\
  B, no one ever says that. But I think I know what you mean.” Edson yawned. “Riveting.\
  \ Is that why you dragged me out of a peaceful slumber?”</p> \n     <p>“Yes! No.\
  \ I mean, sort of. I’ve been in the lab, analyzing one of that caypin’s detachable\
  \ tentacles.” She poked the grisly blood-red tube with a scalpel she held in her\
  \ fourth, cybernetic hand. “It has no internal organs to speak of and should be\
  \ no more animate than a clipped fingernail.”</p> \n     <p>“Gross.”</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Barsala continued. “I wondered: how can these appendages survive apart from\
  \ the host body for days at a time? How does the caypin know where they are and\
  \ how does it call them back? I tested a few hypotheses, and I hit on the idea of\
  \ quantum entanglement. Somehow, the caypin is constantly monitoring the state of\
  \ its removed appendages on a quantum level, preventing them from rotting like dead\
  \ meat!”</p> \n     <p>“Riveting once again. And also gross. But really, you could\
  \ have just written this down for one of your scientific journals.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Right, right, sorry. I also had an idea for the show. I’d love to explain the basics\
  \ of quantum theory to our viewers, maybe start with the wave-particle duality of\
  \ light, do a practical double-slit experiment. We’d have to bring in an expert\
  \ on the subject, of course, and…” Barsala trailed off as she looked down at the\
  \ dissection tray. The appendage she had removed from the caypin’s body was nowhere\
  \ to be seen, only a trail of blood and slime that led to the edge of the table.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Barsala, is everything ok?” Edson asked, though Barsala didn’t hear\
  \ him. She had placed her comm unit down and was already walking tentatively to\
  \ the other side of the lab table. The detached appendage lay on the floor, squirming\
  \ ever so slightly.</p> \n     <p>“Fascinating.” Barsala’s mind raced with possibilities.\
  \ How was this thing moving? Delayed muscle death spasms? An internal parasite eating\
  \ its way free? Necromantic energy? Or…</p> \n     <p>Barsala hissed in pain as\
  \ she felt a sudden sting in her ankle. She turned to see several more of the caypin’\
  s appendages wriggling at her feet, their tiny lamprey-like mouths lunging toward\
  \ her. Surprised, she stepped backward, slipped on the half-dissected tentacle and\
  \ fell onto her posterior. The mass of appendages slithered toward her.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Barsala fumbled for the custom microlab in her lab coat pocket, pointed\
  \ it at the tentacles, and scanned them. Seconds later, she had her answer: they\
  \ weren’t undead. In fact, they were quite normal as far as a handful of ambulatory\
  \ feeding appendages went. She exhaled in relief. Living creatures she could handle.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Before their sharp little teeth could shred her boots, Barsala grabbed\
  \ the edge of the table, pulled herself up to standing, and grabbed a syringe and\
  \ a handful of test tubes. She mixed together several reagents, along with a fast-acting\
  \ catalyst, inserting the resulting mixture into the syringe as Edson’s voice continued\
  \ to call out from the comm unit. With a grunt, she jabbed the syringe down into\
  \ the tentacles. A high-pitched squeal of pain emitted from the mass, and Barsala\
  \ brought back a hand covered in several small bites.</p> \n     <p>“Let’s test\
  \ this hypothesis,” she muttered to no one in particular as she stepped backward\
  \ to a supply cabinet. “If I’m right, the gene-altering chemicals I’ve just injected\
  \ into one of you should affect you all, thanks to your quantum entanglement. Making\
  \ you particularly susceptible to this!” Barsala picked up a container of hydrochloric\
  \ acid from the shelf behind her and hurled it at the throng of tentacles. The glass\
  \ jar shattered, covering the feeding appendages in highly caustic acid. They writhed\
  \ in agony as they dissolved into a disgusting puddle of acrid-smelling goo.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Barsala pressed her damaged hand into an armpit as she gathered up her\
  \ comm unit. “Edson. Edson! I’m fine. Don’t worry. Just a minor accident.” She paused\
  \ for a second. “The caypin. You’re sure it was dead, right?”</p> \n     <p>“We\
  \ hit it with the electric prods until it stopped moving and then put the body in\
  \ the lab’s freezer unit like you asked. Why?”</p> \n     <p>Barsala turned to see\
  \ the freezer’s door wide open. A streak of bloody bile was smeared down the outside.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I’m going to have to call you back.”</p> \n     <p style=\"font-weight:\
