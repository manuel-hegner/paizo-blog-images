  \ Neal F. Litherland</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Three: In the Black</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n     <p>\"Are you sure it's here?\" Trilaina whispered. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Chaplain nodded, thick brown braid bobbing. \"See there and there, the\
  \ stress fracture lines they tried to hide? And how the stone around it is worn\
  \ smooth, but this one spot is chiseled? It's been here a while, but it still doesn't\
  \ fit here.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Dwarves know their rocks,\" Gunner said as he watched\
  \ their back trail. As far as his eyes were concerned, it was still as bright as\
  \ daylight, even with a sky empty of anything except stars.</p> \n     <p>\"My father\
  \ was a stonemason,\" Chaplain said, putting a glare into her voice. Gunner made\
  \ a small gesture over his shoulder, a duelist conceding a point to an opponent.\
  \ Trilaina shrugged and ran her hands over the rock, eyes narrowed as if she could\
  \ see through the stone.</p> \n     <p>\"Even if it is a door—and I'll take your\
  \ word that it is—there would have to be a knob, or a trigger or something...\"\
  \ Trilaina trailed off and smiled. Her fingers disappeared into a hidden niche,\
  \ and something clicked softly. \"Looks like I found our way in.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  ’Bout time,\" the Lieutenant mumbled. \"I'm tired of standing out here in the dark.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Details, details,\" the half-elf murmured. \"Everybody ready?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Tendons creaked and knuckles popped. Cold steel whispered out of\
  \ sheaths and glimmered beneath the moonless sky as the team nodded their assent.\
  \ Trilaina filled her free hand with a nasty little hawkbill blade and opened the\
  \ door. Counterweights turned, pulleys groaned, and the hundred-stone weight swung\
  \ wide.</p> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The assault was precision-perfect,\
  \ and quiet as a greased whisper. They charged into the blackness, teeth bared,\
  \ ready to bring permanent silence to the dark places beneath the mountain. Instead\
  \ they found an empty hallway, the door flanked by dark lanterns and lonely-looking\
  \ chairs. A deck of cards sat on a scarred tabletop, dog-eared and forlorn. The\
  \ air tasted stagnant, and cold as second-day stew. They lowered their weapons,\
  \ and Chaplain pulled the door closed.</span></p> \n     <p>\"Where is everyone?\"\
  \ Trilaina asked.</p> \n     <p>\"They're watching the woods for bogeymen,\" Hook\
  \ said. He popped a match and lit a lantern. \"They're down a patrol, with one man\
  \ still missing in action, and everyone up there is wondering where we are. Just\
  \ as I figured. The way out is a secret, and it's one of about a hundred possible\
  \ approaches. In the dark, most people wouldn't have a shot in hell of finding it.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Where do we go from here?\" Garm asked.</p> \n     <p>\"You and\
  \ Chaplain reconnoiter,\" the Lieutenant said, slinging a leather bag down off his\
  \ back and reaching in to the shoulder. \"Eliminate threats if necessary, but bring\
  \ your mental maps back here. After that, we move on to stage two.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The soldiers nodded, and the darkness swallowed them. Trilaina and Lieutenant\
  \ Hook donned stolen armor stained with blood and took seats at the table. Trilaina\
  \ dealt a hand of a game called king is dead. Gunner leaned on the wall and watched\
  \ the shadows. Denna lay down with her nose on her front paws. She took deep breaths\
  \ and awaited the approach of strangers. Seconds turned to minutes like slow-burn\
  \ alchemy, but none of them moved. They knew their work, and waiting was part of\
  \ it.</p> \n     <p>On the third hand, with Trilaina dealing bottom deck, footsteps\
  \ approached. They heard the soft whisper of bare flesh on the stony floor flanked\
  \ by two sets of boots. Hands wrapped around hilts, and eyes turned to the shadows.\
  \ A girl with close-cropped hair, strong shoulders, and a shapeless shift wrapped\
  \ around her body walked out of the darkness, Garm and Chaplain on either side.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Taking in strays now, are we?\" Trilaina asked. Garm held up his right\
  \ hand. The knuckles gleamed with fresh, red blood.</p> \n     <p>\"There were supposed\
  \ to be two guards at this post,\" he said. \"They decided no one would come in\
  \ this door, so they went off to have a bit of fun.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Is that what\
  \ they're calling it these days?\" Chaplain's frown pulled her entire face taut,\
  \ and her dark eyes simmered. Garm nodded grimly.</p> \n     <p>\"I hope you didn't\
  \ show them your gentle side,\" Trilaina said. Garm shook his head. </p> \n    \

  \     </div> \n     <p>Chaplain gently touched the girl's arm. \"Go on, Rulla. Tell\
  \ the Lieutenant what you told us.\"</p> \n     <p>The girl stared at them, hard\
  \ eyes still suspicious. She swallowed and looked back where she'd come from. Apparently\
  \ she considered them the lesser of two evils.</p> \n     <p>\"The guards put us\
  \ all in our cells hours ago,\" she said. \"They took every digger out of the hole\
  \ and filled every bolt room. Except for Regan and Goblin, everyone else is up on\
  \ the wall.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Goblin?\" Gunner raised an eyebrow.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Ugly whoreson,\" Garm replied. \"My guess is his parents probably saw one and decided\
  \ it was a fitting name.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Go on, Rulla, tell him the rest.\" Chaplain\
  \ silenced her squadmates with a look. Rulla licked her lips.</p> \n     <p>\"When\
  \ the last guards went up, they barred the ore gate,\" she said. \"There's no way\
  \ in or out except the rear door unless that main gate is opened.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ Irregulars looked at each other for several long moments, letting the significance\
  \ sink in. The Lieutenant smiled, and his troops smiled back. He stripped off the\
  \ stained leather and tossed it aside. Trilaina slit the lacing and peeled her disguise\
  \ off like an unwanted second skin. Garm lit the second lantern and handed it to\
  \ the half-elf.</p> \n     <p>\"New plan, everyone.\" The Lieutenant rubbed his\
  \ hands together. \"Gunner, get outside and watch the hilltop. If someone realizes\
  \ the mountain's bleeding out the rear passage, they're going to stopper us up from\
  \ both ends.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Consider it done.\" Gunner mounted up, and Garm opened\
  \ the door far enough for the duo to slip back into the dim night. He closed it\
  \ without letting the door catch.</p> \n     <p>\"Garm, did you get the keys from\
  \ the guards?\" Both the half-orc and the dwarf took out two sets of well-used iron\
  \ keys. The Lieutenant nodded approvingly. \"Rulla, is everyone down here a slave?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Yes, sir.\" Her eyebrows drew together. She looked unsure, but\
  \ she also clearly knew it was too late to stop, even if she wanted to.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Good. Are there any hard cases we need to know about?\" </p> \n     <p>Rulla\
  \ shrugged. \"I suppose.\" </p> \n     <p>Hook nodded, stroking his chin. \"Anyone\
  \ that belongs in this hole?\" </p> \n     <p>Rulla narrowed her eyes. \"You're\
  \ just trusting me? Just like that?\"</p> \n     <p>\"He does that,\" Garm said,\
  \ looking back into the darkness.</p> \n     <p>\"And you'd just leave them in those\
  \ cages?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Probably not,\" the Lieutenant admitted. \"But I might\
  \ make sure they went last, after everyone else got a head start. That would make\
  \ them the most likely to be caught, and it would give everyone else more time to\
  \ get away.\"</p> \n     <p>\"No,\" Rulla said. The Lieutenant raised one bushy\
  \ eyebrow. \"No, there's no one that I think will make trouble. No one wants to\
  \ be here, and if they were given a choice, they'd run till their feet bled.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Hopefully it won't come to that,\" Chaplain said.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  There's only two keys, but we have to be fast.\" The Lieutenant sucked his teeth,\
  \ glaring at the imaginary clock in his head. \"Garm, you and Chaplain unlock the\
  \ cages and send people back to this room. We'll make this our jump-off point. Small\
  \ groups, easily mobile. Look for night-sights and moonbeams, spread 'em around\
  \ as necessary so we don't have a bunch of scared people stumbling around in the\
  \ dark and making all kinds of noise. We can't give them lights, much as we might\
  \ like to. They're a high priority, but not number one.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What are\
  \ you going to do?\" Trilaina asked. </p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant pointedly sat\
  \ down in the chair he'd vacated a moment ago. \"I’m going to supervise. From here,\
  \ I can bottleneck either way, and keep a leash on this whole thing.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Garm, Trilaina, and Chaplain nodded, then scattered. Silence rolled in like\
  \ an ebb tide. </p> \n     <p>Rulla looked at the Lieutenant, who took out a long-stemmed\
  \ pipe. At last, she could stand it no more. </p> \n     <p>\"Why are you doing\
  \ this?\" she asked.</p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant slowly crossed his good leg over\
  \ his bad one, then lit the pipe and puffed. \"Why are you here, Rulla?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"I was sold to a slaver by my husband to pay gambling debts to a bookie\
  \ in Laekastel.\" Her tone was flat, yet the Lieutenant could still hear coals burning\
  \ beneath the ashes.</p> \n     <p>\"Cheliax.\" The Lieutenant turned the nation's\
  \ name into a curse. \"Molthune is a small man with big plans. It has everything\
  \ it needs to become an empire: ore, timber, fertile soil, and a defensible border\
  \ to keep it safe from invasion. But you can't fight wars without soldiers, and\
  \ you can't reap or sow without farmers. It’ll take too long to do it the old-fashioned\
  \ way. The saber rattlers want to be kings now. So they buy slaves.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Rulla nodded. The Lieutenant blew a smoke ring, then cocked his head and listened.\
  \ He stood, holding the lantern high.</p> \n     <p>They appeared like bog ghosts—\
  filthy, pale will-o’-wisps with wide eyes and bent backs. Most were human, but an\
  \ occasional dwarf or half-breed stood out among them. Down in the darkness, they'd\
  \ all become one, and it was as one they came to escape. The Lieutenant looked at\
  \ them and grinned, tapping out his pipe as he blew the remnants through his nose\
  \ like a dragon scenting prey. He glanced at Chaplain and jerked his head. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>The dwarf stood up on the rickety chair, facing the room. The assembled\
  \ slaves stared at her with red-rimmed eyes.</p> \n     <p>\"Prisoners of Molthune,\
  \ listen close.\" Chaplain was never loud, but when she spoke people listened. A\
  \ murmur went through them, and they shuffled forward to hear her. \"You have been\
  \ bought and sold. You have been brought to this place and turned into little more\
  \ than cattle that can swing a pick and carry stones. Today that life is over. Today\
  \ we’re giving you back the freedom that never should have been taken from you.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>A soft, furtive cheer went up, as ragged and dirty as the men and\
  \ women that offered it. Chaplain held her arms out, quieting and embracing them\
  \ all as she continued.</p> \n     <p>\"The night is long and the mountains are\
  \ treacherous. You need to move quickly and quietly. You’ll have to help each other\
  \ get away. Eagerness will get everyone caught, so listen carefully and do as you're\
  \ told.\"</p> \n     <p>Trilaina and Garm took charge, dividing the escapees into\
  \ small groups. They went quickly, quietly, slinking out of the mountain as Gunner\
  \ led them to safety. One group left, another got ready, and soon the numbers dwindled\
  \ to nothing.</p> \n     <p>\"Good speech,\" the Lieutenant said.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Thank you sir,\" Chaplain replied.</p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant flipped the flap\
  \ on his bag of tricks and dug down deep. He pulled out a wooden cask, stoppered\
  \ with cork and smelling strongly of sulfur. Then another, and another, stacking\
  \ them nearby. He eyed every member of the team, lips peeling back in a wolfish\
  \ grin.</p> \n     <p>\"Now comes the fun part.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
