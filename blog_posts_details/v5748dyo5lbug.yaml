  artist: "the vizier of a decadent kingdom for a wealthy nobleman, this cloak was\
    \ imbued with sentience so that it might spy on the nobleman's business dealings\
    \ and report to the vizier. As the months went by, however, the cloak realized\
    \ it was meant for greatness and that neither man was worthy of its power. Calling\
    \ itself Darnisan, it revealed itself to the nobleman, pretending to be an agent\
    \ of his god, and told him of his vizier's treachery. Enraged, the nobleman confronted\
    \ his vizier, and in the ensuing battle, both were slain. Unfortunately for Darnisan,\
    \ it was buried with its master, and has been waiting in his tomb ever since for\
    \ the right individual to claim it and its power. Personality: Darnisan is slow\
    \ to reveal its true nature to anyone with the arrogance to don it. It usually\
    \ takes a bit of time to determine if the wearer is worthy and how best to shape\
    \ him into a true and noble leader before making itself known. Darnisan is haughty\
    \ and thinks very highly of itself. It seeks to be the mantle of a great ruler\
    \ and will encourage its wearer in whatever way it can to lead him into greatness,\
    \ even if that means mortal danger. If Darnisan finds its wearer to be unworthy,\
    \ it might eventually form a plan to be rid of him and to end up in the hands\
    \ of a more worthy individual. Should Darnisan gain control of a character, it\
    \ immediately attempts to take control of the situation or find a more worthy\
    \ host. Powers: Darnisan is a cloak of minor displacement that also grants its\
    \ wearer a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. It also has the hiding special\
    \ ability, described in the previous article, which it uses to make itself invisible\
    \ if someone truly unworthy finds it. It has a special purpose, to be worn by\
    \ and defend a ruling monarch or leader of a large city. If it finds its wearer\
    \ promising, it can cast resist energy and stoneskin on its wearer each once per\
    \ day (caster level 7th). Finally, the cloak has the uncaring drawback, as it\
    \ truly does not care about its wearer, only the greatness that such a wearer\
    \ might bestow on the cloak. This only applies if the cloak does not think the\
    \ wearer could be great, and as such, the ego reduction is only a â€“1. Darnisan\
    \ has the following statistics. Alignment Lawful neutral. Int 14 Wis 12 Cha 16\

  artist: "the countless battles it has fought History: Back in a more barbaric age,\
    \ this sword was made for the sole purpose of taking life. Given to a powerful\
    \ warrior, Thirst, as it would later be known, was used to carve a swath of death\
    \ and destruction across the land, changing hands sometimes more than once in\
    \ a single day. As the years passed, all of the souls that were claimed by the\
    \ blade began to coalesce into a single consciousness, one that desired only more\
    \ life. It hungers for blood and for the life of living creatures. Those who wield\
    \ the blade for long periods of time find that it draws in their life force, causing\
    \ them to hunger for life at the same time. This can turn the wielder into a vampire.\
    \ Its current wielder is one such individual, a powerful vampire that uses Thirst\
    \ to slay countless innocent creatures every night. It remains at its side to\
    \ this day, consuming just as much life as its master. Personality: Thirst knows\
    \ nothing of pity or remorse. It seeks only to kill and consume. It grows angry\
    \ and restless when not in use, and should it go more than a few days without\
    \ killing, it grows hostile to its wielder and attempts to control him to go on\
    \ a murderous rampage. Thirst is very powerful, making it worth keeping, but should\
    \ it gain control of its wielder, it becomes a serious danger to all those around\
    \ it. Powers: Thirst is a +2 keen vicious wounding longsword. When Thirst is used\
    \ to perform a coup de grace, the DC to avoid death is increased by +4. Thirst\
    \ can cast vampiric touch three times per day (caster level 18th). Slaying all\
    \ creatures is its special purpose, and it can cast enervation at will, but only\
    \ when targeting a living creature. Finally, whenever the blade is used to coup\
    \ de grace a creature, its wielder gains a permanent negative level. If the wielder\
    \ dies due to negative levels in this way, he rises as a vampire 24 hours later.\
