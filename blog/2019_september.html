                <p>When Tar-Baphon rose once more, they didn’t even have the chance to fight.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>A magical blast of unfathomable power vaporized Lastwall’s capital of Vigil in an instant. By the time the survivors rallied, there was no victory to be found, only bitter efforts to evacuate civilians and desperate pleas to prevent comrades from throwing their lives away for a nation that was already dead. It was in the wake of utter failure—some of which was undoubtedly the fault of the knights themselves—that the Knights of Ozem proved their courage and character. They stood back up again and rallied once more, knowing they were doomed to fail again in countless battles to come, yet still holding faith that their efforts would make a difference.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190927-lastwallcrusader.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190927-lastwallcrusader_500.jpeg"></a>

                </div> 
                <p>With the loss of Lastwall weighing on them, what remained of the Knights of Ozem fell apart. The fraction of knights that remained soon found themselves at a crossroads. Do they flee Lastwall, their ultimate mission a failure, or do they stand and fight once more? Well, if evil roams the world, it must be stopped. And with that, many of these knights discarded the formal structure they were once committed to and chose to put the fight against evil and the dedication to righteousness above all things. (Check out Liane Merciel’s <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwp?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-Seeds-of-Hope">fiction</a> from a weeks ago for a stirring rendition of this dedication!)</p>

                </div> 
                <p>While the Knights of Lastwall are more decentralized than ever, lacking an official headquarters and official leaders, the knights still maintain a semblance of structure. The knights move in groups, mostly made up of anyone willing to fight the hordes of the Whispering Tyrant, with leadership falling to whomever among the group has earned the most respect or influence among their fellow knights. In large scale conflicts, some knights take on roles as strategic leaders, only to return to the status of an everyday knight once the battle is done.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190927-lastwallmage.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190927-lastwallmage_500.jpeg"></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Even in this more informal structure, the Knights of Lastwall break up into two large subfactions. The first are the Shining Sentinels, they are the crusaders and defenders of the knights, committed to the defense of innocents and stemming the spread of undeath. They are the heirs of Lastwall’s cause and are hoping to rally forces to a new Shining Crusade against the Whispering Tyrant. Characters who affiliate with the Shining Sentinels can take the Knight Vigilant archetype, a 6th-level dedication. The archetype is focused on defense, allowing you to provide cover to allies, increase your proficiency with heavy armor, and gain resistance against attacks from undead. The Knight Vigilant also gains access to the Aegis of Arnisant feat.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190927-aegisofarnisant.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190927-aegisofarnisant.png"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>The other subfaction within the Knights of Lastwall are the Crimson Reclaimers. The Crimson Reclaimers are less concerned with defending the already protected bastions of civilization and instead seek to take the fight to the undead directly. If the Shining Sentinels are the shield that defends the innocent, the Crimson Reclaimers are the blade that cuts down the forces of evil. They travel directly into the Gravelands to fight toe to toe with the countless undead that roam the region, rescuing any civilians that may still be trapped beyond the front lines. In addition to their great skill at combat and infiltration, every Reclaimer swears the Crimson Oath, a mysterious rite that grants additional power against the horrors of the undead. </p>

                </div> 
                <p>Characters that wish to join the Knights of Lastwall, but aren’t necessarily dedicated to either the Shining Sentinels or the Crimson Reclaimers still have a number of options available to them. As many of the Knights of Lastwall are champions and fighters, the section offers a selection of feats for both of these classes, some of which grant new focus spells like the sun blade focus spell for champions. The spell allows champions to fire a ray of sunlight from their weapons, dealing fire damage, good damage, and positive damage to evil undead, and even grows more powerful when the sun is in the sky. Beyond that, the knights have access to a variety of equipment to aid in their fight against evil such as the armored skirt and the fauchard. The knights even make use of magical equipment like glorious plate, full plate armor that can blind a knight’s enemies, and the deadly serrating rune!</p>

                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_LiniRotRCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_LiniRotRCharacterFront_360.jpeg" alt="Rise of the Runelords: Lini, Character C, Female Gnome Druid."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_LiniRotRCharacterBack.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_LiniRotRCharacterBack_360.jpeg" alt="Rise of the Runelords: Lini, Character C, Favored Card Type: Ally."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Arguably, the <del>best</del> strongest character in Rise of the Runelords.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Paul Peterson, a great guy and amazing designer, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5li9y?Pauls-Best-Character-Ever-Lini">once wrote all about how Rise of the Runelords Lini was the best character ever</a>. A secret I did not reveal when I wrote <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhf9?Keiths-Best-Character-Ever-Enora">my best character blog</a> is that I agreed with him, but it would have been a lot less interesting if we both wrote a blog about Lini. The next dirty little secret [note: not really a secret] is that Paul and I could both be called power gamers.</p> 
                <p>I once handed a high-level Rise of the Runelords Lini to a friend to play for a session and she asked what her character was good at, to which I replied, “everything.” She could recharge animals to explore, reveal animals for 1d4+4 to all checks, and carry some of the best spells in the game like Augury and Cure. Hard to beat.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_LiniSSCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_LiniSSCharacterFront_360.jpeg" alt="Skull &amp; Shackles: Lini, Character C, Female Gnome Druid."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_LiniSSCharacterBack.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_LiniSSCharacterBack_360.jpeg" alt="Skull &amp; Shackles: Lini, Character C, Favored Card Type: Ally."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Sometimes you just want to swim with the fishes. And talk to them. And have them help you seize pirate ships. All that.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Skull &amp; Shackles Lini gives up her bonus to every check in the world for even more amazing mastery of all Animal allies. She’s also better at using her version of the RPG’s wild shape ability to use a d12 for her Strength or Dexterity. With the right support, she can be an exploration machine, and she’s got two of the most important skills for <i>Skull &amp; Shackles</i>: Fortitude and Survival.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CDLiniFront.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CDLiniFront_360.jpeg" alt="Druid Class Deck: Lini, Character B, Female Gnome Druid."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CDLiniBack.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CDLiniBack_360.jpeg" alt="Druid Class Deck: Lini, Character B, Favored Card Type: Ally."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Oddly, the Lini with the most animals is also the only one pictured without Droogami.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p><i>Druid Class Deck</i> Lini explored a pretty different direction from the previous two Linis. No longer attempting to emulate wild shape, she went all in on wielding her animals as her weapons. Her skills got a bit of a bump, making her pretty reliable at recharging spells and combat. If you go with her Pack Lord role and fill her deck with animals, you really do feel that “Everything is cool when you’re part of a team.”</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreLiniFront.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreLiniFront_360.jpeg" alt="Lini, Character 0, Gnome Druid."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreLiniBack.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreLiniBack_360.jpeg" alt="Lini, Character 0. Lini is a friend to all the savage beasts of the forest, soothing their hungers and redirecting their baser instincts. With her snow leopard Droogami nearby, she collects sticks from every forest she has visited, a wooden road map of her travels; should she settle down, they may become a house."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Lini’s new portrait really lets you see the details in her hair and face.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>One of the first changes I made to <i>Core Set</i> Lini was to replace her Knowledge skill with Perception. It fit better for how I’ve seen every druid in the RPG, as well as the ways we tend to use Perception and Knowledge in the ACG. I knew that I wanted to give her a power like Class Deck Lini, because in play it feels so much more like you are actually using your menagerie of friends. I also knew that I wanted to stop worrying about armor and weapon proficiency with her.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreAllyCat.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreAllyCat_360.jpeg" alt="Cat, Ally 0, Animal."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CurseAllyHippogriff.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CurseAllyHippogriff_360.jpeg" alt="Hippogriff, Ally 6, Animal, Mount."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Animals help with all kinds of checks. A fair number involve mauling your enemies, but not all!</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Lini benefited a lot from Core’s focus on local teamwork. Her allies in Core and Curse are far more likely to be able to benefit her friends, and her power lets her cycle them more quickly back to her hand. She can also add a d4 to every Animal check at her location, helping everyone gather animal friends and defeat Animal banes, and also helping Lini’s own combat checks.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreAllyDroogami.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreAllyDroogami_360.jpeg" alt="Droogami, Ally 1, Animal.

Magic, Divine, Animal."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Droogami is a great reason to be Lini. Aspect of the Monkey just makes me smile every time I see it.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>She also gets to start with a level 1 card, the only named ally in Core: Droogami. Droogami helps out some of Lini’s favorite kinds of checks. She also gets to recharge or shuffle Droogami back into her deck for mobile explores, so you’re likely to want to keep Droogami forever. Convenient, since Droogami is an important part of her backstory and artwork.</p> 
                <p>Because she doesn’t need to worry too much about Attack spells or weapons, Lini can focus on utility spells like Aspect of the Monkey. In addition to bearing a truly excellent piece of artwork by Vicky Yarova, it’s a solid bonus for Lini to display for the entire turn, and her extra die for Animal checks applies to its recharge check (as well as any other Animal spells you might pull from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdn">Ultimate Wilderness</a> and/or the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9sxh">Hunter Class deck</a>).</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreArmorHide.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreArmorHide_360.jpeg" alt="Hide Armor, Armor 0, Light Armor."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreWeaponLuckyStarknife.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreWeaponLuckyStarknife_360.jpeg" alt="Lucky Starknife, Weapon 2, Knife, Melee, Ranged, Piercing, Finesse, Magic."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Her art’s got armor and a weapon, so Core Lini does too. You can learn to love them, though.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>I wanted to stick with a more balanced spread of boons than RotR Lini had, at least in part because I knew we were going to make weapons and armors better cards for her. Now she can display armor and take a sling or knife to assist with combat checks, or a quarterstaff or bolas to avoid some banes. Hide Armor really shines in Lini’s hands as a great proactive choice, adding a big bonus to her check. It won’t absorb a sudden big hit as well as Chain Mail, but if instead you need to turn into a bear and tear an enemy apart, it’s got (or at least is on) your back.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreRoleWildWhisperer.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreRoleWildWhisperer_360.jpeg" alt="Lini, Role 0. Wild Whisperer. Everything talks, if you know its language."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreRoleWorldWalker.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreRoleWorldWalker_360.jpeg" alt="Lini, Role 0. World Walker. The world is her cloister."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">I assume all Lini roles from now on need to start with double W’s. Suggestions welcome!</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>As a Wild Whisperer, Lini focuses on her Animal companions, improving all Animal checks at her location, especially her combat checks using them. She also has a few powers (themed around using wild shape) to improve her physical skills or gain Acrobatics and Fortitude.</p> 
                <p>Her World Walker role instead focuses on her surroundings, adding to all checks at Wild locations (a common location trait in Core and Curse) and moving more easily. Along with her wider travels, she also becomes resistant to poison and elemental damage (useful for survival in some of the more extreme corners of Golarion and beyond) and learns to use herbalism to remove scourges from her party.</p> 
                <p>That’s our new Lini! She’s self-reliant and versatile and feels like a great druid in play. </p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>It was well after midnight when Barsala had her breakthrough.</p> 
                <p itemprop="description">She was in the temporary laboratory structure built for her by Iratha Incorporated deep in the swamps of Zulypsindo, a Near Space world known for its extensive marshlands and the site of the latest episode of “Dr. B’s Science Jubilee.” The windowless, prefabricated walls provided ample protection from nearly any environment outside, and the overhead lighting within dispelled the shadows, providing for a clean and efficient work space.</p> 
                <p>It had been a difficult, but ultimately rewarding, day of shooting. This particular program focused on the breed of caypin native to Zulypsindo, a large amphibious beast with a mass of detachable appendages that function as both eyestalks and chewing mouths. One had been captured for Barsala to show her viewers its fascinating anatomy, and everything had gone according to the script… until the caypin broke free from its enclosure and nearly ate one of the crew. The poor creature had to be put down, but the vidcameras caught every last minute of it. Edson Frost, her producer, had spent most of the dinner afterward exclaiming about the number of clicks the episode would get. Barsala was similarly excited, though she was more interested in getting her hands on the caypin’s corpse.</p> 
                <p>The exact way the caypin’s appendages functioned independently from its body were still a mystery to the scientific community, and Barsala surmised that if she could solve even a fraction of that mystery, she could help craft an entirely new category of biotech augmentations. When the meal was over, she rushed back to the lab, eager to begin experimentation. Hours later, as she inserted a small vial filled with a dissolved piece of an appendage into a mass spectrometer with one hand and typed frantically on a datapad with another, she reached for her comm unit with a third and started a transmission.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092619_Barsala.jpg"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092619_Barsala.jpg" alt="Barsala, the iconic kasatha biohacker, jots down notes on a tablet with one hand while the other holds a pair of surgical scissors near a bloody mass of tentacles sitting atop her lab table."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Mark Molnar</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>A groggy voice answered. “B? Do you know what time it is?”</p> 
                <p>“Not precisely, Edson, I’ve been a bit too busy to pay attention to the clock.”</p> 
                <p>“Well, it’s late and I was sleeping… trying to sleep. Is there something the matter?”</p> 
                <p>“The quantum measurement paradox!” Barsala blurted.</p> 
                <p>“Who? What?”</p> 
                <p>“It’s not really my area of expertise, but there is a theory in quantum mechanics that if you could measure the state of a particle frequently—we’re talking thousands of measurements a microsecond or more—you could essentially arrest the decay of that particle. Like they say, ‘an observed cooking receptacle on a heating unit never reaches its boiling point.’”</p> 
                <p>“B, no one ever says that. But I think I know what you mean.” Edson yawned. “Riveting. Is that why you dragged me out of a peaceful slumber?”</p> 
                <p>“Yes! No. I mean, sort of. I’ve been in the lab, analyzing one of that caypin’s detachable tentacles.” She poked the grisly blood-red tube with a scalpel she held in her fourth, cybernetic hand. “It has no internal organs to speak of and should be no more animate than a clipped fingernail.”</p> 
                <p>“Gross.”</p> 
                <p>Barsala continued. “I wondered: how can these appendages survive apart from the host body for days at a time? How does the caypin know where they are and how does it call them back? I tested a few hypotheses, and I hit on the idea of quantum entanglement. Somehow, the caypin is constantly monitoring the state of its removed appendages on a quantum level, preventing them from rotting like dead meat!”</p> 
                <p>“Riveting once again. And also gross. But really, you could have just written this down for one of your scientific journals.”</p> 
                <p>“Right, right, sorry. I also had an idea for the show. I’d love to explain the basics of quantum theory to our viewers, maybe start with the wave-particle duality of light, do a practical double-slit experiment. We’d have to bring in an expert on the subject, of course, and…” Barsala trailed off as she looked down at the dissection tray. The appendage she had removed from the caypin’s body was nowhere to be seen, only a trail of blood and slime that led to the edge of the table.</p> 
                <p>“Barsala, is everything ok?” Edson asked, though Barsala didn’t hear him. She had placed her comm unit down and was already walking tentatively to the other side of the lab table. The detached appendage lay on the floor, squirming ever so slightly.</p> 
                <p>“Fascinating.” Barsala’s mind raced with possibilities. How was this thing moving? Delayed muscle death spasms? An internal parasite eating its way free? Necromantic energy? Or…</p> 
                <p>Barsala hissed in pain as she felt a sudden sting in her ankle. She turned to see several more of the caypin’s appendages wriggling at her feet, their tiny lamprey-like mouths lunging toward her. Surprised, she stepped backward, slipped on the half-dissected tentacle and fell onto her posterior. The mass of appendages slithered toward her.</p> 
                <p>Barsala fumbled for the custom microlab in her lab coat pocket, pointed it at the tentacles, and scanned them. Seconds later, she had her answer: they weren’t undead. In fact, they were quite normal as far as a handful of ambulatory feeding appendages went. She exhaled in relief. Living creatures she could handle.</p> 
                <p>Before their sharp little teeth could shred her boots, Barsala grabbed the edge of the table, pulled herself up to standing, and grabbed a syringe and a handful of test tubes. She mixed together several reagents, along with a fast-acting catalyst, inserting the resulting mixture into the syringe as Edson’s voice continued to call out from the comm unit. With a grunt, she jabbed the syringe down into the tentacles. A high-pitched squeal of pain emitted from the mass, and Barsala brought back a hand covered in several small bites.</p> 
                <p>“Let’s test this hypothesis,” she muttered to no one in particular as she stepped backward to a supply cabinet. “If I’m right, the gene-altering chemicals I’ve just injected into one of you should affect you all, thanks to your quantum entanglement. Making you particularly susceptible to this!” Barsala picked up a container of hydrochloric acid from the shelf behind her and hurled it at the throng of tentacles. The glass jar shattered, covering the feeding appendages in highly caustic acid. They writhed in agony as they dissolved into a disgusting puddle of acrid-smelling goo.</p> 
                <p>Barsala pressed her damaged hand into an armpit as she gathered up her comm unit. “Edson. Edson! I’m fine. Don’t worry. Just a minor accident.” She paused for a second. “The caypin. You’re sure it was dead, right?”</p> 
                <p>“We hit it with the electric prods until it stopped moving and then put the body in the lab’s freezer unit like you asked. Why?”</p> 
                <p>Barsala turned to see the freezer’s door wide open. A streak of bloody bile was smeared down the outside.</p> 
                <p>“I’m going to have to call you back.”</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Legends say only a single man survived the doom that befell Fog Peak Hold. The Pathfinder sages will tell you that’s wrong: five made it out alive, though only three were still sane. The little matter of the collapse of the eastern pass had made the hold irrelevant by that point, and I guess the Taldans have been busy with other matters for the last few hundred years, so the place was never reoccupied.</p> 
                <p>That didn’t mean no one was interested in it, though, even knowing the last master of the hold had taken up strange habits. Venture-captain Kerivik Stormhand had been eager to get his hands–maybe I should say eyes–on a cache of old maps housed in the hold’s library and a few others, like me, had grown curious about the last master’s reputed interest in golden figurines. Ilvana, well, she was Kerivik’s favorite blade woman. She pretty much went wherever he did, even if that was halfway up a forbidding peak in the Taldan wilderness.</p> 
                <p>A switchback staircase led part of the way, and then a rockslide had taken out everything but the three stairs short of the old brass gate. Still, Kerivik was an old hand with mountains and got the three of us up safely. That’s when I took over. I won’t bore you with the harrowing details of disarming the trapped entry–I’m certain you’re well aware of my splendid facility with locks. Pretty soon the three of us were making our way down the main hall. </p> 
                <p>The wind can get pretty wicked up there in the Fog Peaks, and it made free play through the hold, owing to the way the old wooden shutters had rotted off the high windows. I could hear it moaning a lot more clearly than I could hear Kerivik’s grumbling to be careful. Every now and then it gusted so violently it rattled the suits of armor standing along the hall. A couple of them had succumbed to gravity over the years, but most stood as they’d been left long years before, ready for their long-vanished owners to don and wade into battle.</p> 
                <p>Kerivik stopped to inspect a sealed portal. Me, I headed on toward a distinctive warm gleam I spotted shining on a pedestal just a few paces away. Gold, as sure as the scars on my face. It was a kneeling figurine of a slim horned man with a snarl, draped in spiderwebs. I’d heard the old master had an interest in demonic lore, and this would likely be quite the boon for the Society’s Grand Archive—if not Eando Kline and the Vigilant Seal.</p> 
                <p>As I reached for the thing the wind picked up once more and I heard a heavy whoosh from our rear, a shout of surprise from Ilvana, and a rattle of armor from the nearest suit.</p> 
                <p>Turning toward the commotion while keeping an eye on the likely evil relic, my notoriously keen senses and Cayden’s own luck alerted me that the armor had rattled a little too loudly to be from the wind. Sure enough, the suit over my shoulder had lifted a long sword over its helm in preparation to lop off my head. Kerivik shouted something from behind as I leapt back, the blade missing me by a handspan.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092619_PathfinderSociety.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092619_PathfinderSociety.jpg" alt="At the end of a dark hallway lined with imposing statues of armored knights, a rogueish-looking half-elf extends one hand toward a small golden figurine while his two companions in the background narrowly avoid being struck by a pair of bladed pendulums."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Busy as I was dodging head blows, caught my first glimpse of what my partners were up to. Blades had started swinging down from either side of the hall, one of them so razor sharp it had sliced a few feet of deep green fabric off her cloak. Seeing our means of escape quickly cut off by the swinging scythes, Kerivik redoubled his efforts to pry the stone doorway open. I didn’t have the time to really assess the situation, though, with the idol’s defender still upon me.</p> 
                <p>The armor stepped forward, pivoted with military precision, and swung for me again. I’ve been a Pathfinder long enough to know that only magic or a spirit was likely to be making that thing move, and the odds of me hurting either with my blade, fine as it was, were slim to none. But there are other ways to stop a rampaging suit of plate mail, and I slid left of its next strike then threw myself forward. It’s counterintuitive, I know, but rather brave, as you probably noticed. </p> 
                <p>I caught the armor about its waist, smashing my chin into its waist chain, and sent it off balance. It reeled backward, slammed into the pedestal, and fell in pieces. I dropped with it and rolled. The figurine fell too, of course, and plummeted right past my face. I’d forgotten I was holding my sword and it rattled off along the ancient stones.</p> 
                <p>It’s a good thing I was already low, because damned if the big scythes didn’t choose that moment to start swinging down across my side of the hallway. I heard Kelivik shout that the weapons were getting lower and snagged the haft of my blade. That snarling figurine was just out of reach.</p> 
                <p>Not so one of the steel gauntlets from that vanquished suit of armor. I swear the fingers were pulling it back toward a steel arm right when a blade struck the wrist and dragged it along the floor with a deafening screech of wounded metal. If I’d been a moment later that would have been my own hand.</p> 
                <p>“Stop staring at the gold, Nerian!” Kelivik shouted at me. “Get back!”</p> 
                <p>Now I was perfectly capable of losing myself in contemplation of especially fine gold, but I swear at that instant I was still stunned a little by how close that blade had come, and I was watching in awe as sparks flew from the wriggling armored fingers as the gleaming scythe pulled it across the rough stone floor. Proving Kelivik’s assessment of my motivations wrong, I turned from the idol and scrambled back through the stone portal just as he and Irvana disappeared into the darkness beyond. </p> 
                <p>For once we lucked out. We stumbled right into the master map room, where tube after tube of old parchment lay under a thick layer of dust in their honeycomb shelves, including all sorts of old records Kelivik didn’t even knew he needed until he started looking around. True, there was also a golden statue identical to the one that had lured me nearly to my death guarding the stacks. It was twice the height of a man, but the rumors about how deadly it was are exaggerated–the thing was so slow Irvana and I managed to keep it distracted while Kelivik grabbed up his goodies.</p> 
                <p>The darned thing was so large it couldn’t even get through the portal, so we ended up with quite a head start before it had bashed its way out. By the time it reached us we had already started down the ropes. It surged out of the fortress doors, took three steps, and then ran out of stair and abruptly plunged about six hundred feet down the mountainside. We had ample time to observe that none of its component pieces were moving as we climbed down to safety. It was too heavy to haul the whole thing with us, especially with Kelivik’s trusty haversack full to overflowing, but we did manage to drag one of its arms back to the lodge. And that was pretty nice. I might go back to get more of it soon—as long as adventure doesn’t call me off in another direction, of course.</p>

This scenario represents a major step for the Organized Play Campaign, as we introduce players to the four potential new leaders of the Starfinder Society!</p> 
                <p><i>Four for the First</i> acts in many ways like a quest pack-style scenario as the core revolves around thefour candidates seeking the mantle of First Seeker. The PCs partake in four distinct quests, each pertaining to an area of interest to one of the four candidates. That is where the similarity to standard scenarios ends. Unlike most scenarios, we highly encourage groups to book as much time as needed to complete this adventure, even if that requires booking this over multiple game sessions—we really want to make sure each of our candidates has a time to shine!</p> 
                <p>Speaking of our candidates, let’s get a quick preview of each potential First Seeker.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Calder Soren is morlamaw (detailed in Alien Archive 3) who’s risen within the Society and has a desire to see the establishment and recovery of lodges out in Near Space and the Vast.</li>

                <p>Now the logistics: Voting opens <b>Wednesday, September 25th, 2019, at 4 pm Pacific</b> time, and closes <b>November 20th, 2019, at noon Pacific</b> time. We hope leaving a wide window between scenario launch and the end of voting offers our players opportunity to interact with all candidates before voting. Each player may experience the scenario multiple times (replayable, right?!?), just with different characters, and we encourage multiple playthroughs. Getting to know the candidates is important, as each player may only vote once no matter how many times their characters play the adventure, so be sure to get all the replays in before placing your vote. </p> 
                <p>For players who don’t play the scenario during the voting window, no problem! The scenario remains playable (and repeatable) after November 20th, players just don’t get the opportunity to vote for the new First Seeker. </p> 
                <p>We chose Survey Monkey as our platform. Once you’ve played the scenario, return here and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZBHK3JQ">click here to vote!</a> We will also post links to the voting on Facebook and Twitter so that more people can find the survey, as well as post some reminders during the voting period. We would also appreciate any procedural feedback as comments on this thread, to help us refine our processes should we do something similar in the future.</p> 
                <p>Next week, join us for the October installment of our regular feature - Stars, Cons, Spotlights!</p> 
                <p>Looking forward to the all votes,</p>

Written by Kendra Leigh Speedling, this scenario springboards right off the events of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0205t?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-206-The-Stumbling-Society-Part-1-Sangoros-Lament">Starfinder Society Scenario #2-06: The Stumbling Society, Part 1: Sangoro's Lament</a>. Sangoro’s Gifts obviously has some major spoilers from the previous part in this two-part adventure series, but the premise remains fairly concrete: the PCs travel to a planet where someone is air-dropping advanced weapons onto technologically undeveloped planet. Without giving away too much, this adventure plucks on a lot of different tones, like the ethics of interfering with technologically undeveloped cultures and a little bit of Battle Royale style gameplay. Players definitely will want to check this scenario out, especially if they’ve played the first part in the series.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">The daughter of a renowned biotechnician and a respected priest of Talavet, Barsala Zharliska Sonari of House Ulanda grew up in Trillidiem, the arcology of bubble-shaped domes that floats above Bretheda’s northern pole. Her parents maintained a household in which discussion and debate were encouraged, with most dinnertime talks focused around the dichotomy between faith and science. Even at a young age, Barsala was included, her questions and opinions treated with respect. As a result, she found herself drawn to studying scientific disciplines, but focused on how they could help her neighbors and her community. Barsala witnessed the power of community early in her life when she lost her lowleft hand due to severe nerve damage sustained in a nasty fall and many of her family’s neighbors came together to help her get used to her new cybernetic prosthesis.</p> 
                <p>Years later, Barsala earned her doctorate from the prestigious Sui Saolus Academy and landed a job as a junior research assistant at Iratha Incorporated, a biotech firm in Trillidiem founded by a lashunta and a kasatha. Despite barathus nearly dominating the biotech field, Iratha Incorporated is a successful corporation, focusing exclusively on augmentations for humanoids. Barsala was happy with her job, but after several months, she began to worry that her research—though pivotal for reducing implant rejection rates among other things—was far too niche. She wondered if there was something else she could do to aid the community at large.</p> 
                <p>Explaining her dilemma to a friend, Barsala hit on an idea that sparked her interest: she would start a regular holovid stream in which she would explain the basic concepts of science to viewers in a way that was fun and engaging. Branding herself as “Dr. B,” she rented a small studio, set up a simple lab, donned a white lab coat, and began broadcasting in her off hours. Dr. B’s first holovids featured very basic principles—gravity, magnetism, and the like—and her production values were rough around the edges, but Barsala’s enthusiasm and easy-to-understand explanations quickly gained her a wide audience on Bretheda’s infosphere and beyond. </p> 
                <p>However, her program didn’t reach the same popularity as reality shows and sporting events until it caught the attention of Thalus Enthremian Damru, the kasatha co-founder of Iratha Incorporated. He saw the show’s potential as a marketing tool but also respected Barsala’s commitment to education. One day, Thalus approached Barsala in her Iratha lab to offer her holovid stream an official sponsorship, which would include a new studio, as well as a small staff to ensure that everything looked and sounded professional. Her new role as “scientific ambassador” was added to her job description, and she soon became the holovid icon she is today.</p> 
                <p>“Dr. B’s Science Jubilee” is popular with young sentients throughout the Pact Worlds and most of Near Space, thanks to Barsala’s engaging personality and flashy experiments. With Iratha Incorporated’s funding, Barsala has been able to travel across the galaxy to showcase interesting scientific phenomena first-hand, including such topics as the life cycles of unusual flora and fauna, the formation of bizarre minerals and crystals, and the odd interactions between certain fundamental forces of physics. Some of the program’s most shared episodes feature Barsala being introduced to a new species of alien animal (often with hilarious results) and the kasatha putting a scientific myth to the test (usually accompanied by explosions).</p> 
                <p>Between these on-location shoots, Barsala continues her research on biotech augmentations, and occasionally, topics on her show have led her to small breakthroughs in her work and research. While these advancements have garnered some praise in the scientific community, most people only recognize the kasatha through her holovid work, with some people even believing that the “Doctor” part of “Dr. B” is merely an affectation. Nevertheless, Barsala presses on with both aspects of her job, hoping she can positively impact the lives of people in one way or the other.</p>

                <p>The Hellknights are a widespread organization that spans the Inner Sea region, though many of its orders are located within Cheliax. At its core, the organization is dedicated to enforcing and upholding law and order. The Hellknights believe the letter of the law to be absolute and understand that without a commitment to law, the world is under threat of succumbing to the terrors of chaos and disorder.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-rackhellknight.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-rackhellknight_500.jpeg" alt="An Order of the Rack Hellknight in a face-covering half helm and flowing blue rags wields a dangerous-looking whip."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Hellknights follow a massive set of laws and virtues known as the Measure and the Chain. The Measure collects all of the countless laws and strictures that make up the Hellknights’ code. These laws take inspiration from the structure and order of Hell itself, with many Hellknights seeing the order of Hell as something to aspire to and emulate. The Chain presents the Hellknights’ most important virtues: order, discipline, and mercilessness. Keeping these ideals in mind, the Hellknights seek out lawbreakers and those who threaten the stability of order, punishing them to the utmost extent of the law regardless of the crimes committed. Compassion of any kind leads to anarchy and, as all are guilty of some infraction, no mercy shall be spared for those who break the law.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-godclawhellknight.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-godclawhellknight_500.jpeg" alt="A Godclaw Hellknight in gray plate armor covered in reddish blades holds a spiked flail in one hand and his helmet in the other."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Characters who want to become Hellknights will have to undergo rigorous training to even be considered for entrance into the Hellknights. This training is represented in the form of the Hellknight armiger archetype, originally found in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zoj?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide">Lost Omens World Guide</a>. Since every Hellknight has to be an armiger first, it’s a very important archetype for would-be Hellknights. In fact, it’s so important that we decided to expand on the archetype just a bit by providing new feats to support it! Once you go through the process of becoming an armiger, you are faced with the Hellknight Test in which you fight a devil in one on one combat. Succeed and you become a full-fledged Hellknight. Fail and you die. Pretty simple. Once you become a Hellknight, you have access to the Hellknight’s signature armor!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-hellknightplate.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-hellknightplate_500.png" alt="Hellknight Plate, Item 2. Uncommon, Bulwark. Price 35 gp; Usage worn armor; Bulk 4; AC Bonus +6; Dex Cap +0; Check Penalty –3; Speed Penalty –10 feet; Strength 18; Type Heavy; Group Plate. Few armors in the entire Inner Sea region are as memorable as the iconic Hellknight plate. While each order has their own flourishes, Hellknight plate is instantly recognizable to any who know of the Hellknights. Hellknights go to extreme measures to punish non-Hellknights who get their hands on Hellknight plate, and the reward is not usually worth the risk, as the armor is functionally similar to full plate."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>The Hellknights are not a monolith. Though every Hellknight follows the Measure and the Chain, the organization is broken into several orders, each of which have a different focus. The Order of the Chain (who were the stars of a recent <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwo?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-Rat-Trap">piece of fiction</a> by Liane Merciel) are dedicated to tracking down criminals who have eluded the hand of the law, at least for the moment. The Order of the Pyre instead focuses on rooting out religions, philosophies, and scientific endeavors that could disrupt the status quo. The Hellknights have seven major orders, which are detailed in the book as well as several smaller orders that feature brief descriptions.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-pyrehellknight.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-pyrehellknight_500.jpeg" alt="An Order of the Pyre Hellknight in spiked blue-gray armor raises a hand wreathed in blue glowing magical energy."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Maichol Quinto</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Characters that become members of the Hellknights must join one of these orders in order to become a full-fledged Hellknight. Because each order has a distinctive focus, we wanted to provide options to characters that better represent their affiliation with their respective orders. To that end, we created a new set of feats, Order Training and Advanced Order Training, to allow Hellknight characters to gain unique abilities that are only available to their order. Both of these feats are available to Hellknights, Hellknight Signifers, and Hellknight armigers, so you can access these abilities regardless of where you are along your career path. The Order Training feat gives you lesser abilities, like the Order of the Nail’s ability to ignore non-magical difficult terrain, while the Advanced Order Training gives greater power, like the blessing available to members of the Order of the Godclaw.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-ordertraining.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-ordertraining_500.png" alt="Order Training, Feat 8.

You can instead use this ability to bring a creature within 30 feet that has died within the last round back from the dead. If you do, the creature is restored to 1 hit point and is doomed 1 for 24 hours."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Unfortunately, we only had enough space to get order abilities for the seven major orders. If and when we get a chance to look at the Hellknights again (maybe in a book focused on Old Cheliax? Who knows! Let us know if you want that!) we will get a chance to expand further on the orders and provide new options. In addition to the above options, the book provides details on the various ranks among the Hellknights, such as Maralictor and Paralictor, as well as information on the Lictors of each of the Hellknight orders. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention one of the biggest options available in this book: the Hellknight and Hellknight signifier archetypes!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-gatehellknight.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-gatehellknight_500.jpeg" alt="An Order of the Gate Hellknight in a red cloak and hood, face hidden by a swirling magical vortex, raises one hand crackling with fiery magical energy."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Building off of the Hellknight armiger archetype, these two archetypes allow Hellknight characters to reach their full potential. Hellknights are fierce warriors clad in Hellknight armor and bringing about brutal justice wherever they go. Hellknights are the big, tough combatants among the organization and have different abilities to represent that, like the scaling of their proficiency in Hellknight plate and attacks like the Blade of Law.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190920-bladeoflaw.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190920-bladeoflaw_500.png" alt="Blade of Law, Feat 12. Archetype. Prerequisites Hellknight Dedication. You call upon the power of law and make a weapon or unarmed Strike against a foe you have witnessed breaking or disrespecting the law or otherwise acting disorderly. The Strike deals two extra weapon damage dice if the target of your Strike is chaotic. Whether or not the target is chaotic, you can choose to convert all the physical damage from the attack into lawful damage."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Hellknight signifers on the other hand are more focused on spellcasting. They typically provide support to other Hellknights on the battlefield, but are no less dangerous and dedicated than their fellow Hellknights. Signifers wear unique masks that in addition to being quite intimidating, also grant unique abilities. For example, with the Signifer’s Sigh feat you gain darkvision and lessen the effects of being dazzled, while Gaze of Veracity feat allows you to cast <i>glimpse the truth</i> as a focus spell.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-signiferdedication.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-signiferdedication_500.png" alt="Hellknight Signifer Dedication, Feat 6.

You have bolstered your force of will with the power of the Measure and the Chain. Upon initiation, you receive a signifier mask, often devoid of eyeholes or other decorative features. The mask doesn’t obscure your vision, though it makes it impossible for others to see your eyes. While wearing your signifer’s mask, you gain +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Lie, Intimidation checks, and Deception DCs against Sense Motive. You gain expert proficiency in Intimidation (or in another skill in which you’re trained of your choice if you were already an expert in Intimidation) as well as in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion. Special: You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Hellknight signifer or Hellknight armiger archetypes."></a>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>“Raia! Report status!”</p> 
                <p itemprop="description">Raia executed the last commands, feeling the change in the engine’s thrum as the <i>Voidspear</i> shifted course. She cued her coms. “All right, I’ve got good news and bad news.”</p> 
                <p>From far across the void, where the <i>Sunrise Maiden</i> currently hid on the far side of the moon, Navasi said, “Why don’t I like the sound of that?” </p> 
                <p>“The good news is that I’ve successfully rerouted the <i>Voidspear</i> into a decaying orbit. It should hit atmosphere in three minutes and break up over the planet’s surface.”</p> 
                <p>“And the bad news?”</p> 
                <p>Something huge boomed against the door to the bridge, accompanied by angry shouts.</p> 
                <p>“I’ll let you know in three minutes.”</p> 
                <p>“Raia—”</p> 
                <p>“Just be quiet and let me think, please.”</p> 
                <p>Navasi’s silence radiated disapproval, but at least it was silence. Raia looked around the empty bridge, taking in her options.</p> 
                <p>The original extraction plan was scrap. There were easily twenty drow soldiers between her and the escape pods—far too many to fight past. And while her security seal was holding for the moment, it was only safety in the most shortsighted sense. She was bottled up on a ship that would shortly begin tearing itself apart.</p> 
                <p>Of course, she could always undo the course change. Set the ship back in a stable orbit, wait for the drow to breach the blast doors, and throw herself on their mercy.</p> 
                <p>“Yeah, right,” she whispered to herself. “No thanks.”</p> 
                <p>She opened the captain’s internal hailing frequency, hearing the tone echo throughout the ship.</p> 
                <p>“Crew of the <i>Voidspear</i>,” she began, cool as a Triaxian glacier. “This ship will enter atmosphere and begin self-destruction in two minutes—you can see the truth of this on your nav readouts, or out the viewports with your own eyes. As your unauthorized pilot, I advise you to abandon ship immediately.” </p> 
                <p>That earned her more shouts from the hallway outside.</p> 
                <p>They wouldn’t evacuate, of course. Not most of them—drow were notorious for their zealotry, and their matriarchs would probably have any survivors executed anyway for losing a crucial warship like the <i>Voidspear</i>. But at least she’d given them the option. She’d avoided unnecessary loss of life as best she could.</p> 
                <p>Now for her own. Beyond the viewport window, the planet loomed large, the curve of its horizon rapidly flattening with proximity. Above it, the darkness of space beckoned, safety and danger in equal parts.</p> 
                <p>All right, then—if she couldn’t reach the escape pods, she’d just have to make her own.</p> 
                <p>First up: propulsion. There was no point exiting the ship just to follow it down the gravity well. Letting her eyes defocus, she summoned her magic and visualized what she needed. </p> 
                <p>This was the part that always looked like—well, <i>magic</i> to the uninitiated. And it was, but not in the way they thought of it. Technomancy wasn’t about just making wishes or reciting incantations. You had to understand the mechanics behind what you were doing, as clearly as if you were building something with your own hands. Control circuitry, discharge chamber, ion accelerator grid, hollow cathode neutralizer—every component mattered. Miss one relay or power processer, and all you had was a fancy sculpture. Assuming you didn’t blow yourself up.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Green lines glowed in the air before her, a three-dimensional wireframe technical drawing that expanded, gaining substance and heft, until the glow disappeared and the completed jetpack dropped into her waiting arms. She slapped a spare battery into it and watched the readouts light up. Fully functional.</p> 
                <p>Excellent. She slipped on the harness. </p> 
                <p>The next spell was easier—one of the first any sensible spacer learned. Putting one hand to her head, she formed a bubble of breathable atmosphere, extending the field down around her body. Not a great way to travel the stars for any length of time, but at least she wouldn’t immediately freeze, boil, or asphyxiate. </p> 
                <p>Alarms began to blare throughout the ship. Beneath her feet, the deck shuddered as structures intended solely for vacuum encountered their first fatal traces of atmosphere. </p> 
                <p>Time to go. Raia stared out the window, fixing a point in mind. Then she took a deep breath and cast the final spell.</p> 
                <p>Darkness. Weightlessness. Agoraphobia slammed into her as her brain suddenly recognized the lack of a ship’s comforting constraints around her. She fought down the urge to panic, willing herself to continue breathing deeply. Slowly, deliberately, she triggered the jetpack’s roll thrusters, spinning a hundred and eighty degrees.</p> 
                <p>Below, the <i>Voidspear</i> fell away from her, making its final dive into the blue and white of the planet. Already, delicate struts were breaking away, the hull glowing red with heat. As she watched, a single escape pod shot free—deserters choosing to take their chances with the matriarchs.</p> 
                <p>Good for them. Opening up her own engines to maximum, Raia accelerated hard, climbing toward a stable orbit. As she did, she reopened her coms. “Raia here. Mission complete.”</p> 
                <p>“Raia!” Navasi’s voice was gratifyingly relieved. “Are you all right? Where are you?”</p> 
                <p>Raia looked around, taking in the void stretching endlessly all around her.</p> 
                <p>“Well,” she said, “I’ve got good news and bad news...”</p>

                <p itemprop="description">“Come on, Couvo!” Seliette tugged at his sleeve, breaking his concentration and causing his complex mental translation to collapse into gibberish. He blinked up at his fellow student, confused by her voluminous waterproof cloak. The last time he’d gone outside onto the grounds of the Magaambya, the sky had been blue and cloudless. He hadn’t been sequestered in this reading nook <i>that</i> long, had he? Maybe Seliette was off on another of her field trips. He could hardly keep track of all the to-ing and fro-ing she did with her assorted mentors. “Come on where?”</p> 
                <p>She twirled, cloak spinning out around her. “Come and join the dance!”</p> 
                <p>He grunted. “Pass.” The tome before him, chronicling a supposed journey through the Doorway of the Red Star, hadn’t been written by Old-Mage Jatembe himself, of course—the true history of the founder of this school (though it was strange to call a place with no real classes or schedules a school!) was shrouded in myth. This book <i>was</i> written by a scholar whose grandmother had heard the tale as a child from a descendent of one of the Ten Magic Warriors, and that was as close to a primary resource as Couvo was likely to get. “This is too important. I can dance once I’ve ascended to Conversant.” Couvo had recently finished his term as an Initiate, after spending a year sorting a room full of scrolls and tomes recovered on an expedition a decade prior and never properly catalogued. Since being promoted to Attendant he’d been assisting the arcanist Thanda (some called her Thanda the Wanderer; others Thanda the Plunderer) with translating some of her finds from prior expeditions. Couvo had come to the Magaambya after a period of study at the College of Mysteries in his native Absalom because he’d heard there were works of great antiquity hidden away in the Mwangi Expanse. Though he’d found the Magaambya bewildering in many respects, it hadn’t disappointed in terms of treasures to translate.</p> 
                <p>Seliette plopped down across from him and pulled the book out of his hands. He sighed, knowing better to protest. Seliette was a native of Nantambu whose parents were associated with the academy, and she’d grown up in the towers, vaults, halls, and fields of the Magaambya. She was an Attendant too, and for reasons of her own, she’d decided to take Couvo under her wing, a position he found more pleasant than annoying as a whole. Without her guidance, he'd still be wondering where all the lecture halls and laboratory exercises were instead of successfully navigating the looser, stranger approach to the magical arts the faculty took here. “Did I say dance?” she said. “Forgive me. I meant to say, 'Come see a high-level collaboration between primal and arcane adepts in a rare demonstration of the power of halcyon syncretism’.”</p> 
                <p>“Oh.” Couvo closed the book. “Why didn’t you <i>say</i> so?”</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091919_Magaambya.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091919_Magaambya.jpg" alt="In a sunlit forest clearing, a young woman wearing a red skirt, an assortment of bracelets, and stripes of white face paint dances surrounded by drummers, while a crows of smiling spectators looks on."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Tomasz Chistowski</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>“This looks exactly like dancing.” Couvo stood off to the side of a line of drummers who pounded their instruments with a beat so compelling it threatened to co-opt the rhythm of his own heart. A leaf fell on his head, and long grass tickled his ankles beneath his robe. Couvo hated being outside. Hadn't he seen the sky enough for a lifetime on his journey to the Mwangi Expanse?</p> 
                <p>“Some of the spellcasting I’ve seen you do looks like extremely complicated waving,” Seliette said. “Or as if you’re fending off a swarm of bees. This dance is both an ecstatic celebration of life, and one component of a spell blending natural and arcane magic.” </p> 
                <p>“What are they trying to do?” Couvo looked around the gathering in the clearing beneath the trees, trying to figure out who was taking part in the ritual and who was a spectator like him. The woman with the elaborate spiral paint was surely involved, but what about the catfolk, and—was that a Nidalese man? It was amazing who ended up here. There were a few people wearing Magaambyan masks, too—antelope, lion, even lizard—who were probably taking part. As an Attendant Couvo had the right to create such a mask, which would allow him to access his spiritual self more directly, and would gradually take on a life as its own and serve as a sort of familiar... but he found the notion of such a second face disconcerting, and since the masks weren’t compulsory, he’d avoided the issue. </p> 
                <p>Seliette spread her arms. “They’re going to make it rain.”</p> 
                <p>Couvo glanced at her, wondering why she looked so excited. There <i>were</i> clouds gathering, and controlling the weather was advanced magic, certainly, but several of Couvo’s teachers back in Absalom could have called thunderstorms or even tornados, if the season was right, and they wouldn’t have needed a drum line and a crowd of collaborators to manage it. “That’s it? Rain?”</p> 
                <p>She laughed. “Making it rain here, I admit, is not so impressive. But the Aspis Consortium has caused a terrible drought in one of those barbarous nations you have up there.” She gestured vaguely northward. “A group of us plan to travel there and bring the rain back.”</p> 
                <p>“So... this isn’t a ritual to summon a shower for a few hours?” That was the extent of the weather control he knew about.</p> 
                <p>“Oh, no. The arcane methods of weather manipulation get things started, but the primal magic connects more deeply to the land and the air, restoring balance to the area, in a sustainable, ongoing way: healing the climate rather than just changing the weather.” </p> 
                <p>“So the arcanists provide the spark, and the primal magicians create the fuel that keeps the fire going,” Couvo said. He could feel the change in the air now, the drop in pressure, the scent of rain. </p> 
                <p>“A fire metaphor isn't particularly apt," Seliette said, "but more or less. It's not just arcane here and primal there, though. The powers collaborate, and some adepts use both forms of magic at once—that's halcyon magic, the blending of traditions to create something new and marvelous.” She put her arm around him. “Isn’t that why you’re <i>here</i>, Couvo? Or did you just come to read old things? Books are wonderful, but to serve the Magaambya is to live in the material world and change it for the better. You could come with us and lend your own strength to our dance.” </p> 
                <p>He hunched. “I’ve got so much work to do, Seliette—”</p> 
                <p>“If you want to stay in your reading hole, Thanda will continue to take advantage of your talents, I'm sure… but she’ll keep you as an Attendant forever. If you hope to become a Conversant, and direct your own studies, you have to go <i>out</i>.” She cocked her head. “Tell me, Couvo. What are you doing all this studying for? What’s the purpose?” </p> 
                <p>It was a question he’d considered before, and always pushed back to think about later... but maybe later was now. There was a certain appeal to staying where it was warm and dry, translating the things Thanda brought back from her expeditions, working firmly within the limits of his competence, but he knew Seliette was right—that was beginner’s work, not substantively different than what he’d done as an Initiate… or even what he’d done back in Absalom. He’d always believed in the value of knowledge for its own sake, but could there be new satisfaction in using that knowledge for a purpose? He'd just translated a scroll reputedly copied from a Shory manuscript about manipulating weather patterns to benefit their legendary flying cities, and perhaps, with the proper blend of primal magic, it could be useful here…</p> 
                <p>Rain began to fall, just a few drops at first, and Seliette spread out her arms and spun in a circle, dancing to the drums and laughing her bell-ring of a laugh. After a moment, Couvo reached for her hand and spun with her, as the heavens opened and delivered their bounty.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">We’ve got an exciting array of products getting ready to release for you all, so I’m going to skip the standard preamble and jump right into the juicy meat you all came here for: scenario and quest descriptions!</p> 
                <p>Our first new Tier 1-4 scenario from author Scott Young is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0217k?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-104-Bandits-of-Immenwood">Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-04: The Immenwood Bandits</a>. While the PCs often find themselves at the center of whatever calamity currently befalling agents of the Society, this time they’re called in to help out another group of Pathfinders. Returning from a research mission in Garund, a group of Pathfinder agents was beset by all manner of catastrophes, from storms to wood-rot to beasts of the sea. Barely surviving their journey they ran aground at a small village near Absalom and managed to drag themselves to the Grand Lodge.</p> 
                <p>Steward of the Grand Lodge Ambrus Valsin and Chief Archivist Zarta Dralneen request the PCs travel to the town, near the Pathfinder's landing site, and escort a cart containing the prior group’s discoveries through the Immenwood and safely back to Absalom. What could possibly go wrong?</p> 
                <p> One thing to watch for in this release is a sidebar update integrating the new Challenge Point scaling system from the <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/encyclopedia/pfs2guide/">Organized Play Guide</a>. This integration departs from the way we previously formated our adventures. We’d really like feedback from our GMs on whether these sidebars are providing you with the tools you need to run these adventures in an organized play environment. We've got a few weeks before we need to decided whether to change our formatting in future products. Please post feedback in the comments below. </p>

                <p>Our next Tier 1-4 scenario, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0217l?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-105-Trailblazers-Bounty">Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-05: Trailblazer’s Bounty</a>, takes us far away from the Isle of Kortos, to the mountain ranges separating Isger and Molthune. Cheliax’s aggressive tendencies over the past decade have not been overlooked by the nation’s neighbors, and Druma, in particular, engages in a quiet trade war that threatens to weaken Cheliax without giving the devil-run nation an excuse to respond with military force. Instead, Chelish leadership seeks a different resolution to their troubles: a state-sponsored bounty for the first group of explorers to chart a safe trade route from their vassal state Isger to the nation of Molthune in the north, creating a new passage that can bring economic prosperity to both nations.</p> 
                <p> Not about to let the Pathfinders be outdone in the finding of new paths, Calisro Benarry, leader of the Horizon Hunters faction of the Society, called for the most intrepid explorers to take up the challenge and chart this new route. Along the way, the PCs can expect dangerous wildlife, fierce orcish warriors, and the treacherous mountain passes themselves. Moreover, the PCs are not the only ones seeking to claim the Chelish bounty. Can the Pathfinders live up to their name, or will they be buried by the dangers of the trail?</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091819_VengeantThorn.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091819_VengeantThorn_500.jpeg" alt="A multicolored centaur with flowing red hair raises a gnarled green staff over its head as it rears up on its hind legs."></a>

                <p>The final release this month is a Tier 1-4 quest, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0217m?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-2-Unforgiving-Fire">Pathfinder Society Quest #2: Unforgiving Fire</a>, set near the island nation of Jalmeray. Venture-Captain Rashmivati Melipdra was once, many years ago, a member of the Monastery of Unblinking Flame. This connection allowed her the opportunity to study many of the ancient monastery’s relics on behalf of the Pathfinder Society. Unfortunately, not all has been going well for the ancient House of Perfection, as a rogue monk stole a relic earmarked for study by the Society.</p> 
                <p> Venture-Captain Melipdra calls for a group of volunteers willing to head to the lawless port of Veedesha to retrieve the artifact, but the PCs may be in for more than they bargained for. Ambitious and skilled, the rogue monk Meleeka opened her own monastery to teach the more vicious and martially talented inhabitants of Veedesha the techniques of Unforgiving Fire.</p> 
                <p>A special prize awaits on this Chronicle sheet for those who manage to complete their mission while upholding the Society’s ideals. Though this quest does not have specific ties to the Envoy’s Alliance faction, PCs representing that group may find that their goals and interests are uniquely suited to unlocking everything that this quest has to offer!</p>

                <p>The organization or organizations you join can have just as an important role in your character’s life as their class or ancestry. Because of this, we wanted the Character Guide to also take a look at some of the notable organizations in the Inner Sea region. This includes obvious groups like the Pathfinder Society, but also organizations that have had less time in the spotlight over the years like the Magaambya Academy. For the Character Guide, we landed on five spots for major organizations which include the Hellknights (lawful), Knights of Lastwall (lawful good), Magaambya Academy (neutral good), and the Pathfinder Society (neutral). After we decided on these four, we realized that chaotic characters didn’t really have an obvious group to join. Some back and forth happened and eventually I pitched an idea for a brand new organization and thus, the Firebrands were born. (If you missed it, we even had a preview of their shenanigans with some <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwc?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-Bad-Dogs">fiction</a> by Chris A. Jackson a few weeks back!)</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-silverraven.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-silverraven_500.jpeg" alt="A fierce-looking gnome with tangled blue-and-purple hair holds a gnarled staff in both hands."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Michele Esposito</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Who are the Firebrands? Depends on who you ask! Some people say they are rebels and rabble rousers who travel the Inner Sea region to fight tyranny and help the oppressed. Others say that they are just grandstanders with a penchant for fashion and drawing attention to themselves. In a way, they’re both right. The Firebrands began life as rebels when the people of Vidrian reached out to the people of Ravounel in an act of solidarity shortly after the founding of both new nations. In the process, the Vidric rebels and the Silver Ravens met up and realized that they both still had that rebellious fire and wanted to join up and continue fighting oppression. Eventually word of these first Firebrands got out and, in an attempt to ask for their aid, some rebels in Galt publicly declared themselves as Firebrands. While not officially part of the original group, these Firebrands had that same fighting spirit and others believed them to be part of the organization, too.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-freecaptain.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-freecaptain_500.jpeg" alt="A female half-elf in a flowing black cloak, tricorn hat and white shirt wields a flintlock pistol in one hand and a rapier in the other."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>This leads to more and more people declaring themselves Firebrands and things getting out of hand. Eventually, some Free Captains do it to stick it to the man, which in turn becomes a trend among others. This fad of “joining” the Firebrands escalates to a whole movement of people doing so for the thrill of going around and doing daredevil acts and having fun. These Firebrands in turn draw lots of attention away from the rebellious side of the group and then we have the Firebrands of today. If you’re playing a Firebrand, you might choose to go in on the fun and gaudy lifestyle, drawing throngs of people to hear about your latest exploit. In that case, you might end up taking the Entourage skill feat.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-entourage.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-entourage_500.png" alt="Entourage, Feat 7. Rare, General, Skill. Prerequisites: master in Diplomacy, Hobnobber. You have a small group of admirers that tend to follow you around while you’re in civilized settlements. Your admirers are helpful to you, allowing you to make simple Requests of them such as purchasing basic equipment with your funds or finding a room at an inn."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>However, drawing and maintaining an entourage takes a lot of work. In fact, only the most well-known Firebrands have the popularity to draw large groups of people. If you’re not popular enough yet, maybe it’s time to go and delve another ancient ruin or wear some more eye-catching clothing! You can always head to the Vaunter’s Carnival—a yearly gathering of Firebrands full of boasting and friendly competition—in hopes of gaining enough of a reputation to build your own entourage.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-firebrandrebel.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-firebrandrebel_500.jpeg" alt="A half-orc with a cloak concealing the lower half of her face prepares to throw a grappling hook."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Maybe you’re not the kind that likes attention. Maybe you prefer to help others and would prefer to use your popularity to inspire others to do good. The Firebrands are the perfect organization for that kind of character. Vigilantes and do-gooders of all types can use the Firebrands as a mask to go around and help those in need. Maybe putting on a persona is still too much. In that case, the Firebrands are also perfect at helping you remain anonymous, as anyone can join the group. In fact, the Firebrands make use of gear to keep their deeds hidden like the <i>insistent door knocker</i>, the <i>unmemorable mantle</i>, and one of my favorite first edition items, <i>snapleaf</i>!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-snapleaf.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-snapleaf_500.png" alt="Snapleaf, Level 3. Consumable, Illusion, Magical, Talisman. This small, crystalline carving is in the shape of a tree leaf and attaches to armor or clothing with a simple strap. When you activate the snapleaf, you gain the benefits of feather fall and a 2nd-level invisibility spell for 1 minute or until you stop falling, whichever comes first."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Many of the options featured in the organizations section of the Character Guide are uncommon or rarer options. Some of these, like the <i>snapleaf</i> above, are widespread enough that you can acquire them even without a connection to the organization. For those that are less common, it’s generally a simple matter of joining up with the organization. Each section features details on how to join these groups, allowing GMs and players to work together to get characters membership as their respective stories allow. For the Firebrands, it’s actually a simple process: go somewhere that has a lot of people and publicly declare yourself a Firebrand. You did it! You’re a first mark Firebrand! Moving up in the ranks is a bit tougher than that, though. You have to gain a reputation and eventually have to have a recognized second mark Firebrand officially accept you as a Firebrand. Once this happens, you have become a second mark and gain access to most of the section’s rules options, including the new Firebrand braggart archetype!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-firbrandbraggart.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-firbrandbraggart_500.jpeg" alt="A shirtless Firebrand raises a full mug of beer in his right hand while grasping an axe in the other."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Michele Esposito</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>This archetype is all about boasting and trying to do as many death-defying deeds as possible, placing your reputation on the line in the process. Firebrand braggarts can make big boasts about something they’re about to do, such as a Long Jump over a chasm, and if they succeed, gain a bonus to other Long Jump checks for a while as they ride high on their success. If they fail, however, they take a penalty to further checks for some time as their bruised ego recovers. Later feats allow braggarts to taunt their foes to trick them into letting their guard down, do fun stunts that let them dance around the battlefield, and even defy death by their sheer determination alone. The Firebrand braggart archetype is a double-length archetype taking up two pages and the Firebrand Braggart Dedication feat is available starting at 4th level.</p>

Prerequisites: trained in Acrobatics or Athletics, Firebrand Braggart Dedication. You attempt death- maneuver to distract your enemies. Select one foe within reach and attempt either an Acrobatics or defying Athletics check against your target’s Reflex DC. If you succeed, you can Stride up to half your Speed (or up to your full Speed if you critically succeed) without triggering reactions from the target due to your movement, and the target is flat-footed against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your turn."></a>

Prerequisites: Daring Act. If you critically succeed at your Daring Act, you can enter the target’s space and remain there until the beginning of your next turn or until the target moves, whichever comes first. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, and your target is flat-footed against your attacks while you are sharing its space in this way. If any creature other than your target hits you with an attack roll while you are sharing your target’s space, attempt a DC 15 flat check. On a success, resolve the attack against the target instead of you, using the same attack roll result that hit you."></a>

                <p>That’s just a taste of what the Firebrands have to offer. If you’ve always wanted a group that encouraged adventuring for the sake of adventuring, fun, and prestige, then you should check out the Firebrands! If you think that too many tyrants are up to no good and the world needs more heroes, then you should check out the Firebrands! If you think these Firebrands are too much of a nuisance and should learn their place, then you should check out our preview of the Hellknights next week! Regardless, I think you should check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Lost Omens Character Guide</a> when it releases on October 16th. It’s going to be fun!</p>

We’ll start with Edge of Anarchy, the first <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> adventure, but there are plenty more Adventure Paths after that.

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Harrow of Keys really spices up Edge of Anarchy.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>In Curse of the Crimson Throne, each adventure is associated with a specific Harrow suit, so consider adding the Harrows wildcard that corresponds to the Harrow suit for that adventure. For Edge of Anarchy, that’s the Harrow of Keys. If you don’t want to just increase the difficulty by adding a wildcard, you could make the game a little easier by starting each scenario with a free exploration of the Base and making the Base not close if it’s out of supporters. That’s an easy way to make the supporters a lot more accessible to the whole group, which might be more fun for some groups. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_GaedrenLammGobblegut.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_GaedrenLammGobblegut_500.jpeg" alt="A grinning, sinister-looking human in ragged clothes and a wide-brimmed hat holds a chain attached to a collar around the neck of an enormous crocodile."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Fagin from <i>Oliver Twist</i> meets Captain Hook.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>The Adventure Path's introductory scenario is 1★: Haunted Fortunes. It’s adapted from (and shares its name with) the first part of the first chapter of the RPG Adventure Path. I think it’s my favorite introduction to an RPG Adventure Path: Each character is invited to think of some reason to hate a despicable criminal, Gaedren Lamm, then gets to rescue a bunch of orphans on the way to bringing justice to him. Drawn together by this mutual hatred and a mysterious fortune-telling, you instantly create a party and dive right into play. When I ran it for my wife, her character had two reasons to hate Lamm: he’d kidnapped her and her twin sister, and he’d fed my wife’s character to his alligator. (Don’t worry: she got better. Sort of. She also eventually found her sister. Sort of.)</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_ThePerils.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_ThePerils_360.jpeg" alt="The Perils, Wildcard 0; Ablaze, Confusing, Deadly, Hostile, Unhallowed, Wearisome"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_TheOnslaughts.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_TheOnslaughts_360.jpeg" alt="The Onslaughts, Wildcard 0; Besieged, Desperate, Hazardous, Impoverished, Monstrous, Withering"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">For extra fun <del>and profit</del>!</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>For this scenario I’d additionally consider any of the Perils wildcard Wearisome, the Onslaughts wildcard Impoverished, or the Perils wildcard Hostile (in roughly increasing order of difficulty). Wearisome isn’t too painful at this level, but it does keep people’s turns from getting too long. Impoverished lets you start with a better hand, at the cost of losing some cards and being closer to death; not ideal, but also not too bad in your first scenario. Hostile makes a lot more checks a lot more dangerous, so is a good pick for those seeking a real challenge. Villain scenarios can also often use an extra location to increase difficulty for experienced groups, so I’d add the next location on the list; if you’re a group of 6, I’d add Abandoned Shacks. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_VerikVancaskerkin.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_VerikVancaskerkin_500.jpeg" alt="Verik Vancaskerkin, a male human guardsman with a halberd in one hand and a longbow slung across his back."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>The next scenario is 1A: A City Gone Mad. The villain here, Verik Vancaskerkin, doesn’t actually know about the dastardly deeds of the thugs working for him, so if you manage to find the Evidence or talk him into surrendering, you get a bonus ally and blessing for your trouble. Which is great. Apparently it’s news to Verik that people calling themselves “The Cow Hammer Boys” and operating out of a shop called “All The World’s Meat” at the address “22 Stirge Street” were up to no good, where “no good” is selling people meat. No, not selling people meat—selling people meat. Cannibalism. (I’m not sure how that term works if you’re an elf eating a dwarf, though.) When I ran the RPG and the PCs reported what they found to Verik, I assumed the proper reaction to “Sir, the men have been moonlighting as assassins who turn people into ribeyes. Also, how was dinner last night?” would be shocked bewilderment followed by vomiting.</p> 
                <p>I’d recommend the Perils wildcard Deadly here. I also like adding a location (Alley for 6 characters). After that, I’d use any of Wearisome, Impoverished, or Hostile, especially if you didn’t use them in Haunted Fortunes. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_ChittersnapFight.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_ChittersnapFight_500.jpeg" alt="Ezren, the iconic wizard, uses his staff to ward off an attack from a monstrous yellow-and-black-striped spider while Harsk, the iconic ranger, takes aim with his crossbow in the background."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">We grow big spiders in these parts.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nrupch3h#v5748eaidgsn5">Before playing 1B: The Ambassador’s Secret, please observe its FAQ.</a> </p> 
                <p>The next scenario is an example of the ‘Solve the Mystery’ style scenario, where you get free examinations that let you move cards around between locations while you try to deal with Trigger barriers. I made the first test scenario of this type for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9g8v">Season of the Righteous 3</a>, based on a concept I’d intended for this very path. I got to experiment with the format a bunch more in other seasons, especially Season of the Plundered Tombs. This scenario also led to my favorite testing anecdote ever: After the monster Giant Fly was shuffled randomly into the location Spider Nest, the tester commented “Either a bad idea for the fly, or it's off to get revenge for its kind,” to which another tester asked “Well, how big are the spiders?” I supplied the above picture, and got a prompt response of “Bad idea then.”</p> 
                <p>The Perils wildcard Ablaze, dealing Poison damage instead of Fire, is a very thematic (albeit painful) option for this scenario. To increase the difficulty, consider shortening the first scenario power to just “At the end of your turn, you may examine the top card of your location,” or changing the final phrase to “then put that card on top of a random location.” Requiring an additional Evidence (by removing the “or equal to” from the second scenario power) is also a solid option.</p> 
                <p>Scenario 1C: The Dead Warrens can easily be the toughest scenario in the adventure. This is true for thematic reasons and also because it was originally the final scenario of the adventure. For story and pacing reasons, we wanted to keep the chase after Trinia and the execution together. </p> 
                <p>The Perils wildcard Confusing is a perfectly thematic choice for this Derro-filled scenario. I also like the Onslaughts wildcard Monstrous, but I’d require that all of the monsters have the Undead trait (you’ll need to find them before building locations). If you’re playing on Legendary and haven’t increased # to 2, this scenario could really use it since level 2 has a bunch of Undead.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_Chases.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_Chases.jpg" alt="Flow chart for resolving a city chase"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Chase rules can get a little wacky in both the RPG and ACG.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Scenario 1D: Kingkiller is one of several ways we’ve run “chase” scenarios. In the RPG, you often make choices about which way to go, such as “leaping between rooftops” or “balancing on the plank that leads across” that let you use different skills and mix up the difficulty of options. The location Rooftop’s power to choose between two barriers whenever you encounter a barrier is entirely inspired by this mechanic. This scenario can be pretty quick and easy, which might feel nice for anyone who had a tough time with the previous scenario. </p> 
                <p>On the other hand, if you’re looking for more of a nail-biter, I’d encourage at least one of two modifications to this scenario to increase difficulty: First, remove the scenario’s automatic closing from defeating the Fugitive. This means that you’ll have to defeat a barrier to close each Rooftop location, and if you fail, closing will require either emptying it or shuffling the Fugitive back into it. It really changes up the feel of the chase. Second, when the Fugitive is defeated and is shuffled into another location, I’d instead shuffle the Fugitive and a new barrier into a stack, then shuffle each into a random location (different locations if possible).</p> 
                <p>That’s more than enough for this blog. I can probably do Adventure 2 more succinctly, right?</p>

On the makeshift workbench, the bot twitched and shook, servos seizing as batteries failed and crucial fluids leaked from the wreckage of the robot’s lower body.

                <p>“Ah, scrap!” He dropped the cutter and stretched a hand out toward the drone hovering just over his shoulder. “Scout—soldering iron! Now!” </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091219_Quig.jpg"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091219_Quig.jpg" alt="Quig, the iconic ysoki mechanic, holds a plasma cutter over the remains of a shattered humanoid robot."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>The robot on the slab jerked again, and Quig leaned forward, pressing it down with his body so it couldn’t damage itself further. “Come on, buddy,” he whispered. “Stay with me...”</p> 
                <p>Obozaya glanced over, scaled snout wrinkling in confusion over the barrel of her rifle. “What’s the big deal? It’s just a robot.”</p> 
                <p>Iseph’s head whipped around from where they crouched next to an engineering screen in the station wall. “Excuse me?” The android’s words were dangerously flat. “Did you just—”</p> 
                <p>Navasi stepped smoothly between them. “I’m sure Obozaya didn’t mean it like that, Iseph. Obo, the authorization codes in this robot are the only way to access the station’s data core and locate the black ops facility. Without those coordinates, this mission is dead. Along with about a million Akitonians.” She turned toward the operating table. “How we doing, Quig?”</p> 
                <p>“I’m trying!” Quig drew a line of solder, crudely rerouting power around a glitching processor. The robot’s left eye telescoped outward with a whir, thrashing wildly.</p> 
                <p>“Try harder. Obo, what’s on the scopes? How far out is our pursuit?”</p> 
                <p>Obozaya consulted her datapad, scanning quickly. “Two ships, running dark—no transponders, but they’re probably Norikama dropships. One minute from rendezvous. Looks like they’re planning to skip the airlocks and come straight through the hull.”</p> 
                <p>“And after we rigged up those mines, too! Damn. That’s a waste of good ordnance.” Navasi looked out the viewport, toward the twin shadows of the approaching ships. “Two of those assault teams is two too many. We’ve got to pull back to the ship and cast off before—”</p> 
                <p>The robot on the packing crate jerked upright, glowing eyes staring blankly.</p> 
                <p>“Security codes verified.” Its voice fuzzed and crackled. “Facility access approved. Location 28.735, 98.302.” Then it slumped back onto the operating table, sparks and twitches ceasing.</p> 
                <p>“No!” Quig grabbed the robot’s head, jerking it up to stare into its dull, extinguished eyes. “No, no, no!” He poked frantically at the exposed circuitry of the robot’s metal skull. </p> 
                <p>“That was it! The coordinates!” Navasi’s face broke into a victorious grin—then fell just as quickly. She glanced around the room. “Uh... did anyone get that?”</p> 
                <p>“Um.” Obozaya looked back and forth between Navasi and the robot. “It started with a 2...?”</p> 
                <p>Navasi put her head in her hands. “Oh for the love of—”</p> 
                <p>“28.735, 98.302.” Iseph didn’t even look up from their wall panel as they flicked away warnings and error codes.</p> 
                <p>Obozaya gaped at the android. “You memorized it? Just like that?”</p> 
                <p>“My brain is one of the most advanced neural networks in the Pact Worlds.” Now Iseph turned to meet her gaze. “While yours is a glob of pudding evolved to run from predators that went extinct millennia ago.” The android returned their attention to the screen. “Not to mention currently fifty percent drugs by volume.”</p> 
                <p>“Hey!” Obozaya’s hand went instinctively to the armor pouch where she carried her nose-hookah. “Dragon’s breath is an honored Veskarium tradition. I only—”</p> 
                <p>“Save it!” Navasi drew her pistols. “You can light up once we’re safely in the Drift. We need to get back to the ship before—” </p> 
                <p>A hollow boom echoed through the station, shaking the decking beneath their feet. Navasi winced. </p> 
                <p>“That’s it, then. Iseph, you got the reactor overrides rigged?”</p> 
                <p>“Aye, Captain.” Iseph straightened, swiping a hand over the panel and turning the screen dark. “Failsafes are linked to my coms. One touch, containment goes down and this station becomes a short-lived star.”</p> 
                <p>“Perfect. Let’s move.” Navasi started toward the door, then stopped short. “Quig?”</p> 
                <p>The ysoki scrambled to strap the limp robot to the back of his pack, stuffing severed metal appendages into pockets. “Help me get Buddy!”</p> 
                <p>“The robot doesn’t matter anymore, Quig! We already got the coordinates.”</p> 
                <p>Quig looked at her like she’d just suggested he light his tail on fire, eyes wide behind his mask. “We can't just leave him here!” He looked down at the ruined robot. “Not after he helped us!”</p> 
                <p>Navasi rolled her eyes. Behind her, Iseph gazed at Quig with a thoughtful expression.</p> 
                <p>“Fine,” Navasi snapped. “But you’re carrying it. Obo, cover the rat. Iseph, you take point. Let’s go, people!”</p> 
                <p>They ran back through the derelict station’s halls. Emergency lighting flickering, illuminating walls scarred and streaked with the remnants of their battles. Quig huffed under the new weight of his pack, looking up enviously as Scout buzzed through the air in front of him, wondering if maybe he should have designed a drone capable of hauling more gear. </p> 
                <p>They rounded a corner, the docking bay coming into view. Quig had just a moment to register the swarm of red dots dancing across the wall ahead of them, and then all hell broke loose.</p> 
                <p>“Contact!” Iseph dove forward as a hail of bullets and the bright lines of energy weapons sliced through the air between them and Navasi. Quig turned and found an assault team in matte black body armor leapfrogging forward down a side corridor, their advance smooth and practiced, helmets a faceless, insectile cluster of lenses. </p> 
                <p>Obozaya swung around the edge of the hallway, autotarget rifle barking, forcing the intruders to take cover.</p> 
                <p>“Run!” Navasi sprinted toward the ship, Quig and Iseph hot on her heels. Behind them, Obozaya’s rifle went silent, spent magazine clinking against the decking. Then she was bringing up the rear, booted feet pounding.</p> 
                <p>Something roared. An unseen wave slammed Quig forward, sending him tumbling tail over whiskers. He scrambled out from beneath the crushing weight of a mountain of fallen metal, only to realize it was Obozaya, her heavy armor having protected them both from the grenade blast. They lurched to their feet, Quig snatching up his fallen pack.</p> 
                <p>It was too light. He looked back toward the blast’s point of origin. </p> 
                <p>The robot lay in the middle of the hallway, surrounded by steam from burst pipes and the sinister hiss of venting atmosphere.</p> 
                <p>“Buddy!” Quig started toward the fallen bot, but Obozaya grabbed the top of his pack and lifted him off his feet, carrying him backward toward the ship.</p> 
                <p>Behind them, red targeting lasers sliced through the steam.</p> 
                <p>They slid through the airlock, barely missing Iseph where the android knelt in the entrance, calmly laying down covering fire with their sniper rifle. The second they were aboard, the door whirred closed, and Quig was almost knocked off his feet a second time as Navasi goosed the thrusters.</p> 
                <p>Then they were free, ship gliding silently away. Quig staggered to the nearest viewport, looking out at the abandoned station as it shrank rapidly with distance. </p> 
                <p>“Iseph,” Navasi said. “Light ’em up.”</p> 
                <p>Iseph nodded and tapped their datapad.</p> 
                <p>The station erupted. The silent fireball expanded too quickly for Quig’s eyes to follow, engulfing the station and the enemy ships. The viewport dimmed automatically, shields maximizing to block the blaze of radiation. Yet almost as quickly, the glow faded, ionized gasses dispersing into vacuum.</p> 
                <p>It was like Iseph had said: A temporary sun, shining bright for one brief moment. And then darkness.</p> 
                <p>Quig put a hand to the viewport.</p> 
                <p>“Goodbye, Buddy,” he whispered. “And thanks.”</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Paizo and Geek &amp; Sundry will produce a second season of the successful <i>Knights of Everflame</i> for Pathfinder Second Edition later this year! Once again, Game Master Jason Bulmahn will lead an amazing cast of adventurers into the heart of darkness on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry">Geek &amp; Sundry on Twitch</a> (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry">twitch.tv/geekandsundry</a>).

                <p>The show began with five strangers boarding a caravan heading to Lastwall, an ancient kingdom watching over the grave of a long-dead menace. Signed up as conscripts in the army, they faced years of training and service. But when smoke began to rise from the horizon, they had to come together as friends to have any chance at survival!</p> 
                <p>“I could not be more excited to bring another season of <i>Knights of Everflame</i> to all of you! With the epic conclusion of Season 1, there were a number of stories left unresolved. The trail of one foe stands before them, but it is a journey that leads into the deepest darkness, and none of them will emerge unscathed,” said Jason Bulmahn.</p> 
                <p>“While filming Season 1 of <i>Knights of Everflame</i>, I knew magic was happening almost immediately. Something special was occurring at the table, and I was just fortunate enough to be the guy tasked with capturing it. Jason Bulmahn is one of the greatest storytellers I’ve ever had the fortune of working with. The cast at the table are some of the most brilliant live performers I’ve ever known, and I am overjoyed to call all of them my friends. I am so excited to embark on the journey that is Season 2 with every single one of them,” said director and producer Chris Fishel.</p>

                <p>The #KnightsOfEverflame are:</p> 
                <p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b> (@JasonBulmahn) got his start in gaming administering the Living Greyhawk campaign, but soon after was hired as the Managing Editor of Dragon magazine. After the end of the magazine’s print run, Jason became the Lead Designer of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Now, as Paizo’s Director of Game Design, he leads the team behind Pathfinder Second Edition. He is also an experienced Game Master, writing and running the Oblivion Oath, a Pathfinder Actual Play stream on Twitch, and the Knights of Everflame, a new series for Geek and Sundry.</p> 
                <p><b>Gina DeVivo</b> (@PocketGina) is your friendly neighborhood RPG craft wizard. Having been in the entertainment industry since she was 11 years old means she's got some groovy stories from the sets of Madmen, Scrubs, and Hannah Montana to name a few. Lately, she's been three character sheets stacked in a trench coat on Geek &amp; Sundry's Callisto 6, Shield Of Tomorrow, and TBD RPG. If podcasts are your jam you can find her providing the voices of Windsgar the goblin on Plunders and Blunders and lover of magic, Olive, on Champions of the Earth. Also, minty things make her sneeze.</p> 
                <p><b>Jeremy Steven Walker</b> (@JwalkerScene) is an American actor originally from Memphis, Tennessee. His first television appearance came by way of a national commercial for Crocs that aired during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Since then, Jeremy’s resume has grown considerably, as he has starred in over thirty film and television productions, several award-nominated stage plays, and dozens of worldwide and national commercial campaigns. Quoted by film producer, Mark G. Mathis (Precious, Brick, The Identical) as "an extraordinary talent with recognizable star quality," Jeremy's dynamic on-camera presence and effortless charm have helped solidify his place as one of the film industry's top actors to watch.</p> 
                <p><b>Aki</b> (@MxGiniInABottle) is a recent transplant to Los Angeles and is a relative newcomer to the world of online RPG-E, though they have been rolling dice and playing tabletop games since university. Their most recent on-screen work includes New Pantheon, a Scion game on Saving Throw Show, and a guest spot on Geek &amp; Sundry’s Callisto 6!</p> 
                <p><b>Erika Fermina</b> (@astylepixie) is an actress, stylist, and fantasy enthusiast. You can sometimes spot her on a commercial but usually, she’s playing games with Girls Guts Glory! </p> 
                <p><b>Rachel Seeley</b> (@Sunnyseeley) is a fan of all Tabletop RPGs and an actress is always ecstatic to combine the two. She has appeared on G&amp;S before playing on Tales from the Loop, Weave, the Critical Role anniversary prequel and GMing on Weave!</p> 
                <p><b>Chris Fishel</b> (@AKAthefish) grew up on the sets of sitcom television from the time he was seven years old where he discovered his true passion for storytelling and fell in love with making feature films. 25 feature films later Mr. Fishel brought his talent for narrative storytelling into the RPG-E space in September 2017 when he joined the team at Geek and Sundry. After producing shows like Starter Kit, Painters Guild and Game Masters Hall, Mr. Fishel is proud to be the Director and producer of the new The Knights of Everflame series. </p>

                <p>The horns were blowing in her dreams again.</p> 
                <p itemprop="description">In her dreams, they all sounded together: the alarm and the battle march and the frenzied call to retreat. The calls overlapped into chaos, yet Veldrienne heard them all distinctly, and she understood with the perfect, crazed, crystal logic of dreams that of course the battle march was wild with panic, and of course the first call to alarm was a dolorous cry played over the bloody field of a lost battle, and of <i>course</i> it all began and ended with a weak, wounded note that broke on the thrust of a dead man’s spear.</p> 
                <p>Because this was Lastwall, where the knights of her order had trained for nearly a thousand years to meet the Whispering Tyrant’s threat, and where the Tyrant had destroyed them effortlessly. Every battle worthy of the name had been lost before the Watcher-Lord’s armies had mustered. They’d been defeated before they’d begun.</p> 
                <p>That hurt the worst of all. All their pride, all their valor, and they’d never had a chance.</p> 
                <p>And so Veldrienne dreamed, again and again, of a call to arms that was a call to mourning, and of battlefields she would never see.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>She kicked off the blanket covering her legs. Watery gray sunlight, the only light that shone on the Gravelands anymore, filtered through the burned rafters of the farmhouse they’d sheltered in overnight.</p> 
                <p>Yeran held up a battered kettle. He’d been up for a while, long enough to have warmed water and made an attempt at shaving. “Porridge?”</p> 
                <p>“Thank you.” Veldrienne spooned the stale mush out of the kettle. They didn’t have any bowls left. “Save any of that wash water for me?”</p> 
                <p>Yeran nodded. He’d missed a few patches, shaving with just that dented kettle for a mirror. The stubble was white in the weak light. It made him look old, and almost as worn down as Veldrienne felt. “Plenty to go around, now that there are only two of us left.”</p> 
                <p>Two. Out of a full company. Veldrienne shook her head. They were the last two left, and yet they still pretended to uphold the niceties of their order. Yeran still tried to keep clean-shaven. Veldrienne still polished the pins of rank on the filthy rags of her uniform.</p> 
                <p>She wasn’t sure why they bothered. Habits died harder than people, evidently.</p> 
                <p>Veldrienne paused, the spoon halfway to her mouth. There was smoke on the wind. Wood smoke. The Tyrant’s rotting minions had no need to cook, and certainly never washed. They didn’t light campfires.</p> 
                <p>“People.”</p> 
                <p>Yeran was already buckling on his sword. He’d smelled it too. “East?”</p> 
                <p>“East.”</p> 
                <p>Together they walked through the weed-choked fields and abandoned hovels to the last intact farmhouse in town. It was where Veldrienne would have sheltered, if she’d had to shelter here. If she hadn’t known that ghouls, and worse, hunted these grounds.</p> 
                <p>She knocked at the door. “Veldrienne of Vigil and Yeran Dhoskan, Knights of Lastwall.” It almost didn’t hurt to say that last part anymore. “Is anyone living here? Can we aid you?”</p> 
                <p>Scurrying inside. Hushed voices, fear and hope warring between them. Then a woman’s voice: “Can you… can you get us somewhere safe?”</p> 
                <p>Veldrienne closed her eyes so she wouldn’t have to see Yeran’s look. “Yes. If you trust us.”</p> 
                <p>They came out. A man, a woman, six young children. Plainly the children were not all theirs by blood. Just as plainly, they were by necessity. Veldrienne’s determination hardened, looking at the family that the Tyrant’s menace had driven together. If these people had managed to protect their children this far, she wouldn’t see them fail now.</p> 
                <p>“We can get you to the camp at Kassen,” she told them, “and from there you can take a boat to Vellumis. The Tyrant’s creatures don’t hold the water as fiercely as they do the land.”</p> 
                <p>“Thank you,” the woman said. </p> 
                <p>The man hesitated, then drew out a pendant he’d hidden inside the seam of his coat sleeve. He offered it to Veldrienne, who shook her head. “I can’t take your money.”</p> 
                <p>“It isn’t money. It’s… I was a jeweler. Before all this.” He laughed bleakly. “I thought I’d use some of my pieces to bribe our way out of the Gravelands, but there’s no bribing the dead. I want you to have it, instead. I can’t buy safety. None of us can. But I can, at least, offer this. Please. Take it and tell me that—that you understand.”</p> 
                <p>Veldrienne took the pendant. It was an octagon of rose gold, holding a pressed flower under glass in a ring of white seed pearls. The flower was familiar. Star alyssum. It had bloomed around the Watcher-Lord’s palace and spilled from the window boxes of Vigil’s tidy whitewashed homes, perfuming the city in summer. If she closed her eyes, she could almost breathe its delicate, honeyed sweetness again.</p> 
                <p>“I made them for crusaders traveling up to the Worldwound,” the man explained. “For them to remember the homes and loved ones they left behind. I never thought that crusade would be won, or that I’d need to preserve the memory of Vigil on its own ground instead. But — look. The back.”</p> 
                <p>Veldrienne turned the pendant around. In the back, under a panel of rose gold inscribed “Vigil’s blessing,” was a compartment full of tiny black seeds.</p> 
                <p>Mendev and the Sarkoris Scar were dotted with battlefield graves where star alyssum bloomed. Veldrienne knew those marked the final rest of knights from Lastwall, but she had never considered who carried the seeds there, or what it meant for a knight to lie beneath a bier of flowers on ground so grimly sanctified.</p> 
                <p>Now, holding the pendant, she understood. “Thank you.”</p> 
                <p>The man started to say something else, but Veldrienne held up a hand. “Quiet.” She’d smelled something on the wind. Not the remembered fragrance of alyssum.</p> 
                <p>Ghouls. The stench was unmistakable. The Tyrant’s minions didn’t breathe, and thus had no sense of smell — that was why Veldrienne had scented the family’s woodsmoke first, and why the ghouls’ foulness didn’t incapacitate their fellow undead — but they could see well enough, and the weak sun in the Gravelands didn’t cow them. They must have seen the smoke rising from the chimney once the family was too distracted to fan it away.</p> 
                <p>“Get inside,” Veldrienne ordered, drawing her sword. She could see the ghouls coming now, loping feral and hideous through the crumbling town. Yeran fell in beside her, and she was glad to have him at her side. There was no better feeling than standing beside a fellow knight, true and trustworthy, against a clear-cut foe.</p> 
                <p>She’d been wrong earlier. There <i>were</i> still battles worth fighting in the Gravelands. The knights of Lastwall hadn’t been utterly defeated. They hadn’t lost everything yet.</p> 
                <p>Not yet.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>“This short adventure is designed to allow you, the Game Master, to present the game to newcomers, showcasing the new rules in a quick and fun manner. This adventure can be run for four players within an hour, which gives you enough time to explain the basic rules of the game to your players before throwing them into the jaws of grand adventure. You can also run this adventure with up to six players, though the game might take a little longer to complete.”</p>

Now, they are expanding to provide a podcast of the Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path, exclusively to subscribers via Patreon.</p> 
                <p>"Tyrant's Grasp is an important story connecting Pathfinder editions. It is a grand finale for the first edition and sets the stage for the events to unfold in the Age of Lost Omens. We are excited to have Find the Path bring it to life and make it accessible to players both new and old," said Jim Butler, VP of Marketing and Licensing.</p> 
                <p>Comprised of a group of longtime friends, Find the Path produces content that invites gamers and non-gamers alike into the world of Golarion during the Age of Lost Omens and the Pathfinder RPG. Known for their strong grasp of the rules and cooperative table dynamics, Find the Path tells engaging and exciting stories full of diverse, multifaceted characters and epic fantasy adventure. Their deep understanding and respect for real-world history and culture truly bring Golarion to life for listeners, and their ability to seamlessly weave explanations of the rules into the story is an excellent way for those who want to play Pathfinder. Along with high-quality audio and a respectful attitude toward each other and listeners, Find the Path is building a vibrant, positive community.</p>

                <p>"We've been playing Pathfinder Adventure Paths together for going on seven years, so it's unbelievable to get to partner with Paizo. One of the important things that Find the Path brings to the Pathfinder community is the idea that you don't have to be a professional actor or comedian to have fun playing this game and that there's a place at the table for everyone," said Jessica Peters, Partner at Find the Path Ventures, LLC</p> 
                <h2>Mummy's Mask Adventure Path</h2> 
                <p>The adventure begins in the Osirion city of Wati, where a lottery is being held for intrepid explorers who want to investigate the Necropolis. A criminal-turned-monk, a black marketeer, a priest of Horus, and a painter join together as the Doorkeepers of the Duat to see what secrets the Half Dead City holds for them. Can the Doorkeepers uncover the mysteries of the Necropolis and save not just Wati, but all of Osirion? Listen to find out.</p> 
                <p>Mummy's Mask play episodes release weekly on Tuesday morning. Mummy's Mask After Party episodes release on the Saturday morning following every third play episode. </p> 
                <h2>Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path</h2> 
                <p>In this Patreon-exclusive podcast, the Find the Path crew plays through Paizo's Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path. Five normal, everyday people find themselves pulled into an adventure where the fate of Ustalav, and perhaps the world, is at stake. The adventure begins in the small town of Roslar's Coffer where a woodworker, a barmaid, a rancher, and a cemetery caretaker are preparing for the yearly Remembrance Moon festival celebrating those who gave their lives defending Lastwall. Just as the festival begins, our four heroes see a flash of light and awaken entombed in a crypt. Now they must figure out a way to get home before all is lost!</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fhm6cK-IobE" style="margin:2rem auto;display:block;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen enablejsapi="1" id="widget2"></iframe>

                <p style="font-size: 13px;">“Battling the Swarm” illustrated by Nathan James</p> 
               </div> 
               <p>Now, the Swarm continues to make advances across our world, and we are fighting to hold on to every inch. The Suskillon Defense Force needs every sentient from the bustling metropolis of Brinnoa to the farms of the Sahtor Region to chip in and do their part, especially if they are able and willing to pick up a weapon and fight! Enlist at your nearest SDF recruitment center today to help replenish the depleted ranks of the 5th Battalion or else the Swarm will surely overrun our home planet.</p> 
               <p>When you join up, you’ll receive a brief but rigorous training course, ensuring that you are familiar with your issued weapon and armor and can work within a squad. You will also receive your IDENT, a miniaturized computer embedded in an SDF insignia that holds your vital records and health information, useful for identifying you should the worst happen. Finally, you will be given access to the wide array of items available in the SDF armory, including pressure-sensitive gel pads for your feet that help to ease the pain of long marches. Other innovations are more recent and are directly related to our fight against the Swarm. The so-called pulse ray, when used properly, can temporarily scramble the minds of those creatures with telepathy, such as used in the Swarm hive mind!</p>

               <p>You’ll need every advantage you can get when you find yourself face-to-ugly-mandibled-face with the dozens of types of Swarm creatures that have invaded our world. While Swarm dredgers are small, they can burrow and are known to tunnel under our fortifications to attack unsuspecting soldiers. Swarm vorphomas can fling envenomed barbs from their skinny arms and can mentally sow fear and confusion within our ranks. Swarm convecytes can actually carrying other Swarm creatures under their protective plates, making them effective living transports, and to make matter worse, explode in a burst of acid when killed. Many more Swarm creatures have been encountered in the fields of battle, and scientists speculate there are even more out there, waiting to descend and devour.</p>

                <p>In the case of the Pathfinder developers and designers, this also gives us an opportunity to expand upon lizardfolk in ways we haven’t had the opportunity to do so until now. There have been hints of a more robust lizardfolk culture scattered across multiple Paizo products, but oftentimes, those hints never coalesced into anything tangible for the PCs to encounter during adventures. Most meetings with the iruxi follow the exact same template—an isolated tribe of lizardfolk living in simple, ramshackle huts in the middle of a jungle or swamp.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>When outlining the iruxi entry for the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i>, I asked for something that was truly primordial. Much like crocodiles or sharks, lizardfolk have been present on Golarion for spans of time that are unfathomable to the human mindset. Iruxi are old enough that some of their treasured ancestors are actually fossils. They had nations that were ancient before the elves even set foot on the planet, and they survived through the destruction of Earthfall not by fleeing or by magic, but by simple virtue of their nature as highly adapted predators. They may not have changed in millions—or even billions—of years, but that’s because they’re so well-evolved for their lifestyle that they haven’t needed to.</p> 
                <p>(Though if we follow the crocodile and shark metaphors too far, that might imply the existence of titanic lizardfolk that existed in prehistoric times. Eek!)</p> 
                <p>With the inexorable advance of faster-lived mammalian peoples across the globe, however, the iruxi are finding they cannot keep solely to themselves and their old ways anymore. Lizardfolk have so far preferred to be patient and think things through thoroughly before acting, but the tide is starting to turn, and more iruxi are turning their gaze to collaboration with other civilizations. Like hobgoblins and leshies, lizardfolk are an Uncommon ancestry. They are most welcome in lands such as the Mwangi Expanse, where the iruxi nation of Droon in southern Garund is a well-known fact, or in lawless wilds such as the River Kingdoms or the deserts of the Golden Road. While an iruxi might find acceptance elsewhere, many people react to lizardfolk in the same way that they might respond to finding a large alligator lying on their sofa and wearing their slippers. That is to say, for all you reptile fans out there who are about to claim to be delighted by such a thing, not well. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/090619_DiverLizardfolk.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/090619_DiverLizardfolk_360.jpeg" alt="A crouching green lizardfolk with a huge, muscular tail uses a crude knife to open a clam."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Lizardfolk get 8 Hit Points from their ancestry, are Medium, and have a speed of 25 feet. A lizardfolk speaks Common and Iruxi, plus any additional languages they might pick up. As apex predators, they get an ability boost to Strength, and their incredible patience in the face of pressure and adversary gets them another ability boost in Wisdom. They also get one free ability boost to put in any score. Much like snakes, sharks, and crocodiles, lizardfolk don’t tend to focus much on knowledge outside of the practical, so they get an ability flaw to Intelligence. Neither lizardfolk nor their unfortunate prey consider this much of a weakness, however—lizardfolk are hard to fool, possess razor sharp claws that grant them an unarmed strike, and have the ability to hold their breath for a long time while they quietly lie in wait.</p> 
                <p>Many iruxi ancestry feats focus on enhancing their physical prowess, as they learn to adapt their formidable natural abilities to an adventuring lifestyle. Iruxi can gain a powerful tail whip attack, use their affinity for natural terrain to catch foes off balance, and further hone their skills with unarmed combat. They also have a few reptilian tricks up their sleeves, such as the ability granted by the following ancestry feat:</p> 
                <div style="border:2px solid #5d0104; margin: 1em 0">

                </div> 
                <p>Along with suggestions for some common <i>Core Rulebook</i> backgrounds appropriate for lizardfolk, the iruxi ancestry entry also notes lizardfolk culture’s love of astrology. As one of the first societies to master telling time by the stars, astrological divination followed soon after, and has become both a point of pride and a way of life to most iruxi. This love of astronomy has found lizardfolk a few friends in the form of displaced Lirgeni astrologers, and GMs might even consider allowing iruxi PCs to take Lirgeni human astrology feats present in earlier sections of the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i>!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Obozaya peeked over the rocky ridge. There was still just one of the creatures guarding the entrance, less than fifty feet away. The tunnel mouth behind it was nothing special—just a dark hole in the side of the hill. Yet this was where the footage had shown the creatures taking her crew. </p> 
                <p>Obo ducked back down and considered her rifle. With it, she could easily take the guard out right now, before it even knew she was here. That was assuredly what Navasi would advise.</p> 
                <p>But where was the fun in that?</p> 
                <p>Slinging the rifle over her shoulder, she drew her doshko and thumbed it on. Plasma spikes blazed to life with a soft hiss.</p> 
                <p>Yes—much better. Last, but most importantly, she pulled out her datapad, synched it to her personal coms channel, and cued up <i>Obozaya’s Mayhem Playlist</i>.</p> 
                <p>Immediately, Sylix the Siren’s “Moneythumper” began pounding through Obo’s custom sound system, bone conduction carrying it not just to her ears, but into her very skeleton.</p> 
                <blockquote> <i>Breaking hearts.<br> Breaking heads.<br> I always get my money down in advance...</i> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p>Gods, what a perfect fight song. A former merc herself, Sylix knew just what Obo needed—her voice was a classic Veskarium egg-croon, floating over syrupy bass and a tuned kick that hit like an orbital bombardment. Obo’s pulse surged.</p> 
                <p>Navasi hated when she did this. And maybe blasting tunes on the battlefield <i>wasn’t</i> the best idea when you were trying to coordinate with half a dozen squadmates. But for the moment, Obo was on her own, which meant she could indulge in a few old habits. If the captain didn’t like it, tough scales—the thing about rescue missions was that the rescuer got to call the shots. And Obo was in the mood to enjoy this.</p> 
                <blockquote> <i>Win while you can,<br> Then we’ll dance till we’re dead.<br> You’re only living if you’re taking a chance...</i> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p><i>You said it, Sylix</i>, Obo thought, and charged up over the ridge.</p> 
                <p>The creature—Raia had called it a “mi-go”—was fast, but Obo was faster. Her boots churned the rocky soil in time with the pounding beat, her tail stretched out behind her for balance. By the time the mi-go noticed seven feet of armored lizard bearing down on it and brought its weird spiky gun to bear, Obo was already too close. She ducked sideways out of the line of fire and brought the doshko up in a sweeping diagonal slice.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/090519_Obozaya.jpg"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/090519_Obozaya.jpg" alt="Obozaya, the iconic vesk soldier, blasts an attacking mi-go at close range with a massive assault rifle."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>The plasma spikes slid home with a sizzle, not stopping till the haft was flat against the creature’s side. Yet instead of dying, the mi-go just stood there, the doshko’s white-hot spikes sending up steam that smelled incongruously like roasted vegetable skewers. Whorls of color played across the mi-go’s face as it glanced down at the weapon, then back up at Obozaya. </p> 
                <p>“Um.” Obo said.</p> 
                <p>The creature fired, the bolt of cold slamming into Obo’s shoulder and sending crackling tendrils of frost across her pauldron. Her armor’s thermal regulators kicked in, ceramic superconductors safely dispersing the cold across her entire surface area before it could freeze the water in her cells. But it was still closer than it ought to be. Obo spun aside, lashing out with an ineffective tail sweep.</p> 
                <p>Obo’s doshko strike had been flawless—naturally—so it must be that the creature was immune to heat and electricity. So much for having some fun with things. Obo clicked the doshko off and dropped it, diving into a roll as the mi-go fired again. She came up holding her rifle.</p> 
                <p>She fired. Two quick shots, snare-crack counterpoints to the bass still pounding in her bones. No point wasting ammo if these failed as well.</p> 
                <p>The mi-go’s head snapped backward as magnetically accelerated tungsten lanced through armor plating. It screamed in a language that was at once totally alien and completely universal.</p> 
                <p>Obo smiled and switched to full auto.</p> 
                <p>It was over in less than two seconds. The gun hummed against her shoulder as she unloaded the magazine, stitching shots across the creature’s chest. A lifetime of training had her slamming home a fresh magazine before the spent one had hit the ground, yet even as she reloaded she could see that she wouldn’t need it.</p> 
                <p>The mi-go lay sprawled in the dust, practically sawn in half by the magnetar’s metal roar. Obo crouched over it, rifle leveled at the cave entrance, ready to do the same to any emerging monstrosities. When they didn’t immediately appear, she stood and recovered her doshko, never letting the magnetar’s barrel stray from its bead on the darkness.</p> 
                <p>With a last exhortation to get paid, “Moneythumper” drew to a close, replaced by the Aballonian skitterbeats of Godhead Collective’s “You Know Who We Are.”</p> 
                <p>“Right,” Obo said, and cued her holoprojector. The glowing banner coalesced above her head, rising up from her backpack and unfurling to reveal her personal war-glyph.</p> 
                <p>Navasi hated that, too. But what was the point of victory if you didn’t get to take credit for it? Anonymity was for cowards—better to let everyone know who you were, and if that meant more enemies came for you, all the better. Obo was always down to dance.</p> 
                <p>But of course, that wasn’t usually her call. Once upon a time, Obo would have laughed at the idea of taking orders from someone like Navasi. The captain had style, sure, and she could fight like a proper merc when she had to, but her answer to everything was <i>talking</i>. The whole team was like that. They didn’t understand the glory of single combat, of making a name for yourself by succeeding against impossible odds on the battlefield. Half the time they schemed to <i>avoid</i> bloodshed! They were everything Damoritosh had taught her to revile. </p> 
                <p>Obo desperately hoped they were still alive.</p> 
                <p>“Hang tight, little friends,” she whispered. “Obo’s coming for you.”</p> 
                <p>Rifle barrel leading the way, she stepped into the darkness.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>The trail led, of course, to a tavern.</p> 
                <p itemprop="description">Watching from a hidden perch across the street, Ulthor studied the place. It was a stinking, squalid wreck in Absalom’s Puddles district. Dead fish lay half-surfaced in the sucking mud around the entrance, their rotted heads poking up as if straining for one last breath. Inside, the air was thick with flayleaf and pesh smoke, spilled ale and unwashed bodies, and the pervasive, inescapable stench of the Puddles’ foul tides. Dingy gray cloth covered the grimy windows and hung from the rafters, turning the already-dim tavern into a warren of shadows.</p> 
                <p>The Rat of Gonevar had sunk low in the world since Ulthor had last had the trail. Still a weak man, prone to weak vices, but without the money or friends to indulge them extravagantly anymore.</p> 
                <p>That was good. It would make apprehension easier.</p> 
                <p><i>There</i>. Ulthor spotted the Rat’s battered hat bobbing through an alley as the man picked his way across the muddy duckboards. The hat was different, and its jaunty feather too, but Ulthor recognized his quarry’s limp immediately. The Rat had lost half his left foot at their last meeting.</p> 
                <p>Beneath his grim iron helm, Ulthor permitted himself the barest semblance of a smile. No more than the slightest softening at the corners of his eyes and mouth, the most change he ever allowed in his habitually stony expression. It had been a long hunt.</p> 
                <p>“Prepare to move,” Ulthor told his fellow knights. He’d requisitioned three Hellknights of the Rack as support from the local chapter house. The Order of the Rack generally lacked the finesse he would have preferred, but its Hellknights were as terrifyingly fierce and incorruptible as the Chain’s. They’d do.</p> 
                <p>“Terms of apprehension?” one of the Rack knights asked.</p> 
                <p>Ulthor was briefly surprised. He hadn’t expected the Hellknights of the Rack to care. “The Rat of Gonevar must be taken. Preferably alive, but dead is acceptable. Minimize other casualties. Those who do not interfere should not be harmed.”</p> 
                <p>“And those who do?”</p> 
                <p>“Will be guilty of obstructing a lawful enforcement action.” Ulthor tacked the arrest warrant onto the face of his shield so that he could display it while keeping his hands free. Small chance that the patrons of the Puddles would respect the warrant’s authority, but a small chance was better than none. He preferred not to break skulls unnecessarily. “Further questions?”</p> 
                <p>There were none. Ulthor dispatched two Hellknights to watch the tavern’s rear and side exits. Once they were in place, he led the third to its front door. Mud-spattered urchins and drunk idlers, suddenly and nervously sober, melted away from the tavern as the Hellknights approached.</p> 
                <p>Ulthor ignored them. The tavern’s door was already open, but he kicked it anyway, shattering the weather-beaten wood against the wall to announce the Hellknights’ arrival.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/090519_Hellknights.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/090519_Hellknights.jpg" style="width:100%" alt="In the middle of a crowded, seedy-looking tavern, a heavily-armored Hellknight cleaves through a table with a massive two-handed sword while a trio of cohorts terrorize patrons in the background."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Tomasz Chistowski</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>“Dunryl of Gonevar!” Ulthor shouted into the shocked quiet. “You stand charged with desertion, murder, and trafficking in profane corruptions. Submit to the lawful authority of the Order of the Chain.”</p> 
                <p>“Don’t believe I will,” the Rat drawled. His tone was full of bravado, but even in the tavern’s poor light, Ulthor could see the Rat’s knotted jaw and shaking hands. Withdrawal, and fear. Mostly fear. “I’m a hero of Andoran, I am.”</p> 
                <p>“We’re free people here,” one of the other card players blustered. He squinted at Ulthor with hostile, ale-fogged eyes. “Free people. Unafraid.”</p> 
                <p>“You tell ‘im, Gammel,” the Rat encouraged, scooting his own chair back discreetly.</p> 
                <p>Gammel launched a clumsy fist at Ulthor. The Hellknight knocked his swipe away with a short punch of his own, driving a mailed fist into the drunkard’s face. Gammel’s nose crunched bloodily under the blow, but Ulthor held back his strength. The drunkard didn’t deserve to die over this.</p> 
                <p>The Rat was reaching under the table for a hidden weapon. Kicking Gammel and his chair aside, Ulthor brought his sword down on the table, smashing the wooden top, the cudgel that the Rat had been reaching for beneath it, and the Rat’s arm.</p> 
                <p>“You are a liar and a coward,” the Hellknight announced, his voice thundering over the Rat’s cry of outraged agony. “You murdered your superior officer and two comrades, stole a shipment of slaves, and sold all but the youngest and most impressionable. Those you released to spread false tales of your heroism. Then you began ‘rescuing’ slaves so that you could pin unholy texts and secret corruptions into their clothes and minds, using them as unwitting mules to carry foul contraband through Andoran. These are your crimes, Dunryl of Gonevar.”</p> 
                <p>Most of Ulthor’s recitation went unheard. At the sight of bare steel, the tavern erupted into chaos. Patrons threw mugs and half-full slop bowls at Ulthor, and then at the Rack Hellknights who charged in to support him. Others shouted and jeered, less interested in defending the Rat of Gonevar than in spitting on the nearest symbol of authority. The law wasn’t popular in the Puddles.</p> 
                <p>The Rack Hellknights moved to stop the brawling. They were efficient, methodical, and brutal. Bones cracked. Iron thudded into unprotected flesh. The taunts and jeers turned to panicked cries and bloody-mouthed moans.</p> 
                <p>Ulthor didn’t give them a glance. He reached over the splintered table, ignoring Gammel’s squeak of terror, and grabbed the Rat by his broken arm.</p> 
                <p>“You bastard!” the Rat shouted, hysterical with pain. “Five years it’s been, and you won’t leave me alone! You broke my <i>arm!</i>”</p> 
                <p>“Submit,” Ulthor said. His gauntleted fist flexed. Bones ground together in his grip.</p> 
                <p>The Rat swayed on the brink of blacking out. “Let me go. Let me go! I can tell you — things. All kinds of things. Schemes. Secrets. The — the moaners’ cults. The smugglers. The people who hired me. I can give them to you. <i>Please!</i>”</p> 
                <p>Ulthor relaxed his grip minutely. Behind them, the brawl had died down. Only the groans and whimpers of the injured could be heard now. The Rack Hellknights moved among the fallen, dealing out extra blows to those who refused to stay down.</p> 
                <p>“Please,” the Rat sobbed.</p> 
                <p>“I am a Hellknight of the Chain,” Ulthor told him. He stood, dragging the Rat to his feet by his broken arm. “It was my duty to apprehend you. But if what you say is true, it is not my duty to keep you. Unholy cults are not within my order’s remit.”</p> 
                <p>Somehow the Rat managed to swallow the shriek of pain that started up his throat. Despite it all, hope ignited in his eyes. “Then we’ve got a deal? You’ll let me go?”</p> 
                <p>“No,” Ulthor said. “I will send you to the Order of the Pyre.”</p> 
                <p>And then he smiled, <i>really</i> smiled, as the Rat of Gonevar screamed.</p>

                <p>If you’ve joined us for our first few weeks of the Pathfinder Society campaign, you know that we still have a few bugs to work out to get the campaign running smoothly. Between improving and fleshing out the Pathfinder Society Guide to Play, fixing issues with reporting scenarios, getting the Achievement Points chart online, and other bits and pieces that have come up, we’re working hard to get the campaign to a place we can all be proud of. On top of all of that, we know that players and GMs are all learning an entirely new game system.</p> 
                <p>We’d like to give our community time to explore, learn, and not worry about looking back on their past character decisions and wishing they had made different ones. To that end, we’ll be releasing a free, limited-time boon on the Achievement Points chart, which you can apply immediately to rebuild your character. The window for applying this boon will close on September 19th. Rebuilding will continue to appear on the Achievement Points chart after that date, but it will no longer be a free option. </p> 
                <p>Thank you to all our players and GMs who jumped in and provided feedback! We cannot have a campaign without you all and we greatly value your communication.</p> 
                <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
                <p>We had no new additions to the recipient roster this month. </p> 
                <h2>Stars</h2> 
                <p>As we said before, even though publication of Pathfinder Society (first edition) scenarios wrapped in July, we are still supporting the program. This includes GMs earning their 5th star for running games. This month, two GMs obtained their last star. To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Huge kudos on your achievement!</p>

                <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> 
                <p>We’re manually compiling the data from the rubric reviews while we work to get the online reporting in place! Please send any reviews to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                <h2>Convention Listing</h2> 
                <p>We have organized play activities at quite a few conventions in the upcoming months, so if you want to get your game on, check out the list below! The list includes all the event support requests received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>
