  \ </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">It never failed\
  \ to amaze Devi, coming out of Drift. The sensation, visual and mental, of time\
  \ and space returning to their normal flow, of planets, stars, and the black expanding\
  \ to their normal size. The tiny feeling of relief that he’d made it through.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Devi’s route through the Drift had taken just under three days. Even\
  \ though it was quite rare for Drift voyages that short to encounter disaster, ships\
  \ traveling in Near Space still occasionally disappeared. Triune’s miraculous space\
  \ highway had done wonders for the Pact Worlds, opening new planets and cultures\
  \ for all, but using it wasn’t without risk. During his trip, he’d seen swirling\
  \ black holes, ancient debris from long-wrecked spaceships, and the far-off silhouettes\
  \ of creatures with more eyes and tentacles than he could count, but nothing directly\
  \ threatened his ship and making it safely still felt especially good.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>He piloted a heavily modified Ringworks Wanderer he’d gotten for an amazing\
  \ deal at an underground auction in an off-the-grid port in Akiton. Devi had asked\
  \ no questions and the ysoki auction runner had named no names. Devi liked to think\
  \ there was honor among the same species, but even so, he’d personally gone over\
  \ the ship to make sure there were no problems and after installing a custom Drift\
  \ engine and new pilot controls to fit his height, the <i>Winding Jaunt</i> was\
  \ fit for interstellar travel. She could hold a crew of three—her ideal crew size—\
  but Devi could never seem to hold onto crewmates. That’s probably why he hadn’t\
  \ yet risen high in the Starfinder Society. After life in an overstuffed warren\
  \ under the eyes of innumerable relatives, he liked traveling alone. It was better\
  \ that way, out in the black with nothing but his thoughts and the far-off stars.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>The <i>Winding Jaunt</i> drew closer to her destination, the orange\
  \ and purple-tinged planet growing larger on the front display screen. An unexplored\
  \ planet around a yellow sun, one of the few that could support organic life. One\
  \ of countless worlds on the edges of Near Space, just outside the unknown edges\
  \ of the Vast. Devi had listened to a crusty vesk spacer talking about its coordinates\
  \ while he’d been in port buying supplies to send back to the warren weeks ago.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Devi was glad he’d followed up on the pirate’s drunken boasts. There\
  \ the planet was, sure as daylight. And if the readings Devi was getting were any\
  \ indication, this world was filled with all kinds of biodiverse lifeforms. Large\
  \ bodies of water. Breathable atmosphere, too, at least with the right adjustments\
  \ to his suit. Some heavy thaumic surges, but an overall stable reality field. This\
  \ could be his ticket to promotion in the Starfinder Society, crew or not. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>As the <i>Jaunt</i> entered atmo, Devi initiated the ship’s landing\
  \ sequence and set the computer scanners to find a suitable landing zone—a clear\
  \ field near a forest, but with enough sightlines that he’d see anything overtly\
  \ dangerous approaching his ship and have enough time to respond. After reviewing\
  \ scans of several possibilities, Devi chose an open clearing near a lightly wooded\
  \ area, just a couple of clicks from one of the planet’s oceans. </p> \n      <p>The\
  \ <i>Jaunt</i> descended, adjusting its pressure, wards, and shielding so the vessel\
  \ wouldn’t burn up as it let gravity do some of the ship’s work. Devi used the next\
  \ hour to review his own supplies. Enough food and water for a few weeks. His weapons\
  \ and armor were primed and charged, his AI ocular implant set to record and catalog\
  \ all new forms of life he came across. He even had some trinkets, coins, and other\
  \ useful items should he come across any sapient species looking to trade. Though\
  \ that seemed unlikely. So far, the ship’s scanners had detected no trace of technology\
  \ or sentient-made shelters. With a final push from its thrusters, the ship landed\
  \ in its chosen clearing and made a scan of the perimeter. </p> \n      <p>“So far,\
  \ so good,” Devi murmured to himself and his AI. This was one of his favorite parts.\
  \ The moment before stepping outside into the unknown. A chance to learn new things,\
  \ discover key mysteries of the universe. It was like a fine wine or cheese, to\
  \ be savored for as long as possible. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ Toledo</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Devi lowered himself from the ships platform\
  \ and took a step out into a whole new world. It was more wonderous than he’d allowed\
  \ himself to imagine. Purple and orange light filled a lush, open forest, covered\
  \ with vegetation that—at least according to his AI—were not catalogued in the Society’\
  s archives. He could hear far off grunts and screeches, reminding him of birdsong\
  \ or mammalian apes. The ground felt solid. The atmosphere, with a few minor adjustments,\
  \ tasted sweet.</p> \n      <p>The planet was beautiful. Pristine and untouched.\
  \ He must do his best to keep it so during his exploration. He began to walk toward\
  \ the trees. It wasn’t long before he encountered his first new species. His AI\
  \ ran through its database and could find no matches. It bore some similarities\
  \ to various types of gecko, but it carried its young in a pouch, an adaptation\
  \ usually reserved for mammalian life.</p> \n      <p>He watched in fascination\
  \ as the lizard-like creature pulled a bulbous-looking fruit from a nearby branch\
  \ and fed it to the young one in its front pouch. Though Devi had taken care to\
  \ stay upwind from the creature, it must have heard his quiet footfalls in the grass,\
  \ for the creature quickly turned to face him. </p> \n      <p>Fleshy pink antennae\
  \ extended from either side of the creature’s head behind its large eyes and pointed\
  \ themselves at him. Devi felt a presence in his mind. Although he had never experienced\
  \ it before, it seemed similar to what he had learned about how telepathy and psychic\
  \ magic worked. The message in his mind was primal, instinctual.</p> \n      <p><i>Prey\
  \ / notprey? <br> Hunger / nothunger? <br> I-not-food. No-food-me. Look-other-place.</i></p>\
  \ \n      <p>The last bit was accompanied by a gentle push on his mind. Devi had\
  \ not been thinking of the fascinating creature as food, but felt sure that if he\
  \ had been considering eating it, the influence from the creature may have convinced\
  \ him, or at least a creature of lesser intelligence, to leave it alone. </p> \n\
  \      <p>“Instinctual telepathy,” muttered Devi to himself. Perhaps his own mind,\
  \ or his AI, had translated the mental push into words. “Remarkable.”</p> \n   \
  \   <p>The creature grew alarmed at his continued presence. Both antennae expanded.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><i>Stepback.<br> Stepback<br> Stepback.</i></p> \n      <p>Without\
  \ meaning to, Devi almost took a step back, only stopping himself mid-gesture as\
  \ he realized the creature had pushed him to do so. Now the creature and its brood\
  \ looked terrified. Devi tried to calm the creature with his own thoughts, but it\
  \ only shifted its face quizzically</p> \n      <p><i>No-sky-thinker</i>, Devi heard\
  \ back in his mind. After pondering this a moment, he realized sky meant above,\
  \ higher-up, that the creature couldn’t parse his… words? He’d need to use something\
  \ other than words to reassure it. </p> \n      <p>Devi was no xenodruid, who drew\
  \ power and magic from the cycles of the natural world, though he’d heard stories\
  \ of them while still a youngling in the warren. Kasathas debating philosophy with\
  \ the animals of the forest. Elves disappearing into living trees and emerging from\
  \ different trees half a world away. Nature priests living for a thousand years\
  \ or more in an ongoing cycle of rebirth. What would they do, in this moment? </p>\
  \ \n      <p>Closing his eyes, Devi tried to think in pictures. He thought of himself\
  \ eating plants, of gently petting the creature. He thought of his den mothers in\
  \ the warren, of safety, comfort, and a warm thermal blanket. When he opened his\
  \ eyes, he saw that the creature had drawn closer to him, the muscles in its body\
  \ less tense, the ridges on its back no longer standing erect. </p> \n      <p><i>Not-prey-not-death</i>,\
  \ the creature emoted to its child in what felt like a happy croon. <i>Safe-friend</i>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Devi nodded. The creature’s antennae retracted into the sides of its\
  \ head and it wandered off, though not before brushing against Devi’s leg in friendship.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Overhead, several winged creatures zipped through the air, moving almost\
  \ too fast for Devi to see them. Luckily, his AI recorded them through his ocular\
  \ implant, so he could review the footage later at his leisure. Right now, Devi\
  \ was more interested in the giant megafauna he saw sipping water from a nearby\
  \ stream.</p> \n      <p>Fascinated, he stealthily approached the herd, continuing\
  \ to record footage through his ocular implant. Their thick hides were dark blue\
  \ and green, with long tentacles slowly undulating out from their maws and necks.\
  \ The large creatures took slow gentle sips from the lake they’d gathered around,\
  \ some pausing to munch on the green grass at their feet. Slow, calm, not too bright.\
  \ They seemed like peaceable herbivores, so Devi sent a command to his AI to scan\
  \ them more thoroughly and record all the data. It was something of a surprise when\
  \ the herd all raised their tentacles, the air about them rippled like water, and\
  \ the creatures vanished before his eyes. </p> \n      <p>Devi studied the edges\
  \ of the lake for some trace of the creatures. It wasn’t until he heard ground-shaking\
  \ footsteps behind him that he looked over his shoulder. There the megafauna stood,\
  \ regarding him with strange, solemn eyes. Devi backed away slowly, keeping his\
  \ eyes on them, but his arms spread wide to show he was no threat. </p> \n     \
  \ <p>Had they teleported? There was no sign of such magic. But… he checked his AI’\
  s chronometer to find it was acting strangely. He looked at the ground where the\
  \ creatures had stood. No foot prints. No recently eaten bare patches in the tall\
  \ grass. </p> \n      <p>Had they… but that was… Devi almost thought <i>impossible</i>,\
  \ but then he remembered all the wonders he’d heard about when joining the Starfinders.\
  \ Nothing out near the Vast was impossible. Only undiscovered. </p> \n      <p>If\
  \ these readings were right, then it hadn’t been his imagination. The creatures\
  \ had apparently traveled back in time, just several seconds, in only their individual\
  \ timelines, to the point before they’d reached the lake, just so they could see\
  \ if he was a threat. Perhaps their tentacles were somehow able to unravel the quantum\
  \ threads of localized time…</p> \n      <p>Instinctive, short-range time travel\
  \ as a natural defense. The Society wouldn’t believe this. The possibilities were\
  \ staggering. He wondered how far back their range went. Seconds? Minutes? If technomancers\
  \ were able to synthesize how the creatures could achieve this affect…</p> \n  \
  \    <p>The sun began to set beyond the far-off amber sea by the time he finished\
  \ noting all he could about the creatures. Daylight passed quickly on this world,\
  \ it seemed. Devi knew it was time to get back to the <i>Jaunt</i>. Two giant moons\
  \ began to glow in the lavender twilight above. Devi would have to take notes and\
  \ study just how they affected the sea’s tides, or if they pulled at the planet’\
  s natural magical and life forces. </p> \n      <p>Back in his ship, Devi powered\
  \ up the defensive shields and settled into his bunk. He thought about all he’d\
  \ seen today. His findings would get him several accommodations. This planet was\
  \ a wonder—and still in Near Space for all that! And its native life! These creatures\
  \ had adapted to escape and survive in such astounding ways. Instinctual telepathy\
  \ and short-range temporal travel. It just showed how amazing evolution was.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Only as he started to drowse off to the night-sounds outside the ship\
  \ did the question occur. </p> \n      <p>Just what had they evolved to escape from?</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For the first time since leaving the warren, Devi found himself wishing\
  \ he had a crew. Wide awake now, he didn’t think he’d get much sleep tonight. Outside,\
  \ the sun sank beneath the purple sea and darkness covered the planet. The wilderness\
  \ grew quiet, as if waiting for something to emerge. </p> \n     </blockquote> \n\
