  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Veerkea’s life began\
  \ at sea. Literally, of course: like almost all ijtikris, she hatched from a free-floating\
  \ egg, grew as an instinct-driven larva for two years, and metamorphosed into her\
  \ adult, squid-like body before clambering to shore, drawing her first breath of\
  \ air, and searching for other ijtikris to adopt as her family. Yet, ijtikris hadn’\
  t ruled the planet Iji since ancient times, when the technologically superior Veskarium\
  \ conquered, annexed, and renamed the world Vesk-2, the first of many conquests.\
  \ So, when young Veerkea first peeked her upper eyes above the waves, she instead\
  \ spotted and reflexively bonded to a vesk squadron performing amphibious landing\
  \ drills along the beach. The vesk gave her a name and a hearty welcome, delighted\
  \ in teaching her Vesk profanity for the afternoon, and then transported her to\
  \ the nearest settlement on the isle of Ijahi for proper adoption, but Veerkea vehemently\
  \ and violently protested being separated from her new family. Impressed by her\
  \ outburst’s ferocity and considering this a sign the god Damoritosh’s favor, the\
  \ local commander allowed the new unit to remain together.</p> \n     <p>Part daughter,\
  \ part mascot, Veerkea thrived under her myriad parents’ tutelage. Her formal education\
  \ was straightforward: Veskarium lore, physical training, tactics, weapon proficiency,\
  \ demolitions, and field repairs. Wherever the unit traveled, she absorbed languages,\
  \ cultural norms, and local technologies even more quickly than her basic foundation.\
  \ In her final year abroad, the unit operated alongside a predominantly shirren\
  \ humanitarian mission on a survey of Swarm-ravaged worlds. Where survivors held\
  \ out, the joint operation provided material aid, spiritual succor courtesy of the\
  \ god Hylax, and assistance clearing out remaining Swarm hives. Where none had survived,\
  \ the operation catalogued the damage and whatever remained of these now extinct\
  \ societies. With each ruined world, Veerkea not only grew more intrigued by the\
  \ compassionate teachings of Hylax, the Forever Queen, she also saw parallels between\
  \ these ravaged planets and unanswered questions she had about her own home world.\
  \ Who were the ijtikris really? And what were they like before the Veskarium invaded?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To their credit, both the shirrens and vesk supported her inquiries.\
  \ Her sergeant-mother, Bhaskeh, secured her what scant imperial documentation survived\
  \ the pre-Gap conquest of Vesk-2. The more Veerkea read, though, the more the narrative\
  \ fell apart, seemingly stitched together by placating guesses from fifth-hand sources.\
  \ Even the venerated poem <em>Skyships Over Shallow Seas</em>, supposedly written\
  \ by an eyewitness, began with “The skyships arrived with the monsoon rains,” yet\
  \ the planet had never experienced seasons, much less monsoons. Veerkea had to learn\
  \ more, and with Bhaskeh’s glowing recommendation to their superiors, the ijtikri\
  \ secured admission to the prestigious Xakemath College of Cultural Studies on Vesk\
  \ Prime. </p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/40ecbb53-a04b-4b7b-be5d-0b7e60b51792/092021_Nanocyteiconic.jpg\"\

  \   </div> \n   <p>It proved a terrible fit. The social sciences had undergone an\
  \ uneasy revolution since the Silent War’s conclusion years before, but the Xakemath\
  \ College of Cultural Studies remained a stubborn bastion of tenure and tradition.\
  \ Its curriculum taught culture through the Veskarium’s lens: understanding Veskarium\
  \ cultures as they fit into the empire, identifying fissures in alien societies\
  \ to exploit during war, leveraging key cultural traditions in conquered peoples\
  \ to minimize rebellion and maximize harmony, and exploring ruins to salvage forgotten\
  \ technologies for integration into the military. In practice, Veerkea absorbed\
  \ few affirmative lessons from her required reading, instead treating each record\
  \ as another miscalculation in vesk xenoanthropology. Though she was too shy to\
  \ challenge her instructors’ lectures in person, her essays became increasingly\
  \ confident critiques of the field. Perhaps surprisingly, her instructors never\
  \ punished her dissident thoughts. Instead, her essays registered as heartfelt challenge—\
  like a young warrior boasting about her unbeatable combat style—and, by Damoritosh,\
  \ the best way to test insolent claims was on the battlefield! They had just the\
  \ site in mind.</p> \n   <p>To her surprise, Veerkea graduated with distinction\
  \ a year early, and with her diploma came her new assignment as archaeological consultant\
  \ to a military operation on a no-name planetoid along the Veskarium’s frontier.\
  \ The low-gravity rock was barren save for a crashed starship and the hundred soldiers\
  \ forming a perimeter around it, with heavy weapons trained on the wreckage. The\
  \ commander quickly checked her paperwork, asked if she was the negotiator they\
  \ were waiting for and, without waiting for her answer, called out to the soldiers:\
  \ “Make way! We’re sending in the archaeologist!” Giving her a datapad and a grim\
  \ salute, the commander wished Veerkea luck and pointed her to the wreckage.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>She skimmed files as quickly as she could—wreckage that seemed to predate\
  \ the Gap, advanced technology, initial successes by salvage crews…then attacks,\
  \ robotic clouds that shredded flesh from the inside out, and several skirmishes\
  \ fought to a stalemate. What a mess. She clambered inside through an airlock blown\
  \ off by Vesk ordnance and began exploring and documenting the mysterious starship.\
  \ Although unfamiliar, the technologies seemed intuitive, and she experimentally\
  \ flipped a few switches to check for power. Something awoke. Rushing along the\
  \ corridors, countless particles swarmed together into a roiling mass of nanites\
  \ that screeched an unintelligible challenge. Veerkea froze, wanting to reach for\
  \ her sidearm. Yet she spotted the bullet holes and triple gashes of doshko blades\
  \ here and knew that not only had the vesk tried combat and failed, but also that\
  \ her own methodologies were being put to the test. And so, she spoke.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>For more than an hour, the cloud and ijtikri spoke past one another, struggling\
  \ to find some common linguistic ground. She drew simple pictures on the datapad,\
  \ the cloud reshaped itself into simple pictures of its own, yet their slow progress\
  \ seemed only to aggravate the strange being. Lacking a better option, Veerkea sketched\
  \ Hylax’s sacred symbol. In an instant of apparent curiosity or recognition, the\
  \ cloud calmed, slowed, and approached. As it formed pseudopods to touch the symbol,\
  \ Veerkea lifted one of her own arms in greeting, and the cloud obliged by reaching\
  \ out to make contact. With a touch, the ijtikri’s mind swam with the cloud’s projected\
  \ telepathic thoughts.</p> \n   <p><em>“I am the child of a devastated world</em>,”\
  \ sang the voice, yet Veerkea thought the same words and knew them true of herself.\
  \ Again, they projected their thoughts at each other, each saying, “<em>Mine is\
  \ a history all have forgotten.</em>” A shiver rippled through the cloud, as though\
  \ it were confused or pleasantly surprised by how closely their thoughts aligned.\
  \ Embarrassed, Verrkea motioned for her strange friend to speak first, and the cloud\
  \ obliged, reshaping itself into hazy silhouettes of skylines, landscapes, and people\
  \ as it spoke. “<em>I remember so little: beautiful cities with soaring arches,\
  \ rolling hills rising above purple seas, creatures whose names I don’t know, people\
  \ with stories I have forgotten…and then here</em>.” The cloud stopped swirling\
  \ and reshaping. “<em>Alone. Homeless.</em>”</p> \n   <p>Veerkea’s eyes dimmed with\
  \ sadness, and she offered her own tale of conflict, devastation, and dogma, yet\
  \ also of compassion, camaraderie, and discovery. Of a young ijtikri who poked her\
  \ eyes above the waves and found an unconditionally supportive family…and she ended\
  \ her thoughts with “<em>Not alone</em>.” Less a statement of sympathy than a promise.\
  \ Sensing an invitation, the cloud washed over Veerkea, settling on her before the\
  \ particles painlessly melded into her skin. “<em>Not alone</em>,” it echoed. “\
  <em>Home</em>.”</p> \n   <p>Veerkea’s apparent victory impressed the Veskarium,\
  \ with her superiors equating her taming the nanites to a warrior taming a wild\
  \ defrex to use as a mount. However, Veerkea retired after only a few more years,\
  \ using her earnings to travel the stars and catalogue forgotten societies’ stories.\
  \ Her and her nanites’ thoughts are as one, yet on occasion and without warning,\
  \ the cloud reshapes into some image as if reliving a forgotten dream or channeling\
  \ some omen from Hylax. Veerkea is quick to catalogue these strange clues, certain\
  \ that one day they’ll help her locate her passengers’ lost home.</p> \n   <p style=\"\
