  \ Gold Goblin</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 14, 2008</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Shadow in the Sky\" begins with a grand gambling tournament at a Riddleport gaming\
  \ hall called the Gold Goblin. The PCs can take time during this opening scene to\
  \ meet each other, get to know some of the adventure's key NPCs, and maybe make\
  \ a little money. Of course, no gambling tournament in Riddleport would be complete\
  \ without some quirky local games—and in <i>Pathfinder</i> #13, we give you four\
  \ new games with which to separate your players from their cash! One of these games\
  \ is a dice game called Bounder, excerpted below.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n    \
  \ <p><b>Bounder</b></p> \n     <p><i>\"Bounder, bounder, bounder! No doubles, no\
  \ doubles!\"</i></p> \n     <p><b>What You'll Need:</b> 3d6 for the dealer and 2d20\
  \ for each player, plus coins to track bets.</p> \n     <p><b>How to Play:</b> Bounder\
  \ is unique among gambling games in that both the players and dealer use dice. The\
  \ dealer gets three 6-sided dice, and each player gets two 20-siders.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>To start, each player bets a stake (minimum 1 sp). Each player rolls his first\
  \ d20, making his \"point.\" After all players have rolled their points, each player\
  \ may double his stake if desired. </p> \n     <p> Then the dealer rolls 3d6. Anyone\
  \ whose point the dealer matches loses his stake. </p> \n     <p> Then each player\
  \ rolls his second d20. If the player's two dice results are on either side of the\
  \ dealer's result—one greater than and one less than the dealer's number—he \"bounds\"\
  \ the dealer and wins an amount equal to the amount he bet. Otherwise, he loses\
  \ his stake. </p> \n     <p> If a player rolls a 1 and a 20 (or a 20 and a 1), he\
  \ wins double his bet. </p> \n     <p><b>Odds:</b> The house edge in this game is\
  \ 18% without any doubling. A player over time will get about 7/17 of his money\
  \ back. Extreme points (1, 2, 19 and 20) are as good as 47.5%, so doubling is wiser\
  \ there (but still not wise). </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>James Jacobs <br>\
