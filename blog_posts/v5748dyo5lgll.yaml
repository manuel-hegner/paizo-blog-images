  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Dylan Birtolo</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: A Knight with\
  \ a Cause</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>\"Let me see if I understand\
  \ you right.\"</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Marra paused the work she was\
  \ doing: attaching a new leather strap to the inside of the pauldron that wasn't\
  \ frayed and was small enough to fit her arm. She looked at Eron through strands\
  \ of dark hair that had managed to work free from the leather thong she used to\
  \ tie it back. Sweat coated her face from the effort of working on the armor, but\
  \ even though her muscles ached for relief, she couldn't keep the grin from her\
  \ face.</p> \n    <p>\"You find a dead body in the woods,\" Eron went on, \"and\
  \ discover that it's a knight of Lastwall, probably a few hours from the main road.\
  \ So rather than do the sensible thing and bring the body back, or even ignore it\
  \ completely, you decide to bring the armor back and steal it for yourself? Do you\
  \ have any idea how disrespectful that is?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I buried the body.\"\
  \ It was true. Marra felt like it was the least she could do considering the situation.\
  \ It may not have been the best of graves, but at least the body wouldn't be picked\
  \ at by scavengers. It seemed a waste to bury the man's equipment with him. Especially\
  \ since it could be put to much better use.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, because that makes\
  \ it all right? As long as you buried the body and said a simple blessing over the\
  \ gravesite, you can steal his weapons and armor? If anyone finds out, there'll\
  \ be hell to pay.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well then, I guess we'll have to make sure no\
  \ one finds out.\" </p> \n    <p>Marra flashed him a smile and then bent back to\
  \ the work of attaching the strap. She had never designed or used armor before,\
  \ but the process was simple when she had a model to go on. And the armor did mostly\
  \ fit her. She just needed to replace a few straps and a few pieces where the armor\
  \ had been torn. After that, it would be a simple matter to change some etchings\
  \ on the leather to alter the look.</p> \n    <p>Once she was satisfied that the\
  \ rivet was sufficiently flattened, she lifted up the pauldron and put it on her\
  \ shoulder. Eron came over with a sigh and checked the strap for her while she held\
  \ it in place. He knew the drill by now. He took the strap and marked where it touched\
  \ the buckle. After he finished that, Marra took the pauldron off and punched holes\
  \ in the strap for the buckle, adding a few to each side of the marking just in\
  \ case.</p> \n    <p>\"What are you hoping to do with this, anyway?\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"I'm going to use it to deal with the Molthuni bandits.\"</p> \n    <p>Eron's\
  \ mouth hung open as he stood in silence. It was entertaining to see the shock on\
  \ his face. Even after all the years growing up together, Marra never got sick of\
  \ causing that look. He shook his head from side to side before he managed to form\
  \ words again.</p> \n    <p>\"You can't be serious. You're going to ride out and\
  \ try to track them down? Do you know how crazy you sound right now?\"</p> \n  \

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> Marra will do what it takes to help her people.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>\"You're the crazy one. I'm not stupid and I'm not going to\
  \ try and chase down an entire bandit camp. That's even if they're here to begin\
  \ with. They might be crossing over from Molthune every day and then running back\
  \ home when they've finished harassing us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then how is this going\
  \ to help? It isn't like you'll be able to wear a suit of armor around town in case\
  \ of another attack. Even if you could, too many people will ask questions.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Marra hesitated, trying to look like she was too focused on her work\
  \ to respond immediately, even if it was just measuring and cutting a second strap\
  \ for the other pauldron. The truth was that she didn't know how Eron would react\
  \ to the details of her plan. She knew he would call her crazy again, and with good\
  \ reason. Her idea might be more insane than attempting to find the bandits on her\
  \ own. But, it was also something she knew she needed to try. If she was successful,\
  \ she might just be able to convince Lastwall how much her people needed its support\
  \ and military aid. It was a chance she had to take.</p> \n    <p>\"Remember how\
  \ I told you that the trail was covered with signs of a large group passing through?\
  \ It looked like at least twenty horses, and a couple of wagons, too. The trail\
  \ wasn't that old, so the knight had to have come from that party. Probably got\
  \ injured, ran into the woods, and got lost. People get lost in Fangwood all the\
  \ time. So there's probably a whole group of knights heading south. If I can join\
  \ up with them, I can convince them that the Molthuni are to blame and it isn't\
  \ just random bandits. And then once they know that, they'll have to report it back\
  \ home, and Lastwall will have to support us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"How are you going\
  \ to get them to listen to you? You're just a tanner.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not if I\
  \ come to them dressed as a knight of Lastwall.\"</p> \n    <p>Eron's eyes widened\
  \ and he whipped his head around as if to make sure no one else was in the room.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"You can't be serious. Please tell me you aren't serious. You know\
  \ what they'd do to you?\"</p> \n    <p>Marra drew her lips into a tight line. Of\
  \ course she knew the risk she was taking. But the potential reward of help from\
  \ Lastwall more than outweighed the dangers of her plan.</p> \n    <p>\"You know\
  \ damn well that we can't survive if we have to keep dealing with the Molthuni raiding\
  \ our homes. And who's to say how long until they decide to launch an all-out invasion\
  \ and take our lands? If Lastwall won't help us, we're dead anyway.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"You're crazy. I can't help you with this. You're going to get killed and\
  \ I won't be part of it. I can't have you riding off to your own funeral.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Eron pushed away from the table he was leaning against and walked to\
  \ the door, shaking his head. He reached out and put his hand on the doorknob, but\
  \ didn't turn it. Marra just watched him, confident that she knew the arguments\
  \ running through his head. He had to know how important this was and that it might\
  \ be their best chance to get Lastwall to do something other than make an empty\
  \ statement of support. Eron's arm tensed, but the door didn't move. With a slight\
  \ turn to his head he spoke over his shoulder.</p> \n    <p>\"You're really going\
  \ to do this, aren't you?\"</p> \n    <p>Marra put down her tools and let the pauldron\
  \ rest on her work bench. She crossed her arms in front of her but kept her voice\
  \ gentle.</p> \n    <p>\"I need to do this. I need to do something. I can't just\
  \ sit here and pretend like nothing is wrong and keep burying myself in my work.\
  \ And like you said, I can't just ride off and go fight the bandits. I'm not stupid.\
  \ This seems like the best thing I can do to help. And if it means risking my life,\
  \ I'm not doing any more than anyone else.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I still say it's stupid\
  \ and it's going to get you killed. But, I also know how stubborn you can be once\
  \ you get an idea in your head. You'd make rocks back down.\"</p> \n    <p>Eron\
  \ let his hand slide off the doorknob and turned back to face her. One side of his\
  \ mouth turned up in a semblance of a grin. It was another look that Marra knew\
  \ well. He would help her, even if he didn't agree with what she was doing. And\
  \ she knew she could count on him to keep their secret from the rest of the village.\
  \ The fewer who knew about her charade, the better.</p> \n    <p>It took them a\
  \ few more hours of work, but by the time they were finished, Marra had a suit of\
  \ armor that would fit her. Her first impression after putting it on was how heavy\
  \ it felt and how much it slowed her movements. She didn't know if she would be\
  \ able to wear it for an extended period, but she was committed to her course now.\
  \ There was no turning back.</p> \n    <p>After wearing the suit for several minutes\
  \ and seeing how it affected her movement, Marra took it off and packed it up in\
  \ her saddlebags. When she brought it out to her horse, she discovered the armor\
  \ was even harder to carry than it was to wear. She was only able to sling the cumbersome\
  \ bag up behind her saddle with Eron's help. The sword was too large to fit in the\
  \ bag, so Marra wrapped it in a cloak and attached it to the side of the saddle.\
  \ Satisfied that her gear was properly stowed, she filled a smaller bag with some\
  \ basic trail supplies that should last her for a few days.</p> \n    <p>Marra and\
  \ Eron rode out of the village, following the trail that led to the main path skirting\
  \ the Fangwood's western edge. Once they were out of sight, they pulled to a stop\
  \ and dismounted. Eron helped her into her armor, attaching the pieces she couldn't\
  \ reach. Again, once she was fully suited up, she moved around a bit, amazed at\
  \ how much the metal and leather restricted her. She had expected that, but experiencing\
  \ it was another matter.</p> \n    <p>\"You sure you want to do this?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>Marra nodded, gripping her saddle as she put her foot in the stirrup. With\
  \ a grunt and a heave, she pulled herself into the seat. The horse puffed as Marra\
  \ dropped her heavier weight against his back. She untied the sword, fumbling with\
  \ the weapon as she tried to slide it into her belt. When it rested there, it pressed\
  \ up against the horse's back leg and he danced around, trying to move away from\
  \ the pressure until she removed it.</p> \n    <p>\"Try hanging it on your saddle.\
  \ That's how I've seen other knights do it.\"</p> \n    <p>Marra took his advice,\
  \ hanging the weapon off the front of her saddle on the left side. It was still\
  \ within easy reach there, but didn't press up against the horse.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Told you I need you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And I told you that I still think you're crazy\
  \ for trying this. But please, come back to us. If you change your mind, no one\
  \ needs to know.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'll be fine. I'll show them what's going on.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"And I'll watch the tannery while you're gone and tell anyone who\
  \ asks that you took a trip to Tamran to work out some deal.\"</p> \n    <p>Marra\
  \ gave him one final smile before turning to the south. She knew she could count\
  \ on him. In fact, she didn't know what she would have been able to do without him.\
  \ Especially considering how impossible it was to put the armor on by herself.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She squeezed her horse's sides and he jumped to a light canter. The sudden\
  \ motion made her lurch before she could compensate for the additional weight. Even\
  \ riding in armor was different. It took her several strides before she was able\
  \ to find the rhythm. She was just glad that she hadn't fallen off in front of Eron.\
  \ Otherwise, he might have physically dragged her back to the village and locked\
  \ her in her own tannery.</p> \n    <p>Once she felt like she was able to ride without\
  \ thinking about it too much, Marra tried to bring her attention to her surroundings.\
  \ It was difficult, more than she realized. She wasn't prepared for how much noise\
  \ the armor made when she rode. As she tried to listen for animals or other riders,\
  \ all she could hear was the jingle of her chainmail. Between that and the pounding\
  \ of her horse's hooves on the packed dirt, it was impossible to hear anything else.\
  \ So she focused on keeping to the center of the path.</p> \n    <p>She brought\
  \ her horse to a gentle trot and was just beginning to feel a little more comfortable\
  \ riding in her new gear when a voice rang out from the woods.</p> \n    <p>\"Halt\
  \ or die!\"</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
