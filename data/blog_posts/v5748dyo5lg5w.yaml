  description\">As a kid, I spent a good chunk of my weekend hours watching just about\
  \ anything that had swashbuckler goodness. Pirates, musketeers, and masked avengers\
  \ were among the first sparks that ignited my fledgling imagination. When we set\
  \ out to design the swashbuckler class our chief goal was to create a class that\
  \ was fun in that Errol Flynn sort of way, while creating enough room for the many\
  \ fine swashbuckler variants that have appeared in the many decades after <i>Captain\
  \ Blood</i>.</span></p> \n     <p>Even before playtesting began, we designed two\
  \ versions of the class. Like all of the classes appearing in the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a>, the swashbuckler is a hybrid class—a class with\
  \ mechanics and sometimes theme rooted in two existing classes—specifically a hybrid\
  \ of fighter and gunslinger. One of the pre-playtest version was heavy on fighter,\
  \ the second was heavy on gunslinger, but we soon discovered that the latter variant\
  \ was a lot more fun, as we reskinned grit to panache, and were able to create deeds\
  \ that were both useful and iconic...including the very fun derring-do feat that\
  \ grants an extra d6 boost with the possibility of exploding dice (if you roll a\
  \ 6 on that roll you gain another d6 boost) when using Acrobatics, Climb, Escape\
  \ Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim checks. </p> \n     <p>During the playtest, feedback\
  \ granted us a wealth of information that allowed us to fine-tune the class. We\
  \ wanted the class to be true to its roots, but to have enough room for players\
  \ to create their own take on this daring warrior classic. To this end, we made\
  \ it relatively easy to gain Dexterity modifier damage and benefit classes nifty\
  \ precise strike precision damage deed with a variety of weapons through the class\
  \ itself, by way of multiclassing, and through feats (try the Snake Style feat from\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a> with the precise strike\
  \ deed to get your swashbuckler/kung fu fusion on). </p> \n     <p>The playtest\
  \ also gave us feedback on which abilities were good, but not quite good enough\
  \ for a true swashbuckler. For example, in the original iteration of derring-do,\
  \ you had to spend panache and use the deed before you made the skill check. The\
  \ finally ability allows you to use it after making the check, but before the results\
  \ are revealed, making it more evocative and useful. </p> \n     <p>With the fine-tuning\
  \ of class abilities complete, we moved on to archetypes, which allowed us create\
  \ fun and interesting variants on the theme. In the book you’ll find (among others)\
  \ the flying blade (hint: the blade are flying, not the swashbuckler, unless the\
  \ wizard decides to do her a solid), the mysterious avenger (so you can make your\
  \ own flavor of Zorro), and the picaroon (for those of you who like a little bang-bang\
  \ alongside your flashing blade). Add this to the various combat and panache feats\
  \ along with magic items tailor made for the swashbuckler, and you will find a lot\
  \ of options to make exactly the swashbuckler that you always wanted to play.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Needless to say, if you like your heroes with light armor, a sharp rapier,\
  \ an even shaper wit, and more than a few tricks up your sleeve, we think you’re\
  \ going to enjoy the swashbuckler at least as much as we enjoyed designing her.</p>\
