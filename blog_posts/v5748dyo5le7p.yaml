  \   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Adventure Paths are the staple item here at\
  \ Paizo. Since the inception of Pathfinder Society Organized Play, some people have\
  \ wanted to play the Adventure Paths and receive credit for their Pathfinder Society\
  \ characters. This is one of the few bullet-list items I have been trying to figure\
  \ out since I arrived 15 months ago. The release of the Shattered Star Adventure\
  \ Path and its close ties to the Pathfinder Society made it even more imperative\
  \ that we find a way to include Adventure Paths in sanctioned Organized Play. We\
  \ feel it's the right thing to do, both from a business perspective and as a way\
  \ of making even more material available for event organizers and players who've\
  \ gone through what we already produced and are chomping at the bit for more.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Over the past few months, we have dedicated a large percentage of our\
  \ weekly Pathfinder Society meetings to make sure we have the best formula for as\
  \ seamless a fit as possible in sanctioning Adventure Paths. We could not find an\
  \ easy solution to allow play through an entire Adventure Path, or to easily port\
  \ a character in and out of a specific volume of an Adventure Path. With the feedback\
  \ of our Venture-Officers, we think we have a system that can appeal to the widest\
  \ audience. </p> \n    <p>The solution we've landed on is treating one section of\
  \ a Pathfinder Adventure Path volume like a module. It would generally be played\
  \ over one to three sessions, and grant 3 XP, 4 PP, and a level-dependent amount\
  \ of gp. An example you will find on the first Chronicle sheet is from the first\
  \ installment of Rise of the Runelords, <i>Burnt Offerings</i>. When you play through\
  \ areas <b>C1</b> through <b>E10</b> of Thistletop, your GM may assign you the Chronicle\
  \ sheet for <i>Burnt Offerings</i>.</p> \n    <p>If possible, all players must use\
  \ an existing Pathfinder Society character (without modification) within 1 level\
  \ of the starting level of the sanctioned content from a Pathfinder Adventure Path.\
  \ In the example used above for <i>Burnt Offerings,</i> you would use a 3rd-, 4th-,\
  \ or 5th-level character.</p> \n    <p>For Adventure Path content below 9th level,\
  \ if you do not have a character in the correct level range, you may use a Pathfinder\
  \ Society <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/playerResources\">pregenerated character</a>\
  \ or the Iconics found in the <i>NPC Codex</i>. If you play a 1st-level pregenerated\
  \ character, you may apply the credit from that character to a newly created character\
  \ of your very own, with the gp gained reduced to 1,398 gp (or 699 gp for slow advancement\
  \ track characters). If you play a non-1st-level pregenerated character, you may\
  \ apply the credit to your character as soon as she reaches the level of the pregenerated\
  \ character played. Equipment listed on the pregenerated character sheet may only\
  \ be sold to clear conditions, such as death, during the play of the module and\
  \ any remaining wealth does not carry over at the end of the module.</p> \n    <p>Alternatively,\
  \ if you are participating in a Pathfinder Adventure Path with an ongoing home group\
  \ undertaking the entire campaign, you may receive credit for playing the sanctioned\
  \ portions of the adventure as if you had played a pregenerated character. In this\
  \ case, GMs running the Adventure Path are not bound to the rules of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play campaign when running the campaign or the sanctioned portion\
  \ of the adventure. Pathfinder Society characters and characters from an ongoing\
  \ Adventure Path campaign may not play in the same adventure.</p> \n    <p>If a\
  \ character dies and is brought back to life, the GM must determine the rewards\
  \ for that character. The minimum possible reward is 0 gp, 1 XP, and 1 PP on the\
  \ medium advancement track or 0 gp, 1/2 XP, and 1/2 PP on the slow advancement track.\
  \ If a character participates in more than two-thirds of the sanctioned content\
  \ of an Adventure Path, she should receive the full rewards. GMs and active players\
  \ are encouraged to hasten the return of any characters waiting to be raised from\
  \ the dead.</p> \n    <p>Players who do not complete each game session earn 1/3\
  \ fewer gp, 1 fewer XP, and 1 fewer Prestige Point for each session missed. This\
  \ also applies to players who join later sessions; they receive 1/3 fewer gp, 1\
  \ fewer XP, and 1 fewer Prestige Point for each session missed. In both cases, players\
  \ earn a minimum of 1/3 gp, 1 XP, and 1 Prestige Point.</p> \n    <p>As always,\
  \ each player may receive credit for each sanctioned Adventure Path volume once\
  \ as a player and once as a GM, in either order. Players must accept Chronicle sheets\
  \ for their characters the first time they play any sanctioned content. A player\
  \ may replay a sanctioned Adventure Path at the GM’s discretion, but the player\
  \ may not receive more than one Chronicle sheet per adventure. The only exception\
  \ is Tier 1–2 sanctioned Adventure Path content. A player may only play a Tier 1–\
  2 sanctioned Adventure Path for credit once with a 2nd-level character, but may\
  \ use additional 1st-level characters to replay the same content for credit.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Since sanctioned Adventure Paths can be multi-session events, a Pathfinder\
  \ Society character may not be used in other Pathfinder Society events until the\
  \ character receives a Chronicle sheet for the Adventure Path volume. GMs are advised\
  \ to work with players who miss the final session of the module or AP in order for\
  \ those players to receive their Chronicle sheets.</p> \n    <p>The data entry system\
  \ has already been updated to include all 10 of the current sanctioned Adventure\
  \ Path volumes. Data is entered into our reporting system in the same manner as\
  \ sanctioned modules. You receive credit toward GM stars the same as sanctioned\
  \ modules.</p> \n    <p>The <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play, Version\
  \ 4.3</i>, scheduled for release next month, will update Chapter 6 with all info\
  \ about sanctioned Adventure Paths and how they work within Pathfinder Society.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Initially, we are only sanctioning <i>Rise of the Runelords Anniversary\
  \ Edition</i> and Shattered Star Adventure Paths. If those are well received, we\
  \ will consider sanctioning other Adventure Paths in the future. You can find the\
  \ rules for running these in Pathfinder Society Organized Play and the Chronicle\
  \ sheets on their respective product pages.</p> \n    <p>We are excited with the\
  \ solution that this not only expands normal Pathfinder Society play options, but\
  \ also increases play opportunities past 12th level. We hope that this will also\
  \ allow players who enjoy our Adventure Paths, but have not yet experienced Pathfinder\
  \ Society, to give our organized play a try.</p> \n    <p>We understand there are\
  \ a lot of very strong opinions among the player base about whether we should sanction\
  \ Adventure Paths and how they should be implemented. We value your opinions and\
  \ look forward to reading your thoughts about the exciting new play options we have\
  \ introduced today. With your input, we can make Pathfinder Society better for all.</p>\
