  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 12, 2011</p> \n   <p>About a month ago I\
  \ was punished... er.., I mean rewarded with the task of answering questions about\
  \ combat maneuvers in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The blog was so well received\
  \ that I quickly promised to do another one in short order. Well, projects flew\
  \ by, and I got pulled away, and short order dragged out into weeks, but now I'm\
  \ back, and here to answer more pressing questions about combat maneuvers.</p>\n\
  \   <p> </p>\n   <p>Ready?</p>\n   <p> </p>\n  </blockquote> \n  <div align=\"right\"\

  \   </table>\n  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Question:</b>\
  \ <i>What kind of attacks can you make while you are being grappled? Specifically,\
  \ if I'm being grappled, can I forgo escaping the grapple to make a full-attack\
  \ action with a natural, unarmed attack, or attack with light weapon, getting any\
  \ and all iterative attacks if possible with that action? </i></p>\n    <p></p>\n\
  \   </blockquote> \n   <p>Yes. Furthermore, you don't even have to make these attacks\
  \ against the creature grappling you. While do suffer the normal â€“2 penalties on\
  \ attack rolls while grappled, and you are limited in the types of attacks you can\
  \ make, you gain all the normal attack rolls such an action would normally give\
  \ you against any creature within your reach.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>If you're\
  \ the one grappling the creature, you can also make your normal attacks, but realize\
  \ that this ends the grapple. Most of the time you're better off selecting the grapple\
  \ option that allows you to deal damage to your target as a single unarmed attack,\
  \ natural attack, or an attack with a light weapon. While you do not get more damage\
  \ potential based on any iterative attacks, you do not have to make an attack roll.\
  \ The damage is automatic with the successful grapple check. And let's face it;\
  \ if you're performing this maneuver, chances are you're pretty good at it.</p>\n\
  \   <p> </p>\n   <p>Lastly, while it should go without saying, keep in mind that\
  \ attacks of opportunity are not possible while you are grappled, unless you have\
  \ some feat or other effect that specifically allows them in that condition.</p>\n\
  \   <p> </p>\n   <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Question: </b><i>Both the bull rush and\
  \ drag combat maneuvers say that you have to move the foe in a straight line either\
  \ forward or backward, depending on the combat maneuver you are performing. What\
  \ exactly does that mean if the person performing the maneuver is moving diagonally?</i></p>\n\
  \    <p></p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>When one of these maneuvers tells you to\
  \ move a foe forward or backward in a straight line, start by placing a point in\
  \ the middle of your space and make a line to the center of your target's space.\
  \ Then extend that line in the direction you are trying to move your foe. If you\
  \ succeed in performing the maneuver you can move your foe into any square that\
  \ line crosses, depending on how much movement your check grants you.</p>\n   <p>\
  \ </p>\n   <p>In the case of a bull rush, if you do not move into the square your\
  \ foe occupied, and you move that creature more than 5 feet, you cannot reposition\
  \ this line based on the opponent's new location. The bull rush continues to follow\
  \ the original line. But if you do move into a new space as part of the maneuver\
  \ and then continue to move your foe, you can reposition the line of movement each\
  \ time you change the location of your space, granting you more options when it\
  \ comes to your foe's final positioning.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>When adjudicating\
  \ the movement of larger creatures, this system may create movement that seems out\
  \ of the ordinary or conceptually improbable. Your GM has final discretion when\
  \ determining what squares you can bull rush or drag a creature into or out of.</p>\n\
