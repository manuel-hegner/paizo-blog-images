  \ itemprop=\"description\">This month, Pathfinder fans can get their hands on the\
  \ adventure that kicks off the <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/returnOfTheRunelords\"\
  >Return of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>â€”<a href=\"/products/btpya1r8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-133-Secrets-of-Roderics-Cove\"\
  ><i>Secrets of Roderic's Cove</i></a>! I asked on Twitter what folks would like\
  \ to see in a blog about this adventure, and a number of people wanted to know more\
  \ about the writing process and more behind the scenes things. So, here y'all go!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>After working on various parts of the Adventure Path line for over 6\
  \ years, I finally got my name on the front cover! I'd been given the option before,\
  \ but it seemed like every time the opportunity came up the timing just wasn't right.\
  \ I didn't want to take on a big project and not be able to deliver on time. I still\
  \ had plenty on my plate, but kicking off an Adventure Path was too tempting to\
  \ refuse. I also enjoy writing low-level adventures, so that was another factor\
  \ that led me to jump on this.</p> \n    <p>James had some basic ideas of what he\
  \ wanted this adventure to accomplish, and rather than us using the usual outlining\
  \ process, we pretty much just talked things through, and I kept him updated on\
  \ where the story was going, getting feedback and bouncing ideas off of him.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Writing Adventure Path adventures is tough. While I've written plenty\
  \ of things since I first started freelancing, this adventure is the longest single\
  \ project I've ever written. I stressed trying to pull it all together and hit my\
  \ deadline (which I didn't), and at the end of it all I had overwritten by more\
  \ than 7,000 words. Trimming it down was easier than I expected, though. I had another\
  \ level in a dungeon that was a little more than 5,000 words by itself and it wasn't\
  \ 100% necessary to the plot, so... yoink! To the floor with you! The rest was just\
  \ cleaning up some things, connecting the dots, and trimming down a few encounters.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <br><i>Illustration by Nikolai Ostertag</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>I\
  \ enjoyed getting to flesh out the town of Roderic's Cove, as well. There were only\
  \ a few sentences on the place, so I got to really breathe some life into it. I\
  \ like making small towns and their inhabitants, and really enjoy linking everyone\
  \ together to make a place seem realistic and dynamic all while giving PCs fun characters\
  \ to interact with.</p> \n    <p>This adventure is somewhat of a sandbox, and it\
  \ provides a wide range of encounters and places to explore. Not every challenge\
  \ is best dealt with through violence, so the PCs can find different solutions to\
  \ their problems. While the adventure kicks off the bigger plot of the campaign,\
  \ it is also self-contained and could easily serve as a standalone adventure with\
  \ minimal work on the GM's part.</p> \n    <p>I hope that everyone who reads or\
  \ plays <i>Secrets of Roderic's Cove</i> enjoys themselves. Get ready to take down\
  \ those runelords!</p> \n    <p>Adam Daigle<br> <i>Managing Developer</i></p> \n\
