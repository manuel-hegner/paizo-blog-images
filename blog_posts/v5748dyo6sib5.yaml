  \ to everyone. I’m Nath (Anathema), the project coordinator for Foundry Virtual\
  \ Tabletop (Foundry VTT). I’m joined by Viviane (Cora), who leads content development\
  \ on our Pathfinder products. Some of you might remember our discussion of that\
  \ development process in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7j?Pathfinder-Bestiary-Token-Pack-for-Foundry-VTT\"\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <p>It’s incredible to think that it has only been a year\
  \ since we announced our partnership with Paizo and released the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eap\"\
  >Beginner Box</a> as the first of several pieces of Pathfinder content for Foundry\
  \ VTT. With each release, we set ourselves a very high bar on quality and it’s thanks\
  \ to our partnership with Paizo and the hard work of everyone involved that we have\
  \ been so successful. Words cannot express how grateful we are for the outpouring\
  \ of appreciation and support from the community with each release, and we hope\
  \ to continue meeting or exceeding your expectations with Kingmaker’s forthcoming\
  \ release. </p> \n      <p>What sometimes goes unnoticed is the other group contributing\
  \ to this partnership, one equally deserving of praise and thanks. While the Pathfinder\
  \ content for Foundry VTT is developed in-house by us, or by Sigil Services on behalf\
  \ of Paizo, the world-class implementation of the underlying game system which we\
  \ all rely on is entirely produced and maintained—free of charge—by a passionate\
  \ group of fans. The Pathfinder Second Edition Volunteer Development Team have been\
  \ hard at work supporting Pathfinder for Foundry VTT’s entire existence, and we\
  \ want to take </p>\n      <p>this opportunity to spotlight their great work. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>As a quick note: last year, the team led the community in raising more\
  \ than $10,000 for the Extra Life charity. If you’d like to contribute to their\
  \ ongoing charity efforts, please check out their <a href=\"https://www.extra-life.org/team/63664\"\
  >team page</a> and donate! </p> \n      <p>So, who are the volunteer developers?\
  \ According to the game system’s open-source repository, 184 people have directly\
  \ contributed to the project since its inception. We’ve invited some of the core\
  \ members of the team to introduce themselves, talk about their work on the system,\
  \ and give the community a peek behind the curtain at all that goes into creating\
  \ and maintaining a tool that powers so many peoples’ games every single week.</p>\
  \ \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"70%\">\n      </center> \n      <h3>Tim (TMun)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Hi everyone, I’m Tim. I’m presently the volunteer project coordinator\
  \ for the Pathfinder Second Edition system on Foundry VTT. As the public face of\
  \ the volunteers, my role is to be the point of contact for Foundry, Paizo, and\
  \ other commercial interests with the volunteer base. I also set the overall guidance\
  \ for the system. My most important job is being the arbiter of how rules are to\
  \ be implemented if there is disagreement within the development team. I will also\
  \ likely become a five-glyph Pathfinder Society GM during FoundryCon. All 150 of\
  \ my table credits will have been earned using Foundry VTT!</p> \n      <p>I originally\
  \ started working on the system when Foundry VTT went into open beta at the start\
  \ of the pandemic. I had randomly picked up a Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rule\
  \ Book at a local charity thrift shop for $5 and it seemed like it was meant to\
  \ be. I pretty much immediately fell in love with the game. My first contribution\
  \ to the Pathfinder Second Edition VTT system was data entry—starting with the Iconics,\
  \ as I wanted to introduce some friends to the system. Over time, I took on bigger\
  \ and bigger tasks, most notably a marathon session over two and a half days to\
  \ get all the Advanced Player’s Guide in, and a three-month project to input all\
  \ the missing Pathfinder Society scenario NPCs. When the team grew to the point\
  \ where some organization was required, I was ‘elected’ by the other developers\
  \ to take over coordinating the project. As for why I do it? Giving back to a community\
  \ is very important to me—especially because, in a lot of cases, the work I shared\
  \ was work I was going to do anyway. Why not let everyone benefit from the effort?</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The thing I’m most proud of is the community that we’ve built. It took\
  \ a lot of effort to coordinate with Paizo, but I think everyone is glad that we\
  \ have. The commercial products that have come out so far show the power that Foundry\
  \ brings to the virtual tabletop realm and the exceptional nature of the Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition system. I think the best illustration of our community’s strength\
  \ has been the charity fundraising. Very early in the project, people began asking\
  \ us to set up a Patreon or to accept donations. We deliberated and made a conscious\
  \ decision that that was a bad idea—money makes things hard, especially with an\
  \ open-source project. Instead, we decided to ask people to donate that money to\
  \ charity on behalf of the project. Initially, it was toward food banks—at the start\
  \ of the pandemic that was the greatest need. Then we moved on to animal shelters\
  \ toward the end of the pandemic as people could no longer handle their “pandemic\
  \ pets.” Most recently, we supported <a href=\"https://www.extra-life.org/team/63664\"\
  >Extra Life</a>, as Paizo had a super team that we could join as part of the larger\
  \ community. I am privileged to be able to say that, last year, the community raised\
  \ over $10,000 for Extra Life and the Children’s Miracle Network of hospitals!</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Viviane (Cora) </h3> \n      <p>Hello again! That’s right,\
  \ I’m here too! Even before I worked for Foundry, I was busy supporting the system's\
  \ development efforts as their community manager.</p> \n      <p>I first got involved\
  \ in the project several years ago, when I decided to look into what it would take\
  \ to submit some minor corrections to the creatures in the Age of Ashes adventure\
  \ path. I didn't know the first thing about software development at the time, but\
  \ with some help from the other volunteers, I was able to send in my first merge\
  \ request. Since then, I've continued to sporadically submit minor updates to the\
  \ system data, and I also maintain a module called <a href=\"https://github.com/silvative/pf2e-exploration-effects\"\
  >PF2E Exploration Effects</a>. Along the way, I learned a great deal about programming,\
  \ and about modding Foundry VTT specifically. Unlike the other awesome people here,\
  \ however, my direct contributions to the system have always been minor.</p> \n\
  \      <p>As the team's grown over the years, keeping it organized has become more\
  \ and more of a monumental task. Some community members like Tikael and Shandyan\
  \ have worked hard to maintain wikis, style-guides, and other documentation to help\
  \ users and developers keep track of it all. Others spend a lot of time in community\
  \ spaces, offering support and troubleshooting assistance to anyone who needs it.\
  \ That's where I got my start! At the time, aside from a single channel on the [Foundry\
  \ VTT Community Discord](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt) server, there was no \"\
  officially\" designated location specifically for Pathfinder Second Edition community\
  \ engagement and discussion. I decided to help remedy that by spinning up a <a href=\"\
  https://discord.com/invite/foundryvtt\">Discord server</a> to serve double purpose\
  \ as a community hangout and a place for staging development efforts. By managing\
  \ channels and roles, moderating discussions, writing blog posts, and otherwise\
  \ engaging with the community, I hope to allow the programmers to get their work\
  \ done as smoothly as possible.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Richard (stwlam)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Hi all, I am Richard and am known in the Foundry VTT community as the\
  \ Shark That Walks Like a Man (“stwlam” for short). I help coordinate development\
  \ of the code infrastructure of the system. My path to this role began during the\
  \ height of COVID-19 through helping a friend who was GMing a different game for\
  \ the platform, by implementing some features he desired for his campaign. When\
  \ that was done, my attention turned to what I really wanted to play: Pathfinder!</p>\

  \      </div> \n      <p>My contributions to the project were initially small and\
  \ targeted: adding and improving fundamental game mechanics I personally wanted\
  \ to make use of as a player. This grew significantly over time; in the last two\
  \ years I’ve had my hands in just about everything, but my primary focus has been\
  \ on implementing rules for “things that happen on a map,” such as vision in areas\
  \ of darkness and flanking during combat. My role as a volunteer development coordinator\
  \ also has me reviewing and merging in new features, improvements, and bug fixes\
  \ from our community contributors, who number close to 200 individuals since mid-2020.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Carlos (Supe)</h3> \n      <p>Hello internet, my name\
  \ is Carlos Fernandez—sometimes referred to as Supe—and I'm one of the developers\
  \ and maintainers of the Pathfinder Second Edition implementation for Foundry VTT.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Around 2 years ago, I started playing Pathfinder and my group settled\
  \ on Foundry VTT more or less from the start. Even at that time, it was one of the\
  \ best implementations of Pathfinder on a VTT, but it did lack quite a number of\
  \ features we take for granted today and I saw a chance to work on some of that\
  \ thanks to the open nature of the platform.</p> \n      <p>I started with a module,\
  \ a type of optional add-on in the Foundry VTT ecosystem, to add support for persistent\
  \ damage. After that, I started adding features and fixing bugs in the main system\
  \ itself. One thing led to another and now I'm one of the core contributors of the\
  \ system.</p> \n      <p>As for my role, I add new features, fix bugs, and help\
  \ prioritize what to add. Currently, I’m working on improving support for afflictions\
  \ (such as poison and diseases). I’ve also been contracted by Foundry to work on\
  \ some new features for the Kingmaker Adventure Path. Look forward to it!</p> \n\
  \      <br> \n      <h3>Kevin (fryguy)</h3> \n      <p>I’m Kevin and I’m most well-known\
  \ as the creator of “PDF to Foundry,” a module which takes in a published Paizo\
  \ adventure PDF, converts the assets (such as text and images), and loads those\
  \ assets into a Foundry VTT world, populating it with journals, scenes and actors.\
  \ With the creation of the amazing quality adventures that are now sold on the Paizo\
  \ store, I have taken a break from adding recent adventures because they cannot\
  \ compete with the quality of the ones that are being sold.</p> \n      <p>I was\
  \ one of the earliest contributors to the Pathfinder Second Edition implementation\
  \ for Foundry VTT, with one of the first pull requests merged back in October of\
  \ 2019, only a few months after the creation of the repository. Over the years,\
  \ I have implemented several big features, such as the held/worn/stowed tracking\
  \ for items, and the ability score builder, but most of my time is spent on “PDF\
  \ to Foundry.”</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/ae38c650-afe0-4970-af25-79a3e4e2a3ce/Screenshot%202023-05-10%20164042.jpg\"\

  \    </div> \n      <h3>Ian (Tikael)</h3> \n      <p>Hi everyone, I’m Ian. Most\
  \ people in the community know me as Tikael. I’m one of the data entry coordinators\
  \ for the Pathfinder Second Edition system on Foundry VTT, and I normally handle\
  \ adding and reviewing new automation on our ever-growing compendiums. </p> \n \
  \     <p>When we took our tabletop game online in early 2020 I had plenty of downtime\
  \ and nothing to fill it with. I decided to spend some of that time learning how\
  \ the Foundry VTT system worked and helping to fill in gaps in the data entry, most\
  \ notably the Paizo blog content, including the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh63\"\
  >April fools monsters</a>. As I became more proficient with the system and its data\
  \ entry, I began to make small scripts to make my life easier, which have morphed\
  \ into our current set of tools to speed up our data entry for the system. I’ve\
  \ also made or collaborated on more than a dozen modules for Foundry, including\
  \ automation helpers like the PF2E Companion Compendia and implementations of third-party\
  \ content like Hopefinder or the Pnoll ancestry. I’ve also enjoyed helping third-party\
  \ creators get their own content into Foundry and have tried to make the process\
  \ of learning how to do it as painless as possible.</p> \n      <p>Playing Pathfinder\
  \ is my hobby, and the Pathfinder community has been one I’ve been a part of since\
  \ 2009. Helping coordinate data entry for the system has given me a way to give\
  \ back to that community but it’s also had some great fringe benefits. I’ve been\
  \ able to work on premium content for Foundry like the premium adventure path modules\
  \ and the Battlezoo modules by Roll for Combat. It’s also given me a chance to work\
  \ alongside this great team and learn from them. I can confidently say that I am\
  \ a better programmer now than I was 3 years ago, and that the growth in my skills\
  \ as a dev comes almost entirely from my experience working on this team.</p> \n\
  \      <br> \n      <h3>Ian (Spartan)</h3> \n      <p>Hi everyone, I’m (also) Ian!\
  \ I go by SpartanCPA in the Pathfinder Second Edition Foundry community, and I’\
  m also one of the data entry coordinators. These days though, I might be more known\
  \ for the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eat?FoundryVTT-Pathfinder-2E-Tokens-Bestiary\"\
  >Bestiary Token Pack</a>, available on the Paizo website. I also create the tokens\
  \ for the Sigil APs, so if you plan to or have been enjoying the quality premium\
  \ content released for Pathfinder Second Edition on Foundry VTT, you’ve likely seen\
  \ my token work. </p> \n      <p>I started working on the system implementation\
  \ in February of 2021 and I immediately got started on making the NPC actors nicer\
  \ to use. Like Tikael said above, that eventually opened up into work for Battlezoo,\
  \ Foundry, and Sigil on premium products. I hope everyone continues to enjoy the\
  \ system. I can personally attest that a lot of people work very hard to make it\
  \ as good as it is.</p> \n      <br> \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"70%\"\
  >\n      </center> \n      <h2>Common Questions</h2> \n      <details> <summary><b>Are\
  \ there any big plans the PF2e dev team are working on?</b></summary> \n       <p>Development\
  \ is always ongoing, and anyone is free to work on any functionality they’d like\
  \ to see. There are no deadlines or due dates, but some of the bigger goals being\
  \ chipped away at are expanded support for afflictions, and general improvements\
  \ to the UI</p> \n      </details> \n      <br> \n      <details> <summary><b>How\
  \ will the Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster affect the Foundry VTT system?</b></summary>\
  \ \n       <p>We look forward to the changes that are coming and are very interested\
  \ to see what they actually are. From a development perspective, we do not expect\
  \ the remaster to be a substantial challenge to support.</p> \n       <p>In cases\
  \ where rules have been updated, we will treat the remaster the same way we treat\
  \ any official errata. This means that changes will be made to keep the system in\
  \ line with the most up-to-date version of Pathfinder Second Edition. Anyone who\
  \ would like to is welcome to stay on an older version of the system, but we do\
  \ not otherwise plan to include both old and new versions of the same content side\
  \ by side—it would add an unnecessary maintenance burden. We recognize that this\
  \ may not make everyone happy, but in some cases, it would double the work of the\
  \ developers during each and every future update.</p> \n       <p>In places where\
  \ content simply is not reprinted, the decision is a little different. We don't\
  \ want to remove officially published creatures or spells if they are still compatible\
  \ with the system's rules. For example, we do not plan to remove creatures from\
  \ the Bestiary just because they were not included in the Monster Core book. However,\
  \ it's possible that mechanical changes in the remaster- such as the removal of\
  \ alignment- will still affect those creatures.</p> \n       <p>At this time, it\
  \ is really hard to try and commit to anything, as we don't have the exact contents\
  \ of the remastered books available. However, our contacts at Foundry and Paizo\
  \ have promised to get us early copies of the rules as soon as they're available,\
  \ and we are very excited to see what the remaster means for Pathfinder.</p> \n\
  \      </details> \n      <br> \n      <details> <summary><b>How can I contribute\
  \ to the system?</b></summary> \n       <p>As a volunteer project, we're reliant\
  \ on people like you to get new releases out! We’re in especially dire need of Typescript\
  \ programmers. If you’re even remotely interested, please do consider paying us\
  \ a visit. All of our organization and planning happens on our community <a href=\"\
  https://discord.com/invite/foundryvtt\">Discord server</a>, which is also the best\
  \ place to come and chat with us.</p> \n       <p>We recognize that participating\
  \ in development can be daunting, and so we do what we can to make it easier. Our\
  \ Discord server has dedicated channels for answering development questions, and\
  \ there are also some useful resources on our <a href=\"https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\"\
  >Wiki</a>.</p> \n      </details> \n      <br> \n      <details> <summary><b>What’\
  s next for Foundry VTT in terms of premium content?</b></summary> \n       <p>The\
  \ Stolen Fate adventure path is releasing every month, which we definitely recommend.\
  \ I hear there’s a cool official Harrow Deck module you can use it with, too? </p>\
  \ \n       <p>On Foundry’s side, work continues on Kingmaker, as well as one or\
  \ two other unannounced projects. We’re hoping to have more to discuss at PaizoCon,\
  \ so please be sure to join us there on Friday, May 26th at 4:00 PM PDT.</p> \n\
