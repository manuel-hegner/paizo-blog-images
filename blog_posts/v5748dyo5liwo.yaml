  \ 2016 has come and gone, and if you went to your friendly local game store or happened\
  \ to stop by the ACG area at Origins, you got up close and personal with the Prince\

  \ you can see, our friend Tup is a pyromaniac. He's got a sorcerer-style spell blast\
  \ (but he's a goblin, so it's expensive). And if he uses a spell to trigger that\
  \ blast, he gets a random spell from the box in return. In play, this results in\
  \ a somewhat... <i>erratic</i> spellcaster, and with a hand size of 6, Tup tends\
  \ to take it on the chin.</p> \n    <p>He's also surprisingly personable, for a\
  \ goblin. When he was exiled from Thistletop, Tup wandered the countryside, stealing\
  \ random clothes off farmhouse clotheslines to ward off the cold. He now tells people\
  \ that he's a really short leper, and for some reason people buy it. Probably because\
  \ he's so helpful. He really wants to help you. For me, Tup will forever be played\
  \ by Mike Selinker, eagerly asking every time I attempt a check if he can help.\
  \ I said yes once, and he grinned wider than I've ever seen him grin. Then he wiped\
  \ out my hand.</p> \n    <p>But I <i>did</i> succeed at the check, so... all's well?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Tup has a role card showcasing two of his many ceremonial titles, as\
  \ well as a cohort: his trusty riding sheep Deliverance. And by \"trusty\" I mean\
  \ \"startled by just about anything and prone to tactical withdrawal.\"</p> \n \

  \   <p>Tup the Bale-flame is all about the burning. Want help? He'll burn you. If\
  \ he needs help, he'll burn himself. You got fire stuff? When you're done with it,\
  \ he can still use it. Tup's a conservationist arsonist. There are even options\
  \ for players who want to take Tup in a friendlier direction: he can take feats\
  \ to reduce Fire damage dealt to himself and to others. The design team might look\
  \ down its nose at you a little bit—after all, goblins are meant to live gloriously\
  \ short lives and meet gloriously brutal ends—but we're a full-service organization.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8x6n\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game subscribers</a>\
  \ will be getting Tup for free (along with a fistful of other promo cards!) with\
  \ the first Mummy's Mask shipment in October. Not an ACG subscriber, or just can't\
  \ wait? He'll also be available for purchase starting July 1 <a href=\"/products/btpy9nbv\"\
  >right here at paizo.com</a>, and we'll be bringing him to Gen Con as well.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I hope you've enjoyed this taste of Tup, because July might as well be\
  \ named Goblin Month! Next week, you'll get a preview of one of the two July Adventure\
  \ Card Game Class Deck releases: the <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"><em>Goblins\
  \ Fight! Deck</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>Until next time, Pathfinders!</p> \n    <p>Tanis\
