  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >The savage warrior whose warcries and fury inspire his allies to great deeds. The\
  \ respected keeper of epics and histories of a bloody and glorious past. Even before\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a>, the skald\
  \ lurked in our collective fantasies, though he often manifested in different ways.\
  \ A multiclass character here, an archetype there. But there was never really a\
  \ dedicated class that captured the fury and power of the skald, until now. The\
  \ skald was an easy fit for Golarion. I mean, we have the Ulfen, whose very language\
  \ is called Skald, and there's plenty of other cultures where it's easy to see these\
  \ fearsome and mighty battle leaders replacing the more refined and classical bard\
  \ of the Lem variety.</span></p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1129-SkaldHerald.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1129-SkaldHerald_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Ramon Puasa Jr\n     </div> \n     <p>So the first\
  \ playtest version unleashed the skald to all of you (and me!) to test out in your\
  \ games. Right from the start, the skald was able to cast bard spells, wield any\
  \ weapon he wants, and inspire a barbarian rage in his allies, even giving them\
  \ the exciting boost of all the skald's rage powers. Visions of entire parties surrounded\
  \ by spirit totems or clawed and pouncing soared through our collective heads, and\
  \ the playtest began! But right away, all the playtesters started running into the\
  \ same problem—the number of characters who desired the rage's advantages enough\
  \ to be willing to risk the fatigue at the end were often too few, especially compared\
  \ to how many could benefit from the bard. Not only the spellcasters, who couldn't\
  \ cast their spells, were balking at the invitation to a rage-filled bloodbath.\
  \ The archers, who needed adaptive bows to gain anything from the Strength but feared\
  \ the -3 penalty to hit they would take from fatigue, were also quick to pass.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>So the skald went back to the forge and began hammering himself a new\
  \ set of tools while singing epics sadly to himself. And he emerged for round 2\
  \ of the playtest with a shiny new way to give out rage. Now party members could\
  \ accept the rage on a round by round basis, with no commitment to staying enraged\
  \ the entire song and without the fear of fatigue when the rage ends. Suddenly,\
  \ the siren's call of fury became too much, and there were tales of archers (and\
  \ even occasionally primary spellcasters eager for the rage powers' benefits) accepting\
  \ the skald's offer to lose themselves to their primal instincts for a while. But\
  \ still, the playtesters forged onward, providing feedback on the versatility of\
  \ the skald and asking for more variety in the skald's song choices.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>And the final version delivers! When it comes to both performances and skills,\
  \ he is more versatile than ever before. He has three new song choices, the most\
  \ metal of which is clearly his 14th level song of the fallen. You see, the trouble\
  \ with being the support character is that sometimes the bad guys decide to kill\
  \ your allies and you don't really have anyone to support. Too often inconvenienced\
  \ by the deaths of his comrades, the skald has come up with a workaround, powered\
  \ by the sheer fury of his raging song. He can revive any number of allies with\
  \ this song, though if he's keeping the entire alive as deathless einherjar, he's\
  \ going to run out of rounds of performance fairly quickly (since it costs a number\
  \ of rounds of performance equal to the number of revived allies). And the allies\
  \ are staggered, so they're not at their peak performance—but hey, it's a better\
  \ way of killing time than waiting in line in the Boneyard!</p> \n     <p>But that's\
  \ not the end of the skald's drum solo! Have you ever thought that it wasn't fair\
  \ how linnorms have death curses but not your character. I mean, you put lots of\
  \ time into building that character. That darn NPC deserves to suffer for killing\
  \ Lord Kickass III. With the new skald rage powers (which anyone with rage powers\
  \ can select), you too can bestow a horrific death curse on your enemies.</p> \n\
  \     <p>And there's archetypes too. The fated champion stares down the future without\
  \ fear for what it might hold, with fate-twisting powers and supernatural insights.\
  \ The herald of the horn forms an arcane bond with a horn (potentially an enormous\
  \ horn nearly as big as his own body, according to the art). He doesn't compose\
  \ elaborate kennings; he blows that sucker and crazy things happen! The spell warrior\
  \ sends his rage into your weapon instead of your head, and his very spells are\
  \ a weapon with which to do battle with those of enemy spellcasters. And the totemic\
  \ skald channels the power of a totem animal into himself and his allies; you want\
  \ to put the \"bear\" in ber-serker? Play this guy!</p> \n     <p>So to recap: If\
  \ bards are your classical virtuosos who channel the tales of the mythical Orpheus,\
  \ skalds are their metal cousins who channel the tales of poets with attitudes more\
  \ like the Norse Bragi, who threatens to decapitate people who insult his courage.\
  \ If that's what you've been waiting for since forever, once you get your hands\
  \ on the book, roar in visceral triumph as you paw your way immediately to page\
  \ 49 and feast upon the skald in all his glory.</p> \n     <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
