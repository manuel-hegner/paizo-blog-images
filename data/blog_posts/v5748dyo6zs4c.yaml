  \ in a July far away, I let you all know about Paizo’s plans to improve its tech\
  \ infrastructure. While that has been a slower process than any of us have liked,\
  \ here's an update on where we’re at and where we’re going.</p>\n      <h2>The Foundation</h2>\n\
  \      <p>Paizo began work on modernizing its backend infrastructure in 2023 to\
  \ allow us easier and faster access to the boring business analytics and insights\
  \ that we’ve historically had to assemble by spreadsheets over the years. When completed,\
  \ it will greatly improve our ability to ensure that we have the right products\
  \ available at the right time and in the right quantities for our customers, send\
  \ more timely reports to our business partners, and overall streamline internal\
  \ processes that are stretched across several systems.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ and sitting around different consoles\"></a>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n     \
  \ <p>Part of this core infrastructure is the rollout of a new warehouse management\
  \ system. The first part of this is live today, with orders to our hobby and book\
  \ distributors being picked and shipped from the new system. The next step will\
  \ be when the new ecommerce store goes live. From your side, you’ll see faster and\
  \ more accurate orders and trackable shipping details. In addition, Paizo won’t\
  \ need to shut down for a week every year to do inventory. Instead, the system has\
  \ us run mini-inventories every week throughout the year.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \      <br>\n      <h2>The New Store</h2>\n      <p>The team is hard at work on\
  \ a brand-new store experience, reorganizing the entirety of Paizo’s products into\
  \ more coherent and easier-to-find locations, extracting data from our legacy system,\
  \ and more.</p>\n      <p>Much of what you see on Paizo.com today has been built\
  \ internally over the years and is affectionately known as Presto. Back when Paizo\
  \ began, ecommerce software to handle subscriptions didn’t really exist, so we built\
  \ our own solution from the ground up. Presto currently does the heavy lifting for\
  \ the ecommerce store, forums, shipping and package tracking, and more. It also\
  \ provides a variety of reports that the finance team imports into their accounting\
  \ software, the sales team uses to track sales, etc.</p>\n      <p>The new store\
  \ will replace all of the shopping pages on the site: product pages, category pages,\
  \ and store landing pages–including the subscriptions landing page, providing a\
  \ more modern, streamlined shopping experience for customers, including a single-page\
  \ checkout!</p>\n      <p>Areas that will stay the same for now will be the forums,\
  \ Organized Play reporting, the blog, and a dozen or so landing pages. Here’s a\
  \ brief rundown of the new things you’ll see at the Paizo Store when it launches.</p>\n\
  \      <h3>Paizo Plus Loyalty Program</h3>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5bc7486e-4ada-48dd-92b9-012f0332b847/PaizoPlusLoyaltyProgram.png\"\

  \ width=\"800px\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"Join Paizo Plus, Yotpo banner\"\
  ></a>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/subscriptions\"\
  >Paizo Advantage</a> is our current loyalty program. It gives subscribers access\
  \ to free Pathfinder Society or Starfinder Society releases if you subscribe to\
  \ 4 lines and both if you subscribe to 6 or more. It also grants 15% off most of\
  \ your Paizo.com purchases.</p>\n      <p>The new Paizo Plus program will give you\
  \ more choices for your rewards. You’ll earn virtual gold on your purchases that\
  \ you can use for things like coupons for society scenarios, $5–20 off coupons,\
  \ and the top tier will grant 15% off all your purchases just like today. You’ll\
  \ also be able to earn gold by writing reviews of your purchases, by referring your\
  \ friends to the new store, by following Paizo on social media, by joining the new\
  \ program, and on your birthday!</p>\n      <p>There will be changes vs. how we\
  \ do things today, of course, but we’ve worked hard to create a program that lets\
  \ you keep what you want from today’s loyalty program and expand it out to something\
  \ even better. We’ll be sharing more details on the new Paizo Plus in an upcoming\
  \ blog.</p>\n      <h3>Library</h3>\n      <p>We’re very excited to be unveiling\
  \ a new file library when the new store launches as well. This replaces your Digital\
  \ Content portal that exists today and offers more streamlined search capabilities\
  \ using filters and a search box, a new look, the ability to download multiple products\
  \ at once, and more! Everything you currently have in your current Digital Content\
  \ will migrate to the new Library.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \   <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5af28d9c-daa1-4546-82e8-b6e9efb9ca19/BC_DigitalLibrary.png\"\

  \ width=\"800px\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"Screenshot of the New Digital Library\
  \ UI\"></a>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h3>New Payment Methods</h3>\n    \
  \  <p>We will be expanding payment methods with the new store. Here are a few that\
  \ we are targeting for launch.</p>\n      <p><strong>Credit Cards</strong>: American\
  \ Express, Aura, Diners Club, Discover, ELO, Hipercard, JCB, Mada, Mastercard, RuPay\
  \ (India), UnionPay, Visa.</p>\n      <p><strong>Digital Wallets</strong>: Apple\
  \ Pay, Google Pay, PayPal.</p>\n      <p><strong>Online Bank Transfers</strong>:\
  \ Sofort</p>\n      <p>Some of these payment methods are region specific (like Hipercard\
  \ for Brazil or RuPay for India), so you won’t be flooded with options when you\
  \ checkout. Not all payment methods can be used for subscription payments because\
  \ some providers don’t allow recurring payments, but you’ll see available options\
  \ as you go through checkout for subscriptions.</p>\n      <h3>New Subscription\
  \ Portal</h3>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6404f0a2-c4b3-4d49-8d5b-e5907dabc4b9/BC_SubscriptionPortal.png\"\

  \ width=\"800px\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"a screenshot of the new paizo store\
  \ subscription UO\"></a>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Starting with the launch\
  \ of the new store, subscribers will be able to manage their subscriptions directly\
  \ from their dashboard. This will allow you to skip, cancel, or suspend a subscription\
  \ without the need to contact the customer service team.</p>\n      <p>Subscribers\
  \ will be able to continue to “sidecart” products into their upcoming subscriptions\
  \ through what’s now called combined shipping. This is largely the same functionality\
  \ we have now, but the process for adding items to your sidecart are a bit different.\
  \ We’ll cover that in a future blog.</p>\n      <h3>So… When?</h3>\n      <p>The\
  \ date for this launch was written during the Gap and is currently lost to human\
  \ knowledge. Triune predicts that the date is soon(™), but I dare not tempt the\
  \ machine gods by uttering a specific date.</p>\n      <p>Stay tuned!</p>\n    \
