  \ Retrospective—Year 4 (2006)</h1> \n   <h2>Battling Headwinds</h2> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Thursday, June 28, 2012</p> \n   <p class=\"tiny\" align=\"center\"><i>This\
  \ blog entry is the fifth in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\">Click here to read the first\
  \ installment</a>.</i></p> \n   <p>Paizo was optimistic heading into 2006. The previous\
  \ year, we had worked very hard to build a business that could not only stand on\
  \ its own, but also be innovative. We weren't out of the woods yet, but we could\
  \ at least see the edge of the forest drawing ever nearer.</p> \n   <p>As I mentioned\
  \ in the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldhf?Paizo-Publishings-10th-Anniversary\"\
  >2005 blog</a>, we had decided on a six-point strategy to build a more solid foundation\
  \ for Paizo. We dubbed 2006 a \"retrenching year,\" since our plan was to continue\
  \ to build upon the strategy of 2005. Many projects started in 2005 saw their fruition\
  \ in 2006, and we started projects in 2006 that wouldn't see the light of day until\
  \ 2007. Here's how we attacked each of our six key strategies in 2006.</p> \n  \
  \ <ul>\n    <li>Expand our subscriber base for <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ while continuing to make those businesses more efficient.</li>\n   </ul> \n  \
  \ <p><i>Dragon</i> Magazine had a bit of a retrenching year too, since it was hitting\
  \ its stride and things were looking good on the subscription and circulation fronts.\
  \ Both the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and Core Beliefs regular series saw new installments,\
  \ and the much beloved Campaign Classics themed issue returned with all-new features\
  \ for every published D&amp;D campaign setting! But the big news was <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy7ywd\"><i>Dragon</i> 344</a>, which celebrated the 30th Anniversary\
  \ of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. For this special occasion, we asked Gary Gygax to write\
  \ a new Gord the Rogue short story, Bruce Heard to revive his Voyage of the Princess\
  \ Ark column, and Ed Greenwood to pen another Wizards Three short story installment.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><i>Dungeon</i> Magazine continued its string of amazing Adventure Path\
  \ installments, finishing up the Age of Worms in <a href=\"/products/btpy7yi3\"\
  ><i>Dungeon</i> 135</a> with a battle against old Kyuss himself. Then in November,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy7zv0\"><i>Dungeon</i> 139</a> launched the Savage Tide\
  \ Adventure Path with a return to Sasserine, a town first introduced in the Shackled\
  \ City AP. In that same issue, we added to the infamous Maure Castle with a Rob\
  \ Kuntz–penned adventure, \"The Greater Halls.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> The cover for the Savage Tide Adventure Path Player's\
  \ Guide.\n   </div> \n   <p>But the biggest news for <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ came behind the scenes, and was something that the public wouldn't learn about\
  \ until early 2007. In April, I'd asked Wizards of the Coast for a meeting with\
  \ the following agenda:</p> \n   <p>We would like to discuss the long-term relationship\
  \ with Wizards for <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines beyond the term of\
  \ the current contract. Paizo has plans to spend money and resources to build up\
  \ the magazines, but since these expenditures have a long window of monetary recovery,\
  \ we are hoping to come to a consensus on how our two companies plan to work together\
  \ on the magazines past next March.</p> \n   <p>Our license for publishing <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i> was due to expire in March 2007, and this meeting would be\
  \ the first step toward negotiating a renewal of that contract. It took a while\
  \ to find a time that fit everyone's schedule, and we finally had to resort to meeting\
  \ by phone rather than face-to-face. On May 30, 2006 at 2 pm, I had a conference\
  \ call with Wizards, and it was during this call that they let me know that they\
  \ had other plans for <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>; they wouldn't be renewing\
  \ the license for the magazines. I personally don't remember much of my reaction,\
  \ but after the call, I brought Erik in to my office and told him the news, tears\
  \ streaming down my face. (Read Erik's recollection of this major event below.)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We always knew that this might be a possibility. That was, after all,\
  \ one of the main reasons we had been building the other parts of our business:\
  \ so we wouldn't be caught unprepared if the unthinkable were to happen. But I don't\
  \ think any of us ever really thought that this was much more than a remote possibility.\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> were finally firing on all cylinders and were\
  \ enjoying critical acclaim that hadn't been seen in years. So this news struck\
  \ us to the core. In one meeting, the last large chunk of the company that we started\
  \ not quite four years before was going away. We were numb. How the heck were we\
  \ going to cope with this? Frankly, it seemed impossible at the time.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ have to give Wizards of the Coast a lot of praise for how they handled the end\
  \ of the license. Contractually, they only needed to deliver notice of non-renewal\
  \ by the end of December 2006; without the extra seven months' notice they chose\
  \ to give us, I'm not sure that Paizo could have survived. Wizards also granted\
  \ our request to extend the license through August 2007 so that we could finish\
  \ up the Savage Tide adventure path. This gave us quite a bit of time to figure\
  \ out how we were going to cope with the end of the magazines. It would have been\
  \ very easy for WotC to have handled this in a way which would have effectively\
  \ left Paizo for dead—all they would have had to do was follow the letter of the\
  \ contract. Instead, they treated us like the valued partner we had been, giving\
  \ us the ability to both plan and execute a strategy for survival. For that, I will\
  \ always be thankful.</p> \n   <p>The news caused us to kick our plans for other\
  \ product lines into a higher gear. In fact, before even two hours had elapsed,\
  \ we'd already scheduled an offsite meeting at my house. We knew that the key to\
  \ our survival beyond <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> hinged upon our mastery of\
  \ creating adventures, particularly Adventure Paths. So we started to plan for what\
  \ would end up being one of the most shocking announcements in the history or RPG\
  \ gaming... but that tale will have to wait until the 2007 blog!</p> \n   <p>One\
  \ decision we had made earlier in the year ended up helping us quite a bit in this\
  \ transition. As I mentioned in a previous blog, sending renewal notices for subscriptions\
  \ is a very expensive task that eats up a lot of a sub's profits, so we were trying\
  \ to encourage more and more folks to manage their subscriptions on paizo.com. In\
  \ April, we had unveiled month-to-month subscriptions, which allowed subscribers\
  \ to be charged for an issue each month instead of prepaying for an entire year—\
  to our knowledge, this was virtually unprecedented in the magazine industry. Sending\
  \ magazines until the subscriber told us to stop meant that we didn't have to send\
  \ renewal notices, and that was helping our bottom line. We had no idea at the time,\
  \ of course, but this system would be our salvation the following year—it meant\
  \ that there were were a lot fewer people we'd have to refund subscription money\
  \ to when the magazines ended. For the first part of 2006, month-to-month subs were\
  \ offered in addition to the usual 1-, 2-, and 3-year subscriptions; soon after\
  \ we learned that the magazines were ending, we discontinued the long-term subs\
  \ and added a new six-month sub.</p> \n   <p>There were also some major personnel\
  \ changes for the two magazines. With the departure of Keith Strohm early in the\
  \ year, Erik Mona was promoted to Publisher. Erik and I have been working together\
  \ since the late 1990s, and have developed a very similar mindset when it comes\
  \ to the business end of things: perfect for somebody overseeing the entire publishing\
  \ arm of Paizo. In June, we promoted James Jacobs to Editor-in-Chief of <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ Magazine, filling the spot Erik vacated. Erik remained the Editor-in-Chief of\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> Magazine until it's end.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n   \

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> The final Dungeons &amp; Dragons book published by\
  \ Paizo, The Art of Dragon Magazine Hardcover.\n   </div> \n   <ul>\n    <li>Expand\
  \ our license for <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> to create official non-magazine\
  \ Dungeons &amp; Dragons products—especially those we could base on in-demand but\
  \ out-of-print material from the magazines.</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p>Following up\
  \ on the success of the Shackled City hardcover in 2005, we managed to publish two\
  \ more D&amp;D products before our license expired. The first was Monster Ecologies,\
  \ a compilation of the very popular article series from <i>Dragon</i> Magazine that\
  \ found its genesis all the way back in <i>Dragon</i> 72 in 1983! We compiled the\
  \ best of these articles and updated them for D&amp;D 3.5. The final D&amp;D book\
  \ we published was the Art of <i>Dragon</i> hardcover, released on the last day\
  \ of 2006! <i>Dragon</i> had launched the careers of many of the most famous fantasy\
  \ artists, and this book was a celebration of that artwork. We spent hours poring\
  \ through old magazines and looking through boxes of old transparencies from TSR,\
  \ culling the best and putting them into a book beautifully designed by Sean Glenn.\
  \ All in all, a fitting end to our licensed D&amp;D book line.</p> \n   <ul>\n \
  \   <li>Create generic gaming accessories that would appeal to our RPG customers.</li>\n\
  \   </ul> \n   <p>At the end of 2005, we had just launched the GameMastery Map Pack\
  \ line. 2006 saw five more packs: Graveyard, Countryside, Fortress, Haunted Mansion,\
  \ and Dungeon Chambers.</p> \n   <p>In March, we launched the GameMastery Item Card\
  \ line with <a href=\"/products/btpy7m6a\">Item Pack One</a>. Item Cards were designed\
  \ to provide GMs with beautiful full-color cards to represent the loot they give\
  \ out in games. Players could then use the cards to keep track of their inventory\
  \ rather than scribbling things on their character sheet. Later in the year, we\
  \ released two expansions in booster pack form. Hero's Hoard and Relics of War turned\
  \ out to be very divisive, with many customers complaining about the randomization\
  \ and collectibility of the cards, including special foils. Paizo had gone with\
  \ the booster format in response to some discussions with our distributors, but\
  \ it almost killed the Item Card line. (In 2007, we went back to the non-random\
  \ deck format that continues today; there have been 19 total releases in this line\
  \ so far.)</p> \n   <p>In December, we also released the <a href=\"/products/btpy7fiz\"\
  >GameMastery Campaign Workbook</a>, a pocket-sized journal for GMs to record a wide\
  \ variety of information for their campaigns. Unfortunately, the glue used to bind\
  \ the book was faulty, and we had to to initiate Paizo's first (and so far, only)\
  \ major product return program, exchanging glue-bound copies with new spiral-bound\
  \ copies early the following year.</p> \n   <p>Though this doesn't adhere to the\
  \ \"generic\" part of the goal, we released a line of unpainted metal miniatures\
  \ for Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign. Erik has a longstanding friendship with Monte,\
  \ having played in his Ptolus campaign for years. When Monte came by the office\
  \ to show off some of the incredible artwork going into his magnum opus, we just\
  \ had to jump in and make miniatures for it! We had already started making metal\
  \ minis as part of the Compleat Encounter line, so it was fairly easy to get the\
  \ Ptolus line going. We made twenty miniatures over the next year or so, and when\
  \ we started to create our own campaign setting in 2007, Monte allowed us to add\
  \ the figures from this line to the minis we already had from the Compleat Encounter\
  \ line, creating the <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/pathfinderChroniclesMiniatures\
  \ \">Pathfinder Chronicles Miniatures</a> line. (Two of the Ptolus miniatures were\
  \ deemed too different to be included in our setting: the Arcane Pistoleer and the\
  \ Leonine Warrior.)</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>Expand Paizo into areas of gaming outside\
  \ of RPGs that would spread our risk around.</li>\n   </ul> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> The first Titanic product, Kill Doctor Lucky.\n  \
  \ </div> \n   <p>As I mentioned in the 2005 blog, we'd started Titanic Games, a\
  \ sister company to Paizo, partly as a means to publish some of the more successful\
  \ Cheapass Games in high-quality editions. The first product from Titanic was the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8ar0\">Kill Doctor Lucky Deluxe Edition</a>, released\
  \ in October 2006. With a full-color fold-out board of the Lucky mansion and painted\
  \ wooden tokens to represent the characters, it was an instant success, and continues\
  \ to sell well for us; it's now in its third printing! We also started work on a\
  \ couple other Titanic games that would appear in 2007.</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>Use\
  \ our strong position in the distribution chain to help other publishers get their\
  \ products into game stores, taking a bit off the top for our efforts.</li>\n  \
  \ </ul> \n   <p>We were fortunate to add several wonderful sales partners to our\
  \ roster in 2006, companies which we are still representing into the distribution\
  \ trade today!</p> \n   <p>In January, we added Cheapass Games to our distribution\
  \ efforts—a logical move due to the formation of Titanic Games. Instantly, Paizo's\
  \ catalog grew by more than 75 products.</p> \n   <p>We also joined up with Dead\
  \ Gentlemen Productions, the folks who created the critically acclaimed movie The\
  \ Gamers. As big fans of their movie, we were super excited to help get the DVD\
  \ into game stores around the world.</p> \n   <p>We'd met Steel Sqwire at Gen Con\
  \ that year, and we loved their Flip-Mats and their wire area-of-effect templates.\
  \ We started off simply distributing their products, but we eventually added them\
  \ to our own GameMastery line; to date, we've released 44 different Flip-Mats.</p>\

  \  <br> Paizo's 2006 Gen Con crew. We shared our booth with Looney Labs; they're\
  \ the folks in the white lab coats.\n   </div> \n   <p>At the end of the year, we\
  \ also started selling an accessory from Open Mind Games that also ended up becoming\
  \ a GameMastery staple: <a href=\"/products/btpy8bkr\">the Combat Pad</a>, which\
  \ revolutionized tracking initiative with an innovative write-on/wipe-off magnet\
  \ system.</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>Increase paizo.com sales by expanding the scope\
  \ of products available on the website through partnerships with other publishers,\
  \ who would in turn bring in new customers for us.</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p>The paizo.com\
  \ online store had a number of huge milestones in 2006, the biggest of which was\
  \ the addition of the old TSR PDFs. Because of our connection with WotC through\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>, Wizards was very open to letting us sell the\
  \ whole catalog of PDFs. This created a lot of buzz among our community, and the\
  \ cash flow was very welcome.</p> \n   <p>Our new web store manager, Phil Lacefield,\
  \ Jr scored us another D&amp;D coup—Milton Bradley's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fantasy\
  \ Adventure Board Game and its two expansions, Eternal Winter and Forbidden Forest!\
  \ This board game wasn't generally available in the United States, but Phil found\
  \ a source in the UK that let us bring these cool D&amp;D collectibles to folks\
  \ here in the US.</p> \n   <p>Products like these helped paizo.com sales nearly\
  \ double in 2006. This led to myself, Vic Wertz, and Jeff Alvarez augmenting the\
  \ warehouse crew as they fulfilled orders, especially during the Christmas season.</p>\

  \   <p>With all of the successes that we had in 2006, it should have been a year\
  \ of rejoicing; Jeff, Erik, Vic and myself had been keeping the cancellation of\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> to ourselves as the four of us planned out how\
  \ Paizo would survive this turn of events. Eventually, we could keep silent no longer\
  \ and we brought the rest of the employees up to speed. One of our biggest fears\
  \ was that we were going to lose a bunch of employees as they headed out to look\
  \ for more stable employment, but we needn't have worried: not a single employee\
  \ left the company once the cat was out of the bag, a true testament to the loyalty\
  \ and dedication of our staff.</p> \n   <p>By the end of the year, our plans were\
  \ in full swing, and I sent a long email to our lawyer asking him to look into trademark\
  \ registration for something called \"Pathfinder.\" But that's a story for next\
  \ year...</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Employees who started in 2006 (in order\

  \   <p>Lisa Stevens<br> <i>CEO</i></p> \n   <h2>Paizo 2006: Behind the Closed Door</h2>\
  \ \n   <p>As summer 2006 approached, I had plenty of reason to be optimistic about\
  \ the future. Paizo had (barely) survived the loss of <i>Star Wars Insider</i>,\
  \ <i>Amazing Stories</i>, and <i>Undefeated</i> magazines, but things on the Dungeons\
  \ &amp; Dragons front were considerably sunnier, or at least I thought so at the\
  \ time. For much of the previous year, then-publisher Keith Strohm had been warning\
  \ me that the tea leaves suggested we might soon become \"the <i>Dragon</i> and\
  \ <i>Dungeon</i> company,\" and while that represented a significant reduction in\
  \ the company's original scope, it did put the focus purely on magazines that were\
  \ under my personal control, and I felt confident that the teams working with me\
  \ on those magazines could handle a little adversity. We'd just completed a creative\
  \ relaunch and visual re-design of both magazines that was generating significant\
  \ good will with an approving audience, and I had big plans for the two magazines\
  \ I had read for virtually my entire life. To make things even more interesting,\
  \ Keith left the company to pursue a new relationship in Chicago, and I was promoted\
  \ from editor-in-chief to publisher of the whole company. I was eager to apply the\
  \ same improvement standards that we brought to the magazines to the entire company.\
  \ Our relationship with Wizards of the Coast was going strong, and I was ready to\
  \ make \"the <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>\" company a creative and financial\
  \ success.</p> \n   <p>Sure, we were approaching the end of the <i>Dragon</i> and\
  \ <i>Dungeon</i> licenses, too, but with the popular relaunches behind us, subscriptions\
  \ on the rise, and powerful wind in our sails from the Shackled City and Age of\
  \ Worms Adventure Paths, there seemed little reason for concern. In the five years\
  \ since we'd started the company, every single issue of both magazines had sailed\
  \ through approval meetings with our pals at Wizards of the Coast (in all that time,\
  \ the only final layout item they ever rejected was a single panel in a cartoon\
  \ strip), most of whom were former colleagues and personal friends. Heck, several\
  \ of them used to work in the periodicals department that eventually became Paizo,\
  \ or had left Paizo to rejoin the mothership, so going over there for business meetings\
  \ always seemed like a bit of a reunion. I was riding high in the early couple of\
  \ months of my publisher-hood, and although Paizo faced some clear challenges, I\
  \ had big plans for the future.</p> \n   <p>Unfortunately, Wizards of the Coast\
  \ had big plans for the future as well, and they didn't involve working with Paizo\
  \ Publishing. In fact, they didn't involve printed magazines at all. Much to my\
  \ surprise, our 2006 year of \"retrenchment\" and building on past successes was\
  \ about to become the most stressful year in the company's history, and one of the\
  \ biggest turning points for my own career.</p> \n   <p>A ratty old collection of\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> magazines stuffed in the back of a comic longbox I received as a\
  \ gift as a grade-schooler cemented my love of D&amp;D and inspired me to a lifelong\
  \ dream of editing <i>Dragon</i> magazine one day. From that point in about third\
  \ grade, virtually every academic and professional decision I made was aimed at\
  \ learning the necessary skills and making the right contacts to one day put me\
  \ in the editor-and-chief seat at <i>Dragon</i> magazine. My heroes were people\
  \ like Kim Mohan and Roger E. Moore, and I watched the careers of folks like Wolfgang\
  \ Baur and Dave Gross, studying them for patterns and paths others had taken to\
  \ the position I so desired. By 2006 I'd finally clawed my way into that role, the\
  \ culmination of more than 20 years of hard work and concentrated effort. I had\
  \ finally arrived, and my preference was to remain editor of <i>Dragon</i> as long\
  \ as humanly possible. I wanted it to be my career. I wanted to leave a lasting\
  \ mark on the magazine that had been such an important part of my life. For someone\
  \ who had lived so much of that life dedicated to a plan designed to get me to exactly\
  \ where I was, I hadn't really planned much about what might happen after <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ magazine.</p> \n   <p>That seemed like a solid strategy until the day in late\
  \ spring when Lisa Stevens called me into her office to discuss a phone call she'd\
  \ just had with the higher-ups at Wizards of the Coast. As soon as I saw the tears\
  \ streaking down her face, I suspected that the call had not gone quite as expected.\
  \ Lisa was in shock. Not only would Wizards not be renewing our license to create\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines, but they were going to cease publishing\
  \ the magazines entirely. There was some vague chat about Wizards wanting to start\
  \ a kind of online subscription program tied to their upcoming edition (something\
  \ they'd been very cagey about, and about which we'd only heard the barest of rumors\
  \ by this point), but the upshot was that in just a few months, the magazines as\
  \ printed products would be dead and buried.</p> \n   <p>And I was the one who would\
  \ get to shovel the grave dirt onto their corpses.</p> \n   <p>Not exactly the role\
  \ I had been prepping for since third grade. While Lisa's tears showed her human\
  \ concern for the business we had built and the employees she referred to as family,\
  \ I wasn't quite ready to think about any of those big-picture concerns, yet. I\
  \ was still fixated on the massive sense of rejection I felt from folks who had\
  \ been my coworkers at Wizards, and whom I still considered close friends. I was\
  \ worried about my own career, and about the fate of two pillars of D&amp;D that\
  \ had helped support the brand (and my own gaming hobby) for decades. I couldn't\
  \ even contemplate a world without <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines, even\
  \ as I had just been told that world was coming. Soon.</p> \n   <p>I don't remember\
  \ a lot of the details about that conversation in Lisa's office. I do remember numbly\
  \ wandering out of the building to take a quick walk to gather my thoughts. It was\
  \ a gorgeous day, and I'd lately been in the habit of taking a half-mile walk on\
  \ my lunch hour, so my slipping out must not have seemed odd to my co-workers, who\
  \ had no idea what had just transpired. I walked down Richards Road to an old abandoned\
  \ residential hospital that had a nice lawn behind it facing a gorgeous wall of\
  \ trees. I sat down on that lawn for a half-hour, going through the ramifications\
  \ of the day's news, and building a huge list of questions and next-steps in my\
  \ head.</p> \n   <p>What will happen to Paizo?<br> Will the members of the editorial\
  \ staff land on their feet if the company collapses?<br> How do we let them know?\
  \ When?<br> How in the world am I going to explain this to the readers?<br> How\
  \ can we end <i>Dungeon</i> magazine in the middle of the Savage Tide Adventure\
  \ Path?<br> Will the prisoners who send me mail every week blame me for canceling\
  \ the magazines?<br> Where do we go from here?</p> \n   <p>In the days and weeks\
  \ to come, a lot of those answers grew more and more clear. Paizo would go on. Once\
  \ we came up with the idea behind a \"monthly Adventure Path book\" (not yet called\
  \ Pathfinder), the management team resolved to chart a path to the company's survival\
  \ that kept every employee intact. We'd already experienced a bunch of layoffs,\
  \ and to transition the company into its new form in 2007, we'd need all hands on\
  \ deck. To their credit, Wizards of the Coast graciously extended our license by\
  \ a few months so we could bring the Savage Tide Adventure Path to its proper conclusion,\
  \ and even though it's fair to say things between the two companies were very awkward\
  \ for a while, everyone still remained friendly and cordial. I wrote a cover-my-ass\
  \ editorial directly to the prisoners, laying out their importance to the magazine,\
  \ lest I incur some unfortunate vendetta.</p> \n   <p>Telling the editorial staff\
  \ was the most difficult part of the transition for me. It took us several weeks,\
  \ perhaps even months, before we had our business plan for what would come next,\
  \ and in that time we decided not to tell the editorial staff about the potentially\
  \ fatal blow to the company (holding that secret for so long was probably the most\
  \ soul-warping experience of my life). We were worried that once the staff knew\
  \ the end was in sight, they might abandon ship for a more stable career somewhere\
  \ else (perhaps even at Wizards of the Coast). And we needed the staff focused on\
  \ the magazines if we were going to bring the Paizo Era to a close with the style\
  \ and care that we knew these magazines required.</p> \n   <p>So it was with a lot\
  \ of trepidation that I walked into the \"editorial pit\" and closed the door behind\
  \ me. That door had only closed once before, when I had to tell the staff about\
  \ the loss of <i>Amazing Stories</i> and <i>Undefeated</i> several months earlier,\
  \ and all knew it was a grim omen. Everyone gathered around the editors' cubes,\
  \ and I dropped the bomb as gently as I could. They had concerns and questions of\
  \ their own, it's fair to say, and everyone in that room could probably write an\
  \ essay as long as this one to explain what was going through their own minds upon\
  \ hearing the news. </p> \n   <p>I know what was going through my mind. \"You guys\
  \ are the best. The magazines are better now than they've ever been. And we're about\
  \ to make something even better together, to chart a new future for the company\
  \ where we will be masters of our own destiny. But you've got to stay at Paizo for\
  \ us to pull it off. Please don't leave. Please don't leave. Please don't leave.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Six years later, it seems almost silly that I was so concerned. The\
  \ vast majority of the folks in that room still work at Paizo today. James Jacobs,\
  \ Jason Bulmahn, Wesley Schneider, James Sutter, Sarah Robinson. That's basically\
  \ my editorial management team these days at Paizo, and they were all there that\
  \ day, all scared out of their minds, but all ready for what was right around the\
  \ corner. </p> \n   <p>These folks are among my best friends, and among the strongest\
  \ employees Paizo has ever had. Yes, I was worried about a life without <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines, but I was even more worried about a Paizo without\
  \ these pivotal employees. </p> \n   <p>They all stuck around, and they've all made\
  \ innumerable contributions to Paizo Publishing and the project that would eventually\
  \ become Pathfinder. I tend to think of that day \"behind the closed door\" as a\
  \ real bonding moment for the staff, and the first day of the new Paizo Publishing.</p>\
