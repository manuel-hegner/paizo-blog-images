  \ <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_ACG/comments/4645e0\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Last week on Reddit</a>, I alluded to our <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> design team helping Obsidian Entertainment with\
  \ its upcoming <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventures</a> game. If you haven't heard, it's a digital port of PACG, but with\
  \ a whole lot of new bells and whistles.</p> \n    <p>So, let me give you an idea\
  \ of what it's like to work on this awesome thing. First, the crew. Chad, Vic, and\
  \ I have been trading emails and phone calls with project lead Nathan Davis, designer\
  \ Dave Williams, user interface designer Andre Nguyen, and artist Lindsey Laney\
  \ for something like a year and a half now. They are freakin' sorcerers. They see\
  \ everything we've tried to create in paper form and manipulate it to be even better\
  \ in the digital world.</p> \n    <p>Gone is all the setup and teardown time, the\
  \ limitations on numbers of cards in the box, the trips to Ikea for new <a href=\"\
  http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/27534/\" target=\"_blank\">Kallaxes</a>\
  \ to fit the awkward thing in your game room. In are variable boons, dynamically\
  \ changing banes, and Andre's amazing animations. Rise of the Runelords feels brand\
  \ new again.</p> \n    <p>Here are some screenshots you'll like. Below is the map\
  \ for the Adventure Path. The star with the checkmark just south of Sandpoint shows\
  \ that I've completed the B scenarios, and the bright star to the north indicates\
  \ that I can take on adventure 1 in Sandpoint itself.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Follow the teal arrows. It's totally safe.</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>In each scenario, you'll also see a local map with all of the locations\
  \ you'll need to visit, like the Brigandoom! map below. And when you get to some\
  \ of those places, you'll see new art by Lindsey. For example, this is what the\
  \ City Gate looks like.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160223-Brigandoom.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Last one in, close the portcullis!</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Designing\
  \ for the Digital World</h2> \n    <p>Because the digital world sometimes has different\
  \ needs than the tabletop, we've been revisiting a lot of things in the game. For\
  \ example, here's Sajan's Drunken Master role.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160223-Sajan.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160223-Sajan_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Among the rejected power names: \"Buy Selinker a Mai Tai.\"\
  </i>\n    </div> \n    <p>You will note that Sajan has <i>named</i> powers with\
  \ the familiar checkboxes. I've explained before that we don't do that in the physical\
  \ card game because it would create legacy presumptions on the players' parts, and\
  \ it would also take up more precious space on what are already our most text-laden\
  \ cards. But Obsidian needs to be able to refer to those powers in shorthand during\
  \ the game. So Tanis brainstormed a whole bunch of names for these powers, Vic and\
  \ the RPG team played around with them, and then voila, all the Runelords powers—\
  every little checkbox—got a name.</p> \n    <p>Sometimes, they come to us with a\
  \ hard challenge that we need to resolve. For example, last week we spent a bunch\
  \ of time trying to figure out—again—how daggers and daggerlikes work. For the minutiae-uninitiated,\
  \ the card Dagger has this text: \"When playing another weapon, you may discard\
  \ this card to add 1d4 to your combat check.\" For us, that's simple. You play a\
  \ Greatsword, discard the Dagger, bingo-bango, +1d4.</p> \n    <p>For Obsidian,\
  \ it's not so simple. For them the question comes when your <i>first</i> weapon\
  \ is also a Dagger. Because then you can:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Reveal the first\
  \ Dagger</li> \n     <li>Discard the second Dagger</li> \n     <li>And since discarding\
  \ the second is \"playing another weapon,\" you can then discard the first.</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p>Which, y'know, is pretty much fine by me. You wanna toss two\
  \ cards for +2d4, go to it. That all makes sense because you, the human with the\
  \ cards, flips the card around and says \"I'm playing this Dagger.\"</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ in the Obsidian game, you click on cards to activate or deactivate them. So you\
  \ click on the first Dagger to reveal it, then you click on the second Dagger to\
  \ discard it, and then you click on the first Dagger to... wait a second. That first\
  \ Dagger is <i>already</i> clicked on. So now when you click on it again, you'd\
  \ be... <i>deactivating</i> the first Dagger? That's no good at all.</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ we got out the scalpels. After a dozen false starts, our man Keith came up with\
  \ this new wording: \"When you play another weapon for your combat check, you may\
  \ discard this card to add 1d4.\" Note the words \"for your combat check\" here.\
  \ There's a step where you play the card that sets the skill for your combat check.\
  \ That's only ever one card—in this case, the dagger you displayed at the start—\
  so playing the second dagger no longer allows you to play the first again. From\
  \ Rise of the Runelords through to the upcoming Gunslinger Class Deck, this change\
  \ would affect almost three dozen cards, so errata-ing them for the physical card\
  \ game would be both painful and pointless. So in the digital game, they'll work\
  \ ever so slightly differently. And everything will be fine.</p> \n    <p>No, check\
  \ that. Everything will be awesome.</p> \n    <h2>Like This. This is Awesome.</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Early in the process, Nathan came to me with a request for a tutorial\
  \ scenario. I said something like \"Dude, I have no idea what that is, so just write\
  \ one.\"</p> \n    <p>See, in a digital game, you don't need to learn the game from\
  \ a 32-page rulebook. Instead, you can learn how to play the game from the game\
  \ itself. But for that to work, you need a play sequence that is tuned for the particular\
  \ digital game. Since I'd empowered Nathan to make his own tutorial, I expected\
  \ I'd see something like what we created for Brigandoom! or the like. I figured\
  \ he'd just have Kyra and Merisiel beat up a bandit or three, and we'd be off to\
  \ the races.</p> \n    <p>And then these showed up.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Vancaskerkin—an ally and a henchman, respectively, in the Runelords set—who are\
  \ your <i>characters</i> in the tutorial. Orik's got his own special shield and\
  \ everything. And they're fun to have around. Here's some of Nathan's dialogue from\
  \ the tutorial.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Orik:</b> Bloody horse demon\
  \ thing! I hate monster cults!<br> <b>Ameiko:</b> Huh. More equine than expected!</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>I'll bet you can guess what they're fighting. In\
  \ the tutorial. The <i>tutorial</i>. Good luck with that.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
