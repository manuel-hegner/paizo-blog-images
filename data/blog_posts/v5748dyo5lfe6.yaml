  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Gabrielle Harbowy</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: Unexpected\
  \ Arrivals</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">Keren Rhinn, Knight of Ozem and Vigilant Defender of Lastwall, stood\
  \ sputtering in the doorway, her face turning fascinating shades of crimson.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Hello, darling!\" Zae looked up from her work to greet her favorite\
  \ human with a smile. \"Long day?\"</p> \n     <p>Keren had many talents, but the\
  \ one that impressed Zae most was her unnatural sense of timing. Without fail, Keren\
  \ <i>always</i> seemed to be able to walk in on a situation at the precise moment\
  \ that would confound, annoy, or disarm her the most. </p> \n     <p>Case in point:\
  \ there was a perfectly good explanation for the bloody, unconscious dog currently\
  \ staining the floorboards of Keren's kitchen. If the crusader had looked beyond\
  \ her initial confusion and anger, she would no doubt have seen Zae's surgical kit\
  \ by her side and the needle and suturing thread in the gnome's nimble hands. But\
  \ humans were quick to emote, and even quicker to jump to conclusions. It was one\
  \ of the things Zae loved about them, and about this one in particular.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Since Keren seemed lost for words, Zae took it upon herself to fill in the\
  \ conversational gap while she resumed her work. \"He followed me home,\" she said.\
  \ \"Can I keep him?\"</p> \n     <p>The hardened warrior made a strangled little\
  \ sound. That particular set to her jaw meant she was reciting her oath to herself.\
  \ Zae clicked her shiny bronze lip-ring quietly against her lower teeth and savored\
  \ the countdown in her head. 3...2...1...</p> \n     <p>\"You're lucky you're oathbound,\
  \ pixie,\" Keren said, right on cue. The oaths sworn by all who wished to be citizens\
  \ of Lastwall included a vow not to harm other oathbound residents. But Zae wasn't\
  \ afraid of real violence, even though Keren was significantly larger than her own\
  \ three-foot-three, and carried a sword that weighed more than Zae did. The use\
  \ of the pet name told Zae that she was already forgiven, even if only on some deep\
  \ subconscious level. Before Zae had taken the oaths to Vigil and Lastwall, it had\
  \ been, \"You're lucky you're cute.\" </p> \n     <p>She had it on assurance that\
  \ her oath had not robbed her of cuteness, so the update to Keren's ultimatum didn't\
  \ bother her in the slightest, especially when she accompanied it with some playful\
  \ epithet. When Keren was truly angry, she was cold and silent, and her hand twitched\
  \ for the weight of her sword hilt. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     \
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Keren.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Keren_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br>Keren fears no blade or magic, but family is a different\
  \ story.\n     </div> \n     <p>Zae thanked her by not squealing in delight at Keren's\
  \ predictability. For some reason, big, tough warriors didn't like being giggled\
  \ at. Even ones who thought you were cute.</p> \n     <p>Keren came to kneel by\
  \ Zae's side, stroking gentle fingers through the healer's indigo curls. She observed\
  \ a moment, then rose and stepped past the gnome to swing the kettle over the fire,\
  \ as if resigned to the fact that dog surgery in her kitchen wasn't the strangest\
  \ thing she was likely to encounter this week.</p> \n     <p>In fairness, it probably\
  \ wasn't.</p> \n     <p>\"Seriously.\" Zae knotted off the thread and snipped it\
  \ carefully. \"I want to keep him. He's obviously lost his person in battle, and\
  \ we've got good rapport. Just look at him.\" </p> \n     <p>\"<i>He's unconscious</i>,\"\
  \ Keren pointed out.</p> \n     <p>Zae grinned. \"But he wasn't unconscious when\
  \ I brought him here. He was wounded and scared, and he still nuzzled my hand and\
  \ followed me home. It's not like I'd have been able to carry him.\" </p> \n   \
  \  <p>Keren poured boiled water into a bowl and brought it to Zae's side, along\
  \ with some clean cloths. Zae poured in a packet of herbs, and together they washed\
  \ the blood from Zae's instruments. And, when the water had cooled a bit, from the\
  \ patient.</p> \n     <p>\"Maybe he thought you were a snack. He's a big one.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Zae laughed. \"I'm not very tasty.\"</p> \n     <p>Keren raised an\
  \ eyebrow, glancing at her sidelong.</p> \n     <p>\"All right, then: I'm not very\
  \ <i>filling</i>. Is that more accurate?\"</p> \n     <p>Under the dirt and blood,\
  \ the dog's coat was a gorgeous white, and he had a cute black nose. Zae had guessed\
  \ that he was a cold-weather sled dog from the shape of his ears and muzzle, his\
  \ barrel chest and sturdy legs, but now she was certain of it. And a gorgeous one,\
  \ at that. </p> \n     <p>\"So,\" Keren said. \"He was wounded on the front, and\
  \ you brought him here because it's closer than your infirmary—or your own kitchen?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Am I so predictable? I'll have to try harder. Oh! And I was hoping\
  \ you'd help me train him as a mount, once he's well.\" </p> \n     <p>\"And you\
  \ also promise you'll clean my floor?\"</p> \n     <p>Zae grinned. She had won.\
  \ \"Every drop.\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Zae typically\
  \ woke before Keren and took the small hours of the morning for her meditation and\
  \ prayer. Brigh had no temples in the city of Vigil, but Zae always kept a traveling\
  \ shrine with her. Polishing her treasured brass gears kept her hands busy and her\
  \ mind free. She had crafted a special gear with a feminine mask engraved on its\
  \ face, and she wore this on a leather string around her neck, using it to keep\
  \ her morning worship on track. She ticked her thumb down the teeth one at a time\
  \ as she prepared her spells for the day.</p> \n     <p>Warm breath washed across\
  \ her cheek, followed by a very large, very wet nose, and something hard and wet\
  \ landed in her lap. She opened her eyes into the dog's pale blue gaze. Something\
  \ in there shone with intelligence, but before she had time to contemplate it, he\
  \ dipped his muzzle to indicate the gift he'd just brought her. </p> \n     <p>Atop\
  \ her gears and polishing cloths sat a very well-chewed apple, most of its red skin\
  \ nearly gone, with a tooth pattern that suggested gnawing rather than eating. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Zae ruffled his rounded ears and scratched under his jaw with both her\
  \ hands. \"Good boy! Thank you!\" His tail started to wag at that. She suspected\
  \ the apple was thanks for healing him, and the gesture touched her. Presents stolen\
  \ from your host's kitchen were still presents, after all. It was the intent that\
  \ mattered. </p> \n     <p>She cleaned sweet juice from her gears and folded them\
  \ back into their pouch. It wasn't just the one apple, she noticed as she rose—\
  the entire basket of apples from the kitchen table had been systematically destroyed,\
  \ all over the floor she had just cleaned to spotlessness the night before. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You fierce apple-slayer,\" she praised the dog, giving his ears another\
  \ rub. \"You'd better help me clean this up, or Keren won't be pleased with us.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>As if the improbability of the situation had summoned her, there\
  \ was the crusader, rising from bed and padding barefooted toward the commotion.\
  \ She halted at the door, but for once, her words were quiet and unexpected.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"When did this come?\"</p> \n     <p>Zae turned to see beautifully\
  \ disheveled brown hair, a jade silk robe hanging askew to frame the lime-sized\
  \ metal medallion she always wore around her neck, and an ornately carved wooden\
  \ box cradled in Keren's strong hands. The crusader's face was unusually ashen.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>She hadn't even noticed the apples. Zae wasn't sure whether to\
  \ be relieved or concerned. She supposed that rushing to clean them up would only\
  \ draw attention to them, so she left the dog to finish off his prey and approached\
  \ Keren instead, pulling out a chair for her.</p> \n     <p>\"Oh! Right. It came\
  \ yesterday, in the middle of dog surgery. A messenger brought it. I put it aside\
  \ where it wouldn't get bled on, and then I must have forgotten all about it. Is\
  \ it important?\"</p> \n     <p>Keren sank into the chair, letting her hands ease\
  \ onto the table, the box still between them. \"It means my father is dead.\" She\
  \ exhaled a slow, shuddering breath, staring at the box as if it was a nightmare\
  \ made solid. \"Do we have anything stronger than ale?\"</p> \n     <p>Knowing Keren's\
  \ high tolerance for drink, Zae took the liberty of choosing a supplement from her\
  \ healer's kit instead of the pantry. Soothe syrup was a bit cloying on its own,\
  \ but it added a pleasant flavor to strong tea. \"Your father? You've never spoken\
  \ of him.\" She rolled a light coating of syrup around the inside of an earthenware\
  \ mug, then filled it with the tea she'd already brewed with her breakfast.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"He retired from the front, and was teaching up at the War College.\
  \ I joined the Knights of Ozem in his footsteps, but Vigil is all we have in common\
  \ now. We haven't spoken in a while.\"</p> \n     <p>Zae set the tea in front of\
  \ Keren and climbed up into the chair beside her. The dog sprawled on the floor\
  \ under the table, gnawing on a stray shoe and soaking up comfort from their proximity.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Keren turned the box toward Zae and cupped her hands around the\
  \ tea, clinging to it and bringing the mug to her face to inhale the steam. Like\
  \ Keren's medallion, the box was carved with painstakingly detailed castles and\
  \ clouds and rolling waves. The seam of its lid disappeared into the carvings, and\
  \ its hinges looked to be internal. On one side, two round concave impressions stared\
  \ side by side like abstract eyes. </p> \n     <p>\"It's beautiful,\" Zae said,\
  \ because she felt she ought to say something. Loss didn't visit the knight's face\
  \ often, and it looked interesting on her. While Zae supposed she shouldn't just\
  \ watch the mesmerizing sight of Keren, half dressed and drinking her tea, she wasn't\
  \ sure how to address that sentiment. Most of what she knew about human family structures\
  \ had been gleaned from her patients. Which was to say, she knew that family was\
  \ where you got your corpse sent when you died. </p> \n     <p>Keren tugged the\
  \ medallion on its leather thong around her throat. It was etched with the same\
  \ sorts of carvings, giving it an abstract quality unless one examined it closely,\
  \ as Zae often had. But she had always assumed it to be a religious thing, like\
  \ her own gear pendant, and never thought to ask about its purpose. \"This fits\
  \ in one of the locks. Ennis has the other key. If we force it, we destroy the contents.\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Zae darted her hands innocently back to her lap. \"Ennis?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"My brother.\" Keren released the medallion and returned her attention\
  \ to her tea. With half the brew gone, she already seemed to have shed her anxious\
  \ edge. Now she was merely subdued. \"He's up at the Worldwound. Or was. Iomedae\
  \ keeps her own counsel where he's concerned—he could be demon food and fertilizer\
  \ twice over by now, for all I know.\"</p> \n     <p>Zae sat silently for a few\
  \ moments, integrating this new information into her mental portrait of Keren. \"\
  Do you know what's in the box?\"</p> \n     <p>\"No idea. He said it was our inheritance,\
  \ but that's all he said, and that was years ago. Before Ennis left for the Worldwound\
  \ and split the family apart.\"</p> \n     <p>Zae frowned, puzzled. \"But aren't\
  \ a lot of the Worldwound crusaders from here?\"</p> \n     <p>Keren made a dismissive\
  \ noise into her mug, then set it down, empty. She sighed. \"Fine for other families,\
  \ but not for mine. My father disowned Ennis—he raised us here, to fight <i>this</i>\
  \ fight. He said our purpose was to defend Lastwall against the return of the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant. Ennis said his purpose was to defend against the greatest threat, <i>wherever</i>\
  \ it might be.\" She nudged the box, picked it up, and shook it gently. Nothing\
  \ rattled. \"I was finished with my father, for being finished with Ennis. Father\
  \ put cause before kin. I say you have no cause when you forget the people you're\
  \ fighting for. But there's no reasoning with my father.\"</p> \n     <p>Zae rested\
  \ her hand on Keren's back, feeling the shift of powerful muscle and the faint shudder\
  \ of emotion. \"And now you have his inheritance, all the same. Do you still want\
  \ it?\"</p> \n     <p>Keren slumped forward, sighing, until her forehead rested\
  \ on the wood with a faint thud. She lifted it an inch and thudded it down again.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Zae gently sifted her fingers through Keren's hair.\"We're going to\
  \ the Worldwound, aren't we?\" </p> \n     <p>Keren turned to look at Zae, amber\
  \ eyes calm from the tea. \"We?\" She leaned sideways until her cheek rested on\
  \ Zae's shoulder. </p> \n     <p>Zae brushed unruly brown hair aside and kissed\
  \ her head. \"Of course I'm coming with you. Me and Appleslayer both.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Oh, pixie. You don't have to come.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It'll be an adventure,\"\
  \ Zae said. Under the table, the dog's tail wagged an eager beat against the floor.</p>\
