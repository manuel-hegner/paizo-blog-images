              <p>by Richard Lee Byers</p> 
              <h2>Chapter Four: The Master's Table</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">As more and more sunlight reached the canyon floor, Dron made a steadily increasing effort to keep to the shade. Sometimes, even though raising his maimed hand made his face twist with pain, he used it to shield his eyes.</span></p> 
               <p>"I take it," Kagur said, "that ghouls generally hole up during the day."</p> 
               <p>Dron grunted.</p> 
               <p>"Does that mean all your fellows will be resting in the same cave where the demon is holding Eovath?"</p> 
               <p>The ghoul hesitated, as though pondering whether he dared lie or might gain any benefit from doing so. At length, he said, "No. Slaves not rest where Master rests. Might touch Master's things. Might eat Master's prisoner."</p> 
               <p>If that was true—and to Kagur's ears, it sounded true—it might be a bit of good fortune. Maybe she could at least make her way to Eovath without fighting any more living corpses.</p> 
               <p>That was assuming the demon wasn't leading its minions against her at this very moment, but she doubted such was the case. The fiend had taken Eovath first because it deemed a frost giant the greater prize. At the moment, it probably wanted to concentrate on turning him undead, not hunting down the human who remained at liberty. It would assume tonight was time enough for that.</p> 
               <p>Scowling, Kagur vowed to prove that this time, it was the demon that was underestimating its foe.</p> 
               <p>As the morning wore on, she and Dron began to encounter the unnatural features that figured in campfire tales of Red Rune Canyon. Patches of the walls had turned the hue of blood or obsidian black. In some places, the discolorations had cracked open, and bubbling crimson sludge oozed forth like pus from infected wounds, stinking of sulfur.</p> 
               <p>At another spot, the creek took on a rusty hue, and the vague suggestion of anguished faces formed and dissolved in the flow. Glimpsing them made Kagur's skin crawl, yet she felt an urge to go on peering, a sense that if she could only make them out clearly, she'd learn something she urgently needed to know.</p> 
               <p>But she also realized that fascination was irrational and the result of some malign influence. She jerked her head up and spotted a pallid something moving partway up the left wall.</p> 
               <p>A ghoul perched on a ledge with an outcropping above it for shade, an upward jut of stone at the edge of the drop providing cover like a parapet. Kagur could only see the top of it, and wouldn't have been able to discern anything at all if it hadn't straightened up to blow the curling ram's horn bugle it was raising to its lips.</p> 
               <p>She snatched an arrow from her quiver, drew, and loosed all in an instant. There was no time to aim properly. Luck was with her, though, and the shaft still punched into the ghoul's head. The creature lost its grip on the ram's horn and flopped back out of sight. The trumpet fell banging and bouncing down the wall.</p> 
               <p>Kagur waited a moment to see if the ghoul would reappear. When it didn't, she pivoted and aimed a second arrow at Dron's face. Her guide flinched.</p> 
               <p>"You said," Kagur gritted, "ghouls hide in their lairs when the sun is up. You didn't say there would still be lookouts posted along the way."</p> 
               <p>"Not know! New! Watching for you!"</p> 
               <p>Kagur took a breath and let it out slowly. "Maybe. Anyway, you and I are going to keep an eye out for any more of them. You want to spot them before they spot us. Because—"</p> 
               <p>"If they give signal, you kill me!" Dron snarled. "Understand!"</p> 
               <p>As it turned out, they didn't come across another sentry. Maybe the one watcher had been a casual afterthought. Perhaps the demon assumed the tangled layout of the gorges would be enough to keep Kagur wandering lost and confused until nightfall. As it might have, had she not pressed a guide into service.</p> 
               <p>The sun had passed its zenith when said guide halted and waved his maimed hand at the spot ahead where the gorge they were following forked into two. "Go right. See cave."</p> 
               <p>"We'll see it together."</p> 
               <p>"Master say, 'Kill,' I kill. He say, I do—no matter what."</p> 
               <p>Kagur frowned. She was reluctant to dispense with Dron's assistance. But she also saw the sense in not taking him any farther if the demon could compel him to attack her even against his will. Maimed he might be, but he still had fangs and claws.</p> 
               <p>And if it was time to do without him, should she kill him? A ghoul was unnatural and the enemy of all that truly lived. Every such creature deserved destruction simply for being what it was, and even had it been otherwise, now that Dron was crippled, it might actually be merciful to grant him a fast and painless death.</p> 
               <p>But she couldn't. Blacklions dealt honorably, even with the undead. "Go, then." If it turned out he'd led her falsely, it would be easy enough to run him down.</p> 
               <p>She waited while Dron hobbled a little way back down the defile. Then she took a long breath and laid another arrow on her bow. She crept forward and peered around a slimy black- and red-striped outcropping into the right branch of the fork.</p> 
               <p>As Dron had promised, a cave mouth opened onto the stones and sand of the canyon floor and the creek flowing down the center. Unfortunately, another ghoul lookout, the female with the dangling amber necklace, squatted just inside the entrance. Squinting, the creature had a hood pulled up to shield its head from the sun, but appeared morose and uncomfortable anyway.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-MagicTable.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-MagicTable_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> The demon must use the table to help it transform prisoners.
               </div> 
               <p>Kagur stepped out into the open, drew her arrow to her ear, and let it fly. At the same time, the ghoul spotted her and opened its fanged mouth to shout.</p> 
               <p>The hurtling arrow plunged into the ghoul's chest. Its cry silenced before it began, the living corpse flopped backward and lay motionless.</p> 
               <p>Kagur peered about to see if the creature's demise had gone undetected. Seemingly so. She prowled onward to the opening. There she exchanged her bow for her longsword, then skulked into the cave.</p> 
               <p>It wasn't entirely dark inside. Not at first, anyway. The daylight coming in the entryway shined for a dozen strides before the passage doglegged, and not far beyond that point, greenish luminescence flickered from an opening in the left wall.</p> 
               <p>Stalking onward, Kagur found the opening led to a side chamber that evidently contained the demon's treasures—or at least a sparse but exotic collection of possessions. A golden quill scratched letters in red on a parchment that somehow unwound more and more of itself without ever reaching an end or making a great pile of used paper. In a sluggishly moving painting, a bloody man and woman locked in a carnal embrace gnawed off and devoured pieces of one another's flesh. The green light danced from an egg-sized gem wreathed in emerald flame and reflected from an oval looking glass floating in midair.</p> 
               <p>But there was no sign of Eovath. Kagur would have to venture deeper into the cave to find him.</p> 
               <p>She took a breath, steeling herself to do so. Then a notion came to her, and she turned back to contemplate the mirror anew.</p> 
               <p>Like any proper Kellid, she distrusted sorcery even when human beings rather than demons were the casters. And a looking glass that hovered in the air was about as plainly enchanted as any article could be. There was no telling what touching it might do. Yet if the demon tried to use its horrible, debilitating gaze on her again, it might just come in handy. </p> 
               <p>Gingerly, she took hold of the mirror's golden frame and tugged. It moved it easily. When she tucked it under her arm, it made no effort to drift upward or pull away, acting no different from an ordinary object. She breathed a sigh of relief. </p> 
               <p>Then Eovath's deep voice bellowed, and metal rattled and clashed.</p> 
               <p>Kagur nearly succumbed to the urge to race in the direction of the sound. But stealth and caution might still serve her brother better, and so she managed to hold herself to a fast stride rather than a sprint.</p> 
               <p>The light failed as she stalked deeper, until she was groping her way through utter darkness. But fortunately, that was only for a few steps. Then she rounded a bend, and a trace of new light tinged the murk up ahead.</p> 
               <p>At its end, the passage widened out into another chamber. As she crept up to peek inside, metal clattered once again.</p> 
               <p>The light in the chamber shined from a scattering of glowing stones and glinted on an upright gray metal slab and the coils of chain that bound Eovath against it. Projections clasping the sides of his head kept him looking straight forward, and little hooks at the ends of thin, bent arms held his golden eyes wide open. At the top of the apparatus, a leering molded face sneered out above the giant's own.</p> 
               <p>Eovath writhed and struggled against his bonds, producing more rattling and clashing, and the chains shifted and tightened like living things to hold him in place. The metal face clenched its jaw with effort.</p> 
               <p>The bat demon watched until even Eovath, for all his enormous strength and endurance, had to leave off straining and catch his breath. Then, its clawed feet clicking on the floor, it advanced on him, probably to try again to change him.</p> 
               <p>Kagur stepped out into the open. "Stop!" she snapped.</p> 
               <p>The demon hissed and lurched around. Kagur looked straight into its crimson eyes, as though she'd learned nothing from their previous encounter, and felt the power the Abyssal creature had raised to corrupt Eovath stab at her instead. With a surge of triumph, she jerked the looking glass up in front of her face.</p> 
               <p>Nothing happened.</p> 
               <p>She was still struggling to make sense of that fact when clawed hands grabbed the mirror frame and ripped it from her grasp. Manifestly unharmed by what she'd imagined to be a masterful ploy, the demon spun the mirror behind it and released it to float.</p> 
               <p>"That's mine!" the creature snarled, and lashed out at her with its claws.</p> 
               <p>Kagur dodged aside and whipped out her longsword. When the demon snatched for her again, she cut at its scaly forearm.</p> 
               <p>She connected solidly, and her blade should have sliced deep and left the limb dangling maimed and useless. But as she pulled the weapon back, she saw it had only nicked the demon. The fiend laughed at her consternation.</p> 
               <p>Maybe her father had been mistaken. Maybe there were some things that could hurt her and which she couldn't hurt back—at least, not enough to matter.</p> 
               <p>No! There had to be a way, and she was going to find it.</p> 
               <p>But it was difficult even to think in the midst of this combat. The demon was strong and tricky, and pressed her relentlessly. In addition to contending with its claw slashes, she had to remember to avoid its gaze, and to stay alert for the slithering, thickening sensation that meant it was trying to seize hold of her with magic.</p> 
               <p>Even so, she managed to wound it two more times. But those gashes were nearly as shallow as the first, and they stopped bleeding in a matter of moments.</p> 
               <p>She retreated, and her back foot fetched up against a wall. The demon lunged, claws raking downward, and she wrenched herself out of the way—but not quite far enough. A sting of pain and a spreading wetness told her that the fiend's talons had cut her across the shoulder blade.</p> 
               <p>She didn't think the slashes were deep, but couldn't stop fighting to check. She could only come back on guard in the increasingly forlorn hope of finally cutting deep enough for it to do some good.</p> 
               <p>Or perhaps not. She belatedly realized that not all the noise in the cavern came from her battle with the demon. Still chained to the table, Eovath was throwing himself against his bonds again and again in an effort to break free.</p> 
               <p>A glance was enough to tell her that his efforts were still unavailing. But maybe she could change that. </p> 
               <p>She faked a sidestep to the demon's right, then charged forward on its left, the trick carrying her past the fiend's talons. It still slapped her with a beat of its wing, but not hard enough to knock her off her feet. She raised her sword high, leaped into the air, and cut at the face at the top of the restraining rack with all her strength.</p> 
               <p>The metal visage split, and the glinting gray mouth screamed. The lengths of chain whipped and flailed.</p> 
               <p>At Kagur's back, the demon gave a screeching hiss, and she spun around to face it once again.</p> 
               <p>It attacked as savagely as before, nearly rending her twice in as many seconds. Then a huge battleaxe whirled at its flank. As she'd hoped, hurting the chain-thing had enabled Eovath to free himself and recover his weapon, and now he was joining the fight.</p> 
               <p>The demon dodged, and a blow meant to smash into its torso merely tore a wing instead. Worse, Kagur judged that despite her brother's might, the resulting rip was smaller than it should have been—like the gashes cut by her sword, they somehow weren't enough to truly hurt the demon, and would probably heal in a matter of moments. It might be that even she and Eovath fighting together couldn't dispatch the demon in their usual fashion.</p> 
               <p>But maybe there was a different way to kill it.</p> 
               <p>Kagur waited for a moment when Eovath attacked hard and obliged the demon to focus on him. Then she darted to the floating mirror and shattered it with her sword. The bat creature pivoted toward the crash and screeched at the destruction.</p> 
               <p>"Run to the other chamber!" Kagur shouted. "Break everything!" </p> 
               <p>Without hesitation, Eovath whirled and dashed out into the tunnel.</p> 
               <p>Kagur's immediate objective was simply to get everybody moving toward the mouth of the cave, and she expected the demon to chase Eovath in the normal way. Instead, the creature paused for an instant—then vanished.</p> 
               <p>She had a bad feeling about that. As she sprinted after Eovath, she called out, "Don't break things! Just get out!"</p> 
               <p>When she passed the entrance to the green-lit treasure room, the demon was inside. It had somehow blinked from its former location to its current one, and now it goggled at her, surprised that she and the giant were racing right on by without even trying to make good on her threat.</p> 
               <p>Eovath lunged out into the sunlight, and Kagur scrambled out after him. Then, bursting into view as suddenly as it had disappeared previously, the demon was before them, crouched and ready.</p> 
               <p>Kagur darted around Eovath and cut the demon across the ribs. The giant bellowed and buried his axe in the creature's torso, and the bat thing stumbled backward. Judging by appearances, it had finally suffered real pain and shock from a wound.</p> 
               <p>"Into the creek!" Kagur gasped.</p> 
               <p>Charging, using the axe still embedded in its body like a handle, the giant bulled the demon backward. The creature snatched and scrabbled but failed either to deter its foe or detach itself from the weapon before Eovath shoved it down into the water.</p> 
               <p>"Hold its head under!" Kagur said.</p> 
               <p>Eovath dropped on top of the demon and wrapped his massive arms around it, forcing its face below the surface. Kagur ran up beside the other two combatants and, despite the risk of accidentally hitting her brother, stabbed the bat creature repeatedly.</p> 
               <p>She no longer had any expectation that the resulting wounds would kill it. But the punishment might keep it too distracted to use any of its foul magic. And in a simple wrestling match, nothing could beat a frost giant.</p> 
               <p>One and two at a time, ghouls started peering from their hiding places, from burrows like shallow graves in the sandy ground and shadowy depressions in the canyon walls. They might hate the daylight, but the commotion had roused them even so. Kagur wracked her brain for a strategy that would allow her and Eovath to contend with them and their master at the same time.</p> 
               <p>But then Eovath wheezed, "I think we got it."</p> 
               <p>He straightened up, gripped the demon by the neck, and hoisted it high, displaying it to the ghouls. The fiend dangled limply as a rag doll, and its many wounds weren't puckering shut anymore.</p> 
               <p>"You see?" Eovath croaked to the ghouls. "The demon's dead!"</p> 
               <p>The ghouls exchanged glances. Then they started retreating back into their holes and dark recesses. Maybe they feared to fight folk formidable enough to kill their maker. Kagur supposed it was even possible they were grateful for their liberation.</p> 
               <p>In any case, their withdrawal allowed her to take a closer look at Eovath, and she caught her breath to see how many times the demon had clawed him as it struggled to break free. "Are you all right?" she asked.</p> 
               <p>"I will be." Eovath dumped the demon corpse beside the water. "Thanks to my cunning sister."</p> 
               <p>"Who shouldn't have insisted on coming here in the first place. I'm sorry. I'll heed my elders and be cautious from here on."</p> 
               <p>He grinned. "Truly?"</p> 
               <p>She felt a smile tugging at her own lips. "Well, maybe."</p>

              <p class="date">Friday, January 25, 2013</p> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">The brand-new <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star</a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted plastic figures officially released on Wednesday of this week, and reactions from those lucky enough to have received them already have been very positive!</span></p> 
               <p>Speaking personally for a moment, I always love that tipping point where all of the hard work we've put into a Pathfinder Battles set finally gets shared for real with you guys, so that you can see exactly what we've been so excited about week after week here at Paizo, as we work with WizKids to make Pathfinder Battles the coolest line of prepainted plastic gaming figures available. Hearing your comments (and your criticisms, too!) makes us feel like all that hard work was really worth it, and the back-and-forth definitely makes each Pathfinder Battles release even stronger than its predecessors. I can't thank you enough for the interest and support you've shown our line since the very first day we announced it.</p> 
               <p>You guys are awesome!</p> 
               <p>Here at Paizo HQ, we've been crazy busy finishing up <a href="/products/btpy8vdl">Ultimate Campaign</a> so it can go to the printer in a couple of weeks, launching the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter">Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a>, finalizing <a href="/products/btpy8qac">Visions of WAR: The Art of Wayne Reynolds</a>, designing and finalizing the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, and hatching schemes for 2014 and beyond.</p> 
               <p>All of that effort has put a huge burden on our art department, who are trying like mad to stay on top of all of our projects as we catch up from the holiday break and ramp up to make sure all of our big summer releases come out on schedule.</p> 
               <p>That means that while I'd intended to celebrate the release of the hattered Star set with a complete reveal of high-quality photos of every figure that previously had to settle for iPhone shots taken at my desk, in fact it's taking the art team longer than anticipated to clean up all of the images, and I won't be able to show off all of them just yet. </p> 
               <p>I think we'll simply plug the photos missing after this blog into each figure's individual product page, rather than making a big to-do out of it here in the Friday preview. This space is better used for revealing cool, exciting figures you don't already own, after all, so I only want to stretch this out as long as necessary.</p> 
               <p>(At this point I should also add that the art team is ALSO cleaning up and finalizing photos of some brand new figures from an upcoming release we have not yet announced, so next week we're ready for some awesome new reveals anyway.)</p> 
               <p>But before that happens, let's take a final look at some of the Shattered Star figures you've probably only seen sitting on my desk, in early computer render form, or under some other less-than-optimal condition. (Assuming you're not currently holding them in your hand, of course.)</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-41_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-41_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have Koriah Azmeren, complete with a cool glowing sword just like in the Wayne Reynolds image that inspired her. Koriah has been around Pathfinder for a long time, first appearing as an author of the Pathfinder Chronicles in <a href="/products/btpy85ej">Into the Darklands</a>, an early Pathfinder product written by our own James Jacobs. She's an amazing figure, from the sculpt to the paint details, and we absolutely love her. Koriah is rare figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-43_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-43_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Next up is Xin, the legendary founder of Thassilon, precursor to the dreaded Runelords! This guy has been lurking around Varisia for more than 10,000 years, and when the PCs finally catch up with him I think it's fair to say he probably looks rather different than this, his "original" appearance (for how he looks today, see another figure in this set, though spoilers prevent me from saying which one!). This is one of those figures that works great as a specific NPC as well as a stand-in for just about any kind of diabolical high-level wizard you need to throw at your player characters. Xin is a rare figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-45_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-45_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Speaking of the insidious Runelords, up next we have Runelord Sorshen, who makes a surprising appearance in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>. When combined with <a href="/products/btpy8sfi">Runelord Karzoug</a>, we've now released two of the seven Runelords, covering the sins of greed and lust. Perhaps future Pathfinder Battles releases will allow you to complete the set! Runelord Sorshen is a rare figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-38_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-38_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Most of you likely recognize our next figure, the lovable Lem, Halfling Bard! Lem is our "iconic" bard, and has appeared in Pathfinder products ever since he graced the covers of <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>, our second-ever Pathfinder Adventure Path! (As a bit of trivia, Lem gets his name from Lemmy, the lead singer of the heavy metal band Motörhead, on account of their similar sideburns.) Lem is a rare figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-44_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-44_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here's another figure with roots that go back to <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>. That campaign introduced the Gray Maidens, an all-female order of knights from the city of Korvosa. Eva Widerman's original armor concept for these warriors was so cool we put it on the back cover of the <a href="/products/btpy88yj">Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</a>. When it came time to revisit certain Varisian themes in the Shattered Star Adventure Path, we knew we wanted to revisit this iconic group. Here we have Oriana, a Gray Maiden Commander, with Eva's original costume design filtered through Wayne Reynolds. We think this rare figure looks awesome! </p>

               <p>Let's move on to some monsters, shall we? Here we have the Medium Air Elemental, a common figure cast in clear plastic and touched up with some white highlights. Getting the colors right on this guy took several rounds of approvals, but I'm pleased with how he finally turned out. It's always been a major goal of mine to produce elementals at all the sizes in the <a href="/products/btpy8auu">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>, and the Shattered Star set covers us for Medium and Large versions of the core four elemental types. </p>

               </div> 
               <p>Speaking of which, the set also includes this Large Air Elemental, who frankly pushes the boundaries of a Large figure and starts hedging into quasi-Huge territory. An actual Huge will have to wait for a future set (as will the Smalls), but as I said above, Shattered Star certainly sets us off on a great start.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Last up this week we've got the enormous Troll Champion, which is one of my favorite figures in the entire set. This guy REALLY pushes the limit of a Large figure, and he absolutely is as large as we envision trolls ever getting. Yes, he towers over even some giants we've already released, but this guy is a CHAMPION. An upcoming set will feature another type of troll that's more in line with what we consider a "regular" troll to be, size-wise. Our <a href="/products/btpy8qjj">original Troll</a>, in <a href="/products/btpy8mq6">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, was a bit too small. This guy is a bit too large (on purpose, because he's so awesome). More trolls soon!</p> 
               <p>And that's it! By my count that leaves four figures remaining for high-quality photos (the Grub Swarm, Glass Golem, Natalya Vancaskerkin, and Sheila Heidmarch). We'll sneak them onto their respective singles pages later this week, clearing the docket for something genuinely new next week.</p> 
               <p>Until then, I hope you enjoy opening and admiring your new Shattered Star figures as much as we've enjoyed creating them for you!</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">In Red Rune Canyon</h1> 
              <p>by Richard Lee Byers</p> 
              <h2>Chapter Three: Divide and Conquer</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p>Kagur's legs turned soft as dough. She collapsed to her knees, banging one on a stone. Eovath dropped beside her, and the ghouls raised a hissing snarl to see the foes who'd humbled them brought low.</p> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">But by the ever-thirsty blade of the Lord in Iron, Kagur refused to be helpless. With a rasping snarl of her own, she pushed chill and weakness—well, the greater part of them, anyway—out of her body by sheer dint of will.</span></p> 
               <p>Which was good as far as it went, but instinct told her the improvement would be fleeting if she kept looking at the demon's batlike face. Somehow, it was the fiend's gaze that had debilitated her, and with that still linking them, she sensed the creature focusing its mind for a second assault. </p> 
               <p>With a fierce twist of her neck, she broke eye contact. She scrambled back to her feet even as Eovath did the same. The demon hadn't succeeded in slaying or crippling him, either. Poised to launch themselves forward, the ghouls balked at their prey's sudden recovery.</p> 
               <p>Kagur laughed. Her brother spat.</p> 
               <p>With a scream, the demon clenched its fist with such vehemence that the long claws surely stabbed into its flesh.</p> 
               <p>Kagur felt as if the air was thickening and sliding around her. She tried to spring clear of what must be some sort of supernatural attack, but she was too slow. Her limbs froze, locked in place as if her whole body were encased in ice. She couldn't even make herself bellow in rage as the demon, wings lashing the air, swept down from its perch toward them. Eovath swung his axe, but the demon jinked nimbly out of range, then curved back to sink its filthy talons into the meat of Kagur's shoulders.</p> 
               <p>Again, Kagur tried to shout something—anything—but still her jaws betrayed her, leaving her to silently suffer the pain of the intruding claws as they lifted her off the ground and up into the night sky. Below her, Eovath roared curses, and in her mind Kagur matched them.</p> 
               <p>Yet now she had bigger problems. As the ground retreated beneath her, she felt a sudden surge of mingled rage and fear. Once the creature had lifted her high enough, it need only drop her to kill her. And in her current paralyzed condition, she wouldn't even be able to resist, just fall as placidly as a dropped stone until the impact splattered her across the rocks of the canyon floor.</p> 
               <p>Yet as the demon sailed over the ridge of the canyon's wall and down into a defile on the other side, she felt a brief flare of hope. If it was descending, then perhaps it meant to set her down safely—no doubt to better enjoy the pleasure of killing her slowly.</p> 
               <p>Inwardly, Kagur smiled. All she asked was that the demon's plans force it to release its spell over her before killing her. Then she'd show it what a warrior of the Blacklions was made of. </p> 
               <p>Yet though the demon did deposit her on the ground, in a section of twisting gorge little different than the one from which it had extracted her, it didn't land as well. Instead, it released her from her magical bonds as soon as her feet touched the soil, then flapped back up out of reach. </p> 
               <p>Quick as a hunting cat, Kagur drew her sword and threw, sending it lancing up into the sky after the creature. Yet the fiend only laughed a grating laugh and rose higher, wings snapping, and the sword passed harmlessly beneath its trailing claws. Within moments, the beast had disappeared back over the canyon wall.</p> 
               <p>Kagur had no idea why the creature hadn't killed her, but she assumed it had removed her from the battlefield so Eovath would have to fight alone. She ran, retrieved her sword, and then peered about, seeking an opening that would allow her to pass through the wall at ground level.</p> 
               <p>There wasn't any. There was no way back except to climb.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Nabasu.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Nabasu_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> So this is the ghouls' master.
               </div> 
               <p>She did so, without hesitation, finding handholds and ledges to aid her ascent. But despite her resolve, she was no experienced mountaineer, and the darkness further slowed her progress. It immediately became obvious she'd never reach her brother in time to help him.</p> 
               <p>Still, panting, fingers aching, denying herself all but the briefest of rests, she struggled upward. Dawn found her atop the wall.</p> 
               <p>She peered down the other side and made out a scattering of ghoul bodies. But Eovath was nowhere to be seen—not from the ridge, and not when she completed a laborious descent.</p> 
               <p>Her jaw clenched as fury welled up inside her—an admittedly familiar sensation. But it was different, too, because this time she was angry with herself.</p> 
               <p>Borog had warned her and Eovath not to enter Red Rune Canyon, but she'd been certain she knew better. And here was the result of that brash overconfidence: her brother was lost. It made her want to scream, or pummel her own body.</p> 
               <p>She took a long, deep breath instead. Now was not the time for self-recrimination. She had to rescue Eovath before the demon had a chance to do whatever it intended to do to him.</p> 
               <p>She stooped beside the creek, scooped frigid water in her cupped hands, and slurped away the raw, parched feeling in her throat. Then she strode to retrieve her bow and quiver. Her path took her near one of the fallen ghouls, and the emaciated, gray-white thing startled her by hissing.</p> 
               <p>She drew her sword to kill it, then reconsidered. Last night, a ghoul had spoken. Maybe she could persuade this one to speak to her now.</p> 
               <p>As she approached it, she saw it was the same ghoul whose fingers she'd sliced off and whose leg she'd crippled. Then she caught her breath as she noticed the blue and green beadwork adorning its deerskin tunic and the two copper rings in the lobe of its pointed ear.</p> 
               <p>The undead thing was Dron—or what was left of him. Fighting him in the dark, Kagur hadn't realized, but it was so.</p> 
               <p>Which meant there'd never been any hope of saving him. The realization brought another pang of self-disgust.</p> 
               <p>Pushing it out of her mind, she pointed her sword at the creature on the ground. "Do you know me?"</p> 
               <p>Squinting against the morning light even though little of it had as yet reached the floor of the canyon, Dron bared his fangs.</p> 
               <p>"Talk," Kagur persisted. "I know you can. Or I'll hurt you."</p> 
               <p>"Know you," the ghoul rasped. "Cut fingers. Cut knee."</p> 
               <p>"Yes. But do you remember me from before that? From before you... changed?"</p> 
               <p>The ghoul hesitated. "Kagur."</p> 
               <p>"That's right, and you're Dron. We hunted together. Tell me what happened to you."</p> 
               <p>Dron hesitated. "Can't. Master not like."</p> 
               <p>The living Dron had been loquacious and clever. Repelled by the undead version's ugly form and noxious reek, Kagur nonetheless felt a twinge of pity at his broken speech. His transformation had seemingly damaged his mind as well as warping his body.</p> 
               <p>But compassion wouldn't get her what she needed, so she set it aside and jabbed at the raw, spongy stumps of Dron's severed fingers with the point of her longsword. The ghoul hissed, snatched the maimed hand back, and covered it with his good one.</p> 
               <p>"'Master' isn't here," Kagur said. "The demon abandoned you because you were crippled and of no further use to it. I am here, and I swear by Gorum I'll keep cutting pieces off you until you answer my questions."</p> 
               <p>Dron hesitated. Then: "Killers come. Demon eyes kill some hunters. Make me... this. Other ghouls kill the rest. For meat." The undead creature lowered his eyes. "Not want eat. But did."</p> 
               <p>Kagur frowned. "So... every time there's an attack, the demon turns one victim into a ghoul. That's why there's always a body missing. But what's the point? What does the demon want with ghouls?"</p> 
               <p>Dron shook his head, apparently to indicate he didn't actually know. But he did have an opinion: "Little demon. Wants be big demon."</p> 
               <p>In other words, to be a leader like Kagur's father, or one of the Mammoth Lords who presided over the followings. To command a following, or even a single tribe, one needed followers.</p> 
               <p>East of the tundra was the Worldwound, a land teeming with demons. People said it was the wrongness of that place seeping through the earth that tainted Red Rune Canyon. Maybe "Master" hailed from the Worldwound and meant to return one day at the head of a war band of undead warriors.</p> 
               <p>Kagur caught her breath as a ghastly possibility occurred to her. "What about Eovath, then? Is he gone because the demon changed him into a ghoul? You were here watching. Tell me!"</p> 
               <p>Dron shook his head. "Giant strong. Not change yet." He smirked as though enjoying Kagur's distress. "But Master make him weak. Ghouls drag him off. Master will change him."</p> 
               <p>Him and me, Kagur realized. That was why the demon hadn't just dropped her from on high. Eovath and she had both impressed it with their prowess, and it meant to add them both to the ranks of its followers to replace the undead they'd destroyed.</p> 
               <p>She swallowed. "No. That won't happen because I won't let it. Now, you ghouls ambushed Eovath and me without Master's permission. Why was that?"</p> 
               <p>"Told you. Hungry. Too many ghouls, not enough meat."</p> 
               <p>"Hm." She took stock and decided she was nearly out of questions. "Where is Master holding Eovath prisoner?"</p> 
               <p>"Cave. Probably."</p> 
               <p>"You're going to take me there." It ought to be quicker and surer than trying to track the other ghouls, especially since, by all accounts, the blighted land called Red Rune Canyon was actually a confusing tangle of several interconnecting gorges.</p> 
               <p>Dron flinched. "No! Tell you the way!"</p> 
               <p>"And then what could I do about it if it turned out you told me wrong? I need you with me so I can kill you if you try to betray me."</p> 
               <p>"Can't walk!"</p> 
               <p>"I can fix that."</p> 
               <p>Kagur trotted back around the bend, slung her bow and quiver over her shoulders, but left her pack where it sat lest it slow her down. She then planted her foot atop the head of one of Eovath's javelins and pulled up on the shaft until the steel point snapped away from it.</p> 
               <p>When she returned to Dron, she tossed him the length of seasoned ash. "Your crutch," she said.</p> 
               <p>Fangs bared, the ghoul struggled up with the aid of the prop. "Can't do this!"</p> 
               <p>"You can," Kagur said, "or I'll finish you off here and now."</p> 
               <p>Hobbling, the ghoul turned and led her toward the deeper recesses of the canyon. Alternately watching him for signs of treachery and scanning her surroundings from other dangers, Kagur unbuckled her belt pouch by touch, fished out the last few half-squashed bearberries, and popped them into her mouth.</p>

But with all the crazy Kickstarter stuff going on over the last month, we’ve still got a few figures left to reveal from the set.</span></p> 
               <p>So without further ado, let’s jump right into it!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Portioque.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Portioque_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have Portioque, a wily subterranean wizard who likes to hang out with his buddy, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldqp">Caedimus</a>. Like that erstwhile companion, Portioque is a common figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Clockwork.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Clockwork_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>The ancient Runelords of Thassilon often employed clockwork servants, and this Clockwork Soldier, culled straight from the pages of <a href="/products/btpy8odu">Bestiary 3</a> makes a compelling member of an ancient Thassilonian fighting force. He’s also at the common rarity, so you can work up a whole party of them to menace your player characters.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-TowerGirl.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-TowerGirl_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>And here we have the Tower Girl, a cunning rogue from an all-girl gang that plays an important role in the first adventure of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>, <a href="/products/btpy8tmh">Shards of Sin</a>. She’s common as well, and also makes a nice double for a player character rogue.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Xulgath.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Xulgath_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here’s another ancient underground dweller we like to call a Xulgath. This guy is also common, which would be a problem if he smelled as bad as his Pathfinder RPG counterpart, but which is awesome for building whole hordes of anthropomorphic subterranean lizard people. Wait until you see the paint detail on this guy’s scales. You won’t believe he’s a common, but he is!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-ClericOfZonKuthon.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-ClericOfZonKuthon_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have a Cleric of Zon-Kuthon, who appears in the Adventure Path as a not-altogether-unfriendly evil cleric named Gein Kafog. We knew we wanted to depict this cleric with a chain weapon, which can be very difficult with plastic miniatures. Our compromise was to wrap much of the chain around his body, which certainly fits in well with a follower of a god dedicated to pain. The Cleric of Zon-Kuthon is at the uncommon rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Shriezyx.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Shriezyx_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This slavering spiderlike critter is a Shriezyx, a horrific aberration cooked up by the ancient Runelords. A bunch of them still dwell in the city of Magnimar (and their stats appear in <a href="/products/btpy8slp">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments</a>). It’s probably difficult to tell from this photo, but I assure you that the face on this little bugger is GROSS. This Medium figure is at the uncommon rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Ardathanatus.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Ardathanatus_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Believe it or not, there’s an old elf under this evil-looking armor. I’d tell you whether your Shattered Star players will consider him a friend or foe, but that’s spoiler territory. Suffice it to say that Ardathanatus, a rare figure, works great as any kind of black-armored figure you might need in any campaign. And he’s got a huge axe, too!</p>

               <p>Last up this week we’ve got Sheila Heidmarch, the Venture-Captain of the Pathfinder Society’s lodge in the city of Magnimar and a patron to the player characters throughout the Shattered Star Adventure Path. With a design based on a cover illustration by Wayne Reynolds and a history that goes deep into the history of Pathfinder products, this is a fun figure I’m happy to include in the set not only because it’s beautiful, but because it will work great for just about any female spellcaster you might need. Sheila is a rare figure.</p> 
               <p>That’s it for this week. Next week the set will actually be out and you’ll be able to view the figures yourselves. I’ll do one more Shattered Star blog with high-quality images a few more figures that changed paint schemes late in the set (and hence still need to be photographed here at Paizo HQ), as well as quality images of a few figures from much earlier that had to make do with my shoddy iPhone camera shots for one reason or another.</p> 
               <p>And then it’s time to start talking about the NEXT set. And the one after that. And the one after that, and the one after that, and the one…</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">In Red Rune Canyon</h1> 
              <p>by Richard Lee Byers</p> 
              <h2>Chapter Two: Among the Dead</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">Tossing aside her blanket, Kagur sat up and looked where Eovath was gazing, but though she had keen eyes, he generally fared better in the dark. "I don't see anything."</span></p> 
               <p>Eovath stood up. "Neither do I, now. It was just a shadow, and it's shuffled back around the next bend. But whatever it was, it had two arms and two legs and was bent over like it was hurt. Dron, maybe, if he escaped."</p> 
               <p>"Or the bait in a trap." Kagur smiled. "There's one way to find out."</p> 
               <p>Her longbow was of little use when she couldn't see targets at a distance. She left it unstrung and leaning against the canyon wall and drew her longsword instead. The straight steel blade made a faint hissing sound as it cleared the pewter mouth of the scabbard.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, Eovath likewise forsook his pair of javelins in favor of his battleaxe. Jorn Blacklion had pulled the enormous double-bitted implement from the grip of a giant he'd slain in battle, and it fit the hands of his adopted son better than any little human weapon could.</p> 
               <p>"Ready?" Kagur whispered.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," Eovath replied, and they advanced.</p> 
               <p>The night was as silent as it was dark. Kagur's pulse beat in her neck.</p> 
               <p>She told herself she wasn't nervous. She was a Blacklion warrior, well schooled in the use of the sword and tested in fights with orcs, wolves, and saber-toothed cats. Still, a ghost... or a demon...</p> 
               <p>She sneered her anxiety away. Her father had taught her that if something could hurt her, she could hurt it back. That only made sense, and it meant a warrior need never be afraid.</p> 
               <p>When she and Eovath stalked around the turn, it was only to behold another stretch of gorge that, as best she could judge with only starlight to see by, was as empty as the one behind her. But as she peered about, she caught a whiff of decay hanging in the chill night air.</p> 
               <p>"Smell that?" she whispered.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," Eovath replied. "You were right. This is a trap."</p> 
               <p>"Dron could still be here." Kagur raised her voice: "Dron! It's Eovath and Kagur! We came to help you!" The shout echoed away, the sound bouncing off the canyon walls.</p> 
               <p>In response, a dark form staggered away from the wall of the gorge. As Eovath had said, it was shaped like a person, hunched over, and had its back to the Blacklions. When Kagur squinted, she could just make out variations in the texture of it that might indicate the layered fur and leather garments of a Kellid hunter. She shifted her grip on the hilt of her sword, and she and Eovath headed for the shadow. </p> 
               <p>A second black shape plummeted down onto the giant's back.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-GhoulKellid.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-GhoulKellid_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> The dead were not meant to walk.
               </div> 
               <p>Clinging to the giant like a child riding his father's shoulders, his assailant ripped at him, maybe with a dagger, maybe with something else. In the darkness, Kagur couldn't tell.</p> 
               <p>She sprang forward to cut at the attacker, but Eovath reeled around and inadvertently shielded the thing clinging to his back with his own towering body. He dropped his axe to clank on stones on the canyon floor, reached back over his shoulder, and yanked his foe from his perch, smashing it down onto the ground with a bellow.</p> 
               <p>Kagur's belly tightened in loathing, not because the creature was hideous—although it was—but because she suspected it had once been human. It still had the general form of a man and wore a man's garments. But it was so withered and shriveled that by rights, it should have had no strength at all, and its nails and teeth alike had grown long and jagged-sharp. The dark, slanted eyes in its pale face were featureless, without differentiated whites, irises, or pupils, and its ears were pointed. The carrion stench Kagur had smelled at the site of the massacre and at intervals along the trail emanated from its body.</p> 
               <p>To her surprise, the creature wrenched itself free of Eovath's grip and started to roll to its feet. She lashed out, cutting through the side of its neck until steel grated against spine. It flopped back down onto the ground, thrashed, and then lay still.</p> 
               <p>Eovath was swaying, and blood from his claw wounds stained his tunic. "How badly are you hurt?" Kagur asked him.</p> 
               <p>Nearly pitching forward in the process, he stooped and fumbled for his battleaxe. "Behind you!" he croaked.</p> 
               <p>She whirled. More shadows were rearing up from the creek. She hadn't realized it was deep enough to hide something the size of a man, but it evidently was.</p> 
               <p>The things rushed her. So did their comrade farther up the gorge, the lure that she and Eovath had hoped was Dron.</p> 
               <p>Hoping to surprise them, she charged the gaunt, pale things splashing out of the water. One surprised her instead by throwing a dagger, but she saw the gleam of metal just in time to twitch aside. The blade spun past her.</p> 
               <p>A creature sprang at her with outstretched claws, and she cut at its head and sliced half its face away. It fell, but as she pivoted to meet the next one, it started to stand back up.</p> 
               <p>No living man or beast could have shaken off the effects of a wound like that. She realized that if she and Eovath hadn't found ghosts, they'd at least come close. For the foes rushing at her were almost certainly some manner of undead, perhaps the skulking, corpse-eating brutes called ghouls.</p> 
               <p>She cut into the next one's chest, and it snarled and lunged, driving her sword deeper into itself in its frenzy to reach her. She tried to jump back and yank the blade free, but the ghoul was quick and prevented her from opening up the distance. Its clawed fingers grabbed her leather-clad forearm, and it leaned forward and opened its fanged jaws wide.</p> 
               <p>Using her off hand, she snatched a dirk from her belt and drove it into the middle of the living dead man's forehead. The creature collapsed with her longsword still embedded in its torso.</p> 
               <p>She yanked the sword free and cut in a single motion, barely in time to hold back another onrushing ghoul, this one discernibly female by virtue of its bouncing, withered breasts and swinging amber necklace. Without pausing, Kagur turned and slashed again at the one with half a face, which had by now regained its feet. It recoiled, and the attack fell short.</p> 
               <p>Kagur had always imagined the walking dead to be slow and clumsy, but the ghouls were nimble and inhumanly resilient. As she struck repeatedly, whirling and dodging all the while in an effort to keep her foes from surrounding and swarming over her as a group, she came to the uncomfortable realization that they might well overwhelm her.</p> 
               <p>Particularly if she had to go on fighting alone. Somehow, despite the incessant pressure exerted by the ghouls and the need to respond to the threat after threat, she managed to cast about and spot Eovath in the darkness.</p> 
               <p>His head bowed, the giant was down on one knee. Plainly not dead, thank Gorum! But why wasn't he fighting? Had the first ghoul wounded him that severely?</p> 
               <p>Suddenly, Kagur glimpsed a shadow, a ghoul apparently seeking easier prey than she was proving to be, darting in on the giant's flank. She couldn't have reached it in time even if she hadn't had her own foes blocking the way. She could only gasp in a breath and shout, "Look out!"</p> 
               <p>The frost giant lifted his head, cast about, and swatted the ghoul away with the back of his hand. As it fell and rolled back to its feet, he groped to reclaim his axe.</p> 
               <p>At the same moment, a charging ghoul forced Kagur to refocus on her own situation. She slashed the clawed white fingers from her assailant's hand and crippled one leg with a cut to the knee. When it fell headlong, she scrambled right over the top of it and cut at the undead brute behind it. The stroke ripped open the ghoul's neck, but that only made it bare its fangs and gather itself to spring.</p> 
               <p>Eovath fared better. Looming up behind the ghoul, he chopped down at the top of its skull and split the creature all the way down to the breastbone.</p> 
               <p>Freeing the battleaxe and dumping the ghoul's remains to the ground with a flick of his wrists, he panted, "Don't let them scratch you! It steals your strength!"</p> 
               <p>"I wasn't... planning on it." Kagur feinted high and cut low, but her target sprang aside from the true attack. "Let's fight back to back!"</p> 
               <p>Once they did, things seemed less frantic. Kagur had instants when she could consider tactics, not simply react, and her sword struck home more often. She had little doubt that behind her, Eovath's axe was chopping and smashing to similar murderous effect.</p> 
               <p>"Blacklion!" she shouted. "Blacklion!" Then her brother took up the battle cry as well, their twin roars reverberating off the canyon walls.</p> 
               <p>After several more exchanges, and another ghoul sprawled maimed and motionless in the sand and stones on the canyon floor, it became clear the undead were attacking less relentlessly than before. It seemed likely they would soon retreat, and, grinning, Kagur resolved to give chase when they did. She wanted to slaughter all the filthy things.</p> 
               <p>Then, however, two whistled notes, the first short and the second sustained, shrilled down from the sky. Whereupon the ghouls did fall back, but plainly not of their own choosing. </p> 
               <p>A signal! Judging that locating the ghouls' hitherto unsuspected leader was more important than cutting the creatures down from behind, Kagur held her position. Struggling to control her breathing, sweat stinging in her eyes, she peered upward.</p> 
               <p>Leathery wings flapped, and a shape swooped down from on high. For a moment, Kagur couldn't make out anything to distinguish it from a gigantic bat. Once it lit on an outcropping partway up one of the walls, however, it was easier to distinguish other features. Though tufted with bristles, its body was mostly hairless and scaly like a snake's, and it had arms as well as wings. Its legs were as long as a man's but bent backward like a goat's and ended in feet with three splayed toes.</p> 
               <p>"Well," Kagur panted, "you wanted to see a demon." She had little doubt they were seeing one now. The thing certainly looked demonic.</p> 
               <p>"I didn't ask for a flying one." Moving slowly, Eovath stooped and picked up a stone. Giants were notorious for their ability to throw rocks, and unless the demon descended to the canyon floor, they would have no other way of striking at it.</p> 
               <p>Although maybe they wouldn't need to, for the fiend appeared to be paying them little heed. Instead, it raked its gaze over its followers, the ones still whole—or mostly so—that had gathered beneath its perch, as well as the crippled ones struggling to crawl in the same direction, and the inert forms Kagur and Eovath had dispatched outright.</p> 
               <p>When it had glared its fill, it bared its needle fangs and hissed. "Disobedient!"</p> 
               <p>Most of the ghouls cringed, but one glowered back. "Hungry!" it growled. "Starving!"</p> 
               <p>The demon sprang from its perch. The defiant ghoul tried to dodge out from underneath, but it was far too slow. The fiend slammed down on top of it, smashed it to the ground, and, stooping, beheaded it with two sweeps of the dagger-long talons on the fingertips of its oversized hands.</p> 
               <p>Kagur watched to see if the other ghouls would protest the fate of their fellow. But even if they felt any such impulse, their master had them too thoroughly cowed.</p> 
               <p>The fiend then pivoted and glared squarely at Kagur and her foster brother for the first time. Eovath immediately flung the rock. The missile caught the demon just above its batlike snout, but despite the force with which the giant had hurled it, the stone glanced away without doing any apparent harm. Ignoring the attack, the creature locked eyes with Kagur.</p> 
               <p>Her vision shifted. Though Kagur could see that the demon was still crouching over the headless ghoul, part of her suddenly had the feeling that it was springing at her. Or perhaps she was plummeting toward it, falling sideways in defiance of nature, into eyes that yawned like pits to swallow her. Cold pain shot through her, and her heart stuttered in her chest.</p>

                <p>My name is William Boyle and I am the Venture-Captain for Ireland, both North and South. I am aided and abetted in this by my Venture-Lieutenant, Andrew Wilson, along with a dedicated crew of gamers, GMs, store liaisons, FLGS owners and managers, games club runners, and long-suffering, significant others. </p> 
                <p>I was lucky enough to encounter Pathfinders and Golarion at Gen Con UK in England back in 2008. It was great, but back home in Ireland, there was not much sign of Golarion on either side of the border. Move forward a couple of years and we realised that there was this really cool organized play campaign, Pathfinder Society. After a couple of home games we knew this deserved a wider audience. So to work...</p> 
                <p>Traditionally, RPGs here were played more at games clubs, conventions, and home games than at the limited number of games shops. Pathfinder Society has become a big part of the RPG thread at "Q-Con" in Belfast. "Q-Con" is the annual convention of Queen's University Belfast Dragonslayers Society, and is the biggest Gaming/Anime con in these islands. Last year we also joined the official programme of Gaelcon—Ireland's biggest independent convention—after previous unofficial visits! When we go to conventions we like to get the Hirst Arts 3D terrain out to add a little "preindustrial light and magic" to the show!</p> 
                <p>We have also been lucky enough to run events at local games clubs, leading to invitations to go to others. As the word has spread, brilliant GMs in other parts of the country such as Nina Hanzlikova and Liam O'Tailliuir have run Pathfinder Society at local clubs and conventions! We have run all nighters and 24 hours sessions at the Dragonslayers. We even appeared on a segment on the excellent www.theadventuringparty.net podcast!</p> 
                <p>Since the start of Pathfinder Society, games shops here have begun to spring up that allow games to be played on site.</p> 
                <p>In Northern Ireland we have <a href="/retailers/TheBlackKnightGamingCentre">The Black Knight (Larne)</a> and Creative Destruction (Portadown). In the Irish Republic, Pathfinder Society is played at <a href="/retailers/GamersHub">Gamers Hub</a> in Maynooth. Additionally, Gamers World in Dublin city centre will have it's first Pathfinder Society session in early 2013.</p> 
                <p>In 2013, Pathfinder Society will be at the same conventions noted above, but we will also be adding Warpcon and Leprecon to the list. The monthly games held at TBK have led to home based AP games (now also under the Pathfinder Society umbrella), and at the December 2012 game, almost every Pathfinder book, map, and mini on the shelves was snapped up.</p> 
                <p>We enter 2013 with high hopes and plans to expand on all fronts. Sam Johnston is our Store Liaison (aka Venture Sergeant) in "Creative Destruction Games" and Gary Bingham the same for The Black Knight in Larne. With these two dedicated volunteers, we are lucky to have a top IT gal and guy who are working on our home page and player database.</p> 
                <p>I cannot finish without recognising the tremendous support that Mike Brock and Dave Harrison have and continue to provide. Many thanks, fellas!</p> 
                <p>So if anyone is considering a trip to Ireland let us know we'd love to have you over for a game!</p>

              <p class="date">Thursday, January 10, 2013</p> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p>I've been told, all right.</p> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">A few weeks ago we <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84">ran a contest</a>, in which people competed to stat up characters from my Pathfinder Tales fiction. Choosing only three favorites from these entries was incredibly hard. There wasn't a dog among them—no offense, Arni—and of course almost everyone who built an entry (or five) did something unique.</span></p> 
               <p>With a little help from "Mean" Russ Taylor, I narrowed the field to five favorites. That made things even harder, because every one of them had something different to recommend it. Some were elegant in their simplicity, others demonstrated exacting (and rather flattering) attention to detail. Others just plain put me to shame, because you folks know the rules so much better than I do.</p> 
               <p>What won me over in the end was a combination of authenticity to the characters coupled with innovative or surprising design choices. My three favorite entries gave me a new way of looking at how those characters do what they do. </p>
               <h2>My Favorites (in no particular order)</h2> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#37"><b>Xellos (Jeggare)</b></a>—This one is both highly faithful to the novels and a very innovative build, since the magus didn't exist when I first imagined the count. Excellent explanations. Just outstanding all around.</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#45"><b>havoc xiii (Radovan)</b></a>—While I originally thought of monk levels for Radovan, the cad works out really well. This is another innovative build that challenged my preconceptions even as it was faithful to what we see Radovan doing in the books.</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84&amp;page=2?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#51"><b>Rosgakori (Kemeili)</b></a>—Really excellent, a trifle more powerful than I'd imagined her, but in ways that fit. Spell selection a little different from what I'd sketched out for the book, but since I didn't show her casting every spell she knew, that's not a problem.</p> 
               <h2>Very Honorable Mentions (also in no particular order)</h2> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#49"><b>Jesse Benner (Jeggare/Radovan)</b></a>—Extremely faithful to the books, these straight-up builds are pretty close to what I'd jotted down in my notes. Although I hadn't given Radovan any fighter levels, they certainly make sense.</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#11"><b>Yumeko (Goblin Who Swallowed the Wind)</b></a>—A beautifully simple presentation of one of my favorite secondary characters. This one would have my "less is more" prize if I had a bag full of special awards.</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#21"><b>Beek383 (Jeggare, Arnisant, Zandros, Mon Choi, Radovan)</b></a>—Together, these were easily the most comprehensive survey of characters, nice and straightforward. I like to think this is how others are using some of the novel characters in their games.</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#35"><b>LoreKeeper (Radovan)</b></a>—A good basic build for Radovan, a little lower-level than I'd imagined but with all of the essentials. I love the explanation. That makes the entry—and those that followed its example—that much more interesting.</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#36"><b>Tangaroa (Azra)</b></a>—I actually like the "ugly little girl" take on Azra, and this version definitely pays attention to her abilities from the book. Azra's the character whose "build" I've most questioned since her first appearance, since the oracle class came out soon after.</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#38"><b>Blue_Hill (Caladrel)</b></a>—A very good interpretation of the character, and surprisingly close to what I statted up in Hero Lab. Well done!</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#39"><b>Kevin Andrew Murphy (Iolanda)</b></a>—I never gave Iolanda's game stats this much thought, but if I had, I hope I'd have come up with something this good. The skill and spell selection make perfect sense. In this version, she's even deadlier than I'd imagined.</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">In Red Rune Canyon</h1> 
              <p>by Richard Lee Byers</p> 
              <h2>Chapter One: A Difference of Opinion</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">The wind blowing in Kagur's face smelled of rot. She started running, and the soft earth, boggy with the coming of summer, sucked at her feet. Her five companions ran as well.</span></p> 
               <p>Eovath soon pulled ahead of everyone else. Like her, the blue-skinned frost giant was still growing, but he was already taller than any human tribe member, with longer legs and a longer stride.</p> 
               <p>He slowed down, though, when the several bodies on the ground came into view. It was too late to help them, and prudent to advance with caution in case their killers were still lurking about.</p> 
               <p>They didn't seem to be, though, which left Kagur free to inspect the corpses. The shredded flesh, glazed eyes, and flies that buzzed up into the air at her approach forced her to swallow away the stinging taste of bile.</p> 
               <p>Her squeamishness made her scowl. Like any Kellid warrior, she'd seen violent death before, and only one of the dead folk here had been a Blacklion like Eovath and herself. But they'd all become friendly since setting forth to hunt from a gathering of half a dozen tribes.</p> 
               <p>Borog straightened up from his examination of one of the corpses. A member of the Eagleclaw tribe, he was the oldest surviving member of the hunting party, with deep lines etched in his sun-bronzed face, pouches under his dark eyes, and white hairs speckling a close-cropped black beard. "Like the others," he said.</p> 
               <p>They'd all heard tales of other hunters encountering the same grisly end. They just hadn't let it deter them from roaming the prairie themselves. No true Kellid allowed fear to rule her, and even had it been otherwise, a tribe that didn't hunt wouldn't eat.</p> 
               <p>"Not all the others," Eovath said. His adolescent voice broke on the second word, but even then it was as deep as most men's.</p> 
               <p>Borog frowned. "How so?"</p> 
               <p>"The way I heard it," the frost giant said, "the first band of hunters fell dead without a mark on them. It was the latter ones that were torn apart."</p> 
               <p>The Eagleclaw warrior snorted. "And what does that tell you? That the first incident was something different than the slaughters that have happened since."</p> 
               <p>"Maybe not," Kagur said. Turning, she counted the corpses. "Supposedly, every band, including that first one, had one member carried off. And one of our own is missing: Dron."</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kagur.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kagur_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> Those who try to protect Kagur would be
                <br>better off protecting themselves.
               </div> 
               <p>One of the other hunters hurriedly checked Kagur's body count with the aid of a jabbing finger. Another touched the beaten silver good-luck charm hanging around her neck.</p> 
               <p>"All right," Borog growled, "maybe the same thing did kill the first party. At this point, what does it matter?"</p> 
               <p>"It doesn't," Kagur said. "What matters is picking up the trail." Studying the ground, she prowled away from the corpses, and after a moment, her companions followed her lead.</p> 
               <p>She hoped it would be easy to find tracks in the mucky earth, and bent blades among the new grass, and in fact, it was only a short time before Eovath called out: "Here! The sign isn't clear enough to tell what the killers are. But they came from the northeast and headed back that way, too."</p> 
               <p>"Let's see," Borog said. He stalked to where Eovath was standing, squatted to study the sign, then grunted in a way that suggested he agreed with the giant's reading.</p> 
               <p>"Let's move out," Kagur said, striding closer to the other two.</p> 
               <p>"No," Borog replied. "Red Rune Canyon is northeast."</p> 
               <p>Kagur blinked. That particular fact had momentarily eluded her. And while she'd only heard rumors about strange deaths on the tundra since the start of summer, she'd listened to tales about Red Rune Canyon her whole life. Every Kellid knew the place was cursed.</p> 
               <p>But in the present circumstances, that didn't matter. "We have to rescue Dron."</p> 
               <p>"Dron's dead," said Zorek, a lanky Eagleclaw of about Kagur's age. Blood had trickled out of his sleeve to stain the back of his hand. Several days previously, a ground sloth had clawed his forearm, and he picked at the scabby gash when no one was watching to slow the healing and make an impressive scar.</p> 
               <p>"You don't know that," Kagur said. "If the attackers wanted him dead, they could have killed him on the spot like they did everybody else. You don't know they really came from Red Rune Canyon, either."</p> 
               <p>"They could just be orc raiders out of the Hold of Belkzen," Eovath rumbled.</p> 
               <p>Borog shook his head. "Smell the rot in the air. Our friends haven't lain dead long enough to stink like that. That's the smell of the unnatural things that killed them."</p> 
               <p>Kagur scowled. "Maybe, but it doesn't change anything. Dron still needs rescuing, and our dead need avenging."</p> 
               <p>Borog took a breath. "Look around. There are fewer of us than there were of those who lost their lives already, and you, Zorek, and the giant are young and green. How do you expect to win where a stronger band of warriors already lost?"</p> 
               <p>"We can make a plan when we know more."</p> 
               <p>"Here's the plan," Borog said. "We'll return to our tribes, and the chiefs will decide what to do next. Maybe they'll decide to hunt and fight the killers properly, and you can ask permission to join the war party."</p> 
               <p>"By then, Dron will likely be dead or tortured."</p> 
               <p>"But you'll be alive, and Jorn Blacklion won't start a feud with the Eagleclaws because I let his idiot daughter come to harm."</p> 
               <p>"It's not for you to decide what the 'idiot daughter' will do," Kagur said. "You're not my chief, and I'm going after Dron even if nobody else does."</p> 
               <p>"No," said Borog, "you aren't."</p> 
               <p>If his voice changed, his eyes shifted, or his hand gestured to give a signal, Kagur didn't notice in a conscious way. But the rest of the hunters had drifted up behind her to listen to the conversation, and suddenly instinct screamed that they were reaching for her.</p> 
               <p>She tried to spring forward, but hands grabbed her forearms and held her back. She stamped on a foot and snapped her head backward into someone's teeth and jaw. That loosened the grips restraining her, and she wrenched herself free and spun around.</p> 
               <p>Spreading out to flank her, her three assailants came after her. Backing away, she reflexively reached for her longsword, and they faltered, as well they might. Young as she was, she was skilled with a blade, and they knew it.</p> 
               <p>But, her anger notwithstanding, she knew drawing a weapon would be stupid. She didn't want to kill folk from friendly tribes, especially when, as they saw it, they were only trying to stop her from coming to harm.</p> 
               <p>She hitched her foot, faking another step backward, and when they advanced, she threw herself at them. She punched Zorek in the solar plexus and made the breath whoosh out of him, but then her other two opponents grabbed her. One kicked her left foot out from underneath her, and they dumped her onto the ground.</p> 
               <p>Kagur thrashed but couldn't break their holds. Panting, Zorek came up behind them with a length of rawhide in his hands.</p> 
               <p>A big blue hand caught him by the shoulder and flung him aside. Then Eovath bashed the other hunters away from her with two sweeps of his fist.</p> 
               <p>Grateful as she was for the help, Kagur winced. Eovath was stronger than any human, and he hadn't held back.</p> 
               <p>Fortunately, her assailants weren't seriously hurt, as they demonstrated by scrambling back to their feet. Unfortunately, they too deemed that the confrontation had escalated from a scuffle to a deadly serious fight, and they snatched for the weapons slung from their belts.</p> 
               <p>Eovath lunged, caught Zorek before he could ready his axe, and heaved him into the air by his throat and arm. The lanky Eagleclaw's face turned red, and he made gurgling sounds.</p> 
               <p>Borog hefted a javelin. The upper edge of the leaf-shaped steel point glinted in the morning sunlight. "Let him go."</p> 
               <p>"You might kill me," Eovath said, his yellow eyes gleaming like the spear point, "but not fast enough to keep me from killing your kinsman. One shake snaps his spine. One squeeze crushes his windpipe."</p> 
               <p>"No!" cried Kagur, leaping to her feet. "I mean, no to both of you! Borog, what's the sense of killing us to keep us from risking our lives?"</p> 
               <p>"I never threatened to kill you," Borog replied without taking his eyes off Eovath. "Only the slave."</p> 
               <p>She put her hand on her sword hilt. "Eovath is my brother, and if you hurt him, you'd better kill me."</p> 
               <p>Borog's jaw tightened. "Fine. Go. Your father must know what a stubborn fool you are. Maybe he won't blame me."</p> 
               <p>Eovath sneered and tossed Zorek away.</p> 
               <p>Once Kagur and the giant were on the trail and sure their erstwhile companions weren't following, she asked, "What were you going to do if they called your bluff?"</p> 
               <p>The giant smiled a crooked smile. "What makes you think I was bluffing?"</p> 
               <p>"You wouldn't really kill friends of the Blacklions."</p> 
               <p>"They didn't seem much like friends when they jumped you."</p> 
               <p>Still, she doubted their father would have approved. But if Kagur and Eovath had offended the Eagleclaws, Jorn Blacklion would make amends with gracious words and gifts. Meanwhile, his daughter and foster son had a hunt to complete. She paused to inspect the ground before them, then pointed at the clearest track she'd found so far: the unmistakable impression of a boot.</p> 
               <p>Eovath nodded. "You were right. Dron isn't dead. In fact, he's fit enough for his captors to march him along."</p> 
               <p>For a moment, Kagur was certain that was the way of it. Then she noticed additional tracks a couple paces farther along. "I hope so. But look here. The 'captors' were wearing boots, too."</p> 
               <p>Eovath grunted. "Then maybe they are orc raiders, despite the putrid smell. Or Kellids turned bandit."</p> 
               <p>Kagur looked up at him. "You sound disappointed."</p> 
               <p>"Haven't you ever been curious to see a ghost or a demon?"</p> 
               <p>"I suppose. Is that why you agreed we should come after Dron?"</p> 
               <p>"I agreed because no one should be dragged off into slavery."</p> 
               <p>Kagur frowned. "You're not a slave, despite what Borog said. No Blacklion thinks of you that way. Not anymore. Not for a long while."</p> 
               <p>The frost giant shrugged his massive shoulders. "We should keep moving."</p> 
               <p>They did, loping across windswept tundra and past ponds surrounded by patches of yellow-green moss and stunted diamond-leaf willows. When the trail led near ripe red bearberries, they gobbled some and picked more for later. Gray-white hawks with crimson beaks floated in the sky, and wild mammoths trumpeted in the west.</p> 
               <p>Animals grew scarcer, though, as the terrain became hillier and the trackers drew near to Red Rune Canyon. By the time the sun was sinking toward the western horizon, and the notch between two stony walls came into view, Eovath and Kagur were the only moving, breathing things in sight.</p> 
               <p>"It's nearly dark," Eovath said. "We could camp here and head in come morning."</p> 
               <p>Kagur shook her head. "Let's cover as much ground as we can."</p> 
               <p>Unfortunately, that wasn't a great deal more, for when, peering about for lurking orcs and other dangers, they prowled into the mouth of the canyon, they found it was already twilight inside. They had to stop not long thereafter lest they risk losing the trail.</p> 
               <p>They camped beside the creek that ran down the center of the gorge and supped on more bearberries and bison jerky. Kagur had swamp tealeaves in her pack as well, but it would be foolish to build a fire to brew a beverage. Someone or something might spot the light. So far, however, Red Rune Canyon had done nothing to justify its sinister reputation. </p> 
               <p>Later, when Eovath was on watch and sleep continued to evade her despite the day's exertions, Kagur came to a decision. "It's just orcs. Orcs bold and cunning enough to hole up where humans are afraid to go."</p> 
               <p>"What about the rotten smell?" Eovath replied.</p> 
               <p>"How many clean orcs have you fought?"</p> 
               <p>"What about the first hunting party, slain without a mark on them?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't know, but—"</p> 
               <p>Eovath suddenly peered farther down the canyon. "Something's there."</p>

               <p>First, and most importantly, I want to thank all of the Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants, regional and convention coordinators, GMs, and people I use as sounding boards (you know who you are). Without all of you, I would not be able to achieve everything listed below and make Pathfinder Society as great as it is. I also want to thank all of our players and fans. Without you, I wouldn't have an awesome job to come to each morning. So, thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your efforts and support.</p> 
               <p>The Pathfinder Society campaign has already seen numerous positive improvements and changes. Here is a short list of things we've accomplished together in 2012:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>The recruitment and assignment of more than 175 new <a href="/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators">Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants</a> to help us grow Pathfinder Society by having a Paizo 'face' in many local areas.

                <li>A complete overhaul to the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society webpage</a>, as well as small numerous updates to <a href="/pathfinderSociety/faq">the FAQ (red updates!)</a> and <a href="/pathfinderSociety/resources">Additional Resources page</a>.</li>

                <li>Releasing the <a href="/products/btpy84k4"><i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play, Version 4.3</i></a> today with some much needed updates. The complete list of updates can be downloaded with the new version of the Guide or found on the messageboards. A few highlights include:</li> 
                <ul>
                 <li>Page 10: Added the following under the religion entry: "Druids, oracles, and rangers are the exception to this rule. The list is not exhaustive, and divine spellcasters of any future classes whose sources are added as additional resources to the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign will be required to choose a deity unless otherwise specified."</li> 
                 <li>Page 22: Reworded the note regarding First Steps for clarity, and added a sentence advising that Prestige Points be awarded after playing each part of the First Steps series.</li> 
                 <li>Pages 27—28: Changed the name of the section "Retirement and Beyond" to "Beyond Level 11." Reworded the section for clarity and added the special title of Seeker for any Pathfinder agent who has achieved 12th level.</li> 
                 <li>Page 28: Added Campaign Service Award Coins to the items that offer free rerolls.</li> 
                 <li>Pages 35: Changed the text in the Table Variance section to allow GMs more flexibility and better adjudication at their tables.</li> 
                 <li>Page 47: Added an index.</li>
                </ul>
               </ul> 
               <p>We've addressed our leadership, our organization, our ground game, and our rules. And we couldn't have done any of it without all of you.</p> 
               <p>All that is great, but it's not enough. We're not done yet (which means that we all have more work to do). I'm excited about the future of the Society. In particular, the following items on my now-less-than-secret to-do list excite me:</p> 
               <div class="blurb180">

               </div>

               <p>The last year has been a great learning experience for me as Pathfinder Society continually evolves and improves. There have been some bumps in the road, but nothing that has proven insurmountable. I already knew that the Pathfinder Society community is smart, diverse, and very passionate. It is amazing how much energy and enthusiasm you all have for the game and it is very inspiring. Likewise, the people here at Paizo are some of the most creative and different-thinking people I've ever met. It's as amazing as you'd think it was.</p> 
               <p>I will finish with letting everyone know that I will continue to do the best job I possibly can to help Pathfinder Society grow and improve. Sometimes I will make mistakes. But, if I do make a mistake, I will own up to it. As always, I am available for all of you to reach out to me with concerns, criticisms, thoughts, suggestions, venting, and ideas via email, private message, Skype, phone call, carrier pigeon, written letter, <i>message</i> spell, pony express, <i>contact other plane</i> spell, or <i>sending</i> spell.</p>

               <p>So let's go off to the races!</p> 
               <p>We've previously revealed the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldwh">Medium and Large Fire Elementals</a>, and <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le1x">the Medium and Large Water Elementals</a>. This week, it's time to reveal two more elementals, leaving only two more for future previews.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-EarthElementalMedium.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-EarthElementalMedium_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>First up we have the Medium Earth Elemental, a rocky bruiser erupting from the ground to smash some hurt onto the heads of your player characters. Painted in dark browns and grays and with glowing red eyes, this figure is a pretty typical example of its kind. Cool green crystal formations along his arms give the Medium Earth Elemental a distinctive look. The whole figure is sculpted in clear plastic because we originally wanted to leave the crystals completely clear, or slightly greenish tinted to match the colors on the original art for this creature, which first appeared in the <a href="/products/btpy8tj5"><i>Bestiary Box</i></a>. Much to our surprise, versions of the figure featuring a pearlescent coat of green paint over the crystals actually looked much better than the clear plastic, so as in the case with some of the other elementals, we decided to go with paint over clear plastic. This surprised me (I thought we'd prefer clear), but in this case a huge consensus of Paizonians agreed that the painted crystals simply looked better.</p> 
               <p>But all was not lost for lovers of clear plastic! We used the mold for the Medium Earth Elemental as the basis for the Lava Lurker figure that's part of the ongoing <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo" target="_blank">Pathfinder Online Kickstarter Campaign</a>. That figure is very much clear, with red tints that make him look like, well, he lurks in lava.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-EarthElementalLarge.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-EarthElementalLarge_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Bigger is often better, and that adage is certainly true when it comes to earth elementals! Behold the Large Earth Elemental, a dude you definitely don't want pounding you into the dirt (but whom you may wish to summon to pound someone else!). The coloration on this figure is very similar to his Medium counterpart, only at a size pushing the very top of Large, he's significantly more intimidating. I love this figure's wide jaw and expressive face. You can almost hear him shouting "IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!"</p> 
               <p>The Medium elementals in this set are at the common rarity, while the Larges are rares.</p> 
               <p>I'm going to hold on to the Large and Medium Air Elementals until a future preview. They are also awesome, but I don't want to over-elementalize you guys in one sitting. I'll leave that for when you open your own boxes of the Shattered Star set and start assembling your own elemental armies!</p> 
               <p>Instead, let's take a look at two more Large figures from the Shattered Star set!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-GlassGolem.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-GlassGolem_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up next we have the Glass Golem, a figure with such a complex paint scheme that it was one of the very last to be completed (and thus my cruddy iPhone photo will have to suffice for the moment). As the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldnr">Shining Child from the Rise of the Runelords set</a> and this set's elementals have taught us, "clear" figures are among the trickiest to get right in the painting stage.</p> 
               <p>Simply casting the figures in clear plastic never works, as important sculpt details vanish without proper shading. Painting over the clear plastic completely has proven to be the correct option in a few cases, but it always seems like a bit of a disappointment and a copout. The best solution, as Goldilocks certainly knew, was to get the paint balance JUUUUUST RIGHT. In the case of the Glass Golem, we wanted not just a neat clear effect, but something that actually looks like glass. After several tries, we finally got the balance right.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-FireGiant.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130104-FireGiant_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Last up this week is the cantankerous Fire Giant, a mean old brute ready to hack you apart with his crude sword. Thanks to drybrushing (and a little bit of clear plastic peeking through here and there), this guy looks like he burns with an inner fire. His face and fiery beard are very expressive, and will make him stand out among his other giant kin.</p> 
               <p>That's it for this week! Next week we'll take a look at some more key NPCs from the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>!</p> 
               <p>Also next week, we'll reveal additional details about a special convention-season promotional repaint goblin figure that we'll be distributing throughout 2013! Backers of the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo" target="_blank">Pathfinder Online Kickstarter Campaign</a> at the Goblin Squad level and above will get a certificate to receive this figure FREE at Gen Con. So come on back and check it out, this is definitely a figure you will not want to miss!</p> 
               <p>See you in seven days!</p>

               <h2>Chapter One: The Last Feast</h2> 
               <div style="float: left; padding: .5em 1em .5em 0;">
                <a href="/products/btpy8v37"><img src="/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO8512_120.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>For a moment, everyone fell quiet at once, and Kagur heard the wind howling outside the Blacklions' meeting tent, a long, peak-roofed shelter pieced together from the tanned hides of mammoths, giant sloths, and other enormous beasts. Then the wood burning in one of the fire pits <i>cracked.</i> Yellow flame leaped, sparks flew upward, and as if that had broken a spell, the whole tribe resumed its clamor.</p> 
               <p>Annik struck up a fresh tune on a harp shaped from caribou antler and strung with reindeer gut.</p> 
               <p>Grinning like one of the snow foxes that had given its fur to make his tunic, Roga told a joke. Kagur couldn't catch it all, but like most of Roga's pun-laden humor, it must have been awful. It elicited groans and prompted Taresk to peg a well-gnawed elk bone across the trestle table at him.</p> 
               <p>Zonug held up his silver-chased drinking horn, and eight-year-old Dron came scurrying. When the boy failed to fill the vessel all the way to the brim, Zonug made a show of peering inside it, mock scowled, and bellowed, "By Gorum's blood-red eyes! Who's pouring here, Ganef of the Fivespears?"</p> 
               <p>That sally <i>did</i> make people laugh. The chieftain of the Fivespears tribe was much disliked for his stingy, conniving ways.</p> 
               <p>In fact, Kagur reflected, Ganef was the antithesis of all that a proper Kellid chieftain should be—which was to say, the antithesis of her father. Sitting straight and tall, the gray eyes of a Blacklion keen and his mane of hair raven-dark despite his advancing years, Jorn turned and told Eovath to tap another cask of Tian brandy.</p> 
               <p> Even more than their generous, valorous leader, or the preserved skull of the gigantic man-eating cave lion their first chieftain had slain generations before, Eovath was the emblem of Blacklion pride, for only the bravest tribes captured and adopted frost giants. Twice as tall as a man but with a build so thick and muscular he nonetheless looked squat, Eovath had long, straw-colored hair, eyes to match, and skin the blue of the sky at dusk. To Kagur, his features looked less brutish and more intelligent than those of other frost giants, and she sometimes wondered if the love and care of humans had so improved him that the benefit even showed in his face.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Eovath.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Eovath_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> How could Eovath do such a thing?
               </div> 
               <p>For much of his life, Eovath had sat by Jorn at the head of the table. He needed to be where the ceiling was highest to keep his head from bumping against it. Still, when he rose in response to his foster father's command, it did anyway, even though he didn't straighten up all the way. Moving with care so as not to jostle anyone or anything, he picked up the brandy cask. His prodigious strength and enormous hands managed it easily.</p> 
               <p>Kagur considered staying and sharing the brandy. After all, the liquor and wine that came over the Crown of the World were rare treats. If the tribe hadn't fared exceptionally well hunting this past season, amassing fine wolf and bear pelts and caribou hides in abundance, her father couldn't have afforded to trade for it. It would certainly warm the blood on a frigid winter night.</p> 
               <p>But she didn't actually need drink to warm her, or the flames in the fire pits, either. Stroking her thigh beneath the table, Dolok's hand was more than sufficient.</p> 
               <p>She liked Dolok. He had a quick, crooked smile, and was nimble and clever enough to make her work at sword practice. He obviously saw something to like in her as well, and they'd grown amorous in recent weeks, kissing and fondling until she made him stop.</p> 
               <p>She'd already decided that tonight would be the night they wouldn't stop. Once the feast was in full swing and everyone was tipsy, they'd slip away unnoticed.</p> 
               <p>She'd just as soon avoid the bawdy jokes of the rest of the tribe, good-natured though they would be. And as for her father, well, it was one of the great mysteries of life how he knew perfectly well that she was a grown woman—indeed, one of his ablest warriors and hunters—yet could only see her as a fragile little girl whenever lovemaking was in the offing.</p> 
               <p>She nodded toward the nearest exit. Dolok grinned in response. They rose and made their way toward the end of the tent.</p> 
               <p>As Dolok untied the rawhide knots that secured the flap, Kagur glanced around to see if their departure really was going unremarked. Pouring brandy into the leather wineskins in the hands of Dron and the other child servers, Eovath looked back at her.</p> 
               <p>She might have expected a smirk, a wink, or even a reflection of their father's characteristic frown of disapproval. Instead, he looked ...relieved? About what?</p> 
               <p>Dolok pulled back the flap, and a blast of cold wind and swirling snowflakes blew the question out of her mind. She hastily followed him out into the night.</p> 
               <p>The snowdrifts were halfway to her knees and crunched as she waded through them. Clouds covered the moon and stars, and the other tents were merely shadows in the dark. So were the mammoths standing shaggy and stolid, impervious to the worst the blizzard could do.</p> 
               <p>Kagur took Dolok's hand and drew him into a supply tent. "Whew!" he said, smiling. "It's not much warmer in here!"</p> 
               <p>"I know what to do about that," she said.</p> 
               <p>They clung together and kissed for a while. His mouth tasted of the bison he'd eaten and the ale he'd drunk.</p> 
               <p>She started unlacing and unbuckling his clothing of fur, hide, and leather, and he did the same for her. When their garments were open, and they could touch in ways they hadn't before, they lay down together.</p> 
               <p>At that point, he took the lead, kissing and caressing. Content for the moment to be passive, she closed her eyes and enjoyed it. </p> 
               <p>Someone screamed.</p> 
               <p>"What was that?" Kagur gasped.</p> 
               <p>Dolok lifted his head. "What?"</p> 
               <p>"Someone cried out."</p> 
               <p>He grinned. "That was you, honeycomb."</p> 
               <p>"Someone <i>else</i> cried out."</p> 
               <p>"Then it was the wind. It's howling like a pack of wolves."</p> 
               <p>He was right. Perhaps her imagination was playing tricks on her. Surely no enemy would come raiding on a night like this, and if one did, the mammoths would trumpet a warning.</p> 
               <p>She smiled. "The wind. Yes. Sorry." She settled back, inviting him to resume his attentions. But as soon as he obliged, she heard another shriek.</p> 
               <p>When she tensed, Dolok frowned. "What now?" he asked.</p> 
               <p>"You must have heard it that time."</p> 
               <p>"No."</p> 
               <p>"Then my ears are sharper than yours. Get up!"</p> 
               <p>"Curse it, Kagur!" But he did as instructed.</p> 
               <p>When they mostly had their garments refastened against the cold, she hurried back out into the night, and he followed. On first inspection, the meeting tent looked no different than before.</p> 
               <p>"See?" Dolok said. "Everything's fine."</p> 
               <p>"Maybe." But she led him onward anyway.</p> 
               <p>Another scream shrilled, louder and unmistakable now that they were closer.</p> 
               <p>"Lord in Iron!" Dolok said.</p> 
               <p>Floundering in the snow, they ran to the tent flap. Kagur tugged the edge back, and they peered through the crack.</p> 
               <p>Every human in the tent was down, either slumped across one of the tables or sprawled on the ground. Some moaned or stirred, barely, like swatted flies still clinging to a trace of life. Some were utterly still, and a number of the latter group lay hacked and dismembered in pools of blood.</p> 
               <p>Grinning, his yellow eyes shining like molten gold in his blue face, Eovath was doing the chopping with a huge axe the Blacklions had taken as a trophy on the same day they'd seized the giant himself. Gore dripped from the weapon's edge and stained his arms all the way to the elbows.</p> 
               <p>This is a dream, Kagur thought. He <i>couldn't </i>do this. He's my brother.</p> 
               <p>Then Eovath turned toward Annik, who lay on her side with her fingers still tangled in her harp strings, and raised the axe. Kagur's incredulity shattered. This horrible thing <i>was</i> happening, and if she didn't intervene immediately, Eovath would murder Annik and then move on to another victim, and another after that, until no human in the tent was left alive.</p> 
               <p>But what could Kagur do? Kellids were a warrior race, and none more than the Blacklion tribe, but even so, neither she nor Dolok had carried weapons to the feast.</p> 
               <p>The only option was to <i>talk</i> to Eovath. Talk, stall him, and hope that, as she'd always believed, he loved his foster sister.</p> 
               <p>"Arm yourself," she whispered to Dolok. "Take him from behind." She gave him a shove to start him moving.</p> 
               <p>Then she yanked the gap between the flap and the rest of the tent wider and squirmed through. "Wait!" she shouted.</p> 
               <p>Eovath pivoted and looked her over. Then he sighed and lowered the axe slightly. "When you left without drinking the poison, I thought you were out of it," he rumbled in a voice deeper than any human's. "I thought the Rough Beast had granted me a favor."</p> 
               <p>"'The Rough Beast?'" That made no sense, either. The Blacklions had raised Eovath to revere Gorum and, to a lesser extent, Desna, the same as they did. Only the worst and maddest people worshiped Rovagug, god of annihilation and wrath—a being so mighty and infinitely malevolent that, at the dawn of time, both good and evil deities had combined forces to imprison him, lest he destroy the world. Even that hadn't rendered him entirely powerless, and from time to time he still created earthquakes and terrible beasts to ravage the lands of men.</p> 
               <p>The frost giant nodded. "He talks to me. In my dreams, mostly, but sometimes I hear him even when I'm awake."</p> 
               <p>"How could that be?" Kagur asked. Blood dripped from the edge of a table. Across the tent, someone retched. "You're not a shaman."</p> 
               <p>"No," Eovath said, "but I will be. It's part of his plan for me."</p> 
               <p>"Listen," Kagur said. "You're confused, and it's making you do bad things. You're killing your own tribe. Your family."</p> 
               <p>Eovath spat. "My family died a long time ago."</p> 
               <p>It took her a moment to guess what he meant. "The other giants? Your blood kin?"</p> 
               <p>"Who else? You've heard the story often enough. How your father and the rest of the Blacklions slaughtered my tribe and carried me off into slavery."</p> 
               <p>"You're not a sla—"</p> 
               <p>"Don't lie to me!"</p> 
               <p>She took a breath. "All right. It's true, that's what they call it. But Father raised you like his own son."</p> 
               <p>"To make me forget my real father and turn me into a traitor to my own kind."</p> 
               <p>Kagur felt like she was saying all the wrong things. What did she know about reasoning with lunatics? Where in the name of keen iron was Dolok?</p> 
               <p>"Eovath," she said, "brother ...humans raid giants, but giants raid humans, too. It's just the way things are."</p> 
               <p>"But not the way they have to be."</p> 
               <p>She hesitated. "I don't understand."</p> 
               <p>"Down in the depths, a sun shines in the darkness, and a pyramid rises under the sun. That's where I'll find what I need to do my work."</p> 
               <p>"What does that mean?"</p> 
               <p>He grinned. "I don't know. But the Rough Beast will guide me, through the Earthnavel and beyond."</p> 
               <p>"Can't you hear how crazy you sound? But if you want to go on a journey, just do it. You don't need to kill all the people who love you."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I do. Rovagug wouldn't help me if I didn't sacrifice to him, and even if he would, the spirits of my <i>real</i> tribe are calling out for vengeance. They won't be satisfied until every human is driven from the tundra."</p> 
               <p>She stared into his yellow eyes. "Even me?"</p> 
               <p>He winced. "I told you I wanted to spare you. I still do. Just go to one of the other tents and don't come out till morning."</p> 
               <p>"You know I can't do that."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose I knew you wouldn't." He lifted the axe and advanced on her, stepping over the dead and the helpless, leaving footprints in the pools of blood.</p> 
               <p>Kagur reached past a corpse with a smashed skull for a wooden platter. The grilled ribs of an aurochs tumbled off as she grabbed it up and skimmed it at Eovath's head. Not even breaking stride, he knocked it aside with a flick of the axe.</p> 
               <p>She grabbed a stool and flung that. He chopped and again prevented the blow, but he ended up with the stool stuck on the blade of the axe. With a scowl, he started to shake it loose.</p> 
               <p>At that instant, when he was at least partly distracted, Kagur grabbed a knife smeared with grease and flecks of bear meat. It wasn't a proper weapon, just the kind of tool every Kellid carried for eating, mending harness, and whittling tent pegs. But it was a length of steel with a point, and she hurled it at Eovath's heart.</p> 
               <p>It only had a short distance to travel, but even so, he jerked to the side, and the spinning knife only pierced his left biceps. He bellowed, shook the remains of the stool off the axe, and charged.</p> 
               <p>With the walls of the tent hemming her in, Kagur only had one place to go. She sprang and rolled over the tabletop, upsetting trays and dishes in the process. For an instant, she found herself gazing into the glazed gray eyes of Roga's severed head, and then momentum carried her onward. She tumbled off the other edge of the table into someone's lap—she didn't see whose, or if he was alive or dead. He toppled backward, and they crashed to the ground together.</p> 
               <p>It knocked the wind out of her, but she didn't dare let it slow her down. She scrambled to her feet just as Eovath grabbed the long, heavy tabletop between them. With a grunt, he flipped it up off the trestles and sent it spinning at her.</p> 
               <p>She flung herself backward, and the makeshift weapon just missed her. Unfortunately, it couldn't miss all the incapacitated Blacklions sprawled on the ground. A woman cried out as the weight smashed down on her.</p> 
               <p>Kagur resisted the urge to look down and find out who it was. She kept her eyes on her foe.</p> 
               <p>Who, intentionally or not, had just cleared a larger space for the two of them to fight in. With bodies, severed limbs, benches, trays, drinking horns, and chunks of roast meat strewn about, the footing would be treacherous. But that was true of the rest of the tent as well, and maybe with a little more room to maneuver, Kagur could use her speed and agility to at least hold out until Dolok returned.</p> 
               <p>She glanced at a table next to the open space. She grabbed a long carving knife—it verged on being a proper weapon, even though it seemed like a bad joke compared to Eovath's axe—for her right hand and somebody else's eating knife for her left. Then she edged forward.</p> 
               <p>Her foster brother snorted. "Truly?" he asked.</p> 
               <p>She didn't bother to answer with words. She simply rushed in, and the axe whirled to meet her. She ducked the horizontal stroke and kept coming.</p> 
               <p>The low ceiling was already awkward for Eovath, and getting in close seemed the best way to further turn his size into a handicap. At that distance, big warriors had difficulty hitting smaller ones.</p> 
               <p>Or at least that was how it was supposed to work. But Eovath was an expert combatant, and after the hundreds of times they'd practiced together, he understood exactly what she was doing and why. He strove to keep his distance and, when she got close anyway, met her with elbow strikes and jabs with the butt of the axe. Meanwhile, his vest of boiled leather stopped her stabs and slashes from reaching his vitals. As often as not, the attacks failed to penetrate at all.</p> 
               <p>Eovath chopped at her head. She stepped back out of range, caught her ankle on something, and staggered, struggling not to fall.</p> 
               <p>The giant charged. The axe flashed at her, she twisted, and the weapon passed so near that it snagged in her mantle and ripped free.</p> 
               <p>Eovath hesitated, as if he imagined he'd actually struck her. Kagur recovered her balance and darted in. She stabbed his hip where the vest didn't cover and lunged on by.</p> 
               <p>He roared and whirled with blood already welling from the puncture. They glared at one another, circled, and then he let go of the axe with his left hand and gripped it with the right alone.</p> 
               <p>Evidently, Kagur decided, the knife still jutting from his left forearm was bothering him. At first, he'd scarcely seemed to notice the wound, but now it must be painful enough that he needed to let the damaged limb dangle.</p> 
               <p>Which meant Kagur should attack his left side. It would be harder for him to swing the axe across his body to hit or block her there. Only a little bit harder, but little advantages were all she had.</p> 
               <p>Pivoting, fixing her gaze on the crook of his right arm, she raised the carving knife as if for a throw. He sneered but also poised himself to bat the blade out of the air.</p> 
               <p>Instantly, she charged at his left flank. She'd cut even lower this time, hamstring him and dump him on the ground, then slash his throat as it came within reach.</p> 
               <p>She could see the sequence of events so vividly it was like it was already happening. Perhaps that was why it caught her so completely by surprise when Eovath's left arm, the one she'd thought useless, snapped into motion.</p> 
               <p>She tried to stop short, but it was too late. Looking like a sliver in his enormous hand, Eovath's dagger drove into her midsection. It didn't exactly hurt, but she felt a kind of shock all through her body, like she was made of shattering ceramic. She stumbled back and fell with the blade still buried inside her.</p> 
               <p>She struggled to understand what was happening, but it didn't make any sense. She was supposed to outwit and outfight Eovath, and he was supposed to fall down. Everything was the wrong way around.</p> 
               <p>She looked at the hilt of the dagger and realized she knew it well. Her father had fashioned it himself, carving it to look like a crouching cave lion and staining the pale bone dark. Then he'd presented it to Kagur to give to Eovath as a token indicating that the tribe now trusted him with weapons.</p> 
               <p>The giant gazed down at her with tears running down his cheeks, washing away the specks of gore that had splashed that high. "I'm sorry," he said.</p> 
               <p>She could see he meant it, that he truly did love her. Insane though it might be, she felt a surge of love in return. Somehow the emotion managed to well up inside her without in any way diminishing her horror, grief, and rage. She'd never known it was possible to feel so many different things at the same time.</p> 
               <p>She was still marveling at it when she glimpsed Dolok creeping up behind Eovath. Her lover had armed himself with a longsword and a round shield of wood covered in leather.</p> 
               <p>The sight of him cut through the daze her injury had engendered. She struggled to control her expression lest it change and so warn Eovath of the peril at his back.</p> 
               <p>Apparently, she managed it. Her foster brother just kept looking down at her and weeping. She felt a kind of vicious eagerness—another emotion to add to the stew—to see Dolok cut him down.</p> 
               <p>But the toe of Dolok's boot bumped a wooden cup lying amid the gory litter on the floor. The cup rolled and clicked against a platter.</p> 
               <p>It was a tiny sound, and Kagur insisted to herself that Eovath wouldn't hear it over the wail of the wind outside the tent. But he plainly did, for he started to pivot.</p> 
               <p>Dolok charged, and his sword flashed yellow in the firelight. Eovath finished turning just in time to parry the cut with his axe.</p> 
               <p>The giant struck back, and Dolok blocked with his shield. He had it angled to make the axe glance off, yet even so, Eovath's strength knocked him backward.</p> 
               <p>Eovath advanced and struck again immediately. Step by step, he pushed his opponent back. The relentless pressure kept Dolok from making many attacks of his own, and when he did, the axe deflected the sword with a clang of steel on steel.</p> 
               <p>I have to help, Kagur thought. I have to! But when she tried to stand, agony ripped through her middle and paralyzed her.</p> 
               <p>With his back nearly against the wall of the tent, Dolok finally landed a cut to Eovath's wrist. Then, at last, the frost giant faltered. At once, Dolok bellowed, feinted to the knee, then spun his sword up for a slash to the torso.</p> 
               <p>Undeceived, Eovath stepped in and brushed aside the true attack. Then, not even bothering to chop with the edge, he simply rammed the top of the axe into Dolok's face. Bone crunched, and the human flew backward into the wall of the tent, bounced back, and collapsed. Blood flowed out around his head.</p> 
               <p>When Eovath turned back around, his face was once again a mask of malice, without a trace of the love, regret, and perhaps even guilt Kagur had seen there previously. He was ready to finish off the rest of the tribe, and she was helpless to prevent it.</p> 
               <p>Or nearly helpless. She couldn't save anyone else, but if she played dead, perhaps he wouldn't feel the need to hack her to pieces.</p> 
               <p>She tried it, and rather to her surprise, it worked. Eovath didn't hurt her any further. But she still had to endure the thuds of the axe striking home, to listen to the occasional truncated cry or whimper without crying out and giving herself away.</p> 
               <p>She felt like the slaughter would never end. And in fact, she passed out before it did.</p>
