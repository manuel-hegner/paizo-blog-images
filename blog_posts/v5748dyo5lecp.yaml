  PTales\"></span></a> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">In Red Rune Canyon</h1> \n \
  \  <p>by Richard Lee Byers</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Divide and Conquer</h2> \n\
  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Kagur's legs turned soft as dough. She\
  \ collapsed to her knees, banging one on a stone. Eovath dropped beside her, and\
  \ the ghouls raised a hissing snarl to see the foes who'd humbled them brought low.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">But by the ever-thirsty blade of the Lord\
  \ in Iron, Kagur refused to be helpless. With a rasping snarl of her own, she pushed\
  \ chill and weakness—well, the greater part of them, anyway—out of her body by sheer\
  \ dint of will.</span></p> \n    <p>Which was good as far as it went, but instinct\
  \ told her the improvement would be fleeting if she kept looking at the demon's\
  \ batlike face. Somehow, it was the fiend's gaze that had debilitated her, and with\
  \ that still linking them, she sensed the creature focusing its mind for a second\
  \ assault. </p> \n    <p>With a fierce twist of her neck, she broke eye contact.\
  \ She scrambled back to her feet even as Eovath did the same. The demon hadn't succeeded\
  \ in slaying or crippling him, either. Poised to launch themselves forward, the\
  \ ghouls balked at their prey's sudden recovery.</p> \n    <p>Kagur laughed. Her\
  \ brother spat.</p> \n    <p>With a scream, the demon clenched its fist with such\
  \ vehemence that the long claws surely stabbed into its flesh.</p> \n    <p>Kagur\
  \ felt as if the air was thickening and sliding around her. She tried to spring\
  \ clear of what must be some sort of supernatural attack, but she was too slow.\
  \ Her limbs froze, locked in place as if her whole body were encased in ice. She\
  \ couldn't even make herself bellow in rage as the demon, wings lashing the air,\
  \ swept down from its perch toward them. Eovath swung his axe, but the demon jinked\
  \ nimbly out of range, then curved back to sink its filthy talons into the meat\
  \ of Kagur's shoulders.</p> \n    <p>Again, Kagur tried to shout something—anything—\
  but still her jaws betrayed her, leaving her to silently suffer the pain of the\
  \ intruding claws as they lifted her off the ground and up into the night sky. Below\
  \ her, Eovath roared curses, and in her mind Kagur matched them.</p> \n    <p>Yet\
  \ now she had bigger problems. As the ground retreated beneath her, she felt a sudden\
  \ surge of mingled rage and fear. Once the creature had lifted her high enough,\
  \ it need only drop her to kill her. And in her current paralyzed condition, she\
  \ wouldn't even be able to resist, just fall as placidly as a dropped stone until\
  \ the impact splattered her across the rocks of the canyon floor.</p> \n    <p>Yet\
  \ as the demon sailed over the ridge of the canyon's wall and down into a defile\
  \ on the other side, she felt a brief flare of hope. If it was descending, then\
  \ perhaps it meant to set her down safely—no doubt to better enjoy the pleasure\
  \ of killing her slowly.</p> \n    <p>Inwardly, Kagur smiled. All she asked was\
  \ that the demon's plans force it to release its spell over her before killing her.\
  \ Then she'd show it what a warrior of the Blacklions was made of. </p> \n    <p>Yet\
  \ though the demon did deposit her on the ground, in a section of twisting gorge\
  \ little different than the one from which it had extracted her, it didn't land\
  \ as well. Instead, it released her from her magical bonds as soon as her feet touched\
  \ the soil, then flapped back up out of reach. </p> \n    <p>Quick as a hunting\
  \ cat, Kagur drew her sword and threw, sending it lancing up into the sky after\
  \ the creature. Yet the fiend only laughed a grating laugh and rose higher, wings\
  \ snapping, and the sword passed harmlessly beneath its trailing claws. Within moments,\
  \ the beast had disappeared back over the canyon wall.</p> \n    <p>Kagur had no\
  \ idea why the creature hadn't killed her, but she assumed it had removed her from\
  \ the battlefield so Eovath would have to fight alone. She ran, retrieved her sword,\
  \ and then peered about, seeking an opening that would allow her to pass through\
  \ the wall at ground level.</p> \n    <p>There wasn't any. There was no way back\
  \ except to climb.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Nabasu.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> So this is the ghouls' master.\n    </div> \n    <p>She did so,\
  \ without hesitation, finding handholds and ledges to aid her ascent. But despite\
  \ her resolve, she was no experienced mountaineer, and the darkness further slowed\
  \ her progress. It immediately became obvious she'd never reach her brother in time\
  \ to help him.</p> \n    <p>Still, panting, fingers aching, denying herself all\
  \ but the briefest of rests, she struggled upward. Dawn found her atop the wall.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She peered down the other side and made out a scattering of ghoul bodies.\
  \ But Eovath was nowhere to be seen—not from the ridge, and not when she completed\
  \ a laborious descent.</p> \n    <p>Her jaw clenched as fury welled up inside her—\
  an admittedly familiar sensation. But it was different, too, because this time she\
  \ was angry with herself.</p> \n    <p>Borog had warned her and Eovath not to enter\
  \ Red Rune Canyon, but she'd been certain she knew better. And here was the result\
  \ of that brash overconfidence: her brother was lost. It made her want to scream,\
  \ or pummel her own body.</p> \n    <p>She took a long, deep breath instead. Now\
  \ was not the time for self-recrimination. She had to rescue Eovath before the demon\
  \ had a chance to do whatever it intended to do to him.</p> \n    <p>She stooped\
  \ beside the creek, scooped frigid water in her cupped hands, and slurped away the\
  \ raw, parched feeling in her throat. Then she strode to retrieve her bow and quiver.\
  \ Her path took her near one of the fallen ghouls, and the emaciated, gray-white\
  \ thing startled her by hissing.</p> \n    <p>She drew her sword to kill it, then\
  \ reconsidered. Last night, a ghoul had spoken. Maybe she could persuade this one\
  \ to speak to her now.</p> \n    <p>As she approached it, she saw it was the same\
  \ ghoul whose fingers she'd sliced off and whose leg she'd crippled. Then she caught\
  \ her breath as she noticed the blue and green beadwork adorning its deerskin tunic\
  \ and the two copper rings in the lobe of its pointed ear.</p> \n    <p>The undead\
  \ thing was Dron—or what was left of him. Fighting him in the dark, Kagur hadn't\
  \ realized, but it was so.</p> \n    <p>Which meant there'd never been any hope\
  \ of saving him. The realization brought another pang of self-disgust.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Pushing it out of her mind, she pointed her sword at the creature on the ground.\
  \ \"Do you know me?\"</p> \n    <p>Squinting against the morning light even though\
  \ little of it had as yet reached the floor of the canyon, Dron bared his fangs.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Talk,\" Kagur persisted. \"I know you can. Or I'll hurt you.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Know you,\" the ghoul rasped. \"Cut fingers. Cut knee.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Yes. But do you remember me from before that? From before you... changed?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The ghoul hesitated. \"Kagur.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's right, and you're\
  \ Dron. We hunted together. Tell me what happened to you.\"</p> \n    <p>Dron hesitated.\
  \ \"Can't. Master not like.\"</p> \n    <p>The living Dron had been loquacious and\
  \ clever. Repelled by the undead version's ugly form and noxious reek, Kagur nonetheless\
  \ felt a twinge of pity at his broken speech. His transformation had seemingly damaged\
  \ his mind as well as warping his body.</p> \n    <p>But compassion wouldn't get\
  \ her what she needed, so she set it aside and jabbed at the raw, spongy stumps\
  \ of Dron's severed fingers with the point of her longsword. The ghoul hissed, snatched\
  \ the maimed hand back, and covered it with his good one.</p> \n    <p>\"'Master'\
  \ isn't here,\" Kagur said. \"The demon abandoned you because you were crippled\
  \ and of no further use to it. I am here, and I swear by Gorum I'll keep cutting\
  \ pieces off you until you answer my questions.\"</p> \n    <p>Dron hesitated. Then:\
  \ \"Killers come. Demon eyes kill some hunters. Make me... this. Other ghouls kill\
  \ the rest. For meat.\" The undead creature lowered his eyes. \"Not want eat. But\
  \ did.\"</p> \n    <p>Kagur frowned. \"So... every time there's an attack, the demon\
  \ turns one victim into a ghoul. That's why there's always a body missing. But what's\
  \ the point? What does the demon want with ghouls?\"</p> \n    <p>Dron shook his\
  \ head, apparently to indicate he didn't actually know. But he did have an opinion:\
  \ \"Little demon. Wants be big demon.\"</p> \n    <p>In other words, to be a leader\
  \ like Kagur's father, or one of the Mammoth Lords who presided over the followings.\
  \ To command a following, or even a single tribe, one needed followers.</p> \n \
  \   <p>East of the tundra was the Worldwound, a land teeming with demons. People\
  \ said it was the wrongness of that place seeping through the earth that tainted\
  \ Red Rune Canyon. Maybe \"Master\" hailed from the Worldwound and meant to return\
  \ one day at the head of a war band of undead warriors.</p> \n    <p>Kagur caught\
  \ her breath as a ghastly possibility occurred to her. \"What about Eovath, then?\
  \ Is he gone because the demon changed him into a ghoul? You were here watching.\
  \ Tell me!\"</p> \n    <p>Dron shook his head. \"Giant strong. Not change yet.\"\
  \ He smirked as though enjoying Kagur's distress. \"But Master make him weak. Ghouls\
  \ drag him off. Master will change him.\"</p> \n    <p>Him and me, Kagur realized.\
  \ That was why the demon hadn't just dropped her from on high. Eovath and she had\
  \ both impressed it with their prowess, and it meant to add them both to the ranks\
  \ of its followers to replace the undead they'd destroyed.</p> \n    <p>She swallowed.\
  \ \"No. That won't happen because I won't let it. Now, you ghouls ambushed Eovath\
  \ and me without Master's permission. Why was that?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Told you. Hungry.\
  \ Too many ghouls, not enough meat.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Hm.\" She took stock and decided\
  \ she was nearly out of questions. \"Where is Master holding Eovath prisoner?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Cave. Probably.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're going to take me there.\"\
  \ It ought to be quicker and surer than trying to track the other ghouls, especially\
  \ since, by all accounts, the blighted land called Red Rune Canyon was actually\
  \ a confusing tangle of several interconnecting gorges.</p> \n    <p>Dron flinched.\
  \ \"No! Tell you the way!\"</p> \n    <p>\"And then what could I do about it if\
  \ it turned out you told me wrong? I need you with me so I can kill you if you try\
  \ to betray me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Can't walk!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I can fix that.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Kagur trotted back around the bend, slung her bow and quiver over\
  \ her shoulders, but left her pack where it sat lest it slow her down. She then\
  \ planted her foot atop the head of one of Eovath's javelins and pulled up on the\
  \ shaft until the steel point snapped away from it.</p> \n    <p>When she returned\
  \ to Dron, she tossed him the length of seasoned ash. \"Your crutch,\" she said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Fangs bared, the ghoul struggled up with the aid of the prop. \"Can't\
  \ do this!\"</p> \n    <p>\"You can,\" Kagur said, \"or I'll finish you off here\
  \ and now.\"</p> \n    <p>Hobbling, the ghoul turned and led her toward the deeper\
  \ recesses of the canyon. Alternately watching him for signs of treachery and scanning\
  \ her surroundings from other dangers, Kagur unbuckled her belt pouch by touch,\
  \ fished out the last few half-squashed bearberries, and popped them into her mouth.</p>\
