  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Kyra is a relatively\
  \ straightforward cleric, worshiping Sarenrae, the fiery goddess of the sun. While\
  \ much about the cleric is unchanged, there are a number of notable alterations.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>First off is a change to how domains work. In the Beta version of the\
  \ rules, the domains lost their bonus spells and gained a host of special abilities\
  \ that were gained when the cleric reached certain levels. For the final version\
  \ of the game, we went back to bonus spells, but we altered the spell lists a bit\
  \ (you might notice <i>fireball</i> in her 3rd-level list of spells prepared). In\
  \ addition, we kept some of the special abilities, replacing many of the granted\
  \ powers. Kyra receives fire bolt and sun's blessing at 1st level. Fire bolt allows\
  \ her to shoot rays of fire a limited number of times per day. The sun's blessing\
  \ power adds to Kyra's channel energy ability and prevents undead from adding their\
  \ turn resistance to their saves to resist her channeled energy (but more on how\
  \ this works in a bit). At 6th level, the fire domain grants Kyra fire resistance\
  \ (that increases as she gains levels). At 8th level she gains the nimbus of light\
  \ ability from the sun domain. This powerful ability allows her to shed light like\
  \ <i>daylight</i> for a number of rounds per day equal to her cleric level. This\
  \ dispels any darkness effect and deals damage to undead in the area at the beginning\
  \ of Kyra's turn (1 point per cleric level per round). The light spells themselves\
  \ got a bit of an overhaul. There are now four levels of illumination: darkness,\
  \ dim light, normal light, and bright light. Spells like <i>light</i> shed normal\
  \ light in a set radius and increase the light level by one step in a set area beyond\
  \ that. Spells like <i>darkness</i> reduce the light level in a set radius. <i>Deeper\
  \ darkness</i> can actually make an area so dark that not even darkvision can penetrate\
  \ it.</p> \n    <p>In addition to the changes to domains, the turn undead rules\
  \ have been revised as well. Now called channel energy, this ability releases a\
  \ wave of positive or negative energy in a 30-foot radius. When Kyra uses this ability\
  \ she much choose to heal living creatures or to harm undead creatures (in the Beta\
  \ rules, she could do both simultaneously). If she chooses to heal, all living creatures\
  \ in the area are healed the listed amount (4d6 in this case). If she chooses to\
  \ harm undead, all undead in the area take the listed damage (4d6+8 in this case,\
  \ due to her sun's blessing domain ability), but they receive a save for half damage.\
  \ Evil clerics can use this power in reverse, to harm living creatures or heal undead\
  \ creatures. Kyra also has a few feats to enhance her channel energy ability. Improved\
  \ Channel adds +2 to the DC to resist the channel and Selective Channel allows Kyra\
  \ to exclude a number of targets in her area equal to her Charisma modifier. The\
  \ big change here though is the Turn Undead feat. This feat allows Kyra to spend\
  \ one use of her Channel Energy ability to force undead to flee from her unless\
  \ they make their save. This version does not deal damage, but it can turn the tide\
  \ in a battle. </p> \n    <p>There have also been a number of changes to cleric\
  \ spells. Many of these were made to balance the cleric with some of the other classes\
  \ or to otherwise simplify a confusing spell. <i>Death ward</i>, for example, no\
  \ longer grants blanket immunity to death effects. Instead it grants bonuses to\
  \ resist such affects and gives you a save even if one is not normally allowed.\
  \ It also removes the penalties from negative levels while it lasts. <i>Divine Power</i>\
  \ was significantly altered to prevent the cleric from becoming a better melee fighter\
  \ than the fighter with just a spell or two. Now the spell grants a bonus to attacks\
  \ and damage rolls, temporary hit points, and an additional attack whenever the\
  \ cleric makes a full attack (just like <i>haste</i>). While it is still a good\
  \ spell, it is no longer overpowering. <i>Remove curse</i> also deserves a bit of\
  \ inspection. This spell (and those like it that remove ailments) is no longer automatic.\
  \ When casting one of these spells, Kyra must succeed at a caster level check to\
  \ remove the condition (using the ailment's DC). The goal here was to add some bite\
  \ back into curses, diseases, and poisons, which have been a trivial concern past\
  \ 5th level.</p> \n    <p>Last, but not least, it is time to talk about casting\
  \ on the defensive. The Concentration skill was removed from the game in one of\
  \ the early versions and there have been a number of systems proposed to replace\
  \ it. In the final game, whenever a spellcaster is called upon to make such a check,\
  \ he adds his caster level and whatever ability score is used to determine his spell\
  \ DCs. To avoid confusion, we kept the old name, calling it a concentration check.\
  \ This really is the simplest solution that avoids a skill tax on all spellcasters\
  \ and does not favor one class over another (due to the variable ability score modifier\
  \ that is added). When casting on the defensive, the DC is equal to 15 + double\
  \ the spell's level. This makes it a little harder to cast on the defensive than\
  \ it was, but that works to help balance out the spellcasters a bit (especially\
  \ when you consider new feats that allow enemies to move with you if you attempt\
  \ to 5-foot step away to cast a spell). </p> \n    <p>That is about all there is\
  \ to show here on Kyra. Next week we are laying our hands on the mighty and powerful\
  \ Seelah, the iconic paladin.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead Designer</p> \n\
