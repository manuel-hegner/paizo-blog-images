  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello, all! I’m here to steal\
  \ the blog from Luis Loza this week because he can’t be allowed to have <em>all</em>\
  \ the cool new dragons that are dropping with the upcoming releases of <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq0e3k3?Pathfinder-Monster-Core-2\"><em>Pathfinder Monster\
  \ Core 2</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0e5vf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Draconic-Codex\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Draconic Codex</em></a>. Dragons are for everyone! Though,\
  \ er, the people who get their villages burned down may not appreciate that.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Back at Paizocon, some people asked me for a hint about one of the new\
  \ dragons coming in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Draconic Codex</em>, and I said it\
  \ was something <em>sharp</em>. Allow me to introduce our brand new, <em>very </em>sharp\
  \ dragon: the vorpal dragon!</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9aae1d3e-56ee-4710-b218-923e9432efc2/Vorpal_Dragon_Concept_3000.jpg\"\

  \ width=\"90%\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"Vorpal Dragon Concept, artist Kent\
  \ Hamilton: A sketch design of a vorpal dragon, a steel-colored dragon with overlapping\
  \ sharpened scales. It has hooked blades for forearms and a huge, sharpened blade\
  \ jutting out from its chin.\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Vorpal\
  \ Dragon concept art by Kent Hamilton.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Vorpal\
  \ dragons are arcane dragons and manifestations of sharpening magic. The first vorpal\
  \ dragon sprung forth from a <em>vorpal sword</em> after it struck the head off\
  \ a jabberwocky, so vorpal dragons have a very storied pedigree, and just like the\
  \ blades from which they take their name, they’re infamous for being able to slice\
  \ the heads off their foes with a single snicker-snack! That said, the younger dragons\
  \ don’t have complete control of their magic. When they slice off someone’s head,\
  \ the person doesn’t die, and their victim can even pick their head up and put it\
  \ back on pretty easily, assuming the dragon doesn’t get to it first and fly off\
  \ with it. Adult vorpal dragons retain this ability, and more genial ones tend to\
  \ cut the heads of would-be dragonslayers without killing them, the better to teach\
  \ them a lesson.</p>\n      <p>Vorpal dragons don't blast dangerous magical energies\
  \ from their throats like many of their cousins. Instead, they inhale, draining\
  \ blood from people in the area, which inflicts void damage on their targets. Worse\
  \ yet, anyone who is bleeding when the vorpal dragon inhales also takes their current\
  \ persistent bleed damage, as they’re a nice and juicy feast for the dragon!</p>\n\
  \      <p>Luis also mentioned the coral dragon, which appears in <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Monster Core 2</em>. Fortunately, it also appears in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens\
  \ Draconic Codex</em>, so I can show it off!</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ director (and star dragon concept artist) Kent Hamilton’s favorite dragons, and\
  \ it’s easy to see why! These dragons are <em>gorgeous</em>, and they know it. While\
  \ few people would call any dragon humble, coral dragons are obsessed with their\
  \ appearances in a manner notable even among their kin. Funnily enough, this means\
  \ that coral dragons who are not so conventionally attractive tend to be luckier\
  \ in finding a mate, as they’re less prone to provoking jealousy in their peers.</p>\n\
  \      <p>(As the great sage Jimmy Soul says: If you want to be happy for the rest\
  \ of your life, never make a pretty dragon your wife.)</p>\n      <p>The oldest\
  \ and most powerful coral dragons are so beautiful that anyone who looks at them\
  \ risks losing their senses among the dazzling patterns of the dragon’s coral reefs.\
  \ A very unlucky adventurer might even lose their sight entirely, as they’re caught\
  \ up in a school of colorful fish that blocks their vision. At least it’s a lovely\
  \ way to go?</p>\n      <p>That’s it for the dragons this week! Look forward to\
  \ more previews from Creative Director Luis Loza and myself, and be sure to pick\
  \ up the books so you can see all our beautiful dragons!</p>\n      <p>Next week’\
  s blog answers the age-old question: What’s black and white and red all over?</p>\n\
