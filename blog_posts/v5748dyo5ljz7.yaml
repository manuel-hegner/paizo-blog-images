  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">This month marks the conclusion\
  \ of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion\">Ironfang Invasion</a>,\
  \ and even as I type, issues of <a href=\"/products/btpy9tri?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-120-Vault-of-the-Onyx-Citadel\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #120: Vault of the Onyx Citadel</em></a> are being\
  \ furiously packaged and shipped by our warehouse raptors. Some of you may already\
  \ have them in your dice-stained hands. We finally get to see what makes Azaersi\
  \ tick, and what sort of danger her sly inner circle truly present. Your heros will\
  \ (hopefully) slay the \"witch worm\" Zanathura (again) as well as the Ironfang\
  \ Commanders, Kraelos and Azlowe as they explore a pocket of the Plane of Earth\
  \ originally mastered by the ancient xiomorn, and left abandoned with its mysteries\
  \ and powerful artifacts intact. Hopefully you all have as much fun killing everything\
  \ as the authors and I had breathing life into them.</p> \n    <p>Developing this\
  \ AP was a hell of a journey that helped my skills travel almost as far as your\
  \ PCs will. I learned that sometimes you need to make a giant mess on an office\
  \ wall with sticky notes before you can make a complex system work, and that greater\
  \ barghests are a lot bigger than I realized. I also learned that my fellow developer,\
  \ Amanda Hamon Kuntz is a sick little monkey. Traditionally, the AP developer uses\
  \ this blog to mention their favorite thing from the six volumes, but my authors\
  \ did some amazing work all around, and I don't think I have a favorite. There are\
  \ too many weird characters and bizarre encounters, and my brain is too leaky from\
  \ years of drinking and traumatic head injury to really have a favorite thing for\
  \ more than five minutes. I will say that I'm pretty happy with the art; we gave\
  \ the art team some really strange requests—from balding bugbears to morlock matriarchs—\
  and their artists delivered.</p> \n    <p>I also learned in this six-month process\
  \ that I am not—counter to what the internet tells me—infallible. I have in fact\
  \ fallibled. I fallibled so hard, you guys. Sometimes it was little things, like\
  \ not remembering when I swapped a character's name out or whether they were called\
  \ \"onyx towers\" or \"obsidian towers.\" Thank the dark gods for editors or else\
  \ it would have been a lot worse. But there's one glaring omission: The <i>onyx\
  \ key</i> itself. I never included a statblock for the macguffin that powers the\
  \ entire campaign! In early volumes, I decided that since it largely acted as a\
  \ plot device that the PCs wouldn't interact with, we could leave off a statblock\
  \ until later volumes. But by the time we reached said later volumes, I knew that\
  \ surely I'd included the statblock in the first adventure (it was would be asinine\
  \ not to, I think you'll agree).</p> \n    <p>Now that your players are ready to\
  \ kick General Azaersi's butt and take her stuff, here at last is the statblock\
  \ for the <i>onyx key</i>:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ><i>This jagged growth of crystal pulses with warm pink and range hues. Carvings\

  \ \n      <p><i>Illustration by Miguel Regodón Harkness</i></p>\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block\">Though deceptively small, the <i>onyx key</i> is a\
  \ powerful artifact that serves as the focus and control mechanism for the vast\
  \ dimensional energies collected by the xiomorn facility called the Onyx Citadel.\
  \ The citadel itself maintains a complex network of extradimensional tunnels known\
  \ as the Stone Roads—once used by the xiomorns to travel across the Plane of Earth—\
  and allows this network to bridge into other planes, granting its user the power\
  \ to move resources or entire armies. Eight shards of black crystal grow from the\
  \ <i>onyx key</i>'s base, and may be broken off as a standard action. If an onyx\
  \ shard is plunged into natural earth or stone as a full-round action, it begins\
  \ rumbling and grows into a thirty-foot spire of translucent black stone with an\
  \ archway in its base. The tower's archways can be commanded to open an extradimensional\
  \ tunnel to the archway of any other onyx tower no the same plane. The tower requires\
  \ a full thirty seconds to grow. A Stone Road opened between two towers is typically\
  \ a 100-foot stone tunnel, but as with many elements of xiomorn magic this is far\
  \ from certain, and gates may occasionally run far longer, with smaller side passageways\
  \ leading off into the unknown.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">A crystalline\
  \ matrix—a network of circles and imbedded stones—embedded in each spire may be\
  \ manipulated to open and close the tower's connection to other towers, destroying\
  \ it, or restructure the tower's design. Linking to another tower requires a successful\
  \ DC 25 Knowledge (geography) check, reshaping the tower requires a successful Knowledge\
  \ (engineering) or Use Magic Device skill check, with the DC ranging from 20 for\
  \ simple additions, such as stairways or a single room—to 35 or higher for sophisticated\
  \ layouts or defenses. Open or closing the tower's connection to the Stone Roads\
  \ takes a standard action, while inputting changes requires one minute of work and\
  \ 1d4 weeks for the tower to slowly make the appropriate alterations to itself.\
  \ Destroying the tower requires a successful DC 35 Knowledge (engineering) or Use\
  \ Magic Device check and a full 36 rounds to activate. A tower's footprint cannot\
  \ exceed 120 feet on a side, and cannot grow taller than 80 feet.</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block\">In addition to the nine black shards, a single <i>sardonyx\
  \ shard</i> grows from the <i>onyx key</i>'s base. This shard cannot be used to\
  \ grow a tower, but instead may be installed in an existing tower to augment its\
  \ power, allowing it to open a Stone Road to the Onyx Citadel itself, or connect\
  \ to onyx towers on other planes.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">Whoever possesses\
  \ the <i>onyx key</i> itself may mentally destroy an existing onyx tower as a full-round\
  \ action, but cannot destroy a shard that hasn't yet been transformed into a tower,\
  \ nor the sardonyx shard if it hasn't been installed in a tower. Once a tower is\
  \ destroyed, its corresponding onyx shard regrows from the <i>onyx key</i> over\
  \ the next month.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-breaker\">Destruction</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block\">The eight onyx shards of the <i>onyx key</i> must\
  \ be planted in the eight ends of the Stone Road, stretching itself magic thin,\
  \ while the <i>onyx key</i> itself is cast into the Storm of Fangs on the Plane\
  \ of Air.</p> \n     <h3 class=\"spaced-header-small\">History</h3> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block\">While the Stone Road predates the <i>onyx key</i>—the Onyx Citadel\
  \ and other hubs of xiomorn science already capable to opening gates to this network—\
  the artifact gave its ancient creators the gift of mobility and the power to leap\
  \ the dimensional barrier with ease, expanding their experimentation to new worlds.\
  \ As the xiomorn withdrew from Golarion, they left the <i>onyx key</i>, alongside\
  \ many other treasures, in a sacred stronghold in the Darklands layer of Orv.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">The artifact entered the modern history of Golarion\
  \ when it was discovered by the dwarven explorer Kraggodan, who followed strange\
  \ whispers in the earth to the vast treasures the xiomorn left behind. Using the\
  \ onyx towers as a series of ever-advancing strongholds, Kraggodan and his clan\
  \ completed their Quest for Sky swiftly and with minimum casualties—most notable\
  \ Kraggodan himself, who died defending his people from the orcish hordes—and the\
  \ clan named the city they founded in honor of their late savior. Once settled in,\
  \ the dwarves began to experiment with the <i>onyx key</i> in hopes of understanding\
  \ its powerful magic, and instead opened a Stone Road to the Vault of the Onyx Citadel,\
  \ allowing all manner of outsiders to flood through and devastate their population.\
  \ Wary of a similar tragic mistake, they sealed the artifact in a sacred vault dedicated\
  \ to their people's history, safely locked away from curious hands.</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block\">And there the <i>onyx key</i> stayed for thousands of years,\
  \ largely forgotten by all but a few, until it was stolen by the hobgoblin warlord\
  \ Azaersi, beginning the events of the Ironfang Invasion.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
