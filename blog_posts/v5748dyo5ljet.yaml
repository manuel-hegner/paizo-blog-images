  \    <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"/products/btpy9qcq\">Issue #3 of Pathfinder\
  \ Worldscape</a>, Dynamite's blockbuster all-star sword &amp; sorcery supergroup\
  \ crossover, hits newsstands TODAY, so I figured now would be a perfect time to\
  \ peel back the curtain a bit and let you know about some of the decisions that\
  \ went into the Pathfinder RPG rules appendix found in the back of the issue.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This month's appendix is a bit of a doozy because the issue's story features\
  \ the first appearance of one of the major stars of the series, John Carter of Mars!\
  \ The great Virginian steps onto our pages to join the likes of his green Martian\
  \ ally Tars Tarkas, the she-devil Red Sonja, Frank Frazetta's jungle hero Thun'da,\
  \ and more (to say nothing of Pathfinder stalwarts Valeros, Kyra, Merisiel, and\
  \ Seoni).</p> \n    <p>Of all Worldscape's superstars, John Carter's star shines\
  \ the brightest in the firmament of fantasy literature. Carter first appeared way\
  \ back in February, 1912, in a serialized story entitled \"Under the Moons of Mars,\"\
  \ by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The story appeared as a novel entitled A Princess of\
  \ Mars, in 1917, and it's been in print ever since.</p> \n    <p>Carter helped to\
  \ define the \"formula\" for adventure story heroes (especially in a science fictional\
  \ setting). He and Burroughs's Barsoom (Mars) also launched an entire sub-genre\
  \ of fiction that arguably includes stories like Star Wars, but absolutely 1000%\
  \ includes stories like James Cameron's Avatar, which borrows heavily from the tropes\
  \ established in \"Under the Moons of Mars.\" </p> \n    <p>Like many of the sub-genres\
  \ we're touching on in Pathfinder Worldscape (including mainline \"sword &amp; sorcery\"\
  \ and especially jungle adventure stories), the heroes of \"sword &amp; planet\"\
  \ stories present an interesting challenge for the Pathfinder RPG, because none\
  \ of them ever wears a scrap of armor. Indeed, John Carter's world probably reveals\
  \ more flesh on a regular basis than even the Tarzan stories and their various knock-offs,\
  \ which star a guy wearing a loincloth.</p> \n    <p>So, as I did with the sword-devil\
  \ archetype in <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\">Pathfinder Worldscape #1</a> (which\
  \ covered Red Sonja, so to speak), this month's appendix presents a brand new archetype\
  \ called the warlord that allows players to run around in their briefs and kick\
  \ just as much ass as John Carter did without a massive sacrifice to their Armor\
  \ Class. From my perspective, it really stinks when the rules don't allow you to\
  \ play a concept you want to try out, or even worse punish you for it. This archetype\
  \ (and really all of the rules presented over Worldscape's six issues) creates new\
  \ space for players to play heroes like Red Sonja, John Carter, or Tarzan without\
  \ getting hit multiple times every round. The Pathfinder rules don't really handle\
  \ characters wearing no armor and going toe-to-toe with monsters and fully armored\
  \ enemies.</p> \n    <p>At least not until this series, that is. If I accomplish\
  \ nothing else from writing all of the stories and appendices for this series, I\
  \ hope that Pathfinder Worldscape develops a reputation as the <em>Catcher in the\
  \ Rye</em> of no-armor martial archetypes.</p> \n    <p>The warlord is a fighter\
  \ archetype, a particularly challenging breed of archetype because, unlike so many\
  \ other classes, the fighter doesn't have a ton of class features to \"swap out\"\
  \ as most other classes do. That's partially by design. When we sat down to create\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em></a>,\
  \ we thought it very important to include at least one class that was easy to understand\
  \ and easy to play. The fighter has traditionally played that role, so we carried\
  \ that forward into the final Pathfinder rules. This was, of course, a year or two\
  \ before we came up with the idea for archetypes, so only after their introduction\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</em></a>\
  \ did we realize that this might turn out to be a bit of a problem.</p> \n    <p>That's\
  \ the reason that you don't see as many fighter archetypes as you see for other\
  \ classes. There just isn't as much design room to make interesting options.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The class isn't without ANY options, of course, but things are a bit\
  \ more challenging. I knew this going in, but I didn't really care. John Carter\
  \ is obviously a fighter. One of his books is called <em>A Fighting Man of Mars</em>,\
  \ for Pete's sake. So I had to make him a fighter archetype, design space or not!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/johncarter.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/johncarter_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First off, I modified the fighter's usual class skills\
  \ to include Barsoomian staples Acrobatics and Knowledge (nobility), which replace\
  \ Swim (not super useful on a desert planet) and Knowledge (dungeoneering). Fair\
  \ trade, in my book.</p> \n    <p>Barsoom doesn't offer the same sort of weapon\
  \ options we have here on Earth, so I significantly tailored the class's proficiency\
  \ list to include only weapons that appear in the John Carter comics and novels,\
  \ including the radium pistol and rifle included in the RPG appendix for <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9oza\">Pathfinder Worldscape #2</a>. This helps to keep warlord characters\
  \ \"on model\" and representative of the way they appear in the source material,\
  \ which is the overall goal of these adaptations.</p> \n    <p>The most important\
  \ power the warlord has is likely Evasive Dueling, which allows a warlord to add\
  \ a +1 dodge bonus to his AC in lieu of one of the MANY bonus feats fighters get\
  \ throughout their careers. This means that the player gets to decide how important\
  \ AC is to his warlord, and doesn't deny him the opportunity to drop some bonus\
  \ feats into his weapons or other combat abilities. He can always come back for\
  \ some more Armor Class when he really needs it.</p> \n    <p>And in case he needs\
  \ more AC (which he will, because he's not even proficient in armor and a lot of\
  \ his powers don't work when he's wearing it), I also created a power called Battle\
  \ Bravado, which (at 3rd level) allows the warlord to add his Charisma bonus to\
  \ his AC when unarmored and unencumbered, so long as he is not wearing armor or\
  \ carrying a Medium or heavier load. This power even comes with a few more dodge\
  \ bonuses spread out over the full 20 levels.</p> \n    <p>He also gets some weapon\
  \ type-specific modifications to Weapon Training, and by the time he hits 19th level,\
  \ he unlocks DR/5, the benefit of a life spent surviving against impossible odds\
  \ in a hostile world.</p> \n    <p>So there you have it, a broad overview of the\
  \ warlord archetype from <a href=\"/products/btpy9qcq\"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape\
  \ #3</em></a>! You can order your copy from paizo.com right now, or you can pick\
  \ up a copy in person at your game store.</p> \n    <p>To make sure you never miss\
  \ an issue of Pathfinder Worldscape, consider <a href=\"/products/btpy8tvw\">setting\
  \ up an ongoing Pathfinder Comics subscription</a> today.</p> \n    <p>I'll be back\
  \ in two weeks with a look at John Carter himself. Until then, keep rolling 20s!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Happy holidays to you all!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
