  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The playtest of the new version\
  \ of Pathfinder is well underway, and with it comes a variety of changes to the\
  \ game and how it works. There are a number of parts of the game that we're looking\
  \ at for revision, but we want to get a bit more data in on them first. Signature\
  \ skills, ancestry benefits, and multiclassing archetypes are all under review,\
  \ and some of these systems might need additional testing before the playtest process\
  \ is over. As we get closer, we'll let you know what changes you can expect to see.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>While we're on the topic, it's important to note that there will be other\
  \ parts of the game we'll be changing between now and the final version, but that\
  \ some of these parts aren't really very practical for us to test. Take the introduction\
  \ to the book, for example. From all your early feedback, we've realized a number\
  \ of ways in which this chapter could be improved, from including more examples\
  \ to reorganizing some of the information to help folks learning the game. The team\
  \ is already hard at work figuring out a better structure for the chapter and we\
  \ feel that when you get the final version, the results of your feedback will really\
  \ show.</p> \n    <p>While I have your attention, there's a matter of presentation\
  \ that we're contemplating changing, but we want your thoughts before we do. It\
  \ has to do with saving throws. Currently, there are a lot of spells and effects\
  \ in the game that look something like this.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-title\">Fireball <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Spell 3</span></p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Evocation, Fire</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Casting </b>[[A]] Somatic Casting, [[A]] Verbal Casting</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Range</b> 500 feet;<b> Area</b> 20-foot burst</p> \n     <hr style=\"\
  margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">A burst of fire explodes,\
  \ dealing 6d6 fire damage; creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Success</b> The creature takes half damage.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Critical Success</b> The creature is unaffected.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Failure</b> The creature takes full damage.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Critical Failure</b> The creature takes double\
  \ damage.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Heightened (+1)</b> The damage\
  \ increases by 2d6.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The degrees of success for\
  \ the saving throw are pretty common throughout the spells chapter. In fact, they're\
  \ so common that we thought it might make sense to simplify the process a bit. So,\
  \ if a spell or effect is one where you take half damage on a success, take no damage\
  \ on a critical success, take full damage on a failure, and take double on a critical\
  \ failure, we're contemplating calling that a basic saving throw. Using this sort\
  \ of scheme, <i>fireball </i>might look like this.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Fireball <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Spell 3</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Evocation, Fire</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Casting </b>[[A]] Somatic Casting, [[A]] Verbal Casting</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Range</b> 500 feet;<b> Area</b> 20-foot burst</p> \n     <hr style=\"\
  margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">A burst of fire explodes,\
  \ dealing 6d6 fire damage to creatures in the area, depending on their basic Reflex\
  \ saves.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Heightened (+1)</b> The damage\
  \ increases by 2d6.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>That version is a lot cleaner\
  \ and it takes up quite a bit less space, but this would be another term that players\
  \ and GMs would need to learn. What do you think of this kind of approach? Let us\
  \ know in the comments below whether or not basic saves are a thing you want to\
  \ see in Pathfinder.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p>\
