  \ subscribers have begun digging their claws into <a href=\"/products/btpy9tok?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Book of the Damned</em></a>. What vile and wicked things might\
  \ they find within its covers?</p> \n    <p>While much of the book contains information\
  \ on the fiendish movers and shakers of the outer planes and their horrid and terrifying\
  \ realms, I know that many of you want a glimpse at some of the rules found in the\
  \ <em>Book of the Damned</em>. Some of the strongest fiends in the planes have risen\
  \ to become fiendish divinities. This includes archdevils, demon lords, daemonic\
  \ horsemen, and others. Fifty of these fiendish divinities receive full information\
  \ on their fiendish boons that work with the Fiendish Obedience feat and the associated\
  \ prestige classes. In addition, the demoniac, diabolist, and souldrinker have all\
  \ been updated to work with these boons as well, and Book of the Damned includes\
  \ a sidebar that provides additional guidance.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Fiendish\
  \ Divinity Boons</h3> \n     <p>The boons granted by fiendish divinities assume\
  \ that characters gain them in one of two ways—via the Fiendish Obedience feat (see\
  \ page 178) or via that feat plus one of the three prestige classes presented on\
  \ pages 208-213. While the boons of each divinity are categorized into the same\
  \ three categories of boons used in <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods</em>,\
  \ the boons granted by deities in that book are less powerful, as they are more\
  \ likely to be boons gained by PCs, and thus it’s more appropriate for them to be\
  \ gained at earlier levels.</p> \n     <p>While the Hit Dice at which you gain boons\
  \ via Fiendish Obedience or Deific Obedience (from <em>Inner Sea Gods</em>) are\
  \ identical, the prestige classes in <em>Inner Sea Gods</em> (the evangelist, exalted,\
  \ and sentinel) that allow accelerated boon achievement have lower entrance requirements\
  \ than the prestige classes in this book. As a result, if you wish to use one of\
  \ those three prestige classes for a character who wishes to gain the boons presented\
  \ by one of the fiendish divinities in this book, increase the requirements for\
  \ entry into evangelist, exalted, or sentinel so that a character must be 7th level\
  \ before selecting the class, as summarized below.</p> \n     <p><b>Evangelist</b>:\
  \ Base attack bonus +7, 7 ranks in a skill other than Knowledge (religion), or ability\
  \ to cast 4th-level spells.</p> \n     <p><b>Exalted</b>: Diplomacy 7 ranks, Knowledge\
  \ (religion) 7 ranks, ability to cast 4th-level divine spells.</p> \n     <p><b>Sentinel</b>:\
  \ Base attack bonus +7.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The third chapter of <em>Book\
  \ of the Damned</em> has more rules mechanics to help a GM run a game dripping with\
  \ fiendish influence. It contains feats to help you add new and exciting abilities\
  \ to your villains and fiends, spells and rituals to spice things up, information\
  \ on infernal contracts, and evil magic items, talismans, and artifacts—including\
  \ the <em>Book of the Damned</em> itself!</p> \n    <p>The final chapter in the\
  \ book presents a new fiend of each type, as well as statistics for petitioners\
  \ in each fiendish realm: The damned of Hell, the hunted of Abaddon, larva from\
  \ the Abyss, the mutilated of the Shadow Plane, the prey of the Material, and the\
  \ terrorized of the Ethereal.</p> \n    <p>The new fiends in the <em>Book of the\
  \ Damned</em> are as follows:</p> \n    <table class=\"table-spacing-large\">\n\
