  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Caron braced herself against the\
  \ uneven rock, staring down at an impossible sight.</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">She didn't know what she'd expected to find down here—some rat-infested\
  \ lair, a warren of caves with dripping stalactites, lichen smeared walls, maybe\
  \ a subterranean river winding through the cavernous space, but not this. Not what\
  \ looked like the foundations of... of what? She stared down at what looked like\
  \ some monstrous outpost and for the first time since stepping into the darkness\
  \ was truly terrified.</span></p> \n    <p>Spires of stone rose toward what should\
  \ have been the sky, the twisted columns supporting the overbearing weight of the\
  \ cavern's roof. Lights burned in a few windows, like tears on the face of the rock\
  \ walls where the oil burners lit the workplace. She watched as dozens of shadows\
  \ swarmed over the scaffolds like ants. She knew where the children had gone; they\
  \ hadn't been slaughtered for food, but were being used as slave labor down here,\
  \ worked until they dropped, useless. Only then would they become meat for the shadow\
  \ men.</p> \n    <p>It was all of her worst nightmares brought to horrific life.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The pit opened up as it descended, its circumference growing wider and\
  \ wider as the shaft plunged all the way down into the depths. It was cold, too,\
  \ colder than she'd ever imagined possible with no wind.</p> \n    <p>The air was\
  \ dead in her lungs.</p> \n    <p>She was still above the outpost, looking down\
  \ on the slack-skinned slaves as they worked mindlessly carving the stones, lifting,\
  \ carrying until their knees buckled and the inevitable moment when the shadow men\
  \ fell upon them. Somewhere among them was Caleb. She prayed that he was, like she'd\
  \ never prayed for anything before in her life. The fact that they needed the slaves\
  \ meant she had a chance of fulfilling her promise to her husband.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ crept closer, working her way down.</p> \n    <p>More than once she had the unshakeable\
  \ feeling she was being watched.</p> \n    <p>From one of these openings she caught\
  \ sight of something glinting; something that could have been a pair of eyes.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The opening was barely wide enough for her to climb inside—not that she\
  \ wanted to.</p> \n    <p>She tried not to think about it.</p> \n    <p>The noises\
  \ from below grew louder the further she descended, the sound of metal against stone\
  \ echoing up around her toward the surface. It wasn't fighting she'd heard; it was\
  \ the sound of industry.</p> \n    <p>Now she was sure something was watching her\
  \ as she descended.</p> \n    <p>Whatever it was, it had to be smaller than the\
  \ shadow men, but that didn't mean it was any less dangerous.</p> \n    <p>Caron\
  \ pressed herself tight against the rock, feeling sharp edges dig into her back,\
  \ and waited for a moment, no more than an arm's length from the opening.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Another flurry of dust and grit slid from the edge.</p> \n    <p>She moved\
  \ quickly, trusting that she wouldn't lose her footing on the wooden slats, and\
  \ reached into the tunnel with one hand.</p> \n    <p>Her fingers closed on leathery\
  \ flesh, her grip causing whatever it was to squeal in surprise.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ clutched the thing tightly and hauled it from the safety of the tunnel, wary of\
  \ snapping teeth or snatching claws. Looking at the creature's miserable hide, she\
  \ found it difficult to imagine it posed any kind of threat. It stood less than\
  \ half of her height, its body a pale leathery gray that had never seen the sunlight.\
  \ The creature's hands—grubby black hands with clawed fingers—looked good for clawing\
  \ through the earth. Its eyes blinked hard at her in the feeble light, unused to\
  \ even this pale brightness. It wasn't a creature at all, she realized. It was a\
  \ boy, but he'd been down here so long he'd lost almost all semblance of humanity.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Please,\" it wheedled in a high-pitched voice loaded with fear.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She pulled it so close she barely needed to whisper: \"Did they bring\
  \ a boy this way?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The urdefhans?\" he said, stretching out the\
  \ word. So that's what they were.</p> \n    <p>She nodded.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> Even her worst nightmares come to life won't stop Caron.\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>The youth nodded rapidly. \"I saw them, I saw them.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Did they have a boy with them?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes. Yes. Down and down. They took\
  \ him. Working now. Digging. Digging. Always digging. That's what they do with them.\
  \ Work, work, until they can't work no more. Then they eat them.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Show me,\" she said.</p> \n    <p>Keeping a tight grip on his hand, she followed\
  \ the ragged boy down deeper into the pit, struggling to keep an eye on both him\
  \ and the outpost for signs of danger. She had the urdefhan's two-bladed sword,\
  \ and was ready to use it if the pathetic thing turned on her. She certainly wasn't\
  \ about to trust him. Caron had no intention of dying down here. She was going to\
  \ get Caleb back to his father.</p> \n    <p>They reached another landing, still\
  \ high above the outpost, yet to descend below the stone sky. Caron knew she couldn't\
  \ hope to hold the boy captive all the way down. The climb was impossible. \"Don't\
  \ make a sound,\" she said.</p> \n    <p>He nodded eagerly, glancing at the sword\
  \ in her hand. There was fear etched on his gaunt features, but whether it was of\
  \ her, the sword, or the urdefhans, she had no way of knowing. All she could hope\
  \ was that the blade wouldn't be put to the test.</p> \n    <p>The lights were closer\
  \ now. This was clearly the last landing before the stairway reached the ground\
  \ below. From here she could see the shadow men and the slaves moving like a wave\
  \ of blackness between the lights.</p> \n    <p>\"Stay close.\" The boy pointed\
  \ down with a clawlike hand. \"This way the urdefhans can't pass. Come with me.\
  \ Yes. I will take you through an old tunnel. I know the old places. I will take\
  \ you close to the children. But then\"—he shrugged—\"I leave you. Where you go\
  \ is up to you, but I won't walk into that place. I like living.\"</p> \n    <p>Caron\
  \ had to trust him, like it or not, she wasn't getting close to the outpost undetected\
  \ without him. And if he turned her over to the shadow men, then that was a risk\
  \ she was just going to have to take. Without his help she had no hope of finding\
  \ Caleb. It was as simple as that. She'd raised the boy for most of his life, but\
  \ for the first time she saw him not just as another woman's son, but as her boy.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The bottom of the stairway lay shrouded in shadow.</p> \n    <p>She could\
  \ hear the urdefhans moving even above the constant hammering and crashing of metal\
  \ on stone, barking out orders in their vile tongue, but she couldn't see anyone\
  \ keeping watch for intruders. Why would they? This was their domain, even if it\
  \ was only some distant outpost on the far edge of their territory. No one in their\
  \ right mind would dare enter their nest willingly, especially not the beaten down\
  \ peasants from the villages along the mountain range. Those souls were broken.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Here, come, come,\" he said, keeping her pressed against the wall.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She glanced back upward. The top of the vertical shaft was so far away\
  \ that it seemed little more than a pinprick in the blackness.</p> \n    <p>Her\
  \ fingers ached from the effort of maintaining a grip tight enough to remind the\
  \ ragged boy he was her captive.</p> \n    <p>He led the way through narrow gaps\
  \ in the rock, forcing her to turn side-on and scrape through, knowing he could\
  \ just as easily be leading her into a trap. She thought of Caleb. That was all\
  \ she needed to motivate her.</p> \n    <p>\"How much farther?\" she whispered.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Soon there,\" the boy said. \"Just a little further. Come, come.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>He motioned below to a narrow opening in the rock. It was barely the\
  \ size of the tunnel shafts that had lined the walls during their descent. She had\
  \ no choice but to release the wretched lad and let him crawl ahead of her.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He was fast, much faster than she could possibly be.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ followed him into the rat hole.</p> \n    <p>The rock closed in on her as she\
  \ shuffled inch by inch in the dark. Soon she was in total blackness, the tunnel\
  \ turning and twisting, following the line of least resistance through the rock\
  \ where the fissure had split it. The boy was out of reach. She was alone in this\
  \ claustrophobic space. She sent a silent prayer to Erastil and gritted her teeth\
  \ as she crawled on. In what seemed an almost immediate answer, she caught a glimpse\
  \ of firelight casting a weak glow into the end of the passageway ahead of her.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The boy was still there, waiting for her.</p> \n    <p>\"Quickly, quickly,\
  \ quickly,\" he urged, pushing his head back into the opening. It blocked out the\
  \ light. She scraped her back against the rock above her, struggling to squeeze\
  \ through the narrowest of the tunnel with the two-bladed sword in hand. She moved\
  \ on her hands and knees, eyes forward, focusing on the chinks of light that promised\
  \ an end to this hell until she was out, the ground in front of her bathed in firelight.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The boy's high-pitched laughter filled the air.</p> \n    <p>Caron scrambled\
  \ out of the tunnel, desperately trying to silence him, but she couldn't get close\
  \ enough.</p> \n    <p>He clapped his clawed hands together delightedly, squealing\
  \ at the top of his shrill voice. The sounds echoed around the cavernous space.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Should have killed me dead, shouldn't you? Too late now. Should have\
  \ used that big sword. Bye-bye, dead woman. Bye-bye.\"</p> \n    <p>Caron realized\
  \ too late that there was another, markedly smaller fissure in the rock behind the\
  \ boy, too small for her to be able to follow him as he disappeared out of sight,\
  \ leaving her alone in this hellish place.</p> \n    <p>She rushed to the opening,\
  \ and fell to her knees, vainly reaching inside for the boy that wasn't there.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Hands closed on her shoulders, grabbed at her hair and dragged her to\
  \ her feet.</p> \n    <p>How could she have been so stupid? How could she have allowed\
  \ herself to fall into the hands of the urdefhans so easily?</p> \n    <p>Because\
  \ she'd wanted to trust the boy. She'd wanted to believe in the essential goodness\
  \ of humanity. She hadn't wanted to believe that all this time in the darkness could\
  \ have made him less than human.</p> \n    <p>She was turned to face her captors,\
  \ their internal organs bright in the firelight, their fetid breath causing her\
  \ to gag. Behind her, off down the fissure, she could hear the echo of the tunnel\
  \ rat's mocking laughter.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> A flame in the darkness\
