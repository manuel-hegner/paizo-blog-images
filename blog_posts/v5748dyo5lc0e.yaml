  \   <h1><br>Manipulating Terrain</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 15,\
  \ 2011</p> \n   <p>For the last installment of the Design Tuesday blog on terrain,\
  \ we are going to look at a relatively new type of terrain—terrain that you can\
  \ actively manipulate. This kind of terrain can grant a creature a variety of effects,\
  \ from an attack, to cover, to a special or enhanced mode of movement.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Some of the examples of this type of terrain will look familiar. Much of it\
  \ can already be found within existing encounters. Where this is the case, it is\
  \ up to you, the GM, to decide whether or not you wish to allow the special terrain\
  \ effects described below.</p> \n   <p>Other samples of this type of terrain are\
  \ new. Some, like the blink crystal, grant magical effects, and can add a sense\
  \ of mystery and danger, as well as the possibility for strange tactics on the part\
  \ of the PCs and their opponents.</p> \n   <p>Like the hazardous terrain presented\
  \ last week, these new terrain types straddle the line between terrain and new dangers.\
  \ Based on how much of this terrain you plan to use, you may want to consider adjusting\
  \ the CR of encounters that use these more active forms of terrain, especially if\
  \ their use grants one side of the combat more advantage than their foes.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Alchemical Devices</b>: This terrain is actually a broad class of similarly\
  \ acting terrains. They can be as simple as a workbench cluttered with beakers filled\
  \ with roiling concoctions, or as complex as a distiller or even stranger alchemical\
  \ machines. Manipulating such devices requires a standard action and any number\
  \ of skill checks. Toppling a table requires a Strength check. Making a distiller\
  \ shoot a gout of highly-pressurized alchemical gas may require a Disable Device\
  \ check, a Craft (alchemy) check, or even a Strength check, if the PCs are using\
  \ a strategic application of brute force. Interacting with more complex machinery\
  \ usually requires a Disable Device check, though a higher DC Craft (alchemy) or\
  \ Knowledge (arcana) check may do in a pinch.</p> \n   <p>Whatever the type of alchemical\
  \ device, the basic rules for its manipulation are as follows. A successful check\
  \ made as a standard action creates a 15-foot cone (or alternatively a 20-foot line)\
  \ of damaging energy, controlled by the creature that successfully manipulated the\
  \ device. It deals damage to creatures within the area of effect. A Reflex or a\
  \ Fortitude DC halves the damage. Often alchemical devices create an area of acid,\
  \ but the destructive energy could be cold, electrical, fire, or in rare cases even\
  \ sonic or force damage, depending on the nature of the device.</p> \n   <p>To add\
  \ more flavor and danger to specific alchemical devices, you can layer on additional\
  \ conditions and effects. You could add bleed damage (which works well for acid\
  \ or even fire damage devices), have creatures knocked prone on a failed saving\
  \ throw (for sonic or force damage devices), or have a failed saving throw entangle\
  \ creatures for 1d4 rounds (for cold damage devices) or even daze creatures for\
  \ 1 round (for electrical damage devices). </p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>The following\
  \ are some suggestions for baseline effects of alchemical devices based on the base\
  \ CR of the encounter.</p> \n   <p><i>Simple Alchemical Device (CR 1–5)</i>: <i>Activating</i>—\
  DC 14 check; <i>Effect</i>—DC 12 Reflex saving throw for 2d6 acid, fire, or electrical\
  \ damage, or a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw if the device deals cold, sonic, or\
  \ force damage.</p> \n   <p><i>Complicated Alchemical Device (CR 6–10)</i>: <i>Activating</i>—\
  DC 17 check; <i>Effect</i>—DC 15 Reflex saving throw for 3d6 acid, fire, or electrical\
  \ damage, or a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw if the device deals cold, sonic, or\
  \ force damage.</p> \n   <p><i>Advanced Alchemical Device (CR 11–15)</i>: <i>Activating</i>—\
  DC 22 check; <i>Effect</i>—DC 20 Reflex saving throw for 4d6 acid, fire, or electrical\
  \ damage, or a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw if the device deals cold, sonic, or\
  \ force damage.</p> \n   <p><i>Magic-Infused Alchemical Device (CR 16+)</i>: <i>Activating</i>—\
  DC 27 check; <i>Effect</i>—DC 25 Reflex saving throw for 4d6 acid, fire, or electrical\
  \ damage, or a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw if the device deals cold, sonic, or\
  \ force damage.</p> \n   <p><b>Blink Crystal</b>: These strange, cloudy-white crystals\
  \ glow with a faint purplish radiance. Typically blink crystals are the size of\
  \ large gemstones, and they are always set in a statue or some similar large and\
  \ immobile casing. If a blink crystal is removed from its casing, it loses its magic\
  \ and becomes nothing more than a large piece of common quartz (worth 10 gp). A\
  \ creature adjacent to a blink crystal can touch it as a free action, which causes\
  \ the creature to teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space on stable ground\
  \ within line of sight. Touching a blink crystal as a swift action along with a\
  \ successful DC 20 Spellcraft or Use Magical Device check can increase the range\
  \ of the teleport to 40 feet. Failing this check allows the creature to teleport\
  \ 20 feet.</p> \n   <p><b>Bubbling Caldron</b>: A size Large bubbling caldron can\
  \ be tipped over with a DC 15 Strength check made as a standard action. Doing so\
  \ releases a 30-foot cone of boiling liquid from the caldron in the direction of\
  \ the creature’s choosing, and deals 2d6 fire damage to all creatures within the\
  \ cone’s area. A successful DC 12 Reflex saving throw halves the damage.</p> \n\
  \   <p>The liquid makes the area of the cone slippery (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>\
  \ 412) until it dries or dissipates. The cone of liquid affects creatures on the\
  \ ground only. Flying or levitating creatures can avoid the liquid and its damaging\
  \ effect.</p> \n   <p><b>Chandelier</b>: Successfully leaping onto a chandelier\
  \ allows a creature to hang from it and use its momentum to increase the power of\
  \ a jump before the end of the leaping creature’s next turn. A creature is flat-footed\
  \ while it hangs or balances on chandelier.</p> \n   <p>Using the momentum of the\
  \ chandelier grants the leaping creature a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatic checks\
  \ made to jump off the chandelier, and the jump is considered to have a running\
  \ start for purposes of determining the DC of the check.</p> \n   <p>Chandeliers\
  \ have size categories like creatures do. They are typically size Small or larger.\
  \ A chandelier can easily support a single creature of its own size or smaller.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>A creature larger than the chandelier’s size (or two creatures of the\
  \ same size or smaller than the chandelier) can attempt to hang on it or use it\
  \ to gain the bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump, but at the end of the creature’\
  s turn (or the second creature’s turn, if two creatures are using the chandelier\
  \ for the same effect), the chandelier breaks free from its supports and both the\
  \ chandelier and any creatures hanging from it fall to the ground. If either a creature\
  \ two or more size categories larger than the chandelier or three smaller creatures\
  \ leap on to the chandelier, the chandelier and those hanging on it fall immediately.\
  \ Creatures take normal damage from the fall plus an additional 1d10 damage from\
  \ the falling chandelier. At the GM’s discretion, extremely large or heavy chandeliers\
  \ or chandeliers with sharp protrusions or other dangers can deal additional damage\
  \ upon a fall.</p> \n   <p><b>Furniture</b>: From flipping over a table to using\
  \ a gong as makeshift shield, a movable piece of furniture can be manipulated to\
  \ create partial cover for a short period of time. A creature that is adjacent to\
  \ the piece of movable furniture can attempt a Strength check as a move-equivalent\
  \ action to gain cover from the item until the start of its next turn.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>The DC of the Strength check depends on the size of the furniture. The base\
  \ is DC 10 for size Small furniture, and the DC increases by 5 for each size category\
  \ over Small (moving a Medium piece of furniture is DC 15, moving a Large piece\
  \ of furniture is DC 20, and so on). A creature cannot attempt this manipulation\
  \ if it is two or more size categories smaller than the piece of movable furniture\
  \ it wants to manipulate.</p> \n   <p><b>Rug</b>: A creature can spend a standard\
  \ action to attempt to pull a rug out from under creatures standing atop the rug.\
  \ This requires a DC 15 or higher Strength check, depending on the size of the rug.\
  \ If successful, each creature standing atop the rug (some of its space must be\
  \ on atop the rug) must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or fall prone. Creatures\
  \ that cannot be tripped are immune to this effect. Rugs that are larger than a\
  \ 4-square area require higher Strength checks. The DC increases by 2 for every\
  \ additional 2 squares of rug area beyond 4 squares.</p> \n   <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland\
