  \ of Thousands Adventure Path</b> is coming in July 2021! This six-part, monthly\
  \ Adventure Path takes characters from 1st to 20th level. It’s set in the Magaambya\
  \ magic academy in the Mwangi Expanse, the oldest and most prestigious magic school\
  \ in our world. We’ve been looking to tell a “magic school” story for a long time,\
  \ and we’re thrilled to tell a non-Western magic school story set in the Magaambya.\
  \ In Strength of Thousands, the characters start as students, become teachers, and\
  \ ultimately hold the fate of the school in their hands.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>The name of this Adventure Path comes from a school motto;\
  \ each teacher and student stands on the shoulders of thousands who have come before,\
  \ so the weight of reputation and responsibility rests squarely on the heroes’ shoulders.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Strength of Thousands is open to characters of all kinds, but it’s a\
  \ <i>magic</i> school, so some spellcasting ability is necessary. If you like playing\
  \ fighters or monks or other non-spellcasting classes, don’t worry! We’re layering\
  \ on additional spellcasting ability to all characters in this Adventure Path, so\
  \ if you can’t normally cast spells, you get a little bit of spellcasting. If you\
  \ are a spellcaster already, you get a little more. This makes the characters slightly\
  \ more powerful than normal, but lets them feel like students in the world’s premiere\
  \ magic school. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6a5f8d61-6cad-4c89-bb84-74c43ca239b6/091020_13-Celebration.png\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>The adventures initially focus on the Magaambya, but soon\
  \ expand to take place all over the Mwangi Expanse (and even beyond, in an interplanetary\
  \ excursion!). The teachers at the Magaambya are also diplomats and guardians of\
  \ the world, and we want the players to really feel that. You’ll undertake diplomatic\
  \ missions in the dangerous city of Mzali, stage a rescue in the Sodden Lands, and\
  \ uncover secrets lost for thousands of years.</p> \n     <p>Strength of Thousands\
  \ gets tons of support in supplemental articles in each volume, including rosters\
  \ of fellow students and faculty members and an academia downtime subsystem so characters\
  \ get more skilled throughout their academic years as students (and as teachers).\
  \ We expect Strength of Thousands to span many in-game years and thrill real-world\
  \ players for a long time!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6a985a97-806f-4a61-88ca-415248d116aa/091020_14-Storyteller.png\"\

  \ \n     <p>Hello! I'm Eleanor Ferron, a mixed-race author, artist, and Developer\
  \ here at Paizo. Along with my fabulous colleague Luis Loza, I work on the Lost\
  \ Omens setting guides for Pathfinder 2E. I’ve also illustrated several RPG products,\
  \ such as the role-playing card game and campaign assistant, Short Order Heroes.\
  \ Both Luis and I have been working hard on coordinating an incredible crew of authors\
  \ for the Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse book that will accompany the Strength of Thousands\
  \ Adventure Path, and so I am incredibly excited to see that setting come to life\
  \ for players and GMs to explore!M.o</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p><b>Spoken\
  \ on the Song Wind</b>, by Quinn Murphy<br> My name is Quinn Murphy. I’ve been doing\
  \ freelance design and publishing my own games for a little over a decade, and have\
  \ been in love with RPGs for most of my life. Over the years I’ve done design work\
  \ for Dungeons &amp; Dragons (4th Edition), Marvel Heroic Roleplaying, Misspent\
  \ Youth, Trinity Continuum: Aeon, and more. I’ve been working with Paizo since last\
  \ year, starting with the Pathfinder Society Quest Archaeology in Aspenthar and\
  \ other projects. I am really excited to be working on the Strength of Thousands\
  \ Adventure Path, where we can introduce players to wonders and teachings of the\
  \ Magaambya firsthand!</p> \n     <p><b>Hurricane’s Howl</b>, by Michelle Jones<br>\
  \ I'm Michelle Jones, author of Hurricane's Howl and contributor to World Guide:\
  \ Mwangi Expanse. I've been a Paizo freelancer for about 4 years now, and I'm so\
  \ excited to finally write for an adventure path. Since most of my Pathfinder work\
  \ up until now was on the Player Companion line, I always had to ask myself what\
  \ new rules players would find exciting. It was always a fun challenge, but working\
  \ on Hurricane's Howl and the World Guide gave me the opportunity to do what I'm\
  \ really passionate about. The opportunity to tell a story, introduce new characters,\
  \ and explore a part of the world that really deserves some love. So read World\
  \ Guide: Mwangi Expanse and play Hurricane's Howl; I promise you are in for a good\
  \ time. Find me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AleshaKills\" target=\"_blank\"\

  \ Pathfinder Society developer here at Paizo. I was born and raised in Alaska, where\
  \ my family is from for as far back as anyone can trace! I’m of primarily Tlingit\

  \ a company formed for the Tlingit and Haida people of southeast Alaska following\
  \ the Alaska Native Claims Act. Pushing the boundaries of the stories we tell beyond\
  \ Golarion’s Inner Sea has been both a professional goal and a personal passion\
  \ of mine since I started work at Paizo, and without giving any spoilers as to the\
  \ particulars of my contribution to this project, that’s definitely something this\
  \ adventure has allowed me to do!</p> \n     <p><b>Shadows of the Ancients</b>,\
