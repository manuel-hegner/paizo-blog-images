  artist: "some of the best fantasy artists in the biz. It's hard to compare to amazing\
    \ pieces like Wayne Reynolds' cover to the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting,\
    \ Steven Prescott's work on the Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer, John Gravato's\
    \ cover to Guide to Darkmoon Vale, or Andrew Hou's Classic Monsters Revisited,\
    \ but that doesn't mean our favorite artists aren't going to try to blow even\
    \ these awesome pieces away. Case in point, Wayne Reynolds' cover to October's\
    \ Gods and Magic, where firey-winged Sarenrae, goddess of the sun, takes some\
    \ divine vengeance on Rovagug, god of destruction. I won't crowd the piece with\
    \ any more of my ugly words, but for a face-to-face look at Golarion's 20 core\
    \ gods and even a few newcomers check out Gods and Magic, coming soon! F. Wesley\
    \ Schneider Managing Editor, Pathfinder"
