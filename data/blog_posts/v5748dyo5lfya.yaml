  description\">Today marks Sean K Reynolds's last day as a member of Paizo's design\
  \ team, as he leaves us for new adventures in the East. Sean's been an invaluable\
  \ member of the Paizo crew since 2008, lending his experience, insights, innovations,\
  \ and insanity to hundreds of products, as well as being a key contributor to the\
  \ Pathfinder RPG's most major successes. While we'll all certainly be seeing plenty\
  \ more of Sean on the message boards and in future Paizo products, for those of\
  \ us used to seeing him everyday today's exciting but also a little sad. So, we\
  \ wanted to take this opportunity to share some of our favorite Sean memories and\
  \ wish him all the best in what comes next.</span></p> \n     <center>\n      <iframe\

  \  <h2>From Sean's Friends</h2> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Sean K Reynolds\
  \ has been a constant in the business since I first joined in the late 90s. Heck,\
  \ Sean even hired me for my first \"real\" RPG job, as a TSRO moderator on the old\
  \ TSR AOL site. I saw his TSR web policy seminar at my first Gen Con, worked with\
  \ him on the rebirth of Greyhawk, and co-wrote the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer with\
  \ him. When I finally got a job at WotC in '99, Sean was one of the few people I\
  \ knew coming in, and he did a great job making me feel at home. When we had a chance\
  \ to bring him on to the Paizo staff, I leapt at it. In the years since, we've worked\
  \ together, gamed together, and traded minis tips together. It's going to be weird\
  \ not having him around. Sean, thanks for the years of friendship and professional\
  \ support. You're a great guy, destined for great things. And since you're moving\
  \ to Indy, at least we know we'll always have Gen Con!\"</p> \n      <p style=\"\
  text-align: right; font-weight: bold;\">—Erik Mona, Publisher</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"In the 90s Sean was my favorite designer at TSR\
  \ and early WotC—I used <i>Children of the Night: Ghosts and Lords of Darkness</i>\
  \ until they were practically in tatters. In the low 00s, Sean's Ghostwalk article\
  \ \"The Bloody Swords\" in <i>Dragon #315</i> was the first article I read on my\
  \ first day working at Paizo. Years later, his Greyhawk deity articles finally won\
  \ me over on D&amp;D's original campaign setting. Sean was one of the first authors\
  \ to help us in exploring the world of Golarion and it wasn't long after that he\
  \ joined James, Jason, Sutter, Chris, Sarah, and I in a cramped cube-divided office,\
  \ making Pathfinder full-time.</p> \n      <p>\"That first year we were roommates\
  \ at Gen Con and I admit to still being more than slightly starstruck. They screwed\
  \ up our room, though, giving us a single bed and a rickety iron cot. Sean dashed\
  \ for the cot. There was no way though. The 16-year-old fanboy in me wasn't about\
  \ to let that happen. The politest argument of my life transpired, one which only\
  \ ended when I had to confess that there was no way I was going to let him sleep\
  \ on the cot simply \"Because you're Sean K Reynolds.\" I claimed my cot amid the\
  \ resulting blushing.</p> \n      <p>\"In the years since, Sean has been a font\
  \ of awesome ideas, a mouthpiece for alien insanity, an office-place peacemaker,\
  \ a dauntless romantic, a Post-It note artiste, a promoter of great Indian food,\
  \ a friend to baristas, a passenger-seat virtuoso, a plastic-wrap elitist, a lead-footed\
  \ cleric, a vital part of our every victory, and one of the most selfless friends\
  \ anyone could ever wish for.</p> \n      <p>\"Best wishes, man. If you ever need\
  \ anything, just yell.\"</p> \n      <p style=\"text-align: right; font-weight:\
  \ bold;\">—F. Wesley Schneider, Editor-in-Chief</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    \
  \ <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Sean joined the design team in the early days of the\
  \ Pathfinder RPG. To say that he was pivotal in its design and implementation is\
  \ a bit of an understatement. He's been a critical part of the design team, tirelessly\
  \ working to ensure our game is the best it can be. From assigning work to freelancers\
  \ to maintaining an incredibly useful stat-block generator, Sean's value to the\
  \ team and to Paizo will surely be missed. I want to wish Sean all the best in his\
  \ future endeavors, your skill and expertise will be missed (as will your hilarious,\
  \ bizarre, and ridiculous carpool stories).\"</p> \n      <p style=\"text-align:\

  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>A Goblin Song for Sean</b><br> <i>Goblins gray\
  \ or goblins green,<br> Doesn't matter, we're all mean.<br> Always seeking to demean...<br>\
  \ And so that's why we call you Sean!</i></p> \n      <p>\"Don't let them out there\
  \ be goblins too, Sean! Don't let them mispronounce your name! Seeya on the internets,\
  \ farming crops!\"</p> \n      <p style=\"text-align: right; font-weight: bold;\"\

  I'll miss Sean's pithy humor and refreshing honesty (as well as the hilarious post-its\
  \ he was always leaving on my desk), but I'll miss the kindness under the wit even\
  \ more. From my first day at Paizo, Sean was supportive and patient, willing to\
  \ take the time to answer my newbie questions, and ready to volunteer answers to\
  \ the questions I didn't know enough to ask. I wish him the best and hope we'll\
  \ get to hang out with him at Gen Con for many years to come.\"</p> \n      <p style=\"\

  \    </blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"There are so many things I'm\
  \ going to miss about Sean, it's hard to pick just one. So I won't. I'll miss our\
  \ rules discussions and arguments. I'll miss the heavy sighs as he reviews message\
  \ board posts. I'll miss the big grin he gets when he says something (he thinks\
  \ is) really funny. Then again, he gave me a bunch of cool minis stuff that he didn't\
  \ want to take to Indy, and I'll have my own office for a short while, so I guess\
  \ it all evens out. Good luck, sir!\"</p> \n      <p style=\"text-align: right;\

  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Who's going to make fun of my \"Europe-ness\"\

  \ \n      <p style=\"text-align: right; font-weight: bold;\">—Rob McCreary, Senior\
  \ Developer</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Sean is one\
  \ of the greats in the land of fantasy RPGs, and getting a chance to work with him\
  \ has been a blast. His rules knowledge and the thought he puts in constantly impress\
  \ me, as does his ability to analyze and revisit our twisting, sprawling collection\
  \ of rules. He's most definitely the wizard in the design team's party! I wish him\
  \ the best of luck as he steps out with his bags of loot (mostly miniatures and\
  \ pieces of terrain) for the wilds that will be his new home. Happy trails, Sean!\
  \ It's been a pleasure and I look forward to seeing you again whenever the percentile\
  \ rolls dictate.\"</p> \n      <p style=\"text-align: right; font-weight: bold;\"\
  >—Logan Bonner, Developer</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"\
  Sean has a much-loved talent for dropping in on a discussion and contributing an\
  \ inspired observation or a brief anecdote. From his gifts of victory candy to his\
  \ smiling responses even to tough questions, he has helped to make Paizo Publishing\

  \ \n      <p>\"You and Wes were the first people at Paizo to give me work, and you\
  \ were incredibly helpful getting me started and teaching me the right way to do\
  \ things. I will miss having you in the office since I won't get to see your silly\
  \ dances and hear you poking fun at Rob about Europe. I'm at least glad you'll still\
  \ be writing for me.\"</p> \n      <p style=\"text-align: right; font-weight: bold;\"\

  \  </blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Sean came aboard the good ship\
  \ Paizo only about a month after I began working here as an editor. At the time,\
  \ I had no idea of his renown in the gaming industry. I think my first question\
  \ to him was, \"Can I hyphenate the term 'bull rush' when it's used as a verb...you\
  \ know, like in <i>real</i> English?\" I'm sure he wondered, \"Who <i>is</i> this\
  \ guy?\" Instead, he politely explained to me that hyphenating such game terms wasn't\
  \ a traditional practice, and I sighed and went back to my cube and cried (okay,\
  \ not really). Over the years, Sean has (at least outwardly) put up with all of\
  \ my pesky editing questions with unflappable tolerance, and has also been a good\
  \ friend through both calm and stormy weather.</p> \n      <p>I have no idea know\
  \ where this sailing metaphor is coming from, so I'll just end this here by saying:\
  \ Bon voyage, Sean! Looking forward to seeing you the next time the good ship Paizo\

  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>When I first came on board\

  \ running. To this day, almost 4 years into the job, I still go to him several times\
  \ a week with questions about rules, the industry, and specific elements of Golarion\
  \ canon he had a hand in creating (namely the gods). While I'll miss having him\

  \ assist with whatever I might need.</p> \n      <p>Best of luck to you, Sean! I\
