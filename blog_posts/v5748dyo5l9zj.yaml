  \ \n  <blockquote>\n   <h1>Receive the Gift of Kobolds at Free RPG Day!</h1> \n\
  \   <p class=\"date\">Friday, June 20, 2008 </p>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>For those of\
  \ you who don't know, tomorrow is the second annual <a href=\"http://www.freerpgday.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Free RPG Day</a>. Created and run by the good folks at Impressions\
  \ Marketing, Free RPG Day works with hobby game retailers and RPG publishers to\
  \ create in-store events that give away new RPG quick start rules and adventure\
  \ modules. This year, the event is worldwide, meaning gamers in Canada, England,\
  \ Germany, Scotland, Spain, Costa Rica, Chile, and the United States will be able\
  \ to get their hands on a copy of Paizo's Free RPG Day module, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy83rw\"\
  >D1.5: Revenge of the Kobold King</a>.</p> \n   <p>It should have been the end.\
  \ When the bloodthirsty adventurers burst into his throne room and mercilessly cut\
  \ him down, the tale of Merlokrep, last king of the ill-fated Truescale Tribe, should\
  \ have ended. But the fates weren't yet finished with the Kobold King, and now a\
  \ dark power has brought him back from the beyond to wreak his vengeance upon those\
  \ foolish adventurers who destroyed his tribe.</p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"\"\

  \ with the 3.5 edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game and takes your\
  \ heroes back beneath the haunted trees of Darkmoon Wood and into an ancient Azlanti\
  \ crypt in search of the all-too-familiar monsters that are brutally murdering the\
  \ people of Falcon's Hollow. This adventure returns to Darkmoon Vale, an area of\
  \ the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting visited in <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy7yqz\"\
  >D1: Crown of the Kobold King</a> and <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80op\">E1:\
  \ Carnival of Tears</a>, and further detailed in the soon-to-be-released <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/v5748btpy80ib\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles</i>: Guide to Darkmoon Vale</a>.\
  \ Revenge of the Kobold King is a 5th level dungeon adventure written by Paizo's\
  \ Organized Play Coordinator, Nicolas Logue.</p> \n   <p>Though you'll be able to\
  \ download the module for free and purchase a copy from paizo.com starting this\
  \ Monday, we highly recommend you attend your local Free RPG Day event to get a\
  \ physical copy at no cost. Go out and tell the world about Paizo and the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG\">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a>. Get involved and run Revenge for\
  \ hungry gamers right there at your local store. If your local store isn't participating,\
  \ tell them about it. Make sure they're involved next year!</p> \n   <p>Paizo supports\
  \ Free RPG Day and we want our readers, customers, and fans to do the same. Thanks\
  \ for your support and we hope you'll like what Nick has in store for you deep beneath\
  \ the Darkmoon Wood.</p> \n   <p>Joshua J. Frost<br> Director of Sales &amp; Marketing</p>\
