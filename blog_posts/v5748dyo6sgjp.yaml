  \ for years now, but he's finally revealed himself and he's armed for bear! Enjoy\
  \ the following piece of short fiction from James L. Sutter in the next entry into\
  \ our series of Iconic Encounters—brief vignettes of the iconic characters showcasing\
  \ the myriad stories you can tell with Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>Harsk had to admit, they'd had him stumped.</p> \n     <p>It'd been\
  \ obvious what had happened in the village. The stench of blood and death had hung\
  \ in the frozen air, fresh from corpses that hadn't even finished freezing. And\
  \ there'd been no question as to where the raiders had gone: one set of wagon ruts,\
  \ heavily laden.</p> \n     <p>But the tracks—the tracks hadn't made any sense.\
  \ Each corpse sprawled in a wedding-dance swirl of boot prints, but they were all\
  \ the corpses' own prints. Every one of them, slain fighting a foe that left no\
  \ trace but bloodshed.</p> \n     <p>He'd been headed into one of the ransacked\
  \ houses to boil himself a pot of thinking tea when he remembered the story he'd\
  \ heard at the trading post, of magical white-furred slavers called wikkawaks who\
  \ slid light as ghosts over the snow. On impulse, he'd passed by the hearth in favor\
  \ of the house's salt pot. He'd carried it outside and shook it over the snow, and\
  \ suddenly there they were: a flurry of deep tracks, just like the folktales said.</p>\

  \    <p>Now he crouched among the stones of the mountain pass, white bear pelt blending\
  \ with the snow as he gazed down at the three slavers and their caged victims.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There was a time when he would have ended it here. Put them down with\
  \ his crossbow from the shadow of the rock. It was the prudent move, as efficient\
  \ and mechanical as the bow itself.</p> \n     <p>He still did it that way, when\
  \ he had to. Yet in recent years he'd found himself more and more reluctant to unsling\
  \ the machine. Killing that way felt too detached. It felt like cowardice.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Which was ridiculous. A wolf felt no guilt over striking from darkness,\
  \ no shame in hunting with the pack. Only humanoids were stupid enough to forego\
  \ the advantages nature granted.</p> \n     <p>He dropped loudly into the middle\
  \ of the camp, axes in hand. Rough voices shouted in alarm.</p> \n     <p>His brother\
  \ had once said that in a battle, you had to fight as if you were taking on the\
  \ whole army yourself—watching everywhere at once, ready to attack or be attacked\
  \ from any quarter. And that was true as far as it went. You needed to keep your\
  \ eyes open.</p> \n     <p>But it was also badger scat. You didn't hunt every deer\
  \ in the forest. You singled one out, ran it down, and did what needed doing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He chose the one in front, figuring it for the leader by its necklace\
  \ of human ears. He drew back his arm, letting the rest of the world fall away as\
  \ that snarling face filled his vision. The bond of predator and prey.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The hatchet flew. At the last moment, the wikkiwak managed to snap its shield\
  \ up. Crude pig iron shattered beneath the force of dwarven steel.</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ Harsk was already moving, axe coming in low to take the creature's leg off at\
  \ the knee. He dove beneath a wild swing, free hand snatching up the fallen hatchet,\
  \ and rolled to his feet, burying the weapon in the monster's chest.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>One down. The world stuttered back into focus, revealing the two remaining\
  \ slavers. They spread out, trying to flank him, but they came on slowly. Cautiously.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>For the first time that day, Harsk smiled.</p> \n     <p>\"Next.\"</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>If you liked this week's Iconic Encounter, you won't\
  \ want to miss next week's exciting entry. Until then, Pathfinders, may your enemies\
  \ always be favored!</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Franchise Manager</i></p>\
