  articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the great advantages of\
  \ working in the organized play medium is that we produce so many scenarios. That\
  \ means that when there's a lot of fan interest in a certain area, group, or topic,\
  \ we can usually look a little further down the schedule and say, \"I think we could\
  \ make some room here.\" Every since <a href=\"/products/btpy9am5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-13-Of-Kirin-and-Kraken\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-13: Of Kirin and Kraken</em></a> we've had more\
  \ requests for adventures set in Kwanlai and featuring tengus. For that matter,\
  \ ever since Taldor was a Pathfinder Society faction, players and GMs have asked\
  \ me when they'd be able to bring about serious reform in that nation—admittedly\
  \ some were asking so that they could snag a better noble title. This month we're\
  \ doing both, and we're really pleased with the scenarios releasing today.</p> \n\
  \     <p>For all Kwanlai's outward appearance as a unified nation, it's a diverse\
  \ confederation of tengu clans that often contend with each other over power, religion,\
  \ and deeply rooted feuds. The isolated village of Yiangma is a spectator in many\
  \ of these feuds, instead dedicated to maintaining an ancient shrine with heavenly\
  \ ties. However, the village's priests have not sent any report to its archon contact,\
  \ Zepha, in a long time. Concerned that something might be wrong, Zepha tasks the\
  \ PCs in <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4g?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-912-Shrine-of-the-Sacred-Tempest\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-12: Shrine of the Sacred Tempest</em></a> with\
  \ traveling to Yiangma to check in, after which they are free to study the settlement's\
  \ priceless relics and history for the Society.</p> \n     <p>In this Tier 1-5 adventure\
  \ by Justin Juan, the PCs explore a village comprised almost entirely of tengus,\
  \ immersing the PCs in rural Kwanlai's culture and the greater region's history.\
  \ Naturally, we couldn't present a Kwanlai scenario without highlighting the tengus'\
  \ favorite deity, the tempestuous Hei Feng, and we're very excited about the excellent\
  \ illustrations by Tom Ventre that appear in this scenario. It should also come\
  \ as no surprise that any task so closely tied to an archon also has strong Silver\
  \ Crusade connections, too. Finally, if you're dismayed that such a fun scenario's\
  \ too low level for your beloved tengu character, I'm happy to report that there's\
  \ a Tier 5-9 scenario coming up in this region in a few more months.</p> \n    \

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustrations by Tom Ventre</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Ever\
  \ since my colleague Crystal Frasier and I began planning the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown\"\
  >War for the Crown Adventure Path</a>, we wanted to tell the story of Taldor's succession\
  \ conflict from the perspective of multiple campaigns. Not only does that approach\
  \ demonstrate that such major events don't happen inside a vacuum, but this development\
  \ has also remained one of the Sovereign Court faction's top projects. Taldor's\
  \ senate has been fiercely debating the antiquated rule of primogeniture, the nation's\
  \ practice of passing the crown only to a male heir. On one side is Princess Eutropia,\
  \ the reform-minded daughter of the current ruler. On the other is Grand Prince\
  \ Stavian III, her increasingly paranoid father. The Sovereign Court backs Eutropia,\
  \ and in the past several months' scenarios, Pathfinders have assisted this faction—\
  both to help Lady Morilla as well as to secure historical resources that the Society's\
  \ long wanted to study. Now it's all come to this: an imminent senate vote that\
  \ coincides with a major Taldan holiday.</p> \n     <p>Remember how I mentioned\
  \ Crystal and I were coordinating stories? One of my favorite elements is how this\
  \ month's <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4h?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-913-The-Lion-s-Justice\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-13: The Lion's Justice</em></a> happens at the\
  \ same time as many events in <a href=\"/products/btpy9u09/discuss&amp;page=last?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-127-Crownfall]\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder #127: Crownfall</em></a>, the first installment in War for the Crown,\
  \ each portraying the action from a different angle. Sounds tough to coordinate?\
  \ It's definitely taken some forethought and effort, yet our jobs were made so much\
  \ easier by convincing Thurston Hillman (also our Starfinder Society Developer)\
  \ to write both adventures. This experiment in product interaction—and this Tier\
  \ 7-11 scenario with Sovereign Court ties—wouldn't have been the same without his\
  \ tireless contributions.</p> \n     <p>And if these bold illustrations by Sebastian\
  \ Rodriguez are any indication, it's all paid off beautifully. Anyone who's mocked\
  \ Taldor's competences has clearly never had to face down its greatest knights.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS913E-Ionnia.jpg\"\

  \     <p>Finally, you'll notice that #9-13 has a rather weird boon on its Chronicle\
  \ sheet, and I'd like to explain that for anyone wondering.</p> <b>Spoilers for\
  \ The Lion's Justice</b> \n     <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\"\
  \ onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <p>For\
  \ a long while we've noticed that the Pathfinder Society doesn't have much of a\
  \ retirement plan. Sure, there was the old wisdom that one's career ended at 12th\
  \ level—which we've since dispelled with sanctioned modules and ongoing seeker-level\
  \ content—but what happens after a PC decides to hang up her greatsword, change\
  \ careers, or even retire in-world?</p> \n      <p>To this end, we've included a\
  \ boon with the Legacy tag on this scenario's Chronicle sheet. A Legacy boon doesn't\
  \ necessarily have any mechanical benefits. Instead, its primary purpose is to note\
  \ the meaningful impact your character had on the world, whether that's changing\
  \ a country or just changing a life. We also intend for Legacy boons to convey some\
  \ in-world perk with long-lasting effects, much as is the case in this adventure,\
  \ with your character having a place where everyone's always ready to treat her\
  \ like family. Finally, adding a specific tag allows us to consider future boons\
  \ that might interact with Legacy boons, allowing us to tie together these events\
  \ more cleanly.</p> \n      <p>Overall, though, it's a reminder of something good\
  \ that you did. Enjoy!</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized\
