  \ making promo cards! Sometimes, we get a little... out there. For example, Sweet\
  \ Dragon Costume is a goblin in a kobold suit who is so completely convinced that\
  \ he's a dragon that he can <i>scare monsters to death</i>.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Promo-SweetDragonCostumer.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Rawr.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>But okay, there's one place we\
  \ take promo cards very seriously. That's in the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles: Iconic Heroes</a> miniatures boxes, because man, have you seen\
  \ how cool those minis are? We want to hold up our end of the bargain. Now, you've\
  \ already seen <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgw7\">what we did with sets 1 through\
  \ 3</a>. So check out some of these swank promo cards in <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\"\
  >Set #4</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9p\">Set #5</a>.</p> \n    <h2>Iconic\
  \ Heroes Set #4</h2> \n    <p>Here are some cards for three of our most complex\
  \ characters. Note that all these cards have the Owner trait; that means that the\
  \ character whose name is on the card can treat it as a Basic card. That's <i>huge</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-BloodcrowRapier.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-BloodcrowRapier_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-ShoantiEarthbreaker.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-ShoantiEarthbreaker_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-RitualCenser.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-RitualCenser_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>You'd look grumpy too if Shardra boiled stuff behind your face.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The goal with these promos is to interact well with what the\
  \ character does naturally. So Jirelle's Bloodcrow Rapier not only scales up with\
  \ her by adventure deck number, it has a power which enables her to add the Swashbuckling\
  \ trait to any check to defeat a bane—even if it's not a combat check. For example,\
  \ the Skull &amp; Shackles villain Caulky Tarroon can be defeated by a Dexterity\
  \ check, but if you don't add the Swashbuckling trait, she's gonna banish the top\
  \ card of someone's deck. Bloodcrow Rapier makes that problem go away.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Shoanti Earthbreaker deals with one of the most frustrating types of cards\
  \ in the game: Constructs. Golems and other Constructs routinely turn off spellcasters'\
  \ powers, including those of Crowe. The Earthbreaker means he doesn't really worry\
  \ about that much. He just pummels them into oblivion.</p> \n    <p>Ritual Censer\
  \ is one of my favorite cards in this group. Not only does it help Shardra acquire\
  \ spells, but it feeds off her natural tendency to have characters bunch up around\
  \ her. While she's helping people with their checks to defeat banes and succeed\
  \ at Knowledge checks, Ritual Censer helps <i>other characters</i> succeed at checks\
  \ to close Shardra's location. That's some fine synergy at work.</p> \n    <h2>Iconic\
  \ Heroes Set #5</h2> \n    <p>By the way, these cards aren't limited to the characters\
  \ who own them. Take a look at Kess's card. Who wouldn't want to punch their way\
  \ into better Diplomacy checks? And everyone can, because you don't need to be Kess\
  \ to play it. And this is good, since we kinda haven't released Kess yet.</p> \n\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-IronKnuckles_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-OrcWarDrum_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Watch out for the spikes.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>On the other\
  \ hand, you want to be Oloch when you play the Orc War Drum. Oloch might be the\
  \ best character at moving cards around. Displaying weapons and blessings to add\
  \ to checks, discarding armors and blessings to heal, banishing allies to explore—\
  if it's a card, he can do something cool with it. Orc War Drum lets him get some\
  \ of those cards back, and enable others to burn allies to boost anybody's check\
  \ at your location.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-Leryn.jpg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-Leryn_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Double your pleasure, double your fun! Have two Leryns instead\
  \ of one!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Hey, it's Leryn! As an ally! When Adowyn uses\
  \ one of her powers that says \"a card that has the Animal trait,\" Leryn is suddenly\
  \ available for her—<i>twice</i>. Now it's not such a big deal to shuffle the cohort\
  \ Leryn into Adowyn's deck, because the ally Leryn is waiting to be played. That's\
  \ versatility right there.</p> \n    <p>Pretty cool stuff, says me. Promo-worthy,\
  \ you might say.</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Adventure Card Game Lead Designer</i>\
