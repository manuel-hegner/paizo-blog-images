  \ we plan to make this the biggest and best Gen Con yet! I am scheduling 750 tables\
  \ of Pathfinder Society over the four days. We are also bringing the GM 101 workshops\
  \ that debuted at Paizo Con (and were discussed in last Monday’s blog) to Gen Con.\
  \ They will hopefully be a hit and draw in new players and GMs to Pathfinder Society,\
  \ as well as make active Pathfinder Society players take the next step and help\
  \ to GM in their home regions.</p> \n    <p>We will be hosting <a href=\"/beginnerbox\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</i></a> Introductions. During nine of the 10 slots\
  \ at Gen Con, we are setting aside four tables at each slot for these events. These\
  \ are scheduled with new players in mind. The first 45–60 minutes will be exploring\
  \ the contents of the <i>Beginner Box</i>, explaining the rules, and reviewing the\
  \ pregenerated characters. The final 4 hours of each slot will be playing through\
  \ the four 1-hour adventures that were offered during the <i>Beginner Box</i> Bash.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In addition, we are adding a Pathfinder Kid’s Track to our gaming area.\
  \ We are focusing on players aged 6–12 and we will be using the <i>Beginner Box</i>\
  \ for this as well. Each Kid’s Track slot will be 2 hours long and each player will\
  \ receive a check-off card, very similar to what was used at the <i>Beginner Box</i>\
  \ Bash. The first hour teaches roleplaying and rules and reviews the pregenerated\
  \ characters found in the <i>Beginner Box</i>. During the second hour, one of the\
  \ four 1-hour adventures used during the <i>Beginner Box</i> Bash will be played.\
  \ We will be restricting tables to four children players and are requiring a parent\
  \ or guardian be present with each child (or multiple children if they have two\
  \ or more interested in participating) for the entire 2 hours. The parent or guardian\
  \ will assist the child when needed. But, we want to make this a good and memorable\
  \ experience for the kids that attend Gen Con, who often find little they can participate\
  \ in, especially with others their own age. We will be scheduling eight slots per\
  \ day for the Kid’s Track. However, we are only scheduling one adventure each day.\
  \ If a child comes back and plays a different adventure each of the 4 days, he will\
  \ be able to present his check-off card and receive a special certificate. We may\
  \ also have other giveaways or special prizes. <b>I will be very picky when choosing\
  \ volunteer GMs for the Kid’s Track.</b> I prefer to have schoolteachers and other\
  \ professionals with experience dealing with children, but I will consider GMs who\
  \ are parents even if they do not deal with children regularly in their profession.\
  \ If you are volunteering to GM the Kid’s Track, please make sure to include all\
  \ of your credentials. Also, since these are scheduled as 2-hour blocks, a GM will\
  \ be required to run two Kid’s Track slots back to back in a 4-hour block to count\
  \ as one slot of credit toward GM rewards.</p> \n    <p>Finally, we are adding an\
  \ invitation-only second round to the Gen Con Special: <a href=\"/products/btpy8r0d\"\
  ><i>Race for the Runecarved Key</i></a>! The first round will be what you have come\
  \ to know and love as the Pathfinder Special. It will be 75 tables all working together\
  \ to overcome some nasty problem the Decemvirate wants dealt with. However, the\
  \ change this year is that we are adding a special, secret scoring system. The top\
  \ three tables from each tier will advance to the invitation-only second round.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>This second round will be one of the deadliest dungeons ever explored\
  \ by the Pathfinder Society, and only the very best of the organization’s agents\
  \ even have a chance of surviving. Again, let me emphasize—this will be a true and\
  \ deadly test of the Pathfinder Society’s best teams. It is almost a guarantee some\
  \ Pathfinders will die. Make sure to bring your A-game. The first round will be\
  \ made available to qualifying conventions worldwide after Gen Con 2012 as it is\
  \ every year. However, the second round is only being offered this once—at Gencon\
  \ 2012. </p> \n    <p>At this point I am looking at restricting the GM pool to only\
  \ 4- and 5-Star GMs. To top it off, the players that advance to the second round\
  \ will trade in their Chronicle sheets received after the first round as their tickets\
  \ to this invitation-only event. When they complete the second round, they will\
  \ receive new Chronicle sheets with a very special boon. We haven’t forgotten about\
  \ our volunteer GMs for the special either. We didn’t want them to miss out on the\
  \ opportunity to play in the invitation-only second round. So, we will be entering\
  \ all Round 1 GMs into a drawing, were we will pull six names. Those six GMs will\
  \ then receive a seat at a 16th table of the second round. </p> \n    <p>The observant\
  \ readers may have caught that I just mentioned 16 tables and are scratching their\
  \ heads that three tables from each tier and the special GM table don’t add up to\
  \ 16 tables. Well, you are right. Like <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ld4w\">last\
  \ week’s blog</a> that announced a special Tier 12+ event at Paizo Con, we are adding\
  \ a Tier 12+ to both rounds of this year’s Gen Con special! The special will be\
  \ written for Subtiers 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 8–9, 10–11, and 12+, and we'll actually have\
  \ 19 tables of round 2.</p> \n    <p>Now, let’s talk about the GMs and volunteers\
  \ we need to pull all of the above off and make it an awesome Gen Con. </p> \n \
  \   <p>I need a minimum of 125 volunteer GMs for Pathfinder Society games, <i>Beginner\
  \ Box</i> Introductions, and Kid’s Track events. I’ll continue taking volunteer\
  \ GMs until the slots are filled, at which point I will create a waiting list in\
  \ the event a scheduled GM has to cancel his or her Gen Con trip for whatever reason.\
  \ I also need eight Volunteer Assistants for each slot of the show. These folks\
  \ will not GM during their volunteer slots, but will instead help me run Pathfinder\
  \ Society HQ—including marshalling, collecting tickets, distributing GM packs, and\
  \ entering tracking sheets into the database—and will be our go-to guys and gals\
  \ for all things Pathfinder Society. </p> \n    <p>Below you will find the reward\
  \ structure for volunteering at Gen Con 2012. Keep in mind that you’re volunteering\
  \ for slots, not a specific event. I will let you know the slots and scenarios you\
  \ have been assigned as soon as possible. You may designate what tier scenarios\
  \ you wish to GM but this is not guaranteed to be filled. I will do the best I can\
  \ to accommodate your requests. My target date to get all GMs their assigned schedules\
  \ is April 10. This should allow you plenty of time to plan a schedule, before the\
  \ May 20 event registration, with your friends and family who are also attending\
  \ Gen Con 2012. Please let me know via email which days you will be at the convention\
  \ and how many slots you are volunteering for at Gen Con 2012. </p> \n    <h2>Volunteer\
  \ Tiers and Rewards</h2> \n    <p><b>Tier 1 GM Volunteers</b><br> Tier 1 GM volunteers\
  \ are my every day GMs. They are invaluable to making the show a success. Tier 1\
  \ GMs must select and volunteer for a MINIMUM of 7 slots. Tier 1 GMs may feel free\
  \ to volunteer for more than 7 slots if they so desire. Any slots over 7 will be\
  \ used as overfill GMs. Overfill GMs are requested to show up for muster but will\
  \ be free for the slot if a scenario has all of its assigned GMs present. I only\
  \ have room for 80 Tier 1 GM volunteers so don't delay in volunteering for this\
  \ tier. Volunteers will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, though I\
  \ reserve the right to select volunteers who have previously worked for Paizo over\
  \ new volunteers. Please do not volunteer for Tier 1 if you have any doubts that\
  \ you won't be able to attend the show. Tier 1 GMs receive:</p> \n    <ul>\n   \
  \  <li>A FREE 4-day Gen Con 2012 badge</li> \n     <li>A FREE 1/4 of a hotel room\

  \ for volunteering for this tier are smaller, the majority of my volunteers will\
  \ come from Tier 3. Tier 3 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 5 slots. Tier 3 GMs\
  \ receive:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>A FREE 4-day Gen Con 2012 badge</li> \n    \

  \ 3 slots. Tier 4 GMs receive:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>A $10 per slot voucher for\
  \ Paizo.com credit, useable at the show or anytime after, including with your subscriptions\
  \ </li> \n     <li>A FREE limited edition Paizo Publishing Gen Con 2012 T-Shirt</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p><b>Volunteering for One or Two Slot</b><br> While we will gladly\
  \ accept anyone who wants to run just one or two slots during the show, there are\
  \ no rewards for doing so other than our thanks.</p> \n    <h2>When Volunteering...</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Please be specific about what days and how many slots you are volunteering\
  \ for. I will assign folks to slots and scenarios on an as-needed basis. I will\
  \ update the needs in the thread below as I receive volunteers, so you may look\
  \ there to remain up to date on where we still need help. You must have a gencon.com\
  \ account and you must include your gencon.com account number in your email or I\
  \ won’t be able to get you a badge (obviously this is only for volunteers who are\
  \ volunteering for 5 or more slots). Finally, include your Paizo.com email account\
  \ so I can make sure you receive the scenarios in your downloads.</p> \n    <blockquote>\n\
