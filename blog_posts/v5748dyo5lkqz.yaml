  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">For many heroes, their choice of weapon says\
  \ more about their personality and sense of aesthetics than their penchant for mechanical\
  \ optimization. For others, form follows function, and still others blend the two.\
  \ But what sort of weapon fits your personality best? Let's take a look at various\
  \ weapons and figure it out!</p> \n    <h2>Simple, Martial, or Exotic?</h2> \n \
  \   <p>All weapons in Pathfinder are simple, martial, or exotic, based on their\
  \ rough level of power. Unlike in Pathfinder First Edition, exotic weapons are not\
  \ just a mixture of powerful European weapons and weapons from other cultures that\
  \ only occasionally had a leg up over their martial kin. In Pathfinder Second Edition,\
  \ we have a different way of talking about whether a weapon is likely to be found\
  \ in a particular region, and so a weapon's type instead describes a weapon's mix\
  \ of power and flexibility. Simple weapons usually have a smaller damage die than\
  \ similar martial weapons (d6 rather than d8, for instance), and exotic weapons\
  \ usually use the same damage die as a martial weapon but include additional abilities\
  \ that make the weapon more complex.</p> \n    <p>Characters start with proficiency\
  \ in either groups of weapons or lists of individual weapons, and they can take\
  \ ancestry or general feats (and, rarely, class feats) to gain more!</p> \n    <h2>Weapon\
  \ Traits</h2> \n    <p>Whatever your weapon proficiencies, you'll want to choose\
  \ a weapon with useful traits that match your taste and play style. Even among martial\
  \ weapons that use two hands, a bo staff, a greatsword, and a glaive all feel very\
  \ different.</p> \n    <p>A greatsword deals a lot of damage, perfect for a bruiser\
  \ character like a worshiper of Gorum: its damage die is d12 and you can seamlessly\
  \ switch between piercing and slashing damage to avoid enemy resistances and exploit\
  \ their weaknesses.</p> \n    <p>A bo staff is all about controlling the fight.\
  \ Its damage die is only d8, but it has reach (allowing you to Strike enemies up\
  \ to 10 feet away), parry (allowing you to spend an action to increase your AC much\
  \ like a light shield), and trip (giving you several benefits to your attempts to\
  \ trip enemies). Plus, it has the monk trait, which weapon-wielding monks particularly\
  \ enjoy.</p> \n    <p>The glaive has a d8 damage die like the bo staff and shares\
  \ its reach, but that's where the similarities end. The glaive has deadly d8 (dealing\
  \ additional d8s of damage on a critical hit), and it is forceful (which means once\
  \ you get it going and build up momentum, your attacks become more and more powerful:\
  \ 1 extra damage per die on the second attack of your turn, 2 extra damage for any\
  \ attacks after that). The glaive-user isn't interested in giving up an action for\
  \ defense like a character with a bo staff; instead, she does best if she artfully\
  \ sweeps the blade like a brush, focusing on accuracy and multiple attacks to really\
  \ dish out the damage—particularly fitting for a follower of Shelyn.</p> \n    <p>We\
  \ want to give every weapon a different personality like this so that we can better\
  \ serve the infinite personalities that players bring with their characters!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Some other fun weapon traits I haven't covered yet: Twin weapons like\
  \ the saw-toothed saber deal more damage if you fight with two of them. Backswing\
  \ weapons like the greatclub gain a little accuracy after a miss. Backstabber weapons\
  \ like the dogslicer deal more damage to flat-footed targets. Agile weapons like\
  \ the shortsword decrease the penalty for making multiple attacks in a single turn.\
  \ Finesse weapons like the rapier use your Dexterity modifier for attack rolls if\
  \ you prefer. Two-hand weapons like the bastard sword deal much higher damage if\
  \ you wield them in two hands instead of one!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Specialization and Weapon Groups</h2> \n    <p>Traits give us some really cool\
  \ ways to distinguish weapons, but we decided to throw one more customization factor\
  \ into the mix, this time for similar groups of weapons: critical specialization\
  \ effects.</p> \n    <p>Characters who unlock their weapon's critical specialization\
  \ effect gain a special bonus effect on a critical hit that's different for each\
  \ weapon group. For example, let's compare swords, spears, and axes.</p> \n    <p>Swords\
  \ make the target flat-footed on a critical hit, making it easier for you and your\
  \ allies to hit the target again (and making the group's rogue very happy). This\
  \ cements swords like the greatsword or a longsword as great choices for dealing\
  \ damage to challenging foes like bosses, as they have high damage and decrease\
  \ the boss's AC so your team can hit more often.</p> \n    <p>Spears pierce the\
  \ target and weaken its attacks. This makes a spear a good option for someone using\
  \ a more defensive strategy built around negating enemy attacks.</p> \n    <p>Axes\
  \ swing to an adjacent target (if any), damaging that target, too! Combined with\
  \ the fact that axes usually have the sweep trait, giving you a bonus on attacks\
  \ when you move on to a new target in the same turn, this makes axes extremely well\
  \ suited for sweeping up groups of enemies.</p> \n    <p>These are just a few of\
  \ the possibilities. For instance, daggers can cause persistent bleed damage, and\
  \ clubs can knock the target up to 10 feet away (particularly amusing on a well-placed\
  \ Attack of Opportunity).</p> \n    <h2>Weapon Quality</h2> \n    <p>Weapons, as\
  \ well as other non-weapon items (but come on, those aren't as cool as weapons,\
  \ right?), can be poor quality, standard quality, expert quality, master quality,\
  \ or legendary quality.</p> \n    <p>Quality grants an item bonus or penalty of\
  \ the same value as the matching proficiency (so an expert bow grants a +1 item\
  \ bonus to hit and a legendary axe grants a +3 item bonus to hit). You have to have\
  \ the matching proficiency to Craft a weapon of that quality though, so you can't\
  \ make a master sword, for instance, unless you are a master at Crafting.</p> \n\
  \    <p>And now you know the basics about weapons! All there is to do now is choose\
  \ the weapon that suits you. Until next time!</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
