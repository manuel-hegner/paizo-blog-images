  \ Canyon</h1> \n   <p>by Richard Lee Byers</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: A Difference\
  \ of Opinion</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">The wind blowing in Kagur's face smelled of rot. She started running,\
  \ and the soft earth, boggy with the coming of summer, sucked at her feet. Her five\
  \ companions ran as well.</span></p> \n    <p>Eovath soon pulled ahead of everyone\
  \ else. Like her, the blue-skinned frost giant was still growing, but he was already\
  \ taller than any human tribe member, with longer legs and a longer stride.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He slowed down, though, when the several bodies on the ground came into\
  \ view. It was too late to help them, and prudent to advance with caution in case\
  \ their killers were still lurking about.</p> \n    <p>They didn't seem to be, though,\
  \ which left Kagur free to inspect the corpses. The shredded flesh, glazed eyes,\
  \ and flies that buzzed up into the air at her approach forced her to swallow away\
  \ the stinging taste of bile.</p> \n    <p>Her squeamishness made her scowl. Like\
  \ any Kellid warrior, she'd seen violent death before, and only one of the dead\
  \ folk here had been a Blacklion like Eovath and herself. But they'd all become\
  \ friendly since setting forth to hunt from a gathering of half a dozen tribes.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Borog straightened up from his examination of one of the corpses. A member\
  \ of the Eagleclaw tribe, he was the oldest surviving member of the hunting party,\
  \ with deep lines etched in his sun-bronzed face, pouches under his dark eyes, and\
  \ white hairs speckling a close-cropped black beard. \"Like the others,\" he said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>They'd all heard tales of other hunters encountering the same grisly\
  \ end. They just hadn't let it deter them from roaming the prairie themselves. No\
  \ true Kellid allowed fear to rule her, and even had it been otherwise, a tribe\
  \ that didn't hunt wouldn't eat.</p> \n    <p>\"Not all the others,\" Eovath said.\
  \ His adolescent voice broke on the second word, but even then it was as deep as\
  \ most men's.</p> \n    <p>Borog frowned. \"How so?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The way I heard\
  \ it,\" the frost giant said, \"the first band of hunters fell dead without a mark\
  \ on them. It was the latter ones that were torn apart.\"</p> \n    <p>The Eagleclaw\
  \ warrior snorted. \"And what does that tell you? That the first incident was something\
  \ different than the slaughters that have happened since.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Maybe\
  \ not,\" Kagur said. Turning, she counted the corpses. \"Supposedly, every band,\
  \ including that first one, had one member carried off. And one of our own is missing:\
  \ Dron.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kagur.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kagur_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> Those who try to protect Kagur would be\n     <br>better off protecting\
  \ themselves.\n    </div> \n    <p>One of the other hunters hurriedly checked Kagur's\
  \ body count with the aid of a jabbing finger. Another touched the beaten silver\
  \ good-luck charm hanging around her neck.</p> \n    <p>\"All right,\" Borog growled,\
  \ \"maybe the same thing did kill the first party. At this point, what does it matter?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"It doesn't,\" Kagur said. \"What matters is picking up the trail.\"\
  \ Studying the ground, she prowled away from the corpses, and after a moment, her\
  \ companions followed her lead.</p> \n    <p>She hoped it would be easy to find\
  \ tracks in the mucky earth, and bent blades among the new grass, and in fact, it\
  \ was only a short time before Eovath called out: \"Here! The sign isn't clear enough\
  \ to tell what the killers are. But they came from the northeast and headed back\
  \ that way, too.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Let's see,\" Borog said. He stalked to where Eovath\
  \ was standing, squatted to study the sign, then grunted in a way that suggested\
  \ he agreed with the giant's reading.</p> \n    <p>\"Let's move out,\" Kagur said,\
  \ striding closer to the other two.</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Borog replied. \"Red Rune\
  \ Canyon is northeast.\"</p> \n    <p>Kagur blinked. That particular fact had momentarily\
  \ eluded her. And while she'd only heard rumors about strange deaths on the tundra\
  \ since the start of summer, she'd listened to tales about Red Rune Canyon her whole\
  \ life. Every Kellid knew the place was cursed.</p> \n    <p>But in the present\
  \ circumstances, that didn't matter. \"We have to rescue Dron.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Dron's dead,\" said Zorek, a lanky Eagleclaw of about Kagur's age. Blood had trickled\
  \ out of his sleeve to stain the back of his hand. Several days previously, a ground\
  \ sloth had clawed his forearm, and he picked at the scabby gash when no one was\
  \ watching to slow the healing and make an impressive scar.</p> \n    <p>\"You don't\
  \ know that,\" Kagur said. \"If the attackers wanted him dead, they could have killed\
  \ him on the spot like they did everybody else. You don't know they really came\
  \ from Red Rune Canyon, either.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They could just be orc raiders\
  \ out of the Hold of Belkzen,\" Eovath rumbled.</p> \n    <p>Borog shook his head.\
  \ \"Smell the rot in the air. Our friends haven't lain dead long enough to stink\
  \ like that. That's the smell of the unnatural things that killed them.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Kagur scowled. \"Maybe, but it doesn't change anything. Dron still needs\
  \ rescuing, and our dead need avenging.\"</p> \n    <p>Borog took a breath. \"Look\
  \ around. There are fewer of us than there were of those who lost their lives already,\
  \ and you, Zorek, and the giant are young and green. How do you expect to win where\
  \ a stronger band of warriors already lost?\"</p> \n    <p>\"We can make a plan\
  \ when we know more.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Here's the plan,\" Borog said. \"We'll return\
  \ to our tribes, and the chiefs will decide what to do next. Maybe they'll decide\
  \ to hunt and fight the killers properly, and you can ask permission to join the\
  \ war party.\"</p> \n    <p>\"By then, Dron will likely be dead or tortured.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"But you'll be alive, and Jorn Blacklion won't start a feud with the\
  \ Eagleclaws because I let his idiot daughter come to harm.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's\
  \ not for you to decide what the 'idiot daughter' will do,\" Kagur said. \"You're\
  \ not my chief, and I'm going after Dron even if nobody else does.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No,\" said Borog, \"you aren't.\"</p> \n    <p>If his voice changed, his eyes shifted,\
  \ or his hand gestured to give a signal, Kagur didn't notice in a conscious way.\
  \ But the rest of the hunters had drifted up behind her to listen to the conversation,\
  \ and suddenly instinct screamed that they were reaching for her.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ tried to spring forward, but hands grabbed her forearms and held her back. She\
  \ stamped on a foot and snapped her head backward into someone's teeth and jaw.\
  \ That loosened the grips restraining her, and she wrenched herself free and spun\
  \ around.</p> \n    <p>Spreading out to flank her, her three assailants came after\
  \ her. Backing away, she reflexively reached for her longsword, and they faltered,\
  \ as well they might. Young as she was, she was skilled with a blade, and they knew\
  \ it.</p> \n    <p>But, her anger notwithstanding, she knew drawing a weapon would\
  \ be stupid. She didn't want to kill folk from friendly tribes, especially when,\
  \ as they saw it, they were only trying to stop her from coming to harm.</p> \n\
  \    <p>She hitched her foot, faking another step backward, and when they advanced,\
  \ she threw herself at them. She punched Zorek in the solar plexus and made the\
  \ breath whoosh out of him, but then her other two opponents grabbed her. One kicked\
  \ her left foot out from underneath her, and they dumped her onto the ground.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Kagur thrashed but couldn't break their holds. Panting, Zorek came up\
  \ behind them with a length of rawhide in his hands.</p> \n    <p>A big blue hand\
  \ caught him by the shoulder and flung him aside. Then Eovath bashed the other hunters\
  \ away from her with two sweeps of his fist.</p> \n    <p>Grateful as she was for\
  \ the help, Kagur winced. Eovath was stronger than any human, and he hadn't held\
  \ back.</p> \n    <p>Fortunately, her assailants weren't seriously hurt, as they\
  \ demonstrated by scrambling back to their feet. Unfortunately, they too deemed\
  \ that the confrontation had escalated from a scuffle to a deadly serious fight,\
  \ and they snatched for the weapons slung from their belts.</p> \n    <p>Eovath\
  \ lunged, caught Zorek before he could ready his axe, and heaved him into the air\
  \ by his throat and arm. The lanky Eagleclaw's face turned red, and he made gurgling\
  \ sounds.</p> \n    <p>Borog hefted a javelin. The upper edge of the leaf-shaped\
  \ steel point glinted in the morning sunlight. \"Let him go.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You\
  \ might kill me,\" Eovath said, his yellow eyes gleaming like the spear point, \"\
  but not fast enough to keep me from killing your kinsman. One shake snaps his spine.\
  \ One squeeze crushes his windpipe.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No!\" cried Kagur, leaping\
  \ to her feet. \"I mean, no to both of you! Borog, what's the sense of killing us\
  \ to keep us from risking our lives?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I never threatened to kill\
  \ you,\" Borog replied without taking his eyes off Eovath. \"Only the slave.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She put her hand on her sword hilt. \"Eovath is my brother, and if you\
  \ hurt him, you'd better kill me.\"</p> \n    <p>Borog's jaw tightened. \"Fine.\
  \ Go. Your father must know what a stubborn fool you are. Maybe he won't blame me.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Eovath sneered and tossed Zorek away.</p> \n    <p>Once Kagur and\
  \ the giant were on the trail and sure their erstwhile companions weren't following,\
  \ she asked, \"What were you going to do if they called your bluff?\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The giant smiled a crooked smile. \"What makes you think I was bluffing?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You wouldn't really kill friends of the Blacklions.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"They didn't seem much like friends when they jumped you.\"</p> \n    <p>Still,\
  \ she doubted their father would have approved. But if Kagur and Eovath had offended\
  \ the Eagleclaws, Jorn Blacklion would make amends with gracious words and gifts.\
  \ Meanwhile, his daughter and foster son had a hunt to complete. She paused to inspect\
  \ the ground before them, then pointed at the clearest track she'd found so far:\
  \ the unmistakable impression of a boot.</p> \n    <p>Eovath nodded. \"You were\
  \ right. Dron isn't dead. In fact, he's fit enough for his captors to march him\
  \ along.\"</p> \n    <p>For a moment, Kagur was certain that was the way of it.\
  \ Then she noticed additional tracks a couple paces farther along. \"I hope so.\
  \ But look here. The 'captors' were wearing boots, too.\"</p> \n    <p>Eovath grunted.\
  \ \"Then maybe they are orc raiders, despite the putrid smell. Or Kellids turned\
  \ bandit.\"</p> \n    <p>Kagur looked up at him. \"You sound disappointed.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Haven't you ever been curious to see a ghost or a demon?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"I suppose. Is that why you agreed we should come after Dron?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"I agreed because no one should be dragged off into slavery.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Kagur frowned. \"You're not a slave, despite what Borog said. No Blacklion\
  \ thinks of you that way. Not anymore. Not for a long while.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ frost giant shrugged his massive shoulders. \"We should keep moving.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>They did, loping across windswept tundra and past ponds surrounded by patches\
  \ of yellow-green moss and stunted diamond-leaf willows. When the trail led near\
  \ ripe red bearberries, they gobbled some and picked more for later. Gray-white\
  \ hawks with crimson beaks floated in the sky, and wild mammoths trumpeted in the\
  \ west.</p> \n    <p>Animals grew scarcer, though, as the terrain became hillier\
  \ and the trackers drew near to Red Rune Canyon. By the time the sun was sinking\
  \ toward the western horizon, and the notch between two stony walls came into view,\
  \ Eovath and Kagur were the only moving, breathing things in sight.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  It's nearly dark,\" Eovath said. \"We could camp here and head in come morning.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Kagur shook her head. \"Let's cover as much ground as we can.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Unfortunately, that wasn't a great deal more, for when, peering about\
  \ for lurking orcs and other dangers, they prowled into the mouth of the canyon,\
  \ they found it was already twilight inside. They had to stop not long thereafter\
  \ lest they risk losing the trail.</p> \n    <p>They camped beside the creek that\
  \ ran down the center of the gorge and supped on more bearberries and bison jerky.\
  \ Kagur had swamp tealeaves in her pack as well, but it would be foolish to build\
  \ a fire to brew a beverage. Someone or something might spot the light. So far,\
  \ however, Red Rune Canyon had done nothing to justify its sinister reputation.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Later, when Eovath was on watch and sleep continued to evade her\
  \ despite the day's exertions, Kagur came to a decision. \"It's just orcs. Orcs\
  \ bold and cunning enough to hole up where humans are afraid to go.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"What about the rotten smell?\" Eovath replied.</p> \n    <p>\"How many clean\
  \ orcs have you fought?\"</p> \n    <p>\"What about the first hunting party, slain\
  \ without a mark on them?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't know, but—\"</p> \n    <p>Eovath\
  \ suddenly peered farther down the canyon. \"Something's there.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
