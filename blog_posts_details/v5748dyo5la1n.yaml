  artist: "a river crocodile to the human sacrifice drowned to appease the dark jungle\
    \ gods to a battlefield where neighboring tribes rip out each other's throats\
    \ in casual displays of wanton brutality. The terror and death along the dark\
    \ banks sometimes gives birth to monsters. Horrifying amalgamations of jungle\
    \ detritus and human souls, they float along the river, as serene as flowing water,\
    \ until they encounter a living creature to add to their tranquility. Jeremy Walker\
