  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Why the River Kingdoms are called\
  \ such has always puzzled me, given that rivers are only the second most plentiful\
  \ resource in the region behind bandits and other ne'er-do-wells who find the largely\
  \ lawless lands a safe place to practice their chicanery. Thus, no adventure set\
  \ in the region would be complete without its fair share of cutpurses and footpads,\
  \ and the Kingmaker Adventure Path is no exception. As such, it seemed only natural\
  \ to include a number of these nefarious characters in the associated Pathfinder\
  \ Battles: Kingmaker set coming out later this month.</p> \n    <p>All three of\
  \ the set's bandit figures first appeared in print as specific lieutenants of the\
  \ sinister Stag Lord (whose figure I showed off in the previous blog), but can easily\
  \ stand in for any number of more generic baddies at your table. So while some may\
  \ know them as Kressle, Dovan from Nisroch, and Auchs, their common rarity means\
  \ that they can just as easily represent a whole band of Stolen Lands bandits, shadow\
  \ rogues, or River Kingdoms ruffians (respectively). All three are humans, and thus\
  \ stand on Medium bases.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Despite being river pirates, these highwaymen do most\
  \ of their robbing on the roads that wind their way through the forests and plains\
  \ of the Stolen Lands, and as such need places to lie in wait for their unsuspecting\
  \ victims. The set's final piece of set dressing serves as just such a hiding spot!\
  \ While it might seem unassuming on its own, the large bush figure can easily become\
  \ deadly if you put the right threat behind it. It's got a relatively flat top as\
  \ well, so you should have little trouble putting a figure atop the plant to represent\
  \ that it's literally popping out of the foliage.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, we need someone to keep these common criminals\
  \ in line and bring them to justice. And who better to do that than the paragon\
  \ of lawful neutrality herself, Pathfinder: Kingmaker's own Valerie. A rare Medium\
  \ figure, Valerie makes a great PC miniature or NPC general, and her lack of specific\
  \ insignia on her shield or livery means she can serve as both ally or enemy without\
  \ looking like she's wearing some other soldier's armor.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
