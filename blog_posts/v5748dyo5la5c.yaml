  date\">Wednesday, August 22, 2007</p> \n   <p>Now that <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zke\"\
  ><i>D2: Seven Swords of Sin</i></a> is starting to make it out into people's hands,\
  \ I'd like to talk a little bit about my favorite part of writing it: designing\
  \ the city of Kaer Maga.</p> \n   <p>Going into the project, there were two different\
  \ ideas for where the adventure should be set. For me, it seemed to call for an\
  \ urban setting, a crazy city where anything went and the law was sketchy at best.\
  \ Publisher Erik Mona, however, was eager for Varisia to have an iconic castle,\
  \ a massive dungeon complex that we could return to again and again as we saw fit.\
  \ The solution? Push the two together and build a city <i>inside</i> a castle—an\
  \ enormous Thassilonian ruin of unknown function, to be exact. At this point Erik\
  \ and the rest of the GameMastery team gave me the go-ahead and, armed with the\
  \ working title \"Dark Market,\" I sat down to write. </p> \n   <p>As anyone who's\
  \ played in one of my adventures can probably tell you, I like to play with morality.\
  \ To me, the interesting thing about evil is that it's so rarely self-identified\
  \ as such. One of my biggest peeves in adventures, fiction, or film is what we around\
  \ the office refer to as \"moustache-twirling\"—villains that are evil simply because\
  \ they enjoy being evil. (Shortly after that comes my disdain for boring ol' \"\
  insanity\" as a villain's motive.) In real life, things are usually much more gray\
  \ and fuzzy—no evil deed exists in a vacuum, and even the most \"evil\" people I\
  \ can think of tend to have reasons why their actions make sense in their own minds.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>This aesthetic was at the front of my mind when writing about Kaer\
  \ Maga. To me, all big cities are by definition neutral—get enough people together,\
  \ they'll balance each other out. In Kaer Maga's case, this neutrality is the result\
  \ of a free market taken to the extreme, an anarchist, libertarian utopia where\
  \ people are left to sink or swim entirely through their own machinations. While\
  \ many would look at the gritty streets, where every shameful vice is yours for\
  \ the purchasing, and call it evil, I'd point out that Kaer Maga is also the freest\
  \ of the free cities of Varisia. In rooting the city's \"evil\" in an ideal many\
  \ of us share, I hoped to make the scene feel a little more familiar and organic.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Along with the questionable morality, it was important to me that\
  \ Kaer Maga be a monstrous city, a place where we could get a taste of the alien\
  \ delights that Golarion has to offer and remind the folks who inhabit Varisia that\
  \ there's far more beyond the mountains than they might imagine. For those purposes,\
  \ a city of refugees and squatters seemed perfectly poised to capture the sort of\
  \ cultural mish-mash that I love in places like <i>Star Wars</i>' Mos Eisley or\
  \ China Miéville's New Crobuzon. Knowing that I wouldn't have space in a 32-page\
  \ adventure to truly detail many of the residents, I took a page from some of my\
  \ favorite sci-fi and fantasy authors and tossed in a bunch of allusions and off-hand\
  \ references with only the barest explanations. Wormfolk? Bloated Ones? Sweettalkers?\
  \ When I first wrote those names, at 3:00am in a darkened room, my bleary brain\
  \ didn't know any more than their names. As soon as I went back and read them, however,\
  \ my imagination went into overdrive trying to think up what they could be... which\
  \ is exactly what I hope happens to everyone else. While I couldn't resist from\
  \ detailing some of them in the Pathfinder Journal for <i>The Hook Mountain Massacre</i>,\
  \ I promise I'll try to leave at least a few of them alone. </p> \n   <p>For now.\
