  date\">Saturday, June 20, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">When we first started brainstorming for Pathfinder Online\
  \ (PFO), I was running the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\">Kingmaker\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Path</a> in my home gaming group. We were loving the idea\
  \ of adventurers forging a kingdom out of the wilderness. It gave an extra dimension\
  \ and purpose to our adventures, along with an additional set of problems to roleplay\
  \ through.</p> \n    <p>So when Ryan and I started to think about PFO, I felt that\
  \ Kingmaker's setting, the River Kingdoms of Golarion, would be the perfect backdrop\
  \ for an MMORPG: a cluster of small settlements and kingdoms battling the environment\
  \ and each other for survival. It would be like playing Kingmaker in coordination\
  \ with dozens of other gaming groups, with each GM sharing info on what his group\
  \ is doing, and occasionally the groups would get together and either help or hinder\
  \ each other. In the Pathfinder RPG, coordinating such a campaign would be a massive\
  \ feat, but MMORPGs are perfectly set up for just such a scenario, so that's what\
  \ we're building with PFO.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Jon Hodgson's illustration for Kingmaker was an inspirational\
  \ focus for Pathfinder Online.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Starting in a little less\
  \ than two months, PFO players, much like their table-top counterparts, will be\
  \ able to pick and choose how their settlements are going to be built, developing\
  \ it all with their own sweat and blood. There will be dozens and dozens of buildings\
  \ to choose from, and you'll be able to upgrade many of those buildings over time.\
  \ Will you put up walls? How about a community garden? What deities will your temple\
  \ support? There will be a legion of decisions, making each settlement as unique\
  \ as any character.</p> \n    <p>Right now, you can claim a hex in the game and\
  \ put up holdings and outposts. In a few weeks, you will be able to contest the\
  \ claims of others, possibly claiming those holdings for yourself, or burning them\
  \ to the ground. Remember in the Kingmaker AP when you heard that one of your lumber\
  \ camps was being attacked and you had to intervene? Well, the same thing will happen\
  \ in PFO to your lumber camp, or your mine, or any other holding. Defend them, or\
  \ there will be consequences.</p> \n    <h2>The Political Landscape</h2> \n    <p>One\
  \ of the unique things about playing in a sandbox MMO is that the players themselves\
  \ build the things that exist in the world. To jumpstart that effort, we did a Land\
  \ Rush a few months after the Kickstarter ended, and 30 player settlements were\
  \ handed out to the 30 groups that had the most players pledging to them. This gave\
  \ us the starting player settlement landscape for when the game launched. You can\
  \ check out the current map of the game world, created by one of the players in\
  \ the game, <a href=\" http://www.pfomap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Once settlement warfare comes into the game and you are able to destroy\
  \ a settlement or conquer it, this map will change. Already, there are some areas\
  \ of the world that are more powerful and populated than others. Here is a snippet\
  \ of the political landscape as it exists today.</p> \n    <p>The biggest and most\
  \ powerful alliance in the game is the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2ray4\">Everbloom Alliance</a>,\
  \ or EBA. Made up of the settlements of Brighthaven, Phaeros, Keeper's Pass, Hammerfall\
  \ and Blackwood Glade; the purpose of the alliance is protection of its member settlements\
  \ and their members.</p> \n    <p>EBA's arch-nemesis, the second most powerful alliance\
  \ in the game, is the <a href=\"http://www.xeilias.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Empire of Xeilias</a>, made up of the member settlements of Golgotha, Callambea,\
  \ Kreuz Bernstein, and Auroral. They are led by their Benevolent Dictator Phyllain,\
  \ and are the most active PVP contingent. Located in the center of the game map,\
  \ their exploits against the EBA have already become the stuff of legend in the\
  \ world.</p> \n    <p>In the northwest corner of the map lies the third most powerful\
  \ alliance in the game, the Coal Road Alliance, aka <a href=\"http://www.coalroad.com/hrc\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">The High Road Covenant</a>. Comprised of the settlements of\
  \ Stoneroot Glade, Talonguard and Taverhold, they have provided a bastion for folks\
  \ wanting to steer clear of the drama taking place between EBA and Xeilias. The\
  \ community there is super-supportive and actively campaigns against the monsters\
  \ in the area.</p> \n    <p>In the north, we have the <a href=\"http://ozemsvigil.guildlaunch.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Free Highlanders</a>, consisting of Alderwag, the paladins of\
  \ Ozem's Vigil, and the dwarves of Forgeholm. This group provides support for each\
  \ other through trade and defense, especially when troubles flared up between them\
  \ and Golgotha a month or so back.</p> \n    <p>Currently, the last significant\
  \ alliance is the <a href=\"http://aeonianleague.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aeonian\
  \ League</a>, consisting of Hope's End, Sunholm, and Canis Castrum. For the most\
  \ part, they have kept to themselves out in the middle western part of the map,\
  \ with Canis Castrum making a run to become the most significant market town on\
  \ the western half of the map.</p> \n    <p>The southwestern corner of the map is\
  \ a ghost town of hexes overrun with monsters and abandoned settlements and is avoided\
  \ by most—which will soon mean opportunity for others!</p> \n    <h2>The Emerald\
  \ Lodge</h2> \n    <p>This leaves the largest non-allied settlement in the game,\
  \ <a href=\"http://emeraldlodge.guildlaunch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Emerald\
  \ Lodge</a>. Run by Thod, the Emerald Lodge is situated smack-dab in the middle\
  \ of the map, between the warring factions of the EBA and the Empire of Xeilias.\
  \ This has made for some harrowing times for Thod and his settlement, but to date,\
  \ they have navigated the politics, made deals where they had to, and kept themselves\
  \ viable and thriving in the game without joining one of the larger player blocs.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Player Spotlight: Thod</h2> \n    <p>Five-star Pathfinder Society GM\
  \ Jens Loesel gives us insight into Pathfinder Online from the point of view of\
  \ a Pathfinder RPG player, father of two, and the leader of the largest non-alliance\
  \ group in the game, the Emerald Lodge.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n   \

  \    </div> \n    <p>In his own words:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>One of the\
  \ interesting aspects of a sandbox game is that you can play your own game, bound\
  \ only by the sand, the other players, and the technology. There is a lot of freedom\
  \ as a player. And that is what attracted me to Pathfinder Online.</p> \n     <p>Because\
  \ I wanted to give everything a Pathfinder Society background, in the early days\
  \ my main character was Theodum, designed after my very first PFS character. Theodum\
  \ earned the title of Venture-Captain in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8bub\"><em>Eyes\
  \ of the Ten</em></a>, and now the things he does in Pathfinder Online feed back\
  \ into his character at the PFS table.</p> \n     <p>Lately, my dwarf character\
  \ Thod has taken much of my time. He started as a gatherer because that's probably\
  \ the most important role to kickstart a settlement economy. Encroaching monsters\
  \ and the need for victory tokens led to Thod training in fighting, which also makes\
  \ him fun to play with groups that need someone who can kill monsters in the wild.\
  \ Most people associate me with Thod now, especially as I post as Thod in my blogs.\
  \ (A lot of the time I \"play\" as Thod is actually outside of the game.)</p> \n\
  \     <p>My background as a Pathfinder Society player and 5-Star Game Master in\
  \ the United Kingdom was invaluable in the Land Rush. To earn a settlement, you\
  \ needed votes from other players, so I created a background for my proposed settlement\
  \ that would tie it to the Pathfinder Society. I proposed the Emerald Lodge as a\
  \ Pathfinder Society lodge located near the Emerald Spire superdungeon. (In game,\
  \ the Emerald Spire can't yet be explored, but it can be seen, and my son was the\
  \ first player to see it—or at least to report seeing it—so being close has advantages.)\
  \ With this background in place, I asked UK PFS players to back me in the Land Rush,\
  \ which they did. But securing a settlement was only the beginning. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>My first nasty surprise came in the first week of the Land Rush, well before\
  \ anyone was actually able to log into the game. Golgotha, the largest evil group,\
  \ wanted to position their settlement in a spot that would make them our neighbors.\
  \ We had several options: join or ally with them; find someone stronger to ally\
  \ with and hope for their protection; move elsewhere and say goodbye to the background\
  \ story about being next to the Spire; or ensure that they valued your settlement\
  \ more alive than dead.</p> \n     <p>Meanwhile, the Everbloom Alliance was staking\
  \ out a spot to the other side, albeit further away. This opened up more problems\
  \ and more options. Do we get between the two, becoming a speedbump when we are\
  \ overrun, or can we steer a neutral way out of the whole situation? Either side\
  \ might or might not want us, but they also don't want us to join the opposition.\
  \ They also don't want the bad publicity from squashing a small, harmless, innocent\
  \ settlement.</p> \n     <p>What followed was a year of diplomacy, plotting, building,\
  \ and interacting with other players. PFO is not just \"log in, kill a few monsters,\
  \ be done.\" Whatever you do, in game or out of game, has an effect. At times it\
  \ was a balancing act, especially when we had to take some towers for ourselves\
  \ or when we tried to ensure nobody tread on our toes. But we are still there. We\
  \ still have all our towers and, most surprisingly for a lot of gamers, we carved\
  \ out an oasis between much larger groups that are keen on PvP, yet not only do\
  \ they let us play our game, they sometimes even support us. We are still around\
  \ and we plan to be around a lot longer.</p> \n     <p>There's still a lot to look\
  \ forward to: growing the settlement further, getting rid of towers... and building\
  \ our own vision of a Pathfinder Lodge, defended by diplomacy and not force, becoming\
  \ a neutral meeting point when war rages around us. Oh—and one day being among the\
  \ first to go down the Spire. </p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Lisa Stevens<br>\
