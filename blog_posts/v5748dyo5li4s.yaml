  >RPG Superstar</a> isn't easy. In fact, it isn't supposed to be easy. Being a freelance\
  \ rpg writer isn't easy, and the contest intentionally uses short deadlines, detail-oriented\
  \ rules, and a variety of different types of writing challenges to emulate some\
  \ of the difficulties freelance writers face. On top of all that, being a contestant\
  \ means having your work constantly judged and analyzed by professionals and fans\
  \ alike without the benefit of passing through outside developers and editors first.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>By the time contestants reach the last round, they've truly gotten a\
  \ taste of how difficult the creative process can be. All of our contestants have\
  \ done wonderful jobs not only producing interesting entries, but dealing with the\
  \ pressures of forum critiques and the frustrations that come with not being able\
  \ to jump in and correct inaccurate or unfair interpretations of their work. Every\
  \ contestant has had to worry about how voters are reacting to a previous entry\
  \ while trying to prepare to produce a new bit of game material for the next round.\
  \ Over the course of the contest this process covers magic items, maps, monsters,\
  \ and encounter design—some of the lynchpins in the toolbox of designing a good\
  \ rpg adventure. I appreciate the hard work and dedication every contestant put\
  \ into their entries, and hope those for whom the contest is over can sit back,\
  \ relax, and enjoy the last round.</p> \n    <p>Of course for 4 contestants, things\
  \ aren't over just yet. Major congratulations go to Charlie Brooks, Jason Evans,\
  \ Crystal Malarsky, and Nick Wasko, who have one more round to face. While they\
  \ might wish to bask in the accomplishment of knowing that each of them is going\
  \ to get to write an adventure of us—a <a href=\"/pathfinder/modules\">Pathfinder\
  \ Module</a> for the winner, and a Pathfinder Society scenario for our runners-up,\
  \ there's really no time to for them to relax.</p> \n    <table class=\"table-spacing-large\"\

  \ \n    <p>The last challenge is the biggest one—a 2,000 word adventure proposal\
  \ to be used to form the outline of the winner's final published book. Our Top 4\
  \ have until 11:59 PM on October 22, to turn in their proposals. Each must be for\
  \ a 32-40 page adventure for 5th level characters, set in the Sodden Lands, and\
  \ focusing on a location-based adventure. Voting will begin on October 26, and our\
  \ winner will be announced October 30.</p> \n    <p>It's been a great contest so\
  \ far, and I hope everyone will join me in congratulating the final four on their\
  \ success making it to the final round, thank all our contestants for the fabulous\
  \ work and ideas they've provided us throughout the previous challenges, and offer\
  \ sincere appreciation for the voters and judges who have helped us sort through\
  \ the entries to get us this far.</p> \n    <p>Owen K.C. Stephens<br> <i>Developer,\
