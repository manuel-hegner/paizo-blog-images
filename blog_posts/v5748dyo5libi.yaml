  \ of Two Morgans</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Sunday, December 20, 2015</p> \n \
  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Making <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9iln\">December's Pathfinder Adventure Path SoundPack</a>\
  \ for the second chapter of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\"><em>Hell's\
  \ Rebels</em></a> has been amazing! Not only because I got to build a complete SoundSet\
  \ for underwater exploration and combat (so cool, making all my normal sounds wishy\
  \ washy and strangely muted), not only because I got to build a Xorn, and a Rope\
  \ Golem (except I can't call either of them by their real names, because OGL), but\
  \ mainly because I got to work with two of my favourite voice actors again.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Morgan Rands, I met at PaizoCon, and this year he donated a series of\
  \ roars that we chose to be the official Pathfinder <a href=\"/products/btpy9f04\"\
  >Green Dragon</a> for the amazing <a href=\"/products/btpy9f04\"><em>Dragon's Demand\
  \ SoundPack</em></a>. The horror and sheer guttural intensity of what Morgan gave\
  \ at the microphone cannot be underestimated, so when he offered to give more sounds\
  \ whenever I needed something I couldn't pass up the offer. Since then Morgan has\
  \ given all sorts of bits and pieces, including the King Chess Piece voices and\
  \ the Dice Roller sounds for our brand new shiny <a href=\"https://catan.syrinscape.com/?paizoblog\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Catan SoundSet</em></a> in the Board Game Player. And for\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9iln\"><em>Turn of the Torrent</em></a> Morgan didn't\
  \ disappoint! From Barzillai's sneering Proclamations to the slightly disturbing\
  \ snarls of the three headed cerberi.</p> \n     <p>Morgan Jenkins, I met at PaxAus,\
  \ and this year I spoke on a Panel he ran about Tabletop Gaming for Visually Impaired\
  \ people. It was extremely informative and inspiring. Morgan does great things for\
  \ a not insignificant group of gamers, for example encouraging us at Syrinscape\
  \ to add interface scaling to our Apps (already done = you can make the buttons\
  \ bigger) and high contrast backgrounds (in the works now = making the backgrounds\
  \ black). Morgan has a seemingly endless hoard of voices bouncing round in his head,\
  \ and for <a href=\"/products/btpy9iln\"><em>Turn of the Torrent</em></a> he gave\
  \ me a trio of extremely peculiar and quite inebriated NPCs to populate the wonderfully\
  \ seedy tavern the \"Tooth and Nail\". These characters (who even sing), will enable\
  \ GMs to deliver an amusing and genuinely memorable break from slaying and looting\
  \ in any Pathfinder adventure.</p> \n     <p>It's wonderful having these two great\
  \ guys on the end of an email. All I have to do is type in, \"Right, are you keen\
  \ to give me a slightly psychopathic, disturbed, but competently deadly human Expert/Fighter/Rogue?\"\
  \ and before I can say, \"mixing up the pretty sounds\" I've got an inbox full of\
  \ several thousand bytes of viscous Pathfinder audio gold.</p> <iframe style=\"\

  \ frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n     <p>So thank you so much Morgans!\
  \ Since the beginnings of Syrinscape, we have been keen to use community created\
  \ content and voice acting rather than just standard commercial sample packs. That's\
  \ one of the reasons I love freesound.org, where I am able to use great recordings\
  \ made by keen amateurs, and best of all put their names in lights inside our app.\
  \ One of these days one of my fantastic contributes is going to get a lead role\
  \ in a feature film after a big producer with an even bigger cigar hears their voice\
  \ in a Syrinscape Pathfinder SoundSet. That'll be a great day.</p> \n     <p>If\
  \ you are a <a href=\"/products/btpy9dhp\">Syrinscape Fantasy</a> or <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9dhr\">SuperSyrin Subscriber</a> you'll see these SoundSets live in\
  \ the Fantasy Player already as well as stand alone \"Seedy Tavern\" and \"Flooded\
  \ Dungeon\" versions very soon. If you're not a Subscriber you can still hear them\
  \ by grabbing <a href=\"https://store.syrinscape.com/subscriptions/trial-supersyrin/?paizoblog\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">a free 30 day trial sub</a>, which unlocks everything we've\
  \ ever made.</p> \n     <p>And remember, if you're another Morgan (or Morganette),\
  \ don't hesitate to get in contact with us to see if you might just have exactly\
  \ what we are needing in our next Pathfinder Adventure Path SoundPack.</p> \n  \
