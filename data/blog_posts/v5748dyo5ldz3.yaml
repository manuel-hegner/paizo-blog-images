  \ of the Risen Rune at Gen Con in August and are moving quickly into the heart of\
  \ the season's metaplots with the release of two new scenarios this month. In past\
  \ seasons, we've moved from completely unlinked scenarios to short three- or four-part\
  \ story arcs within a larger array of generally unlinked scenarios and then further\
  \ into seasonal meta-arcs covering an entire year's worth of scenarios. During Seasons\
  \ 2 and 3, the Year of the Shadow Lodge and Year of the Ruby Phoenix, respectively,\
  \ we still released several multipart stories within the larger arcs, each with\
  \ its own series title. We're not doing that this year, though, not because we think\
  \ there's necessarily a problem with multipart scenarios, but rather because we\
  \ wanted to try something else out.</span></p> \n     <p>Multipart scenarios have\
  \ always been big hits for players, who like the continuity between adventures,\
  \ as well as for event organizers who can schedule a whole arc for a gameday or\
  \ convention to give a bit more cohesion to their event. But for everyone who has\
  \ given positive feedback about multipart scenarios there's been another Pathfinder\
  \ Society member who's expressed frustration with needing to play them in order,\
  \ leveling out of a series' tier, or release of scenarios being delayed by a month\
  \ (or more, in some cases).</p> \n     <p>In response to this, we've set the multipart\
  \ arc format to the side this season and are trying something newâ€”a high-level and\
  \ a low-level metaplot tied directly to the season's larger metaplot. These adventures\
  \ will build upon one another in a way more like a traditional campaign but in a\
  \ way that they can be played out of order or by different PCs without their internal\
  \ continuity suffering. But for someone playing them in order and with the same\
  \ character, a clear through-line and progression from the arc's start to finish\
  \ will become apparent. In both cases, the adventure that kicks off the metaplot\
  \ will be releasing this month!</p> \n     <p>Pathfinders of 1st to 7th levels are\
  \ going to be doing a lot of scenarios dealing with the Aspis Consortium and firmly\
  \ establishing the Pathfinder Society as a prominent Varisian organization despite\
  \ the Consortium's longer presence in the region. This metaplot begins with <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8u8t\"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-07: Severing Ties</i></a>,\
  \ and will conclude in June in a Tier 3-7 scenario we're tentatively calling <i>Rivalry's\
  \ End</i>. This metaplot is set to bring at least two villains back from previous\
  \ seasons, though who they are and what roles they're set to play I'm not yet ready\
  \ to reveal.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0408-Tomaz.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0408-Tomaz_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Players with characters in the highest tier of regular\
  \ Pathfinder Society play will note that every Tier 7-11 scenario released from\
  \ this month to the end of the season has direct ties to the cult of Lissala, an\
  \ ancient Thassilonian faith thought lost to time. Over the course of the season,\
  \ the Pathfinder Society's highest-level field operatives will be sent to investigate\
  \ the cult, uncover what they're up to, and ultimately face the greatest threat\
  \ to ever appear in a Pathfinder Society Scenario. We're planting seeds of the final\
  \ showdown in some of our earliest scenarios of the year, and players who earn special\
  \ unique rewards will have the chance to use them to make an otherwise epic encounter\
  \ in July's Tier 7-11 season finale (currently titled <i>The Waking Rune</i>) perhaps\
  \ a bit more survivable.</p> \n     <p>What about those PCs who like to adventure\
  \ in the middle, like Tier 5-9? Well, that's sort of our catchall this season while\
  \ we put more thematic scenarios into Tiers 1-5, 3-7, and 7-11 and their respective\
  \ metaplots. Mid-level Pathfinders will get to follow up on a low-level party's\
  \ discoveries by venturing into a Hellknight citadel, will have the chance to alter\
  \ the very nature of the <i>Hao Jin Tapestry</i>, and in May, June, and July, take\
  \ the Pathfinder Society from Varisia into a neighboring nation and from there into\
  \ Season 5 with an epic discovery!</p> \n     <p>As the season plays out and folks\
  \ get a chance to play through these metaplots, please leave your feedback here\
  \ or on the Pathfinder Society messageboards. Whether you've got a 1st-level neophyte\
  \ Pathfinder or a seasoned veteran coming up on 10th level, don't miss this month's\
  \ release of <a href=\"/products/btpy8u8t\"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-07:\
  \ Severing Ties</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8u8u\"><i>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #4-08: The Cultist's Kiss</i></a>! While you look for a local offering\
  \ of these events, check out this art to whet your appetite.</p> \n     <p>Mark\
