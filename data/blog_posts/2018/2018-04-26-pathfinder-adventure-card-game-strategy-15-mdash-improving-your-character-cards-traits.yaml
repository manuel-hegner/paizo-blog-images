  \ build your characters; this one goes into the tactics: which cards are you looking\
  \ for?</p>\n             <h2>Upgrade your magic and elemental traits</h2>\n    \
  \         <p>Your characters will start off with mundane weapons and with subpar\
  \ elements like Poison.</p>\n             <p>Prioritize grabbing Magic weapons and\
  \ especially Fire magic. One of the main reasons for this is monsters like Rise\
  \ of the Runelords' Troll, which is one of the most annoying banes ever if you don't\
  \ have the Fire (or Acid) trait to permanently put him to rest. Every Adventure\
  \ Path has cards that require specific traits to defeat, and Magic and Fire are\
  \ two of the most important.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \           <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-Troll.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-Troll_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ScorchingRay_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n              <p>Burn it with <em>fire</em>.</p>\n             </div>\n \
  \            <p>Generally, it's good to accumulate cards that upgrade your elemental\
  \ traits. Poison is the worst, because many things are immune to it. Force is the\
  \ best, because not much is immune to it. So replace Poison with Acid, Cold, Electricity,\
  \ or Fire when you can, then replace those with Force.</p>\n             <p><em>Corollary\
  \ #1: Diversify your traits.</em> When you're upgrading, don't get too focused on\
  \ one trait. Occasionally you'll meet monsters like the Troll that require a specific\
  \ element to defeat; more frequently you'll meet a monster immune to particular\
  \ elements. So it's always good to have variety in your hand.</p>\n            \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n              <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-SunFalcon.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n              <p>Sometimes nothing burns like the&nbsp;cold.</p>\n      \
  \       </div> \L \n             <h2>Offset gaps in your party</h2>\n          \
  \   <p>When you're gathering cards, look for ones that offset ability gaps in your\
  \ party. That means if you're missing a specific skill, get cards that will help\
  \ you succeed at tests of that skill. Allies are the most common card type that\
  \ give you a bonus in a particular skill, and they have the additional advantage\
  \ that they can usually be used to explore, which means they won't be stuck in your\
  \ hand: use them to explore when there's not an obvious need for their skill bonus.</p>\n\
  \             <p><em>Corollary #1: If you're short on healers, get healing.</em>\
  \ To offset a lack of healing spells or powers, you can most obviously get Potions\
  \ of Healing. However, there are also occasional allies or other items that can\
  \ offset this deficit. Spread these healing cards out, and in particular give them\
  \ to characters who are light on recharging and heavy on discarding, like Seelah\
  \ or Seoni.</p>\n             <p><em>Corollary #2: If you're short on disablers,\
  \ get toolkits.</em> If your party generally lacks the Disable skill, spread around\
  \ items that can help with traps and other barriers. Thieves' Tools and Masterwork\
  \ Tools are the obvious choices, but the Crowbar can also be shockingly useful.</p>\n\
  \             <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n              <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ThievesTools.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ThievesTools_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Crowbar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n              <p>Sometimes the right tool for the job is a Tool.</p>\n  \
  \           </div>\n             <h2>Upgrade your skills</h2>\n             <p>Sometimes,\
  \ instead of filling ability gaps in your party, you want to accentuate what you\
  \ already have. Hunt for items that will improve the characters' best skills to\
  \ make them all the more able to close locations (or to succeed at other skill tests).\
  \ Get Merisiel Boots of Elvenkind and Seoni a Crown of Charisma. Find a Sage for\
  \ Kyra or a Standard Bearer for Harsk.</p>\n             <p>These might not be the\
  \ best boons for these characters long-term, but improving good stats should always\
  \ be a consideration.</p>\n             <h2>Don't be afraid of inappropriate cards</h2>\n\
  \             <p>When you're improving your characters, you'll generally want to\
  \ take cards that the characters are proficient with and to avoid the ones that\
  \ they can't use to their best effect. But this is not always the best strategy.\
  \ Sometimes you'll want to take an inappropriate card because it's better than an\
  \ appropriate card, because it helps your character (or the party) fill an ability\
  \ gap, or just because it's what's available.</p>\n             <p><em>Corollary\
  \ #1: Remember that inappropriate spells still allow one use.</em> It's perfectly\
  \ okay for Arcane casters to pick up Divine-only spells and for Divine casters to\
  \ grab Arcane-only spells. They just end up being single shots. This works best\
  \ for spells where you're not adding the skill's die. So, if your party really needs\
  \ healing, don't be afraid to give your Arcane caster Cure. Similarly, a Divine\
  \ caster could take Mirror Image to help with damage or Teleport to help with movement.</p>\n\
  \             <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n              <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Cure.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Cure_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n              <p>Don't fear that last paragraph.</p>\n             </div>\n\
  \             <p><em>Corollary #2: Remember that inappropriate armor is usable.</em>\
  \ Armor can be ineffective in two ways if you don't have the appropriate proficiency.\
  \ First, it often gets banished when you reduce large amounts of damage. Second,\
  \ it often can't be recharged at round's end. The first problem is not a problem\
  \ at all: if it's great armor, keep it, and if you use it, you can hopefully replace\
  \ it with something else great. However, not being able to recharge is problematic,\
  \ because it clogs your hand. Still, there will sometimes be inappropriate, non-recharging\
  \ armor that's worthwhile.</p>\n             <p><em>Corollary #3: Remember that\
  \ inappropriate weapons… are probably still bad.</em> If you don't have the required\
  \ proficiency for a weapon, it tends to increase the difficulty for challenges,\
  \ usually by 4. It feels like a really good weapon should overcome this problem,\
  \ but that doesn't tend to be the case. You're unlikely to find an inappropriate\
  \ weapon that adds at least 5 (or a d10) more than an available weapon that [i]doesn't[/i]\
  \ require proficiency, and that's what you typically need for it to actually be\
  \ better.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n              <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n              <p>The right weapon in the wrong hands is the wrong weapon.</p>\n\
  \             </div>\n             <p><em>Corollary #4: Use inappropriate card to\
  \ create voids.</em> Inappropriate items that get banished (i.e. spells and armor)\
  \ can work very well in a voiding strategy where you're trying to end up with too\
  \ few of a card type so that you can choose a new card from the box. Hold onto these\
  \ banishable cards during a game when you have an excess of the card type, then\
  \ banish them in a later game when you're not gaining that type of card.</p>\n \
  \            <h2>Plan for your blessings</h2>\n             <p>Some characters get\
  \ benefits from specific blessings on their role cards. Try to plan for this. Look\
  \ at your role card early on, choose your preferred role, and start collecting any\
  \ appropriate blessings. If you don't, it's possible you'll never get many of the\
  \ right blessings, because the role card arrives relatively late in the game.</p>\n\
  \             <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n              <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ColdIronWarden.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n              <p>Count your blessings before they hatch. (Or something like\
  \ that.)</p>\n             </div>\n             <p>Sometimes building your deck\
  \ is as much about what you get rid of as what you keep...</p>\n             <h2>Don't\
  \ get hung up on banishable cards</h2>\n             <p>Cards that must be banished\
  \ to be used are usually powerful, so it's tempting to always put them in your deck.\
  \ Don't. Consider any banishable card carefully and be sure that it's a great card\
  \ that you'll actually use.</p>\n             <p><em>Corollary #1: Throw out banishable\
  \ cards you're not using.</em> If you didn't manage to use a banishable card for\
  \ two or three scenarios, get rid of it. It might have a great power, but if you\
  \ never play it, who cares? (But before you put it back in the box, see if perhaps\
  \ another character would be more likely to play it.)</p>\n             <h2>Don't\
  \ get hung up on loot</h2>\n             <p>There's a tendency to hold onto loot\
  \ because it's unique and was given as a special prize. There's a lot of loot that\
  \ <em>is</em> worth keeping through an entire Adventure Path, but some loot may\
  \ never be valuable to you, and other loot may get overshadowed over time. Toss\
  \ it out if something else looks better!</p>\n             <p>And that brings my\
  \ look at improving characters to a close… and it also ends my series of general\
  \ strategy articles for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. I've thought about writing\
  \ some articles about the specifics of certain characters and about all the different\
  \ sorts of cards, but for now other writing is calling me. Maybe I'll return some\
  \ day.</p>\n             <p>For now, thank you to Mike Selinker and Paizo for giving\
  \ me this opportunity to talk about my strategy ideas and for publishing a game\
  \ that's racked up over 100 games on my tabletop. And thank you to everyone here\
  \ on the forums who contributed corrections and additional strategy ideas. I intend\
