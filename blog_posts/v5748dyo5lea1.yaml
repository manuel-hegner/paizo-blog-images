  \ Andrew Murphy</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: The Hall of Whispers</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p>You might think that watching cultists devour a corpse would\
  \ be the most horrible sight one could witness.</p> \n    <p>You'd be wrong.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The most horrible sight is watching those\
  \ cultists throwing the corpse back up while a vampire vomits. This latter is particularly\
  \ bad when you remember who the priestess seated me opposite. If I ever hear a bard\
  \ say the words \"bathed in blood\" again, I swear I'll kick him.</span></p> \n\
  \    <p>I wanted to kick my brother, but he'd saved us. While the cultists dealt\
  \ with their unexpected illness, he'd located a secret side door and unlocked it\
  \ with a mithral chime, then bustled us through. When the door was safely latched\
  \ behind us again, he began to explain about harmonics and sympathetic vibrations,\
  \ but I really didn't care. I was covered with the blood of Zharmides the Godless\
  \ while Norret didn't have a speck on him. He'd been standing safely out of range,\
  \ painting the portrait.</p> \n    <p>Norret was actually quite pleased with how\
  \ it had turned out, and I had to admit that it was well done, assuming one likes\
  \ portraits of cultists slicing up dead naked wizards. I was in the back, holding\
  \ the unicorn horn spoon in one hand and the vampire's lavalier in the other. Rhodel\
  \ was there as well, holding Zharmides' damned snuffbox with the lions and lilies,\
  \ like a treasure chest for a pixie pirate queen.</p> \n    <p>Norret was happy\
  \ that he'd found such a good use for the canvas, while I was upset because Urgathoa's\
  \ pepper mill was still amethyst even though Rhodel wasn't touching it.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Hmm, interesting.\" Norret took it, holding it by the chain as it went\
  \ white. He touched it with his bare fingers, watching it change to rose quartz.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He handed it back. While it was pink for a moment, it swiftly purpled.\
  \ \"But I'm not undead!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Probably another false positive,\" Norret\
  \ speculated. \"It may test for some other property. Perhaps Urgathoa's approval.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>I was about to protest that I didn't know why Urgathoa, goddess of\
  \ sickness and escaping your grave, might approve of me, but I bit my tongue. Plus\
  \ I'd just had a vampire get sick all over me. \"What was in that vial?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Syrup of ipecac,\" Norret replied, \"a powerful emetic. It's made from\
  \ the root of the ipecacuanha plant. Didn't I tell you?\"</p> \n    <p>He hadn't,\
  \ nor had he told me we'd be traveling through Korvosa's sewers.</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ was still holding the map he'd purchased before, tracing imaginary lines on it\
  \ as we made turn after turn through the stinking—but admittedly rather spacious—\
  tunnels beneath the streets. I didn't like to think about why folks would need to\
  \ build them so large.</p> \n    <p>Norret was mumbling to himself, counting his\
  \ paces. Each time I started to breach the silence, he waved my questions away,\
  \ lest I interrupt his rapidly expanding total. At last he said, \"If we went left\
  \ <i>there</i>, then we should be under it right about...\"</p> \n    <p>We turned\
  \ a corner, and found a wall with an unmarked iron door set into it.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Perfect!\" Norret said. He opened his box labeled <i>Hessim, Newby, &amp; Sage Paint\
  \ Manufactory's Complete Pigment Panoply</i>. He selected the smallest pot of paint—\
  already half empty—took a nip of some elixir, and set to painting an intricate key\
  \ on a page of his formulary. He blew on it to dry, then held up the book and shook\
  \ it.</p> \n    <p>A complicated iron key fell into his hand.</p> \n    <p>Norret\
  \ corked the tiny sample pot, cleaned the brush, and put away the set.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>The key fit the lock like it was made for it.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ <br> Nella is a tricky one, that's for sure.\n    </div> \n    <p>An iron staircase\
  \ wound upward. Occasionally passageways branched off. Terrible screams and moans\
  \ echoed from those halls. We passed a silver mirror, and in it I glimpsed Rhodel\
  \ talking with two men dressed as guards. No one stood on the stairs.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>At last we came to another door with a keyhole. Norret inserted the iron key.\
  \ It turned.</p> \n    <p>It opened out into a library—an unusually round one—with\
  \ the door a hidden panel disguised as a shelf of books. A moment later I realized\
  \ that all the books were false. They were made out of bronze, the same as the busts\
  \ of the dead wizards and the statues of the past headmasters of the Acadamae. The\
  \ floor was black marble inlaid with silver circles and arcane diagrams, and the\
  \ dome above was painted midnight blue and spangled with stars. In the middle hung\
  \ a great glass lantern painted to look like the moon, but from this angle, it looked\
  \ more like a skull.</p> \n    <p>\"It's the columbarium,\" I breathed. \"The Hall\
  \ of Whispers....\"</p> \n    <p>As I said the words, they were repeated, ghostly\
  \ echoes whispering around the room.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh!\" exclaimed Norret. \"A\
  \ whispering gallery! I've read about these! Some interesting acoustical properties\
  \ here....\"</p> \n    <p>His words echoed around the room as well, hissing and\
  \ whispering as they passed the bronze books and the effigies of wizards past. Then\
  \ they were followed by other words, repeated whispers not spoken by my brother:\
  \ \"<i>Ya thievin' packrats! Give back what ya stole!</i>\"</p> \n    <p>There,\
  \ before an alcove with his bust, stood Zharmides the Godless–completely transparent.\
  \ But this time, thankfully, with his clothes.</p> \n    <p>Something was wrong,\
  \ subtly wrong, but I couldn't quite say what.</p> \n    <p>\"<i>Give it back!</i>\"\
  \ he wailed. \"<i>Give back my iv'ry chest or I'll curse ya ta–</i>\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Suddenly the scent of ectoplasm and roses manifested as another ghost appeared—\
  one I knew—and I realized what was wrong. Zharmides looked like a ghost, but didn't\
  \ <i>smell</i> like one. Ever since I'd died and come back, I'd had the ability\
  \ to sense ghosts by smell. And this one didn't smell at all.</p> \n    <p>Rhodel\
  \ stared eye to eye with her fellow ghost. \"Boo!\" she said as she reached up and\
  \ flicked his hat.</p> \n    <p>Zharmides' bowler raised in the air, hissing, while\
  \ lines of blood appeared, trickling down his face. His hat flew atop his bronze\
  \ bust and turned into a pug-nosed orange tabby. \"Marcat! No!\" the dead wizard\
  \ cried in a feminine voice.</p> \n    <p>Rhodel disappeared, smirking.</p> \n \
  \   <p>The ghost of Zharmides the Godless turned toward us. </p> \n    <p>\"My mistake.\"\
  \ Nella Cailean's illusion melted. \"Never pick drama over believability. I should\
  \ have just impersonated Headmaster Ornelos.\" She shrugged. \"Anyway, I still want\
  \ the little ivory chest.\" She held out her hand.</p> \n    <p>\"Why?\" I almost\
  \ screamed. \"Are all wizards mad? What's so important about a snuffbox?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Sivanah only knows!\" she laughed. \"But all the older instructors have\
  \ them, so I intend to find out.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And how'd you know we'd be here?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"My main field of study is illusion, but I dabble in divination as\
  \ well. I spy with my little scry...\" She produced a sheet of paper and grinned\
  \ at Norret. \"I still haven't figured out your claw spell, but a page from an alchemist's\
  \ formulary and a handwriting sample? Can't ask for better sympathy than that.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I <i>thought</i> I felt someone was watching me,\" said Norret.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"And a whole lot more will be if you don't give me Zharmides' snuffbox.\"\
  \ She paused. \"And the vault key. I only reserved the columbarium for an hour,\
  \ and you must have alerted half the spectral spies.\"</p> \n    <p>A knock sounded\
  \ at a door on the other side of the chamber.</p> \n    <p>\"Reserved!\" Nella cried.\
  \ \"Summoning!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Acadamae security!\"</p> \n    <p>Nella looked at\
  \ Norret. \"Give me the goods, and I'll get you out. Refuse, and you deal with the\
  \ guards.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So will you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm a student. I'm used\
  \ to it. You?\" She cocked her head. \"Did you hear the screams in the halls below?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Fine,\" he agreed. \"Just be quick.\" He placed the key and the\
  \ snuffbox in her hand.</p> \n    <p>They disappeared up her sleeve. \"Understood.\"\
  \ Nella wove her hands in the air, muttering arcane syllables. My brother's appearance\
  \ melted, reforming into the image of Arlunia Ehrmande, Lecturer in Charms.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The door opened and three hellspawn entered the chamber. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  You fools!\" Nella screamed. \"I summoned a drekavac, and now it's out of its circle!\"\
  \ She pointed at me.</p> \n    <p>\"What's a drekavac?\" the first hellspawn asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The second stared at me in horror. \"You summoned a plague spirit?\"\
  \ He turned to Nella. \"Are you insane?\"</p> \n    <p>The third remarked, \"Don't\
  \ drekavacs have animal heads?\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's a greater drekavac!\" Nella\
  \ improvised. \"A bloody drekavac! A child who died of the plague!\"</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ far as I knew, I'd only died of a fever, but Nella's lies were uncomfortably close\
  \ to the truth. I was also acutely aware that I was still drenched in the blood\
  \ of Zharmides the Godless.</p> \n    <p>\"Professor Ehrmande, do you think you\
  \ can hold it?\" Nella asked breathily.</p> \n    <p>\"I think so,\" said Norret\
  \ in his normal, masculine voice.</p> \n    <p>The hellspawn stared at him. \"Does\
  \ she have the plague?\"</p> \n    <p>Norret coughed.</p> \n    <p>\"Save yourselves!\"\
  \ cried Nella.</p> \n    <p>The hellspawn ran out the door.</p> \n    <p>Nella produced\
  \ a wand. \"Hold hands and run for the Acadamae gates. This won't last long.\" She\
  \ touched me with the wand and said a single word: \"Fernseed.\" Then she touched\
  \ Norret. \"Fernseed,\" she pronounced again and he vanished.</p> \n    <p>We were\
  \ invisible. We ran for the open door and out into the Hall of Whispers. We found\
  \ the main entrance by following the cries of \"Drekavac! Drekavac! Run!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>We were out on the lawn, out the front gates, and halfway down a side street\
  \ before the spell wore off. The illusion of Arlunia Ehrmande lasted a little longer,\
  \ but was gone by the time we found a bridge to cross the Narrows of Saint Alika.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>By the time we got to the Old Quay, I was staggering. Norret covered\
  \ me with his cloak, and I finally slept.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Teleportation is an awful way to wake up, but it was followed by the\
  \ realization that we were back in Galt, in the Primrose Suite.</p> \n    <p>Sweet\
  \ Galt. How I'd missed her.</p> \n    <p>\"Blue Liberty!\" Dr. Orontius swore. \"\
  What happened, Orlin? You look like you were in the front row at a particularly\
  \ spectacular beheading!\"</p> \n    <p>I wanted to say, \"No, a vampire got sick\
  \ on me,\" then found that I already had. Before I hardly knew what I was doing,\
  \ the whole story came out. Norret even had pictures, including his painting of\
  \ the cult's feast just before they all threw up.</p> \n    <p>Dr. Orontius worked\
  \ a small spell, making all the blood that covered me vanish, then Norret told the\
  \ rest of the tale, including how he'd lost the snuffbox.</p> \n    <p>\"'Nella\
  \ Cailean,' you say?\" asked Dr. Orontius. \"Saucy little minx. Well, two can play\
  \ at the scrying game....\"</p> \n    <p>\"Unless there's lead in the way.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Well, yes,\" admitted Dr. Orontius, \"but it's not that common.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"White lead is also the primary ingredient in flake white, which I used\
  \ to gesso my canvas.\" Norret opened his case of pigments, revealing a full jar\
  \ of white paint. \"I used to be a soldier, so I'm familiar with the feeling of\
  \ being scried on.\" Norret reached into the jar and removed a tiny chest. \"I assumed\
  \ you could clean this off.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Splendid!\" cried Dr. Orontius. \"\
  You painted the snuffbox in the portrait twice, once with mundane pigments, once\
  \ with the marvelous ones?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes,\" said Norret.</p> \n    <p>Dr.\
  \ Orontius chuckled heartily. \"Knowing what I do, Nella should be heartily surprised\
  \ when she discovers that her prize is a fake!\" He repeated the blood-removing\
  \ charm, but this time it stripped paint, leaving a pretty little ivory snuffbox,\
  \ complete with gilded scrimshaw lions and lilies.</p> \n    <p>He opened the tiny\
  \ chest, bringing it to his nose and sniffing. \"Ah yes, dear Zharmides always favored\
  \ Peshpetal Blend.\" He snapped it shut and held it to his heart. \"I will cherish\
  \ this memento and think of him always.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You could cherish that\
  \ and think of him too.\" I pointed to the portrait of the cultists devouring Zharmides'\
  \ corpse.</p> \n    <p>Dr. Orontius looked uncomfortable. \"Yes, well, perhaps I\
  \ might use that to retrieve some fragment of his body.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So what's\
  \ the snuffbox for?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Clever boy.\" He pinched my cheek. \"Perhaps\
  \ one day, if you are clever enough, you might attend the Acadamae and learn that\
  \ secret.\" He patted me on the head for good measure. \"But presently, you must\
  \ work. Breakfast won't fix itself!\"</p> \n    <p>There is something wrong with\
  \ a world where ghouls and vampires are more polite and grateful than a houseful\
  \ of scholars. I went out to the garden, let out the chickens that had been cooped\
  \ up all day, and took in a double helping of eggs.</p> \n    <p>The post-execution\
  \ day omelets were late the next morning, but they were seasoned with thileu bark.\
  \ I declared them \"Omelets Korvosa.\" If I didn't need to tell the boarders about\
  \ unicorn bone porridge, I didn't need to tell them about Urgathoa's pepper mill\
  \ either.</p> \n    <p>I was beginning to fix lunch when the bell for the Primrose\
  \ Suite began jangling. Dr. Orontius had some nerve. But when the wire pulled the\
  \ spring out of the wall and slammed the bell into the ceiling, I realized something\
  \ was seriously wrong.</p> \n    <p>\"Rhodel, get Norret!\" I raced for the Primrose\
  \ Suite.</p> \n    <p>Norret was already there, staring at the door, his monocle\
  \ pushed up on his forehead. A horrible banging and cursing came from the suite,\
  \ mixed with the screeching of an owl. Norret was half-shaven, holding a mug and\
  \ shaving brush.</p> \n    <p>He pushed the monocle back in place, spat in his shaving\
  \ mug, and painted the doorframe with the resulting lather.</p> \n    <p>Norret\
  \ pushed me down on the floor. The lather sizzled and exploded, the entire door\
  \ and doorframe falling out into the hall. Plaster dust swirled through the air\
  \ like smoke.</p> \n    <p>Through the new arch into the Primrose Suite, I saw Dr.\
  \ Orontius being beaten over the head with a gold-topped cane by Zharmides the Godless.\
  \ Meanwhile, a green winged monkey-gremlin-thing attempted to garrote our boarder\
  \ with the bell pull while an owl clawed at it.</p> \n    <p>Norret still had his\
  \ pomander orbiting his head. He hurled it at the gremlin, angling the opening just\
  \ so. The thing screeched, blinded by thieves vinegar. It looked like a beribboned,\
  \ clove-studded orange-peel hat had been pulled down over its eyes.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Get the homunculus,\" Norret said. \"I'll get the wizard.\"</p> \n    <p>I wasn't\
  \ certain how I was supposed capture a flying manikin, but then I spotted a bell\
  \ jar on the mantel. It was covering a clock the same size as the homunculus.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I used my spirit's hand to tweak its nose. The homunculus flew up as\
  \ I caught it in the jar, clapping the open end down to the surface of Dr. Orontius's\
  \ traveler's trunk. The thing raged against the glass, but it was too heavy for\
  \ it to lift.</p> \n    <p>With a terrific thundering that rattled the windows and\
  \ knocked all the pictures askew, Zharmides the Godless blew up—fortunately into\
  \ flecks of shaving cream and shadows rather than blood and gore like the last time\
  \ he'd been ripped apart. A torn scrap of parchment fluttered down, and Dr. Orontius's\
  \ owl familiar caught it. He dropped it in my hands before taking his customary\
  \ perch atop the bust of Nethys and looking at me expectantly.</p> \n    <p>I examined\
  \ the parchment. It was half of a magical figure—half a circle, half a square, and\
  \ the upper half of Zharmides the Godless, holding his cane in one hand, his arms\
  \ shown in two positions, like an architectural diagram for a jumping jack. More\
  \ sympathetic magic. </p> \n    <p>I turned. The lower half of the symbol was pasted\
  \ inside the open lid of another large chest, an ivory one. But it was still possible\
  \ to see that this one was scrimshawed with lions and lilies and filled with books.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Thank you,\" Dr. Orontius wheezed, loosening the bell pull from his\
  \ throat. \"Your assistance is appreciated but was not strictly–\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  It's Zharmides' trunk,\" I said. \"The real one. The little snuffbox is just a focus,\
  \ isn't it?\"</p> \n    <p>Dr. Orontius harrumphed, but he couldn't hide the guilty\
  \ expression. \"How was I to know—\"</p> \n    <p>I cut him off. \"You use the paintings\
  \ when you teleport somewhere. By the same principles, you use your snuffbox to\
  \ teleport your traveler's trunk to you later when you want it. Why go back to your\
  \ library when you can have your library brought to you? Zharmides knew the same\
  \ trick, but to get his books, you needed his snuffbox. Which would have all worked\
  \ out fine, except he left his homunculus inside the larger chest along with a trap.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"A symbol,\" Dr. Orontius said, feeling the lumps on his head. \"\
  I'm not certain which one....\"</p> \n    <p>I handed Dr. Orontius the upper half\
  \ of the torn piece of paper.</p> \n    <p>Norret beamed like a proud parent. But\
  \ he was actually just my brother, and someone had to have a head for business.\
  \ \"I don't know what deal you had with Norret,\" I said, \"but I'll be making up\
  \ a bill.\"</p> \n    <p>I stepped out over the rubble, adding, \"There will be\
  \ no further room service.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> A sample chapter\
