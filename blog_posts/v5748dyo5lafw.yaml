  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, August 12, 2009</p> \n   <p>The <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</i></a> releases tomorrow at Gen Con\
  \ and game stores around the country. Over the past 14 weeks, we have look at all\
  \ of the core classes and one of the prestige classes that can be found in the book.\
  \ We've taken a look at a host of feats, spells, and magic items, as well as a few\
  \ other rules bits along the way. This week, we are investigating the most important\
  \ rule in the game. Not surprisingly, it is also one of the first rules in the book.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>This is your game.</p> \n   <p>The rules in the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game Core Rulebook</i> are presented to help you tell the stories that you want\
  \ to tell. They are organized to help speed up play and enrich your world. You might\
  \ find that, through play, some of these rules do not suit your style of play or\
  \ do not serve the story you are trying to tell. Feel free to change them. Sit down\
  \ with your group and discuss what \"house rules\" you are going to use as part\
  \ of your campaign. Add, subtract, or even <i>polymorph</i> these rules to fit your\
  \ needs. If you are the Game Master, you should work with your group to determine\
  \ what changes are appropriate. If you are a player, remember that the GM is the\
  \ final arbiter, but do not be afraid to make suggestions or bring new rules to\
  \ the table for him to review. When you play the Pathfinder RPG, we want to make\
  \ sure that you have fun. The rules are there to serve that goal, not to stand in\
  \ the way.</p> \n   <p>Since this is the last preview, I want to take just a moment\
  \ to thank all of the playtesters that spent countless hours playing, reviewing,\
  \ and critiquing the Beta version of the game. I think you will find that they had\
  \ a large influence on the final design and deserve a great deal of credit for all\
  \ of its improvements. It was a lot of work to weed through over 100,000 messageboard\
  \ posts, but the final game makes all of that effort worth it. If you were part\
  \ of the Alpha or Beta playtests, I would like to say thank you.</p> \n   <p>As\
  \ of this posting, a number of folks have already received their rulebooks, and\
  \ discussions are already taking place on our messageboards about the changes and\
  \ additions to the game. So, instead of talking about the rules, I wanted to close\
  \ this preview with a look at some of the fabulous art that you will find in the\
  \ <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>. The <i>Core Rulebook</i> is available in\
  \ stores and at our booth at Gen Con starting tomorrow. See you on the boards.</p>\
