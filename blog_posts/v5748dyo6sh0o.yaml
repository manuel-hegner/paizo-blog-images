  \ </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Wednesday always\
  \ means New Comic Day, when comics fans like me swarm to the racks to find the newest\
  \ releases. It’s been a while since we released a new Pathfinder comic with our\
  \ friends at Dynamite (more on that soon—we’re working on something really special),\
  \ but we thought the approaching holiday season was a good opportunity to team up\
  \ with Humble Bundle to bring you a huge selection of Pathfinder comics at the best\
  \ price of all: whatever you feel like paying!</p> \n     <p>The brand new <a href=\"\
  https://www.humblebundle.com/books/pathfinder-comics-cache-books?view=kVBbLwTgZo4q\"\
  >Pathfinder Comics Cache</a> brings you SEVEN different Pathfinder comics storylines,\
  \ from the very first issue ever printed to crossovers with Red Sonja and John Carter\
  \ of Mars to an anthology of unforgettable goblin stories. If you’ve ever wanted\
  \ to read the thrilling exploits and origins of the Pathfinder iconic characters,\
  \ now is your best chance to jump on board.</p> \n     <p>BUT THAT’S NOT ALL! We’\
  ve matched Dynamite’s generous offering with a bundle of amazing Pathfinder First\
  \ Edition rulebooks and adventures that make perfect companions for the comic book\
  \ action! Set out on a lifetime of adventure with the <i>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</i>,\
  \ stock up on fabulous gear with <i>Ultimate Equipment</i>, or populate your comics-inspired\
  \ dungeons with the critters from <i>Bestiary 1</i>, <i>Bestiary 2</i>, and <i>Bestiary\
  \ 3</i>!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112019_HumbleBundle.png\"\

  >Pathfinder Comics Cache</a> also includes Pathfinder Director of Game Design Jason\
  \ Bulmahn’s Price of Immortality adventure module trilogy, featuring the original\
  \ Pathfinder First Edition starting dungeon, <i>Crypt of the Everflame</i>! This\
  \ adventure series, starring Jason’s favorite villain, the false god Razmir, is\
  \ the thematic basis for a great deal of Jason’s liveplay sessions over the last\
  \ year, from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/knightsofeverflame\">Knights of the Everflame</a>\
  \ to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOHNx3GvTFbEOBNu7-1MXQBI23PFYaz2Y\"\
  >Oblivion Oath</a> to the Glass Cannon Network’s hilarious <a href=\"glasscannonpodcast.com/the-pathfinder-playtest-parts-1-and-2/\"\
  >Pathfinder Second Edition Playtest</a>. The adventures are a great way to get some\
  \ extra insight into Jason’s madness. All Hail the Living God!</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/books/pathfinder-comics-cache-books?view=kVBbLwTgZo4q\"\
  >Pathfinder Comics Cache</a> gives you the chance to decide your price for more\
  \ than $275 worth of awesome comics and Pathfinder First Edition rulebooks and adventures!\
  \ Portions of proceeds from the effort go to benefit <a href=\"http://www.ranchoobiwan.org/about/mission/\"\
  >Rancho Obi-Wan</a>, a California Nonprofit that serves the public through the collection,\
  \ conservation, exhibition and interpretation of Star Wars memorabilia and artifacts,\
  \ using the collection to provide meaningful educational, aesthetic, intellectual\
  \ and cultural experiences for a wide array of audiences, including school tours\
  \ of the largest Star Wars collection in the world.</p> \n     <p>BUT WAIT, THERE’\
  S MORE!</p> \n     <p>Keep your eyes on Humble Bundle in December as well, as we’\
  ve got a huge Pathfinder First Edition bundle coming in the very near future. We’\
  ve included comics and rulebooks in several past bundles, but next month’s effort\
  \ will provide a huge number of never-before-bundled game books for anyone looking\
  \ to master the lore of the Age of Lost Omens. Keep watching this space for more\
  \ details, and get thee to the (virtual) comic shop! The <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/books/pathfinder-comics-cache-books?view=kVBbLwTgZo4q\"\
  >Pathfinder Comics Cache</a> awaits!</p> \n     <p>EXCELSIOR!</p> \n    </blockquote>\
