  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">In just about three weeks or so, you should\
  \ be seeing <a href=\"/products/btpy8vdl\"><i>Ultimate Campaign</i></a> arrive in\
  \ mailboxes and on store shelves. In anticipation of the release of this 256-page\
  \ hardcover, each week we are offering up a preview of what you will find inside.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Last week, we took a look at Chapter 1, which includes a mountain of\
  \ tables for helping you determine your character's backstory. This week, we are\
  \ moving on to Chapter 2, which is focused entirely on downtime. Heroes don't spend\
  \ every waking moment plundering tombs and fighting evils. (If they did, they would\
  \ reach 20th level before their next birthday.) The downtime system helps you plan\
  \ the time your character spends between adventures.</p> \n    <p>This versatile\
  \ system allows a character to undertake a number of different tasks to improve\
  \ himself or build his standing within the town he lives in. Need to swap out a\
  \ feat? The downtime system lets you do that. Want to train up your hit points because\
  \ you rolled poorly last time you gained a level? It's in there too. Have you always\
  \ wanted to open up your own tavern, or thieves guild, or wizard academy? The downtime\
  \ system has extensive rules for building a business or guild.</p> \n    <p>Using\
  \ this system you can spend the time between adventures earning various types of\
  \ currencies and spending those currencies to get the business, home, or fortress\
  \ you've always wanted. Structures and organizations are built in pieces, buying\
  \ each room and group individually so that you can get exactly what you want! Check\
  \ out a few of the rooms you can build.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n   \
