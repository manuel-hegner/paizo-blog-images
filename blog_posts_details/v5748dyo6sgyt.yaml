    \ activations. Activate: command, interact; Effect: You hold the wayfinder and\
    \ ask for guidance. The wayfinder casts guidance on you. Activate: command, interact;\
    \ Frequency: once per day; Effect: You call upon the wayfinder’s divine blessings\
    \ for yourself and your allies. The wayfinder casts bless, with an emanation centered\
    \ on itself. Once per turn, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate\
    \ trait, to increase the emanation’s radius by 5 feet."
