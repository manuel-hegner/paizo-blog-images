  artist: "Tyler Walpole... Beating its greasy, night-black wings, this gigantic two-headed\
    \ vulture picks across the ground upon two earth sheering talons. Craning its\
    \ twin massive heads forward, the terrible avian opens its giant twin beaks to\
    \ unleash a blood curdling shriek. Vadid and Nahk Preview Purloiners"
