  \ that I have been mulling over for some time (but have yet to mention in these\
  \ annotations) is the naming of the</em> Godsrain Prophecies. <em>By the time I\
  \ first heard of them, they had already been given that title, but nothing I have\
  \ read so far has given me any indication as to how or why. Personally, I would\
  \ never presume to name a collection of this potential impact and importance without\
  \ a very clear reason, lest I end up in a repeat of the Fatal Four disaster. (To\
  \ think that one scribe’s decision to include a bit of wordplay in their recounting\
  \ of a minor historical prophecy would lead to not one but two assassinations is\
  \ truly beyond the pale!) Issues like this are the reason that Lorminos insisted\
  \ I read</em> Notorious Names and Narrative Novelties: Navigating the Nuance of\
  \ Nomenclature <em>early on in my studies (a book that could easily have been 150\
  \ pages instead of over 700, in my personal opinion). While I must make reading\
  \ these prophecies a priority, I will also endeavor to track down the origin of\
  \ the word Godsrain. For one thing, it is possible there was a mistaken transcription\
  \ somewhere along the line. Perhaps they should instead be known as the God’s Reign\
  \ Prophecies, alluding to the end of a specific god’s reign? It is something to\
  \ at least consider.</em></p>\n      <p><em>–Yivali, Apprentice Researcher for the\

  >\n       <br>\n      </center>\n      <h2>The “Death” of Zon-Kuthon</h2>\n    \
  \  <p>Shelyn has tried countless times to touch the heart of Zon-Kuthon, but in\
  \ the end her music is what dooms the Midnight Lord. He’s long ignored his sister’\
  s tears, no matter how they stream or pool, collecting any that he can and using\
  \ them as salt to rub into followers’ wounds. Her pleading declarations he considers\
  \ almost background noise, a counterpoint that makes the pain that echoes through\
  \ the Netherworld sound that much more divine. But when she finds the beauty in\
  \ the way his Kuthites scream and whimper, weaves together suffering into a string\
  \ of rousing chords, builds melodies from dripping blood and rhythms from a clanging\
  \ chain? Only she could find the art in all the suffering he wields, a dulcet murmuring\
  \ that calls out from an orchestra of pain. <em>Dou-bral, brother, I love you still.\
  \ Dou-bral, come back to me.</em></p>\n      <p>With newfound strength, Dou-bral\
  \ returns, soul breaking through its cage of bones and kicking out the usurper who’\
  d lived beneath his skin. But even free he’s trapped inside a body built for cruelty,\
  \ his face a mask of agony that tells a brutal story—scars and cries and sharpened\
  \ blades, blood and tears and pain. The anguish he has known and caused, the torment\
  \ Zon-Kuthon embraced—how can he reconcile himself with all he now remembers? He\
  \ tries to flee back to his cell, to turn back into what he was, but Zon-Kuthon\
  \ is memory now and only he remains.</p>\n      <p>Dou-bral can feel divinity like\
  \ sparks beneath his fingertips, but with all that he’s done and been, he cannot\
  \ now reward himself and let himself play god. He takes the power in his hands (so\
  \ good now at destroying things) and rips it from his very being, leaving something\
  \ more than man but less than deity. He stumbles from the Netherworld, his ears\
  \ ringing with tortured screams (most of which are not his own), and makes his way\
  \ to Pangolais, as if Zon-Kuthon’s capital will help him understand the things his\
  \ other self has done. And when Shelyn walks next to him, her arm outstretched in\
  \ kindness, the glaive she’d taken from him offered up with open hands, he turns\
  \ his back and walks away, her music souring in his ears, reminding him of every\
  \ chain he used to break their father.</p>\n      <p>Art and beauty pay a price\
  \ for all that Shelyn’s sacrificed—the nightmares that disturbed her rest as she\
  \ crafted a song of pain, the knowledge that Dou-bral is back but still wrapped\
  \ up in suffering, the loss she feels from victory that’s nothing like she’d hoped.\
  \ In theaters and galleries, on stage and page and instrument, creative minds start\
  \ struggling—the colors dim, the music fades, the movements don’t flow smoothly—\
  and lovers’ disillusions grow as nothing feels the way it was, until the disappointment\
  \ drives some life-long pairs apart, an echo of a sadness that she cannot seem to\
  \ shake.</p>\n      <p>Dou-bral’s other flesh and blood, the spirit-wolf turned\
  \ Prince in Chains, roams the grounds of Xovaikain, trying to fill the absence that\
  \ his son has left behind. But for all his vicious howling, what is left of Thron\
  \ is not a god, and soon two new contenders come with plans to claim the Netherworld—\
  Asmodeus who wants to bring new pain to the unworthy, adding a few new items to\
  \ the tools he has for torment, and Iomedae, who seeks to free the souls still left\
  \ within the realm, turning their search for pain into a sacrifice for glory. Neither\
  \ willing to back down, they fortify positions, preparing for a battle that will\
  \ change the Netherworld.</p>\n      <p>Far from the squabbling of the gods, Dou-bral\
  \ travels through Nidal, hoping that he will find some path to redemption. Instead,\
  \ he watches Cheliax, no longer held by ancient pact to stay within its borderlines,\
  \ begin to take Nidalese lands, while members of the Umbral Court each claim to\
  \ be Zon-Kuthon’s heir and stab each other in the back to claim his legacy.</p>\n\

  \ honest here: Zon-Kuthon terrifies me! Always has. And yet this prophecy wasn’\
  t scary at all. At least not to me. My Lady, I know, fears little, but I have been\
  \ feeling the whole set of emotions during these annotations—terrified one minute\
  \ and smiling the next. I truly thought I would be shivering after reading this,\
  \ but I think I feel more sad than anything. Miss Shelyn trying so hard to free\
  \ her brother and achieving her goal, only for him to reciprocate no love? It almost\
  \ reminds me of my role in collecting these prophecies. I have wanted to be a part\
  \ of something big to show my Lady how I can be of help to her for some time, and\
  \ yet that means collecting a group of so-called prophecies that could be devastating\
  \ in the wrong hands. It is odd to think of the gods having the same types of problems\
  \ that the rest of us sometimes do. We revere them, and yet, especially as I read\
  \ these prophecies, they seem more… mortal somehow? Or not. I hope that doesn’t\
  \ sound too disrespectful. Best to leave this line of thought behind and move on\
  \ to the next prophecy.</em></p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\
