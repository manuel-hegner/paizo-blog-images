  \ \n     <p>What are you doing out here alone? Don’t get me wrong—I’m excited to\
  \ see you amidst all this! Seeing that old statue fall in front of the embassy is\
  \ a splendid reason to skip your studies. This is history in the making, sister!\
  \ Let it fill your senses; a book won’t give you the same gift as these liberated\
  \ streets. But how did you slip past Mielle? I know she’s gotten older, but with\
  \ each year her senses have only sharpened—the old panther. Tell me how you escaped,\
  \ and don’t say you learned it from me! I could never slip her gaze, and I’ve the\
  \ welts to prove it.</p> \n     <p>Do you like my outfit? In truth it’s a bit Chelish\
  \ for my taste, but it moves much better than what I left home with. When I have\
  \ time, I’ll make use of Mielle’s needlepoint lessons and fashion something more\
  \ reminiscent of home. </p> \n     <p>I don’t look like a Free Captain’s cohort,\
  \ Jiella! Only a Firebrand would wear colors this loud, and this city could take\
  \ more than a few cues from our fashion sense! I’d bet Bapa’s skiff that you’ve\
  \ never even seen those privateers up close. I’ve had to cut through two of them\
  \ in the past month.</p> \n     <p>Where did I get the sword? Promise you won’t\
  \ tell—else I’ll never be able to come home! It belonged to Mama. I don’t know why\
  \ she had it; all those diplomacies to nowhere she conducted in our living room\
  \ could have been cut much shorter with this. It felt heavy at first, but after\
  \ a couple months fighting on these shackled seas, my arm feels incomplete without\
  \ it. That stain on my sleeve? It’s just a bit of wine. I may need a wash it—don’\
  t give me that look, Jie!</p> \n     <p>Were Mama and Bapa home when you slipped\
  \ out? There are some articles I’ve meant to procure from my room now that things\
  \ have started to settle. </p> \n     <p>Mielle has been preparing full meals every\
  \ night since the Hurricane Queen faffed off to the other side of Desperation Bay?\
  \ I’ll have to stop home and grab a bottle of her kremas to share with my ship.\
  \ It’s requisite for a Firebrand to know how to share—and the old panther owes me\
  \ more than one drink for her rigor. Let’s get you home so I can collect my libationary\
  \ toll.</p> \n     <p>You wear these clothes much better than I did. Most outfits\
  \ suit me better after they’ve been thoroughly sea-bitten. I see that you’ve been\
  \ eating well—as Mama and Bapa told you to, no doubt. I assume they give my share\
  \ to you now that I’ve been gone a season. It seems like you’ve grown a half-foot!\
  \ I bet you’ll be taller than me by year’s end. </p> \n     <p>I don’t mean to make\
  \ them worry, you know. I just never fit what they needed. It’s embarrassing how\
  \ much better you are with words than I was at your age. I think they can see that\
  \ you fit them better, too. I hope they miss me. I miss them. I’ve been thinking\
  \ of them a lot—and you, of course. I see you snuck out of your window to see what\
  \ the crash was! You’re more like me than I thought. I’m a bad influence on you,\
  \ Jiella! Let me boost you back up. I’ll be right behind you. Once we’re inside,\
  \ give me for a moment to track down Mielle’s kremas stock—if she’s made multiple\
  \ batches, she won’t be too upset if one of them goes missing.</p> \n     <p>May\
  \ I fashion your hair like we used to do together? I’ve been working on a new style\
  \ for the times; twelve braids fashioned like a crown: one for each month from now\
  \ to keep Vidrian autonomous. If Mama asks who did your hair, just deflect with\
  \ that. I’m sure she’ll appreciate the idea. I have a message for her and Bapa,\
  \ too. They can’t trust the ‘Independent’ Banks of Vidrian, even if they can trust\
  \ Mandla Dube. Please pass this onto them and say it came from the Vane—they’ll\
  \ take it more seriously than from me.</p> \n     <p>I must go now, sister, but\
  \ take this turquoise comb for your new crown. With it, you’ll look almost as dashing\
  \ as me! In a few years, Mama and Bapa will want you with them in the Vidric Council—\
  and you should join them when that time comes. Don’t forget about the streets, though!\
  \ Look around, there’s so much to rebuild and replace. New homes to be made, new\
  \ stores to spread the wealth, new dishes to define the taste of Vidrian as its\
  \ own. No idols are going to show our nation the way forward, whether they’re deities\
  \ or nobles, but our community can figure it out together. When the council dissolves\
  \ into noise, go somewhere else to cut through it. Don’t fight, but be like a sword.\
  \ Leave the sharp stuff to me as you rebuild this place. I’ll be in step with you—\
  but first, I’m off to Smuggler’s Shiv to procure a donation to our new nation. Crying\
  \ isn’t going to keep me from leaving! I’ll be back again before you know it. And\
  \ not as one of that isle’s specters.</p> \n     <p>I love you, Jiella—Mama and\
  \ Bapa, too. They’ll approve of my course in due time—and they’ll let you set yours.\
  \ For now, you should listen to them. Eventually, they’ll see how much the future\
  \ needs my blade and your words.<br> So don’t cry too long. I’m not dead yet. </p>\
