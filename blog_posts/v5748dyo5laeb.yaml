  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Don't make Amiri angry,\
  \ you won't like her when she's angry. Of all of our iconics, none is more focused\
  \ on dishing out pain than the barbarian. Although her stat block shows her damage\
  \ while raging, it does not include Power Attack, which would give her a –5 on attack\
  \ rolls, but increase her damage to 2d6+34. If she were to score a critical hit,\
  \ while using Greater Vital Strike and Power Attack, her damage would jump to 10d6+68\
  \ and her victim would take 2d6 points of bleed damage each round thereafter. Enough\
  \ with the math though, lets get in to some of the specifics of the barbarian.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>To start off, let's take a look at rage. In the Beta version of the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG rules, barbarians received a pool of rage points that they could spend on\
  \ rounds of rage and to activate various rage powers. We have simplified this for\
  \ the final, making it so that the barbarian now only needs to track the total number\
  \ of rounds of rage per day. This starts at 4 + her Constitution modifier and increases\
  \ by 2 for every level beyond 1st, meaning that even a 1st-level barbarian can rage\
  \ more than once per day, so long as they are short rages. She also spends only\
  \ 1 round of rage per round, regardless of the type of rage she is using (this is\
  \ a change from the Beta).</p> \n   <p>Rage powers were added to the barbarian early\
  \ on in the design. These powers can only be used while raging and allow the barbarian\
  \ to perform fantastic feats of Strength, make more powerful attacks, and terrify\
  \ those around her. Since these no long consume rage points, most have been reworked\
  \ to be used only once per rage or once per day. Rage powers are gained at 2nd level\
  \ and the barbarian gains an additional power for every two levels beyond that.\
  \ Let's take a closer look at Amiri's specific powers.</p> \n   <blockquote>\n \
  \   <p><b>Fearless Rage</b>: With this power, which cannot be selected until 12th\
  \ level, Amiri is immune to shaken and frightened condition while raging.<br> <b>Increased\
  \ Damage Reduction:</b> While raging, Amiri's DR increases to 5/—.<br> <b>Intimidating\
  \ Glare</b>: With this power, Amiri can attempt to Initimidate one adjacent foe\
  \ as a move action, causing them to become shaken for 1d4 rounds +1 round for every\
  \ 5 points by which her check exceeds the DC.<br> <b>Knockback</b>: Once per round,\
  \ Amiri can use this power make a bull rush attempt against a foe in place of a\
  \ melee attack. If successful, the target takes damage equal to her Strength modifier\
  \ and is moved back without Amiri needing to follow.<br> <b>Powerful Blow</b>: Once\
  \ per rage, Amiri can use this power as a swift action to add +5 to one melee damage\
  \ roll. This bonus scales as she gains levels.<br> <b>Renewed Vigor</b>: Once per\
  \ day, while raging, Amiri can use this power to heal herself. It starts at only\
  \ 1d8 + her Constitution modifier, but scales as she gains level. Amiri must be\
  \ 4th level before taking this power.<br> <b>Superstition</b>: This new rage power\
  \ gives a barbarian a morale bonus on all saves against spells, supernatural abilities,\
  \ and spell-like abilities while raging. While valuable, it comes with the drawback.\
  \ While raging, Amiri cannot be the willing target of any spell and must attempt\
  \ to resist all spells, even those case by allies.<br> <b>Terrifying Howl</b>: Amiri\
  \ had to take Intimidating Glare before she could select this 8th-level rage power.\
  \ As a standard action, Amiri can unleash a blood-curdling war cry that causes all\
  \ shaken enemies within 30 feet to make a Will save or become panicked for 1d4+1\
  \ rounds. Once a foe has made a save, successful or not, they are immune to this\
  \ power for 24 hours.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>These powers are designed to\
  \ give the barbarian a few more options in combat besides running up and murdering\
  \ folks (although there are plenty that do that too). During the Beta, there were\
  \ a few rage powers that did not really fit the theme (such as the one that did\
  \ elemental damage), but these have been trimmed in favor of abilities that are\
  \ all exceptional abilities. You might see some supernatural rage powers in later\
  \ books, but they will be tied to specific themes.</p> \n   <p>Beyond the changes\
  \ to rage and the addition of rage powers, not much else has changed with the barbarian.\
  \ She still gets greater and mighty rage at high levels, damage reduction, uncanny\
  \ dodge, and trap sense. We added Acrobatics and Knowledge (nature) to her list\
  \ of class skills. The other changes of note here are in her feats. Critical Focus\
  \ and Bleeding Critical give her a +4 bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical\
  \ hits and anyone who takes a critical hit also gains 2d6 points of bleed (damage\
  \ that recurs each round until healed). Iron Will works as before, but Improved\
  \ Iron Will lets Amiri reroll one Will Save made each day, after the first roll\
  \ is made but before the results are revealed. Toughness grants +1 hit point per\
  \ level, with a minimum of +3 hit points (so +3 until you reach 4th level, at which\
  \ point it becomes +4). Finally, there is Power Attack, which grants a +2 bonus\
  \ on damage for a –1 penalty on attack rolls. When your base attack bonus reaches\
  \ +4, and for every 4 beyond +4, the bonus to damage increases by +2 and the penalty\
  \ increase by –1. Wielding a two-handed weapon increases the damage by 50%, whereas\
  \ off-hand weapons get only half the damage bonus. Just thought I would let that\
  \ cat out of the bag, since there has been quite a bit of speculation as to the\
  \ exact formula.</p> \n   <p>There are only four more previews before the release\
  \ of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>! If I can find her, next week we will take a look\
  \ at Merisiel, the iconic rogue.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead Designer</p>\
