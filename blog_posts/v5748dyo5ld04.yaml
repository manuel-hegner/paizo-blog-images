  \ Lucien Soulban</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Three: Hands Off</h2> \n    <p>Darvin cursed\
  \ himself for not thinking, for not realizing how Fife would react. He'd raced halfway\
  \ across the circular chamber, running for the door, when he realized something\
  \ was amiss. He couldn't feel Fife's familiar presence, that steady pressure by\
  \ his side. Darvin turned to see Fife frozen near the collapsed passageway. All\
  \ around them, from the shadows of the laboratory, a legion of amputated hands rushed\
  \ forward on blade-sheathed fingers, skittering like spiders in a mad dash for the\
  \ intruders.</p> \n    <p> \"Spider,\" Fife said breathlessly as Darvin ran back\
  \ to him, scooped him up, and dropped the halfling over his shoulder.</p> \n   \
  \ <p> \"Not spiders!\" Darvin said, hoping to cut his friend free from his terror.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Spider!\" Fife yelled, and batted at Darvin's back.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Ah!\" Darvin cried, surprised, and a hand dropped away from his backpack. He booted\
  \ it away quickly, before it could spring back up onto its fingers.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Runrunrun!\" Fife screamed.</p> \n    <p>Darvin hesitated. The hands converged on\
  \ them the same way water flows down the slope, their fingers blurs of galloping\
  \ motion and the opportunity for escape gone in an instant. Two more hands appeared\
  \ from the hole through which they'd entered the room. </p> \n    <p>Darvin leapt\
  \ into action, taking long strides, hurdling amputated hands that leapt and grabbed\
  \ for them. He spun this way and that, clumsily avoiding attackers as his companion's\
  \ weight threatened to topple his balance. Fife protected his back, wildly swinging\
  \ his bag of notebooks at the hands lunging at them from behind. One such assault\
  \ thwacked Darvin on the backside.</p> \n    <p>\"Ow!\" Darvin yelped. \"That was\
  \ a corner!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Run!\" Fife replied.</p> \n    <p>The hands closed\
  \ in, barely heeding or pausing at the blows that sent them careening back. They\
  \ outnumbered the pair, and Darvin could only react, not make any real progress.\
  \ He threw Fife on the high workshop table, breaking vials and scattering jars and\
  \ books, before leaping atop it himself. The hands scrambled up the sides of the\
  \ table. </p> \n    <p>We're surrounded, Darvin realized.</p> \n    <p></p>\n  \
  \  <center>\n     ∗∗∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>Fife swung his bag like\
  \ a mace, shattering glass and dislodging metal fingers that crested the lip of\
  \ the table. Behind him, Darvin stomped digits and booted away hands, but the crawling\
  \ horrors possessed a heedless relentlessness. They landed a few feet away on the\
  \ stone floor, recovered almost instantly, and scrambled back for the table.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"We're dead!\" Darvin screamed. \"We are so very much dead!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Fife wanted to respond, but hearing his brother's panic only tightened its\
  \ grip around his own throat, stopping him from speaking. The hands had them trapped,\
  \ a dozen feet away from the other door and under the relentless assault of their\
  \ diminutive foes. This is all my fault. He had dragged them into this misadventure.\
  \ \"I'm sorry,\" he managed.</p> \n    <p>A pair of hands grabbed Fife's waist,\
  \ and before he realized what was happening, Darvin had hoisted him up, toward the\
  \ wagon-wheel chandelier above their heads. Fife barely had time to grab it before\
  \ Darvin let go.</p> \n    <p>\"Save yourself!\" Darvin said.</p> \n    <p>The wheel\
  \ swung on a rusted chain, creaking and groaning. Particles of dust trickled down\
  \ from the chain's anchor in the ceiling. Fife managed to slip upward through the\
  \ spokes and atop the wheel before he looked down. The table looked like an island\
  \ in a relentless sea of moving hands. The smell of rotten eggs and decaying flesh\
  \ drifted up from the mess.</p> \n    <p>\"Darvin! Climb!\" Fife extended his arm\
  \ down to pull up his brother. Darvin busied himself kicking the hands away, trying\
  \ to keep track of the table's four sides. His movements grew frantic and wilder\
  \ as exhaustion weighed more heavily upon him. </p> \n    <p>When Darvin didn't\
  \ respond, Fife stretched down and grabbed for his brother in desperation, catching\
  \ only a handful of the man's long, sandy hair. </p> \n    <p>\"Ah!\" Darvin cried,\
  \ trying to kick the hands, maintain his balance, and not have a halfling-sized\
  \ fistful of hair torn out by the roots.</p> \n    <p>\"Jump up!\" Fife ordered.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"My hair!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Damn your hair! Jump!\" </p> \n    <p>One\
  \ of the amputated hands grabbed Darvin's ankle, and he kicked it away before jumping\
  \ up. He grabbed the spokes. The wheel creaked, the chain groaned, and the pair\
  \ swung ponderously to and fro. The hands jumped up on the tabletop and jockeyed\
  \ for position. A few of them tried springing up to grab Darvin's feet, but he pulled\
  \ his legs up quickly and threaded them through the spokes.</p> \n    <p>\"Now what?\"\
  \ Darvin asked, whispering and looking at Fife through the gap.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I have a plan,\" Fife whispered back.</p> \n    <p>\"Why are we whispering? They\
  \ don't have ears... do they?\" He craned his neck to look back down at the hands.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Climb up,\" Fife said, even as something in the ceiling creaked loudly.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It won't take my weight!\" Darvin hissed.</p> \n    <p>\"Exactly,\"\
  \ Fife said, grinning. \"Now climb!\"</p> \n    <p></p>\n    <center>\n     ∗∗∗\n\
  \    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p> Darvin remained dubious as only an older sibling\
  \ could. Now atop the wheel, he froze and grimaced as more dust poured through the\
  \ ceiling bolts and the wood complained beneath them. </p> \n    <p>They would fall.\
  \ That much he knew, looking down at the table with all the hands jumping up, trying\
  \ to grab at them. </p> \n    <p>\"Now what?\"</p> \n    <p> Fife grinned in response\
  \ and pushed himself up from his belly before thrusting himself down. The chain\
  \ screeched in complaint and the wheel wobbled.</p> \n    <p> \"Wait!\" Darvin said.\
  \ \"What're you—\"</p> \n    <p> Fife pushed again. \"Help me!\" he said.</p> \n\
  \    <p> Darvin suddenly understood. \"The gods save us from your lunacy!\" he said,\
  \ and braced against the ceiling, pressing down against the wheel with his legs.</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"Are they tiny gods?\" Fife asked.</p> \n    <p> The chain didn't snap,\
  \ but instead broke from the ceiling anchors and dropped them, heavy wheel, unspooled\
  \ chain, and all. The chandelier struck the tabletop with a crash of falling mortar,\
  \ breaking glass, and the squish-thud-crack of pulped hands. The impact hammered\
  \ the air from the brothers' lungs.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Hand.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n     <br>\
  \ \"What fell force created and compels the bladed hands?\"\n    </div> \n    <p>\
  \ Hands crawled away, their fingers snapped, small bones exposed. Some lay dead\
  \ like curled-up spiders. Others rolled away to safety. </p> \n    <p>\"We killed\
  \ them,\" Fife whispered, but Darvin pulled him away. </p> \n    <p>\"C'mon! Let's\
  \ go!\"</p> \n    <p> They bolted for the door even as the surviving hands sprang\
  \ or wobbled to their digits. Ignoring whatever shock or injury the intruders had\
  \ meted out, the hands immediately set after them in hot pursuit.</p> \n    <p>\
  \ Darvin pulled at the door and sighed gratefully when he realized it wasn't locked.\
  \ In fact, the passageway angled upward. The two brothers ducked through and Darvin\
  \ slammed the door shut behind them, laughed despite himself—a desperate, exhausted\
  \ bark of triumph and relief. </p> \n    <p>Then he caught Fife's expression. Following\
  \ his brother's gaze, Darvin looked down and saw the small square at the bottom\
  \ of the door, crowned by a hinge. Darvin knew he should understand what it meant,\
  \ but his adrenaline-addled brain wasn't quite up to the challenge. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  What is—?\" he began, but Fife interrupted him.</p> \n    <p> \"It's a dog door!\"\
  \ the halfling cried.</p> \n    <p> That's silly, Darvin thought. \"But I didn't\
  \ see a—\" </p> \n    <p>The first hand barreled through the swinging door, and\
  \ Fife stamped desperately on it. The door shuddered as multiple thuds struck it,\
  \ and several hands wedged at the small access as they all struggled to get through\
  \ next. </p> \n    <p>Darvin acted, kicking the hinged flap and scattering the hands\
  \ back into the room. He turned to find Fife no longer kicking the hand in question,\
  \ but instead jumping up and down with both feet, knees as high as his chest, vigorously\
  \ stomping the amputated monstrosity into the ground.</p> \n    <p> \"Die, spider!\"\
  \ Fife screamed. \"Die, die, die!\"</p> \n    <p> \"It's already dead, dead, dead,\"\
  \ Darvin said, and grabbed Fife, pulling him along the passageway. The human did\
  \ pause, however, and stomp heavily on the hand one last time before the pair bolted.</p>\
  \ \n    <p> They ran hard, past shadowed corners and down strange passageways. Fife\
  \ glanced through doorways, almost distracting himself once when he spied ancient\
  \ tomes lining long bookshelves in one study. Darvin, however, grabbed Fife and\
  \ pulled him along; he knew well how the halfling's natural curiosity overcame his\
  \ survival instincts.</p> \n    <p> Finally, the corridor dead-ended at a doorway,\
  \ the wood etched with strange arcane patterns of sweeping, curving meridian designs.\
  \ Darvin glanced back behind them, but the stampede of hands was nowhere to be seen.\
  \ He raised a foot to kick open the rune-marked door.</p> \n    <p>\"No!\" Fife\
  \ screamed, and tackled Darvin's thigh.</p> \n    <p> Darvin grabbed the wall for\
  \ balance and tried to shake his friend loose. \"Do you mind?\" Darvin asked, calmly.</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"You don't know what those markings mean!\" Fife said, arms wrapped\
  \ tight around Darvin's leg. \"It could be trapped!\"</p> \n    <p> Darvin sighed.\
  \ He just wanted to get away from here, from the village, from this entire ordeal\
  \ as soon as possible. \"Why would anyone trap their home?\"</p> \n    <p> \"Why\
  \ would he lop off hands and animate them?\" Fife asked, letting go. </p> \n   \
  \ <p> \"Maybe he couldn't afford a full staff?\" Darvin offered.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  The point is, who knows what he was thinking?\" Fife said. \"Remember the Tale of\
  \ the Moaning Virgin's Ghost?\"</p> \n    <p>\"You mean the one you wrote?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Actually,\" Darvin said, \"I've been meaning\
  \ to talk to you about that one. I don't think you thought the title through.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Darvin!\" Fife said, eyeing the door. \"What I mean is, I research\
  \ my material for authenticity. The wizard in that story trapped the door to keep\
  \ something inside. It's based on a real spell!\"</p> \n    <p> Darvin thought for\
  \ a moment. \"Alright,\" he said. \"In that story, how did I open that door?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"You...\" To Darvin's satisfaction, Fife hesitated.</p> \n    <p> \"\
  I kicked it open, didn't I?\" Darvin demanded.</p> \n    <p> \"Yes,\" Fife said.\
  \ \"But that was a story. And you got cursed in it.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Right,\" Darvin\
  \ said, and kicked open the door.</p> \n    <p>The runes splintered under the breaking\
  \ wood, glowing brightly for a moment before fading from the frame. Fife groaned\
  \ in worry, but Darvin shoved his way through. </p> \n    <p> Fresh air swept across\
  \ them, driving away the pungent, earthy smell of decay and replacing it with the\
  \ dewy wetness of night and grassy hills and wind-ruffled trees. Moonlight filtered\
  \ through the branches and the pair pushed forward, thrashing their way through\
  \ the bush that hid the doorway and its rocky outcropping. The air felt infinitely\
  \ better than the stink of death behind them. </p> \n    <p>Darvin collapsed on\
  \ the grass, staring up at the night sky and laughed gratefully. Fife did not join\
  \ him. Instead, the halfling peered back through the shrubs, checking the passageway\
  \ they'd left. </p> \n    <p>\"We lost them,\" Darvin said. \"Stop worrying.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"They're tireless,\" Fife said thoughtfully. \"Single-minded. Why'd\
  \ they stop?\"</p> \n    <p> \"Maybe they can't leave the ruins.\"</p> \n    <p>\
  \ \"They've killed local farmers. They go out.\"</p> \n    <p> Darvin sighed and\
  \ struggled to sit up. \"Then why, oh great storyteller?\"</p> \n    <p> Fife shook\
  \ his head. Darvin could tell he didn't know, but the halfling examined their surroundings.\
  \ Darvin glanced around as well.</p> \n    <p> They rested on the side of a great\
  \ hill, one wave in a sea of green rolling dunes that stretched out in all directions.\
  \ The clouds had rolled away, the face of the moon showing at full light this evening.\
  \ Even Darvin could see clearly, though he trusted Fife's eyes more in the darkness.\
  \ He peered into the countryside, noting the green and rocky landscape, this cluster\
  \ of stones one of many among the companion hills.</p> \n    <p> Further south,\
  \ below them, lay the dotted lights of the village, silent and tranquil in the distance.\
  \ Then something caught Fife's attention and he waved frantically, pointing down\
  \ the valley. </p> \n    <p>Between them and the village, the tall grass rustled\
  \ and small dark things scrambled over the rocks, some slower than others. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"The hands,\" Fife said, horrified. </p> \n    <p>Darvin followed the\
  \ line of movement, projecting their path until his eyes came to rest on the sleepy\
  \ collection of buildings in the distance.</p> \n    <p> \"We have to go,\" Fife\
  \ said. \"They're going after the village!\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
