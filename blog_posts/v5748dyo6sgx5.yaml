  >Without warning, they arrived in our system, broke through our orbital defenses,\
  \ and streamed out of the sky in untold numbers. They landed near the massive freshwater\
  \ lake known as the Stone Sea, and our closest fighting force, the 5th Battalion\
  \ attempted to hold them off. The 5th Battalion suffered great losses, possibly\
  \ the largest number of deaths in a single military action in all of our history.\
  \ However, the sacrifices of those brave souls allowed us to mobilize the rest of\
  \ our troops for a defense of the entire planet.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n    </div> \n    <p>Now, the Swarm continues to make advances across our world,\
  \ and we are fighting to hold on to every inch. The Suskillon Defense Force needs\
  \ every sentient from the bustling metropolis of Brinnoa to the farms of the Sahtor\
  \ Region to chip in and do their part, especially if they are able and willing to\
  \ pick up a weapon and fight! Enlist at your nearest SDF recruitment center today\
  \ to help replenish the depleted ranks of the 5th Battalion or else the Swarm will\
  \ surely overrun our home planet.</p> \n    <p>When you join up, you’ll receive\
  \ a brief but rigorous training course, ensuring that you are familiar with your\
  \ issued weapon and armor and can work within a squad. You will also receive your\
  \ IDENT, a miniaturized computer embedded in an SDF insignia that holds your vital\
  \ records and health information, useful for identifying you should the worst happen.\
  \ Finally, you will be given access to the wide array of items available in the\
  \ SDF armory, including pressure-sensitive gel pads for your feet that help to ease\
  \ the pain of long marches. Other innovations are more recent and are directly related\
  \ to our fight against the Swarm. The so-called pulse ray, when used properly, can\
  \ temporarily scramble the minds of those creatures with telepathy, such as used\
  \ in the Swarm hive mind!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/090919_CareerTrooper.jpg\"\

  \ every advantage you can get when you find yourself face-to-ugly-mandibled-face\
  \ with the dozens of types of Swarm creatures that have invaded our world. While\
  \ Swarm dredgers are small, they can burrow and are known to tunnel under our fortifications\
  \ to attack unsuspecting soldiers. Swarm vorphomas can fling envenomed barbs from\
  \ their skinny arms and can mentally sow fear and confusion within our ranks. Swarm\
  \ convecytes can actually carrying other Swarm creatures under their protective\
  \ plates, making them effective living transports, and to make matter worse, explode\
  \ in a burst of acid when killed. Many more Swarm creatures have been encountered\
  \ in the fields of battle, and scientists speculate there are even more out there,\
  \ waiting to descend and devour.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
