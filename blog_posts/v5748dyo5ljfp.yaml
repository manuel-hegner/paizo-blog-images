  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to the New Year! We took\
  \ a hiatus from the blog the past few weeks as the team took some time off to recharge\
  \ the batteries and spend time with family and friends. But vacation time is over\
  \ and now we are back, jumping in and getting things done. So this blog is a bit\
  \ of a hodgepodge and includes some kudos, some updates, and lots of information.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Five Star Promotions</h2> \n    <p>One of the best parts of being OPC\
  \ involves congratulating GMs when they reach milestones. I love watching players\
  \ make the transition to the other side of the screen, though it can be daunting\
  \ at first, and seeing their excitement when they run their 10th game and earn their\
  \ 1st star. I also enjoy hearing about GMs reaching their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th star\
  \ achievements. But the emails I receive when a GM qualifies for their 5th are some\
  \ of my most enjoyable to read. They are filled with anecdotes and examples of the\
  \ quality of our GMs. They embrace many of the reasons I love working with the organized\
  \ play program. Friendly, helpful, patient, supportive—all adjectives used to describe\
  \ our current batch of of recipients. I am extremely pleased to award a 5th star\
  \ to the following GMs:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Keith Apperson</li> \n     <li>Matt\
  \ Lewis</li> \n     <li>Helen Yau</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>As a note, that makes\
  \ 123 new 5-star GMs in 2016 and 271 total 5-star GMs. Whoot!</p> \n    <h2>Venture-Officers</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Pathfinder Society is bigger than ever. We ended the year with 771 Venture-Officers\
  \ in 50 US States, 36 countries, and 6 continents. The breakdown was 11 Regional\
  \ Venture-Coordinators, 155 Venture-Captains, 241 Venture-Lieutenants, and 364 Venture-Agents.\
  \ To the current Venture-Officers corps, thank you for taking time to coordinate\
  \ organized play in your area. Your efforts are GREATLY appreciated</p> \n    <p>Despite\
  \ these numbers, we are not everywhere. So if you are reading this, don't have Pathfinder\
  \ Society in your area, and think you would like to help organize some PFS activities,\
  \ send an email to your Regional –Venture Coordinator and let them know your interest.\
  \ Their emails are found on the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/coordinators\">Coordinator's\
  \ Page</a>.</p> \n    <h2>Lead Applications</h2> \n    <p>Thank you to all who responded\
  \ to my call for convention lead/sub lead applications a few blogs back. I sent\
  \ a reply to all those received, so if you submitted it and didn't hear from me,\
  \ please drop me a line asap and let me know. Our next step is reviewing the applications\
  \ and setting up interviews with the applicants, the current convention leads, and\
  \ the Pathfinder Society team. Will have more information soon on our selectees.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Convention Volunteers</h2> \n    <p>Speaking of conventions—we are gearing\
  \ up for another great year of events. This year, the Pathfinder Society team is\
  \ soliciting directly for volunteers at Gen Con, PaizoCon, and PAX West. Watch this\
  \ space fore more information—Gen Con will go out by the end of January, PaizoCon\
  \ is slotted for Feb/March, and PAX West for March/April.</p> \n    <p>Besides the\
  \ three above, which I take a direct hand in organizing, there are many other great\
  \ conventions throughout the world. UK Games Expo, Origins, PaizoCon Oz, PAX East/South,\
  \ PaizoCon UK, DragonCon, Kublacon, Contingency, TotalCon, Con of the North, OrcCon,\
  \ MegaCon, Who's Yer Con, DundraCon, Winter War, and U-Con are just a few of our\
  \ conventions with huge numbers of Pathfinder Society events. We encourage you to\
  \ volunteer for other conventions in your area. If interested, contact a Venture-Officer\
  \ local to the convention, who will know who to get in touch with to volunteer.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Regional Support Package Update</h2> \n    <p>Last year, we rolled out\
  \ an initiative that we originally titled \"Game Day\" support, but changed to Regional\
  \ Support Packages (RSP) as the term \"Game Day\" had different connotations depending\
  \ on the people involved. The RSPs met with favor, but the program was decidedly\
  \ clunky and difficult to implement. So we went back to the drawing board. After\
  \ much brainstorming and feedback from the Regional Venture-Coordinators, we think\
  \ we have a revised program that is user-friendly and supports Pathfinders in every\
  \ region. This week, we are taking it to the Venture-Officers as a whole. Provided\
  \ they don't put major holes in the plan, we will roll it out for Society use in\
  \ February.</p> \n    <h2>Guide to Roleplaying Guild 8.1</h2> \n    <p>Still working\
  \ on this one. While overall opinion of the new structure is positive, the drastic\
  \ change left some necessary pieces on the cutting floor. Add in a few new ideas\
  \ and you get a bit of a muddle. We are working on revising the wording and replacing\
  \ the missing pieces, but time is at a premium and other projects, like getting\
  \ scenarios out the door and keeping convention support flowing, take precedence.\
  \ I'm hoping to buckle down and get moving on this project. There are lots of great\
  \ message board threads that outline the biggest issues, so I'm reading those and\
  \ going forward. Will update everyone when we have progress.</p> \n    <h2>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Academy</h2> \n    <p>Last year at Gen Con, we released the third in a\
  \ series of lessons for new gamers, targeting our younger gamers but useful for\
  \ anyone new to the game. With it came a new series of quests <i>Angel's Flight</i>,\
  \ written specifically to accompany the Transitions lessons. Over the past few months,\
  \ we returned to Beginner and Advanced Lessons and melded them into a harmonious\
  \ three-part arc. What is still missing is the overarching \"How to use\" document.\
  \ It is being written and once we have it, PSA will be ready for launch! Until the\
  \ program is officially released, component pieces are not sanctioned for PFS play.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Additional Resources</h2> \n    <p>One of the biggest barriers in getting\
  \ Additional Resources updated is getting the team together to discuss publications\
  \ and what is right for inclusion in our Organized Play programs. The holidays play\
  \ havoc with scheduling, but now that things are a bit settled, we hope to have\
  \ an update soon.</p> \n    <p>I intended to include a spotlight on one of our fastest\
  \ growing areas, but the blog is already chockablock with information. I think I\
  \ will save the profile for another day, but will leave you a hint of where I'm\
  \ talking about. Let's see if you can guess it before next week's blog:</p> \n \
  \   <p>This location has average summer temperatures ranging from 14-25 C (57-75\
  \ F).</p> \n    <p>Don't forget, John Compton is out at S.C.A.R.A.B this weekend.\
  \ If your attending, stop by and say hi!</p> \n    <p>Until next time—Explore, Report,\
  \ Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
