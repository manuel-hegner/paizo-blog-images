  \       </tr>\n      </tbody>\n     </table>\n    </div> \n    <p>Cave raptors are\
  \ sated; it's time to blog!</p> \n    <p>My father taught me a very important lesson\
  \ as a young goblin: never try to eat a live cat. He also taught me that anything\
  \ that is truly important to you requires sacrifice. And not the fun sort of sacrifice,\
  \ where you get the family together for dinner and grandma bakes stollen and we\
  \ all sacrifice a bound-and-gagged human for the greater glory of Lamashtu. No,\
  \ it demands the unpleasant sort of sacrifice.</p> \n    <p>Gaming is important\
  \ to me, and this weekend, it took its sacrifice. While running my favorite Pathfinder\
  \ campaign, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/35E/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</a>, and pantomiming the grisly death of a moderately important\
  \ NPC, I took a pratfall that resulted in the unthinkable: my glasses were snapped\
  \ like so much optometric seagull bone.</p> \n    <p>With my uncanny goblin skills\
  \ (and a healthy supply of glue and wire), the break was easy to patch, but the\
  \ damage has been done. I now sport the Prometheus Unbound of eyewear, and my shame\
  \ is without end. No longer am I the office beauty, as any goblin should be, but\
  \ rather a misshapen and hideous creature, no better than a common kobold. My game\
  \ took a sacrifice of my dignity...</p> \n    <p>It also made a sacrifice of the\
  \ 2d6 copper pieces I have jealously guarded since I was declared a 'combatant'\
  \ at adolescence, but until we get into silver pieces, money just doesn't compare\
  \ to dignity.</p> \n    <p>But I am not alone. Any serious gamer has had to make\
  \ at least one sacrifice or compromise for the sake of roleplaying, and if I have\
  \ to wear my sacrifice on the bridge of my nose for a few days, so be it! That delightful\
  \ Tom Hanks fellow <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084314/\" target=\"nofollow\"\
  >sacrificed his dignity for gaming</a>, and look at him now! Sacrifice is an important\
  \ element in the stories we tell around the table: it adds the cost that makes a\
  \ victory valuable or the pathos that makes an encounter memorable. And the little\
  \ sacrifices we as players make are no less important or memorable than the spectacular\
  \ tragedies our characters make, and probably mean more to us in the end.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Roleplaying is worth a little hassle now and then for the happiness it brings,\
  \ the friendships it forges, the occasional romance it inspires, and the birth of\
  \ Warduke, who will unite us all beneath his iron fist. My sacrifice amused my friends\
  \ and made their table experience that much more real, and I'm sure it will give\
  \ my coworkers a few laughs as well. So as oxymoronic as it may be, I'll wear my\
  \ wounded dignity with pride until I can get to the optometrist this weekend.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But until then, I can't see jack.</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n   \
