    \ hand out, casting an upside down teardrop-shaped glow of blue. In his left hand,\
    \ he firmly holds a pointed staff upright. It stands taller than him and near\
    \ the top it has a rectangular, almost hammer shaped section with a sitting green\
    \ cat on the side. The man is dressed in pleated brown robes with wide complementary\
    \ stripes, and wears steel shoes. A wide belt carries two buckled pouches on his\
    \ left side, one smaller than the other. He wears a piece of shoulder armor secured\
    \ by by a wide dark red sash with a silver disc attached to protect his joints\
    \ and has a rolled headscarf that is topped by a conic, pointed hat with a green\
    \ ball near the top of the point. He appears to be wearing a shoulder wrap that\
    \ is white with pink flowers underneath his headscarf."
