  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Many congratulations\
  \ to Nick Wasko, who has won Season 9 of RPG Superstar!</p> \n    <p>The path to\
  \ victory for Nick has been long and difficult. Through three months, five rounds,\
  \ and more than a quarter of a million votes, he has continued to employ skill and\
  \ creativity to overcome writing challenges that demanded originality, clarity,\
  \ and strong game design. Along the way he forged armor powered by the <a hef=\"\
  /threads/rzs2stxq\">banshee's wrath</a>, dared to reveal the dangers of an <a href=\"\
  /threads/rzs2swsg\">ice dam</a>, unleashed the fabled horror of the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2sxwc\"\
  >matianak</a>, and offered GMs an opportunity to run players through the trials\
  \ of <a href=\"/threads/rzs2sz69\">Dead Man's End</a>.</p> \n    <p>For the final\
  \ round Nick wrote the adventure proposal <em>Beneath the Storm-Veiled Spires</em>,\
  \ weaving a story of hags, thunderbirds, shipwrecks, and drowned cities, all set\
  \ in the Sodden lands. The voters have spoken, and work will begin soon to turn\
  \ this proposal into a full-fledged Pathfinder Module!</p> \n    <p>I'd also like\
  \ to take this opportunity to thank our voters and community, without whom this\
  \ contest could not exist, as well as all the contestants who put in many hours\
  \ of hard work and anticipation. I'd also like to thank our judges, especially Neil\
  \ Spicer, who undertook the massive task of judging every round, and Adam Daigle\
  \ and Crystal Frasier, who tackled the very difficult job of helping to judge the\
  \ final round. Finally, I hope everyone will join me in thanking Chris Lambertz,\
  \ who provides crucial logistics and technical support for the RPG Superstar competition\
  \ in addition to her extensive and crucial responsibilities at Paizo.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>I hope everyone has enjoyed the competition, and I look forward to starting\
  \ the whole process over again... next year!</p> \n    <p>Owen K.C. Stephens<br>\
