  \ </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Nhalmika Ironsight\
  \ ran through the fresh snow. It wasn’t that much snow—it wouldn’t reach higher\
  \ than mid-shin on a human—but it was higher than Nhalmika’s knees. And there’s\
  \ a big difference, she now knew, between running through snow below your knees\
  \ and running through snow above them. But she nevertheless ran on, hefting her\
  \ scattergun to keep it free of moisture that might foul the firing mechanism. Most\
  \ humans would find the large gun to be far too heavy, but Nhalmika carried it with\
  \ practiced ease. So perhaps there was a fair tradeoff somehow.</p> \n     <p>Yesterday,\
  \ she’d come into the village of Ivlanton to the sound of cheers. The village was\
  \ deep in Irrisen, the land of perpetual winter. Frostbite and privation were as\
  \ omnipresent as the snow. Ivlanton sorely needed blankets, firewood, and medicine.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A caravan master in Lod had sent a cartload of these goods to Ivlanton.\
  \ When it didn’t return, he asked Nhalmika to investigate. At first, the master\
  \ had praised Nhalmika’s son, an upright merchant with whom he’d done business,\
  \ but Nhalmika wouldn’t venture deeper into Irrisen on familial pride alone. The\
  \ master then offered a generous payment, but Nhalmika still refused. She was from\
  \ the far south, and this wintry land was unfamiliar to her. She’d intended to move\
  \ on quickly to warmer Varisia. But when the master talked about the difficulties\
  \ the villagers would face if the goods hadn’t reached them, Nhalmika agreed to\
  \ go. She couldn’t let innocent people suffer just because she didn’t like snow.\
  \ She took the offered coin, too, and spent it on a hand-pulled wagon with still\
  \ more blankets and medicine. If she couldn’t find the missing goods, she didn’\
  t want to reach Ivlanton empty-handed.</p> \n     <p>It turned out she needn’t have\
  \ worried. She found the cart a few miles from Ivlanton, pulled off the road. Anyone\
  \ else might have missed it, but the dead teamster’s baldric buckle gleamed in the\
  \ deep shadows of the snowy hedge, bright as a beacon to Nhalmika’s keen eyes. The\
  \ horses were nowhere to be seen. She saw that bandits had plainly pawed through\
  \ the wagon, but they’d left the blankets and firewood behind. “Disappointed in\
  \ their mundane haul, no doubt,” she muttered. Nhalmika prepared a hasty cairn for\
  \ the unfortunate teamster and doubled up the load in her wagon to bring the lot\
  \ to Ivlanton.</p> \n     <p>The villagers were pleased, to be sure, but the village\
  \ seer, an elderly and kind woman named Gerthanna, told Nhalmika that something\
  \ had been stolen from the wagon after all: a small, magical flask that produced\
  \ an endless stream of fresh water. In a land where water froze solid all year round,\
  \ ready access to fresh water was vital.</p> \n     <p>“I know bandits,” Nhalmika\
  \ said assuredly, “and I know how to put them into the dirt…that is, the snow, I\
  \ suppose,” she finished with faltering confidence. She paused to consider, but\
  \ only for a moment. “I’ll go after them, and I’ll bring back your magic flask.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Nhalmika backtracked to the ransacked cart to look for tracks. Amid\
  \ her own boot prints and the hoofprints of the departed horses, she discovered\
  \ several heavy footprints, each a cross between an animal’s paw and an unshod human\
  \ foot. Snowfall largely concealed the tracks, but Nhalmika was a little disappointed\
  \ in herself to have missed them the first time. Even good eyes get old, she thought.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The tracks led away from the trail and up a nearby hill. That’s where\
  \ she found the remains of the horses, brutally torn to pieces. Clearly, something\
  \ had feasted on great chunks of their meat. “Well, at least a well-fed enemy is\
  \ a sluggish enemy,” Nhalmika mused, following the tracks as the hills led into\
  \ a series of steep canyons. They looked like the box canyons of home: winding,\
  \ dangerous, and the perfect place for an ambush. She readied her scattergun and\
  \ shifted her cloak to access her powder and shot more easily. Then she stopped\
  \ to think.</p> \n     <p>The paw-footed bandits entered this canyon but didn’t\
  \ leave it. That meant they’d either gone to hide inside or they were waiting in\
  \ ambush. Either way, she could get a better look from above. Nhalmika scrambled\
  \ up the canyon wall and made her way around its lip, crouching low</p> \n     <p>Near\
  \ the end of the box canyon, Nhalmika spied an elaborate ice sculpture, resembling\
  \ a cresting wave with spines like icicles jutting every which way. It looked like\
  \ some sort of symbol, but one that twisted away from her scrutiny as if she weren’\
  t welcome to understand it. She recognized it as a fiendish rune—and a powerful\
  \ one at that—wrought entirely from ice. An open metal flask resting atop the sculpture\
  \ spouted a stream of water that quickly froze to slush and then to ice.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Six hulking bandits worked around the ice sculpture, shaping the water\
  \ as it froze to form the enormous rune. At first, Nhalmika thought they were dressed\
  \ in ragged hides, but she soon observed that the patchy hides grew from their skin\
  \ and claws sprouted from their hands and bare feet. They wore nothing other than\
  \ blood-stained rags. The burly animal people were working with a definite purpose,\
  \ and fear struck somewhere deep in Nhalmika’s soul.</p> \n     <p>A low growl behind\
  \ her made Nhalmika gasp in surprise. She’d been so focused on the rune-shaping\
  \ bandits that she’d forgotten her earliest training: “a vanguard must look in all\
  \ directions at once.” She glanced behind her.</p> \n     <p>An enormous bear glared\
  \ at Nhalmika from only a dozen yards away. Yet it wasn’t the bear’s hostile stare\
  \ or aggressive posture that drew her gaze. The bear wore a harness of iron chains\
  \ supporting a massive mirror atop its back. The mirror stood upright, reflecting\
  \ Nhalmika’s puzzled expression as she perched at the canyon’s edge. </p> \n   \
  \  <p>“I am never going to understand Irrisen,” Nhalmika sighed as she swung her\
  \ scattergun around to point at the bear. Before she could scare the bear off, the\
  \ mirror blazed with bright inner light. The light coalesced into a beam of energy\
  \ that lanced out toward Nhalmika. She sidestepped the blast, but the mirror immediately\
  \ started to glow again, as though preparing for another beam. The bear howled in\
  \ anger, and the roar was answered by the bandits in the chasm. Even as distracted\
  \ as they were, they couldn’t have missed the bright beam.</p> \n     <p>“Well,\
  \ you shot first. My turn now.” Nhalmika fired at the bear’s head. Her shot might\
  \ as well have struck stone. The bear hardly flinched, then took two paces, closing\
  \ in on her. Nhalmika’s hands worked automatically as the scattergun recoiled, loading\
  \ another round as she used the gun’s momentum to swing it back around in an arc\
  \ to fire again. The bear ignored the second hit, and its mirror glowed even brighter.\
  \ While her practiced fingers reloaded again, Nhalmika glanced around for options.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“That flashy weapon’s the trouble, my furry friend. I can’t let you\
  \ keep it.” She fired her third round at the mirror, expecting an explosion of glass\
  \ and metal, but the shot rebounded from the mirror’s surface without a scratch.\
  \ The scattergun was growing hot in Nhalmika’s hands, but she smoothly loaded it\
  \ once again.</p> \n     <p>“I guess this is hurting me more than it’s hurting you.\
  \ I don’t have any more time for this.” Nhalmika aimed her scattergun at the snow\
  \ and leapt from the top of the cliff. She pulled the trigger and the recoil propelled\
  \ her even higher. Another energy blast shot across the snow where she’d been only\
  \ a second ago. She had to admit the bear’s aim was good. Especially for a bear.</p>\

  all\"> \n     <br> \n     <p>Nhalmika could see the beast bandits looking up at\
  \ her. She reached the top of her arc and descended into the canyon. Her trajectory\
  \ was taking her down to the wicked ice sculpture, where its prongs and spikes would\
  \ impale her before she ever got close to the howling bandits’ claws. She swung\
  \ her scattergun around as she fell and pulled the trigger.</p> \n     <p>For a\
  \ split second, she wasn’t certain she’d reloaded after launching herself from the\
  \ cliff. But her fingers knew their work and had reloaded in mid-air without any\
  \ conscious direction. The round exploded from the barrel and slammed into the sculpture,\
  \ shattering the frozen rune into a spray of icicles. Nhalmika reached out and snatched\
  \ the flask as she completed her fall.</p> \n     <p>The bandits were bloodied from\
  \ the ice fragments but didn’t seem to notice in their rage. Nhalmika could now\
  \ see their faces up close, and she wished she couldn’t; they were twisted masses\
  \ of animalistic snouts and snaggled teeth beneath hate-filled red eyes. Nhalmika\
  \ hit the snow, rolled, and sprung to her feet. Having survived the fall, she had\
  \ to grudgingly admit that maybe snow was good for something after all.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Seriously outnumbered and worried she’d see that strange energy-mirror bear\
  \ lean over the canyon rim, Nhalmika ran. Her legs pumped furiously, but the snow\
  \ was too deep for her to traverse quickly. Her benevolent thoughts toward snow\
  \ only a few moments ago evaporated quickly and entirely.</p> \n     <p>The bandits—\
  being significantly taller than she was—were having much less trouble. They roared\
  \ and howled as they ran after her, closing in as Nhalmika reached the opening to\
  \ the canyon. The wounds the bandits had suffered from the explosion were already\
  \ almost completely healed. Nhalmika still didn’t know what they were, but right\
  \ now she would have traded them for a whole pack of Mana Waste mutants. Preferably\
  \ slower ones.</p> \n     <p>At the mouth of the canyon, Nhalmika stopped and turned.\
  \ She wasn’t going to escape, and she wasn’t going to survive, but she might take\
  \ a couple of the monstrous bandits down before they overwhelmed her. At least some\
  \ of these brutes would have eaten their last horse! She aimed at the bandit in\
  \ the middle of the pack and fired.</p> \n     <p>Nhalmika’s scattergun emitted\
  \ a strange clunk and a gout of fire from the barrel. In a horrifying second, she’\
  d realized what had happened. She’d reloaded by instinct again, but this time she’\
  d had the small magical flask in her other hand. She hadn’t put a round in the gun;\
  \ she’d loaded the flask in there instead, without realizing it until now.</p> \n\
  \     <p>But now was too late. The flask rocketed from the scattergun’s barrel and\
  \ struck the central bandit in the face. The impact caused a geyser of water to\
  \ drench all the bandits at once. Before Nhalmika could even lower her gun, the\
  \ water became slush, then froze solid. The bandits were trapped.</p> \n     <p>Nhalmika\
  \ took a few cautious steps forward. When she saw the bandits couldn’t burst free\
  \ of their icy prison, she took a few more steps, then quickly scooped up the flask\
  \ from the snow. To her surprise, it was still intact. And it wasn’t even cold!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“You’ve been a lot of trouble,” she said to the flask in a gentle, chiding\
  \ tone. “I’m getting you to Ivlanton, then I’m walking south, and I’m not stopping\
  \ until I can’t see a single snowflake.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
