  \    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 26, 2016</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p>With <em>Pathfinder Adventures</em>' imminent release—Thursday, April\
  \ 28!—it's time we talked about the core strength of both Pathfinder and Obsidian:\
  \ storytelling.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">When Obsidian Entertainment\
  \ and Paizo started talking about <em>Pathfinder Adventures</em>, I was most excited\
  \ about the prospect of bringing the story of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  ><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a> to life. A little background: I started at Obsidian\
  \ in 2007 working on <em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer</em>, and one\
  \ of the first things I did was join a group of coworkers playing <em>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</em>. The story stuck with me. And when I started playing \"Burnt Offerings\"\
  \ in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>,\
  \ it all came flooding back. I loved the way Mike Selinker, Chad Brown, and all\
  \ of the designers at Lone Shark Games used the mechanics of the cards to tell a\
  \ story. Local Heroes stood out to me right away, as did Foul Misgivings later.\
  \ Since story has always been a priority at Obsidian, I knew that we could bring\
  \ the theme and drama of the Adventure Path to the forefront of the digital version.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As mentioned in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhd2\">my first blog</a>,\
  \ one of the first things we did was put all of the location decks on a map. This\
  \ helps gives the game instant context and setting without a word being written.\
  \ As an example, throughout \"Burnt Offerings,\" you were playing in bright and\
  \ sunny Sandpoint, but when you start \"The Skinsaw Murders,\" things look a little\
  \ different...</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog1_360.jpeg\"></a>\n      <br>\
  \ <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgOA24hAe60\" target=\"_blank\">Workin'\
  \ on our night moves</a> (yeah, you just got Bob Segered).</i>\n     </div> \n \
  \    <p>It's Sandpoint's nighttime look! And it's a good one. Since \"The Skinsaw\
  \ Murders\" is a ghost story and a murder mystery, we decided to set the mood.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Where PACG uses text descriptions on the cards to convey the story,\
  \ we use dialogue. Most of these conversations are driven by the iconic heroes that\
  \ you choose to play with. Each of the iconics has a distinct voice, so a party\
  \ of Ezren and Valeros experiences different dialogue than a party of Seoni and\
  \ Amiri.</p> \n     <p>Before setting out to write dialogue for RotR's 11 iconic\
  \ heroes, I worked with Erik Mona and James Jacobs at Paizo (with some helpful insight\
  \ from Chris Avellone and Matt MacLean at Obsidian) to develop a Character Bible.\
  \ I use it as a touchstone each time I write to make sure the characters are always\
  \ true to themselves. Each character has a set of style and story notes to remind\
  \ me how they speak and how they will develop.</p> \n     <p>I'll pull back the\
  \ curtain and show you (most of) Lini's entry:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <h3>Style</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Having an intimate relationship with animals, Lini sees the world from\
  \ an animal's perspective. She has a hard time understanding people and their complicated\
  \ schemes, but she is curious about them. She has tremendous instincts and will\
  \ trust or mistrust NPCs with a high level of accuracy (<b>[REDACTED]</b> will always\
  \ smell wrong and Ameiko will be a fast friend). She does not emote in half-measures.\
  \ She's excitable and fiery, using short declarative sentences for just about every\
  \ occasion. Dank dungeons make her uncomfortable, but she'll never abandon her pack\
  \ or the mission in front of her.</p> \n      <p>She will have a habit of interrupting\
  \ villainous taunts to attack with an \"Aaah-Kii-Yeee!\"</p> \n      <h3>Story Notes</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>She will seem naive at first, not understanding man's cruelty. Her\
  \ curiosity will continue to drive her though. She will grow to see mankind and\
  \ those with powers as complex, yet simple as any other force of nature. In Chapters\
  \ 5 and 6, Lini will have a very specific understanding of what she sees and experiences\
  \ and will always know with certainty what she must to do to flow with or fight\
  \ against anything she is faced with.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>When each\
  \ scenario starts and ends, you'll get dialogue that's reactive to the characters\
  \ you have in your party. Likewise, when you fight the villain for the first time,\
  \ you'll get some banter determined by who's fighting the villain.</p> \n     <p>Let's\
  \ take Crow Bait as an example. Harsk is adventuring solo and having a productive\
  \ discussion with Ameiko about the Sihedron rune when Maester Grump interrupts with\
  \ terrible news.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog2.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>They even ate the dogs!</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Harsk will\
  \ get down to the bottom of it! At various points throughout the game, we'll check\
  \ to see what cards you have and add a little extra flavor. The game does a quick\
  \ check of his deck and notes that he has the beloved Deathbane Light Crossbow +1.\
  \ So he adds:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog3.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Nothing beats the old Deathbane!</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Harsk\
  \ comes upon the Farmhouse location. In most scenarios, it's just a country home.\
  \ In Crow Bait, it's a gruesome scene with a creepy note addressed to Harsk.</p>\

  \ harvest. They are dead because of you, and more shall join them soon.\"</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Soon enough, he finds Rogors Craesby, who discusses his ugly\
  \ intentions:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog5.jpg\"\

  \ all is said and done, Harsk considers what has happened and how it relates to\
  \ the larger plot:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog6.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Harsk thinks in terms of tactics and the hunt.</i>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Where there are opportunities for flavor or exposition, we take them.\
  \ Certain henchmen will talk with you before they fight. Some ally cards in your\
  \ deck provide good opportunities as well.</p> \n     <p>And the haunts in Foul\
  \ Misgivings! Let me tell you about the haunts. Better yet, let me show you!</p>\

  \ art goes to the incomparable Lindsey Laney.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>There are\
  \ eight unique haunts throughout the Foul Misgivings—so many that it's impossible\
  \ to see all of them in one play through the scenario.</p> \n     <p>You can be\
  \ sure that there are a great number of things that I've left out for the sake of\
  \ spoilers and easter egg hunts. I will say that we track a specific action in Burnt\
  \ Offerings that has implications in The Skinsaw Murders. And I can't wait to show\
  \ you what we do with Here Comes the Flood!</p> \n     <p>Nathan Davis<br> <i>Game\
