  \ world with a normal atmosphere and standard gravity, though it can easily be set\
  \ on any world that PCs visit. You can draw a cozy little mud lair for this encounter’\
  s cuddly denizens on any blank battle map, but it fits particularly well in the\
  \ crater-like terrain in the southeastern quadrant of the front side of <a href=\"\

  \     <h3><u>Giggles In The Muck</u></h3> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>The desolate,\
  \ chalk-white terrain of this rocky planet rises in steep inclines all around, forming\
  \ a dead-end ravine pockmarked with deep ruts and craters. The air here is crisp\
  \ and eerily still, though surprisingly breathable to those without environmental\
  \ protections. A muddy pit burbles at the ravine’s southeasternmost end.</p> \n\
  \      </blockquote> \n      <p>The slopes of this ravine rise abruptly 5 feet into\
  \ the air. Similarly, the ravine’s ruts dip about 5 feet below the normal ground\
  \ level. All squares with slopes, ruts, and craters in them are difficult terrain.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The mud pit at the southeastern end of the ravine is about 1 foot deep\
  \ and full of thick, viscous mud that a natural underground spring keeps heated\
  \ to a lukewarm temperature. It’s considered a shallow bog (<i>Starfinder Core Rulebook\
  \ 398</i>), so it counts as difficult terrain and the DCs of Acrobatics checks attempted\
  \ in its squares increase by 2.</p> \n      <p>When a PC moves within 25 feet of\
  \ the mud pit, they hear a strange gurgling noise that sounds like someone is being\
  \ strangled and urgently needs help. The PC can attempt a DC 13 Will saving throw\
  \ to disbelieve this assumption. If they succeed, they realize the gurgling is an\
  \ illusory <i>ghost sound</i>.</p> \n      <p>Regardless, any PC who moves within\
  \ 15 feet of the mud pit can attempt a DC 15 Perception check to hear the soft sounds\
  \ of giggling from a creature lurking in the mud.</p> \n      <p>When a PC discovers\
  \ the illusory nature of the <i>ghost sound</i>, comes within 5 feet of the mud\
  \ pit, or realizes there are creatures in the pit, the pit’s denizens attack (see\
  \ Creatures below).</p> \n      <p><b>Creatures</b>: Crouching in the mud is a hobkins\
  \ gremlin, who thinks they’re very clever to have befriended a small nest of diathas—\
  slug-like creatures whose volatile internal fluids detonate upon contact with the\
  \ open air. The hobkins gremlin hopes to lure in and then drive away anyone who\
  \ stumbles into the area, obsessively stealing any equipment that enemies drop and\
  \ leave behind.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/020720_Hobkins_500.jpeg\"\

  \      <hr> \n      <p><b>During Combat</b> When combat begins, the gremlin stands\
  \ up from the mud pit and hovers an inch above the ground using its minor levitation\
  \ ability, allowing them to ignore difficult terrain. The hobkins then strategically\
  \ flanks the nearest PC with a diatha, cackling the entire time: “Your shiny techies!\
  \ Drops them and you will live!”</p> \n      <p><b>Morale</b> The hobkins thinks\
  \ the diathas’ detonate and explosive charge abilities are hilarious, so if a diatha\
  \ uses either ability, the hobkins can’t help but spend their next move action laughing\
  \ hysterically at the aftermath. If they are reduced to 3 or fewer Hit Points, the\
  \ hobkins calms the diathas and tries to surrender, offering the PCs the gold-stitched\
  \ patches they’ve collected over the past few days (see Treasure below) in exchange\
  \ for their life.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/020720_Diatha_500.jpeg\"\

  \ Combat</b> The diathas instinctively try to flank all PCs who threaten them. Whenever\
  \ a diatha reaches 4 or fewer Hit Points, it uses its explosive charge ability to\
  \ make a bite attack and then detonate.</p> \n      <p><b>Morale</b> The diathas\
  \ are mindless and thus will fight to the death as long as they are threatened (unless\
  \ their hobkins calms them).</p> \n      <p><b>Treasure</b>: If the PCs defeat the\
  \ hobkins and search the mud pit where they were lurking, they can find a small,\
  \ microcord satchel with a successful DC 15 Perception check. Inside the satchel\
  \ are a dozen dirty arm patches that bear the symbol of AbadarCorp and a 6-digit\
  \ number, and are embossed with golden thread. All together, the patches are worth\
  \ 775 credits.</p> \n      <p>If the hobkins gremlin surrendered and gave the PCs\
  \ the patches to spare their life, the gremlin explains how they found the patches\
  \ on a group of fallen merchants in a bunker about 3 miles to the south. The scene\
  \ was picked clean of all other valuables, but this might prompt the PCs to investigate\
  \ and continue their space adventures!</p> \n      <p>If the PCs return these patches\
  \ to the planet’s AbadarCorp outpost, they’ll learn that the patches belong to members\
  \ of a fallen merchant expedition that had been bound for the faraway planet of\
  \ Castrovel. How or why the merchants died is a mystery that the PCs might wish\
  \ to solve.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Amanda\
