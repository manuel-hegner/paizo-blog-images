               <p>Through the distant heat shimmer, the small oasis appeared abandoned, though greenery peeked over its walls. Even if the well were dry, it looked like a place Channa Ti could find respite in. The cooling shade of the limestone structure could perhaps will together enough moisture to fill a canteen or two. As the water druid's camel plodded wearily closer, Channa noticed a pair of sphinx statues standing sentinel on either side of the gate. The male one turned his head toward her and she caught the glint of gold in the sunlight. Not statues, no. Winged leonine humanoids. Wearing jewelry. Their swords were long and polished to a mirror gleam. <i>Proud then,</i> Channa thought, <i>and dangerous</i>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <br> <i>Maftets and sphinxes are all about recharging and resetting your hand, which can be great… sometimes.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The camel grunted in complaint as Channa pulled back gently on the reins. A wiser traveler might avoid this place altogether, but she was curious about the sphinxlike people. Mysterious creatures are rarely hospitable. Approaching slowly was the least she could do. With a flash of swift grace and golden feathered wings, the male guardian leapt from the wall, swooping down and then rising the moment his bare chest kissed the sand. Channa's breath caught in her throat at the stunt. Four heartbeats later, she still had not taken a breath when the leonine man landed in front of her.</p> 
               <p>"State your business here," he boomed with a growl from his deep chest.</p> 
               <p>She stuttered a moment. "Ah, I don't know where I'm going." The maftet scowled at her, raised an eyebrow. "That is," she reassured him, "I'm looking for the Sightless Sphinx." And with that, he took to the air. He landed next to the other guardian at the wall. They spoke. She could not hear what they said, but when the male guard jumped down behind the wall, the female nodded and turned to watch Channa warily.</p> 
               <p>Channa waited, biting her lip, while the sun reached its zenith. The heat of the day bit into her skin, and the camel chomped at the bit, restless. Yet she waited. The guard on the wall had not moved so much as a tail flick the entire time. Her armor was beautiful. Crafted from the brilliant feathers of the steel ibis, it made it seem that her skin glowed with reflections of scattered sunlight. "Drop your weapons," she barked suddenly. Channa froze, confused. Nature was her weapon. Then she remembered the blade the Pharasmins had gifted her was tied to her belt. It was a ceremonial thing: used to sever the connection between mother and child to mark the entrance of a new life into the world, for preparing the dead, and for dispatching the undead. Setting the blade on the sand, Channa watched as the weapon was consumed in a small torrent of dust. The heavy wooden gate creaked open. The male guard appeared in the entrance, gesturing her forward.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-SteelIbisLamellar.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-SteelIbisLamellar_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-FateBlade.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-FateBlade_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-SandstormDust.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-SandstormDust_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>That cost, "shuffle into your location deck," shows up elsewhere in this adventure, in a big way.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Channa tutted the camel forward. With the promise of fresh water, it charged, kicking up clouds of sand in its wake. She stumbled though the dust and felt something rigid and hot beneath her foot. Lightning fast, there was a sickening metallic twang and searing, sharp pain as a blade hit her leg. Blood and toxic ichor soaked through her leg wrappings, darkening the cloth. She felt the pathways of the lifeblood running through her leg, sensed the incursion of poison. It was a simple matter to separate the deadly fluid from her veins, but it took all her concentration to cast the protective spell. The steel scorpion had her trapped, unable to move. Her eyes darted back and forth, desperately seeking someone to help. She found no one. Instead, the sands below a scrub tree shook away from a huge arachnid thing. Black metal legs skittered toward her, drawn by the smell of blood.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-SteelScorpion.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-SteelScorpion_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-ElementalSkin.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-ElementalSkin_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-ElementalArachnid.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-ElementalArachnid_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>What if basically everything was made of fire and steel?</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Panic swelled in her chest and her breath became erratic. A hot gust hit her back and she felt strong hands encircle her thigh. It was the male guard from before. Her heart skipped a beat as the mechanical arachnid reared back. Channa tightened her grip on her staff, holding steady the protective spell around them both. The bilious venom that sprayed from the construct's mouthparts pattered gently like raindrops on their skin. The maftet wrenched the tail of the steel scorpion from her flesh. Her leg numb, she collapsed into his arms as he stretched his powerful wings, launching them both into the air, away from danger.</p> 
               <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>The air inside the tent was cool and musky with the scent of fur. The voice of the silver-haired maftet tribe elder was gentle. But his eyes shined with suspicion and, if Channa was not mistaken, sadness. He would not tell her where the Sightless Sphinx could be found.</p> 
               <p>"Too dangerous," he said with a voice edged in regret. Outside the tent, a roar of alarm pierced the lazy rattle of cicadas. "The janni must be back. Stay here with the children," the elder urged, worry creasing his eyes. Instead, Channa threw her bag over her shoulder and followed the elder out of the tent. Scaling the oasis wall, she could see a small army of earth elementals were moments from reaching the gate. At the head of the horde were two imposing janni, one horned and wreathed in fire, the other flint-sharp with footsteps that cracked the earth beneath her.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Channa Ti raised her hands, ready to bathe the attackers in ice.</p> 
               <p>"As you wish, magic one," the elder's voice growled behind her. "Help defend us, and I may be able to help you find the Sphinx after all."</p>

So grab some coffee, get comfortable, and see what Organized Play has up its sleeve for the "Best Four Days in Gaming!"</p> 
               <p>Several weeks ago, I put out a call for volunteers to fill Department Head and Lead positions at Gen Con 50. It pleases me greatly to introduce this year's team. They and the PFS team will work closely to make Gen Con 50 the smoothest and most awesome event to date!</p>

               </blockquote> 
               <p>What plans we have for this year! <a href="/pfsacg">Adventure Card Guild (ACG)</a> returns with play from all published Seasons, including Season of Plundered Tombs and Season of the Goblin. Back as well is the ever-popular Gen Con Open, bigger and badder than ever. On the <a href="/pathfindersociety">Roleplaying Guild (RPG)</a> side, we're offering a variety of scenarios from the current Year of the Stolen Storm, as well as some retro events from past Seasons. Season 9 takes off as well, though you'll have to wait until PaizoCon to hear the <del>devious</del> <del>diabolical</del> awesome plots concocted by John and the PFS team.</p> 
               <p>Following in the footsteps of last year's interactive, <a href="/products/btpy9mbe?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-800-The-Cosmic-Captive"><em>8-00: The Cosmic Captive</em></a>, Friday night's interactive will include both ACG and RPG components. Saturday evening will have a large event for RPG and Sunday sees the finals of the ACG Gen Con Open! The team has a few surprises up our sleeves, but the time is not yet ripe to share them. Once the schedule is finalized, we will share with our players via blog and Gen Con's event page!</p> 
               <p>Back again is Pathfinder Society Academy (PSA) returns, bigger than ever. This year, we reserved 15 tables for youth-friendly games. The schedule includes lessons—Beginner, Advanced, and Transitions—similar to prior years, as well as full scenarios from the Pathfinder Society catalog. Having a dedicated area for our youth and their families gives us the opportunity to offer positive experiences in a youth-friendly format.</p> 
               <p>At this time, we are still in discussions about what to do with our demo space. Until those are concluded, I don't want to make any announcements. Once we decide, we will reach out to the volunteer pool to fill the slots.</p> 
               <p>The past few years saw the HQ volunteers and the GM volunteers on vastly different schedules. While this helped with some of the logistics and people moving, the HQ slots were long and mixed groups couldn't match up their schedules. This year, we are trying a different approach. HQ schedules are shorter, but start an hour before the slot starts. We've adjusted the session requirements per Tier accordingly and returned the store credit to $10/slot for all volunteers.</p> 
               <p>The biggest change, besides HQ volunteer scheduling, is the addition of Midnight Madness. Well, midnight is a bit of a misnomer, since the slot starts at 2:00 AM. So I'll call it the "overnight" slot. We are keeping it small as we test the waters and see how many people are up and wanting to game. So our games this year run around the clock - (8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, and 8:00 PM to 1:00 AM, 2:00 AM to 7:00 AM), with the exception of Sunday (9:00 AM to 2:00 PM). I also need a few volunteers to help set up Wednesday Morning and teardown Sunday Afternoon. If you are interested in either of these slots, which don't count towards your Tier requirements but do earn store credit and pizza, please indicate your interest in the Notes section of the Volunteer Questionnaire.</p>

               <p>Rewards are very similar to last year. Based on their tier, volunteers receive a variety of perks, including a free 4-Day Gen Con 2017 badge, 1/4 of a room at the Westin in downtown Indianapolis, a hardcover book, paizo.com store credit, and an exclusive tier-based boon (RPG) or reward (ACG). At this time, we are not sure which of the great books we are offering—too many great things coming off the presses. Once that is decided, I will let the volunteers know. Also, volunteers are given shirts every other year, based on the number of days they volunteer.</p>

               <p>We are putting the call out with the intent that we can let all prospective volunteers know their status before the Gen Con housing lottery goes live on February 12th, since housing in downtown Indianapolis is at a premium. As a side note, you need to have a badge to register for the housing. So if you volunteer as a Tier 3-4 volunteer and want housing downtown, you must purchase a GM badge from <a href="https://www.gencon.com" target="_blank">Gen Con</a> and proceed to register for the lottery. When I receive our GM badge allocation, I will add a GM badge to your account and you may request a refund of the badge you purchased. This is the only way to access the housing lottery! For Tier 1-2 volunteers, I will send your housing information when our block is assigned in June.</p> 
               <p>Related to housing is roommate preference. To save my sanity when doing room assignments, volunteers may request either one roommate (to fill a bed) or three (to fill a room). It is imperative that roomies put each other on their questionnaire—so Bob lists Jon and Jon lists Bob and I put them in a room together. If you list someone that doesn't list you back, then I do not guarantee you will wind up in the same room. There is also a choice for "no preference". When assigning rooms, I tend to group like together. There is a Notes section of the questionnaire to supply more information. If there is anything I should take into consideration when placing you in a room, please add it here!</p> 
               <h2>Summary (TL;DR)</h2> 
               <ul>
                <li>Decide to volunteer—choose Tier based on charts above.</li> 
                <li>Ensure you have a Gen Con account (create at <a href="https://www.gencon.com" target="_blank">Gen Con Website</a>)</li> 
                <li>Complete the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/6FoIrPADnHxXQVwz2" target="_blank">Volunteer Questionnaire</a></li> 
                <li>Check your email for a letter confirming your volunteer status.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>If you have any questions, send them via email to <a href="mailto:genconpfsvolunteer@paizo.com">genconpfsvolunteer@paizo.com</a></p> 
               <p>For those looking to volunteer at PaizoCon, I'll be putting that call out in February.</p>

               <p>Constructive feedback is vital to programs like this, in that it allows us to evaluate our offerings and make changes where necessary.

               <blockquote> 
                <h2>Adventure Card Guild Retail Incentive Program</h2> 
                <p><i>This program is designed to encourage players to reward retail locations that are providing space for Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild players. Locations utilizing the program should advertise its presence to their clientele. We realize that each location is unique, and has an overriding right to determine what is best for their business, so participation in this program is not mandatory. In cases where the specifics of the program don't align well with the retail's procedures (for example, if they don't provide receipts, or they run daily tabs), the event coordinator should work with the retailer to best approximate the intent of the policy.</i></p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>Game stores and other retail locations are an important part of the Pathfinder Society community, and it's important to support them so that they continue to provide support for Pathfinder Society play. Under this program, players can redeem receipts in exchange for modest benefits for the entire party.</p> 
                 <p>Redeeming a receipt simply involves showing it to the event coordinator, who marks the receipt to denote that it was used. A player can only use a receipt in this way on the day of the purchase, and only for an event at that venue. The receipt need not include Paizo products—any products the venue sells count as qualifying purchases. Players cannot acquire or redeem receipts during their own turn or during any player's encounter; otherwise, players can acquire and redeem receipts during play only when doing so does not significantly disrupt gameplay.</p> 
                 <p>If the combined value of the receipts redeemed by players at the table exceeds $10, all of the characters at the table receive the ongoing benefit described below, and each character chooses one of the single-use benefits described below. If the combined value exceeds $50, you may use the enhanced version of the applicable benefits instead. (In countries that use currencies other than US Dollars, use approximate equivalents of $10 and $50; don't worry too much about figuring out the exact exchange rate.) The ongoing benefit lasts for up to 5 hours, and each character may use their chosen one-time benefit once in each scenario played during those 5 hours. Characters can only receive these benefits once during any 5-hour block.</p> 
                 <h3>Ongoing Benefit (for all characters)</h3> 
                 <blockquote> 
                  <p><b>Harder to Kill:</b> When you reset your hand, you may treat your hand size as 1 lower.<br> <i>Enhanced Version:</i> When you reset your hand, you may treat your hand size as 2 lower.</p> 
                 </blockquote> 
                 <h3>Single-Use Benefits (each character chooses one)</h3> 
                 <blockquote> 
                  <p><b>Cheaper Boons:</b> Add 1d6 to your check to acquire.<br> <i>Enhanced Version:</i> Add 2d6 to your check to acquire.</p> 
                  <p><b>Recover from Wounds:</b> Recharge a random card from your discard pile.<br> <i>Enhanced Version:</i> Recharge 2 random cards from your discard pile.</p> 
                  <p><b>Bonus Wealth:</b> Draw 1 card.<br> <i>Enhanced Version:</i> Draw 2 cards.</p> 
                 </blockquote> 
                 <p>The benefits gained from this program are in addition to benefits such as the Accessory Perks referred to in the <a href="/products/btpy98no"><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild Guide</em></a> or on Pathfinder Society <a href="/pathfinderSociety/rerolls">Rerolls</a> page on paizo.com.</p> 
                </blockquote> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>The <a href="/products/btpy98no"><em>Adventure Card Guild Guide</em></a> and the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/policies">Policies</a> page have been updated to include this program information.</p> 
               <p>Thanks to Vic, Mike, Keith, and the rest of the Sharks for letting me guest blog and share the news with our Adventure Card Game players. I'm excited about the program and cannot wait to hear stories from the field!</p> 
               <p>May you draw only boons!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">It's been about a week since I returned from my sixth <a href="http://s-c-a-r-a-b.com" target="_blank">SCARAB</a>, a delightful 4-day gaming convention in Columbia, South Carolina that I've been attending since before I started working at Paizo—and it's now one of the biggest <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> events worldwide. Each year it's been a great experience, and this year was no exception. I've definitely returned with some fun stories. I'll fondly remember the high-level group of adventurers who navigated a dungeon almost entirely by repeatedly casting augury, and the high-level group that nearly decided to throw both major NPCs under a bus and declare themselves queens of a small village makes for a thrilling tale. I can't forget the giantslayers who neither understood giant nor could identify a peryton, referring to instead as a "deer-headed marmot-squeezer." Perhaps best of all was getting through an entire scenario without rolling initiative because we decided that throwing a immense rival party on another plane of existence was a much more fun alternative to raiding someone's home. Thank you Del Collins II, Matt Polkowsky, and the SCARAB crew for putting on a great event, and thanks to David Shaw, Amanda Plageman, Brent Gass, Matt Beebe, Leslie Foster, Chris First, and many others for some great games.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">It's been about a week since I returned from my sixth <a href="http://s-c-a-r-a-b.com" target="_blank">SCARAB</a>, a delightful 4-day gaming convention in Columbia, South Carolina that I've been attending since before I started working at Paizo—and it's now one of the biggest <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> events worldwide. Each year it's been a great experience, and this year was no exception. I've definitely returned with some fun stories. I'll fondly remember the high-level group of adventurers who navigated a dungeon almost entirely by repeatedly casting augury, and the high-level group that nearly decided to throw both major NPCs under a bus and declare themselves queens of a small village makes for a thrilling tale. I can't forget the giantslayers who neither understood giant nor could identify a peryton, referring to instead as a "deer-headed marmot-squeezer." Perhaps best of all was getting through an entire scenario without rolling initiative because we decided that throwing a immense rival party on another plane of existence was a much more fun alternative to raiding someone's home. Thank you Del Collins II, Matt Polkowsky, and the SCARAB crew for putting on a great event, and thanks to David Shaw, Amanda Plageman, Brent Gass, Matt Beebe, Leslie Foster, Chris First, and many others for some great games.</p> 
               <p>Speaking of great games, the team has two more fun adventures debuting this week. The first is the conclusion of the 3-part series Tyranny of Winds, which has taken the PCs from the elemental wastelands of eastern Osirion to the stunning djinn capital of Armun Kelisk on the Plane of Air. In <a href="/products/btpy9p8z?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-812-Tyranny-of-Winds-Part-3-Caught-in-the-Eclipse"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-12: Tyranny of Winds, Part 2: Caught in the Eclipse</em></a>, a Tier 3-7 adventure by Jason Evans, the Society has learned of an immensely powerful enemy, and the Pathfinders' one-time foes have become allies of convenience to ensure their mutual survival. If the Society's to stand a chance, it needs to secure one of the few weapons that this new threat fears: the Horn of the Hurricane, which is trapped within the lawless harbor Port Eclipse. Not only is this a hotbed of enemy activity, but the Pathfinders' best contact for how to reach the weapon has disappeared there. Plan for subtlety but brace for a climatic finish with this exciting finale with ties to the Grand Lodge faction!</p> 
               <p>The Pathfinder Society's been busy on other elemental planes, too. Having recently concluded <a href="/products/btpy9p8w?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-809-Forged-in-Flame-Part-1-The-Cindersworn-Pact">a dangerous deal on the Plane of Fire</a>, the Decemvirate now knows of a powerful tool lost within the Kullan Dei mountains (something we first hinted at in <a href="/products/btpy9mbb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-802-Ward-Asunder"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-02: Ward Asunder</em></a>). However, retrieving this doesn't just mean succeeding where a famed local hero could not; it also requires braving the icy mountains that still rumble with roiling magma. Tier 7-11 scenarios like <a href="/products/btpy9qc8?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-813-What-Sleeps-in-Stone"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-13: What Sleeps in Stone</em></a> are so often a great opportunity to present adventures in extreme locations, and there's little more exciting than going into an active volcano. It gets even better when the volcano isn't just capable of swallowing the PCs—it's alive! Larry Wilhelm brings you a thrilling story, but if you want to survive, watch your step!</p>

               <p>So, without further ado, take a look at Cinnabar, a ruthless leader of the infamous Red Mantis assassins. There is a reason they all wear red... She is also an excellent figure for anyone playing a: rogue, ranger, inquisitor, or slayer. She is a rare, medium figure.</p>

               <p>Next we have TWO Red Mantis Assassins with different poses. There is definitely more than one way to look good while dual-wielding swords! You may notice slight differences in armor, helmet, and footwear. That is because the lower is based off of art for the Red Mantis Shivane, who features in the Serpent Skull AP, as opposed to the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>. Both of these awesome miniatures will be medium, uncommons in the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9qab"><em>Pathfinder Battles: Crown of Fangs</em></a> set.</p>

               <p>While Jessica Price was writing <a href="/products/btpy9qib"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Qadira, Jewel of the East</em></a>, we began discussing the importance of one's status through citizenship, family, and social connections—everything from selling a goods without a license, to choosing a spouse, to arranging a meeting, to traveling the roads without paying tolls. That was all well and good for citizens, but we knew that for Qadira to be a fun adventuring location, it needed to be accessible to foreign PCs. If an adventurer isn't born into Qadiran society, how can he access its wonders? Patronage. With the right friend, doors both figurative and literal open for the PCs. After we had nerded out about Roman patronage for a while, Jessica exclaimed what we were both thinking (and I give you the direct quote): GAMIFY SOCIAL CLIMBING. The honor system in <a href="/products/btpy8x64"><em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</em></a> gave us a starting point, but the more we brainstormed how Qadira's social mobility worked, the more we realized we needed something tied less to the client and more to the patron herself. The patronage system was born.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9299-Opener.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9299-Opener_500.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Illustration by Anson Tan</i>
               </div> 
               <p><a href="/products/btpy9qib"><em>Qadira, Jewel of the East</em></a> dedicates four pages to the patronage system, which provides a mechanical framework for a client (either a PC or the entire party) to earn social credit (<b>Clout</b>) with a patron. Each patron has a certain amount of influence (<b>Rank</b>, ranging from 1 to 10), holds power in a certain sphere within the society (<b>Category</b>), feels a certain way toward the client (<b>Disposition</b>), and may know other equally powerful people in other social spheres (<b>Affiliation</b>). As a PC performs tasks in a patron's name, he earns Clout that he can spend on improving the patron's disposition or buying favors. The trick is that relative social status plays a significant role in who talks to whom, so a tourist stands almost no chance of arranging a meeting with the satrap; in game terms, one's starting Clout depends heavily on the patron's rank and the PC's ranks in the patron's favorite skills, and if that calculation results in 0 Clout or less, the prospective client had better supply a really nice gift or suffer being ignored.</p> 
               <p>Patrons are the key to success in Qadira. The right patron can not only provide the PCs with a critical lead on a lucrative adventure site, but she can also help outfit them from her personal stockpiles, secure them access to restricted areas, and then spread word of their deeds. Of course, this is a two-way street; if a PC intends to earn that Clout, he must perform favors for the patron, help her earn prestige by having sponsored a successful hero, and avoid embarrassing her. The patronage system includes a wealth of suggested ways one can earn and lose Clout, including methods unique to different patron categories (e.g. attending a major social event for a social patron or recovering a major relic for a religious patron). Perhaps my favorite little feature is the list of additional patron qualities that modify the patronage system in little ways to fit a patron's positive and negative qualities. If the PC intends to keep climbing the social ladder, though, his patrons can be of further service, granting him a reliable introduction to higher-ranked patrons that had previously ignored him. A sword-swinging warrior can find a home in any campaign, but in Qadira, a PC who plays the system right could secure unfettered access to the empire's wonders, the ear of any celebrity, and a marriage proposal to one of the satrap's cousins—all by knowing who's who and how to befriend them. I like to think that in a Qadiran campaign, playing a social climber could be just as important a party role as that of a healer or trapsmith.</p> 
               <p>What you'll find in this book is designed for Qadira but is easily adaptable for other regions and settings by renaming a few titles or adding a new category. Since I spend most of my time working on the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> campaign, I thought it fitting to include an informal patron stat block for several of the Pathfinder Society's most reliable contacts in Qadira.</p>

                <br> <i>Foiled again.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Like <a href="/blog/v5748dyo5ljd7">traders</a>, scourges are a new type of support (ha!) card in Mummy's Mask. (Importantly, they're not the <i>last</i> new type of support card we'll introduce in this set, but that'll be the subject of another column.) Scourges borrow some of the tech we built for the haunts in Rise of the Runelords and the curses in Skull &amp; Shackles and Wrath of the Righteous.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <br> <i>I hope you didn't just eat breakfast.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>All those cards display themselves by your deck, but they're not the kinds of things you <i>want</i> by your deck. But here's the thing about those: They're henchmen and monsters. They're only going to show up if you do something foolish, like explore your location.</p> 
               <p>Scourges aren't banes at all. They're just penalties for failing to do what the game expects you to do. They're given out like candy in all sorts of splendiferous ways. You can get them for not convincing a head in cage to do your bidding, or not burying an ally when closing a plaza full of ghouls, or getting one of those regular curses we talked about earlier.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-Neferekhu.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-Neferekhu_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-GhoulSquare.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-GhoulSquare_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-CurseOfTeethAndFleas.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-CurseOfTeethAndFleas_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>*You* get a scourge! And *you* get a scourge!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>We like giving them out so much in Mummy's Mask, we had to invent a new action for it: "suffer." When you suffer a specifically named scourge, you display that scourge next to your deck. But if a card just says "suffer a scourge," you'll roll the scourge die specified on the adventure card and see if you're happy with your result on this delightful table.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-ScourgeTable.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-ScourgeTable_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Are you happy with your result? (No, you're not. You'll be stone dead in a moment.)</i>
               </div> 
               <p>About that scourge die: It just gets bigger. The Base Set's Adventure Card tells you the scourge die is 1d4. By adventure 4, we're up to 1d8. And the names you're seeing aren't exactly getting friendlier as the numbers get higher. If you're not looking forward to a card called Curse of Blindness... well, trust me, you're not looking forward to it.</p> 
               <p>Getting a random scourge from the scourge table is so fun, Alahazra can even do it to <i>herself</i> to evade an encounter. Her Recursor role power "You may evade your encounter with a bane; if you do, suffer a scourge" is a <i>real</i> PACG player's power: If you're all about controlling your game, you'll want to check that box and rely on the Recursor's powers to get rid of curses. Go ahead, I dare you.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-AlahazraRecursor.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-AlahazraRecursor_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>"Stop whining. I got this."</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Other than "being Alahazra," there are precious few ways to get rid of scourges. The most common is the spell Remove Curse, but carrying that around means one less Chain Lightning. If you're willing to stock up, here are some boons that might help alleviate that scourge burden.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-RemoveCurse.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-RemoveCurse_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-MaskOfTheForgottenPharaoh.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-MaskOfTheForgottenPharaoh_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6033-ScarabOfMummyDefense.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6033-ScarabOfMummyDefense_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>We hope you like scarabs, because there's more coming.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>There are other ways too. You could close the Hall of Blessed Rebirth, or blow away both heads of a wannabe Cerberus, or examine some sort of arm thing, or explore after Gaunt Cadaver gives you a Curse of Withering. But that's about it. Once you get a scourge, it's yours to keep.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-HallOfBlessedRebirth.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-HallOfBlessedRebirth_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-DeathHound.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-DeathHound_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6033-Theletos.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6033-Theletos_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-GauntCadaver.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-GauntCadaver_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>See, Gaunt Cadaver is his name, not his... wait, is one of the only scourge-banishing cards Basic?</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Scourges will likely change your strategies a lot. Just like <a href="/blog/v5748dyo5lj8f">the Trigger trait</a> make you less interested in examining everything so you don't get killed, scourges make you more interested in examining everything so you don't get killed. Quite the riddle of the Sphinx, that one.</p>

               <p>But this week isn't about conventions. Well, not ones coming up. Instead, I asked our Venture-Officers in Spain to write about their activities for the past year. When I joined the PFS team as OPC, we had two Venture-Captains, one in Barcelona and one in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, and three Venture-Lieutenants throughout the country. The current Venture-Captain of Madrid, Tesifonte Negro Gonzalez, joined shortly after as one of two Venture-Agents. The team in Spain now numbers 4 Venture-Captains (Leon, Barcelona, Madrid, and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria), 12 Venture-Lieutenants, and 7 Venture-Agents. They went from 2 tables a month to a recent event with 20+ tables of the special <a href="/products/btpy9mbe"><em>#8-00 The Cosmic Captive</em></a>. But enough of statistics, time to hear from the Spaniards!</p>

                <h2>Spain Keeps on Rolling—Higher and Higher Numbers</h2> 
                <h3>Madrid</h3> 
                <p>It all started long ago. A steady group of GMs leaded by Miguel Madrid, Eric Barroso, Francisco "Nagash", Miguel "Puck" and Pedro Moreno gathered every four weeks in order to brighten the weekends for our pathfinders.</p> 
                <p>At the beginning, Miguel Madrid organized everything: gathered up the GMs, created a blog that everyone can visit, talked to different retailers in order to have a place to have fun.</p> 
                <p>Many people recognized his hard labor, and decided to join him: first, Eric Barroso, who became his second in command and then Tesi Negro (who recently became Venture Captain). They decided to increase the numbers by visiting retailers and offering initiation games to whoever wanted to come.</p> 
                <p>People flocked to them of all ages, young and not so young, students and workers, people who were more or less familiar with the system or roleplaying games and wanted to explore Golarion for the first time. After seven "initiations", the number of stable players doubled, and so did the number of GMs.</p> 
                <p>We had to seek a bigger place in order to accommodate all the explorers, and we found our "Grand Lodge" in Goblin Trader Madrid Norte, a retailer that so far has treated us like queens and kings.</p> 
                <p>Sometimes, people from smaller lodges (León, Miranda, Bizkaia) come to Madrid and join us, or vice versa, which is a great success, given the distances.</p> 
                <p>We are now planning to create a group in Complutense University, called the 'Rolativity', to spread the words and bring us more new blood. We are still figuring out how we will manage, and if our captain and officers have really gone mad, but one thing is certain: we will keep raising the numbers and having fun, because heterogeneity is one of the things that define Spain!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                <h3>Barcelona</h3> 
                <p>Barcelona has recently held the DAU a huge event that involved plenty of resources and energies from Gustavo Cruz's crew. León sent its VC, Mario Grande (first right, next picture) and also by adding more tables to the event in Barcelona via HANGOUTS. Madrid decided they were no less than those northerners and sent their VC too, Tesi Negro (second right), in a gathering that would have the three captains (Gus is the man in the mid!).</p> 
                <p>All the time and effort were worth it and the DAU were a complete success. The event held the multi-table adventure <em>The Cosmic Captive</em> during Saturday and several other adventures during Sunday. It was a blast.</p> 
                <p>In the upcoming weeks León and Madrid will hold another event, by the end of January.</p>

                </div> 
                <h3>León</h3> 
                <p>León has also experienced a huge rise on numbers: given the fact its population rounds 130k souls, people flock to roll dice and live adventures with Mario and his GM's.</p> 
                <p>(Leon is so busy, VC Mario didn't have time to send me words to include!</p>

Buckle up!</p> 
               <p>I'd like to start with the Grey Maiden Dragon Rider. This piece is based off of the fantastic cover art for the sixth volume of the Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path, <a href="/products/btpy84el"><em>Crown of Fangs</em></a>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>It depicts Sabina Merrin, the military leader of the Grey Maidens, astride the Black Dragon Zarmangarof. We think you'll agree, that whether you are running Curse of the Crimson Throne, or simply putting the fear of the gods in your players, this piece is one you will not want to miss. It is a rare, large miniature in the set.</p> 
               <p>Next, we have the Grey Maiden Guard, a great looking, highly versatile miniature that can be used by both players and GMs alike. I do like a lady in full plate. You may recognize this gorgeous figure from the cover of the Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path Hardcover, which brings this epic adventure up to full Pathfinder deadliness. This figure is a medium sized, common.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Finally, we have the Grey Maiden Archer, for those of you that like shooting stuff while wearing the best armor you can get your hands on. Anyone looking to play a ranged fighter or paladin should strongly consider picking this up. It is also featured in the gorgeous new Curse of the Crimson Throne Hardcover. It will be a medium, uncommon figure.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Although residents of the Inner Sea region often think of Keleshites as a monolithic people, the reality is a lot more complex. The Empire of Kelesh has made efforts to encourage a unified Keleshite identity, but talking about "Keleshites" as if they were a single culture (which residents of Avistan, especially, tend to do) is about as accurate as talking about "Avistani" (which residents of Casmaron, to be fair, also tend to do). Just as the Chelaxians tend to have very different cultural practices from the Ulfen and Varisian customs and history differ greatly from those of the Shoanti, the various cultures that make up the Empire of Kelesh have widely varied practices and histories. The average resident of the major cities of Kelesh is of mixed heritage, but in less urbanized areas, people still practice traditions that date back five millennia or more.</p>

               <p>It's time for another <a href="/products/btpy9qib">Qadira</a> preview!</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">Although residents of the Inner Sea region often think of Keleshites as a monolithic people, the reality is a lot more complex. The Empire of Kelesh has made efforts to encourage a unified Keleshite identity, but talking about "Keleshites" as if they were a single culture (which residents of Avistan, especially, tend to do) is about as accurate as talking about "Avistani" (which residents of Casmaron, to be fair, also tend to do). Just as the Chelaxians tend to have very different cultural practices from the Ulfen and Varisian customs and history differ greatly from those of the Shoanti, the various cultures that make up the Empire of Kelesh have widely varied practices and histories. The average resident of the major cities of Kelesh is of mixed heritage, but in less urbanized areas, people still practice traditions that date back five millennia or more.</p> 
               <p>Qadirans tend to think of themselves as Qadiran first, Keleshite second, and whatever other ethnic identity they may claim third, but those histories still shape their identities and practices.</p> 
               <p>There are six peoples credited with creating the Empire of Kelesh, corresponding to the seven virtues Keleshites believe they exemplify—the seventh is the unified Keleshite identity, though rumor has it that there was once a seventh culture that has been erased from the historical record.</p> 
               <p><b>Althameri</b>: The once-nomadic Althameri tribes founded the Empire, and still form most of its noble class and merchant houses. Althameri still hold to their tribal identities, and many still live in deep desert holds and practice traditional ways, including a unique form of Sarenism. Most of what people outside of Casmaron consider "Keleshite" comes from the Althameri culture; even Keleshites with no Althameri descent often imitate Althameri dress and practices as a sign of prestige. The virtue associated with the Althameri is zeal.</p> 
               <p>Althameri use a first name followed by a matronymic indicated with the prefix al-. For example, Yaqib al-Marah is Yaqib, son of Marah. They may include a tribal identifier when introducing themselves to other Althameri, but most city-dwelling Althameri consider this information private. If needed, they may append their city of residence or birth to the end of their name distinguish themselves from another individual with the same name.</p> 
               <p>Most Keleshites who do not strongly identify with another ethnicity follow this naming convention.</p>

               </div> 
               <p><b>Aishmayar</b>: The Aishmayar were an ancient, settled culture when the Althameri were still nomads eking out bare survival from the harsh deserts. Famed for their pacifism and dedication to the arts, they were the first people conquered by the Althameri. Their lack of written records has caused them to become an enigmatic founding myth in Kelesh. Though only a few noble families can prove Aishmayar descent in contemporary Kelesh, it is common for artists, actors, and socialites to claim it to enhance their status. The virtue associated with the Aishmayar is grace.</p> 
               <p>The Aishmayar generally used a string of names, the first given to them at birth, and another two to four earned throughout their lifetime based on achievements or personality characteristics, such as Nur-Iqar-Shamah. Particularly desperate celebrities sometimes effect an Aishmayar name, but doing so is generally considered gauche in the extreme.</p> 
               <p><b>Khattibi</b>: The Empire of Khattib once occupied a large swath of the territory now controlled by Kelesh, especially the jungles and rich farmland of Casmaron's southern coast. They are famous for feats of physical engineering and their great libraries, but their inability to match their physical infrastructure with similarly robust social systems caused them to overextend and become a tempting target for Keleshite conquest, especially as they controlled the trade routes that brought goods from Vudra and Tian Xia into Casmaron. The vast majority of the citizens of Kelesh are primarily of Khattibi descent. The virtue associated with the Khattibi is inventiveness.</p> 
               <p>Khattibi names originally put an individual's family name first: Sadikci-Darya is Darya of the Sadikci family, though in recent centuries it has become more common to reverse the order, e.g. Darya Sadikci.</p> 
               <p><b>Mideans</b>: The other great empire absorbed by the Keleshites was Midea, which warred with Khattib for most of its existence and claimed many of the port cities of Khardaji Bay. The Midean love of efficiency and organization inspired an unprecedented financial system that includes some of the oldest still-operating banks on Golarion. Mideans are enthusiastic patrons of the arts and the oldest families are devoted to civil service. The virtue associated with the Mideans is elegance.</p> 
               <p>Mideans tend to use personal names followed by a patronymic or family name, such as Mizha ibn Illiar, but as with the Khattibi, they increasingly drop the prefix, e.g. Mizha Illiar.</p> 
               <p><b>Susianam</b>: Known as the People of the Tides, or Susians in Taldane, the Susianam are believed to have begun wandering Casmaron after a disaster destroyed their homeland. The clergy of their moon god go veiled and are accompanied by tattooed bodyguards. Though they are now a rare minority, the Susianam contributed both many of the irrigation systems that allowed Kelesh to bridge the harsh deserts between arable areas of Casmaron and founded its navy. The virtue associated with the Susianam is adaptability.</p> 
               <p>A Susian generally goes only by a first name, though the clergy sometimes bestow epithets upon other members of their faith, which become part of their names.</p> 
               <p><b>Tzorehiyi</b>: Believed to share ancestral roots with the Althameri and Kara peoples, the Tzorehiyi still prefer to live in the steppes and grasslands of Casmaron. Their tribes control security for most of the trade routes and provide most of the agricultural labor that supports Kelesh's major cities. The virtue associated with the Tzorehiyi is honor.</p> 
               <p>The Tzorehiyi tend to use a first name followed by their tribe's name, such as Nerzad Batgui.</p>

              <p class="date">Tuesday, January 11, 2017</p> 
              <p itemprop="description">I'm big on game design rules. For example, you can see me talk about ten (or so) of them in my PAX Dev video lecture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SshUdUEtIw8" target="_blank">Ten Rules About Writing Rules</a>. In this blog, I want to talk about one rule of mine that gets quoted a lot, and its effect on game design in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>.</p> 
              <p>A couple years ago in <a href="/threads/rzs2rjtu?Adventure-Deck-locations-and-box-management#4">a Paizo forum post</a>, I described a rule we use at Lone Shark called "the Afghanistan Principle." Its technical definition is:</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p><i><b>No interconnectivity without availability:</b> For an expandable game, a component from an expansion cannot be required for use in any product other than the one it is in.</i></p> 
              </blockquote> 
              <p>The genesis of this principle came at Wizards of the Coast as I was helping prepare a shipment of games to members of the military stationed in the Persian Gulf. Instead of just throwing everything into the box, we sorted and bundled up several items at a time, labeling each set as a single <i>playable</i> unit. For example, one Magic: The Gathering deck is not very useful. Two Magic decks can be months of entertainment.</p> 
              <p>Now, I don't know what happened after that. Some bureaucrat may have popped the labels and made that work for naught. But I like to think that many of our soldiers wiled away the desert nights with a D&amp;D 3rd Edition <em>Player's Handbook</em>, a <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>, <i>and</i> a <em>Monster Manual</em>.</p> 
              <p>After that, I started thinking about how to enforce that principle on the games I worked on. I imagined a soldier with a copy of an RPG adventure that said, "For details on this important thing, see this other adventure," except that other adventure was three countries away. That was no good. In my head, everything needed for that adventure should be either in that adventure or in the basic game materials required for play. It's not that I succeeded in getting this principle enforced everywhere, or even that it worked everywhere, but I did make people aware of its desirability.</p> 
              <p>A couple years later, the United States invaded Afghanistan, and the principle got a name. A couple years after that, I co-founded Lone Shark, and now I bring this principle into every project I help create.</p> 
              <p>You can see it in action in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. Each Adventure Path has a Base Set, and the components of that box (including its Adventure Deck 1) are the <i>only</i> components that can be required to play any of the other adventures in that path. Here are some of the decisions that the principle mandates:</p> 
              <ul>
               <li>Any card needed in multiple adventures must be in the Base Set box. For example, the Mummy's Mask support card Defensive Stance is used in adventures 4 and 6, so even though it isn't used in adventures B or 1, it's a B card.</li> 
               <li>The corollary to the above is that a card introduced in Adventure Deck 2 or beyond can only be used in the deck it came in. So the Adventure Deck 1 cohorts Irabeth Tirabade and Horgus Gwerm can appear again and again, but the Adventure Deck 2 cohort Queen Galfrey won't turn up in later adventures. (A practical implication of this is that when you add Adventure Deck 3 to your box, you can safely remove the Adventure Deck 2 adventure, scenarios, locations, villains, henchmen, and cohorts from the box if you like. You may find this speeds setup a bit since you only need to look through the ones from B, 1, and the current deck.)</li> 
               <li>The role card for a character needs to be in the same product as the character card. So even though roles aren't used until the end of Adventure 3, when a character appears in the Base Set, his role card is in the Base Set as well.</li> 
               <li>The mythic paths and mythic tokens you need in Wrath of the Righteous Adventure 2 and beyond are in the Wrath Base Set. (Though the new mythic paths introduced in Adventure 5 can be used in Adventure 6, that adventure works just fine without them, so they don't need to be in the Base Set.)</li> 
               <li>The rules for cohorts weren't introduced until Wrath, meaning they're not in the Rise of the Runelords or Skull &amp; Shackles rulebooks. Since the Witch and Summoner class decks use cohorts, and can be used with RotR and S&amp;S, the rules card in those decks tells you to download a free PDF of the latest rulebook. The basic cohort rules will therefore now be included in every new rulebook, even when there are no cohorts in that rulebook's Adventure Path (as is the case in Mummy's Mask).</li> 
               <li>Troops appear in adventures 2 and 6 of Wrath. Since troops are meant to be a surprise in Adventure 2, the new rules for troops that appear on the back of the troop card in Adventure 2 had to be repeated on the back of the troop card in Adventure 6.</li> 
               <li>Since we don't provide a d20 with any set other than Wrath, only cards from that set can use a d20.</li>
              </ul> 
              <p>I'm sure you can imagine more. The rule can be restrictive sometimes. We've often talked about making a Swashbuckler Class Deck, but we can't put new ships in that deck without enforcing the ship rules from Skull &amp; Shackles, and those rules don't work in Mummy's Mask. We would probably not write a power like "You gain the Craft skill equal to your Intelligence skill when on a ship," because that power would be useless in Wrath. (For flavor reasons, we gave the Skull &amp; Shackles promo character Ranzak one power that works only in that set, and only on one of his roles.) Without those things, the hypothetical Swashbuckler deck loses some of its flavor. Until we figure out how to replace that flavor, you probably won't see Jirelle outside of Skull &amp; Shackles.</p> 
              <p>All this said, there is one place where we violate the principle. In <a href="/pfsacg">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a> play, we break this rule because fairness demands that every one of the thousands of PFSACG games is played with the same box of cards (with the mechanically negligible exception that the associated Character Add-On Deck is optional for parties smaller than 5). For example, <a href="/products/btpy9non"><em>Season of the Runelords Adventure 4</em></a> requires the <a href="/products/btpy951a"><em>Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em></a> and Adventure Decks 1 through 4 to play, so it can use locations from Adventure Deck 3. (Plus, this mix creates a better experience for veteran players, since they're seeing combos of cards that they won't see in the box sets.)</p> 
              <p>The Afghanistan Principle doesn't work for every game, but it works for ours. It's got a good reason to exist, and a committed team behind it. Thanks for reading about it, and for supporting our troops.</p> 
              <p>If you have any stories about how the Afghanistan Principle has affected you—even if it has nothing to do with the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game—let us know about it in the discussion thread for this blog!</p>

               <h2>Five Star Promotions</h2> 
               <p>One of the best parts of being OPC involves congratulating GMs when they reach milestones. I love watching players make the transition to the other side of the screen, though it can be daunting at first, and seeing their excitement when they run their 10th game and earn their 1st star. I also enjoy hearing about GMs reaching their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th star achievements. But the emails I receive when a GM qualifies for their 5th are some of my most enjoyable to read. They are filled with anecdotes and examples of the quality of our GMs. They embrace many of the reasons I love working with the organized play program. Friendly, helpful, patient, supportive—all adjectives used to describe our current batch of of recipients. I am extremely pleased to award a 5th star to the following GMs:</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Keith Apperson</li> 
                <li>Matt Lewis</li> 
                <li>Helen Yau</li> 
               </ul> 
               <p>As a note, that makes 123 new 5-star GMs in 2016 and 271 total 5-star GMs. Whoot!</p> 
               <h2>Venture-Officers</h2> 
               <p>Pathfinder Society is bigger than ever. We ended the year with 771 Venture-Officers in 50 US States, 36 countries, and 6 continents. The breakdown was 11 Regional Venture-Coordinators, 155 Venture-Captains, 241 Venture-Lieutenants, and 364 Venture-Agents. To the current Venture-Officers corps, thank you for taking time to coordinate organized play in your area. Your efforts are GREATLY appreciated</p> 
               <p>Despite these numbers, we are not everywhere. So if you are reading this, don't have Pathfinder Society in your area, and think you would like to help organize some PFS activities, send an email to your Regional –Venture Coordinator and let them know your interest. Their emails are found on the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/coordinators">Coordinator's Page</a>.</p> 
               <h2>Lead Applications</h2> 
               <p>Thank you to all who responded to my call for convention lead/sub lead applications a few blogs back. I sent a reply to all those received, so if you submitted it and didn't hear from me, please drop me a line asap and let me know. Our next step is reviewing the applications and setting up interviews with the applicants, the current convention leads, and the Pathfinder Society team. Will have more information soon on our selectees.</p> 
               <h2>Convention Volunteers</h2> 
               <p>Speaking of conventions—we are gearing up for another great year of events. This year, the Pathfinder Society team is soliciting directly for volunteers at Gen Con, PaizoCon, and PAX West. Watch this space fore more information—Gen Con will go out by the end of January, PaizoCon is slotted for Feb/March, and PAX West for March/April.</p> 
               <p>Besides the three above, which I take a direct hand in organizing, there are many other great conventions throughout the world. UK Games Expo, Origins, PaizoCon Oz, PAX East/South, PaizoCon UK, DragonCon, Kublacon, Contingency, TotalCon, Con of the North, OrcCon, MegaCon, Who's Yer Con, DundraCon, Winter War, and U-Con are just a few of our conventions with huge numbers of Pathfinder Society events. We encourage you to volunteer for other conventions in your area. If interested, contact a Venture-Officer local to the convention, who will know who to get in touch with to volunteer.</p> 
               <h2>Regional Support Package Update</h2> 
               <p>Last year, we rolled out an initiative that we originally titled "Game Day" support, but changed to Regional Support Packages (RSP) as the term "Game Day" had different connotations depending on the people involved. The RSPs met with favor, but the program was decidedly clunky and difficult to implement. So we went back to the drawing board. After much brainstorming and feedback from the Regional Venture-Coordinators, we think we have a revised program that is user-friendly and supports Pathfinders in every region. This week, we are taking it to the Venture-Officers as a whole. Provided they don't put major holes in the plan, we will roll it out for Society use in February.</p> 
               <h2>Guide to Roleplaying Guild 8.1</h2> 
               <p>Still working on this one. While overall opinion of the new structure is positive, the drastic change left some necessary pieces on the cutting floor. Add in a few new ideas and you get a bit of a muddle. We are working on revising the wording and replacing the missing pieces, but time is at a premium and other projects, like getting scenarios out the door and keeping convention support flowing, take precedence. I'm hoping to buckle down and get moving on this project. There are lots of great message board threads that outline the biggest issues, so I'm reading those and going forward. Will update everyone when we have progress.</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Society Academy</h2> 
               <p>Last year at Gen Con, we released the third in a series of lessons for new gamers, targeting our younger gamers but useful for anyone new to the game. With it came a new series of quests <i>Angel's Flight</i>, written specifically to accompany the Transitions lessons. Over the past few months, we returned to Beginner and Advanced Lessons and melded them into a harmonious three-part arc. What is still missing is the overarching "How to use" document. It is being written and once we have it, PSA will be ready for launch! Until the program is officially released, component pieces are not sanctioned for PFS play.</p> 
               <h2>Additional Resources</h2> 
               <p>One of the biggest barriers in getting Additional Resources updated is getting the team together to discuss publications and what is right for inclusion in our Organized Play programs. The holidays play havoc with scheduling, but now that things are a bit settled, we hope to have an update soon.</p> 
               <p>I intended to include a spotlight on one of our fastest growing areas, but the blog is already chockablock with information. I think I will save the profile for another day, but will leave you a hint of where I'm talking about. Let's see if you can guess it before next week's blog:</p> 
               <p>This location has average summer temperatures ranging from 14-25 C (57-75 F).</p> 
               <p>Don't forget, John Compton is out at S.C.A.R.A.B this weekend. If your attending, stop by and say hi!</p> 
               <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">A dark wind blows through the Paizo offices (or at least through mine) on this chilly January afternoon, but that wind brings good portents of something very, very evil. Four of our favorite Pathfinder iconic heroes are coming to the world of the <em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em> nightmare horror miniatures game, so I'm taking the opportunity of today's usually minis-filled publisher preview blog to tell you all about it, because honestly, I'm super excited about this project!</p> 
               <p><em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em> is currently in the final day of its record-shattering <a href="http://kck.st/2iO1ZZQ" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>, the largest ever for a game—tabletop or otherwise—in Kickstarter's history. It's a success the game richly deserves. <em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em> is one of the best-looking hobby games I've ever played, and one of the most interesting campaign-style minis game I've ever come across. The current Kickstarter is for a "1.5" update of the original, which many of us at Paizo purchased the first time around a few years ago. Many Paizonians play after-hour <em>Kingdom Death</em> games here at work, and the game's crazy atmospherics and innovative gameplay keep us coming back for more.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-ErikKD.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-ErikKD_360.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <p>For me, the big appeal is the miniatures. Simply put, <em>Kingdom Death</em> has some of the most gorgeous miniatures in my entire personal collection, featuring jaw-dropping designs. They're also produced at a slightly larger scale than, say, <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> figures, which allows for easier painting and greater sculpt detail without being so large that you can't use them with a 5-foot grid or with other 35 mm figures.</p> 
               <p>I've always dreamed of seeing the Pathfinder iconic characters as <em>Kingdom Death</em> figures, and I'm happy to say that, thanks to the newly announced <a href="http://kck.st/2hWleM2" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinders of Death</em> expansion</a>, that dream (nightmare?) is now a reality.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-Merisiel.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-Merisiel_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p><em>Pathfinders of Death</em> will include official <em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em> unpainted figures for Pathfinder iconic characters Merisiel, Valeros, Kyra, and Seoni, as well as rules to play them in the game. Minis collectors not interested in the full game can pledge at the $5.00 level and then add the set as a $60 add-on, but as a player of the game I've got to say that would be a mistake. For the first KD Kickstarter I focused on minis over the game, and later learned how amazing the gameplay is and I had to purchase some of the expansions on the secondary market at inflated prices. Don't overlook the game, is what I'm saying.</p> 
               <p>Above we see the <em>Kingdom Death</em> version of Merisiel, Pathfinder's iconic rogue. Most <em>Kingdom Death</em> characters awaken naked in a shadowy nightmare realm with only a rock as a weapon, but our Pathfinder characters appear fully armed and armored, with new rules for more heroic characters in a world that usually involves very little hope indeed.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-Valeros.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-Valeros_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here's an early look at Valeros, who has picked up some characteristically <em>Kingdom Death</em> magic items on his journey into nightmare. He is one tough customer, and that sword he's got is probably the most metal sword he's ever held before. Wow!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/Blog/20170106-Kyra.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20170106-Kyra_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>We haven't seen Seoni, yet, but Kyra here just arrived in the Paizo offices and sailed through the approval process without a hitch. Those of you familiar with the world of <em>Kingdom Death</em> no doubt know that characters in the game are often fairly naked, with several optional figures falling into a "pin-up" category with, let's call it a different approach than the one you're used to seeing in Pathfinder. We wanted to make sure that our heroes, while absorbing some of the appeal of the KD visual aesthetic, were nonetheless still the Pathfinder heroes you know and love. A pinup version of Kyra, for example, was never on the table.</p> 
               <p>Let me circle back on that point for just a moment. As a note for those not already familiar with the game (and who didn't infer it from everything above), <em>Kingdom Death</em> is the reason the phrase "for mature audiences only" was invented. <em>Kingdom Death</em> explores every form of horror you can imagine—and many you hopefully can't imagine—going to extremes we'd never explore in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. We want to make it clear that this arrangement does not signal some new direction for the Pathfinder RPG or the content you'll find in our products. It does, however, signal the chance for you to get insanely high-quality miniatures of your favorite Pathfinder characters. So, forewarned, make the decisions right for you and your gaming group.</p> 
               <p>For now, these figures are available exclusively through the <a href="http://kck.st/2iO1ZZQ" target="_blank"><em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em> Kickstarter campaign</a>, which ends in less than 24 hours. We may find a way to bring some limited quantity of these figures to folks who miss out on the campaign months and months and months down the road, but if you want to be absolutely certain to get them, I urge you to back the project while you still can. We love these miniatures and the game here at Paizo, and hope that you will enjoy these figures as well.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for this momentous week. There will be NO Publisher Preview for the next two weeks, as I head to Hawaii for a MUCH needed family vacation. When I return I will bring an epic feast of <a href="/products/btpy9qab"><em>Crown of Fangs</em></a> previews for you to enjoy.</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain...</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Very soon, dear readers, copies of <a href="/products/btpy9qib"><em>Qadira: Jewel of the East</em></a> will be in your hands (or available to be in your hands, if you're not a subscriber), so this seems like an excellent time to list off my ten favorite things about Qadira and/or this book. Behold:</p> 
               <p><b>1. The "Adventuring In Qadira" section:</b> These 24 pages of mysteries, perils, ancient secrets, and general weirdness give glimpses of locations like the razor-edged obsidian labyrinth of the Lady of the Burnt Lands; Ihalar, a massive underground city; Ushumgal, a banking center probably run by bronze dragons; the deadly ruins of Qumarin, from which explorers emerge blinded, their faces branded with wheels of wings, eyes, and fire; and the Tower of Winds, set among a sea of colorful grasses haunted by strange beings who ask visitors a single question to which there is no correct answer. There's also a lot more detail about sites we've mentioned before, like the harpy-haunted ruins of Al-Bashir, the military training grounds of Omash, and the twisted gnoll settlement of Shadun.</p> 
               <p><b>2. My favorite piece of art ever:</b> Look at this gloriousness. It's the adventurer equivalent of having your cat sleeping on your keyboard when you need to get work done. The poor lady just wants to figure out where these tracks go, and her lion animal companion is demanding that she play with him NOW.</p>

               </div> 
               <p><b>3. John Compton's patronage system:</b> In Qadira, getting ahead is all about who you know and what they can do for you. John has put together a brilliant system for navigating the currents of Qadiran society, gaining access to the elite, and benefitting from your connections.</p> 
               <p><b>4. Keleshite ethnicities:</b> Did you think "Keleshite" described a single culture or people? If you did, that's understandable—that's what most people from Avistan think, too. But the Padishah Empire of Kelesh is home to many different peoples and cultures, making "Keleshite" more of an umbrella term, like "Avistani" or "Tian," than a specific ethnicity like "Ulfen" or "Shoanti." Learn about the six major cultures that formed the Empire, as well as close to a dozen ethnic minorities common in Qadira. There are also details about how non-humans and different classes fit into Qadiran society, from tieflings pretending to be emberkin aasimars to Paraheen dwarf weaponsmiths, and Taldan brawlers to the pyrokineticists of the Imperial Forces.</p> 
               <p><b>5. This other piece of art, which is also my favorite piece of art ever:</b> It's a CYCLOPS WITH A MIGRAINE. I empathize so much, buddy.</p>

               <p><b>6. Horses!</b> If you like playing mounted characters, especially if you like playing mounted characters who ride horses, you're going to want this book. From new tricks for your horse animal companion, to genie-touched horses with elemental powers, to information on the horse-breeding tribes of Al-Zabrit and their unique cavalier order, this book is packed with goodies for riders.</p> 
               <p><b>7. The clothes:</b> There are so many well-dressed people in these pages. Look at this magnificently attired guy. Even his horse is dapper as hell.</p>

               </div> 
               <p><b>8. Creepy desert fey:</b> I'm not going to spoil it, but it's about time we had one of these.</p> 
               <p><b>9. Sunsinger skalds:</b> I know, you hear "skald" and you think "Viking bard," right? Well, everything's different in the desert, and skalds there channel the powers of fire and sunlight in service of the goddess Sarenrae. Oh, and there's also a solar sorcerer bloodline. Qadira has a lot of people who are ON FIRE: both in the sense of being badass, and also literally on fire.</p> 
               <p><b>10. Kelish:</b> While working out names for places and people in Qadira, I put together a phonology document to ensure consistency (and to help me figure out ways to suggest layers of history with names that didn't follow those conventions). That document turned into a lexicon, and eventually into a reference grammar for the Kelish language. I could geek out about it for 10,000 more words or so, but instead, I'll just note that it drops the copula in the present tense, has a triconsonantal root system (like Arabic, Hebrew, etc.), and lacks grammatical gender (like Turkish).</p> 
               <h2>Bonus: Introduction to Kelish</h2> 
               <p>Kelish started out as a trade language: early Keleshite merchants realized that their tongue, now known as Old Keleshite, was proving an impediment to spreading their influence, due to sounds non-native speakers found difficult and grammatical features they found baffling. So they created a simplified and more regular form of the language, with phonology more similar to that of common tongues outside of Casmaron and with more regular grammar. Old Keleshite is still used in religious ceremonies and among some of the more isolated desert tribes, but these days, almost everyone in Kelesh speaks Kelish as their native tongue.</p> 
               <p>Like many Semitic languages, Kelish is written using an abjad rather than an alphabet (which is to say it's written using only consonants). Many consonants have both a "soft" and a "hard" version (e.g. a single consonant can be pronounced either as b or as v depending on context). The transliterations below are simplified and may not reflect the way the word would be spelled in Kelish script.</p> 
               <p>Kelish pronunciation: Kelish has six vowel sounds, five of which (<i>a, e, i, o, u</i>, which are pronounced similarly to Romance language vowels) have long and short versions. The sixth is found in unstressed syllables and can be either pronounced as a schwa sound or left silent. It has a few consonants that differ from their English pronunciations. The <i>kh</i> sound is pronounced like the <i>ch</i> in the German pronunciation of <i>Bach</i>, or the Scottish <i>loch</i>. The <i>r</i> sound is trilled, as in Spanish or Italian, but also exists in a "softened" version (usually transliterated <i>rh</i> or <i>gh</i>), which is pronounced like the French r. An apostrophe (') indicates a glottal stop.</p> 
               <p>Stress generally falls on the final syllable of the word. Stress on non-final syllables is indicated in the transliterations below with a doubled consonant after the lengthened vowel. (<i>adirah</i> is pronounced ah-dee-RAH, but aninnu is pronounced ah-NEE-nu.)</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <h3>Greetings</h3> 
                <p>Hello<br> <i>adirah</i><br> (ah-dee-RAH)</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <h2>Chapter 1: The Rescue</h2> 
                <p>Daryus Gaunt eyed the two armored figures over the froth-covered rim of his mug, taking in every detail of the pair. Despite his outward disinterest, he remained on edge until the two crusaders took their leave of the tavern.</p> 
                <p>They had not recognized him—but then, he hardly looked like the earnest warrior he had been when he had worn their same uniform. Scars etched his oddly narrow features, many covered unsuccessfully by the thin, black beard edged with gray. Some of the jagged marks had been earned when he had been a crusader, but the rest—along with the beard—he'd gotten acting as a sword for hire for whoever was willing to pay.</p> 
                <p>Daryus could have saved himself so much trouble by simply not making Nerosyan his base. Doing so was like poking the proverbial bees' nest. The Order of the Flaming Lance had a significant presence here. If even one of the crusaders recognized him, he risked losing his head.</p> 
                <p>After all, the order had very little sympathy for traitors.</p> 
                <p>He set down the empty mug, then rose. Next to him, the two surly thugs muttering to one another about some future robbery immediately eased out of his way. Contrary to his name and his grandfather's supposed elven lineage, Daryus Gaunt was a mountain of a man, just a few inches shy of seven feet. It made his hiding in a stronghold of the order an even more questionable choice to that handful aware of his situation.</p> 
                <p>Five ales had done nothing to temper Daryus's mood, but he always stopped after five no matter what a part of him desired. The five drinks represented part of his failing, part of his betrayal. Daryus might have so far escaped punishment, but he couldn't escape his own guilt.</p> 
                <p>The Crimson Hammer Tavern might not have been one of the best-known establishments in Tumbletown—much less the city of Nerosyan itself—but it was a place where those in desperate need of a practiced sword could find such. "Desperate" was the key. Prospective employers had to be willing to wend their way deep northwest into one of the worst parts of the city.</p> 
                <p>Tonight, Daryus noted two potential contracts. One was a squat, robed figure who tried to keep his face covered with a scarf. The former crusader guessed him to be a merchant attempting to smuggle something either into Nerosyan or out of it. At present, the rotund man conversed with a pale, eye-patched swordsman who Daryus knew would do his best to part the fool from his money without fulfilling the contract.</p> 
                <p>The other possible client was a thin young man with long blond hair and furtive eyes who gave Daryus a measured glance before heading toward a grizzled ex-pirate from the River Kingdoms by the name of Divalo. Daryus gave the young man some credit. He had picked one of the more trustworthy swords in the tavern. Despite his background, Divalo would live up to his contract and even make certain that any other swords the young man needed would do the same on pain of death.</p> 
                <p>Seeing no reason to remain, Daryus made for the door. It had been a fortnight since he had returned to the Diamond of the North, as Nerosyan was also known. The name had little to do with any glamorous aspect of the city and more with the base design of the massive fortress initially built here. There was no better fortified city than Nerosyan—a good thing, since it was close enough to the Worldwound to attract the attention of demons.</p> 
                <p>Thinking of the Worldwound, Daryus hesitated just shy of the door. It was not out of any thought of adding a sixth ale to his count, but rather the hope that the rumors he had heard might still prove true. The word was out that some Pathfinders were planning an expedition into the demon-blighted land. What insane reason they had for doing so, the former crusader did not care. All he knew was that Pathfinders paid well. They would need a strong arm out in the Worldwound if they hoped to even survive their first night.</p> 
                <p>Gripping the swinging door carefully, Daryus slowly opened the way. A slight creak accompanied the door's movement. The tavern's owner liked to keep all the doors creaky, the better to know when someone exited or entered. Daryus appreciated that aspect, save now when he wanted to make certain that no one outside might hear him.</p> 
                <p>But the two crusaders were nowhere to be seen, even to his skilled eye. If they had recognized him and arranged a trap, they had done a fine job. Daryus doubted it, though.</p> 
                <p>Some might have wondered at his choices, a renegade at the heart of the crusader city. Even the explanation he gave himself—that they would never expect to find him so close by—was one that Daryus knew he wouldn't have accepted from anyone else.</p> 
                <p>Shrugging off both the obvious contradictions in his decisions and the reasons behind them, Daryus headed deeper into Tumbletown. For all their power, the crusaders did little to clean out the area. It wasn't due solely to the tremendous effort needed, though. The area around the Crimson Tavern and its like allowed the crusaders to have a particular place to find those tools they would not admit they needed at times. Daryus had seen the supposed clients who he knew were actually servants of the various crusader orders. Even the most pious of the orders' higher-ups occasionally needed those they considered scum.</p> 
                <p>Only a few dim oil lamps and torches lit the way through the grimy streets and the filthy buildings lining each side. There had been attempts in the past to better illuminate the area in a pretense of making everyone safer, but those had lasted only long enough for someone to steal the lamps. The lesson remained. Only those who could defend themselves could walk these streets at night.</p> 
                <p>A light some distance to the southwest and high above momentarily caught his attention. While not as large as the city's four main defense towers, Starrise Spire—or, more specifically, the magical beacon floating above it—was a useful landmark when trying to wend through the darkened streets toward where he lived. The only other landmark of any use to Daryus besides the city's towers was the great Cruciform Cathedral, situated dead center in the city. More a fortress than an ordinary cathedral, that massive redoubt housed Queen Galfrey and the rest of Mendev's leadership, those soldiers and bureaucrats charged with organizing all the disparate crusader orders into a solid defense against the Worldwound's demons.</p> 
                <p>As he moved on, Daryus set one gloved hand on the hilt of the longsword dangling at his side. All it would take was one swift motion to ready the blade for battle. He had been forced to draw it three times since arriving in Nerosyan, but not of late. Most of the regulars knew Daryus Gaunt by reputation now and avoided trouble with him.</p> 
                <p><i>Help...</i></p> 
                <p>He came to an abrupt halt. Cocking his head, he listened.</p> 
                <p>Silence reigned.</p> 
                <p>With a grunt, Daryus moved on. Five ales might not be enough to affect his faculties, but exhaustion could. He hadn't slept in three days. As a young warrior, three days awake would have meant little to him, but of late it seemed to Daryus that his strength flagged quicker and quicker. Still, there were few he knew of in Tumbletown with more skill than him, so he wasn't overly worried.</p> 
                <p><i>Help!</i></p> 
                <p>Again, Daryus hesitated. He listened, only hearing a slight wind struggling through the tightly packed buildings and narrow streets.</p> 
                <p><i>Help!</i></p> 
                <p>He frowned. It was almost as if he heard the voice in his <i>head</i>.</p> 
                <p>"Help me! Please!"</p> 
                <p><i>That </i>cry he heard out loud. Moving with a speed and grace his form belied, Daryus drew his sword. He took one step toward where he believed the faint cry had come.</p> 
                <p>The clink of metal against metal made every muscle in his body tense. Daryus considered the possibility of a clever crusader trap, but quickly disposed of the notion. The cry seemed too true, too honest.</p> 
                <p>"Help!"</p> 
                <p>Daryus got a fix on the direction. With swift but stealthy steps, he headed toward the pleading voice. Whether it was male or female, he couldn't say, but it didn't matter. Every instinct in Daryus pushed him to helping the unseen caller. A renegade he might be, but he couldn't fight his basic nature.</p> 
                <p>As he entered a side alley, something just ahead of him moved in the shadows. With his left hand, Daryus brought the sword around, but found only empty air.</p> 
                <p>A second clink warned him just before the point of a narrow sword would have pierced him through the throat. Instead, Daryus managed to bring up his own weapon in time to deflect the attack. The oncoming tip scraped his cheek, adding to collection of scars.</p> 
                <p>Daryus's fist followed his sword, striking his adversary hard in the chest. The shadowy figure grunted as the force of the blow sent him back a step.</p> 
                <p>Despite eyes already attuned to the darkness, Daryus had trouble making out the other swordsman's features. No matter how hard he tried, the face remained indiscernible.</p> 
                <p>The sword did not. Out of the corner of his eye, Daryus spotted the weapon coming at him again. As he shifted his own blade to meet it, he noted another attack coming from the opposite side.</p> 
                <p>There was no time to reach the small dagger he wore in his belt. Daryus thrust his other arm up, willing to take a shallow slice on his cloth-covered arm rather than have his head skewered.</p> 
                <p>Deflecting the first sword, Daryus spun to meet the wielder of the second. He had the satisfaction of feeling his blade cut into the other attacker's arm.</p> 
                <p>Despite the wound, the second figure made no sound. Daryus knew he faced not only seasoned fighters, but determined ones.</p> 
                <p>The cry for aid had ceased, making the mercenary wonder if he had arrived too late. However, he knew the point no longer mattered; he was now committed to the struggle, whatever and whomever it concerned.</p> 
                <p>The first attacker tried to take him again. Daryus's left-handed counterassault kept the shadowy fighter off guard, while at the same time, he kicked at the legs of the second figure. He drove his latter attacker down on one knee, buying time to better deal with the first.</p> 
                <p>"Beware above!" the same voice that had cried for help called.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>Rather than thrust at his foe, Daryus had to instead leap back. Even then, he barely missed being crushed under the weight of yet a third figure.</p> 
                <p>Sword already in play, Daryus lunged at the newcomer. He caught the crouching fighter on the side, but the other managed to roll away before the sword could do more than scrape what Daryus guessed to be a light breastplate.</p> 
                <p>Daryus sensed the movements of the second assailant. Determined to do something to keep the odds from turning further against him, he threw himself against the kneeling figure. As they collided, Daryus twisted his sword around and shoved as hard as he could.</p> 
                <p>Although the blade sank deep into the other's throat, his foe's only response before dying was a grunt. Daryus began to wonder whether they could even speak at all.</p> 
                <p>He hardly had the sword free from the collapsing body before the third of his attackers returned. Despite a hint of illumination from the street beyond, the face continued to be as featureless as those of the original pair. Daryus knew magic when he saw it, and hoped that the obscuring shadows were the extent of their abilities. The trio did not strike him as spellcasters, but rather paid assassins given a trick or two. Still, even one more trick might prove too much for Daryus.</p> 
                <p>Both attackers converged on Daryus. He fended off their initial attacks, at the same time managing to analyze which of the pair was the more dangerous. As for his foes, they seemed satisfied to harass him, almost as if waiting for something <i>else</i> to happen...</p> 
                <p>A clatter arose from his right. Daryus, already suspecting just what the pair had been waiting for, was startled that the <i>fourth</i> figure seeking his death could be so clumsy. The murky form stumbled into Daryus's waiting hand.</p> 
                <p>With all the force he could muster, Daryus threw his latest adversary toward the others. One fighter managed to evade the living missile, but the second wasn't so lucky. The two fell in a heap.</p> 
                <p>"Beware! One more! One more!" came the voice, this time from what seemed somewhere on the ground to the right.</p> 
                <p>Daryus couldn't see anyone there, but he responded to the warning. Drawing his dagger, he brandished the smaller blade at the most likely direction from which any additional enemy would attack.</p> 
                <p>It was all he could do to keep his grip as the sword point thrusting out of the darkness clashed against his dagger. Daryus spun around, forcing the barely visible sword's wielder back while still keeping the foremost of his other adversaries at bay.</p> 
                <p>Lunging toward his latest foe, he slipped past the sword enough to reach the hand gripping it. He drove the dagger as hard as he could into the wrist.</p> 
                <p>This time, Daryus was rewarded by a pained cry. The sword slipped free. Daryus grabbed the wounded limb, then pulled his opponent toward him.</p> 
                <p>So near, he finally caught a glimpse of a face, a peculiarly nondescript face that even Daryus's expert eye could not identify by region. A faint beard covered most of the lower half, but that was perhaps the only detail of any note.</p> 
                <p>A rough hand shoved Daryus back. The face disappeared into the same sort of odd, darker-than-dark inkiness obscuring the faces of the rest.</p> 
                <p>Daryus used the force of the push to enable him to roll to the side. As he turned on his back, he brought up his sword.</p> 
                <p>The point caught the attacker coming up behind him under his armored chest. Before the wounded fighter could stagger back, Daryus shoved the sword deeper.</p> 
                <p>As he did that, a strange change came over his dying enemy. Not only did the inkiness fade, but the attacker's entire body shimmered. A bland face identical to the other fighter's briefly materialized, then itself faded into something else.</p> 
                <p>And suddenly a <i>pitborn</i> stood before Daryus.</p> 
                <div class="blurb360">
                 <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8536-ShieraTristane.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8536-ShieraTristane_360.jpeg"></a>
                 <br> <i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>
                </div> 
                <p>As a crusader, Daryus had come face to face with the demon-tainted creatures before. Generally human in face and form, they bore the curse of some past coupling between a human and one of the foul denizens of the Abyss. Daryus's former order had seen pitborn as little more than demons themselves, though while many were indeed evil, he knew that others could be as pure of heart as the oath-sworn warriors with whom he had served.</p> 
                <p>The last, it appeared, did not apply to the fanged, thick-browed figure collapsing by Daryus. His dying gaze held only rage, a look that faded a moment later as death took him.</p> 
                <p>Daryus scrambled back as both the attacker he had knocked over and wounded and the remaining pair regained their footing. He had been fortunate up until now, but even with two dead and possibly two wounded, the odds were still against him, especially if <i>all </i>of the three were pitborn. The demon-touched often wielded some level of sorcerous power, which explained their ability to mask themselves in the midst of a crusader stronghold.</p> 
                <p>Instead of attacking, though, to Daryus's surprise, the two in front of him retreated. Weapons ready, they vanished into the shadows behind them.</p> 
                <p>Daryus turned to the last, only to find the disguised attacker sprawled in a heap. Suspecting a trap, Daryus approached cautiously. As vicious as the dagger wound had been to the assassin's wrist, it should not have killed him so quickly, if at all.</p> 
                <p>In death, the pitborn's true countenance lay revealed. Small, sharp horns curled up from his forehead. His gaping mouth revealed sharp teeth. However, it was the pitborn's throat that demanded Daryus's attention.</p> 
                <p>Something had ripped it out with animalistic tenacity, something evidently capable of moving swiftly and silently.</p> 
                <p>Not one to question his fortune, Daryus looked around for the caller. He was not surprised to find himself alone. Whoever had been the intended target of these assassins had wisely fled. Unfortunately, that left Daryus alone to deal with the bodies. Bodies were not uncommon in Tumbletown, but three dead pitborn would certainly stir the attention of the city's crusaders. There would be a search of the area, with questions about who in the area would have the skill to kill not one but three.</p> 
                <p>It would not be long before someone led them to Daryus.</p> 
                <p>Daryus knew a spot where he could put the bodies, a place where no one would find them for years, if ever, based on the two skeletons he had discovered there the first time he had stumbled into it. He wiped his sword and dagger off on the body with the ruined throat, then sheathed the weapons and hefted the dead pitborn over his shoulder. He could have carried two at once, but that would have made it harder to draw a weapon should someone come upon him. Besides, a single body he could prop against a wall and pretend in the dark was a drunken comrade.</p> 
                <p>The hiding place in question was a narrow passage between two old, stone buildings farther to the west of his dwelling. Sometime far in the past, the entrance to the passage had been bricked up to make the two structures seem as one. The only way to still reach it was from the roofs above, which was how Daryus had stumbled on it in the first place. He had not expected to have to slide into it, nor had he expected the skeletons with the telltale chips in their ribs indicating death by sword. Now, though, what had been an unfortunate chance discovery was proving to be of use.</p> 
                <p>For most people, the time needed to dispose of one body, let alone three, would have been measured in hours. Daryus managed to remove the first two in such quick order that he surprised himself. Only then did he realize just how well he had eased into his current life. His earlier existence suddenly seemed farther away than ever.</p> 
                <p>Gritting his teeth, Daryus returned for the last. Not once had he seen anyone on the street, but he doubted his luck would hold much longer. With growing impatience, Daryus returned to the scene of the struggle...and found no trace of the last corpse.</p> 
                <p>What he did find was a small and curious-looking animal sitting near where he had last seen the body. The long, sinewy mammal licked one of its forepaws, upon which Daryus noted small bits of dark moisture.</p> 
                <p>The brown-furred creature raised its head to look at him. Daryus had not seen many weasels in this region, but knew what they looked like. This one was average in size and slightly wide in the mouth. There was nothing out of the ordinary about it save that its left eye seemed injured and twisted shut.</p> 
                <p>Without warning, it scampered over to Daryus and started up his leg. Thrusting the dagger in his belt, the former crusader seized the vermin by the scruff of the neck and brought it to eye level.</p> 
                <p>The weasel wrinkled its nose, but otherwise didn't react. It seemed perfectly at ease dangling several feet above the ground as it stared with the one eye at Daryus.</p> 
                <p>A quick survey of the area revealed no sign of either the intended victim or the last body. Daryus knew he had risked himself far too long for what he now felt was no good reason. Indeed, he began to wonder if perhaps he had been set up by someone intending either robbery or vengeance. Perhaps <i>he</i> had been the target all along.</p> 
                <p>Remaining wary, Daryus abandoned the area, taking what precautions he could to keep from being followed. If in fact he had been set up by a rival, or had simply become the object of some thieving gang's attention, he didn't want company joining him at home.</p> 
                <p>Not certain what else to do with the weasel, Daryus set it down and started off. He didn't get far before realizing that the creature was following close.</p> 
                <p>Daryus waved it off, but the weasel continued to follow. Its lack of concern for the dead or missing assassins suggested it hadn't been a pet of theirs. Yet if it had belonged to whoever had cried out—assuming there had actually been someone in the first place—Daryus wondered why the animal's owner had left it behind.</p> 
                <p>Daryus's abode was little more than a shack attached to the back of a warehouse. In the early days of the city, the shack had probably acted as the warehouse guard's quarters. The warehouse had changed hands and functions over the generations, becoming now the front for a merchant of disreputable means. Daryus paid the man's scarecrow of a daughter a month's lodging at a time. He knew that they also saw him as an unpaid guard for their goods, for if something happened to the warehouse, then Daryus would lose his dwelling and the money he had paid out that month.</p> 
                <p>Other than a creaking oak bed with a blanket to act as mattress, the lone room had only two other pieces of furniture. The well-stained table and accompanying bench were where Daryus spent his time when not sleeping. A half-empty bottle of foul-tasting red wine that reminded Daryus of the swill he had once drank in faraway Sauerton sat atop the table, looking inviting despite his familiarity with its sharply acidic taste.</p> 
                <p>Just as he shut the door behind him, the weasel slipped through into the room.</p> 
                <p>"No you don't!" He made a swipe for the sinewy creature, but the weasel twisted out of range. It darted to the bench, leapt atop it, then made its way to the table and the waiting wine bottle.</p> 
                <p>Daryus pursued, only to pull up short as the weasel suddenly turned its one-eyed gaze back at him. The stare was so intense that the renegade crusader almost expected the animal to talk.</p> 
                <p>Which it did.</p> 
                <p>"You save Toy's life!" it piped in the voice Daryus immediately recognized as the one that had called for help. "You save Toy's life, but now we must beware! They will seek to obey their master's will! They will come again with more! We must leave this city!"</p> 
                <p>Daryus reached for his sword. "What are you?"</p> 
                <p>Toy impatiently shook its head, its single open eye never leaving Daryus. "No time to waste on foolish questions! Must act! Must act before he acts!"</p> 
                <p>"Who?"</p> 
                <p>The weasel hissed. It reared, revealing that it was definitely male. "An evil walking on two legs! An evil that will now come looking for both of us, Master... unless Toy and Master stop him first!"</p> 
                <p>And then, without warning, the weasel opened his <i>other</i> eye as well—an eye simultaneously of fire and ice, blood red and bone ivory.</p> 
                <p>A <i>demon's</i> eye.</p>

              <p>There is a tendency to go to a location and then to grind through it until you've closed the location. Don't give in to this! If there are reasons to move, then move. You're not stuck at a location just because you went there. (Unless it's the Shimmerglens, the Cell, or a similar location. Then you might be stuck!)</p> 
              <h2>Move to a Location Based on Your Hand</h2> 
              <p>You might move to another location based on what's in your hand—and specifically based on your desire to rapidly cycle your hand. If Valeros has a handful of weapons or Kyra has a handful of attack spells, then it makes sense for them to move to locations with more monsters to kill, while a character with Thieves' Tools should move somewhere with barriers (or to Junk Beach), while a character with a Crown of Charisma would do well to move somewhere with allies (or to the Prison).</p> 
              <p>In short: If your hand clogs, see if there are locations that would help unclog it.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-JunkBeach.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-JunkBeach_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ThievesTools.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ThievesTools_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Prison.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Prison_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-CrownofCharisma.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-CrownofCharisma_180.jpeg"></a>
               <br> <i>If you can't find the right tool for the job, find the right job for the tool.</i>
              </div> 
              <h2>Move to a Location Based on the Deck's Top Card</h2> 
              <p>Sometimes you might get to see the top card of a deck, thanks to Harsk or Alahazra or courtesy of boons like Augury, Scrying, or even the humble Spyglass. If this reveals a difficult bane or a valuable boon, and a specific character can make quick work of it, send them there to face just that card.</p> 
              <p><i>Corollary #1: Move to help with a check on the top card.</i> You might move just to help someone else with the top card of a deck—either to take one of the checks on a two-check bane, or to provide support against one of the wackier villains like Erylium or Justice Ironbriar (who summon a monster that <i>someone</i> must face) or the Skinsaw Man (who gets tougher if you face him all alone). Or you could be a character like Valeros or Lem who can offer support with character powers.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Erylium.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Erylium_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-TheSkinsawMan.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-TheSkinsawMan_180.jpeg"></a>
               <br> <i>Two swords are better than one.</i>
              </div> 
              <h2>Move to a Location Based on the Deck's Undefeated Banes</h2> 
              <p>Precognition isn't the only way to learn what's in a deck. Sometimes you fight a bane that you just don't have the right cards or attributes to defeat. This calls for an emergency intervention from another party member. Sure, that newcomer will probably have to grind through the deck to find the bane in question again, but it's still worth sending Seoni to burn up the Troll or Lem to disable the traps, lest you have to keep facing those banes again and again.</p> 
              <p><i>Corollary #1: Move to a location to sort the deck if the undefeated banes are undefeatable.</i> Sometimes you'll get really unlucky and face a bane that <i>no one</i> can deal with. This is a problem for smaller parties that don't have every skill represented, but it also is sometimes an issue when a flammable monster shows up and you don't have any fiery spells or weapons. To solve this problem, send a character to the location to sort the deck. The Augury and Scrying spells do this best, though there are also a number of less efficient methods to get cards to the bottom of the deck, or at least reshuffle them.</p>

              <h2>Move to a Location Based on the Number of Cards Left</h2> 
              <p>Abandoning locations leaves decks with fewer cards in them. That's fine when you're bouncing around early on, but later in the game it can become a missed opportunity. If you're at a point in the game where permanently closing a location with just a few cards in it would allow you to temporarily close all of the locations next time you find the villain—or if you think a villain is in one of two decks, or something similar—then it's worth moving to the smaller deck. A deck that has 9 cards gives you an 11% chance of hitting the villain or henchman with each exploration, while a deck with 5 cards ups that chance to 20%!</p> 
              <h2>Move to a Location Based on the Characters That Are There</h2> 
              <p>Irrespective of what's in a deck, you might move to a location because of who else is there.</p> 
              <p>Most obviously, you might need to heal someone. Since the discard/heal cycle is a perfectly viable method to keep your deck moving, healers should always be thinking about where they can go to help other people out. This means that they should move early and often.</p> 
              <p>Alternatively, you might move to give a player a boon. This might be something you just picked up that can serve them better—but this is of limited importance, because you can usually give them the card at the end of the game. But sometimes you might be able to give them a boon that they really need <i>right now</i>. Perhaps they don't have a weapon and you have extras. Perhaps they could use Father Zantus more than you in this scenario. Perhaps they need Thieves' Tools because they'll be exploring a barrier-heavy deck. There's a little bit of reluctance in PACG to give up a card from your deck because it defines your character… but as long as you remember to get it back at the end of the game, all should be well.</p> 
              <p><i>Corollary #1: Beware of moving to a character if the location is ill-fitting.</i> When you move to help out a character, you don't want to waste your turn—you also want to explore the location if you can. This means that you shouldn't go to a location if your character is a terrible fit for it. If you're unable to close the location or if you're going to interact badly with a location's special power, you don't want to go there. So the Mountain Peak (where you can lose a card) or the Cell (where you can get stuck) are often right out. (There's some wiggle room here. If you're bad—but not terrible—at closing a location, and it's still got a lot of cards in its deck, then you might give it a shot: You're unlikely to get to close the location in a single turn, and if you do get the opportunity, maybe you can deal with it.)</p> 
              <h2>Move to a Location Because You Have a Bonus Move</h2> 
              <p>Amiri gets a bonus move at the end of her turn. Items like the Boots of Teleportation, allies like the Celestial Unicorn, and spells like Teleport can duplicate this ability. This should encourage a player to move for even the smallest reasons—to reduce the number of characters at a location, to get away from a start-of-the-turn effect, or to temporarily support another character.</p> 
              <p>If a character or boon can move <i>other</i> characters too, then they should be even more willing to move—not just if it would benefit them or the state of the game board, but also if it would benefit the <i>other</i> character, for any of the reasons described herein.</p> 
              <h2>Move to a Location Because of Where the Villain Is</h2> 
              <p>Of course, another reason to move is to find the villain—or to get away from the villain. More on that next time.</p>
