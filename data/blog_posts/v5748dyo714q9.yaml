  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>“Victory\
  \ is the outcome of a divine equation whose clauses are simple to solve for: which\
  \ side has the greater skill; what side has the greater force(s); who has the advantage\
  \ of position; which side is more disciplined; for whom are the consequences of\
  \ failure greater. To the more favored goes the victory.”</em><br><em>—The Lost\
  \ Sage</em></p>\n      <p>THE RESERVE, NOW</p>\n      <p>By the time the transport’\
  s wake lights up the drop off point, Obozaya’s already disappeared into the trees.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The pilot—a former squad-mate named Sozulak from her cadet days— had clicked\
  \ his tongue against his teeth in amusement but kept his peace when she commissioned\
  \ the flight. She read the smug superiority in the way he tilted his head, and while\
  \ it irked her, expending energy on anything but her mission was a foolish waste.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The angry buzzing of the ship breaking atmo gives way to the deceptively\
  \ gentle hum of semi-sentient flora and megafauna deeper in the jungle, and Obozaya\
  \ can’t help the shiver of anticipation that ripples through her.</p>\n      <p>She\
  \ has 12 hours before Solzulak returns. First order of business for the hunt is\
  \ evening the playing field.</p>\n      <p>She allows herself to be fully armed\
  \ as she digs the hole, deep and even with sides reinforced with thick branches\
  \ she collected around the perimeter of the rendezvous. But when that is done, off\
  \ come the weapons and armor, until she is left in cloth barely thick enough to\
  \ keep the cold from stiffening her joints, and a doshko made for vesk who still\
  \ had their egg-teeth.</p>\n      <p>Next, setting up the endgame.</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ mechanism is as elegant as it is simple, though setting up the tripwire is difficult.\
  \ The chill of the damp twilight air makes her feel sluggish. It galls her a bit,\
  \ but she has to admit to herself that she has become accustomed to temperature-controlled\
  \ environments. This operation, beyond being a tying up of loose ends, is a good\
  \ reminder to work on lapsed training.</p>\n      <p>Finally, the seeds of victory\
  \ are sown, and all there is left is to wait.</p>\n      <br>\n      <p>THE RESERVE,\
  \ THEN</p>\n      <p>A hunter’s moon crawling with bred and imported monsters from\
  \ across the known galaxy, the Reserve was legend to all vesk.</p>\n      <p>Though\
  \ hazing was officially frowned upon, any cadet wanting to come into active service\
  \ with some glory to their name was welcome to face the wilderness for 12 hours.\
  \ Surviving meant well-earned bragging rights, and Obozaya Ymeros’s secret visions\
  \ of being a battle saint were enough to make up for any holes in her armor.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The rules were simple: walk into the jungle and survive until rendezvous,\
  \ with just your doshko and your wits.</p>\n      <p>When Obozaya took her turn,\
  \ it was the wet season.</p>\n      <p>As soon as the transport was clear, Obozaya\
  \ ran into the clearing, shouting as hard as her lungs will allow. The rain was\
  \ coming down hard enough that she worried maybe nothing would hear her call, but\
  \ within less than 20 minutes it was clear her worries were unfounded.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>A whiskered renkroda—female and young but large and vibrating with aggression—\
  leapt from a nearby tree without preamble and nearly knocked Obozaya’s head off.\
  \ Pivoting toward the change in heat above her, the vesk cadet’s foot slipped in\
  \ the mud and the claws meant to kill only gouged, and ripped away a small horn.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Bleeding and surprised, Obozaya was still a lethal warrior. She managed\
  \ to slice the beast across the face with her weapon, opening a wound that swallowed\
  \ one of its eyes.</p>\n      <p>The renkroda was like a demon possessed, and Obozaya\
  \ was nowhere close to being a battle saint. The fighting went on for an hour in\
  \ the rain, felling trees and obliterating rocks in the fury of their clash, and\
  \ Obozaya was forced to do something she had never even considered before: retreat.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The beast was not done with Obozaya though, and stalked her for hours,\
  \ slashing and bleeding her at every turn, until all the vesk could do was use the\
  \ remains of what must have once been a supply drop to barricade herself into a\
  \ cave and wait for pick up.</p>\n      <p>The renkroda paced back and forth in\
  \ front of the barricade, pawing at the debris and huffing aggressively. Obozaya\
  \ was dead sure it would break in, but as the moon set, they locked eyes, and after\
  \ a few tense moments, the beast snorted and loped away.</p>\n      <p>When the\
  \ transport came, though she technically achieved her directive, Obozaya felt that\
  \ she had left whatever honor she brought with her down on the surface of the hunter’\
  s moon.</p>\n      <p>The bitter truth of the Lost Sage’s words echoed in her mind:\
  \ <em>To taste of victory, first you must dine on defeat</em>.</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <p>THE RESERVE, NOW</p>\n      <p>Obozaya makes a fire and breaks out her\
  \ rations. She takes a long, deep breath.</p>\n      <p>Closing her eyes, she reminds\
  \ herself of the soldier’s guiding principle. <em>For a warrior, the composure of\
  \ the spirit and the calm of the mind should never be disturbed by the passions\
  \ of the body</em>.</p>\n      <p>When the food is done, and she has stretched her\
  \ muscles loose, Obozaya stands, cracking her knuckles, and takes up her simple\
  \ doshko.</p>\n      <p>Her voice is exponentially louder now as she bellows into\
  \ the night. Just like the first time she set foot on the Reserve, she does not\
  \ have to wait long until her call is answered.</p>\n      <p>A horrible hissing\
  \ growl is all the warning she gets before a shadow descends from the trees, quick\
  \ as a lightning strike.</p>\n      <br>\n      <p>THE RESERVE, THEN</p>\n     \
  \ <p>While it wasn’t unheard of for a soldier to return for a go at the Reserve,\
  \ it was incredibly rare, and always as a sort of confirmation of purpose to the\
  \ Empire.</p>\n      <p>When Obozaya returned, it was barely more than a week after\
  \ taking her Soldier’s Due, bristling with wounded pride and armed to the teeth\
  \ with the best gear she could afford.</p>\n      <p>Plasma doshko in hand, bandoleers\
  \ of incendiary and frag grenades on her armored chest, magnetar rifle slung across\
  \ her back, she was a vision of righteous vengeance. And if her roar of challenge\
  \ wavered in the middle, it must have been a trick of the wind.</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ renkroda that appeared was huge and bold. It prowled into the clearing and met\
  \ her gaze with one remaining eye.</p>\n      <p>Obozaya grinned and readied her\
  \ weapon; she knew this beast. “Glad to know it’s personal for us both.”</p>\n \
  \     <p>The renkroda lunged and they fought bitterly, splintering trees and chipping\
  \ rocks. This time though, it was the renkroda who ran, having suffered the loss\
  \ of a talon and the tip of its tail.</p>\n      <p>Obozaya was relentless in her\
  \ pursuit, lobbing incendiary grenades to force its path back towards her, shooting\
  \ into its hide with her rifle to try and slow it down. She set the jungle on fire\
  \ with her fury and her weapons, showing no mercy.</p>\n      <p>In the end, the\
  \ renkroda, exhausted and gravely wounded, could do nothing but lie panting on the\
  \ ground. Standing over her prey, Obozaya raised her humming doshko high, catching\
  \ her reflection in the creature’s single, frightened eye.</p>\n      <p>Backlit\
  \ by the fires raging around them, Obozaya looked to herself like a terrible demon\
  \ towering over a helpless lesser being; it stopped her cold. The words of the Lost\
  \ Sage came to her mind then: <em>The honor of an action is directly weighed against\
  \ the cost of that action—with great difficulty comes great honor. No honor can\
  \ be gotten from ill-intentioned action.</em></p>\n      <p>“There is no honor here.”\
  </p>\n      <p>And, shaking her head, Obozaya gently lowered her doshko.</p>\n \

  \ 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>THE RESERVE, NOW</p>\n      <p>Claws\
  \ strike metal, throwing sparks into the air.</p>\n      <p>Teeth close around flesh,\
  \ tearing skin and muscle, just missing shearing bone.</p>\n      <p>Heavy bodies\
  \ thud together with enough force to uproot trees.</p>\n      <p>They lock up for\
  \ what feels like days, titans of war, and when they come together, the sound of\
  \ it is like thunder. Their battle rips through the trees and rolls over hills,\
  \ until they reach the dark heart of the jungle.</p>\n      <p>When they separate,\
  \ Obozaya understands there is something <em>different</em> about the renkroda.\
  \ It has the same scarred face, the same scattering of marks where bullets bit into\
  \ its side, same stunted tail. But there is a nervous frantic energy to the beast\
  \ now. The renkroda puffs up its body, lunging and retreating, as if to drive Obozaya\
  \ back towards the path they had carved through the trees—to drive the vesk <em>away</em>.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The trap Obozaya laid earlier was behind the beast, though, and while\
  \ the soldier was enjoying herself this time around, it was time to bring the game\
  \ to a close.</p>\n      <p>“Sorry, girl.”</p>\n      <p>Straightening to her full\
  \ height, Obozaya lets out an almost joyful, if menacing, laugh. With a high-pitched\
  \ scream, the renkroda skitters backwards. Then it turns and runs away at full speed.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Three, two, one—”</p>\n      <p><em>Thwup!</em></p>\n      <p>The snare\
  \ stops the renkroda so fast it runs in mid-air for a whole second.</p>\n      <p>Stretching\
  \ a kink out of her shoulder, Obozaya approaches the swinging, shrieking animal.\
  \ It sounds furious, hissing and swiping at the vesk as she stands just out of reach.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“You let me get you at the end there, didn’t you? Are you tired of the\
  \ game?”</p>\n      <p>The renkroda pants, glaring with its one eye, but seems to\
  \ calm down as Obozaya walks around it.</p>\n      <p>“Interesting.”</p>\n     \
  \ <p>Obozaya walks back around, and the beast howls again, swiping at her, then\
  \ attempting to lunge and bite through its own feet to escape the snare.</p>\n \
  \     <p>“Huh…”</p>\n      <p>Looking around, Obozaya sees that just to her left\
  \ is a felled tree, as big around as she is tall, with a hollow sizable enough to\
  \ crawl in. She crouches down beside it to peer in, and the renkroda goes berserk.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The soldier has an idea of what she’ll find inside, and she is not surprised\
  \ to see a clutch of half a dozen eggs.</p>\n      <p>Looking back at the bucking\
  \ and screaming renkroda, Obozaya can’t help but chuckle and shake her head.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The nest was well hidden enough that she had missed seeing it when she\
  \ set up the trap. Incredible.</p>\n      <p>Obozaya doesn’t hesitate. With a heavy\
  \ sigh, she walks around to the far side of the trapped beast, avoiding its wild\
  \ claw strikes as she raises her doshko and prepares to strike.</p>\n      <p><em>Bzzzz!</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>Her doshko buzzes as she swings and severs the line stretched taut above\
  \ the renkroda.</p>\n      <p>She backs away as the renkroda lands on her clawed\
  \ feet. The predator glares back at Obozaya and hisses, but she’s no longer attacking.\
  \ She’s limping to her eggs. The two predators acknowledge that this is a ceasefire.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Next time.”</p>\n      <p>When Solzulak picks Obozaya up, he is relentless\
  \ about mocking her lack of trophy.</p>\n      <p>Once again, the words of the Lost\
  \ Sage come to her mind:<em> The songs that are sung of us are what others claim\
  \ to know about us, but the honor we gain when no one watches is what we know of\
  \ ourselves.</em></p>\n      <p>Obozaya says nothing as they shoot up and out among\
  \ the stars. That she knows is enough.</p>\n      <p><em>“There is no smooth nor\
  \ easy path to the peak of the mountain known as Honor.”</em><br><em>—The Lost Sage</em></p>\n\
