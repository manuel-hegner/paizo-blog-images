  artist: "the Shoanti, leaving him with nothing but a burning need for vengeance.\
    \ He abandoned his former life and walked into the Cinderlands, where he became\
    \ a figure of legend—many Shoanti believing that the Cinderlander can't be a living\
    \ man, but rather a spirit of wrath fueled by men slain during these raids into\
    \ the southern lowlands. After years of hunting and killing Shoanti, the Cinderlander\
    \ gradually achieved two cynical epiphanies—first, no matter how many Shoanti\
    \ he killed in his lifetime, there would always be more; and second, that the\
    \ Shoanti were already a doomed culture, gradually being crushed between civilization\
    \ to the south and more brutal orcs to the north. His righteous fury largely exhausted,\
    \ the Cinderlander now rents himself out as a guide for those who seek to cross\
    \ the Cinderlands in safety, facilitating the inland travel of southerners. He\
    \ secretly resents the paradox that over the years he has gradually become far\
    \ more like the Shoanti he hunts than the Chelaxian heritage he thought he was\
    \ defending, yet he knows little else. James Jacobs Pathfinder Editor-in-Chief"
