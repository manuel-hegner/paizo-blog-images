  \ Hellknights!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 7, 2008</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ little over a year ago we started doing this thing called <i>Pathfinder</i>—you\
  \ might have heard of it. Early on, we decided that its first volume would debut\
  \ with a guide speaking directly to players, telling them a bit about the world\
  \ we'd been cooking up. But honestly, at the time, we knew very little about said\
  \ world. As James set to writing the premiere <i>Pathfinder</i> adventure, \"Burnt\
  \ Offerings,\" I was tasked with drumming up that something for players, a project\
  \ that would become the first <i>Pathfinder Player's Guide.</i> Tricky thing, though,\
  \ was that the book needed nouns—names, people, places, things—and we really didn't\
  \ have many of those at the time. So, I made a bunch up.</p> \n    <p>It's more\
  \ than a year later and now we have Golarion. But, what's both really funny—and\
  \ pretty cool—is that now, a bunch of stuff that I just wrote down hoping that it\
  \ wouldn't sound too silly are tags on our world's map and have pages of detail\
  \ in the upcoming Pathfinder Campaign Setting. The elves of the Mordant Spire, the\
  \ gnomes of the shey citadels of Irrere, the god Nethys and Gozreh, cyphermages,\
  \ a year ago if asked what these things were all I could do is shrug. Now, that's\
  \ not so much the case. But above all of these, one name that really seems to have\
  \ intrigued folks was born out of a love of moral ambiguity, fanatical law dogs\
  \ from film and literature, and hardcore armor: Hellknights. And the hardcover <a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ic\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting</a>'s got them. While\
  \ there's still not a new class for these devil-allied, ironclad enforcers (hum,\
  \ could we be waiting for a new rules system so we don't have to invent the wheel\
  \ twice?), there's now more information then ever before on the various orders,\
  \ ranks, goals, and disciplines of these feared enforcers of absolute law. Just\
  \ take a peek:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>The Order of the Scourge:</b>\
  \ With anonymity and no consequences, every man becomes a criminal. The Order of\
  \ the Scourge combats the lawless tendencies within mortal hearts through ever-present\
  \ watchfulness and brutal reminders that no crime goes unpunished. The Order employs\
  \ a vast network of informants, pays bounties for substantiated accusations, and\
  \ publicly metes out grim punishments. Under the perfectionist Lictor Toulon Vidoc,\
  \ the Hellknights frequently travel from Citadel Demain, near Egorian, to patrol\
  \ crime-ridden slums and annihilate criminal organizations. </p> \n     <p><b>Lesser\
  \ Orders:</b> Numerous lesser orders of Hellknights exist, although few are known\
  \ outside the borders of Cheliax. For example, Egorian's Order of the Scar stalks\
  \ murderers and assassins, while the Whisperwood's Order of the Pike hunts down\
  \ monsters that flourish in civilized lands. Although less pervasive, these smaller\
  \ orders are only slightly less feared than their better-known brethren. </p> \n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <p>Expect to see plenty more Hellknight tyranny in the\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ic\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting</a> hardcover debuting\
  \ next month! Also check out the new face of the <i>Pathfinder</i> player's guides\
  \ with volume 1 of the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81x7\">Pathfinder Companion: Second\
  \ Darkness</a>, giving players everything they need to ready themselves for the\
  \ coming peril! And just a warning: keep your nose clean, 'cause even beyond what's\
  \ coming up in the hardcover there's plenty more of the Hellknights' merciless brand\
  \ of justice on the horizon.</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br> <i>Pathfinder</i>\
