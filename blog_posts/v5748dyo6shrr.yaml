  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Lini held her palms out,\
  \ and water encased the skeletons instantly. She winced from the effort of throwing\
  \ the spell so fast. The casting’s sparkling light illuminated the skeletons’ silhouettes\
  \ slowly wading through the wall of water she’d created. It wouldn’t hold for long,\
  \ but it would buy them time.</p> \n     <p>“Droo, let’s—” the words died on her\
  \ lips.</p> \n     <p>Droogami, Lini’s leopard companion, clutched another skeleton\
  \ in his formidable jaws, slamming down it into the newly created mud. Bones crunched\
  \ as Droo wrestled with their enemy. The skeleton must have been just inside Lini’\
  s spell. She drew her sling, then loaded it and let fly in one easy motion. Bone\
  \ dust plumed in the air as her missile hit the undead creature’s skull with a satisfying\
  \ crack. With well-practiced movements, Droo and Lini spread out, flanking their\
  \ enemy, forcing it to divide its attention between them. When its bones finally\
  \ collapsed into a truly dead pile in the mud, Lini sighed in relief.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>A bony hand burst from the wall of water and clasped her throat. Lini desperately\
  \ kicked up water and rocks as she fought to pry the clawed fingers from her neck.\
  \ That’s what she got for letting her attention wander. She looked straight into\
  \ the empty sockets of the undead monster choking her. The skeleton’s arm and head\
  \ poked through the wall of water, and she saw more coming. The world wavered around\
  \ the edges as she twisted as hard as she could. Droo took that opportunity to leap\
  \ forward, breaking the monster’s hold. The leopard roared and crouched on his mud-caked\
  \ haunches, ready to attack the rest.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \

  ><em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em></a></p>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>“\
  No! Droo! Let’s go!” They couldn’t take this many on.</p> \n     <p>Lini had known\
  \ dangerous undead lurked throughout the Gravelands, but she hadn’t realized they\
  \ were so many of them. Instead of attacking, Droogami leapt to her side, and she\
  \ clambered onto the leopard’s spotted back. They took off down the ravine. Her\
  \ watery spell wouldn’t last for much longer, and she meant to be as far away from\
  \ here as possible.</p> \n     <p>Mud and water flew as Droo sprinted down the path.\
  \ Lini took a chance to look over her shoulder. They were gaining a little distance.\
  \ Some of the skeletons were out of the water and shambling toward them, faster\
  \ than Lini would have liked. More skeletons were still pulling themselves out of\
  \ the wall.</p> \n     <p>In front of them, another kind of wall, one made of rock\
  \ and loose dirt loomed. It seemed steep but clambering up it looked to be their\
  \ only way out. Lini lowered herself closer to Droo’s fur and peeked over his head\
  \ as the ravine wall grew closer. Seconds later, Droo’s muscles rippled, and Lini\
  \ steadied herself for the great cat’s leap. They had done this many times, and\
  \ her stomach still dropped to the bottom of her feet every time. Droogami hit the\
  \ ravine wall and dug his ragged claws into the dirt. They started to slide, and\
  \ Droo’s muscles bulged with the effort of keeping them in place. Slowly, the leopard\
  \ scrabbled up, and they ascended the ravine.</p> \n     <p>Behind them, the spell\
  \ creating the water reached the end of its duration, and the liquid wall collapsed,\
  \ knocking most of the skeletons off their feet.</p> \n     <p>Silence greeted the\
  \ pair as they clambered onto the ledge. Lini dismounted Droogami and peered down\
  \ into the ravine. They’d been crossing its bed when the skeletons had begun rising\
  \ from the dirt. The corruption here was much worse than she previously believed.\
  \ She could taste it on her tongue, feel it all the way from her head to her toes.\
  \ Lini had a horrible feeling there were more undead out there, much worse than\
  \ skeletons.</p> \n     <p>Screams echoed around them and both Lini and Droogami\
  \ crouched into ready positions. The cries had come from the other side of the ravine\
  \ where smoke rose over a small holdfast on the horizon. Lini’s heart pounded. Many\
  \ people had abandoned this land after the return of the Whispering Tyrant, but\
  \ some still held on. They’d lived here for as long as they could remember; their\
  \ ancestors knew this place as Lastwall. Lini and Droo had stayed with them to gather\
  \ information before they crossed the ravine. The people had treated them fairly\
  \ and shared what little they had. Lini remembered the hopeful face of the young\
  \ girl who curled up next to Droo and fell asleep listening to tales of adventure.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lini scanned the whole area. There was no way they could make it around\
  \ the ravine in time. She looked back down to the ravine floor. The skeletons had\
  \ fully recovered now and were trudging toward them.</p> \n     <p>“We have to go\
  \ back, Droo,” Lini said.</p> \n     <p>The leopard looked at her and gave a soft\
  \ growl.</p> \n     <p>“I know, but it’s the quickest way, and they need our help.”\
  \ Lini looked into the leopard’s eyes, hoping her companion would feel what she\
  \ felt.</p> \n     <p>Droo chuffed softly after a moment and crouched down with\
  \ a determined look.</p> \n     <p>“I knew you’d understand, old friend,” Lini said.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lini climbed up onto her companion’s back once again. She sat straight\
  \ and squeezed Droogami's ribs with her knees, tightly enough to keep her in place.\
  \ She held her hands up to the sky and they started to glow. Lini took a deep breath\
  \ and narrowed her eyes. She thought of the people to steel her nerves.</p> \n \
  \    <p>“Let’s go.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\
