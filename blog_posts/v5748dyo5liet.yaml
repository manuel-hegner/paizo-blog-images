  ></a>\n      <br><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Emil\
  \ became the source of great scandal when he was born to a pair of affluent merchants\
  \ in the Andoren capital of Almas. Normally a tiefling in Andoran wouldn't raise\
  \ many eyebrows; however, Emil's parents were former nobles who had refused to face\
  \ exile and instead grudgingly capitulated to the growing zeitgeist that gripped\
  \ Andoran during the People's Revolt. Though they had never roused enough ire to\
  \ warrant a visit from the Eagle Knights, the Kovkorins were quite vocal about their\
  \ dissenting opinions on the eradication of the aristocracy, often clashing with\
  \ their nation's lofty, democratic ideals.</p> \n     <p>Emil's parents tried to\
  \ hide the boy's fiendish nature from the public, but the young tiefling's distinctive\
  \ tail—and the smoke that poured out of his differently colored eyes whenever his\
  \ emotions got the better of him—made their attempts futile. Convinced that the\
  \ old money in Andoran took part in seditious practices against the government,\
  \ rabble-rousers pointed at Emil as proof that the former nobility were truly loyal\
  \ to themselves, House Thrune, and even Hell itself. Enemies of Emil's family used\
  \ the boy as a rallying point for those who shared their views about Andoran's overthrown\
  \ class system, and fingered the family for being part of the Seven Houses, a conspiracy\
  \ of one-time nobles who still used their wealth to influence the nation.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In truth, Emil's parents did indeed belong to the Seven Houses, and had\
  \ recently accepted a large sum of money and promises for security from House Thrune\
  \ in exchange for swaying votes in the People's Council in favor of laws that might\
  \ benefit Cheliax and delivering information on Eagle Knight activities. At first,\
  \ these accusations hardly mattered to the furious noble couple, who had faced the\
  \ same opposition before. However, they saw their Hell-spawned son as a political\
  \ liability and locked him away in a cellar beneath their impressive manor house.\
  \ But when the Eagle Knights finally came calling to their estate, Emil's parents\
  \ chose exile over death, and abandoned their 8-year-old son along with their other\
  \ gifts from House Thrune.</p> \n     <p>The estate fell to the government, and\
  \ a few weeks later, the bureaucrat who came to catalog the new assets—an elderly\
  \ minister of trade and commerce from the Demarchy Assembly—discovered Emil in the\
  \ basement, sitting in a cloud of smoke and tears. Whether in an act of egalitarian\
  \ charity or wily foresight, the minister adopted Emil as his ward, taking the boy\
  \ back to his home.</p> \n     <p>For the first time in his life, Emil freely walked\
  \ the streets of his home city, though he soon learned that his noble heritage attracted\
  \ as much negative attention as his fiendish one. He quickly became deft with disguises—\
  much more so than his parents had been. He found that he enjoyed the feeling of\
  \ power that came with anonymity and a changeable identity in these undercover excursions,\
  \ though he struggled to find an identity that fit him. Under various guises he\
  \ fought in brawls down in Portside, spied on the logging operations in Timberfell,\
  \ and snuck in to performances in the Theater District.</p> \n     <p>He also had\
  \ a taste of his parents' former high-class lifestyle, thanks to his mentor. The\
  \ old man groomed the lad for a landscape of political intrigue, paying for a swordfighting\
  \ trainer and bringing Emil along to dinners, balls, and other high-society functions\
  \ in Almas. Emil never wore a disguise at these events, at his mentor's request;\
  \ the crafty politician liked how the tiefling's eerie eyes unsettled his political\
  \ opponents.</p> \n     <p>Emil delighted in this as well, and soon began finding\
  \ other ways to subtly advance his mentor's agendas—in secret, of course. A rival\
  \ politician might lose an important document, for example, or an uncooperative\
  \ union organizer might get in a fight with a stranger on the street and end up\
  \ with a broken jaw. Emil never cared much about the actual politics involved, but\
  \ thrilled to see his power displayed in his targets' suffering. With each misdeed,\
  \ Emil's schemes grew increasingly cruel, vindictive, and enjoyable.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>All this came to a head one day when Emil returned home to find his mentor\
  \ fretting about international trade negotiations. A Drumish diplomat apparently\
  \ had some incriminating evidence against Emil's patron, and threatened to expose\
  \ everything unless Druma received extraordinarily generous terms. With sudden inspiration,\
  \ Emil excused himself calmly and walked down the hall to his chamber, his eyes\
  \ wafting trails of smoke in barely contained excitement.</p> \n     <p>Later that\
  \ night, a half-elven Eagle Knight approached the Drumish embassy—which had once\
  \ been the mansion of Emil's parents—with an urgent message for the diplomat to\
  \ be delivered to his hands only. The earnest young Eagle Knight was granted an\
  \ audience, and as soon as he and the diplomat were alone in the mirror-trimmed\
  \ parlor, the disguised Emil pounced, driving a dagger up through the man's jaw.\
  \ As the would-be blackmailer bled out in the tiefling's arms, Emil caught his reflection\
  \ in one of the large silver mirrors on the wall. Smoke coursed from his eyes—one\
  \ black, one red—and the warm blood flecking his skin made his sharp-toothed grin\
  \ all the wider.</p> \n     <p>As he dropped the lifeless body to the ground, he\
  \ realized he'd been searching for this identity all along, the mask he would wear\
  \ forevermore: he would be the face of death in Almas.</p> \n     <p>Since that\
  \ night, Emil has claimed dozens of unsuspecting lives—sometimes for gold, sometimes\
  \ for fun. He has never lost the thrill of walking in public disguised, knowing\
  \ he possesses the power to end the life of any person he meets on the street unnoticed.\
  \ Nor has he forgotten the exhilaration of watching a victim die, not even when\
  \ he took a bag of gold from a Lumber Consortium officer to end the life of his\
  \ adopted father.</p> \n     <p>Emil doesn't frequent state events anymore unless\
  \ he is working, but he is intimately familiar with the already-rotting underbelly\
  \ of the ruling class in the young nation of Andoran, and takes contracts from government\
  \ officials as often as from those with more private interests. Each time he kills,\
  \ he lingers to watch death take hold of his new victim before vanishing back into\
  \ the night, leaving nothing more than a few wisps of smoke.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
