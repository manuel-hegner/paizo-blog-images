  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Mother Bears</h1> \n   <p>by Wendy N. Wagner</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Ill Tide</h2> \n   <p>\"Where's my son?\" Jendara's voice\
  \ rumbled like a great beast's growl. Vorrin gripped her elbow, hard. </p> \n  \
  \ <p>The boys stared back at her for a second, then bolted. </p> \n   <p>\"Come\
  \ back!\" Jendara yanked her arm, but Vorrin kept his grip. </p> \n   <p>\"They\
  \ won't talk to you,\" he snapped. \"Hell, you scare <i>me</i>.\"</p> \n   <p>Yul\
  \ chuckled. \"You're right, mainlander. The boys will run home to hide. We'll go\
  \ door to door. I know their fathers.\"</p> \n   <p>But as he led them deeper into\
  \ the village, a hunting horn blew a long blast, then two short. Yul stiffened.\
  \ \"That's the call to town meeting. The emergency signal.\"</p> \n   <p>\"We'll\
  \ come,\" Vorrin said, and tightened his grip on Jendara's arm. She could feel her\
  \ heart pick up its beat. An emergency, and Kran missing...</p> \n   <p>The narrow\
  \ walkways filled with people, all chattering in high, tense tones. Everyone hurried\
  \ toward the peak-roofed structure at the center of the village, the only building\
  \ unclad by turf, and painted in dizzying shades of reds and blues. The church and\
  \ meeting house. Jendara's family had practiced no faith, but town business was\
  \ serious religion for anyone in a small town. She'd spent plenty of time in her\
  \ own village's meeting hall. Just looking at it made her feel smaller and younger.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But her shoulders stiffened as she stepped inside. An elder in a wise\
  \ woman's black kirtle and chemise stood beside a bandaged man, who alone sat on\
  \ a wooden bench. The right side of his beard was blackened, in some places singed\
  \ to the skin. The woman offered him a mug, and he sipped at it with a grimace.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Yul leaned to whisper at Jendara and her friends: \"That's Birn, the chief's\
  \ son from our neighbormost island. Their best fighter.\"</p> \n   <p>The cold prickling\
  \ on Jendara's neck intensified. Instinct told her that whatever trouble had beset\
  \ Birn somehow touched her son.</p> \n   <p>Another man stepped onto a podium. His\
  \ red cloak proclaimed him a leader of some kind, and his craggy face bore more\
  \ than a passing resemblance to Yul's. \"Grave news, my friends. A goblin raiding\
  \ party attacked our neighbors. Birn here rowed an hour to bring half a dozen wounded\
  \ children to be treated by our wise woman.\"</p> \n   <p>Birn looked up, unflinching\
  \ as the woman in question tightened a bandage around his right hand. \"Most of\
  \ our warriors are away, on a trading expedition. Our women and older children even\
  \ now fight the fires the creatures have set. Our own wise woman was ripped apart\
  \ by their dogs.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara shook her head. This was bad news. With the\
  \ benefit of surprise, a crew of goblins could wreck an entire village. Those people\
  \ needed help. But she didn't have time to go on a rescue mission. She had a son\
  \ to find. She began to turn away from the speakers, but paused as her eye caught\
  \ movement at the front of the room. A towheaded boy hurried toward the man in the\
  \ red cloak. She would have recognized him anywhere.</p> \n   <p>She tugged Yul's\
  \ fur vest. \"That's the one who stole my boy's tassel.\"</p> \n   <p>He frowned.\
  \ \"My nephew, Oric. We'll have to wait for the meeting to finish before we approach\
  \ my brother.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara shifted on impatient feet, listening as the\
  \ warriors around her suggested and discarded course after course of action. Several\
  \ of the women spoke quietly to the wise woman and then hurried off to their duties:\
  \ preparing the warriors' fighting gear, gathering medicine, darting over to the\
  \ wise woman's cottage to tend the injured children. Even if this was her home village,\
  \ Jendara knew she wouldn't be joining them. She had taken on a warrior's life when\
  \ she joined the pirate crew, closing the door on such domestic fellowship.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Yul caught her attention and they pushed forward through the crowd. His\
  \ brother had neatly divided the group into parties, and now he clasped wrists with\
  \ each of the men he'd commanded to lead. For a moment, Jendara pitied the goblins.\
  \ These men knew battle, with their seamed faces and silvered scars. Most islanders\
  \ practiced trade as the seasons turned, but in a land of quick tempers and fierce\
  \ pride, everyone brought their shields and belt axes to the trading table. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Yul.\" The leader clapped his brother on the shoulder. \"I thought you'd\
  \ stay with your wife. Her belly is fit to burst.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Ayuh, her time\
  \ is near.\" Yul leaned closer to his brother's ear. \"I didn't come to volunteer,\
  \ Morul. I came to ask you about your boy. I fear he brought harm to a visitor,\
  \ the son of my new friend Jendara.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> \"Islanders give little credit to a mainlander like\
  \ Vorrin.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>The light-haired boy crept back into the shadows\
  \ behind his father. Jendara narrowed her eyes at him.</p> \n   <p>Morul grunted.\
  \ \"There's a boatload of injured here to tend, and a second to follow. There are\
  \ goblins on Black Bay Island and no idea how they got there. I've got a war party\
  \ to lead and defenses ready. I've no time to talk about <i>children</i>.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"I'll help with your goblins if you help with my boy,\" Jendara interjected.\
  \ \"Just need a word with your son, that's all. Get my boy back safe.\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>Morul looked Jendara from head to toe. He could be Yul's twin, he looked so\
  \ much like the craggy farmer, and a sharp intelligence flared behind his blue eyes.\
  \ The islanders followed him not just for his brawn, but his brain. \"Why are you\
  \ so worried about your boy, woman?\"</p> \n   <p>She set her jaw. \"He's a mute.\
  \ Plenty of folks reckon that's reason enough to give him trouble.\"</p> \n   <p>Morul\
  \ nodded. \"Ayuh, that's reason to worry.\" He glanced at her belt axe. \"You any\
  \ good with that thing?\"</p> \n   <p>Vorrin spoke first. \"I served beside her\
  \ in many battles. She's faster and meaner than any man I've ever sailed with.\"\
  \ Beside him, Tam nodded.</p> \n   <p>The leader of the islanders looked unimpressed.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Jendara tried not to shift impatiently. Her father would have never taken\
  \ Vorrin's word, either. \"My father led the men of his island in twenty-five battles\
  \ and never lost a one. He trained me like I was his son, and kept me at his right\
  \ hand for six trading parlays.\"</p> \n   <p>\"And his name?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Erik\
  \ Eriksson the White.\"</p> \n   <p>Both Yul and Morul looked pleased. It was not\
  \ a great or famous name, but well traveled. Like her abilities with axe and sword,\
  \ trade was in Jendara's blood naturally. Everyone knew Erik Eriksson the White.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"A fine man and long missed. I will accept your offer of help against\
  \ the goblins.\" Morul turned to the boy. \"Oric is a boy for pranks. Come here,\
  \ lad.\"</p> \n   <p>The tow-headed boy slunk toward them, his hands twisted behind\
  \ his back. </p> \n   <p>\"Show me the tassel,\" Jendara snapped. Kran would have\
  \ been familiar with the steely tone.</p> \n   <p>Oric put out his hand, the yellow\
  \ tassel sitting on his palm. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered.</p> \n   <p>Morul cuffed\
  \ the side of the boy's head. \"An islander speaks with pride even if he fears his\
  \ punishment.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'm sorry!\" Oric barked, stiffening his spine.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Jendara took the tassel. \"Do you know where the mute boy—my son—went?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Oric nodded. He cleared his throat. \"Some visitor men on the pier\
  \ told us you were a pirate. So we told Kran he ought to visit the pirate caves\
  \ at the end of the island. That's all.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara glanced at the tassel\
  \ and raised an eyebrow.</p> \n   <p>\"Okay, we took his hat and we messed around\
  \ with it. And we told him he was nothing but a chicken liver if he didn't go down\
  \ to the caves and come back with gold to prove he'd been there. But that's it!\
  \ He even took his hat back.\" He looked up at her, then added in a mumble, \"He\
  \ gave my cousin a black eye.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara felt a moment's pride for her\
  \ boy, quickly overrun by anxiety. \"Caves?\"</p> \n   <p>Morul's lips thinned.\
  \ \"I doubt he went too far in, but it's an extensive network. Oric, take the visitors\
  \ to our home. Get lights and rope.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara nodded. \"We'll join you\
  \ as soon as we can. Thank you for your help.\"</p> \n   <p>She followed Oric out\
  \ of the meetinghouse, the others following behind. Yul tapped her shoulder, his\
  \ face troubled.</p> \n   <p>\"I must go home to my wife now, but I wish you luck\
  \ in your mission.\"</p> \n   <p>She thanked him for his help, and clapped him on\
  \ the arm before hurrying after the others. Oric moved swiftly, gathering supplies\
  \ from the family storehouse and then leading the rescue party down the beach. The\
  \ sun's rays cast long, pale fingers of light across the sea, their touch failing\
  \ to ease the chill in Jendara's heart. Goblins to fight, her son exploring in the\
  \ darkness—it all felt like bad omens. </p> \n   <p>They rounded the headland of\
  \ the beach, and she could see the caves cut into the cliffs at its end. There were\
  \ multiple openings at different points in the rock face, and for the first time,\
  \ her own fear touched her, freezing her tongue to the roof of her mouth. She was\
  \ a child of open farmland and open sea. She had never been in a cave before.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Kran!\"</p> \n   <p>Tam shook his head. \"Spare your voice, lady. The\
  \ way the waves echo in there, ain't no point shouting.\" He turned to Vorrin. \"\
  You mind if I lead? I grew up playing in caves like these.\"</p> \n   <p>Vorrin\
  \ happily agreed. </p> \n   <p>Tam stopped a moment to light the lanterns Oric had\
  \ brought for them. He smiled at the boy, who looked anxious. \"Why don't you be\
  \ our lookout, lad? If we need help, we'll shout for you, and you can run back to\
  \ the village.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I can do that, sir.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Great. Then let's\
  \ go into the first cave. It looks like it's right at the water line and the easiest\
  \ to get into.\" </p> \n   <p>Jendara eyeballed the rocks flanking the cave's entrance.\
  \ They looked rough and slick, the waves spitting up foam that clung to their dark\
  \ flanks. One misstep, and a boy would tumble into the water. <i>A boy or his mother</i>,\
  \ she reminded herself. She was glad she had a good sense of balance after working\
  \ on ships all these years. </p> \n   <p>The yellow glow of Tam's lantern lit up\
  \ the dark hollow of the cave, and as Jendara followed behind him, her own light\
  \ redoubled the glow. It wasn't much of a cave, just ten or twelve feet gnawed into\
  \ the cliff wall. A battered rowboat bobbed on the waves, as if sheltering peacefully\
  \ while waiting for its owner.</p> \n   <p>\"What's this?\" Tam murmured, peering\
  \ inside. He jumped back, nearly toppling off the rock he'd been balancing on.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"What is it?\" Vorrin asked.</p> \n   <p>But Jendara could see for herself\
  \ the still figure at the bottom of the boat, the long white hair and singed black\
  \ cloak. The wise woman from Black Bay Island. </p> \n   <p>Tam leaned over again,\
  \ his nose wrinkling as he pointed out a smear of dung on the gunwale. \"I'm not\
  \ sure, but this looks like goblin dog to me.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara balled her hands\
  \ into fists. The sliver of ice burning down the back of her neck had been a true\
  \ warning, not the trite discomfort of an overprotective mother. There were goblins\
  \ on this island, and given goblins' love for dark holes in the ground, the little\
  \ bastards were probably exploring the same damn cave her son was.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Well, whatever it is, one thing's for sure,\" Tam said slowly. </p> \n   <p>\"What?\"\
  \ Jendara growled.</p> \n   <p>\"No one's in this cave.\"</p> \n   <p>They picked\
  \ their way out of the lowest sea cave and stared up at the other entrances. The\
  \ cave mouths looked far above the beach, dark and unwelcoming. The sun sank another\
  \ degree lower in the sky.</p> \n   <p>\"Time to climb.\" Jendara slung her length\
  \ of rope over her shoulder and reached for the first handhold in the cliff face.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Somewhere above, something wailed, its voice hollow and unbearably\
  \ sad.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> The stunning conclusion of Wendy Wagner's\
