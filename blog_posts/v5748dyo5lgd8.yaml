  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Alright\
  \ guys, this is it! The <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a>\
  \ releases next week and this is the final rules preview blog, featuring the hunter.\
  \ When describing the druid class to a new player, you would often say something\
  \ \"She casts nature spells, turns into animals, and has an animal pet if you want\"\
  . For the ranger, it might be \"He fights well against certain foes in certain terrains\
  \ and eventually gets nature magic and an animal pet if you want\". The hunter is\
  \ a hybrid of the two, and she pushes the pet up in that list, \"She casts nature\
  \ magic spells and has an animal pet with all kinds of synergies.\" Those of you\
  \ who were watching my little teasers know that there's a tweak to the hunter that,\
  \ while small in terms of wordcount, I think will have major repercussions in making\
  \ the hunter awesome.Flavorwise, you might have been able to pull off some of the\
  \ hunter feel before with a ranger or druid character. In fact, this class was the\
  \ one that was the hardest sell to me as a playtester, as the first playtest version\
  \ felt like you could make an archetype of druid that traded out wild shape for\
  \ the hunter abilities and it wouldn't be too out of line for an archetype. Perhaps\
  \ an alternate class at most. Basically, she was a prepared Wisdom-based caster\
  \ like the druid, with the druid's BAB and skill points, mostly druid weapons and\
  \ armor plus bows, using the druid spell list but casting with the 6th-level spellcasting\
  \ advancement of a magus. She got a bunch of teamwork feats that the companion automatically\
  \ shared, which was pretty cool, and a feature called animal focus that gave her\
  \ and her companion a choice from a menu of small but generally useful buffs as\
  \ a swift action with very limited uses.</span></p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \ by Subroto Bhaumik\n    </div> \n    <p>Playtest feedback was mostly along the\
  \ same linesâ€”the teamwork feats were a good start, but hunter still had a way to\
  \ go if she wanted to be able to hang out with the druids and rangers and hold her\
  \ own. So she whistled for her companion and retreated into the woods to meditate\
  \ on her nature. Though she hadn't made as many friends as she wanted yet, she wasn't\
  \ lonely with her companion there. When she emerged, she had some substantial upgrades.\
  \ For one, she could now use all martial weapons and despite the lack of proficiency,\
  \ she wasn't restricted from wearing heavy armor if she wanted. More importantly,\
  \ she gained earlier access on abilities like wild empathy, she scored free Precise\
  \ Shot at level 2, and her animal focus now worked for about triple the number of\
  \ minutes per day on her and permanently on her animal companion (she could still\
  \ switch it out). She even cooked up a few new teamwork feats that worked great\
  \ for a hunter.</p> \n    <p>But there was still plenty of good feedback about the\
  \ hunter needing to change a bit more to find her niche. Many playtesters gave feedback\
  \ that when running side-by-side comparisons of druids and hunters in their games,\
  \ despite all the hunter had gained, she was still not doing as well as the druid.\
  \ Unlike most of the other classes in my reveal blog, the hunter has plenty of new\
  \ secrets to share, including multiple new class features involving using her link\
  \ to scout and raising her companion from the dead. For melee hunters, that free\
  \ Precise Shot freebie I mentioned can now be swapped for an extremely juicy early-access\
  \ Outflank at level 2! If your companion dies in action, all the permanent animal\
  \ focus powers instantly shift over to you, allowing you to stack up to four different\
  \ powers onto yourself starting at level 8. The hunter even has 6 skill points per\
  \ level now!</p> \n    <p>But the big change is so exciting, it gets its own paragraph.\
  \ Remember how the hunter can cast spells from the druid spell list, up to 6th level\
  \ spells? Well now, she can cast ranger spells too. And if they're on both lists,\
  \ she casts them using the lower level. That's right, she's the only class in the\
  \ game who can cast <i>resist energy</i> as a 1st-level character! <i>Gravity bow</i>,\
  \ <i>lead blades</i>, and <i>aspect of the falcon</i> at 1st. <i>Wind wall</i> and\
  \ <i>spike growth</i> as 2nd-level spells at 4th. The list goes on. She's also a\
  \ spontaneous caster now, so she doesn't have to load up her slots with <i>resist\
  \ energy</i> to still be able to cast it when you need it. So basically, for low\
  \ levels, at least (particularly, 1, 2, and 4), the hunter is arguably a better\
  \ caster than the druid in some situations (the druid still has the ability to prepare\
  \ any spell from her list when you need that odd spell, so she still has her place),\
  \ with better skills, better weapons, and a kickass companion. There's still plenty\
  \ of reason to play a druid, but through one elegant change, the hunter has vaulted\
  \ her way up to the point where I hope she will satisfy many of the playtesters\
  \ who shape her new abilities.</p> \n    <p>Alright then, on to the archetypes!\
  \ Today we'll be going on a hunt through the archetype section to stalk that cool-looking\
  \ guy with the white tiger you see over there. He's definitely not the verminous\
  \ hunter because he doesn't have a vermin companion, though he does look badass\
  \ enough to be able to walk right through swarms. He's not the packmaster because\
  \ he doesn't have several animal companions. While he definitely looks feral, he\
  \ probably isn't the feral hunter because the feral hunter trades out the animal\
  \ companion to gain permanent bonuses, wild shape, and boosts to summoned allies,\
  \ though perhaps that's a summoned tiger by his side. He's also probably not the\
  \ divine hunter, since even though I could believe he has access to a domain's powers\
  \ and granted spells, that tiger doesn't look celestial or fiendish. So what's the\
  \ conclusion? Well, I suppose he might be the feral hunter with a summoned tiger,\
  \ but personally I think he's waiting to be your next PC! Anyone want to stat him\
  \ up here in this thread? Perhaps it will help tide your salivating hunger for the\
  \ final book. Soon, my friends. Soon.</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
