               <p itemprop="description">For many heroes, their choice of weapon says more about their personality and sense of aesthetics than their penchant for mechanical optimization. For others, form follows function, and still others blend the two. But what sort of weapon fits your personality best? Let's take a look at various weapons and figure it out!</p> 
               <h2>Simple, Martial, or Exotic?</h2> 
               <p>All weapons in Pathfinder are simple, martial, or exotic, based on their rough level of power. Unlike in Pathfinder First Edition, exotic weapons are not just a mixture of powerful European weapons and weapons from other cultures that only occasionally had a leg up over their martial kin. In Pathfinder Second Edition, we have a different way of talking about whether a weapon is likely to be found in a particular region, and so a weapon's type instead describes a weapon's mix of power and flexibility. Simple weapons usually have a smaller damage die than similar martial weapons (d6 rather than d8, for instance), and exotic weapons usually use the same damage die as a martial weapon but include additional abilities that make the weapon more complex.</p> 
               <p>Characters start with proficiency in either groups of weapons or lists of individual weapons, and they can take ancestry or general feats (and, rarely, class feats) to gain more!</p> 
               <h2>Weapon Traits</h2> 
               <p>Whatever your weapon proficiencies, you'll want to choose a weapon with useful traits that match your taste and play style. Even among martial weapons that use two hands, a bo staff, a greatsword, and a glaive all feel very different.</p> 
               <p>A greatsword deals a lot of damage, perfect for a bruiser character like a worshiper of Gorum: its damage die is d12 and you can seamlessly switch between piercing and slashing damage to avoid enemy resistances and exploit their weaknesses.</p> 
               <p>A bo staff is all about controlling the fight. Its damage die is only d8, but it has reach (allowing you to Strike enemies up to 10 feet away), parry (allowing you to spend an action to increase your AC much like a light shield), and trip (giving you several benefits to your attempts to trip enemies). Plus, it has the monk trait, which weapon-wielding monks particularly enjoy.</p> 
               <p>The glaive has a d8 damage die like the bo staff and shares its reach, but that's where the similarities end. The glaive has deadly d8 (dealing additional d8s of damage on a critical hit), and it is forceful (which means once you get it going and build up momentum, your attacks become more and more powerful: 1 extra damage per die on the second attack of your turn, 2 extra damage for any attacks after that). The glaive-user isn't interested in giving up an action for defense like a character with a bo staff; instead, she does best if she artfully sweeps the blade like a brush, focusing on accuracy and multiple attacks to really dish out the damage—particularly fitting for a follower of Shelyn.</p> 
               <p>We want to give every weapon a different personality like this so that we can better serve the infinite personalities that players bring with their characters!</p> 
               <p>Some other fun weapon traits I haven't covered yet: Twin weapons like the saw-toothed saber deal more damage if you fight with two of them. Backswing weapons like the greatclub gain a little accuracy after a miss. Backstabber weapons like the dogslicer deal more damage to flat-footed targets. Agile weapons like the shortsword decrease the penalty for making multiple attacks in a single turn. Finesse weapons like the rapier use your Dexterity modifier for attack rolls if you prefer. Two-hand weapons like the bastard sword deal much higher damage if you wield them in two hands instead of one!</p>

               <h2>Critical Specialization and Weapon Groups</h2> 
               <p>Traits give us some really cool ways to distinguish weapons, but we decided to throw one more customization factor into the mix, this time for similar groups of weapons: critical specialization effects.</p> 
               <p>Characters who unlock their weapon's critical specialization effect gain a special bonus effect on a critical hit that's different for each weapon group. For example, let's compare swords, spears, and axes.</p> 
               <p>Swords make the target flat-footed on a critical hit, making it easier for you and your allies to hit the target again (and making the group's rogue very happy). This cements swords like the greatsword or a longsword as great choices for dealing damage to challenging foes like bosses, as they have high damage and decrease the boss's AC so your team can hit more often.</p> 
               <p>Spears pierce the target and weaken its attacks. This makes a spear a good option for someone using a more defensive strategy built around negating enemy attacks.</p> 
               <p>Axes swing to an adjacent target (if any), damaging that target, too! Combined with the fact that axes usually have the sweep trait, giving you a bonus on attacks when you move on to a new target in the same turn, this makes axes extremely well suited for sweeping up groups of enemies.</p> 
               <p>These are just a few of the possibilities. For instance, daggers can cause persistent bleed damage, and clubs can knock the target up to 10 feet away (particularly amusing on a well-placed Attack of Opportunity).</p> 
               <h2>Weapon Quality</h2> 
               <p>Weapons, as well as other non-weapon items (but come on, those aren't as cool as weapons, right?), can be poor quality, standard quality, expert quality, master quality, or legendary quality.</p> 
               <p>Quality grants an item bonus or penalty of the same value as the matching proficiency (so an expert bow grants a +1 item bonus to hit and a legendary axe grants a +3 item bonus to hit). You have to have the matching proficiency to Craft a weapon of that quality though, so you can't make a master sword, for instance, unless you are a master at Crafting.</p> 
               <p>And now you know the basics about weapons! All there is to do now is choose the weapon that suits you. Until next time!</p>

               <p>Gnomes are a miniature painter's dream, in no small part because they're small minis, so they don't use up a lot of paint, but also because they come in every color you can imagine. The sample painted renders depicted below are pretty conservative with their hair color choices, but you can paint them whatever hue catches your fancy, and repaint them when the gnome's mercurial fey blood leads them to change that hair color mid-campaign. First we have the <a href="/products/btpya154?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Gnome-Male-Bard">male gnome bard</a>. A world-renowned musician, this character has a version with and without his short sword (and different armor), but he never goes anywhere without his harp!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Joining the bard is the fellow arcane caster, <a href="/products/btpya153?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Gnome-Female-Sorcerer">female gnome sorcerer</a>. She’s got two spell effects sculpted into her figures, which can be customized to be flames, lightning, acid, or whatever you need them to be with a simple ink wash. If you’re fine with her clothes changing, she could even represent the same character casting two different spells, getting swapped out for one another in the middle of combat.</p>

               <p>Turning to a more natural set of spellcasters, we have the <a href="/products/btpya152?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Gnome-Male-Druid">male</a> and <a href="/products/btpya14v?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Gnome-Female-Druid">female gnome druids</a>. Like the sorcerer, they all have clear plastic spell effects (including <i>call lightning</i> and <i>produce flame</i>, it looks like). One of my favorite aspects of the druids and sorcerer is that they could also serve as members of just about any spellcasting class, from arcanist to wizard. There's no reason you can't use the sorcerer above as a druid (just put her in a green robe; that's what makes someone a druid, right?) or the druids below as sorcerers.</p>

               </div> 
               <p itemprop="description">Deities and their domains are a big part of what makes clerics special. Logan set the stage with <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkqb?Cleric-Class-Preview">his cleric blog on Monday</a>, so now let's get into the weeds and take a look at how we structured deities and domains.</p> 
               <h2>Basic Deities</h2> 
               <p>For each deity, we present some basic information, including areas of concern, titles, alignment, edicts, anathema, and favored weapon. Most of these are familiar or self-explanatory. One of the newer entries, anathema, is a concept Logan mentioned on Monday. This entry provides examples of actions that violate the deity's tenets. Let's take Shelyn as an example.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <h3>Shelyn</h3> 
                <p>The Eternal Rose is the goddess of art, beauty, love, and music. She seeks to one day redeem her corrupted brother Zon-Kuthon.</p> 
                <p><b>Alignment</b> NG<br> <b>Edicts</b> be peaceful, choose and perfect an art, lead by example, see the beauty in all things<br> <b>Anathema</b> destroy works of art or allow one to be destroyed except to save a life or in pursuit of greater art, refuse to accept surrender, strike first<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> glaive</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>This entry gives you a good idea of how to play a Shelynite PC of any class. For example, a fighter faithful Shelyn might consider wielding her goddess's favored weapon, and even lay followers would likely feel terrible guilt at committing anathema acts even though they face no mechanical consequence for doing so. But what kind of cool stuff do you get if you're a cleric of a specific deity?</p> 
               <h2>Clerics and Deities</h2> 
               <p>Your choice of deity is essential when determining what type of cleric you play. A free-spirited and optimistic Desnan cleric, a tyrannical and scheming Asmodean, and a self-reliant perfectionist Iroran all relate to the world in different ways. We wanted to reflect this with a variety of character customization options based on deity! We've included a chart that indicates each deity's areas of concern, alignment (and the alignments allowed for their clerics), type of channeled energy (positive, negative, or either), signature skill, favored weapon, domains, and spells. For instance, here's Shelyn's entry on that table:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <div class="callout-block"> 
                 <table class="table-spacing-large" style="width: 100%;"> 
                  <tbody>
                   <tr>
                    <td>Shelyn</td>
                    <td>Art, beauty, love, and music</td>
                    <td>NG (LG, NG, CG)</td>
                    <td>Positive</td>
                    <td>Crafting</td>
                    <td>Glaive</td>
                    <td>Creation, family,<br>passion, protection</td>
                    <td>1st: <i>color spray</i>,<br>3rd: <i>enthrall</i>, 4th: <i>creation</i></td>
                   </tr>
                  </tbody> 
                 </table> 
                </div> 
               </blockquote> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180427-Domains.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180427-Domains_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>The deity's areas of concern include a brief restatement of her titles.</p> 
               <p>You'll notice the alignment lists not only Shelyn's alignment of neutral good, but also all the alignments her clerics could have in parentheses. Listing it this way allows us (or you, for your own deities) to be more expressive when creating deities. For instance, Norgorber now has slightly different alignments permitted for his clerics depending on which aspect of the deity they worship! Or, you could create a new deity of balance through opposing extremes who accepts only neutral, lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil clerics.</p> 
               <p>Listing the type of channeled energy the deity grants allows for some really exciting situations. For instance, Lamasthu may be an incredibly evil deity of nightmares, but she's also a deity of the wild fecundity of the Abyss, so she allows her clerics to choose negative or positive energy when channeling. You could even have a good deity that granted only negative energy (none of the core deities worshiped in the Inner Sea region of Golarion do so, but it could be possible for a deity like Tsukiyo, perhaps, as part of his dualism with Shizuru) or an evil deity that could grant only positive energy.</p> 
               <p>The deity's signature skill is in addition to those all clerics gain, so Shelynite clerics always have the ability to reach great heights in Crafting. Norgorberite clerics, in contrast, gain Stealth in order to blend into the shadows, allowing them to fit in well with clandestine groups.</p> 
               <p>What about those spells at the end? Those are three extra spells that all clerics of Shelyn can prepare and cast! These aren't in any sort of special "domain slots" like before; you can cast them as few or as many times as you want. Oh, and Sarenrae has <i>fireball</i>!</p> 
               <p>But wait, Mark, what about...</p> 
               <h2>Domains</h2> 
               <p>Pathfinder First Edition has a list of domains that cover a variety of basic concepts but miss others entirely, and they are fairly generic, which means they don't always convey the nuance of why your deity has that domain. A great example of this was the Death domain and all its undead spells not really fitting with Pharasma, the goddess of death who hates undead.</p> 
               <p>One of the earliest and coolest innovations to domains in Pathfinder appeared in the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>, where subdomains altered domains to add nuance. In the playtest, we're bringing in that sort of flexibility right away! Each domain has a basic power and an advanced power, and because domain powers work as spells, creating a new domain that's perfect for your world is as simple as adding two spells. This allowed us to include significantly more domains in the game and will allow us to expand to even more domains with ease. Here's the list of new domains that don't share a name with any of the old domains (some names you might recognize from subdomains):</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>Ambition</li> 
                <li>Cities</li> 
                <li>Confidence</li> 
                <li>Creation</li> 
                <li>Dreams</li> 
                <li>Family</li> 
                <li>Fate</li> 
                <li>Freedom</li> 
                <li>Indulgence</li> 
                <li>Light</li> 
                <li>Might</li> 
                <li>Moon</li> 
                <li>Nature</li> 
                <li>Nightmares</li> 
                <li>Pain</li> 
                <li>Passion</li> 
                <li>Perfection</li> 
                <li>Secrecy</li> 
                <li>Truth</li> 
                <li>Tyranny</li> 
                <li>Undeath</li> 
                <li>Wealth</li> 
                <li>Zeal</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>These domains allow for a variety of powers that can really give you the feel of playing a cleric of a specific deity, both in combat and out! For example, take a look at this fun noncombat basic power from the Indulgence domain:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Enhance Victuals (Transmutation) <span class="stat-block-cr">Power 1</span></p> 
                <p class="stat-block"><b>Casting</b> 1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal Casting)<br> <b>Range</b> touch; <b>Target</b> 1 nonmagical pint of water or pound of food</p> 
                <p>You transform the target into delicious fare, changing water into wine or another fine beverage or enhancing food's taste and ingredients to make it a gourmet treat. The transformation also attempts to counteract toxins in the food or water. If you have Spell Points, you can add an additional pint or pound for each additional Spell Point you spend. The feast vanishes if not consumed.</p> 
                <p><b>Heightened (+1)</b> Increase initial and additional pints or pounds by 1.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>So if you're a cleric of Cayden Cailean or Urgathoa, you're going to be able to party in style. Since powers are automatically heightened as you gain levels, that means for just 1 Spell Point, a 7th-level cleric can make enough gourmet food for her whole adventuring party to have a meal, and they'll be able to throw a banquet to serve an incredible number of guests if they pour plenty of Spell Points into it during downtime. That's all with only 1 minute to prepare, making them a wonderful host for any occasion!</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, the Fate domain has an advanced power that might come in handy in a clutch. But I'll ask you before we dive in—are you feeling lucky?</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Tempt Fate (divination, Fortune) <span class="stat-block-cr">Power 2</span></p> 
                <p class="stat-block"><b>Casting</b> [[F]] Somatic free action; <b>Trigger</b> You or an ally within range attempts a saving throw.<br> <b>Range</b> 120 feet; <b>Target</b> you or a willing ally in range</p> 
                <p>If the triggering saving throw's result is a success, it counts as a critical success. If it's a failure, it counts as a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion. If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition, tempt fate fails and your Spell Point is refunded.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>With tempt fate, you take your fate into your own hands, promising either total vindication from your saving throw or total disaster! This was a favorite of Jason's cleric of Pharasma in one of our playtests, and needless to say, it's a better choice to use this for your strong saving throws than your weak ones.</p> 
               <p>But what about Shelyn? Let's close by taking a look at two of the powers from her granted domains, one for in combat and one for outside of combat:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Unity (Abjuration, Fortune) <span class="stat-block-cr">Power 2</span></p> 
                <p class="stat-block"><b>Casting</b> [[R]] Verbal reaction; <b>Trigger</b> You and one or more allies within range are targeted by a spell or ability that allows a saving throw.<br> <b>Range</b> 30 feet</p> 
                <p>You allow your allies within range to use your saving throw modifier instead of their own. Each ally decides individually which modifier to use.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Unity is really useful for a support cleric with good saving throw modifiers, and it's particularly great for those dangerous area effects that require Will saving throws like a harpy's song, since few allies will be able to match your cleric's Will modifier!</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Artistic Flourish (Transmutation) <span class="stat-block-cr">Power 2</span></p> 
                <p class="stat-block"><b>Casting</b> 10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)<br> <b>Range</b> touch; <b>Target</b> one item or work of art<br> <b>Duration</b> 24 hours</p> 
                <p>You infuse the target with artisanal and artistic vision. Its quality increases to match your proficiency rank in Crafting, to a maximum of expert. The target is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously temporary, so it can't be sold for more than normal. This doesn't allow you to use the target to Craft a magic item that requires the new quality or perform any other task requiring a permanent item of that quality.</p> 
                <p><b>Heightened (4th)</b> If you spend 1 additional Spell Point, the maximum quality increases to master.<br> <b>Heightened (8th)</b> If you spend 2 additional Spell Points, the maximum quality increases to legendary.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Not only is artistic flourish a great way to express your character's inner artisan, but it can also be of great use in a pinch when you could really use a very specific tool or item of high quality. Legendary-quality items aren't cheap, after all! This is also a great example of one way that using Spell Points allows us to play around a bit more and make the spell more interesting by varying costs. You saw this a bit earlier with <i>enhance victuals</i>, but here it's more than just the ability to save extra castings for a large batch. These sorts of flourishes are possible to word under a "uses per day" system, but it's awkward, and they're straightforward to create and easy to understand with a Spell Point pool.</p> 
               <p>So who's your favorite deity? What sorts of new domains can you imagine with this new system? Let me know in the comments below!</p>

               <p><i>This is the fifteenth installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href="http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml" target="_blank">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a href="/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy">here</a>.</i></p> 
               <p itemprop="description">The <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkhw">previous article</a> offered some general strategies for choosing cards as you build your characters; this one goes into the tactics: which cards are you looking for?</p> 
               <h2>Upgrade your magic and elemental traits</h2> 
               <p>Your characters will start off with mundane weapons and with subpar elements like Poison.</p> 
               <p>Prioritize grabbing Magic weapons and especially Fire magic. One of the main reasons for this is monsters like Rise of the Runelords' Troll, which is one of the most annoying banes ever if you don't have the Fire (or Acid) trait to permanently put him to rest. Every Adventure Path has cards that require specific traits to defeat, and Magic and Fire are two of the most important.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-Troll.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004-Troll_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ScorchingRay.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ScorchingRay_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Burn it with <i>fire</i>.</p>
               </div> 
               <p>Generally, it's good to accumulate cards that upgrade your elemental traits. Poison is the worst, because many things are immune to it. Force is the best, because not much is immune to it. So replace Poison with Acid, Cold, Electricity, or Fire when you can, then replace those with Force.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: Diversify your traits.</i> When you're upgrading, don't get too focused on one trait. Occasionally you'll meet monsters like the Troll that require a specific element to defeat; more frequently you'll meet a monster immune to particular elements. So it's always good to have variety in your hand.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-SunFalcon.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-SunFalcon_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-ScrollOfThoth.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-ScrollOfThoth_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Sometimes nothing burns like the&nbsp;cold.</p>
               </div>  
               <h2>Offset gaps in your party</h2> 
               <p>When you're gathering cards, look for ones that offset ability gaps in your party. That means if you're missing a specific skill, get cards that will help you succeed at tests of that skill. Allies are the most common card type that give you a bonus in a particular skill, and they have the additional advantage that they can usually be used to explore, which means they won't be stuck in your hand: use them to explore when there's not an obvious need for their skill bonus.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: If you're short on healers, get healing.</i> To offset a lack of healing spells or powers, you can most obviously get Potions of Healing. However, there are also occasional allies or other items that can offset this deficit. Spread these healing cards out, and in particular give them to characters who are light on recharging and heavy on discarding, like Seelah or Seoni.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #2: If you're short on disablers, get toolkits.</i> If your party generally lacks the Disable skill, spread around items that can help with traps and other barriers. Thieves' Tools and Masterwork Tools are the obvious choices, but the Crowbar can also be shockingly useful.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ThievesTools.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ThievesTools_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Crowbar.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Crowbar_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Sometimes the right tool for the job is a Tool.</p>
               </div> 
               <h2>Upgrade your skills</h2> 
               <p>Sometimes, instead of filling ability gaps in your party, you want to accentuate what you already have. Hunt for items that will improve the characters' best skills to make them all the more able to close locations (or to succeed at other skill tests). Get Merisiel Boots of Elvenkind and Seoni a Crown of Charisma. Find a Sage for Kyra or a Standard Bearer for Harsk.</p> 
               <p>These might not be the best boons for these characters long-term, but improving good stats should always be a consideration.</p> 
               <h2>Don't be afraid of inappropriate cards</h2> 
               <p>When you're improving your characters, you'll generally want to take cards that the characters are proficient with and to avoid the ones that they can't use to their best effect. But this is not always the best strategy. Sometimes you'll want to take an inappropriate card because it's better than an appropriate card, because it helps your character (or the party) fill an ability gap, or just because it's what's available.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: Remember that inappropriate spells still allow one use.</i> It's perfectly okay for Arcane casters to pick up Divine-only spells and for Divine casters to grab Arcane-only spells. They just end up being single shots. This works best for spells where you're not adding the skill's die. So, if your party really needs healing, don't be afraid to give your Arcane caster Cure. Similarly, a Divine caster could take Mirror Image to help with damage or Teleport to help with movement.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Cure.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Cure_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Teleport.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Teleport_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Don't fear that last paragraph.</p>
               </div> 
               <p><i>Corollary #2: Remember that inappropriate armor is usable.</i> Armor can be ineffective in two ways if you don't have the appropriate proficiency. First, it often gets banished when you reduce large amounts of damage. Second, it often can't be recharged at round's end. The first problem is not a problem at all: if it's great armor, keep it, and if you use it, you can hopefully replace it with something else great. However, not being able to recharge is problematic, because it clogs your hand. Still, there will sometimes be inappropriate, non-recharging armor that's worthwhile.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #3: Remember that inappropriate weapons… are probably still bad.</i> If you don't have the required proficiency for a weapon, it tends to increase the difficulty for challenges, usually by 4. It feels like a really good weapon should overcome this problem, but that doesn't tend to be the case. You're unlikely to find an inappropriate weapon that adds at least 5 (or a d10) more than an available weapon that [i]doesn't[/i] require proficiency, and that's what you typically need for it to actually be better.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6036-DancingScimitar.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6036-DancingScimitar_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-DjinniQuarterstaff.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-DjinniQuarterstaff_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>The right weapon in the wrong hands is the wrong weapon.</p>
               </div> 
               <p><i>Corollary #4: Use inappropriate card to create voids.</i> Inappropriate items that get banished (i.e. spells and armor) can work very well in a voiding strategy where you're trying to end up with too few of a card type so that you can choose a new card from the box. Hold onto these banishable cards during a game when you have an excess of the card type, then banish them in a later game when you're not gaining that type of card.</p> 
               <h2>Plan for your blessings</h2> 
               <p>Some characters get benefits from specific blessings on their role cards. Try to plan for this. Look at your role card early on, choose your preferred role, and start collecting any appropriate blessings. If you don't, it's possible you'll never get many of the right blessings, because the role card arrives relatively late in the game.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ColdIronWarden.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ColdIronWarden_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-InheritorsBlade.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-InheritorsBlade_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Count your blessings before they hatch. (Or something like that.)</p>
               </div> 
               <p>Sometimes building your deck is as much about what you get rid of as what you keep...</p> 
               <h2>Don't get hung up on banishable cards</h2> 
               <p>Cards that must be banished to be used are usually powerful, so it's tempting to always put them in your deck. Don't. Consider any banishable card carefully and be sure that it's a great card that you'll actually use.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: Throw out banishable cards you're not using.</i> If you didn't manage to use a banishable card for two or three scenarios, get rid of it. It might have a great power, but if you never play it, who cares? (But before you put it back in the box, see if perhaps another character would be more likely to play it.)</p> 
               <h2>Don't get hung up on loot</h2> 
               <p>There's a tendency to hold onto loot because it's unique and was given as a special prize. There's a lot of loot that <i>is</i> worth keeping through an entire Adventure Path, but some loot may never be valuable to you, and other loot may get overshadowed over time. Toss it out if something else looks better!</p> 
               <p>And that brings my look at improving characters to a close… and it also ends my series of general strategy articles for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. I've thought about writing some articles about the specifics of certain characters and about all the different sorts of cards, but for now other writing is calling me. Maybe I'll return some day.</p> 
               <p>For now, thank you to Mike Selinker and Paizo for giving me this opportunity to talk about my strategy ideas and for publishing a game that's racked up over 100 games on my tabletop. And thank you to everyone here on the forums who contributed corrections and additional strategy ideas. I intend to gather them all up at some point and use them to put together a v2 of these strategy articles, probably on my <a href="http://mechanics-and-meeples.com" target="_blank">Mechanics &amp; Meeples</a> blogs.</p> 
               <p>Until then, see you in Golarion!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">This April the Organized Play team releases our next set of Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild scenarios. I wanted to take a moment to highlight these two unique scenarios.</p> 
               <p><a href="/products/btpy9zjv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-12-Ashes-of-Discovery"><em>Starfinder Society #1-12: Ashes of Discovery</em></a> written by Pathfinder Society veteran Crystal Malarsky and John Laffan, is our second Tier 1-4 repeatable scenario. The team knew we wanted another repeatable scenario early on to help new players have sufficient content to play alongside our growing stable of veterans. One element that was missing from our previous repeatable was the presence of a starship combat, so we made sure to include one in this adventure. This encounter should provide more introductory starship encounters for new players interested in dipping their feet into some of Starfinder’s more unique rules. Another element of this scenario that has me particularly excited is that it serves as a launching point for countless adventures, and while it doesn’t connect with some of our grander story arcs, it serves to set-up new relationships between the Starfinder Society and several Pact Worlds organizations.</p> 
               <p>This scenario has the Repeatable and Starship tags.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0112E-BesmaranWhelp.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0112E-BesmaranWhelp_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Our next scenario continues the ongoing Scoured Stars storyline, <a href="/products/btpy9zjw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-13-On-the-Trail-of-History"><em>Starfinder Society #1-13: On the Trail of History</em></a> by another Pathfinder veteran, Christopher Wasko. It’s hard to say much about this scenario without spoiling some of the events from last month’s Scoured Stars event, <a href="/products/btpy9y4m?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-111-In-Pursuit-of-the-Scoured-Past">Starfinder Society #1-11: In Pursuit of the Scoured Past</a>. What I can say, is that this is a story that goes back to some of the root of what sets Starfinder apart. Exploring a new world and interacting with new cultures, all while fighting against external threats that could bring the entire mission to an abrupt end! Another interesting tidbit, is that this scenario is the first that started connecting to our upcoming interactive special, <a href="/products/btpya08y/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion"><em>Starfinder Society #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</em></a>. I know for a fact that Christopher and Mikko were thick as thieves in their dealings while writing their respective adventures, and some of the story connections are sure paying off as I sit here developing the interactive.</p> 
               <p>This scenario has the Faction (Second Seekers [Luwazi Elsebo]) and Starship tags and contributes to the ongoing year of the Scoured Stars storyline.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Spring has arrived, and that means that the Organized Play team is in full gear preparing for convention season. Tonya talked about some of the exciting offerings we have coming up next month at PaizoCon in <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkq1?Organized-Play-at-PaizoCon-2018">last week's blog</a>, so if you haven't seen that yet, I recommend checking it out. I've attended PaizoCon for the past six years, and I've always had a wonderful time.

               <p itemprop="description">Spring has arrived, and that means that the Organized Play team is in full gear preparing for convention season. Tonya talked about some of the exciting offerings we have coming up next month at PaizoCon in <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkq1?Organized-Play-at-PaizoCon-2018">last week's blog</a>, so if you haven't seen that yet, I recommend checking it out. I've attended PaizoCon for the past six years, and I've always had a wonderful time. Sometimes I play pretty much the whole time, sometimes I GM more, and other times I keep my schedule light so I can focus on meeting new people and reconnecting with old friends, but I've always found it well worth the trip.</p> 
               <p>But what do we have to offer for you this month? We have two more adventures to introduce, both of which send the PCs to nations that we have never before visited in Organized Play. The first, <a href="/products/btpy9zk2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-18-Scourge-of-the-Farheavens"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-18: Scourge of the Farheavens</em></a>, takes place just off the northeastern edge of the Inner Sea map, in the plague-blighted land of Iobaria. I'll turn it over to Michael Sayre, who took the lead on this project, to tell you more.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><em>Scourge of the Farheavens</em> takes place primarily in Iobaria, which was an exciting proposition simply for how little time the Pathfinder Society has spent in that area. Getting the opportunity to explore this relatively under-supported area of Golarion and learn more about the people who live there was an exciting proposition, particularly given that this scenario will give the PCs a peek at the god-caller traditions of a Sarkorian clan. Jason Owen Black did an amazing job of breathing life into the decimated remnants of the Farheavens clan and the harsh living conditions of the Iobarian wilderness, while Sebastian Rodriguez's illustration of Dolok Darkfur conveys exactly the right mix of ferocity and loneliness. As much as I love the rich depth of the characters and environment in this scenario, I would be remiss if I failed to mention that this scenario features some harrowing encounters that convey the true dangers of the Iobarian forests in appropriately deadly fashion.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Our second scenario this month, <a href="/products/btpy9zk3?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-19-Clash-in-Kaimuko-Wood"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-19: Clash in Kaimuko Wood</em></a>, sends the PCs into the aasimar nation of Tianjing. The country's military is ill-prepared for the ancient threat that lurks in Kaimuko Wood, and evil forces plot to take advantage of their weakened defenses. Thanks to the Pathfinder Society's successful efforts in <a href="/products/btpy9y4g?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-912-Shrine-of-the-Sacred-Tempest"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-12: Shrine of the Sacred Tempest</em></a>, a highly trained group of tengu mercenaries has agreed to lend their swords to the PCs' cause. With the tengus at their command, the PCs journey to a troubled fort and finally brave a part of the forest so tainted by abyssal corruption that it burns with unholy flame. Author Jerall Toi brings rich and compelling NPCs to meet—take a look at the masked leader of the tengu band, Tai Dan, brilliantly illustrated by Hannah Boving. But this scenario certainly isn't all about roleplay, as Kaimuko Wood is crawling with creatures that are eager to make sure the PCs and their allies never escape the forest.</p>

               <p>Two of our popular Delve tables have been dedicated to running Playtest mini-adventures all weekend long. These 30-40 minute long games are designed to give you a taste of what's new in the Playtest. There is no registration for these delves, just stop by between 9:00 AM-6:00 PM Friday and Sunday, 9:00 AM-5:00 PM on Saturday, or 9:00 AM-1:00 PM on Monday. On Saturday from 9:00 AM-12:00 PM we'll have the designers themselves running the tables for groups of lucky adventurers and talking Playtest Rules with spectators.</p> 
               <p>Friday evening in Olympic 2, Guests of Honor: The Glass Cannon Podcast will be recording the finale for the Crypt of the Everflame Playtest game run by Jason Bulmahn. You can listen to <a href="https://glasscannonpodcast.com/the-pathfinder-playtest-parts-1-and-2/" target="_blank">Parts 1 &amp; 2</a> and <a href="https://glasscannonpodcast.com/the-pathfinder-playtest-parts-3-and-4/" target="_blank">Parts 3 &amp; 4</a> on Glass Cannon's website.</p> 
               <p>For a more academic approach than rolling dice at the delves, the Design team will be hosting an "Introduction to the Pathfinder Playtest" seminar on Saturday from 1:00 PM-3:00 PM followed by a "How to Playtest" panel from 3:00 PM-4:00 PM for those who want to learn all about how to provide feedback and help shape the next edition. Afterwards, from 4:00 PM-5:00 PM, Creative Director James Jacobs and Franchise Manager Mark Moreland will talk about the possible changes to the campaign setting and the world of Golarion. Rounding out the Playtest Seminars on Saturday from 5:00 PM-6:00 PM, the Design team will be back with "Find Our Path"—a panel for attendees to tell the Designers what they hope to find in the next evolution of Pathfinder.</p> 
               <p>Sunday afternoon from 2:00 PM-3:00 PM the Organized Play Q&amp;A panel will also be including a discussion on how the Playtest rules will interact with Organized Play Pathfinder games. Come with your questions for Tonya Woldridge, John Compton and Linda Zayas-Palmer.</p> 
               <p>Our Celebrity Gaming events are back for PaizoCon 2018, and Sunday's game from 3:00 PM-5:00 PM has Director of Game Design Jason Bulmahn as game master for a group of heroes played by Customer Service Rep Diego Valdez, Managing Editor Judy Bauer, Editor James Case, and Sales Associate Cosmo Eisele. Come cheer for (or against) your favorite Paizonians as they try to keep their characters alive despite the merciless machinations of Jason's GMing!</p> 
               <p>As PaizoCon winds down on Monday morning, we will again have the entire Design team at the delve tables from 9:00 AM-11:00 AM, followed by a Playtest Feedback seminar where they will discuss how the Playtest events went over during the PaizoCon weekend.</p> 
               <p>Of course, sprinkled throughout the convention, longer-form games with the Playtest rules will be run. Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton, Editor Leo Glass, Developer Chris Sims, Developer Linda Zayas-Palmer, and Editor Lyz Liddell will all be offering chances to play The Rose Street Revenge, a series of Playtest quests that will only be at PaizoCon, Origins, PaizoCon UK, and Gen Con until its official release date on August 6.</p> 
               <p>Managing Developer and master of RPG horror Amanda Hamon Kunz has prepared a special Playtest conversion of the classic Pathfinder module Gallows of Madness. Designer Logan Bonner will be offering an Osiriani Playtest adventure The House of Ekmendi and Designer Mark Seifter will be running a classic social intrigue adventure, Bid for Alabastrine, with Playtest rules. Finally, Developer Ron Lundeen has converted an adventure he authored, A Lucky Morning from Run Amok Games, to playtest rules.</p> 
               <p>These special opportunities to experience the new Playtest rules will all be in the PaizoCon event lottery. A number of our games are in high demand with only a few seats available in each game. The lottery is a way for attendees to get an equal shot at the the games they are most excited about. Once events are published on the site, attendees can rank preferences for events. We'll then run our lottery code and place attendees into events. Once that has been determined, we'll open up the general events (seminars, organized play, etc) for general registration and event trading. The preferences and lottery selection will be happening at the beginning of May—<a href="/paizocon">be sure you've got your 4-day badge</a> on your account so you can participate!</p>

               <h2>Cleric Features</h2> 
               <p>Clerics' key ability score is Wisdom. This means that they get an ability boost to Wisdom at 1st level, increasing their Wisdom score by 2. They also use this key ability to determine the DC of their spells. Like other things in the Playtest, spells are also affected by your proficiency. Clerics are trained in divine spells, so they add 10 + their level + their Wisdom modifier for their spell DC. They use this same proficiency for touch attacks of their spells and for spell rolls.</p> 
               <p>At 1st level, clerics get several class features, including their deity and domain, anathema, channel energy, and of course, divine spellcasting (which we'll talk more about in a bit). Your deity has a major impact on your character, and you'll see a lot of similarities to Pathfinder First Edition, such as being trained in your deity's favored weapon and getting access to one of their domains. (Come back on Friday for a ton of detail about those parts of your character!) Your choice of domain gives you a unique domain power. Powers are a special type of spell that come only from your class, and are cast with Spell Points—think of things from Pathfinder First Edition like domain powers or a wizard's school powers. Powers are stronger than cantrips, but not as strong as your best spells. A cleric's initial power costs 1 Spell Point to cast. She gets a starting pool of Spell Points equal to her Wisdom, and can increase this by taking feats later on. If she gets other ways to cast powers of a different type, she combines all her Spell Points into one pool.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180423-Kyra.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180423-Kyra_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>A cleric's deity also imposes some restrictions on her, collectively called anathema, representing acts that go against her deity's will and teachings or violate their alignment requirements. Though we give some examples of anathemic acts for the various gods and goddesses—like how it's anathema for a cleric of Sarenrae, goddess of honesty, to cast a spell that would help her lie better—we wanted to leave this broad enough that the GM and player can make the final say in how these work in their games. Many other classes that follow similar restrictions have their own anathema. Care to guess which ones those might be?</p> 
               <p>As you go up in level, you'll increase your proficiency rank with divine spells to expert at 12th level, master at 16th level, and legendary at 19th level.</p> 
               <h2>Divine Spellcasting</h2> 
               <p>Of course, the cleric's main feature is her divine spellcasting! At 1st level, you can cast two 1st-level spells each day, which you prepare from the selections on the divine spell list. Every time you gain an even level, you get one more spell slot per day of your highest level of spells (so at 2nd level, a cleric has three 1st-level spells per day). At every odd level, you get access to a new level of spells. You'll always be able to cast two or three spells of your highest level and three spells of every lower level, plus your cantrips and powers. Like your other spells, your 9th-level spells cap out at three spells, so at 19th level you become legendary in spellcasting instead. So what about your 10th-level spells? We'll talk about those in a future blog!</p> 
               <p>We made your number of spells more straightforward by eliminating Pathfinder First Edition's bonus spells granted for having a high ability score. Your Wisdom still matters greatly for your spell DC and other things important to clerics, but giving it slightly less weight makes it more practical now for you to play a cleric of Gorum who focuses on Strength and uses spells that don't involve your spell DC or that have decent effects even if your enemy succeeds at its save.</p> 
               <p>Now, it's not quite true to say those are all the spells you get. Remember channel energy from earlier? This feature lets you cast <i>heal</i> or <i>harm</i> an additional number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier! Moreover, these spells are heightened to the highest level of spell you cast, so as soon as you hit 3rd level, all those <i>heal</i> or <i>harm</i> spells become 2nd-level spells. This replaces the Pathfinder First Edition cleric's spontaneous healing, which required her to sacrifice her prepared spells to make room for a <i>heal</i> spell. Now, you can use your channel energy to cast these extra <i>heal</i> spells, and if you think you'll need more <i>heal</i>ing than this provides, you can always prepare more <i>heal</i> spells using your normal spell slots (in fact, this can be a good use of some of your lower-level slots as you go up in level). Your choice of deity determines which spell you can cast with channel energy. Pharasma lets you cast <i>heal</i>, Rovagug makes you cast <i>harm</i>, and someone like Abadar or Lamashtu lets you choose your path at 1st level.</p> 
               <h2>Cleric Feats</h2> 
               <p>As we've mentioned before, we always wanted Pathfinder Second Edition to provide all classes with a sizeable number of options for customization. The cleric was one of the classes that had the most to gain, since a cleric got a bunch of class features at 1st level, then crickets for the rest of her career. The cleric's new class feats give her all sorts of new flexibility, so let's look at some of those!</p> 
               <p>At 1st level, you might pick Communal healing so when you cast <i>heal</i> to tend to a creature other than yourself, you regain some Hit Points too, or you might take Turn Undead, which forces undead that critically fail their saves against your <i>heal</i> spells to flee from you. (This works great with the 3-action version of <i>heal</i>!) You could also pick Expanded Domain to explore your deity's domains further, gaining the initial power from a different domain than the first one you chose. You can select this feat twice, letting you delve into a maximum of three domains!</p> 
               <p>At higher levels, you gain new cleric feats at every even level, except levels 12 and 16, when you increase your spell DCs instead. At 4th level, you might pick up Advanced Domain to gain the advanced power from one of your domains. At 8th level, if you channel positive energy, you could take the Channeled Succor feat so you can cast <i>remove curse</i>, <i>remove disease</i>, <i>remove paralysis</i>, or <i>restoration</i> with your channeled energy spells instead of just <i>heal</i>.</p> 
               <p>Let's take a look at a category of feats clerics have plenty of: metamagic! You can activate a metamagic feat when you cast a spell. This increases the number of actions required to cast the spell and modifies the spell in some way. At 1st level, for example, you could select Reach Spell to let you add a Somatic Casting action to a spell and increase its range by 30 feet (or to make a touch spell into a ranged touch spell with a 30-foot range). This is a metamagic feat lots of spellcasters can take, but the cleric gets some others that are more specific to her as well. Command Undead, a 4th-level feat, lets you change the effects of any <i>harm</i> spell you cast to instead take control of an undead creature. Heroic Recovery, an 8th-level feat, adds a powerful buff to <i>heal</i> spells: you can target one creature at range using 3 actions (the 2-action version of <i>heal</i>, plus another action to activate the metamagic) to <i>heal</i> them for a solid number of hit points and also give them a bonus to attack and damage rolls and a 5-foot increase to its speed for 1 round. And if you use a lot of metamagic, the 20th-level cleric feat Metamagic Channeler is a great choice—it lets you apply a metamagic feat to a <i>harm</i> or <i>heal</i> spell without adding an action to its casting!</p> 
               <p>So what are your favorite parts of the new cleric? Any builds you're itching to try out? How about concepts you made in Pathfinder First Edition you'd like to take another shot at?</p>

But they don't come out until October! What will fans of elementals do until then?</p> 
               <p>Fear not, valiant Pathfinders, for our partners at WizKids have you covered with their next wave of Pathfinder Battles Deep Cuts unpainted plastic miniatures! Due out in July, these non-randomized figures are pre-primed with Acrylicos Vallejo primer, making them ready to paint straight out of the box. The preview images in this blog show digital renders of both the unpainted sculpt and a sample paint scheme to serve as inspiration. Each 2-piece blister pack comes with two copies of the same figure, in the same pose, so you can easily build an army of identical elemental warriors, or paint variant versions of the same figure.</p> 
               <p>First among this wave's elementals is the <a href="/products/btpya14y?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Medium-Earth-Elemental">Medium earth elemental</a>. Pathfinder Battles fans will recognize this sculpt as a boulder-throwing variant of the similarly named (and out of print) figure from the Shattered Star set from way back in 2013. Just like the sample paint scheme illustrated here, that figure had granite and emerald coloration, but this figure's unpainted finish means you can customize your earth elemental to fit whatever setting you want! Need a desert elemental? Paint it a tan, sandstone color with topaz or turquiose accents. Is your party facing an earth elemental on a tropical, volcanic island? Paint its body black, with ruby accents. And if it's especially lava-bound, try putting bright orange or yellow in the cracks of its body to give it a magma glow (see the <a href="/products/btpy9ao4?Pathfinder-Battles-2014-Promotional-Figure-Lava-Lurker">lava lurker promotional figure</a> for inspiration).</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Next we have the <a href="/products/btpya150?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Medium-Water-Elemental">Medium water elemental</a>, again varying up the pose of the similarly named (and out of print) figure from Shattered Star. Composed of clear plastic, the figure maintains the sense of transparency that makes water elemental figures so much fun to use at the table. Whether you want a clear blue elemental from tropical waters, or a muddy, murky gray or brown from a swamp or sewer, this figure can be customized with a thin ink wash. If you're using a pre-existing map, like a Pathfinder Flip-Mat, you can even paint the mini to match the color of whatever body of water it's going to rise out of in your game! Give it an appearance of being icy or particularly roiling with some white dry-brushing to make the whorls and wave caps really pop.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180423-MediumWater.jpg">
               </div> 
               <p>What good is a water elemental if there isn't a fire elemental for it to quench? The <a href="/products/btpya151?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Medium-Fire-Elemental">Medium fire elemental</a> is—you guessed it—a resculpt of the Shattered Star figure of the same name. Also composed of clear plastic, this figure can be customized with a variety of shades of red, orange, and yellow for traditional flames, or other colors like green and blue for more supernatural elementals summoned by strange rituals or specialized spellcasters. You can even give the figure a smoky look with a dry-brushing of sooty black.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180423-MediumFire.jpg">
               </div> 
               <p>And that's it. Just three elementals.</p> 
               <p>Nah, I'm just kidding. Of course there's a <a href="/products/btpya14z?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Medium-Air-Elemental">Medium air elemental</a> to complete the set. One of the best things about this figure is that you can use it straight out of the box without getting your brushes dirty as any number of invisible air creatures. If you are looking to paint it, however, the clear plastic again allows for a lot of variety with different ink washes. Cool blues or pale whites can capture the brisk chill of a winter breeze, while darker colors like gray or even black can give the swirling elemental the look of a raging tornado. With a bit more customization, you can attach small green or brown "leaves" to the figure's surface to represent the detritus sucked up into the whirlwind in forested or autumnal settings.</p>

               <p>While this is our first Deep Cuts blog, these are far from the first figures in the line, with dozens already in the wild in your local game store or here on paizo.com. Rather than go back and show off these unpainted figures, I'd rather give the community the chance to show off your finished Deep Cuts from the <a href="/pathfinderbattles/deepCuts">myriad figures we've previously released</a>. Post your painted Pathfinder Battles Deep Cuts figures on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter with the hashtag #PathfinderBattles and tag the official accounts for Paizo and WizKids, and we'll collect and show off our favorites in a future blog.</p> 
               <p>Next week we'll examine the wave's batch of gnome spellcasters. The "shortlist," if you will. Until then, keep your paintbrushes wet.</p>

               </div> 
               <p itemprop="description">Historically, alchemy was a protoscience with diverse traditions seen throughout the world. Its chemical discoveries were often explained and expanded upon using the metaphysical traditions of the practitioner's native culture. These alchemical experiments and observations were later refined by experimentation and rigor to become the modern science of chemistry.</p> 
               <p>In Pathfinder First Edition, alchemy was the domain of lower-level pseudo-magical treasures, at least until the alchemist made his debut in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</em>. This class forged the way for creating higher-level alchemical items and effects, though it often leaned on arcane magic to get the job done.</p> 
               <p>When we tapped the alchemist for inclusion in the Pathfinder Playtest, it gave us the chance to rethink the essentials of alchemy and create a broad tradition that reflected its historical inspiration. For the upcoming version of the game, we've pulled magic and alchemy apart. Alchemy might feature dramatic effects, but these are powered by the reactions of powerful chemicals—and sometimes catalyzed by resonance—creating a type of fantastic mad science. Where magical power comes from the energies of a spellcasting tradition, alchemical power comes from the fusion of latent potential trapped within matter, released as energy through a reaction with a different potent material. Strike a sunrod on a hard surface and its alchemical reagents combine to create light. A creature's internal chemistry interacts with an elixir of life to heal wounds or brace the body against toxins. Bombs let off explosive energy when their flask shatters against a creature, exposing the contents to the air.</p> 
               <p>While magic involves pulling energy out of thin air by way of spells, rituals, or magically empowered items, basic alchemy is a specialty of the Crafting skill. Any character with the Alchemical Crafting skill feat can create alchemical items as long as they have the proper formula, along with enough time and reagents. Alchemists know (or hazard) shortcuts to the process and can create unstable alchemical items by using an alchemist kit and paying a resonance cost.</p> 
               <p>So, what kind of items can they make in the Pathfinder Playtest? Alchemical items come in four general categories: here's what you can expect from each.</p> 
               <h2>Bombs</h2> 
               <p>This category will be familiar territory for those of you currently playing Pathfinder. Alchemist's fire, liquid ice, and bottled lightning have been a mainstay for low-level alchemists and other characters over the years. In the Pathfinder Playtest, these items are the baselines for alchemical bombs. While the base bombs deal a relatively low amount of damage, the advanced alchemy class feature allows the alchemist to infuse them with extra power according to the alchemist's level. While these powerful bombs are unstable (losing potency in either 24 hours or after a round, depending on how the alchemist crafted them), during that limited time they can pack a punch. For instance, here's bottled lightning.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Bottled Lightning <span class="stat-block-cr">Item 1</span></p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Alchemical, Bomb, Consumable, Electricity</b><br> <b>Price</b> 3 gp<br> <b>Method of Use</b> held, 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">Bottled lightning is packed with reagents that create an electric blast when exposed to air. Bottled lightning deals 1d6 electricity damage and 1 electricity splash damage and causes the target to be flat-footed to all creatures until the start of your next turn.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>If an 11th-level alchemist makes one of these bombs using his advanced alchemy, the electricity damage increases to 4d6 damage, though the splash stays at 1 (unless said alchemist takes the Calculated Bomber feat, which would increase that splash damage to his Intelligence modifier). The flat-footed effect also stacks with anything extra the alchemist might add to the bomb from his class feats, making bottled lightning a great choice when going up against bosses or high-AC foes.</p> 
               <p>Of course, there are some surprises among the alchemical bombs. Thunderstones, which deal greater sonic damage in the hands of a higher-level alchemist, and tanglefoot bags are also on the bomb list.</p> 
               <h2>Elixirs</h2> 
               <p>In Pathfinder First Edition, we have potions, elixir, and extracts, all taking up much of the same mechanical design space. In the playtest, these divisions are less ambiguous. Potions are potent liquids made by way of magical crafting and have magical, often arcane, effects. Elixirs, on the other hand, are alchemical concoctions producing effects that are often very dramatic, but are non-magical. Potions are often quicker to use and usually pack some extra oomph, but elixirs work even in places where magic is dulled or suppressed, and an alchemist can craft them in a hurry. Though both potions and elixirs are used by consuming them, and often require a bit of resonance to kick them into gear, elixirs' spectrum of effects tend to deal with changing the body or state of mind. An example of this second sort of elixir is the liquid courage found in bravo's brew.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Bravo's Brew <span class="stat-block-cr">Item 3</span></p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Alchemical, Consumable, Elixir, Mental</b><br> <b>Price</b> 7 gp<br> <b>Method of Use</b> held, 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L<br> <b>Activation</b> Operate Activation</p> 
                <p>This flask of foaming beer grants courage. For the next hour after drinking this elixir, you gain a +1 item bonus to Will saves, and a +3 item bonus to Will saves against fear.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Some of the most potent elixirs are mutagens. These elixirs transform the mind and the body in dramatic ways, granting sizeable item bonuses to a number of related skill checks and attributes. However, this comes with a drawback: penalties to some other group of relevant skills and attributes. Mutagens also tend to morph the user's physical features in some way. For instance, a lesser bestial mutagen gives you a more savage aspect with greater muscle mass, granting you a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks and unarmed attack rolls and increasing the amount of damage die you roll for such attacks, but this new form is clumsy and lumbering, imparting a -1 penalty to Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery checks, as well as to AC and Reflex saves.</p> 
               <p>Mutagens have some limitations. They must be attuned to a specific creature; this typically involves including some bit of the attuned creature's body (such as hair, nail trimmings, saliva, or the like) as a reagent during the crafting process. Moreover, you can only have one mutagen benefit active at a time, though you can suffer from any number of mutagen drawbacks simultaneously.</p> 
               <p>What about extracts? Well, in this scheme, they're just not necessary anymore. But, I wouldn't be surprised if we do something else with extracts sometime in the future, reviving that game term to make something particularly dynamic and fun.</p> 
               <h2>Poisons</h2> 
               <p>Alchemists usually deal with elixirs that bolster the body and the mind, but they can also dabble in alchemical poisons that do just the opposite. While there are many poisons in nature, alchemical poisons tend to be more refined versions of those natural poisons, often distilled or concentrated, created for both potency and ease of use.</p> 
               <p>For example, here's the sleep poison favored by drow.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Sleep Poison <span class="stat-block-cr">Item 2</span></p> 
                <p><b>Alchemical, Consumable, Injury, Poison</b><br> <b>Price</b> 5 gp<br> <b>Method of Use</b> held, 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> L<br> <b>Activation</b> 3 Operate Activations, no Resonance Point cost<br> <b>Saving Throw</b> Fortitude DC 13; <b>Maximum Duration</b> 4 hours; <b>Stage 1</b> slowed 1 (1 round); <b>Stage 2</b> asleep with no Perception check to wake up (1 round); <b>Stage 3</b> asleep with no Perception check to wake up (1d4 hours)</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Let's say you found or made a vial of sleep poison. It takes three Operate Activation actions to apply it to a weapon (which must be one that deals either piercing or slashing damage). If the next attack made by the weapon is a hit or critical hit, the target must attempt a save against the poison, gaining the effects of Stage 1 on a failure (or Stage 2 on a critical failure), with later saves determining how the poison either intensifies or is shaken off. Since the maximum duration of the poison is 4 hours, no matter what happens, the poison will be completely gone from the target's system 4 hours later.</p> 
               <p>Like all alchemical items, an alchemist can create a less stable version of a poison using his advanced alchemy, as long as he possesses the formula for that poison and has the resonance to spare. Here's the bad news. Sleep poison is a closely guarded secret of the drow, so good luck getting the formula.</p> 
               <h2>Tools</h2> 
               <p>The last category of alchemical items is tools. Tools are the items that don't fit in other categories. They typically affect the terrain, vision, or other aspects of the environment, instead of affecting a creature directly. The sunrod is one example of an alchemical tool. The smokestick is another.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Smokestick <span class="stat-block-cr">Item 1</span></p> 
                <p class="stat-block"><b>Alchemical, Consumable</b><br> <b>Price</b> 2 gp<br> <b>Method of Use</b> held, 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> L<br> <b>Activation</b> Operate Activation, no Resonance Point cost</p> 
                <p>With a sharp twist of this item, you instantly create a screen of thick, opaque smoke in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on one corner of your space. All creatures within that area are concealed. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>As you can see alchemy has become a discipline in its own right, with many tools to aid adventurers in general and the alchemist in particular.</p>

               <p>And in Nidal, the sun never fully shines.</p> 
               <p>In the forthcoming book <a href="/products/btpya0fg?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Nidal-Land-of-Shadows"><em>Nidal, Land of Shadows</em></a>, we take a deep dive into this nation, where the evil Kuthite religion is mandated on pain of slow, tortuous death. The book's authors have done an incredible job breathing creepy, nuanced life into this dismal land, as we mentioned before. On display are innumerable adventure hooks for intrepid adventures as well as details about the perils that stretch across the land. The writing in this book is, to put it succinctly, beautiful.</p> 
               <p>And so is this book's art.</p> 
               <p>From its cover to its chain-adorned page border to its chapter-opening pieces to its interior art, everything about this book just looks gorgeous in the best, most gothic-inspired way.</p> 
               <p>But don't take my word for it. Check out these interior pieces for yourself!</p>

Ultimate Enora hits a lot of great notes, just like Wrath Enora, and she's even got an impressive array of awesome books to accompany her.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               <p>I once described Enora as supercalifragilistic-Librariana-docious, and I'm pretty sure any version of Enora I make is going to get some kind of book-related role. This Enora also explores her worship of Nethys and turns into a fairly excellent healer with her White Mage role.</p>

               </div> 
               <p><em>Ultimate Magic</em> is filled to the brim with spells. There are a ton of spells of all kinds to spice up any cleric or wizard's deck. This is especially true for Attack spells, which are represented in every single adventure deck number. There's also a new cycle of spells that includes Icicle Swarm, which caters well to casters who might need to defeat a multi-check villain, and also to sometime-casters like the Magus or Bloodrager who might see benefit from a solid replacement dice expression.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Of course, many of the spells are useful outside of combat as well. Fly is a fantastic way to do a little bit of scouting from above, then go to the best location. Rejuvenation is the most powerful solution in the game for all that ails you.</p>

                <p>You can almost see the journey from child to adult here.</p> 
               </div> 
               <p>As for allies, Magical Child is a highly useful and adorable card for anyone. You might be a little confused by that "Vigilante" tag but, with the help of her magic costume, powers, and pet friend, she is totally fighting crime and making the world a better place! On the other end of the spectrum, Autumn Witch is ready to offer fabulous power to any caster who might need her assistance.</p>

                <p>The gods of magic have got your back. Or at least your existential ability to alter reality.</p> 
               </div> 
               <p>Assuming you like to reliably recharge your blessings, you'll find Blessing of the Spellbound fantastic for all of your Arcane and Divine needs. Qi Zhong is the Tian Xia deity of magic and healing, and he's going to be very helpful for all your exploration needs. You'll also find upgraded blessings of the Master of Masters, the Seventh Veil, and the All-Seeing Eye.</p> 
               <p>I hope you'll find this deck truly magical! Next month we're going to show off one of the craziest characters we've ever made, along with an impressive array of boons, in <a href="/products/btpy9wmw?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue-AddOn-Deck"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Convention planning involves lots of juggling, starting with what scenarios to offer. As an organizer, you want to schedule games players can participate in. The need for schedule juggling amplifies when we look at the Paizo-sponsored conventions—PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con. For those, we need several spotlight events, new scenarios, and a balance of the current season's offerings. At one of the organized team meetings a few months back, we decorated a white board with products releasing by August 2018 and started shuffling things around.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Convention planning involves lots of juggling, starting with what scenarios to offer. As an organizer, you want to schedule games players can participate in. The need for schedule juggling amplifies when we look at the Paizo-sponsored conventions—PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con. For those, we need several spotlight events, new scenarios, and a balance of the current season's offerings. At one of the organized team meetings a few months back, we decorated a white board with products releasing by August 2018 and started shuffling things around.</p> 
               <p>One of our top considerations is what the season meta-plot looks like and making sure we have coherent story paths. For Year of the Serpent, we included all the meta-plot scenarios at both PaizoCon and Gen Con. For Year of the Stolen Storm, we tried to make sure we had a variety of elemental scenarios together so that con attendees could see each of the elemental planes. This year, for Year of the Faction, there wasn't an overarching meta-plot outside of the factions helping the Pathfinder Society, and there weren't multi-scenario arcs in the vein of <a href="/products/btpy9ret?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-818-Champions-Chalice-Part-1-Blazing-Dangerous-Trails"><em>#8-18: Champion's Chalice Part 1</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9s14?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-821-Champions-Chalice-Part-2-Agents-of-the-Eye"><em>#8-21: Champion's Chalice Part 2</em></a>. So we looked at each factions' story arc and tried scheduling them together.</p> 
               <p>For PaizoCon, we offered the newest scenarios, including previews of <a href="/products/btpy9zk4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-20-Fury-of-the-Final-Blade"><em>#9-20: Fury of the Final Blade</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9zk5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-21-In-the-Grandmaster-s-Name"><em>#9-21: In the Grandmaster's Name</em></a>. I'm especially excited to see the reaction to the latter, as Grandmaster Torch's name elicits such varied responses from our playerbase. Plus, the premier of the third installment of our modular special on Sunday night! 50 tables running the same event—<em>#8-99C: The Solstice Scar—Version C</em>! Come see what has befallen Medda and crew in the past year!</p> 
               <p>Speaking of premiers—join GMs John Compton, Linda Zayas-Palmer, Lyz Liddell, Leo Glass, and Chris Sims as they preview the first of the Pathfinder Society Playtest Adventures—<em>#1 Rose Street Revenge</em>. These are lottery events using pregenerated 1st level characters. Look for them in the catalog when it goes live. A small teaser from the soon to be product page:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>Less than a year has passed since the Fiendflesh Siege, in which Absalom fended off an invading coalition of demonflesh constructs and the living dead. The siege lord offered freedom to any slave in Absalom willing to aid in the city's defense, and since that grand manumission, the city's slave trade has practically disappeared. The Pathfinder Society is one of many organizations that opened its doors to Absalom's newest citizens. However, several of the ex-slaves have been turning up dead, in other cases disappearing entirely. The Society doesn't often investigate serial killings, but one of its newest recruits is the latest victim. It's time for a band of Pathfinders to follow the clues, uncover these crimes, and end this threat.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>On the Starfinder side, we have most of the recent catalog and previews of <a href="/products/btpy9zjx?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-14-Star-Sugar-Heartlove"><em>#1-14: Star Sugar Heartlove!!!</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9zjy?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-15-Save-the-Renkrodas"><em>Save the Renkrodas</em></a>.

               <p>Besides scenarios running in the ballroom, there are many other special events featuring the organized play crew. There are panels on Starfinder Society, Pathfinder Society (with bonus Pathfinder Society Playtest information) and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. In addition, the 10,000 Lakes Gaming Crew (those Minnesota people!) have sponsored an afternoon's worth of games. If you wish to add a game to the schedule, <a href="/paizocon/eventSubmission">follow this link</a> for more information.</p> 
               <p>Interested but haven't gotten your tickets? Here's a handy link to the <a href="/paizocon">main PaizoCon 2018 page</a> for all your ticketing and informational needs.</p> 
               <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2> 
               <p>GMs should have received their PaizoCon schedules last week. There are a few GMs that are "waitlisted" pending schedule acceptance. We had more volunteers than scheduled games. This is mixed result, as I hate to turn volunteers away, but I'm pleased we won't have empty tables.</p> 
               <p>Gen Con is a different matter. <b>We still need volunteers!</b> While we filled the demo team and XX, there is still room to run Pathfinder Society Playtest Adventures, Starfinder Society fare, or Pathfinder Society Year of Factions' Favor and the soon to be announced next season! Volunteers receive benefits based on how many blocks they contribute. Rewards include 4-day badges, ¼ hotel rooms in the downtown Westin, credit to paizo.com, a copy of a Paizo print product (choices include <a href="/pathfinderplaytest"><em>Pathfinder Playtest Standard Hardcover Edition</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9x02?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures"><em>Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9xdl?Starfinder-Armory"><em>Starfinder RPG Armory</em></a>, or a bundle of 3<a href="/pathfinder/cardgame/expansions">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Add-On Decks</a>. Interested? <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkem?A-Call-to-Vol-IIGen-Con-2018">Check here for more information and to complete a volunteer questionnaire.</a></p> 
               <p>So I thought there would be room to cover Origins' offerings as well as PaizoCon, but looking at the length I think this blog is long enough. I'll save the Origins' information for another blog.</p> 
               <p>Tune in next week when we preview April's Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society scenarios.</p> 
               <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Spells are magical formulas with esoteric components, including words of power, gestures, and unusual ingredients, that when taken together create extraordinary magical effects. Spells have always been a crucial part of Pathfinder and the fantasy genre as a whole. But what's new about spells in the playtest? Let's take a look!</p> 
               <h2>Action!</h2> 
               <p>You cast spells by using some combination of the Verbal Casting, Somatic Casting, and Material Casting actions (the most common combination is Verbal and Somatic Casting actions for 2 total actions). Not every class interfaces with those actions in the same way. For instance, clerics can use a divine focus to satisfy the Material Casting action, sorcerers use their magical blood, and bards can use instruments that change up several aspects (for instance, even if you're gagged or otherwise unable to speak, you can play your violin to provide the Verbal Casting portion).</p> 
               <h2>Heightened Spells</h2> 
               <p>In the playtest, you'll be able to heighten your favorite spells in order to gain greater effects than ever before. Heightening a spell works much like it did previously, where you prepare a spell in a higher-level slot (or cast it using a higher-level slot if you're a spontaneous caster), except now all spellcasters can do it, and you gain much more interesting benefits. Want to fire 15 missiles with <i>magic missile</i> or turn into a Huge animal with <i>animal form</i>? Just heighten those spells to the appropriate level! There's no longer any need to learn long chains of spells that are incrementally different and each require you to refer back to the previous spell.</p> 
               <p>Incidentally, the idea of using a spell's level to determine its power has led to some really interesting interplay between spells. For example, how many times have you run into a situation where your high-level illusionist is foiled by a simple <i>detect magic</i> spell or a similar effect? Now, illusions of a higher spell level than a <i>detect magic</i> cantrip can foil detection! Similarly, <i>dispel magic</i> has a harder time dispelling spells of much higher spell levels, while it can crush lower-level spells with ease. This extends to many other similar interactions; while in Pathfinder First Edition, a creature with some basic spell effect that's constantly active might be flat-out immune to your character's spells, now you can heighten your spells and overcome that obstacle!</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180416-GnomeSpellcaster.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180416-GnomeSpellcaster_360.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <h2>Cantrips</h2> 
               <p>In the playtest, cantrips are spells you can cast at will, but they are no longer level 0. Instead, they automatically heighten to the highest spell level you can currently cast. That means if you're 5th level, your <i>ray of frost</i> is 3rd level and deals more damage, and your <i>light</i> cantrip is better at counteracting magical darkness.</p> 
               <h2>Domain Powers and Beyond</h2> 
               <p>Pathfinder has always had domain powers, school powers, bloodline powers, and other special class-based spell-like abilities that you can use a certain number of times per day rather than using your daily spell slots on them. In the playtest, we've expanded this idea, allowing even more classes to gain these kinds of powers and standardizing the way we talk about the powers and their daily uses. The powers are now treated as a special kind of spell, and they are all cast using Spell Points. There is power in naming something; while you don't really count them differently than if you had a pool of uses per day, this allowed us to create new and interesting abilities that cost multiple Spell Points or that you could add extra features to at the cost of more Spell Points, in a way that works across classes more smoothly.</p> 
               <h2>10th-Level Spells</h2> 
               <p>So what's the deal with 10th-level spells? Jason mentioned these all the way at the beginning, and many of you have given excellent guesses for what they will be. They start with a class of spells that used to be 9th level+, by which I mean, they were 9th level, but even for that level they were usually balanced by expensive material costs. Spells like wish and miracle. In the playtest, these spells are free to cast but are 10th level. Then we added some brand-new and amazing spells, like <i>fabricated truth</i> and <i>nature incarnate</i>. I'm guessing you guys will quickly figure out what these spells do, but here's a hint: one of them had a critical failure effect previewed in the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkod?Critical-Hits-and-Critical-Failures">Critical Hits and Critical Failures blog</a>!</p> 
               <h2>Rituals</h2> 
               <p>Ever since we introduced them in <em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em>, rituals have been a favorite both among fans and the adventure developers here at Paizo. If you haven't checked them out yet, they're story-rich spells with a long casting time that anyone skilled enough could conceivably try to perform as long as they have the hidden knowledge. Typically they involve some number of secondary casters, which can get the whole party involved or make a nice set-piece encounter with an evil cult.</p> 
               <p>Even in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>, there were spells that sort of followed that mold already—the 8th-level spell binding is a perfect example. In the playtest, these sorts of spells have been made into rituals. This means that these downtime spells don't take up your spell slots, and that martial characters who manage to attain a high enough proficiency rank in magic-related skills like Arcana can cast them! This is particularly great when, for instance, the cleric dies but the monk can perform a <i>resurrection</i> ritual. (Don't worry, there is still also the non-ritual spell <i>raise dead</i> in case you need someone back in action faster, though a group that wants death to be more uncertain can easily omit that spell for an instant shift in the tone of the campaign.) Rituals also have delightful potential failure effects. For instance, if you critically fail <i>planar binding</i>, you call something dark and horrible that isn't bound by your wards, and it immediately attempts to destroy you!</p> 
               <h2>Magical Traditions</h2> 
               <p>Magical traditions, such as arcane and divine, have always been a part of Pathfinder spells. But the playtest gives us an opportunity to really explore what they mean, what makes them different, and how they metaphysically interconnect in a way that enriches the game's story. Magic taps into various essences in the cosmos. For example, arcane magic blends material essence (the fundamental building blocks of all physical things) and mental essence (the building block of rational thoughts, logic, and memories). This means that arcane traditions share a lot in common with science, as arcane spellcasters tend to use logic and rational methods to categorize the magic inherent in the physical world around them. Divine magic is the exact opposite; it blends spiritual essence (the otherworldly building block of the immortal self) and vital essence (the universal life force that gives us instincts and intuition). This means that divine traditions are steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the Material Plane. These ideas have led to some exciting new additions of spells into each tradition's repertoire.</p> 
               <h2>Example Spells</h2> 
               <p>Let's put everything we've talked about into perspective by taking a look at a spell that can be heightened and that uses actions in an interesting way: <i>heal</i>. (By the way, notice the new spell school!)</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <div class="stat-block"> 
                 <p class="stat-block-title">Heal <span class="stat-block-cr">Spell 1</span></p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Healing, Necromancy, Positive</b><br> <b>Casting</b> Somatic Casting or more<br> <b>Range</b> touch, <b>Range</b> 30 feet, or <b>Area</b> 30-foot aura (see text); <b>Target</b> one willing living creature or one undead creature</p> 
                 <p>You channel positive energy to heal the living or damage the undead. You restore Hit Points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier to a willing living target, or deal that amount of positive damage to an undead target. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.</p> 
                 <ul>
                  <li><b>Somatic Casting</b> The spell has a range of touch. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to damage an undead target.</li> 
                  <li><b>Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting</b> The spell has a range of 30 feet and doesn't require a touch attack when targeting an undead creature. An undead target must attempt a Fortitude save, taking half damage on a success, no damage on a critical success, or double damage on a critical failure.</li> 
                  <li><b>Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting</b> You disperse positive energy in a 30-foot aura. This has the same effect as the two-action version of the spell, but it targets all living and undead creatures in the burst and reduces the amount of healing or damage to your spellcasting ability modifier.</li>
                 </ul> 
                 <p><b>Heightened (+1)</b> Increase the amount of healing or damage by 1d8, or by 2d8 if you're using the one- or two-action version to heal the living.</p> 
                </div> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>So you can cast <i>heal</i> with 1 action and restore quite a few Hit Points to a touched target, especially for a single action. This is particularly useful if you cast heal several times in one turn on someone who needs emergency assistance after a critical hit! For 2 actions, you can cast safely from the back lines, and for 3 actions, you can change the area to a burst and heal living creatures while harming undead at the same time. It restores fewer hit points to each target that way, but if you have multiple allies in need of healing, it can be really efficient. This one spell, using heightened effects, combines the effects of all the <i>cure wounds</i> spells in one place.</p> 
               <p>At the bottom of the stat block, you see what one type of heightened entry looks like. This one gets better proportionally for each spell level above 1st. So a 2nd-level <i>heal</i> spell heals one target for 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier, a 3rd-level one heals one target 5d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and so on.</p> 
               <p>But <i>heal</i> is a classic spell chain that you already knew and loved in Pathfinder First Edition and that has already been revealed in tidbits through podcasts. How about its big sister <i>regenerate</i>?</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <div class="stat-block"> 
                 <p class="stat-block-title">Regenerate <span class="stat-block-cr">Spell 7</span></p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Healing, Necromancy</b><br> <b>Casting</b> Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting<br> <b>Range</b> touch; <b>Target</b> one willing living creature<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 minute</p> 
                 <p>The target temporarily gains regeneration 15, which restores 15 Hit Points to it at the start of each of its turns. While it has regeneration, the target can't die from damage and its dying value can't exceed 3. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn.</p> 
                 <p>Each time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration, it also regrows one damaged or ruined organ (if any). During the spell's duration, the creature can also reattach severed body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body part to the stump.</p> 
                 <p><b>Heightened (9th)</b> The regeneration increases to 20.</p> 
                </div> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p><i>Regenerate</i> was always necessary to restore lost limbs or organs (a rare situation to come up in the game), but the way it worked made it fairly ineffective for use in combat. This version is much more attractive during a fight, particularly if your foe lacks access to acid and fire!</p> 
               <p>This spell doesn't increase in power incrementally as its level increases (except for being harder to dispel); instead, it has a specific heightened benefit at 9th level.</p> 
               <p>But what about something you've never seen before? Let's take a look at <i>vampiric exsanguination</i>!</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <div class="stat-block"> 
                 <p class="stat-block-title">Vampiric Exsanguination <span class="stat-block-cr">Spell 6</span></p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Death, Necromancy, Negative</b><br> <b>Casting</b> Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting<br> <b>Area</b> 30-foot cone</p> 
                 <p>You draw life force from creatures and send it into your outstretched arms. You deal 10d6 negative damage to all living creatures in the area. As long as at least one creature in the area takes damage, you also gain half that many temporary Hit Points. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.</p> 
                 <ul style="list-style: none;">
                  <li><b>Success</b> Half damage.</li> 
                  <li><b>Critical Success</b> No damage.</li> 
                  <li><b>Failure Full</b> damage.</li> 
                  <li><b>Critical Failure</b> Double damage.</li>
                 </ul> 
                 <p><b>Heightened (+2)</b> Increase the damage by 3d6.</p> 
                </div> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>So we're dealing some reasonable damage in a cone; <i>cone of cold</i> isn't going to be jealous. But the trick here is that if you can get at least one foe (or minion) to critically fail its save against the spell, you gain a huge number of temporary Hit Points! If you're a wizard with a Constitution score of 12, that hapless creature might just provide you nearly 50% more Hit Points (incidentally, if you deal a lot of damage, you could kill a minion who critically fails the save, so use it responsibly). And since you're drawing in life force, guess who gains access to this spell? (Urgathoans rejoice!)</p> 
               <h2>More New Spells</h2> 
               <p>I'm going to close out by giving just the names of a smattering of new spells. What might they do? I'll leave it up to you guys to see what you think! </p>

               <p itemprop="description">Now that we're done with previews of <a href="/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair"><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a>—which releases next week—I'm excited to announce the next Pathfinder Battles miniatures set from our partners at WizKids.</p> 
               <p>Currently scheduled for an October release, <a href="/products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker"><em>Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</em></a>, is the fifteenth set of prepainted plastic miniatures in the popular Pathfinder Battles line. Featuring 44 randomized figures in sizes ranging from Small to Large, and six pieces of dungeon dressing, <em>Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</em> exemplifies the commitment to quality sculpts and paint jobs, as well as variety and utility of figures, the line is known for.</p> 
               <p>As always, customers who order a case of <em>Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</em> boosters will also have the opportunity to purchase the set's <a href="/products/btpya12e?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker-Earth-Water-Elementals">case incentive</a>. This set's two-figure incentive features the earth and water elemental lords, completing the Huge elemental series we began last year in <a href="/products/btpy9u15?Pathfinder-Battles-Maze-of-Death-Case-Incentive"><em>Maze of Death</em></a> with the air and fire elemental lords.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180416-EarthElemental.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180416-EarthElemental_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180416-WaterElemental.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180416-WaterElemental_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>No Kingmaker set would be complete without some of the iconic allies and villains from the Kingmaker Adventure Path, such as the troll leader and Nyrissa, a Large uncommon and Medium rare figure, respectively.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180416-TrollLeader.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180416-TrollLeader_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180416-NymphLeader.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180416-NymphLeader_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>There are also a number of more generic tropes of the genre we're releasing for the first time, like the bat swarm, werewolf, and oni mage. These figures fill in some of the gaps from the <a href="/products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>, which many fans have requested we represent as thoroughly as possible in prepainted plastic. The bat swarm and werewolf are both Medium figures, at the common and uncommon rarities, respectively, while the oni mage is a Large uncommon figure.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>With the pending release of <a href="https://owlcatgames.com" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Kingmaker</em></a>, the first isometric, party-based computer RPG set in the Pathfinder fantasy universe (now in Beta for Kickstarter backers!), we also had the unique opportunity to provide miniatures of the many new characters being introduced in the game by the game's developers at Owlcat Games. These companions will join the player along their journey to conquer and rule the Stolen Lands, and can now join players in their tabletop games as well. Check out Regongar, half-orc magus, the first of these companions we're showing off. A Medium rare figure, Regongar also makes a great PC or enemy NPC with the lightning spell effect giving him unmatched gravitas on the battle mat.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>We're still a few months away from showing off the entire set, but keep coming back weekly for more Pathfinder (and Starfinder) miniature previews. Next week, we'll take a look at some of the figures in next wave of Deep Cuts unpainted plastic miniatures from WizKids. Until then, keep rolling 20s!</p>

               <p>You might also want to take a gander at the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkoy?Big-Beards-and-Pointy-Ears">Big Beards and Pointy Ears blog</a> to see how dwarves and elves work if you're a fan of ancestries that are entirely too tall and entirely too stuffy.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180413-Halfling.jpg"> 
                <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>
               </div> 
               <h2>Halflings</h2> 
               <p>Living among taller folk gives halflings a good bit of perspective and plenty of opportunities to make new friends—plenty of opportunities of all kinds, really. Keep your eyes open and your heart brave, and you can accomplish anything!</p> 
               <p>Both halflings and gnomes get 8 Hit Points from their respective ancestries, are Small, and have a speed of 20 feet. A halfling speaks Common and Halfling. Halflings have nimble fingers, giving them an ability boost to Dexterity, and are jovial, getting another ability boost in Charisma. They also get one free ability boost to put in any score. Now, there's nothing wrong with how you're made, but halflings do get an ability flaw to Strength. Seems like a better deal, though. Goblins are a bit stronger, but they're not so wise, and good sense is a good trade. (<a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkog?Goblins">You can read more about goblins here!</a>)</p> 
               <p>We've mentioned ability boosts and flaws a few times now, so let's go into more detail about how those work! At 1st level, your ability scores all start at 10. Your ancestry then gives you ability boosts, each of which increases the score by 2. Most ancestries get three ability boosts, two of which have to go into specific scores. The remaining free ability boost can go into any score except the two set ones. Most ancestries also get a flaw, which decreases a designated score by 2. You can put your free ability boost in the same score as your flaw if you want to get back to 10. In later parts of character creation, you'll get more ability boosts, which we'll cover in later blogs! (And if you want to roll your ability scores randomly, we have an option for that in the playtest so you can see how that might work, though we prefer for characters used in the playtest to be generated in the standard way.)</p> 
               <p>Now, where was I? Halflings, right!</p> 
               <p>At 1st level and as they level up, halflings can pick up halfling ancestry feats that take advantage of their size, their gumption, and their fabled luck. Distracting Shadows lets them sneak around by using larger creatures as cover. They might also pick up Plucky to overcome fear and other detriments to their emotions. They can take Titan Slinger to get a bonus to damage when using their slings against Large or larger creatures. This bonus increases on critical hits, even before being doubled! Additionally, the sling is now a more formidable weapon than in Pathfinder First Edition—we've both increased its damage and done away with the difference in damage die size between Small and Medium creatures. A halfling with a sling can be pretty dangerous!</p> 
               <p>One feat we know will be popular is Lucky Halfling, which lets you reroll one skill check or saving throw you fail or critically fail once each day. Rules in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> list traits that apply to feats, often indicating special rules. This one has the fortune trait, which appears on all sorts of things that involve rerolls and manipulating dice in your favor. You can benefit from fortune only once on a given roll, and misfortune can cancel it out.</p> 
               <p>As mentioned in the blog post about dwarves and elves, ancestry entries suggest some backgrounds you might choose that are common for those of your ancestry. Halflings are often entertainers, acrobats, or street urchins. Many come from hard lives as criminals or laborers.</p>

                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180413-Gnome.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180413-Gnome_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>
               </div> 
               <h2>Gnomes</h2> 
               <p>What's THAT?!</p> 
               <p>A gnome's life is a constant barrage of the curious, the compelling, the cacophonous, the colorful, and the chaotic. There's always something new to discover. There... kind of has to be. See, gnomes who don't take in enough novel experiences are stricken by the Bleaching—their colorful hair turns white as their minds fall into despair. So let's not do that. Let's explore!</p> 
               <p>Now, when you're exploring, it's good to be durable because who knows what you might encounter. It helps that gnomes are tough and charming, with ability boosts to Constitution and Charisma, plus their one free ability boost to any other score. Gnomes have a flaw in Strength. Who needs it? Magic's better. And alchemical bombs. Those look fun. Gnomes can speak Common, Gnome, and Sylvan, but might want to study up on some other languages too. They can also see in low light—all the better for exploring into the dusk.</p> 
               <p>Gnomes came from the First World, the realm of the fey, long ago. Their ancestry feats can reflect this, like Fey Fellowship, which makes a gnome more charismatic when dealing with fey, or First World Magic, which gives the gnome a cantrip spell chosen from a wide number of options (including <i>dancing lights</i>, <i>prestidigitation</i>, and <i>tanglefoot</i>, to name a few).</p> 
               <p>Discerning Smell lets a gnome truly appreciate peculiar food and drink, or sniff out that invisible orc who's caked in the clay from a particular mountain pass, hasn't bathed in roughly 8 years, and recently ate a live bird. (A swallow, fittingly.) And, of course, you can choose Animal Speaker so you can talk to all your favorite burrowing animals!</p> 
               <p>A gnome's younger years will no doubt be weird, so they could have any kind of background—even a path they abandoned early on. A gnome might be an entertainer, a merchant, a nomad, an animal whisperer, a barkeep, or a farmhand.</p> 
               <p>How do these two ancestries stack up? (About 6 feet high, I'd say.) What sort of halfling or gnome characters do you look forward to playing?</p>

               <p>Welcome, then, to Nidal.</p> 
               <p>In <a href="/products/btpya0fg?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Nidal-Land-of-Shadows"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Nidal, Land of Shadows</em></a>, we draw back the curtain for the first time on this theocracy dedicated to Zon-Kuthon, god of darkness and pain.</p> 
               <p>The book includes a stunningly detailed look into Nidalese history and daily life, both in the nation's oppressive cities and in rural villages, where keeping the appearance of absolute dedication to the Kuthite religion is a matter of life and death. This book also reveals new details about how, 10,000 years ago, Nidal's leaders made the pact that placed the nation in eternal servitude to the evil Midnight Lord. A gazetteer of the entire land, detailed threats in the gloom, and a shudder-inducing bestiary round out this book's offerings.</p> 
               <p>There's a lot to be proud of in this book, and foremost on that list for me are the absolutely stellar authors on this project.</p> 
               <p>I'm so pleased to say that all of the lore and gazetteer information in <em>Nidal, Land of Shadows</em> was written by Liane Merciel, the author who brought you the incredible novels <a href="/products/btpy8sa9?Pathfinder-Tales-Nightglass"><em>Nightglass</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy99k6?Pathfinder-Tales-Nightblade"><em>Nightblade</em></a>. Those novels provided bone-chilling glimpses into the stark wickedness of Kuthite life, and Liane did an incredible job building those details into a rich, nuanced, and horrific world for Game Masters and players to explore. Some of the most memorable creatures and set pieces from the novels—Joyful Things, anyone?—are now fully integrated into the Pathfinder RPG.</p> 
               <p>Continuing the list of first-rate authors, the book's foreboding adventure sites were written by none other than Lyz Liddell, a Paizo editor who is as conscientious and thoughtful a writer as she is incisive and affecting. Lyz did a great job creating and expanding locations that range from an underground hub of Desnan resistance to a stronghold of rogue kytons to a certain tower where a tapestry of living flesh is not the most horrifying thing inside.</p> 
               <p>In the book's bestiary, our author list continues to shine. For this stark task, we pulled on board Ron Lundeen and Mark Moreland, two of Paizo's own developers. Mark's work, in truly fine form, includes the monster write-up for the Joyful Thing mentioned above, and I think it turned out spectacularly creepy and atmospheric. Additionally, I'm so pleased to say that Ron, whose new monsters in this book include a gristly new kyton, joined our team in the office shortly after completing this assignment—one of many reasons why this book is quite special.</p> 
               <p>There's so much to say about <a href="/products/btpya0fg?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Nidal-Land-of-Shadows"><em>Nidal, Land of Shadows</em></a> that I'm going to leave further discussion of it for another blog. For now, take a look at this beautiful opening piece from the second chapter!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">As I write this blog, we're on the road to soon release our <a href="/products/btpy9zjv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-12-Ashes-of-Discovery">twelfth</a> and <a href="/products/btpy9y4m?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-111-In-Pursuit-of-the-Scoured-Past">thirteenth</a> scenarios, which is a pretty great milestone! One thing I've certainly noticed over the course of the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild's development is a wide array of opinions and thoughts with regards to the tier structure for the campaign. I wanted to take some time to discuss some of our internal thoughts on this, and what players can expect to see going forward.</p> 
               <p>First off, let me address sanctioning. Everyone loves to see Adventure Path sanctioned right away, and I'm proud to say that we've had a pretty good track record with sanctioning the <a href="/store/starfinder/adventurePath/deadSuns">Dead Suns Adventure Path</a>. So far, the first three adventures are sanctioned. We hit a bit of a snag with the fourth adventure, namely because of convention season creeping up and requiring a lot of attention—seriously, who'd think that an interactive special and three months of early releases for scenarios would take so much effort?! I hope to look at sanctioning for <a href="/products/btpy9zkj?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Ruined-Clouds"><em>The Ruined Clouds</em></a> in the coming weeks, but I want players to know that this project has not been forgotten. Now, with that being said, the fourth Dead Suns installment is intended for characters of 7th to 8th level, which currently represents some of the highest-level characters in the campaign. How about we talk about that...</p> 
               <p>Taking a trip in the "way back when machine", the Organized Play team had a series of meetings to discuss the new Tier structure for the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. The idea to condense tiers came from an early brainstorming session sparked by fellow developer, Linda Zayas-Palmer. This led to some future meetings where Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton and I sat down to create a sort of road map for our first season. We've stuck to the roadmap since the campaign started, making necessary adjustments for our change to two scenarios per month, and it's worked out very well. I don't want to spoil all of our upcoming scenario plans, but I do want to give some highlights for things that players and event organizers can expect to see over the coming months. </p>
               <p>Following the convention season (post-August), we're going to stick with our general scheme of including more Tier 1-4 content. Expect most months to include a Tier 1-4, with a secondary higher tier scenario filling up the secondary slot.</p> 
               <p>We remain committed to higher level content, but don't expect to see a new Tier 5-8 every month. We'll be looking to mix up some of our release with a regular offering of Tier 3-6 and some Tier 5-8s.</p> 
               <p>For the most dedicated players, August looks to be an appropriate time to start up a new character. With <a href="/products/btpy9y25?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Reach-of-Empire"><em>Starfinder Adventure Path: The Reach of Empire</em></a> debuting that month, alongside our other recently announced Starfinder Society scenarios, the future is ripe for new character opportunities.</p> 
               <p>Faction missions remain something we'll be interspersing throughout our future scenarios. Expect a slight step-back from Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo) missions for a bit. There will be more content on that front, but expect a future blog post to further discuss that topic.</p> 
               <p>Finally, expect to see the campaign start looking towards more high-level opportunities closer to the end of 2019!</p> 
               <p>Alrighty, those are some of my words of wisdom for our upcoming scenario plans. As always, I love hearing feedback from the community, so please feel free to put any requests or thoughts into the comments below. I know there's a wide variety of play styles, so be respectful of other players when discussing the topic of level ranges for new scenarios. Beyond that, it's time for me to jump back into convention season development!</p>

                <p>"Hello! I'm Michael Sayre, the newest member of the organized play team. My work with Pathfinder includes designing and developing products for several third-party publishers, including Amora Games, Dreamscarred Press, Drop Dead Studios, and Rogue Genius Games, as well as doing editing work for the Wayfinder fanzine. Since joining the team I've been tackling sanctioning on some of the more recent adventure paths and doing development on several scenarios, starting with the recently released #9–16: Fallen Family, Broken Name. It's been an exciting (and busy!) run so far and I'm looking forward to continuing to help the OP team produce and sanction great new content for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game."</p>

               <h2>Pathfinder Society GM Stars</h2> 
               <p>A cornerstone of the Pathfinder Society is the Game Masters who To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you devote to running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>

               <p>Congratulations! Once again, thank you for spending hours running games for your community!</p> 
               <h2>Conventions</h2> 
               <p>Convention season started in earnest on 1 March, when the number of requests for event support doubled. Which is wonderful news for our gaming community, as there are even more places to play Pathfinder and Starfinder Society! We encourage you to check out the list and see if any conventions appeal to you. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information! If you know of a convention running Society games that is not on this list, encourage the organizer to contact me at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss their event.</p>

               <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2> 
               <p>We still need volunteers for Gen Con 2018! If you want the chance to run Pathfinder Society Playtest adventures, see the launch of Pathfinder Society Season Ten, or experience the Starfinder Society interactive scenario in a room with 1,154 other people, this is the convention for you. <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkem?A-Call-to-Vol-IIGen-Con-2018">Follow this link</a> for more information on how to volunteer.</p> 
               <p>PaizoCon schedules are going out tomorrow. Check your email if you filled in the questionnaire!</p> 
               <h2>2018 Organized Play Staff Travel</h2> 
               <p>With the addition of Michael to the team and the announcement of Pathfinder Playtest/Pathfinder 2nd edition, I've updated the staff travel roster to reflect where you can find Paizo staff and potentially a playtest opportunity (or two!).</p> 
               <p>If you are an event organizer and want to invite us out at your event in 2019, drop an email to organizedplay@paizo.com before next summer. We review our schedule in the fall and try to get all decisions wrapped by the end of the year.</p>

               <p>So far we've previewed the fighter and the rogue. You might have thought we'd showcase one of the original spellcasting classes next, but that involves talking a bit more about spellcasting, so instead, we decided to unleash the secrets of the alchemist in our newest preview of the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i>.</p> 
               <p>In the early days of Pathfinder First Edition, the alchemist saw release in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i>. Since then, the alchemist has proven to be very popular. Unsurprisingly, when we surveyed the player base about what classes see the most play, the alchemist rose right to the top (along with the oracle, but more on that in a later preview). That alone would have promoted the class into the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i>, but tackling the alchemist early on during the design process was beneficial for another reason: it allowed us to take a hard look at alchemical item design with the alchemist in mind rather than as a later add-on.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">

               </div> 
               <h2>Alchemist Features</h2> 
               <p>While anyone trained in Crafting can take the Alchemical Crafter skill feat and craft their own alchemical items, the alchemist is much better at this crafting discipline. At 1st level, he gains Alchemical Crafter and a formula book for free, along with four bonus alchemical item formulas (for a total of eight, including the four from Alchemical Crafter). Each time he levels up, he gains two more formulas. This is on top of ones he either discovers or invents. Not only does he gain more access to alchemical tricks, by way of advanced alchemy and the quick alchemy action, but he can also spend resonance to create alchemical objects on the fly, though such hasty concoctions are potent for only a short period.</p> 
               <p>Crafting is all well and good, but what about bombing potential? The alchemist's bombs are now the basic alchemical items you are familiar with: things like alchemist fire, thunderstones, acid flasks and so on. He crafts these items and lobs them. At 3rd level, he gains the empower bomb feature, which allows him to multiply the damage of the bombs he creates. This multiplier increases with level until it reaches six times the alchemical bomb's base damage at 19th level.</p> 
               <p>But that's only the start—at 5th level the alchemist learns the secrets of mutagens, and as he progresses his ability to craft alchemical items on the fly becomes both greater and faster.</p> 
               <h2>Alchemist Feats</h2> 
               <p>Tying these features together is the selection of alchemist class feats. As with other class feats, they allow the alchemist to either focus or diversify his features and talents. In the case of the alchemist, class feats come in a few broad categories. If the alchemist wants to make the most of his crafting, he might choose Efficient Alchemy or Enduring Alchemy at 4th level. The former allows him to craft larger batches of alchemical items during downtime, while the latter extends the amount of time he can use alchemical items that he creates with the Quick Alchemy action. When he reaches 6th level, Powerful Alchemy allows him to increase the DCs of his alchemical effects, while the 18th-level Improbable Elixirs feat enables him to craft elixirs with the effects of magical potions.</p> 
               <p>Making stuff is great, but destruction is much more fun. Most alchemical bombs are splash weapons, which means that when the alchemist hits an enemy, those nearby take a bit of damage. At 4th level, an alchemist with the Calculated Splash feat can deal splash damage equal to his Intelligence modifier instead of the normal 1 splash damage. At 6th level, the alchemist can take the Precise Bomb feat, allowing him to hit everyone but his allies with the splash damage. Taking both feats increases the hurt he puts on enemies while saving his allies the pain. Of course, there are also plenty of feats that affect the primary target of a bomb. Debilitating Bomb at 6th level and its greater counterparts at 10th and 14th levels allow the alchemist to apply different types of conditions to the primary target of his bombs.</p> 
               <p>After an alchemist gains the mutagen crafting feature, he can take feats that modify how those powerful elixirs interact with his internal chemistry. For instance, the 8th-level Feral Mutagen feat boosts the alchemist's Intimidate checks and morphs his teeth into frightful jaws and his hands into rending claws. Other such modifications are subtler. The 10th-level Stalker Mutagen feat grants the alchemist Stealth as a signature skill and allows him to move up to his Speed when he sneaks. While all mutagens grant some bonuses and drawbacks, the Perfect Mutagen feat at 18th level allows the alchemist to ignore the drawbacks when under the effect of a mutagen he crafted.</p> 
               <p>All of this is only a small sample of what the class has to offer. The alchemist is also a master of poisons (which he can craft for free each day just like other alchemical items), has easy access to a number of skills, and can act as the party's trap disabler or healer if necessary. The diversity in the class allows you to pick and choose exactly how you want to manifest your particular brand of alchemical discoveries.</p>

Let me refresh your memory.</p> 
               <p>In the Mwangi Jungle, the greatest force of evil is the gorilla king, Ruthazek (he got his own mini in the <a href="/products/btpy92k5?Pathfinder-Battles-Legends-of-Golarion-The-Gorilla-King"><em>Legends of Golarion</em></a> set). From his throne in Usaro, the Gorilla King rules a nation of demon-worshiping apes and charau-ka, which he sends to torment the peaceful people of the Mwangi Expanse. Leading these armies are mighty, four-armed apes with distinctive white fur, represented here as the thrall of Angazhan. A Large, uncommon figure, the thrall of Angazhan is the final figure eagle-eyed fans might have seen on the box art.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180409-ThrallOfAngazhan.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180409-ThrallOfAngazhan_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Aiding us in this battle against the ultimate evil were two forces of goodness, one from a distant corner of Golarion, and the other from blessed Elysium. The latter, the noble azata knight, makes it her mission to hunt fiends, evil dragons, and undead with equal vigor. It is thus no surprise that she graced us with her presence, though I'd describe that as a Medium rare occurance.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180409-AzataKnight.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180409-AzataKnight_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Finally, from the distant continent of Tian Xia far to the east (and west, I guess, if you go the long way around), is the graceful kirin. This Large rare figure is right at home in the jungle, especially the air above the kaiju-filled Valashmai Jungle, but can oppose the schemes of evil spirits like hags and oni in any environment. Though rare, some kirin have even served as the flying mounts of particularly worthy cavaliers, paladins, or samurai.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>With the aid of both azata and kirin, we overcame all adversity, and ensured the forces of Angazhan did not spread beyond their accursed, ruined jungle citadel. We have vanquished the despair from the jungle! Sort of.</p> 
               <p>Just because I've now revealed the entire set, that doesn't mean the adventure has to end here. Check back next week for more discussion of our miniature offerings. Whatever could we be exploring next?</p>

               <h2>Dwarves</h2> 
               <p>Adventuring is for the stout-hearted. Be stable. Be dependable. Be a dwarf! These fine folk live in isolated citadels, their surface empire having fallen long ago, but from time to time they venture out into the world of adventure.</p> 
               <p>As a dwarf, you get three ability boosts: one to Constitution, one to Wisdom, and one to the score of your choice. You take an ability flaw to Charisma, though your clan mother says you're quite charming. You get 10 Hit Points from your ancestry—more than the other ancestries and MUCH more than the elves! Your speed is 20 feet, perfectly adequate for adventuring, and you can ignore the speed reduction from your armor. You speak Common and Dwarf, as you may expect, and you can see in the dark just fine.</p> 
               <p>All that represents what's common to all dwarves, and comes from their innate tendencies. Ancestry feats go farther, reflecting mostly the cultural propensities of the ancestry. For example, you likely grew up among your dwarven kin, training with the weapons of the Weapon Familiarity feat. Battleaxes, picks, warhammers... those are good, dependable weapons. And let's not forget the special weapons with the dwarf trait, like the dwarven waraxe or your beloved clan dagger (forged for you at birth and capped with a gemstone sacred to your clan). Your training might have included the best ways to battle creatures like derros, duergar, giants, or orcs. In that case, you might pick up the Ancestral Hatred feat to give you a bonus on damage against these enemies—a bonus that goes up for 1 minute if one of those wretched creatures critically hits you!</p> 
               <p>Now, this isn't to say ancestry feats deal exclusively with your upbringing. Heritage feats are a special type of ancestry feat that reflect special physiological traits of your ancestry. Because they're inborn, you can select them only at 1st level. Hardy is one of these, letting you resist poisons and recover from them more quickly. (This kept Ron Lundeen's dwarven barbarian up during a recent playtest—even though he was still pretty sick, he didn't take any damage during all those rounds he spent retching after getting exposed to a poison!)</p> 
               <p>Because each ancestry entry is your starting point, it also gives you some ideas for how you might build or advance your character. For instance, the dwarf suggests backgrounds suitable for many sorts of dwarves (acolyte, nomad, or warrior) or for those who specifically follow a traditional dwarven way of life (barkeep, blacksmith, farmhand, and merchant).</p> 
               <h2>Elves</h2> 
               <p>An elf can live up to 600 years, an amount of time fit for appreciating the beauty of the natural world, of elegant arts, and of refined magic. Demons may haunt ancient elven lands, but you have plenty of time to plan their demise.</p> 
               <p>Elves' grace gives them an ability boost to Dexterity, and their years of study give them one to Intelligence. Their third ability boost can represent the other score they developed over the years. Their physical frailty is represented by their ability flaw in Constitution, as well as their low racial hit points of 6. They speak the Common and Elf languages, and are likely to have an Intelligence high enough to select a third language. Elves can see in dim light, and have the highest speed of all the ancestries at 30 feet. (Going to three actions per round brought the other ancestries that were as fast as elves in Pathfinder First Edition down to 25 feet from 30.)</p> 
               <p>Elves' ancestry feats can help them fight demons, teach them arcane cantrips, or make their hearing better with the Keen Hearing heritage feat. Elves can pick up many things in their long lives, and the Ancestral Longevity feat reflects how some of their life experiences might fade from the forefront of their memory until they focus on them. This feat allows your elf to become trained in a skill of your choice when she prepares for each day. If elves' 30-foot speed isn't enough for you, you can even take the Nimble feat, which increases your speed by 5 feet and lets you ignore a square of difficult terrain during each stride action you take.</p> 
               <p>Good background options for elves include hunter for those raised in the wild; noble or scholar for more cosmopolitan elves; and acrobat, entertainer, or scout for an elf with a more adventurous bent. Elves make good rangers or rogues, and those who wish to study spells can pursue the path of the wizard.</p> 
               <p>So which do you think has it better? Elves or dwarves? We'll let you think about that and see you again here on Monday, when we talk about another class elves' Intelligence points toward: the alchemist!</p>

               <p>Before we get into this week's blog, we have a couple of things we want to share with you!</p>

               <p>Next, let's spill the beans on this year's Free RPG Day promo character, Nok-Nok:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter" style="padding: 15px;">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180405-NokNok.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180405-NokNok_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p style="clear: both;">Nok-Nok comes to us from <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>, the party-based, single-player, isometric computer RPG coming this summer from <a href="http://owlcatgames.com" target="_blank">Owlcat Games</a>! (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mP0AxgTZEA" target="_blank">Don't miss their new trailer here!</a>)</p> 
               <p>Nok-Nok's PACG incarnation will initially be available for free at stores participating in <a href="http://freerpgday.com" target="_blank">Free RPG Day</a> on June 16. We will then send him free to <a href="/products/btpy8x6n?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Subscription">subscribers of the main Pathfinder Adventure Card Game line</a> alongside the <a href="/products/btpy9xdn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness-AddOn-Deck"><em>Ultimate Wilderness Add-On Deck</em></a> in July. After that, he'll be available for sale on paizo.com and at our Gen Con booth in August.</p> 
               <p>Now, I'll cede the floor to Tyler <a href="/people/cartmanbeck">"Cartmanbeck" Beck</a>, our new Venture-Captain for Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild Online Play!</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b>Tyler</b>: <span itemprop="description">It's hard to believe that the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game was released almost five years ago now. The game has evolved through four full base sets and dozens of character and add-on decks, and has been the focus of a successful organized play campaign.</span></p> 
                <p>Speaking of that organized play campaign, in the recent 5.0 release of the <a href="/products/btpy98no?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-Guide"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild Guide</em></a>, the option was added for online play. I know a few people have been asking things like "What?" and "How?" and "Really?" Thus far, the answer to all of those questions has been "Let's take it slow." So to that end, the Card Guild has become a (relatively small) part of the <a href="/threads/rzs2ut7s?Announcing-OutPost-I-Back-to-the-Future">OutPost play-by-post gaming convention</a>, currently being held right here on the Paizo forums. We've currently got 11 tables running currently, with several box runners (BRs) each running one or more tables of PACG newbies and veterans alike. I'd like to introduce you to two BRs who will tell you a bit about how things work.</p> 
                <p><b>Ray (<a href="/people/redeux">redeux</a> on the forums)</b>: Most of my experiences so far have been as a player at one of the play-by-post tables. It's been a blast! Five of us has been working through <a href="/store/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season2">Season of the Runelords</a>, and over the course of several months we've progressed all the way to tier 5. I'm fortunate enough to also have a local group that gets together for organized play, but what I like about the online play-by-post is that it can be done from anywhere, and it takes much less time out of my day spread throughout a week rather than all in one afternoon. In that regard, it has been super convenient to get a little dose of PACG on a regular basis without straining my schedule. The format also makes it easy to back to look back and check what happened, like that time <a href="/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=25#1219">Kyra unleashed a fire attack with her sword, making sure her fire-loving goblin teammate Reta was nowhere in sight so she wouldn't get any heated ideas</a>.</p> 
                <p>With the OutPost event, we have been working hard to expose more people to the play-by-post format for PACG. I'm currently running two tables for the event, and I have players from the US, UK, Asia, and Australia, which shows that the game can be played globally. Some of my players are fairly experienced with the ACG, other players have a lot of experience with the RPG but little ACG, and a few started with little to no experience with either. We all work together to help everyone learn and overcome the scenarios!</p> 
                <p>Let's tackle how it all works. As Tyler mentioned, one person runs the box. This is currently is being handled through a database that contains the card information for each scenario. The database is able to build locations, shuffle them, move cards around, and manage just about anything you need to do during a normal ACG scenario. The scenario is then posted on the campaign page, looking <a href="/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=5#219">something like this</a>:</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180405-Screenshot1.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180405-Screenshot1_500.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>The scenario post has all of the "During this Adventure" and "During this Scenario" text in it, as well as turn info, blessing deck info, and location/location deck info. All of the cards in the location decks are hidden through spoilers. This allows players to explore multiple times in their turn without waiting for a new card to be presented to them.</p> 
                <p>Players use a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12e_Cu06pPyIGrsIurW4K3JAYLzxGl4As0DgD92eHpPA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Deck Handler spreadsheet on Google Docs that handles drawing cards from your deck, discarding, recharging, burying, shuffling, etc. (Tyler provides some instruction on how to use it </a><a href="/threads/rzs2utd5?Ever-wanted-to-play-PACG-over-playbypost#30">here</a>. The Deck Handler includes only card names, so you still need to have a physical deck to reference the card text. It provides an easy way to let everyone know what cards you have in hand, and what blessings or other cards you are willing to let people use on their turns. When you finish your turn, it gives you templated text to paste into the forum to communicate your decisions.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180405-Screenshot2.jpg">
                </div> 
                <p><b>Mark (<a href="/people/MorkXII">MorkXII</a> on the forums)</b>: During last year's online runthrough of the Cosmic Captive PFS Special, I was able to join <a href="/campaigns/PathfinderACG800CosmicCaptiveTable1TIER13">one</a> of <a href="/campaigns/PathfinderACG800CosmicCaptiveTable2TIER13">two</a> ACG tables run during the event and had an amazing time, and I couldn't wait to do it again. When I missed the chance to play in a <a href="/campaigns/ADVENTURECARDGUILDSeason2B1WeBeGoblins/gameplay&amp;page=1">Season of the Goblins game&gt; that Tyler started in November, I asked him if I could run my own table. He agreed, so I recruited four players (and a fifth joined later) to play through </a><a href="/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=1">Season of the Runelords</a>. That campaign is still going: the group has finished 23 scenarios in roughly 100 days, and we're on track to finish the entire Adventure Path by the end of OutPost on April 30.</p> 
                <p>Playing the ACG by forum post is obviously not the same as playing in-person: the pace is much slower, and sometimes it's tricky to collaborate on group efforts, such as who's handling temporary closes and multi-check encounters, and who's supplying all the blessings. Some rules and scenarios are a little tougher to implement for forum play and take an extra bit of effort or creative thinking (I'm looking at you, <a href="/products/btpy9m9j?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-23-Into-the-Mountain">Adventure #2-3C</a>!). But overall the game still works well in this format, and the slower pace also means you spend more time getting to know the group than you would around a table. Early in our Season of the Runelords game, we moved most of our game discussion to a Google Hangouts chat to allow for more real-time discussion. This made it easier to plan out those group efforts, but also enabled more off-topic and personal discussion, and it's been wonderful getting to know some other Pathfinder fans from around the world.</p> 
                <p>The slower pace of play also means that everyone has more time to take their turns, and many players put in effort to go beyond just listing what cards they encounter and play. The roleplaying and storytelling are my favourite part of playing a game online because it's so entertaining to read! When Reta <a href="/campaigns/ACGOutPostIMorkXIIsSeasonOfTheGoblins/gameplay#28">fell into a giant pit</a> and dragged all her goblin friends along with her, it made for a series of very fun posts. And a different Reta seemed very pleased with herself when she <a href="/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=30#1463">clubbed the villain over the head with a Lamia henchman</a>. (At least she didn't offer anyone any of her... <a href="/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=16#761">questionable</a> <a href="/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=30#1499">pickles</a> that time).</p> 
                <p>And playing online, you still get the same exciting moments that you always get from Pathfinder. Who doesn't love <a hrf="/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=5#225">clearing out an entire location deck in a single turn</a>? Or <a href="/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=10#465">blasting away the villain on a last-ditch effort</a> with just one blessing left in the deck?</p> 
                <p><b>Tyler</b>: We have a vibrant community of players on the Paizo play-by-post forums, and I'm excited that we've been able to add Pathfinder Adventure Card Game play to that community. As OutPost winds down at month end, watch for new developments on the forums and more ways to play PACG in play-by-post form yourselves!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Ever since the goblin song from page 12 of 2007's <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #1: Burnt Offerings</em>, goblins have been a key part of what makes Pathfinder recognizable as Pathfinder. When we first started looking at what would become the ancestries in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em>, we knew that we wanted to add something to the mix, to broaden the horizon of what it meant to be a hero in Pathfinder. That naturally brought us to goblins.</p> 
               <p>The trick was finding a way to let you play a goblin who has the feel of a Pathfinder goblin, but who is also a little bit softer around the edges—a character who has a reason to work with a group of "longshanks," as opposed to trying to light them on fire at the first opportunity. Let's look at an excerpt from the goblin ancestry to find out a bit more.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180402-Goblin.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180402-Goblin_360.jpeg"></a>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>As a people, goblins have spent millennia feared, maligned, and even hunted—and sometimes for understandable reasons, as some rural goblin tribes still often direct cruelty, raiding, and mayhem toward wandering or vulnerable creatures. In recent decades, however, a new sort of hero has emerged from among these rough-and-tumble tribes. Such goblins bear the same oversized heads, pointed ears, red eyes, and jagged teeth of their crueler kin, but they have a noble or savvy streak that other goblins can't even imagine, let alone understand. These erstwhile heroes roam Golarion, often maintaining their distinctive cultural habits while spreading the enthusiasm, inscrutable quirkiness, love of puns and song, and unique mirth that mark goblin adventurers.</p> 
                <p>Despite breaking from their destructive past, goblin adventurers often subtly perpetuate some of the qualities that have been characteristics of the creatures for millennia. They tend to flock to strong leaders, and fiercely protect those companions who have protected them from physical harm or who offer a sympathetic ear and sage advice when they learn of the goblins' woes. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire, or fearlessly devour meals that might turn others' stomachs. Others are inveterate tinkerers and view their companions' trash as components of gadgets yet to be made. Occasionally, fellow adventurers find these proclivities unsettling or odd, but more often than not goblins' friends consider these qualities endearing.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>The entry in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> has plenty more to say on the topic, but that should give you a sense of where we are taking Pathfinder's favorite troublemakers.</p> 
               <p>In addition to the story behind the goblin, its ancestry entry has a lot of other information as well to help you make a goblin player character. It includes the base goblin ability boosts (Dexterity and Charisma), ability flaw (Wisdom), bonus Hit Points (6), base speed (25 feet), and starting languages (Common and Goblin), as well as the rules for darkvision (an ability that lets goblins see in the dark just as well as they can see in normal light). Those are just the basics—the rules shared by all goblins. Beyond that, your goblin's unique ancestry allows you to choose one ability score other than Dexterity or Charisma to receive a boost. Perhaps you have some hobgoblin blood and have an additional boost to Constitution, or you descend from a long line of goblin alchemists and have a boost to Intelligence. You could even gain a boost in Wisdom to negate your flaw!</p> 
               <p>Then you get into the goblin ancestry feats, which allow you to decide what type of goblin you want to play. Starting off, let's look at Burn It. This feat gives you a bonus to damage whenever you cast a fire spell or deal fire damage with an alchemical item. On top of that, it also increases any persistent fire damage you deal by 1. Goblins still love watching things burn.</p> 
               <p>Next up is one of my favorites, Junk Tinkerer. A goblin with this feat can craft ordinary items and weapons out of junk and scrap they can find almost anywhere. Sure, the items are of poor quality and break easily, but you will never be without a weapon if you have this feat.</p> 
               <p>We could not have goblins in the game without adding the Razor Teeth feat. This grants you an attack with your mouthful of razor-sharp teeth that deals 1d6 piercing damage. To be honest, the target of your attack should probably also attempt a Fortitude save against whatever you ate last night that is still stuck between your teeth, but we'll leave that for the GM to decide.</p> 
               <p>Finally, there is the appropriately named feat Very Sneaky. This lets you move 5 feet farther when you take an action to sneak (which normally lets you move at only half your normal speed) and potentially renders your target flat-footed against a follow-up strike!</p> 
               <p>There are plenty of other goblin feats for you to choose from, but that's all we have time for today. Come back on Friday when we'll look at some of the feats from the other ancestries in the game!</p>

This week, we look at four winged inhabitants of our jungle, before we tie up all the loose ends next week.</p> 
               <p>First on the agenda this week is the pixie, a wild fey prankster sure to add a bit of annoying fun to any campaign. A Small common figure, the pixie should have a few of his friends with him for anyone opening a brick or a case, allowing for all sorts of pixie swarm shenanigans. Though larger than the atomie and other tiny winged fey, the pixie figure can also stand in for a number of similar creatures if you're ok with the size discrepancies.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Next we have the river drake, a lesser dragon that makes a great challenge as the adventurers sail or steam into the heart of the jungle. Perhaps one of the most versatile figures in the set, the river drake is at home along rivers in all sorts of environments, and there are very few adventures I can think of that don't involve a river of some sort, even if just as background. The river drake is a Medium common figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>This week's third offering is the batlike sabosan, echolocating monstrous humanoids found in warm forests and in the deep caverns of the earth. The sabosan miniature can also stand in for a werebat, or in a pinch, even a winged demon or devil. Its massive wingspan makes it an imposing figure, even on a Medium base, and its common rarity means you can throw a handful of them at the players to really keep them on their toes.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Players of the <a href="/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/serpentsSkull">Serpent's Skull Adventure Path</a> will surely remember one of the campaign's most iconic winged adversaries, which we'd be remiss not to include in this set. The bane of goats and unsuspecting travelers everywhere, the winged chupacabra is a thing of legend. More dangerous than the standard, wingless chupacabra, this Medium uncommon figure is sure to be the highlight of any adventure it appears in.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Thus we end our penultimate entry in the safari journal of the <em>Jungle of Despair</em>. Next week we'll take a look at the final three figures, locked in the eternal struggle between good and evil, and after that, maybe a look at the next set on the horizon. <em>Jungle of Despair</em> is out next month, so make sure to get your preorders in soon!</p>
