  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2019</a> is quickly\
  \ approaching—join us in Seattle, WA over the four-day Memorial Day weekend and\
  \ play games, attend seminars, roll dice, shop—and celebrate all things Paizo!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Roll For Combat Starfinder actual play podcast sent multiple people\
  \ to PaizoCon 2018 for free, and this year they’re at it again. They’re also expanding\
  \ their contest and making anyone in the world eligible to <a href=\"http://rollforcombat.com/paizocon-contest/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">win a trip to PaizoCon 2019 in Seattle</a>!</p> \n    <p>For\
  \ those unfamiliar with Roll For Combat, the podcasters are playing their way through\
  \ the <a href=\"/deadsuns\">Dead Suns Adventure Path</a>, as well as the occasional\
  \ <a href=\"/starfindersociety\">Starfinder Society</a> adventure. They also regularly\
  \ host Paizo guests on their show—both as interviewees and as guest players. Over\
  \ the years the show has hosted Erik Mona, The Order of the Amber Die, Thurston\
  \ Hillman, John Compton, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Jason Keeley, Amanda Hamon,\
  \ James Jacobs, and more. Some of them even developed new Starfinder gear just for\
  \ the show (which you can download for free from the Roll For Combat Discord channel).</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://rollforcombat.com/paizocon-contest/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Conventions/20190322-Contest_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>So how does the contest work and what can you win? First,\
  \ the prizes: the winner will receive a trip to PaizoCon 2019 including airfare\
  \ (or a portion thereof for some international locations), a hotel room at the DoubleTree,\
  \ a 4-day pass to PaizoCon, and a ticket to the PaizoCon banquet.</p> \n    <p>How\
  \ to Enter: Listen to the show starting with Roll for Combat Episode 70: \"Never\
  \ Give Up, Maybe Surrender?\" and continuing until Roll for Combat Episode 76: “\
  The Slug Defense”. Although episode 70 starts at the beginning of Dead Suns Book\
  \ 4, The Ruined Clouds, GM Stephen provides a full recap of the adventure-to-date\
  \ before starting a new book. It’s easy to jump right into the show without missing\
  \ a beat! </p> \n    <p>During each episode, you will be posed a simple question,\
  \ such as “how many crits occurred during this week’s combat?” Take notes on these\
  \ answers as they’ll be required for entry.</p> \n    <p>Once you have all your\
  \ answers, just head over to the <a href=\"http://rollforcombat.com/paizocon-contest/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Roll For Combat Contest Entry Form</a>, fill out all the fields,\
  \ answer one question from each episode, and you’ll be all set!</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ winner(s) will be randomly selected from all correct entries and be announced\
  \ on <b>April 23, 2019</b> on Episode 81 of the podcast. Wait, did we say winner(s)?\
  \ Well, last year Roll For Combat initially was going to only send a single person\
  \ to PaizoCon, but decided to extend the contest two additional weeks and ended\
  \ up sending a total of three people to PaizoCon. Will they do this again this year?\
  \ Who knows, but if history is any indication there is a good chance they will!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>What if I don’t win? Have no fear, explorer! Paizo will be livestreaming\
  \ many of the seminars on the our <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Twitch Channel</a>.</p> \n    <p>Jim Butler<br> <i>VP of Marketing\
