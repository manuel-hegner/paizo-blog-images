  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hey, everybody! It's our first design\
  \ blog after PaizoCon! It was great getting a chance to show the game off for the\
  \ attendees there and collect your comments after your first chance to play. But\
  \ what if we looked at something there wasn't a chance to demo at the convention?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We've mentioned before that we're more clearly defining the three modes\
  \ of play for the Pathfinder Playtest. Encounter, exploration, and downtime mode\
  \ all have a place in the game, and they each play out differently at the table.\
  \ So, let's look at the robust new systems we've built to cover what your characters\
  \ do when they're not out on adventures!</p> \n     <p>Downtime mode is measured\
  \ in days and gives you a chance to enact your long-term plans. You might craft\
  \ items, heal up, conduct rituals, retrain some of your character options to choose\
  \ other ones, or work at jobs or stage performances to make money. These are all\
  \ things that take time and can't really be done in the middle of a dungeon.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Of course, just like with the other modes of play, these are all things\
  \ you could do previously in Pathfinder. The difference in the Playtest is that\
  \ we've more clearly defined these tasks in terms of what you can complete in the\
  \ number of days you commit to them. This means if the GM wants to codify how long\
  \ things take, it's more obvious what the value of a day spent at a task is.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Activities</h2> \n     <p>When you have a day or more off, you can\
  \ choose a defined downtime activity (or decide to do whatever else you want to).\
  \ A few of these are general, like taking bed rest to heal more quickly or retraining\
  \ your feats, skill choices, and selectable class features. </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Most\
  \ of downtime activities, however, appear under skills and require skill checks.\
  \ The ones appearing in the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i> are Craft, Create\
  \ Forgery, Gather Information, Practice a Trade, Stage a Performance, Subsist on\
  \ the Streets, Survive in the Wild, and Treat Disease. All of these require a skill\
  \ check to determine how successful you are, and a few are explained in more detail\
  \ later in this blog.</p> \n     <p>We also know we'll have some downtime activities\
  \ that are beyond the scope of the systems in the <i>Playtest Rulebook</i>. Building\
  \ a keep or wizard's tower is one of the big ones. While we for sure want you to\
  \ be able to establish a home base, this requires interconnectedness between other\
  \ systems and a high level of work by the GM, so for the Playtest, we wanted to\
  \ keep the focus on the more directly player-oriented downtime activities.</p> \n\
  \     <h2>Making Money</h2> \n     <p>Practicing a Trade and Staging a Performance\
  \ use Lore skills or the Performance skill, respectively, to make money and potentially\
  \ draw the attention of employers or patrons. For these activities, the GM determines\
  \ what type of work or audience you can find and assigns it a level, using the same\
  \ scale as PC levels. This sets your DC and how much money you can make, with more\
  \ money coming in based on your proficiency rank. If you're in a small town and\
  \ you're higher level, you might not find the type of sophisticated work that makes\
  \ full use of your talents. If you're adventuring in the Shackles, maybe you can\
  \ find work as a master of Sailing Lore that you wouldn't be able to find in, say,\
  \ the Hold of Belkzen.</p> \n     <p>Because downtime can include a really large\
  \ number of days, performing these activities long-term requires rolls only for\
  \ interesting events; you can continue doing the job and earning money at a steady\
  \ rate until the job is completed or your audiences run out. This means you can\
  \ cover long periods of downtime quickly and embellish your activity with interesting\
  \ details, rather than getting bogged down with 30 rolls for a month of downtime.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Crafting</h2> \n     <p>One of the parts of downtime we know will be\
  \ important to people is crafting items, including magical and alchemical ones.\
  \ We knew that we didn't want item crafting to be as powerful in the new edition\
  \ as it was in the first edition, where it was simply too easy to end up with far\
  \ more powerful characters that had twice as much wealth, and in a way that didn't\
  \ make a whole lot of sense in the game world.</p> \n     <p>In the Playtest, items\
  \ have levels. You can craft items of your level or lower, and you must be skilled\
  \ enough at crafting, reflected in your proficiency rank, to craft an item of that\
  \ quality (trained for standard items, and expert, master, or legendary for higher-quality\
  \ ones). Crafting an item requires you to spend half its Price in crafting materials.\
  \ You might find or acquire these sorts of materials, and most of them you can buy\
  \ directly with currency, if you need to.</p> \n     <p>You have to spend at least\
  \ 4 days crafting an item of your level, and you can reduce this if your level is\
  \ higher than the item's. Once that time is up, you have two options if you succeed\
  \ at your check: complete the item right away by supplying the rest of its Price\
  \ in materials (a great option if you have the money for the item but can't find\
  \ one on the market), or spend more time on your crafting to reduce the Price through\
  \ your superior skill. You can stop crafting at any time and complete the item by\
  \ providing the remaining amount of its Price. If you got a critical success on\
  \ your skill check, the discount is better!</p> \n     <p>What does this mean for\
  \ characters who are looking to make money by crafting? Well, crafting progress\
  \ is based on a similar scale to Practicing a Trade or Staging a Performance, so\
  \ it's about as lucrative. In fact, if you want to work as a crafter for cash instead\
  \ of items, you can use the same rules for Practice a Trade, but using your Crafting\
  \ skill modifier instead! You might make most of your money crafting and selling\
  \ minor items in a process taken from the normal rules, but you might also get the\
  \ occasional special commission from a client who wants a specific item and is willing\
  \ to pay top... gold piece.</p> \n     <h2>Using Downtime in Your Game</h2> \n \
  \    <p>If you're a Game Master, downtime lets you pace out your game and show the\
  \ passage of time between adventures. Characters and their circumstances can change\
  \ in tangible ways during their downtime. Adding color and storylines to downtime,\
  \ as well as recurring characters, helps the PCs form bonds and feel they're more\
  \ a part of the world around them. It also means that PCs with long-term goals have\
  \ a clear way of attaining them, with a clearer structure than the game had before.\
  \ Less guesswork for you, and immense expandability!</p> \n     <p>So how are your\
  \ characters going to spend their downtime?</p> \n     <p>Logan Bonner<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
