  \ Annouces Japan Relief Auction</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday March 31,\
  \ 2011</p> \n    <p>Yesterday we published on the blog the official \"Meet the Iconics\"\
  \ for Nakayama Hayato, the iconic samurai from the city of Oda in distant Minkai.\
  \ The son of the chief falconer and his wife, Hayato—whose name means \"falcon\"\
  —quickly proved just as proficient with the dangerous birds as his father, emulating\
  \ their proud and fierce natures. In time, Hayato grew to become a powerful warrior,\
  \ rising to the position of head samurai of the Nakayama holdings. When his master's\
  \ son died in a drunken duel at the age of twenty, Lord Nakayama began to look more\
  \ and more to Hayato as a son, even allowing him to take the family name. Hayato\
  \ no longer lives in Minkai but now makes his home in the Inner Sea region, upholding\
  \ the samurai code he has sworn. </p> \n    <p>In yesterday's blog post we announced\
  \ that, in partnership with Wayne Reynolds, Paizo would auction the original painting\
  \ of Hayato, along with staff-signed Special Edition copies of the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook</i> and <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>. These special edition\
  \ copies of the rulebooks are limited to fewer than 100 copies each, and available\
  \ only to Paizo staff members. But now, you can own a copy, too! With gilt pages\
  \ and gold foil cover lettering, and signed by the entire Paizo staff and cover\
  \ artist Wayne Reynolds, this collectible first printing merits a special place\
  \ on your gaming bookshelf. All proceeds from the auctions will be donated to the\
  \ Red Cross Society, an organization with extraordinary disaster response capabilities.\
  \ It has mobilized eleven teams to heavily damaged communities in Japan to provide\
  \ assessments and first aid and to supply emotional support and relief.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"All of us at Paizo have been devastated by the recent events in Japan,\
  \ and when Wayne Reynolds contacted me with the idea to auction his original Pathfinder\
  \ art, I knew this was a tangible way Paizo could help those impacted by the destruction,\"\
  \ said CEO Lisa Stevens. \"We're hoping to harness the power of our fans in an effort\
  \ of goodwill to help those in need.\"</p> \n    <p>Hayato will appear in August\
  \ 2011's <i>Ultimate Combat</i>, a 256-page hardcover reference that reveals the\
  \ martial secrets of the Pathfinder RPG rules like never before. Hayato represents\
  \ the samurai class, a warrior with more honor, dedication, and resolve than any\
  \ other. Trained from an early age in the art of war and sworn to the service of\
  \ a lord, the samurai holds a position of power and respect. In him, the common\
  \ folk see honor and sacrifice. He is an honorable warrior, dedicated to the realm\
  \ and the leaders that guide it. </p> \n    <p>To take part in this special charity\
  \ auction please visit the <a href=\"http://shop.ebay.com/paizopublishing/m.html\"\
