    \ been raised among elves, steeped in your elven ancestors' heritage. You gain\
    \ the benefits of the elf heritage that depends on or improves an elven feature\
    \ you don't have. For example, you couldn't take the Ancient Elf heritage (page\
    \ 47) unless your non-elf ancestry also has a lifespan measured in multiple centuries.\
    \ In these cases, at the GM's discretion, you might gain a different benefit."
