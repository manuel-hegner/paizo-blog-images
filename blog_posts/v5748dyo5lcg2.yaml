  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 2, 2011</p> \n   <p>We are just a few short\
  \ days away from the release of <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ies\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Combat</i></a> and many of the subscribers already have copies of this mighty\
  \ battle tome on the way to their doorsteps. For those of you not so lucky, let's\
  \ take a look at some of the other great material you can expect to find inside.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Aside from the plethora of archetypes and feats, this book has a lot of\
  \ other great rules and subsystems for you to use in your game. There are pages\
  \ and pages of new weapons, eastern weapons, gladiator weapons, primitive weapons,\
  \ and firearms. Of course, in addition to a good trusty nine-section whip, you will\
  \ also find a host of armors and few new materials. For example, take a look at\
  \ what you get out of that expensive golden sword.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Gold:</b>\
  \ Typically only used for ceremonial weapons and armor, metal equipment made from\
  \ gold is fragile, heavy, and expensive. Often golden armor is gold-plated rather\
  \ than constructed entirely from gold. The rules below are for the rare item constructed\
  \ entirely of gold rather than being gold-plated.</p> \n    <p>Gold-plated items\
  \ triple the base cost of weapons and armor and have the same properties as the\
  \ item the gold is plating. Items constructed purely of gold cost 10 times the normal\
  \ cost for items of their type. Gold items weigh 50% more than typical weapons or\
  \ armor of their type.</p> \n    <p><b>Weapons:</b> Gold is often too soft to hold\
  \ a decent edge, but light weapons that do piercing or slashing damage can be constructed\
  \ of gold or some nearly gold alloy. They take a –2 penalty on damage rolls (minimum\
  \ 1 damage).</p> \n    <p>Gold weapons have a hardness of half their base weapons’\
  \ and also have the fragile quality.</p> \n    <p><b>Armor:</b> Gold can be fashioned\
  \ into light or medium metal armor. The softness and the weight of the metal decrease\
  \ the armor/shield bonus by 2, and increase the armor check penalty by 2. Gold armor\
  \ has a hardness of 5.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>As you can see, not exactly\
  \ the best material for making weapons or armor, but you sure do look pretty using\
  \ it. Speaking of which, the one area where you really want to impress those watching\
  \ your battle skills is the arena. <i>Ultimate Combat</i> has an extensive system\
  \ for handling combat in the arena. Getting the crowd on your side in this sort\
  \ of struggle is just as important as avoiding the giant hammer swinging toward\
  \ your head. These checks work much like the Diplomacy skill, but with some very\
  \ different results. Take a look at the two ends of the spectrum.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Hostile:</b> The crowd does not like what it is seeing. Hostile crowds\
  \ demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd\
  \ is hostile toward a given side, those combatants take a –2 penalty on all attack\
  \ rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws.\
  \ This is a mind-affecting effect.</p> \n    <p>If the crowd is hostile toward a\
  \ side of the combat and a member of that side fails a performance combat check\
  \ by 5 or more, that side automatically loses the performance part of the combat.\
  \ This can be important for the story of the game, or if the PCs are participating\
  \ in serialized performance combats.</p> \n    <p><b>Helpful:</b> The crowd loves\
  \ what it is seeing from a given side. Audience members stand up, chant, cheer,\
  \ and scream for the combatants to push on toward ultimate success. A helpful crowd\
  \ grants its chosen champions a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver\
  \ checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting\
  \ effect.</p> \n    <p>If the crowd is helpful toward one side of the combat and\
  \ a member of that side succeeds at a performance combat check, that side gains\
  \ a victory point.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Winning the crowd is vital if\
  \ you want the emperor to give you that all-important thumbs-up at the end of the\
  \ bout. If things do go poorly, it's best to hop on the nearest boat, wagon, or\
  \ airship and get out of town. This is where vehicle combat comes into play. Lucky\
  \ for you, there is an entire chapter devoted to the subject, including ramming,\
  \ maneuverability, and plenty of checks to make sure your speeding wagon does not\
  \ go off a cliff. There are even a large number of stat blocks for different types\
  \ of vehicles. This one is bound to be popular.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  >Description</p> \n    <p>This ship is made of wood and is usually crafted in the\
  \ shape of a dragon. It is held aloft purely by its alchemical engine, a complicated\
  \ and dangerous device that has a tendency to explode when the vehicle becomes wrecked.\
  \ When this happens, if the alchemical dragon has a driver, that driver can make\
  \ a DC 30 driving check as an immediate action. If the check fails, the alchemical\
  \ engine explodes, dealing 10d10 points of fire damage to all objects and creatures\
  \ within a 60-foot radius of the alchemical engine. A DC 20 Reflex save halves the\
  \ damage. An alchemical dragon can carry up to 20 tons of cargo or 70 passengers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Propulsion</b> alchemical (6 squares of alchemical engines in the\
  \ middle of the ship; hardness 8, hp 120)<br> <b>Driving Check</b> Craft (alchemy)\
  \ or Knowledge (arcana) +10 to the DC<br> <b>Forward Facing</b> the ship’s forward<br>\
  \ <b>Driving Device</b> steering wheel<br> <b>Driving Space</b> the nine squares\
  \ around the steering wheel that sits at the front of the ship<br> <b>Crew</b> 10<br>\
  \ <b>Decks</b> 1<br> <b>Weapons</b> Up to 6 Large direct-fire siege engines in banks\
  \ of 3 positioned on the port and starboard sides of the alchemical dragon, or up\
  \ to 4 Huge direct-fire siege engines in banks of two on the port and starboard\
  \ sides of the ship. The siege engines may only fire out the sides of the ship they\
  \ are positioned on. They cannot be swiveled to fire toward the forward or aft sides\
  \ of the ship.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>I can think of a number of villains\
  \ that would love to have one of these, and even more PCs that would want to take\
  \ it from them.</p> \n   <p>Well, that about wraps up the previews for <i>Ultimate\
  \ Combat</i>. There is a lot more to find and discover on your own, including expanded\
  \ rules for duels, siege weapons, combat spells, and so much more. You’ll be able\
  \ to get your hands on this book any day now. I am sure we will see many of you\
  \ grabbing your copies at Gen Con later this week. See you there.</p> \n   <p>Jason\
