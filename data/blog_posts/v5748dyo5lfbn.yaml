  \     <p><span itemprop=\"description\"><i>Ultimate Campaign</i> provides a lot\
  \ of useful rules for customizing your game. So much, in fact, that I challenge\
  \ a GM to not find something of use throughout its pages! Need to come-up with a\
  \ background and traits for a character quickly? BAM! <i>Ultimate Campaign</i>.\
  \ Your world is at war and you need rules for army combat? BAM! <i>Ultimate Campaign</i>.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Of note today is when your players want to build a house. In my experience\
  \ as a GM, eventually at least one player will want their character to settle down\
  \ and want to buy a house. Well in today's blog I'm going to go demonstrate how\
  \ the Downtime System can be used to construct a house.</p> \n     <p>Our home's\
  \ architecture seems like a great jumping off point. The first step in constructing\
  \ a building is to determine the number and types of rooms in the building. We can\
  \ always choose to add rooms later as well, but room additions are for another time.\
  \ There are many ways we can construct a house, and our level of complexity will\
  \ change the cost and production length for our home. Presented below is an example\
  \ of a basic urban house (seen on page 110 of <i>Ultimate Campaign</i>):</p> \n\
  \     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">HOUSE</p> \n      <p><b>Create</b>\
  \ 32 Goods, 1 Influence, 31 Labor (1,290 gp)<br> <b>Rooms</b> 1 Bedroom, 1 Kitchen,\
  \ 1 Lavatory, 1 Sewer Access, 1 Sitting Room, 1 Storage<br> A small cottage that\
  \ can house up to two adults or a new family.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>There\
  \ is an old piece of wisdom that states that on any project we have Time, Cost,\
  \ &amp; Quality and that we can only have 2 of them optimized. The quality of our\
  \ building is set by what rooms we select, so for this example our quality is a\
  \ fixed value, leaving us with time &amp; cost to play around with.</p> \n     <p>Our\
  \ house costs 32 Goods, 1 Influence, and 31 Labor in capital. The capital system\
  \ is described in greater detail in Chapter 2 of Ultimate Campaign, but directly\
  \ translated into gold pieces this equates to 1,290 gp to buy the house outright,\
  \ and have it built for us. However, we can spend some time working on the house\
  \ to earn the capital necessary to build the house instead if we wanted to bring\
  \ the cost down and get our character's hands dirty.</p> \n     <p>Earning capital\
  \ costs half as much as purchasing it, but takes time and some creative thinking\
  \ on how our character will work to earn it. Let's say our character can reliably\
  \ earn 1 point of capital per day, and can do so for each type of capital. This\
  \ means our character would spend 62 days gathering resources and labor building\
  \ their house for an overall price of 645 gp. The time investment can change however,\
  \ as some characters are suited to earning certain types of capital quicker, and\
  \ the town's size limits how fast construction can go.</p> \n     <p>\"But I don't\
  \ want to pay for my house at all\" I hear you exclaim. Well here's where we can\
  \ go to the far extremity the other direction, though we need to make a lot of assumptions\
  \ for our character. Lets say our character can earn a net gain of 2 gp per day\
  \ working a job away from adventuring, then your house would only take another 323\
  \ days to completeâ€”approximately just over a year of non-adventuring... though some\
  \ games may have that much down-time, you're probably best to just go adventuring\
  \ and spend some money on the house. It will save your GM a facepalm, and keep your\
  \ character from racking up debt at the local inn for a year!</p> \n     <p>Justin\
