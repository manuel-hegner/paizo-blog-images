  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The other day Chris Lambertz pointed\
  \ out to me that, while we've done a number of interviews and convention panels\
  \ revealing bits and pieces about the Starfinder RPG, we haven't actually collected\
  \ them all together (though some of you have been doing a great job of it over at\
  \ <a href=\"/threads/rzs2tu6w\">this thread</a>). It sounded like a great idea,\
  \ so I said what I always say when a great idea comes along:</p> \n    <p>\"That\
  \ sounds like a great idea. Let's make Josh do it.\"</p> \n    <p>And so, with his\
  \ usual pluck and aplomb, editor Josh Vogt read through a bunch of interviews and\
  \ listened to podcasts in which Erik, Rob, Owen, and I shot off our mouths about\
  \ the new game, and collated the most important points here. So now, in no particular\
  \ order—what we know so far about Starfinder!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Kiki Moch Rizky</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>The\
  \ Products</h2> \n    <ul>\n     <li>The Core Rulebook and first Adventure Path\
  \ volume will release in August 2017, at Gen Con.</li> \n     <li>It's a science-fantasy\
  \ RPG based on the Pathfinder universe and rules, but complete and standalone.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>It's \"conceptually compatible\" with Pathfinder, with the specific\
  \ idea that you should be able to use Pathfinder monsters in Starfinder with a minimum\
  \ of conversion fuss at the table.</li> \n     <li>While there will be occasional\
  \ rules supplements like bestiaries, the Starfinder Adventure Path will be a primary\
  \ vector for new rules and setting information. Overall, we expect to release products\
  \ for Starfinder at a much slower rate than we do for Pathfinder, making it easier\
  \ and more affordable to stay up to date on both games.</li> \n     <li>Starfinder\
  \ Adventure Path and the Starfinder RPG rulebook line will not be replacing Pathfinder—\
  it's a whole separate game, and thus not expected to impact the production of our\
  \ normal Pathfinder material after the initial release.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <h2>The\
  \ Setting</h2> \n    <ul>\n     <li>It's set in Golarion's solar system, far in\
  \ a possible future in which Golarion is missing—the gods say it's safe, but won't\
  \ say what happened to it. In its former orbit is a massive space platform called\
  \ Absalom Station.</li> \n     <li>History is obscured in the Starfinder setting,\
  \ as an unknown amount of time has been mysteriously and completely wiped from everyone's\
  \ memories and all known records—even those on the Outer Planes. This blank period\
  \ between ancient and modern history is called the Gap, and while it effects the\
  \ entire multiverse, the edges aren't all in the same place. For instance, one planet\
  \ might remember back 300 years, while another remembers back 305—these inconsistencies\
  \ are the primary references some Starfinders use to piece together the secret history\
  \ of the universe.</li> \n     <li>There's faster than light travel in Starfinder,\
  \ via a hyperspace dimension gifted by an ascended AI deity.</li> \n     <li>All\
  \ the core Pathfinder races will still exist and be playable with the Core Rulebook,\
  \ yet Starfinder's core races are different, and include humans, lashunta, ysoki\
  \ (ratfolk), androids, kasatha, and two races not yet revealed.</li> \n     <li>In\
  \ addition, there's going to be a heavy emphasis on introducing more alien player\
  \ races. Where possible, you should be able to play the creatures you encounter.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>There's still plenty of magic in the setting, but technology has become\
  \ a dominant force. For instance, if you're playing an Iomedaean crusader, you might\
  \ wear holy powered armor and carry a plasma cannon carved with magical runes.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Will continue Pathfinder's legacy of being as diverse and inclusive\
  \ as possible.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <h2>Gameplay</h2> \n    <ul>\n     <li>There\
  \ will be seven core classes on release: the technomancer (magical hacker blending\
  \ technology and magic), mechanic (engineer with a robot buddy), solarian (mystical\
  \ melee combatant harnessing the cycles of the stars), soldier (heavy weapons specialist),\
  \ envoy (diplomat and ally-booster), mystic (caster channeling strange energies\
  \ to manipulate biological systems), and operative (stealthy skill specialist).</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Star Wars is a decent comparison, tone-wise, but Starfinder will have\
  \ more magic and moral ambiguity. Other inspirations include Firefly, Shadowrun,\
  \ the Expanse series, and more—if we could do for space opera what Shadowrun did\
  \ for 1980s cyberpunk, we'd be ecstatic.</li> \n     <li>Starfinder puts an even\
  \ greater focus on exploration than Pathfinder, as the setting pushes many adventurers\
  \ out toward a galaxy full of uncontacted worlds. While you can play whole adventures\
  \ or campaigns on a single world if you want, the assumption is that the PCs are\
  \ probably the crew of a starship.</li> \n     <li>Starship battles will be a significant\
  \ element in the game, with their own combat system utilizing miniatures, but not\
  \ as common as ordinary character-scale combat.</li> \n     <li>There will not be\
  \ an open playtest—instead, there will be a closed playtest will feature other RPG\
  \ designers and third-party publishers, Pathfinder Society members, and various\
  \ key members of the industry and community. While we wish we could open the playtest\
  \ up to everyone, the timeframe involved and scope of the playtest simply make it\
  \ impractical. (Unlike Pathfinder's class playtests, in order to make this one work,\
  \ we have to give people the <i>entire</i> game.</li> \n     <li>The plan is to\
  \ produce a Starfinder Reference Document (like the PRD) and make it available for\
  \ free online.</li> \n     <li>Starfinder will have an OGL-like compatibility license\
  \ allowing for third-party products.</li> \n     <li>Starfinder organized play is\
  \ something we're actively investigating, but not ready to announce anything about\
  \ just yet.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>While everyone on the Starfinder team is currently\
  \ so buried in work that they need snorkels to breathe, we <i>are</i> planning on\
  \ doing more blog posts and reveals of new information in the coming months, as\
  \ well as introducing some exciting new ways to preview parts of the game and get\
  \ feedback from the community at large. So stay tuned!</p> \n    <p>James L. Sutter<br>\
