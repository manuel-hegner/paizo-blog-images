  \ the Suspects: Part 2</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, January 3, 2008</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Last week, we introduced four of the eight suspects the PCs will have\
  \ to investigate while they are trapped in a haunted courthouse with time running\
  \ out. Here are the other four candidates for the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdi\"\
  >Hangman's Noose</a>:</p> \n    <p>The Fool: Ebin Blithoddle is a peculiar gnome\
  \ who dresses in motley and has a stupid joke and a bad pun for every occasion.\
  \ Despite the fact that he couldn't make a hyena laugh, the poor old sod refuses\
  \ to quit, dancing and capering around the courthouse in fits of manic hysteria.\
  \ Still, a sinister air hangs around the smiling and dancing foolâ€”at times, his\
  \ eyes seem glassy and his smile looks fixed. Even for Ebin, there is something\
  \ about this courthouse that is not funny at all.</p> \n    <p>The Curious: Of all\
  \ the suspects, Killian Paltreth is perhaps the most normal. Of course, in this\
  \ adventure, anything normal is automatically cause for suspicion. The alchemist\
  \ seems like a decent enough fellow genuinely interested in getting to the bottom\
  \ of the mystery. But who knows what this seemingly honest old man is cooking up\
  \ in that laboratory of his? And how did he get mixed up in this nasty business?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Bully: Malgrim Hurkes is one of the most notorious figures in Absalom.\
  \ The leader of a gang called the Grindle Street Shades, this ruthless hobgoblin\
  \ has his fingers in much of the violent crime around the seedier districts of the\
  \ city. Unfortunately, he doesn't take too kindly to being questioned by upstart\
  \ adventures.</p> \n    <p>The Innocent: This cute, athletic halfling named Madge\
  \ Blossomheart was little more than a girl when the crimes were committed, and she\
  \ retains much of her youthful charm. This unfortunate maiden doesn't even understand\
  \ most of what is going on... or at least that's what she claims. But what dark\
  \ secrets could she possibly be concealing behind that glowing smile?</p> \n   \
