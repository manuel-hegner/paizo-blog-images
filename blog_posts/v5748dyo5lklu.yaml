  \ but we knew we could do better. To replace the Map Packs, we put together <a href=\"\
  /store/pathfinder/accessories/maps/flipTiles\">Flip-Tiles</a>: 6-inch-by-6-inch,\
  \ double-sided tiles, each corresponding to a themed starter set, and designed to\
  \ be even more modular than the Map Packs where.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Our first Starter Set along with its first expansion\
  \ saw announcement in that earlier blog. Surprise, surprise, it was dungeon themed.\
  \ After the release of those two sets, we are going to release the second starter,\
  \ which will be <a href=\"/products/btpy9y23?Pathfinder-FlipTiles-Forest-Starter-Set\"\
  ><em>Forest Starter Set</em></a>. Coming quickly on its heels is a forest-themed\
  \ expansion, similar to the role that <a href=\"/products/btpy9y24?Pathfinder-FlipTiles-Dungeon-Perils-Expansion\"\
  ><em>Dungeon Perils</em></a> plays with the <a href=\"/products/btpy9y1y?Pathfinder-FlipTiles-Dungeon-Starter-Set\"\
  ><em>Dungeon Starter Set</em></a>. From these two initial starter sets and their\
  \ expansions, you can see where we are going with all of this. Given that many of\
  \ the sets also have connector tiles—that is tiles that bridge the gap between one\
  \ theme and another, you can probably get a good idea of where the product line\
  \ is going.</p> \n    <p>Not everything is set in stone, though. As with any new\
  \ product, we are keen to assess your wants and desires for such products. I'm pretty\
  \ good at anticipating, since my first thought when designing a new map or a mapping\
  \ product is always, \"would I want to play with this?\" But sometimes something\
  \ incredibly obvious can just zing over my head as I sketch away on this project\
  \ or that.</p> \n    <p>In one of those \"why the heck didn't I think of that?\"\
  \ moments, when we announced the product in an earlier blog, a group of folks suggested\
  \ that we find an alphanumeric scheme for the tiles. It was a good idea and sent\
  \ us backpedaling a bit and considering the best way to implement such a feature.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Like any product decision, this starts with a cost/benefit analysis,\
  \ not one that talked to the bottom line when it comes to the actual economics of\
  \ the product. It wouldn't affect the printing costs, but would such numbering be\
  \ beneficial rather than harmful. The benefits were numerous. Not only would it\
  \ help the user organize their collection, but such a code can also be utilized\
  \ by adventure writers to instantly tell the user what tiles were needed to present\
  \ a map that used them and even which set to find the correct tile.</p> \n    <p>It's\
  \ no secret that an element for the success of the <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/accessories/maps/flipmats\"\
  >Pathfinder Flip-Mat Classics</a> line is Pathfinder Society's has utilization of\
  \ Flip-Mats throughout that line and the older GameMastery lines' existence. It\
  \ turns out that when actual use and play increases so does demand. One of the goals\
  \ of the Flip-Tile line was an increase of utility with of modular mapping product,\
  \ so any idea that would improve that usability carried a great deal of weight.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, as with anything, there were arguments against organizing\
  \ the tiles with an alphanumeric code. But they were sparse, typically amounted\
  \ to the complaint that it would \"reduce immersion,\" so we knew that if we could\
  \ make it as useful and unobtrusive as possible, we could hover around the best\
  \ of both worlds.</p> \n    <p>In the end, after a great deal of brainstorming and\
  \ discussion, we came up the with the following format:</p> \n    <blockquote>\n\
  \     <p style=\"text-align: center;\">[Two letter abbreviation for set] [Set number]<br>\
  \ [Tile number] [Side A or B]</p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The abbreviation for\
  \ the set type tells you what starter set the tile is from or expands. For instance,\
  \ if the tile is part of the Dungeon Starter Set or one of its expansions, it features\
  \ the letters DU (for dungeon). If its part of the Forest Starter Set or one of\
  \ the forest expansions, it features the letter FR (for forest... while avoiding\
  \ the somewhat confusing FO designator). The set numbering is as brief and concise\
  \ as possible. If the tile is from a starter set, the set number is 0. Since Dungeon\
  \ Perils is the first expansion of the <em>Dungeon Starter Set</em>, that set's\
  \ tiles will feature a DU1 in the first line of the code.</p> \n    <p>There is\
  \ a tile number from 01-42 for in each starter set or 01-24 in each expansion. One\
  \ side is labeled A, and the other is labeled B. So, for instance, the second side\
  \ of the 24th tile in <em>Flip-Tiles: Dungeon Perils</em> would have the following\
  \ code featured on a corner of the tile.</p> \n    <blockquote>\n     <p style=\"\
  text-align: center;\">DU1<br> 24B</p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>While the last\
  \ second side of the last tile found in <em>Flip-Tiles: Forest Starter Set</em>\
  \ would feature this code.</p> \n    <blockquote>\n     <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
  >FR0<br> 42B</p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>With just a glance, you can put away\
  \ and rearrange your tiles. Better yet, when preparing your next game, you can just\
  \ list the group of tiles you need for each encounter, throw them in a box and go.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>All of this stems our main goal here at Paizo—to give you all the content\
  \ and tools to have the best roleplaying experiences available.</p> \n    <p>Stephen\
