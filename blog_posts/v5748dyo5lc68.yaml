  >Tuesday, May 10, 2011</p> \n   <p>Due to hit subscribers and store shelves in just\
  \ a few days, we are continuing our look into <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8g7s\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Magic</i></a>. This week we are diving into the feats chapter, with a bonus look\
  \ at spells.</p> \n   <p>At 20 pages long, the feats chapter is by no means huge,\
  \ but it does feature a little something for just about every spellcaster in the\
  \ game, with a few options for nonspellcasters thrown in for good measure. While\
  \ a number of these feats are here to complement one of the new archetypes, some\
  \ fill out some holes left by the APG. For example, Extra Evolution gives the summoner\
  \ more points to use when building his eidolon. Looking through the feat lists,\
  \ though, I am drawn to the feats that allow characters to explore the game in new\
  \ and interesting ways. Take a look at this one.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Eldritch\
  \ Heritage</b><br> You are descended from a long line of sorcerers, and some portion\
  \ of their power flows in your veins.<br> <b>Prerequisites</b>: Cha 13, Skill Focus\
  \ with the class skill of bloodline selected for this feat (see below), character\
  \ level 3rd.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: Select one sorcerer bloodline. You must have Skill\
  \ focus in the class skill that bloodline grants to a sorcerer at 1st level (for\
  \ example, Heal for the celestial bloodline). This bloodline cannot be a bloodline\
  \ you already have. You gain the first-level bloodline power for the selected bloodline.\
  \ For purposes of using that power, treat your sorcerer level as equal to your character\
  \ level – 2, even if you have levels in sorcerer. You do not gain any of the other\
  \ bloodline abilities.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Bloodlines—they're not just\
  \ for sorcerers anymore.</p> \n   <p>Moving on, this book has a number of metamagic\
  \ feats, as well, for every spellcaster to play with. While a number of these add\
  \ effects to spells that deal a specific kind of energy damage, my personal favorite\
  \ (due to some recent frustrating encounters) has to be this one.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Piercing Spell (Metamagic)</b><br> Your studies have helped you develop\
  \ methods to overcome spell resistance.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: When you cast a piercing\
  \ spell against a target with spell resistance, it treats the spell resistance of\
  \ the target as 5 lower than its actual SR. A piercing spell uses up a spell slot\
  \ one level higher than the spell's actual level. </p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Not\
  \ surprisingly, this book also includes a sizable number of new spells for every\
  \ spellcaster in the game. There are new symbol spells, new spells for the polymorph\
  \ subschool (<i>undead anatomy</i> has been long awaited), and plenty of unique\
  \ spells for some of the newer spellcasting classes (like witch and inquisitor).\
  \ In addition, there are a lot spells designed specifically to add a bit of interesting\
  \ flavor to the spellcaster's arsenal. Looking to flesh out your evil bard? Take\
  \ a look at this spell.</p> \n   <div align=\"right\">\n    <table border=\"0\"\
  \ align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n     <tbody>\n      <tr>\n\

  \   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Haunting Choir</b><br> <b>School</b> necromancy\
  \ [mind-affecting, pain]; <b>Level</b> bard 3<br> <b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard\
  \ action<br> <b>Components</b> V, S<br> <b>Range</b> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br>\
  \ <b>Area</b> 30-ft.-radius emanation<br> <b>Duration</b> concentration + 2 rounds<br>\
  \ <b>Saving Throw</b> Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes<br> You create a\
  \ spectral choir and conduct its tortured, ghostly moans, deluding listeners into\
  \ believing they are suffering the torments of the dead. The transparent singers\
  \ occupy a 10-foot cube, but they are intangible and do not interfere with creatures\
  \ in any physical way, nor can they be attacked. Creatures within 30 feet of the\
  \ choir experience wracking pain that causes them to take a –2 penalty on attack\
  \ rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. Individuals who exit the area of effect\
  \ take these penalties for an additional 2 rounds before the delusion wears off.</p>\n\
  \   </blockquote> \n   <p>I was about to wrap up the blog right there, but then\
  \ I remember seeing this spell. I will end with this festive magic. Next week, we\
  \ will wrap up our previews with one last look at the words of power alternative\
  \ spellcasting system. Enjoy.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Snapdragon Fireworks</b><br>\
  \ <b>School</b> transmutation [fire, light]; <b>Level</b> bard 2, sorcerer/wizard\
  \ 1<br> <b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action<br> <b>Components</b> S, V, M (a bundle\
  \ of sulfur wrapped in cloth)<br> <b>Range</b> long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)<br>\
  \ <b>Effect</b> dragon-shaped fireworks<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 round/level<br> <b>Saving\
  \ Throw</b> Reflex negates; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes<br> A favorite display at\
  \ halfling midsummer festivals, this spell lets you create fireworks in the shape\
  \ of tiny dragons. Once per round, as a move action, you may designate a target\
  \ 5-foot-square within range and launch a pyrotechnic in that direction. The pyrotechnic\
  \ takes a zigzag path from you to that square, always missing creatures and objects\
  \ in its path, and detonates in that square with a bang and a colorful burst of\
  \ fire and light. Creatures in the target square take 1d4 points of fire damage\
  \ and are dazzled for 1 round (Reflex half, a successful save negates the dazzled\
  \ condition). Normally when this spell is used as part of a festival, the chosen\
  \ target is high in the sky to increase visibility and protect observers.</p> \n\
