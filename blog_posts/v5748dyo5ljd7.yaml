  \    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>In the\
  \ spirit of the holidays, it's time to go shopping! Designer Paul Peterson can be\
  \ found hawking his wares below, describing the trader mechanic in <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask\"\
  >Mummy's Mask</a>. You ain't never had a friend like Paul.</i></p> \n     <p>Ah,\
  \ gentle travelers. To what noble purpose may an unworthy guide such as myself be\
  \ put for you on a morning so clearly blessed by Ra himself?</p> \n     <p>Shopping,\
  \ you say? Perhaps the blessing of generous Wadjet would be more appropriate for\
  \ those seeking new objects of wonder and delight. There are many fine traders in\
  \ and around the most wonderful city of Wati, noble souls. Gaze upon our most voluminous\
  \ bazaar!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Bazaar.jpg\"\

  \ <i>Your access to more exclusive shops comes as your reputation grows. Just like\
  \ life.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>But now that I look more closely at you, I perceive\
  \ that you must be adventurers, here to participate in the lottery! It is most fortuitous\
  \ that we have met today, for I may be able to guide your way with what meager wisdom\
  \ I possess.</p> \n     <p>It is said that every party that comes back from a successful\
  \ journey in this world may exchange the prizes they discover for those that a trader\
  \ can provide. If you have lost your way on this road, there will be no trading\
  \ in your future. And as with all things, there are rules that must be obeyed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Before any of you begin trading, you must settle the record of your\
  \ accomplishments. If your adventuring has given you rewards, gather those together\
  \ with all the rest of your possessions before you arrive. Then you are ready to\
  \ bargain!</p> \n     <p>And there is so little time and so much to see in the markets!\
  \ The haggling alone all but ensures that each of you will only be able to visit\
  \ one stall when you come.</p> \n     <p>Also, many of the places you may visit\
  \ will not wish to deal with money. There are unfortunate taxes to any monetary\
  \ transactions that can be... avoided, if participants simply exchange objects.\
  \ So after you have chosen the undeserving merchant you wish to bargain with, trade\
  \ amongst yourselves to ensure that each person has what they want to give away\
  \ for clearly more magnificent treasures. However, these are not charity booths.\
  \ The merchants are masters at bargaining and will be willing to trade only objects\
  \ of roughly comparable quality. But cheating adventurers can shorten a trader's\
  \ lifespan, so you can be fairly sure that you are getting value for your trades\
  \ as well.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-MummifiedCat.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Equal value? Close enough.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>We could\
  \ begin in the Sunburst Market. The selection there is unparalleled, and you will\
  \ have your pick of anything you desire... so long as what you desire is a common\
  \ gewgaw. However, the merchants there are so simple that they will take almost\
  \ anything you have about your person in trade.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>For all your Basic needs.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Oh, peerless\
  \ explorers, how could I have believed that such trash would satisfy the appetites\
  \ of such as you?! Let us speak of it no more. The treasures you surely seek are\
  \ more likely found with more specialized shopkeepers. Each tends to carry a very\
  \ specific type of good, so if you find the right one, you are much more likely\
  \ find your needs fulfilled.</p> \n     <p>It is a funny thing about these merchants,\
  \ though: If you approach them by yourself, then no matter how many objects you\
  \ see displayed, you will only find exactly two that are of any interest to you\
  \ whatsoever. However, if you bring others with you, the seller will miraculously\
  \ find another object for each of them. Then you will all be free to decide amongst\
  \ yourselves which object each of you will take, with the leftovers being consigned\
  \ to the dusty part of the tent forever. If you have trouble doing so, I'm sure\
  \ a quick dice throw could sort out who gets to choose first.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Open 24 hours a day.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>As I said,\
  \ each trader has their own specialty. The Smiths of Wati hammer away at their forges,\
  \ crafting the weapons all the lottery winners need. But Falsin Deek over here does\
  \ not like to deal in objects of war such as weapons, armors, and spells. He instead\
  \ carries a fine selection of more utilitarian fare: potions and books, rings and\
  \ amulets—these can all be found within his walls.</p> \n     <p>But if unlocking\
  \ the mysteries of the arcane or divine is more to your liking, just next door you\
  \ will find Hadden Hoppert, perhaps the finest scribe in all of Osirion. He is only\
  \ too happy to share his secrets for just a couple of similarly powerful boons.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While these three are happy to meet with any and all adventurers, other\
  \ traders are more selective. They often only contact you after you have done some\
  \ great service to their shining selves or to the city as a whole.</p> \n     <div\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Be careful or you may rot in the belly of a sand kraken for\
  \ 1000 years.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>If I may also offer more humble knowledge,\
  \ do not think that such simple shopkeeps as you see here are all that you will\
  \ find in glorious Osirion. Many more exotic traders may be willing to barter what\
  \ they have for what they want if you are brave enough to seek them out. But beware\
  \ that the more specialized the goods, the dearer the cost.</p> \n     <p>For example,\
  \ you might find some troublingly large footprints over by that glassblower's shop.\
  \ I expect that you'll be able to trade a few glittery curios for the weapons of\
  \ the fools who decided to follow them.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \     </div> \n     <p>I pray to Wadjet the most divine that my paltry knowledge\
  \ is of some minor benefit to your glorious selves. It is always an honor to help\
  \ those who are so clearly the chosen of the gods. Perhaps you shall even choose\
  \ to reward my efforts, if they please you, but we can deal with such matters later.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>For now the question is... What do you seek?</p> \n     <p>Paul Peterson<br>\
