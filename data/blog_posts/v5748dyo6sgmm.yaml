  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> just\
  \ around the corner, the current focus of the team involves pulling the edges together\
  \ on all the moving pieces. As many of our convention catalogs went live last weekend,\
  \ I wanted to take a moment and give some updates.</p> \n     <p><b>PaizoCon</b>:\
  \ The event lottery is complete, and I'm working with Customer Service to resolve\
  \ any issues with scheduling. We will be reaching out via email as needed to discuss\
  \ our resolution options. We also received a few GM cancellations so we will be\
  \ reaching out to GMs that were on the waitlist for coverage. If your plans changed\
  \ and you wish to GM some games, please visit <a href=\"http://organizedplayfoundation.org/paizoorganizedplay\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><strong>organizedplayfoundation.org/paizoorganizedplay</strong></a>\
  \ and complete the questionnaire for PaizoCon.</p> \n     <p><b>Origins</b>: Tickets\
  \ are on sale for all games, including the Saturday evening premiere of <em>Starfinder\
  \ Society #2-00: Fate of the Scoured God</em>. This multi-table interactive event\
  \ wraps up the storylines from the prior 22 months and gets ready to pivot to our\
  \ Year of a Thousand Bites. We are selling tickets to this event by Tier range,\
  \ to make GM allocation easier, so be sure to grab double check which one you add\
  \ to your cart!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20190410-SFS-Yr2symbol.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20190410-SFS-Yr2symbol_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The Origins system has a few problems finding and displaying\
  \ the events that run from 7 pm to midnight. The best way to find games is to look\
  \ for the title of the scenario, such as \"Daughters' Due\" or \"Herald's War.\"\
  \ Then you can look through the schedule for the date/time you wish.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>There are still tickets for many tables, including the PFS interactive finale\
  \ running on Friday, <em>Pathfinder Society #10-98: Siege of Gallowspire</em>. We\
  \ set these up for sale by Tier and by difficulty level—Soldier (slightly harder\
  \ than usual) and Champion (hard mode). This year, I can pull ticket sale information,\
  \ so we are using those numbers to adjust our table offerings. Unfortunately, ticket\
  \ sales shifts may not resolve the schedule for everyone. If you can't get into\
  \ a game you want, please come by on the day, and we will see what we can do on\
  \ site. We desire to seat everyone that wants a game!</p> \n     <p><b>Gen Con</b>:\
  \ We submitted our schedule, and you should see them appear any day now! Tickets\
  \ go on sale May 19 at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>gencon.com</strong></a>.\
  \ Games for Gen Con run in 5-hour blocks from Thursday through Saturday 8:00 AM\
  \ to 1:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, 8:00 PM to 1:00 AM, and 2:00 AM to 7:00 AM. Sunday\
  \ has one block starting at 9:00 AM. Each block includes a selection of Pathfinder\
  \ Society, Starfinder Society, and Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) games. Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Society, Pathfinder Society Academy (to include Starfinder events)\
  \ run in 2-hour blocks from 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM Thursday through Saturday and Sunday\
  \ from 9:00 to 2:00 PM.</p> \n     <p>A few highlight events:</p> \n     <ul>\n\
  \      <li><em><strong>Thursday, 8:00 PM</strong></em>—a large scale seating of\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) #1-00: Origin of the Open Road</em></li>\
  \ \n      <li><em><strong>Friday, 8:00 PM</strong></em>—<em>Starfinder Society #2-00:\
  \ Fate of the Scoured God</em></li> \n      <li><em><strong>Saturday 8:00 PM</strong></em>—\
  <em>Pathfinder Society #10-98: Siege of Gallowspire</em></li>\n     </ul> \n   \
  \  <p>As with Origins, we are selling tickets to <em>PFS #10-98</em> by Tier and\
  \ difficulty level, so check your tickets carefully. Especially with <em>#10-98</em>,\
  \ where only 7th level pregens are available.</p> \n     <p>For those of you not\
  \ traveling to any of the conventions listed above, both <em>Starfinder Society\
  \ #2-00: Fate of the Scoured God</em> and <em>Pathfinder Society #10-98: Siege of\
  \ Gallowspire</em> are available after August 4 for conventions running 3-concurrent\
  \ tables. At this time, <em>Starfinder Society #1-99: Scoured Stars Invasion</em>\
  \ and <em>Pathfinder Society #10-00: Hao Jin Cataclysm</em> become available for\
  \ purchase.</p> \n     <p>If you missed it this morning, developer Linda Zayas-Palmer\
  \ wrote about our plans for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. Check it out\
  \ here: PACS Blog. Otherwise, tune in next Wednesday for more decisions regarding\
  \ the evolution of the Pathfinder Society.</p> \n     <p>Until next time—Explore,\
  \ Report, Cooperate!</p> \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Manager</i></p>\
