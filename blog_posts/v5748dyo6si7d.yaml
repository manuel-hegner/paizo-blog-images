  \ from the future! As mentioned in our Introducing the Narrative Team blog, there\
  \ have been some changes to Paizo’s teams, and perhaps none have seen more of a\
  \ shake-up than the Starfinder Team!</p> \n     <p>With the restructure of the editorial\
  \ department, you’ve already heard about changes to the Narrative Team under Linda\
  \ Zayas-Palmer and will be hearing more about the Rules and Lore Team under Michael\
  \ Sayre in the coming weeks. Today is your chance to learn about the Starfinder\
  \ Team and some of the exciting changes we’ve got coming down our futuristic pipeline.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Starfinder Team is responsible for everything Starfinder. That includes\
  \ Starfinder Adventure Paths, Starfinder modules, Starfinder hardcovers, Starfinder\
  \ the flamethrower… oh wait, ignore that last one! The team handles all aspects\
  \ of Starfinder except for Starfinder Society, which remains under the Narrative\
  \ Team due to its close connections to Pathfinder Society through Paizo’s Organized\
  \ Play programs—though we keep in regular contact with our SFS developer for scheming\
  \ purposes.</p> \n     <p>All right, let’s introduce the team!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \  <br> \n     <h3>Dustin Knight</h3> \n     <p>Greetings Starfinders! I’m Dustin\
  \ Knight, the newest developer for Starfinder! I’m taking the lead on the development\
  \ of future Starfinder hardcover books. Working at Paizo is a dream come true, and\
  \ I’m so excited to bring smiles to our fans around the world. I’m also elated to\
  \ be able to work with the most creative and skilled artists, designers, developers,\
  \ editors, and writers in the industry; my only regret is not contacting Paizo years\
  \ sooner to ask for work (hint, hint). Being able to develop player-facing options\
  \ is especially exciting for me given my experiences both writing new content and\
  \ evaluating existing content for Organized Play—where I hope my additions to our\
  \ awesome game will facilitate memorable stories for years to come.</p> \n     <p>You\
  \ may have already met me lurking around various Starfinder &amp; Pathfinder Discords,\
  \ hanging with the crew on Know Direction: Beyond, and releasing my own line of\
  \ Pathfinder Infinite products. When I’m not developing or writing new RPG books,\
  \ I’m still finding time to play TCGs, experience the culinary cross-roads of the\
  \ Seattle area, and enjoy every minute of my precious boyfriend’s incredible Starfinder\
  \ campaign!</p> \n     <p>If you’re interested in working with us, please feel free\
  \ to contact me at dustin.knight@paizo.com. Don’t be shy about including your availability,\
  \ interests, and experiences, whether RPG related or otherwise, as it can greatly\
  \ help us assign exciting content that plays to your strengths as an author! Feel\
  \ free to chat me up on the Infinite Possibilities Discord.</p> \n     <br> \n \
  \    <h3>Jenny Jarzabski</h3> \n     <p>Hi, I’m Jenny Jarzabski, and I’m super hyped\
  \ to keep bringing that extra sparkle to Starfinder’s Adventure Path line. I’ll\
  \ be outlining and assigning Adventure Paths and modules, plus working with the\
  \ rest of the team to dig deeper into Starfinder’s lore and shape the future of\
  \ Starfinder as a game and brand!</p> \n     <p>My Paizo career began in Organized\
  \ Play. There, I helmed the Starfinder Society’s Year of the Data Scourge before\
  \ joining the Adventure Path team. Recently, I’ve stepped into my new role as Queen\
  \ of Adventures—note that my actual title is Senior Developer—a role that encompasses\
  \ my old job responsibilities with an added layer of creative influence and mentorship.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Besides my on-the-clock work, I’m a longtime Paizo freelancer, but adventures\
  \ are my specialty. My latest published work is recently released <em>Drift Crashers\
  \ 2: Nightmare Scenario</em>, but I have so many ‘Finder credits at this point that\
  \ it’s hard to keep track. Before I became a freelance writer I worked as a teacher,\
  \ bartender and certified sommelier, and event planner. I still enjoy talking about\
  \ wine and, of course, tasting it! I love the outdoors, playing video games (<em>Drakengard/NieR</em>\
  \ and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> are my favorites), watching anime, cosplay, performing,\
  \ and music. I love mechs, magical girls, and tragic androids; you can expect more\
  \ of this holy trinity (and many more fun surprises) in future Starfinder releases.\
  \ I’m not into social media these days, but I’m active on Discord and my digital\
  \ mailbox at jenny.jarzabski@paizo.com is always open! Forgive me for the Drift\
  \ delay in responding. </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Thurston Hillman</h3> \n    \
  \ <p>Hello! I’m Thurston Hillman, the managing creative director for the Starfinder\
  \ Team. This is a bit of a unique title in our company as it combines the elements\
  \ of manager and creative director to balance out the fact that Starfinder is a\
  \ smaller team. My role comprises the usual logistical scheduling tasks as well\
  \ as the oversight and guidance provided by a creative director. I work side-by-side\
  \ with my co-workers and other departments to make sure that Starfinder is the best\
  \ brand it can be, and to bring all the content that our fans want.</p> \n     <p>I’\
  ve been GMing Starfinder campaigns off and on since the game came out, including\
  \ some hosted on Paizo’s Twitch Channel. (Check for Pungeon Crawl!) Along with my\
  \ obvious love of Starfinder, I’m a huge fan of Pathfinder, and I even GM a show\
  \ as part of the Narrative Declaration team (<a href=\"https://www.narrativedeclaration.com/\"\
  >https://www.narrativedeclaration.com</a>) in our custom Rotgrind setting. I also\
  \ run a home PF2 campaign set in the nation of Druma, for which I co-wrote the actual\
  \ book back at the end of Pathfinder 1st Edition, and we’re now entering the fourth\
  \ adventure in my homebrew Adventure Path that has the PCs battling against corrupt\
  \ Prophets of Kalistrade and the forces of Abaddon. Yeah, that’s right, I’m using\
  \ this space to TELL YOU ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN!! *insidious laughter follows*</p> \n\
  \     <p>I’ve been working with Paizo since Starfinder’s launch, where I was the\
  \ Starfinder Society developer. I later helped the Pathfinder Society for a brief\
  \ stint before moving into digital adventures and then back onto Starfinder in my\
  \ current title. In all those roles, I’ve worked on too many products to name, and\
  \ most recently I’m wrapping up work on the Scoured Stars Adventure Path, which\
  \ is a dream-come-true project. Also, I tossed a never-before-seen Scoured Stars\
  \ art piece into this blog, because I am ABUSING MY NEW AUTHORITY *more insidious\
  \ laughter ensues*</p> \n     <p>On official channels, you can contact me at thurston.hillman@paizo.com.\
  \ For the foreseeable future, I’m hands-on when it comes to outlining and assigning\
  \ our current slate of projects, so while Dustin and Jenny are using their stable\
  \ of freelancers and contacts, I’ll still be involved in the process for a bit.\
  \ I’ll be primarily focused on supporting Adventure Paths and charting the vision\
  \ for our hardback lines, but don’t be surprised if I have a special project or\
  \ two that you one day hear about.</p> \n     <p>You can find me on pretty much\
  \ all the socials as @OnCallGM, and I tend to answer when summoned on several Discord\
  \ channels. Outside of TTRPGs, I have a stack of miniatures I need to get back to\
  \ painting… so many miniatures…</p> \n     <br> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
