  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Chris Willrich</p> \n   <h2>Chapter 1: A Vagabond and\
  \ a Gentleman</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">The clank and whir of infernal machinery called Gideon Gull back from\
  \ the music of the spheres. At first he thought the din was dragging him down to\
  \ Hell, but in a way it was worse. He woke up on the Dog's Teeth.</span></p> \n\
  \    <p>As he sorted the mechanical noise from the pulse of his throbbing head,\
  \ Gull's namesakes scattered around him, foiled in their efforts to pry last night's\
  \ crusty bread from his death-grip. Since making a home on these coastal islands,\
  \ Gull had become used to the squawking scavengers. They were an honest crowd of\
  \ greedyguts, and their voices possessed a kind of desperate music. In any case,\
  \ he liked them better than his human and near-human neighbors.</p> \n    <p><i>Better\
  \ get up, Gideon, he thought, before one of those neighbors knifes you.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>The thought was a prophetic one, for when Gull rose blinking in the tentative\
  \ gray dawn, he saw the dead man.</p> \n    <p>The corpse and the ongoing mechanical\
  \ racket were both located across a tide-covered waterway. Gull beheld the dark\
  \ cloak and sprawled limbs of the former, facedown on the shore. Meanwhile the latter\
  \ boomed from the high windows of the great castle looming above the body. For a\
  \ moment Gull had the eerie impression that the carcass was a sacrifice to some\
  \ clattering stone god.</p> \n    <p>The mechanical sound ceased, and what passed\
  \ for silence returned to the Dog's Teeth. Amid the screeches and ripple of waves\
  \ and the stirrings of work in the harbor city of Cassomir, Gull cast a look over\
  \ his shoulder, nibbled a bit of the bread in his left hand, swirled the nearly\
  \ empty bottle in his right. The look reassured him that the various vagabonds and\
  \ thugs who occupied these islands were either sleeping off the night's adventures\
  \ or hatching new plans, and that he was unobserved. The bread nearly cut his lips,\
  \ but the combination of food and pain helped revive his wits. The bottle held just\
  \ one crimson drop, the same color as the cheerful red hat pictured on the torn\
  \ label—a reminder of his home in Andoran, a handful of miles and years of broken\
  \ promises away.</p> \n    <p>The past was gone. He sucked out the last drop and\
  \ tossed the bottle. Hands itching for his lost harp, Gideon Gull took another look\
  \ at the corpse. He shivered from more than the morning chill. That's a nice cloak,\
  \ he thought.</p> \n    <blockquote> <i>I'm halfway down the road to dead</i>\n\
  \     <br> <i>Armed with a bottle and crusty bread.</i>\n     <br> <i>And friend,\
  \ the best that I can see</i>\n     <br> <i>Is that you're doing worse than me.</i>\n\
  \     <br> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>As he walked through the knee-high tidewaters\
  \ toward the mainland, Gull was already thinking through a tune for his bitter ballad,\
  \ something spare and sharp, far removed from the celestial sounds of his dream.\
  \ Once he'd followed such dreams to the bustling squares of Andoran and beyond to\
  \ the glittering manors of Taldor. Now he'd hit bottom in this border city between,\
  \ and he was learning that his true nation was the Dog's Teeth outside this Taldan\
  \ navy town, and his true calling the songs the dogs of the Teeth preferred.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> <i>You wore a cloak so fine</i>\n     <br> <i>I wore a reek\
  \ of wine.</i>\n     <br> <i>I'd say our places are reversed,</i>\n     <br> <i>But\
  \ dead man, you're no longer cursed...</i>\n     <br> \n    </blockquote> \n   \
  \ <p>The sandy shore was covered in a hash-pattern of webbed seagull prints, like\
  \ a carpet woven by a weaver with a mania for threes. Gull shooed the birds away,\
  \ and although he looked nothing like his family's emblem, what with his haystack\
  \ of blond hair and his sun-parched gangly limbs, he could squawk with the best\
  \ of them.</p> \n    <p>Alone, he bent over the pale, dark-haired body. He made\
  \ the sign of the antlers and checked for a pulse. But the man was cold and his\
  \ spirit gone, and no servant of the good god Erastil clomped forth to gore Gideon\
  \ Gull. He took this as permission.</p> \n    <p>For the cloak was indeed beautiful.\
  \ It reminded Gull of opera cloaks he'd seen in the capital, its strange purple\
  \ material silky soft but warm to the touch like velvet. Golden designs swirled\
  \ about it with strange interweaving patterns that drew the eye into endless labyrinths.\
  \ Even soaked by the waters, the material looked vibrant, and where the dim sunlight\
  \ had hit it, the cloak was already dry. Only a small rip testified to the violence\
  \ that occasioned this find. The tear matched a gash in the dead man's shirt, with\
  \ a deep knife-wound beneath.</p> \n    <p>Almost as an afterthought did Gull search\
  \ the man's pockets for coin—gold Andoren sails, oddly enough, and what's more there\
  \ were six, enough for some high living.</p> \n    <p>If he was living high, he\
  \ thought, he should have a nice cloak, torn in the back or not. He put it on.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The wine-haze and dog-tiredness seemed to bleed away like harbor fog\
  \ beneath the sun. He stood and tied off his cloak in one swift movement. The rocks\
  \ and sands around him came into sharper focus. Shore-grass twisted on the breeze,\
  \ and sand fleas danced—and boot steps sloshed and crunched their way to shore.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He turned to see three ruffians approaching from the Teeth.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Off to the opera, Gull?\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>Eutharic is the sneering lieutenant of the lord of\
  \ the Teeth.\n    </div> \n    <p>He knew these three, two Taldans named Eutharic\
  \ and Adamantius, and a wanderer from the Mammoth Lords' lands named Thok. Folk\
  \ declared Thok got his name from the sound his only real possession—the improbably\
  \ big tree branch he carried everywhere—made when connecting with a target. They\
  \ said he rarely failed to produce that sound. It was probably an apocryphal story,\
  \ but Thok never tried to correct it, nor communicated at all save to grin whenever\
  \ he had the opportunity to make that sound.</p> \n    <p>Adamantius was hardly\
  \ less intimidating. The man was wrapped in salt-brined leather armor, and what\
  \ one could see of his skin was a strange blend of scars and tattoos, the artwork\
  \ portraying monstrous claws and tails erupting from the old wounds, as though the\
  \ depths of Adamantius were akin to the demonic Abyss.</p> \n    <p>Eutharic was\
  \ the brains of the trio, a lieutenant of Tarik the Unclean himself, unofficial\
  \ lord of the Teeth. Eutharic was only unthreatening by comparison with his colleagues.\
  \ Thin, taller even than the barbarian, the man exhibited nothing overtly menacing\
  \ other than the clammy calculation written all over his sneering face. It was Eutharic\
  \ who had spoken, and Gull knew immediately it had been foolish to assume this loot\
  \ was unobserved.</p> \n    <p>The smart move now would be to offer the cloak and\
  \ some coin to Eutharic. Gull would still come out ahead. Maybe he'd even earn a\
  \ little gratitude from Tarik's organization.</p> \n    <p>The deal was upon his\
  \ lips, and his body was starting its descent into the correct amount of cringing,\
  \ when something peculiar came over him.</p> \n    <p>Gull stood up straight as\
  \ a martial flagpole and said, \"I might be. I might not. I haven't decided how\
  \ to enjoy my salvage.\"</p> \n    <p>Eutharic looked amazed. \"Your salvage? What\
  \ washes up on the Dog's Teeth is Tarik's salvage. Give it up, minstrel, and sing\
  \ us a ditty, and maybe Thok'll only thok you once.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull knew about\
  \ now he ought to be placating the man. All the loot and a round of \"The Qadiran's\
  \ Winsome Widow\" might save him from some broken bones. But something buried within\
  \ him, something like good Andoran steel, rebelled.</p> \n    <p>He thrust out an\
  \ imperious finger.</p> \n    <p>\"Then you ought to be about Tarik's business,\
  \ Eutharic, for <i>there</i> are the Dog's Teeth. <i>Here</i> is the very wall of\
  \ Grayguard Castle, where Gideon Gull has dared to strike. And what Gull has risked\
  \ his life to claim, <i>Gull keeps</i>.\"</p> \n    <p>By the time he reached <i>Gull\
  \ keeps</i>, his voice was booming nearly as loud as the surf on the outer reaches\
  \ of the islets and the strand. The ruffians stood amazed; even Thok's eyebrows\
  \ rose. Gull felt then almost as though he were two individuals: one who blazed\
  \ with righteous fury at the threat to his lawful salvage, and the other who fully\
  \ expected to be gutted and crushed beside the corpse at his feet.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You... what?\" managed Eutharic, too startled even to sneer.</p> \n    <p>Knowing\
  \ this was his last chance, Gull raised his hands to implore the thugs to break\
  \ only a few bones.</p> \n    <p>Yet something deep and dark as his hometown woods\
  \ reared up snarling in Gull, and told him no.</p> \n    <p>And as his fingers rose\
  \ they did not spread in supplication, but began tracing imaginary designs in the\
  \ air as he'd seen wizards or bards do now and again. Deep in his throat he gurgled\
  \ out nonsense words thick with consonants. \"<i>Mrrglurrg rumdiggity belchighast\
  \ blurff! Glark-snaarfl aftblast gassbaggen floof!</i>\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's a spell,\"\
  \ shouted Eutharic, rushing three paces back, and Adamantius and Thok followed suit,\
  \ the first crouching low to present a smaller target, the second cursing with the\
  \ old contempt of his people for civilization and its wizardry. For there was yet\
  \ about Gideon Gull the reputation of a bard, for all that he'd never truly mastered\
  \ bardic lore, let alone bardic magic.</p> \n    <p>Astonished that his bluff had\
  \ worked, Gull bowed, tossed a gold coin over the trio's heads, and ran like a corsair\
  \ in a fair wind.</p> \n    <p>Gull did not stop to scream over the toe he stubbed\
  \ while rounding the castle wall and scrambling over the breakwater into the town.\
  \ Nor did he take much notice of his surroundings until he was gasping in the stone\
  \ streets of the district of Grayguard's Shadow near the Admiral's Barbershop and\
  \ attracting the stares of two constables.</p> \n    <p>Little good could come of\
  \ such attention, so Gull staggered into the shop, struggling to breathe normally.\
  \ Familiar faces looked up. Though Gull was not a frequent customer, sometimes he\
  \ came here to sing a shanty or two and earn a shave for his trouble.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>He expected a friendly grunt from Bosun Rack the barber, curt indifference\
  \ from the Taldan sailor in the chair, and easy waves from the laborers waiting\
  \ for shaves. Instead he got immediate attention.</p> \n    <p>\"Mr. Gull,\" said\
  \ Bosun Rack, pausing with his cream-dabbed blade in the air, sounding as if he\
  \ still had two arms and was serving aboard ship. \"What can we do for you?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Gull searched the tone for sarcasm and found none. The laborers straightened\
  \ in their chairs. The sailor, half-shaved, sat up, studied Gull, and said, \"You\
  \ seem to be in a hurry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to go first?\"</p> \n    <p>Gull\
  \ felt as stupefied as the thugs he'd just left behind. But with constables watching\
  \ outside, he thought a shave would be a good choice about now. He thanked the sailor\
  \ and sat down, saying, \"Nothing fancy, Bosun. Don't want to put on airs.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Bosun Rack brushed cream onto Gull's face and chuckled.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Full shave, please,\" Gull said meekly. Bosun Rack was acting as though Gull were\
  \ still a noted musician, the toast of the capital even, not a washed-up minstrel\
  \ in a military town. This was becoming an odd day indeed. Maybe the strange mechanical\
  \ noises of dawn had disturbed everyone's dreams, left them funny in the head. Soon\
  \ his companions would notice the reek rising from his clothes. The sailor cleared\
  \ his throat—here it came.</p> \n    <p>\"Begging your pardon,\" the sailor said,\
  \ \"but are you singing at the admiral's birthday party? It's tonight, you know.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I... had not planned to.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, well. That singer,\
  \ Corvine Gale—didn't you used to do duets? She'll be there, I hear.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Bosun Rack finished the shave while Gull blinked his surprise, and insisted\
  \ on washing and trimming Gull's hair too, a task fit for a combat veteran. The\
  \ thought of Corvine darted through Gull's mind like a crow diving for corn. She'd\
  \ been about the last good thing to happen to him. And like all good things, it\
  \ had ended it badly. Bosun Rack ended too, by cajoling Gull for a song.</p> \n\
  \    <p>So Gull entertained the group with a rendition of \"What Shall We Do with\
  \ a Sober Sailor?\" and the tapping and hooting brought the constables inside. They\
  \ tapped and hooted too, and clapped Gull on the back as he left. Gull smiled, bowed,\
  \ and got away from the barbershop before their sea-fevers broke.</p> \n    <p>What\
  \ was happening here? By odds he ought to be locked up or bleeding. One thing was\
  \ sure, he had gold in his pocket, and close by the castle was no place to spend\
  \ it. He needed a good meal—and perhaps some paid companionship? He hummed a tune\
  \ as his feet took him toward the rowdier district of Admiral's Fen, in search of\
  \ the sign of the twisted-tailed mermaid.</p> \n    <blockquote> <i>Half-dead man\
  \ with a dead man's cloak</i>\n     <br> <i>Where do you think you're going?</i>\n\
  \     <br> <i>Pocket full of gold from a man that's cold</i>\n     <br> <i>Dead\
  \ on this fine morning?</i>\n     <br> <i>Off to the Admiral's Fen, my friend</i>\n\
  \     <br> <i>Where streets are ripe and muddy</i>\n     <br> <i>'Cause dead man's\
  \ gold is better sold</i>\n     <br> <i>For wine than left all bloody.</i>\n   \
  \  <br> <i>Half-dead man with a dead man's cloak</i>\n     <br> <i>Do you not have\
  \ pity?</i>\n     <br> <i>Well, I'm still alive with gold coins five</i>\n     <br>\
  \ <i>And I'm busy with the living.</i>\n     <br> <i>And I'm busy with the living.</i>\n\
  \     <br> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>He was not fool enough to drink at this\
  \ hour, of course, and the gold he offered the barkeep at the Knotty Mermaid wasn't\
  \ bloody. Nor was Gull a murderer as his new song implied. Nevertheless he resolved\
  \ not to sing it here. One coin bought him eggs and sausages and bread and a seat\
  \ beside the common room's sunnier windows. The windows were of straightened and\
  \ polished strips of ram's horn, which let the light bleed in all golden and glorious\
  \ but more importantly kept Gull hidden from the street. A return to the Dog's Teeth\
  \ was surely unwise, and Gull would have to find somewhere else to live. Homeless\
  \ men in Cassomir had a way of getting press-ganged. The Knotty Mermaid had rooms,\
  \ but Tarik's operation had fingers in Admiral's Fen. Perhaps Gull could sing in\
  \ the streets up in Abbey Green. He was feeling energized, with many new ideas for\
  \ songs. Something peculiar was happening.</p> \n    <p>From outside, the voice\
  \ of Eutharic cut through Gull's thoughts. \"Word is,\" Tarik's man was saying,\
  \ \"there's a foreign agent in there.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Indeed?\" said a haughty\
  \ voice. \"We'll handle it.\"</p> \n    <p>Knowing some sort of officialdom was\
  \ entering the inn, Gull hastened to the bar and used his new line of credit to\
  \ get quill, ink, and paper from the tavern keeper. \"Of course, Master Gull,\"\
  \ said the man. There was no irony, no sarcasm. There were no complaints about his\
  \ stench from the shipwrights preparing for a long Toilday. It was almost as if\
  \ Gull were a respectable citizen.</p> \n    <p>As if in answer to that thought,\
  \ a group of sailors strode into the Knotty Mermaid, all dressed in mismatched rich\
  \ clothing, and their leader did indeed have a whiskered chin. This motley crew\
  \ received a rousing spontaneous toast from the laborers, for it appeared they were\
  \ among the corsairs who operated out of Cassomir. Gull belatedly lifted his tankard\
  \ of water, but he drew attention as the privateers claimed a table.</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ tried to ignore their stares and focused on his work. If he appeared to be just\
  \ what he really was—a musician come into some luck—perhaps all would be well.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So he worked out the details of the dark ballad that had rattled through\
  \ his mind since seeing the cloak's dead owner. Gull had no superstitions about\
  \ projecting himself into his work, and gleefully put his narrator into a noose.\
  \ He'd not worked this swiftly in a long time. Why had he not composed more? It\
  \ only went to show that fooling yourself you were a musician was easier if you\
  \ did it every day. Only the conversation of the corsairs impeded him, for he caught\
  \ distracting snatches of talk from their table.</p> \n    <p>\"Wrong wrong wrong,\"\
  \ the bearded man was saying, and Gull knew him for the man who'd spoken with the\
  \ thug Eutharic outside. \"You're all wrong. I'm wrong too, but I look better when\
  \ I do it.\"</p> \n    <p>There were chuckles from the shipyard workers. More came\
  \ in, and waved at the corsairs.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm just saying,\" answered one\
  \ of seamen, \"the Chelish are chumps. Making a pact with Hell, well it's about\
  \ as stupid as getting a loan from my uncle Wulf.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, no,\" said\
  \ the bearded man, \"the Chelish are just recognizing their true value. Look, a\
  \ Taldan vessel is worth, what, ten Chelish ships?\"</p> \n    <p>There were snarls\
  \ of agreement.</p> \n    <p>\"And a Taldan corsair is worth any ten Chelish fighting\
  \ men?\"</p> \n    <p>There was laughing affirmation.</p> \n    <p>\"And a Taldan\
  \ lady in bed is worth any ten Chelish women in bed?\"</p> \n    <p>That gave the\
  \ men a moment's hard consideration, but patriotism won out.</p> \n    <p>\"And\
  \ so,\" concluded the bearded man, \"while any of us would think our souls a matter\
  \ of high price, for a Chelaxian it may not be much to speak of. 'My soul for a\
  \ pint! My soul for a chair by the window! My soul for sausages and a good cloak!'\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The corsairs' laugher had a pointedness to it, and Gull snapped out\
  \ of his ballad (<i>sometimes you got to do</i>, he was writing, <i>what you got\
  \ to rue</i>) and realized the pirates believed they were goading him. He looked\
  \ up, bewildered. They were all looking back at him, expectantly.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I am sorry, good sir,\" said the bearded man with a deep nod. \"I did not mean to\
  \ <i>offend</i>. I merely wished to cheer these good sailors after their hard weeks\
  \ harrying foreign merchantmen. Why, just three days ago they sank a Ch—ah, but\
  \ again I risk offense.\" He smiled, and made a fair impression of a dandified crocodile.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Excuse me,\" Gull said. \"You believe me to be Chelish?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>The smile stayed fixed as a steady blade. \"You are not, sir?\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Anger flushed in Gideon Gull. \"You speak to a free man of Andoran. Many a\
  \ Chelish bottom still wears the imprint of Andoren boots.\"</p> \n    <p>That earned\
  \ laughter from the other tables. The corsairs glanced around them in surprise.\
  \ Their leader narrowed his eyes. \"I could have sworn that cloak was of Chelish\
  \ make.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps. Do you not also wear clothes taken from Cheliax?\
  \ Or from Qadira, Osirion, or Nex? Or, dare I say it, from Andoran?\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"The sea provides,\" said the leader, scratching his bearded chin as though\
  \ sizing up an attack.</p> \n    <p><i>So it does</i>, Gull thought, pulling his\
  \ cloak tighter around him. \"Our lands are not at war, and I may overlook the presence\
  \ of a familiar style of red hat on one of your companions, my friend. But do not\
  \ insult me again by calling me Chelish. I may be a fool, but I am not a damned\
  \ fool.\"</p> \n    <p>The shipyard workers rewarded him with laughter and a few\
  \ raised mugs. This response clearly annoyed the bearded man, who was used to adulation.\
  \ That made Gull smile. He decided to finish things off. \"Let me buy the heroes\
  \ of Cassomir a round.\"</p> \n    <p>The privateers seemed rather appreciative,\
  \ and the one with the red hat tipped it to Gull, but their leader's face became\
  \ more set, his gaze more appraising. \"Sebastian Tambour takes what he wants. He\
  \ needs no bribe from foreign agents.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull knew the same Sebastian\
  \ Tambour. The man was first mate on the <i>Happenstance</i>, the current flagship\
  \ of Jean Coromant's crew of corsairs, who operated out of Cassomir with the full\
  \ blessing of Taldor.</p> \n    <p>As with his encounter with the trio at the Dog's\
  \ Teeth, Gull knew he really ought to be quaking now. Instead he was furious.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In an exaggerated rendition of Tambour's voice, Gull said, \"Sebastian\
  \ Tambour has a stick up his backside. Sebastian Tambour is too proud to let his\
  \ men drink.\"</p> \n    <p>Now the guffaws spread to Tambour's own table.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The man stood. \"I will show you a stick, dog. Let us settle this outside,\
  \ like men.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I will be glad to do so,\" said Gull, turning away\
  \ and taking a long swig, \"as soon as any men arrive.\"</p> \n    <p>The laughter\
  \ was this time confined to the laborers, as the corsairs all frowned at the jibe.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So it was that the whole group descended on Gull.</p> \n    <p>Slammed\
  \ into the table, his already-aching head concluding that whatever new confidence\
  \ had bewitched him this day had not made him a skilled combatant, he punched and\
  \ wriggled in a futile attempt to escape.</p> \n    <p>All at once he was dropped\
  \ and fell with a thud upon the floor.</p> \n    <p>The tavern had rallied to his\
  \ defense.</p> \n    <p>The laborers had set upon the corsairs—the very heroes of\
  \ Cassomir—with fists and mugs and plates and candlesticks. The barkeep was gesturing\
  \ him over. Gull scrambled on all fours behind the bar.</p> \n    <p>\"Quickly,\
  \ man,\" said the owner. \"The fog's rolled in. If you get out by the roof, you'll\
  \ likely escape. They're just drunk, I'm sure, else they'd not have preyed upon\
  \ a fine gentleman adventurer like yourself. You'll be safe once they sleep it off.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Yes, yes,\" Gull said, \"of course. Lead the way, good man.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>They ascended the stairs and the owner unlatched and shoved a creaky\
  \ window and worked a hand-crank to extend a plank toward a neighboring building.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"This sort of thing happens often?\" said Gull.</p> \n    <p>\"Many\
  \ of my clients need a discreet escape route. I have an arrangement with the neighboring\
  \ landlord.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull fished out one of his gold pieces, handed it to\
  \ the man. \"Gideon Gull will remember you,\" Gull said. The barkeep winked and\
  \ shooed him out the door.</p> \n    <p>Gideon Gull stepped outside into mist and\
  \ mystery.</p> \n    <p><i>Gideon Gull, gentleman adventurer, that is</i>. He liked\
  \ the sound of that. This cloak had brought him luck. He wrapped it tighter around\
