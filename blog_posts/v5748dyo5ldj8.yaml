  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>A Tomb of Winter's Plunder</h1> \n   <p>by\
  \ Tim Pratt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Coils in the Dark</h2> \n   <p>Rodrick struck\
  \ off the dead girl's head with his sword, the blade clanging against the stone\
  \ floor as it severed her neck cleanly. Her head rolled until the hilt of the dagger\
  \ hit the floor and arrested its motion. Alaeron choked back a scream. Had the scoundrel\
  \ gone mad?</p> \n   <p>Rodrick turned the dead girl's torso over with his foot,\
  \ flopping her over on her belly and revealing her back—</p> \n   <p>—which was\
  \ nothing but a hollow shell lined with wood, like the interior of a rotten tree\
  \ or a walnut shell. She was an emptiness. </p> \n   <p>\"Some kind of monster,\"\
  \ Rodrick said. With the tip of his sword, he prodded at a lump in the back of the\
  \ girl’s skirt, lifting its hem just far enough to reveal a tail like a fox’s. \"\
  Guarding the barrow, I'm sure. I knew there was something unnatural about her right\
  \ away—I liked her, and wanted to protect her, and didn't think at all about how\
  \ valuable she would be to certain slave traders of my acquaintance. I knew she\
  \ must be bewitching me somehow.\" He glanced at Alaeron. \"I'm too good at being\
  \ charming to be easily charmed myself.\"</p> \n   <p>Rodrick, charming? Ha. \"\
  I've heard of creatures like this,\" Alaeron said. \"She's fey. Huldra, I think\
  \ they're called, or hilders—but they are creatures of the far north. She may not\
  \ have been a guardian of this tomb, you know. She could have been a prisoner, her\
  \ spirit bound to some cursed or magical object in the barrow—\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Monster,\" Rodrick said. \"Now a dead monster. Why are we still talking about her?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I just prefer not to kill, without provocation, creatures who are\
  \ capable of holding a conversation with me,\" Alaeron said. \"She may have been\
  \ charming us because she needed help, and wanted us to save her—\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I suppose that's why you didn't kill her, and I did. Let's go. There must be loot\
  \ here somewhere.\"</p> \n   <p>\"But why would a huldra be here at all?\" Alaeron\
  \ muttered. \"They're from the north, the lands of the Mammoth Lords, or the White\
  \ Witches, or the—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Linnorm Kings,\" Rodrick said, bending to retrieve\
  \ his dagger from the huldra's eye. \"Yes, Simeon said something about that. Apparently\
  \ when Brant was a boy, raiders from the Land of the Linnorm Kings laid waste to\
  \ his little fishing village. Brant survived, nursed vengeance in his heart, and\
  \ so forth. When he was grown, he led an expedition to raid the raiders. You have\
  \ to admire the old boy's confidence, don't you? Apparently they ended up exploring\
  \ some ruin called the Spire of Snow or the Frostbite Citadel or something similar,\
  \ slaying a dragon inside—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Linnorms aren't dragons, exactly,\" Alaeron\
  \ said. \"Related, probably, but—\"</p> \n   <p>Rodrick rolled his eyes. \"Fine,\
  \ they slew the linnorm, though it killed or cursed everyone else in the party,\
  \ and Brant alone escaped unscathed. He came back with all manner of valuables,\
  \ not just the gold and jewels that made the family fortune but rarer things: a\
  \ sword with a blade of ice, a bell that summons blizzards, a petrified linnorm\
  \ egg, a magical ring that lets you conjure a mystical twin to do your bidding,\
  \ and other wonders. That's what old Brant took to the grave with him, along with\
  \ a hoard of gold and jewels, or so the story goes. If even half of it's true, I'll\
  \ be a very wealthy man.\"</p> \n   <p>\"We will be, you mean.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Of course.\" Rodrick didn't even bother trying to sound sincere.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  That explains the huldra, at least. She must have been bound here, or enslaved to\
  \ serve Brant even in death, or—\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> Uncle Brant hasn't aged so well.\n   </div> \n   <p>\"\
  Dead monsters bore me,\" Rodrick said. \"Live ones are more interesting. Let's see\
  \ if we can find some.\"</p> \n   <p>They proceeded into the depths of the barrow,\
  \ following the twisting corridors, and investigating a couple of dead-ends that\
  \ terminated abruptly in deep pits. Even along what seemed to be the proper route\
  \ there were traps, more ingenious than the spiked log, but Rodrick proved adept\
  \ at spotting them. They encountered a shelf bearing stone skulls that spat acid,\
  \ an ordinary-looking room that Rodrick said would have flensed them alive if he\
  \ hadn't discovered and pressed some hidden buttons to deactivate the concealed\
  \ blades in the walls, and a door that sprouted dozens of bone spears when Rodrick\
  \ prodded the wood with his sword. Nothing Alaeron couldn't have coped with himself,\
  \ of course, but it was nice to have a strapping thief to handle the stray acid\
  \ droplets instead.</p> \n   <p>\"We make a fine team,\" Alaeron said, after Rodrick\
  \ set off a bear trap with a tossed stone.</p> \n   <p>\"You've done exactly nothing\
  \ except open a door,\" Rodrick said. \"In that respect, you're no worse a partner\
  \ than Simeon was, I suppose.\" He slipped into another chamber, and whistled.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Alaeron joined him in the next room, and in the lantern's pool of light\
  \ saw part of a massive stone throne, occupied by a skeleton dressed in elaborate\
  \ black armor. They'd reached the main burial chamber, then, and after only a few\
  \ hours—these modern tombs were so much more manageable than the vast crypts of\
  \ the ancients. </p> \n   <p>\"There are torches on the walls.\" Rodrick lit a taper\
  \ from his lantern and carried it through the dark, igniting two torches and filling\
  \ the room with flickering light.</p> \n   <p>The throne stood in the center of\
  \ the room, and behind it were stone shelves and platforms holding... well, the\
  \ wreckage of smashed treasure chests, mostly. Bits of shattered wood and twisted\
  \ metal. A scattering of coins and precious gems remained, probably enough to buy\
  \ a small house in Almas, but not the riches they'd expected. Alaeron wondered what\
  \ sort of remarkable valuables the room had originally contained, if the original\
  \ looters hadn't bothered to stoop to pick up these gold coins and jewels. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Someone got here first!\" Rodrick said. \"But how? None of the traps\
  \ were sprung, the doors were unbreached, I don't see how—\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron\
  \ squinted at the shadows at the far end of the room, then picked up the lantern\
  \ and advanced. \"Look at the wall,\" he said, holding the lamp aloft. </p> \n \
  \  <p>He and Rodrick stared together at the great hole that had been smashed through\
  \ the wall, a ragged circle easily ten feet to a side. Alaeron pushed the lantern\
  \ through the hole, revealing a tunnel of packed dirt that angled down and away.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Graverobbers digging a tunnel to break in, perhaps?\" Rodrick said.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Or it might be the work of interlopers from the Darklands,\" Alaeron\
  \ said.</p> \n   <p>Rodrick chewed his lip. \"We should investigate. If there's\
  \ any chance of finding the treasure... But to take a light into those tunnels could\
  \ be dangerous. If there are subterranean monsters down there, light would be a\
  \ beacon to them.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I have a potion that lets me see in the dark,\"\
  \ Alaeron said. \"It's rather more expensive than a torch, which is why I didn't\
  \ use it before—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Excellent. We'll both drink it.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I could go down on my own,\" Alaeron began, but Rodrick cut him off.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Ha. And find the treasure and a convenient path to the surface? No. Let's take the\
  \ potion together.\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron shrugged, took a vial from his pack, drank\
  \ down half of it—it tasted of carrots, mainly—and then handed it to Rodrick. The\
  \ extract would have no effect on the thief, since like most alchemists' preparations\
  \ it only worked for the creator, but he'd let Rodrick figure that out on his own.\
  \ The thief drank, made a face, and handed back the vial. </p> \n   <p>\"In we go,\"\
  \ Alaeron said, and slipped into the tunnel.</p> \n   <p>\"I'm not sure it's working,\"\
  \ Rodrick said doubtfully behind him, but Alaeron shushed him. His own vision had\
  \ already altered, allowing him to see the tunnel clearly, albeit in black-and-white.\
  \ Roots poked down through the top of the tunnel, and an earthworm dropped from\
  \ the ceiling before Alaeron's face and wriggled away.</p> \n   <p>The passage was\
  \ angled steeply downward, and crumbling—it seemed more like an animal's burrow\
  \ than a tunnel hewn by human hands. Alaeron had terrible visions of being buried\
  \ in tons of dirt as he slid forward, going as silently as possible, trying not\
  \ to lose his footing and roll down. The tunnel ended abruptly, in a huge cavern—\
  occupied by something almost equally huge.</p> \n   <p>A great serpentine body filled\
  \ almost the entirety of the space, its coils moving slowly in steady breath. Far\
  \ above, Alaeron thought he could discern a head, its huge eyes closed in sleep.\
  \ The chamber was filled with gold and gems and other things, most of them nestled\
  \ under the great beast's body or its huge forelegs, each digit tipped with a claw\
  \ like a greatsword.</p> \n   <p>After a long moment of staring, not even daring\
  \ to breathe, Alaeron turned and scrambled back up the tunnel, pushing past Rodrick\
  \ and clambering back into the burial chamber, where he knelt, gasping and trembling.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Rodrick arrived after him. \"Your stupid potion never worked for me. What's\
  \ wrong with you? What did you see down there?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Did you say one of\
  \ the treasures Uncle Brant brought back was a petrified linnorm egg?\" Alaeron\
  \ said.</p> \n   <p>\"So Simeon told me.\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron lifted his head and\
  \ looked into the rogue's eyes. \"The egg hatched.\"</p> \n   <p>Rodrick blinked.\
  \ \"You're lying. You're trying to trick me—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Didn't you smell it?\"\
  \ Alaeron said. \"The stink of a vast beast?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I thought that was\
  \ you,\" Rodrick said, and gave a weak smile. Alaeron laughed despite himself. The\
  \ thief sat down on one of the shelves of stone. \"Well, then. Where do we go from\
  \ here?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Out, and swiftly,\" Alaeron said.</p> \n   <p>\"You corrected\
  \ me earlier, when I called a linnorm a dragon,\" Rodrick said. \"That suggests\
  \ you know something about the beasts—more than I do, anyway.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Just\
  \ what I've read in books. I've never been farther north than the south shore of\
  \ Lake Encarthan.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Books about linnorms were presumably written by\
  \ people who survived encounters with them,\" Rodrick said reasonably. \"What did\
  \ they have to say?\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron sighed. \"They're huge, of course. Eighty,\
  \ a hundred feet long? I think it depends on the variety, and no, I don't remember\
  \ the different types, or have any idea which kind our linnorm is. It doesn't matter.\
  \ A battleaxe can kill you just as well as a mace. The beasts are intelligent, but\
  \ generally cruel—gluttonous, greedy, lovers of treasure, obviously, since it took\
  \ everything from in here into its hole. The thing must have cleaned out this chamber\
  \ when it was smaller. Made itself a nest, then grew.\" Alaeron shook his head.\
  \ \"I do remember reading that they can hibernate for centuries, for so long that\
  \ people living nearby forget they're even there, until the linnorm bursts forth\
  \ to devour everything in the surrounding landscape. For now, we’re lucky, and this\
  \ one appears to be sleeping.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I imagine news of this beast would\
  \ drive down the price of property hereabouts,\" Rodrick said thoughtfully. \"What\
  \ sort of treasures did you see in its chamber?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I hardly took a\
  \ complete inventory,\" Alaeron said. \"I saw a sword hilt protruding from beneath\
  \ its belly. Some sort of black cask, big as a sea chest, under one of its claws.\
  \ Gold, jewels, ingots of precious metal, bits of statuary... I couldn't say more\
  \ specifically. I was too busy trying to control my bowels.\" </p> \n   <p>Rodrick\
  \ stroked his chin. \"How deeply is it sleeping, do you think?\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron\
  \ stared at him. \"You can't possibly mean to go back down there and try to steal\
  \ from the monster?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Of course not,\" Rodrick said. \"I can't even\
  \ see in the dark.\" He drew his sword and smiled, showing all his teeth. \"I want\
  \ you to go down there and steal from the monster for me.\"</p> \n   <p><b>Coming\
