  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">They've reached the end of Doomsday\
  \ Dawn! The Order of the Amber Die is here to give a report of their experiences\
  \ with the last chapter of the Playtest adventure after an exciting run through\
  \ the whole thing. Did they survive or perish? Read below to find out. But! If you\
  \ want to avoid spoilers, read this a bit later after you're done with the adventure.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgdj?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part six</a> was past us, part seven of the playtest had arrived, and our record\
  \ was split at 3-3. This was it: game seven of the series. The prize for winning\
  \ was nothing less than the salvation of Golarion itself. We had been working with\
  \ the playtest for almost six months, and the atmosphere at the session felt like\
  \ the ending of some of our previous projects for the Paizo blog. Players paced,\
  \ our GM was in his zone, and there was the familiar blend of anticipation, anxiety,\
  \ and nostalgia.</p> \n     <p>On a windy autumn afternoon, we shared a feast for\
  \ heroes with enough leftovers to keep us going until the sun came up. What we didn't\
  \ know, was that our GM had purposely scheduled this scenario to be played throughout\
  \ the night—the darkest part of night—the darkness between the stars. As we laid\
  \ out our dice under the sheen of several black lights, the evidence we had acquired\
  \ from the previous six scenarios started to become all too apparent: This chapter\
  \ was almost certainly authored by James Jacobs. We were afraid to discuss it, but\
  \ knew that we'd be probably be up against some kind of Lovecraftian finale that\
  \ would not disappoint. To find our way through, we'd have to draw courage from\
  \ our experiences in <a href=\"/products/btpy8tb0\">The Enigma Vaults of Thornkeep</a>,\
  \ level sixteen of <a href=\"/threads/rzs2r5jz&amp;page=5?The-Emerald-Spire-Superdungeon-Discussion-Thread#225\"\
  >The Emerald Spire</a>, and <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lj2f?Order-of-the-Amber-Die-The-Strange-Aeons\"\
  >The Strange Aeons Experiment</a>.</p> \n     <h2>The Party</h2> \n     <p>This\
  \ part of the playtest was designed to use the same characters as <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >parts one</a> and <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgc1?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >four</a>. Initially, we had planned on using this party to discover if a lineup\
  \ without major access to healing would be able thrive in the new edition. Now we\
  \ would also get to see how well this non-traditional roster of iconics could hold\
  \ up at very high levels. Thus far, these four had experienced both a nice win and\
  \ a TPK. However, we felt good about the way they performed during the several fights\
  \ involving hard-hitting enemies in part four. For playtest purposes, the same four\
  \ OAD members played the exact same iconics as before. Also listed are the names\
  \ of each player on the team and the year each became a member of the Order (when\
  \ a player has reached 100 hours at our table).</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\

  \   </div> \n     <h2>Highlights From \"When the Stars Go Dark\"</h2> \n     <p>Not\
  \ long after entering the actual pages of a tome known as <i>The Last Theroem, </i>we\
  \ were surrounded by malignant theorems that weren't out to welcome us. This became\
  \ one of those rare moments when something happens on the table that looks just\
  \ as scary inside the game. Not long in, were left watching helplessly as our goblin\
  \ and halfling companions stood base-to-base with four gargantuan rune giant miniatures.\
  \ See our data for how it ended.</p> \n     <p>We expected to visit some strange\
  \ places at this point in our journey, and we definitely got one: a demiplane which\
  \ consisted of a desert in eternal twilight. It was empty, until a star-spawn of\
  \ Cthulhu pulled itself from a pit of infinite depth we had approached. For the\
  \ first time during the playtest, the alchemist hogged the highlight reel, pouring\
  \ on the persistent damage with <i>acid splash</i> and timely dousings of alchemist's\
  \ fire to shut down its regeneration.</p> \n     <p>Jacobs provided an epic feel\
  \ in this scenario from start to finish, and the size of the monsters repeatedly\
  \ matched the occasion. Sajan went fist-and-claw with a gargantuan dragon, in a\
  \ fight that deserved nothing less than slow-motion for its entirety. The fact that\
  \ the clash took place inside of a workshop created a heck of a mess—of the dragon.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n     <p>We're proud to report zero permanent\
  \ deaths!</p> \n     <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n     <p>To win, we needed to sever\
  \ the connection between Aucturn and Golarion, which meant desynchronizing an artifact\
  \ known as the <i>Veinstone Pendulum</i>. Opposing us in the finale was the aberration\
  \ that the wizard Ramlock had become, fully strapped with spells like <i>time stop\
  \ </i>and <i>power word kill, </i>as well as adhesive tendrils that gave a 30-foot\
  \ reach. We tried to trade points equally at first, but when our foe put down 186\
  \ damage on Seoni in a single round, we knew we were going to have to take some\
  \ risks in order to win. Lem made the call, and tried to use one of the four <i>wishes\
  \ </i>we were given against the pendulum itself. When it appeared to work, we capitalized\
  \ on the opening, and two more of us followed suit.</p> \n     <p>Final record?\
  \ A winning one.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181201-7-6.jpg\"\
