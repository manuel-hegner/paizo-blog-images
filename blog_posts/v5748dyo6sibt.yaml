  \ itemprop=\"description\">Welcome back to the OP Monthly Update! I know we missed\
  \ last month, that’s entirely my fault. I was on my honeymoon, and then we announced\
  \ a little thing called the Pathfinder Core Remaster, and by the time I came up\
  \ for air, it was already mid-May!</p> \n      <p>Luckily it’s smooth sailing now,\
  \ which is a lie, because convention season is in full swing! As I write this blog\
  \ we’re doing our final preparations for PaizoCon Online. I can’t wait for this\
  \ show, and I’m so excited for our upcoming shows like UK Games Expo and Gen Con.\
  \ Not to mention, this fall I’ll be heading to a few local conventions! More on\
  \ that soon, hopefully. For now, I’ve got a supersized OP update to deliver, so\
  \ let’s get started.</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <h2>Digital Adventure\
  \ Releases</h2> \n      <p>These adventures will be available on June 28, 2023.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eg7?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-415-In-Glorious-Battle\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-15: In Glorious Battle</em></a></p> \n     \
  \ <h3>Starfinder Society</h3> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eg8?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-603-Project-Dawn\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-03: Project Dawn</em></a><br> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eg9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-604-Secrets-Long-Submerged\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-04: Secrets Long Submerged</em></a></p> \n \
  \     <p>*part of a subscription</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Pathfinder Core Remaster</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>Last month, we announced the Pathfinder Core Remaster: an overhaul\
  \ and update of our Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset, a necessary but difficult\
  \ maneuver given the events of recent months. I am sure that for many of you, the\
  \ first question was “how will this affect Pathfinder Society?” The short answer\
  \ is: we don’t know yet! The longer answer is that these books literally don’t exist\
  \ fully yet; they won’t go to the printer for another month or so. Until they do,\
  \ we can’t begin to answer these questions.</p> \n      <p>Rest assured that as\
  \ soon as we can, the OP team will be diving into the new rule changes to figure\
  \ out how to make the updates as seamless as possible for the community. For now,\
  \ I ask for your patience on this topic. There will be many questions to answer\
  \ in the weeks ahead, but we’ve got a steady hand on the metaphorical tiller.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h2>FAQ and Boon Updates</h2> \n      <p>In the quiet time\
  \ before convention prep, the Pathfinder Society developers and I had some time\
  \ to sit down and hammer out some updates to boons available in the boon store,\
  \ as well as to handle some FAQs for the program. The full updates are available\
  \ on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq\">FAQ page</a>, but here’\
  s a summary of the changes:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>The Second Chance boon\
  \ has been updated to indicate that purchasing and using this boon also covers the\
  \ cost of recovering your body and any lost possessions if necessary. If a character\
  \ is undead (such as a skeleton), they can use this boon to benefit from a similar\
  \ ritual to restore themselves to their previously undead state.</li> \n       <li>Similarly,\
  \ an FAQ clarifies that in the event that your character ends a scenario alive but\
  \ otherwise inaccessible (such as being imprisoned or transported to another plane),\
  \ the Second Chance boon can be purchased and used to return your character to safety.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Another FAQ clarifies which version of an item or character option\
  \ to use in the event the option is reprinted in another book. In short, a hardcover\
  \ printing of an option is considered the standard option unless otherwise stated.\
  \ This applies to both Pathfinder and Starfinder Society.</li> \n       <li>The\
  \ Secondary Initiation boon has also been clarified to cover how it handles entry\
  \ requirements for organizations (it handwaves them as occurring offscreen) and\
  \ which ranks PCs can choose to be within organizations (anything reasonable is\
  \ fair game, but no, your PCs are not fourth-mark Firebrands).</li> \n       <li>Finally,\
  \ we have issued one minor clarification to the Magic Arrow feat from the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, which you can find on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Character Options page</a> as normal.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Starfinder\
  \ Society Year 6 Updates</h2> \n      <h3>Program Changes</h3> \n      <p>SFS Year\
  \ 6 launched at PaizoCon Online! Hopefully, anyway; I’m writing this before the\
  \ show, so if a dinosaur attacks, someone let future me know. The following Starfinder\
  \ species are now considered “always available”: gnoll, hanakan, kiirinta, quorlu,\
  \ raxilite, shimreen. Players are free to build characters of these species as often\
  \ as they like; as always, characters with an Admittance Boon for these species\
  \ gain an additional +2 to one ability score immediately. </p> \n      <p>The Achievement\
  \ Point cost for a boon to play a character of the following species has been reduced\
  \ to 80 Achievement Points: astriapi, cephalume, contemplative, trox, uplifted bear,\
  \ urog. Meanwhile, the following species are now playable with the purchase of a\
  \ boon from the online Boon Store: entu colony, huitz’plina, grippli, kitsune, kobold,\
  \ psacynoid, samsaran, scyphozoan, trinir, and tryziarka.</p> \n      <p>Finally,\
  \ a few more boons have been added to the Boon Store! Starfinders who enjoy having\
  \ a permanent emblem of their position can now purchase the Marked Starfinder boon\
  \ for 2 AcP after playing at least one session to gain a Society Subdermal Graft.\
  \ Additionally, characters can now undergo a Training Montage (or Extended Training\
  \ Montage) to retrain their character’s abilities! These provide more robust retraining\
  \ options than the previously available mnemonic editor. Full text of these boons,\
  \ as always, can be found on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq\"\
  >Starfinder Society FAQ page</a>.</p> \n      <p>The <a href=\"https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/Starfinder-Society-Guide-To-Organized-Play\"\
  ><em>Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society</em></a> has been updated with\
  \ all these changes, as well as a brand-new overhaul and visual upgrade! Incredible\
  \ thanks to Jared Thaler and Peter Nalepa, both of whom have worked very hard to\
  \ make the guide more user-friendly and accessible. They’ve created a <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43to3?Season-6-Starfinder-Society-Guide-to\">feedback\
  \ thread on the forums</a> for comments or questions.</p> \n      <h3>First Seeker\
  \ Election</h3> \n      <p>Last month we formally announced <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eji?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-606-Tomorrows-Seekers\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #6-06: Tomorrow’s Seekers</em></a>! This scenario will allow\
  \ you to meet the four PCs who were selected to vie for the title of First Seeker.\
  \ You may note my name on the cover as the author; I’m so excited for this adventure\
  \ and for you all to meet these wonderful colorful characters!</p> \n      <p>Look\
  \ for some upcoming blogs where we’ll be revealing the candidates, their platforms,\
  \ and a bit more about them. Campaign season begins when the ballot opens at Gen\
  \ Con (August 1–4), and the voting period will close in mid-October. If you want\
  \ to cast your vote, don’t miss your chance to play the scenario in that two-month\
  \ period!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n      <p>One of the reasons\
  \ we could get away with missing April’s blog was that it was a pretty quiet month\
  \ on the release front! Luckily, we’ve got some new toys for you this month!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For Pathfinder Society, this month’s new release is the brand-new standalone\
  \ adventure,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e50\"><em>The Enmity\
  \ Cycle</em></a>. The sanctioning documents for this adventure are just waiting\
  \ to be exported; once they are, we’ll be sure to add them to the product page.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>On the Starfinder side, the new hardcover rulebook <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e4y\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Ports of Call</em></a> has been released and sanctioned for play!\
  \ Visit the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\">Character\
  \ Options page</a> for all the details. While you’re there, why not check out the\
  \ new options from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftHackers\"\
  >Drift Hackers</a><a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftHackers\"\
  > Adventure Path</a>, which are also now sanctioned! Chronicle sheets for players\
  \ and GMs will also be available on the product page for the AP as soon as they’\
  re exported.</p> \n      <p>Coming up next, we’ll be getting sanctioning documents\
  \ out for the Free RPG Day adventures (foreshadowing for the next section)! After\
  \ that, for Pathfinder Society we’ve got the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/stolenfate\"\
  >Stolen Fate</a><a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/stolenfate\"\
  > Adventure Path</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ehs?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Highhelm\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Highhelm</em></a> on the docket, and Starfinder Society\
  \ will be pretty quiet until the fall!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Free RPG Day</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>June 24 is <a href=\"https://freerpgday.com/\">Free RPG Day</a> here\
  \ in the United States! This initiative provides retailers with exclusive access\
  \ to free RPG products from a number of companies, including Paizo. We have two\
  \ adventures in this year’s kit: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eio?Pathfinder-Adventure-A-Few-Flowers-More\"\
  ><em>A Few Flowers More</em></a>for Pathfinder and &lt;em&gt;<em>Operation: Seaside\
  \ Park</em> for Starfinder</p> \n      <p>If your store is participating in this\
  \ event, sanctioning documents and chronicle sheets will be available prior to the\
  \ event! You’ll be able to get credit for your Organized Play characters after participating\
  \ in these adventures. Free RPG Day is a great way to kickstart a new RPG group\
  \ at a store, so we encourage you all to <a href=\"https://freerpgday.com/gamers/\"\
  >head to a participating retailer</a>for the event!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>GM\
  \ Recognition</h2> \n      <p>At PaizoCon Online last weekend, I awarded three individuals\
  \ with brand new Campaign Coins and Organized Play IDs. We award these coins to\
  \ members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional\
  \ program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations;\
  \ if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or\
  \ not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com\
  \ with their name and reasons. </p> \n      <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Jofiane\
  \ “Fi,”</b> who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#887</b><br>\
  \ <b>Milan Badzic</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#888</b><br>\
  \ <b>and Harmeshver “Resh” Singh</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized\
  \ Play ID <b>#889</b></p> \n      <h3>GM Ranks</h3> \n      <p>Whether stars, novas,\
  \ or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount\
  \ of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least\
  \ 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one\
  \ and three games for Venture-Captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate\
  \ of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours! </p>\n      <p>This\
  \ month, we had one GM earn their 5th Nova for Starfinder Society and one earn their\
  \ 5th Glyph for Pathfinder Society (second edition).</p> \n      <p><b>5th Nova\
  \ (SFS)</b>: Terry T<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Tim Munsie (TMun)</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Congratulations to our outstanding GMs and volunteers!</p> \n      <br> \n\
  \      <h2>Conventions</h2> \n      <p>It’s convention season! As this blog is posted,\
  \ I’ll be getting ready for my first games at UK Games Expo in Birmingham. It’s\
  \ my first official trip abroad and I can’t wait to meet our European community!\
  \ If you’re in the area, come say hi! </p>\n      <p>We've also announced <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sibc?PaizoCon-South-Pacific-is-coming-June-30th\"\
  >PaizoCon South Pacific</a>, running from June 30–July 2 in Sydney, Australia! While\
  \ I won’t be attending (this year...), the Paizo community will be turning out for\
  \ a great time.</p> \n      <p>And of course, there are tons of local conventions\
  \ in your area! Check out our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">conventions\
  \ calendar</a> to see what events are happening near you and go roll some dice.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>That’s <em>quite</em> enough from me—thanks for sticking with the supersized\
  \ update. There’s a reason we try to do these monthly! Until next time, Explore!\
  \ Report! Cooperate! And have a spot of tea!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
