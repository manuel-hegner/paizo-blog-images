  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The\
  \ brass-shod heels of Ambrus’s finely-crafted leather boots clack loudly off the\
  \ cobblestones of the Foreign Quarter streets as he takes his morning walk. The\
  \ dwarven prince and Pathfinder, Gorm Greathammer, accompanies Ambrus this day,\
  \ the two long-time colleagues enjoying each other’s company and the salt-sweetened\
  \ ocean air that provides a welcome relief to the pungent milieu of sweating laborers\
  \ and defecating animals who fill the district streets.</p> \n      <p>“So Dreng’\
  s disappeared again, eh?” Gorm says, resuming the pair’s ongoing conversation.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Aye,” Ambrus replies, “and once again without note or explanation.\
  \ I suspect he’s slipped into the group preparing for that expedition to Iobaria,\
  \ likely disguised as a porter. Or Eando Kline. Did I ever tell you about the time\
  \ I was in the middle of a conversation with the man I thought was Eando until the\
  \ real Kline walked into the room? It was just Dreng playing one of his inscrutable\
  \ pranks, but Eando and I nearly slew him, thinking we’d been infiltrated by dopplegangers!”\
  </p> \n      <p>Gorm unleashes a mighty guffaw, the golden clasps in his beard braids\
  \ jingling in shared de light at the story. “Ah, I can see Kline’s face now! Good\
  \ man, but almost as stodgy as you, my young friend!” As the man affectionately\
  \ known as “Old Muttonchops” rubs the graying whiskers of said facial hair and raises\
  \ a bemused eyebrow at Gorm’s use of the word “young”, the dwarf continues. “So,\
  \ other than the news that my drinking buddy has wandered off, what stories do you\
  \ have for me Ambrus? What legends in need of recording?”</p> \n      <p>Ambrus\
  \ snorts as he replies, “What, so you can go running off to insert yourself in someone\
  \ else’s adventure? You know Zarta’s filed another complaint about you leaving her\
  \ to run the faction you applied for and founded, yes?” Gorm rolls his eyes in an\
  \ exaggerated gesture of amused dismissal, nudging Ambrus to get on with answering\
  \ the question. With a bemused sigh, Ambrus continues. “It sounds like Calisro and\
  \ Eras actually found that Iruxi city they were looking for. An entire kingdom of\
  \ lizardfolk with a political system as complex and nuanced as any dwarven or human\
  \ court! Thank the gods I put Eras on that mission, only Norgorber knows what might\
  \ have happened if Calisro was our only diplomat present.”</p> \n      <p>Gorm instinctively\
  \ sketches the Iron Hammer of Torag on his breast at Ambrus’s mention of the dark\
  \ god of secrets and murder before gesturing for Ambrus to finish.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Anyways,” Ambrus resumes, “I expect that between Calisro’s guile and Eras’s diplomacy,\
  \ they’ll do alright. I’m more concerned with the word out of Cassomir.”</p> \n\
  \      <p>“Ah, Cassomir,” Gorm interjects. “Is Hestia still running the lodge there?\
  \ How is she? I’ve not seen the good lady in some time.”</p> \n      <p>“Well enough,\
  \ last I heard. Cassomir, perhaps less so. Hestia has noticed that her district\
  \ is in the grip of some dark malaise. She suspects a cult of some dark god, or\
  \ perhaps a supernatural predator that preys on mortal emotions. She’s gathered\
  \ a team to investigate the matter, so I expect to hear word on what she uncovers\
  \ soon.”</p> \n      <p>‘Well then,” says Gorm, “sounds like I’m in the right place\
  \ for the nonce! Now, you’ll need to tell me more about this expedition to Iobaria\
  \ you mentioned, but first let me show you to this baker’s stall just down the way\
  \ here. Owned by a lovely Vudran lady named Arvya who makes absolutely the best\
  \ muffins I’ve ever tasted. I may have told her you’d be interested in arranging\
  \ a regular delivery to the lodge…”</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <div class=\"\
