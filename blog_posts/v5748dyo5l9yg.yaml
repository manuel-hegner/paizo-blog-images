  >Thursday, August 14, 2008</p> \n    <p>Or, at least, it will almost have begun\
  \ when some of you start reading this. It had not begun as of me writing it, but\
  \ Gen Con starts today and the Paizo crew couldn't be more excited. For two days,\
  \ we've been delicately crafting our booth out of aged cheddar while letting the\
  \ succulent roast beef floor stew in its own juices. The racks, carefully constructed\
  \ from licorice and gum drops, sit majestically beneath our towering and quite delicious\
  \ pecan sign.</p> \n    <p>Yes, you can say Gen Con is tasty. And we can't wait\
  \ for the feast to begin. We're serving <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\">Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game Beta</a> and <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84eo\">Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign\
  \ Setting</a>, a new <a href=\"/store/brand/gameMastery/maps/steelSqwireFlipMats\"\
  >Flip-Mat</a>, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy83yx\">Flip-Mat: Basic</a>, on the side,\
  \ with <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81x6\">Yetisburg</a>, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7ymg\"\
  >Key Largo</a>, and <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy83la\">The Gamers: Dorkness Rising</a>\
  \ for the second course. For dessert, we have Gary Gygax's lost final novel, <a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy80hs\">Infernal Sorceress</a>, and a brilliant short story\
  \ compilation that gathers together a host of hobby gaming writers who have all\
  \ written shared-world fiction (like R.A. Salvatore, Gary Gygax, and Michael A.\
  \ Stackpole) called <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ht\">Worlds of Their Own</a>. The\
  \ delve is back with an all-new horror twist, we have the cast and crew of Dorkness\
  \ Rising on hand for signings all day every day, and a mega-signing on Saturday\
  \ with a handful of the authors from Worlds of Their Own.</p> \n    <p>And then\
  \ there's <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>. Nick and I prepared\
  \ the room yesterday and we've had it simmering at a temperature of awesome for\
  \ twelve hours. We can't wait to guide a bunch of hungry adventurers (just like\
  \ us!) through many, many days of exploration and daring-do.</p> \n    <p>We hope\
  \ to see you here. If not, start a party on the boards. Have a good time while we\
  \ are.</p> \n    <p>Joshua J. Frost<br> Director of Marketing</p> \n   </blockquote>\
