  \ From classic staples like dragonslaying and piracy to outlandish adventures fighting\
  \ robot scorpions in a rugged wasteland, no matter what genre of game you want to\
  \ play, you can likely find a spot on Golarion to suit your interest. With that\
  \ diversity of setting comes a diversity of people. Every nation has its own vibrant\
  \ cultures, traditions, and ethnicities—not just among humanity, but among all of\
  \ the ancestries found within the Inner Sea region. In Golarion, the home of the\
  \ shattered clans of the Five Kings Mountains, the tunnel-dwelling Kulnett of Geb,\
  \ the dragon-worshiping Mwangi tribes of the Mbe'ke and the Taralu, and the completely\
  \ subterranean grondaksen, there's no such thing as playing \"just\" a dwarf. </p>\

  \      <p> At least, that's always been the theory. In practice, many of these disparate\
  \ cultures haven't gotten the setting support they deserved. That's why when we\
  \ set out to decide on the topic for the second of our new World Guides, Luis Loza\
  \ quickly suggested a book that outlined the people of Golarion, especially those\
  \ not well-covered in the Core Rulebook. In the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>,\
  \ we provide the information and mechanics to allow our players to create character\
  \ concepts from all over the world. Just as importantly, we also sought to provide\
  \ a more focused vision of what these people looked like! </p> \n      <p> The <em>Lost\
  \ Omens Character Guide</em> makes heavy use of a rules concept introduced to the\
  \ Rarity system in the Lost Omens World Guide: Access. Many of the ancestry feats\
  \ in this book have a specific basis in the distinct traditions of various cultures\
  \ and ethnicities, and as such, are listed as Uncommon rules options. The Access\
  \ entry on these feats lists the criteria that allow a character to gain automatic\
  \ access to a rules element. For example, the Erutaki people have a tradition of\
  \ creating magical scrimshaw constructs; an Erutaki PC that meets the prerequisites\
  \ can gain immediate access to the feat that represents that ability below, while\
  \ another PC would have to learn the skill from an Erutaki carver or otherwise gain\
  \ GM permission to take the feat. </p> \n      <br style=\"  content: ;\r\n  clear:\

  \ the truth behind old stories that tell of sending a fetish of bone and sinew to\
  \ seek vengeance. These old magics allow you to conjure constructs with ease. Add\
  \ the summon construct spell to your spell list. The constructs you summon have\
  \ a distinct ivory scrimshaw appearance, and if you include a drop of blood, lock\
  \ of hair, or other portion of a creature's body as part of the spell's material\
  \ component, the summoned construct gains a +4 status bonus to Perception checks\

  \  content: ;\r\n  clear: both;\r\n  display: table;\"> \n      <p> That's not to\
  \ say there aren't a few ancestry feats that are entirely dependent on heritage.\
  \ For example, those of Nidalese ancestry can find the blessings of Zon-Kuthon manifesting\
  \ as they grow stronger, granting the ability to see in darkness and other shadowy\
  \ powers. Since these feats come as a direct result of Zon-Kuthon's pact with the\
  \ people of Nidal, only Nidalese characters can take them—while a PC could try to\
  \ gain access to such feats by seeking out Zon-Kuthon himself, as the three Kellid\
  \ horselords that founded Nidal once did, such a bargain would likely have far more\
  \ dramatic results than a few extra human ancestry feats. </p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, you'll find more heritages and ancestry\
  \ feats for each of the Core ancestries that help to support a variety of ethnicities,\
  \ both new and old. For instance, we've mentioned the mountain-dwelling Mbe'ke tribe\
  \ of dwarves that live in the Mwangi Expanse in passing—we've now provided a new\
  \ dwarven heritage to grant those dwarves an affinity with the dragons that they\
  \ worship, but can also be used to represent dwarves with a connection to azers,\

  \ Mbe'ke and Taralu dwarves of the Mwangi Expanse believe this heritage is a gift\
  \ from dragons or elemental spirits. Choose one of the following damage types: acid,\
  \ cold, electricity, or fire. Once chosen, this can't be changed. You gain the Energy\
  \ Emanation activity.\r\nENERGY EMANATION [two-actions]\r\nEvocation, Primal\r\n\
  Frequency once per day\r\nEnergy bursts forth from your body. You deal 1d6 damage\

  \ the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em> offers a more detailed look at some familiar\
  \ cultures within the setting. For instance, inside this book lies the true name\
  \ of the Snowcaster elves, as well as a number of secrets about their true origins.\
  \ Of course, this knowledge only raises more questions, such as whether the events\
  \ that created the modern-day culture of the Snowcasters are also connected to a\
  \ peculiar oddity of the elven goddess Findeladlara. As an aside, the Snowcasters\
  \ have always had a distinct look, but when ordering art for the <em>Lost Omens\
  \ Character Guide</em>, I asked for a specific addition to their silhouette—a pair\
  \ of antler-like blades that the elves can quickly combine with other gear to transform\
  \ into skis or a sled. These allow the Snowcasters to move rapidly over snow and\
  \ ice, and also makes them somewhat intimidating at a distance, which might explain\
  \ why many outsiders claim Snowcaster elves are demon-worshipping cannibals. </p>\

  \ With gnomes, we're taking the opportunity to emphasize that not all ancestries\
  \ view ethnicity in the same way as humans do. Gnomes especially tend to possess\
  \ a riot of unusual hair, eye, and skin colors that can often seem disconnected\
  \ from genetics entirely. When gnomes speak of their ethnicities, they are usually\
  \ referring to a natural affinity toward different kinds of magic that a gnome might\
  \ possess—due to their souls' abrupt disconnect from their ancestral home in the\
  \ First World, gnomes are more affected by nearby sources of magic when they are\
  \ growing up. For example, gnomes who grow up near sources of divine power have\
  \ more affinity with magic that changes reality or creates figments, while the unsettling\
  \ fell gnomes have a stronger connection to occult magic or dark fey. </p> \n  \
  \    <p> While goblins often receive little distinction from adventurers beyond\
  \ what color splatter they leave behind, the recent slowing of humanoid/goblin aggressions\
  \ has allowed the differences between goblin cultures to become better understood.\
  \ The forest goblins of the Chitterwood lived through the Goblinblood Wars (more\
  \ accurately, many of them did not live), which has given them a different approach\
  \ to life when compared to the wilder goblins of Varisia. A relatively quick goblin\
  \ lifespan and a traditional worship of Lamashtu means that goblins can also adapt\
  \ to new environments very quickly, leading to some startling physiological differences\
  \ between certain goblin ethnicities. The frost goblins of the north have blue skin\
  \ and occasionally blue fur, but the most striking ethnicity of goblin is likely\
  \ the monkey goblin, which possesses a long tail! A heritage for monkey goblins\
  \ is provided for those who wish to play these unusual offshoots: </p> \n      <div\
