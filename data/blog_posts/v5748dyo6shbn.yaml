  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings from the heart of the Inner Sea—the shining\
  \ city of Absalom! It has been a stupendous day, and a rogue blackmailing a tavern\
  \ owner would be hard-pressed to have filled her cup with more ale than I filled\
  \ today with sights and sounds the likes of which I had never imagined. I’m sitting\
  \ down for the first time since I got off the boat, if you’d believe it, to pen\
  \ this letter to you all to be sent out tomorrow.</p> \n      <p>Sailing into Absalom’\
  s harbor was an experience. I stared up, wide-eyed with childish delight, white-knuckled\
  \ from gripping the portside rail as we passed ever so gingerly through a reef of\
  \ sunken ships beneath the watch of Absalom’s walls. Fort Tempest on the western\
  \ bluff looked like an ugly duckling with its two-toned fortifications, like mismatched\
  \ building blocks set together by a titan’s toddler. I also couldn’t help but notice\
  \ the floating prison—the so-called Black Whale—half a dozen grounded ships all\
  \ lashed together. It seems the city reminds me at every opportunity to watch myself,\
  \ lest I become a more permanent resident (in less than ideal living conditions)!</p>\

  >Illustration by David Metzger</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>I’ve been parked at\
  \ a tavern here in the Precipice Quarter for the past hour, and you’ll love the\
  \ name: the “Tipsy Tengu”. The halfling owner has opened the place up to adventuring\
  \ parties, and the ruckus, storytelling, and drinking has me tempted to ask if any\
  \ are in need of a well-trained lockpick and confidence woman. All of those adventurers\
  \ are here for a reason: Absalom has abandoned, treasure-filled siege castles dating\
  \ back thousands of years spread all around its as-yet-impenetrable walls! How amazing\
  \ is that?! Just outside the city walls and even running beneath it in Desna-only-known\
  \ how many unmapped and abandoned tunnels, there’s a veritable adventurers’ playground!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Adventuring wouldn’t have me clapped in chains like crime within the\
  \ city walls would, and I’ve had my ears chattered off by a bird—Runkles the Raven,\
  \ the self-proclaimed flashiest familiar in the city—for the past twenty minutes\
  \ trying to convince me of the benefits of joining an adventuring group. His mistress’\
  s party is looking for a rogue to raid a particular siege castle, and I’m genuinely\
  \ tempted to take them up on the offer. But first I need to get a better feel for\
  \ this city and weigh my options. I don't know if treasure hunting on the city’\
  s outskirts is any more or less safe than my usual work among the tourist crowds\
  \ milling about, awestruck and not paying attention to their purse strings.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>I spent most of the day walking through the city, its wide streets\
  \ crowded past what I thought possible: every flavor of ancestry and culture from\
  \ across the Inner Sea and beyond, all simmering in this great big stew of a divinely\
  \ reclaimed island. I let my ears soak everything in, picking out anything on the\
  \ locals’ tongues to guide my feet. I overheard a pair of street vendors talking\
  \ about how they’d managed to raise prices due to the Radiant Festival. Now I’m\
  \ well versed in history, but I’d never heard of this festival before, so I purchased\
  \ a meat pie from one flashy cart called Mamma Middlepidge’s Delights and asked\
  \ about it. I had planned to take advantage of the influx of potential marks in\
  \ the wake of Absalom’s victory over the Whispering Tyrant’s failed siege, but what\
  \ I’ve learned of the Radiant Festival has me giddy as a werebear in a trough of\
  \ honey.</p> \n      <p>Apparently, thousands of years ago an evil wizard called\
  \ Kharnas the Angel-Binder (pleasant sounding fellow, I know!) laid siege to Absalom.\
  \ Since his defeat, they’ve celebrated each centennial with this grand festival.\
  \ And oh my, do they go all out! They took the formerly abandoned, monster-haunted\
  \ Precipice Quarter and remade it as the grounds for the Radiant Festival itself.\
  \ All new buildings, pavilion grounds, exhibits, merchants, and crowds, crowds,\
  \ crowds! It was all designed by a famed Absalomian architect by the name of Blune\
  \ Bandersworth. Here’s the rub though: the entire district was literally a ruin-strewn\
  \ waste filled with ravenous undead and monsters wandering up from who knows where\
  \ beneath the city and here in less than a year it’s the newest, grandest part of\
  \ the city and it’s hosting a massive festival! I don’t know how he did it. Neither\
  \ does anyone else. It’s as if he conjured it from the ether by magic!</p> \n  \
  \    <p>I’ve seen almost too much today to describe it all. The crowds were thick\
  \ and at first I thought that I wouldn’t be able to see much, but I wasn’t prepared\
  \ for the sheer size of some of the exhibits! The ground trembled and I looked up\
  \ as I entered the festival grounds and beheld a gigantic walking castle. Can you\
  \ believe it? A Keleshite palace on great mechanical legs with people on the ramparts\
  \ waving down at me, colorful banners fluttering in the breeze high overhead. That\
  \ was just the first of the wonders I saw, and it wasn’t even the largest of them!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>A block away, surrounded by an even larger crowd, was a gigantic beast\
  \ of a machine called Graveraker. Set up on giant metal treads with a huge drill\
  \ and whirling scoops, it’s the largest construct that I’ve ever seen! The festival\
  \ is here to display marvels of ingenuity, art, and craftsmanship, and I wonder\
  \ what this one will be used for. Perhaps it was used in the remodeling of the district\
  \ from its previously ruined state? Based on the name itself, I figure that maybe\
  \ they intend to use it to excavate and loot the treasures buried within the ruin\
  \ and rubble of the Cairnlands, or even Tyrant’s Grasp? I’ve no idea, but the longer\
  \ I looked at the menacing contraption, the more I couldn’t help thinking that should\
  \ it ever be turned to war it could surely eat any random building and still be\
  \ hungry, or feast upon the walls of any city—Absalom included!</p> \n      <p>What\
  \ caught my eye most though was a building still being completed: a massive Minkaian\
  \ pagoda fashioned like a great dragonfly. And the construction workers: a gang\
  \ of kobolds! Absalom attracts all types, and as an outsider it makes me feel all\
  \ the more welcome to see them skittering about, employed and accepted like anyone\
  \ else!</p> \n      <p>The Precipice Quarter would seem reborn, though not completely.\
  \ Not to one with as discerning a gaze as me. It’s a fresh coat of paint over a\
  \ mostly rebuilt fence, but if you look hard you can spot the rotten posts. The\
  \ local Edgewatch has done a good job of making sure that folks are safe, and <em>feel</em>\
  \ safe, even if certain areas are blocked off and still ruined out of sight of the\
  \ general public. Those blocked off areas? They’ve posted guards and I’d swear that\
  \ they’re there not to prevent anyone from outside sneaking in but to keep something\
  \ inside from getting out… It’s a grim thought to be certain, but even if the threat\
  \ of hungry undead seems mostly reduced to ghost stories, the crowds here have absolutely\
  \ attracted an altogether mundane threat, but one I’m much more familiar with: thieves\
  \ and confidence artists.</p> \n      <p>All this time I’d been on the watch over\
  \ my own purse because the crowd attracts that element. I mean, I’m that element\
  \ myself! So it was just by happenstance that this plump, bearded banker of Abadar\
  \ walks past, all sure of himself and the security of the city. In the space of\
  \ a heartbeat some large bird I couldn’t see through the throng let out a squawk,\
  \ distracting the gilded cleric, and I see a devilspawn woman walking the other\
  \ way lift his coin purse with the tip of her tail, real smooth-like. In a city\
  \ of strangers, she was a strange one: horns, goat legs, tail, all that racket.\
  \ Well that priest, he didn’t notice a thing, just kept walking. For her part, she\
  \ walked straight up to a stall selling strange figurines that could have been shrunken\
  \ corpses for how real they looked and bent over the wares. Some Gebbite selling\
  \ stuff to Urgathoans or somesuch. But I digress.</p> \n      <p>So, of course I\
  \ walked over and introduced myself just as she slid the pilfered purse into the\
  \ pocket of her cloak with the tip of her tail. I didn’t directly mention the theft,\
  \ but asked about “career opportunities” in the area and she caught my meaning.\
  \ Nisha Starweather was her name. She snagged us drinks and snacks from Pelmo’s\
  \ Pickle Hut, likely with the very money she’d taken off the Abadaran just moments\
  \ before. We talked for a bit and watched a number of other pickpockets ply their\
  \ trade—and watched nearly as many busted by the Edgewatch. They were doing a genuinely\
  \ good job of it. Sadly, I figured pretty quickly that Nisha wasn’t the foot in\
  \ the door I’d hoped for. She was recently arrived herself, visiting from what she\
  \ described as “nowhere remotely close to this place.” I think she might have slipped\
  \ a bit and started to say “plane”, not “place”, but I could have just misheard\
  \ her among the din of the crowd. Anyway, she said she was in town hoping to meet\
  \ up with an old friend who might be showing up herself in the next while.</p> \n\
  \      <p>While she wasn’t going to be the in I needed to set up a burgeoning career\
  \ in the city’s criminal underworld, she was the one who suggested the Tipsy Tengu,\
  \ since the place catered to adventurers at night. She said I might make friends\
  \ and ask around for a place to stay. A lot of the inns I’ve passed today have hung\
  \ a no-vacancy sign, with the city packed to the brim with visitors, and it’s dangerous\
  \ to wander about any city at night, especially as a visitor, so it’s a genuine\
  \ concern and that has occupied my mind for much of the evening.</p> \n      <p>Desna\
  \ smiled on me, though!</p> \n      <p>In the midst of my first drink, wondering\
  \ if I’d spend the night sleeping on a roof or in an alleyway, a bar fight broke\
  \ out! This drunken halfling insulted this one hammered Chelaxian, calling her a\
  \ “devil licker” and she retorted with a local slur against halflings, and that\
  \ started it. She got clocked, he got kicked in the face, and their respective companions\
  \ launched into the fray. It would have gotten worse if not for the Edgewatch showing\
  \ up and intervening with magic to hold the combatants in place and a smooth bit\
  \ of diplomacy to calm everyone down. That would have been the end of it, until\
  \ that Chelaxian woman shrugged off the spell. She would’ve stabbed the watch sergeant\
  \ if not for quick thinking by this half-orc next to me at the bar who stood up\
  \ and, cool as could be, crashed her stool over the “devil licker’s” head.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Things calmed down after that, and I paid the chair-wielding hero’s tab.\
  \ Ralso, her name was, and before she left for the evening, she gave me a business\
  \ card with the address of a hotel called the Dreaming Palace. She said it had empty\
  \ rooms if I were in need. The place looks fancy—sounds fancy, too, like maybe Desna’\
  s blessed it or something. In any case, it should solve my housing problem, if only\
  \ for the moment, before I figure out what to do next. Do I lapse back into the\
  \ life of crime that saw me exiled from all of you in the first place, or instead\
  \ turn to the life of heroic sanctioned robbery and murder of an adventurer? A good\
  \ night’s rest in my new palace of dreams and I’ll figure that out while I explore\
  \ the wonders of the Radiant Festival over the course of the next few days. I’ll\
  \ be sure to keep you all apprised of my decision (and other craziness of the big,\
  \ scary city). Until then, there are wonders to see and I’ve eyes to gander with!\
  \ </p> \n      <p>May Desna smile on you all,</p> \n      <p>Iliana Sarmiseth</p>\
