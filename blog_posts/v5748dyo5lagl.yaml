  date\">Wed, Aug 12, 2009 at 10:07 PM Pacific</p> \n   <p>From where I sit, it's\
  \ August 13, the official release date of the Pathfinder RPG. And as a co-owner\
  \ of Paizo Publishing and someone with a significant role in what some refer to\
  \ as \"the edition wars,\" I have an announcement to make:</p> \n   <p>The Edition\
  \ Wars are over, and we have all won.</p> \n   <p>You like 4th Edition? Great--Wizards\
  \ of the Coast has some fun stuff coming out for you, and there are quite a few\
  \ third parties expanding the scope of the 4E world too.</p> \n   <p>You like 3.5,\
  \ but want to see it evolve? We've got you covered with the Pathfinder RPG, and\
  \ more companies are coming on board to support that all the time.</p> \n   <p>You\
  \ like 3rd Edition and want to keep playing it as it is? Congratulations--you can.\
  \ And since the Pathfinder RPG was designed with compatibility in mind, you'll be\
  \ seeing a lot of new stuff coming out that you can easily use with your game.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>You like more than one of the above, or perhaps something completely different?\
  \ That's fine, too.</p> \n   <p>So let's put an end to the talk about why the games\
  \ you're not playing are lacking, and keep the focus on why the games you are playing\
  \ are keeping your attention.</p> \n   <p>This town *is* big enough for the both\
  \ of us.</p> \n   <p>Vic Wertz<br> Technical Director</p>\n  </blockquote> \n </div>\
