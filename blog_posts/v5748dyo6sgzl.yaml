  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Starfinder has over 100 playable\
  \ species now, but one of the things we wanted to do in the Character Operations\
  \ Manual was give a little love to the 13 species found in the Starfinder Core Rulebook\
  \ (including legacy races). What does that mean? That means alternate ability score\
  \ adjustments, alternate racial traits, and new feats, gear, and class options which—\
  while perhaps pioneered by a given species—are actually available to everyone.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Let’s start with the simple stuff: ability score and racial trait options\
  \ unique to each species. So, for example, some androids were built for manual labor;\
  \ instead of high Intelligence and Dexterity, they’re stronger and more able to\
  \ endure tough working conditions (Strength and Constitution). Species known for\
  \ settling diverse environments have options that model adaptation to high (human),\
  \ low (human and vesk), or zero gravity (human and ysoki). There’s a lot more.</p>\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Every species also has one or more options that replace\
  \ each of their racial traits. A player who doesn’t like the shirren’s Cultural\
  \ Fascination ability, for example, has three (three!) new choices. Cultural Assimilation\
  \ gives you a bonus to Disguise checks instead of Diplomacy, as you blend in with\
  \ an adopted species; Individual Obsession allows you to pick an additional class\
  \ skill and get an automatic skill point every level, along with a +2 bonus in the\
  \ chosen skill; and Linguistic Acculturation swaps out that Diplomacy bonus for\
  \ more languages (a lot more).</p> \n     <p>But what I find really cool are feats,\
  \ gear, spell, and class options, and if your character has the right physiology,\
  \ you can take these options no matter your race. Check out kasatha, for example:\
  \ You’ve got a bunch of new feats for characters with four arms. (How many new feats?\
  \ Four, of course!) There’s even a new class option for soldiers who wield three\
  \ or more weapons at a time: the Fourfold Tactician. As followers of the Four-Armed\
  \ Conspiracy™ can tell you, you don’t have to be a kasatha to qualify. Even a human\
  \ or lashunta soldier with a couple of cybernetic arms can use the Fourfold Tactician\
  \ fighting style to fire two automatic weapons at the same time! (We call that class\
  \ feature “Overkill,” and you can see why.) Other class options have no requirements\
  \ at all: the Crusader connection for mystics, for example, or the vesk Battlemaster\
  \ fighting style for soldiers.</p> \n     <p>On top of all this, there’s spells\
  \ and gear. Now your ysoki can cast shrink object to fit that big special something\
  \ in their cheek pouches (at high level, a really big special something). </p> \n\
  \     <p>The rest of the Star Chamber will be chiming in here over the next few\
  \ weeks with more glimpses into the Character Operations Manual, but let me tell\
  \ you, you are not going to be disappointed. This book blows Starfinder character\
  \ creation wide open. From now on, you’ll never feel like your hero is just like\
  \ everyone else.</p> \n     <p>Jason Tondro<br> <i>Starfinder Developer</i></p>\
