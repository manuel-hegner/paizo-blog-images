  date\">Friday, February 13, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n   \
  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">I just landed in New York City in advance of ToyFair,\
  \ the annual toy business trade show that launches tomorrow. While Paizo does not\
  \ have a booth at the show (yet!), it's become an invaluable stop for me to catch\
  \ up with some of our licensing partners, including the fine folks at WizKids, who\
  \ manufacture the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> line. I've\
  \ got it on good authority that WizKids will have an entire production-run set of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> on hand for their display,\
  \ and I hope to snap a few key photos to show off what some of the figures look\
  \ like in hand. Next week's blog will, I hope, feature some images of upcoming <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> figures, and perhaps some additional\
  \ surprises as well!</p> \n     <p>But the thing I'm really excited about at the\
  \ moment is <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"><em>Pathfinder Battles: Iconic Heroes\
  \ Set #1</em></a>, which arrived in the Paizo warehouse yesterday, and will hit\
  \ stores and subscribers very shortly. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150213-Minis.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150213-Minis_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>When WizKids told us they were aiming for a super-premium\
  \ production on the <a href=\"\">Iconic Heroes</a> line, I was very excited to see\
  \ how that commitment would translate to the final figure. It's relatively easy\
  \ for a professional painter to produce a killer paint master, for example, but\
  \ it's another thing entirely for everything to go right at the factory in a way\
  \ that really raises the bar. Frankly, I think WizKids has been raising the bar\
  \ set after set with <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>, so while\
  \ I was excited to see what they could do with <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  >Iconic Heroes</a>, I confess my enthusiasm was tinged with at least a little bit\
  \ of skepticism. I mean, how much better could they be, really?</p> \n     <p>Well,\
  \ I'm holding them in my hands right now, and I can tell you the answer is \"much\
  \ better.\" I don't think I've seen such polished prepainted plastic figures from\
  \ any manufacturer since the birth of prepainted minis. WizKids has really set a\
  \ new bar for figures that I honestly don't see how they (or anyone else) will exceed.\
  \ The figures look fantastic. They have blazed by the threshold of \"probably better\
  \ than I could do myself\" to \"way, way, way better than I could do myself.\" I\
  \ am very excited to see what you think of them.</p> \n     <p>I do apologize that\
  \ this shot is a little bit on the blurry side (all the others I took are completely\
  \ unusable). I'm not dealing with optimal lighting conditions in my hotel room,\
  \ and my phone is within 72 hours of being death-marched to the Manhattan Apple\
  \ store, where it will be replaced by an upgraded and superior model.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Upgraded and superior models.\" That's a good tagline for <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes Set #1</em></a>!</p> \n     <p>But enough about <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  >Iconic Heroes</a> (for now), let's move on to our next big set, <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"\
  ><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>, which releases in a few months.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150213-GoblinArcher.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150213-GoblinArcher_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>First up this week, is the Goblin Archer. I was astonished\
  \ to discover, upon adding this guy to the set, that Paizo did not actually own\
  \ a full-body image of a goblin archer appropriate for use as miniatures reference,\
  \ so we commissioned an original illustration for the sole purpose of the minis\
  \ lineâ€”the first time this has happened to date (though not the last!). The Goblin\
  \ Archer is a Small, common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \   <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150213-GnollSlaver.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150213-GnollSlaver_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>We've already revealed a couple of gnolls in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>, so I thought it might be fun to\
  \ keep fleshing out their ranks. Here we have the Gnoll Slaver, fresh out of the\
  \ pages of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\"><em>Monster Codex</em></a>. The image\
  \ above is a digital sculpt, but I've seen the paint master for this villain, and\
  \ it looks incredible. I can hardly believe it's a COMMON. It's also Medium.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That's it for this week's preview. Tune in next Friday for what I hope\
  \ will be some shots of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> goodies\
  \ from the WizKids booth, ideally taken with a new camera phone!</p> \n     <p>Erik\
