  \ Jordan</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, September 17, 2007</p> \n   <p>If you\
  \ haven't already heard, Robert Jordan (author of the wildly popular Wheel of Time\
  \ books, as well as several Conan books) died yesterday after a prolonged illness.\
  \ With his monolithic fantasy series gaining such incredible notoriety in recent\
  \ years, Jordan brought scores of new readers to the genre, and undoubtedly into\
  \ roleplaying as wellâ€”certainly many of us here at Paizo have been influenced by\
  \ his work. In addition, while roleplaying games have frequently spawned successful\
  \ fiction in the past, Jordan was one of the few authors to go the other direction,\
  \ and whose private world went on to become a game in and of itself, with a full-on\
  \ Wheel of Time d20 book (the first adventure for which can be found <a href=\"\
  /store/games/roleplayingGames/w/wheelOfTime\">here</a>). His work even made its\
  \ way into <i>Dragon</i>, with articles in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7cy8\">our\
  \ d20 special issue</a> detailing new hero templates and 26 new d20 monsters from\
  \ the Wheel of Time series, as written by Owen K. C. Stephens and Robert Jordan\
  \ himself.</p> \n   <p>Whether or not you're a fan, there's no denying that Robert\
  \ Jordan has been one of the biggest players that the fantasy genre has ever seen,\
  \ and his books will no doubt live on for generations to come. He will be missed.</p>\
