  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Last week, we announced the final batch of\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/season3\">Season 3 Pathfinder Society scenarios</a>,\
  \ as well as the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/season4\">Season 4</a> scenarios\
  \ debuting at Gen Con Indy in August. As of the writing of this blog, however, no\
  \ one noticed the first signs of a slight change to the Pathfinder Society scenario\
  \ release schedule that these scenarios represent. So, in honor of President's Day\
  \ here in the U.S., let me illuminate you!</p> \n   <p>First, since PaizoCon 2012\
  \ will be taking place in the first week of July instead of the middle of June,\
  \ we decided to delay the release of the June scenarios (#3–23 and #3–24) so that\
  \ they debut at PaizoCon. Since these four scenarios will be out within a week of\
  \ one another for their PaizoCon debut, they will serve as the traditional four\
  \ June scenarios and will wrap up the Year of the Ruby Phoenix storyline and segue\
  \ straight into Season 4's metaplot.</p> \n   <p>I know many people will notice\
  \ that this means Season 3 has two fewer scenarios than anticipated. That observation\
  \ is correct, but unavoidable. Convention season is incredibly taxing on the limited\
  \ organized play staff we have here, and doing 10 scenarios and 2 mutli-table specials\
  \ in less than three months simply proved too daunting a task, especially when the\
  \ finish line (meaning release date) of each month's portion of those products was\
  \ often at the start or middle of a month rather than the end, when our production\
  \ schedule is designed to have new material available.</p> \n   <p>What this does\
  \ mean, however, is that we're moving the release of Pathfinder Society scenarios\
  \ from the last week of each month to the first week of each month beginning in\
  \ September. So instead of waiting nearly two months between the four Gen Con scenarios\
  \ and the two follow-up adventures in September, we'll have new material roughly\
  \ every four weeks. That also means that our production schedule will be able to\
  \ more easily handle the extra workload each summer, as our new material will already\
  \ be ready for early July and August release.</p> \n   <p>So there's a peek at what's\
  \ changing in the coming months, and we've got a few more things left to reveal\
  \ before Season 4 kicks off, but it's still a good five months away, so we'll hold\
  \ off for those. There's still a lot of Season 3 left, after all.</p> \n   <p>Mark\
