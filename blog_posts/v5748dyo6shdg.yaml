  \ \n     <p>Greetings, Starfinders! Earlier today, we published the brand-new <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9vlp?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  >Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society</a>. While the update for Year 3 includes\
  \ a number of minor changes, typo fixes and so forth, I’m here today to highlight\
  \ some of the more important changes.</p> \n     <p><em>Disclaimer: I’m writing\
  \ this blog post based on a working version of the SFS Year 3 Guide. I am also human\
  \ and make mistakes. If there is a difference between text as printed here and as\
  \ printed in the Guide, the Guide is correct.</em></p> \n     <h3>Legal Table Size</h3>\
  \ \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shci?Organized-Play-Table-Adjustments\"\
  >As we announced recently</a>, we’ve adjusted the legal table size at Starfinder\
  \ Society tables. Tables with only two players may add two pregenerated characters\
  \ of an appropriate level in order to fire, and higher-level tables where pregens\
  \ don’t exist may play in “hard mode” with three players as long as all players\
  \ consent. The Guide also reflects the recent change in emphasis on seven-player\
  \ tables, from a scheduled option to only when absolutely necessary with organizer\
  \ consent.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>It Comes With Lore</h3> \n     <p>Each faction’\
  s goals have been updated to reflect how they dealt with the events of Year 2: Year\
  \ of a Thousand Bites, as well as their goals moving into Year 3. Careful readers\
  \ may notice some hints to upcoming story arcs! Appendix 3 also contains updated\
  \ summaries of the storylines featured in Years 1 and 2 of the Starfinder Society\
  \ campaign.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>New Character Options</h3> \n     <p>I know\
  \ this is the part that everyone wants most, so let’s get into it.</p> \n     <ul\
  \ style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> \n      <li><h4>New Races</h4> As a result of\
  \ players’ actions in the previous two years of Starfinder Society play, legacy\
  \ races and the izalguun became always available for all players. As we teased in\
  \ our panels at PaizoCon Online so long ago, they are now official. We’ve also added\
  \ a few others. The following races are now always available for any player, provided\
  \ they own the accompanying sourcebook:<br> <em>Alien Archive 1</em>: draelik, formian,\
  \ ikeshti, kalo, maraquoi, nuar, rhyphorian, verthani, witchwyrd</li> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <li><h4>New Languages</h4> The following languages are now available for\
  \ any character to take anytime they would learn a new language:<br> <em>Alien Archive\
  \ 2</em>: Bolidan, Daimalkan, Embri, Ghoran, Orrian, Osharu, Pahtra, Quorlu, and\
  \ Vlakan (Spoken, Signed and Tactile)<br> <em>Alien Archive 3</em>: Accaran, Akan,\
  \ Brenneri, Dirindi, Dromadan, Espraksi, Hortaa, Iji, Izalguun, Koshorian, Lumos,\
  \ Morlamaw, Perani, Raxi, Sazaron, Shimreen, Spathinaem and Telian</li> \n     \

  \ align=\"left\" style=\"padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;\" alt=\"Ehu Hadif\"\
  ></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      <li><h4>New Faction</h4>\
  \ In the events of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021b9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-207-Four-for-the-First\"\
  ><em>SFS 2-07: Four for the First</em></a>, Starfinders met four candidates for\
  \ the First Seeker position, as nominated First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo had announced\
  \ her retirement. Players were able to vote for their favorite candidate, and in\
  \ a narrow election, Ehu Hadif Ko’ra Amares of Clan Tolar, House Zye, tenth devotee\
  \ from the line of Ahmu, was elected. His faction, Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif), is\
  \ now available for selection and boons are available for those who choose to champion\
  \ his agenda of exploration. </li> \n      <br> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n  \
  \    <li><h4>Capstone Boon</h4> In addition to the capstone boon for the new faction,\
  \ another capstone boon has been added that experienced Starfinders of all factions\
  \ should find interesting.<br> <b>Starfinder of Note</b> (Slotless Boon)<br> Your\
  \ exploits inspire others to follow you.<br> <b>Prerequisites</b>: Any Faction Tier\
  \ 4<br> <b>Cost</b>: 4 Fame<br> You are in contention for a leadership role in the\
  \ Starfinder Society. Once you purchase this capstone boon, you are encouraged to\
  \ send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with a subject line of “Starfinder\
  \ of Note.” Include your character’s race, class, name, character number, and a\
  \ description of 75 words or less in the body of the e-mail. That character is entered\
  \ into a drawing to become a future in-world venture captain, member of the Forum,\
  \ or even the First Seeker. </li> \n     </ul> \n     <h3>Boon</h3> \n     <p>We\
  \ included new boons in the guide, but we’ve mentioned phasing out boons. So how\
  \ does this work? Well, we are starting the transition to the online Achievement\
  \ Point system for boons, but that will take some time and won’t be implemented\
  \ until Year 4 launches. While we haven’t made a decision on how to make the transfer\
  \ of boons purchased with Fame, that is on the team’s list as part of our Year 4\
  \ planning, along with how to streamline some of the organized play specific portions\
  \ of the program. The learning curve for a new player is steep and we are looking\
  \ at ways to make it easier for first-time Starfinders to get involved in our program!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That about covers the major changes! We hope you all enjoy the new options\
  \ opened up with this update. We’re taking a short break from these conversations\
  \ before getting back into updating the Guide for Year 4. Our hope is that by starting\
  \ the process earlier, we won’t have the delays we faced this year.</p> \n     <p>Until\
  \ next time: Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
