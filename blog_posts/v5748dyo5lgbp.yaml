  \ Ye be embarkin' on the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Skull &amp; Shackles</a> preview blog with me,\
  \ developer Gaby Weidling! YARRR! Okay, seriously, enough with the pirate talk.\
  \ I just can't keep that up for a whole post. A few of you might remember my Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles announcement blog from a while back, and if you don't, you can\
  \ find it <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfjc\">here</a>. I'm almost sorry for all\
  \ the pirate puns I put in there. In that blog, I mentioned some cool stuff you\
  \ should expect from this set, but I was pretty vague—partially because, well, you\
  \ know, we didn't want to spoil all the surprises, and partially because we hadn't\
  \ finished writing everything yet. But now is the time for some details and probably\
  \ some more piratical puns.</span></p> \n    <h2>Sharks</h2> \n    <p>All right,\
  \ so I talked about sharks in that last blog. Twice. They're not actually the be-all\
  \ and end-all of this set, but sharks are pretty darn cool, so let's spend a moment\
  \ on them.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-TigerShark.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-TigerShark_120.jpeg\"></a>\n  \
  \  </div> \n    <p>We've got at least one shark per adventure. The thing about sharks\
  \ is that you can't evade them. Any of them. Ever. But it's okay. Look at that Tiger\
  \ Shark. He's smiling! He totally doesn't want to eat you. Anyway, that was the\
  \ obligatory shark section of this post, because my boss at Lone Shark Games demanded\
  \ it, and you know how he can be. Let's move on to some of the newer and wackier\
  \ stuff. </p>\n    <h2>Guns</h2> \n    <p>I can pew-pew-pew and so can you-you-you!\
  \ Pirates wouldn't be anything without some sweet guns.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Blunderbuss.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Blunderbuss_120.jpeg\"></a> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Pepperbox.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Pepperbox_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here you can see the Blunderbuss and Pepperbox. The thing\
  \ about guns is that they're pretty unreliable—misfires all over the place. They\
  \ pack a pretty good wallop, but on a bad roll, you might end up burying your gun,\
  \ and then you might be weaponless. That's not what you want as a pirate...</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Lirianne.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Lirianne_180.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>... unless you're Lirianne the Gunslinger, one of the new characters\
  \ in the set.</p> \n    <p>Lirianne is never going to lose a gun as long as she's\
  \ got a backup plan. And Lirianne always has a backup plan.</p> \n    <h2>Swashbuckling</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Swashbuckling is an important part of being a pirate. Sometimes Swashbuckling\
  \ is helpful, and sometimes it isn't. Some cards, like the Shackles Pirate, are\
  \ easier to beat if your check has the Swashbuckling trait. For this card, you'll\
  \ get an extra d4.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-ShacklesPirate.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-ShacklesPirate_120.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Other cards, like the Marine, are unimpressed by your Swashbuckling\
  \ and are actually harder to defeat with it.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Marine.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Marine_120.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Whether\
  \ or not you want to swashbuckle can be a bit of a gamble. And you're not just inherently\
  \ full of Swashbuckling awesomeness. You'll have to gain it in some way, usually\
  \ from a boon. One of the best ways to get it is by playing an ally to explore again.\
  \ For example, if you discard the jaunty gnomish pirate Giffer Tibbs, she lets you\
  \ explore again, and she adds the Swashbuckling trait to all of your combat checks\
  \ during that exploration.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-GifferTibbs.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-GifferTibbs_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Hirgenzosk</h2> \n    <p>Some of you may have already\
  \ heard tell of the fearsome Hirgenzosk. He's only a Combat 30 to defeat, and he\
  \ isn't dealing damage to you, just your ship. Oh, and he has this text: \"If Hirgenzosk\
  \ would be defeated, he is undefeated.\" So there's that. He's just a big bundle\
  \ of cuddles that wants to eat you and your ship.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Hirgenzosk.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Hirgenzosk_120.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n \
  \   <h2>Ships</h2> \n    <p>There's a lot going on with ships, so I'm just going\
  \ to dive right in. Meet the Merchantman.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-MerchantMan1.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-MerchantMan1_120.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>This is the ship your party has when you start Skull &amp; Shackles. On\
  \ the right side, it's got some Check to Defeat numbers. Note the Wisdom and Survival\
  \ check. That's going to be a recurring theme with ships. It would be unwise to\
  \ be unwise in this set, or at least, that's the word on the stree- ... I mean,\
  \ the word on the sea. To the left of the lovely ship art, you'll see the words\
  \ \"Class 0\". Pretend you didn't see that yet. Just trust me.</p> \n    <p>On the\
  \ bottom of the card, you'll see two boxes. One says \"WHEN ENCOUNTERING THIS SHIP\"\
  , and the other says \"WHEN COMMANDING THIS SHIP\". The easiest way to explain all\
  \ this is to introduce you to some ship combat. That's right. You have a ship, and\
  \ you can use it to fight other ships. Pretty rad! Anyway, sometimes you'll be bopping\
  \ around locations, and you'll encounter another ship—which means it's time for\
  \ ship-to-ship combat. Merchantman, meet the Shackles Pirate Ship.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-ShacklesPirateShip.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-ShacklesPirateShip_120.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>They aren't friends. Time to fight! Let's look at one example\
  \ where you lose and another where you win.</p> \n    <h2>Losing at Ship Combat</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>The first thing we want to do is take a look at how to defeat the Shackles\
  \ Pirate Ship. Surprise! One of the options is a Wisdom or Survival check. We'll\
  \ do that one. Now look at the \"WHEN ENCOUNTERING THIS SHIP\" power. Having the\
  \ Swashbuckling trait on your check adds 1? Sounds great! Let's say you have that.\
  \ Now take a peek at the \"WHEN COMMANDING THIS SHIP\" power on the Merchantman.\
  \ Oh, that's about plunder. That won't help you here. That only helps if you win.\
  \ We'll revisit that in the section about not losing at ship combat. Guess it's\
  \ time to roll the dice. Oh, no! Horror of horrors! You totally flubbed your roll\
  \ and got a 3. Even with the 1 from having the Swashbuckling trait, you still don't\
  \ have enough to beat the Shackles Pirate Ship. Looks like the Merchantman is going\
  \ to take some Structural damage.</p> \n    <p>Like damage from monsters, Structural\
  \ damage is determined by the difference between your roll and what you needed to\
  \ roll, but it's dealt to your ship, not to you. You had a total of 4 against a\
  \ 6, so your ship is going to take 2 Structural damage. And your armor can't help\
  \ you here, because you're not the one being dealt the damage. But don't fret, Dear\
  \ Readers! There is a way to protect your beloved Merchantman. Any character can\
  \ discard cards to help alleviate the damage your ship takes: Structural damage\
  \ is reduced by 1 for each card discarded.</p> \n    <p>So if you and I were playing,\
  \ and my hand was empty because I'm the worst, it would be up to you to discard\
  \ 2 cards, or our ship would be wrecked. So let's say you discard 2 cards and save\
  \ the ship. Good job! The encounter ends. The mean ship would go back to wherever\
  \ it belongs and the game would keep going. But what if you and I were playing and\
  \ I had no cards in my hand because I'm the worst, and you had no cards in your\
  \ hand because you're also the worst? Well, the poor old Merchantman would be wrecked.\
  \ Which means we would flip that card over.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-MerchantMan2.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-MerchantMan2_120.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Holy sea cucumbers, there's a back? Indeed there is. Our ship is now wrecked\
  \ and sad and sepia-toned. But fear not, there is a way to repair the ship. You\
  \ can find that in the Check to Repair box. In this case, it's a Craft 6 check.\
  \ Remember when I said Wisdom and Survival were a recurring theme? So is Craft.\
  \ You're going to want to be crafty if your ship takes damage. At the start of each\
  \ player's move step, if the ship is wrecked, that player can attempt a check to\
  \ repair the ship.</p> \n    <p>But why do you care if your ship is wrecked? Well,\
  \ if you're greedy and like getting new cards for your character, you'll want to\
  \ right that ship pronto because your hard-earned plunder will start to float away,\
  \ starting at the end of your turn. There's also a \"WHEN COMMANDING THIS SHIP\"\
  \ power on the back that's not as helpful as the one on the front, so if you encounter\
  \ another ship while yours is wrecked, your ship isn't really going to help out.\
  \ It's too busy trying to keep its masthead above water. In some cases, the new\
  \ power is downright nasty. Check out the Merchantman's. You might fail to defeat\
  \ a bane with the Pirate trait—you've already proven you aren't good at fighting,\
  \ since your ship is wrecked—and then you'd have to bury a card! And worst of all,\
  \ there's the thing that happens when your ship is wrecked and your ship takes damage\
  \ <i>again</i>… well, let's just save that horror show for when it happens, okay?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I am now pretty bummed because of all the losing we've just done. Let's\
  \ talk about what happens when you win at ship combat.</p> \n    <h2>Winning at\
  \ Ship Combat</h2> \n    <p>Ok, so we're doing the same thing, but this time when\
  \ you roll, you succeed. That Shackles Pirate Ship is toast! Toast, I say! Several\
  \ things happen now. The first is that you gain a plunder card for beating a ship.\
  \ Huzzah! But what is plunder? And what does the \"WHEN COMMANDING THIS SHIP\" power\
  \ on the Merchantman mean?</p> \n    <p>Plunder is a reward you can earn in Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles. Things will often tell you to \"roll on the Plunder Table,\" which\
  \ is pretty meaningless until you look at this card.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Plunder.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Plunder_120.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>You\
  \ get plunder from being good at pirating. When this happens, you get to roll a\
  \ d6 and put a random card of that type facedown under your ship. (No peeking!)\
  \ While you command the Merchantman, you get to choose the plunder type you want…\
  \ <i>if</i> you are willing to discard a card from the blessings deck. Well, I'm\
  \ willing to do that, so let's toss one and select \"weapon\" for our plunder type,\
  \ because Gaby needs a new cutlass. Hopefully that's what we'll draw… but we'll\
  \ never know, because this is all hypothetical. Sorry to leave you hanging.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So what's that plunder do? Nothing yet—it's part of your reward for winning\
  \ the scenario. And there are ways you can lose it, so keep it safe, or it's going\
  \ back in the box!</p> \n    <p>Back to beating the other ship. Besides gaining\
  \ plunder, you may have the opportunity to seize the ship you just trounced. That\
  \ doesn't mean you get to check it off on your fleet card (which I haven't told\
  \ you about yet), but it <i>does</i> mean you can use the seized ship for the rest\
  \ of the scenario. Sometimes you'll be happy with the ship you have, and sometimes\
  \ you'll want to seize the ship you just conquered. If you seize the Shackles Pirate\
  \ Ship now, the next time you encounter a ship during this scenario, you'll be able\
  \ to discard a card from the blessings deck when your check has the Swashbuckling\
  \ trait to add a 1d12 to your check to defeat that other ship as per the Shackles\
  \ Pirate Ship's \"WHEN COMMANDING THIS SHIP\" power.</p> \n    <h2>Ship Things That\
  \ Aren't Combat</h2> \n    <p>Ships also have some uses outside of combat, like\
  \ helping you move characters around. You know that move step at the beginning of\
  \ your turn? In scenarios where your ship isn't anchored (which means it can only\
  \ stay at one location and can't move), the ship goes with you when you move and\
  \ so can anybody else at your location. Pretty handy, right? Of course, you don't\
  \ all <i>have</i> to move with the ship.</p> \n    <p>Of course, I can't forget\
  \ about the thing I told you to ignore earlier: the part that says \"Class 0\" on\
  \ the Merchantman and Shackles Pirate Ship. For that, you'll need the fleet card\
  \ that is conveniently located on the back of your Plunder Table. (Or is the Plunder\
  \ Table on the back of the fleet card?) Anyway, take a look at this card.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Fleet.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Fleet_180.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>All ships have a class, and as you play your way through Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles, you'll occasionally gain the reward of selecting a ship from a specified\
  \ class for your fleet. When you gain a Class 1 ship, you can put a check mark next\
  \ to the <i>Man's Promise</i> or the <i>Truewind</i>. And when you start the next\
  \ scenario, your party can choose any ship you have checked.</p> \n    <h2>A Final\
  \ Note about Ships</h2> \n    <p>I'd be pretty mad at myself if I didn't include\
  \ a sneak preview of one of the promo cards. This is my favorite card in the whole\
  \ set. Bonus points to you if you can figure out why.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-GoblinWeilding1.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-GoblinWeilding1_120.jpeg\"></a> <a\

  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-GoblinWeilding2_120.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>I mean, look at it! It's awesome. Steal some stuff from your friends\
  \ in true goblin pirate fashion! Hint: that's not why this is my favorite card.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But hey, let's go ahead and spill the beans about a <i>bunch</i> of promo\
  \ cards! Tanis already told you about <a href=\"/products/btpy96ie?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-Ranzak\"\
  >Ranzak</a> a while back, but as they say in the Shackles, that's just the tip of\
  \ the Hirgenzosk.</p> \n    <p>This month, along with Paizo's July product releases,\
  \ retailers should be receiving a packet officially announcing the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Guild Organized Play program, and to make sure we got their attention, we\
  \ stuffed it with copies of the second S&amp;S promo card, the goblin ally Mogmurch.\
  \ So tell your retailer to keep an eye out for it, and let them know you want one\
  \ of those promo cards!</p> \n    <p>At Gen Con in August, we'll be debuting our\
  \ convention promo for the next six months: a barrier called Goblin Keelhaulin'.\
  \ You can get it just for demoing Skull &amp; Shackles at the booth. Oh, and customers\
  \ who buy the Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set at the booth will get our August retail\
  \ promo card for free.</p> \n    <p>So what's a retail promo card? Well, every month,\
  \ we send a different card to retailers along with their shipment of that month's\
  \ goodies. Here's the retail promo card schedule for the duration of the Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles Adventure Path.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Goblin Weidling</b>\
  \ — August 2014<br> <b>Owlbeartross</b> — September 2014<br> <b>Goblin Pegleg</b>\
  \ — October 2014<br> <b><i>Magpie Princess</i></b> — November 2014<br> <b><i>Mistmourn</i></b>\
  \ — December 2014<br> <b>Goblin Buckler Gun</b> — January 2015</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>And that's not even all of the promo cards for Skull &amp; Shackles.\
  \ We have three more that we're not ready to talk about just yet!</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ always, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game subscribers will be shipped promo cards\
  \ along with their subscription orders. Ranzak, Mogmurch, Goblin Keelhaulin', and\
  \ Goblin Weidling will all ship with the August shipment. Owlbeartross will ship\
  \ with the September subscription shipment, and so on.</p> \n    <p>I think I've\
  \ shared enough about Skull &amp; Shackles with you now. You know about ships, sharks,\
  \ swashbuckling, guns, dear ol' Hirgenzosk, and a bunch of the promo cards, so you'll\
  \ just have to wait until the next PACG blog (hint: check back next Wednesday!)\
  \ to learn more. Thanks for reading, and have a wonderfully piratical day!</p> \n\
