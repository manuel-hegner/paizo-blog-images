  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last night the Pathfinder Society community\
  \ of Seattle and I wrapped four days of demonstrating Pathfinder games at Emerald\
  \ City Comic Con. Before working at Paizo I traveled to a fair number of cons, but\
  \ they were mostly gaming-focused. My first exposure to the world of comic con style\
  \ events was Fan Expo in Toronto. Larger than anything I attended prior and packed\
  \ with big names in the film industry, it exceeded any expectations. Over the past\
  \ two years, I've attended several other comic cons and come to enjoy the loads\
  \ of people, colorful costumes, and variety of activities the shows present.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As I worked the information desk in the Pathfinder Society area, I compared\
  \ the differences between comic cons I'd attended and other large conventions like\
  \ Gen Con, PaizoCon, DragonCon, and Origins. In the latter, we have many tables\
  \ of Pathfinder Society, but most of the attendees are there to play our games.\
  \ They come bearing dice and characters, ready to play games, win boons, and enjoy\
  \ themselves for scenario-sized blocks of time. At Emerald City, and by association\
  \ other comic con style events, our audience is mostly people who have not heard\
  \ of Pathfinder and their schedule is determined by gaps in panels they want to\
  \ attend. This got me brainstorming about how best to approach this style of event\
  \ and what sort of presentation would work best to intrigue those walking by enough\
  \ to pull them in to see our games.</p> \n     <p>With my experience of comic cons\
  \ being limited to a few events, I ask those that attend these gatherings and who\
  \ plan events for this style of \"demonstration\" environment: How do you approach\
  \ the event? What tools would make your event pop more? As an attendee, what does\
  \ a group do that motivates you to spend more time in an area? Please comment below\
  \ with your thoughts!</p> \n     <p>One of the items that we need, no matter what\
  \ style of convention or show we attend, is GMs. And GMs who spend lots of time\
  \ at conventions or local game days start tallying up the number of games they've\
  \ offered to the community. Soon, a GM reaches the 10-game mark and earns their\
  \ first star. Many go on to achieve their 2nd star by running 30 games, 3rd star\
  \ by running 50 games, and 4th star by running 100 games. A small portion of the\
  \ overall GM pool makes the milestone of 150+ games, of an expansive variety of\
  \ scenarios and with ten of them being special events. These GMs achieve their 5th\
  \ star and the acknowledgement of the time and effort it took to reach the milestone.\
  \ This month, I am please to introduce your newest 5-star GMs:</p> \n     <ul>\n\
  \      <li>Jerad Bailey</li> \n      <li>David Creighton</li> \n      <li>Ryan Force</li>\

  \ \n      <li>Jeremy Wenrich</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>This week my to-do list\
  \ includes sending out letters to Gen Con and PaizoCon volunteers and preparing\
  \ materials for next week's GAMA Trade Show. Hosted by Game Manufacturers of America,\
  \ it is a week conference for hobby retailers and industry professionals in Las\
  \ Vegas. But before I take off for GAMA, the team and I have a bit of information\
  \ to share with the community. Come back Wednesday and check out the blog for our\
  \ not-to-miss newsflash!</p> \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
