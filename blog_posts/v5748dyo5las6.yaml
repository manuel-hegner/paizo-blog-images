  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, February 4, 2010</p> \n   <p>Nothing ruins a\
  \ session of Pathfinder RPG more than a badly drawn map. You sit in your chair,\
  \ your character sheet and dice firmly in hand, and stare at the crudely drawn map\
  \ the GM sketched on the mat, struggling to discern exactly what those squiggles\
  \ on the board are supposed to be.</p> \n   <p>\"So, where's the door?\" you ask\
  \ and the GM points to a series of more complicated squiggles in the mass of squiggles.\
  \ You put your mini down on the map and your GM sighs and says something like, \"\
  That's not even a room,\" and moves your mini over a few squares—like you could\
  \ even see a room in the spaghetti shapes spattered on the mat.</p> \n   <p>Good\
  \ maps make for good adventures. A bad map, whether it's drawn on a mat by your\
  \ GM or published in a printed adventure, can ruin everything. If you can't tell\
  \ where anything is supposed to be or what those squares, lines, tags, squiggles,\
  \ or eraser marks are supposed to represent, it's going to be awfully difficult\
  \ to explain them to your players—or, heck, to even figure them out for yourself.\
  \ Pathfinder RPG, like its predecessor, is a game wherein eventually minis come\
  \ out, get placed on 5-foot squares, and action happens. That action can either\
  \ happen in a lavishly detailed temple of Cayden Cailean, or it can happen on a\
  \ board that looks like a cross between a blood stain and a chalk board full of\
  \ combinatory mathematics.</p> \n   <p>I have a handful of authors for the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety/scenarios\">Pathfinder Society scenarios</a> who turn over absolutely\
  \ amazing maps with every adventure—sometimes these maps are so good I question\
  \ why we're sending them to a professional cartographer to, essentially, just be\
  \ colored. Tim Hitchcock is easily my best author-turned-map artist. The sample\
  \ map below was his turnover for the temple of Cayden Cailean in Absalom for <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy8arh\">Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #40: <i>The Hall of Drunken Heroes</i></a>. As soon as I opened that image I knew\
  \ exactly what the hall looked like, where everything was, how to get in and out,\
  \ and where every set of stairs, every door, and every window was. In my art order\
  \ to Mike Schley, the Pathfinder Society cartographer (and an amazing artist), I\
  \ simply said, \"Awesome author turnover—follow his lead.\"</p> \n  </blockquote>\n\

  \   <p>I wish I could say it was always like that. I wish I could say every turnover\
  \ we receive at Paizo is art and requires no extra work on the part of the developers.\
  \ I wish I could say every turnover had a one-line art order to the cartographer\
  \ like mine above. Unfortunately, we receive a lot of really bad maps. That's not\
  \ to say we have a lot of really bad designers or anything—far from it. It's more\
  \ to say that perhaps we haven't emphasized enough what a gargantuan pain in the\
  \ tail slap a bad map turnover is. Let's say you're designing a small 5,000-person\
  \ city for us. Your map turnover comes in with 5 box shapes, a circle, and a few\
  \ smudges. Now, we can read through your text and pull out all of the relevant tags\
  \ and information about the city and add those to the map (which we'd rather not\
  \ do, mind you) but, in the end, we're going to have to redraw that map ourselves—\
  which is time we should be spending making the adventure or city write-up better,\
  \ rather than fixing the turnover.</p> \n   <p>A good map, like Tim's, tells us\
  \ immediately everything we need to know about the location. I don't have to redraw\
  \ his map and I don't have to send a novel with the map order that includes tags\
  \ and descriptions for every room so the cartographer can get the map right. Were\
  \ we to send our cartographers the bad map example from above, without also sending\
  \ along the entire article that goes with it, we'd get back a nicely drawn, full-color\
  \ drawing of 5 box shapes, a circle, and a few smudges. Our cartographers are awesome,\
  \ but their base for quality is only as good as the hand-drawn map they receive.\
  \ A cartographer should be able to open the author's map and immediately get to\
  \ work turning a good map into a great map rather than reading a wall of text and\
  \ then turning a terrible map into a mediocre map.</p> \n   <p>A lesson for all\
  \ of you would-be future Paizo authors and current Paizo freelancers: a map turnover\
  \ can make or break your submission. When you're done drawing it, look it over with\
  \ a careful, discerning, <i>player-focused</i> eye. If you drew that map for your\
  \ table of players, would they have any idea what it was on first glance or would\
  \ they, like the first example, put their mini in the wrong place when combat started?\
  \ Your map doesn't have to be a work of art—it just has to be interpretable so our\
  \ artists can make it one.</p> \n   <p>Joshua J. Frost <br>Events Manager</p> \n\
