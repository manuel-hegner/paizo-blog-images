  >I have a secret to share: change isn’t always bad. This spring we are making a\
  \ significant change to one of our <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/accessories/maps/mappacks\"\
  >Pathfinder Maps</a> lines.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xeo?Pathfinder-Map-Pack-Starship-Decks\"\
  >Pathfinder Map Pack: Starship Decks</a></i> is that last of the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/accessories/maps/mappacks\"\
  >Pathfinder Map Pack</a> line. But don’t fret, we are not giving up on modular mapping\
  \ tools, they are just getting an upgrade. We are replacing Map Packs with a new\
  \ line of maps called <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/accessories/maps/flipTiles\"\
  >Pathfinder Flip-Tiles</a>!</p> \n     <p>This new line launches this April, with\
  \ the release of <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9y1y?Pathfinder-FlipTiles-Dungeon-Starter-Set\"\
  >Pathfinder Flip-Tiles: Dungeon Starter Set</a></i>, the first of a number of base\
  \ sets that serve as one of the anchor points for the new line.</p> \n     <p>Flip-Tiles\
  \ have a few marked differences from the older line.</p> \n     <p>As you’ve probably\
  \ guessed, these tiles are double-sided, allowing us to present more mapping options\
  \ per set, and allowing you to change adventure scenes with a mere flip of the tile!\
  \ But that’s not all. We’re changing the size of the tiles. Each Flip-Tiles is a\
  \ 6-inch by 6-inch square. The new configuration provides increased flexibility\
  \ and ease of use, and since each tile is double-sided, this nearly doubles the\
  \ play space each tile offers. The square side leaves little to ponder when you\
  \ piece together your dungeon. If that were not enough, each of the new sets presents\
  \ more tiles than the previous Map Pack line. While each Map Pack contained 18 tiles,&nbsp;<i><a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9y1y?Pathfinder-FlipTiles-Dungeon-Starter-Set\"\
  >Pathfinder Flip-Tiles: Dungeon Starter Set</a></i> packs a walloping 42 tiles –\
  \ or 84 sides of dungeon corridors and rooms, giving you an amazing array of possibilities\
  \ right out of the gate.</p> \n     <p>You not only gain more tiles that are easier\
  \ to use, but we have also changed the way we present and expand the line. The&nbsp;<i><a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9y1y?Pathfinder-FlipTiles-Dungeon-Starter-Set\"\
  >Dungeon Starter Set</a></i> is that—a start. On the heels of its release comes\
  \ the first expansion set—<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9y24?Pathfinder-FlipTiles-Dungeon-Perils-Expansion\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Flip-Tiles: Dungeon Perils</i></a>. While the <i>Dungeon</i> <i>Starter</i>\
  \ <i>Set</i> provides tools for creating basic dungeon complex,&nbsp;<a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy9y24?Pathfinder-FlipTiles-Dungeon-Perils-Expansion\"\
  ><i>Dungeon Perils</i></a> details corridors and areas with possible traps, hazards,\
  \ and difficulties the PCs will have to explore or avoid. Down the line, other dungeon\
  \ expansion packs will further build on the <i>Dungeon Starter Set</i>, granting\
  \ you greater flexibility to develop whatever crazy dungeon your imagination conjurers.\
  \ Each expansion pack is made up of 24 tiles—or 48 sides of dungeons, providing\
  \ a wealth of more mapping options.</p> \n     <p>Of course, the line’s dungeon\
  \ offerings are only the beginning. The future will see the release of more starter\
  \ sets and more expansions to those sets, expanding the line into a number of different\
  \ terrain types. You can get a hint at some of our initial plans for the line when\
  \ you open the <i>Dungeon Starter Set</i>, as some of the tiles already feature\
  \ tiles that will connect to future sets.</p> \n     <p>I know what some of you\
  \ are thinking. But, Stephen, I have every single Map Pack, even multiples of some.\
  \ What am I supposed to do with those? Worry not. Jason Engle is doing the art for\
  \ these tiles too, and wherever possible, these tiles are designed to match or compliment\
  \ art styles already found in the Map Pack line. While the sizes are different,\
  \ the basic structure and motif of these tiles are fully compatible with your current\
  \ Map Pack collection.</p> \n     <p>No matter if you are a grizzled veteran of\
  \ our map products, or you have been thinking of starting your collection, I think\
  \ you're going to like Flip-Tiles.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
