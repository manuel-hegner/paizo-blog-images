  \ <p class=\"date\">by Gary Kloster</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Thirty Trees' Treasure</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The crocodile's\
  \ jaws looked as big as Jiri. Its huge tail pushed it with the flooded river's current,\
  \ angling toward the drift of brush that Jiri clung to. It would slam into that\
  \ loose pile of logs and knock Jiri, Fumo, and Boro into the water.</p> \n    <p>Where\
  \ they would all get to see exactly how big the crocodile's jaws were.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Girl, are you as useless as you are cursed?\" Fumo shouted. \"Use your fire!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jiri could feel the fire in her hands, and the logs she clung to were\
  \ beginning to steam with its heat, but she ignored it, ignored Fumo. </p> \n  \
  \  <p>I don't think I'd hit it. I don't think it would turn it if I did.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Turn it.</p> \n    <p>Jiri held the fire inside her and reached instead\
  \ for another spirit, tangling her soul in its magic, calling for its aid. In the\
  \ river beside the crocodile, a fin broke through, bright pink against the dull-red\
  \ water. The river dolphin Jiri's magic had summoned was barely a third the size\
  \ of the crocodile, and Jiri doubted the armored reptile was hurt when the dolphin\
  \ rammed into it, but that didn't matter. The charging attack, and then the crocodile's\
  \ twisting reaction to it, was enough. The flood current caught the reptile and\
  \ swept it away from the snag, rushing the animal downstream. </p> \n    <p>\"Thank\
  \ you,\" Jiri shouted to the dolphin as it jumped up out of the water and disappeared.\
  \ She clambered to Boro and drove her hand underwater, reaching for his caught foot.\
  \ Her head almost went under before she found it, jammed into the crook of a branch.\
  \ Boro's muscles tightened in pain under her hand as she pulled at it, but it wouldn't\
  \ come loose.</p> \n    <p>\"Hold him,\" she told Fumo. Jiri stopped pulling and\
  \ shoved against Boro's stuck foot instead, twisting it hard. Boro shouted, and\
  \ his hand tore at Jiri's braids, but she fought away and pushed until Boro's ankle\
  \ popped beneath her hand and his foot came free. Jiri almost fell between the logs\
  \ as Fumo jerked his son up, out of the water, safe.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>\"You broke his ankle.\" Fumo frowned down at his\
  \ son's twisted, swollen leg as Hadzi laid him out on the stone outcrop.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I had to,\" Jiri said, bending over the young man. \"To get him free.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I know that,\" Fumo said, shaking his head. \"But I thought you\
  \ could have done some kind of magic. I could have popped his ankle.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"You should have,\" Jiri said.</p> \n    <p>\"I—\" Fumo started, but Jiri\
  \ raised her voice over his protest.</p> \n    <p>\"Hold him still.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"I can hold still,\" Boro said through clenched teeth.</p> \n    <p>\"Of course,\"\
  \ Jiri said, her scalp still aching from where Boro had tried to rip out her braids,\
  \ and looked at Fumo. The man frowned at her, but he bent to grab his son and held\
  \ him down, ignoring his curses. Those curses turned incoherent when Jiri took Boro's\
  \ injured foot by the big toe, pulling up until the bones slid into place and his\
  \ foot was no longer twisted at an angle. Then Jiri called on the spirits, asking\
  \ them to help, to heal. </p> \n    <p>Boro relaxed suddenly. Below Jiri's hands,\
  \ his swollen ankle shrank to its normal size, marked only with the mottling of\
  \ old bruises.</p> \n    <p>Happy now, Fumo? Could you have done that? Jiri kept\
  \ her thoughts quiet this time, though.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, thank all my ancestors,\"\
  \ Boro groaned. \"And you, shaman. You saved my life.\"</p> \n    <p>Jiri shrugged,\
  \ embarrassed and unsure, especially when she realized that everyone was staring\
  \ at her. \"It's—I— We should go back. It's dangerous near this water.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Two can take Boro back,\" Fumo said. \"I need the others.\" </p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"For what?\" Jiri stood, acutely aware that Fumo wouldn't have spoken to\
  \ Oza like that. \"That snag could tear apart at any moment. Nothing's worth the\
  \ risk of being out there when that happens.\"</p> \n    <p>\"This is.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Jiri frowned at Fumo. The man was second only to the wara in the village.\
  \ And Oza, of course. But he liked to act like he owned Kibwe. \"Show me.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>The boat lay at an angle\
  \ in the snag. Jiri moved carefully across the tilted wood planks that made a deck\
  \ over the back half of the boat. The front was open, and she could see bits of\
  \ cargo and debris floating on the water that swirled around the ship's ribs. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Here,\" Fumo said, dropping down from the deck. Jiri followed, and\
  \ stared at the dark hollow beneath the deck. A single crate filled the space, taller\
  \ than Fumo and wider than both of them together, its wood so raw it still bled\
  \ sap. Thick ropes lashed it in place, but the crate was scarred from where other\
  \ cargo had slammed into it. Fumo pointed to a broken gap in its side.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Jiri plucked a stick out of the water splashing around her feet and called\
  \ to the spirits as her hand swept through the air. Shadows flickered and vanished\
  \ behind her fingers as she gathered sunlight and shaped it into a glowing golden\
  \ ball that she fixed to the end of the stick. </p> \n    <p>In her spell-wrought\
  \ light, the rough facets of the gem that filled that huge crate gleamed like a\
  \ hundred thousand stars.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-TheGem-Hadzi.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Hadzi hopes to one day become the wara himself.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>\"That thing is worth\
  \ a thousand mango harvests.\" Fumo's hands worked, splicing broken ropes together.\
  \ \"We'll all be rich.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's not ours,\" Jiri said.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  It is now,\" Hadzi said. \"We found it. A diamond almost as big as a hippo!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"A diamond,\" Jiri said. She reached through the broken crate and rested\
  \ her hand lightly on the huge gem. It felt hard and cool beneath her palm, like\
  \ rough glass. Then a shudder ran through it, as if some unseen blow had struck\
  \ the shining stone. The whole boat was shaking as the river rolled around it, and\
  \ it might have been just that, but...</p> \n    <p>\"Can gems even be this big?\"\
  \ Jiri said.</p> \n    <p>\"They are in stories,\" Hadzi said. His smile lit his\
  \ face, making him even more handsome, but that wasn't enough to pull Jiri's thoughts\
  \ out of the spiral that they were caught in. </p> \n    <p>Oza told me something,\
  \ once, about a great jewel. A story? Some legend about lost treasures, like he\
  \ told to the village children sometimes? Jiri pulled her hand away from the rough\
  \ surface of the gem. No. Something else.</p> \n    <p> A warning?</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ couldn't remember.</p> \n    <p>\"Hadzi, take this.\" Fumo handed his son one\
  \ end of the rope he'd spliced together. \"Tie it to those braces. We'll anchor\
  \ the ship to those trees, and move the gem as soon as the water drops.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>If this whole boat isn't battered to pieces before then.</p> \n    <p>Jiri\
  \ didn't say anything. She had her misgivings, but Fumo didn't, and she didn't think\
  \ Fumo was going to listen to her. Best to let them finish, then get them off this\
  \ wreck before it sank. </p> \n    <p>They would have listened to Oza.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Jiri frowned at the water rushing past, and she saw it. A dark shape in the\
  \ water, twisting in the current. Her heart quickened, but it wasn't another crocodile.\
  \ No, she could see the twisted ball of roots at one end, the ragged, broken crown\
  \ of branches at the other. A whole tree, washed out by the storm. It caught in\
  \ an eddy and spun in a slow circle, out away from the terrible current of the river's\
  \ center, spinning away, spinning toward—</p> \n    <p>\"Off the boat!\" Jiri whipped\
  \ around, and Hadzi was staring up at her curiously from the knots he was tying,\
  \ while Fumo was shouting at a woman on the rock, telling her to tie off a line.\
  \ \"Off!\" Jiri shouted. \"Now!\" She started to scramble up the slanted ribs of\
  \ the boat, but she was already too late. She heard the splintering crash as the\
  \ broken roots of the downed tree slammed into the ragged edge of the logjam the\
  \ boat was caught in. Fumo looked back, his eyes wide, as the boat jumped beneath\
  \ them like a guinea hen taking flight.</p> \n    <p>The side of the boat rose up\
  \ and slapped Jiri. For a moment the world was just swirling color, bleeding toward\
  \ darkness, but she wrenched her senses back. She was tumbling with the tilting\
  \ boat, heading toward the water. Lashing out, her hand closed on the edge of a\
  \ broken rail. The rough wood tore at her palm but she held on tight, stopping her\
  \ slide. Then something smashed into her.</p> \n    <p>Heavy, it rolled over her,\
  \ almost ripping her from her grip. She cursed, and the thing cursed back, and her\
  \ free hand reached out and caught a handful of cloth. Hands grabbed her back, and\
  \ she looked down to see Fumo gripping her leg.</p> \n    <p>\"Can you hold?\" he\
  \ shouted.</p> \n    <p>Jiri's hand was in agony, splinters driving into it as Fumo's\
  \ weight pulled at her. \"Yes,\" she hissed between gritted teeth. Throwing her\
  \ head back, she saw Hadzi clinging tightly to the ropes he had been knotting into\
  \ the boat's bracing. \"Help,\" she grated as the boat spun in sickening circles,\
  \ its wood groaning and popping. </p> \n    <p>Hadzi took his rope and started crawling\
  \ down the tilted hull toward them. When he moved, the boat tipped more, the edge\
  \ of the hull dipping toward the swirling water.</p> \n    <p>\"No!\" Jiri shouted.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Keep still, idiot boy, you'll sink us!\" Fumo yelled. \"Throw the rope!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Hadzi shifted back up, the boat shifting a fraction with him, and\
  \ threw the rope. It landed across Jiri's face, but with both hands full there was\
  \ nothing she could do about it but curse. Then the agony in her hand diminished.\
  \ Fumo had caught the rope and let go of her. Gasping in relief, Jiri almost let\
  \ go, but that would still kill her, and she made her fingers hold on until Fumo\
  \ pulled himself past her. He caught the collar of her shirt, jerking on it, and\
  \ Jiri let go then.</p> \n    <p>Jiri slid enough to choke on the collar of her\
  \ shirt, but she didn't fight. She let Fumo haul her up to where Hadzi was, and\
  \ the boat tilted back a little more toward even as their weight counterbalanced\
  \ some of the weight of the gem's crate, which had shifted when the tree had struck\
  \ them.</p> \n    <p>\"What do we do now?\" Hadzi said, clinging to the braces that\
  \ held up the boat's half-deck.</p> \n    <p>Jiri took hold of a brace beside him\
  \ with aching arms, trying to wedge herself into place with her legs. The boat was\
  \ jumping and jerking, spinning in wide circles, and over its side Jiri could see\
  \ the jungle rushing past. The collision had knocked them free of the rest of the\
  \ brush and out into the river, and now—</p> \n    <p>\"Hold on,\" she gasped. The\
  \ boat lurched again, the whole thing groaning, and then its spinning slowed. We're\
  \ coming out of the current. Maybe we'll—</p> \n    <p>With a crunch the ship slammed\
  \ to a halt. Jiri found herself tumbling again, but this time she landed on something\
  \ softer. Hadzi cursed beneath her, but they weren't moving anymore. Jiri pulled\
  \ herself up off him and stared over the rail.</p> \n    <p>The boat had been swept\
  \ into a backwater, where it had crashed into a stand of gaboon trees, wedging its\
  \ prow between their trunks. The water around them was moving slowly now, and not\
  \ far away Jiri could see hummocks of earth rising out of it.</p> \n    <p>\"Thank\
  \ you, all my laughing ancestors,\" Jiri sighed. </p> \n    <p>\"This is good.\"\
  \ Fumo had climbed up onto the half-deck and was staring around. \"I know this place.\
  \ We're only a little farther from the village, and the boat's secure. We'll be\
  \ able to get the gem back once the water's gone down.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Is that\
  \ what matters?\" Jiri stared down at her hand, the palm rubbed raw and stubbled\
  \ with splinters. \"What about the others?\"</p> \n    <p>Fumo frowned at her. \"\
  They were safe on the stone, out of the river.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Safe, if one of\
  \ your ropes didn't knock them in when it tore free. If that happened, then they're\
  \ probably dead.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What is wrong with you, girl?\" Fumo pointed at\
  \ the crate. The wood had split, and the gem was easy to see now, flashing in the\
  \ sun like clear water. \"Don't you think that's worth a little risk?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"I don't know,\" Jiri said. \"Because I don't know what that thing is.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"It's our treasure. Thirty Trees' treasure. We just need to wait\
  \ for the others to come downstream and find us, and we can take it home.\" Fumo\
  \ settled himself down on the deck, rubbing at the great bruise that was blossoming\
  \ on his side. \"It will be good, Jiri. Imagine what Oza will say.\"</p> \n    <p>Imagine.\
  \ Jiri kept that to herself, and started to pull the splinters out of her palm.</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>It was almost night\
  \ before they finally heard voices. They drifted in from the shadows beneath the\
  \ trees and echoed off the water that was slowly draining away as the river gradually\
  \ shrank beside them.</p> \n    <p>\"Finally,\" Fumo said.</p> \n    <p>Jiri peered\
  \ too into the twilight-dark trees and caught a flash of light—not the flickering\
  \ of a torch, but the steady glow of spell-caught light.</p> \n    <p>Is Oza back\
  \ already? Can I turn this mess over to him?</p> \n    <p>The light rounded the\
  \ edge of the stand of gaboons and Jiri stared at the man who held it. A heavier\
  \ man than Oza, with short hair and a long beard, skin the color of sand, and the\
  \ strange, layered clothes of a foreigner. </p> \n    <p>\"Who are you,\" the man\
  \ called out. \"And what are you doing on my boat?\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next\
