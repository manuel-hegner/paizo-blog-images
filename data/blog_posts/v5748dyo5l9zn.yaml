  \ of Kyonin</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 16, 2008</p> \n    <p>For\
  \ the first twelve installments of Pathfinder, we introduced our twelve iconic adventurers.\
  \ With Second Darkness, our third Adventure Path, we're switching tactics. Since\
  \ there's only 11 core classes (we kind of cheated with Seltyiel a little, making\
  \ him our \"iconic multiclass\" character), starting with Pathfinder #13 our cover\
  \ characters are instead iconic NPCs from the current adventure path or campaign.\
  \ Of course, that means that we'll be needing to walk a thin line between showing\
  \ off our new characters and spoiling key plot points for the adventures themselves.\
  \ Second Darkness is a good example, since the nature of the main bad guy race isn't\
  \ obvious immediately in play, but by the end of the first adventure, it should\
  \ be. It's a small spoiler to players who see the cover, but that's less important\
  \ than having an eye-catching cover in the first place, really.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ there's a world of difference between showing off an illustration of a character\
  \ and posting an extensive back story for that character. For the iconic heroes,\
  \ this was never a problem since they don't actually appear in the adventures. Going\
  \ forward, though, it's probably not a good idea to spell out exactly what an NPC's\
  \ role in the adventure is. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that just because\
  \ an NPC shows up on a cover doesn't mean that NPC is a bad guy. We'll be putting\
  \ potential allies of the PCs up on the cover now and then as well.</p> \n    <p>Pictured\
  \ here, for example, is an elven general named Allevrah. She's a pretty important\
  \ member of Kyonin's military forces, and has certainly seen her share of battle\
  \ (note her clipped ear—the result of a close call in a battle against a babau assassin—\
  wound whose scar she wears with pride as a trophy). Her role in Second Darkness\
  \ is pretty important—important enough that we chose to illustrate her on the Gen\
  \ Con alternate cover to Pathfinder #13, but if you want to know what that role\
  \ is, I'm afraid you'll have to play the adventure!</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs <br>\
