  alt: "Several terraced buildings in the late afternoon sun, the light filtering\
    \ down from the upper left. The buildings are surrounded by leafy trees and plants\
    \ grow on the sides of the buildings and terraces. On the right, the terrace in\
    \ front of a building is neatly manicured and has a small group of people in robes\
    \ gathered. One holds a staff with a glowing red end up to the sky as the others\
    \ look on. A cloaked, hooded person watches from the stairs leading up to the\
    \ terrace."
