  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">While Gen Con won’t be happening in Indianapolis\
  \ this year, Gen Con Online promises to be just as jam-packed with Organized Play\
  \ events! We’ve got nearly 900 game sessions scheduled, so let’s take a look at\
  \ some of the new scenarios we’ll be premiering.</p> \n      <p><b>Pathfinder Special:\
  \ 2-00 The King in Thorns</b><br> In our first multitable interactive special for\
  \ Pathfinder (second edition), the Pathfinder Society travels deep within the jungles\
  \ of the Mwangi Expanse, ready to do battle with a powerful fey adversary, the Thorned\
  \ Monarch, whose shadowy plots have vexed the Pathfinder Society since its founding\
  \ days. Adventurers will unlock lost magic and discover long-forgotten secrets—\
  that is, if they don’t fall prey to the Monarch’s tricks! This interactive special\
  \ currently has 70 tables scheduled at a variety of level ranges.</p> \n      <p><b>Starfinder\
  \ Special: 3-00 The Last Bite</b><br> With her machinations laid bare, Datch is\
  \ ready to execute the final stages of her plan: become the head of AbadarCorp and\
  \ twist it for her nefarious purposes. Only the Starfinder Society can stop her\
  \ plans in their tracks in this brand-new interactive special! The agents will have\
  \ to battle drones, win friends and alliances, and work together to complete Luwazi\
  \ Elsebo’s final mission and close the books on this saga.</p> \n      <p><b>New\
  \ Scenarios</b><br> Gen Con will also see the premiere of a several new Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenarios:<br> In <b>PFS 1-24: Lightning Strikes, Stars Fall</b>, Pathfinders\
  \ chart a path through the Numerian wilderness, dealing with all matter of twisted\
  \ and technological foes and a nefarious group that’s determined to make sure they\
  \ never return. <br> In <b>PFS 1-25: Grim Symphony</b>, Pathfinders explore a haunted\
  \ mansion in Ustalav filled with treasure – and discordant evil!<br> <b>PFS 2-01:\
  \ Citadel of Corruption</b> kicks off the new year with a Decemvirate-led expedition\
  \ into the corrupted forests of Iobaria.<br> <b>PFS 2-02: Mountain of Sea and Sky</b>\
  \ ask the Pathfinders to secure a new lodge on an oceanside mountain in Minkai.\
  \ Magical disturbances have sent the island’s guardians and wildlife into disarray.\
  \ Through exploration, diplomacy, magic, and blade, the Pathfinders can set things\
  \ right and earn welcome to a newly harmonious land. </p> \n      <p>We’ll also\
  \ be releasing <b>Quest 13: Falcon’s Descent</b>, our final quest, in which the\
  \ Eagle Knights request assistance with a band of slavetaking duergars, as well\
  \ as our first Bounty, titled <b>The Whitefang Wyrm</b>, in which Pathfinders between\
  \ missions accept a bounty to track down a dangerous dragon in the frozen Crown\
  \ of the World. Starfinder released its first two offerings for Year 3, <b>Crash\
  \ Down</b> and <b>The Subterranean Safari</b>, at ConCurrent, and you’ll find plenty\
  \ of tables for both at Gen Con as well.</p> \n      <p>Not to be forgotten, the\
  \ <b>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</b> will feature tables of the interactive\
  \ special <b>6-99 Tyrant of the Harrow</b>, which debuted at PaizoCon and pulls\
  \ the heroes into the Harrowed Realm populated by storybook characters. We're kicking\
  \ off <b>Year 7: The Year of Reborn Strife</b> with zombie hijinks in the streets\
  \ of Kaer Maga in <b>7-1: Attack of the Twice-Born</b>. We’re also premiering the\
  \ <b>PACS 2020 Open: The Last Night at Everstand</b>, in which teams take on the\
  \ role of embattled defenders against foreboding odds to compete against each other\
  \ for fame, glory and prizes!</p> \n      <p> In addition to all these events, we’\
  re featuring tables of some old favorites from Pathfinder (first edition) as well\
  \ as selections from Year 1 of Pathfinder (second edition) and Year 2 of Starfinder\
  \ Society. With nearly 900 tables over the four days of the convention, we’re sure\
  \ you’ll have plenty of opportunities to roll some (virtual) dice!</p> \n      <br>\
