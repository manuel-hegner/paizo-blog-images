  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">This week's preview of <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Battles: Ruins of Lastwall</i> examines the faith of one of Golarion's newest\
  \ deities. Fewer than 50 years ago, the masked man known as Razmir appeared in the\
  \ River Kingdom of Melcat, and declared himself a god after having passed the Test\
  \ of the <i>Starstone</i>. Since that fateful day, he has raised a nation in Melcat's\
  \ place that bears his name—Razmiran—and stretches all the way to the shores of\
  \ Lake Encarthan. All who live there are required to worship him and pay harsh tithes\
  \ to his church. Because PCs are likely lining up to join his growing cult, we thought\
  \ we'd give them some minis to use!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Craig J. Spearing</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>First\
  \ on the list is the Razmir Cultist, a Medium common figure representing the rank\
  \ and file members of Razmir's church. These are the laity of the faith and can\
  \ often be found serving an influential priest or operating as enforcers of the\
  \ church's will among the common folk of Razmiran. For such service, the depicted\
  \ cultist has been elevated to the church rank of Herald of the Eighth Step, as\
  \ indicated by their black robe and iron mask.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The aforementioned Razmir Priest is the second in the\
  \ series, in elegant purple robes. They wield no weapons but can cast spells like\
  \ any other priest, and thus present as much a threat as an entire team of acolytes.\
  \ Rarer than the common acolyte, the Razmir Priest is a Medium uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-RazmirPriest.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-RazmirPriest_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Since the <i>Ruins of Lastwall </i>set already features\
  \ so many deities, it seemed wrong not to put the setting's newest god in a rare\
  \ slot. Thus, I present to you one of the most impressive figures we've ever done,\
  \ in my opinion: Razmir, Living God. The intricate gold detail on his cloak is awe-inspiring,\
  \ and his commanding pose demands reverence. While he'd probably have you executed\
  \ for the heresy, Razmir also makes for a more generic evil spellcaster in a homebrew\
  \ campaign.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-Razmir.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-Razmir_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Though it's not the most flattering comparison, I can't\
  \ help but think of Scar and his hyena lackeys in Disney's <i>The Lion King </i>whenever\
  \ the topic of Razmir comes up around the office. So despite being far from the\
  \ deserts of Qadira or Osirion, it seems fitting to show off this set's Hyena, a\
  \ Medium common figure. There's not much to say about hyenas beyond that I find\
  \ their \"laughs\" to be among the creepiest sounds made by any animal in the real\
  \ world. Now I'm going to have that sounds stuck in my head just from thinking about\
  \ it. The sacrifices I make for you all!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\
  \ href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-Hyena.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-Hyena_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>That's it for this week. Next time we'll look at the\
  \ final six figures in the set and the last piece of set dressing, including one\
  \ of the most requested minis since Pathfinder Battles started, and the final deity\
  \ of the set. Until then, \"row like you believe.\"</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
