  > \n    <p>The Halloween season is about more than just scares. Here in Seattle,\
  \ the approach of Halloween means the end of nice weather and a months-long descent\
  \ into \"the gray,\" a series of cloudy, rainy, dreary days often strung together\
  \ 40 or 50 at a time. It's not the dreariness that gets you, or the dampness. It's\
  \ the monotony of it all. The same day, every day, for days and days and days and\
  \ days (can you tell I just got back from a vacation?). But Halloween is around\
  \ the corner to break up the gloom, and it does so with both tricks AND treats.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">This week, I'm focusing on a couple of\
  \ the \"treats\" in the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a>\
  \ set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted miniatures due to hit stores and subscribers\
  \ in January. And since it's gray outside, I thought I'd stick to a \"gray\" theme.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Specifically, I'm talking about the Gray Maidens.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121019-GreyMaiden.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121019-GreyMaiden_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Gray Maidens first appeared during the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of the Crimson Throne\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, our second-ever Pathfinder campaign. Stationed in the Varisian\
  \ city of Korvosa, the Gray Maidens were the personal bodyguard of Queen Ileosa,\
  \ and became heavily embroiled in the chaos and machinations that fueled that campaign.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>When the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered\
  \ Star Adventure Path</a> set out to revisit Varisia, we knew we wanted to include\
  \ the Gray Maidens from the start. We liked their design enough that we put it on\
  \ the back cover of the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"><i>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Core Rulebook</i></a>, after all, so it was only a matter of time before we'd\
  \ revisit them in an Adventure Path.</p> \n    <p>And make prepainted miniatures\
  \ of them, of course.</p> \n    <p>The figure pictured above is the rank-and-file\
  \ Gray Maiden. She works perfectly in concert with the Shattered Star or Curse of\
  \ the Crimson Throne campaigns, and we've put her at the uncommon rarity so it's\
  \ relatively easy to build up a bunch of them. Not playing either of those Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Paths? Not to worry, this figure is cool enough to work for any female\
  \ warrior in full plate, including a player character.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of\
  \ character, we've had good luck so far including multiple types of the same \"\
  troop\" in previous Pathfinder Battles sets, and the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\"\
  >Shattered Star</a> set is no exception. A squad of Gray Maidens needs leadership,\
  \ so the set also includes the Gray Maiden Commander.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121019-Commander.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121019-Commander_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Pictured above is Oriana, leader of the Gray Maiden\
  \ contingent encountered in the second Shattered Star adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy8tmi\"\
  >\"Curse of the Lady's Light\"</a>. She's got some nasty scars on her face and a\
  \ real chip on her shoulder, and your player characters are going to love hating\
  \ her.</p> \n    <p>And what better way to focus that hate than a gorgeous prepainted\
  \ figure placed right in the middle of your gaming table?</p> \n    <p>The Gray\
  \ Maidens are coming your way in January, complete with the rest of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a> set. We're thrilled with the way these figures\
  \ came out, and I continue to be extremely excited about the level of quality WizKids\
  \ has put into this set.</p> \n    <p>But I've got days and days of gray Seattle\
  \ skies ahead of me, and things are bound to get a bit gloomier between now and\
  \ Halloween.</p> \n    <p>In fact, I think the horror around here is about to get\
  \ downright <i>cosmic</i>.</p> \n    <p>Return here in seven days for unknowable\
  \ horrors from the edge of the cosmos that man was never meant to experience (but\
  \ which will look GREAT on your gaming table!).</p> \n    <p>Trick or treat!</p>\
