  \  <p>The remote town of Willowshore is nestled on the banks of the Ceiba River.\
  \ Founded by religious pilgrims and host for a time to a bustling lumber business,\
  \ in the first few years after the onset of the Age of Lost Omens, Willowshore’\
  s fate looks grim. Already faced with fears about political upheaval due to the\
  \ collapse of the empire of Lung Wa, and fearful of rumors that monsters from the\
  \ deeper reaches of Shenmen are preparing to seize control of the land, Willowshore\
  \ is ill prepared for a horrific new curse about to engulf the region.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>In the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/seasonOfGhosts\"\
  >Season of Ghosts Adventure Path</a>, each player character calls Willowshore their\
  \ home—be it one their family has lived in for generations or a place they’ve only\
  \ recently arrived at. When your group awakens on the first day of summer in the\
  \ nearby woods, what at first seems like the aftermath of a night spent too energetically\
  \ during a festival reveals itself to be something much more sinister. Wildlife\
  \ is acting strange and aggressive. Thick fog has descended upon the region. And\
  \ at night... things get worse. Can you help your hometown escape from this sinister\
  \ curse? Or are you and your homes equally doomed to fall into the clutches of sinister\
  \ forces in this horror-themed Adventure Path set in the heart of the continent\
  \ of Tian Xia?</p> \n      <p>Inside the <em><a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/SeasonofGhosts_PlayersGuide.pdf\"\
  >Season of Ghosts Player’s Guide</a></em>, you’ll find player-friendly, spoiler-free\
  \ information and tips to help you make an exciting new character perfect for the\
  \ Season of Ghosts Adventure Path, which is set just over a hundred years in the\
  \ past, not long after the onset of the Age of Lost Omens itself!</p> \n      <div\
