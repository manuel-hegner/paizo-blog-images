  \ Now 20% Cooler with Indexes</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, November 24,\
  \ 2011</p> \n    <p>The new PRD has been out for a while now, but a new feature\
  \ may have gone unnoticed by some. Recently, we've added a set of indices to the\
  \ PRD (look toward the bottom of the menu on the left-hand side of the page). These\
  \ indices were originally created as mobile content so that anyone trying to look\
  \ up a single reference on their phones would have an easier time doing it. It quickly\
  \ became obvious that we should also give the people on their desktops and iPads\
  \ similar capabilities. We had all of the data right there, but we just needed to\
  \ apply it a little differently. At first we only offered feats and spells, but\
  \ eventually we were able to add magic items and spell lists. Each addition has\
  \ been a little more complicated than the last.</p> \n    <p>The first two, <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/prd/indices/feats.html\">feats</a> and <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/indices/spells.html\"\
  >spells</a>, are alphabetical indices with filters that allow the user to sort data\
  \ by book. Originally, this was the only data really available to us and was sufficient\
  \ for those lists, but the magic item index gave us reason to develop that a little\
  \ further. Knowing that people often like to browse through the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/indices/magicitems.html\"\
  >magic item index</a> looking for a particular type of item—such hunting for a new\
  \ suit of armor or filling in an empty ring slot—we created our index filters for\
  \ that page with this in mind.</p> \n    <p>After that, most of our requests for\
  \ these types of indices came in two forms: spell lists and monsters. And though\
  \ we've not yet created a monster index, this is certainly something we’re considering\
  \ for the future. <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/indices/spelllists.html\">Spell lists</a>,\
  \ however, have been tackled, and you can now pick from any class and then filter\
  \ spells by book and spell level. This has become a valuable resource and probably\
  \ useful for a lot of people, especially those not as familiar with spells in the\
  \ more recent books, like <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz\"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a>, but who\
  \ would like to give them a try.</p> \n    <p>The indices are still evolving, and\
  \ we appreciate all of your feedback and hope that everyone gets a lot of use out\
  \ of them!</p> \n    <p>Lissa Guillet<br> <i>Assistant Software Developer</i></p>\
