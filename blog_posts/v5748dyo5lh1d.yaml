  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">For <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon\
  \ 2015</a>, we plan to make Organized Play even bigger than last year! I am scheduling\
  \ 210 tables of <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society</a> over four\
  \ days. We will be offering all Season 6 scenarios available to date multiple times,\
  \ including the debut of two new scenarios. In addition, we will be running scenarios\
  \ in both the existing campaign mode, as well as the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lh0h?Introducing-the-Core-Campaign\"\
  >Core Campaign mode</a>. There will multiple tables of both modes of play run in\
  \ every slot.</p> \n    <p>We are also adjusting the schedule of Pathfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying and Adventure Card Guild games being offered this year. After last\
  \ year's show, we heard many of you say that while you love PFS, you want to experience\
  \ more of the convention. Now that PaizoCon is a four day convention, we have the\
  \ ability to be more flexible with the schedule.</p> \n    <p>The morning slots\
  \ each day will host no less than 11 different PFS scenarios in both existing campaign\
  \ mode and Core Campaign mode. The afternoon slot each day will be left open so\
  \ attendees can participate in seminars (including <em>GM 101</em> and <em>GM 201</em>\
  \ sessions), have time to look around the PaizoCon store, have more time to schedule\
  \ lunch and dinner, and more opportunities to participate in the other events and\
  \ activities at the show. For the diehard PFS fans who want to play a roleplaying\
  \ or card game scenario in the afternoon slot, there will be tables available in\
  \ the open gaming area, though we will not be officially scheduling GMs for those\
  \ slots.</p> \n    <p>In addition to scenarios, we will be debuting the Season 7\
  \ Gen Con Special on Friday night. This will not be a playtest version. This Special\
  \ will be the full version that is scheduled to run at Gen Con! We will only have\
  \ the existing campaign mode of tables being run at PaizoCon. However, we will be\
  \ offering Core Campaign mode tables, in addition to existing campaign mode, of\
  \ the special at Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>We will also be offering a new type of special\
  \ on Sunday night! Since the Aspis Consortium plays an important part in fighting\
  \ the Pathfinder Society in the Season 7 Special, we wanted to offer players a chance\
  \ to see the other side of the story. Players will get the opportunity to play pregenerated\
  \ Aspis agents and attempt to defeat the Pathfinder Society! If the event sells\
  \ out, don't worry. We will also be running it as a special event one day at Gen\
  \ Con 2015. After Gen Con, this pregenerated event will be available to all four\
  \ and five star GMs to run as exclusives in their local areas. And yes, we do have\
  \ something in the works that will be a five star GM exclusive as well. It will\
  \ be announced on the Gen Con call for volunteers blog in a few weeks.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Finally, we be offering the <em>GM 101</em> and <em>GM 201</em> sessions again\
  \ in the Friday and Saturday afternoon slots. It should be an awesome time.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I need a minimum of 75 volunteer GMs for Pathfinder Society games and\
  \ I'll keep taking volunteer GMs until the slots are filled! I also need 7 Volunteer\
  \ Assistants for the showâ€”these folks will not GM, but will instead help Venture-Captain\
  \ Bob Jonquet, the lead HQ volunteer, run Pathfinder Society HQ, and will be our\
  \ go-to guys and gals for all things Pathfinder Society.</p> \n    <p>If you're\
  \ more interested in volunteering for the <a href=\"pfsacg\">Adventure Card Guild</a>,\
  \ we need 5 volunteers for for each slot. Card game volunteers will be assisting\
  \ 2 tables during each slot. These volunteers will be working the same time slots\
  \ as the Roleplaying Guild and may receive the same tier rewards.</p> \n    <p>Below\
  \ you will find the reward structure for volunteering at PaizoCon 2015. Keep in\
  \ mind that you're volunteering for slots, not a specific event. We will let you\
  \ know the slots you have been assigned to before the event lottery goes live. This\
  \ should allow you plenty of time to plan a schedule with your friends who are also\
  \ attending PaizoCon 2015.</p> \n    <h2>Volunteer Tiers and Rewards</h2> \n   \

  \ <b>must</b> have a paizo.com account and include the email the account is registered\
  \ with, along with your messageboard name in your email to me, or I won't be able\
