  \    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 25, 2008</p> \n    <p>This is a true story.*\
  \ </p> \n    <p>We Paizonians have a tradition: every year at Gen Con we invent\
  \ something. One year we invented <a href=\"/titanicGames\">Titanic Games</a>. Another\
  \ year we invented <a href=\"/pathfinder\"><i>Pathfinder</i></a>. Yet another year\
  \ we invented trans-hyperdimensional quasiphasic proton pillows (patent pending).\
  \ Last year, quite by accident, we invented <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81x6\">Yetisburg</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The gathered Paizo editorial staff (Erik Mona, James Jacobs, Jason Bulmahn,\
  \ F. Wesley Schneider, Jeremy Walker) and myself were playing rugby in the lobby\
  \ of the incredibly expensive Burg de Yeti hotel in downtown Indianapolis. It was\
  \ just after the second scrum when Jason threw his head back and howled, charging\
  \ the ball carrier (Wes) with a vicious fervor that only a man as imposing as Jason\
  \ can muster. One might say that, with his towering height and rampaging facial\
  \ hair, he looked rather... yeti-like. </p> \n    <p>Wes, not wanting to be run\
  \ over, retreated back behind his line and started rallying his team, pushing them\
  \ toward the beastly Jason Bulmahn while shouting, \"Don't be afraid of him! He's\
  \ only seven feet tall!\" Wes's teammates, Jeremy and James, took to Wes's orders\
  \ like crows to a battlefield and started flinging all manner of object at Jason:\
  \ silverware, bowling pins, a circa 1863 cannon ball, and one very angry muskrat.\
  \ These distractions caused the hulking Bulmahn to pause just long enough for an\
  \ errant Russian teapot to clonk him upside the head. He went down like a telephone\
  \ pole, crashing terribly to earth and taking myself and the rest of our team with\
  \ him. </p> \n    <p>As I struggled to extract myself from the pile of collapsed\
  \ bodies, it hit me: this could be a game! It could be about our famous rugby match\
  \ in the Burg de Yeti! And Jason would be represented <i>as</i> a yeti, with Wes\
  \ as a famous rugby general and the rest of the guys as teams of brothers fighting\
  \ against each other. Most importantly, I would need someone at least half as crazy\
  \ as me to help me design it—Mike Selinker! </p> \n    <p>Yet another Gen Con. Yet\
  \ another invention. </p> \n    <p>That's exactly how it happened. If anyone says\
  \ that, as the Paizonians gathered for dinner one night, a very tired James Jacobs\
  \ incorrectly heard an equally tired Erik Mona and then blurted out an incredulous\
  \ \"<a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81x6/\">Yetisburg</a>!?\" in response, thus causing\
  \ an idea I couldn't get out of my head, prompting me to tell Mike Selinker, and\
  \ the two of us deciding we had to make this game—well, they're probably lying.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>And that's the truth. </p> \n    <p>*Not a guarantee</p> \n    <p>Joshua\
  \ J. Frost <br> <i>Yetisburg</i> Co-Designer<br> Director of Sales &amp; Marketing</p>\
