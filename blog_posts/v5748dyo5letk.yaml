  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Greetings,\
  \ Miniatures Fiends! I am on the road in New York City for the annual Book Expo\
  \ America show, where Paizo joins the ranks of hundreds and hundreds of publishers\
  \ to show off its wares to book buyers and librarians. That means I'm about 3000\
  \ miles from my archive of Pathfinder Battles photos, but mere distance is not sufficient\
  \ to keep me from the holy calling of showing off new Pathfinder Battles prepainted\
  \ fantasy miniatures sculpts from August's <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles</a> set!</span></p> \n    <p>Last week our friends from WizKids\
  \ brought over production samples of the entire set of 55 figures, including the\
  \ massive <a href=\"/products/btpy8xrp\">Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon</a>. Many a\
  \ squee was heard from the Paizo conference room, as all in attendance agreed that\
  \ WizKids has raised the bar AGAIN, producing a set that exceeds the standards of\
  \ its predecessors in both sculpt and paint quality. The final paint jobs are just\
  \ amazing. \"THIS IS A COMMON!??!?\" was probably the most-heard phrase of the meeting,\
  \ and we're all very excited to spread that enthusiasm for the final product beyond\
  \ the hallowed walls of Paizo when the set releases in August.</p> \n    <p>So let's\
  \ move on from the bragging and pride and get to the reason you came. Let's look\
  \ at a couple new minis!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/MasterOfGales.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/MasterOfGales_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>In the Skull &amp; Shackles campaign, the\
  \ Master of the Gales serves on the Pirate Council of the Shackles and captains\
  \ his own pirate ship, but to me this bearded fellow with an imposing staff works\
  \ great for a HUGE variety of NPCs or PCs, from your nasty druidic hermit to your\
  \ unkempt grumpy wizard. This Medium figure is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WhalebonePilk.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WhalebonePilk_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Sometimes, pirate lords stick around long after they've\
  \ died. Such is the case with the insidious Whalebone Pilk, a skull-collecting cursed\
  \ undead pirate who makes for one of the spookiest opponents in the Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles campaign. Accordingly, we've worked with WizKids to make him as spooky\
  \ as possible. With plenty of clear plastic to depict the miasma in which he floats,\
  \ a nifty pirate outfit, and a nasty spear, this is one encounter your players will\
  \ never forget. Whalebone Pilk is a Medium-sized rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And with\
  \ that, I'm back to the Book Expo. Now that we have the full set's production figures\
  \ in house, expect some amazing treats in store over the next few weeks! Some of\
  \ the best figures in the set are still yet to be revealed!</p> \n    <p>Make sure\
  \ you don't miss a single figure by <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">setting up an\
  \ ongoing Pathfinder Battles subscription today</a>!</p> \n    <p>We'll see you\
  \ next week!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
