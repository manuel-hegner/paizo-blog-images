  \ <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkiy?Covered-in-Creepy-Crawlies\">look at the\
  \ set's creepy crawlies</a>, but a short detour in our journey through the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a>\
  \ won't prevent me from at least trying to stay on schedule. This week we examine\
  \ some of the fiends featured in the set: daemons and qlippoth!</p> \n     <p>Hailing\
  \ from the desolate plane of Abaddon, daemons serve the Four Horsemen in their efforts\
  \ to claim as many mortal souls as possible. Like all Outer Planes, Abaddon's primary\
  \ means of soul acquisition comes from worshipers of neutral evil deities who are\
  \ judged and sent there upon their mortal demise. But daemons' hunger is rarely\
  \ sated, and like most fiends, they are always looking for new, less scrupulous\
  \ means of growing their numbers. The terrifying astradaemon, for example, traverses\
  \ the River of Souls on the Astral Plane, like a shark, plucking unlucky victims\
  \ from their rightful path to the afterlife. With a life-draining touch, astradaemons\
  \ speed their living victims toward death, increasing the prevalence of their prey\
  \ in the River of Souls. The astradaemon is a Large rare figure.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180312-Astradaemon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180312-Astradaemon_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Exhibiting cephalopod, crustacean, and humanoid features,\
  \ the menacing venom daemon uses potent poison to bring low its enemies. Native\
  \ to the swampy or fully aquatic regions of Abaddon, venom daemons target the strongest\
  \ of their foes first, both as a tactical choice and for the emotional impact when\
  \ foes see the greatest among them fall. The venom daemon is a Medium rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180312-VenomDaemon.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Older even than deamonkind are the qlippoth of the\
  \ Abyss, whose hatred for the myriad demons who now rule their home plane knows\
  \ no bounds. Last week we looked at the spider-like thulgant qlippoth, but it's\
  \ just one of the four qlippoths <em>Jungle of Despair</em> has to offer. First\
  \ this week is the ravenous qlippoth, whose body takes the form of a writhing ball\
  \ of intertwined intestines and toothy mouths, an anatomy that serves it well as\
  \ the scavenger of the Abyss. The ravenous qlippoth is a Medium uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180312-RavenousQlippoth.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180312-RavenousQlippoth_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The slightly more powerful infectious qlippoth is a\
  \ manifestation of the Abyss's fecundity, spreading pain and suffering throughout\
  \ the multiverse. The monocular, tentacle-covered beasts are capable of travel to\
  \ other planes, where they spread misfortune indiscriminately. The infectious qlippoth\
  \ is a Large uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180312-InfectiousQlippoth.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180312-InfectiousQlippoth_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Finally, we come to the gongorinan qlippoth, the crablike\
  \ spawn of the qlippoth lord, Yamasoth, who was himself closely associated with\
  \ Alaznist, the final Runelord of Wrath. A medium rare figure, the gongorinan qlippoth\
  \ (along with most of the other figures in this week's preview) is sure to serve\
  \ Game Masters running the forthcoming <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/returnOfTheRunelords\"\
  >Return of the Runelords Adventure Path</a> well.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>That's all for now, folks! I hope you survived our\
  \ glimpse into the Abyss (and Abaddon). Next week we'll return to the jungles of\
  \ Golarion with a look at some of the mortal rivals your adventurers may encounter\
  \ along their journey into despair.</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Franchise\
