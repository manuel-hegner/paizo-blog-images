  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Three-day US holiday weekends brings a plethora\
  \ of conventions, especially in inclement weather months when indoor hobbies reign\
  \ supreme. I just got back from GenghisCon in Aurora, Colorado, and leave tomorrow\
  \ for Mace West in Asheville, North Carolina. The advantage of attending mid-sized\
  \ shows comes in having time to focus on the community and interact with attendees\
  \ on a personal level. Some of my favorite moments come from running games. Watching\
  \ a player succeed at a skill or discover a bit of lore energizes me! Talking tips\
  \ and tricks with other GMs allows me to take bits for my own toolbox. There are\
  \ many facets of our organized play program that I enjoy working with, but interactions\
  \ with our community usually tops the list.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of the Org Play\
  \ programs, our current focus involves working through our to-do checklist of items\
  \ for Pathfinder Society 2 and work towards making decisions based on our surveys\
  \ from last fall and the finalized version of the Pathfinder rules. If your curious\
  \ about the checklist, you can <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgia?Playtest-is-over-so-what-s-the-plan\"\
  >read about it here</a>. We've pretty much wrapped discussion on factions. We look\
  \ forward to introducing them to you once the art we ordered for them makes its\
  \ way to the office. We are working to get decisions on replay.</p> \n    <p>One\
  \ of our ongoing discussions is the <em>Guide to Play</em>. Looking over the survey\
  \ data, a quick start guide received overwhelming support. Before the team starts\
  \ their discussion, I want to delve deeper about what our community thinks of a\
  \ quick start guide. As a baseline, I envision 4-10 pages in an easy to read format,\
  \ compressing dense paragraphs into charts and examples where possible. Given the\
  \ limited page count, what do you think is the most important information to include\
  \ in this guide? I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below!</p> \n  \
  \  <p>On the subject of guides. We decided not to change the format of the Starfinder\
  \ Society guide this year. We think tackling one guide from the ground up poses\
  \ enough of a challenge. It is our intention to update the SFS Guide for Year 2\
  \ to reflect the minor changes needed to bring it up to date before we launch the\
  \ year at Origins. Once we have feedback on the new Pathfinder Society, we will\
  \ look at how we can integrate changes in the Starfinder Society Guide for Year\
  \ 3.</p> \n    <p>Next week will be our monthly Organized Playroundup. Join us then\
  \ for stars, conventions, and other news!</p> \n    <p>Until next timeâ€”Explore,\
  \ Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Manager</i></p>\
