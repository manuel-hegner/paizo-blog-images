  description\">Friday brings the smell of fresh plastic wafting on the winds, a sure\
  \ sign that it's time again to preview some digital sculpts for October's <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted\
  \ miniatures! As we prep for PaizoCon next weekend, we're heading into a big week\
  \ for Paizo, so I wanted to take the time to focus on a couple of \"big\" miniatures\
  \ in the setâ€”namely two of my favorites!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160520-Ankhrav.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160520-Ankhrav_360.jpeg\"></a> \n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Here we have the Ankhrav Drone, a new name for a classic creature found\
  \ on page 15 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\
  \ Bestiary</em></a>. The story behind this burrowing, bug-like monster's origin\
  \ is quite interesting. The standard version, with a name gate-locked by our inability\
  \ to include the Open Game License on the bottom of every figure, also was saddled\
  \ with an illustration that wasn't too inspiring, and that didn't seem to me like\
  \ it would make a good miniature. Still, it's a very useful creature in general,\
  \ and eventually I want to make sure we make every creature in the first <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8auu\"><em>Bestiary</em></a> (if not all the others), so I had a lot\
  \ of impetus to make the figure, but knew we'd need a better illustration (for minis\
  \ purposes) AND a new name for the creature. Enter the <a href=\"/pathfinder/campaignSetting\"\
  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting</a> book <a href=\"/products/btpy9aue\"><em>Belkzen,\
  \ Hold of the Orc Lords</em></a>. That book introduced the Ankhrav, a Huge cousin\
  \ of the classic <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><em>Bestiary</em></a> monster, and\
  \ positioned it more as a brood queen for the standard Large version of the character.\
  \ It also had a very cool illustration that, when coupled with the re-do we put\
  \ into the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tj5\"><em>Pathfinder Pawns Bestiary Box</em></a>\
  \ created the new look for this creature. I'm pretty happy with how it all turned\
  \ out, and look forward to having this guy burrow his way up from under my player\
  \ characters! The Ankhrav Drone is a Large figure at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160520-Gynosphinx.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160520-Gynosphinx_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>The Gynosphinx is a classic dungeon creature that we've\
  \ somehow not managed to produce in more than 10 <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> sets. I think we've been waiting for the right piece of\
  \ art, and with this version, we've finally got it. Sure, she's a bit Liz Taylor,\
  \ but I'd hardly call that a problem. Ahem. Anyway, the Gynosphinx is a Large, rare\
  \ figure. </p>\n    <p>And that's all I've got for this week. We will likely NOT\
  \ have a Publisher Preview next week, as I'll be at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>\
  \ with the rest of the Paizo staff. I WILL be revealing some new figures at the\
  \ Preview Banquet on Saturday night, though, so keep your eyes on the Internet to\
  \ see if you can't find some camera phone photos before we formally share them here\
  \ after the convention.</p> \n    <p>And if you ARE coming to <a href=\"/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon</a>, don't forget the 9th-annual Miniatures Trading Afterparty in the\
  \ hotel bar immediately after the conclusion of the convention on Monday. I'll have\
  \ piles of <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> goodies, and it's\
  \ a great chance to swap doubles with other miniatures fiends in the community.\
  \ Plastic, metal, painted, unpainted. Bring it all! Dump stuff you don't want anymore\
  \ for new stuff you never knew you wanted. It's one of my favorite parts of the\
  \ convention, and I look forward to seeing many of you there!</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ then (and after), I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
