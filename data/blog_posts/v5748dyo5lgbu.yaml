  \ up your Subscription at Gen Con 2014</h2> \n     <p><b>What does choosing to pick\
  \ up at Gen Con mean?</b><br> Shortly before the convention we will charge your\
  \ card and, where appropriate, give you access to the corresponding PDF. (This will\
  \ happen at the same time as subscribers who aren't picking up at Gen Con—your PDFs\
  \ won't be delayed by choosing to pick up at Gen Con.) For convention pickup, 7%\
  \ sales tax will be added to your order—but you won't pay any shipping fees. If\
  \ you choose to pick up your subscriptions at Gen Con, you must pick up your subscriptions\
  \ from the Paizo booth by Saturday, August 16th when the exhibitor hall closes to\
  \ guarantee that we will have all of the items in stock for your order.</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>When is my payment method charged?</b><br> Estimated order spawning and\
  \ payment method authorization date for August Subscriptions: Thursday, July 31st,\
  \ 2014<br> Estimated date to process orders and settle charges on payment methods\
  \ for Gen Con Subscription pick up orders: August 4th, 2014</p> \n     <p><b>When\
  \ do I have to pick up my subscription by?</b><br> In order to make sure you are\
  \ able to get all of your subscription items, we recommend picking up your subscriptions\
  \ as soon as possible once you get to Gen Con. We are only able to ensure availability\
  \ of subscription products through Saturday when the exhibitor hall closes. You\
  \ can still come by for subscription pick up on Sunday, but we can't guarantee the\
  \ subscription items availability after Saturday evening.</p> \n     <p><b>What\
  \ do I need to pick up my subscription items?</b><br> Bring your ID, and make sure\
  \ you know what email address you use for logging into Paizo.com. Printing off your\
  \ order confirmation email or having it accessible on a smartphone is helpful.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>What happens if I choose to pick up at Gen Con but end up not being\
  \ able to pick up my items?</b><br> If you select the option on the website to pick\
  \ up subscriptions at Gen Con but do not actually pick them up at the show, the\
  \ sales tax will be credited to your account, you will be charged for shipping and\
  \ we will ship your items to you as soon as possible (usually within 2-3 weeks after\
  \ the convention).</p> \n     <p><b>Is there anything else I might want to keep\
  \ in mind when deciding if I want to pick up my subscriptions at Gen Con?</b><br>\
  \ There are a lot of items that can be picked up this year! If you subscribe to\
  \ multiple subscription lines, you'll want to keep in mind how much room you have\
  \ in your suitcase, especially for the Adventure Card Game Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ Base Set which is a very big box (14.25 x 12.75 x 4 inches)!</p> \n     <p><b>I\
  \ can't make it to Gen Con, can my friend, family member, partner, husband/wife\
  \ pick up my subscriptions?</b><br> Nope, subscriptions must be picked up by the\
  \ account holder. We will not release subscription pick ups to anyone but the subscriber.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>If I don't have a subscription for a product line, can I still sign\
  \ up for one and choose to pick it up at Gen Con?</b><br> Yes! Just start the subscription\
  \ like normal and as long you start with the August item before the July 29th, 2pm\
  \ deadline, it will be added to your subscriptions for pick up at Gen Con.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>What if I preorder a new release? Will it be available for pick up along\
  \ with my subscription items?</b><br> We will have all the August new releases for\
  \ sale at the convention, but subscription pick up only works for items you have\
  \ subscriptions for and does not work for preorders.</p> \n     <p><b>What if I\
  \ have more questions about picking up subscription items?</b><br> Let customer\
  \ service know! You can email us at customer.service@paizo.com, post in the <a href=\"\
  /threads/rzs2r8th?August-New-Release-Shipment-thread\">Customer Service forum</a>,\
  \ or you can give us a call (425-250-0800, Monday through Friday, 10:00 AM - 5:00\
  \ PM Pacific time).</p> \n     <p>See you in 3 short weeks!</p> \n     <p>Sara Marie<br>\
