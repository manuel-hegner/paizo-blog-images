  \ back again with a report from their play through of <a href=\"/btpy9uk0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-122-Into-the-Shattered-Continent\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #122: Into the Shattered Continent</em></a>! As usual,\
  \ there be spoilers! Read the following at your own risk!</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>In our first marathon of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lkc1?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-1\"\
  >The Azlant Odyssey</a>, we got off to the finest start in any of our projects for\
  \ the Paizo Blog: we discovered an ample amount of treasure, held party deaths to\
  \ a zero count, and acquired enough allies to put together a solid team for any\
  \ challenge that might present itself. For this second marathon, we wanted to capitalize\
  \ on our early gains by significantly developing the colony of Talmandor's Bounty\
  \ while exploring the island around it, and \"Into the Shattered Continent\" offered\
  \ exactly that.</p> \n      <p>To enhance immersion, we brought the beach to us\
  \ by utilizing <a href=\"http://adventurescents.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AdventureScents</a>\
  \ to make the room smell like a sandy coast. We also engaged several live-NPCs to\
  \ play the roles of colonists and other indigenous inhabitants of ancient Azlant,\
  \ complete with a locathah mask that stared back at us the entire time. Lastly,\
  \ our GM assembled a collection of images to project on the wall that matched locations\
  \ we'd be visiting, as well as a soundtrack that included hours of waves crashing\
  \ against the shore.</p> \n      <p>This adventure was divided into three parts,\
  \ with the first being one of the largest sandboxes we've ever come across in 145\
  \ published adventures that we’ve played. So massive, in fact, that we pushed our\
  \ GM near the limit and broke our record for the longest single marathon in Order\
  \ of the Amber Die history!</p> \n      <ul>\n       <li>Adventure: <a href=\"/btpy9uk0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-122-Into-the-Shattered-Continent\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #122: Into the Shattered Continent</em></a></li>\
  \ \n       <li>Marathon Length: 119 hours, 45 minutes</li> \n       <li>Session\
  \ Hours: 68 hours, 10 minutes</li>\n      </ul> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \      </div> \n      <h2>Highlights from Into the Shattered Continent:</h2> \n\
  \      <ul>\n       <li>The marathon opened with shock and betrayal. Having accidentally\
  \ chosen to bring two dominated colonists into our midst at the end of \"The Lost\
  \ Outpost\", they turned against the colony in the downtime between adventures.\
  \ Orchestrating a surprise raid by skum, the traitors targeted our spellcasters\
  \ and caught nearly all of them alone or off-guard. Two of the colony's respected\
  \ priests were slain, but we fought off the assault with aid from a couple of celedons,\
  \ whom afterwards insisted on teaching all present how the goddess Acavna (not the\
  \ party) had granted us a successful defense of the colony.</li> \n       <li>Searching\
  \ the ruins of Azlant has turned up much in the way of Pathfinder Society lore,\
  \ and through opportunity three of us are now members (Ezren, Kyra, and Lyra). Alright,\
  \ we'll stop holding back. We got to follow in the footsteps of an expedition from\
  \ the first EVER Pathfinder Chronicles! And there's more...</li> \n       <li>The\
  \ island of Ancorato is not an easy place to traverse, and it literally bled us:\
  \ blood-sucking stirges, a blood-obsessed sea hag, blood-draining ugothols, a blood-siphoning\
  \ shark, blood-feeding plants, blood-drinking chupacabras, blood-frenzied sahuagin,\
  \ blood-empowered vampiric mists, and an evil gillman cleric with the blood subdomain.\
  \ Lesser restoration, please?</li> \n       <li>In the final encounter, we faced\
  \ our second betrayal when our closest friend and confidant, Carver Hastings, turned\
  \ into a faceless stalker who had long ago replaced him. Worse, his allies—also\
  \ former friends but now stalkers—tried to burn us alive in the colony's government\
  \ building. All but Ezren escaped out of the windows, when Valeros decided to eschew\
  \ safety by kicking down the front doors and going back in after the old man. With\
  \ Kyra's air bubble to protect him from smoke inhalation, the fighter waded into\
  \ the flames to save our wizard, and gave us one of the best slow-motion rescues\
  \ of any campaign.</li> \n       <li>The Amber Die itself got behind this adventure\
  \ and dished out some pain, with nine natural 20s that left some heroes facedown.\
  \ We dodged the die when it mattered most, though!</li>\n      </ul> \n      <div\

  ></a>\n      </div> \n      <h2>The Odyssey</h2> \n      <p>Author Robert Brookes\
  \ referred to this adventure as \"a sandbox of exploration and discovery,\" and\
  \ its myriad encounters perfectly expanded the feel of our continuing odyssey. While\
  \ survival was the premier skill for volume one, diplomacy became the focus skill\
  \ of volume two. We entreated a water naga for aid, stopped a witch hunt, quelled\
  \ a hunger strike, bartered with locathah, counseled a larcenous teenager, forged\
  \ an alliance with indigenous creatures, intervened when tensions rose among colonists,\
  \ solved a kidnapping, comforted a blind cyclops, and traded magic items with a\
  \ paguroida.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20180129-ReefBattle.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      </div> \n      <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n      <p>While we don't\
  \ have any iconic character deaths to report, we did want to devote this section\
  \ to a colonist whom we had come to know and respect. Anya Sandstrider accompanied\
  \ us on several excursions, where she taught us how to better spot danger, discover\
  \ tracks, and even hunt boar. Our mistake was taking our friend out of her element\
  \ on our deepest dive yet: a reef swarming with sahuagin and sharks. When we were\
  \ surrounded by hammerheads and the future was murky, it was her spear and timely\
  \ calm animals that gave us a momentary lifeline. Ezren fired off a buoyancy spell\
  \ and we shot for the surface, but it wasn't until we reached air that we realized\
  \ Anya wasn't with us anymore.</p> \n      <h2>Best Quote From Marathon 2</h2> \n\
  \      <p><b>Adam</b> (GM): Alright guys, welcome to marathon two of The Azlant\
  \ Odyssey. Kyra, make a Fort save or die, coup de grace.<br> <b>Kyra</b> (nervously):\
  \ Ummm...ummm...ummm...24?<br> <b>Adam</b> (GM): You survive. Twelve damage. You\
  \ awaken from a normal night's sleep to see a skum standing over you, with its trident\
  \ in your gut and blood spilling out onto the sheets. Roll initiative.</p> \n  \
  \    <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n      <p>We managed to thoroughly scout the island,\
  \ discover generous Azlanti lore, and fend off an attack from within by an enemy\
  \ we know very little about. Despite repeated betrayals from old friends, we couldn't\
  \ have made it through this adventure without our newfound allies: a locathah ranger\
  \ named Koloshkora, and a young strix oracle called Oorka. Our party now has the\
  \ ability to draw on playmakers that excel in specific environments, with the locathah\
  \ leading underwater, and the strix aiding overland. Our next move is to figure\
  \ out who or what has been guiding the repeated attempts to subvert our colony—\
  and eliminate them.</p> \n      <h2>More Content</h2> \n      <p>For character builds,\
