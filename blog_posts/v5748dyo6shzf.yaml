  \ Pathfinder Second Edition has the most support, as you can see from the high-performing\
  \ titles listed below, so we here at Paizo encourage creators with an idea for a\
  \ Starfinder, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, or Pathfinder First Edition product\
  \ to put it up on the marketplace; now’s the time to capitalize on limited competition!\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Advice For Publishers</h2> \n     <p>Over\
  \ the 5+ months Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite have been live, I’ve noticed\
  \ some trends in what seems to resonate with the audience, what sells well, and\
  \ what makes the content creators the most money for their effort and passion. I\
  \ thought I’d take this opportunity to pass on some advice for the benefit of the\
  \ entire Infinite community, but specifically for the benefit of those of you who\
  \ are putting time and efforts into making products for the platforms.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>First, a good cover goes a long way. I can’t stress how important even a\
  \ single image and readable text are on your cover. Even using one of the many monster\
  \ or NPC illustrations that have been made available on the Paizo Blog over the\
  \ years, or in the Pathfinder/Starfinder Infinite art packs, seems to have a noticeable\
  \ effect on sales. If you’re having trouble deciding what image to use, or can’\
  t figure out how to use the templates provided on the Infinite platform, consider\
  \ reaching out to other community creators for help and advice. Everyone can remember\
  \ their first attempt, and most folks are happy to pay their knowledge and experience\
  \ forward (as long as you aren’t expecting them to lay out your entire book.)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Second, proofread your product description! While a picture is worth\
  \ a thousand words, if one of the few dozen words someone can see before deciding\
  \ to buy a product is misspelled, that word is an outlier and certainly worth an\
  \ entire picture unto itself. Run any text the public is going to see by a second\
  \ set of eyes, even if it’s a significant other, member of your gaming group, or\
  \ a friend online. It’s easy to overlook our own mistakes, and often something we’\
  ve overlooked a dozen times will be immediately caught by someone on their first\
  \ readthrough. How you describe your product is as important as the product itself,\
  \ so give that sales copy one extra read before you post it.</p> \n     <p>Next,\
  \ consider making content that specifically supports or builds on new or popular\
  \ releases, be it additional NPCs or encounters for an Adventure Path, shops and\
  \ plot hooks for a region or settlement, or a short story set in the leadup to or\
  \ aftermath of a major event in the setting. It’s been a few months since folks\
  \ got their hands on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens\"\
  ><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>, and we’re going to start promoting Absalom-based\
  \ content with a special banner and other marketing pushes. Expect similar support\
  \ for the forthcoming Starfinder Drift Crisis meta-event and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis\"\
  >hardcover</a>. And eventually, we’d love to have enough content tied to specific\
  \ APs to break those out into their own content hubs. Such publications have a built-in\
  \ audience of GMs and players who are already invested in the associated campaigns\
  \ and can increase your products’ reach and sales.</p> \n     <p>Finally, don’t\
  \ undervalue your work. While the options to make your product free or pay what\
  \ you want exist, far too often publishers fall back on these due to a lack of confidence\
  \ in their work’s ability to sell at higher prices. Don’t do that! You worked hard\
  \ on your product and people will give you money for it. My experience has shown\
  \ that they’ll usually give you another 20-50% more than you think it’s worth. So,\
  \ if you’re stuck at pricing your product, have some faith in yourself and the quality\
  \ of your work and set it for $2, $5, whatever, instead of setting that same amount\
  \ as a suggested price. Products offered for free (or free transactions of pay-what-you-want\
  \ products) also don’t get counted by the site’s algorithms when determining bestsellers\
  \ or best-seller badges, so even something getting a lot of downloads isn’t necessarily\
  \ going to get more attention after if falls off the new releases list.</p> \n \
  \    <h2>Other DriveThruRPG News</h2> \n     <p>While not directly Infinite-related,\
  \ I wanted to also draw attention to other offerings on the DriveThruRPG storefront.\
  \ Most notably, we’ve now got nearly 20 out-of-print Pathfinder titles available\
  \ for Print-on-Demand, including all 4 out-of-print volumes of the Shattered Star\
