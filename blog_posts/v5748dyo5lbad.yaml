  \   </table>\n  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Damiel Morgethai was born, as so\
  \ many elves are, in the nation of Kyonin. One of innumerable scions of the prestigious\
  \ Morgethai family, he grew up in the picturesque town of Riverspire, where the\
  \ southwestern border of Kyonin’s great forest gives way to fertile, rolling plains.\
  \ When finally old enough to pursue a trade, the exceedingly precocious young elf\
  \ was loaded up with what funds his family could spare and packed off to the shining\
  \ capital of Iadara, to study alchemy under several of the art’s great masters.\
  \ And it was here that the trouble started.</p> \n   <p>Damiel took to alchemy immediately,\
  \ reveling in the idea of transmutation—the changing of one thing into another,\
  \ by means chemical or arcane. “Alchemy,” he was fond of proclaiming to his friends,\
  \ “is pure magic, even when it isn’t.” Within a few short years, the brilliant and\
  \ studious Damiel had learned enough from his instructors that they set him loose\
  \ to pursue his own studies, becoming advisors and respected colleagues rather than\
  \ true masters.</p> \n   <p>Yet he had learned more than just strange formulae in\
  \ Iadara. As cheerful and innocent as it seemed on the surface, Damiel’s obsession\
  \ with what he called “the Change” went beyond the simple curatives of an apothecary,\
  \ beyond even the magical and explosive concoctions of those alchemists trained\
  \ for battle. In his eternal quest to understand his theories better, Damiel gave\
  \ himself literally to his studies, and began to use his concoctions on his own\
  \ flesh, striving to unlock the full potential of his body. What emerged from those\
  \ long, sleepless nights was someone new. Someone dangerous.</p> \n   <p>Officially,\
  \ Damiel’s banishment from Kyonin was the result of plagiarizing another alchemist’\
  s discoveries, or perhaps siring an illegitimate son with an embarrassed noble.\
  \ The documents don’t speak of the way his former friends noticed the change in\
  \ his eyes, which became increasingly wild as lack of sleep and increasing amounts\
  \ of “invigorating aether” took their toll. They don’t note the sudden rash of crimes\
  \ in the districts he frequented, daring thefts and capricious arson. And they certainly\
  \ don’t mention the young woman found in the alley behind his apartment, her face\
  \ burned near away in an ultimately successful attempt to hide her identity—and\
  \ the identity of her killer. In truth, the later would be difficult to decipher\
  \ anyway, as even the killer himself might have trouble recognizing the monster\
  \ that would take a girl’s life simply for seeing something she shouldn’t.</p> \n\
  \   <p>For Damiel was no longer the man that he once was. In his thirst for ever-greater\
  \ secrets, he had unlocked enormous potential—strange tinctures that quickened his\
  \ movements to a blur, or twisted his constitution to survive any poison or malady.\
  \ Yet while he gained ever-increasing control over the vagaries of his flesh, these\
  \ discoveries took their toll on his mind. He fell deep into addiction, deeper than\
  \ even the aether he was so fond of could match. He would lose himself to the Change,\
  \ only to wake from a maddened stupor and find that he’d done terrible things. And\
  \ worse, that he no longer cared.</p> \n   <p>Exiled from his homeland, Damiel wandered\
  \ for many years, slowly learning to control and live with his addictions. Gone\
  \ were the blackouts, the uncontrolled and senseless violence. In their place grew\
  \ a hard and haunted-eyed young man, handsome save for his wild look and the puckered\
  \ scars along his veins. Seeking to peddle his secret knowledge, he traveled to\
  \ Daggermark in the River Kingdoms, joining up with that city’s Poisoners’ Guild.\
  \ For a time, his unique concoctions made him a minor celebrity in certain circles.\
  \ But as the months passed, Damiel’s control over his base nature slipped, and the\
  \ old lust for the beautiful chaos of unconscious (and unconscionable) action took\
  \ over, loosing the beast of the Change to walk the streets. In the end, the Poisoners’\
  \ Guild took terminal offense to Damiel’s “exploits,” and though the elf argued\
  \ hard that his deviant handiwork—being unpaid—was none of the guild’s concern,\
  \ he was forced to go his own way once again. </p> \n   <p>Today, Damiel has grown\
  \ further, into a man of two minds. The first—the greatest remaining shadow of the\
  \ Damiel Morgethai That Was—truly repents for the arbitrary and senseless suffering\
  \ he’s caused, and attempts to keep his darker urges in check. The second is that\
  \ man brought forth by the Change, the mad and capricious soul that holds all other\
  \ creatures in contempt, and exists only to feel the heat of the explosion on his\
  \ face or see the shifting colors of poisoned flesh. This latter comes forth primarily\
  \ in combat, where Damiel’s potions push his body faster than it has any right to\
  \ move, flitting through the fray to fling corrosive ash or nick warriors so delicately\
  \ with his poisoned injection-blade that many don’t know they’ve been cut until\
  \ they find themselves unable to breathe. Though Damiel no longer gives his vile\
  \ tendencies full rein, and carries himself well in social situations, most who\
  \ look into those bagged and bloodshot eyes quickly understand the truth of his\
  \ nature: unbalanced, unstable, unpredictable—and totally indispensable in a fight,\
  \ which is why he still manages to fall in with other adventurers from time to time.\
  \ And as he continues to mature, some of them even survive his companionship.</p>\
