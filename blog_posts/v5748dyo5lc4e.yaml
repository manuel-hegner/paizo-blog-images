  \   <p>Every Tuesday until the book's release, we are going to be digging into some\
  \ of the new rules and options you will find in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8g7s\"\
  >Ultimate Magic</a>. After a bit of a mix up last week, this week we are going to\
  \ take a look at the new base class, the magus, and the archetypes slated to appear\
  \ in this book.</p> \n   <p>From its first appearance as part of the playtest of\
  \ this book, the magus has gone through a number of iterations. The second playtest\
  \ version of the class is, in fact, quite a bit similar to the final version of\
  \ the class, with a number of clarifications made to make things work a bit more\
  \ smoothly. Take a look at the revised spell strike ability, for example.</p> \n\
  \   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Spellstrike (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, whenever a magus\
  \ casts a spell with a range of \"touch\" from the magus spell list, he can deliver\
  \ the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead\
  \ of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus\
  \ can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus)\
  \ as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal\
  \ damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the magus makes this attack in\
  \ concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by\
  \ spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20,\
  \ 19–20, or 18–20 and modified by the <i>keen</i> weapon property or similar effects),\
  \ but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while\
  \ the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier. </p> \n   </blockquote> \n \
  \  <p>As you can see, we clarified how the attack worked, and how critical hits\
  \ were handled when using this ability. In addition, we replaced the pool spell\
  \ abilities with ones that are a bit more in line with the flavor of the class.\
  \ Take a look at these.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Spell Recall (Su)</b>:\
  \ At 4th level, the magus learns to use his arcane pool to recall spells he has\
  \ already cast. With a swift action he can recall any single magus spell that he\
  \ has already prepared and cast that day by expending a number of points from his\
  \ arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). The spell is prepared again,\
  \ just as if it had not been cast. <br> <b>Improved Spell Recall (Su)</b>: At 11th\
  \ level, the magus's ability to recall spells using his arcane pool becomes more\
  \ efficient. Whenever he recalls a spell with spell recall, he expends a number\
  \ of points from his arcane pool equal to 1/2 the spell's level (minimum 1). Furthermore,\
  \ instead of recalling a used spell, as a swift action the magus can prepare a spell\
  \ of the same level that he has in his spellbook. He does so by expending a number\
  \ of points from his arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). The magus\
  \ cannot apply metamagic feats to a spell prepared in this way. The magus does not\
  \ need to reference his spellbook to prepare a spell in this way.</p> \n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n   <p>So, that is a taste of the sorts of changes you can expect to see with\
  \ the base class itself, but how about those archetypes? Here is a list of all the\
  \ magus archetypes in the book, with a short description of each.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Magus Archetypes</b><br> <b>Bladebound</b>: A magus with this archtype\
  \ is bound to a special sword, called a black blade, that gains powers, and over\
  \ time, sentience.<br> <b>Hexcrafter</b>: Using the powers of a witch, this magus\
  \ can use hexes and can curse his enemies.<br> <b>Spellblade</b>: Capable of creating\
  \ a light blade of pure force, the spellblade can wield two weapons and still cast\
  \ his spells.<br> <b>Staff Magus</b>: Skilled at using the quarterstaff, these powerful\
  \ magi can eventually treat any magic staff as a deadly weapon.</p> \n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n   <p>That wraps up our preview for this week. Come back next week when we will\
  \ examine some of the ways this book will help you master magic.</p> \n   <p>Jason\
