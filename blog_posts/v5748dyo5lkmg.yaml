  \ itemprop=\"description\">March has been a month for announcements, most notably\
  \ the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkl9?First-Look-at-the-Pathfinder-Playtest\"\
  >Pathfinder Second Edition announcement</a> two weeks ago. In case you missed it,\
  \ also be sure to check out the <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest/faq#v5748eaic9wes\"\
  >FAQ for Pathfinder Society in the new edition</a> as well as the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lklx?Pathfinder-Society-2-Expanding-on-the-FAQ\"\
  >follow-up blog from last week</a>, when we provided even more information about\
  \ the upcoming campaign and how we're soliciting your feedback to help shape the\
  \ experience. Expect another blog soon, exploring ways we're aiming to handle the\
  \ playtest and other topics.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of exploration, we have new adventures\
  \ this week!</p> \n    <p>Ever since <a href=\"/products/btpy9qcb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-816-House-of-Harmonious-Wisdom\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-16: House of Harmonious Wisdom</em></a>, the\
  \ team's been excited to include more quest content into our yearly schedule. This\
  \ season we take a long-overdue trip to Isger, where the government has recently\
  \ declassified documents from the Goblinblood Wars, whose wounds still feel fresh\
  \ two decades later. Among the papers is a reference to the Irrica family, who possessed\
  \ a powerful weapon that kept them safe from House Thrune's interference. These\
  \ documents provide enough leads to reassemble that tool, but anything potent enough\
  \ to spook Cheliax's ruling family is too dangerous to leave where anyone can find\
  \ it. In the Tier 1-5 <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-16-Fallen-Family-Broken-Name\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-16: Fallen Family, Broken Name</em></a>, the\
  \ PCs dig into the wars' aftermath—including the involvement of the goblins, Druman\
  \ Blackjackets, and Hellknights—and travel across Isger.</p> \n    <p>Not only has\
  \ this been a great opportunity to work with the authors Saif Ansari, Louis Manko\
  \ Levite, Kendra Leigh Speedling, Kevin Willis, and Scott Young, but it's also been\
  \ a great chance for our newest developer Michael Sayre to work on scenarios. It's\
  \ the kind of experience you'd want to repeat again and again, which is great because\
  \ these quests are freely replayable with 1st-level characters.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ \n    <p>What if you're in the mood for something a bit more dangerous? Then check\
  \ out this month's Tier 5-9 scenario, <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-17-Oath-of-the-Overwatched\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-17: Oath of the Overwatched</em></a>, brought\
  \ to you by Isabelle Lee. The Blakros Museum has seen its fair share of troubles\
  \ over the years, but today's events have Zarta Dralneen and Venture-Captain Ambrus\
  \ Valsin rushing to the scene personally. The mysterious copper gate beneath the\
  \ museum is dissolving into a morass of twisted space at the behest of beings from\
  \ beyond the stars. The PCs will need more than strength in battle if they hope\
  \ to charge beyond the gate, stop these beings' foul plots, and return with their\
  \ sanity intact. The poor soul shown in this image by Teresa Guido was not so fortunate.\
  \ Isabelle did a great job providing interesting and varied ways for the PCs to\
  \ unravel the story of the accursed realm, including a particularly unusual NPC\
  \ in the second portion. If you want to know more, you'll need to send your PCs\
  \ in to find out, or gather up a group of brave players.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
