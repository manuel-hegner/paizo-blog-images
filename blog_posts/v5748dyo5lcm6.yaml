  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>The Seventh Execution</h1> \n   <p>by Amber\
  \ E. Scott</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: The Watcher Watched</h2> \n   <p>Her or me.\
  \ It was <i>her or me</i>.</p> \n   <p>After the execution, after too many sleepless\
  \ nights, afraid to face the waiting nightmares, I had to put the matter behind\
  \ me.</p> \n   <p>\"It was her or me,\" I declared, then made myself believe it.\
  \ If I stopped, though, if I ceased whispering my mantra under my breath when I\
  \ was alone, if I left off repeating it in my mind until I nodded off at night,\
  \ the horror of the day returned. It seeped into my thoughts in sudden and startling\
  \ ways. Firelight glinting on a kitchen knife recalled Razor Jenni's blade. Wagon\
  \ wheels rumbling on the cobblestone street brought back the murmuring crowd. Raw\
  \ meat on the cutting block, waiting for dinnerâ€”</p> \n   <p>Her or <i>me</i>.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I had worked hard all day. Now that night had come I found that sleep\
  \ would not visit. I lay motionless on my cot, eyes fixed on the ceiling, listening\
  \ to the house settle around me. This used to be my favorite time of day, when I\
  \ could rest my body and free my mind, letting my fancies take me to lands free\
  \ from toil and fear. Now my fancies took me to very different places. I distracted\
  \ myself by running through the list of chores for the next day: stop the wood-cart\
  \ when it came around and purchase two bundles on account, put a roast in at noon\
  \ so that it would be ready for dinner, take the curtains down in the library and\
  \ wash and press them, clean the windows while the curtains hung on the line. I\
  \ hated windows more than any other chore. While a stepstool and creative leveraging\
  \ allowed me to do human-sized tasks in every other area of the master's house,\
  \ windows required a ladder and endless climbing up and down.</p> \n   <p>I'd lifted\
  \ a pot full of soup earlier that day and aggravated an old strain in my back. My\
  \ head pounded like the drums before an execution. I sat up. The moonlight coming\
  \ through the gabled window illuminated the old boxes and trunks piled in the room.\
  \ Most halfling servants have to be content with half-rooms under stairs, attached\
  \ sheds half the height of the rest of the house, or even cupboards. To sleep in\
  \ an attic, even one with a close and slanted ceiling and mice that ran over me\
  \ in the middle of the night, was luxury. </p> \n   <p>I rose from my cot and stretched,\
  \ trying to ease my aches. The floorboards felt cool under the curls of hair covering\
  \ my feet. I padded to the window and leaned on the sill.</p> \n   <p>The quiet\
  \ streets of Edme stretched away, disappearing into a maze of stone walls and peaked\
  \ roofs. I often stood here, looking for furtive movements or cloaked figures, any\
  \ signs that Cheliax worked to invade our free nation with their bound devils and\
  \ sorcery. My father had served my master's father and remembered the start of the\
  \ Red Revolution and the oppression that came before it. When others were in earshot,\
  \ he would tell me stories of Chelish dominance and the nobles' excesses, a time\
  \ when halflings were downtrodden \"slips\" and not respected servants. When we\
  \ were alone, he cautioned me that those without use to the nation were the first\
  \ fingered as traitors.</p> \n   <p>\"As long as you keep finding spies and turncoats\
  \ for the master, you'll never find yourself in Razor Jenni's arms.\"</p> \n   <div\

  0\"></a>\n    <br> \"In Galt, it's best to never be noticed at all. Fortunately,\
  \ halflings are good at that.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>There are always traitors in\
  \ Galt. I had become an expert at spotting them by the darkness in their eyes and\
  \ the rhythm of their gait. My master traveled to Isarn once a month to serve on\
  \ the Revolutionary Council, and he used my eyes to improve his standing there.\
  \ Together we had sent six traitors and Chelish sympathizers to their final rest.\
  \ Six that I am certain were guilty.</p> \n   <p>And one that I am not.</p> \n \
  \  <p>My mind threatened to sprint down those familiar paths once more. I focused\
  \ instead on the dark street below, watching for unusual activity. The moon was\
  \ out, just past half full and waxing. My eyes quickly adjusted to the little light.\
  \ Edme's resources grew leaner with each passing season, and more than one citizen\
  \ crept out at night to rifle through abandoned houses. My perch allowed me to watch\
  \ for such activity, and my experience helped me separate desperate looters from\
  \ dedicated traitors.</p> \n   <p>I stayed at the window until I started shivering.\
  \ I stretched, and was ready to return to my cot when movement in the street below\
  \ caught my eye.</p> \n   <p>I stopped in mid-stretch, holding myself still. A human\
  \ figure crouched in the alley across the street, wrapped in a dark cloak and hood.\
  \ I couldn't see the figure's face, but his height and manner of dress suggested\
  \ it was a man. I watched, waiting to see what business the fellow had so late.\
  \ He pressed against the wall of the alley, motionless save for small movements\
  \ of his head as he surveyed the street. The man's focus was not on the street itself,\
  \ but only the building opposite him. The building in whose attic I stood, watching\
  \ him in return.</p> \n   <p>He was spying on my master's house.</p> \n   <p>He\
  \ must have seen me, I thought, before recalling how difficult it is to see inside\
  \ an upper-story window from the ground, especially when the person at the window\
  \ stands only head and shoulders above the sill.</p> \n   <p>The watcher looked\
  \ up just as I stepped back. I hesitated, wondering whether he had seen me after\
  \ all, fighting the temptation to step forward again and make sure I had gone unnoticed.\
  \ No, no time for that. I grabbed my cloak from its peg near the door and hurried\
  \ down the stairs.</p> \n   <p>My sleeping clothes are almost identical to my working\
  \ ones: a thin shirt and brown linen trousers. My cloak, though, is dark blue-gray,\
  \ purposefully dyed to help me blend into the night. I threw the cloak over my shoulders\
  \ and pulled it tight in front. I don't wear shoes. I let myself out the back door\
  \ not more than two minutes after I had first spotted the watcher.</p> \n   <p>Halfling\
  \ senses are sharper than human ones. We can't see any better in the dark, but we're\
  \ attuned to details. Especially here in Galt, where we live so close to death,\
  \ halflings must remain alert. </p> \n   <p>I crept along the side of the manor\
  \ until the mouth of the alley opposite me came into view. It stood empty. I could\
  \ hear footsteps, though, muffled and growing fainter. I dashed across the street,\
  \ my feet almost noiseless against the cobblestones.</p> \n   <p>I had to work to\
  \ catch up. Even at top speed I moved slower than humans did. My biggest advantage\
  \ was that the watcher didn't seem to know the city well, while I could navigate\
  \ the streets with my eyes closed. The moon vanished behind clouds twice, and the\
  \ tall buildings around me cut off much of the light. Several times I had to slow\
  \ down lest I trip in the dark or splash through a puddle. My heart beat a little\
  \ faster every time I had to slow. The watcher's footsteps grew fainter. If I didn't\
  \ make up the distance quickly, I was going to lose him.</p> \n   <p>The watcher's\
  \ footsteps doubled back. The remains of an old lecture hall loomed before me. It\
  \ had burned down at the start of the revolution. Sooty timbers leaned drunkenly\
  \ toward each other. Puddles of rainwater glimmered between piles of broken glass\
  \ and charred rubble. I held my breath and listened. The scent of old fire stung\
  \ my nose. The watcher was south of me, circling around the building. I tucked the\
  \ hem of my cloak into my waistband and climbed into the ruins.</p> \n   <p>I scrambled\
  \ up one of the leaning timbers. The wood, soaked with countless rains, was rotten\
  \ and soft as a carpet. The timber collided with one of its fellows at a crazy angle.\
  \ I leaped from one to the other. My feet slid on the sodden wood, and I windmilled\
  \ my arms to keep balance. When I'd righted myself I paused, listening. The watcher\
  \ was still moving.</p> \n   <p>The timber shifted a little as I ran down its length.\
  \ A mess of fallen boards crossed the center of the room. I clung to the timber\
  \ and slid over the edge. Carefully I dropped down onto the boards. Mud and broken\
  \ glass lay thick around them. I hastened across, my breathing coming quick and\
  \ ragged as I picked each careful step. </p> \n   <p>One of the boards slid out\
  \ from under me. I hopped to another, hoping it would hold. The planks clattered.\
  \ I froze and listened.</p> \n   <p>The watcher stopped. I bent my knees and huddled\
  \ as close as I could to the ground, envisioning the fastest way out of the building\
  \ and back home.</p> \n   <p>Then the watcher started up again. I gave him as much\
  \ lead as I dared before continuing across the ruin. I reached the other side just\
  \ as he approached. I breathed a little more easily. Now I could keep up with him\
  \ for certain. I concealed myself behind a pile of rubbish and waited for him to\
  \ pass.</p> \n   <p>At the same time, I heard more footsteps from the other end\
  \ of the street. Quiet boots, low voices, a sharp laugh. Looters. Most criminals\
  \ in Edme were driven by desperation, but lately more sordid individuals had come\
  \ to the city. They were violent men who followed rumors of abandoned treasure-vaults.\
  \ I hesitated in the shadows. Before I could decide what to do next, the watcher\
  \ darted straight for my hiding place.</p> \n   <p>As I had guessed, he was a human\
  \ man. The moonlight robbed his form of color, but it seemed his skin was a light\
  \ brown shade similar to my own, and his hair and eyes were both dark. He pressed\
  \ against the wall and slid down to conceal himself behind the refuse pile I was\
  \ using. I held my breath and, for a wild moment, thought he might not notice me.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Then the watcher looked down and saw me crouched next to him. His eyes\
  \ widened. </p> \n   <p>The sounds of the looters grew louder. I put my finger to\
  \ my lips and shook my head.</p> \n   <p>The watcher nodded and kept silent. The\
  \ looters came abreast of us, three of them dressed in dark clothes with weapons\
  \ held openly in hand. They carried empty packs strapped to their backs, waiting\
  \ no doubt to be filled with artifacts of pre-Revolution Galt. The watcher held\
  \ still next to me, so tense I could almost hear his muscles hum. After a dreadful\
  \ minute, the looters passed by into the darkness.</p> \n   <p>The watcher let out\
  \ his breath in a sigh and straightened. He was short for a human, less than twice\
  \ my height. \"I appreciate your silence,\" he whispered.</p> \n   <p>\"I've no\
  \ wish to run afoul of that type,\" I replied. \"You take a risk being out so late.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"As do you.\" He looked me over. \"You've been following me, haven't\
  \ you?\"</p> \n   <p>I clenched my hands. The man had good ears to have heard me,\
  \ and I had lost any element of surprise. I readied myself to run, but risked a\
  \ direct question first. \"You were watching the Mirford estate. I want to know\
  \ why.\"</p> \n   <p>The watcher smiled. He crouched down to put himself at eye\
  \ level with me.</p> \n   <p>\"I was looking for you.\"</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next\
