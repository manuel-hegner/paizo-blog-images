  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, May 23, 2012</p> \n   <p><i>In <a href=\"/products/btpy8rkv\"\
  >City of the Fallen Sky</a>, a young alchemist named Alaeron flees an apprenticeship\
  \ with the dark scholars of Numeria's Technic League, only to find himself in trouble\
  \ once more as a chance encounter sends him and several reluctant companions into\
  \ the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse. Tracked by a high-tech assassin, and armed\
  \ only with his inquisitive nature—and a few mysterious artifacts stolen from the\
  \ Technic League—Alaeron must find the ruins of a legendary flying city, or face\
  \ the wrath of a cruel crime lord...</i></p> \n   <h2>Chapter Five</h2> \n   <h3>A\
  \ Vote of No Confidence</h3> \n   <p>It's necessary if I'm to do the best possible\
  \ work for you,\" Alaeron said, speaking quickly enough, he hoped, to stave off\
  \ violence. \"I just need to return to my workshop and get some of my supplies.\
  \ An alchemist without his tools is nothing more—as you've so recently pointed out—\
  than a man who stinks of sulfur.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I can have whatever supplies you\
  \ need brought here,\" Vadim said. \"Just make a list and give it to Skiver.\" </p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"No—no, sir, I'm afraid that won't work, I need my formula book at the\
  \ very least. It holds all the recipes for my potions and ...other items ...and\
  \ that's something no alchemist would sell. An alchemist's formulas are highly personal\
  \ and individual, as important to my work as a wizard's spellbooks, and—\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"I can take him,\" Skiver said. \"It would shut him up, at least.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Are you sure you want to be out on the street, given your current situation?\"\
  \ Vadim said.</p> \n   <p>Skiver laughed. \"No one's looking for me yet. I've got\
  \ a few days before I need to worry about showing my face. I can babysit the scholar\
  \ a bit.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Fine, fine,\" Vadim said, \"I've spent too much time on\
  \ this already, just deal with it.\" He pressed the heels of his hands against his\
  \ temples, and Alaeron felt a brief and ultimately ridiculous stab of sympathy—\
  the old man looked tired now, and clearly had larger problems than this on his mind.\
  \ \"A speculative venture to the ruins of Kho!\" Vadim boomed. \"What can I be thinking?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"It's a gamble, right enough,\" Skiver said. \"Most likely it'll come\
  \ to nothing. But it could pay off big, and the buy-in's right: all it costs you\
  \ is leaving three shallow graves empty for a while longer. Seems like a decent\
  \ gamble. And I've always wanted to see the world.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'm hardly likely\
  \ to take gambling advice from you, old friend,\" Vadim said, clapping Skiver on\
  \ the shoulder. \"Given your current circumstances. Eh?\"</p> \n   <p>Skiver's smile\
  \ slipped, just slightly, and his eyes narrowed, but only for a moment. \"I can\
  \ slit their throats and dump them by the docks if you're having second thoughts,\
  \ boss,\" he said.</p> \n   <p>\"No, no, by all means, set off on your journey,\
  \ have your adventure. Just bring me back a souvenir. Say, a chest full of treasures.\"\
  \ He jerked his thumb at Alaeron and Jaya. \"Or else their heads in a sack.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"The perfect gift for the man who has everything,\" Skiver said, grin\
  \ at full breadth again. </p> \n   <p>\"Come on, Jaya,\" Vadim said. \"One of my\
  \ men will show you your brother.\" She cast a worried glance at Alaeron, and an\
  \ even more worried one at Skiver, and then followed Vadim out of the room.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>When they were gone, Skiver turned his attention to Alaeron. \"All right,\
  \ scholar. Let's go.\" He led the way out of the storeroom, through a number of\
  \ narrow hallways paneled in dark wood. Alaeron considered trying to hit his guide\
  \ over the head and run away. After all, <i>he</i> didn't have a brother locked\
  \ up in a cage—there was nothing holding him here but a gentleman's agreement, and\
  \ Vadim had already proven he was no gentleman. But the fact was, he had to go back\
  \ to his workshop before he could flee more permanently, and Vadim knew where that\
  \ workshop was, so giving Skiver the slip now wouldn't help him much: there might\
  \ very well be armed men waiting for him when he arrived home. But once he was at\
  \ his lab, in possession of his tools, then the equation would change. It should\
  \ be trivial to incapacitate Skiver and make a run for it.</p> \n   <p>Certainly,\
  \ the possibility of seeing the ruins of Kho was tantalizing, and the chance to\
  \ spend more time with Jaya had its own temptations. She was treacherous and untrustworthy,\
  \ certainly, but there was much about her Alaeron couldn't begin to understand ...and\
  \ he loved nothing so much as the chance to strip a mystery bare. So to speak. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>But he had to be practical. Such an expedition would be treacherous, necessitating\
  \ a voyage across the Inner Sea, a trek across the burning sands of Osirion, and\
  \ then on into the mountains, and once they got there, they were likely to be slaughtered\
  \ by monsters in the high passes, or murdered by Jaya's savage relatives—assuming\
  \ they even existed. If their team beat the odds and actually found the ruins of\
  \ Kho, who knew what sort of horrors would lurk inside? All that knowledge...but,\
  \ no, Alaeron had already <i>had</i> his adventure, and returned with his hard-won\
  \ prizes. He should settle down for a quiet chance at study. He just had to escape\
  \ from his current predicament first.</p> \n   <p>Skiver unlocked a heavy wooden\
  \ door that led outside to a stable smelling of fresh hay and old manure. Judging\
  \ by the sky, it was late afternoon. Alaeron felt adrift in both time and space.\
  \ </p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO9508-Skiver.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO9508-Skiver_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n    <br> \"Skiver is strangely amiable for a cutthroat.\"\n   </div> \n \
  \  <p>\"Thinking of trying to escape?\" Skiver said conversationally. \"Can't say\
  \ I blame you. There's never been a fish on a hook that didn't do its damndest to\
  \ wriggle free. But even if you did get away from me—which you won't—Vadim's got\
  \ connections everywhere. He's not a man you want to cross, at least not unless\
  \ you're in a position to make sure he can't cross you <i>back</i>.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I will take your words under advisement.\" Alaeron put all the snobbery and superiority\
  \ at his disposal into his tone. </p> \n   <p>\"No, you won't,\" Skiver said, almost\
  \ mournfully. \"But that's all right. No one ever does.\" They passed through another\
  \ gate—locked, but unguarded—and into a cobbled side street, and Alaeron's mental\
  \ map oriented itself: they were in the old part of the city, where some of the\
  \ great houses of the deposed aristocracy had become private residences for wealthy\
  \ merchants, or else been chopped up into dozens of apartments for poorer sorts.\
  \ His workshop was off to the east, not an impossible distance, but a longish walk.\
  \ \"I don't suppose Vadim has a carriage we could use,\" he said. \"Only I'm a bit\
  \ sore from being beaten over the head and tied to a chair.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Good\
  \ for you to walk and work the kinks out, then,\" Skiver said cheerfully, strolling\
  \ along the gently curving street past the gates of once-stately residences. \"\
  You'd best get used to it, anyway. I'd bet we're going places sensible animals like\
  \ horses won't go near, so we'll be doing a lot of walking. Your soft little feet\
  \ will have to get toughened up.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I think you misunderstand me, sir,\"\
  \ Alaeron said with icy dignity. \"Perhaps Vadim didn't tell you, but I've traveled\
  \ to Numeria in the far north, and talked my way into the Technic League, and seen\
  \ the terrible secrets of the Silver Mount—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Oh, Vadim mentioned,\"\
  \ Skiver interrupted. \"I know what you <i>say</i> you did. But people say all sorts\
  \ of things. I know a man says he went to Absalom and saw that great cathedral there\
  \ and someone bet he wouldn't go inside. Now that man, he likes a bit of a gamble,\
  \ so he couldn't resist. He says he made his way to the center of the cathedral\
  \ and looked upon the Starstone with his own eyes, that he could have reached out\
  \ and touched it—but then he decided he didn't <i>want</i> to be a god after all,\
  \ sounded too much like hard work, so he walked on out again, collected his winnings,\
  \ and lost it all betting on a pit fight the next day.\" He gave Alaeron a sly sidelong\
  \ look. \"He <i>says</i> all that. Don't mean it happened. My old mother had a saying\
  \ for people like him, and for anybody who puts on airs and claims more than they\
  \ have a right to—‘He's all pointy hat and no magic,' she'd say.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  If you're implying—\" Alaeron began.</p> \n   <p>\"Can't say as I blame you. Your\
  \ back was up against it back there, and no mistake. I'd have said just about anything\
  \ to keep my thumbs. You just did what you had to do.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Ah,\" Alaeron\
  \ said, hope stirring. \"Then would you mind if I, hmm, slipped away? I promise\
  \ I'd never come within a day's travel of the city—\"</p> \n   <p>Skiver spat on\
  \ the cobbles. \"I said I understood, scholar. I didn't say it was worth my life\
  \ to get you out of the trouble you got yourself into. No, you'll come along with\
  \ us. If you're really an alchemist maybe you can at least pour me the occasional\
  \ drink. Let's get to this laboratory of yours.\"</p> \n   <p>They continued walking\
  \ in silence. Skiver never asked the way to the laboratory, but he kept taking all\
  \ the right turnings, which meant Vadim and his people were entirely too familiar\
  \ with the details of Alaeron's life. As they walked, Alaeron looked around the\
  \ city, trying to memorize every brick and board of its buildings, every twist of\
  \ its streets, every drifting scent in the air. There was a good chance he'd never\
  \ see Almas again, and that thought left a hollowness in his chest as echoing as\
  \ the great chamber he'd discovered in the depths of the Silver Mount. </p> \n \
  \  <p>\"Here we are,\" Skiver said, rapping on the door to Alaeron's workshop. \"\
  Guess you'd better open it up.\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron opened the lock, but didn't\
  \ perform the necessary steps to deactivate the gas trap. It wouldn't kill Skiver,\
  \ but it would knock him out, and give Alaeron time to gather his things and make\
  \ his escape before the alarm was raised. \"After you,\" he said, stepping back.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Skiver snorted and drew his long, thin knife. \"I don't think so, scholar.\
  \ Never go through an unknown door first if you can help it. After you.\" He gestured\
  \ with his knife.</p> \n   <p>Alaeron cleared his throat. \"Of course. Just, ah,\
  \ I think I forgot to ...\" He hurriedly twisted the lock again, deactivating the\
  \ trap, while Skiver chuckled behind him. </p> \n   <p>\"What was it?\" the man\
  \ asked. \"Crossbow tied to a string?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Of course not. Nothing <i>lethal</i>.\
  \ I don't want dead men in my doorway. Just a trap to release a chemical composition\
  \ of my own devising.\"</p> \n   <p>Skiver shrugged. \"Nice try, anyway. But you\
  \ can still go in first.\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron opened the door and ducked inside.\
  \ Skiver followed a moment later, eyes taking in every corner of the room, knife\
  \ in his hand. He slammed the door all the way open, hard, presumably to break the\
  \ nose of anyone hiding behind it. Satisfied there was no immediate danger, he tucked\
  \ his knife away, hooked a stool with his foot, dragged it over to one of the dirty\
  \ windows, and sat down. He licked his thumb and cleared away a little patch of\
  \ grime on the glass so he could see outside, and alternated between watching Alaeron\
  \ and watching the street. </p> \n   <p>The alchemist's travel pack was already\
  \ prepared. It was just a matter of tucking in the formula books he'd been using\
  \ most recently, checking the multitude of pockets in his coat to make sure all\
  \ the appropriate items were in their proper places—it wouldn't do to reach for\
  \ a flash-bomb and get a stink-bomb instead—and making sure he hadn't left any overly\
  \ volatile chemicals sitting too close to their reagents. He might never come back\
  \ here again, but that didn't mean he wanted his father's laboratory to explode.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>There was only one little problem. He needed to get his relics from\
  \ the Silver Mount. And he didn't especially want Skiver to know he had them. He\
  \ was well armed with weapons now—better armed than Skiver could imagine, Alaeron\
  \ was sure—but they didn't do him much good in such enclosed quarters. The laboratory\
  \ was essentially one large room, and tossing a bomb here would hurt him as much\
  \ as it would Skiver. Damn it, if only the man had walked into the gas trap—</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Who's this?\" Skiver said. \"There's a big man in the street, he's walked\
  \ past three times now. You have an appointment today? Somebody come to buy one\
  \ of your love potions?\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron closed his eyes. The Technic League\
  \ enforcer, Kormak. Almost certainly. \"I, ah—\"</p> \n   <p>\"He's coming to the\
  \ door,\" Skiver said, stepping back from his stool. \"You got that trap you laid\
  \ for me all ready to go?\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron swore and hurried to the door, attaching\
  \ delicate wires to carefully placed hooks on the door frame, glancing up at the\
  \ apparatus bolted to a roof beam. \"Get away from the door,\" Alaeron whispered.\
  \ \"The gas is fairly dense, almost a mist, so it shouldn't drift too far, but we\
  \ don't want to be close to it.\" Alaeron scurried to the far corner. Skiver gave\
  \ him a thoughtful look, then went to the other corner, where Alaeron had hung a\
  \ curtain to separate his sleeping pallet from the workshop proper. Skiver ducked\
  \ behind the curtain and out of sight.</p> \n   <p>Alaeron did a rapid calculation\
  \ of risk. Skiver was probably watching the door and not Alaeron, who was partially\
  \ screened from view by a battered wooden cupboard full of reagents anyway. The\
  \ timing hardly seemed ideal, but when would he have another unobserved moment?\
  \ Alaeron knelt and lifted up a floorboard near the wall. His father had kept an\
  \ emergency sack of coin in the little space underneath, once upon a time, but Alaeron\
  \ used it for more precious things. The hole appeared to be empty, but that was\
  \ a minor illusion purchased from a wizard, so he reached in anyway and drew out\
  \ a drawstring bag, no bigger than a wineskin, that clinked gently when it moved.\
  \ Alaeron took the cloth-wrapped items from inside the bag and secreted them in\
  \ various pockets of his traveling coat before replacing the board. </p> \n   <p>The\
  \ door rattled ominously a few times while Alaeron was retrieving his stolen relics,\
  \ and then there was a horrible squeal as Kormak broke in, prying the door away\
  \ from the frame. The door popped open and a shadow loomed, filling the entryway.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>The canister attached to the roof beam hissed as one of the pulled\
  \ wires activated it, spraying a dense greenish mist toward the intruder's face.\
  \ Kormak reached up with one huge hand and wiped at his cheek, grunted, and then\
  \ fell forward as suddenly and solidly as a chopped-down tree. Alaeron smiled—he'd\
  \ never actually seen the trap work before, and it was gratifying to know it behaved\
  \ as designed. He waited a moment for the mist to dissipate, then stepped toward\
  \ the Kellid. The gas should render Kormak unconscious for a few hours, at least,\
  \ which was ample time to go through that clanking coat of his and see what kind\
  \ of devices the Technic League had armed him with. Why, with luck, Alaeron could\
  \ find items valuable enough to buy himself out of this problem with Ralen Vadim—\
  or even to overwhelm the old adventurer by force, rescue Jaya, and earn her no doubt\
  \ plentiful gratitude.</p> \n   <p>He knelt, reached out for Kormak's coat—</p>\
  \ \n   <p>And the Kellid lifted his head, gave Alaeron a smirk full of contempt,\
  \ and seized the alchemist by the throat. As Alaeron choked and scrabbled hopelessly\
  \ at the man's fingers—how could mere flesh grip tight as iron?—he noticed flashes\
  \ of silver, like tiny metal corks, in each of Kormak's nostrils. The Technic League\
  \ used such filters to traverse some of the more poisonous rooms in the Silver Mount—\
  they allowed the wearer to breathe, more or less, while preventing more noxious\
  \ substances from entering the body. </p> \n   <p>\"Greetings, runaway,\" Kormak\
  \ said, and despite sounding nasal and strange from the nose plugs, there was no\
  \ mistaking the satisfaction in his voice.</p> \n   <p><b><a href=\"/products/btpy8rkv\"\
