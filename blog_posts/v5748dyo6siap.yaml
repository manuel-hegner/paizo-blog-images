  ><em>Starfinder Ports of Call</em></a> is our upcoming 194-page hardcover book release\
  \ for the Starfinder RPG that brings new locales and rules to your games. This jam-packed\
  \ book provides an overview of the state of the Starfinder galaxy in the aftermath\
  \ of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinder/driftcrisis\">Drift Crisis event</a>,\
  \ as well as detailing 10 major ports that can host a variety of adventures or just\
  \ act as a nice resting spot for your characters. Along with all this, there’s rules\
  \ for cargo running, unique contacts to meet, interesting side jobs to take part\
  \ in, new species to play as, extra rules for expanded downtime, and new starship\
  \ options.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5b5f3175-54e9-476e-8ed7-658e40d09430/PZO7121_Chapter3_Opener.jpg\"\

  font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>One of the most exciting\
  \ elements of this book is the detail it provides on the galaxy (known as Desna’\
  s Path), along with all manner of unique interstellar phenomena. Learn about the\
  \ massive black hole at the galaxy’s heart known as Old Rovagug or scratch the surface\
  \ of the magical event dubbed Pharasma’s Coil. With the Drift Crisis settling down,\
  \ there’s also the new Drift lanes now crisscrossing different regions of space,\
  \ connecting worlds previously separated by weeks-long Drift voyages with direct\
  \ trips cut down to a single week. These lanes provide all manner of new adventuring\
  \ opportunities, but also have some drastic changes to our setting—what could possibly\
  \ go wrong with the warlike Veskarium having four Drift lanes crossing through their\
  \ system? Nothing. Nothing could go wrong.*</p> \n     <p>Diving into the actual\
  \ ports portion of the book, we’ve talked about the planetary theme park of Golarion\
  \ World in past announcements and so we’ll leave that for folks to discover once\
  \ the book is released. Today, let’s take a peek at two of the other ports you’\
  ll get to explore in this book.</p> \n     <p>Though the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eai?Starfinder-Scoured-Stars-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Scoured Stars Adventure Path</a> has had its release date pushed back a bit**,\
  \ fear not! Ports of Call provides some fun tie-ins for those who’ve followed the\
  \ Starfinder Society Organized Play Campaign, with some amazing follow-up in the\
  \ form of the Izadamar port. Izadamar is a settlement within the Scoured Stars that\
  \ began the process of repopulating and rebuilding following the events of that\
  \ story. If you’ve already experienced the Scoured Stars, this is an excellent opportunity\
  \ to see what’s happened since the Starfinder Society triumphed, and what new threats\
  \ have emerged. Along with all this content, the book also presents playable species\
  \ rules for the gaseous thyrs of the Kreiholm Freehold, who appeared in the Scoured\
  \ Stars storyline and have a strong presence in Izadamar.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <p>Going from the far reaches of the Vast back to something\
  \ closer to “home” (or at least what we consider our setting’s home), the port of\
  \ Drifter’s End is something people may have heard of before. Not quite a settlement\
  \ of its own, Drifter’s End is actually one of the many neighborhoods on the immense\
  \ Absalom Station that acts as the heart of the Starfinder setting—praise to the\
  \ Starstone and its guaranteed 1d6 days in the Drift to get travel to it!</p> \n\
  \     <p>Drifter’s End is a melting pot of different alien ambassadors and visitors\
  \ to the immense station. It’s a doorway where many visitors get their first taste\
  \ of the diversity of the Pact Worlds by traveling through food stalls or carousing\
  \ to gather information. Experienced Starfinders know that Drifter’s End is home\
  \ to the campus of the Lorespire Complex that acts as the Starfinder Society’s headquarters\
  \ in the cosmos. For non-Starfinders, the Society can still help you out by offering\
  \ reasonably priced lodgings to counteract the constantly booked hotels within the\
  \ wider neighborhood. These “Starfinder Stay” BNB-like accommodations are the homes\
  \ of Starfinders who find themselves adventuring more than they stay on the station.\
  \ Who wouldn’t want to sleep in a home filled with mysterious Starfinder-obtained\
  \ relics. Nothing could go wrong. Nothing!*</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ content and a whole lot more as we get closer to the release of <em>Starfinder\
  \ Ports of Call</em>.</p> \n     <p>Before I go, I’d like to take a moment to thank\
  \ the incredibly talented group of writers who worked on this book, including: Kate\
  \ Baker, Brian Bauman, Jessica Catalan, John Compton, John Curtin, John Feil, Sen\
  \ H.H.S., Joan Hong, Jenny Jarzabski, Jason Keeley, Dennis Muldoon, Hilary Moon\
  \ Murphy, Chesley Oxendine, Emily Parks, Joe Pasini, Jessica Redekop, Paul Scofield,\
  \ Shay Snow, Kendra Leigh Speedling, Alex Speidel, Jason Tondro, Andrew White, Shan\
  \ Wolf, and Isis Wozniakowska.</p> \n     <p>On the Paizo-side, this book wouldn’\
  t be possible without the hard development work of lead developer John Compton and\
  \ supporting development by Joe Pasini. Finally, a big shout out to our editors\
  \ and editing lead, Ianara Natividad.</p> \n     <p>We hope you find a whole new\
  \ galaxy of adventures in this book and can’t wait to hear all the tales you tell\
  \ at these ports!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
