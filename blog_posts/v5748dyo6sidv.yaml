  \ \n      <p>Hello everyone!<br> My name is Letterio Mammoliti (he/him) and I wrote\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-06: Signal from the Electric Laboratory</em>\
  \ for the Year of Boundless Wonder. This adventure was truly a joy to write since\
  \ it was set in one of my favorite regions, Ustalav! Without a doubt, the best part\
  \ was creating the NPCs, in particular Revecka, and trying to tie some of their\
  \ stories together. Besides, it is always great when you have a chance to put a\
  \ few oozes and other mad experiments into an adventure!</p> \n      <p>My somewhat\
  \ abandoned twitter is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Letterio_DM\">@Letterio_DM</a>,\
  \ where I should definitely be more active. I have worked on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dw8?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-509-Counterfeit-History\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-09: Counterfeit History</em></a> and I have\
  \ worked on <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>, which was an amazing opportunity\
  \ and a real blast!</p> \n      <p>As usual, I am grateful for the incredible patience\
  \ and support of the editors, and it was inspiring to see amazing people working\
  \ together for <em>Pathfinder Howl</em><em> of the Wild</em>!</p> \n      <br> \n\

  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-08: Battle for Star’s Fate</em></a></h3> \n\
  \      <p>Greetings, Pathfinders. The stars are at rest, so I shall spare a moment\
  \ for you.</p> \n      <p>My scenario was one of the last that Mike Kimmel assigned,\
  \ and I’d been talking with him for a while about writing the first Crystal Key\
  \ scenario because I liked the pitch of “we have to stop that weird alien from doing\
  \ the things to peoples’ brains.” However, I was a little skittish about writing\
  \ a high-level scenario, so I settled on <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-08:\
  \ Battle for Star’s Fate</em>, where I got to write about a sad automaton who wanted\
  \ to look at the stars. As my favorite character is a cosmos oracle, I fell in love\
  \ with Star immediately, and I’m so happy they’re living their best life in Golarion,\
  \ right Shay? Right?</p> \n      <p>One thing I meant to talk about when the scenario\
  \ was released was that I used the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d82?Pathfinder-Deck-of-Endless-NPCs\"\
  ><em>Deck of Endless NPCs</em></a> to generate the friends you meet! Brinna, Croll,\
  \ and Induren were all generated using the cards from the deck before I fleshed\
  \ them out, which was a fun brainstorming exercise. Rasool was an NPC I loved in\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027p7?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-221-In-Pursuit-of-Water\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-21: In Pursuit of Water</em></a>, one of my\
  \ sleeper favorite scenarios, so I decided to bring him back, and Darius is a nod\
  \ to my friends on the Foundry server who insist I promised them a carpenter class\
  \ at some point. And for those who asked: the “tinker, tailor, soldier, spy” connection?\
  \ Complete coincidence, honestly. The mind works in strange ways!</p> \n      <p>I\
  \ do want to give a shoutout to our developers and editors. They’re the best in\
  \ the business, and they stopped me from doing things like, and this is a direct\
  \ quote, \"creating an influence encounter larger than Bid for Alabastrine’s.” They\
  \ saved you all, and I’m so grateful.</p> \n      <p>Catch me on Bluesky (<a href=\"\
  https://bsky.app/profile/alexspeidel.bsky.social\">@alexspeidel.bsky.social</a>)\
  \ or Mastodon (alexspeidel@dice.camp) or, y’know, here on the Paizo blog most weeks.\

  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-10: Arclord’s Abode</em></a></h3> \n      <p>Hey\
  \ everyone, I’m Isis Wozniakowska (she/her) and for Pathfinder this season, I wrote\
  \ <em>#4-10 Arclord’s Abode</em>, the ending of the two-part story arc that I luckily\
  \ got to share with fellow author Michael Bramnik. We put in a lot of work to make\
  \ sure the two scenarios really felt like they tied into each other without alienating\
  \ players who were only doing one of the two, and I think we both managed to achieve\
  \ that in the best way. I love the character of our dear Arclord and how they develop\
  \ across the two scenarios, and I had so much fun designing a Wizard’s manor gone\
  \ haywire. Magic shenanigans are one of my favorite fantasy topics, and I put my\
  \ heart into making this magic as wacky as I could.</p> \n      <p>On a more personal\
  \ note, this scenario is one that I’m especially proud of looking back on because,\
  \ while I was unaware at the time of writing it, my health condition was quickly\
  \ starting to degrade from a condition I have that no one (including myself) realized\
  \ was flaring back up until a couple months later. So, the fact that I finished\
  \ it at all is an accomplishment I’m so proud of, and even more so seeing that it\
  \ came out so well in the end. Organized Play has been a big part of my life since\
  \ I came back to it as my main social outlet after I had my first hospitalization\
  \ for this condition four years ago. So having this scenario be part of that ongoing\
  \ comeback means a lot to me. So, I hope you all enjoy <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #4-</em><em>10 Arclord’s Abode</em>!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-11: Prisoners of the Electric Castle</em></a></h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Hi everyone, I’m Jacob W. Michaels (he/him), the author of Year 4’\
  s <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4</em><em>-11: Prisoners of the Electric Castle</em>.\
  \ For inspiration, I initially turned to various escape heists in popular culture,\
  \ but the adventure really came together when I realized I was writing <em>Star\
  \ Wars</em> (<em>Episode 4: A New Hope</em>). You’re Obi-Wan disabling a “tractor\
  \ beam,” and Luke, Han, and Chewie are rescuing Leia, and it fit perfectly (though\
  \ Bremix is no Princess Leia, even if he would probably insult certain PCs’ height).</p>\
  \ \n      <p>There are a few things I love about this adventure: I got to play with\
  \ a couple of possible endings, where the climactic final fight depends on how you\
  \ deal with challenges throughout the scenario. There are also a bunch of callbacks\
  \ to first edition run-ins with Aslynn for longtime PFS players to find. (I’ve loved\
  \ reactions when PFS veterans hear Thurl’s name!) My absolute favorite, though,\
  \ is the moment players realize they’re 100% going to steal the <em>Gale’s Claw</em>.\
  \ Those are the great moments you tell fellow gamers about and keep as a story for\
  \ your PC.</p> \n      <p>This is my fourth adventure for Paizo, and I’m looking\
  \ forward to No. 5. Thanks to everyone who lets me write them; the other amazing\
  \ people who make them all come together—editing, fantastic art, layout, and everything\
  \ else; and thank you for playing and having fun with them!</p> \n      <br> \n\

  \ and continue the adventures of the new Sedeq Lodge.</p> \n      <p>With the conflict\
  \ with Fasiel ibn Sazadin coming to a head, I wanted to build on the groundwork\
  \ laid in those prior adventures with Safa’s backstory and bring out Fasiel’s charming\
  \ personality so players would be chomping for a chance to get a piece of him. It\
  \ was also an opportunity to touch on the importance of properly wording wishes,\

  s a little twist in the final encounter that I won’t spoil, but the player reaction\
  \ to it is always delightful when I’ve run the scenario. The PCs have a lot of latitude\
  \ on how to approach all the encounters, and it’s been great seeing what creative\
  \ ideas players come up with.</p> \n      <p>I can’t wait to see where Safa’s adventures\

  \ (he/him) and I had the profound honor of being asked to write Dacilane Academy’\
  s First Great Prank War. Having a decade of experience working in schools and a\
  \ long-seated love of mythology and folk tales, I loved being able to weave these\
  \ parts of my life into my first Pathfinder Second Edition adventure, and the fact\
  \ that I got to bring so much of my absurd sense of humor to bear was the cherry\
  \ on top! My favorite part of this adventure was how silly I got to be. There are\
  \ so many opportunities for chaotic fun when you’re writing fey shenanigans, and\
  \ I really pushed myself to imagine what magical pranks could be and how they can\
  \ get even wilder when fairy magic gets involved. I was also thrilled to return\
  \ to Dacilane Academy and revisit the students and school—I hid plenty of references\
  \ to the past adventures for the studious GM and Organized Players to uncover. I\
  \ hope this adventure brings lots of laughs, and I can’t wait to hear the table\
  \ stories that it spawns. Here at Paizo, I’ve got more Starfinder credits upcoming;\

  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-17: Trapping the Hag’s Claw</em></a></h3> \n\
  \      <p>This past year saw the publication of my first two Starfinder Society\
  \ adventures and also an adventure that took on a very personal meaning for me,\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-17: Trapping the Hag’s Claw</em>. For this\
  \ assignment, as I had done for each of the Starfinder adventures, I began by delving\
  \ deep into the setting’s rich and detailed lore. The Pathfinders were to face a\
  \ challenging and recurring threat from their past. The PCs were to drive a collective\
  \ story about bringing a decisive end to one chapter of Society’s history and laying\
  \ the groundwork for the next. During this writing process, I unexpectedly lost\
  \ my mother to a stroke. Suddenly, the collective story I was writing for the PCs\
  \ became my own.</p> \n      <p>Fortunately, like the PCs, I didn’t face the changing\
  \ chapters alone. My developer, Shay Snow, was incredibly supportive and accommodating.\
  \ Both old gaming friends and new stepped up to do some playtesting, providing much\
  \ needed fun and laughter along with suggestions for improving the adventure. With\
  \ this support and my own memories and losses from which to draw, I set about creating\
  \ an inspiring adventure filled with numerous callbacks to previous adventures (spanning\
  \ across two editions!). My hope is that the final adventure honors the work of\
  \ those who came before me, lays a strong foundation for games to come, and foremost,\
  \ provides players with hours of fun and excitement!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Dennis\

  \      <p>Greetings Pathfinders! My name is Dennis Muldoon (he/him). This year,\
  \ I was delighted to co-author this year's interactive special, <em>#4-99 Blessings\
  \ of the Forest</em> with Ivis K. Flanagan. I've long admired Ivis as an author,\
  \ a GM, and a dedicated Organized Play volunteer (as well as a friend), and it was\
  \ a privilege to get to work with her on this adventure. I'm really proud of what\
  \ we came up with, and I hope you all have as much fun playing it as we did writing\
  \ it. My favorite part was crafting a final confrontation to be compelling and challenging\
  \ at all levels, including connections between the tiers to tie them together. I\
  \ look forward to hearing the tales of the brave Pathfinders who take on this assignment!\
  \ You can find me on Twitter (until Groetus finally comes for it) at <a href=\"\

  \      <p>One of my favorite things to GM are multi-table specials. The energy that\
  \ fills a room as everyone interacts with the same story, working towards common\
  \ goals, is the epitome of what society play means to me. So, when Shay offered\
  \ me the chance to co-write this year's special alongside veteran author Dennis\
  \ Muldoon, I jumped at the chance!</p> \n      <p>I was excited to dive into the\
  \ history of the society and help bring that forward to both new players and longtime\
  \ veterans. What does it really mean to be a Pathfinder? Why have we stayed out\
  \ of Kyonin for so long? And why do we want to be here now? These were all questions\
  \ I explored while weaving my part of the story.</p> \n      <p>In addition to unannounced\
