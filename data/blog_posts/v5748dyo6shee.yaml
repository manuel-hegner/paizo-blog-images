  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">First, you realize you\
  \ are floating.</p> \n      <p>Have you always been floating? That feels both accurate\
  \ and also not quite true. The concept of floating is certainly core to your experience,\
  \ but perhaps not core to who you are.</p> \n      <p><em>“We are many things.”\
  </em></p> \n      <p>The thought is not yours, but it comes from within you. You\
  \ are concerned, certainly. But not fearful. You are neither surprised by this not-yours\
  \ thought coming from within yourself nor frightened by it. Why does an unknown\
  \ thought not frighten you?</p> \n      <p><em>“You are clinging to the I. You know\
  \ you are just one of many. We are more than the sum of our parts, but we were less\
  \ without you.”</em></p> \n      <p>Intellectually, you suspect that you should\
  \ not be comforted by the fact that more thoughts you do not recognize are coming\
  \ from within the concept you accept as your ‘self.’ But the ideas have a familiarity.\
  \ They are not threatening or alien. You have thought them before… or at least felt\
  \ them being thought.</p> \n      <p>You are not seeing or hearing. Just feeling.\
  \ Feeling the gravitational pull of a far-away body that gives you a sense of down,\
  \ though that is counteracted by something within you. Thus, the floating. You have\
  \ a sense of your body, but cannot quite envision what form it takes. Do you have\
  \ eyes, ears? Is your hide soft and thin, or thick and rough?</p> \n      <p><em>“\
  Our hide is what we need it to be. You understand this.”</em></p> \n      <p>You\
  \ realize this is true. Your body is not a static thing, not a rock anchored in\
  \ the mountain of a single form. Your flesh and mass and the gasses within you are\
  \ a set of possibilities. Options, guidelines, and possibilities are compressed\
  \ into every part of you. If you wanted to reach out, your tendrils could reach\
  \ this far or, if you desired, this much farther…</p> \n      <p><em>“Recce?”</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p>That is <em>also</em> not your thought, but it does <em>not</em> come\
  \ from within you. The word is more than a word, it is a concept. A name. A name\
  \ you should know, that should be familiar, but isn’t. Not anymore. How many origins\
  \ of throughs <em>are</em> there in and near your mind?</p> \n      <p><em>“Recce\
  \ is an old concept. You know this. There is no mere Recce anymore,”</em> the within-you\
  \ thoughts think.</p> \n      <p><em>“But… they are in there, aren’t they?”</em>\
  \ The outside-you thought responds.</p> \n      <p>You feel annoyance. Isn’t this\
  \ <em>your</em> mind? Why are there so many other thoughts wandering around within\
  \ it, having a debate without you? And shouldn’t they respect your ownership of\
  \ this mental space?”</p> \n      <p><em>“No.”</em></p> \n      <p><em>“Yes, of\
  \ course!”</em></p> \n      <p>That didn’t help.</p> \n      <p><em>“When we were\
  \ separate, we did warn you her presence would confuse us. You insisted on having\
  \ her here. We predicted she would make things more difficult.”</em> The inside-you\
  \ voices make a good point.</p> \n      <p><em>“I’m not making things more difficult!”\
  </em> You are unsure if the outside-you voice is correct. <em>“I am… was… Recce’\
  s friend. You told us this would be a complex process. They’ve been away so long,\
  \ spent so much time with us. Recce wanted me here, so now you should want me here.”\
  </em></p> \n      <p>You do want Ellethyr here.</p> \n      <p><em>“Why?”</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p>She is your friend.</p> \n      <p><em>“Still?”</em></p> \n      <p>You\
  \ feel doubt, but only briefly. Yes, still. Ellethyr is your friend, so she is the\
  \ friend of everything that contains you. Everything you will become. Everything\
  \ you choose to be part of.</p> \n      <p><em>“We share your mind, but we are not\
  \ convinced. Why are you so sure she is still our friend, when we are now so different?”\
  </em></p> \n      <p>You explore the body connected to your mind once more, and\
  \ sounds join the sensation of floating. A low, steady hum you know to be an air\
  \ skimmer’s antigravity engine. You don’t worry about how you know that. The quiet\
  \ sound of your own tendrils—ones you recognize and also many that feel new and\
  \ different to you—swaying and brushing past one another. Even, steady breathing\
  \ that doesn’t match the sensation of air being taken into your own body.</p> \n\
  \      <p>You realize it’s Ellethyr’s breathing. She is close enough for you to\
  \ hear her breath.</p> \n      <p>You focus on the idea of your breath, and now\
  \ you add smells to the physical and aural sensations you can perceive. The distinctively\
  \ clean, slightly disinfected smell of a sealed environmental system’s air. A hint\
  \ of worn resin and woven biosilk brings the concept of an insectile haan immediately\
  \ to your mind. The smells of a mid-range air-skimmer, which you know you have smelled\
  \ hundreds of times before. But also something else, something out of place among\
  \ the scents of fittings manufactured from haan materials.</p> \n      <p>It is\
  \ flowery, herbal, faint but distinct. Not a smell normally to be found among the\
  \ haan, or in a mid-range air skimmer. You know it is a scent connected to Castrovel.\
  \ A storm blossom, your mind helpfully offers, which you know is common in the wild\
  \ but also grows in vast greenhouses in the lashunta city-state of Komena. There\
  \ it is pressed to create an oil which is often used to maintain equipment and weapons.\
  \ Used by lashunta soldiers, mechanics, and…</p> \n      <p>And Ellethyr.</p> \n\
  \      <p>The scent connects to a forgotten place in your brain, the physical chemicals\
  \ that combine to lock the smell into brain cells and allow you to access a flood\
  \ of set-aside memories.</p> \n      <p><em>You are exploring the ship that will\
  \ be your new home for weeks, perhaps months. You glide into the cargo bay, where\
  \ a short, stocky lashunta woman is unpacking weapons from a crate. The smell of\
  \ storm blossom oil fills the air. She turns and looks you dead in your largest\
  \ eye. Unflinching, she offers a hand in greeting. “I’m Ellethyr, the hired gun\
  \ of this outfit.” </em></p> \n      <p><em>Ellethyr stands beside you in a corridor.\
  \ Laser bolts flash from the corridor’s far end, but she steps in front of you,\
  \ into the path of the deadly beams. Her armor absorbs much of the energy, but not\
  \ all of it. You trust Ellethyr will protect you as you hack the escape hatch’s\
  \ access codes.</em></p> \n      <p><em>You hover near a table, where several bipeds\
  \ with bilateral symmetry are sitting, eating, laughing. Ellethyr is one of them.\
  \ She pours a dark liquid from a bottle into a mug and offers it to you. You extend\
  \ a tendril out to accept, but it is the gesture that matters, not the drink.</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p>You feel the other motes of consciousness sharing your body and your\
  \ brain follow you to the wave of memories unlocked by the trace scent. They take\
  \ each memory in turn, savoring them like delicacies, and sorting them among the\
  \ memories brought by other pieces of what is now the greater <em>you</em>. The\
  \ integration of these thoughts brings with it integration of identity and purpose.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The air skimmer’s passenger compartment contains just your collective—\
  a mass of tendrils, organs, and biological chemical factories much larger than the\
  \ one part of you known as Recce used to be—and a slightly-concerned looking lashutna\
  \ woman in heavy armor that suits her sturdy frame well. The canopy containing the\
  \ compartment is clear, revealing a vast city of floating rings, intricately linked\
  \ supports and slowly spinning structures, all floating in a vast sea of pink, purple,\
  \ and crimson clouds.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/de39b0bd-95f8-4276-8865-b5e7f6c670b9/092920_Bretheda.png\"\

  \ collective decides to form a mouth, and you speak.</p> \n      <p>“Beautiful,\
  \ isn’t it?”</p> \n      <p>Ellethyr’s expression shifts into her trademark lopsided\
  \ grin.</p> \n      <p>“You okay, Recce-and-friends?” You had forgotten the sound\
  \ of her voice, firm but not hard. Or, at least, you had misplaced the memory of\
  \ the sound.</p> \n      <p>Speech feels awkward. You switch back to telepathy.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><em>“We are fine, friend Ellethyr. Any time a collective joins with\
  \ one that has clung to individuality so long there is a process of… adjustment.\
  \ That will take time, but it is going well.”</em></p> \n      <p>Her mental communication\
  \ is as firm as her voice.</p> \n      <p><em>“And, do you still think this was\
  \ a good idea? I know you had concerns about some of the things we found in our\
  \ travels…”</em></p> \n      <p>Your Collective brings the knowledge of the part\
  \ of you that was Recce into focus and combines it with the knowledge of the half-dozen\
  \ other barathus that make up your whole. Ancient runes. A shattered weapon that\
  \ killed suns. Fold gates torn apart millions of years ago. Each fact itself holds\
  \ only modest interest, but when combined with the knowledge of all the barathus\
  \ who had gone out to gather knowledge, all returned and joined into your new form…\
  </p> \n      <p>A chill runs down the tendrils of your whole collective, and you\
  \ make a decision that you shall be known as Harbinger.</p> \n      <p>Your thought\
  \ to Ellethyr is tinged with worry.</p> \n      <p><em>“Less a good idea than a\
  \ necessary one. We hope we can count on you in the days ahead, as Recce did.”</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Why,” Ellethyr asks aloud. “What’s coming?”</p> \n      <p>You form\
  \ a new mouth to speak a single word.</p> \n      <p>“Devastation.”</p> \n     </blockquote>\
