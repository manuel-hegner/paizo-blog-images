  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">We just <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/rpgsuperstar/round2\"\
  >unveiled the Top 32's Round 2 entries</a>, making their maps available for everyone\
  \ to check out and vote on! This round is a major change of pace for contestants\
  \ who managed to win public support by creating interesting and intelligible magic\
  \ items, and those who go on to become our Top 16 will have already proven they\
  \ have a wide range of adventure-design skills!</p> \n    <p>While obviously the\
  \ community can vote however it pleases, we do have comments from a great set of\
  \ judges available to give some critique and guidance to contestants and fans alike.\
  \ I especially want to point out that when considering the maps, voters shouldn't\
  \ get too distracted by artistic talent (or lack thereof). A map entry should be\
  \ evocative, clear, and interesting, but we're not looking for publishable, finished\
  \ images. These maps should be ready to be sent to a professional cartographer,\
  \ who can take care of creating appealing and consistent visuals. What a professional\
  \ cartographer can't do is make a great map from a designer's turnover that's 75%\
  \ blank space, or doesn't clearly communicate what it represents, or that details\
  \ a boring place. That's where the designer should shine by creating and communicating\
  \ great ideas.</p> \n    <p>Also, don't get too distracted by details in the prose\
  \ descriptions of the encounters that might happen at these locations. If a map\
  \ is dull, but the description sounds like the contestant had a neat idea for something\
  \ to happen there, it's still a bad map. This isn't an encounter-design challenge\
  \ (that comes later), it's a mapping round. The prose element of this round can\
  \ be used to help give a sense of context, but I hope voters will give preference\
  \ to creativity, clarity, and the ability to describe an interesting location that\
  \ makes GMs want to run an encounter there.</p> \n    <p>So go take a look, see\
  \ what creative cartography our newest Superstars-in-Training have produced, and\
  \ use your votes to help determine which of them are going to earn the chance to\
  \ help shape the Pathfinder RPG in years to come.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align:\
