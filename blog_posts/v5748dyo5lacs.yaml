  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Of all the base classes,\
  \ paladins got some of the largest revisions between the Beta and the final version\
  \ of the rules. Some of their defenses were increased, but the majority of the changes\
  \ revolve around smite evil and the addition of the new ability called mercy.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Before we dig into those changes though, lets take a look at some of the\
  \ other alterations. The first things you might notice are the new auras. These\
  \ were introduced in alpha stages of the playtest and they have survived to the\
  \ final game. The aura of justice allows Seelah to spend two uses of her smite evil\
  \ ability to grant the ability to smite evil to all allies within 10 feet. She must\
  \ use this ability right away and it lasts for 1 minute, but more on that later.\
  \ The second aura, the aura of resolve, makes the paladin immune to charm spells\
  \ and grants a +4 bonus on saves against such spells to all allies within 10 feet.\
  \ Having a paladin in your party gives you a reason to stick together, even if it\
  \ does mean that you are a little bit more vulnerable to area of effect spells.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The next change on the roster involves the paladin's saving throws. You\
  \ might notice that Seelah's Will save is a bit higher than it should be. This is\
  \ due to the fact that paladins now receive the faster save progression for their\
  \ Will saves. </p> \n   <p>The paladin's lay on hands ability has been revamped\
  \ a bit. The paladin can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half\
  \ her paladin level plus her Charisma modifier. With each use, she heals 1d6 points\
  \ of damage per two paladin levels. When she uses this on others, it is a standard\
  \ action, but she can heal herself using this ability as a swift action. Seelah\
  \ can also channel positive energy, as a cleric of her level, but she must use up\
  \ two uses of her lay on hands ability whenever she channels.</p> \n   <p>In addition\
  \ to healing damage, using lay on hands also comes with a number of new benefits\
  \ called mercies. Starting at 3rd level, paladins can select one condition from\
  \ a specific list (at 3rd level, that list is fatigued, shaken, and sickened, but\
  \ the list expands the paladin gains levels). Whenever she uses lay on hands, if\
  \ the target is suffering from that condition, it is instantly removed. As a paladin\
  \ gains levels, she gains additional mercies, which expands her list of conditions\
  \ cured though lay on hands. She can even cure diseases, poisons, and curses in\
  \ this way, although she must make a caster level check to remove them (just as\
  \ with the spells that remove these afflictions). These mercies allow a paladin\
  \ to act as a healer in the party, but without stealing the focus from the cleric,\
  \ who is more focused on larger healing spells and other buffs.</p> \n   <p>Divine\
  \ bond allows a paladin to choose from one of two different effects. She can bond\
  \ with a horse, which acts like an animal companion (using the paladin's level as\
  \ her effective druid level), or she can bond celestial spirits to her weapon. Seelah\
  \ has the weapon bond option, which allows her to add +3 to her weapon up to three\
  \ times per day, with each bonding lasting a number of minutes equal to her paladin\
  \ level. Instead of adding simple bonuses, however, she can instead transform those\
  \ bonuses into special weapon qualities of an equal bonus. For example, Seelah could\
  \ add a +1 enhancement bonus to her <i>+3 defending longsword</i>, making it +4\
  \ and she could also add the <i>holy</i> weapon quality. Instead, she could add\
  \ <i>axiomatic, flaming, flaming burst, keen</i>, or <i>merciful</i>. As she gains\
  \ in level, other options become available, such as <i>speed</i> or <i>brilliant\
  \ energy</i>. The really nice part is that she can tailor these bonuses to the current\
  \ situation, changing them each time she calls a celestial spirit.</p> \n   <p>Of\
  \ all the changes, smite evil was perhaps the most contentious on the message boards.\
  \ Everyone seemed to have an idea of how this iconic ability should work. In the\
  \ end, it was decided that smite evil really should last until your evil foe is\
  \ vanquished, making this ability useful even if you miss with your first attack.\
  \ But we did not stop there, the amount of bonus damage dealt (that is, 1 point\
  \ per paladin level) doubles if the selected foe is an evil outsider, dragon, or\
  \ undead. Smite attacks also ignore any damage reduction the target might have.\
  \ Finally, the paladin is protected from harm gaining a deflection bonus to her\
  \ AC equal to her Charisma modifier against attacks made by the target. Suffice\
  \ to say, you do not want to be on the receiving end of a paladin's smite evil.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>There have been a few other changes to the paladin as well. Whenever she\
  \ uses <i>detect evil</i>, she can focus on one target, to the exclusion of all\
  \ others, to learn if that target is evil in just 1 round. In addition, her spellcasting\
  \ progression is a little bit faster now (matching the ranger's), it is based off\
  \ her Charisma modifier, and her effective caster level is her paladin level –3.\
  \ Most of her spells are pretty straight forward, but there have been some changes\
  \ to protection from evil that are worth noting here. This spell does not grant\
  \ immediate immunity to mental control. Instead, it grants a new save at a +2 bonus\
  \ against the control, but only if the source of the control is an evil creature\
  \ or object (the other protection spells provide similar saves against their alignments).\
  \ The spell does still provide immunity to new mental control or possession from\
  \ evil creatures and objects while it lasts. Its protection from contact by summoned\
  \ creatures now also only applies to evil creatures (instead of evil and neutral).</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Seelah has a number of feats that are worth a closer look. Critical Focus\
  \ gives her a +4 bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls, but the real star is\
  \ Staggering Critical. Any foe that suffers a critical hit from a creature with\
  \ Staggering Critical is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds (meaning that can only take\
  \ a move or a standard action). A Fort save reduces this duration to 1 round (for\
  \ Seelah, the DC is 23). There are a host of critical feats like this in the book,\
  \ but you cannot apply more than one to any critical hit (unless you are a fighter\
  \ with the Critical Mastery feat). These feats are good, but they have relatively\
  \ high prerequisites. Staggering Critical, for example, requires a base attack bonus\
  \ of +13, whereas Stunning Critical requires a base attack bonus of +17. Seelah\
  \ also has Improved Sunder and Greater Sunder, both of which give her a +2 bonus\
  \ on checks to sunder. Greater Sunder also allows Seelah to apply excess damage\
  \ from the sunder directly to the creature holding the item. Each combat maneuver\
  \ has a pair of feats that works like this, granting up to a total of +4 bonus along\
  \ with another benefit.</p> \n   <p>That wraps up our look at Seelah. Next week\
  \ we will get Lem, the iconic bard, in here to play us a tune or two.</p> \n   <p>Jason\
