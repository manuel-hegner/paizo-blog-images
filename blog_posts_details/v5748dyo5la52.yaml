  artist: "exploring one section of Golarion's most important city: Absalom. This\
    \ vast metropolis sits on the isle of Kortos in the great Inner Sea, making it\

    \ critics. Over the next few weeks, we will explore some of this module with a\
    \ bit more depth, but for now, here's one of our favorite art pieces and the teaser\
