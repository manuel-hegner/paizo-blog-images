  \ sighed as she entered the expansive aviary, and immediately cringed at the cacophony\
  \ of bird calls assaulting her pounding head. She—a kobold with mottled emerald\
  \ and jade scales, dressed in the plain grays of a Pathfinder initiate—stood before\
  \ one of the Scrolls’ many gardens of wonder, this one devoted to the production\
  \ of <em>feather tokens</em>. Her task this morning, much to her dismay, was to\
  \ tend to it. On her own. </p> \n      <p>“It’s not even a real garden,” she complained\
  \ to no one in particular. “Why do they even call it that?” She took a seat on a\
  \ decorative boulder, nursing her hangover from the night before, one she had yet\
  \ to even sleep off. It made every merry tweet and call from the countless birds\
  \ grate on her ears like sharp wire. “Oh, we <em>have</em> to sneak out for Longnight,\
  \ they said. It’s <em>completely different</em> in the Foreign Quarter, they said.\
  \ Master Shaine will <em>never know</em>, they said. Cowards. Didn’t even show up,\
  \ and now I’m the one with extra chores.” </p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n   \

  ></a></td>\n        </tr> \n       </tbody>\n      </table> \n      <p>She gave\
  \ a brief snort. She’d been so sure that she’d been utterly silent when returning\
  \ from the revelry of Longnight, but even as she surreptitiously crawled back into\
  \ the initiate barracks, there Kreighton Shaine had been, sitting right on the other\
  \ side of the open window. As initiates were not allowed off the grounds of the\
  \ Grand Lodge except with permission, she had expected a scolding. What she got\
  \ instead was a series of impromptu haiku, about <em>birds</em> of all things. And\
  \ just when she thought the eccentric Dean of the Scrolls was going to let her off\
  \ without even a warning, she was assigned to tend to… this. Alone. </p> \n    \
  \  <p>Nixret sighed again as she looked at the countless birds before her. Usually,\
  \ it took half a dozen initiates to tend to a <em>garden of wonder</em>. All alone,\
  \ the exhausted kobold dragged herself off her rock and began to collect feathers\
  \ from the ground. </p> \n      <p>The Scrollmaster, strange as he could be at times,\
  \ was always very clear that the materials gathered from the gardens were to be\
  \ carefully collected and sorted, as Pathfinder agents being sent out on missions\
  \ would often receive them as gifts to help keep them safe. As she methodically\
  \ picked up feather after molted feather, her thoughts turned to two and a half\
  \ years ago, when Nixret, starry-eyed, had dreamed of being one of those adventurers.\
  \ She’d left the Sewer Dragons to join the Society, practically shouting to the\
  \ other kobolds that she’d become a legend by the time they saw her again. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>She chuckled to herself, picking a golden feather from the floor. “\
  I expected danger and discovery, not lectures and chores. Yet here I am, cleaning\
  \ up after a flock of enchanted birds.” She shook her head, though immediately regretted\
  \ the act thanks to her headache. “Hardly the work of a hero-to-be.” </p> \n   \
  \   <p>Still. She knew that the agents really did depend on these materials, and\
  \ even though the task was tedious, she did not want to let them down. After all,\
  \ within the coming year she would have her own initiation, and then, finally, she\
  \ would be the one on heroic adventures, her name read across the lands in one of\
  \ the Chronicles.</p> \n      <p>Perhaps, though, until then she’d think twice about\
  \ sneaking out. Master Shaine might be permissive, but he also has an infuriating\
  \ tendency to be exactly where you least expect to find him. And tending to squawking\
  \ birds while hungover was worse than any angry lecture she could have imagined.</p>\

  \     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>Heya!</p> \n     <p>So, people have asked me\
  \ “Will Pathfinder Society players get to use the Gardens of Wonder from Pathfinder\
  \ Treasure Vault? The answer is “You already have been the entire time!” In PFS,\
  \ every character gets some free consumables for each adventure, usually from the\
  \ Pathfinder school they’re associated with (Scrolls, Spells, or Swords). These\
  \ consumables don’t carry over between adventures and are provided so that adventuring\
  \ Pathfinders always have a little something extra beyond their standard kit, essentially\
  \ drawing from Gardens built and funded by the Pathfinder Society. The expiration\
  \ date and non-transferrable nature of the consumables help encourage PCs to use\
  \ them rather than selling them into the “weapon upgrade slush fund” or holding\
  \ onto them so long that they pass the level range in which the items would be most\
  \ useful.</p> \n     <p>What this all means is that Pathfinder Society players got\
  \ Gardens of Wonder way before everyone else! “But Mike,” you say, “School consumables\
  \ in PFS last the whole session and Garden of Wonder consumables last a day, how\
  \ could these be the same thing?” The answer is that the limitations on how long\
  \ the consumables last is something that every GM can, and should, feel free to\
  \ adjust for their players based on the type of game they run. PFS consumables essentially\
  \ last for “one 4-hour gaming session”, a unit of measurement that’s standardized\
  \ for organized play, but which doesn’t necessarily work with the playstyles or\
  \ gaming sensibilities of every home group. If the way PFS handles things fits the\
  \ adventures you run better than the default presented, use it! They’re the same\
  \ concept with the same goals, just tailored for different purposes. Don’t be afraid\
  \ to make the game your own! </p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
