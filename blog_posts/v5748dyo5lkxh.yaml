  \ \n    <p>You pick your bloodline at 1st level, which tells you which spell list\
  \ you use: arcane, divine, primal, or occult (the last of the four magical traditions,\
  \ which we'll cover in a future blog!). It also defines some of the spells you know.\
  \ For instance, the demonic bloodline gives you the divine spell list and the <i>fear</i>\
  \ spell at 1st level, in addition to two other spells that you choose yourself from\
  \ the divine list. In some cases, the special spells from your bloodline come from\
  \ other lists. For example, the demonic bloodline gives you <i>slow</i> when you\
  \ learn 3rd-level spells (for the sin of sloth) and <i>disintegrate</i> when you\
  \ learn 6th-level spells. There are a couple more. How about we look at that whole\
  \ bloodline entry and you can make your own guesses about which ones are from other\
  \ lists?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Demonic</h2> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >The demons of the Abyss debase all they touch, and one of your ancestors fell victim\
  \ to their corruption. You're burdened with dark thoughts and the desire for destruction.\
  \ This urge can be overcome if you choose to fight it, but the beauty of sin calls\
  \ to you always.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Spell List</b> divine (<i>Pathfinder\

  \ Greater Power: <i>abyssal wrath</i> (2)</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>You can\
  \ see that the bloodline also determines your most important skills and gives you\
  \ some bloodline powers. We've talked about powers before (see the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkqb?Cleric-Class-Preview\"\
  >cleric preview</a>. These are special spells you can get only from specific classes,\
  \ and they are cast using Spell Points rather than spell slots. They also automatically\
  \ heighten to the highest level of spell you can cast. You start out with a number\
  \ of Spell Points per day equal to your Charisma modifier, and if you have the demonic\
  \ bloodline, you gain the<i> glutton's jaws </i>power, which you can cast at a cost\
  \ of 1 Spell Point.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\

  \ levels, you'll get to make a swampy morass that makes creatures slothful or call\
  \ forth the dangers of an Abyssal realm.</p> \n    <p>The number of bloodlines in\
  \ the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> is fairly small, since we want to see\
  \ how people react to the new style of the class with just a subset of the bloodlines.\
  \ In the book, you'll see the following bloodlines: aberrant (occult), angelic (divine),\
  \ demonic (divine), draconic (arcane), fey (primal) and imperial (arcane). That\
  \ last one comes from the magical traditions of ancient mortals and matches our\
  \ iconic sorcerer, Seoni!</p> \n    <h2>Spontaneous Spellcasting</h2> \n    <p>This\
  \ is our first preview of a spontaneous spellcaster! The sorcerer gets the same\
  \ number of spells per day as a wizard, but she has a number of spells she knows\
  \ permanently instead of preparing them from a spellbook every day. The spells she\
  \ knows make up her spell repertoire. That means she can choose which spell to cast\
  \ each time she casts a spell instead of needing to plan ahead. It's worth noting\
  \ that the sorcerer now learns spells at the same character level as the wizard:\
  \ 2nd-level spells at 3rd level, 3rd-level spells at 5th level, and so on.</p> \n\
  \    <p>As you level up, you learn new spells and can replace some of the spells\
  \ you previously had with new ones. This lets you get rid of some spells that were\
  \ great options when they were at your highest level but maybe aren't worth casting\
  \ anymore.</p> \n    <p>The sorcerer's spellcasting is based on her inborn magical\
  \ potency, so she uses her Charisma for her spell rolls and spell DCs. Because Charisma\
  \ also adds to Resonance Points, the sorcerer can make up for some of her limited\
  \ spell choice compared to the wizard's spellbook by supplementing her spell selection\
  \ with more scrolls, staves, and wands.</p> \n    <h2>Sorcerer Features</h2> \n\
  \    <p>Many of the sorcerer's class features were explained under bloodline, as\
  \ most of them tie back to that choice. The sorcerer gains her advanced power at\
  \ 6th level and her greater bloodline power at 10th level. As with other spellcasters,\
  \ her proficiency with spell rolls and spell DCs increases to expert at 12th level,\
  \ master at 16th, and legendary at 19th.</p> \n    <p>The sorcerer gets one other\
  \ class feature, called spontaneous heightening. As mentioned before, some spells\
  \ in your lower-level spell slots get less useful as you go up in level. However,\
  \ there are some spells you might want to cast with any of your slots. The spontaneous\
  \ heightening feature lets you choose two spells at the start of each day that you\
  \ can cast as their heightened versions using any of your spell slots. That means\
  \ that if you want your angelic sorcerer to be able to cast 1st-level <i>heal</i>,\
  \ 2nd-level <i>heal</i>, and 3rd-level <i>heal</i>, you can choose your 1st-level\
  \ <i>heal</i> spell with spontaneous heightening rather than needing to learn the\
  \ spell in your spell repertoire at all three spell levels. Then you can cast a\
  \ 1st-level <i>heal</i> to top off someone's Hit Points when they're almost at full\
  \ and still cast a 3rd-level <i>heal </i>in the middle of a fight to really save\
  \ someone from the brink!</p> \n    <h2>Sorcerer Feats</h2> \n    <p>The sorcerer's\
  \ feats primarily deal with her spells. Sorcerers get metamagic feats, many of which\
  \ they share with other casters. One we haven't shown off yet is Overwhelming Spell\
  \ at 8th level, which lets a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage\
  \ ignore the first 10 points of a target's resistance.</p> \n    <p>If you want\
  \ to make a blaster, you can pick up Dangerous Sorcery, which increases the damage\
  \ of your spells by their spell level (with the exception of cantrips). You can\
  \ also take Blood Magic at 8th level, which uses the magical potential in your blood\
  \ to grant temporary Hit Points to you or a target of your spell if you're bleeding\
  \ when you cast it.</p> \n    <p>One of my favorite cycles of feats are the evolution\
  \ feats, which reinforce the themes of each magical tradition. Arcane Evolution\
  \ makes your arcane sorcerer trained in a skill and lets you add a spell from a\
  \ scroll to your spell repertoire for the day when you prepare each morning. Divine\
  \ Evolution lets you channel energy like a cleric. Occult Evolution gives you a\
  \ skill and lets you pick a spell with the mental trait to add to your repertoire\
  \ each day. Finally, Primal Evolution lets you cast <i>summon nature's ally</i>\
  \ as an innate spell once per day at the highest spell level you can cast.</p> \n\
  \    <p>How about a 20th-level feat? Sorcerers can take a feat to gain 10th-level\
  \ spells of their tradition, but you might want to look at other options, like Wellspring\
  \ Spell. This metamagic feat lets you cast a 5th-level or lower spell once per minute\
  \ without expending the spell slot!</p> \n    <p>What sort of predictions do you\
  \ have for the bloodlines? What spells will they get? Does this new scheme make\
  \ you more or less likely to play a sorcerer? Do you want to try out a gnome fey\
  \ sorcerer? How about an angelic sorcerer with the <i>heal</i> spell? Let us know\
  \ in the comments, and start preparing for when you get the book!</p> \n    <p>Logan\
