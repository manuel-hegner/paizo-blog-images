  \ James here, your favorite hapa senior designer on the Pathfinder rules and lore\
  \ team. The month of May (at least in the US) is when we take the time to acknowledge\
  \ and celebrate people of Asian or Pacific Islander heritage, and so we wanted to\
  \ take this chance to spotlight our API authors as well as show off some never-before-seen\
  \ art from our latest project to touch on these themes, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens\
  \ Tian Xia</em>. Enjoy! If you like someone’s work, consider leaving a compliment\
  \ to let them know or giving them a follow to keep up with their projects!</p> \n\

  \ \n     <p>Hello there! I’m a Korean American writer based in Chicago. Most of\
  \ my personal work is tied to themes of identity, both as a person of color and\
  \ as a person who identifies as LGBTQ+, and I draw on all aspects of my identity\
  \ to drive my work. I’ll be collaborating with a good friend to produce system-agnostic\
  \ supplements featuring original creatures and monsters for others to incorporate\
  \ into their campaigns in the near future! If you’re interested in keeping up with\
  \ that particular project along with anything else that I write, you can find me\
  \ on Twitter under the handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chromathesia/\">@chromathesia</a>.\
  \ You’ll also see some of my writing in both of Paizo’s upcoming <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens Tian Xia</em> books.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jeremy Blum (he/him)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Hi, I’m Jeremy! I’m Taiwanese on my mom’s side and American on my dad’\
  s. While I grew up in the United States, I spent the majority of my twenties living\
  \ in Taiwan and Hong Kong, which is where I first got into tabletop roleplaying\
  \ games. I was fortunate enough to channel some of my life experiences into the\
  \ upcoming <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em> and <em>Character\
  \ Guide</em>, and I’m psyched to see what people think of my first major TTRPG project.\
  \ Aside from reworking the Dragon Empires, I’ve contributed to the just-announced\
  \ <em>Howl of the Wild</em> creature book, worked on Pathfinder conversions for\
  \ the Korean mythology–inspired <em>Undying Corruption</em> project, helped the\
  \ rad folks over at the <em>Asians Represent</em> podcast with their forthcoming\
  \ <em>Wandering Blades </em>TTRPG, and dabbled in the world of wargaming with <em>Margrave:\
  \ The Marcher Lords</em>. You can see <a href=\"https://pixelgrotto.carrd.co/\"\
  >my full portfolio here</a>. When I’m not writing, you can find me on Twitter <a\
  \ href=\"https://twitter.com/PixelGrotto/\">@PixelGrotto</a>, where I’m usually\
  \ rambling about comics and obscure video games released two or three decades ago.</p>\

  \ Alyx, and I’m a queer, disabled, non-binary, Chinese-Vietnamese Canadian and a\
  \ TTRPG game designer, writer, artist, and GM, in addition to being an activist\
  \ and filmmaker. I’m devoted to bringing more authentic queer Asian representation\
  \ to the media and to play. I focus on stories that expand narratives divergent\
  \ from the mainstream. I’m absolutely excited to have contributed to, and written\
  \ for, Paizo’s upcoming <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</em>\
  \ and <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>!</p> \n     <p>My first\
  \ published work was a D&amp;D 5th Edition module in 2020, <em>The Great Zodiac\
  \ Race</em>, an adventure that allows players to reenact the Great Race origins\
  \ myth that determined the Chinese zodiac and lunar calendar. From there, I became\
  \ a curated play program GM with Magpie Games, have contributed to thousands of\
  \ dollars being raised in various TTRPG actual play charity streams, and am a board\
  \ member for the Tabletop Mentorship program. </p> \n     <p>Future projects I’\
  m also excited to be working on: I’m currently developing <em>Chinese Ghost Stories\
  \ We Tell Ourselves</em>, a communal horror tabletop roleplaying game based on Chinese\
  \ ghost stories and cultural interpretations that lets players find out what ghost\
  \ stories they’ll weave with their family. </p> \n     <p>Why representation matters\
  \ in TTRPGs is quite similar to why it matters in the media—when we don’t see ourselves\
  \ reflected on screen or in the TTRPG world, it’s a signal that we don’t matter\
  \ and our stories don’t exist. Our voices, our stories, our faces, and our beings\
  \ will always matter.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her)</h3> \n  \
  \   <p>Hi, everyone! I’m Dana Ebert, a Filipino American trans woman working as\
  \ a writer and game designer. I’m also the creative director at TPK Brewing Co.,\
  \ a TTRPG brewpub opening soon in Portland, OR, which, I’m proud to add, is majority-owned\
  \ by queer women of color and emphasizes partnerships with local vendors and artists.\

  \ I earned my 5th Nova for Starfinder Society two years ago and started tabletop\
  \ RPG freelance writing three years ago. I’ve written freelance assignments for\
  \ Evil Robot Games, Legendary Games, and Paizo. My most recent work includes next\

  \ cast has included Eleanor Ferron, Rob Helm, Scott Keim, Ron and Stephanie Lundeen,\
  \ Jason Tondro, and Mark Woolcott; <em>Presenting - Gamers Making Games</em>, an\
  \ interview show where I chat with game designers, developers, artists, and editors;\
  \ and most recently <em>Know Direction Beyond</em>, a Starfinder news, reviews,\

  \ life, I’ve been a university professor for 20 years, teaching entrepreneurship\
  \ and social venture creation. Prior to that, I was a vagabond who sailed the seven\

  \ Master with a fondness for exploring personal growth, Adam is on an endless quest\
  \ to create immersive experiences that push players to challenge the way they look\
  \ at the world. Sometimes, this means finding opportunities to spotlight a culture,\
  \ background, or way of life that isn’t often explored. Sometimes, it’s revealing\
  \ a new terrible horror to bring to life at the table.</p> \n     <p>As a Chinese/Puerto\
  \ Rican living in Canada, Adam is a big fan of telling stories with diverse voices.\
  \ Adam has contributed adventures, items, environments, and other worldbuilding\
  \ essentials to Lion Forge, Splinterverse, and, of course, Paizo! Fans of Tian Xia\
  \ will hopefully recognize his contribution, as dark humor and a deep love of horror\
  \ tends to bleed into much of his work. </p> \n     <p>When he isn’t crafting wordscapes\
  \ in Tian Xia, Adam spends his time building worlds in any medium that will have\
  \ him. He’s the author behind the post-apocalyptic superhuman webcomic, <em>Folklore</em>,\
  \ and a contributor to a number of creative anthologies focused on everything from\
  \ pirates to cyberpunk martial arts. His current major project is <em>Teldramir</em>;\
  \ this open-play TTRPG world setting provides community adventures in a persistent\
  \ world both for veterans and for players who are brand new to tabletop gaming.</p>\

  \ a professor that primarily teaches writing and rhetoric. As an instructor, I aim\
  \ to provide perspective on different voices through my student’s specific backgrounds\
  \ and diverse reading options. However, my research is on interactive storytelling\
  \ and how storytelling gives windows of opportunity for new voices. I had the privilege\
  \ of being a full-time Game Master before moving on to an instructor role. Being\
  \ a full-time GM opened many doors to the community, allowing me to become a writer\
  \ on a few projects. You may have seen my name on the announcement for <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em> and <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character\
  \ Guide</em>. Additionally, you can read my comic book and tabletop commentary on\
  \ the Major Spoilers entertainment website. </p> \n     <p>On top of teaching and\
  \ writing, my company, Skald’s Tale Entertainment, is thrilled to be producing new\
  \ actual play games in the upcoming months. My stories have a unique blend of my\
  \ heritage. Being multiracial Chinese and Caucasian, I like exploring the multiethnic\
  \ intersection within my stories. Check out the several projects set to release\
