  \   <p itemprop=\"description\">We are rapidly approaching the launch of the new\
  \ Paizo Store, which uses the BigCommerce platform, so it’s finally time to showcase\
  \ what’s waiting for you in subscriptions, how subscriptions work, and how subscribers\
  \ can add products to ship with their upcoming subscriptions!</p>\n      <h2>Starting\
  \ Your Subscription</h2>\n      <p>When you go to any subscription line page, the\
  \ first choice you’ll need to make is whether you want to start with the current\
  \ release for that line or the upcoming release. The current release will cost the\
  \ MSRP plus $.01; future releases will charge $.01 to start your subscription and\
  \ the MSRP as it starts the shipping process. The $.01 charge is required by the\
  \ credit card company to ensure that your card is valid for recurring subscriptions.</p>\n\
  \      <p>You can also choose to have multiple copies of a subscription item sent\
  \ to you as well.</p>\n      <h2>The Subscription Cycle</h2>\n      <br>\n     \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/54901470-3f6f-4a82-9a26-ad7cd5aab64a/PZO2109_NewInterlockingGears.png\"\

  \ 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Paizo’s release date for new\
  \ physical releases is usually the first Wednesday of every month. Three weeks prior\
  \ to that, you’ll receive an email from Paizo letting you know that you will be\
  \ charged for your upcoming subscriptions. Two weeks before the street date, your\
  \ credit card will be charged, and you’ll receive the free PDF for your product\
  \ (if applicable) in your Library. You’ll receive another email containing the tracking\
  \ information for your package once the Paizo Warehouse ships out your products.\
  \ As an example, here’s what your December 2025 subscription process would look\
  \ like:</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>November 10th</strong>: Email notification\
  \ of upcoming subscription charges with a direct link to your Subscription Manager.\
  \ More on that below.</li>\n       <li><strong>November 17th</strong>: Credit card\
  \ charge and PDF released to your Library.</li>\n       <li><strong>November 17th</strong>:\
  \ Your subscription products begin the shipping process, and you receive an email\
  \ with your tracking notification. The goal is to get the products to your door\
  \ on or before street date.</li>\n       <li><strong>December 3rd</strong>: Release\
  \ date!</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h2>Your Subscription Manager</h2>\n      <br>\n\

  \    </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>You’re always in control of your subscription\
  \ when you use the My Subscriptions section of your Paizo account. From here, you’\
  ll be able to see all your active and inactive subscriptions and be able to skip\
  \ or cancel each subscription 24/7. The email you receive 7 days before you’re charged\
  \ will direct you to this page as well.</p>\n      <p><strong>Shipping:</strong>\
  \ You control the shipping address for your subscriptions from your My Subscriptions\
  \ page, and you can change it at any time before your subscription is charged. Non-subscription\
  \ orders have their own shipping addresses that you can set during checkout, but\
  \ subscription orders are separate from the rest of the store. By default, products\
  \ are shipped using the least expensive shipping method available.</p>\n      <p>We\
  \ know that some of you would prefer a specific shipping method for your subscriptions,\
  \ and we have asked for that functionality from our vendor. We don’t have an ETA\
  \ for that, but if it becomes available, we’ll let you know.</p>\n      <p><strong>Billing</strong>:\
  \ As with your shipping address, the credit card attached here is separate from\
  \ the main store. This is because the Paizo Store accepts many different forms of\
  \ payments now, and recurring transactions (subscriptions) have limited payment\
  \ methods that they allow. For example, Google Pay and Apple Pay aren’t allowed\
  \ for recurring subscriptions.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ <br>\n      <p>As a subscriber, you’ll have the option to add most physical products\
  \ to your next subscription shipment, saving you money on shipping. All you have\
  \ to do is go to the product page for the item you want, and you’ll have a new option\
  \ below the Add to Cart button that will move the product over to your next subscription\
  \ order.</p>\n      <p>If any of the items added are out of stock when your subscription\
  \ is ready to ship, your subscription shipment will not be delayed; we'll ship any\
  \ in-stock items along with your subscription products, and any out-of-stock items\
  \ will be moved to your next subscription shipment. You’ll see these in your subscription\
  \ manager.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>FAQ</h2>\n      <h3>How do subscriptions work?</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Just choose the product line you'd like to subscribe to from the Subscriptions\
  \ page (such as Pathfinder Rulebooks, Starfinder Special Edition Rulebooks, and\
  \ others), add it to your cart, and go through the checkout process. During checkout,\
  \ you'll be given the option to start with either the current or next release in\
  \ the line—just click the radio button next to the product you'd like to start with.</p>\n\
  \      <p>If you choose the current product, you’ll be charged during checkout and\
  \ added to the subscription program you’ve selected.</p>\n      <h3>What advantages\
  \ are there to subscribing?</h3>\n      <p>Subscribers to any of our lines will\
  \ receive each subscription product directly from Paizo and need never worry about\
  \ missing one of our releases. Many of our Pathfinder and Starfinder products include\
  \ a free PDF of each subscription product purchased as part of the subscription.\
  \ Some subscriptions include a percentage discount on each new release. See the\
  \ individual subscription pages for more details!</p>\n      <p>If you’ve signed\
  \ up for Paizo Plus, your subscription purchases will also earn gold after each\
  \ successful charge. For more information, visit the Paizo Plus page.</p>\n    \
  \  <h3>When will I be charged for my subscription?</h3>\n      <p>During checkout\
  \ for a new subscription, Paizo will charge your card $.01 to validate the card\
  \ and set up the subscription.</p>\n      <p>Paizo normally releases our books on\
  \ the first Wednesday of the month. For those releases, you’ll receive an email\
  \ roughly 3 weeks before the release date that informs you about your upcoming subscriptions\
  \ as well as the date the card you have on file will be charged.</p>\n      <p>When\
  \ we charge your card, we will add the PDFs from your subscription products to your\
  \ Digital Library.</p>\n      <h3>How do I skip a release or cancel my subscription?</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Visit the <strong>Subscription Manager</strong>, to:</p>\n      <ul>\n\
  \       <li><strong>Skip</strong>: You won’t receive that product, but your subscription\
  \ will continue with the next release.</li>\n       <li><strong>Cancel</strong>:\
  \ Your subscription will be removed from your account. You can sign up again at\
  \ any point in the future by reactivating the subscription through the Subscription\
  \ Manager or by repurchasing through the store page.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h2><strong>What\
  \ credit card is charged for my subscriptions?</strong></h2>\n      <p>Paizo will\
  \ charge the credit card you originally signed up with until you change it through\
  \ the Subscription Manager. When you change your payment method in the Subscription\
  \ Manager, you change it for all your subscriptions. This won’t change your primary\
  \ store payment method for non-subscription products, and changing the primary store\
  \ payment method for your account won’t automatically change your subscription payment\
  \ method.</p>\n      <h2><strong>What happens if my credit card expires?</strong></h2>\n\
  \      <p>Paizo will send you an email alerting you that your card is expiring on\
  \ the 1<sup>st</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> of the month prior to expiration. You can\
  \ then change your default card in the Subscription Manager. That will update your\
  \ payment method across all your subscriptions.</p>\n      <h2><strong>Can I use\
  \ coupons or gift cards for my subscriptions?</strong></h2>\n      <p>Yes, but only\
  \ on the initial order of the subscription. A valid credit card is required even\
  \ if the gift card or coupon amount exceeds the product cost. Your credit card will\
  \ always be charged $.01 to validate your subscription.</p>\n      <h2><strong>Are\
  \ multiple subscriptions sent in the same order?</strong></h2>\n      <p>If your\
  \ subscriptions share the same payment date, payment method, and shipping address,\
  \ they will ship as a single order.</p>\n      <h2><strong>How are subscriptions\
  \ mailed?</strong></h2>\n      <p>Paizo will always mail your products using the\
  \ least expensive method available. Selecting a specific method for subscription\
  \ orders is not currently supported.</p>\n      <h2><strong>Does Paizo offer combined\
  \ shipping for non-subscription orders?</strong></h2>\n      <p>Yes. You can combine\
  \ a regular order with a subscription order if:</p>\n      <ol>\n       <li>You\
  \ place that order prior to your subscription products being charged, and</li>\n\
  \       <li>Both orders use the same payment method and shipping address.</li>\n\
  \      </ol>\n      <p>To add an item to an upcoming subscription order, visit the\
  \ page of the item you wish to add to your order and find the ‘<strong>Add this\
  \ to My Subscription</strong>’ button. You will be charged for both your subscription\
  \ products and any added products.</p>\n      <p>If any of the items in your sidecart\
  \ are out of stock when your subscription is ready to ship, your subscription shipment\
  \ will not be delayed; we'll ship any in-stock items along with the subscription,\
  \ and any out-of-stock items will remain in your sidecart to ship with a future\
  \ subscription shipment.</p>\n      <h2><strong>Are international subscriptions\
  \ available?</strong></h2>\n      <p>Yes—we ship worldwide.</p>\n      <h2><strong>How\
  \ often do you ship subscriptions?</strong></h2>\n      <p>Many product lines have\
  \ months between releases. For example, the Pathfinder Rulebooks line only has 3-4\
  \ releases per year. You will see these details in the Subscription Manager, on\
  \ our Release Schedule page, and on the product pages in the Paizo Store.</p>\n\
  \      <h2><strong>I just ordered a subscription. Why isn't my first volume shipping?</strong></h2>\n\
  \      <p>It may be that the item you chose to start with has not yet been released.\
  \ The Subscription Manager shows the estimated schedule for your upcoming subscription\
  \ items. You can see more upcoming releases on our ReleaseSchedule page.</p>\n \
  \     <h2><strong>I just ordered a subscription that includes a free PDF. Where's\
  \ the PDF?</strong></h2>\n      <p>We add the PDF of each volume to your Digital\
  \ Library page as soon as you are charged for the print edition.</p>\n      <h2><strong>Does\
  \ Paizo offer PDF-only subscriptions?</strong></h2>\n      <p>Digital subscriptions\
  \ are not currently supported.</p>\n      <h2><strong>Does Paizo offer subscriptions\
  \ through local gaming stores?</strong></h2>\n      <p>We do not. That might change\
  \ in the future for stores that want to order directly from Paizo, so make sure\
  \ to ask your local game store to carry Paizo products. To find a store in your\
  \ area, visit our Retailer Locator.</p>\n      <br>\n      <p>Thanks again for supporting\
  \ Paizo, and I hope to see you later this week for another store blog!</p>\n   \
  \   <p>Good Gaming!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
