  \ RPG Day Sanctioning</h3> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">This year’s delightful\
  \ Free RPG adventures, Pathfinder Adventure: Big Trouble in Little Absalom and Starfinder\
  \ Adventure: Skitter Home are sanctioned for use in Paizo Organized Play programs\
  \ as of their release date of Saturday, July 25th, 2020. Sanctioning guidelines\
  \ and chronicle sheets will be uploaded to the product pages before then.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Pathfinder players may use one of the five provided pregenerated kobold\
  \ characters, applying credit to one of their characters as per the standard Society\
  \ rules. Once the Advanced Player’s Guide releases (July 30th), players may create\
  \ kobold characters for Society play, including using them in Free RPG day adventure.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Starfinder adventure utilizes either Skittermander Society characters\
  \ of fourth level or one of the four provided pregenerated skittermanders. If using\
  \ a pregen, credit application follows Starfinder Society guidelines. Remember that\
  \ Starfinder Near Space provides character options for use in building new skittermander\
  \ PCs!</p> \n     <p>There are a few restrictions for when and how Free RPG Day\
  \ adventures. These are different than in prior years, to take into account social\
  \ distancing due to Covid-19:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>GMs are permitted to run\
  \ on a VTT for their local group, provided they get a physical copy from the store\
  \ and are only running for local players.</li> \n      <li>Once the scenario is\
  \ released digitally on paizo.com in August, anybody may run it online or in-person\
  \ for whomever wants to play!</li> \n      <li>As always, you can get credit for\
  \ the scenario twice: once as a player and once as a GM.</li> \n     </ul> \n  \
  \   <h3>Achievement Points Update</h3> \n     <p>This morning, the last piece of\
  \ the AcP puzzle fell into place and we turned on boon purchasing. You will now\
  \ see a full list of purchasable Character Options on the Boon tab of your My Organized\
  \ Play page. While our intention is to rotate boon options out, with the delay in\
  \ launching AcP we intend to keep this first batch of boons until the end of the\
  \ year. We may add to the options, but we won’t take anything away without plenty\
  \ of warning towards the end of the year.</p> \n     <p>To help you navigate through\
  \ the new features, we’ve put together a description of the information found on\
  \ several tabs of your My Organized Play page, followed by a list of anticipated\
  \ FAQ. If you have a question that isn’t answered below, please post it in the comments\
  \ and we will get it answered, as well as including it on future iterations of the\
  \ FAQ.</p> \n     <h3><em>Sessions Tab</em></h3> \n     <p>Your Sessions Tab holds\
  \ a display of every game you’ve played, and that GMs reported by Paizo.com. We’\
  ve listed a breakdown of the columns below:</p> \n     <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"\
  > \n      <li><b>Date</b>: when the session took place</li> \n      <li><b>GM</b>:\
  \ the GM’s name</li> \n      <li><b>Scenario</b>: the scenario, module or AP volume\
  \ you played</li> \n      <li><b>Points</b>: the base value of the adventure, including\
  \ GM credit and AcP. (This AcP value is not necessarily what you earned!)</li> \n\
  \      <li><b>Event</b>: the event this session took place at</li> \n      <li><b>Session</b>:\
  \ the session number assigned to the table.</li> \n      <li><b>Player</b>: Your\
  \ Organized Play ID #</li> \n      <li><b>Character</b>: the character that received\
  \ credit for this session</li> \n      <li><b>Faction</b>: the faction that character\
  \ earned reputation with</li> \n      <li><b>AcP Earned</b>: The amount of AcP you\
  \ earned, after applying any multipliers from a Premier or Premier Plus event to\
  \ the base value earned</li> \n      <li><b>Prest/Rep</b>: Reputation or Prestige\
  \ earned from this session</li> \n      <li><b>Notes</b>: Any other notes added\
  \ by the system</li> \n     </ul> \n     <h3>Boons Tab</h3> \n     <p>This is your\
  \ Boons tab, where you will spend your Achievement Points. At the top, you will\
  \ see how much AcP you have to spend. To purchase, select the character you are\
  \ purchasing for with the dropdown at the top of the screen, then click “Purchase”\
  \ on the right side of the screen.  </p>\n     <p>After you purchase a boon, it\
  \ will be available for download beneath the available boons. It is a downloadable\
  \ PDF, which you can keep for your records and/or print out, per campaign guidelines\
  \ for providing supporting documentation.</p> \n     <p>Characters may have only\
  \ one ancestry boon. Ancestry boons may be added to a character who has chronicles\
  \ assigned but not applied. Other boons may be added at any time as long as language\
  \ in the boon does not specify otherwise. Guide 2.0 will include language about\
  \ applying AcP boons. </p> \n     <p>Boons must be purchased in between scenarios,\
  \ to not slow down gameplay. </p> \n     <h3>Achievement Points Frequently Asked\
  \ Questions</h3> \n     <p><b>Can I change my ancestry and background with one of\
  \ the rebuild boons?</b><br> It depends on the rebuild boon. Rewrite History permits\
  \ you to change Ancestry and Background. This boon phases out of use August 31,\
  \ 2020. Career Change and Evolving Destiny do not.</p> \n     <p><b>Can party members\
  \ help purchase the Second Chance boon?</b><br> Party members may contribute gold\
  \ to any costs incurred as part of the resurrection ritual. They may also sell the\
  \ deceased characters’ items to help contribute to the cost if the player consents.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>What does unlocking access to items mean?</b><br> When you have access\
  \ to an uncommon or rare item, you can purchase it at its listed price. You can\
  \ also purchase the formula for these items you have access to from the Pathfinder\
  \ Society at the same price as a common formula of the same level. Only the PC with\
  \ the relevant boon attached gains access to this item.</p> \n     <p>Formulas for\
  \ items which limit how many a character may obtain are not available. </p>\n  \
  \   <p><b>What does unlocking access to spells mean?</b><br> Having access to an\
  \ uncommon or rarer spell means that your character(s) can learn the spell in the\
  \ same way they learn other spells, provided they meet all prerequisites. A character\
  \ must have access to the spell to learn it from another character that knows it.\
  \ Only the PC with the relevant boon attached gains access to this spell.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>What spells are available with the Esoteric Spellcaster - Core Rulebook\
  \ boon?</b><br> The spells available are: <em>circle of protection, discern lies,\
  \ drop dead, ethereal jaunt, false vision, globe of invulnerability, hallucinatory\
  \ terrain, locate, magic aura, mind blank, mind reading, nondetection, power word\
  \ blind, power word kill, power word stun, protection, spell turning, stone tell,\

  \ do I do if I have errors in my reporting?</b><br> First, check with the GM or\
  \ event coordinator to see if they can correct it. If not, reach out to your local\
  \ Venture-Captain or email issues to <a href=\"mailto:pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com\"\
  >pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com</a>. Please include photos or scans of the chronicle\
  \ relating to the game with the error to make correcting info easier and faster.</p>\

  \ thank everyone for your patience as we worked through the bugs and got the system\
