  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\"> In case you're\
  \ new to our projects or what Order of the Amber Die is all about, here's a quick\
  \ rundown: We have been dedicated to pushing the envelope of tabletop role-playing\
  \ since 1987. After more than five years on the Paizo blog, including three full\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shdq?Order-of-the-Amber-Die-Beyond-the-Veiled-Past\"\
  >Adventure Paths</a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgfm?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Pathfinder Playtest</a>, we were looking for a new project, and our first one in\
  \ Pathfinder 2nd Edition no less. We had never presented anything from Paizo's modules\
  \ line, but just a few minutes after scanning the options, a new project was born:\
  \ The Slithering Salve! Over the years, author Ron Lundeen has shown up as one of\
  \ the more frequent names from the adventures we've played, and The Slithering will\
  \ mark the fourth adventure of his that the Order has taken on. </p> \n      <p>Oozes\
  \ have been a staple of adventurers' bad dreams for decades of this game now, and\
  \ tales of the \"the room with the ooze\" from any given dungeon are fairly common\
  \ on the messageboards. However, a module that features ooze as part of its central\
  \ plot can be difficult to find--for good reason--which is why this adventure and\
  \ the myriad oozes within it deserve the highest level of appreciation we can give\
  \ them. Throughout this adventure, any player whose character is hit by an ooze\
  \ during combat must stick their hand into a five-gallon bucket of disgusting slime,\
  \ and retrieve a die at the bottom of the bucket for each hit they received. We\
  \ told you we push the envelope! </p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><b>Module</b>: The\
  \ Slithering</li> \n       <li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 61 hours</li> \n       <li><b>Session\
  \ Hours</b>: 29hrs, 40min</li> \n      </ul> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>The Order has between ten and fifteen\
  \ active members at any given time, and each roster is unique to each project. The\
  \ team for The Slithering Salve is our most diverse and perhaps most challenging,\
  \ in that we have ages ranging from forty-seven to fourteen, and experience varying\
  \ from veterans with over thirty years to even a complete newcomer to the game.\
  \ We also have a friend and patron along for this project: Karee Vogrin of <a href=\"\
  https://criticalhitcookies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Critical Hit Cookies</a>, with\
  \ hair dyed green to match Lini! Finally, with such a diverse array of locals across\
  \ the city of Kibwe, our GM tapped two additional members of the Order for live-NPC\
  \ roles throughout our journey.</p> \n      <h3>Highlights From <em>The Slithering</em>:</h3>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li>Are your veterans too familiar with the various kinds\
  \ of oozes in Pathfinder? Perhaps you're worried about them metagaming which types\
  \ of damage to apply? Enter the fuming sludge, a new ooze that put three of our\
  \ characters on the ground and slithered over their precious hero points with its\
  \ ability to prevent the curing of persistent bleed. Oh, you're going to do the\
  \ run-away-and-shoot routine? Hope you can duck ejected globs of sludge!</li> \n\
  \       <br> \n       <li>Oozes aren't the only thing we fought in <em>The Slithering</em>.\
  \ Inside one of the oldest buildings in Kibwe, Jirelle opened a door and peered\
  \ through the torchlight. Staring back at her--six times before help got there--were\
  \ a pair of basilisks. Six successful saving throws made, never tell a swashbuckler\
  \ the odds!</li> \n       <br> \n       <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n        <a\

  ></a>\n        <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n       </div> \n       <li>We\
  \ decided to employ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024tn?Pathfinder-Critical-Hit-Deck\"\
  >Critical Hit Deck</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024ud?Pathfinder-Critical-Fumble-Deck\"\
  >Critical Fumble Deck</a>, with deadly variants applied to both, causing a card\
  \ to be drawn on any crits/fumbles (not just natural 20s or 1s). In total, we saw\
  \ twenty-seven critical hits and sixteen fumbles throughout the first half of the\
  \ adventure. This resulted in some raucous combats, like the one where Zithembe\
  \ the catfolk fighter threw his greataxe (not by choice), drew his greatclub, and\
  \ proceeded to break it--in the same round!</li> \n       <br> \n       <li>Playing\
  \ iconic characters has moments when a player gets to add to the lore of the iconic.\
  \ While lifting up a map inside a caravan house belonging to the Aspis Consortium,\
  \ Korakai discovered a <em>feather token (fan)</em>, just like the one his <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh9p?Meet-The-Iconics-Korakai\">grandfather\
  \ used to dance with</a>. </li> \n       <br> \n       <li>Kibwe was reason enough\
  \ to play this adventure. The soundtrack to <em>Tsotsi</em> accompanied us as we\
  \ explored nearly every block of the ten distinct districts of the city and met\
  \ its inhabitants. As one of the adventure's more memorable encounters, we had to\
  \ persevere in a heated debate in front of a large crowd (complete with module-specific\
  \ debate system) about the contributions of non-humans and the value of diversity.</li>\
  \ \n      </ul> \n      <h3>The Salve:</h3> \n      <p>We weren't sure how we were\
  \ going to feel playing an adventure about an out-of-control curse, spreading throughout\
  \ the population of Kibwe with the backdrop of 2020 all around us. This being OAD\
  \ though, we weren't going to shy away from any adventure that provides something\
  \ new for us, and we were willing to make heavy sacrifices to have such a unique\
  \ experience. We spent the weekend contact-tracing in Kibwe, discovering as much\
  \ as we could about how the curse was spreading and even daring to visit the quarantined\
  \ victims--eventually coming to the understanding that our own characters might\
  \ now be vectors. The group agreed that as an out-of-game experience we found it\
  \ cathartic, even a somewhat surprising outlet for expression during this challenging\
  \ time. There was a great sense of hope that our characters could do what we at\
  \ the table could not. By the end of the weekend, we came to feel as if the \"Salve\"\
  \ in our project's title has several meanings, one of which applies to the players.</p>\

  \ (casts <em>electric arc</em>, two jellies become four jellies)<br> Droogami: \"\

  \ electricity, five jellies become six)<br> Zithembe: \"Rraaawwwrrr!\" (attacks\
  \ with greataxe, six jellies become seven) <br> Jirelle: \"This sounds like a good\
  \ time to get out of Kibwe, honestly.\"</p> \n      <h3>Current Situation:</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>We managed to discern the origin of the curse affecting Kibwe; unfortunately,\
  \ the remedy appears to be one of the ancient pillar-watchers of the city, known\
  \ as Cursebreaker. After chasing down clues, we must venture 140 miles deeper into\
  \ Mwangi, to a place called Holy Xatramba. Little is known of the ruined city, both\
  \ in-game and from Paizo's published material on it. There are demons within, we\
  \ do know that...</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/ca95fc4a-75c9-4ae1-acd1-722685cc0597/110620_JungleShot.jpg\"\
