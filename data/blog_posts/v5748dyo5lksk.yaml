  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lks6?Building-Monsters\"\
  >Monday's monster blog</a>, Mark told you about some of the changes we made to monsters\
  \ to make them more engaging and easy to run. So how did we turn all that into something\
  \ you can use? Well, we put a lot of thought into making a new monster stat block\
  \ that would be more concise, while remaining flexible enough that we can still\
  \ keep a similar level of complexity for some of our most powerful and iconic monsters.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But let's start small. Well... big, but also small. You'll see.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>So Now There's Ogres, Okay?</h2> \n     <p>Oh no... what's that smell?\
  \ It's like a gym bag ate roadkill!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-title\">Ogre <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Creature 3</span></p> \n \
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Chaotic, Evil, Giant, Humanoid, Large</p> \n   \

  \ javelin +8 (thrown 30 feet), <b>Damage</b> 1d6+7</p> \n     </blockquote> \n \
  \    <p>Ah, of course. It's an ogre! This is an example of one of the simplest stat\
  \ blocks in the playtest. Ogres are big bruisers, and they don't have a whole lot\
  \ of special actions to use. They play a role as big challenges for low-level groups\
  \ and in groups as minions for higher-level threats, so having them be simple makes\
  \ plenty of sense for how they're used in the game. You might notice that this stat\
  \ block is shorter than a Pathfinder First Edition stat block. We think this will\
  \ give us more room for other text in our bestiaries and adventures. Some elements\
  \ went away because of rules simplifications, while other pieces of information,\
  \ like organization and environment, will appear in the monster's text instead of\
  \ in the stat block.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180518-Attack.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>We don’t have art of ogres or redcaps yet, but check out this\
  \ illustration by Wayne Reynolds of a bugbear!</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Quick\
  \ reminder: the [[A]] symbol is code for \"action,\" and it will have a special\
  \ icon in the actual <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook </em>and other products. You'll\
  \ also see an [[R]] later to represent a reaction.</p> \n     <p>You can see how\
  \ a stat block leads off with the creature's name and level, followed by its traits.\
  \ These traits include its alignment and size. The top section of the stat block\
  \ continues with the first stats you'll typically use, since you'll be determining\
  \ whether the PCs and monsters can see one another (requiring you to use Perception),\
  \ or the party might start out with an interaction (meaning you'll use the monster's\
  \ languages and skills). The skills entry first lists a number you can use (in addition\
  \ to the relevant ability modifier) for any skills the monster doesn't have listed,\
  \ followed by a list of all the skills the monster has a different modifier for.\
  \ So if you needed to roll an Acrobatics check for the ogre, you'll roll 1d20 and\
  \ add 4, which is much better than its base modifier plus its Dex modifier (a total\
  \ of +0).</p> \n     <p>You'll also notice the monster gives just its ability score\
  \ modifiers instead of scores. This lets you make calculations more quickly, and\
  \ since monsters don't increase their scores the same way PCs do, listing those\
  \ is unnecessary. Monsters with items also list those up top.</p> \n     <p>There's\
  \ a line to show where the monster's defenses start. Our ogre's pretty straightforward,\
  \ with just ACs, saves, and Hit Points.</p> \n     <p>The next line separates the\
  \ statistics and actions the monster can use on its turn. Here, that's Speed and\
  \ the ogre's Strikes: an ogre hook and javelins! Even though the ogre doesn't have\
  \ any special actions, it does have some special options due to its ogre hook. In\
  \ parentheses, you can see the ogre hook's traits: deadly 1d10 (making it deal 1d10\
  \ more damage on a critical hit—ow!), a reach of 10 feet (letting the ogre attack\
  \ past the first space), and trip (which lets the ogre trip using its hook instead\
  \ of its body). Just as in Pathfinder First Edition, the reach comes from the ogre's\
  \ size—the hook itself isn't long enough to increase reach.</p> \n     <p>So you\
  \ can see the stat block is organized so that you're looking at the middle section\
  \ when it's not the monster's turn, and at the bottom section on its turn. We think\
  \ that will make it easier to use at the table, but we'd love to hear your feedback\
  \ as you run these monsters during the playtest!</p> \n     <h2>Blood and Boots</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>So how about a stat block that has a bit more going on? Here's a redcap:\
  \ the nasty, brutal little fey with oversized scythes. This is a moderately complex\
  \ monster. We won't be showing you any liches or pit fiends today, but the redcap\
  \ will demonstrate how we present a few special abilities.</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Redcap <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Creature\
  \ 5</span></p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Evil, Fey, Small</p> \n      <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Perception</b> +10, low-light vision</p> \n      <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Languages</b> Aklo, Common, Giant, Sylvan</p> \n   \
  \   <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Skills</b> +5; Acrobatics +13, Athletics +13, Deception\
  \ +13, Intimidation +11, Nature +11, Stealth +13</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Str</b> +4, <b>Dex</b> +4, <b>Con</b> +4, <b>Int</b> +3, <b>Wis</b> +1, <b>Cha</b>\
  \ +2</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Items</b> red cap, expert Medium scythe,\
  \ iron boots</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Red Cap</b> (arcane, necromancy)\
  \ A redcap's shapeless woolen hat is dyed with the blood of its victims. If the\
  \ redcap loses its cap, it no longer benefits from fast healing and takes a -4 conditional\
  \ penalty to its damage rolls. It can create a new cap in 10 minutes, but that cap\
  \ doesn't grant its powers until the redcap has turned it red with Blood Soak. A\
  \ cap has no benefit for creatures other than redcaps.</p> \n      <hr style=\"\
  margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>AC</b> 20, <b>TAC</b>\
  \ 19; <b>Fort </b>+8, <b>Ref </b>+11, <b>Will</b> +9</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>HP</b> 55, fast healing 10; <b>Weaknesses</b> cold iron 5, irreligious</p> \n\
  \      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Irreligious</b> (emotion, fear, mental) If a\
  \ redcap sees a creature brandish a holy symbol of a good deity or use one for the\
  \ Material Casting of a divine spell, the redcap must attempt a DC 17 Will save.\
  \ On a failure, the redcap is frightened 4 and fleeing for 1 round; on a success,\
  \ it's frightened 2; on a critical success, it's unaffected. To brandish a holy\
  \ symbol, a creature must Interact to brandish it for 1 round (similar to Raising\
  \ a Shield). Once a redcap has to attempt a save against a brandished holy symbol,\
  \ it is bolstered against brandished holy symbols for the next 10 minutes.</p> \n\
  \      <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Speed</b>\
  \ 50 feet</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">[[A]] <b>Melee</b> scythe +13 (deadly\
  \ 1d10, trip), <b>Damage</b> 2d10+4 slashing<br> boot +13 (agile, versatile B),\
  \ <b>Damage</b> 2d4+8 piercing</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">[[A]] <b>Blood\
  \ Soak</b> (manipulate) The redcap dips its cap in the blood of a slain foe. The\
  \ foe must have died in the last minute, and the redcap must have helped kill it.\
  \ The redcap gains a +4 conditional bonus on damage rolls for 1 minute.</p> \n \
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">[[R]] <b>Deadly Cleave</b></p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Trigger</b> The redcap drops a creature to 0 Hit Points with a\
  \ scythe Strike.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Effect</b> The redcap\
  \ makes another scythe Strike against a different creature, using the same multiple\
  \ attack penalty as the scythe Strike that triggered this reaction. This counts\
  \ toward its multiple attack penalty.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">[[A]]\
  \ <b>Stomp</b> The redcap Strides up to half its Speed and makes a boot Strike at\
  \ any point during that movement. If the boot Strike hits a prone creature, it deals\
  \ an extra 2d6 persistent bleed damage.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>You can\
  \ see here that the redcap has an ability to represent its blood-soaked hat, and\
  \ that appears in the top section because it affects all of its statistics. You'll\
  \ also notice the weakness to cold iron that comes from being a fey creature. One\
  \ of the nice things about the new system of building monsters is that we can just\
  \ give monsters the statistics we want them to have instead of sometimes building\
  \ them in strange ways to get their statistics to be good. For instance, in Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition, a fey might have had far more Hit Dice than expected to get its\
  \ statistics high enough, which led to odd results from abilities that counted Hit\
  \ Dice. Now, the redcap gets statistics that are suitable for its level and how\
  \ it's used.</p> \n     <p>You can see the Irreligious ability is an example of\
  \ a special ability that will come up when it's not the monster's turn. A redcap\
  \ can be scared off by symbols of divinity!</p> \n     <p>In the bottom section,\
  \ you see two special actions and a reaction. The reaction appears down here because\
  \ the trigger is most likely to occur during the recap's own turn. You'll also see\
  \ how some of the basic actions of the game end up being used in other actions.\
  \ For instance, Stomp tells you that the redcap uses Stride and Strike. An ability\
  \ like this lets you know any ways in which these actions operate differently than\
  \ using them normally.</p> \n     <h2>Spell It Out</h2> \n     <p>How about just\
  \ one more example for today? Let's look at how innate spells work. These are much\
  \ like spell-like abilities from Pathfinder First Edition, but they function more\
  \ like spells than they used to. The only difference between these and other spells\
  \ is that the number of times the monster can cast them is based on the monster\
  \ itself rather than on a spellcasting class. Innate spell entries look much like\
  \ prepared spells, with a couple extra categories of usability. Here are some we\
  \ stole from the efreeti:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Innate Arcane Spells</b> DC 22, attack +17; <b>Constant</b> <i>detect magic;\
  \ </i><b>5th</b> <i>illusory object</i>; <b>4th</b> <i>gaseous form</i>, <i>invisibility</i>\
  \ (×2); <b>At Will</b> <i>plane shift</i> (7th, to Elemental Planes, Astral Plane,\
  \ or Material Plane only); <b>Cantrips</b> <i>produce flame</i> (4th)</p> \n   \
  \  </blockquote> \n     <p>The spell DC is listed right there, along with the attack\
  \ bonus for touch attacks since the efreeti has <i>produce flame</i>. <i>Illusory\
  \ object</i> is presented the same way a prepared 5th-level spell would be, as are\
  \ <i>gaseous form</i> and the two spell slots of <i>invisibility</i>. Anything that\
  \ doesn't come in a level entry is cast at its lowest level unless a level appears\
  \ in parentheses. You can see that happening with the <i>produce flame</i> cantrip,\
  \ which the efreeti casts as a 4th-level spell. Its <i>detect magic</i> is level\
  \ 1, but that's a constant ability that functions all the time for the efreeti.\
  \ The other special way a creature can use innate spells is with at-will spells.\
  \ These are spells the monster can cast as many times as it wants even though they\
  \ aren't normally cantrips. The efreeti can cast <i>plane shift</i> any number of\
  \ times, but the parentheses tell you that it's the 7th-level version and that it\
  \ can go only to certain planes.</p> \n     <p>What do you think of this take on\
  \ monster presentation? Do you think it'll be easy to use these stat blocks in your\
  \ game?</p> \n     <p>Logan Bonner<br> <i>Designer</i></p> \n    </div> <!-- tags:\
