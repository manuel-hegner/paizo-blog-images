  description\">November is upon us again, which means it's time to release a new\
  \ evergreen mission for the latest crop of wide-eyed <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a> agents. These low-level, replayable scenarios are designed\
  \ for new players and veteran players alike. For new players, they include context\
  \ and pointers for the PCs on a level that would feel out of place in a 1-5 scenario,\
  \ with 5th level characters receiving advice meant for trainees. They are evergreen,\
  \ tied to the Pathfinder Society's mission as a whole, so they stay relevant and\
  \ focus on the information that is useful background regardless of the season. For\
  \ our most prolific players, replayable scenarios are a way to bring characters\
  \ through level 1 without expending the limited resource of scenarios they have\
  \ not yet played. We expect that some people will play an evergreen scenario many\
  \ times, and so it's important that we make sure that the scenario has surprises\
  \ in store for people on their 5th playthrough. The replayable scenarios have randomized\
  \ elements and other GM options to introduce variety and support multiple approaches\
  \ that the PCs might take. With each replayable scenario (including this month's\
  \ new release), we've increased the number of ways that the GM and players can customize\
  \ their experience. My favorite part of evergreen scenarios is the way that they\
  \ bring new players and experienced players together. Anyone can grab a first level\
  \ pregen, pull up a chair, and join in.</p> \n     <p>People often ask how the \"\
  replayable\" part of replayable scenarios works. If you were wondering that too,\
  \ check out the spoiler below.</p> \n     <div style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">\n\
  \      <b>Replay Rules for 1-2 Evergreen Scenarios</b> \n      <input type=\"button\"\
  \ value=\"Show\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n      <div class=\"spoiler-text\"\
  > \n       <p>A player can play a replayable scenario an unlimited number of times\
  \ with 1st-level characters, and once with a 2nd-level character. Similarly, a GM\
  \ can apply credit for a running a replayable scenario multiple times to as many\
  \ of her 1st-level characters as she likes, and she can apply credit to a 2nd-level\
  \ character once.</p>\n      </div>\n     </div> \n     <p>Our first replayable\
  \ scenarios were the scenarios of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8jor\"><em>First Steps</em></a>\
  \ trilogy. With the shake-ups to the factions that have happened since then, the\
  \ <em>First Steps</em> trilogy became a bit dated, and there was widespread sentiment\
  \ that three scenarios was a bit long for our spotlight introduction to the game.\
  \ That being said, we have heard the feedback that people would like to see First\
  \ Steps Parts 2 and 3 unretired, and we are looking into that idea as a team.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Two years ago, we released <a href=\"/products/btpy92ci\"><em>The Confirmation</em></a>,\
  \ a mission that takes trainee Pathfinders out of the heart of Absalom on a journey\
  \ to prove themselves that is far too dangerous for one agent to handle alone. The\
  \ following year, we released a new 1-2 evergreen scenario, <a href=\"/products/btpy9a1y\"\
  ><em> The Wounded Wisp</em></a>. In the <em>Wounded Wisp</em>, the PCs travel all\
  \ over Absalom to unlock a mystery from the Society's earliest years. In the process,\
  \ they uncover information that is particularly relevant to a story arc in Season\
  \ 6.</p> \n     <div style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">\n      <b>To keep this scenario\
  \ fresh, we've released an update</b> \n      <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\"\
  \ onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n      <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      \
  \ <p>The update is to the secret journals that the PCs uncover at the end of the\
  \ adventure, which reveals some of the secrets of an upcoming Season 7 scenario.\
  \ We know that some people may prefer to use the existing handout to foreshadow\
  \ events in Season 6, so rather than replacing the handout in the scenario itself,\
  \ we've added a new file to the scenario download that includes both the Season\
  \ 6 information and the Season 7 information. We will be updating this handout each\
  \ season with more secrets for your beginning Pathfinders to discover.</p>\n   \
  \   </div>\n     </div> \n     <p>This month's new evergreen, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9hgx/\"\
  ><em>The Consortium Compact</em></a>, pits the PCs against one of the Society's\
  \ time-honored rivalsâ€”the Aspis Consortium. With the help of insider information,\
  \ the PCs have the chance to pull the rug out from under the Aspis and stop them\
  \ from carrying out a reprehensible plot.</p> \n     <p>In the comments below, tell\
  \ us about your favorite first introduction of a new character to the Pathfinder\
  \ Society! Be sure to include spoiler tags as needed.</p> \n     <p>Linda Zayas-Palmer<br>\
