  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 30th, 2009</p> \n    <p>Greetings Paizonians!\
  \ Tomorrow is Paizo’s seventh anniversary! In celebration, I thought I would share\
  \ with you Paizo’s most closely guarded secret: the Golem’s stats! For months I\
  \ have watched the foolish drunkards <i>Vadid</i> and <i>Nahk</i> as they’ve braved\
  \ the Paizo vaults, and while they’ve had the guardians distracted with their bumbling\
  \ antics, I secretly gathered information on their nemesis, the Paizo Golem. Finally,\
  \ I have assembled enough clues to piece together a complete picture of this mysterious\
  \ being, and I present them here, compatible with the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG</a>!</p> \n    <p><b>The Golem</b></p> \n    <p><i>The tall, dusty\
  \ shelves loom high overhead, reaching ever upward to the high-vaulted ceiling and\
  \ stretching forever away into dusk and shadow. Before the endless walls of yellowed\
  \ scrolls, leather-bound tomes, and crystal balls of unknowable secrets stands an\
  \ immense, silent figure. A single, pale light from behind it frames its hulking\
  \ silhouette. It stalks forward on thundering limbs and the shadow it wears falls\
  \ away, revealing a smooth, iron-black body, devoid of any features but the two\
  \ fiery orbs that regard the intruders with a powerful, burning intellect.</i></p>\

  \  <br>\n     <br> <b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b>\n     <br> <b>Shatter the Earth (Su)\
  \ </b>As a standard action, the Golem can slam its fists down onto the ground, directing\
  \ energy into the surface and causing it to ripple outward in all directions for\
  \ 15 feet. Any creature standing in the area takes 2d12+18 points of damage and\
  \ must succeed at a DC 38 Reflex save or be knocked prone. In addition, the ground\
  \ becomes buckled and smashed and is considered difficult terrain. The save DC is\
  \ Strength-based.\n     <br> <b>Sturdy Stride (Ex)</b> The Golem completely ignores\
  \ difficult terrain. \n     <br> <b>Sweeping Charge (Ex) </b>The Golem can charge\
  \ at a target even through squares occupied by other creatures of Large size or\
  \ smaller, battering them effortlessly aside. Any creature occupying a square on\
  \ the path toward the target must make a DC 38 Reflex save or be thrown 1d4x5 feet,\
  \ suffering 2d8+18 damage and knocked prone. This save DC is Strength-based. \n\
  \     <br> <b>Depthless Knowledge (Su)</b> As a full round action, the Golem can\
  \ capture the knowledge of any creature within 30 feet. When using this ability,\
  \ the Golem's eyes seem to swell, becoming deep, endless pools. The target must\
  \ succeed at a DC 29 Will save or become a mindless vegetable for 1d4 rounds, unable\
  \ to perform any action. During this time, the Golem can use any skill or feat possessed\
  \ by the victim as if it itself had the skill or feat, adding the victim's skill\
  \ ranks to its own if it already possesses them. In addition, the victim's BAB,\
  \ if higher, replaces the Golem's, and the Golem gains all of the victim's spells,\
  \ able to cast them without their requisite components (if any). Any such spells\
  \ used by the Golem are considered cast when the victim regains control of his senses.\
  \ The Golem can only capture the knowledge of one target at a time. Any creature\
  \ that succeeds at its Will save is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.\
  \ This save DC is Charisma-based.\n     <br> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>A traveler\
  \ from beyond the stars, this ageless being came to Earth during a time when vast,\
  \ steamy jungles and nameless, forgotten terrors crawled across the face of our\
  \ planet. A caretaker of lore and knowledge of both this world and of others, the\
  \ Golem has marched across the bones of countless epochs in an endless quest for\
  \ information, searching always for the unknowable, and questing eternally for the\
  \ unattainable. His midnight black body appears to be constructed of highly polished\
  \ iron, though the mysterious black metal is unknown to any Earthbound scientist.\
  \ Forged by hands long lost to the Universe, the Golem is the last of its kind.</p>\
  \ The Golem contains the powerful artifact known as the<i> Heart of Lore</i>, which\
  \ appears as a radiant ball of pure, crystalline energy that it keeps stored in\
  \ its broad, powerful chest. This item grants the Golem a +4 deflection bonus to\
  \ its Armor Class, fast healing 10, and 200 extra hit points. \n    <p></p> \n \
  \   <p><b>History</b></p> \n    <p> The Golem once slaved for its masters, a long-extinct\
  \ race of space travelers and explorers who, after eons of existence, catalogued\
  \ and explored much of our galaxy and even beyond, using a powerful blend of science\
  \ and magic to reach out to the far corners of existence. To help them acquire and\
  \ protect all of this collected knowledge, they constructed a potent servitor class,\
  \ a race of obedient constructs that hungered for knowledge and lore as much as\
  \ they.</p> But nothing withstands Time, and eventually the species began to fall\
  \ into extinction, and their servitors along with them. Until when at last only\
  \ the Golem remained, the remainder of the species bound their collected knowledge\
  \ into a powerful artifact—the<i> Heart of Lore</i>—and infused it within the Golem,\
  \ so that it would be forever the caretaker of their posterity. The Golem then set\
  \ out into the Universe, exploring countless worlds—Golarion among them—settling\
  \ for millennia at a time before finally moving on. Earth is but the latest stop\
  \ on its everlasting voyage.\n    <p></p> \n    <p><b>Habitat &amp; Society</b></p>\
  \ \n    <p> The Golem is driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge, though it\
  \ does occasionally stop for prolonged periods, allying itself with scholars and\
  \ artisans whom it finds worthy, and sharing with them the tales it has accumulated\
  \ over the course of its incredibly long and storied existence, so that they in\
  \ turn can share them with others—for it is not only the duty of the Golem to collect\
  \ knowledge and tales, but to ensure that they are never forgotten. However, the\
  \ Golem is very particular about with whom it chooses to share its knowledge, and\
  \ any attempt to acquire its information or possessions without its consent are\
  \ dealt with most severely. </p> \n    <p>Hank Woon<br> Editorial Intern</p> \n\
