  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Thaleon was born in the\
  \ deserts of Rahadoum, in a time before the sands had come to claim Manaket.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A member of the nomadic vourinoi, the elves of the desert, Thaleon was\
  \ born from two worlds: one parent a woman from the forested elven homeland of Kyonin,\
  \ the other a kala-shei elf who had always called the dunes their home. As a child,\
  \ Thaleon traveled from oasis to oasis, learning to appreciate the beauty of the\
  \ passing landscapes. He was taught to navigate by the stars and find safe water,\
  \ when to travel, and when to hide from the sun, but most of all, he was taught\
  \ of an ideal almost too abstract for his young mind to grasp—the quest for a moment\
  \ of clarity his people called the Brightness. Each described it differently—the\
  \ windsinger spoke of it as a pure note before dawn, the cook said it felt like\
  \ the first taste of a family meal—but their anecdotes had one thing in common:\
  \ to find his Brightness, Thaleon would need to wander the world and make his own\
  \ path.</p> \n     <p>While Thaleon was still a child, the vourinoi ventured to\
  \ the coastal city of Manaket, known for its lush gardens and academic learning,\
  \ to relay a warning. Through their wanderings, they had studied the subtler patterns\
  \ of climate and weather playing out over decades and centuries, more noticeable\
  \ over their elven lifespans. In these patterns, they’d seen a rapid spread of desertification\
  \ in Rahadoum, with long-verdant shelters now exposed to the desert’s wrath. Working\
  \ together over several years, the vourinoi and various Manaketi scholars predicted\
  \ a great storm of dust and sand would envelop the city, choking the sky and devastating\
  \ crops. Yet government officials wouldn’t take their warnings seriously; they were\
  \ too focused on shorter-term priorities to risk their popularity by proposing expensive\
  \ measures to prevent some potential future disaster.</p> \n     <p>While his parents\
  \ researched, Thaleon was thrilled to explore a new place filled with wildly different\
  \ peoples, though he chafed under Manaket’s rigid structure. Why should such a trifling\
  \ thing as a property line tell him he couldn't perch on a roof to enjoy the starlight?\
  \ Why would one leave an object in a common area if they didn't mean for anyone\
  \ to pick it up? Why would one hold an interesting conversation in a public place\
  \ if they wanted it to remain private? The boy was ever inquisitive and prone to\
  \ getting swept up in the moods of those around him, taking part in their enthusiasm\
  \ and wonder, as well as their frustration and pain.</p> \n     <table class=\"\

  \       </tr> \n      </tbody>\n     </table> \n     <p>Thaleon’s teachers were\
  \ quick to label him a problem child due to his tendency to break rules and encourage\
  \ classmates to do the same, as well as for the strange incidents that regularly\
  \ happened around him. Confiscated toys hovered back to his fingers as soon as a\
  \ teacher’s back was turned. Distracting sounds would fill the room during boring\
  \ lessons. While unfamiliar to Thaleon’s vourinoi family, his Rahadoumi teachers\
  \ were well acquainted with psychic power, given the country’s tradition of magic\
  \ that sprung from mortal will. Though his instructors thought it best to place\
  \ Thaleon in a strict, isolated program to discipline his mind and powers, Thaleon’\
  s parents realized the boy was too free-spirited to flourish in a regimented Rahadoumi\
  \ classroom. Instead, they set challenges for their son to channel his energy. Find\
  \ the fastest way from the city gate to the fountain. Detail the journey of a fish\
  \ from egg to stewpot. Lure a scorpion into a trap without getting stung. Capture\
  \ a mirage in bluest ink. This last challenge sung the most to Thaleon’s heart,\
  \ and the boy quickly took up painting, his portraits filled with vibrant colors\
  \ and complex expressions that always managed to capture a subject’s deeper feelings,\
  \ even ones they had only hinted at aloud.</p> \n     <p>One sunset, while Thaleon\
  \ was putting the finishing touches on a portrait of a fruit seller, he felt oddly\
  \ tense, his brush quavering in his hand. As tension deepened into apprehension,\
  \ then fear, he realized the emotion wasn’t his own. The people in the marketplace\
  \ turned eastward, staring at an unfamiliar cloud on the horizon, one that rushed\
  \ toward them with unnerving speed. Street dogs howled and birds fell silent. Thaleon\
  \ knew instantly what it was. The long-predicted storm, come at last.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Drawing a scarf over his mouth, he tried to direct the crowd to safety, but\
  \ his voice couldn’t rise above the panic, a thousand scrawls of stark white closing\
  \ in from every direction. The desire to protect the crowd grew in Thaleon’s mind\
  \ until it finally spilled forth, unleashing itself in a flash of color. For the\
  \ first time, Thaleon painted with his mind instead of his brush, and soothing lights\
  \ flickered into existence, drawing attention away from the storm for a few critical\
  \ moments. In the momentary calm, Thaleon’s voice had a chance to carry as he directed\
  \ the market indoors and underground.</p> \n     <p>To Thaleon’s relief, the crowd\
  \ took shelter, yet the merchant he’d been painting remained frozen in place as\
  \ the storm approached. The canopy of his stall snapped, sending a heavy beam of\
  \ wood straight for his head. In that moment, Thaleon felt only one emotion: the\
  \ desire to protect his friend. As he dashed to the merchant’s side, colors wove\
  \ together into a dome of telekinetic force, covering them both. The debris crashed\
  \ against it just as the storm descended. Sand and wind raged, but the barrier held,\
  \ and in the swirling reds, blues, and yellows, for the briefest second, Thaleon\
  \ glimpsed a color he’d never seen before, one he couldn’t describe… but he knew\
  \ it was bright.</p> \n     <p>On that day, Thaleon’s power became more than a source\
  \ of entertainment and whimsy. It became a way for him to make the world a better\
  \ place. A century has passed since the day Manaket’s gardens withered in the sandstorm,\
  \ but the spark of Thaleon’s curiosity and his desire to help others hasn’t diminished.\
  \ Like his parents before him, Thaleon left home to wander the world in search of\
  \ his Brightness, determined to make his own path.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
