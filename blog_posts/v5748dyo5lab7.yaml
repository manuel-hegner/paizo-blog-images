  \ L. Sutter (Part 1)</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, May 18, 2009</p> \n   <p>Paizo's\
  \ Appendix N returns! Now that the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8255\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook</i></a> is out the door, things at the Paizo office have become\
  \ just a little bit less hectic. Seizing the lull in the workload, Editor James\
  \ L. Sutter generously took the time Friday morning to speak with me about his most\
  \ important sources of inspiration. Just as James Jacobs's love of horror in literature\
  \ and film differed greatly from Erik Mona's unquenchable thirst for pulp novels,\
  \ Mr. Sutter's influences are unique within the office. Read on to find out the\
  \ fantasy authors that most influenced James's game design, and learn why he enjoys\
  \ mixing the peanut butter of science fiction with the chocolate of fantasy.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>David</b>: As the creator of Kaer-Maga, the notorious den of thieves,\
  \ and the person most responsible for envisioning Golarion's solar system, it is\
  \ clear that your influences are pretty diverse. What are your biggest sources of\
  \ inspiration when creating the world of Pathfinder?</p> \n   <p><b>James</b>: As\
  \ far as fantasy authors go, I'd have to say that my biggest influences are China\
  \ Miéville, Joel Rosenberg, and Richard Knaak. I really enjoyed Miéville's vision\
  \ of a fantasy world—it's not steampunk, but more like industrial revolution fantasy.\
  \ I was particularly inspired by <i>Perdido Street Station</i>, and how he seamlessly\
  \ blended a mishmash of cultures and created a believable and vibrant city. In fact,\
  \ New Crobuzon served as the primary influence for Kaer-Maga, the city I created\
  \ for the module <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy7zke\">Seven Swords\
  \ of Sin</a>; it's a city of outcasts that have come together, a place where a lot\
  \ of different cultures all intermingle but still manage to work.</p> \n   <p>Among\
  \ other books, Joel Rosenberg wrote the \"Guardians of the Flame\" series, in which\
  \ the main characters are literally pulled into the game world of the RPG they're\
  \ playing. Those books were my first introduction to the concept of roleplaying,\
  \ and as a result the world created by Rosenberg is pretty much the archetypal setting\
  \ I envision for fantasy roleplaying games. Richard Knaak's \"Dragonrealms\" series\
  \ was also very inspirational for me early on, as <i>The Crystal Dragon</i> was\
  \ the first adult fantasy I picked up (mainly because it had a shiny holographic\
  \ dragon on the cover).</p> \n   <p>More than fantasy, though, I'm primarily influenced\
  \ by science and science fiction—possibly more so than anyone else at the Paizo.\
  \ I think I've learned more about world building from Dan Simmons than any other\
  \ author. I especially like blending magic and science, the line where one transitions\
  \ into the other. When we were first creating Pathfinder, James Jacobs handed me\
  \ a mostly blank outline for Varisia and told me to run with it. At first I included\
  \ a lot more science fiction elements; Crystilian was originally the magical equivalent\
  \ of a particle accelerator, Spindlehorn an ancient space elevator used by long-lost\
  \ astronauts, and Mundatei was basically a forest of Tesla coils. We ended up working\
  \ together to change most of that, which was of course the right decision, but some\
  \ science fiction elements were still retained—Ember Lake, for instance, essentially\
  \ functions as the place in Varisia where UFO sightings occur, with its phosphorescent,\
  \ underwater bugs that form strange patterns which can only be seen from the sky.</p>\
  \ \n   <br> \n   <p>This concludes Part 1 or my interview with James Sutter about\
  \ the sources of inspiration he would include in Paizo's own Appendix N. Stay tuned\
  \ for Part 2, where he discusses how hard science and science fiction continue to\
  \ influence his fantasy game design, and explains how the nation code-named \"Dragon\
  \ Hitler\" would eventually become the island of Hermea.</p> \n   <p>David Eitelbach<br>\
