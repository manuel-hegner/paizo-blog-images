  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, December 21, 2010</p> \n   <p>Have you ever wanted\
  \ to be a published professional game designer? We're two weeks into Round 1 of\
  \ this year's <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/previous/2011\">RPG Superstar 2011 competition</a>\
  \ and have less than two weeks to go, so you still have a chance!</p> \n   <p>Judges\
  \ Ryan Dancey, Mark Moreland, Neil Spicer, and myself have waded through hundreds\
  \ of item submissions so far, with the expectations of hundreds more, and overall\
  \ we're very impressed with the quality level of this year's wondrous items! Normally\
  \ it takes us to the end of the Round 1 submission period to get enough cool wondrous\
  \ items to build a strong Top 32, but we already have over <b>40</b> items in the\
  \ \"keeper\" pile.</p> \n   <p>But don't take that as a sign that you shouldn't\
  \ participate! We're going to continue adding good submissions to the pile, and\
  \ only when the submission deadline has passed are we going to whittle those down\
  \ to just the Top 32. So warm yourself by the fireplace, have some eggnog (or your\
  \ favorite winter beverage), design a new wondrous item, and submit it using the\
  \ above RPG Superstar link!</p> \n   <p>The deadline for submitting your wondrous\
  \ item is <b>December 31, 2010</b>, at 2 p.m. Pacific Time. And be sure to check\
  \ the sticky post in the RPG Superstar message board listing <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/rpgsuperstar/previous/2011/general/wondrousItemAutoRejectAdvice\"\
  >a lot of advice about designing a wondrous item for the competition</a>, and be\
  \ sure to check out some of the helpful links in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lbmz\"\
  >this November blog post</a>.</p> \n   <p>Do you want to sit around eating your\
  \ \"sad ice cream\" and moping that you never submitted an item to RPG Superstar\
  \ 2011? Or do you want to do victory laps around your gaming table, holding a Paizo-published\
  \ module with your name on the cover? The only way you can win RPG Superstar is\
  \ if you submit a wondrous item in Round 1!</p> \n   <p>(Next week, we'll give you\
  \ a sneak peek at the Round 2 challenge!)</p> \n   <p>Sean K Reynolds <br>Developer,\
  \ RPG Superstar Judge</p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: RPG Superstar --> \n </div>\
