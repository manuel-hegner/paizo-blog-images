  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi there! I'm Ryan Rucinski, producer\
  \ of <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Adventures</a>,\
  \ the digital version of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, and we are happy to\
  \ announce that Pathfinder Adventures is now available for Windows and macOS!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Additionally, there is a rather large update to the existing iOS and\
  \ Android versions that includes all the updates we have been working on in conjunction\
  \ with the Windows/macOS release.</p> \n    <p>Enjoy!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5Hj55clG70\"\
  \ frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div> \n    <p>That's right,\
  \ we've brought the digital version of Pathfinder Adventures to Windows and macOS...\
  \ but what does that <i>mean</i>?</p> \n    <p><b>Windows &amp; macOS</b>: The interface\
  \ has been modified for the desktop. This was no small feat. If we had released\
  \ a straight port of the mobile version, we would have been flambéed. The team added\
  \ hotkeys, scrollbars, and scroll wheel support. It's available now on <a href=\"\
  http://store.steampowered.com/app/480640/Pathfinder_Adventures\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Steam</a>, and you'll soon be able to purchase it on GoG and the Mac App Store.\
  \ (Of course, you can still buy the mobile version on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.obsidian.pacg1\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Google Play</a> and Apple's <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pathfinder-adventures/id966333863?mt=8\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">App Store</a>.)</p> \n    <p>The pricing for the Windows/macOS\
  \ versions differs from the mobile versions because we don't use in-game purchases.\
  \ The base version of the desktop game includes the complete Rise of the Runelords\
  \ content—all the cards and scenarios that were in the original mobile Rise of the\
  \ Runelords bundle, plus all the uncommon and rare treasure cards. Two additional\
  \ DLC packages are available: one with all the iconic alts and some legendary dice,\
  \ and the other with the rare epic and legendary treasure cards and other legendary\
  \ dice.</p> \n    <p>An Obsidian Edition is also available; it includes everything\
  \ in the base version, plus the two DLC packages, and three promo cards (two of\
  \ which are Edér and Pallegina from Pillars of Eternity—yeah!), as well as three\
  \ legendary items and a bunch of runes, charms, and gold, and another DLC pack that\
  \ will be available in the near future.</p> \n    <p>We plan on keeping content\
  \ parity between all platforms in the future, meaning that new content will become\
  \ available for Windows, macOS, and mobile users at the same time.</p> \n    <p>We\
  \ also tackled some of the interfaces that people had issues with, including the\
  \ Party Creation and Character Selection screens. While the implementation we had\
  \ was functional, it wasn't making a very good impression on newer users, and was\
  \ merely tolerated by current players. We've come up with a more streamlined process,\
  \ reflected on all platforms.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-Party.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-Party_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Account Merging</b>: All platforms can use a single\
  \ PlayFab account, meaning that all of the content and your progression in the game\
  \ can be shared between them.</p> \n    <p>It used to be kind rough if a user spent\
  \ a lot of time on one platform: When they moved to another, they would have to\
  \ start from scratch, or contact our support team. It was doubly rough if they had\
  \ unlocked a lot of content on each platform. We say, no more! One account, all\
  \ platforms!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-Merging.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-Merging_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>The Stash</b>: In our faithfulness to the original\
  \ card game, we had the exact same valid deck check in the digital version. But\
  \ that didn't work so great after we expanded the content with treasure cards (which\
  \ can be ignored in Story Mode for those who want to mirror the tabletop experience).\
  \ When you opened a treasure chest, you didn't actually get to use its treasure\
  \ cards immediately—you just got the chance to find these cards in your adventures.\
  \ Unless you were really familiar with the system, it was a hard concept to grasp.\
  \ So we created the Stash, which can hold a selection of cards that you're not currently\
  \ using in your decks. This means you can now keep some of the more specialized\
  \ cards that you're not quite ready to use. And when you open a treasure chest,\
  \ a copy of each treasure card is sent to the Stash for immediate use. This will\
  \ hopefully make opening treasure chests more gratifying.</p> \n    <p>The Stash\
  \ also helps alleviate the need for \"mule\" characters—characters that people created\
  \ solely to store some of the cards that people wanted to keep, but didn't want\
  \ to use just yet. Plus, it's just a bit more intuitive for the digital-verse.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Stash is set at 10 slots right now and includes an Unclaimed tab.\
  \ Unclaimed cards cannot be used by any characters until they are officially moved\
  \ to the Stash. You can open up a hundred chests, and all the new cards will be\
  \ waiting for you in the Unclaimed tab.</p> \n    <p>If you happen to go over your\
  \ Stash limit, you will meet a happy vendor who will give you gold for your unwanted\
  \ cards.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-Stash.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-Stash_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Charms and Runes</b>: Ever have that roll you really,\
  \ really needed to succeed at, lest your permadeath character bite it? Or maybe\
  \ you're a turn or two away from kicking Ghlorofaex to the curb, but the blessings\
  \ deck is on empty? We might just have the charm you are looking for.</p> \n   \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-Charms.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-Charms_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Charms are one-time-use consumables that have an immediate\
  \ effect on your current action. They vary from adding a bonus to a check to adding\
  \ a card to the blessings deck. They have a gold cost associated with their power:\
  \ adding an extra d4 to a roll might cost only 50 gold, while adding to the blessings\
  \ deck would run you 500 gold.</p> \n    <p>Runes differ from Charms in that they\
  \ have a time limit associated with them; they almost act like a pseudo scenario\
  \ power. The Rune of Wealth doubles your gold acquisition while it's in effect,\
  \ while the Rune of Shielding will reduce damage by 1 for four hours.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>These will be available in the store and during play for in-game gold (though\
  \ runes have to be set up prior to starting a scenario).</p> \n    <p><b>Tutorial</b>:\
  \ The tutorial was previously required when starting the game, and a good three-quarters\
  \ of the people who were forced to play it were never seen playing our game again.\
  \ No kidding.</p> \n    <p>The tutorial is now 100% more skippable. Yes, that's\
  \ right, if you don't want to play the tutorial, or your are already familiar with\
  \ the game, we have a skip button that is just right for you.</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ new super-rad version of the tutorial is also cut up into five bite-sized scenarios\
  \ that each teach specific elements of the game in a clear and concise way. You'll\
  \ even get special rewards for completing all of them. (And we don't consider just\
  \ being allowed to play the beginning scenario a reward.)</p> \n    <p><b>Other\
  \ Stuff</b>: Our dice really are random!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-DiceOdds.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170622-DiceOdds_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>See that? We're now showing you your chance of success\
  \ at each check. Sure, I still sometimes fail checks where I have a 97% chance of\
  \ succeeding, but at least I no longer go confidently into situations where a 20%\
  \ chance is glaring at me.</p> \n    <p>It's a minor feature but it really does\
  \ make your decisions a little more clear: you can really see that one additional\
  \ d4 that Lini can throw in is actually a huge improvement.</p> \n    <p>These are\
  \ just some of the things we have been working on—expect to hear more announcements\
  \ in the near future!</p> \n    <p>Thanks for taking the time to read my ramblings,\
  \ and happy adventuring!</p> \n    <p>Cheers!</p> \n    <p>Ryan Rucinski<br> <i>Producer,\
  \ Pathfinder Adventures<br> Obsidian Entertainment</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
