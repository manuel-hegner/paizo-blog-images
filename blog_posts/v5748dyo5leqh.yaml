  \ of fiction set in the Pathfinder campaign setting have likely noticed that it's\
  \ been a few months since we released a Pathfinder Society Chronicle sheet for the\
  \ novels released as part of this line. For those who have been holding their breath\
  \ to get an in-character benefit for reading <a href=\"/products/btpy8x1j\"><i>Liar's\
  \ Blade</i></a> or <a href=\"/products/btpy8xc7\"><i>Pirate's Honor</i></a>, the\
  \ wait is finally over! With the release of today's Chronicle sheet, we're changing\
  \ up the way Pathfinder Tales boons work.</span></p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \   <br> Illustrations by Eric Belisle\n     </div> \n     <p>This Chronicle sheet\
  \ is actually a Chronicle sheet for four different Pathfinder Tales titles: <i>Liar's\
  \ Blade</i>, <i>Pirate's Honor</i>, <i>The Wizard's Mask</i>, and <i>King of Chaos</i>.\
  \ Now, back when we began sanctioning Pathfinder Tales novels for Pathfinder Society\
  \ credit during Season 2, a player received a Chronicle sheet for each Pathfinder\
  \ Tales book he brought to a Pathfinder Society game, which was subsequently signed\
  \ by a GM and applied to one of the player's PCs. Now, a player needs print this\
  \ Chronicle sheet only once, and bring it to a sanctioned Pathfinder Society event\
  \ along with a printed or digital copy of one or more of the four novels included\
  \ on the sheet (digital copies must be legally obtained and possess a watermark\
  \ indicating such). The GM should initial the Chronicle sheet for the associated\
  \ books, indicating that the player has access to the book, and hopefully that she\
  \ has read it.</p> \n     <p>Any time thereafter, the player may use the initialed\
  \ boon for any of her PCs. Once used, the box to the left of the boon should be\
  \ checked to indicate such.</p> \n     <p>A player who collects GM initials for\
  \ all four books on a given Chronicle sheet can select one of the four boons to\
  \ become a permanent bonus for one of her PCs. At this time, only that PC can use\
  \ the boon, though any unused one-time boons still on the sheet can still be used\
  \ by other PCs.</p> \n     <p>You may note that this Chronicle sheet is called \"\
  Pathfinder Tales, Volume IV.\" That's because it contains the boons for the fourth\
  \ distinct set of four Pathfinder Tales novels. In the coming months, we'll be replacing\
  \ the existing Chronicle sheets for the entire Pathfinder Tales line to utilize\
  \ this format, and anyone who's already received initialed versions of the Chronicle\
  \ sheets for <a href=\"/products/btpy8u7i\"><i>Queen of Thorns</i></a>, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8kc4\"><i>The Worldwound Gambit</i></a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy8oda\"\
  ><i>Death's Heretic</i></a> (all 12 of them, in fact), can get an initial in the\
  \ associated box on the compiled Chronicle sheet.</p> \n     <p>As if that weren't\
  \ enough, we also plan to tie in at least one scenario per season to each novel\
  \ released during that season. It's too late in the process to do so for these four\
  \ books, but starting with <a href=\"/products/btpy8you\"><i>Stalking the Beast</i></a>\
  \ in October, we'll have a scenario set in the same region as every new Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novel, or otherwise thematically linked to them if not set in the same geographical\
  \ area. This will allow us to tailor the boons on the Chronicle sheets to directly\
  \ apply to a situation one of the reader's PCs may be in around the time they're\
  \ reading the book.</p> \n     <p>So download the Pathfinder Tales Chronicle sheet\
  \ below and grab your copy of <i>Liar's Blade</i> or <i>Pirate's Honor</i>. In the\
  \ coming months, you'll be able to \"fill your BINGO card\" with the release of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8wbz\"><i>The Wizard's Mask</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8j\"\
  ><i>King of Chaos</i></a>. It's never too late to sign up for a Pathfinder Tales\
  \ subscription so you never miss a volume of the exciting fiction line!</p> \n \
  \    <p>Let us know what you think of the new format for these tie-in Chronicle\
  \ sheets and the prospect of directly-linked Pathfinder Society scenarios down the\
  \ road. We're always looking for community feedback and for new ways to improve\
  \ the campaign.</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"/download/pathfinder/PZO8500-BoonsVol4.zip\"\
