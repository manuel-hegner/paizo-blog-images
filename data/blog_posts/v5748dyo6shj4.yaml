  \ primary inhabitants of the three moons of Hadrogess—a desolate world in the Vast—\
  \ Hadrogaans once lived on the planet itself, millennia ago. They possess knowledge\
  \ of their life on Hadrogess’s surface, and their departure from it, that date back\
  \ to before the Gap, but even so, much of that history has been lost. Obsessive\
  \ historians have reconstructed pieces of their history, but uncertainties and inconsistencies\
  \ still plague the field.</p> \n       <p>All hadrogaans know for sure is that some\
  \ catastrophe caused the planet’s atmosphere to begin slowly leaking into space.\
  \ Faced with extinction, they scrambled for a possible solution. Following a series\
  \ of frantic and unsanctioned experiments, a team of fringe scientists discovered\
  \ a sapient crystal that grew deep beneath the planet’s crust, one that could merge\
  \ with a hadrogaan body in a process that—in most cases— led to greater intellect\
  \ and insight. These scientists claimed that the crystalline organisms, collectively\
  \ called kallestrine, not only willingly participated in these experiments, but\
  \ that they had sent psychic signals to the scientists—leading the latter to discover\
  \ them—and had even proposed merging the entire hadrogaan species with kallestrine.\
  \ Successful merging caused a rapid processing-power expansion that many felt could\
  \ propel the two organisms into a new era of enlightenment, and in fact, many hadrogaans\
  \ saw this way as their only hope for salvation.</p> \n       <p>Modern hadrogaans\
  \ know that most of their people accepted the merging and somehow found a way—before\
  \ the advent of starships—to settle their planet’s three moons. In their new symbiotic\
  \ forms, hadrogaans formed a society dedicated to science, philosophy, progress,\
  \ and utilitarianism in all matters. Their advancements positioned them to embrace\
  \ Drift travel soon after receiving Triune’s signal, and whenever possible, hadrogaans\
  \ seek positive relations with alien life—but should peace talks fail, they have\
  \ no qualms with swift and efficient military solutions.</p> \n       <p>Most hadrogaans\
  \ stand at about 8 feet tall with long limbs, thin bodies, and elongated fingers.\
  \ Large hollows perforate their torsos, limbs, and sometimes their necks and faces,\
  \ each filled with glimmering crystals—the organism that hadrogaans merged with\
  \ during the Gap. The merging altered the species’ genetic makeup, and hadrogaan\
  \ children are born with these crystalline hollows, which can grow and shift over\
  \ time.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>Hadrogaan racial traits include Dual\
  \ Nervous Systems and Hadrogaan Senses: The crystals in a hadrogaan’s body can sense\
  \ subtle vibrations in the environment. A hadrogaan has blindsense.</p> \n     \

  \     <p>A massive species of spaceborne plants inhabits the rocky rings of gas\
  \ giants throughout the galaxy. Known to Pact Worlds scientists as greater ring\
  \ roots, these creatures resemble immense, hirsute tubers bristling with gnarled\
  \ tendrils and alien eyes. However, countless tragedies since the Gap have earned\
  \ the infamous plant its more common name: the shipkiller bulb.</p> \n       <p>GRAVITY\
  \ GRENADE: Level 2-12<br> Derived from the gravitational organs of shipkiller bulbs,\
  \ gravity grenades generate a micro-singularity that pulls affected targets towards\
  \ the detonation point. Creatures in the area move the listed distance toward the\
  \ blast’s center if they fail a Fortitude saving throw. Unsecured, unattended items\
  \ of 1 bulk or less automatically fail this save. The force is not powerful enough\
  \ to move bigger objects, such as Large vehicles.</p> \n       <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ <!-- <br clear=\"all\"/> --> \n       <p>Despite being large, bipedal creatures,\
  \ thermatrods use a knuckle-walking quadrupedal gait resembling a gorilla’s stride,\
  \ though they occasionally stand on their back legs or use their arms to climb.\
  \ </p> \n       <p><b>MAGMA SLEDGE</b><br> Inspired by the red-hot stony body of\
  \ a thermatrod, magma sledges are the larger cousins of the more agile magma blades\
  \ (Starfinder Armory 38). At first glance, a magma sledge seems like an analog weapon\
  \ with a steel shaft and a head of solid stone. However, when the weapon powers\
  \ on, cracks form along the surface show the magma hidden within, held in place\
  \ with powerful magnetic fields. When slammed into a target, the intense heat and\
  \ force can send even the most powerful opponents reeling. Factory floors that mass\
  \ produce magma sledges are often swelteringly hot.</p> \n       <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Some of the most intrepid hunters seek out ursikkas—and wily scavengers often\
  \ search the tundra for fallen ursikka bodies—to harvest their hides. Ursikka hides\
  \ are light, supple, and have an insulating quality that traps body heat, making\
  \ them an ideal material for cold weather gear and clothes. Talented armorsmiths\
  \ can create flexible light armor from this leather, which grants cold resistance\
  \ in addition to the benefits listed on the table below. Basic ursikka hide armor\
  \ provides cold resistance 10, and the resistance increases to 15 and 20 for advanced\
  \ and elite suits respectively.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>The <em>Alien\
