  >Wednesday, October 28, 2009</p> \n   <p>During my first week, I was surprised to\
  \ find there is a significant lack of chaotic evil in the office. I was not whipped\
  \ by a winged baboon-devil while organizing the archive, and I am given free coffee\
  \ that I did not have to make myself. I was expecting that Matt and I would be told\
  \ early on to \"prove our worth\" by enduring psychological torture or some bloody\
  \ nonsense, but so far I have not had to pull my sawtooth sabre from where it is\
  \ taped beneath my desk and pounce on him like an unsuspecting puppy with a remote-activated\
  \ bomb collar. Though we are treated well, our nametags haven't arrived yet, and\
  \ my Paizo-embroidered handkerchief scratches my nose a bit.</p> \n   <p>Well, we\
  \ are on to introductions, children of Zo; I am Editorial Intern Tyler. I dwell\
  \ in a cubicle with Editorial Intern Matt. He's quite nice, and sometimes I actually\
  \ believe that we are not plotting each other's deaths via falling gargoyles and\
  \ sabotaged car engines. Even though we don't actually have a bloody rivalry, I\
  \ am still generally a happy person. I like half-orcs and barbarians, though I occasionally\
  \ dabble in sorcery and the bluff skill. There are times I lie awake in bed having\
  \ elaborate fantasies about being John Connor. I'm friendly to all woodland animals\
  \ as long as they're cute and more than ten feet away. I don't know much about cars.\
  \ I eat at Subway too much. I like Lady Gaga because she is a classy lady and could\
  \ be a villain from Cheliax. In addition, I like to talk about myself (to myself),\
  \ whine too much to family members, and I'm famous for once telling a story that,\
  \ in its entirety, lasted 4 hours.</p> \n   <p>I'm somewhat new to the Paizo family,\
  \ but so far this internship has been really fun. Hopefully I'll get to know some\
  \ of you on good terms, and the rest won't hate me enough to complain.</p> \n  \
