  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With less than two weeks to go until the launch\
  \ of Starfinder, the excitement around here has reached a fever pitch! In the past\
  \ few months, we've shown off all the new races and classes, introduced you to iconic\
  \ characters and new rules systems, and more. Yet as excited as we are for all the\
  \ new stuff, we're just as excited to show you some very familiar things...</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While Starfinder has its own \"core races\"—humans, lashuntas, kasathas,\
  \ androids, vesk, ysoki, and shirrens—that doesn't mean we've forgotten about Pathfinder's\
  \ core races. After all, what would Golarion's solar system be without elves and\
  \ dwarves, or gnomes and halfings? That's why the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> has the Pathfinder Legacy chapter, in which\
  \ it presents—among other useful information—complete racial stats for all of Pathfinder's\
  \ core races, as well as updated details describing the races and how they fit into\
  \ the vast ecosystem of the Pact Worlds. So while we aren't going to spoil the surprise\
  \ and list all of their racial abilities or cultural details, here's a taste of\
  \ what Pathfinder's core races look like in Starfinder!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ by Hugh Pindur</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>Dwarves</h3> \n     <p class=\"\
  collapse\"><b>+2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Cha<br> Hit Points: 6</b></p> \n     <p>Dwarves\
  \ in Starfinder still feel a keen connection to lost Golarion. They're most commonly\
  \ found on Absalom Station or cruising through the void on their city-sized Star\
  \ Citadel ships. Many of them are heavily involved in asteroid mining in the Diaspora,\
  \ while others explore far from the Pact Worlds in what they believe is a second\
  \ stage of the legendary Quest for Sky that led them to Golarion's surface. Of course,\
  \ these traditional spiritual beliefs have been dealt something of a blow by the\
  \ fact that Torag went missing during the Gap...</p> \n     <h3>Elves</h3> \n  \
  \   <p class=\"collapse\"><b>+2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Con<br> Hit Points: 4</b></p> \n\
  \     <p>Elves in Starfinder were hit hardest of all the Pathfinder legacy races\
  \ by the Gap, as they proved slower to adapt and recover than shorter-lived races.\
  \ After all, many modern elves were already alive when the Gap ended, and thus still\
  \ have large holes in their memories where those early centuries have been burned\
  \ away. What's more, their leaders have long since concluded that their race was\
  \ betrayed during that mysterious period—they just don't know by whom. All of this\
  \ has led many elves to retreat to Sovyrian on Castrovel, or restrict themselves\
  \ to all-elven settlements or crews, their government diplomats even going so far\
  \ as to wear masks when forced to interact with other races. Pushing back hard against\
  \ this isolationism is the steadily growing cohort of elves called Forlorn, who\
  \ choose to live among other races. Yet regardless of cultural group, whether at\
  \ home or abroad, many elves gravitate toward magic, seeing in its practice a connection\
  \ to their ancestors.</p> \n     <h3>Gnomes</h3> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><b>+2\
  \ Con, -2 Str, +2 Cha (feychild) or +2 Int (bleachling)<br> Hit Points: 4</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>In the age of Starfinder, gnomes have split into two distinct groups.\
  \ Thos called the feychildren remain much the same as they were in Pathfinder: brightly\
  \ colored, whimsical, otherworldly, and occasionally bizarre in the pursuit of their\
  \ passions. Bleachlings, on the other hand, are a subrace of gnomes who split away\
  \ from others when—through freak mutation or deliberate genetic editing—they somehow\
  \ survived the Bleaching that still plagues feychildren. As a result of this racial\
  \ split, its details shrouded by the Gap, bleachlings are more even-tempered than\
  \ their mischievous cousins, highly intellectual and able to sate their search for\
  \ novelty with purely intellectual pursuits. While researchers have yet to isolate\
  \ exactly what protects bleachlings from their kindred's dangerous racial disease,\
  \ this immunity breeds true, and so their minority is slowly growing in gnome communities.</p>\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Hugh Pindur</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>Half-Elves</h3>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><b>+2 to any one ability score<br> Hit Points: 4</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Half-elves place in the setting has changed little over the millennia.\
  \ Thanks to Sovyrian's Blood Right policy, they're welcome to live among their full-blooded\
  \ kin, and account for much of that nation's trade with other races, yet plenty\
  \ of half-elves feel stifled by their traditionalist relations. Many can be found\
  \ operating as traders or homesteaders across the galaxy, with recent half-elven\
  \ settlements including new townships springing up just outside of Verces's terminator\
  \ region, or on the tropical colony world of Shanavan.</p> \n     <h3>Half-Orcs</h3>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><b>+2 to any one ability score<br> Hit Points: 6</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>While full-blood orcs are rare in the Pact Worlds, found primarily on\
  \ drow-controlled Apostae, half-orcs are significantly more common, nearly always\
  \ the children of other half-orcs. Sadly, not even the Gap could completely stamp\
  \ out traditional prejudice against their people, and other races still often regard\
  \ half-orcs as brutes, best suited to criminal or mercenary work. How the half-orcs\
  \ respond to this varies. Some \"steelskins\" reject conventional society and seek\
  \ to set themselves even farther apart from the mainstream with extensive cybernetics\
  \ or other body modifications. Others decide to push beyond the established boundaries\
  \ of civilization and found new colonies. While some of these colonists are content\
  \ to settle permanently, others are professional pioneers, forming companies that\
  \ land on new worlds as first-wave colonists, enduring the most dangerous and difficult\
  \ period of a colony's founding, then selling off their land rights to \"softer\"\
  \ colonists and starting fresh on a new world. In this fashion, some of the roughest\
  \ and toughest half-orcs are also some of the wealthiest individuals in the Pact\
  \ Worlds, acting as venture capitalists and patrons investing in other half-orc\
  \ adventurers.</p> \n     <h3>Halflings</h3> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><b>+2\
  \ Dex, +2 Cha, -2 Str<br> Hit Points: 2</b></p> \n     <p>Like gnomes, halflings\
  \ have gotten faster in Starfinder—no more speed penalty just for being short! Add\
  \ in their natural luck, keen senses, and stealth, and they make superb operatives,\
  \ though many are also charming envoys or pilots in their wandering caravan fleets.\
  \ While the public image of halflings as athletes and celebrity daredevils may not\
  \ perfectly describe the average homebody halfling, their cheerful, even tempers\
  \ in the face of danger can turn even a workaday halfling into a hero when circumstances\
  \ demand it. Of all the common races, halflings are perhaps the least likely to\
  \ use obvious cybernetic or biotech augmentations, generally feeling that halfling\
  \ physiology is pretty much perfect as it is.</p> \n     <p>James L. Sutter<br>\
