  ></a> \n      </div> \n      <p>We had made it to the finals—the Super Bowl of Giantslayer—\
  and we all felt it. We fully expected a hard adventure, and author Tito Leati delivered.\
  \ Emotions soared when we began preparation for the final marathon of this 6-month\
  \ gaming odyssey of our lives. We did what we could to look for some icing on the\
  \ endeavor when it came to immersing ourselves in the Storm Tyrant's cloud castle.\
  \ To start, we tapped into smell this time by using some <a href=\"http://adventurescents.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Adventure Scents</a> entitled \"Flying Airship.\" We also couldn't\
  \ resist breaking out two fog machines for the long climb through the clouds. To\
  \ go further, one of our members constructed a unique lamp that simulated some of\
  \ the bizarre lighting we encountered in the castle. Lastly, we even received some\
  \ mid-marathon support from one of our fans in the form of an Edible Arrangements!\

  ></a> \n      </div> \n      <h2>Highlights From our Experience With \"Shadow of\
  \ the Storm Tyrant\"</h2> \n      <ul> \n       <li>Boarding the castle almost didn't\
  \ happen: the party was left dangling from massive chains as the ground kept getting\
  \ further and further away—and then the guardians launched their attack.</li> \n\
  \       <li>An epic feel was captured perfectly in this adventure, as we squared\
  \ off against more colossal and gargantuan foes than any other module we have played.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>We worked our way through chamber after chamber of the biggest cloud\
  \ castle we could ever have hoped for. A 15-foot scale? Thank you Paizo!</li> \n\
  \      </ul> \n      <h2>How it Ended</h2> \n      <p>Despite our best efforts,\
  \ our clash with Volstus the Storm Tyrant went downhill fast. We employed a <em>haste</em>\
  \ spell and rushed him, only to watch the giant leap onto the back of his gargantuan\
  \ red dragon and take to the air. We attempted to engage, but the tyrant/dragon\
  \ combination was too overwhelming, and two rounds later we were beating a retreat\
  \ into an adjoining tower. It was decided that we would regroup by running down\
  \ the stairs into the levels below. Eventually we ran into Liniratis, the naga companion\
  \ of Volstus, who helped convince our party of where our true allegiance lay. When\
  \ it was over, Crowe and Quinn were dead, Zadim and Oloch were in service to the\
  \ Storm Tyrant, and Jagrin Grath remained hidden inside Ironcloud Keep. Only Thoon\
  \ the doppleganger escaped. TPK? Pretty much.</p> \n      <h2>Character Deaths</h2>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li>After a timely <em>wall of force</em> by the naga sorcerer,\
  \ Crowe found himself facing this wicked foe alone. The Shoanti chased her around\
  \ the chamber, only to watch the serpent disappear into one of many wicker baskets\
  \ and reappear in another. While the bloodrager turned his focus to destroying the\
  \ baskets, the naga proceeded to rain down 6 maximized <em>fireballs</em> in a row.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Zadim stared deep into the naga's eyes. Yes, it was all so clear\
  \ to him now: his slayer talents were best used for the giants, not against them.\
  \ He turned to face Quinn the investigator, who had been his companion. Quinn the\
  \ untrustworthy. Quinn the enemy. With six swift attacks from the slayer's kukris—\
  including 3 critical hits—Zadim put the traitor down.</li> \n      </ul> \n    \
  \  <h2>Best Quote From Marathon 6</h2> \n      <p><strong>Mike (playing Quinn)</strong>:\
  \ \"This is what I was born to do.\" (about to disarm the most enormous bomb we\
  \ had ever seen)</p> \n      <h2>The Giantslayer Adventure Path by the Numbers</h2>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li>Giants slain: 133</li> \n       <li>Total marathon hours:\
  \ 464 hours, 5 minutes</li> \n       <li>Actual session hours played: 292 hours,\

  \ months passed: 6</li> \n       <li>Days passed on Golarion: 233</li> \n      \
  \ <li>Character deaths: 16</li> \n       <li>Most amount of damage in a single round:\

  \ Starbucks per marathon: unknown</li> \n      </ul> \n      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>Certain problems plagued our team throughout the early parts of the\
  \ AP, and those same things came back to defeat us in the finale. Still, we reached\
  \ the end and accomplished our goal of playing through an entire adventure path\
  \ in the shortest amount of time ever recorded—yet another world record! We also\
  \ clocked the largest number of documented session hours of Pathfinder (played and\
  \ GMed) within a 6-month period. It is our hope that the work we leave here will\
  \ have contributed something new and lasting to the RPG community, and that others\
  \ will follow in our footsteps in the days to come.</p> \n      <p>The footsteps\
  \ of giants.</p> \n      <h2>More Content</h2> \n      <p>Read through the entirety\
