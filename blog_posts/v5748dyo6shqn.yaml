  >That morning, several survey teams landed on the planet—which scientists back in\
  \ the Pact Worlds had named Weydana-4—and began taking samples of the soil, the\
  \ plants, and just about everything they could get their hands on. Long-distance\
  \ scans had revealed that the planet had a breathable atmosphere, normal weather\
  \ patterns, and an abundance of flora and fauna, but the corporate sponsors wanted\
  \ everything double-checked firsthand and in advance of the hundreds of settlers\
  \ that would soon be arriving.</p> \n     <p>But Lixette de Courtois was born and\
  \ raised on Absalom Station, and though she spent years studying newly discovered\
  \ planets like this one from afar, this was her first time setting foot on one.\
  \ And she didn’t want to spend it scrounging through the dirt. When Zheffori, a\
  \ biologist from Castrovel, shouted in excitement after finding a pile of hardened\
  \ droppings from some unknown animal, Lixette muttered an excuse of “getting a better\
  \ vantage point,” put her datapad on a crate, and climbed the nearby rise.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Her boots swished through the tall grass as she stepped out from the shade\
  \ of several blue-leafed trees. The sun warmed her face as she fixed her gaze on\
  \ the cloud-topped mountain range in the distance. Somewhere, a bird chirped. She\
  \ took a deep breath of clean, sweet-smelling air and smiled. </p> \n     <p>“I\
  \ could get used to this,” she mused. The bird continued to sing, but Lixette couldn’\
  t really say whether or not it did so in response to her.</p> \n     <p>Lixette\
  \ began to stroll along the top of the ridge until she caught the scent of something\
  \ sweet. She stopped where the ground to her left became a sheer cliff. Approximately\
  \ 150 feet below, an array of brightly colored flowers sprouted from a sprawling\
  \ bush. Thick vines clung to the cliff face and reached all the way to the top,\
  \ and vibrant blooms adorned these vines, providing the source of the fragrance.\
  \ She squatted down to pluck one of the flowers, eager to bring it right under her\
  \ nostrils for a good, long sniff.</p> \n     <p>Suddenly, the vine shot up and\
  \ wrapped around her wrist.</p> \n     <p>Lixette let out a surprised shout. Again,\
  \ the bird tweeted. Lixette was starting to think it was mocking her.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>She pulled against the vine, but it held strong. Much stronger than it had\
  \ any right to be. As it pulled her arm downward, Lixette lost her balance and fell\
  \ to her knees at the edge of the cliff. A dislodged pebble tumbled into the empty\
  \ space and soon landed quietly in the bush below, which prompted some kind of reaction\
  \ from the plant; its leaves and branches parted—<em>like an opening mouth</em>,\
  \ Lixette thought—to reveal a collection of jagged rocks. Even from a distance,\
  \ Lixette could see them stained with blood. The sun glinted off something white\
  \ nestled within the stones: the bones of several small creatures.</p> \n     <p>Lixette\
  \ couldn’t help but be a little impressed at millennia of evolution that would produce\
  \ such a unique feeding method. “Oh, you devious…,” she muttered while struggling\
  \ against the vine trying to yank her over the edge. Its pull was insistent, and\
  \ if she had been much smaller, Lixette would have already been dashed against the\
  \ rocks below, her blood seeping into the soil to water this carnivorous plant’\
  s roots.</p> \n     <p>Looking down, she saw another vine slithering its way toward\
  \ her. If she didn’t free herself soon, her size wouldn’t save her. Lixette cried\
  \ out for help, hoping someone from the survey team was near enough to hear her,\
  \ but there was no immediate response. Even the bird had fallen silent. <em>Traitor</em>,\
  \ Lixette thought.</p> \n     <p>The vine had now dragged her hand below the top\
  \ of the cliff, and Lixette strained to keep her balance. She regretted not bringing\
  \ anything to defend herself, but the bigwigs that sent her didn’t expect her to\
  \ be traipsing off on her own. She had flaunted the protocols, and she would pay\
  \ for it with her life. Lixette started to desperately pat down her jumpsuit with\
  \ her free hand, hoping beyond hope that she had something—anything—that could save\
  \ her.</p> \n     <p>She almost missed it at first: a thin cylinder of plastic.\
  \ It was the stylus she had been using to enter observations on her datapad earlier.\
  \ She must have absentmindedly slipped it into her left-hand pocket earlier. With\
  \ a triumphant cry, Lixette pulled the stylus out and plunged it deep into the vine.\
  \ The plant reflexively spasmed slightly, just enough to loosen its grip on her\
  \ wrist. She pulled herself away from the edge of the cliff, muddying the backside\
  \ of her jumpsuit in the process. The vine flopped onto the ground, the stylus still\
  \ jutting out like a strange, plastic thorn, before it slid down and out of sight.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lixette stood up and started to wipe the dirt off her legs but then\
  \ thought better of it. She brushed a lock of sweaty hair off her forehead and suddenly\
  \ let out a choked whimper of relief. The bird began to chirp again, as if nature\
  \ was releasing its held breath. In a forgiving mood, Lixette smiled in the general\
  \ direction of the birdsong.</p> \n     <p>As she walked back down the rise to the\
  \ rest of her team, Lixette realized she had never felt more alive. Perhaps it was\
  \ just the adrenaline of a near-death experience, but she had a spring in her step\
  \ and a new purpose dawning in her mind.</p> \n     <p>Upon her return, Zheffori\
  \ said, “Lix, where’d you go? Are you ok? You look a little… flushed.”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>“Never better!” she replied.</p> \n     <p>“Okay then. Well, we’re all heading\
  \ back to the shuttle, so get your last looks in for today.”</p> \n     <p>Lixette\
  \ smiled, knowing that once they got back in orbit, she’d be requesting a seat on\
  \ one of those colony ships. “This place hasn’t seen the last of me.”</p> \n   \
