  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">When we announced Pathfinder Second Edition,\
  \ the organized play team began gathering feedback from our player base and volunteer\
  \ organizers as to what they liked about Pathfinder Society and what they would\
  \ like carried over to Second Edition campaign. We continued this outreach in person\
  \ and across a variety of digital platforms and the end of 2018 saw several rounds\
  \ of blog posts collated from forum threads and surveys associated with the blog\
  \ topics.</p> \n    <p>Your feedback and input were leading factors as we assessed\
  \ what worked well that we wanted to keep, and how to incorporate your choices for\
  \ a player-influenced campaign. Throughout our conversations, we regularly referred\
  \ back to your responses to ensure that new rules addressed the community's concerns\
  \ wherever possible. The process has taken some time, and more than a year has passed\
  \ between the new edition's announcement and today's blog. Now that the Core Rulebook\
  \ is at the printer, we can start announcing what Pathfinder Society will look like\
  \ when it launches at Gen Con 2019.</p> \n    <p>It's worth noting that some of\
  \ these decisions were contentious, often including survey data with mixed results\
  \ that pushed us to deliberate how best to deliver a quality organized play experience\
  \ while doing what we can to address opposing concerns. That said, these include\
  \ changes. It's our goal that these changes strengthen the new campaign while maintaining\
  \ the spirit of the Pathfinder Society, and we ask that you see them in action before\
  \ judging their ultimate merit. We'll be listening especially closely for feedback\
  \ from players and volunteers alike in the campaign's early months, and if something\
  \ isn't working correctly, we'll be looking for ways to adjust and fine tune.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Also, there's far more for us to announce that can be reasonably fit\
  \ in a single blog, so we'll be posting more updates over the next several months.\
  \ You'll see a variety of organized play team members introducing organized play\
  \ nuances of character building, running adventures, and factions. And even if a\
  \ team member doesn't appear as a blog's author, know what we've all had a hand\
  \ in creating these new policies and features. All told, a lot is coming between\
  \ now and Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>For this week, we want to focus on what you earn—\
  both as a player and as a PC.</p> \n    <h2>The Basics</h2> \n    <p>Let's introduce\
  \ some terms, many familiar and a few new or slightly changed. In the First Edition\
  \ campaign, you had four values that you might track: Experience Points (XP), Gold\
  \ Pieces (GP), Fame, and Prestige Points (PP). In Starfinder Society, we renamed\
  \ a few of these, but mostly just added a fifth value: Infamy. In Pathfinder Society's\
  \ second edition campaign, there's a little more to track, but you'll see a lot\
  \ you recognize from Starfinder Society in particular.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li><strong>Experience\
  \ Points (XP)</strong>: These track a character's level.</li> \n     <li><strong>Infamy</strong>:\
  \ This tracks how notorious a PC is for having performed evil or highly disreputable\
  \ actions. Most PCs are unlikely to earn this.</li> \n     <li><strong>Reputation</strong>:\
  \ This tracks how much influence a PC has in a faction.</li> \n     <li><strong>Achievement\
  \ Points (AcP)</strong>: These are a player-based currency earned by playing and\
  \ GMing Pathfinder Society games. These are used to access special character options\
  \ and to gain special benefits tied to the campaign's rules.</li> \n     <li><strong>Downtime</strong>:\
  \ At the end of each adventure, a PC earns Downtime measured in days (3 days per\
  \ 1 XP) that should be spent by the start of the next adventure. Downtime allows\
  \ a PC to earn additional money through a profession, craft gear, retrain character\
  \ options, and more.</li> \n     <li><strong>Fame</strong>: This represents the\
  \ PC's social capital, which they can spend on purchasing boons and services.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><strong>Gold Pieces (GP)</strong>: These represent the PC's wealth,\
  \ used to buy gear and services.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Seven fields are a decent\
  \ amount to manage. Fortunately, three of these are tracking numbers (XP, Infamy,\
  \ and Reputation) that will go up slowly over time. Three of these are currencies\
  \ (Downtime, Fame, and GP) that your character uses to acquire gear and other edges.\
  \ And one is a currency for you as a player.</p> \n    <p>We imagine you have questions!\
  \ Let's look at these more closely.</p> \n    <h3>Experience Points (XP)</h3> \n\
  \    <p>When working out the XP system for Second Edition, we looked at several\
  \ different models, including both the model that Pathfinder Society currently uses\
  \ (3 XP = 1 Level) and a true XP system (such as how the Core Rulebook requires\
  \ 1,000 XP to gain a level). In the end, we chose a system where there are 12 XP\
  \ within each level. A scenario grants 4 XP, while a quest gives 1 XP. The chapters\
  \ of longer, sanctioned adventures grant the full 12 XP needed to gain a level.\
  \ One way to think about it is that each XP represents roughly 1 hour of play.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>You may have seen us talking about quests in previous blogs, but in case\
  \ you haven't, we're going to be releasing more of them going forward. We're adding\
  \ one quest to each month's releases starting with the launch of the Second Edition\
  \ campaign, in addition to two Pathfinder Society scenarios. Having more quests\
  \ allows us to explore more locations and stories, and it gives more content for\
  \ times and places where people can't sit down to play for hours at a time.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>However, quests in First Edition were a little challenging to handle\
  \ because there were two forms those quests took: either a bundle of 4–6 quests\
  \ that required players to play the whole series to earn the full rewards, or stand-alone\
  \ quests that granted no XP, GP, or Fame. In Second Edition, we're building the\
  \ campaign so that quests are a rewards-granting entity from the very beginning,\
  \ even for stand-alone quests. With each being worth 1 XP, it should be easier to\
  \ track their rewards—including no need for fractional XP.</p> \n    <p>There's\
  \ one other matter to discuss about Fractional XP: the Slow Advancement Track. The\
  \ slow track is an option where players can choose at the beginning of an adventure\
  \ to earn fewer rewards to slow their character's advancement. We will be retaining\
  \ slow track in Second Edition. A slow track scenario will grant 2 XP. The only\
  \ players who will see fractional XP are those who choose to use slow advancement\
  \ track while playing a quest, earning 1/2 XP per quest.</p> \n    <h3>Infamy</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>Oh, but we love Infamy. In the First Edition campaign, performing evil\
  \ deeds could lead to a warning or a PC's possible expulsion from the campaign (barring\
  \ atonement), but it was difficult to track. Instituting a quantitative tracking\
  \ system mid-campaign proved surprisingly tricky, so when we were creating Starfinder\
  \ Society, we built in Infamy from the beginning.</p> \n    <p>The concept's reasonably\
  \ straightforward. When your PC does something utterly notorious, uncaring, or outright\
  \ evil, they can earn a point of Infamy (many scenarios also include special notes\
  \ about a particular circumstance that might grant Infamy). Before you follow through,\
  \ the GM's supposed to warn you about the likely consequences, and it's your call\
  \ whether to do it anyway. Infamy gets tracked between adventures, and if you end\
  \ an adventure with 3 or more Infamy, the Society determines your PC is too significant\
  \ a threat to the Society's reputation and interests to keep around; that PC's removed\
  \ from play. You can spend a notable amount of Fame to remove Infamy, and each point\
  \ of Infamy you have makes it a little harder to purchase gear. From what we've\
  \ seen and heard in Starfinder Society is that Infamy gain is relatively rare, and\
  \ it's pretty easy to predict and avoid.</p> \n    <p>Expect to see Infamy largely\
  \ unchanged in the upcoming Pathfinder Society campaign.</p> \n    <h3>Reputation\
  \ and Fame</h3> \n    <p>We're also pretty happy with how factions operate in Starfinder\
  \ Society, and this model is strongly inspiring the Second Edition campaign. To\
  \ catch you up to speed, Starfinder Society allows each PC to represent numerous\
  \ factions, and each faction represents less an outside interest and more of a subculture\
  \ within the Society with unique goals. As you adventure, you can choose to focus\
  \ on one faction or more evenly spread out your influence in each one (i.e., Reputation).\
  \ The higher your Reputation with a faction, the more faction-oriented goodies you\
  \ can access. So in practice, Reputation is like XP for a faction. You earn it slowly,\
  \ and it only goes up over time.</p> \n    <p>Essentially, fame is what we know\
  \ as Prestige Points in Pathfinder Society's first edition. You can spend Fame to\
  \ purchase various services, such as securing spellcasting and paying off any Infamy.\
  \ It's also used to buy many of those faction-oriented benefits mentioned above.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>Downtime</h3> \n    <p>Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society both\
  \ have a basic Downtime mechanic already, for which the default benefit is the Day\
  \ Job check—roll a skill check and earn some extract gold or credits. However, Downtime's\
  \ also very direct, with each PC earning a unit of Downtime with no fractions or\
  \ the like. There's some room for improvement.</p> \n    <p>Second Edition's core\
  \ rules have Downtime mechanics built into the game, which makes it pretty darn\
  \ easy for the Pathfinder Society experience to match how everyone else is playing\
  \ the game. Downtime's used for a variety of tasks, from Earn Income to make some\
  \ money, to Crafting to make your own gear (at a nicely balanced discount), to retraining\
  \ class features, to any number of special outlets for Downtime that adventures\
  \ might open up.</p> \n    <p>In the Second Edition campaign, expect to see Downtime\
  \ and earn it after each adventure. The number of days of Downtime earned depend\
  \ on the XP you earned, so barring any custom “gain bonus Downtime” rewards we might\
  \ include in adventures, you can predict about how much you'll make at each level.\
  \ Unlike other resources, you can't stockpile Downtime; you'll get some Downtime\
  \ at the end of the adventure, and it's up to you to use it before the next adventure.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>Gold Pieces (GP)</h3> \n    <p>At face value, there might not seem to\
  \ be anything to say here. Gold—and silver at earlier levels—lets you buy gear.\
  \ You might have heard about Pathfinder Section Edition using a rarity system, though,\
  \ so there's a little more involved when it comes to acquiring Uncommon or Rare\
  \ equipment than throwing a bag of coins at the problem. For now, know that we're\
  \ addressing rarities in a future blog, and every week we explore additional possibilities\
  \ for opening up a portion of the Uncommon options in fun and accessible ways.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>Achievement Points (AcP)</h3> \n    <p>Okay, so gold, Downtime, Fame.\
  \ These are things our organized play community has handled in some form or another\
  \ before. Achievement Points may be more familiar than you think, but it's easy\
  \ to overlook because their predecessor (Playtest Points) hasn't entirely wrapped\
  \ up yet.</p> \n    <p>At their core, Achievement Points are about equality. As\
  \ best I recall, Paizo introduced convention boons at Gen Con 2011, giving attendees\
  \ a chance to win the first of many much-desired race boons. It took a little while,\
  \ but slowly race boons became fairly common convention rewards beyond Gen Con,\
  \ and they've been a staple of incentivizing convention play and celebrating attendees\
  \ at Paizo-sponsored events since. Ah, but for as long as there have been convention\
  \ boons, there have been concerns about those who can't make it to conventions (or\
  \ in the case of some rarer rewards, those who can't make it to the “right” conventions).\
  \ For every valid concern about missing content by not reaching conventions, there's\
  \ an equally valid concern as to how the program can help keep the convention scene\
  \ vibrant without great GM rewards (i.e., “If not race boons, then what?”).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Our answer is Achievement Points. Whenever you participate in—and report—\
  a Pathfinder Society adventure, you earn Achievement Points. You'll receive a base\
  \ amount for playing, earn more for GMing, and even more for GMing at Paizo-sponsored\
  \ conventions like PaizoCon and Gen Con. No matter where you are or how you play,\
  \ you'll be earning Achievement Points. We haven't finalized the exact numbers,\
  \ as we are looking at how the Regional Support Program and Event Support for conventions\
  \ interact and how we can incorporate both into the Achievement Point system. The\
  \ chart of what activity earns what is one of those announcements for future blogs.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>What does one <em><strong>do</strong></em> with these AcP (we're using\
  \ that abbreviation to not confuse everyone about Adventure Paths)? You can redeem\
  \ them on the Paizo website for different rewards that you might typically associate\
  \ with convention boons or GM boons. No doubt that will include access to uncommon\
  \ ancestries from upcoming products, but it could also include somewhat “meta” benefits\
  \ like opening up replay options, providing a more comprehensive character rebuild,\
  \ or starting a new PC at a higher level. Purchase the boon, print off a copy, and\
  \ keep it with that PC. Or go digital and keep track of your AcP purchases on your\
  \ My Organized Play page at Paizo.com The system we've requested and are testing\
  \ auto-fills your organized play number and other key fields, limiting the potential\
  \ to print off a hundred copies for all of your friends.</p> \n    <p>All told,\
  \ it means that someone who plays a lot but never GMs could still save up to grab\
  \ the reward of their choice, and someone who passionately GMs at numerous shows\
  \ each year can accumulate and spend AcP more quickly. But everyone has access to\
  \ the same rewards, with a few exceptions. We expect that there will be occasional\
  \ limited-access options (like the charity boons Paizo's created for the past several\
  \ years) but anticipate there to be far less Gen Con-exclusives. We also expect\
  \ we'll shake up some of the options that AcP can access, but there will be an announcement\
  \ period so participants can make the most informed decisions for their characters.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>At this time, we are only planning AcP for Pathfinder Society and will\
  \ provide physical boons for Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Adventure Card Society.\
  \ If the AcP system works well, we will look at how we could incorporate it into\
  \ the other Paizo organized play programs.</p> \n    <h2>In Review</h2> \n    <p>For\
  \ someone familiar with our other organized play programs, there are some changes\
  \ to the process. For someone new to Paizo organized play programs, it can be a\
  \ lot to digest. We revisited what many of these scores to explain them more simply.\
  \ Here's the TL,DR:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li><strong>Experience Points (XP)</strong>:\
  \ This tells me my character level.</li> \n     <li><strong>Infamy</strong>: This\
  \ is rare and tracks how much of a jerk my PC has been.</li> \n     <li><strong>Reputation</strong>:\
  \ This is how much a faction likes me.</li> \n     <li><strong>Achievement Points\
  \ (AcP)</strong>: I spend these on any of my PCs to access unusual character options\
  \ and opportunities.</li> \n     <li><strong>Downtime</strong>: This is my character's\
  \ free time for training, earning money, or making things.</li> \n     <li><strong>Fame</strong>:\
  \ I spend this on buying boons and favors.</li> \n     <li><strong>Gold Pieces(GP)</strong>:\
  \ I spend this on gear and services.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized\
