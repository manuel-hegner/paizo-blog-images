  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Nhalmika Ironsight\
  \ honors dwarven tradition, even as she wanders the surface world far from home.\
  \ With her wide build, mane of dark hair, and amber eyes, Nhalmika is striking in\
  \ any setting, but it’s the dwarven scattergun she keeps at hand that her friends\
  \ and foes most remember.</p> \n     <p>Nhalmika’s birth was a celebration. The\
  \ third child of two prosperous dwarven merchants, Nhalmika became the final addition\
  \ to a family larger than that of most dwarves in Dongun Hold. Her two older brothers\
  \ doted on her, making simple crafts as presents and as their skill grew, the gifts\
  \ they made became more artistic. She teethed on gold tiles engraved with the images\
  \ of ancestors and slept beneath stone carvings of Dongun Hold’s greatest leaders.\
  \ Nhalmika’s parents arranged for their children to have fine clothes and talented\
  \ tutors but were too busy to have much to do with her upbringing.</p> \n     <p>Everyone\
  \ expected Nhalmika to become either an artisan like her brothers or a merchant\
  \ like her parents. She had aptitude for neither. She was more skilled at judging\
  \ art than creating, noticing tiny flaws such as an uneven line in a carving or\
  \ a hairline crack in a gemstone or statue. She had a weakness for hard luck stories\
  \ and pleas for credit, and her parents soon learned they couldn’t trust her with\
  \ preserving the family finances. Her mother complained that Nhalmika’s eagerness\
  \ to help others would put them out of business.</p> \n     <p>Nhalmika instead\
  \ preferred to play physical games and sports. Her athletic build and keen eye made\
  \ her a natural champion, and her good sportsmanship made her popular with her peers.\
  \ She surprised her family by declaring she would join the military, serving among\
  \ the vanguards of Dongun Hold. Military service was an honorable, traditional calling\
  \ and it seemed to suit her nature well. No one in her family mourned her departure\
  \ for the training academy as much as Dargrim, a friend of her eldest brother and\
  \ eager co-captain on most sports she played. Nhalmika had excellent vision, but\
  \ she didn’t see Dargrim had given his whole heart to her.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/323c789b-7e51-4a42-a3f8-0307e601809a/IconicGunslinger_Nhalmika_keyart.jpg\"\

  \ dwarven woman with dark, copper skin, amber eyes, and dark brown hair. She stands\
  \ confidently, with a hand on her hip, the other resting a large dwarven scattergun\
  \ over her shoulder\"></a><em> Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</em> \n     <p>In\
  \ her training, Nhalmika gained familiarity with dwarven firearms of all types.\
  \ She proved particularly adept with long rifles, but considered sniping to be dull\
  \ and, truth be told, a little unfair. She preferred the noisy blasts of fuse bombs\
  \ and scatterguns, which put her right in the action where she was needed most.\
  \ Her family paled to hear her exuberant tales of lobbing grenades, packing enormous\
  \ canisters of black powder, and taking a cannon’s recoil hard enough to fracture\
  \ her shoulder.</p> \n     <p>Only Dargrim appreciated that Nhalmika had found a\
  \ calling she truly loved, and she found she loved Dargrim for it. The two were\
  \ married just before her first deployment. Her parents arranged an opulent wedding\
  \ in a traditional dwarven style and her brothers lavished the couple with necklaces\
  \ made of her gold teething-tiles. Nhalmika and Dargrim left Dongun Hold as a couple—\
  Nhalmika to serve as a guard to the Bridge of the Gods leading from Dongun Hold\
  \ to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar and Dargrim to make their simple quarters a home\
  \ over the next several years.</p> \n     <p>The first time Nhalmika became pregnant,\
  \ she was excused from duty for the birth and first year of her daughter’s life.\
  \ She’d already earned a nickname, the Ironsight, and her commanding officer was\
  \ sorry to lose her keen eyes overlooking trouble in the badlands below the bridge.\
  \ Nhalmika doted on her daughter but was eager to return to duty. Upon her second\
  \ pregnancy, Nhalmika’s commander predicted she wouldn’t return, but had underestimated\
  \ her loyalty and integrity: Nhalmika reported the day after her son’s first birthday,\
  \ ready to face bloodthirsty bandits and berserk clockworks with her scattergun\
  \ in hand. Nhalmika’s third pregnancy was particularly difficult, and not the celebration\
  \ her own birth had been. For weeks, the medics were certain they would lose both\
  \ Nhalmika and the baby girl, yet both mother and daughter survived. Nhalmika’s\
  \ youngest daughter, Ondla, was always sick and small, but had her mother’s grit.\
  \ Nhalmika returned to duty a year later but spent all the time she could helping\
  \ her children grow up. She got used to blasting mutant raiders one day and teaching\
  \ dwarven history the next.</p> \n     <p>Nhalmika’s children showed talents she\
  \ lacked. Her eldest daughter went to carve exquisite statuary under her uncles’\
  \ tutelage and her son took up his grandparents’ affairs and proved to be a shrewd\
  \ but honest merchant. Nhalmika and Dargrim were both proud of their children’s\
  \ accomplishments, and never hesitant about saying so. Quiet and studious Ondla,\
  \ whom neither parent would openly admit was their favorite, remained at home to\
  \ tend to her father. Dargrim began showing symptoms of a serious degenerative disease.\
  \ His head and hands shook, and he soon couldn’t stand. His decline was swift and\
  \ his death both sudden and tragic. Ondla found solace and an unlikely romance with\
  \ a human bookkeeper from Alkenstar, but Nhalmika was alone, and she was devastated.\
  \ She numbly accepted the proffered retirement from the military, uncertain what\
  \ she’d do next.</p> \n     <p>Her grief was strong, but it isn’t in her nature\
  \ to be idle or eschew serving others. Nhalmika has been a soldier and mother, but\
  \ both her nation and children are moving on. She knows others beyond Dongun Hold\
  \ and Alkenstar need her help. So Nhalmika settled her affairs, advised her children\
  \ to work hard and love well, and left. She brought her dwarven scattergun from\
  \ her time as a guard, a handful of medals, and a few of the gold teething-tiles\
  \ her brothers gave her. Nhalmika has lived a full life, but she doesn’t think her\
  \ best days are behind her—to the contrary, she’s ready to stand up for the downtrodden\
  \ across Golarion. Her adventuring companions admire her skill with a gun, but they\
  \ truly appreciate her grit, keen eyes, and motherly guidance.</p> \n     <p style=\"\
