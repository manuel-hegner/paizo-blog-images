  \ Those cats were fast as lightning! Ahem. You will excuse my outburst of the Carl\
  \ Douglas classic. This week we are taking a look at Sajan, the iconic monk. During\
  \ the playtest there was a lot of debate on what to do with the monk, and everyone\
  \ seemed to have their own idea on how to fix the class. From the beta to the final,\
  \ we made a lot of tweaks to improve the class, from speeding up some progressions\
  \ (such as the monk AC bonus) to adding more bonus feats (including the number granted\
  \ and the selection available), but we also made a few large changes.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Let's start by taking a look at the monk's primary mode of attack: flurry of\
  \ blows. This system is revised from the 3.5 version to work using mechanics similar\
  \ to the Two-Weapon Fighting feats, but the new monk goes one step further and uses\
  \ its monk level as its base attack bonus whenever it uses flurry of blows. At 8th\
  \ level, this means that Sajan has one additional attack and all of those attacks\
  \ are at a +1 over his 3.5 counterpart. If we look at 20th level, Sajan would have\
  \ 2 extra attacks and those attacks are at a +3 over the 3.5 statistics. Of course,\
  \ Sajan can still use special monk weapons for these attacks as well.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>In addition, all monks now receive the Stunning Fist feat for free, allowing\
  \ them to stun opponents for 1 round with a hit. As a monk gains levels, he can\
  \ decide to apply different effects, some of which last considerably longer. At\
  \ 8th level, Sajan can make his opponents fatigued (which lasts until they rest)\
  \ or sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, Sajan could instead stagger his foes\
  \ for 1d6+1 rounds (making it so they can only take a move or a standard action\
  \ each turn). At 16th level he can permanently blind or deafen his enemies and at\
  \ 20th level, he can paralyze them for 1d6+1 rounds. These abilities are separate\
  \ from the monk's quivering palm attack, which functions much as before, except\
  \ that now monks can use quivering palm once per day (as opposed to once per week).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Monks are also skilled at performing and defending against combat maneuvers\
  \ (such as grapple, bull rush, and trip). They use their monk level as their base\
  \ attack bonus when calculating their Combat Maneuver Bonus. They also add their\
  \ Wisdom and monk AC bonus to their Combat Maneuver Defense, making them truly skilled\
  \ at resisting attempts made against them.</p> \n    <p>To add to the monk's offensive\
  \ and defensive abilities, they now gain access to a pool of <i>ki</i> points that\
  \ can be spent for temporary bonuses. At 4th level, Sajan gained the ability to\
  \ spend 1 point as a swift action to make an additional attack as part of a flurry\
  \ of blows (at his highest bonus), increase his speed by +20 ft. for 1 round, or\
  \ to grant himself a +4 dodge bonus to his AC. At 5th level, he gained the high\
  \ jump ability, which grants him a bonus equal to his class level on all Acrobatics\
  \ checks made to jump, but it also allows him to spend a <i>ki</i> point for a +20\
  \ bonus to a single check. At 7th level, Sajan gained the ability to heal himself\
  \ by spending 2 <i>ki</i> points. At higher levels, he can use this pool to dimension\
  \ door or to become ethereal. The number of points in his pool goes up with his\
  \ level as well, granting him 1 point per two levels, plus his Wisdom modifier (and\
  \ 2 from the Extra <i>Ki</i> feat). As long as he has at least 1 <i>ki</i> point\
  \ in his pool, all of his attacks are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming\
  \ damage reduction. At 10th level, they are treated as lawful and at 16th level,\
  \ they are treated as adamantine.</p> \n    <p>Finally, we made one additional change,\
  \ although subtle, to boost the power of the monk. The <i>amulet of mighty fists</i>\
  \ can now be used to grant melee special weapon qualities to the monk's unarmed\
  \ strikes (flaming in this case). We also repriced the item to make it a bit more\
  \ attractive for our kung fu masters (this one only costs 5,000 gp to add flaming\
  \ to all his natural attacks, but the higher level version received a discount as\
  \ well). A similar change was made to <i>bracers of armor</i>, allowing them to\
  \ grant special armor qualities, such as light fortification.</p> \n    <p>Sajan\
  \ also has a few feats to make him more versatile in combat. Improved Disarm and\
  \ Greater Disarm give him a +14 bonus total on disarm combat maneuvers and any weapons\
  \ he disarms are knocked up to 15 feet away from the wielder. Stand Still forces\
  \ those that attempt to move past Sajan to stop if he strikes them with an attack\
  \ of opportunity (of which he gets 4 per round due to Combat Reflexes). Combined\
  \ with Scorpion Style, which allows Sajan to make a single attack that reduces the\
  \ target's speed to 5 feet for 3 rounds, he can really stop a foe from moving past\
  \ him and then prevent that foe from moving away later.</p> \n    <p>Eight classes\
  \ down and three to go, which means that we are only five weeks from the release\
  \ of the Core Rulebook! Next week I will rant and rage about the powers of Amiri,\
  \ the iconic barbarian.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead Designer</p> \n   </blockquote>\
