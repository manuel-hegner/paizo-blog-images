  \   <h3>Radovan</h3> \n      <p>The boss peered through his spyglass. \"There.\"\
  \ </p> \n      <p>I squinted at the Ustalav side of the river. In the distance,\
  \ the Hungry Mountains had just gnawed the sun to death, smearing the sky with blood.\
  \ Shadows huddled on the west bank. On account of my devil blood, I see just fine\
  \ in the dark. At a distance, not so much.</p> \n      <p>\"Let me see.\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>He handed me the glass, but the barge captain snatched it away. She put\
  \ it to her eye.</p> \n      <p>Zora Gorcha was a tough old bird. She looked a good\
  \ ten years older than the boss, but she couldn't have been much past half his age,\
  \ which was working on a hundred. Even so, more red than gray curls spilled out\
  \ of her headscarf. I didn't mind that. Even the rope of garlic around her neck\
  \ didn't put me off. I like garlic almost as much as redheads and older women.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Everybody on deck was wearing garlic, including Arni. The big dog hated\
  \ the stinky collar, but the boss taught him to leave it alone. Arni listened to\
  \ me sometimes, but he always obeyed the boss. </p> \n      <p>Even the big bay\
  \ draft horses tethered beside the Red Carriage wore loops of garlic. At first they'd\
  \ eaten the bulbs off each other's necks, which Zora said was good for repelling\
  \ mosquitoes, but the boss disagreed. He made the crew adjust their tethers, saying\
  \ too much garlic was bad for horses. Besides, bugs weren't the bloodsuckers he\
  \ was worried about.</p> \n      <p>Zora peered through the brass tube of the spyglass.\
  \ \"Is a different man, no?\"</p> \n      <p>\"A different man,\" said the boss.\
  \ \"Yes.\"</p> \n      <p>\"You have dangerous enemies, Count Jeggare.\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"I did not conceal this fact from you, Captain. I trust you are not frightened.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Not frightened,\" she said, looking him up and down. \"Impressed.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>The boss clicked his heels and made a little bow. </p> \n      <p>\"\
  Come on,\" I said. \"Let me see.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Wait your turn. I am boat captain.\
  \ You are only...What did you say?\"</p> \n      <p>\"Bodyguard.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Bodyguard,\" she said, all dubious-like. \"I wonder.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Come on,\
  \ you've had your look.\"</p> \n      <p>Zora slapped the spyglass into my hand.\
  \ She tilted her head back to look down her hooked nose at me.</p> \n      <p>She\
  \ fancied me, all right.</p> \n      <p>It took a few seconds to find the cultist.\
  \ He wore the same kind of tattered cloak and leathers, but he wasn't the tall,\
  \ lean guy we'd seen the night before. This one was built like a wrestler, kind\
  \ of like me. Bigger, maybe. Hard to judge without somebody standing next to him.\
  \ I wanted to get my mitts on his neck and work out which one of us was stronger.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Zora gasped and stepped away.</p> \n      <p>\"Radovan,\" said the\
  \ boss. At his heel, Arni whined and put his head on his gigantic paws.</p> \n \
  \     <p>\"What?\"</p> \n      <p>\"You ...growled.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I didn't.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>Did I?</p> \n      <p>Zora shot me the Varisian evil eye, which\
  \ looks kind of like the tines, only low and backward. I got the feeling she fancied\
  \ me a little less. She shouted at her crew to keep well away from the Ustalavic\
  \ shore.</p> \n      <p>We'd been hugging the eastern bank ever since we got clear\
  \ of Razmiran. Even so, the first night we spent alongside Ustalav, these mooks\
  \ began showing up. They just stood there watching us. They hadn't tried anything.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>So far.</p> \n      <p>The boss studied my face like a page in a book.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"So what if I did growl? You hate these Anaphexis jerks as much as\
  \ I do. Aren't they pretty much the evil opposite of your little club?\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"The goals of the Anaphexis are indeed the antithesis of the Society's,\"\
  \ he said. \"And please, for the thousandth time, I ask you to cease referring to\
  \ the Pathfinder Society as my ‘little club.'\"</p> \n      <p>\"Aren't you still\
  \ on the outs with them? Or did that last letter change your mind?\"</p> \n    \
  \  <p>The boss touched his coat pocket. He had at least three different letters\
  \ there, two of them from queens, all of them asking for the same favor. \"I have\
  \ yet to decide, but that is beside the point. The Anaphexis merely remind us of\
  \ our oath.\"</p> \n      <p>\"<i>Your</i> oath. I never promised those mooks nothing.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"The word of a count of Cheliax binds both him and his—\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"Don't say ‘servant.' Don't say ‘henchman.'\"</p> \n      <p>\"You know\
  \ perfectly well I never refer to you by those terms. I was about to say ‘friend.'\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Yeah, yeah.\"</p> \n      <p>\"In any event, you know I made that\
  \ agreement for your sake as much as my own. More so, in fact.\"</p> \n      <p>He\
  \ had me there. One look at me, most folks realize my family tree has roots in Hell.\
  \ The Anaphexis, these killers of knowledge, they knew my big secret: my family\
  \ tree also has roots running under the throne of Ustalav.</p> \n      <p>A light\
  \ came up where we'd seen the Anaphexis twerp. He waved a torch over his head. Like\
  \ his buddies on the previous nights, he wanted to make sure we saw him.</p> \n\
  \      <p>We got the message, all right. If we broke the deal and landed on the\
  \ Ustalav side, it meant trouble for my people: the wolves, the witch, and the freaks.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>I felt the copper coin I wore around my neck. Scratched and half-melted,\
  \ the face stamped on one side did kind of resemble me if you were looking for a\
  \ family resemblance. A dozen times I almost lost the coin, but somehow it always\
  \ turned up. It was damned near the only thing I still had since the last time I\
  \ was in Ustalav. Well, that and the starknife.</p> \n      <p>The starknife hung\
  \ from my hip. Its double-edged blades shot out at compass angles from a ring around\
  \ the grip. I'd learned to throw it all right, but it never seemed like something\
  \ I ought to bloody. Most of the time I kept it with my pack. Since we'd gotten\
  \ close to Ustalav, I'd hung it from my waist for I don't know why.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Maybe I thought I'd see the woman who gave it to me, and she'd see that I'd\
  \ hung on to it. I kissed my thumb and drew the wings of Desna on my heart. </p>\
  \ \n      <p><i>Are you there, girl? You standing there, hidden on the black shore,\
  \ waiting for me? I've lugged this promise around a thousand miles. Sometimes I\
  \ think it's getting heavier, but tonight it feels</i>—</p> \n      <p>The boss\
  \ coughed. </p> \n      <p>I'd been talking out loud. That was worse than growling.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Why, Radovan,\" he said. \"You are a poet.\"</p> \n      <p>My blood\
  \ turned cold. \"You take that back right now.\" </p> \n      <p>\"Whatever for?\
  \ I meant it only as a compliment.\"</p> \n      <p>\"You take it back, or I will\
  \ beat your ass right here in front of the gods and everybody.\"</p> \n      <p>He\
  \ started to laugh, but then he saw my eyes. One thing we have in common, he's only\
  \ half human, too. His elf blood lets him see plenty good after dusk. What he saw\
  \ in my pretty yellow eyes sobered him up. </p> \n      <p>\"Very well, you are\
  \ nothing like a poet. Please permit me to withdraw my careless and utterly unfounded\
  \ inference to the contrary. Your untarnished reputation deserves not the least\
  \ such blemish, and I implore you to forgive my hasty and misinformed—\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"All right, all right! Forget it.\"</p> \n      <p>He raised an eyebrow\
  \ to let me know he'd humored me. </p> \n      <p>Feeling like a dope, I took another\
  \ peek through the spyglass. On the shore, the cultist waved the torch overhead.\
  \ In the firelight, I could make out the dried-blood color of his cloak. I saw the\
  \ lumps of his black mask. The boss said Anaphexis assassins made those masks out\
  \ of the flayed faces of their first five victims.</p> \n      <p>As the cultist\
  \ watched us watching him, a dark shape moved in the woods behind him. Its eyes\
  \ reflected the torchlight.</p> \n      <p>\"Hey!\"</p> \n      <p>\"What is it?\"\
  \ The boss reached for the spyglass, but I shrugged him off, careful not to give\
  \ him a spur in the heart. I wasn't really going to rough him up, poet talk or not.\
  \ At least, I was pretty sure I wasn't.</p> \n      <p>Out of the shadows, a black\
  \ wolf jumped the Anaphexis guy. It knocked him down and tore a hunk out of his\
  \ middle. He drew a blade, but another wolf ran in to clamp its jaws around his\
  \ wrist. The first wolf went for his throat as another two melted out of the woods\
  \ to join the feast.</p> \n      <p>A second later, we heard the scream. Just the\
  \ one, and then all we could hear was the sound of waves lapping around the barge.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Tell me what you see,\" said the boss.</p> \n      <p>\"Looks like\
  \ our enemies ain't the only ones watching us tonight. We got some friends out there.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>Three wolves tore the body to pieces while the first one stepped\
  \ away. It stood up on its hind legs, shifting gradually into a familiar figure.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>I knew that figure.</p> \n      <p>She picked up the guy's torch\
  \ and let its light show off her body. The flame turned her skin to gold. A moment\
  \ later, she brushed back her long black hair to make sure I had a good view.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>It was a real good view.</p> \n      <p>\"That's my girl.\" This time\
  \ I knew I was muttering out loud.</p> \n      <p>\"The witch?\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  The harrower. She's sending us a message.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Let me see.\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>I shrugged him off again. \"She ain't decent. I wouldn't want you to be\
  \ scandalized. She's got company, though. Three of them. Can't tell which ones unless\
  \ they shed their skins.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Please tell me they didn't kill the\
  \ Anaphexis agent.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Well ...\"</p> \n      <p>He sighed.</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"If it makes you feel any better, it don't look like they're leaving\
  \ any evidence.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Let us pray not. Their master is not a fool,\
  \ but it's possible he will attribute the loss of one agent to mishap. What is she\
  \ saying?\"</p> \n      <p>He must have thought she'd learned his Pathfinder hand\
  \ signs or something, but her message was a lot simpler. \"She misses me.\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Malena does?\"</p> \n      <p>\"All the girls miss me, boss. You\
  \ know that.\"</p> \n      <p>\"No doubt they, too, have been dealing with the encroachment\
  \ of the horde.\"</p> \n      <p>That was the thing, the reason we weren't going\
  \ home just yet.</p> \n      <p>The demons.</p> \n      <p>All winter, fiends kept\
  \ popping up all across Elfland—which the boss insists I call Kyonin, but my way's\
  \ funnier. At first we thought it was fallout from our caper in the Fierani Forest,\
  \ but they weren't coming from the Witchbole. They were showing up all across the\
  \ Inner Sea, and they were all coming from the one place they were supposed to be\
  \ stuck: the Worldwound.</p> \n      <p>The first summons came from Telandia, Queen\
  \ of Kyonin, Wearer of the Viridian Crown, High Protector something something—I\
  \ forget the rest. On account of we did her a good turn, she asked us to check out\
  \ why these demons were pouring out all over the world. The boss was inclined to\
  \ help, seeing as she'd done him some good turns, too. Anyway, it never hurts to\
  \ have the queen of the elves owe you a favor.</p> \n      <p>The elves put us on\
  \ a riverboat, along with the Red Carriage and the boss's fancy new horses. They\
  \ took us up the West Sellen between Razmiran and the River Kingdoms. Those guys\
  \ were having their own demon troubles.</p> \n      <p>Unlike some of the river\
  \ towns we'd passed, the people in a city called Tymon weren't running from the\
  \ fiends. They unleashed their gladiators on them. Those demons they didn't kill\
  \ they enslaved for the arena. That didn't seem like the smartest idea, but it stopped\
  \ them breaking up the joint.</p> \n      <p>Tymon was also where the boss's mail\
  \ caught up to him. He'd already had a few magic messages from Queen Abrogail's\
  \ sorcerers back home in Cheliax, as well as from some wizard with the Decemvirate,\
  \ his little club's inner circle. I half expected him to rip up their note, but\
  \ the Pathfinder letter was the one that got his attention, on account of they used\
  \ the magic word: \"book.\"</p> \n      <p>While everybody around the Inner Sea\
  \ wanted to know what had gone wrong at the Worldwound, the Decemvirate had an idea\
  \ how to sort it out. Whoever it'd been that first opened the door to the Abyss\
  \ a hundred years ago did their homework first. That included something called the\
  \ <i>Lexicon of Paradox</i>.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurb360\">\n       <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_RadovanSweetCoat.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_RadovanSweetCoat_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n       <br>Radovan has no problem putting undead back in the\
  \ ground.\n      </div> \n      <p>The boss knew the title. It was some kind of\
  \ famous evil book, like the <i>Lacuna Codex</i> we'd found and lost and found and\
  \ lost again. Once the boss knew the Pathfinders were interested, he wanted to be\
  \ the one who found it. Whether he planned to deliver it to Elfland, Cheliax, or\
  \ the Pathfinders' headquarters in Absalom was anybody's guess. I had a feeling\
  \ what he really wanted was to put it in his own library back at Greensteeples.\
  \ That didn't seem too smart of an idea, either, but he's the boss.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>The elves left us in Tymon, where we hired Zora Gorcha. Her crew included men\
  \ from both Ustalav and the River Kingdoms—but no Razmirans, those lunatics who\
  \ called their king a god.</p> \n      <p>I liked having the Ustalavs on the boat.\
  \ Even though I was born and bred Chelish, the human part of my blood was all Ustalavic,\
  \ far as I knew. It was about time I brushed up my Varisian, too. I'd been forgetting\
  \ all the best curses and getting bored of the ones I remembered.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Captain!\"</p> \n      <p>One of the sailors pointed up at the southern sky. Zora\
  \ yelled at her sailors to finish setting torches along the gunwales. I gave the\
  \ boss the spyglass before he could ask for it. \"Is it him?\"</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ boss fiddled with the spyglass until he got it in focus. His hand dropped to the\
  \ hilt of the Shadowless Sword. A princess from the other side of the world gave\
  \ that to him. No lie.</p> \n      <p>He drew it an inch out of the scabbard, letting\
  \ its magic pierce any illusions. When he stood up a little straighter, I knew the\
  \ answer before he said the name: \"Kasiya.\"</p> \n      <p>\"That guy don't know\
  \ when to quit.\"</p> \n      <p>The boss snapped the spyglass shut and put it in\
  \ the pocket of his long coat. Like my new leathers, it was elf-made but in the\
  \ Chelish style.</p> \n      <p>The horses snapped and stirred. During the river\
  \ voyage, they'd kept quiet as long as I kept my distance. With Kasiya on his way,\
  \ they sensed something wickeder than me.</p> \n      <p>From the sky came the sound\
  \ of barking dogs. Arni grumbled to hear it. The ruff of his neck went up.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Zora ordered her men to double-double-up. A pikeman joined each of the\
  \ sailors poling the boat upriver. A third man hustled over to each pair with a\
  \ covered fire pot. A fourth lowered buckets into the river and drew them back onto\
  \ deck.</p> \n      <p>The little dot in the sky became a blob. I could start making\
  \ out details.</p> \n      <p>A pack of long-legged dogs flew through the sky. They\
  \ pulled a chariot driven by Prince Kasiya, the Osirian vampire.</p> \n      <p>I'd\
  \ seen the gold-masked creep a couple times since Kyonin, and the boss knew him\
  \ from way back. Kasiya's cloak floated up behind him. He shook a javelin that crackled\
  \ with red lightning. </p> \n      <p>Something hung off the sides of his chariot.\
  \ Whatever it was was heavy, because each time he shifted his weight the whole thing\
  \ tilted one way or the other.</p> \n      <p>As they got closer, I saw the four\
  \ other guys hanging off the sides. It was hard to make out details, but there was\
  \ no mistaking their pale skin, clawed fingers, and red eyes. </p> \n      <p>Kasiya\
  \ had been busy making little vampires.</p> \n      <p>I pointed. \"Boss—\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"I saw them.\" He handed me his loop of garlic and drew the Shadowless\
  \ Sword.</p> \n      <p>\"You sure about this?\"</p> \n      <p>\"Let Arnisant defend\
  \ the horses,\" he said. He sent the wolfhound toward the Red Carriage while he\
  \ moved toward the side of the barge nearest the chariot. \"You support the crew.\
  \ Drive any boarders toward me.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Got it.\" He shot me a look.\
  \ I must have had a tone. \"I said I got it. It's just I'm used to being the mayhem.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>The boss smiled at that. We'd been a couple years in the field,\
  \ and he was becoming more and more a regular guy. Or maybe he'd always been one,\
  \ and it was just showing more since we'd been away from Egorian and all his fancy\
  \ peers.</p> \n      <p>One of the passengers dropped from the chariot. Kasiya's\
  \ vampire minion howled as he saw he was going to miss the barge by thirty yards.\
  \ He plunged into the river. A moment later, he came up screaming, flesh sloughing\
  \ off his arm. He went down again, water boiling where he'd been.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Idiot,\" the boss spat. \"Even his spawn are susceptible to running water.\" Then\
  \ he looked at me and added, \"But Kasiya is no less dangerous for his stupidity.\
  \ Do not allow any of them to touch you.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Check.\" I pulled the\
  \ big knife from the spine of my new jacket.</p> \n      <p>He shook his head at\
  \ the blade. \"I wish you would learn to use a sword or a spear—anything with reach.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>I shrugged. \"What can I say? Old dog.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Try the\
  \ scrolls.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Boss, you know I can't—\"</p> \n      <p>\"Just try\
  \ one before they close with us.\"</p> \n      <p>I sighed. No matter how often\
  \ I tried using the flippy scrolls, they never worked for me—except for the one\
  \ time. But that was before I <i>knew</i> they weren't supposed to work for me.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>That was the problem, the boss said. It worked when I didn't know better,\
  \ so I must have had a knack. The problem was that the more I thought I couldn't\
  \ use the riffle scrolls, the less chance I could make them work.</p> \n      <p>That's\
  \ what you call a paradox.</p> \n      <p>Before I could dig a scroll out of my\
  \ jacket, I saw a flicker of light above us. \"Hey, look out!\"</p> \n      <p>A\
  \ tiny red flame shot down from Kasiya's javelin. It got bigger as it got closer.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>The boss plucked a riffle scroll from the bandolier beneath his\
  \ coat. It was a stack of paper strips the size of my thumb, one end shut with a\
  \ brass brad. The boss pressed his thumb against the other end, pulling back the\
  \ edges to let the pages snap free one after the next. Each page glimmered for an\
  \ instant, the glow of one blending into the next to form fragments of arcane symbols.\
  \ Riffled like that, the pages cast a spell.</p> \n      <p>The boss's magic shot\
  \ up at Kasiya's fireball, barely visible even to my devil eyes. When the spells\
  \ met, the fireball flickered and vanished with a whoosh.</p> \n      <p>The rest\
  \ of Kasiya's vampire slaves flew down at us. Not \"flew\" flew. More like \"fell\
  \ screaming\" flew.</p> \n      <p>\"Brace yourself, boys!\" I said it again in\
  \ Varisian, even though all the Ustalavs spoke Taldane better than I spoke their\
  \ language. Speaking Varisian made me feel more like a vampire-slayer.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>One of the vamps hit the deck, rolling until its claws clung to the planks.\
  \ It crouched for a second, hissing. Its eyes fixed on one of the pikemen, a fat,\
  \ bearded Ustalav. The man's jowls went slack. He pulled the ring of garlic off\
  \ his neck and threw it over the side before walking toward the vampire.</p> \n\
  \      <p>I ran in, sliding to take out the fat man's legs. He fell beside me, stunned\
  \ but getting mad when he realized I'd knocked him down. There was no talking to\
  \ him since the vampire put the whammy on his mind. I headbutted him. It took two\
  \ shots to knock him out, and was I going to regret that later. I dropped the extra\
  \ garlic rope around his neck to make him bite-proof.</p> \n      <p>Kasiya's vampire\
  \ slave hissed at me, lashing out now and then to keep the other sailors at bay\
  \ but still unwilling to get close to the garlic. I got to my feet and shot it the\
  \ tines.</p> \n      <p>That's one Chelish gesture that never needs translating.\
  \ The vampire showed me its teeth.</p> \n      <p>I showed it mine.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>The vampire damn near swallowed its tongue.</p> \n      <p>\"All right, boys,\"\
  \ I began. I wanted to drive this mook toward the boss, but one of the sailors had\
  \ a different idea. He swung his fire pot, but the vamp leaped right over him. It\
  \ landed neat as a cat on the gunwales.</p> \n      <p>From the clothes I figured\
  \ the vamp had been a man of the River Kingdoms. Death grayed its face and hollowed\
  \ its cheeks. Its nails had grown dark and ragged. The thing lashed out at the sailor.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>I slapped my arm, filling my hand with darts from the secret pockets\
  \ in my sleeves. I flung them hard. Two struck deep into the vamp's face. The third\
  \ went flying past, into the river.</p> \n      <p>Snarling, the vampire plucked\
  \ one out of its cheek and made a show of licking off its own half-congealed blood.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The nearest sailor broke his pole across the vampire's neck, but the\
  \ monster hung on to the gunwales.</p> \n      <p>I looked to either side. The boss\
  \ had just snapped another scroll at Kasiya, whose chariot was about to fly right\
  \ over the barge. Two pikemen had one of the other vamps pinned to the deck. The\
  \ third vamp was nowhere in sight. </p> \n      <p>The horses screamed.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Another vamp—this one a patchy-bearded dwarf—came scrambling out from beneath\
  \ the Red Carriage, Arni on its heels. Maybe the garlic collar helped, but I had\
  \ to think anything with half a brain would run from the big wolfhound. Arni was\
  \ so big he could barely squeeze under the carriage as he chased his prey.</p> \n\
  \      <p>I tumbled forward and kicked the feet out from under the former dwarf.\
  \ The creature's momentum threw it across the deck to slide toward the boss, who\
  \ finished snapping another scroll straight up as the chariot passed overhead. Lightning\
  \ crackled above us, but none of it touched the boat.</p> \n      <p>The dwarf vamp\
  \ grabbed the boss's ankle.</p> \n      <p>I winced to see it. A vampire's touch\
  \ was supposed to suck the life right out of you. The boss said that wouldn't happen\
  \ to him, but I wasn't so sure.</p> \n      <p>The boss looked down like he'd stepped\
  \ in something nasty. All casual, he thrust the point of his sword three times into\
  \ the dwarf's head before turning his attention back to the sky, where Kasiya's\
  \ chariot circled back toward the barge.</p> \n      <p>The vampire dwarf rolled\
  \ away, mostly dead. Or dead again. Deaderer. There's got to be a word. I'd ask\
  \ the boss later.</p> \n      <p>A couple of sailors smashed their fire pots against\
  \ the thing. The bucket brigade waited for the vamp to stop struggling before dousing\
  \ the flames. They timed it just right. The river water hit the burning thing just\
  \ in time to turn its ashy skin to mud on the deck.</p> \n      <p>The same thing\
  \ was happening with the vampire skewered by the other pikemen. Their buddies lit\
  \ up the monster, and they held it out over the water until its screams became just\
  \ the sound of its last fatty bits sizzling away. Then they dunked the charred remains\
  \ into the river. The water boiled more from the unholy flesh than from the heat.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The rest of the sailors were still playing tag with the vampire who'd\
  \ taken the darts. The garlic wasn't doing the trick anymore. The vamp had ripped\
  \ the necklace off one sailor and grabbed another one by the throat. The sailor's\
  \ face withered before our eyes.</p> \n      <p>I remembered the boss's warning:\
  \ You don't want those things touching you.</p> \n      <p>I ran two steps, jumped,\
  \ and came down with all my weight on the vamp's knee. The impact felt like kicking\
  \ a pile of rocks, but it annoyed the thing enough that it let go of the sailor\
  \ and came for me.</p> \n      <p>The vamp had already picked my other dart out\
  \ of its face, leaving only a black sliver of a wound. You had to kill these guys\
  \ fast, or they just got back up.</p> \n      <p>\"Finish that one,\" said the boss.\
  \ He ran past us, snapping off scroll after scroll as Kasiya's chariot flew by again.\
  \ I kept one eye on the boss while backing away from the vamp. These things have\
  \ some wicked quickness.</p> \n      <p>The boss's first scroll sent bolts of silver\
  \ at Kasiya, but they splattered like raindrops against an invisible globe. The\
  \ second scroll didn't seem to do anything except cover that magic shield with a\
  \ web of white light before vanishing. The third was a fireball. I expected to see\
  \ it fail as it hit Kasiya's magic barrier.</p> \n      <p>Instead, it exploded.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The chariot dogs fell in all directions as the chariot drew a smoking\
  \ arc above the river. Kasiya and his fancy little cart made it to the Ustalav bank\
  \ before crashing into the woods.</p> \n      <p>\"Good job, boss!\"</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Just then I remembered the riffle scroll the boss told me to use.</p> \n \
  \     <p>The sailors stabbed at the vamp with their pikes, but it dodged them and\
  \ came for me. It hammered a careless sailor to the deck as I got my thumb on the\
  \ scroll's edge. I could smell its decaying breath as I snapped the pages free.\
  \ The scroll tingled against my thumb, and a little cloud of dust blew into the\
  \ vampire's face.</p> \n      <p>The vamp flinched, maybe thinking it would burst\
  \ into flames or start choking on poison. </p> \n      <p>But there was nothing.\
  \ I hadn't cast a spell. I'd only blown paper dust in its face.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ vamp hit me straight in the chest, hard as a mule's kick—and I know what I'm talking\
  \ about when I say that.</p> \n      <p>The blow threw me back into a couple other\
  \ guys. We hit the gunwales tangled together. We all moaned, but when I tried to\
  \ get up I really felt it, like the vamp had put a hole right through me. </p> \n\
  \      <p>Now I can take a punch. Desna knows I've taken plenty before. This one\
  \ knocked more than the wind out of me. I half expected to hear my heart splash\
  \ into the river behind us.</p> \n      <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the\
  \ gray blur of Arni racing toward the vamp. </p> \n      <p>\"No!\" I tried calling\
  \ him off, but he didn't listen. He don't like seeing me or the boss get hit.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Arnisant, down!\" At the sound of his master's voice, the wolfhound\
  \ flattened his body on the deck.</p> \n      <p>A whooping sound cut through the\
  \ air. A whirling silver flash passed through the vamp's neck. Black-red spray covered\
  \ the deck between the monster and me. Its head tumbled off and slid toward me through\
  \ the gore. Startled eyes looked up at me where it came to a rest between my knees.\
  \ Its body collapsed a second later.</p> \n      <p>The Shadowless Sword flew back\
  \ to the boss. He caught it with a casual gesture. As the hilt touched his palm,\
  \ I saw a glimmer of magic. He'd done some spell I'd never seen before. Maybe he'd\
  \ been doing more than \"diplomacy\" with Kyonin's other queen last winter, and\
  \ the scaly old gal had taught him a few new tricks. Probably she'd just let him\
  \ loose in the library, but I can dream, can't I?</p> \n      <p>He wiped the blood\
  \ on the cloth hanging from his scabbard before putting the sword away. I saw a\
  \ gleam in his eye. He was proud of his stunt. Couldn't blame him for that. It was\
  \ a pretty slick move.</p> \n      <p>The crewmen were helping each other stand\
  \ up. One or two were hurt pretty bad, but everybody was alive. That was something\
  \ that didn't happen to us all the time. Desna smiled.</p> \n      <p>Zora Gorcha\
  \ offered me a hand up. Behind her, some of her crew were waking the other guy a\
  \ vamp shook by the throat. He looked thin and gray, but he was alive, with no bite\
  \ marks anywhere I could see.</p> \n      <p>When she saw that all her men had survived\
  \ and her boat wasn't on fire, Zora grabbed my face and planted a garlicky smooch\
  \ on my lips. My knees went all weak, but not from the kiss. Not even from the garlic.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>I'd taken one hell of a hit from that vamp.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  The Count Jeggare, I am thinking he saved your life.\" Zora laughed as she looked\
  \ me up and down. \"Tell me again, Radovan, which of you is bodyguard?\"</p> \n\
