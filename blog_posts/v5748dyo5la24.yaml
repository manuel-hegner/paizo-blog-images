  >Key Largo</a></i></h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 12, 2008 </p> \n\

  \ align=\"right\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"12\"> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>In February\
  \ 2003, <i>Pirate's Cove</i> designer Paul Randles died of cancer. That story didn't\
  \ have a happy ending. This one does.</p> \n   <p>A year earlier, Paul drafted a\
  \ deep-sea diving board game he called <i>Treasure Hunt</i>. Players would salvage\
  \ treasure from shipwrecks off the Florida coast. The game had pop-up boats, and\
  \ little cardboard shipwrecks with treasure disks. Paul wanted a European publisher\
  \ to publish it, but it wasn't good enough yet. A solid 6 on the scale of 1 to 10,\
  \ he said. It better at least be a 9 before it hit the street. </p> \n   <p>Then\
  \ he got sick. I didn't know how to help. My wife did. Evon suggested I ask Paul\
  \ for <i>Treasure Hunt</i>. I'd develop the game with him, and then find a publisher\
  \ to put it out. For the last months of his life, we worked on the game together.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>I gave him a 21-Nerf-gun salute at his funeral, and told the legions\
  \ of game industry folk there that I was shopping <i>Treasure Hunt</i>. It was a\
  \ pretty good game by this point. Maybe an 8. </p> \n   <p>At an Ohio convention,\
  \ I met Bruno Faidutti, the French designer of <i>Citadels</i>. He knew of Paul\
  \ and wanted to help. Within a month he had restructured the game he was now calling\
  \ <i>Treasure Island</i> into a great game. A 9 for sure. Gone were the pop-up boats\
  \ and the cardboard shipwrecks, replaced now by full-size boats and card decks of\
  \ sunken treasure. Now we could find someone to publish it. </p> \n  </blockquote>\

  12\" border=\"0\"> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Every publisher wanted to see the game,\
  \ because Paul had a lot of friends. A major American board game company wanted\
  \ to convert it to a dungeon-crawl game. I thanked them and declined. (Side story:\
  \ Based on this, I did design that dungeon game, with my co-designer James Ernest\
  \ of Cheapass Games. That game, <i>Dungeonville</i>, came out from two more publishers,\
  \ Z-Man Games and Pegasus Spiele. So Paul's game has a son, and he's bilingual.)\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Then Tilsit Editions of France made an offer, which Bruno, Paul's\
  \ widow Katty, and I accepted. Editor Nicolas Anton proposed adding people you could\
  \ meet on the island, the last thing the game needed to become a 10 out of 10. Tilsit\
  \ renamed it <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7ymg\">Key Largo</a></i>, gave it a fancy\
  \ cover and a modular board, and released it in 2005 in German, Italian, and French.\
  \ Which was great, except I don't speak any of those languages very well. </p> \n\
  \   <p>But I do speak English, and I do know Lisa Stevens, the CEO of Paizo Publishing.\
  \ Lisa was looking to start a new line of board games, which eventually I helped\
  \ forge into Titanic Games, the publisher of the color version of <i><a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy7ppe\">Kill Doctor Lucky</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7vq5\"\
  >Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game</a></i>. Titanic needed a third game, so I\
  \ looked at the name of the company and said, \"How about one about sinking ships?\"\
  \ </p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7ymg\"><img src=\"http://paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOTGL/PZOTGL3000_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>How about it indeed,\
  \ she said. And so, in February 2008, five years to the month after Paul's passing,\
  \ Titanic Games will be releasing the full-color English version of <i><a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy7ymg\">Key Largo</a></i>, with all-new art and all-new components\
  \ delivered by graphic designer James Davis. The English edition has a large one-piece\
  \ board, nice wooden boats, fifteen delightful divers, and beautiful cards with\
  \ art from Ben Huen and Andrew Hou. Everyone we've shown it to says it's a work\
  \ of art. I like those people. </p> \n   <p>The game has undergone a lot of facelifts\
  \ since Paul's fun little prototype, but there's something unmistakably Paul-ish\
  \ in the final version. That's why the money in the game bears the inscription \"\
  E Paulibus Unum,\" which I can pretend means \"In Paul We Trust.\" </p> \n   <p>I\
  \ can't play <i>Key Largo</i> with Paul, but now I can play it with you. </p> \n\
