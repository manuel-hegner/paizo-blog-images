  description\">We move from our last international blog in Finland to a relatively\
  \ new Pathfinder Society lodge in Ireland. I met my first Irish players at PaizoCon\
  \ UK last summer and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Venture-Captain Dave Harrison\
  \ and Venture-Lieutenant Rob Silk had been handling the entire United Kingdom by\
  \ themselves and I decided it was time to give them a break. After all, that is\
  \ a huge area. So, after talking to them and they were in agreement, I assigned\
  \ them to solely focus on England while I looked for new regional coordinators in\
  \ Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. It wasn't long before Pathfinder Society veteran\
  \ William Boyle stepped up to assume the Venture-Captain role of Ireland.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Without further delay, I present to you William's report on Pathfinder\
  \ Society in Ireland.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"blurb180\">\n\
  \       <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20130114-Landscape.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20130114-Landscape_180.jpeg\" border=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20130114-Dragon_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n       <br> Illustrations by Francisco Rico Torres and Imaginary Friends\
  \ Studio.\n      </div> \n      <p>My name is William Boyle and I am the Venture-Captain\
  \ for Ireland, both North and South. I am aided and abetted in this by my Venture-Lieutenant,\
  \ Andrew Wilson, along with a dedicated crew of gamers, GMs, store liaisons, FLGS\
  \ owners and managers, games club runners, and long-suffering, significant others.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>I was lucky enough to encounter Pathfinders and Golarion at Gen\
  \ Con UK in England back in 2008. It was great, but back home in Ireland, there\
  \ was not much sign of Golarion on either side of the border. Move forward a couple\
  \ of years and we realised that there was this really cool organized play campaign,\
  \ Pathfinder Society. After a couple of home games we knew this deserved a wider\
  \ audience. So to work...</p> \n      <p>Traditionally, RPGs here were played more\
  \ at games clubs, conventions, and home games than at the limited number of games\
  \ shops. Pathfinder Society has become a big part of the RPG thread at \"Q-Con\"\
  \ in Belfast. \"Q-Con\" is the annual convention of Queen's University Belfast Dragonslayers\
  \ Society, and is the biggest Gaming/Anime con in these islands. Last year we also\
  \ joined the official programme of Gaelcon—Ireland's biggest independent convention—\
  after previous unofficial visits! When we go to conventions we like to get the Hirst\
  \ Arts 3D terrain out to add a little \"preindustrial light and magic\" to the show!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>We have also been lucky enough to run events at local games clubs,\
  \ leading to invitations to go to others. As the word has spread, brilliant GMs\
  \ in other parts of the country such as Nina Hanzlikova and Liam O'Tailliuir have\
  \ run Pathfinder Society at local clubs and conventions! We have run all nighters\
  \ and 24 hours sessions at the Dragonslayers. We even appeared on a segment on the\
  \ excellent www.theadventuringparty.net podcast!</p> \n      <p>Since the start\
  \ of Pathfinder Society, games shops here have begun to spring up that allow games\
  \ to be played on site.</p> \n      <p>In Northern Ireland we have <a href=\"/retailers/TheBlackKnightGamingCentre\"\
  >The Black Knight (Larne)</a> and Creative Destruction (Portadown). In the Irish\
  \ Republic, Pathfinder Society is played at <a href=\"/retailers/GamersHub\">Gamers\
  \ Hub</a> in Maynooth. Additionally, Gamers World in Dublin city centre will have\
  \ it's first Pathfinder Society session in early 2013.</p> \n      <p>In 2013, Pathfinder\
  \ Society will be at the same conventions noted above, but we will also be adding\
  \ Warpcon and Leprecon to the list. The monthly games held at TBK have led to home\
  \ based AP games (now also under the Pathfinder Society umbrella), and at the December\
  \ 2012 game, almost every Pathfinder book, map, and mini on the shelves was snapped\
  \ up.</p> \n      <p>We enter 2013 with high hopes and plans to expand on all fronts.\
  \ Sam Johnston is our Store Liaison (aka Venture Sergeant) in \"Creative Destruction\
  \ Games\" and Gary Bingham the same for The Black Knight in Larne. With these two\
  \ dedicated volunteers, we are lucky to have a top IT gal and guy who are working\
  \ on our home page and player database.</p> \n      <p>I cannot finish without recognising\
  \ the tremendous support that Mike Brock and Dave Harrison have and continue to\
  \ provide. Many thanks, fellas!</p> \n      <p>So if anyone is considering a trip\
  \ to Ireland let us know we'd love to have you over for a game!</p> \n      <div\
