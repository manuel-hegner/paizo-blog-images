  \   </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Well, we're at the halfway point of\
  \ our series of blogs previewing the contents of the forthcoming <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Battles: Ruins of Lastwall</em> prepainted plastic miniature set from WizKids.\
  \ I've shown off the crusaders of Lastwall and their celestial allies, the agents\
  \ of the lich lord known as the Whispering Tyrant, and the extraplanar exemplars\
  \ of balance. Today we take a look at a handful of creatures that aren't necessarily\
  \ involved in the conflict between the tyrant and the people of Lastwall but who\
  \ nevertheless have embraced the forces of darkness.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ <p>Prime among these are the calligni, also known as dark folk, who reside in\
  \ the depths of the Darklands beneath Golarion's surface. <em>Ruins of Lastwall</em>\
  \ features three calligni figures who can make for a variety of challenging encounters\
  \ for parties of low- to mid-level. The Small common Calligni Creeper showed itself\
  \ way back in September and today its companions, the Small common Calligni Slayer\
  \ and Medium common Calligni Stalker. While this leaves a few callignis out of the\
  \ mix (dancers and callers, mostly), it should allow GMs running the newly released\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Module: Cradle of Night</em> to represent some of the allies and\
  \ enemies in the adventure with more accurate miniatures.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Rounding out our Darklands inhabitants for <em>Ruins\
  \ of Lastwall</em> is the Tomb Giant, a Large uncommon figure representing a member\
  \ of this race of subterranean necromancers. It's a good thing they aren't big on\
  \ cooperating with other races, because they would be a terror on the battlefields\
  \ of Lastwall on the side of the Whispering Tyrant!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>All three of the most recent previews of the set have\
  \ shown off at least one outsider, so I guess I won't break that trend. Who better\
  \ to appear in a blog about darkness than a creature from the Plane of Shadow? Here\
  \ we have the Velstrac Evangelist, the most common type of kyton in the setting.\
  \ A Medium common figure, collectors should be able to build quite a squad of these\
  \ chain-bound (called, appropriately a link and a chain, depending on their exact\
  \ number).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-Kyton.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-Kyton_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, a piece of dungeon dressing befitting a kyton:\
  \ a torture rack. Whether you're putting a PC on it to raise the stakes for your\
  \ players or simply setting one in a deungeon to set the mood and show what sort\
  \ of inhabitants might live there.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-Rack.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-Rack_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>That's it for this week, but tune back in next time for\
  \ an infestation of bugs, bug people, and other squirmy wormies you'll find in <em>Ruins\
  \ of Lastwall</em>. Until then, beware of the dark!</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
