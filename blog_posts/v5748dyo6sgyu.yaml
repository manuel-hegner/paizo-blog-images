  \ 2016 to 2018, I wrote a <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy\"\
  >series of articles</a> about the strategy of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game—\
  strategies that remain largely viable with the release of the updated game system\
  \ in <i>Core Set</i> and <i>Curse of the Crimson Throne</i>. I always wanted to\
  \ write some class strategy guides to go with those general strategy articles, but\
  \ I couldn’t figure out who to write about. The <i>Rise of the Runelords</i> characters?\
  \ The Class Deck characters? <i>Every</i> variant of each character?</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Fortunately, the <i>Core Set</i> gives everyone the opportunity to get in\
  \ from the ground floor again—including me, because I can now write class strategy\
  \ guides from the beginning. This article, on the strategy of playing the monk Sajan,\
  \ is the first of four covering the characters used in Core’s Quick-Start scenario.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>For more on Sajan, you may wish to read <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgw0?Core-Design-Sajan\"\
  >Keith Richmond’s</a> article detailing how Sajan was revised and updated for the\
  \ new Core Set.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\

  \ alt=\"Sajan, Character 0: A member of a disciplined caste of warriors in the service\
  \ of the knowledge god Irori, Sajan scours the world for his kindnapped sister Sajni,\
  \ whose martial arts porwess matches his own. He is as comfortable with a tatani\
  \ mat as a temple sword, or his fists that move with lightning speed. Favored Card:\
  \ Blessing.\"></a> \n      </div> \n      <h3>Core Set Sajan</h3> \n      <p><b>Best\
  \ Skill:</b> Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom (d8)<br><b>Character Type:</b> Warrior,\
  \ Melee, possibly Ranged</p> \n      <p><b><i>Skills.</i></b> Sajan has the smallest\
  \ skill range of any <i>Core Set</i> character. He has no d4s, no d10s, and no d12s:\
  \ half of his skills are d6s and half are d8s. That small range isn’t even made\
  \ up for by his subskills: though he has four of them (Acrobatics, Fortitude, Melee,\
  \ and Perception), he’s only +1 or +2 in each. In the end, his only real standout\
  \ skill is Acrobatics, his highest at 1d8+2, and which one of his powers allows\
  \ him to easily buff with blessings. Despite the lack of high skills, Sajan’s lack\
  \ of low skills means that he can be your go-to guy for any task that your party\
  \ is relatively unskilled at: though a d6 isn’t great, it’s better than a d4! Sajan\
  \ overlaps two skills with Harsk (Fortitude and Perception), so they may not be\
  \ the best choice to combine in a party.</p> \n      <p><i>Weaknesses.</i> Sajan’\
  s weakness is writ large in this description: he’s great at nothing. His best skill,\
  \ Acrobatics, has a range of 3–10 (averaging 6.5). Compare that to a less combat-focused\
  \ d12 character like Seoni, who has a range of 3–14 (averaging 8.5) in both Arcane\
  \ and Diplomacy. </p> \n      <p>So how does Sajan overcome this deficit? By blessing\
  \ <i>everything</i>.</p> \n      <p><b><i>Cards.</i></b> Sajan’s best card type\
  \ is unsurprisingly blessings (7, which he can and should quickly pump up to 8,\
  \ 9, and 10). This unfortunately means that he doesn’t get fun and evocative allies\
  \ or spells, but it plays to Sajan’s greatest advantage: the power of blessings.\
  \ Because Sajan won’t usually be using blessings for exploration, he’ll need to\
  \ depend on his allies (3) for that and may alternatively decide to increase the\
  \ count of that card type. Sajan’s biggest card weakness is probably his lack of\
  \ armors (0), a problem that can be resolved some by his damage-reduction power\
  \ feat (and even more by his Exiled Padaprajna role).</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ alt=\"Quarterstaff of Vaulting, Weapon 1. Staff, Melee, Bludgeoning, 2-Handed,\
  \ Magic.\"></a> \n      </div> \n      <p><i>Allies.</i> Sajan’s allies must allow\
  \ him to explore! Secondarily, they should be rechargeable to improve his best skills.\
  \ As an example: the Archer, Mouse, and Raccoon are good choices because they allow\
  \ exploration and can be recharged to improve Dexterity.</p> \n      <p><i>Blessings.</i>\
  \ Sajan should be very picky about which blessings he takes. Cards that allow him\
  \ to freely bless his own skills don’t do much for him, given his innate ability\
  \ to freely bless his combat or Acrobatics. Thus, he needs to look more carefully\
  \ for blessings that will benefit his best skills in other ways, such as Erastil’\
  s “Old Deadeye”, which allows him to bless his Dexterity twice. Alternatively, Sajan\
  \ can try and use his blessings to become less selfish, a problem created by his\
  \ second power. In particularly, he might look for blessings that can be recharged\
  \ when played on <i>other</i> members of the party: the humble Orison is thus a\
  \ pretty good blessing for Sajan, as are the Asmodeus blessings and some level 3\
  \ blessings.</p> \n      <p><i>Weapons.</i> Sajan’s weapon skills will likely fall\
  \ behind his unarmed combat (his first power) over time. That means that his weapons\
  \ should be fallbacks that he uses if he can’t afford to recharge a card for his\
  \ first power. That means that he needs weapons that are pretty good <i>without</i>\
  \ having to discard them: swords (which reload) are a good <i>Core Set</i> choice.\
  \ Of course, if Sajan can get higher-level weapons that use Acrobatics as their\
  \ skill, that’s the best. The Quarterstaff of Vaulting and the Lucky Starknife and\
  \ probably Sajan’s favored options in the <i>Core Set.</i></p> \n      <h3>The Power\
  \ of Blessings</h3> \n      <p>Sajan’s biggest advantage is certainly his paired\
  \ powers that allow him to recharge his own blessings and to freely use some blessings\
  \ on combat or Acrobatics checks.</p> \n      <p><b><i>Bless Extensively.</i></b>\
  \ Because Sajan recharges all blessings that he uses on his own checks, he should\
  \ use them quite freely. Most characters will save their blessings for the most\
  \ important rolls against banes, but Sajan can (and should) expend them for things\
  \ like attempting difficult acquisitions. In fact, he should empty his hand of blessings\
  \ just about every turn: they’ll come back.</p> \n      <p><b><i>Beware of Blessing\
  \ Explores.</i></b> Sajan’s blessings recharge power only works when he plays them\
  \ on his checks, not when he uses them to explore. Thus, he should be very wary\
  \ of using blessings in that way: it takes blessings out of his deck, ultimately\
  \ making Sajan less powerful. Instead, depend on allies for extra explores.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b><i>Be Selfish.</i></b> Similarly, Sajan should be pretty reluctant\
  \ to use his blessings on other players, because those also don’t return to his\
  \ deck. Of course, PACG is a cooperative game, so he might occasionally have to\
  \ help his fellows anyway—which is why he should look for blessings that can recharge\
  \ in that circumstance. The other option for offsetting Sajan’s selfishness is using\
  \ his blessings on himself… to get cool stuff for his friends.</p> \n      <p><b><i>Create\
  \ a Blessing Machine.</i></b> Feel free to discard Sajan’s weapons, items, and allies\
  \ for their special effects. If he ends up with a deck of all blessings, then he\
  \ can play through them each and every turn. (This doesn’t necessarily result in\
  \ “Maximum Game Fun,” but it does result in “Maximum Sajan Efficiency;” balance\
  \ the two as appropriate for your own enjoyment and that of your group.) Do be aware,\
  \ however, that Sajan will be riding a thin line when he does this. A starting Sajan\
  \ with a hand size of five will have a draw deck of only two if he empties his deck\
  \ to just his seven blessings, and that means that death might lie too near. Increasing\
  \ the number of blessings in Sajan’s deck and/or choosing a few additional cards\
  \ to cycle, to bring his minimum deck size up to 10, will make him less vulnerable\
  \ and is suggested.</p> \n      <p>An old, degenerate strategy involved starting\
  \ all the characters at the same place as Sajan, then having the other characters\
  \ each give Sajan a blessing. This isn’t particularly recommended. It’s less effective\
  \ than it was in the previous PACG releases because Sajan is limited to using a\
  \ maximum of three blessings at a time, and it dramatically decreases the Maximum\
  \ Game Fun not just for Sajan, but for everyone.</p> \n      <h3>The Power of Kung\
  \ Fu</h3> \n      <p>Sajan can be a notable combatant even without using a weapon.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b><i>Fight Unarmed.</i></b> With his unarmed combat power, Sajan can\
  \ recharge any card to fight at Acrobatics + 1d6 + the card’s level, which has a\
  \ starting value of 1d8+2+1d6 + card level (with a range of 4–16 + card level and\
  \ an average of 10 + card level). That’s not bad for a cheap combat, and is entirely\
  \ comparable with Sajan’s basic weapon combats: his Dogslicer does 1d8+2+1d6, but\
  \ can be boosted to 1d8+2+2d6 with a discard, and his Starknife does 1d8+2+1d4 and\
  \ can be boosted to 1d8+2+2d4 with a recharge. Of course, unarmed combat’s card\
  \ level will improve with time, and as soon as Sajan takes a power feat to change\
  \ his unarmed combat’s +1d6 to +1d10, he’s definitely notched unarmed combat above\
  \ his weaponry.</p> \n      <blockquote>\n       <p><i>Can Sajan Use His First Power\
  \ When Fighting with Weapons?</i> No. The power begins “For your combat check,”\
  \ so it determines the skill you are using for that check, just as weapons do. You\
  \ can only use one power that determines the skill you are using for a check, so\
  \ it’s either Sajan’s first power or a weapon. (If you want to use Acrobatics with\
  \ a weapon, use something like Dogslicer or Starknife, but you still won’t get that\
  \ extra 1d6 (or 1d10) + card level.)</p>\n      </blockquote> \n      <p><b><i>Bless\
  \ Extensively in Combat Too.</i></b> Whether he uses weapons or not, Sajan’s better\
  \ than the numbers above suggest because he can play up to two blessings on his\
  \ combat or Acrobatics checks, increasing either by 2–16 (average 9). Though an\
  \ unarmed combat of 4–16 + card level (average 10 + card level) isn’t bad, a combat\
  \ of 6–32 + card level (average 19 + card level) that doesn’t <i>permanently</i>\
  \ use any resources, is spectacular.</p> \n      <p><b><i>Take the Extra Free Blessing\
  \ Power Feat.</i></b> Sajan can get even better at combat! The best way to do that\
  \ is to check the power feat that allows him to use a second blessing freely. This\
  \ increases his ability to pump his combat by another 1–8, turning his spectacular\
  \ combat skill into one that’s largely unbounded. You’re now up to 7–40 + card level\
  \ for a low-level character if you temporarily expend three blessings! (The other\
  \ option is to change Sajan’s combat ability from +1d6 to +1d10; it’s nice to be\
  \ able to do that without temporarily expending a card, but it’s only an average\
  \ increase of +2 to the roll, as opposed to +4.5. Mind you, it’s still a good second\
  \ choice, and maybe sooner if you’re having problems with monsters that require\
  \ Magic skills to be killed.)</p> \n      <p><b><i>Become the Villain Killer.</i></b>\
  \ By now, you’re playing Sajan like a combat machine. That should make him a prime\
  \ choice for taking out your villains, henchmen, or other difficult monsters. Send\
  \ him over when a location deck is getting low, and make sure he has a handful of\
  \ blessings.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_SajanRoleExiled.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Sajan, Role 0, Iroran Dedicant: Knowing yourself means first knowing everything\
  \ else.\"></a> \n      </div> \n      <h3>The Sajan Roles</h3> \n      <p>Though\
  \ there are a variety of differences between Sajan’s two roles, the Exiled Padaprajna\
  \ is generally better if you want to play Sajan as a weapons fighter and the Iroran\
  \ Dedicant if you want to play him as an unarmed fighter. The latter plays more\
  \ naturally to Sajan’s strengths.</p> \n      <p><b><i>Exiled Padaprajna.</i></b>\
  \ This is the “weapons master” role for Sajan. It gives him better Melee and/or\
  \ Ranged skills along with proficiencies. It’s not strictly necessary, but you might\
  \ choose it if there’s no melee or ranged weapon fighter in your party, and thus\
  \ those cards would otherwise go to waste. This role also makes Sajan a bit more\
  \ cooperative (since other players can bless him without cost and he can offer them\
  \ damage reduction); and more protected (since he can avoid losing his cards to\
  \ damage). Thus, you might also choose this role if complementary opportunities\
  \ for cooperation are being wasted or if Sajan is getting hurt too much.</p> \n\
  \      <p><b><i>Iroran Dedicant.</i></b> This is the “martial artist” role for Sajan.\
  \ It can make him considerably better at unarmed combat by adding an extra +1d4,\
  \ by allowing rerolls of 1s or even 2s, and by adding bonuses if multiple dice come\
  \ up the same (something that becomes more likely as Sajan adds more blessing dice).\
  \ If you improve Sajan’s combat with the four basic dice changes, he now rolls a\
  \ base of 1d8+2+1d10 + card level + 1d4 and rerolls 1s and 2s. That alone makes\
  \ his basic combat range 11–24 + card level (an average of 17.5 + card level), which\
  \ is quite high, and doesn’t even count his ability to add 1–3 blessings. Mind you,\
  \ this role doesn’t make Sajan any more cooperative and doesn’t make his gameplay\
  \ any more varied.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </div> <!-- tags:  Pathfinder\
