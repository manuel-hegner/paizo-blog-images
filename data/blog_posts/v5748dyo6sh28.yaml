  \   </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The world of\
  \ Pathfinder is one of many gods, entities of unfathomable power with influence\
  \ over every aspect of mortal life. To the average person on Golarion, a prayer\
  \ to a god for good health, good harvests, or protection from harm is an everyday\
  \ tradition. A character’s choice of a patron god can have a huge impact on that\
  \ PC’s background, attitude, and overall flavor. Yet for the player of a PC who\
  \ is not a member of a divine class, the choice of deity has often proven merely\
  \ cosmetic. If you aren’t affected one way or another by the whims of the gods,\
  \ what point is there in following their strictures—in other words, what’s in it\
  \ for <i>me</i>?</p> \n      <p>Theological discussions aside, we’ve added a new\
  \ tool into <a href=\"/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"><i>Lost\
  \ Omens Gods and Magic</i></a> to allow the GM to showcase the gods’ influence upon\
  \ the world, without their actions snatching away the PCs’ autonomy. Called “Divine\
  \ Intercessions,” these take the form of boons and curses, ranging from minor to\
  \ moderate to major in scale, that the gods can grant to those who especially please\
  \ and displease them. While the gods don’t grant these intercessions lightly—otherwise\
  \ everyone in Golarion would be cursed all the time! —they might be potent enough\
  \ to draw an adherent’s prayers in hopes of being blessed… or fearful enough a PC\
  \ might think twice before sacking the local temple!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ cases, Divine Intercessions are reserved for adherents of the god in question,\
  \ who have either pleased their patron deity or committed some manner of anathema.\
  \ Nothing prevents them from responding to a simple prayer from a layperson either,\
  \ however; in this way, we offer the gods more nuanced reactions towards their faithful\
  \ than the often-binary responses that they had in the past. For example, a PC who\
  \ helps out a struggling artist would probably think little of a grateful farewell\
  \ of “May Shelyn bless you!”—yet might later find Shelyn repaying that small kindness\
  \ when it is most needed:</p> \n      <p><b>Minor Boon:</b> Once, when you roll\
  \ a failure on a Diplomacy check, you get a critical success instead. Shelyn typically\
  \ grants this boon only when the Diplomacy check would serve to increase love or\
  \ offer a chance of redemption.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ 13px;\">Art by Klaher Baklaher</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>On the other end\
  \ of the scale, priests or holy warriors of various gods may be forced into sticky\
  \ situations where the most convenient, or even only, method to solve a problem\
  \ is to violate one of their god’s anathema. A priest of Abadar might wind up stealing\
  \ a key in their pursuit of a dangerous lawbreaker—that likely shouldn’t be grounds\
  \ for expulsion from the church or a loss of divine power, but Abadar might make\
  \ his displeasure known until his servant atones:</p> \n      <p><b>Minor Curse:</b>\
  \ Any time you steal, illegally harm or kill another creature, or undermine a law-abiding\
  \ officer or court, a symbol or word describing your crime appears on a visible\
  \ spot on your skin. This symbol cannot be removed or hidden with makeup (though\
  \ it can be covered with clothing) and it doesn’t vanish until you make legal restitution\
  \ for the crime, such as by serving your sentence.</p> \n      <p>The Divine Intercessions\
  \ in this book are simply suggestions, as a godly response can be tailor fit to\
  \ whatever circumstance or prayer provoked it. They provide a strong groundwork\
  \ for how the gods respond to a service or insult, however; Iomedae and Gorum often\
  \ bless or curse weapons and armor, for instance. Asmodeus rains down terrible punishments\
  \ on those who offend him, while Erastil’s boons and curses might not even be noticed\
  \ by those with no desire for a settled life. For those who truly upset the gods,\
  \ there are even curses so powerful they could spawn a legend or a campaign in their\
  \ own right:</p> \n      <p><b>Major Curse:</b> Irori makes all living creatures\
  \ forget your existence. This can be further compounded by raising Irori’s ire,\
  \ resulting in your name being obliterated from all written records. In both cases,\
  \ memories and writings rearrange themselves to omit you smoothly, rather than leaving\
  \ obvious gaps. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20200107-%20irori.jpg\"\

  \     <p>How might your PCs change if they knew the gods were watching? Would they\
  \ still prefer kindly gods who prefer to let mortals forge their own path? Or would\
  \ the temptation of easy boons from evil gods sway them from the light?</p> \n \
