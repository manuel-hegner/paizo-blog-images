  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Michael J. Martinez</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Trouble\
  \ Brewing</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>\"In Cayden's name,\
  \ I bless this brew. May it give strength to the weak and solace to the weary.\"\
  </p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Jeddah Cailean tore a piece of bread off\
  \ the loaf under his arm and tossed it into the vat of cooled barley tea before\
  \ him. He then picked up a small barrel containing the last dregs of a previous\
  \ batch of finished ale, swirled some water in it, and dumped it in as well.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Father, why do we mix the dregs with the new?\" asked Gantren, Jed's\
  \ twelve-year-old son. \"Isn't that ale stale?\"</p> \n    <p>Jed eyed his son up\
  \ and down with a smile. He'd been learning the trade for only a short while now,\
  \ and always had a question in him. That's good—Cayden teaches his people to question\
  \ everything, after all. Jed could see his lanky, blond-haired son would be a very\
  \ good questioner, and hopefully his successor one day. </p> \n    <p>\"These dregs\
  \ contain drops of the ale before it, and the ale before that one, and so on. Why,\
  \ this could have a bit of the very same brew that Cayden himself drank the night\
  \ he ascended to godhood!\" Jed said. \"It's that connection... that's Cayden's\
  \ blessing. Without the dregs, it would take forever to ferment, if at all. The\
  \ ale needs to know where it came from.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And the bread? Is that\
  \ part of the blessing, too?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, Gant, that's just me trying to\
  \ get it to ferment faster, because I've got a temple to run and thirsty patrons\
  \ who want to celebrate the god's bounty,\" Jed said. \"Now, head on downstairs\
  \ and help your mother. We're opening in a bit.\"</p> \n    <p>Gantren nodded and,\
  \ taking care not to disturb anything, left the room. Cayden's Rest, a temple of\
  \ Cayden Cailean in Augustana, was a sprawling affair full of comings and goings.\
  \ But this room, where the vats of barley tea were transformed into ale, had to\
  \ be kept in a very specific state, free of outside influences. It was the heart\
  \ of any Caydenite brew-temple, and it had just the right mix of protection from\
  \ the elements, fresh air, and musty cobwebs needed to create the best ales.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Yes, the cobwebs were important. Jed's adoptive father—an orphan himself\
  \ and the temple's former priest—had told of a time when one of his predecessors\
  \ had cleaned the Chamber of Cayden's Blessings after several decades. The ales\
  \ made thereafter went from exemplary to pedestrian, and thus the chamber was never\
  \ cleaned again. </p> \n    <p>A wizard friend once speculated to Jed that the resulting\
  \ mold and dust in the room could lend flavor to the brews. Personally, Jed simply\
  \ assumed Cayden was a slob, bless his name.</p> \n    <p>With a final, silent prayer,\
  \ Jed left the chamber and walked through the rest of the brewhouse. It was a large\
  \ warehouse, lined with barrels both empty and full, along with the fireplaces and\
  \ vats used to make the barley tea. Sacks of grain and hops were stored on lofts\
  \ in the high-ceilinged room so as to better discourage vermin. </p> \n    <p>Jed\
  \ paused by the casks nearest the door, scanning the shorthand markings chalked\
  \ on the wood. He quickly counted backward, away from the door, and made a few scribblings\
  \ in the small notebook he kept in his pocket. They were running low on the dark\
  \ ale, and they might have to go a few days without the amber next month. The last\
  \ of the past year's wheat beer would probably be gone within a week. </p> \n  \
  \  <p>Some days, it seemed winter wouldn't arrive fast enough. And that reminded\
  \ him to send Gant down to the market for cinnamon and cloves from the spice vendors.\
  \ People seemed to like that in cold weather, for whatever reason. Another note,\
  \ and then the notebook and pencil returned to his pocket.</p> \n    <p>Jed pushed\
  \ open the doors leading from the brewhouse to the kitchen, where a couple of workers\
  \ were busy chopping vegetables. They waved eagerly at the priest, and Jed said\
  \ a very quick blessing over them. The workers were destitute, and like most of\
  \ Augustana's poor, they knew that there was always a chance for work at Cayden's\
  \ Rest. Aside from Jed and his family, the workers were almost all beggars and orphans.\
  \ Jed paid a fair wage and offered a place to sleep in the brewhouse lofts. More\
  \ than a few former workers at the Rest had gone on to better things, which made\
  \ Jed proud. </p> \n    <p>Finally, in the main temple area—which the uninformed\
  \ might mistake for a large tavern—Jed found his wife setting up tables with Gantren.\
  \ Before he could speak, Maeve Cailean launched into business. \"Deggin stopped\
  \ by with your hops while you were in the chamber, love,\" she said, pointing to\
  \ a large burlap sack in the corner. \"Good crop. Smells like lemon and pine.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jed rushed over and, bending over the bag, inhaled. \"Oh, that's nice.\
  \ Deggin's hops are the best this side of Almas.\" He lifted the bag over his shoulder,\
  \ sagging slightly under the weight. \"Might add some to the next batch. Maybe at\
  \ the ten-minute mark? Or five?\"</p> \n    <p>Jed tromped to the back of the temple,\
  \ muttering to himself and leaving Maeve smiling and shaking her head after him.</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>Cayden's Rest was a joyful\
  \ cacophony that night. Sailors fresh from plying the Inner Sea came to celebrate\
  \ dry land once more, and several of them were funded by a small group of bankers\
  \ from the Forester's Endowments—someone's ship had, quite literally, come in. Then\
  \ there were the locals and regulars, along with the rural folk who had brought\
  \ their harvest to market, and the small, huddled groups of armed and armored strangers—\
  adventurers, no doubt, and perhaps a Pathfinder or two. </p> \n    <p>While Maeve\
  \ managed the kitchen, ales, and servers, Jed wandered among the revelers and drinkers.\
  \ He toasted their successes, bestowed Cayden's blessings on those who wished it,\
  \ and occasionally mediated a dispute so that it would not come to blows. Brawling\
  \ wasn't forbidden in the temple-tavern, of course—Cayden himself loved a good bout—\
  but it was ultimately bad for business. </p> \n    <p>Then there were the harder\
  \ cases. Jed convinced one regular that, yes, he really ought to make amends to\
  \ his wife for the past night's drunkenness, and another that her shop's lack of\
  \ profit was ill-served by the woman finding the bottom of her fourth tankard that\
  \ night. Occasionally, Jed would point to the Placard of Wisdom hanging on the wall\
  \ by the hearth, hoping the simple messages there might help those in need. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>All in all, it was a fine night. Until the screaming started.</p> \n\
  \    <p>One of the serving women was the first to let loose with a shrill cry of\
  \ terror. Jed quickly turned and reached for the dagger at his belt—enough of a\
  \ precaution, he felt—and saw an armored man staggering in the center of the room,\
  \ his hands clutching at his throat. Then a gout of blood burst forth from between\
  \ his fingers, spraying the patrons all around him.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-CrisisOfFaith-Silvestrae_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Silvestrae only trusts those who prove themselves.</i>\n   \
  \ </div> \n    <p>Then the man collapsed. </p> \n    <p>Jed rushed over, shouting\
  \ for everyone to clear out of his way. He knew Maeve would immediately stop serving,\
  \ call the watch, and summon the strongest workers from the brew-temple, leaving\
  \ Jed to attempt to heal the wounded man. Jed slid to his knees next to the prone\
  \ man and started praying. </p> \n    <p>\"Cayden, hear me. Harm has come to one\
  \ under your roof. Send your power through me and bind his wound before it's too\
  \ late,\" Jed whispered, closing his eyes and laying his hands over the man's bloodied\
  \ body. Cayden Cailean was not one for rote prayer. </p> \n    <p>Unfortunately,\
  \ Jed was indeed too late, or Cayden was. Either way, the man's hands slid from\
  \ his throat as he breathed his last.</p> \n    <p>The stranger had been slit ear\
  \ to ear. A deft cut, and one that apparently went unseen by anyone else around\
  \ the poor sod; otherwise, there'd be a massive brawl going on right now. </p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Lock the doors and summon the guard!\" Jed bellowed. He turned a woman\
  \ crouching next to him and the dead man, and chanced the question regardless: \"\
  What did you see?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nothing,\" said the woman, a half-elf with a\
  \ distressed look on her face. \"A flash. A bit of shadow. And then Rafe gasped\
  \ and got up and started bleeding. He's dead?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Afraid so.\" Jed\
  \ placed a hand on her shoulder in solace. \"I'm so sorry. You knew him?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>She nodded as a tear fell down her cheek. \"We'd been companions a while.\
  \ Our priest. Lots of jobs. This... this is no way to go.\"</p> \n    <p>A large\
  \ man in light chainmail knelt down next to them. \"Nothing. No track, no trace.\
  \ Not even so much as a blood spatter.\"</p> \n    <p>Jed looked up and saw a half-orc\
  \ wearing the regalia of an Eagle Knight of Andoran. \"You sure? There's a lot of\
  \ blood here.\"</p> \n    <p>The half-orc frowned. \"My friend is dead, priest.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I meant no offense,\" Jed said quickly. \"Just surprised. Maybe\
  \ they used a spell to cloak themselves.\" </p> \n    <p>Jed rose and walked over\
  \ to Maeve, who stood looking worried behind the bar. \"The watch is on the way.\
  \ The boys aren't letting anyone out.\" She took his hand. \"This isn't just a brawl,\
  \ is it, love?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, this is far worse,\" Jed said. \"This was murder.\"\
  </p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>An hour later, the\
  \ watch had come in and cleared the tavern, questioning the thirty or so people\
  \ therein. Nobody had seen anything, of course. It was a thorough job, and the watch\
  \ commander seemed doubtful about finding the murderer.</p> \n    <p>\"They're questers,\"\
  \ the commander said, nodding toward the half-orc and half-elf, who sat in the middle\
  \ of the now-empty room staring silently into half-full tankards. \"Likely went\
  \ afoul of someone who carried a grudge.\"</p> \n    <p>Jed nodded. \"I've fifty\
  \ gold to use for reward money,\" he offered. \"Will that help?\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ commander smiled sadly. \"This was a professional job. Doubt any reward will help.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Once the commander and his men left, Jed went over to the two adventurers\
  \ and took a seat, placing fresh ale before them. \"I'm so very sorry,\" he said\
  \ quietly. \"No one has ever defiled the temple like this.\"</p> \n    <p>The woman\
  \ took the ale and quaffed half of it in one go. \"Yeah, well, they just did. And\
  \ Rafe just paid the price. You need better protection, tavern-keeper.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The half-orc reached over and whacked her on the arm gently—mostly gently.\
  \ \"Show respect, Silvestrae. This is a priest of Cayden Cailean, and his temple\
  \ has suffered as well in this.\"</p> \n    <p>She shoved the knight's hand aside.\
  \ \"Yeah, well, we suffered more, Corogan. We'd been together, the three of us,\
  \ for, what... four years? And now we have to head back to Almas with our tails\
  \ between our legs.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We are not heading back,\" Corogan said. \"\
  We must continue with our mission.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Without a priest,\" she said\
  \ dully. \"That's going to go really well. This is the Nogortha Necropolis we're\
  \ talking about. We need someone who can turn undead.\"</p> \n    <p>A sinking feeling\
  \ stirred in Jed's gut, and he reluctantly looked over toward the Placard of Wisdom\
  \ on the wall, as if it were eyeing him back. </p> \n    <p>Then he went and opened\
  \ his mouth, knowing he'd come to regret it.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
  >∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>\"What do you mean you're going with them?\" Maeve said late that\
  \ night, once all the revelers were dispersed and she and Jed had retired to their\
  \ room above the main temple. \"When's the last time you even left Augustana?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jed stood, hands on his hips. \"I went to the fair two years ago!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Maeve's eyes flared wide as she sat up in bed. \"That is not exactly\
  \ a quest with an Eagle Knight and some half-elf tart. I know, Jed. I did that sort\
  \ of thing once, before I met you and settled down. I like being settled down. I\
  \ thought you did, too. When have you not been settled down?\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's\
  \ not about liking, or even wanting,\" Jed said, his defensive stance sloughing\
  \ off into a slouch. \"This... this is what Cayden is all about. Yeah, he's about\
  \ ale and revelry and helping the unfortunate. But he's also about adventure and\
  \ being spontaneous. We're talking about someone who became a god on a drunken whim—\
  and he demands that kind of spirit from all his followers.\"</p> \n    <p>With a\
  \ sigh, Maeve slumped back down under the covers. \"Look, I love you, Jed, but your\
  \ religion's tenets are written on a placard. A placard that hangs in a tavern we\
  \ call a temple. I can't...\" Maeve's voice caught, and she angrily wiped away a\
  \ tear. \"I don't want to lose you. And let's face it, you're in no shape for weeks\
  \ on the road and fighting undead.\"</p> \n    <p>Jed sat on the bed next to her\
  \ and smiled. \"Thankfully, I can just turn them, right? I'm a cleric of Cayden\
  \ Cailean, one of the greatest forces of good in the world. I can do this.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"But you don't have to,\" she replied. \"You really don't.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"No, I don't. And that's exactly why I have to.\"</p> \n    <p style=\"\
  text-align: center;\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>Jed stood over the trunk that had been stored\
  \ in the attic for years, the key in his hand. Long had he feared that opening the\
  \ chest would release pure chaos into his world. And yet...</p> \n    <p>He set\
  \ the candle down on the floor and worked the key into the lock. The chest opened\
  \ with a stubborn groan, and a musty smell filled Jed's nostrils. He pulled out\
  \ an old, heavy cloak—the vermin hadn't gotten to it, it seemed—and a battered but\
  \ still-whole backpack. Three vials of clear liquid followed, and Jed couldn't remember\
  \ if they were holy water or potions. </p> \n    <p>Then there was the chain shirt,\
  \ which seemed to catch every bit of the guttering candlelight. And the rapier,\
  \ of course. Jed grasped the hilt and pulled it partially out of the scabbard. The\
  \ blade gave off a soft blue-white light of its own. </p> \n    <p>These were his\
  \ father's things, garnered from years of questing and exploring and generally being\
  \ a ne'er-do-well on behalf of a drunken god. Jed's father ultimately had settled\
  \ down and taken over the Rest, but Jed loved his father's tales by the fire. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>The gleaming shirt had been a gift from the dwarves of the Five Stone\
  \ Mountains in honor of his father's valor in battle against orcs. The rapier—one\
  \ that heightened its wielder's accuracy considerably—was from a cache kept by a\
  \ tribe of hill-dwelling giants somewhere... else. Jed couldn't remember.</p> \n\
  \    <p>He sheathed the blade and dropped it into the chest. \"I can't believe I'm\
  \ doing this,\" he muttered. \"Dammit, Cayden. Is this a test? Some sort of trial?\
  \ A bloody joke?\"</p> \n    <p>The darkness around him didn't yield an answer.\
  \ He didn't expect one from Cayden anyway.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
