  ><strong><em>Pathfinder: Gallowspire Survivors</em></strong></a> has officially\
  \ launched into Steam Early Access! Developed by BKOM Studios in partnership with\
  \ Paizo, this roguelite bullet hell survivor game allows you to experience the renowned\

  \ into Gallowspire and confront the legendary villain Tar-Baphon!</p>\n      <br>\n\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>As it exits Early Access, <em>Pathfinder: Gallowspire\
  \ Survivors </em>introduces a host of highly requested features from the community,\
  \ as well as UI improvements, overall gameplay balancing, and Steam Deck compatibility.\
  \ Players may now brave the depths of Gallowspire with a friend in both local co-op\
  \ and Steam Remote Play. Escape incoming damage in a blink of an eye with the all-new\
  \ dash mechanic, and gain run-deciding buffs with a strategic sip from the potion\
  \ belt. With the addition of dedicated chapters, faster character progression, hyper\
  \ mode, and new Pathfinder collectible cards with official artworks that provide\
  \ permanent upgrades, every attempt towards sealing away the disgraced lich-emperor\
  \ brings great reward.</p>\n      <p>Within the depths of Gallowspire lies the disgraced\
  \ mythic lich Tar-Baphon, one of Pathfinder’s most ancient and powerful villains.\
  \ While sealed away beneath his ancient seat of power, he has been deftly plotting\
  \ his grand return. As the magic that contains him begins to fail, three fearless\
  \ heroes will rise to the occasion, tasked with venturing into Gallowspire's depths\
  \ to defeat Tar-Baphon and repair the wards that seal him away.</p>\n      <p>Step\
  \ into the role as one of three daring heroes and battle through the horrors of\
  \ Gallowspire. The Fighter, Wizard, or Rogue all come with their own strengths and\
  \ talents that will aid them in their efforts against Tar-Baphon. Choose an ally\
  \ to fight alongside you as you slay hordes of Tar-Baphon’s undead minions, collect\
  \ and upgrade your arsenal of spells and weapons, and extinguish Gallowspire’s callous\
  \ bosses. There will be many failures throughout your journey, but aided by an ancient\
  \ medallion, the heroes can escape death and grow stronger with each attempt.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Prepare to face Gallowspire's hordes for as long as it takes…<a href=\"\
