  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome friends! We are now\
  \ <em>checks watch</em> about 26 days away from the release of <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02oar\"\
  >War of Immortals</a></em>, and there’s an important question I wanted to answer\
  \ for all of you. Namely, “What is mythic?”</p>\n      <p>For those of you who played\
  \ Pathfinder First Edition or Owlcat’s CRPG conversion of the Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ Adventure Path, you might have an idea. In those games, mythic was an extra layer\
  \ of power and resource that sat on top of your normal character, elevating and\
  \ enhancing them to incredible levels of power via mythic paths, which were not\
  \ entirely dissimilar to Pathfinder Second Edition’s archetypes (assuming you use\
  \ the free archetype variant rules, and all the archetypes were super juiced with\
  \ options that kick the ceiling off the base game!).</p>\n      <p>For <em>War of\
  \ Immortals</em>, we went back to the roots of all the inspirations that went into\
  \ the previous iterations of mythic rules and reimagined them from the ground up\
  \ as a unique storytelling tool to enhance the narrative abilities of Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8445b2cd-7e08-445c-8dc7-c53bbab6a1c0/PZO12006_AMythicStory_2000x1333.png\"\

  \  <br>\n      <p>Mythic adventures take their inspiration from legends, folktales,\
  \ and other storytelling traditions around the world. These tales use wordplay and\
  \ rarefied prose to convey moral lessons and tell stories that often defy logic.\
  \ Mythic heroes and villains, even at lower levels of play, possess fantastical\
  \ powers that are unbound by physics, and their ability to impact the narrative\
  \ of the game world is often much more profound than is typical for a PC or NPC.\
  \ To tell these stories we use five essential elements: Mythic Points, mythic proficiency,\
  \ Callings, mythic feats, and mythic destinies.</p>\n      <p>When you first gain\
  \ mythic power, this is expressed by your mythic Calling. Your calling gives you\
  \ a unique way to spend and regain Mythic Points, makes you exceptionally hard to\
  \ kill, presents you with a set of edicts and anathemas related to the purpose of\
  \ your mythic power, and gives you the special Rewrite Fate ability, which allows\
  \ you to use a Mythic Point to reroll a skill check or saving throw at mythic proficiency.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Mythic proficiency is a proficiency tier beyond legendary. Where legendary\
  \ proficiency gives you a proficiency bonus of +8, mythic proficiency gives you\
  \ a proficiency bonus of +10, and you might be able to use your mythic proficiency\
  \ in specific ways as early as 1st level, allowing you to overcome challenges that\
  \ would normally be far beyond a character of your level!</p>\n      <p>Mythic feats\
  \ give you new ways to utilize your Mythic Points. Many of these expand the types\
  \ of checks or other rolls you can make at mythic proficiency. Others, like the\
  \ Divert Destiny mythic feat presented below, allow you to seize control of the\
  \ narrative and dictate how your story unfolds.</p>\n      <center>\n       <hr\
  \ width=\"75%\">\n      </center>\n      <blockquote>\n       <p><strong><u>DIVERT\
  \ DESTINY [free-action] (FEAT 6)</u></strong></p>\n       <p><em>Uncommon, Mythic</em></p>\n\
  \       <p><strong><u>Trigger</u></strong><u> An attack or effect would reduce you\
  \ to 0 Hit Points or kill you outright.</u></p>\n       <p>You defy the fate before\
  \ you, calling on wells of mythic vitality to sustain your life and allow you to\
  \ persevere. You expend 1 Mythic Point and survive the triggering attack or effect,\
  \ lose the wounded or dying conditions entirely, don’t increase your doomed condition,\
  \ and are conscious and standing with a number of Hit Points equal to 10 + your\
  \ level, regardless of how many Hit Points you had before.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n\
  \      <center>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center>\n      <p>The final\
  \ element of the new mythic rules, mythic destinies, gives you even more fantastic\
  \ abilities and helps enshrine your character with an eternal place in the game\
  \ world. Characters inclined toward cruelty or entropy might gain the apocalypse\
  \ rider mythic destiny and spread war or famine across the world. Benevolent characters\
  \ might instead become an ascended celestial, joining the heavenly ranks as an angel\
  \ or azata to fight evil for all time. Characters with stronger ties to the mortal\
  \ world might become prophesied monarchs or eternal legends, mighty leaders who\
  \ are constantly reborn when the world needs them most. A rare few might even seek\
  \ to complete the mythic destiny of a godling, joining the ranks of ascended deities\
  \ like Irori and Iomedae!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\
