  description\">It's <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks\">Class Deck</a>\
  \ preview time again! Before we dive into the mysteries of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9icp\"\
  >Witch</a>, I want to note that the monthly parade of Class Deck releases will go\
  \ on hiatus for a little while starting in November. We had originally intended\
  \ to put Class Decks on hiatus during the six months that we're releasing <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask\">Mummy's Mask</a>, but production delays\
  \ earlier in the year caused the <em>Summoner Class Deck</em> to slide into October\
  \ alongside the <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbg\"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbh\"><em>Character Add-On Deck</em></a>. We're therefore\
  \ starting the hiatus a month later than we had intended.</p> \n    <p>Now, on with\
  \ the hexing.</p> \n    <h2>Witch Design Brainstorming</h2> \n    <p>We knew even\
  \ before we started designing this deck that we wanted to do a version of the witch\
  \ that played up familiars, and we already had the cohort technology to do it. We\
  \ looked at the critters available to witches, to see what we wanted to do in addition\
  \ to Daji, and the following exchange occurred:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Mike</b>:\
  \ Let's see... they've got access to the standard wizard familiars, so bat, cat,\
  \ rat, weasel, toâ€”<br> <b>Tanis</b>: I JUST SEARCHED FOR \"FAMILIAR\" IN THE BESTIARIES\
  \ AND FOUND A DINOSAUR <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/bestiary2/dinosaur.html#dinosaur,-compsognathus\"\
  >THEY CAN HAVE A DINOSAUR FAMILIAR</a> WE'RE DOING IT WE'RE DOING IT<br> <b>Mike</b>:\
  \ Hold that thought.<br> <b>Tanis</b>: Don't make me go get Gary.<br> <b>Mike</b>:\
  \ Okay, fine, we're doing it.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Behold the compsognathus:</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-Compsognathus.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-Compsognathus_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <i>That's also the face I made when I saw the art.</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>As you can see, we decided to give the cohort some strategic implications\
  \ by moving the witch's casting skill onto the familiar. This cleanly models the\
  \ notion that witches gain their power through a pact with a patron represented\
  \ by a familiar. The deck has several cohorts, and the non-Feiya characters get\
  \ to choose which familiar they'll use at the start of each scenario. (Feiya has\
  \ already chosen Daji, of course, but those of you who are QQing about that should\
  \ look into her Beast-Bonder role.)</p> \n    <h2>New Characters</h2> \n    <p>In\
  \ addition to a cohort-ified version of Feiya, we've added Kasmir, an itinerant\
  \ healer who overcomes prejudice with his magnificent hair and many belts. Kasmir\
  \ likes to use power efficiently, and his hex is similar to a selfish version of\
  \ the original <a href=\"/products/btpy92zk\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Character\
  \ Add-On Deck</em></a> Feiya's.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-KasmirFront.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-KasmirFront_360.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-HedgeWitch.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-HedgeWitch_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Kasmir is all heals, all the time. Cure spell in my discard?\
  \ I'll take that. Get wiped out off-turn? No worries, I can still draw a card to\
  \ get my heal off. He's fun to play and easy to kill, like so many of my favorite\
  \ characters in the ACG.</p> \n    <p>We've also got the Blue Person, as the forums\
  \ have noticed. She is indeed a Samsaran, and her name is Raheli.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-RaheliFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-RaheliFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-NightHairedWitch.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-NightHairedWitch_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The other thing that made me all-caps at the design team\
  \ early in this process was the White-Haired Witch archetype. This archetype lets\
  \ you fling objects at your enemies with your friggin' hair. If I had that power\
  \ I would spend all day chucking pens, dice, and small action figures at my office-mates\
  \ Vic and Lissa, so it's probably a good thing that magic isn't real.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Raheli's pretty much a one-trick pony, but since that pony is named Make Sure\
  \ We Collect All the Boons, I think she's a pony you'll enjoy. Well, that got weird\
  \ quickly. Onward!</p> \n    <h2>Creepy Dolls</h2> \n    <p>Since we're fond of\
  \ designing cycles these days, I threw a set of creepy dolls into the Witch Deck\
  \ that have a few different abilities.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
  \    <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-HauntedDoll.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-HauntedDoll_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6815-AngelicDoll_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>It's got a ruined eye that's always open...</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Since we're Paizo, we already had several creepy doll illustrations laying\
  \ around, and they basically designed themselves. They sit there for a turn, do\
  \ their creepy thing, and then act like spells.</p> \n    <p>The <em>Witch Class\
  \ Deck</em> comes out at the end of the month. <a href=\"/products/btpy9icp\">You\
  \ can preorder yours here!</a></p> \n    <p>Tanis O'Connor<br> <i>Adventure Card\
