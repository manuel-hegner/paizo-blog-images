  \ the Headless King!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, August 13, 2008</p>\
  \ \n    <p>There's more in the multiverse than just the deities of Golarion's civilized\
  \ races. Amid the near endless realms of the Great Beyond lurk wonders and horrors\
  \ beyond the imaginings of mortals, beings deserving of worship, and terrors of\
  \ which no man was ever meant to know. </p> \n    <p>In addition to the twenty most\
  \ prevalent deities of the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting, the next tome\
  \ in the Pathfinder Chronicles line, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81ts\">Gods &amp;\
  \ Magic,</a> sets its sights on the heavens and hells. From the serenity of Nirvana\
  \ to the tortures of Abadodn, the deific inhabits of realms beyond the mortal sphere\
  \ come to life. Along with familiar allies like Cayden Cailean and Desna, and soul-thirsty\
  \ nightmares like Lamashtu and Zon-Kuthon, <i>Gods &amp; Magic</i> reveals a host\
  \ of new godly patrons and immortal perils. For example, legends of the scalefolk\
  \ tell of one Ydersius, know to those who slither as the Headless King... </p> \n\
  \    <p>Ydersius (The Headless King): This ancient being was the patron god of the\
  \ all-but-forgotten race of snake-men that battled mighty Azlant and lost. Forced\
  \ to hide in the Darklands with his mortal servants, the Serpent King was decapitated\
  \ by a mighty champion, but such was the power of the god that he remained alive\
  \ in two pieces. Now his mindless body thrashes recklessly, and his head is lost\
  \ and presumably rotted away to a skull. But there are some that say the skull still\
  \ thinks and can control a tiny measure of power, and if it and the body were ever\
  \ reunited, Ydersius would heal and lead his people in an attack on the surface\
  \ world. </p> \n    <p><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81ts\">Gods &amp; Magic,</a> scribed\
  \ by the newest addition to Paizo staff, theologian Sean K Reynolds, hits the shelves\
  \ in October. </p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider <br><i>Pathfinder</i> Managing Editor\
