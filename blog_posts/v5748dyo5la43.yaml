  date\">Tuesday, October 30, 2007</p> \n   <p>Ever thought about trying to break\
  \ into the gaming industry, but have no idea where to start? Now's your chance!\
  \ Starting at the end of October, paizo.com will host RPG Superstar, the first adventure\
  \ game industry design contest voted on by the fans, aimed at finding the newest\
  \ talent in RPG design. </p> \n   <p>\"With the end of the print editions of <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines, Paizo has lost a conduit to find new designers,\"\
  \ says Lisa Stevens, Paizo's CEO. \"We're launching a RPG design contest to give\
  \ unknown talent a chance to get noticed!\" </p> \n   <p>Starting on October 31,\
  \ 2007, any eligible person will be able to submit an entry into the contest. For\
  \ the open call, that entry will be a wondrous item using the 3.5 SRD. Each entry\
  \ needs to be 200 words or less, and must include all of the proper mechanics and\
  \ flavor. Judges will announce the top 32 entries on November 28; those contestants\
  \ will advance to the first round of public voting, where they will be assigned\
  \ a new design task and their entries will be posted on paizo.com for the public\
  \ to read, critique, and vote on. The designers garnering the most votes will continue\
  \ on to subsequent rounds, and the ultimate winner will earn a paid commission to\
  \ write one of Paizo's upcoming <a href=\"/gameMastery/modules\">GameMastery Modules</a>!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Paizo has gathered together three judges to oversee the competition. Paizo's\
  \ Publisher, Erik Mona, will share the spotlight with fan-favorite author and <i>Kobold\
  \ Quarterly</i> publisher Wolfgang Baur, as well as Necromancer Games co-owner Clark\
  \ Peterson. Each round, these judges will critique the entries before the public\
  \ vote. </p> \n   <p>The fans themselves will decide which talented designers go\
  \ on to the next round by casting a vote on paizo.com for their favorite contestant.\
  \ Each round includes a six-day window for fans to discuss the entries and cast\
  \ their votes. After the open call round ends, the next rounds will proceed as follows:\
  \ </p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Top 32: Design a country <br>Top 16: Design a\
  \ villain (complete with stat block) <br>Top 8: Design three thematically linked\
  \ monsters <br>Top 6: Design an encounter <br>Top 4: Submit a full adventure proposal</p>\
  \ \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>The winner of the first RPG Superstar contest will\
  \ be announced on February 20, 2008. </p> \n   <p>Complete rules and entry form\
  \ are available at <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">paizo.com/rpgsuperstar</a>. Do you\
  \ have what it takes to be the next RPG Superstar?</p> Go to <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\"\
