  \ of the Archonate</i></h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 19, 2010</p> \n\
  \   <p>I'm happy to announce that Planet Stories' latest release, <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy8b8o\"\
  ><i>Template: A Novel of the Archonate</i></a> by Matthew Hughes, has hit the Paizo\
  \ warehouse and is now shipping to subscribers. As I mentioned in an earlier blog\
  \ post, <i>Template</i> is the most recently written novel that Planet Stories has\
  \ published, and we're extremely proud to be offering it to readers in the States\
  \ for the first time. It takes the best of that sense of wonder and adventure that\
  \ we look for in all the fiction we publish and combines it with the crisp prose\
  \ of a modern master of the genre. And it's a novel that I think both gamers and\
  \ general SF readers can sink their teeth into with great enjoyment—the book's hero\
  \ is, after all, a professional duelist on the gaming world of Thrais. Perhaps it's\
  \ no coincidence that Matthew Hughes's work has been compared favorably with that\
  \ of living SF legend Jack Vance, author of The Dying Earth series, which inspired\
  \ the magic systems for the world's most popular fantasy roleplaying games.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Now, for some instant gratification, here's an excerpt from the novel's\
  \ exciting opening.</p> \n   <p><i>En garde!</i></p> \n   <p>Christopher Paul Carey\

  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Chapter 1</b></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>The tall\
  \ skinny one and the one with the shaved head kept circling to Conn Labro's right.\
  \ When they came at him their attack was well coordinated, the points of their epiniards\
  \ darting in at different angles, aimed at different parts of his body. Now they\
  \ came again and Conn timed the double parry exactly, riposted against the skinny\
  \ one so that he had to block the thrust in a way that hindered his partner's recovery.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But it was the third opponent who bothered him. The fat one kept circling\
  \ widdershins to the others only to leap into the fight seemingly at random, not\
  \ thrusting but flailing with the long thin epiniard while shouting what sounded\
  \ like nonsense syllables. Conn would have to duck or leap back in an ungainly manner.\
  \ Then the other two would come smoothly in and he would have to flick and click,\
  \ parry and thrust again, trying to find their rhythm then turn it against them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He soon realized that there was no rhythm to be found. The fat one was\
  \ actually very good. He was capable, as very few are, of a truly asymmetrical attack,\
  \ able to resist the unconscious urge to find a rhythm with his partners.</p> \n\
  \    <p>It was turning out to be an interesting contest. Conn surmised that the\
  \ three must have practiced against a simulation based on some of his past fights.\
  \ He knew that his employer, the impresario Ovam Horder, sold such artificial experiences\
  \ to those who could never afford the fee required to meet Conn in the flesh or\
  \ by remote connection. The trio must have augmented the simulation by factoring\
  \ in other matches recorded from public performances, then using sophisticated means\
  \ to meld all into one.</p> \n    <p>Now here came the two coordinated attackers\
  \ once more, but this time there was a tiny disharmony to their movements. The skinny\
  \ one was a quarter-beat behind his partner, meaning Conn must extend his parry\
  \ an equally small interval of time past perfection before binding the skinny one's\
  \ blade and sliding the point of Conn's epiniard over the wrist guard.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>As he executed the move, he expected the fat one to come in swinging and burbling\
  \ from his blind side. Instead, as Conn turned his head enough to bring the third\
  \ man into his peripheral vision, he found the rotund attacker silently sliding\
  \ toward him, crossing the smooth floor on his plump belly, the point of his weapon\
  \ aimed at Conn's ankle.</p> \n    <p>Again, Conn had to make a less than graceful\
  \ escape, leaping clear over the supine swordster, only to find the other two rushing\
  \ at him once more. But they came on two different tangents this time, their flexible\
  \ blades whipping and thrusting from all angles, so that Conn must exert near maximum\
  \ speed to beat off the attack. And meanwhile, the fat one was coming in between\
  \ the others, but this time he was actually on his knees, again aiming for Conn's\
  \ ankles.</p> \n    <p>Conn felt a flash of irritation and automatically summoned\
  \ the mental exercise that dissipated the feeling. He heard Hallis Tharp's voice\
  \ speaking from his memory: <i>He who loses his temper loses all</i>, and again\
  \ he spoke within his mind the syllables of the Lho-tso mantra that restored calm.\
  \ He flicked his point at the fat one's eyes, knocked away the bald man's thrust\
  \ and sidestepped a slash from the thin one. He had to give the three of them credit\
  \ for a novel strategy: they had known they could not win on skills—they were adequate\
  \ swordsters, but even three of them were no match for one of Bay City's premier\
  \ house players—so they had instead closely analyzed Conn's temperament. They must\
  \ have thought that if they could annoy him enough, if they could bring him to anger....</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The three were preparing for another attempt. He saw their eyes signal\
  \ to each other as they readied themselves, and he looked closely at the fat one.\
  \ And there it was, plain to be seen: the calculation behind the seeming randomness,\
  \ and the way the man looked at Conn from the corner of his eye, weighing up the\
  \ results so far.</p> \n    <p>Conn realized how the bets must be laid. That was\
  \ why their attacks lacked true brio and why the fat one behaved like a clown. They\
  \ were not out to win, nor even to draw, which would have been the best they might\
  \ expect. Instead, they were intent on annoying and frustrating him to the point\
  \ where he departed from his legendary equanimity. He smiled. The moment his lips\
  \ showed his amusement he read the signs in the others' faces and knew he had won.\
  \ They stepped back and lowered their epiniards. \" Will you continue?\" Conn asked.</p>\
