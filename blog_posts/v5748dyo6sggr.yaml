  \ of April's Pathfinder Battles: Ruins of Lastwall set from WizKids, we saw the\
  \ amassed forces of good defending the world from the Whispering Tyrant's minions.\
  \ Those are all well and good (pun intended) for PCs and their allies, but what\
  \ fun toys does the set hold for GMs?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \

  \  <p>The lich's primary agents are the Whispering Way Cultists, depicted here as\
  \ a Medium common figure. The most nefarious aspect of the Whispering Way is that\
  \ its cultists can be hidden among any population, secretly advancing the Whispering\
  \ Tyrants' goals. When discovered, however, the vassals of undeath fight viciously\
  \ to see their plans through to fruition.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  >\n     </div> \n     <p>As numerous and threatening as Whispering Way cultists\
  \ are, they pale in comparison to the Tyrant's undead minions. While many of these\
  \ are mindless skeletons and zombies, often raised from the fallen legions of his\
  \ vanquished enemies, these hordes need leaders. One powerful undead creature often\
  \ serving in this role is the Murderous Undead, a Medium uncommon figure.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190118-MurderousUndead_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>Not all skeletons are mindless, however, and despite their\
  \ lack of vocal cords, lips, and lungs, they often speak for their lich lord, proclaiming\
  \ the tyrant's edicts in conquered lands or acting as envoys to potential allies.\
  \ The Skeletal Speaker, a Medium uncommon figure, makes a great skeletal diplomat\
  \ or even a spellcasting skeletal champion.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  >\n     </div> \n     <p>While the remains of mortals make excellent potential servitors,\
  \ sometimes the agents of undeath need more powerful help from beyond the borders\
  \ of this reality, in which case they might summon or make a deal with an outsider\
  \ like a thanadaemon. These deacons of the Horseman of Death, Charon, ply the waters\
  \ of the River Styx, ferrying souls through Abaddon. Thanadaemon is a Medium rare\
  \ figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190118-Thanadaemon_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>Last, we have the ultimate undead, or rather the premier\
  \ undead, for she was the very first soul to escape the River of Souls and extend\
  \ her existence outside the normal cycle of death and rebirth. Yes, Urgathoa, Goddess\
  \ of Undeath makes her Pathfinder Battles debut in this set as a Medium rare figure.\
  \ Wielding her imposing scythe and exemplifying both the decay of undeath and the\
  \ debauchery of gluttony, it is to her glory the Whispering Tyrant and all his undead\
  \ minions do their sinister work. All hail Urgathoa! All hail the Pallid Princess!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190118-Urgathoa_500.jpeg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>Game Masters looking to add some scenery to their undead\
  \ encounters should be excited by another piece of dungeon dressing from Ruins of\
  \ Lastwall, the Stone Cairn, a remnant of a culture now as dead as the corpse or\
  \ corpses buried beneath it. When the gravestones or burial markers from the Cemetery\
  \ of the Fallen don't quite fit your needs, consider using a Stone Cairn instead.</p>\

  \ for a look at the champions of balance stuck in the middle of the war for the\
  \ souls of the Inner Sea. I'm pompously psyched to show them off!</p> \n     <p>Mark\
