That's only about 80% true; our summers (starting a little before <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>) are quite beautiful and warm.

Apparently this month's scenarios got the memo, and both involve a swelteringly welcome break from the northern hemisphere's winter.</p> 
               <p>In the first, author Nicholas Wasko takes us down to the rough-and-tumble port of Bloodcove, the heart of Aspis Consortium activity in the Mwangi Expanse. <a href="/products/btpy9y4k?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-15-The-Bloodcove-Blockade"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9–15: The Bloodcove Blockade </i></a>is a Tier 3–7 scenario that continues an ongoing storyline that began in Season 8. The Consortium's up to its usual tricks of exploiting the Mwangi Expanse's mineral and cultural resources, but lately the organization's taken an interest to a particular site in the Kaava Lands. The catch? Much like how tree roots anchor the soil, these ruins and the surrounding jungle have kept a powerful fiend locked away. As a result, the Society's trying to shut down the Consortium's imminent strip-mining scheme for more than just ecological conservation. That means sneaking into Bloodcove to sabotage the operation, and the Exchange faction's itching to leverage its economic muscles to blockade the port and strangle out the Consortium's dangerous plans. Naturally, Exchange faction PCs have a special opportunity here, courtesy of Guaril Karela.</p> 
               <p>Nicholas Wasko's done a nice job with this adventure, which involves lots of urban danger, a dash of intrigue, and a lot of dealing with fun NPCs. What I really appreciate here is his attention to detail in portraying Bloodcove, which straddles the silt-choked Vanji River and is built atop an extensive grove of mangrove trees. Not only does the mangroves' flavor play an important part in several encounters—such as with the illustrated Erwyn Harvacus, leader of a druid circle who keeps the ever-growing mangroves from swallowing the city—but it's also beautifully depicted in the scenario's custom map by Robert Lazzaretti.</p>

               <p>Of course, it's no surprise when traveling toward the equator leads to warmer weather. We're playing a fantasy RPG, aren't we? Where's the supernatural weather? Where's the ritual to inject the sweet relief of spring into winter's cold clutches? Look no further than <a href="/products/btpy9y4j?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-14-Down-the-Verdant-Path"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9–14: Down the Verdant Path</i></a>, a Tier 1–5 scenario by Scott Sharplin. Ever since <a href="/products/btpy9ch0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-15-The-Overflow-Archives"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6–15: The Overflow Archives</i></a>, we've known that Scott has a special talent for telling stories with whimsical themes, and #9–14 is no exception. <a href="/products/btpy9y4j?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-14-Down-the-Verdant-Path"><i>Down the Verdant Path</i></a> takes the PCs to Andoran, where they must untangle the secrets behind a strange weather phenomenon: in the middle of winter, there's a verdant explosion of summer weather! The PCs' journey takes them into the depths of the Verduran Forest and beyond, introducing them to a host of "colorful" characters like the gnome Azure (pictured here).</p> 
               <p>What else is special about <i>Down the Verdant Path</i>? It's the first ever adventure to include a Concordance of Elements (i.e. "the Concordance") special faction opportunity! Back in December <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lkbr?Introducing-the-Concordance-Faction">we announced the new Concordance faction</a>, dedicated to maintaining the elemental balance of the cosmos, studying the multiverse's natural complexity, and calming areas of elemental instability. For the Concordance's debut, we wanted to reinforce that the faction's more than just a "nature faction" eager to hug pixies and high-five druids. No, this organization recognizes that even natural forces can grow wildly out of control and require intervention, and that's just what you get to do in this scenario. We're excited to see how the faction grows and what you think of it.</p>

               <h2>Guide and Faction Journal Cards</h2> 
               <p>An updated version of the <a href="/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide"><i>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</i></a> is now available on the website. Not only has Linda Zayas-Palmer put in a lot of work updating several major sections (including the spell hierarchy for buying scrolls and the retraining class synergies), but there's also now a faction entry for the Concordance, complete with five new faction traits. We've also updated the Season 9 <a href="/products/btpy9dgw?Pathfinder-Society-Faction-Journal-Cards"><i>Faction Journal Cards </i></a>with a Concordance card. Thanks, Linda!</p>

Of these ideas, perhaps none stood out more than one fateful thought I threw into the mix after reading about Eox: "What if we have the Starfinders take part in a reality TV show?"</p> 
               <p>Welcome to <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme"><i>Starfinder Society #1–09: Live Exploration Extreme</i></a>! Written by Paizo's own, John Compton, this scenario had one of the most attention-catching premises that we came across during the time when we sat down to pitch the 2017/2018 scenario roster. I knew it was a success when during the process, we went through discussing each of the scenarios, got to this one, and John ended the conversation with a quick "Ok, I'll write this one."</p> 
               <div class="blurb180">
                <a href="/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180228-WazashaKevir.jpg"><img src="/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180228-WazashaKevir_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Well John, after so many times writing scenarios for you… THE TABLES HAVE FINALLY TURNED!</p> 
               <p>Joking aside, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme"><i>Live Exploration Extreme</i></a> is an important scenario for several reasons. First off, it's back to basics in terms of being a Tier 1–4 scenario. Second, it brings the Starfinder Society back into the mysterious false moon of <i>Salvation's End</i> that we last explored in <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Special-100-Claim-to-Salvation"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1–00: Claim to Salvation</i></a>. Finally (at least for what I can describe in this blog), this scenario brings the idea of celebrities and icons to the forefront of Starfinder. I would highly suggest that if you have a character with the Icon theme or are even slightly interested in dabbling in the realm of "stellar celebrity" that you give this scenario a shot!</p> 
               <p>Much of what occurs during this scenario is a spoiler-filled minefield, so rather than talk too much about the plot, I want to talk about media overload. A camera crew accompanies the PCs during most of this adventure, and if that weren't enough, the PCs need to put on a good show in order to impress influential Society allies (who may or may not have an exclamation point in their name, similar to the title of this scenario). Be aware that this scenario plays off a lot of tropes of modern reality TV, replete with moments for PCs to embellish their combat actions to set up "just the right shot" or even take some time after combat to privately reminisce (or harshly critique) the actions of fellow party members inside "the booth." More than most scenarios, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme"><i>Live Exploration Extreme</i></a> is about consent; the goal is to have a fun time and not have players feel out of place because of themes or rules of the scenario. The scenario makes sure to spell this out to the GMs, so for players concerned about the potential media and social overload associated with reality TV, I would still consider giving this scenario a shot—after all, sometimes it's the one quip from the character who's said nothing else the entire episode that defines a show! This scenario has no scenario tags.</p> 
               <p>Looking ahead to March, we have <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9y4l/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-110-The-HalfAlive-Streets"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-10: The Half-Alive Streets</i></a> and <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9y4m?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-111-In-Pursuit-of-the-Scoured-Past"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-11: In Pursuit of the Scoured Past </i></a>which I've just finished my development pass on. While I want to keep all those secrets until next month's preview, I think both scenarios include some standout stories that should engage new and veteran Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild players. Past these two (yes, next month begins our publishing two scenarios per month) we start getting into a wide array of new scenarios that lead into the quickly approaching convention season…</p> 
               <p>Speaking of convention season, I think I need to get back to development! There's a lot of exciting stuff coming up in just the next few months. Also, be on the lookout for a post in the coming weeks discussing our season transition and plans taking us past the summer convention season.</p> 
               <p>See you on the other side of the Drift.</p>

               <p><b>PS:</b> Special shout-out to Paizo's Customer Service Manager, Sara Marie, for helping to inspire this month's scenario. I first discovered the joys of combining reality TV and tabletop RPGs when I played in her Survivor-themed game during a past PaizoCon. Of course, I may have rose-tinted memories of that game because of how many times my character managed to snag the immunity idol…</p>

               <div itemprop="articlebody">
                At PaizoCon 2017, <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/rpg">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> launched a new form of multi-table interactive special (usually shortened to just “a Special”).

As we explored new ways to provide Specials to more conventions—particularly to those taking place between January and May, by which point many people have already played the big Special that debuted at Gen Con the previous year—we developed <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899A-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A"><i>Pathfinder Society Special #8–99: The Solstice Scar</i></a>, a modular Special comprised of numerous 90-minute-long parts that can be swapped out over time to tell an evolving story.
                <p></p> 
                <h2>How does “The Solstice Scar” work?</h2> 
                <p><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899A-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A"><i>The Solstice Scar</i></a> consists of three 90-minute chapters, called <b>parts</b>, and each time we swap out an older part and add a newer one, we release a new <b>version</b> of the adventure. At PaizoCon 2017, we released Version A (aka #8–99A), which consisted of Parts 1, 2, and 3. About a month ago we sent out Version B, which consists of Parts 1, 3, and 4. Each new version's repeats that process, removing one older part and adding on a new part. That means that if you play all versions of <i>The Solstice Scar</i>, you'll experience some parts several times while also experiencing new content.</p> 
                <p><b>“Season Agnostic”:</b> One of the key design goals was to create a story that could stand on its own. <i>The Solstice Scar</i> does not interact directly with any of the season storylines, instead telling its own epic narrative. </p> 
                <p><b>Replay:</b> Playing <i>The Solstice Scar</i> multiple times does suggest that someone can play it multiple times, right? That's right, specifically each version of this Special is considered a separate adventure for the purpose of reporting. That means you can earn credit once as a player and as a GM each time we release a new version. What's more, that also means that the same character can play and earn credit for each version; there's even a boon with a niche cumulative award.</p> 
                <p><b>Restrictions:</b> This Special is playable in any venue that can field the minimum 3 tables. That makes it an excellent fit for everything from large conventions to smaller local events.</p> 
                <p><b>Retirement:</b> Each version of <i>The Solstice Scar</i> is only playable for a limited time (approximately 6 months). Once a new version of the adventure's released to the public, the previous version is retired from play. There is a possibility that we'll release a combined 6-part version after Part D is out in the wild for a while.</p> 
                <p><b>Exclusivity Windows:</b> Each version has approximately a 6-month life cycle. When a new version is first ready, it's available only to spotlight events for a window of about 1–2 months; you won't be able to buy it during this time, and during this period, people can play both that version and the previous version. After that, the new version's available to the public and playable for another 4–5 months. I've provided more exact dates in the Timeline section below.</p> 
                <p><b>Access:</b> If your event would benefit from running <i>The Solstice Scar</i>, particularly during the summer exclusivity window for Version C and the January exclusivity window for Version D, contact your Regional Venture Coordinator.</p> 
                <p><b>Authors:</b> This modular structure also allows us to bring in several authors over the course of the storyline. Andrew Hoskins wrote Parts 1–4 when we first outlined the story, and Kalervo Oikarinen is concluding the narrative with Parts 5 and 6.</p> 
                <p><b>Versions:</b> There are four versions of <i>The Solstice Scar</i> scheduled.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Version A (Parts 1, 2, and 3)</li> 
                 <li>Version B (Parts 1, 3, and 4)</li> 
                 <li>Version C (Parts 3, 4, and 5)</li> 
                 <li>Version D (Parts 4, 5, and 6)</li> 
                </ul> 
                <h2>Timeline</h2> 
                <p>Here's how the dates break down for <i>The Solstice Scar</i>. The exclusivity window for Version D includes some approximate dates that we'll be locking in over time.</p> 
                <p><b>May 28, 2017:</b> Version A launched at PaizoCon, beginning the exclusivity window.</p> 
                <p><b>August 4, 2017:</b> Version A featured at Gen Con, after which the exclusivity window ended. The Special became available for any qualifying events.</p> 
                <p><b>January 12, 2018:</b> Version B features at numerous conventions worldwide, beginning the exclusivity window. During this time, Version A is still playable at all venues.</p> 
                <p><b>February 21, 2018:</b> The exclusivity window for Version B ends. Version A is retired.</p> 
                <p><b>May 27, 2018:</b> Version C launches at PaizoCon, beginning its exclusivity window. During this time, Version B is still playable at all venues.</p> 
                <p><b>August 6, 2018:</b> Version C features at Gen Con, after which the exclusivity window ends. Version B is retired.</p> 
                <p><b>January XXXX, 2019:</b> Version D features at numerous conventions worldwide, beginning the exclusivity window. During this time, Version C is still playable at all venues.</p> 
                <p><b>February XXXX, 2019:</b> The exclusivity window for Version D ends. Version C is retired.</p> 
                <h2>Feedback</h2> 
                <p><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899A-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A"><i>The Solstice Scar</i></a> is a neat experiment that's worked out fairly well so far, and we're always open to feedback on how we can adapt the model to continue providing great multi-table experiences. Let us know what you'd like to see and where the Society should go for its next big story.</p>

                <p class="date">Thursday, February 22, 2018</p> 
                <p><i>This is the fourteenth installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href="http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml" target="_blank">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a href="/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy">here</a>.</i></p> 
                <p itemprop="description">Building a party is only half the story; you also want to improve those characters over time. This article talks about how to do so in a general way, then next month's article focuses on thinking about precise cards (and traits). Most of this general advice is strategic, affecting overall play.</p> 
                <h2>Start with the pregen decks</h2>  
                <p>It might seem like strange advice, but it's often best to begin inefficiently. If you start with the pregenerated deck for your character, listed in the rulebook, then you have great ground to build from: you can spend the "Basic" adventures, which don't give out many feats, adapting your deck to your own liking.</p> 
                <p>(This also has the benefit of making it really easy to start your first game.)</p> 
                <p><i>Corollary #1: If cards aren't fun, dump them.</i> But don't go too far. If it looks like a card is never going to get used and doesn't add to your fun, dump it. The goal of this starting advice is to make the early parts of your PACG campaign more fun, so make sure that's what happens.</p> 
                <h2>Assess what characters need before each game</h2>  
                <p>At the start of each scenario, review your characters' weaknesses and what categories of cards might help them. These might be group-wide inadequacies, such as insufficient healing or inability to deal with traps. More likely, they're weaknesses in your own character, such as not having leveled up your combat cards or having items that just aren't that useful. Use these needs as a guide for play throughout the session.</p> 
                <p><i>Corollary #1: Make card needs a priority in location choice.</i> Once you've determined what sorts of cards your characters could benefit from, consider positioning them at locations that are full of those cards—though do so as part of a total strategy for choosing locations, as outlined in "<a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljdt?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Strategy">Choosing Location Decks</a>."</p> 
                <h2>Tag-team your deckbuilding</h2> 
                <p>Remember that this is a cooperative game. You should help other characters get what they need. When you discover a gap among your skills, or a character that needs a specific sort of card, your next step should be to determine who can best acquire those cards. Then send them in! You can always trade cards at the end of the game.</p> 
                <p><i>Corollary #1: Toss cards that are useless to you into your discard pile.</i> You should never be afraid to toss cards that are clogging your hand into your discard pile. This is particularly true when you acquire a card for someone else, and it's not that useful to you.</p> 
                <h2>Make deckbuilding a priority in play</h2> 
                <p>In order to constantly improve your characters, you need to make sure that deckbuilding is a priority in your play. Send characters to locations where they can get stuff that your party needs, then consider spending blessings or playing other good cards to make sure they get that good stuff. It shouldn't be your first priority; that should be winning. But it should probably be your second priority, and something that you're always considering.</p> 
                <p><i>Corollary #1: Make deckbuilding the first priority if you're losing.</i> If you're already losing, why not making deckbuilding the first priority? Talk with your group, and if you decide your current mission is hopeless, refocus on getting as many boons as you can before the timer runs out.</p> 
                <p><i>Corollary #2: Perhaps making deckbuilding the first priority if you're running behind.</i> This could be controversial, but sometimes you may want to go into a game with a losing attitude. If you feel like your characters are behind the curve and haven't picked up enough of the more recent cards, then you're likely to be losing some games in your near future anyway. So, why not cut to the chase and start going after boons now? If you get lucky and close some locations, then you can reassess.</p> 
                <p>You can also play a few tactical tricks to improve your overall deckbuilding.</p> 
                <h2>Purposefully void a category during play</h2> 
                <p>You can improve your group's decks by purposefully creating a void in a category of cards. It works like this: one or more characters have bad cards in the category; you don't collect anything new for the category during the adventure; and you banish some of the bad cards through play. For example, you can void items by using up potions, you can void armor by using their banish effects, and you can void spells by casting them without the right skill. Some locations also require card banishment. At the end of the game, you will then be able to choose specific cards from the box to fill that void.</p> 
                <p>This is probably only worthwhile if you realize midgame or later that you're not acquiring a card type. But, if that's the case, consider taking advantage of it.</p> 
                <p><i>Corollary #1: Use card feats to create voids.</i> It's even easier to create voids during adventures where victory gives you a card feat. You can take card feats in categories where you're short on cards or have just enough, and that will instantly allow you to draw from the box!</p> 
                <p><i>Corollary #2: Push on this tactic starting in adventure #3.</i> This advice isn't that strong while you're working on the first two adventures, because you can only replace voids with Basic cards. But, starting in adventure #3, you can retrieve any card from two boxes earlier. That's the deckbuilding jackpot for this tactic.</p> 
                <h2>Be careful what you take</h2> 
                <p>If you're purposefully voiding a card category, be careful what you take. You don't want to fill that carefully constructed void with some card that you don't care about. Remember that when you encounter a boon, <i>you do not have to try and acquire it</i>. Just reject it if it would fill a void (unless you really need the hit point).</p> 
                <p><i>Corollary #1: Also reject Basic and Elite cards late in the game.</i> Rejecting cards is also good advice late in an adventure path when Basic and Elite cards are removed from the game when you banish them. Reject them and they'll be gone instantly; this will also improve your long-term deckbuilding, because it will improve your pool of cards.</p> 
                <h2>Don't give characters cards that will get stuck</h2> 
                <p>Here's another way to be careful about what you take. When you're rebuilding decks, don't give characters cards that will get stuck in their hand, clogging it for a whole game. What this means is different for different characters. If a character can recharge (like Lem) or bury (like Amiri) or discard (like Lirianne), they can get anything out of their hand. But, if a character instead has to depend on the actual cards for deck cycling, then be sure to give them lots more recharging cards, particularly allies, armors, and (if it's possible) items.</p> 
                <p>I've got one more article for this series, which is going to talk about specific types of cards to acquire. I hope to see you back in a month to bid my strategy discussion bon voyage.</p>

                <p>You can fill out an event form for each event you'd like to submit. If all of the details are the same and you want to run it multiple times, you only need to fill out the form once. (If you represent multiple GM's who will be running the same event you only need to fill out the event form once).</p> 
                <p>If you save the link when you have submitted your event, you should be able to go back and edit your submission until March 1st.</p> 
                <p>We have reduced the length of event descriptions to 150 characters. Once the schedule is posted online, you will be able to post in your event's discussion thread with more details.</p> 
                <p>Paizo will not be running Organized Play events during the 1pm-6pm time slots. We will be offering the use of part of the Grand Ballroom for individuals who wish to run organized play scenarios during this time. If you wish to do this and be included in the PaizoCon schedule which lets attendees sign up for the game online and reserves you a table, you can submit an event using this form. Note that Saturday's time slot will be 1pm-5pm and all attendees must leave the room promptly at 5pm so hotel staff can set up for the PaizoCon Preview Banquet. Please format Starfinder and Pathfinder Org Play scenarios as #[season][scenario number]: Title (example: #9-01: The Cost of Enlightenment).</p> 
                <p>We can't wait to see what fantastic events the community comes up with this year, so don't delay. Submit your event <b>before March 1</b>, when the submission window closes. </p>

                <p>Well, when you venture into the <a href="/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair"><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a> in May, I advise you to take allies in addition to your swords, boomerangs, bombs, and whatnot. And when you build your expedition party, you're going to need some miniatures to represent them. That's where today's blog comes in!</p> 
                <p>What jungle expedition is complete without a ranger to cut a path through the thick underbrush, to listen to the calls of nearby fauna warning of pending danger, or to gauge the best time and place to make camp during the annual monsoon, when the threat of flash flooding could ruin your much-needed 8 hours of rest. Enter the human hunter, a Medium uncommon figure, and your savior when you need a high roll on that next Survival check. Equipped with a ghillie suit, soft leather boots, and a knocked arrow ready to let fly, the human hunter won't make a sound as she blazes a trail to adventure at your side!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-HumanHunter.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-HumanHunter_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>"But," you might inquire, "what's our guide's final destination? Where are we going?" Why to find that lost <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lkge?Dressing-on-the-Side">magic anvil from the blog two weeks ago</a>, silly! And who better to accompany such an expedition but the dwarf explorer? No one. There is no one better. If you don't believe me, this curmudgeonly companion will remind you at every opportunity. He's clearly planning on doing some spelunking, what with his rope and grappling hook, but even aboveground he stands to be a stalwart ally with his short sword and heavy crossbow. The dwarf explorer is a Medium rare figure.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-DwarfExplorer.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-DwarfExplorer_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>Rounding out the party is some magical support—a companion capable of deciphering ancient runes and dispelling arcane wards that protect your prize from plunder. The human arcanist looks like he could hail from the esteemed magical academy of the Magaambya deep in the heart of the Mwangi Jungle, where acolytes of Old-Mage Jatembe still mix the traditions of arcane and druidic magic to keep the forces of evil at bay. And if his magic fails, he can always literally throw the book at his enemies. Look at that thing! It has to weigh 20 pounds! The human arcanist is a Medium rare figure.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180219-HumanArcanist.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180219-HumanArcanist_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>When the dangers of the deep jungle become too much for even these capable adventurers to handle, they can always call upon the help of outsiders (maybe that giant book is full of true names used for <i>planar binding</i> and other summoning spells). But the arcanists of the Magaambya would never treat with the likes of devils or demons. Only the forces of good are, well, good enough for our magic warriors! The azata wilder, a CR 6 outsider capable of being summoned via <i>summon monster V</i>, relishes the thrill of battle, and would be more than happy to come to your aid. Since higher level variants of the spell could result in as many as 1d4+1 of the azatas, this is a common figure, enabling you to represent an entire host of Elysian archers on the battle mat. As a Medium creature with distinct elven features, the figure can also serve as a player character in a pinch—I could see this as an aasimar or a sorcerous elf arcane archer with the celestial bloodline.</p>

                <p>Next week we'll look at the antithesis of today's previews: creepy, crawly creatures from the dark places of the earth (and at least one outer plane), as well as a thematically related piece of dungeon dressing! I look forward to continuing the conversation with you then, friends!</p>

                <p>Cayden's tankard, this book is something else! Not only does it have information about a tavern's menu and owner, there's also a map for some of these bars! And it even tells you about a tavern's customers! I wouldn't want my patrons to find out about this, that's for sure.</p> 
                <p>I can't say as I've been all around the Inner Sea, but I did my fair share of traveling before I bought this place. Let's see if I've heard of any of these places.</p>

Don't you believe it! After a few mugs of their pink hibiscus punch, I pulled a chair over to that hunk of rock and planted one right on its mouth. The next thing I remember is waking up in a nearby stable with my face in some camel's fur! True, I later bought that camel and she got me alive out of a number of scrapes in the Parched Dunes, but I wouldn't call that true love!</p> 
                <p>Oh, and here's the Porthmos Club over in Taldor! Full of snooty nobles who wouldn't give the likes of you or me a second glance if they saw us on the street. But they still need a place to drink and gamble, don't they? Ha! I was actually a senator's aide for a day in Oppara—that's a story for another time—and had to purchase a brand-new doublet just so they would let me in. And with my own coin no less! Truth be told, that was the finest bar I've ever been thrown out of.</p> 
                <p>I can't believe it, this book even has the rules for a handful of pub games! Why, I haven't played bootbeer in ages. I think I have an old dented helmet in the back from my days in the Molthune militia if you want to go a few rounds. Beer's on the house! No? Suit yourself, then.</p> 
                <p>Well, friend, I have to tell you that this book is amazing. I wonder who took the time to put this together. No matter. Say, before you leave, keep an eye out for this pale half-elf that's been skulking around town. He's nothing but trouble. There's a sketch of him on the notice board, but you really can't miss him—I don't think he's ever covered up his chest in his life!</p> 
                <p>Cheers!</p>

               <p class="date">Monday, February 12, 2018</p> 
               <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
                <p itemprop="description">We're now a full month into our journey through the <a href="/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair"><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a>, the next set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures from WizKids, and this week I get to show off some of my favorite figures in the set. So without further ado, let's begin!</p> 
                <p>As long as humanity has stood on the edge of the jungle and peered into the darkness beneath the impenetrable canopy, the imagination has created as many phantasmal dangers as actually exist in the unforgiving environment. But not all of these dangers are primeval, unthinking beasts that see explorers as little more than a potential meal. Many, in nearly every culture and mythology, exist to protect the untamed, untainted regions of the world from humanity's encroaching influence.</p> 
                <p>The first such creature in <em>Jungle of Despair</em> is the couatl, a lawful good staple of fantasy roleplaying games that takes its inspiration from the Aztec god, Quetzlcoatl, who is often referred to as "The Plumed Serpent." As such, the couatl is a mighty, mystical flying serpent with wings the color of a jungle bird's plumage. Couatls make for great protectors of jungle ruins or sacred sites for their ability to aid the adventurers, but only if the interlopers can convince the winged serpent of their true intentions and veneration for the purity of the unaltered wilderness. The couatl is a Large uncommon figure.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Couatl.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Couatl_360.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>Similarly, nature spirits from the First World, the capricious realm of the fey, often serve as protectors of portions of the Material Plane. Comprised in large part of dense undergrowth and ancient trees, jungles make for the perfect habitat for dryads, each of whom is linked to a specific tree and given dominion over a particular copse or grove. The dryad in <em>Jungle of Despair</em> is a re-posed version of the reclining dryad illustration from the <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>, and thus can be used in nearly any wooded environment, from a palm tree in a desert oasis to a lone evergreen high atop a mountain vista. The dryad is a common Medium figure.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Dryad.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Dryad_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>Often filling a niche similar to that of a dryad but found in other environments beyond the woods is the enigmatic nymph, a paragon of natural beauty who uses her charms to bend would-be defilers of the wild to her will. Also based on the primary creature illustration from the <a href="/products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>, the nymph has been given some clothes in her miniature iteration, in the form of a seaweed skirt. With a pair of starfish stuck to her legs, she makes a great protector of seaside grottoes or isolated beaches but can still easily fit in anywhere that nature needs a steward. The nymph is a Medium common figure.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Nymph.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Nymph_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>Mortal protectors of the natural world are no less powerful and intrinsically tied to the land, as in the case of the elf druid, a Medium common figure perfect for either a player character or in a cabal of Green Faith worshipers. In fact, the illustration used as reference for this figure was the Green Faith druid in <a href="/products/btpy8lvb?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Faiths-of-Balance"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Faiths of Balance</em></a>; now where could his hawk animal companion have gotten off to?</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-ElfDruid.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-ElfDruid_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>Finally, we have a guardian not born or spawned by the raw power of nature itself, but rather created with arcane magic and set to a specific, ceaseless task by its master: the clay golem. As a construct, this Large uncommon figure has no natural habitat, and thus can serve campaigns set in ancient jungle ruins, high-magic metropolises, and everything in between. While a clay golem can take any shape its creator molds it into, the iconic Pathfinder clay golem (and thus the miniature) has a hulking humanoid form and the head of a jackal, giving it a decidedly Egyptian feel, making it equally appropriate for use in the moldering pharaonic tombs of the Osirian desert.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-ClayGolem.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-ClayGolem_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>That's it for this exciting installment of <a href="/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair"><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a>! Be sure to tune in next week for a look at some of the player character-appropriate figures in the set. Until then, roll high, Pathfinders!</p>

               <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
                <p itemprop="description"><i>We continue our series of Pathfinder Adventure Card Game fans telling us who the best character ever is. One of our playtesters, Eliandra Giltessan, gives us a sneak peak at the iconic medium from <a href="//products/btpy9u08?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Occult-Adventures-Character-Deck-2"><em>Occult Adventures Character Deck 2</em></a> that has her over the moon.</i></p> 
                <p>People who know me may be saying, "What?! I thought you said <i>Alahazra</i> was the best character!" A year ago, that was true. Alahazra <i>was</i> the best character ever—in a world without Triggers. I recall when Skull &amp; Shackles' version of Alahazra hung out at the Wishing Well and took all the boons from locations decks. Or <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season2">Season of the Runelords</a>, where the <a href="/products/btpy9ezo?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Oracle-Class-Deck"><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>'s Alahazra examined nigh on entire location decks with a Scrying and a Headdress. Sigh. Good times.</p> 
                <p>But, my friends, we live in a world of Triggers. Gone are the days of "I only need one attack spell in my deck, right?" Now when Alahazra scouts, sometimes the cards bite back. She's still great, but there's room for the new best character ever: Erasmus.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Erasmus.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Erasmus_360.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>At first look, Erasmus may not look like much. All d8s and d6s, with Arcane just d8+1 and Perception (of all things!) at d6+3. Well, let me tell you, Occult characters can do more with Perception than just defeat Camouflaged Pit Traps without rolling. They can fight and recharge and tell their Dwarf Mindblade friend to go kill things for them.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-KineticBlast.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-KineticBlast_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Mindblade.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Mindblade_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>Let's move onto powers, cuz Erasmus has got some great ones! I'm developing an appreciation for characters who give you something to do with the junk cards you pick up, and Erasmus can bury his to change his results <i>after</i> the roll. No missed-by-1's with Erasmus, and when he overkills that Pit Trap with his massive Perception, he can coax away the consequences. His next power is the one I love oh-so-much: recharging boons at the start of your turn to add to all checks that turn. Not only does this make for great deck cycling, but it really takes the sting out of those early scenarios when you have no skill feats. That last power mentions something called "Spirit Relatives," and you may ask, "What does that mean?"</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-SpiritRelativesFront.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-SpiritRelativesFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-SpiritRelativesBack.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-SpiritRelativesBack_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>Ah, well, you see, Erasmus can channel the spirits of his dead relatives, and at the beginning of each scenario, he can pick one to give him some new skills and an extra d4 plus the adventure deck number. So when Grimslakes are threatening to eat your deck if you don't make a Fortitude check, you can pick Nissa. When you need to make an Acrobatics check, or when the villain makes you cry in a corner with no cards in your hand, you can ask for Baylock's help. After a power feat, you can even help other characters at your location.</p> 
                <p>"But Eliandra," you may say. "I'm stuck with one of these spirits for an entire scenario. That's not very versatile."</p> 
                <p>"Relax," I say to you. "We need to save something for roles." You see, Erasmus's roles allow you to put more than one marker on the card. Personally, I'm a fan of the Storyteller. Bury a card for a second token? Yes, please!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Storyteller.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Storyteller_360.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>After all this gushing, you may still have your doubts as to whether this all <i>works</i>. Can Erasmus have one deck of cards and still be effective at all his roles? <i>Yes</i>. His powers more than make up for the small dice size, and the cards he doesn't otherwise need at the moment become the fuel to charge them. Erasmus is the first character where I put my skill feats in different skills every time, and I love it. He's the most versatile character I've seen, and he once closed two locations in his first turn armed only with a Force Missile and a Light Crossbow.</p> 
                <p>Vote Erasmus: Best Character EVER!</p>

                <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
                <p>While at MarsCon in Williamsburg, Massachusetes, I had the distinct pleasure of awarding Campaign Service Coins to three long-time volunteers. Each of these individuals held a venture-officer position, as well as spent time and effort in their local regions growing the Society and their RPG communities. They received their coin as well as a new organized play number in recognition of their service.</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>#784—Joe Mathos<br> #785—Paul Reese<br> #786—Mike McKeown</p> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p>If you know a deserving member of your community, please email me at organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, location, and the reasons you feel they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please include what events they may attend in 2018. This is especially helpful if they will be at an event with a member of the organized play team (see further down the blog for that list of events.)</p> 
                <h2>Stars and Novas</h2> 
                <p>This month we only have one new addition to the 5-star GM roster. They earned the accolade earlier, but communication errors kept them from being listed in prior blogs. My apologies on the delay and huge congratulations on achieving your fifth star.</p> 
                <p>To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>

                </blockquote> 
                <p>Last month, the team solicited feedback from the community on what requirements should exist for a Starfinder Society 5-nova GM. I've compiled the responses and will discuss the issue with the rest of the org play team over the next few weeks. Once determined, we will include the information in a future update blog.</p> 
                <h2>Conventions</h2> 
                <p>First quarter 2018 contains many conventions for player's enjoyment. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information! If you know of a convention running Society games that is not on this list, encourage the organizer to contact me at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss their event.</p>

                <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2> 
                <p>The PaizoCon organizing team and I are finalizing the PaizoCon 2018 organized play schedule, working on processing the volunteer questionnaires, and sending out status emails to all individuals that completed the form. Gen Con organizing team is sending out the first batch of acceptance emails this week, so volunteers know their status before the housing lottery opens on Sunday. We have confirmed with Gen Con that GM badges do not qualify for the housing lottery, so if you are wanting a room but not qualifying for one through the Society, I encourage you to pick up your badge asap! The Origins organizing team and I are working on the event schedule and are preparing to post the general Call for Volunteers blog in the next week.</p> 
                <h2>2018 Organized Play Staff Travel</h2> 
                <p>Last month, I added a column to the convention list to show which events the organized play team planned on attending. While helpful, it didn't allow for much pre-planning, since event support requests submissions tend to be 1-2 months before the event. So this month, I've pulled together a list of all events in 2018 that will have an organized play staff presence. A few are listed as TBD and there may be some changes, as who attends depends on workloads and availability, but this is our currently planned itinerary.</p> 
                <p>If you are an event organizer and want to invite us out at your event in 2019, drop an email to organizedplay@paizo.com before next summer. We review our schedule in the fall and try to get all decisions wrapped by the end of the year.</p>

                <p>With this scenario, the PCs travel to a mostly unexplored oceanic world in the Vast. The Starfinder Society once set-up a forward outpost on the world, only to hastily abandon it shortly after the complex came online. Now, the planet is the only known source of a rare mineral required to repair the Society's most storied starship, the Master of Stars. It's up to the PCs to visit the planet and reclaim the sunken lodge. Of course, things aren't always as easy (or difficult) as they appear, and the lodge has some new occupants...</p> 
                <p>Kate Baker makes her debut as an author for Organized Play with Sanctuary of Drowned Delight. Once I assigned the outline, Kate went to work at creating some truly unique creatures. The term "psychedelic walruses" soon became a common term when discussing this scenario. In fact, you can see one of these creatures (who prefer to be called morlamaws) in this blog post's attached art preview. The morlamaws are an entirely new species debuting in this scenario—one of the cool avenues we can explore in Starfinder Society is the introduction of new species to the setting. I suspect players are going to enjoy the morlamaws quite a bit, if only because alien space walruses are pretty rad. I'm sure players will also enjoy morlamaws for other reasons... but you'll need to play this scenario to find out!</p> 
                <p>This scenario uses the Faction (Wayfinders) scenario tag.</p> 
                <p>While I'm still in the flurry of outlining summer scenarios, there's a lot of upcoming content to get excited for.

                <p itemprop="description">As the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant">Ruins of Azlant</a> sink below the waves, a new age dawns across the Inner Sea. Discord is coming to Taldor. More accurately: the discord that has simmered quietly just beneath the staid surface of Taldor is ready to boil over, and consume the remnants of the once-great empire. Taldor's end is in sight, and has been for a thousand years. The end may be a generation away, or a century, or an age, but always it closes.

And victory means changing how a whole nation thinks. Victory means winning the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown">War for the Crown</a>.</p> 
                <p>War for the Crown began two years ago, as an idea I pitched as part of the meetings that eventually led to <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion">Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path</a>. I wanted players to feel like they had some real stake in the future of the Inner Sea region, but the worry at the time was that my first AP should be something more traditional while I learned the ropes. I put my notes in a drawer and a year later I brought them back out, and this time I dug my feet in. This time I wanted to tackle one of my first loves of the Inner Sea: Taldor! And I wanted the PCs to help flesh out this maligned and oversimplified nation—seen as little more than laughable aristocracy stereotypes—into a complex nation on par with Andoran and Cheliax. I wanted Taldor to have a future and I wanted the PCs to help guide it there.</p> 
                <p>And that's what we got.</p> 
                <p>The final War for the Crown evolved a lot from those first notes. In my first draft, the PCs chose one of three inheritors to back, and the adventure text itself would abstract the adventure a little more, referring to the major NPCs as the Patron, the Ally, and the Adversary. As much as I loved this idea, the problem is that it means about 1/3 of each volume would be useless to any given group (and no I couldn't make the books any longer; I asked). It also caused problems in not being able to flesh out specific NPCs very well, since any given NPC would need to serve one of three masters. Eventually we started asking which of the three candidates would be the "canon" inheritor of the Primogen Crown, and opted to focus the entire AP around working for them.</p> 
                <p>That "canon" inheritor, who now ends up your patron, was Princess Eutropia. Not exactly shocking, given that we've teased her revolutionary leanings and political goals since the original <em>Pathfinder Chronicles: Campaign Setting</em> back in 2008. The lady's worked hard and wants try steering Taldor away from its 600-year status quo of slow ruin, and there are more than a few traditionalists who think she hasn't earned it, or that she has sinister motives, or just that a woman needs to know her place. Grand princess Eutropia going into the second decade of Golarion's existence doesn't just move the timeline forward, it means Taldor becomes a nation of tradition vs. progress and old vs. new, a nation of backroom political intrigue where fortunes and family fates hang in the balance. Not just a stagnant world of laughable, foppish nobles.</p> 
                <p>And if your group doesn't particularly want to back Eutropia for the throne? If they want to select their own candidate or make their own grab for power? The core plot of War for the Crown is (hopefully) designed to still be flexible enough that a GM can adapt to a different inheritor taking center stage for their campaign. The foreword for <em>#127: Crownfall</em> has a few notes and suggestions for adapting the campaign to your own table.</p> 
                <h2>Interchangeable Pieces</h2> 
                <p>One of the big goals for War for the Crown was a campaign with a lot of fun player options for tables to use or ignore depending on their own preferences. Several adventures use the various social combat and influence rules from Pathfinder: Ultimate Intrigue, but GMs should feel free takes the NPC personality notes and goals and let their tables simply play out dramatic scenes. Volume 2 introduces two special subsystems to capture two different aspects of Taldor: The Cults of Personality—so PCs can feel like movers and shakers all on their own—and the Relics system—which introduces magic items that grow stronger as their wielder accomplished great things on behalf of their people. Social, scheming tables will find the first system a delightful little distraction between game sessions, directing their psychophants and hangers-on to spy, spread word of their awesomeness, or rob the public blind. More combat-oriented tables will love the second, as your favorite sword or armor or ring grows cooler and more powerful just like your character does. Neither is central to the AP plot. Both suit the mood.</p> 
                <h2>Humanity and NPCs</h2> 
                <p>One of the challenges in a campaign built around intrigue and politics is finding motivation and personality for everyone involved, as almost anyone can serve as a friend, an ally of convenience, or an enemy, depending on a given table. Everyone needs a little personality and motivation, because hey, who isn't above a bribe? I had wanted to get rid of alignment altogether, because the nine-alignment system seemed overly simplistic for the complex moralities that lie at the heart of good political dramas, but apparently the alignments are "traditional" and "integral to several spells, class features, and monsters."</p> 
                <p>I tried guys.</p> 
                <p>Instead I've opted for showcasing little bits of NPC motivations and personality. Maxillar Pythareus might be a distant asshole who thinks women should be at home bearing kids, but his face brightens up if you want to talk war history and miniature wargames. Kalbio of Breezy Creek might be kind of an annoying hick, but dammit if he isn't just SO INVESTED in everything, because Oppara is SO BIG you guys. And Eutropia, the sophisticated dilettante, the respectable princess-come-social reformer? She is exactly the kind of nerd who would name her dog a pun.</p> 
                <p>As part of humanizing the characters, the running theme for this AP's foreword illustrations is showing where they came from: A major NPC's childhood illustrated, largely without comment, in each volume. Here are the first three.</p>

                <p>War for the Crown is an Adventure Path with very human opponents and very human consequences. Failure doesn't mean the apocalypse, just a continuation of Taldor's current course and slow decline. Someone may change things in the future, but those who suffer in the current system won't stop suffering until someone changes Taldor's course.</p> 
                <p>War for the Crown kicks off in just a couple weeks with <a href="/products/btpy9u09?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-127-Crownfall">Pathfinder Adventure Path #127: Crownfall</a>, and you can still preorder or subscribe now!</p>

                <p>This morning we passed what can only be interpreted as a warning—a clear suggestion to TURN BACK! I mean, look at this skull pole. Look at it! Don't tell me that doesn't freak you out.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>But did we heed the warning? Of course we didn't. And the result was a nice trip to the bottom of this fine obstacle. That's some welcome mat! See that blood on those spikes? Yeah, you guessed it—that's mine. I much prefer my life-sustaining bodily fluids remain on the inside, thank you very much.</p>

                <p>And all this for some magic relic supposedly lost in dwarven ruins deep in the heart of the jungle? I didn't even know there were dwarves in the jungle. I thought they liked caves and canyons and dark, dry places. This place is anything but that! Still, ancient legend of the magic anvil claims that anything forged upon it will be flawless in form and unbreakable in construction. That's worth all this trouble, right? Right?</p>

                </div> 
                <p>What the others don't realize, however, is that anything we find in the heart of this humid hellscape we must carry with us the many miles back to civilization. And we came for an ANVIL! Maybe I can use it to forge myself a wheelbarrow. In the meantime, everything we find goes into this trunk case. It looks like it'd be right at home on the deck or in the cargo hold of a jungle river barge, doesn't it? It's less appealing strapped to my back while I wade through thigh-deep, leech-filled muck, though, believe me.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Who am I to complain, though? I get to live the dream, the life of an adventurer. I get to venture into the untamed wild, and plunder whatever treasures I find there, left unguarded for millennia. Huh? Nature isn't unguarded, you say? There are forces protecting it and its bounty from exploitation? Great, I guess I'll just have to talk about some of those next week.</p>

             <p itemprop="description">As an actor and a fan of nerd culture, I have been blessed in many ways for the past three years. One way, and how some of you might recognize me, is that I was honored to be part of a show called “Dragons and Stuff” all last year. It is now “Dragons and Things,” and we play a homebrew campaign live on Friday nights for our dedicated, wonderful fans. I am also blessed by playing Yukon Cornelius in the national tour of “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, the Musical,” based on the the ani-magic movie, every November and December. It is a blast. However, the drawback to having these two exhilarating jobs is time constraints. I cannot do both at the same time. But this year, I decided to combine my two worlds into an experience I will never forget.</p>

                 <p>As an actor and a fan of nerd culture, I have been blessed in many ways for the past three years. One way, and how some of you might recognize me, is that I was honored to be part of a show called “Dragons and Stuff” all last year. It is now “Dragons and Things,” and we play a homebrew campaign live on Friday nights for our dedicated, wonderful fans. I am also blessed by playing Yukon Cornelius in the national tour of “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, the Musical,” based on the the ani-magic movie, every November and December. It is a blast. However, the drawback to having these two exhilarating jobs is time constraints. I cannot do both at the same time. But this year, I decided to combine my two worlds into an experience I will never forget.</p> 
                 <p>I knew I wouldn't be able to exist without Pathfinder for two months. Playing consistently for so long ignited my passion for the story. I loved being a PC and feared becoming the evil, soul-stealer that led the group. But when Humble Bundle advertised their Paizo sale for Extra Life, I decided to strap on my GM boots and give it a go. I scoured over books. I carefully plotted who my first group would be. I dreamed of machinations of torment for my future players. Most importantly, I devised a plan. I would get my cast mates of “Rudolph” as excited about Pathfinder as I am and run my friends through an epic quest. I knew it would be difficult, but when is GMing ever not difficult?</p> 
                 <p>Through rehearsals, I helped these new players through character creation and backstory. Then it was time for my wife (one of those players) and I to pack our lives into two bags and three carry-ons and venture forth. You can imagine how hard it is to pack up the necessary equipment for Pathfinder as well as preparing for a two month away-from-home endeavor, but we made it work. We arrived at the airport, received quizzical looks for having a map sticking out of my backpack, and were stopped by airport security to search my bag of d20s. Through all of this, nothing was going to stop me.</p> 
                 <p>I sat down at our first official game in Fort Worth, TX, and felt prepared. I asked the front desk for an area where a group could meet to play a game. They peered at one another with questioning glances. To them, I looked like a bearded sack of trouble. As I saw their minds about to say “no,” I clarified that it wasn't drinking games or anything nefarious but to play a nerdy RPG. They heaved a sigh of relief, giggled slightly, and showed me a nice room where we could play.</p> 
                 <p>Preparing encounters was easy, but I wanted the environment to be pristine. I played with lighting, something that was surprisingly easy on the road. Once, I even brought down lamps from three separate rooms. I adjusted the dimness of two corners of the room, completely extinguished a panel of lights, and set the lighting above the table to a perfect level where it would draw my players in without straining their eyes. I had my iPad filled with important Paizo documents on one side, my phone with <a href="http://paizo.com/companies/syrinscape">Syrinscape</a> on the other, and beautiful <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8b4s?Pathfinder-Dice-Legacy-of-Fire"><i>Legacy of Fire Pathfinder Dice</i></a>. The work was worth it when my players arrived flabbergasted. It was time to unleash the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box"><i>Beginner Box</i></a> on my friends.</p> 
                 <p>There are many interesting problems that occur when you are playing a game without home-field advantage, the first of which I learned that night. If you are not clear about the time frame in which you plan to play, someone will come and kick you out of your beautiful playing space. Tension mounted as a group of goblins trapped and disarmed twos of the five PCs. The rest watched in horror as I scurried in for the kill, when suddenly security barged in and told us we had been there too long and must leave. So much for dealing with generous front desk staff. It was getting late, but we couldn't end the session like that. We packed up the mat, dice, computer, iPad, phone, character sheets, minis and GM screen and headed upstairs. Our rooms were very small. It was difficult to fit everyone inside, and I could tell that the delay had ruined the moment. Not to mention it gave time for the cleric to think up <i>obscuring mist</i> and escape scot free. They were tired and the moment gone. Yet, the story was all they could talk about the next morning. They were so excited about the growth of their characters, the story that was unfolding, and NPCs that they loved to hate. So, we decided to play again that night. We had a four hour bus drive from Fort Worth to Austin, and we were ready.</p> 
                 <p>We hopped from one location to the next playing games. We went from Austin, in a room deemed “The Murder Room” due to the staff requiring that we be locked in, to Fayetteville, Arkansas where we practically played poolside. We had days of rest in between; after all, you cannot play a three hour session after three shows of “Holly, Jolly Christmas” being sung into your face during the day. We spent most of our time travelling by bus, extolling our tales to curious cast mates, and late nights/early mornings would be filled with passerbys peaking their heads into conference rooms to figure out what undead creature these strange guests were</p> 
                 <p>talking about. The game ravaged forward, and they ended the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box"><i>Beginner Box</i></a> triumphantly. In my heart, I knew there was more story to tell, so I continued their journey with a homebrew. But, many other cast mates wanted a part of the tapestry I was weaving for their companions. It didn't take me long to decide that I could multitask and take another group through the same box. Afterall, I knew the module. How hard could it be?</p> 
                 <p>On the next bus ride, a particularly long travel day, I helped five brand new players roll up characters, along with leveling up my five previous players on a bumpy bus. I was exhausted, but I knew (due to time) that I should start right away. They went to the closest game store to purchase dice, and when that store had a terrible selection (as some small town stores do), they found a different one. Honestly, it was all going swimmingly. One group played at nights whenever we could sleep in the next day, while the other group would play the mornings on those same days. I lost some sleep, but didn't care. My friends were having the time of their lives. Unfortunately for me, the most distracting and frustrating moments for both parties happened on each of their respective “last nights.”</p> 
                 <p>The second party, with minimal time, was able to get through the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box"><i>Beginner Box</i></a>. It was in Columbus, Ohio, that their story, with me at the helm, would close. I knew the game itself had gripped their attention and they would want to continue to play, but Ohio proved to be difficult. The fanciest hotel we stayed in was also the stingiest. They told me I could play in a private dining room, yet withheld information that this room was actually public and the doors could not be closed. They showed me to another group area (this one had kids climbing over the chairs) and told me this was another option. After an hour and a half haggling with the front desk, I was able to secure a room. They forced me to pay for a cleaning fee, but the story was more important than a measly twenty five dollars. It was an interesting situation to be in. Normally, I would feel confident and prepared for a session, but this aggravation uneased me. In a moment of clarity, I realized this night wasn't about me or my struggles. It was about their tale. When we ended, emotions around the room were high. Blood was spilled, characters died, and heroes formed.</p> 
                 <p>The original party felt similar sensations, but the situation was much different. With the tour ending, we played our last session in a LaQuinta check in/breakfast nook in Abilene, Texas. This group took their characters from Texas to Alabama, Michigan, Wisconsin and many other states only to end up in Texas again. The perfect moment arose in game. The sorceress walked slowly around the spirit of her deceased husband as he revealed the true nature of her djinni bloodline. As I was about to drop the bomb, a disheveled man barged to the front desk complaining about water pressure in his room. Later an elf laid unconscious at the feet of a bearded devil as the group slowly backed away from the deadliest villain they faced. With his evil intentions made clear, he struck the rouge with a coup de grace. The players jaws dropped. And they jumped with surprise as the front desk staff clambered about cleaning the coffee machine. Obviously, this was not an ideal situation, but I had already learned this lesson. The words flowed from my mouth without fear or hesitation of what these other guests or staff thought. The rest of the world dissipated as I sat with my friends at a real table that now existed in an imaginary world only we inhabited. The players cried, laughed, died, rose again, and defeated the enemy.</p> 
                 <p>In the same sense, I defeated my own enemies. I had many fears when deciding to GM, especially in such a unique situation. The fear of telling pure strangers that I was playing an RPG in their hotels lived in me. The fear that I could not adequately perform the story was real. The fear that I was not good enough existed. In the end, all fears fell away as I learned that you don't need to be perfect to do this. You don't need the perfect map or the perfect knowledge. You don't even need a quiet, secluded space. You need people who are willing to dive in with you and swim in the deep end.</p> 
                 <p>I guarantee that more of my friends are interested in playing. They haven't told me so, but I know that they are out there. I refuse to let time get in my way, to let my fears drive me away from something I love. As GMs, we are duty-bound to tell stories to players who are interested. And if doing two or three shows a day, traveling on a bus to a new city or state every night, and living out of a suitcase didn't stop me, what's your excuse?</p>
