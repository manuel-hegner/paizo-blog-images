  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, February 10, 2011</p> \n   <p>The <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> introduced a new\
  \ concept for clerics—subdomains. In the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinderCampaignSetting/v5748btpy8ief\"\
  ><i>Inner Sea World Guide</i></a>, we introduce two new domains unique to Golarion—\
  the Scalykind domain and the Void domain. Alas, there was no space to present the\
  \ four subdomains that went along with those two new domains. So I thought to myself,\
  \ why not throw those four subdomains up as a Golarion Day post?</p> \n   <div align=\"\
  right\">\n    <table align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" hspace=\"9\"\
  \ cellspacing=\"0\">\n     <tbody>\n      <tr>\n       <td><a href=\"/image/content/CarrionCrown/PZO9044-PharasmaInfiniteStaircase.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/CarrionCrown/PZO9044-PharasmaInfiniteStaircase_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td align=\"center\" class=\"\
  tiny\">Illustration by Carolina Eade</td>\n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>But while I'm on the topic of domains and subdomains, there's\
  \ something else I want to talk about—Pharasma. Turns out that nonevil goddesses\
  \ of death sort of wreak havoc on the domain system—especially if they're as stringently\
  \ anti-undead as Pharasma is. Because pro-undead spells always seem to sneak onto\
  \ domain spell lists when you start talking about death and souls and stuff. It's\
  \ easy enough to simply not prepare domain spells that create undead, but it still\
  \ feels kind of disappointing to me that Pharasmins \"miss out\" on some domain\
  \ spell options. For those of you who want a more Pharasma-friendly version of the\
  \ Death domain and the Souls subdomain... behold!</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Pharasma-Friendly\
  \ Death Domain</b> 3rd-level domain spell: Replace <i>animate dead</i> with <i>speak\
  \ with dead</i>. 6th-level domain spell: Replace <i>create undead</i> with <i>antilife\
  \ shell</i>. 8th-level domain spell: Replace <i>create greater undead</i> with <i>symbol\
  \ of death</i>.</p> \n    <p><b>Pharasma-Friendly Souls Subdomain</b> 3rd-level\
  \ domain spell: Replace <i>animate dead</i> with <i>speak with dead</i>.</p> \n\
  \   </blockquote> \n   <p>And that gives me an excuse to show off this cool picture\
  \ of Pharasma doing her thing in the Boneyard—the art itself is from <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path</i> #44's article about Pharasma.</p> \n   <p>Now, that all taken\
  \ care of, we can move along to the original purpose of this post—subdomains for\
  \ the Scalykind and the Void domains. I'm not going to reprint those two domains\
  \ here. You have to check out <i>The Inner Sea World Guide</i> for that. But as\
  \ for the four subdomains associated with them, here you go!</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Dark Tapestry Subdomain</b><br><b>Associated Domain</b>: Void<br><b>Replacement\
  \ Power</b>: <i>It Came From Beyond</i>. Once per day when you cast a summoning\
  \ spell, any one creature you summon is more powerful than normal. The creature\
  \ gains the advanced creature simple template. If you summon more than one creature\
  \ with a spell, only one of the summoned creatures gains the advanced creature simple\
  \ template. A summoned creature that gains the advanced creature simple template\
  \ in this manner looks unusually deformed or hideous. This ability only works on\
  \ spells you cast as a cleric—it does not work on spellcasting ability gained from\
  \ any other spellcasting classes you might have. This ability replaces the Guarded\
  \ Mind ability of the Void domain.<br><b>Replacement Domain Spells</b>: 2nd—<i>summon\
  \ monster II</i>, 5th—<i>summon monster V</i>, 7th—<i>insanity</i>.</p> \n    <p><b>Dragon\
  \ Subdomain</b><br><b>Associated Domain</b>: Scalykind<br><b>Replacement Power</b>:\
  \ <i>Dragonbreath</i>. At 4th level, you may use a breath weapon once per day as\
  \ a standard action. When you gain this ability, choose acid, cold, fire, or electricity—\
  this determines what kind of damage your breath weapon inflicts. Once you make this\
  \ choice, you cannot change it later. Your breath weapon fills a 15-foot cone, and\
  \ inflicts 3d6 points of damage—this damage increases by +1d6 every even number\
  \ level you gain beyond 4th level. A creature hit by your dragonbreath attack can\
  \ make a Reflex save (DC 10 + half your cleric level + your Constitution modifier)\
  \ to take half damage. At 9th level, you can use this ability two times per day,\
  \ and at 14th level you can use it 3 times a day. This ability replaces the serpent\
  \ companion ability of the Scalykind domain.<br><b>Replacement Domain Spells</b>:\
  \ 3rd—<i>draconic reservoir</i> (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> 217), 4th—<i>dragon's\
  \ breath</i> (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> 217), 6th—<i>form of the dragon I</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Stars Subdomain</b><br><b>Associated Domain</b>: Void<br><b>Replacement\
  \ Power</b>: <i>The Stars Are Right</i>. If you prepare your cleric spells while\
  \ the stars are visible to you, you may spontaneously cast any of your Stars subdomain\
  \ domain spells by swapping out a spell of an equal spell level. Any Stars subdomain\
  \ spells that you cast while the stars are visible to you heal you of damage equal\
  \ to the spell's level as you cast the spell. This ability replaces the part the\
  \ veil ability of the Void domain.<br><b>Replacement Domain Spells</b>: 2nd—<i>hypnotic\
  \ pattern</i>, 7th—<i>sunbeam</i>, 9th—<i>meteor swarm</i>.</p> \n    <p><b>Saurian\
  \ Subdomain</b><br><b>Associated Domain</b>: Scalykind<br><b>Replacement Power</b>:\
  \ <i>Dinosaur Companion</i>. At 4th level, you gain the service of an animal companion.\
  \ Your effective druid level for this animal companion is equal to your cleric level\
  \ –2. You may choose any dinosaur as your companion. This ability replaces the serpent\
  \ companion ability of the Scalykind domain.<br><b>Replacement Domain Spells</b>:\
  \ 4th—<i>summon nature's ally IV (deinonychus or pteranodon only)</i>, 5th—<i>beast\
  \ shape III</i>, 7th—<i>summon nature's ally VII (brachiosaurus or tyrannosaurus\
  \ only)</i>.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Of course, there's still one other burning\
  \ question about subdomains. The APG revealed what subdomains the core 20 deities\
  \ granted, but said nothing about the subdomains the non-core deities grant access\
  \ to! That, unfortunately, is a giant scary list and this blog post is already long\
  \ enough—I'll see if I can't get that list ready for next Thursday, though! (As\
  \ a free preview, though, and because it became a hot topic on one thread out there\
  \ in the Paizo wilds: Besmara grants the following subdomains: Deception, Oceans,\
  \ Protean, Tactics, Thievery, and Storms.</p> \n   <p style=\"clear:both;\">James\
