  description\"><b>Chronicler’s Note</b><br> <em>Since before the Gap, dwarven miners\
  \ used a custom numbering system known as “shifts” to determine the passing of time\
  \ for their operations. This term is a modern adaptation of Old Golarion dwarven\
  \ time metrics known as forge-days, which are still counted by some Star Citadel\
  \ citizens. The exact time measurement of a dwarven shift is relative to the individual\
  \ project, with some based around the need for rest cycles, while others could be\
  \ delineated by the completion of specific milestones in a greater project. For\
  \ example: the task of mining an asteroid with eight rich mineral deposits might\
  \ be divided into eight shifts.</em></p> \n       <p><em>The use of shift terminology\
  \ to describe the stages of engagement and arrival of forces for the now infamous\
  \ Battle of Aledra is believed to have originated with the retired dwarven miner,\
  \ Brolmor Slagshout, who was instrumental in the early defense of the Triaxian town.\
  \ Brolmor is known to be one of only a handful of pre-Pact Worlds combatants who\
  \ refused to abandon the engagement zone throughout the entirety of the conflict.\
  \ With records of the battle fragmentary on both sides, Pact Worlds officials have\
  \ often used Brolmor’s description of shifts as a means of expressing the engagement’\
  s order of battle.</em><br> –Shaleria Phrain, Starfinder Society Chronicler (320\
  \ AG).</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <hr width=\"50%\"> \n      <p>Brolmor Slagshout\
  \ was certain that he’d always lived from one disaster to another.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ former miner had survived the chaotic tragedy that claimed the dwarven settlement\
  \ of Arngrannam. In the aftermath of that calamity, he decided not to join the majority\
  \ of his kin when they went to build their first Star Citadel. Instead, Brolmor\
  \ left dwarven society behind and settled somewhere that he hoped he could live\
  \ out the rest of his days in peace. Unfortunately, in the decades following what\
  \ everyone now called the Gap, peace was in short supply. Brolmor settled on the\
  \ quaint Triaxian mountain settlement of Aledra as the perfect place to spend his\
  \ final years.</p> \n      <p>And yet, Brolmor now faced a hulking, upright lizard\
  \ wielding a tri-tipped powered weapon he’d never seen before.</p> \n      <center>\n\
  \       <hr width=\"50%\">\n      </center> \n      <p>Earlier in the day, Brolmor\
  \ had begun his normal daily rituals as the soft light of the morning sun first\
  \ illuminated his modest home on Aledra’s outskirts. Upon waking, he dressed in\
  \ practical, comfortable clothes, made himself breakfast, and then prayed to Angradd,\
  \ the new dwarven protector. Brolmor still wasn’t used to the high-mountain air,\
  \ so he always took extra time to get ready, but he had wanted a life of peace and\
  \ relaxation, so he savored his newfound pace. For breakfast, Brolmor had a simple\
  \ quiche made from fish imported from Ignomus Bay; in his short time here, he had\
  \ quickly taken a liking to the Triaxian delicacy. Praying to Angradd still felt\
  \ strange to Brolmor, and he often wondered if he’d been a devout servant of Torag\
  \ before the Gap, during which the patriarch of the dwarven pantheon—and de facto\
  \ patron of dwarves everywhere—disappeared.</p> \n      <p>His daily rituals complete,\
  \ Brolmor left for the market to pick up his weekly supplies. After restocking his\
  \ food stores, he could spend the rest of the day preparing the week’s meals at\
  \ home. He also hoped to pick up the latest installment of the <em>Starfinder Chronicles</em>\
  \ if one was available, as he’d become a keen follower of the new broadcast series\
  \ and thought the next volume would help fill his ample free time.</p> \n      <p>Stepping\
  \ into the brisk morning air, Brolmor knew something was wrong before his front\
  \ door had closed behind him. A small crowd of his neighbors—mostly Triaxus’s native\
  \ ryphorians and immense dragonkin—stared skyward, mouths agape with terror and\
  \ wonder. They pointed up at pinprick flashes in the cloudless sky, which created\
  \ a scintillating light show so faint that the rising sun almost completely obscured\
  \ it.</p> \n      <p>While the crowds murmured their theories of what was causing\
  \ the strange events in the sky, Brolmor knew what was coming. He’d seen it during\
  \ the final days of Arngrannam, and by the feeling he had in his old bones, he was\
  \ sure he’d probably seen similar orbital displays in the part of his history now\
  \ lost to him.</p> \n      <p>Shaking his head, the elder dwarf turned back into\
  \ his home and prepared.</p> \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"50%\">\n     \
  \ </center> \n      <p>The first invaders fell from the sky on contrails of fire\
  \ that afternoon.</p> \n      <p>They came in a swarm of drop pods and dropships,\
  \ creating a cordon around Aledra. Smaller units of these unidentified invaders\
  \ landed throughout the mountains and quickly set up short-range anti-aircraft batteries\
  \ and communication jammers. Within minutes of the landing, the attackers had cut\
  \ off all avenues of escape for Aledra’s citizens. Brolmor and his neighbors were\
  \ on their own.</p> \n      <p>That’s when Brolmor emerged from his home, bedecked\
  \ in his panoply of war. He wore the plated heavy armor that had served him in all\
  \ his prior battles and clutched his powered axe, <em>Rebranda</em>. The weapon\
  \ was from a life lost to Brolmor in the Gap, and while he knew the name of the\
  \ weapon he carried, he had no knowledge of its origin. Perhaps the axe had been\
  \ the name of a loved one, or it had been named by a prior owner. Brolmor would\
  \ never know the truth, just as so many survivors of the Gap would lack context\
  \ for much of their lives. He immediately set to work, barking orders at his stunned\
  \ neighbors with an air of command.</p> \n      <p>Within thirty minutes, Brolmor\
  \ had assembled Aledra’s most formidable combatants into a crude defense force,\
  \ comprised mostly of retired military and former adventurers and the relatively\
  \ minor security detail that the town employed to fend off bandits and encroaching\
  \ monsters. Recognizing that Brolmor was clearly more experienced in military matters,\
  \ even Aledra’s senior security chief instinctively deferred to the dwarf.</p> \n\
  \      <p>“I know when to listen to someone with more experience,” the unusually\
  \ personable dragonkin security commander admitted before authorizing Brolmor to\
  \ take his small contingent to meet the attackers outside the settlement.</p>\n\
  \      <p> </p>\n      <p>It took only an hour from the attackers’ initial landing\
  \ for their first scouting force to make its way to the edge of town. The immense\
  \ lizard-like creatures came in thick armor and wielded impressive weapons unfamiliar\
  \ to Brolmor.</p> \n      <p>No one on either side of the conflict spoke a word.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>It remains unclear who fired the first shot, or why, but all accounts\
  \ confirm that it came from the invaders. The shot missed its intended target, whatever\
  \ it may have been, but the battle was begun. As if loosed from a cannon, Brolmor\
  \ hurtled forward to defend his adopted home, bellowing a war cry like nothing his\
  \ fellow Aledrans had ever heard. Blasts of laser energy and solid projectile rounds\
  \ peppered Brolmor’s dwarf-wrought armor, with azure fields of energy deflecting\
  \ the worst of the incoming damage. The invaders didn’t get a chance to release\
  \ a second volley before the dwarven berserker had entered their ranks, a lone defender\
  \ in a mass of scaled flesh and thrumming energy weapons.</p> \n      <p>That’s\
  \ when the killing started.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/0ad2bbe5-4255-4b62-8dec-42f7c05112dd/102020_Aledra.jpg\"\

  \ Slagshout, honoring his name with a wordless war cry, laid the first of the invaders\
  \ low with a single swing from <em>Rebranda</em>.</p> \n      <p>“Let’s get to work\
  \ then! First shift starts now!” Brolmor shouted at his companions, who roared in\
  \ response and rushed from behind cover to join the fray.</p> \n      <blockquote>\
  \ \n       <p><b>Chronicler’s Note (Historical Accuracy)</b><br> <em>Though the\
  \ unnamed vesk soldier Brolmor Slagshout slew outside Aledra is considered the first\
  \ casualty of the ground conflict, Ushataun Genrais is the first recorded casualty\
  \ of overall battle. Genrais was a ryphorian maintenance worker in the employ of\
  \ Sanjaval Spaceflight Systems and was onboard one of the orbital satellites at\
  \ the time of the Veskarium vanguard’s arrival. Genrais was recorded as killed in\
  \ combat after the Vindicas Tyrant-class starship, Firescale’s Resolve, obliterated\
  \ the orbital he was stationed on with a disdainful ramming action before any invaders\
  \ had made planetfall, thus preceding the events of the Battle of Aledra by several\
  \ hours.</em><br> –Shaleria Phrain, Starfinder Society Chronicler (320 AG).</p>\

  \ \n      <p>The sun set on the terraced fields around Aledra.</p> \n      <p>Over\
  \ the course of the afternoon and evening, reinforcements had managed to slip into\
  \ the area under covering fire from aerial Triaxian defenders. Most of these additional\
  \ forces joined Brolmor’s forces outside Aledra, though the battle quickly spread\
  \ beyond the site of the initial skirmish. Now forces clashed within the settlement\
  \ itself and throughout the surrounding mountain range, and the telltale signs of\
  \ distant engagements soon assaulted the normally peaceful town just as the invaders\
  \ had—rising smoke on the horizon, the concussive <em>whump</em> of far-off explosions,\
  \ and the smell of ozone and blood carried inexplicably far by the thin air. Even\
  \ the skies had become packed with fighters, low-orbit starships, and the tracer\
  \ fire of anti-aircraft weapons fired by both attacker and defender alike.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Throughout the escalating war around him, Brolmor kept fighting. Through\
  \ raw strength and sheer force of will, the dwarf never relented in battling against\
  \ the invaders who suddenly threatened his adopted home. Allies fell all around\
  \ him, unremarked on the ground, as Brolmor kept pace with those who stepped up\
  \ to challenge him. The latest combatant was an intimidating foe, who entered the\
  \ battle unhelmed and wielding a vicious tri-pointed energy blade, which is whirled\
  \ in a wide arc. The lizard barked several syllables Brolmor assumed formed words\
  \ in its native tongue, and smiled, as though the invader was enjoying the combat\
  \ far more than Brolmor was.</p> \n      <p>Quick as a flick of its reptilian tongue,\
  \ the lizard-foe lashed out at the dwarf. Even expecting the attack, Brolmor was\
  \ caught unaware by the strike, and the tri-tipped blades were stopped only by the\
  \ force field of Brolmor’s armor. The discharge pushed the enemy back half a step,\
  \ and Brolmor deftly closed the distance as though the two were tethered to one\
  \ another with an invisible cord. With his foe forced backward, Brolmor slashed\
  \ with <em>Rebranda</em> in a wide arc of his own. Armor shattered under the axe’\
  s impact, and the invader took a second step back, panting and wincing in visible\
  \ pain.</p> \n      <p>Suddenly, a vast shadow fell over the combatants.</p> \n\
  \      <p>In the sky above, a macabre scene began to unfold. A stream of osseous\
  \ vessels descended. The pristine bone-white of their hulls stained orange by the\
  \ dying light of the setting sun. Red beams of light flashed down from the arriving\
  \ ships, onto the battlefield like searchlights scanning the melee.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>As if by instinct, Brolmor and his surviving allies, as well as the surprised\
  \ invading forces, backed up from the battle line, a gulf quickly forming before\
  \ the two forces as each reassessed the situation. Starring up at the sky, Brolmor\
  \ wondered if these newcomers—he recognized them as the starships of the dreaded\
  \ undead from the world of Eox—had come as friend or foe.</p> \n      <p>“Well,\
  \ friends,” he muttered dryly, scanning the awed, upturned faces of his compatriots,\
  \ “looks like the second shift is about to begin!”</p> \n     </blockquote> \n \
