  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhbx\">last month’s Giantslayer Marathon blog</a> and were\
  \ eager for part 2, your wait is over! Before I let those guys get to their highlights\
  \ from their second marathon session, I wanted to warn people playing through the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/Giantslayer\">Giantslayer Adventure Path</a>\
  \ that this blog post contains some spoilers. Read at your own risk!</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ Order of the Amber Die is back with the second update on our ambitious record-breaking\
  \ endeavor to complete the Giantslayer Adventure Path in just 6 months!</p> \n \
  \   <p>Let's dig right in:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150509-Photo2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150509-Photo2_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>After a bloody nose in the first round of the Giantslayer\
  \ AP, our players set about making improvements for a better showing in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9c1v\">\"The Hill Giant's Pledge\"</a>. These included extreme measures\
  \ such as holding Pathfinder combat training sessions at one player's apartment,\
  \ as well as reaching out to an old member and retired giant slayer from G1-2-3\
  \ (Against the Giants) that we last played with 16 years ago. From the frozen wastes\
  \ of North Dakota, this grizzled veteran answered the call and flew to NJ to play\
  \ the role of NPC Kurst Grath for this 72-hour marathon. On the other side of the\
  \ screen, our GM locked himself away for a Spring Break to prep an entire module\
  \ at once, emerging with adventure accouterments that included an exact three-dimensional\
  \ replica of the riverboat from the module and a massive map of Redlake Fort.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Highlights From our Experience With \"The Hill Giant's Pledge\"</h3>\
  \ \n     <ul>\n      <li>The authors continued to surprise us: in a chosen mission\
  \ to locate magic weapons, we spent nearly 20 hours inside a druidic demiplane complete\
  \ with high stakes lily pad hopping and flowers that were deadly to stop and smell,\
  \ along with unique opportunities to gain familiars or animal companions possessing\
  \ traits not found anywhere else. We used a fog machine for the greenhouse mist\
  \ (as pictured), which helped make the Vault of Thorns a place we shall not soon\
  \ forget.</li> \n      <li>During a riverboat journey through Belkzen that was not\
  \ for tourists, an ambush by a group of wicked merrow forced Crowe the bloodrager\
  \ to leap from the crow's nest (we just had to put him there) and deliver a mid-air\
  \ natural 20 with <i>Agrimmosh, the Hammer of Unmaking</i>, to put one of the ogres\
  \ face down on the deck.</li> \n      <li>Our players spent precious marathon time\
  \ coming up with a detailed plan to assassinate Grenseldek the hill giant chieftain.\
  \ To pull it off, they would have to lead an incursion against a nearly impregnable\
  \ fort controlled by hill giants, overseen by ogres, and surrounded by orcs. After\
  \ dozens of modules where plans like this have gone awry, props to the players of\
  \ strike teams Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie for their rendition of Zero Dark Thirty\
  \ that gave us a brilliant victory and proved wrong the adage: \"Never split the\
  \ party.\"</li> \n      <li>Every now and then a character finds an item suited\
  \ perfectly for them. A nod to author Larry Wilhelm for Oloch's discovery of the\
  \ legendary greatsword known as Gorum's Thorn. Giants will fear it.</li>\n     </ul>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150509-Photo6.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150509-Photo6_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <h3>Character Deaths</h3> \n     <ul>\n      <li>With one character\
  \ disabled and two others near death, the party found themselves deep in the Ghostlight\
  \ Marsh. Daylight was fading, and soon the wisps would come. Rather than take their\
  \ chances with the marsh at night, a tense party vote resulted in a decision to\
  \ penetrate the Vault of Thorns and then rest. A few moments after entering, two\
  \ twigjack defenders of the druidic sanctum laid waste to the party with a barrage\
  \ of brambles. When the leaves settled, Oloch and Kurst were dead.</li> \n     \
  \ <li>Quinn's encounters with dangerous heights weren't over after the first module.\
  \ In a precarious struggle against a giant dragonfly from the First World, the investigator\
  \ was bitten, pulled from a ledge, and dropped 100 feet into a compost pile that\
  \ wasn't quite thick enough.</li> \n      <li>Melira the vengeful human-slaying\
  \ ranger took up an advantageous position in the forecastle during a multi-deck\
  \ riverboat battle. Overlooking our party of 5 human-premium targets, she selected\
  \ our warpriest. For the second time in this AP, our GM threw down a 20-20 and sent\
  \ Oloch to Gorum.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <h3>Current Situation</h3> \n     <p>This\
  \ AP continues to challenge our team of Iconics, but with the help of two of Giantslayer's\
  \ capable NPCs they managed to secure along the way, our heroes did triumph over\
  \ the hill giant chieftain—in 3 rounds. The party has now taken down its first few\
  \ giants in single combat and continues to prove itself capable of surviving Giantslayer,\
  \ but entering <a href=\"/products/btpy9c1x\">\"Forge of the Giant God\"</a>with\
  \ low resources and three characters under-level is daunting. We play a tight game\
  \ to create intensity, and as always, CRs will not be adjusted down. We will just\
  \ have to step up</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150509-Photo1.jpg\"\
