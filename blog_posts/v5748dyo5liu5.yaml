  >PaizoCon 2016</a> has come to a close, but the Pathfinder Society team is gearing\
  \ up for tons of new programs and material that we showed off at the Paizo Preview\
  \ Banquet Saturday evening. Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge announced\
  \ these to a packed ballroom, and today I'd like to share the news with you.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Pathfinder Society Academy</h2> \n    <p>What better way is there to\
  \ begin a blog than with a great way to begin one's roleplaying experience? <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5licg\">Back in January</a>, Tonya first announced Pathfinder\
  \ Academy, an expansion of the \"Kid's Track\" games offered at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con</a> for the past several years. We've since contracted\
  \ authors for new scenarios, worked with Venture-Captains Michael VonHasseln and\
  \ Lucas Servideo to create new lesson plans, and have a complete set of new quests\
  \ on the way for eager young gamers to play. These will debut at Gen Con, and afterward\
  \ we're exploring ways to distribute these adventures to convention organizers to\
  \ provide kid-friendly content at events worldwide. In addition, we are working\
  \ on a scenario rating system that identifies adult themes and ways to adjust the\
  \ scenarios for our younger players.</p> \n    <p>As a sign of things to come, we're\
  \ excited to share the new product's temporary logo (still a work in progress)!</p>\

  \    </div> \n    <h2>Adventure Card Guild</h2> \n    <p>There's a lot in the pipeline\
  \ for the <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a>. A few weeks ago,\
  \ Tanis announced the upcoming <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lish\">Season of the\
  \ Goblin</a> (or, We Be Card Goblins, as it's affectionally referred to in-house),\
  \ which not only provides use two months of goblin carnage but also ties into the\
  \ upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9k5m\"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> Class Decks. Tanis tends to giggle\
  \ evilly and then show off preview art every time we bring up this topic, so it's\
  \ only right that we introduce you to one of the upcoming goblin \"heroes,\" Zibini,\
  \ the Great and Goobly. As you might guess from her art, she's a powerful diviner\
  \ able to foretell what goblins will fight and what they will burn—which is to say\
  \ everything. Season of the Goblin will combine Tanis' dastardly mechanics with\
  \ story from author Jason Keeley, whose work most recently featured in <em>#7-23\
  \ Abducted in Aether</em>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6818-Zibini_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>As the Season\
  \ of the Goblin winds to a close, the long-anticipated <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Mummy's Mask</a> will be hitting the shelves. Once\
  \ it does, we'll be launching the Season of the Mummy, sending Pathfinders into\
  \ the tombs of Osirion to do battle with the evils that sleep beneath the sands.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Finally, PaizoCon was an excellent opportunity to refine and introduce\
  \ special convention rewards for playing the Adventure Card Guild at conventions.\
  \ For about five years, the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild has offered special\
  \ \"convention boons\" at registered events of 15 sessions or more. Last year Tanis\
  \ and I worked together to create a handful of similar rewards—can't quite call\
  \ them boons, as that's an existing game term—to distribute at Gen Con, and we've\
  \ since honed the process to present a set of special rewards for each season of\
  \ Guild play. We're especially proud of not only the smaller page format (much easier\
  \ to pack alongside your <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks\">Class\
  \ Deck</a>) but also of the thematic tie-ins to the season. At PaizoCon you may\
  \ have spotted the Thassilonian Ritual rewards, which allow your character to gain\
  \ a long-term benefit at the cost of leaving her vulnerable to that sin's foibles.\
  \ We're designating several of these for distribution to events worldwide, and several\
  \ are going to be special rewards available at only a handful of conventions such\
  \ as PaizoCon, PaizoCon UK, Gen Con, and Origins.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Roleplaying Guild</h2> \n    <p>Finally, we announced\
  \ the next season of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild: Year of the Stolen\
  \ Storm. The organized play program has always been an excellent way to present\
  \ adventures in a wide variety of places, including those yet to be seen in Adventure\
  \ Paths or Modules. With this mission, the Society has extensively—but not exhaustively—\
  explored the Inner Sea region over the past eight years, but beyond regular visits\
  \ to Tian Xia and the Hao Jin Tapestry demiplane, it has traveled beyond this region\
  \ only rarely. For years I've looked for ways to dabble in some extraplanar travel,\
  \ and for Season 8 I proposed not just dipping the Society's toes in the water but\
  \ diving in completely.</p> \n    <p>During the Year of the Stolen Storm, the Society\
  \ turns its sights to the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. There,\
  \ agents can not only recover extraordinary treasures but also embroil themselves\
  \ in extraplanar politics and clash with otherworldly organizations. Over the course\
  \ of the season, we've planned at least two adventures in each of the Elemental\
  \ Planes, and in defiance of what I consider the conventional wisdom of planar adventures\
  \ (i.e. it's only for high-level PCs), we've found some fun ways to let PCs of all\
  \ levels get in on the action. In anticipation of the adventures to come, Paizo's\
  \ releasing <a href=\"/products/btpy9k5n\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Planes\
  \ of Power</em></a> in August 2016, expanding on the current elemental lore many\
  \ times over as well as providing new character options that could come in handy\
  \ while traveling so far afield.</p> \n    <p>Even as we send Pathfinders to distant\
  \ realms, we'll still have business at home to handle. Look forward to exciting\
  \ adventures on the Material Plane that continue ongoing stories, travel to unseen\
  \ lands, and uncover forgotten secrets. The Year of the Stolen Storm is looking\
  \ to be the best season yet!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Lead Developer</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder Society,\
