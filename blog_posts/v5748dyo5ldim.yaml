  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: The Golem's Got It</h1> \n   <p\
  \ class=\"date\">Friday, June 8, 2012</p> \n   <p>I've spent the week in New York\
  \ City at Book Expo America, chatting with booksellers and distributors about Paizo's\
  \ exciting upcoming products. I was very pleased to receive an early print sample\
  \ of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path Anniversary\
  \ Edition</a> hardcover to bring to the conference, and it was fun to watch everyone's\
  \ mouths fall agape as they took in the gorgeous book. I don't think it's much of\
  \ an exaggeration to claim that Rise of the Runelords is one of the most beautiful\
  \ RPG books ever produced, and I'm so pleased with our team at Paizo and all of\
  \ our freelance writers and illustrators for putting out such a great celebration\
  \ of 5 years of Pathfinder and 10 years of Paizo Publishing. It really is a sight\
  \ to behold.</p> \n   <p>A great campaign needs great miniatures, of course, and\
  \ in this regard our partners at WizKids keep hitting it out of the park. I've been\
  \ sharing early looks at the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Pathfinder Battles Rise\
  \ of the Runelords 65-figure</a> set for months, and as we draw closer to the set's\
  \ August release, I'm amazed that there are still so many cool miniatures left to\
  \ reveal.</p> \n   <p>This week's miniature is the Stone Golem, a critical encounter\
  \ as the campaign builds up to its climax.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120608-StoneGolem.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120608-StoneGolem_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>This Large, rare figure packs a heavy punch.\
  \ He's got his fists raised to pummel your player characters into the ground. The\
  \ great thing about golems is that they can look like just about anything their\
  \ creator wants. That's quite a handy bonus when it comes to miniatures, in that\
  \ a unique-looking golem can easy double as another type of creature as needed.\
  \ In this case, we pulled the crowned skull face directly from the creature's illustration,\
  \ which has the helpful side-effect of making this guy a great substitution for\
  \ any kind of undead behemoth you might need.</p> \n   <p>Speaking of undead behemoths,\
  \ after a full week of day-to-night meetings at the Book Expo, I am TIRED and am\
  \ looking forward to getting some shut-eye on the long flight to Seattle.</p> \n\
  \   <p>I'll have another Pathfinder Battles preview next Friday, so keep your eyes\
  \ on this space!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n  </blockquote>\
