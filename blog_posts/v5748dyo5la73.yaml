  \ Card Themes</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 15, 2007</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ GameMastery team recently got together to hash out the next theme for our Item\
  \ Card product line. While tossing around thoughts of undead scrolls and elven bows,\
  \ it occurred to me that it might be fun to talk about how we come up with themes\
  \ for our future sets. First, a bit of history. </p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <img\
  \ src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO5000_120.jpeg\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\"\
  > \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>The very first item card set, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7m6a\"\
  ><i>Item Pack 1</i></a>, was specifically designed to be a starter set, with a wide\
  \ variety of items so GMs could use the cards right away (for those of you unfamiliar\
  \ with them, Item Cards are generic treasure cards that you can hand out when the\
  \ PCs find loot, with a blank space on the back for writing in what the item does).\
  \ While that first set was a big success, we needed a means for GMs to get a few\
  \ more potions, scrolls, and other disposable items without having to buy a whole\
  \ new deck of cards. <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7pew\"><i>Hero's Hoard</i></a> was\
  \ born soon after as a set of booster packs. This set had more items in line with\
  \ those presented in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7m6a\"><i>Item Pack 1</i></a>, but\
  \ came in a booster pack with a set assortment (2 potions, 2 weapons, 2 wondrous\
  \ items, 1 armor, 1 wand, 1 scroll, 1 rod/staff/ring, and 1 foil card in every pack).</p>\
  \ \n   </blockquote> \n   <img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO5001-S_180.jpeg\"\
  \ align=\"right\" border=\"0\"> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>It was at this point\
  \ that we decided to do a themed set. <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7m6a\"><i>Item Pack\
  \ 1</i></a> and <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7pew\"><i>Hero's Hoard</i></a> covered\
  \ all your basic items, so we wanted the next set to branch out in new directions.\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7pox\"><i>Relics of War</i></a> was our first foray\
  \ into this arena, with all of the cards in the set themed to either good or evil.\
  \ While you can't exactly tell this with some of the cards, others in the set, such\
  \ as the \"demonhide\" and one of the \"longswords,\" further the theme nicely.\
  \ </p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO5004_120.jpeg\"\
  \ align=\"left\" border=\"0\"> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>By this point in time,\
  \ the fan base for Item Cards had really started to take off, and the one thing\
  \ everyone clamored for was a set of cards for the items that characters might typically\
  \ carry, such as rope, a backpack, or rations. This made choosing our next theme\
  \ easy. <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7u5o\"><i>Adventure Gear</i></a> came out late\
  \ last year to give characters all the thieves' tools, holy symbols, and lantern\
  \ cards they could handle, with the nice bonus that many of the cards in this set\
  \ work well as magic items to boot. By popular demand, this set moved back to the\
  \ deck format.</p> \n    <p>When it came time to plot out the fifth set, the idea\
  \ of doing themes became much more solidified. <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiu\"\
  ><i>Dragon's Trove</i></a>, a 110-card deck, pulls out all the stops, is packed\
  \ full of all the golden baubles, lamps, crowns, and swords you might expect to\
  \ find in the hoard of a great wyrm. The set also includes a number of items made\
  \ from dragons, to round out the theme. As this set just went off to the printer,\
  \ I thought I might give you a few sneak peaks (with more to come soon).</p> \n\
  \    <p>Fortunately for you, the work of the Item Card team never ends. Our next\
  \ set is called Elements of Power and should be out later this summerâ€”I'll bet you\
  \ can guess what the theme might be. Look for some cards tied directly to <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder\"><i>Pathfinder</i></a> and the <a href=\"/gameMastery/modules\"><i>GameMastery\
  \ Modules</i></a> in this 54-card deck set as well.</p> \n    <p>Beyond that, however,\
  \ the set themes are still malleable. Got any ideas for a set you'd like to see?\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/gameMastery/general/itemCardThemeIdeas\">Post it\
  \ to our forums.</a> </p>\n    <p>Jason Bulmahn <br>GameMastery Brand Manager</p>\
