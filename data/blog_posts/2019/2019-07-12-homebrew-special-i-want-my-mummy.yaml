  \ It's your mostly-fearless-except-for-fear-of-falling-from-heights Venture Captain\
  \ for online Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, Tyler!</p>\n              <p>I had\
  \ a blast at PaizoCon, and we got LOADS of new information from Paizo on the release\
  \ of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  >Core Set</a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a> (both available now), on the new\
  \ Year of Rotting Ruins that begins at Gen Con, and on the fact that the Core and\
  \ Curse scenarios in the storybooks that come in the box are sanctioned for PACS\
  \ play! I also want to give a quick plug for the current online PACS play-by-post\
  \ convention, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42l1o?Announcing-Player-Recruitment-for-Cards\"\
  >Cards Against Gnomanity II</a>. Though the event has already begun, we'd love to\
  \ have you join us for future games, so if you just tell us in the recruitment thread\
  \ that you're interested, we can help you find a game—even if you've never played\
  \ PACS through play-by-post!</p>\n              <p>Mostly, though, I want to talk\
  \ to you a bit about something that I spent several months working on leading up\
  \ to PaizoCon, and then spent most of my actual time at PaizoCon running: this year's\
  \ homebrew special, entitled \"I Want My Mummy!\"</p>\n              <p>This set\
  \ of three adventures was designed to run during three afternoon sessions at PaizoCon.\
  \ We decided this year to do Tier 1, Tier 3, and Tier 5 so that people got a broader\
  \ taste of the characters. The story is based on some of the most popular PFS scenarios\
  \ from WAAAY back in season 5: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy93m0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-12-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-1-A-Bitter-Bargain\"\
  >the Destiny</a><a> </a><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy93m3?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-15-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-2-Race-to-Seekers-Folly\"\
  >of the Sands</a> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy93m4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-16-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-3-Sanctum-of-the-Sages\"\
  >trilogy</a>. This means that your kobold characters (new versions of the infamous\
  \ kobolds from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9cu6?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-99-True-Dragons-of-Absalom\"\
  >True Dragons of Absalom</a>) get to interact with everyone's favorite creepy dude\
  \ in a hot tub, Grandmaster Torch. He'll send your kobolds on a grand adventure\
  \ to… do a bunch of seemingly mundane tasks for him, as is tradition.</p>\n    \

  \          <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The kobold Alchemist, Athrax. There's no\
  \ \"n\" in there… read it again, I promise you it's true.</p>\n              </div>\n\
  \              <p>As you can see from his character and role cards, Athrax uses\
  \ the trap-setting mechanic to keep from banishing his Alchemical items. He also\
  \ has a few spells, but he just straight-up banishes those, so it's best to keep\
  \ things like Cure and Find Traps in those slots, which can be useful one-shots.\
  \ Athrax also has a useful way of ignoring Triggers, by setting traps and then examining\
  \ locations. Sometimes it's more than worth a buried card to ignore a Trigger.</p>\n\
  \              <p>In brief, trapsetting works like this: When you set a trap with\
  \ a card, you display that card next to your location (we played them facedown at\
  \ PaizoCon because we had different-colored sleeves for each character, which helps\
  \ determine who set the trap initially). When a monster is encountered at a trapped\
  \ location, the trap is sprung, and you get to add 1d6 to all checks against that\
  \ monster for the encounter.</p>\n              <p>After Adventure 1, we skip ahead\
  \ to Adventure 3, where you're in hot pursuit of two Aspis agents who have gotten\
  \ hold of one of the fabled Sage Gems, mythical gems that hold the power of the\
  \ Jeweled Sages inside them. Several of the scenarios in this adventure allow you\
  \ to gain Chase Points for finishing quickly, culminating in a scenario where you're\
  \ literally chasing the Aspis agents along a set of locations, trying to move quickly\
  \ to the place where another Sage Gem is likely to be found. Once you arrive, you\
  \ find many dangers, the worst of which is the deadly Sage of Plagues, who has one\
  \ of the most diabolical powers I've ever written. When you defeat him, he explodes\
  \ in necromantic energy, shattering the Ruby Sage Gem… but even shards of such a\
  \ powerful relic have the ability to grant incredible abilities to those wielding\
  \ them.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <img src=\"\
