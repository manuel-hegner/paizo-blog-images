  \ page 12 of 2007's <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #1: Burnt Offerings</em>, goblins\
  \ have been a key part of what makes Pathfinder recognizable as Pathfinder. When\
  \ we first started looking at what would become the ancestries in the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Rulebook</em>, we knew that we wanted to add something to the mix, to\
  \ broaden the horizon of what it meant to be a hero in Pathfinder. That naturally\
  \ brought us to goblins.</p> \n    <p>The trick was finding a way to let you play\
  \ a goblin who has the feel of a Pathfinder goblin, but who is also a little bit\
  \ softer around the edges—a character who has a reason to work with a group of \"\
  longshanks,\" as opposed to trying to light them on fire at the first opportunity.\
  \ Let's look at an excerpt from the goblin ancestry to find out a bit more.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>As a people, goblins have spent millennia feared, maligned, and even\
  \ hunted—and sometimes for understandable reasons, as some rural goblin tribes still\
  \ often direct cruelty, raiding, and mayhem toward wandering or vulnerable creatures.\
  \ In recent decades, however, a new sort of hero has emerged from among these rough-and-tumble\
  \ tribes. Such goblins bear the same oversized heads, pointed ears, red eyes, and\
  \ jagged teeth of their crueler kin, but they have a noble or savvy streak that\
  \ other goblins can't even imagine, let alone understand. These erstwhile heroes\
  \ roam Golarion, often maintaining their distinctive cultural habits while spreading\
  \ the enthusiasm, inscrutable quirkiness, love of puns and song, and unique mirth\
  \ that mark goblin adventurers.</p> \n     <p>Despite breaking from their destructive\
  \ past, goblin adventurers often subtly perpetuate some of the qualities that have\
  \ been characteristics of the creatures for millennia. They tend to flock to strong\
  \ leaders, and fiercely protect those companions who have protected them from physical\
  \ harm or who offer a sympathetic ear and sage advice when they learn of the goblins'\
  \ woes. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire, or fearlessly devour meals\
  \ that might turn others' stomachs. Others are inveterate tinkerers and view their\
  \ companions' trash as components of gadgets yet to be made. Occasionally, fellow\
  \ adventurers find these proclivities unsettling or odd, but more often than not\
  \ goblins' friends consider these qualities endearing.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>The entry in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> has plenty more to\
  \ say on the topic, but that should give you a sense of where we are taking Pathfinder's\
  \ favorite troublemakers.</p> \n    <p>In addition to the story behind the goblin,\
  \ its ancestry entry has a lot of other information as well to help you make a goblin\
  \ player character. It includes the base goblin ability boosts (Dexterity and Charisma),\
  \ ability flaw (Wisdom), bonus Hit Points (6), base speed (25 feet), and starting\
  \ languages (Common and Goblin), as well as the rules for darkvision (an ability\
  \ that lets goblins see in the dark just as well as they can see in normal light).\
  \ Those are just the basics—the rules shared by all goblins. Beyond that, your goblin's\
  \ unique ancestry allows you to choose one ability score other than Dexterity or\
  \ Charisma to receive a boost. Perhaps you have some hobgoblin blood and have an\
  \ additional boost to Constitution, or you descend from a long line of goblin alchemists\
  \ and have a boost to Intelligence. You could even gain a boost in Wisdom to negate\
  \ your flaw!</p> \n    <p>Then you get into the goblin ancestry feats, which allow\
  \ you to decide what type of goblin you want to play. Starting off, let's look at\
  \ Burn It. This feat gives you a bonus to damage whenever you cast a fire spell\
  \ or deal fire damage with an alchemical item. On top of that, it also increases\
  \ any persistent fire damage you deal by 1. Goblins still love watching things burn.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Next up is one of my favorites, Junk Tinkerer. A goblin with this feat\
  \ can craft ordinary items and weapons out of junk and scrap they can find almost\
  \ anywhere. Sure, the items are of poor quality and break easily, but you will never\
  \ be without a weapon if you have this feat.</p> \n    <p>We could not have goblins\
  \ in the game without adding the Razor Teeth feat. This grants you an attack with\
  \ your mouthful of razor-sharp teeth that deals 1d6 piercing damage. To be honest,\
  \ the target of your attack should probably also attempt a Fortitude save against\
  \ whatever you ate last night that is still stuck between your teeth, but we'll\
  \ leave that for the GM to decide.</p> \n    <p>Finally, there is the appropriately\
  \ named feat Very Sneaky. This lets you move 5 feet farther when you take an action\
  \ to sneak (which normally lets you move at only half your normal speed) and potentially\
  \ renders your target flat-footed against a follow-up strike!</p> \n    <p>There\
  \ are plenty of other goblin feats for you to choose from, but that's all we have\
  \ time for today. Come back on Friday when we'll look at some of the feats from\
  \ the other ancestries in the game!</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of\
