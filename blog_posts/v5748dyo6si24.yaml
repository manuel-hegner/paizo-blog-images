  \ PaizoCon attendees,</p> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Thank you for attending\
  \ PaizoCon 2022! We hope you had as wonderful a time playing games and participating\
  \ in events as we did putting on the show. It was a much-needed return to PaizoCons\
  \ of yore, and we can’t wait to continue offering in-person convention experiences\
  \ in the years to come.</p> \n      <p>This year’s in-person PaizoCon wasn’t without\
  \ its challenges, however, including several reports of COVID-19 infections among\
  \ attendees. Paizo considers the health and well-being of all community members\
  \ a priority, and we want to take this opportunity to inform you that individuals\
  \ you may have had close contact with at PaizoCon 2022 have tested positive for,\
  \ and/or shown symptoms consistent with, COVID-19. Close contact is defined as having\
  \ shared a game table, panel space, or similar, to the best of our knowledge. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>The following are all reported cases we’re aware of at the time of\
  \ this post. For more up-to-date contact tracing information, please see the <a\
  \ href=\"https://discord.gg/WSdXx7mr\">#contact-tracing</a> channel of the PaizoCon\
  \ Discord server located at <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/ZGTEqnemFx\">https://paizo.events</a>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Report 1:</b> An attendee started experiencing cold-like symptoms\
  \ Monday, May 30, while traveling and tested positive later that evening. Their\
  \ last negative test prior to the convention was before their flight to Seattle\
  \ on Thursday, May 26.</p> \n      <p><b>Report 2:</b> A Paizo staff member reported\
  \ a positive test on Monday, May 30, after taking the test the previous evening.\
  \ They had tested negative the previous Friday morning and had arrived at the show\
  \ on Saturday. They were masked while wandering the show (they had no assigned tasks\
  \ that day) and ate dinner at a nearby restaurant alone. On Sunday morning, they\
  \ felt ill so went home without visiting the show. They tested positive later that\
  \ evening.</p> \n      <p><b>Report 3:</b> Two attendees who traveled to the show\
  \ together and were in each other’s company the entire convention reported positive\
  \ tests on Tuesday afternoon, May 31. They were masked most of the time, but not\
  \ while outdoors or at meals. They were at the hotel bar hangout mostly maskless\
  \ on Saturday night. Both began experiencing symptoms Monday afternoon/evening.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Report 4:</b> An attendee reported testing positive on Tuesday,\
  \ May 31. They flew into the convention the previous Thursday, ate at the hotel\
  \ bar Thursday night and Friday afternoon, attended panels in the streaming room\
  \ Friday through Sunday, and attended the Find the Path and Hideous Laughter podcast\
  \ meetups. They flew back Monday morning and were wearing a mask consistently when\
  \ not eating or drinking.</p> \n      <p><b>Report 5:</b> An attendee reported a\
  \ positive test on Thursday, June 2. They were in the Organized Play room all weekend\
  \ and were masked consistently all weekend except when they ate alone at the hotel\
  \ bar on Friday, and around the lobby cafe at other times.</p> \n      <p><b>Report\
  \ 6:</b> A Paizo staff member reported a positive test on Friday, June 3, after\
  \ a few days of feeling bad. They spent most of their time in the Organized Play\
  \ ballroom. They ate lunch in the hotel restaurant on Friday and Sunday but otherwise\
  \ engaged in no other maskless activities at the convention.</p> \n      <p><b>Report\
  \ 7:</b> A Paizo staff member started experiencing symptoms Friday, June 3 and reported\
  \ a positive test later that morning. The staff member spent most of their time\
  \ at or near registration, did not participate in any panels or gaming events, and\
  \ shared meals mostly with other Paizo staff members.</p> \n      <p><b>Report 8:</b>\
  \ An attendee working the Syrinscape booth in the lobby reported a positive test\
  \ on Friday, June 3.</p> \n      <p>Paizo has reported these cases to the convention\
  \ venue and King County Public Health, and will continue to work in concert with\
  \ them as we monitor the situation.</p> \n      <p>We encourage all PaizoCon attendees\
  \ to test for COVID-19 as soon as possible. Washington state residents can get free\
  \ kits by mail <a href=\"https://sayyescovidhometest.org/\">at this site</a>, all\
  \ US residents can get tests <a href=\"https://www.covid.gov/tests\">at this site</a>,\
  \ and further guidance is available <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/index.html\"\
  >at the CDC’s website</a>.</p> \n      <p> If you do test positive or exhibit symptoms,\
  \ please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:paizocon@paizo.com\">paizocon@paizo.com</a>\
  \ so we can inform others you may have been in close contact with. Your information\
