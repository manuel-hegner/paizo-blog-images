  \ Gross</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial/aPassageToAbsalom\"><i>Click\
  \ here to read this story from the beginning.</i></a></p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two:\
  \ Dry Sherry</h2> \n   <p>\"Please, Captain, you must see it from my perspective.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Captain Qoloth brayed so vigorously that the top of his close-shorn\
  \ head bumped the ceiling. The Katapeshi stood several inches taller than I and\
  \ doubtless carried thrice my weight on his broad frame. His prominent jaws and\
  \ bristly whiskers suggested a parent among that nation's hyenafolk, though my studies\
  \ at the Acadamae suggested that such a hybrid was categorically impossible. Considering\
  \ the bestial odor of his fur-clad body, I reevaluated my understanding of the term\
  \ \"impossible.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Do you know, my half-elven friend, what it is that\
  \ I most enjoy about being captain?\" Qoloth smiled, revealing long canine teeth.\
  \ \"It is that everyone else aboard my ship must see things from my perspective.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Very well.\" My station was no advantage so far from my native land,\
  \ even had I chosen to announce my Chelish origins on a vessel flying the crowned\
  \ white lion of Taldor. My attempts at reason had failed to move Captain Qoloth,\
  \ who noted with perfect logic that the <i>Lacuna Codex</i> had been stolen before\
  \ I came under his protection by boarding his ship. Thus, I was reduced to begging\
  \ the most meager concession. \"Will you at least grant me permission to question\
  \ the other passengers?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Talk all you like. Just remember, there\
  \ is no magic aboard the <i>Lion</i>. And keep your boy out of the other cabins.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Radovan bristled at the dismissive term. It mattered little to him\
  \ that he had, in fact, been spotted attempting to pick the lock of Shadya's cabin\
  \ to search for the missing tome.</p> \n   <p>\"Very well, Captain. Thank you for\
  \ your time.\"</p> \n   <p>Arnisant awaited us on deck. A sea breeze ruffled the\
  \ hound's pewter-gray coat, but the sun's warmth assuaged the winter chill. The\
  \ wolfhound's eyes flicked toward Radovan before settling on me. I bade him heel\
  \ as we strolled the deck, careful not to intrude upon the labors of the crew.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The <i>Lacuna Codex</i> had to be somewhere aboard the <i>Sea Lion</i>.\
  \ Under other circumstances, I would appreciate the captain's insistence that none\
  \ of his guests were to be subjected to physical or magical inspection. For the\
  \ exorbitant price he charged for passage, one expected a modicum of privacy while\
  \ traveling between Taldor and Absalom.</p> \n   <p>Yet someone had absconded with\
  \ my property, and the thief had to be one of my fellow passengers. Apart from the\
  \ crew, who had been nowhere near my luggage before the theft, there were only six\
  \ others aboard. In his own coarse manner, Radovan had already searched Shadya,\
  \ the Qadiran woman who had lifted my purse at the wharf. While not eliminating\
  \ her as a suspect, Radovan's \"inquiry\" left five other likely suspects.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Lord and Lady Neverion seemed innocuous, but it is my business to dispel\
  \ seeming. The wealthy Menas Neverion began life as a butcher, gradually expanding\
  \ his business until he had accumulated sufficient capital to speculate on imports.\
  \ Desna favored his investments, and eventually he bent his vast fortune toward\
  \ his ultimate goal: the title, hand, and lands of the widowed and impoverished\
  \ Lady Charikla. Had catastrophe withered their holdings? The stolen Codex was worth\
  \ a fortune to the right buyer.</p> \n   <p>Or to the wrong one.</p> \n   <p>Pekko\
  \ and Jaska were dwarf merchants conveying cargo to Absalom. They too took the air,\
  \ their breath forming clouds as they walked arm-in-arm on the far side of the deck.\
  \ Pekko threw us a jaunty wave. He was a gregarious sort with bells and charms tied\
  \ in his red-brown beard. Jaska was his opposite in almost every regard, disagreeable\
  \ of countenance with a sooty smudge of a beard and an angry canker-blossom overtaking\
  \ his left nostril. He was the one who seemed most concerned with the safe handling\
  \ of their cargo, the nature of which I had not yet discovered. Did either of these\
  \ ostensible traders harbor a lust for rare tomes?</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Pekko.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Pekko_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br>\"\
  Pekko is likeable enough, if something of a lush. But is his jovial exterior a front\
  \ for something more sinister?\"\n   </div> \n   <p>The young elf called Murviniel\
  \ had revealed himself to be a Pathfinder aspirant, as I had surmised. Once he overcame\
  \ his trepidation, he asked whether I was, as he suspected, \"the famous\" Venture-Captain\
  \ Varian Jeggare. Accustomed as I am to idle flattery, I was surprised that his\
  \ admiration sounded genuine, if born of innocence. Any active Pathfinder would\
  \ know that my once-flourishing reputation had paled. In fact, my latest excursion\
  \ had proven a failure except for the discovery of the now-missing <i>Lacuna Codex</i>.\
  \ Did Murviniel hope to steal for himself the prize that would win back my former\
  \ status?</p> \n   <p>The creak of salt-encrusted hinges interrupted my reverie.\
  \ As the portly Menas Neverion held the door, his delicate wife emerged from below\
  \ decks. She squinted at the white sky as the breeze ruffled the various furs of\
  \ her stole. In her arms shivered a pair of tiny dogs that must have arrived within\
  \ their baggage. Arnisant lifted his snout to catch their scent but remained obediently\
  \ at my side.</p> \n   <p>\"I bet you could eat both of those little rats in one\
  \ bite, couldn't you, Arni?\" Radovan scratched the back of the hound's head.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Please,\" I said. \"Do not confuse my hound by using a diminutive of\
  \ his name.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Arni's not confused,\" said Radovan. \"He's smarter\
  \ than he looks, like you always say about me.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Considerably smarter,\
  \ I hope. All the same—\"</p> \n   <p>\"There you are, my dear fellow.\" Menas Neverion\
  \ bustled toward us, extending his hand to grasp mine as if I were some common broker\
  \ of fortunes. I countered his unseemly greeting by offering a curt Chelish bow.\
  \ He withdrew the offending appendage and fiddled with a button on his fur coat.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Your Excellency, my husband wishes to invite you to sample his sherry\
  \ this evening,\" said Lady Neverion. She stroked a finger across the heads of the\
  \ tiny dogs cradled in her arm. They trembled and strained their little necks for\
  \ a view of Arnisant. \"If the sherry pleases the foremost count of Cheliax, it\
  \ should dazzle the connoisseurs of Absalom.\"</p> \n   <p>While I had taken no\
  \ special pains to conceal my identity, I had not expected to be known among the\
  \ other passengers. Only Murviniel had recognized me, and I now wondered how. Certainly\
  \ my name was well known among members of the Society, but my image was not so commonly\
  \ distributed. Even setting aside that question, either Murviniel had identified\
  \ me to Lady Charikla, or else some other intelligence allowed her to identify me\
  \ by title.</p> \n   <p>Lady Neverion anticipated my question. \"We were never formally\
  \ introduced, my dear Count. I glimpsed you once, some years ago, during a procession\
  \ in Oppara. You cut quite the dashing figure among the Chelish emissaries. I pray\
  \ you won't think me forward when I say you appear quite unchanged.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  My lady is most kind,\" I replied with a more courtly bow than I had offered her\
  \ husband. Menas appeared undisturbed by the attention she shone upon me, but I\
  \ could not return the compliment, for I had no recollection of the lady. My most\
  \ recent visit to Oppara had occurred more than forty years earlier, when I served\
  \ a minor role in a diplomatic gesture following the revolutions in Galt and Andoran.\
  \ Unless some magic were responsible for preserving her appearance, Charikla must\
  \ have been little more than a child at the time of my visit. A sudden eructation\
  \ drew my attention. The sound emanated from my hound. Arnisant gazed up at Charikla's\
  \ little dogs, who yipped in fear. With a sign, Radovan directed him to move farther\
  \ away. Charikla cradled her darlings to her breast.</p> \n   <p>Before I could\
  \ frame an apology, Menas spoke again.</p> \n   <p>\"Do be a good fellow and join\
  \ us for a drink before supper.\" He glanced to the side and waved at Pekko as the\
  \ dwarves completed their latest circuit of the deck. Pekko waved back, but sour-faced\
  \ Jaska tugged him down the stairs to the cabins. Menas added, \"We've invited everyone,\
  \ and I promise I won't be stingy, even though it's very expensive stuff.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Lady Neverion glanced away from her husband's crass remark. Radovan cleared\
  \ his throat to cover a chuckle. Even to one raised on the streets of Egorian, the\
  \ pretensions of this merchant lord were risible.</p> \n   <p>\"I would be honored,\"\
  \ I said.</p> \n   <p>\"And do bring your man,\" he added. \"I've invited that Qadiran\
  \ girl. What do you think? They'll add a bit of color.\"</p> \n   <p>Menas grinned,\
  \ awaiting my approval. His wife's eyes narrowed as she considered my bodyguard.\
  \ Radovan smiled without revealing his teeth, but I knew he was stifling the urge\
  \ to wink at her. That was wise, for Lady Neverion was doubtless unaccustomed to\
  \ including hellspawn or pickpockets in her social gatherings.</p> \n   <p>\"We\
  \ should be honored,\" I said.</p> \n   <p>\"Don't bring your hound, of course.\
  \ My lady wife's precious little creatures are not among the hors d'oeuvres.\" He\
  \ leaned in to whisper, \"Not that I'd mind the quiet afterward!\"</p> \n   <p>Radovan\
  \ snorted. Charikla turned away, murmuring assurances to her noisy little dogs until\
  \ Menas offered her his arm and escorted her around the deck.</p> \n   <p></p>\n\
  \   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>We arrived at the Neverions'\
  \ cabin twenty minutes after the appointed hour. I wished to observe the dynamics\
  \ established among the other passengers in my absence. Also, it would not do for\
  \ a count of Cheliax to stand awaiting the arrival of those of lesser status.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The chamber was larger than I had expected, even considering the high\
  \ price Captain Qoloth charged his passengers. Not even the enormous master of the\
  \ ship had any need to stoop beneath the seven-foot ceiling. His evening clothes\
  \ included a hyena-pelt cape that only exacerbated his resemblance to the hyenafolk.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>For the occasion I had chosen an embroidered coat to wear over a linen\
  \ shirt with laced cuffs. Radovan's leather garb was barely presentable, but none\
  \ of my clothing would fit his wide chest. I insisted that he wear a soft gray half-cape\
  \ I had made for myself in Caliphas.</p> \n   <p>The Neverions appeared well appointed\
  \ as usual, all fine furs and tasteful jewelry, the selection of which I attributed\
  \ to Lady Charikla rather than her husband. Menas laughed as he poured another drink\
  \ for the jocular Pekko, who held two large wine goblets rather than the dainty\
  \ sherry crystals held by the other guests. Despite the effort to appear unconcerned,\
  \ I could see Menas wince slightly as he calculated the cost of every drop he poured\
  \ for the seemingly insatiable dwarf. The dwarves had donned gray waistcoats over\
  \ fresh linen shirts, but Pekko had already managed to stain his cuffs while quaffing\
  \ sherry from both goblets. Judging by his rosy cheeks and the ever-increasing volume\
  \ of his voice, he had already imbibed plenty, and he had a bottle of his own nestled\
  \ into one of his trouser pockets.</p> \n   <p>I started toward the group, but then\
  \ I heard Radovan's intake of breath. I followed his gaze to the other side of the\
  \ cabin.</p> \n   <p>Shadya appeared less a thief and more a lady in loose silken\
  \ trousers draped as sensuously as a skirt over her long legs. Over a beaded shirt\
  \ she wore a brilliant azure vest of crushed velvet, its stiff fabric somehow failing\
  \ to conceal the curves of breasts and hips. Subtle patterns appeared in the fabric\
  \ as she moved, betraying its fine quality. Either Shadya was an exceptionally successful\
  \ thief, or else she picked pockets for the thrill of the act.</p> \n   <p>Radovan\
  \ straightened. Before he could take a step toward the woman, she lifted her chin\
  \ and turned away. Radovan jutted his jaw, deterred for now.</p> \n   <p>\"Captain\
  \ Jeggare?\"</p> \n   <p>Murviniel appeared at my elbow. Alone among the guests,\
  \ he appeared out of place. His robes were the color of old sailcloth, and his tri-corner\
  \ hat was unfashionable even in Andoran where it had once been popular. His only\
  \ ornament was a cheap brass ring on which was stamped the emblem of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society.</p> \n   <p>\"There's only one captain on this ship, by Abadar!\" Qoloth's\
  \ voice thundered across the cabin, but his wide grin belied his threatening tone.\
  \ He drained his glass and held it out for Menas to refill. The trader obliged,\
  \ tugging at his tight collar as the captain joined Pekko in guzzling his expensive\
  \ sherry.</p> \n   <p>\"While we are aboard ship, you must address me as Count Jeggare.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I beg your pardon, Your Grace.\"</p> \n   <p>\"'Excellency' is the\
  \ traditional honorific.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'm sorry, Your Excellency.\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Radovan moved away, but not before I saw him roll his eyes.</p> \n   <p>I waved\
  \ away Murviniel's apology. It is acceptable to dispense with formality in the field,\
  \ but the young elf was not yet a member, only an applicant to the Society.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"How is it that you recognized me?\" I asked.</p> \n   <p>Murviniel lowered\
  \ his eyes. \"The truth is, Your Excellency, you are my idol.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Your\
  \ what?\"</p> \n   <p>\"My hero,\" he said. \"You travel the world and uncover secrets\
  \ no one else has ever found, even other Pathfinders. My copy of your <i>Bestiary\
  \ of Garund</i> has fallen to pieces, I have read it so often. I want to be just\
  \ like you.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Your words are…gratifying.\" It was now my turn to feel\
  \ flustered, but before I could recover my composure I saw Menas Neverion pull at\
  \ his collar again, this time with far more force. The man's face had turned dark\
  \ red. His eyes bulged, the veins darkening as they spread toward his iris.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Beside Menas, Pekko peered into his goblets, one after the other, glassy-eyed\
  \ and seemingly oblivious to the events around him. Charikla recoiled from her husband,\
  \ her face a mask of revulsion as she realized the extent of his distress. Qoloth\
  \ squinted suspiciously at the choking merchant before reaching out to steady the\
  \ man.</p> \n   <p>\"Help him!\" cried Charikla. Jaska grabbed Menas and eased the\
  \ man to the carpet. The others all moved at once, some toward and others away from\
  \ the fallen merchant. I pushed through the crowd and felt the man's throat.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Too late.\" I said. \"He is already dead.\"</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next\
  \ Week:</b> Theft turns to murder, and an elegant ship becomes a dangerous prison\
  \ in Chapter Three of \"A Passage to Absalom.\"</p> \n   <p><i>Dave Gross is the\
