  \ Appendix â€“ Sean K Reynolds (Part 2)</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 17,\
  \ 2009</p> \n   <p>Here follows Part 2 of my interview with Developer Sean K Reynolds,\
  \ game designer extraordinaire and all-around nice guy, in which he discusses how\
  \ he differentiates Golarion's deities from the gods of <i>Greyhawk</i> and the\
  \ <i>Forgotten Realms</i>, and gives a list of the works that most influenced his\
  \ game design.</p> \n   <p><b>David</b>: Is it hard to make Golarion's gods different\
  \ from those of other campaign settings?</p> \n   <p><b>Sean</b>; My technique is\
  \ to approach the gods like they're people, with their own motivations and agendas.\
  \ In fact, many of Golarion's deities were once mortals themselves; and, because\
  \ the world itself is so old, often I can just ask myself, \"What would these deities\
  \ have been doing this whole time?\" I really try to explore each god's niche. In\
  \ terms of making them different than the gods of <i>Greyhawk</i> and the <i>Forgotten\
  \ Realms</i>, the history and cosmology of Golarion naturally differentiate them.\
  \ A good example of this is Oerth's Pelor and Mayaheine versus Golarion's Aroden\
  \ and Iomedae; the structure of the relationship between the deities is similar\
  \ (an older, male deity mentoring a younger, female warrior deity), but a few obvious\
  \ differences are that Pelor is a benevolent god while Aroden is more neutral, and\
  \ Mayaheine is a defensive deity whereas Iomedae is an active crusader against evil.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>David</b>: Briefly give me a list of some of the most influential works\
  \ you've encountered.</p> \n   <p><b>Sean</b>: As a younger kid, the books that\
  \ made the most impression on me were Lloyd Alexander's books about Taran the Wanderer,\
  \ which discuss old magic, learning your place in the world, and the apocalypse;\
  \ Madeline L'Engle's <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> series (which includes super-science\
  \ and biblical references), Anne McCaffrey's Pern books, and Piers Anthony's Xanth\
  \ and Incarnations of Immortality series. In my teens I chewed through Edgar Rice\
  \ Burroughs's Mars books, Norman Winski's <i>The Sword and the Sorcerer</i>, Larry\
  \ Niven's linked fantasy stories (\"The Magic Goes Away,\" \"What Good is a Glass\
  \ Dagger?\", and so on), Fred Saberhagen's Book of Swords series, Robert Asprin's\
  \ Myth series, some collections put together by Isaac Asimov (<i>Wizards</i>, <i>Witches</i>,\
  \ and so on), and the Thieves' World books (also edited by Robert Asprin), as well\
  \ as anything by Stephen King and Clive Barker.</p> \n   <p>Growing up the in '80s,\
  \ we also had a lot of cool, weird, and bad inspirational fantasy and SF movies\
  \ as well: <i>Clash of the Titans</i>, <i>Conan the Barbarian</i> <i>Labyrinth</i>,\
  \ <i>Hawk the Slayer</i>, <i>The Sword and the Sorcerer</i>, <i>The Dark Crystal</i>,\
  \ <i>Barbarians</i>, <i>Dragonslayer</i>, <i>Krull</i>, the Rankin-Bass version\
  \ of <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>Highlander</i>, <i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>Akira</i>, and\
  \ Ralph Bashki's animated features (<i>Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>Wizards</i>, and\
  \ <i>Fire and Ice</i>). </p> \n   <p>This concludes my interview with Sean K Reynolds.\
  \ Thanks for reading the Fabled Appendix, Paizonians! I hope you've enjoyed it as\
  \ much as I've enjoyed interviewing the fine game designers at Paizo!</p> \n   <p>David\
