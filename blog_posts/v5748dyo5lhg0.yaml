  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As we\
  \ head into summer here in the Northern Hemisphere, convention activity is heating\
  \ up. But before we talk about the Adventure Card Guild at a convention near you,\
  \ we have some news to wrap up Season of the Shackles!</p> \n     <h2>Season of\
  \ the Shackles Cards Available at DriveThru!</h2> The <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/148979/Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Guild-Season-of-the-Shackles-Complete-Set?manufacturers_id=5549\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Season of the Shackles Complete Card Set</a> is now available\
  \ via our print-on-demand partners at DriveThru Cards. It includes all of the new\
  \ cards we created throughout the season, including 6 copies of the Councilor's\
  \ Ring reward. It also includes additional copies of the Skull &amp; Shackles cards\
  \ that previously required you to use proxy cards during the season. (It does *not*\
  \ include the Season of the Shackles scenarios—those are available <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pfsacg/products/season0\"\
  >here</a>.) We have also made available the <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/148982/Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Guild-Season-of-the-Shackles-Councilors-Ring?manufacturers_id=5549\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Councilor's Ring</a> as a single card. (Note that DriveThru\
  \ has a 10-card minimum, which you could meet with multiple copies of the Ring,\
  \ the <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/browse/pub/5549/Paizo\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Rise of the Runelords errata sets</a>, cards made with DriveThru's <a href=\"\
  http://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder\" target=\"_blank\">PACG Custom\
  \ Card Creator</a>, or any other cards DriveThru sells.)\n     <p></p> \n     <h2>May\
  \ 2015: PaizoCon</h2> \n     <p>In just under two weeks, Paizo will be hosting the\
  \ eighth annual <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>, a celebration of Paizo's games\
  \ and the fans who play them. This year, PaizoCon coincides with the launch of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9a46\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</em></a>, as\
  \ well as the launch of the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhcs\">Season of the\
  \ Righteous</a> for the <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>.\
  \ PaizoCon attendees will be able to play Adventure 1 of the new season before it's\
  \ released to stores and regional shows, as well as testing a tournament format\
  \ that will run at Gen Con. More on that in a bit. (PaizoCon attendees: Prepare\
  \ to be my guinea pigs!)</p> \n     <p>It's likely we'll run an impromptu marathon\
  \ of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"><em>Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</em></a> and/or <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season0\">Season of the Shackles</a>\
  \ for the nautically minded among you. Attendees will also have the opportunity\
  \ to meet the entire Pathfinder Adventure Card Game design, editorial, and production\
  \ teams (except the lovely but deeply wrong-headed Keith Richmond, who lives on\
  \ the incorrect coast and knows nothing about what makes a character great.) <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhd2\">Obsidian Entertainment</a> will also be at\
  \ the show. If you're one of the sad people who can't make it to Seattle for the\
  \ show, Scenarios A and B of Adventure 1 and Version 2 of the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Adventure Card Guild Guide will be out that week as well. Badges are available\
  \ until May 14, so <a href=\"/paizocon\">register today if you want to come and\
  \ play with us</a>!</p> \n     <h2>June 2015: Origins</h2> \n     <p>The first weekend\
  \ in June, Mike, Chad, I will be traveling to to Columbus, Ohio for the <a href=\"\
  http://originsgamefair.com\" target=\"_blank\">Origins Game Fair</a>. Paizo will\
  \ have an Adventure Card Game area in Hall D; we're on the right side behind the\
  \ AEG booth. We'll be running demos of <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, as well\
  \ as Adventures 1 and 2 (!) of the Season of the Righteous. (Origins attendees:\
  \ Prepare to be my guinea pigs!) Hopefully, Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream will back\
  \ up and running so we can get some tasty dairy treats. Mmmm, Jeni's.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Origins Adventure Card Guild events will run from 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM Wednesday\
  \ through Saturday in Hall D, and 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM on Sunday.</p> \n     <h2>July\
  \ 2015: Gen Con</h2> \n     <p>The best four days in gaming happen at the end of\
  \ July in Indianapolis at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con\
  \ </a>. Paizo takes over the massive Sagamore Ballroom at the Indiana Convention\
  \ Center. We'll be bringing the first three adventures of Season of the Righteous,\
  \ as well as my new baby, the first annual <b>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Open</b>.\
  \ The PACG Open is a team-based card game tournament, where your team of four players\
  \ will test your mettle and your PACG rules knowledge against a mean, cruel, fiendish,\
  \ dastardly scenario designed by yours truly. If your team does well enough, you\
  \ could advance to the semi-finals and maybe even to the finals of the event on\
  \ Sunday morning. The tournament winners will each receive truly epic bragging rights\
  \ and a complete set of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game set of their choice,\
  \ including promo cards (must be an already-released AP, rules lawyers) and whatever\
  \ other exciting things we come up with.</p> \n     <p>Gen Con Adventure Card Guild\
  \ events will run from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM Thursday and Friday, 8:00 AM to midnight\
  \ on Saturday, and 8:00 AM to noon on Sunday. PACG Open first-round tables will\
  \ run at 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM (buy tickets!), semi-final rounds will run at 2:00\
  \ PM and 4:00 PM on Saturday, and the final round will run at 10:00 AM Sunday. Gen\
  \ Con event registration opens Sunday at noon Eastern Standard Time, so get ready\
  \ to sign up!</p> \n     <h2>August 2015: PAX</h2> \n     <p>The Card Team will\
  \ be at PAX! We'll be running card games and handing out promos. That's all I know\
  \ for now.</p> \n     <p>Finally, because I couldn't bear to let a week go by without\
  \ another card spoiler, I give you... the Splendiferous Hat!</p> \n     <div class=\"\
