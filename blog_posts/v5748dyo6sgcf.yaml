  \   <p itemprop=\"description\">October brings with it all manner of spooky gifts!\
  \ While this month's Starfinder releases may not as overtly spooky in nature as\
  \ some past releases, I can assure you that both scenarios involve some scenes that\
  \ scream for GMs to ramp up the tension. Let's dive into this month's offerings.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Our first scenario for this month, <a href=\"/products/btq01va4?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-124-Siege-of-Enlightenment\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-24: Siege of Enlightenment</i></a> really comes\
  \ from a conversation I had with Organized Play Lead Developer, John Compton, regarding\
  \ other civilizations near to the Pact Worlds. We both agreed that we wanted to\
  \ show some minor powers throughout the region and bring in future allies/foes we\
  \ could later call upon. This scenario showcases two previously unheard of powers\
  \ in relative proximity to the Pact Worlds and a growing conflict that threatens\
  \ to destroy them both. Tineke Bolleman, who you may recognize as one of the quest\
  \ authors from <a href=\"/products/btpya08w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-16-Dreaming-of-the-Future\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-16: Dreaming of the Future</i></a> jumped right\
  \ into the task of creating two new space-faring civilizations and the I think the\
  \ results speak for themselves. Fans of more traditional Pathfinder won't be disappointed,\
  \ as this month's Tier 1-4 scenario also brings a fan favorite species into the\
  \ Starfinder limelight: hobgoblins!</p> \n    <p>Now, Organized Play Lead Developer,\
  \ John Compton, is going to take some time to tell you about this month's second\
  \ scenario!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20181025-MP8.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20181025-MP8_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <br><i>Illustration by Michele Giorgi</i>\n     <p></p>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>For many months, Adrian Ng has been the behind-the-scenes\
  \ champion of organized play, which is to say he's taken the lead in editing most\
  \ of our scenarios. As you might guess, he's very familiar with not only our style\
  \ but also our stories, and the time was right for him to show off has narrative\
  \ skills with <a href=\"/starfindersociety\">Starfinder Society's</a> latest repeatable\
  \ scenario, <a href=\"/products/btq01va5?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-125-The-Beacon-Code-Dilemma\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-25: The Beacon Code Dilemma</i></a>. Not only\
  \ does this explore some of the Society's past and the machine god Triune's lore\
  \ (including an influential priest, pictured here), but it's also a fun romp through\
  \ space in search of a lost starship and priceless artifactâ€”classic! Adrian's included\
  \ a lot of fun ways to vary the experience, providing fun ways for the GM to both\
  \ personalize some of the discoveries and shake up the combats. Be sure to check\
  \ out this Tier 3-6 scenario.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>So with all that,\
  \ I think you can see why we're pretty darn excited for October's offerings. Stop\
  \ by the blog next month, when we'll be previewing the next set of scenarios, including\
  \ our first scenario for a brand new faction that some of you may already be familiar\
  \ with. Speaking of familiarity, fans of Pathfinder Society are in for a treat as\
  \ we explore a Starfinder follow-up to one of Pathfinder's earliest scenarios!</p>\
