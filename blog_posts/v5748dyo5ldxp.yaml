  articleBody\"> \n     <p>Last night we finished up session 35 of James Jacobs's\
  \ office campaign, which has morphed into an adaptation of Gary Gygax's classic\
  \ fantasy Egyptian superdungeon, <i>Necropolis</i>. James has done a lot to make\
  \ the adventure his own, including transporting it to the nation of Osirion in the\
  \ Pathfinder world, and adding several devious traps and monsters not in the original\
  \ adventure.</p> \n     <p>But we're still in ancient tombs and pyramids and stuff,\
  \ though, so if one thing has changed, it's that we're running into a LOT more undead\
  \ these days.</p> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Which brings me to today's\
  \ preview of upcoming figures from the Shattered Star set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic miniatures! The set supports the brand-new\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>,\
  \ which sets the players on a quest around Varisia to reunite an ancient artifact\
  \ created by the progenitor of the Runelords. It's a sort of sequel to other Varisia-based\
  \ Adventure Paths, including Rise of the Runelords, Curse of the Crimson Throne,\
  \ and Second Darkness, but the campaign also stands alone as a self-contained Adventure\
  \ Path.</span></p> \n     <p>And, truth be told, it's got a fair number of undead.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Here are two of them, both ready to menace your player characters and\
  \ both slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120928-SkeletalChampion.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120928-SkeletalChampion_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Up first is the Skeletal Champion, a\
  \ figure I've wanted to create since I first saw his illustration in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>. We later used the same illustration\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tj5\">Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</a>, where the\
  \ Skeletal Champion is one of the major antagonists provided in the set. I've long\
  \ had a goal to create miniatures of every monster in that set, so when it came\
  \ time to plan the Shattered Star miniatures set (and the Shattered Star Adventure\
  \ Path itself), I asked James Jacobs to make sure to include a skeletal champion\
  \ somewhere in the campaign. He obliged, and I finally got my miniature.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120928-Lich.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120928-Lich_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The Mummy Cleric is a similar story. Back when we\
  \ were doing the Rise of the Runelords set, we almost slipped in a \"Thassilonian\
  \ Mummy\" figure, partly because a few appeared in the Adventure Path, and partly\
  \ because the <a href=\"/products/btpy8qj2\">Mummy</a> in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, our first Pathfinder Battles set, looked a lot more\
  \ like a rank-and-file bruiser from a Scooby Doo episode than a chilling, memorable\
  \ villain. </p> \n     <p>The Thassilonian Mummy didn't make the final cut for Runelords,\
  \ so when it came time to create the Shattered Star outline, I asked James if he\
  \ might include more Thassilonian Mummies in the new campaign (which was, after\
  \ all, set in the ruins of Thassilon). We then asked artist Tyler Walpole to draw\
  \ what one of these guys might look like, and he came up with a skull-faced menace\
  \ that blew our socks off.</p> \n     <p>Accordingly, this figure is now one of\
  \ the tougher opponents PCs will face in the campaign. He's still Thassilonian,\
  \ but he's his own villain, a nasty undead cleric of Groetus, God of the End Times.\
  \ We call him (appropriately enough) the Mummy Cleric.</p> \n     <p>Good luck with\
  \ this one, player characters!</p> \n     <p>That's it for this week. I have other\
  \ undead I could show you, but we have a few more weeks to go before things get\
  \ really spoooooky for Halloween.</p> \n     <p>I have tricks, and I have treats.</p>\
