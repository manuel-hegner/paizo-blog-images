  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Now that Gen Con is behind us, it's\
  \ time to once again resume our weekly look at the next wave of Pathfinder Battles\
  \ pre-painted plastic miniatures from WizKids, October's <a href=\"/products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker\"\
  >Kingmaker</a>!</p> \n    <p>This week we explore a few figures in the set that\
  \ are more than their initial appearance might suggest, either due to the creatures'\
  \ special abilities or hidden histories. First among these deceptive creatures is\
  \ the wild spriggan, a common Small figure. While these goblin-like relatives of\
  \ gnomes are only a few feet tall in their normal form, they can transform into\
  \ hulking brutes in an instant. The large spriggan is a Large uncommon figure, meaning\
  \ most GMs should get enough of spriggans across both sizes to build a sizable (pun\
  \ fully intended) war band.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-Spriggan.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-Spriggan_500.jpeg\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180817-LargeSpriggan_500.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>While changing size is a pretty neat ability, it doesn't necessarily\
  \ help spriggans hide from potential prey or lurking threats. For that ability,\
  \ one need look no farther than the gargoyle, which appears in two different forms\
  \ in Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker. The first, an uncommon Medium figure places\
  \ the creature on a standard round base, and depicts it in an action-packed battle\
  \ pose, while the second, a similarly sized, unbased piece of dungeon dressing,\
  \ appears as an intricate but completely benign statue adorning a gothic rooftop.\
  \ While the pictured images depict the figures painted different colors, we asked\
  \ WizKids to standardize their coloration across the two figures so a GM could place\
  \ the latter as \"set dressing\" and then swap it for the former when the creature\
  \ reveals its true nature. When we get final production samples, we'll update the\
  \ images from these digital renders to actual photographs.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, we have the first of our weekly previews of\
  \ the set's many player character-appropriate miniatures, based off the companions\
  \ from the forthcoming <a href=\"http://owlcatgames.com/\">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a>\
  \ computer RPG from Owlcat Games (launching worldwide on September 25)! While I\
  \ won't reveal the exact nature of this figure's secret, I will say that Tristian,\
  \ Human Cleric—a Medium uncommon figure—is perhaps the most enigmatic and inscrutable\
  \ companion in the game, and his storyline is one I'm most excited to see the community\
  \ uncover when the game comes out. Armed with a Sarenite holy symbol, Tristian makes\
  \ a great stand-in for clerics of the Dawnflower in any Pathfinder campaign.</p>\
