  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Back in January, when I learned that PaizoCon was the\
  \ first week of July, I knew we would be tying Archerfeast into the Grand Convocation\
  \ somehow. The fact that Archerfeast falls on Erastus 3rd on Golarion made for a\
  \ perfect fit for today's Pathfinder Society blog post.</p> \n    <p>Managing Editor,\
  \ F. Wesley Schneider, wrote the description below detailing Archerfeast, and beneath\
  \ that you'll find a special Pathfinder Society Chronicle sheet you can download\
  \ and apply to a Pathfinder Society character. Archerfeast is mentioned on page\
  \ 249 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner\
  \ Sea World Guide</i></a>.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Across Avistan, few\
  \ festival days are as anticipated or celebrated as widely as Archerfeast. Despite\
  \ the holiday's origins in the worship of Erastil, common countryfolk from the Lands\
  \ of the Linnorm Kings to Taldor celebrate the height of summer with a day set aside\
  \ for establishing new relationships, enjoying current camaraderie, and celebrating\
  \ the gifts of the gods. </p> \n     <p>While the festival's traditions emphasize\
  \ contests of marksmanship—still a prominent part of any Archerfeast celebration—\
  most have expanded to exhibit talents of all types, from baking and storytelling\
  \ to racing and mock combat. Aside from encouraging a fair-like atmosphere, many\
  \ of the displays and competitions serve one of two secondary purposes: either as\
  \ a way for merchants to show off their superior livestock and wares, or—more popularly—\
  as a way for eligible men and women to show off to each other. </p> \n     <p>While\
  \ the day's events at most Archerfeast fairs are filled with games, food, and crafts,\
  \ the night brings dancing, drinking, pranks, and the crowning of the princes and\
  \ princesses of spring and summer for the two single youths and two single adults\
  \ who faired best in the day's events. The festivities continue late into the evening,\
  \ but end promptly at midnight, so that—in true Erastilian fashion—the next day's\
  \ responsibilities are not overly impeded. For those not of Erastil's flock, however,\
  \ private parties, drinking, and trysting carry on long into the next morning.</p>\
