  date\">Thursday, January 19, 2012</p> \n   <p>It snows in Seattle every now and\
  \ then. Usually not much, but when the entire region is on a 90 degree incline,\
  \ a little goes a long way… toward sliding your vehicle into a freezing body of\
  \ water. Some of you might remember the mixture of caution, fear, and hilarity that\
  \ lead to <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/community/offTopic/archives/wesSchneiderUrbanCastaway\"\
  >my own snow-stranding last year</a>. That totally had no influence on the fact\
  \ that I now live amid the apartments typically referred to here as Paizo East,\
  \ a whopping three blocks from the office. So, when the Great Flurry of ’12 hit,\
  \ I sledded down the hill to collect the blizzard of “Out of the Office” e-mails.\
  \ Lets see what we’ve got:</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/SnowedIn-Liz.jpg\"\

  \  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Jerome Virnich, Editorial Intern</b><br> Wes. Unfortunately\
  \ I'm under the weather, both literally and figuratively. Still planning on being\
  \ there on Friday. Hope you're well!</p> \n    <p><b>Mike Brock, Campaign Coordinator\
  \ &amp; Survivalist</b><br> Hi all. After sliding backwards down the 150 yard hill\
  \ in my apartment complex, I gave up trying to drive to work. I hear Seattle has\
  \ a great bus system so went to their website. My results from here to work:</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Trip Planner<br> Error Planning Trip<br> (#20007--Trip not possible)<br>\
  \ Modify Trip</i></p> \n    <p>So, looks like I'm working from home today.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Judy Bauer, Disaster Opportunist</b><br> Mutinying for Snow Days! In\
  \ a shocking twist, I'll be editing from home again today. Currently rolling on\
  \ the AP adventure.</p> \n    <p><b>Jason Bulmahn, Senior Snowman Wrassler</b><br>\
  \ Yetis stole my car. I am pretty sure they are doing donuts in the intersection.\
  \ Sean, Judy, and I are going to be staying home today. I've got work banked up\
  \ still and will be taking breaks to yell at those damn yetis. Stay warm everyone.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Erik Mona, Snowscarred</b><br> Folks. After last year's 520-ocalypse,\
  \ I'm playing it safe with the snow this year. I've got a pile of work to do here\
  \ at home today, so I'll be editing and working on emails all day today (and possibly\
  \ tomorrow, given the way people on the radio are freaking out). If you need me,\
  \ please call.</p> \n    <p><b>Lisa Stevens, Lives on a Mountain</b><br> You Redmond\
  \ folks don't know what snow is! And this with the snowpocalypse major snow not\
  \ even fallen yet! You may not see us until spring! :)</p> \n    <p>[Picture of\
  \ Hoth omitted]</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>From the incomplete nature of this\
  \ list I can only assume that many others are wandering about disoriented or huddled\
  \ cozily in their tauntauns. Some though—like James Sutter who owns a parachute\
  \ and had a toboggan delivered to the office last week—we might never see again.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Stay frosty everyone.</p> \n   <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br> <i>Managing\
