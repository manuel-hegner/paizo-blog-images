  \ Down The Door</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, July 25, 2007</p> \n   <p>That\
  \ more people don't know the name C. L. Moore is one of the biggest tragedies in\
  \ science fiction and fantasy. This October, Planet Stories plans to do everything\
  \ we can to change that.</p> \n   <p>First published in <i>Weird Tales</i> in 1934,\
  \ Catherine Lucille Moore was writing science fiction and fantasy in a time where\
  \ female authors were rare across the board, and practically unheard of in genre\
  \ fiction. Abbreviating her name to hide her gender, Moore quickly rose through\
  \ the ranks of the pulp authors, publishing alongside contemporaries like Robert\
  \ E. Howard and even earning praise from H. P. Lovecraft himself. (So successful\
  \ was her disguise, in fact, that she first met fellow SF author Henry Kuttner when\
  \ he wrote her a fan letter believing her to be a man. The two were married a few\
  \ years later, and went on to collaborate extensively.) What's more, she continued\
  \ to excel once her gender became known, and in doing so paved the way for countless\
  \ female fantasy and science fiction authors to come. </p> \n   <p>In <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy7x8d\"><i>Black God's Kiss</i></a>, we've collected all six Jirel\
  \ of Joiry stories, in which Moore introduced the world to the first-ever female\
  \ fantasy protagonist. Where the pulp stories around her were filled with distressed\
  \ damsels and helpless shrinking violets in need of rescue, Jirel burst onto the\
  \ scene larger than life. Sword swinging, teeth ready to tear out the throats of\
  \ her enemies, Jirel ruled her domain in Moore's medieval France analogue with an\
  \ iron fist, holding it against all comers through the strength of her blade. Moore's\
  \ moody, illustrative prose was equally anomalous for the time period, and from\
  \ the hellish landscape beneath Jirel's castle to the fields of alien ghouls in\
  \ \"Quest of the Starstone,\" Moore's boundless imagination continues to inspire\
  \ fans and authors to this day.</p> \n   <p>As noted SF author Suzy McKee Charnas\
  \ points out in the introduction, C. L. Moore and Jirel of Joiry didn't just open\
  \ the door for women in science fiction and fantasyâ€”they kicked it down. Male or\
  \ female, <i>Black God's Kiss</i> is a must-have for any serious fantasy enthusiast.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Come read the stories that started a revolution. You won't be disappointed.</p>\
