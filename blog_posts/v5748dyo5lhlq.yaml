  \ The Beginning</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Saturday, June 13, 2015</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>It turns out: I like writing blogs. And here\
  \ you thought you got rid of me!</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">For the past\
  \ six months, I have been very focused on <em>Pathfinder Online</em> now that it\
  \ has been released into the wild. Since January, we have had nine large releases\
  \ of content, and we've progressed to the point where I am really happy with the\
  \ game and the community that has built up around it. So I'm going to be writing\
  \ this weekly blog each Saturday to keep you up to date about the cool things going\
  \ on in <em>Pathfinder Online</em> and to let you in on what is coming down the\
  \ turnpike. Think of it as an Auntie Lisa's Story Blog with a focus on <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Online</em>!</p> \n    <h2>Starting Has Never Been Easier</h2> \n    <p>With the\
  \ latest release this past week, <em>Pathfinder Online</em> has entered a new realm\
  \ of convenience and ease. The new patch focused on the new player experience, providing\
  \ a new improved tutorial, an improvement to the maps in the game, and most importantly,\
  \ newly improved tool tips which provide enhanced information to the player on what\
  \ something does and how to most effectively use it. <em>Pathfinder Online</em>,\
  \ like the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, is a fairly complex and detailed game, so\
  \ providing lots of information for players is paramount.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150613-GW-1_player_startup_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <em>A new player gets advice outside of Thornkeep</em> \n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>It is also way easier to get into the game and start playing. Every new\
  \ account comes with a <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com/download\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >free 15-day trial period</a>. At the end of that period, you just start paying\
  \ your $15 per month subscription fee to keep playing. No box price. No levels of\
  \ membership. Just one small price per month for countless hours of entertainment!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Monsters, Monsters Everywhere!</h2> \n    <p>While <em>Pathfinder Online</em>\
  \ has had a wide variety of your typical bestiary monsters such as goblins, skeletons,\
  \ ogres, bandits, wolves, and more, we keep adding new monsters to the game, and\
  \ I'd like to acquaint you with the two most recent additions.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx?Pathfinder-Module-The-Emerald-Spire-Superdungeon\"\
  >Emerald Spire Superdungeon</a> is at the heart of many of the bad things that plague\
  \ the Echo Wood region of the River Kingdoms. The Emerald Spire itself delves deep\
  \ into the earth, opening up rifts into the Darklands. One group that used the Spire\
  \ to enter the region is the duergar slavers. The dark dwarves have found fertile\
  \ ground for their slave raids amongst the folks of the Echo Wood and the heroes\
  \ need to push them back to their dark home. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150613-GW-2_duergar_360.jpeg\"></a>\n     <br>\
  \ <em>Fighting back the duergar slavers!</em> \n    </div> \n    <p>Like any good\
  \ invasion force, the Duergar are well rounded in their roles. The fighting force\
  \ is made up of Warriors, Soldiers and Defenders. They also have Scouts and Silencers\
  \ to sneak around and do rogue-type stuff. Their ranged groups are made up of the\
  \ Junior and Senior Artillery squads as well as the Bombers. Every army needs its\
  \ divine support and the Priests of the Duergar do Drokar's work well. Finally,\
  \ the wizardly sages provide spells in support of their compatriots. Because of\
  \ their diversity, the Duergar are one of the harder groups to fight in the game,\
  \ able to provide stout fighters along with destructive ranged combat and spells.\
  \ They have been testing the mettle of all since their arrival on the scene.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The other group of creatures that has recently made the Echo Wood more\
  \ deadly are the elementals that have been unleashed. Once again, the Emerald Spire\
  \ is the culprit for this invasion of aggressive elementals. Ranging in size from\
  \ rather cute small elementals all the way up to towering huge elementals, the diversity\
  \ in challenges is unparalleled. These elemental harness many types of elemental\
  \ energies, from the fiery Magma Elementals, to the dusty Sand Elementals, to the\
  \ rocky Earth Elementals, and the freezing Ice Elementals, the sheer scope of the\
  \ various energies at play can be daunting, not to mention the sheer size of the\
  \ largest ones. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150613-GW-5_working_elemental_2.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <p>The first appearance of these creatures in the game happened near my\
  \ in-game home, Pathfinder University, and it took the combined might of many different\
  \ settlements sending their best adventurers to turn back the tide and defeat the\
  \ elementals. Part of the fight was done live from <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/conventions/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon</a>, as experienced veterans and new players alike allied to fight the\
  \ elementals off. </p> \n    <h2>The Face of Evil</h2> \n    <p>One of the things\
  \ we unveiled at <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/conventions/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>\
  \ was the fact that each month, there would be a server-wide event that would drop\
  \ unique loot and advance the storyline of the Echo Woods, challenging the players\
  \ to defend their homes. For the month of July, the server event is called The Wrath\
  \ of Nhur Athemon. Check out the video we made for the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/conventions/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon</a> banquet!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <iframe width=\"480\"\
  \ height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvEcquJFYkc\" frameborder=\"\
  0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n    </div> \n    <p>If you played the Emerald Spire\
  \ Superdungeon, you are well aware of Nhur Athemon, the renegade Azlanti who was\
  \ imprisoned below the Emerald Spire many hundreds of years ago by his Azlanti brethren.\
  \ Nhur Athemon is now a lich using his vast powers to spy upon the Echo Woods above\
  \ his dungeon prison. His anger at what is happening above is coming to a boil,\
  \ and it's going to take the combined might of the server to fend off Nhur Athemon\
  \ and his minions.</p> \n    <p>If you want to be part of this epic event, be sure\
  \ to get into the game and gear up right away! The Wrath of Nhur Athemon is a one\
  \ time event that will not be repeated!</p> \n    <h2>Player Character Profile:\
  \ Laurethoron</h2> \n    <p>I think one of the most interesting things about Pathfinder\
  \ Online is that it allows players to make their own stories, just as they do in\
  \ the RPG. So each week, I intend to showcase a different Pathfinder Online player\
  \ and that player's main character. And to start it all off, I'm going to do something\
  \ that everybody always does to me: I want to tell you about my character.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Laurethoron is a female elven fighter who has a smattering of cleric and\
  \ rogue skills to augment her fighting prowess. She wields a longbow and a greatsword.\
  \ In January, I started the game in the southeastern corner of the map in the Southern\
  \ Cragthorn mountains, centering my adventures around the Neutral Good settlement\
  \ of Brighthaven. For the first month or so, I battled goblins, ogres, bandits,\
  \ wolves and undead with the members of the Argent Crusade company, with occasional\
  \ forays against the much tougher Ustalav invaders and Mordant Spire elves. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>While my time with the folks of Brighthaven was awesome, I felt that\
  \ I needed to do something in game to encourage my fellow workers at both Goblinworks\
  \ and Paizo to play together, so I started a company called the Bloodstone Swords,\
  \ based on the mercenary group detailed on page 12 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8emo?Pathfinder-Chronicles-Faction-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Chronicles: Faction Guide</em></a>. We moved our base of operations\
  \ to the NPC town of Thornkeep and started building a crafting empire to outfit\
  \ all the new players being added to our company. Gathering resources and leveling\
  \ up my crafter characters took much of my time for the next few weeks as plans\
  \ were laid and implemented. At the end of that time, the Swords had swelled to\
  \ 26 characters and we were ready to start adventuring. To date, we have mostly\
  \ tackled lower-level adventures as everyone got used to working together, though\
  \ recently an enclave of Mordant Spire elves was spotted in the hills to the north\
  \ of our home; we have been battling them, though the cost has been high in deaths.\
  \ Fortunately, Pharasma, Golarion's goddess of death, has taken a special interest\
  \ in this region, and death is just a temporary setback.</p> \n    <p>About a month\
  \ ago, it was time to move again. NPC settlements are great for getting started,\
  \ but the only way to gain advanced training for your characters is to become part\
  \ of a player-run settlement. After looking around the game, we settled on Pathfinder\
  \ University, a settlement run by a group of players who are dedicating their gameplay\
  \ to helping new players learn the game and get situated with equipment and training.\
  \ I liked their mission, so we dedicated the Swords to helping them out, and moved\
  \ from Thornkeep to University Commons. We are now safely ensconced in our new home\
  \ and have made a bunch of new friends including Pathfinder U's Faculty and many\
  \ of the recruits that the University helps out.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150613-GW-3_laurethoron_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <em>Laurethoron stands outside the Bloodstone Swords' Library Holding</em>\
  \ \n    </div> \n    <p>As community members, we have taken on the responsibility\
  \ to build and maintain a few holdings and outposts in the hexes surrounding University\
  \ Commons. To the south, we built a Library, supported by a lumber camp and a hunting\
  \ camp. To the southwest, we built a Sanctum, again with the support of lumber and\
  \ hunting outposts. To build these structures, we had to gather raw resources; refine\
  \ them into items such as iron nuggets and hemp rope; beat down a few of the escalations\
  \ that plague the land, giving us victory markers that allow us to claim the territory\
  \ we want to build on; then bring everything together to make the buildings. It\
  \ was a tall task that took the skills of numerous Swords to pull off, but now we\
  \ are the proud owners of two hexes that will support University Commons.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The Bloodstone Swords have also started a little business making nicer gear\
  \ for beginning characters and providing them with spells and recipes that allow\
  \ them to craft their own items. Our crafting queues have been pretty full making\
  \ goods to put into the Auction House and our gatherers keep us stocked with raw\
  \ materials.</p> \n    <p>In the next months, we will continue to support Pathfinder\
  \ University, but we also have a new goal. A few weeks ago, I invited all of the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Venture Officers</a> to join\
  \ the game, and they've been flooding in from all parts of the world. Right now\
  \ they are getting their feet under them in the game, but I don't doubt that there\
  \ will be quests and goals aplenty for this group as they spread their wings in\
  \ the game, and the Bloodstone Swords will be there to lend a hand.</p> \n    <p>Lisa\
