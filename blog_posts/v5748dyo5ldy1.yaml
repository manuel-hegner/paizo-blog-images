  ></span></a> \n    <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Proper Villains</h1> \n    <p>by Erik\
  \ Scott de Bie</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: The Liar</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n     <p>\"You owe <i>how</i> much?\" asked Tarrant the Liespinner.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"My boy, my boy—don't fret.\" Fat Gorm's cheeks reddened like two overripe\
  \ apples. \"It's not so bad.\"</p> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Tarrant\
  \ cast his gaze around the Open Palm to check for eavesdroppers. Fat Gorm's tavern\
  \ bore a fitting name, considering how often the dwarf asked his supposed friends\
  \ for coin. Tarrant Akayn the Liespinner had been out of prison for all of two hours,\
  \ and already the dwarf was hitting him up—and for a major take.</span></p> \n \
  \    <p>Tarrant cleared his throat. \"I know Taldane isn't your mother tongue, but\
  \ when you say ‘not so bad,' what you really mean is ‘cataclysmic,' yes?\" </p>\
  \ \n     <p>The dwarf shrugged. \"'Tis a sum I can hardly pay myself, true—not without\
  \ selling myself into slavery.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And we can't have that, can we?\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"Do these hands look suited to manual labor?\" Gorm clutched his\
  \ chest. \"Nay, far better for you to do this little task for me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Little task, you say,\" Tarrant said. \"Rob the Blackscales blind?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Stealing enough treasure to buy a small island out from under the Blackscale\
  \ Blades—a rather disreputable mercenary party—didn't sound \"little.\" Just days\
  \ before, another adventuring company on a hunt for ancient relics had hit some\
  \ haunted ruin in the mountains that unexpectedly housed a dragon. Apparently, there\
  \ had been a disagreement with their patron, who had furnished the expedition with\
  \ equipment and supplies. Specifically, he broke his contract and hired the Blades\
  \ to claim all the treasure. One of the double-crossed adventurers was apparently\
  \ an old friend to Gorm, and he'd tipped the dwarf off that even a fraction of the\
  \ hoard would be more than enough to cover his debts. It was insane, of course,\
  \ but lunatic risks were Tarrant's specialty and abiding passion. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  Coin's waiting—that and who knows what fabulous treasure?\" The dwarf grinned ingratiatingly.\
  \ \"And think of your cut. You have debts of your own to pay off, I think.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Strike where I'm weak, eh?\" Tarrant asked. \"You must really be desperate.\
  \ Who owns your debt, Fat Gorm? What aren't you telling me?\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's\
  \ Lord Doreset. He's the one financed the delve, and he owns my debt.\" The dwarf\
  \ bit his lip. \"Now, before you get upset—\"</p> \n     <p>Tarrant sighed. \"Of\
  \ course. Because fate just loves me.\"</p> \n     <p>Emilano Doreset, a nobleman\
  \ from Cheliax who'd relocated to Absalom some years ago, had never forgiven Tarrant\
  \ for certain liberties he'd taken with the Doreset name, the Doreset holdings,\
  \ and the Lady Doreset. He'd managed to get Tarrant thrown in prison for a year,\
  \ but he could prove little. Doreset couldn't very well reveal the full extent of\
  \ the Liespinner's crimes, when almost all the stolen coin came from Doreset's less-than-legal\
  \ interests in the city. An unresolved grudge hung between them like a duelist's\
  \ blade.</p> \n     <p>It stood to reason Doreset would squeeze one of the Liespinner's\
  \ friends for revenge. Was this all a trap? If so, that only made the task more\
  \ appealing.</p> \n     <p>His heart raced just thinking of it. The danger—the audacity!\
  \ And above all, the <i>challenge</i>. It drew Tarrant like a rallying cry. How\
  \ could he claim to be Golarion's greatest con artist if he backed away from such\
  \ a game? </p> \n     <p>The front door stirred a bell on a chain, ringing in two\
  \ men built like guard towers. They moved with the grace of practiced killers. Debt\
  \ collectors? No—worse. Beneath their dusty robes, the newcomers wore black-forged\
  \ steel studded with wicked barbs and fiendish motifs. </p> \n     <p>Hellknights.\
  \ What were Hellknights doing all the way out here in Absalom?</p> \n     <p>First\
  \ the Blackscale Blades, then Lord Doreset, and now <i>Hellknights</i>.</p> \n \
  \    <p>This was definitely a trap.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-LieSpinner.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-LieSpinner_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br> Tarrant attracts trouble wherever he goes.\n   \
  \  </div> \n     <p>The entrance of the Hellknights sparked an exodus from the Open\
  \ Palm. The elite lawkeepers of Cheliax were a rare sight in the city, but even\
  \ to the unenlightened, their harsh intentions came clear. After a moment, only\
  \ a few patrons remained, too nervous or drunk to do more than watch. They would\
  \ be enough to bear witness.</p> \n     <p>\"Better make yourself scarce, Gorm.\"\
  \ Tarrant nodded to the thugs.</p> \n     <p>The dwarf scowled. \"My thanks—you\
  \ need anything from the cellar?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Anything from Qadira, by any\
  \ chance? I do love the fruit of the desert.\"</p> \n     <p>\"If you've got the\
  \ coin.\" Tarrant frowned, and Gorm spread his hands. \"What? I'm short.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Tarrant clicked his tongue, dismissing the dwarf, then hummed a low tone\
  \ to focus himself. His mother had raised him among minstrels, and he had spent\
  \ every night of his youth with lullabies from far-distant lands. She had sung a\
  \ certain melody that would put a grown man to sleep, let alone a boy. He let that\
  \ song flow from his lips, and golden magic took shape around his dusky fingers.\
  \ Anyone could hear his music, but only he could see it.</p> \n     <p>When he turned\
  \ to cast the spell however, he saw that the Hellknights had paused, turning their\
  \ attention elsewhere.</p> \n     <p>An elf woman in leaf-patterned green hunting\
  \ leathers sat at the center table, ignoring the knights who flanked her. Tarrant\
  \ hadn't seen her arrive, which in itself made her remarkable. Her fine elven features—\
  radiant skin framed by rich brown hair—made her even more so. Pupilless eyes like\
  \ emeralds met Tarrant's own.</p> \n     <p>One of the knights leaned in close.\
  \ \"Your pardon, m'lady, but the menfolk here aren't worth your time. Why not try\
  \ a real warrior?\"</p> \n     <p>All eyes were on the elf and the knights now.\
  \ Tarrant had never known the famously disciplined Hellknights to be distracted\
  \ by something as trivial as beauty; but then, the elf was so beautiful that Tarrant\
  \ himself found it difficult to look away. It was more than her appearance, though—\
  there was something dark and powerful about her. She spoke to him on a deep, resonant\
  \ level, like she was a lonely strain of music he couldn't quite grasp. Perhaps\
  \ the knights were drawn to her for the same reason?</p> \n     <p>Tarrant managed\
  \ to look away from her face long enough to note the elaborate golden bracers that\
  \ extended the length of her forearms, each imbedded with a gemstone on the back\
  \ of the hand. Her left-hand bracer boasted a pure white pearl, while the right\
  \ hand—the one close to her bow—bore a bright red ruby.</p> \n     <p>\"What, don't\
  \ you speak Taldane?\" The amorous knight reached for her shoulder.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ elf ignored him, but the gems on her bracers flickered with awakening magic.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This was about to go bad and bloody.</p> \n     <p>Tarrant sang three\
  \ notes of his mother's song, loud enough that the first man looked up, startled\
  \ at the sound. The magic in the music flowed from his lips, a golden ribbon of\
  \ silk that wrapped around the knight. Tarrant kept singing as he slid off the stool\
  \ and strode toward the confrontation. He drew his rapier as he went.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"What—\" The Hellknight sank to his knees and then to the floor, sound asleep.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The other knight reeled, fighting his way free of the invisible\
  \ ribbon of music. Even as the man drew his sword and turned to face the unexpected\
  \ threat, Tarrant changed key and sang a warsong of the Mwangi Expanse, punctuating\
  \ the words with resonant notes that exploded like starbursts in the Hellknight's\
  \ face. This magic the knight needed no blessing to see, and the lights made him\
  \ stagger, confused, long enough for Tarrant to skip over his sleeping partner.\
  \ The knight parried Tarrant's feint, opening himself for a swift application of\
  \ sword pommel to unhelmeted temple. The knight's eyes rolled up, and he sagged\
  \ to the floor. </p> \n     <p>\"And here I had worried.\" It seemed to Tarrant\
  \ that they had put up surprisingly little fight for Hellknights—but then, he had\
  \ struck from surprise, while they were captivated by the elf. He would have to\
  \ remember that gift of hers.</p> \n     <p>Tarrant turned to bow to the woman who\
  \ had made his job easier. \"My thanks, lady, for letting me borrow your charms.\"\
  \ He turned to go.</p> \n     <p>\"Hold,\" she said.</p> \n     <p>Tarrant drew\
  \ up short and turned back to her. \"Tarrant Akayn the Liespinner at your disposal,\
  \ lady.\" He trod back over the sleeping hellknight and bowed again. \"What is your\
  \ desire, beautiful one?\" </p> \n     <p>The elf frowned. \"You have done me a\
  \ service tonight, human. Your kinfolk proved tiresome.\" Her words were music—\
  to him, she spoke in summer rain.</p> \n     <p>\"Ah, but these are no kin of mine.\
  \ They neglect their own hygiene <i>far</i> too much.\" </p> \n     <p>He wondered,\
  \ though. Most looked no farther than his dark skin—the touch of the exotic that\
  \ spoke of a Mwangi father. But perhaps the elf's keen eyes saw his Chelish mother\
  \ as well, who had taught him a love of music and cursed him with wanderlust.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Tarrant reached for the elf's hand, though she drew it back before he\
  \ could kiss it. \"You have an untrustworthy face,\" she said, adjusting her collar.\
  \ She seemed particularly keen to preserve modesty. \"Keep your distance.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Prickly as well as beautiful. He was in love already.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Has the service I've done you this eve—rescuing those poor blighters from your graceful\
  \ wrath—earned me the favor of your name?\" He gave her his best smile. \"I merely\
  \ wish to tell the story accurately when I recount the tale of the most beautiful\
  \ creature I've ever driven away with my rude manners.\" </p> \n     <p>Her eyes\
  \ pierced him. Finally, she nodded slightly. \"Among men, I am known as Ephere.\
  \ The tongues of lesser races find the names of elves difficult.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  My tongue is up for any challenge, my lady. Yours especially. But stay a bit—\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Something hit him hard, making him drop his sword and stagger into\
  \ her. They both fell to the floor, Tarrant atop Ephere, his hands in an impolite\
  \ position. \"Terribly sorry,\" he said.</p> \n     <p>Ephere hissed a curse that\
  \ still sounded lovely in Elven and pushed him off. Strong hands dragged him away\
  \ and pulled him up to face the Hellknight he'd clubbed. </p> \n     <p>\"Tarrant\
  \ Akayn.\" Steel scraped against leather as the knight drew out a heavy mace. \"\
  Down arms and submit to the law.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Already half there.\" Tarrant\
  \ indicated his fallen rapier. \"About the ‘submit' bit, though—\"</p> \n     <p>Ephere\
  \ slammed a fist coursing with lightning into the knight's side. Shock ran through\
  \ Tarrant as well, blowing the two of them apart. He tumbled gracelessly across\
  \ a table while the Hellknight twitched and coughed his way to his knees. Ephere\
  \ raised her other hand—this one wreathed in flame—to the knight's face. The man\
  \ froze and stared into his imminent death.</p> \n     <p>\"Wait,\" Tarrant managed,\
  \ trying and failing to right himself. The shock stole his body's natural grace.\
  \ \"Fas-fascinating.\" </p> \n     <p>Ephere regarded him with curiosity as he staggered\
  \ and levered himself up clumsily.</p> \n     <p>\"You are a curious creature.\"\
  \ Ephere's face held no pity of any kind. The elf turned her hand in front of the\
  \ Hellknight's face, and the man winced despite his iron discipline. \"You seek\
  \ to stop me from killing this man?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh no—by all means, put yon\
  \ fist through his face. That is, if you want half the Hellknights in Cheliax to\
  \ board the next boat to Absalom looking for your blood.\" Tarrant finally managed\
  \ to stop twitching. \"Excellent plan.\" </p> \n     <p>She considered a moment,\
  \ then pulled her fire gauntlet away. Instead, she touched her lightning gauntlet\
  \ to the Hellknight's temple. The magic shocked him to the floor, unconscious.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Useful,\" Tarrant noted.</p> \n     <p>The two of them stood staring\
  \ at one another. Tarrant made sure everyone in the tavern saw them together, including\
  \ the Hellknights. Then he took a wood disc the size of a coin from his pocket and\
  \ tossed it to Ephere. She caught it deftly.</p> \n     <p>\"Well, it's been a delight,\
  \ lady, but now is when we part ways. Have a care with those weapons: the unwashed\
  \ masses of Absalom might not appreciate their potency, but I think we both know\
  \ how valuable and dangerous they are.\" He leaned in close. \"And take care with\
  \ the gauntlets, too.\"</p> \n     <p>Mouth open in shock, Ephere stared at him\
  \ as he waved a salute, then left the Open Palm. As soon as he hit the doors, he\
  \ chanted a song of lovers meeting by moonlight. The music flowed in the form of\
  \ silvery wings around him, and he faded from sight, invisible.</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ made his way around the back of the Palm, where he found Fat Gorm's considerable\
  \ bulk wedged through one of the windows. Gorm yelped when Tarrant—still invisible—\
  grasped his wrists and hauled him out into the street, where he lay panting. The\
  \ effort broke the spell, and Tarrant reappeared, standing over the out-of-breath\
  \ barkeep.</p> \n     <p>\"Friends among the Hellknights, Gorm?\" he asked.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Collectors,\" said the dwarf. \"They work for Lord Doreset, don't\
  \ ask me why. I didn't expect it would be this dangerous. I can get the coin another\
  \ way.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ease your waggling tongue—of course I'll take the job.\"\
  \ That had never been in doubt—if anything, the skirmish with the Hellknights made\
  \ Tarrant more excited to do it. \"Consider it a favor to Lord Doreset—his being\
  \ a nose that looks best tweaked.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You have accounts to settle\
  \ with Doreset,\" Gorm said. \"That's good.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, yes I do.\" </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Prison had served as an excellent refuge for a full year, excepting\
  \ the bars and chains. And while he'd known a Chelish agent would spot him sooner\
  \ or later once he left prison, he hadn't expected Hellknights to arrive on his\
  \ trail so soon. It seemed too fine a coincidence, as though the enemies he'd left\
  \ in his homeland had been waiting for him. Definitely a trap. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  What of that elf?\" Gorm asked. \"Is she with you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"A beautiful\
  \ stranger,\" Tarrant said. \"I almost regret using her as bait to throw the Hellknights\
  \ off my trail.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're a villain, Liespinner,\" Gorm said.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Indeed,' Tarrant agreed. \"And I'll need a team of the same. The Blackscale\
  \ Blades aren't going to rob themselves.\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Altara the Hound tapped her barbed fingers on the thick darkwood arm\
  \ of her chair. She liked sitting as little as she liked waiting. She was a woman\
  \ of action, whose record in tracking down fugitives had earned her the nickname\
  \ a dozen times over. \"You failed.\" </p> \n     <p>Her men didn't shift from their\
  \ stiff-backed parade rest. \"We searched the Palm, but the dwarf was nowhere to\
  \ be found.\" </p> \n     <p>She slammed her gauntleted fist down. \"To the hells\
  \ with the dwarf! Akayn is the real target.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Tell me of this elf,\"\
  \ said the noble fop seated across from her, speaking between bites of his second\
  \ dinner. Corpulent Lord Doreset was always eating. \"You say she was beautiful?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Unnaturally so,\" said one of the knights. \"She may have been\
  \ using some form of magic. She was... compelling.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And the Liespinner\
  \ seemed to know her?\" Altara demanded.</p> \n     <p>The knight with the livid\
  \ purple bruise on the side of his head nodded sharply. \"He tried to make it look\
  \ like he knew her, but I don't think he does. It might be a false trail.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Tarrant Akayn has always been a fool for a pretty face. It will be\
  \ his undoing.\" Altara stood. \"Go.\"</p> \n     <p>Her men dutifully marched away.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Patience, Altara.\" Doreset stuffed a fresh pastry in his mouth. \"\
  You'll have the Liespinner soon enough, and I'll have my coin back. There's no point\
  \ in terrorizing the help.\"</p> \n     <p>Altara glared at him, then marched out\
  \ of the room and back to her guest chambers. She shoved her borrowed desk over\
  \ in a cascade of papers: reports, sketches, descriptions, all of the same man.\
  \ She caught one—a rendering of his face, with its familiar cocky smile, and tore\
  \ it in half with her barbed fingers.</p> \n     <p>\"Tarrant Akayn,\" she murmured.\
  \ \"There will be a reckoning between us.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
