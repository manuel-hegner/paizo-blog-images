  description\">We move from our last international blog in South Africa to a location\
  \ in the extreme north: Finland. I knew that Finland had a very strong playerbase\
  \ in Pathfinder Society during its first few years, but for whatever reason, interest\
  \ had waned. Back in May, I wanted to bring back the Finnish fanbase because I knew\
  \ they could only add to the Pathfinder Society experience and make it better. After\
  \ a series of emails answering concerns, Jukka Särkijärvi agreed to come on board\
  \ as a Venture-Captain and help revitalize Pathfinder Society in Finland. After\
  \ six months, I can say that he and his Venture-Lieutenant, Jussi Leinonen, have\
  \ done an excellent job and I am excited to see Pathfinder Society once again a\
  \ highlight of gaming in Finland.</span></p> \n     <p>Without further ado, I present\
  \ to you Jukka and Jussi's report on Pathfinder Society in Finland.</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>We had Pathfinder Society in Finland at the very beginning. The campaign's\
  \ registration in 2008 actually began during Ropecon, our largest annual gaming\
  \ convention (roughly 3,500 attendees), where Sampo Haarlaa and I had a presentation\
  \ about organized play campaigns, which we had already written for, played, and\
  \ organized for years. Ropecon 2008 was slightly too early for there to be Pathfinder\
  \ Society at the convention, so the first actual session—Murder on the Silken Caravan—\
  wasn't run until two weeks later. Jukka Särkijärvi, later to become Venture-Captain,\
  \ ran that one. He didn't get to play his first session until some three weeks later,\
  \ and after an unlucky critical hit, became the first Finnish Society player who\
  \ needed to register a second character.</p> \n      <p>Jukka eventually became\
  \ the first player to lose two characters, and after a series of unfortunate and\
  \ inexplicable TPKs, shortly after he was appointed Venture-Captain, he lost the\
  \ distinction of owning the most dead PCs. The most dead PCs at tables he ran, on\
  \ the other hand...</p> \n      <p>Pathfinder Society started slowly over here.\
  \ There were maybe 25 somewhat active players spread out between the Helsinki metropolitan\
  \ area and we played through new scenarios as they came out. We were usually soon\
  \ left hankering for more until we got our next fix. People eventually gravitated\
  \ toward running Adventure Paths for fixed groups or to different games altogether.\
  \ After the flowering of Season 0, for two years we had very little Pathfinder Society\
  \ in Finland outside of Ropecon.</p> \n      <p>In 2011, Ropecon asked if Erik Mona\
  \ might be interested in coming over as a guest of honor. He said \"yes,\" and the\
  \ rest is history. It gave the community new energy to run and play, and we had\
  \ the untouched expanse of two years of modules at our disposal, with no danger\
  \ of running out. Old players came back and new ones were recruited. In the end,\
  \ Ropecon 2011 featured a very modest seven sessions of Pathfinder Society (out\
  \ of a total of 165 sessions of roleplaying games), but we had Erik there, which\
  \ kindled the enthusiasm of the wider player base, and it continued long after he\
  \ had left the country.</p> \n      <p>In the Helsinki area, much of the resurgence\
  \ in Society play happened through the involvement of the RPG actives of the local\
  \ engineering university. There, it quickly became apparent that the organized play\
  \ model, where Game Masters and fellow party members change from one session to\
  \ another, was ideally suited for busy students whose unpredictable schedules made\
  \ it difficult to commit to campaigns with a regular group. During Season 3, more\
  \ sessions of Pathfinder Society were run in Finland than during the previous three\
  \ seasons combined. Ropecon 2012 saw 20 tables of Pathfinder Society, including\
  \ the Blood Under Absalom special. We could probably have accommodated a few more\
  \ tables, but three of our five most active Pathfinder Society Game Masters, including\
  \ Venture-Captain Jukka Särkijärvi and Helsinki Venture-Lieutenant Jussi Leinonen,\
  \ were members of the organizing committee and busy with other duties during the\
  \ convention.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20121126-Photo1.jpg\"\

  \ Ropecon is the primary gaming convention in Finland, held every summer in Espoo,\
  \ next to the capital city of Helsinki. The second most important is Tracon, which\
  \ used to bounce around the calendar from winter to spring until finally settling\
  \ in the early autumn where it now resides. It is primarily an anime convention\
  \ (the anime fans are enthusiastic and numerous and we're still trying to figure\
  \ out how to get them interested in roleplaying games), but thanks to the organizers'\
  \ varied interests, there are also some roleplaying games scheduled. At this year's\
  \ Tracon, we had seven tables of Pathfinder Society (out of some 20 sessions altogether)\
  \ and again, there was demand for more, but the convention ran out of room for tabletop\
  \ games. We foresee significant growth for both Pathfinder Society and roleplaying\
  \ games in general for next year's Tracon, and are working closely with their organizing\
  \ committee to give these offerings a greater prominence at the convention.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>There are also smaller conventions in the country, such as Conklaavi\
  \ in Turku and the biannual Maracon in Oulu. Bringing Pathfinder Society to these\
  \ conventions and trying to start up self-sustaining player communities and eventually\
  \ appoint Venture-Lieutenants for these cities is also on the agenda.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>At the moment, outside of the convention season, Pathfinder Society in Finland\
  \ is centered around the university gaming clubs in Helsinki, Espoo and Tampere.\
  \ Autumn is an especially fruitful time for introducing new players to the campaign,\
  \ with the influx of new students.</p> \n      <p>Unlike America, Finland has never\
  \ really had a culture of playing RPGs in games stores, but we are currently working\
  \ to change that with regular games scheduled at the Puolenkuun Pelit store in Tampere.\
  \ At the time of writing, however, the campaign in Finland is strongly focused on\
  \ running a single session at a time, with the occasional convention and club game\
  \ day with more activity. We also currently don't have regular weekly game evenings,\
  \ and each session is coordinated individually at our community wiki and <a href=\"\
  http://pelilauta.fi/index.php/board,9.0.html\" target=\"_blank\">messageboard</a>.\
  \ Although this approach requires some more initiative on behalf of the gamers,\
  \ it also adds flexibility as nobody is excluded from Society gaming just because\
  \ he or she happens to have the regular day of the week booked for something else.\
  \ With the prominence of current and former university students in the player base,\
  \ we have been able to use the campus clubrooms for additional public gaming space.\
  \ These have been important especially for introducing new players, whom the regulars\
  \ are understandably hesitant to invite to home games. Running games in a public\
  \ area also brings visibility to Pathfinder Society through the curiosity of other\
  \ gamers hanging around.</p> \n      <p>The number of active players in Finland\
  \ stands at an approximate 60, though the amount of active Game Masters is not quite\
  \ large enough to meet the demand. We are working on changing this, too, and it\
  \ is a happy thing to see players enthusiastically taking up the GM screen. Here\
  \ as well, the organized play model of Pathfinder Society has proven to be advantageous:\
  \ prospective Game Masters can give GMing a try without committing themselves to\
  \ providing a long-running campaign, and nobody is worse off if the new GM decides\
  \ that it's not for her, or something she prefers to do only once every few months.\
  \ This has encouraged many new people to run games who might have otherwise been\
  \ unlikely to do so, despite the fact that GMing in an organized play campaign might\
  \ be considered to require a higher standard of quality than a \"casual\" game.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Due to our northerly location beyond the Baltic Sea, the Finnish gaming\
  \ scene is relatively isolated even from the rest of Europe, not to mention North\
  \ America. That said, the great majority of gamers around here are happy to play\
  \ a session in English (after all, that's the language we read our rulebooks in),\
  \ and many fluent GMs can also be found. </p> \n      <p>If you find yourself in\
  \ Finland in need of a Society game, email us at <a href=\"mailto:pfshelsinki@gmail.com\"\
  >pfshelsinki@gmail.com</a> (Helsinki metropolitan area) or <a href=\"mailto:pfsfinland@gmail.com\"\
  >pfsfinland@gmail.com</a> (the rest of the country). For the more serious gaming\
  \ tourist, Ropecon (to be held July 26–28, 2013) is an increasingly international\
  \ convention with some 3,500 visitors annually, with Pathfinder Society and much\
  \ more.</p> \n      <table>\n       <tbody>\n        <tr>\n         <td style=\"\
