  \ organizations to showcase in the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens Character Guide</a>, we asked ourselves who the most iconic figures\
  \ in our setting were—or <i>should</i> be. Case in point: the Magaambya. Founded\
  \ by the legendary Old Mage Jatembe, credited with bringing back magic as the Inner\
  \ Sea region knows it after the destruction of Earthfall, the Magaambya is the oldest\
  \ magic school in the Inner Sea and possibly on Golarion. The parallel in prestige\
  \ to real world institutions like Oxford and Cambridge, the Magaambya surely stood\
  \ as one of the premier organizations in the Age of Lost Omens campaign setting.</p>\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Except, like many things in the Mwangi Expanse, that was\
  \ truer in theory than in reality. While factions such as the Pathfinder Society\
  \ would travel into Garund quite often, it seemed that the Magaambya was skimping\
  \ on its travel budget, and members of the arcane college weren’t often seen in\
  \ official Paizo products. One of our goals in the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i>\
  \ was to firmly define the current presence and goals of the Magaambya. In addition\
  \ to their heavy presence in the Mwangi Expanse, the Magaambya has begun setting\
  \ up satellite colleges to the north—after the explosion (many times literal) of\
  \ arcane events and anomalies that have occurred in Avistan, from the closure of\
  \ the Worldwound to the appearance of New Thassilon to the destruction caused by\
  \ the Whispering Tyrant, the scholars of the south have decided it’s about time\
  \ they go see what on earth is happening up there!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     <p>Joining the Magaambya is simply a matter of finding a teacher to sponsor\
  \ you into the school, but you don’t count as a full-fledged member just from the\
  \ get-go. Initiates first have to complete a Perquisite: a period of public service.\
  \ Unlike the teachings of Nethys, the Magaambya doesn’t believe that magic is worth\
  \ studying just for the sake of being magic. It’s what the magician intends to do\
  \ with their power that’s important, and the Magaambya believes that those who can\
  \ cast magic should use it to aid other people. The Perquisite is thus a means to\
  \ earn the right to study at the Magaambya, but also the Magaambya’s most important\
  \ lesson. Public service and a willing sponsor are still much easier entrance requirements\
  \ than other prestigious colleges, who can often discriminate on the grounds of\
  \ class, ancestry, or wealth. The Magaambya has a startling array of peoples among\
  \ its students, including many ancestries that have unsavory reputations in other\
  \ places: anadi, catfolk, gnolls, and iruxi can be found openly studying on the\
  \ grounds, and even prospectives from Usaro, Mzali, or the Sargavan people—as many\
  \ Mwangi call the colonists who recently ruled Vidrian—can find a warm welcome,\
  \ if their intentions are good.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ <p>The Magaambya is founded in the teachings of Old Mage Jatembe—most critically,\
  \ that all magic is magic, regardless of the source. Distinctions such as divine,\
  \ primal, arcane, and occult are all simply distractions from this truth. Of course,\
  \ this distinction is easier said than practiced, as the Magaambya well knows. The\
  \ Magaambya’s signature spellcasting is known as “halcyon magic,” a tradition that\
  \ combines both arcane and primal magic when casting spells (seen in action in this\
  \ recent <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwq?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-When-it-Rains\"\
  >piece of fiction</a> by Tim Pratt and described in the <i>Lost Omens Character\
  \ Guide</i>). Characters who take the halcyon speaker archetype represent those\
  \ mages who have mastered halcyon magic and, at higher levels, can even learn to\
  \ cast multiple halcyon spells at once.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  Halcyon Spells. Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting.\
  \ Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don’t gain\
  \ new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead,\
  \ you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through\
  \ feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your\
  \ class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their\
  \ spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell\
  \ list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting\
  \ class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes. Each time you cast a halcyon\
  \ spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can’t heighten a halcyon\
  \ spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level\
  \ spell slots, and you can’t select a halcyon spell as a signature spell. Each time\
  \ you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat,\
  \ you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell\
  \ of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as\
  \ via a sorcerer’s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon\
  \ spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out\
  \ a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.\"></a> \n  \

  the student wishes to pursue. Magaambyan attendants have five branches to choose\
  \ from, representing their commitment to one of the school’s five specialized faculties.\
  \ Pursuing work within that branch offers on-the-job training that can grant a student\
  \ unique abilities. A Cascade Bearer, who focuses on advancing magical theory, can\
  \ use her extensive studies to warp her magic on the fly, such as extending great\
  \ effort to apply a minor metamagic she has not mastered to a spell. Tempest-Sun\
  \ Mages, who exist to protect the Magaambya and its allies, can channel some of\
  \ their offensive magic into a magical barrier to defend themselves. Characters\

  \ alt=\"Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Feat 2. Uncommon, Archetype, Dedication.\
  \ Prerequisites: trained in Arcana or Nature, member of the Magaambya of attendant\
  \ rank. You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain the ability to\
  \ cast a single arcane or primal cantrip of your choice, (as is normal for cantrips,\
  \ it is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level, rounded up). If you\
  \ weren’t already, you become trained in that tradition’s spell DCs and spell attack\
  \ rolls, with Intelligence as your spellcasting ability if you choose arcane or\
  \ Wisdom as your spellcasting ability if you choose primal. Regardless of whether\
  \ you choose an arcane or primal cantrip, you also either become trained in Arcana\
  \ or Nature, or an expert in one of those skills in which you were already trained.\
  \ When you gain this feat, choose to affiliate with the Cascade Bearers, Emerald\
  \ Boughs, Rain–Scribes, Tempest-Sun Mages, or Uzunjati. This grants you additional\
  \ feats available to only that branch. Special: You cannot select another dedication\
  \ feat other than Halcyon Speaker Dedication until you have gained two other feats\

  \ for the Attendant’s magic, as well as a connection between the Attendant’s body\

  \ alt=\"Mask Familiar, Feat 4. Archetype. Prerequisites: Magaambyan Attendant Dedication.\
  \ Your mask takes on a personality of its own, allowing it to serve as your familiar.\
  \ Though you can still wear it as a mask, you can detach it from your face to grant\
  \ it a bodily form of colored light that allows it to move around; usually, this\
  \ is a miniature form of the animal the mask represents. Detaching or reattaching\
  \ the familiar to transform it is a two-action activity. Even in mask form, the\
  \ familiar can move around on its master’s face and speaks in a distinct voice (if\
  \ it can talk). It is easily recognized as more than a simple mask unless the familiar\
  \ succeeds at a Deception check to Impersonate a mask. Other than its appearance\
  \ and the fact that it can be worn, it functions as other familiars. Your mask familiar\
