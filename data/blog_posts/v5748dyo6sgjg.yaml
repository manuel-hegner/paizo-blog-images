  \ \n      <p><i>Illustration by Matteo Spirito</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>Tomes older than half the nations of the Inner Sea haphazardly crammed\
  \ the shelves, or else leaned in stacks that had teetered on the brink of collapse\
  \ since the days of Aroden. Ezren closed his eyes and inhaled, taking in the bone-dry\
  \ bouquet of ancient pages slowly losing their battle with entropy, the scholarly\
  \ tang of acetic acid. Truly, there was nothing so marvelous as a library.</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"Getting a little hot out here, Ez!\"</p> \n      <p>Valeros's shout\
  \ cut through the perfect moment. Ezren opened his eyes in irritation, but it was\
  \ true—already the temperature in the vault was rising. Outside, the crackle of\
  \ flames rose alongside the hellhounds' baying, answered by the signature whoosh\
  \ of Seoni's magic. Always the same spells, sorcerers. After this long traveling\
  \ together, he could find her on a battlefield by sound alone.</p> \n      <p>He\
  \ sighed. A shame that such an ancient repository of knowledge would be ashes by\
  \ morning. But such was the fate of all things eventually.</p> \n      <p>Seating\
  \ himself cross-legged among the treatises of scholars long since turned to dust,\
  \ he pulled the puzzle box from his satchel. Runes glowed back at him mockingly.\
  \ They'd burned to life beneath his magically altered vision, but steadfastly refused\
  \ to reveal their meaning no matter which linguistic magics he'd attempted.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Very well, then—time to get creative. He applied Kazmiri's Cryptographic\
  \ Theorem, twisting the wheels in quick, precise turns. Lomal's Revealing Incantations\
  \ traced the box's edges in cerulean fire, yet failed to penetrate. Perhaps the\
  \ Inquiring Sigil, combined with the Lockbreaker's Progressions...</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Ezren!\" Valeros's voice rose, hitting the octave of a man at least partially on\
  \ fire.</p> \n      <p>No. None of the old standbys. That was the problem with classics—\
  if you knew them, so did everyone else.</p> \n      <p>That was what the arrogant\
  \ elitists of the Arcanamirium and the pampered dandies at the College of Mysteries\
  \ never understood. It didn't <i>matter</i> how many old spells you knew—wizardry\
  \ wasn't butterfly collecting. They could memorize as many spells as they wanted,\
  \ performing tricks for each other in their ivory towers, and still be no better\
  \ than a sorcerer, trading instinct for rote.</p> \n      <p>Learning spells was\
  \ supposed to be a springboard for one's own experimentation. Magic was an art <i>and</i>\
  \ a science—both creative pursuit and process of discovery. That was what Ezren's\
  \ studies on the road had taught him. In the real world, your magic had to be flexible.\
  \ You needed to be able to calibrate, to channel more magic into a spell, to stretch\
  \ or quicken it, to—</p> \n      <p><i>Adapt.</i></p> \n      <p>Of course! Ezren\
  \ abandoned all the incantations except Lomal's and tried again, inverting the third\
  \ and fifth gestures. This time, however, he infused it with a thrill of ice magic,\
  \ a tendril of frost that curled inside the words and crystallized. Suddenly the\
  \ magic sank inward, the box's inner workings revealed like a three-dimensional\
  \ schematic as the spell traced them in Ezren's penetrating sight. With the secrets\
  \ revealed, it was a simple matter to break the enchantment and align the runes\
  \ in the proper order, cracking the box open to reveal...</p> \n      <p>Treasure.\
  \ A glittering mass of gems, no doubt the ransom of some forgotten noble.</p> \n\
  \      <p>How disappointing. Ezren sagged backward, the box suddenly heavy in his\
  \ hands. After all his research, all the team's work to fight their way into these\
  \ final chambers, he'd really thought—</p> \n      <p>A voice boomed out from behind\
  \ him. <i>\"WHO SUMMONS ME?\"</i></p> \n      <p>Ezren froze. Slowly, he turned,\
  \ doing his best to hide a triumphant grin.</p> \n      <p>\"Greetings, Excellency.\"\
  \ He bowed, gesturing with the glowing box. \"This won't take long. Just a few questions...\"\
  </p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>If you liked this week's Iconic Encounter, you\
  \ won't want to miss next week's exciting entry. Until then, Pathfinders, study\
