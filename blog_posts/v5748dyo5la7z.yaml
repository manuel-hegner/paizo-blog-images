  Playtest Five</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 17, 2009</p> \n   <p>Woe\
  \ unto <i>three</i>.</p> \n   <p>Between us, the number three must have come up\
  \ at least a dozen times. Still, it's higher than 1, so I guess that means we're\
  \ getting better. Plus it was fun to watch Sean bang his head repeatedly against\
  \ the dry erase board after the tenth 3 popped up.</p> \n   <p>David forgot his\
  \ dice again, I think that's what did us in (not only did he forget his dice, but\
  \ when he first sat down he had forgotten his character and pencil, too!). Later\
  \ his rogue was hoodwinked into attacking Beaky, which kept us out of the fight\
  \ for several rounds (me because my druid was busy chasing after him, trying to\
  \ prevent him from killing my eagle).</p> \n   <p>I think the adventure is getting\
  \ close to wrapping up, though. Sean said that if it weren't for the astoundingly\
  \ poor rolls session after session, we surely would have been finished by now. He\
  \ left us at a cliffhanger: right as my character burst through a door (that's her\
  \ new gig, bursting through doors before the rest of the party is ready), he set\
  \ up the room and called it a night, with a newly revealed NPC calling out his chilling\
  \ promises of death and ruin; unless it was Sean saying it out of character to us,\
  \ I'm not quite sure...</p> \n   <p>Hank Woon <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n  </blockquote>\
