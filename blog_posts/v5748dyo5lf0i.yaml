  articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"><p>So those of you who've had a chance\
  \ to check out our newest adventure module, <i>The Dragon's Demand</i>, have doubtless\
  \ noticed changes to the module format. The biggest change is, of course, the expansion\
  \ in size from 32 pages to 64 pages, but there's other changes as well. Each module\
  \ will contain a two-sided poster map, for one—<i>The Dragon's Demand</i> features\
  \ a poster map of the town of Belhaim on one side and the town's amphitheater (mapped\
  \ out at minis scale) on the other. We'll be presenting more than one new monster\
  \ in each adventure, and each adventure will also come with a longer support article\
  \ for a region, location, organization, or the like (in <i>The Dragon's Demand</i>,\
  \ this is a four page overview of the town of Belhaim, including a huge chart of\
  \ what most of the buildings in town are for, who lives there, and how well they\
  \ interact with each other and with PCs).</p></span> \n    <p>But there's another\
  \ thing, and that's the one I'm here to introduce.</p> \n    <p>There are a lot\
  \ of quests your PCs can undertake in <i>The Dragon's Demand</i>—24 of them, in\
  \ fact. Each one of these quests grants experience points and, often, gold or magic\
  \ or other rewards for completing them. In order to help the GM track these quests,\
  \ we've summarized all 24 of them on page 3 of the adventure, including when the\
  \ PCs should gain the quest and what they need to do to finish the quest.</p> \n\
  \    <p>But what about the players, you ask?</p> \n    <p>That's where Pathfinder\
  \ Cards: The Dragon's Demand comes in! This deck of cards contains item cards of\
  \ key treasures you'll find in the adventure and face cards for all of the important\
  \ NPCs, but about half of the cards are a brand new type of card—quest cards!</p>\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>We're showing off three of these quest\
  \ cards here. When your party reaches a point at the adventure where an NPC sets\
  \ you on a quest, or where you discover something in the course of play that serves\
  \ as the start of a quest, the GM simply gives you a copy of the appropriate quest\
  \ card. There's blank space on the backside of each quest card for your group to\
  \ track notes, and when you finish the quest, you can even record the reward here.\
  \ With these quest cards, you won't have to worry about forgetting to follow up\
  \ on opportunities for more adventure!</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs<br> <i>Creative\
