Athrax’s greatest joy in life is the sound of his explosives detonating, and the ensuing cries of anguish from his mutilated victims. Since learning about the Pathfinder Society, he has made it his mission to become a member, and likes to ‘Explore, Report, and Cooperate’ by exploring new ways of creating explosions, reporting his horrific findings in his journal, and cooperating by following the orders of chief Yiddlepode.’
