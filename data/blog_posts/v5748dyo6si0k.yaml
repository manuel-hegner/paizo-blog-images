  description\">Last month, we announced Starfinder Society Year 5: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shz7?Starfinder-Society-Year-5-Announcement#25\"\
  >Year of Redemption’s Rise</a>. While that previous blog post offered tons of information\
  \ on the year itself, today we focus on a previously-established minor faction you\
  \ can expect to see step up in the Year of Redemption’s Rise: the Manifold Host!\
  \ For more information on our two new minor factions, the Advocates and the Cognates,\
  \ check out <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shzj?Starfinder-Society-Faction-Preview-The-Advocates\"\
  >Starfinder Society Faction Preview: The Advocates</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0a\"\
  >Starfinder Society Faction Preview: The Cognates</a>.</p> \n      <h2>Joining the\
  \ Manifold Host</h2> \n      <p>The Manifold Host is a minor faction established\
  \ in 2019 which required a specific boon to join. This boon was rather hard to come\
  \ by, which kept the reach of the Manifold Host small. Thanks to First Seeker Ehu\
  \ Hadif’s efforts to amplify the voices of those normally ignored or overlooked\
  \ within the Starfinder Society, the Manifold Host has seen an increase in enrollment.\
  \ Beginning in the Year of Redemption’s Rise, the Manifold Host is available to\
  \ all players. Any Starfinder Society character can represent the Manifold Host,\
  \ just as they would any other faction.</p> \n      <table class=\"image\" align=\"\

  \ </table> \n      <h2>The Manifold Host</h2> \n      <p>The Starfinder Society’\
  s reputation for multiculturalism is due in no small part to the Manifold Host,\
  \ who’ve long made it their mission to welcome all people, no matter their species\
  \ or origin, into the Society. Members of the Manifold Host champion strength in\
  \ diversity and the unique talents, interests, and outlooks of the Society’s agents.\
  \ Believing differences should be celebrated and embraced, the Manifold Host works\
  \ to recruit agents from all alien species into the Society.</p> \n      <p><b>Faction\
  \ Leader</b>: Harmony of Many (NG barathu mechanic). Harmony of Many is a collective\
  \ of six component barathus (all Starfinders) who merged into one being nearly fifty\
  \ years ago. Shortly after their merging, Harmony of Many took over leadership of\
  \ the Manifold Host faction. Very rarely, one of Harmony of Many’s barathu components\
  \ splits from the group, usually to meet off-station with an alien community, though\
  \ they reintegrate with Harmony of Many at the first opportunity. This traveling\
  \ diplomat is usually Lilting Song (NG barathu envoy), a linguist and historian\
  \ fluent in dozens of languages.</p> \n      <p><b>Motto</b>: We who welcome all.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Objectives</b>: Functioning as recruitment officers and an enthusiastic\
  \ welcoming committee, members of the Manifold Host are dedicated to inducting new\
  \ species into the Starfinder Society in the belief that each alien species can\
  \ contribute their own new and unique skills to the benefit of all. Additionally,\
  \ they welcome new agents of all kinds, and aid them in acclimating to the Society’\
  s operations.</p> \n      <p><b>Year 5 Goal</b>: The Manifold Host endeavors to\
  \ shield new agents from the recent upheaval and infighting within the Starfinder\
  \ Society, ensuring they feel welcome and safe, and are set up for success.</p>\

  \ </div> \n      <br> \n      <p><b>Boons</b>: Like all our factions, the Manifold\
  \ Host has a slate of boons available for purchase with Achievement Points by members\
  \ of the Manifold Host faction with the appropriate amount of Reputation. At present,\
  \ the Manifold Host has fewer boons than our other Starfinder Society factions.\
  \ With the launch of Year 5, additional boons will be added to the Manifold Host,\
  \ rounding out and completing their boon options. Today, we reveal one of these\
  \ new boons! Note that this boon is not yet final, and may change slightly before\
  \ release.</p> \n      <p><b>Linguistic Decoder (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> You have\
  \ friends from all over the galaxy and have been exposed to countless languages.\
  \ This linguistic exposure has made you adept at decoding messages. You reduce the\
  \ DC of Culture checks to decipher writing by 5.<br> <b>Other Notes</b>: 25+ Reputation\
  \ with Manifold Host<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> \n      <p>I hope you enjoyed this\
  \ sneak peek at the Manifold Host minor faction!</p> \n      <p>Take care, Starfinders!</p>\
