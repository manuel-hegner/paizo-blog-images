  \ ago that Michael Sayre was leaving the Organized Play team (check out his blog\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shd1?Changes\">here</a> and\
  \ my sendoff <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shd1?Changes#37\"\
  >here</a>). And as promised in that blog, we have a few changes to announce. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>First off, James Case is stepping into Mike’s position as the Pathfinder\
  \ Organized Play Developer. This means that he’ll be the lead on the Pathfinder\
  \ Society line, shaping the direction of the Pathfinder Society’s overarching plots\
  \ and schemes going forward. James is always brimming with new ideas, both for entertaining\
  \ stories and for ways to improve the way we do our jobs. It’s been a pleasure working\
  \ with James, and I’m looking forward to being part of what he comes up with next!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And of course, with someone leaving, it's time to bring in someone new\
  \ as well. I’m excited to welcome Jenny Jarzabski to the Organized Play team. You\
  \ all might already know Jenny for the numerous projects she’s written for Paizo,\
  \ including many top-notch scenarios for both Pathfinder Society and Starfinder\
  \ Society, or from her active presence in the community as a frequent convention\
  \ volunteer and 5-star GM. Thanks for joining us, Jenny!</p> \n     <br clear=\"\
  all\"> \n     <p>In all of the shuffle that’s been going on lately, Tonya reminded\
  \ me that I hadn’t announced my own title change from a few months back. Whoops!\
  \ I’m now officially the manager of the other organized play developers, and my\
  \ title changed to Organized Play Managing Developer.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\

  \ Developer</em></p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n\
  \     <p>Hi everyone, James here! As Linda said, I’ll be taking over the Pathfinder\
  \ Society (insert witch cackle here). One of the things I love most about organized\
  \ play is the feel of the living campaign—how the actions of all of the players\
  \ can affect the storylines and world—and how our digital-first products free us\
  \ to quickly move adventures from an idea to everyone’s game tables. I’m excited\
  \ to step into the role of sending the Society on new adventures to new places,\
  \ and I look forward to continuing to build out the world of Golarion with all of\
  \ you!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">James Case<br>\

  \ Rodriguez</p> \n     <p>Howdy! I’m Jenny Jarzabski, and I’m happy to announce\
  \ that I’m joining the Organized Play team! I’ve been a Paizo freelancer for the\
  \ past six years designing adventures, setting, and rules for Pathfinder and Starfinder.\
  \ Most recently, I authored The Devastation Ark: Waking the Worldseed and the Starfinder\
  \ Society Season 3 Interactive Special, The Last Bite. </p> \n     <p>Before I was\
  \ a freelancer, I was a volunteer. I played my first game of PFS in 2012 at the\
  \ Dallas-Fort Worth (Texas) Pathfinder Lodge. I played every slot I could sign up\
  \ for and soon stepped up to GM at local cons. PaizoCon 2013 was the real game changer\
  \ for me, though. I enjoyed it so much that I hopped on a plane and volunteered\
  \ for 8 GM slots at GenCon a month later. I’ve been a regular attendee of big conventions\
  \ ever since.</p> \n     <p>Considering my history with the Org Play program, I’\
  m thrilled to take my place as a Developer working on Starfinder Society alongside\
  \ my old pal Thursty. I know we’re going to make an excellent team, so you can expect\
  \ plenty of weird and wonderful space shenanigans coming your way!</p> <clear=\"\
  all\" /> \n     <p>When I’m not playing games, I’m probably outside. I love the\
  \ great outdoors—cycling, hiking, and rock climbing are some of my favorite activities.\
  \ I also dabble in cooking, fermentation, and home brewing, and my greatest quarantine\
  \ accomplishment was the perfection of a two-day sourdough baking ritual. You can\
  \ follow my real-life adventures on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenjski\"\
