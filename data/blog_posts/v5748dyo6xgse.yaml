  \        For the winter season, we’ll be traveling up north to Irrisen to speak\
  \ with Her Majesty, Queen Anastasia! The strange queen from another world has a\
  \ peculiar idea that she’s decided to try and introduce into her new home in order\
  \ to better connect all the citizens of Irrisen: a locomotive. Her current drawback\
  \ is that, well, no one in her kingdom, nor most of Avistan, seems to know anything\
  \ about trains or whatever a “combustion engine” may be and she certainly doesn’\
  t have the education to even begin explaining how the steam is made nor how the\
  \ train gains the ability to whistle so loudly when crossing bridges. But she does\
  \ know how to draw and how to call on others for their knowledge and assistance!\
  \ With the Pathfinder Society being one of the most traveled organizations in Golarion,\
  \ she asks for their assistance in judging the models that have been presented to\
  \ her from prospective engineers, though perhaps one of those engineers is less\
  \ interested in trains as they are in thrones…</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ tend to cause trouble, as some of you no doubt might recall, especially anyone\

  \ some elemental scamps, which are causing mischief and chaos throughout the enclave\
