  >Season of Ghosts Adventure Path</a> kicks off with your characters having started\
  \ to build their reputation in the town of Willowshore. Whether they’ll be known\
  \ as heroes or otherwise depends on how your group’s been playing, of course, but\
  \ regardless of that choice, everyone in Willowshore is increasingly aware of the\
  \ looming threat posed by the coming season. If the mysterious curse afflicting\
  \ the town can’t be lifted in time, it might be a difficult winter indeed, and preparations\
  \ to contend with a worst-case scenario must begin at once!</p>\n      <p>But not\
  \ every day of fall must be spent seeking a solution for a frightening curse or\
  \ dealing with the dangerous situations that crop up in town to threaten your neighbors\
  \ (including strange new horrors like the ones you see above). There are plenty\
  \ of new friends waiting to be made and numerous opportunities to build your reputation\
  \ even more by participating in some of the town’s most beloved annual traditions.</p>\n\

  \      <p>Hi! I'm Shao Han, a Paizo freelancer from Singapore who's been happily\
  \ at work on the new Tian Xia books. For the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path, I\
  \ contributed to the rituals, festivals, daily life, and customs of Willowshore,\
  \ as well as provided my insights and opinions on Asian ghosts, monsters, and folklore\
  \ as a sensitivity and cultural consultant.</p>\n      <p>In my day job, I teach\
  \ college students anthropology, philosophy, and Southeast Asian history, and in\
  \ my free time, I enjoy traveling to villages, palaces, temples, and sacred sites\
  \ across Asia to learn about art, culture, and the environment. I hope some of my\
  \ love for the rhythms, echoes, and struggles of my home region will resonate with\
  \ you when you play these games and help you understand a little more about the\
  \ everyday lives of Asia's peoples. Thank you!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Grady\
  \ Wang</h3>\n      <p>Hi, I’m Grady Wang. I’m a second generation Taiwanese American,\
  \ and Buddhism and Taoism were both strong influences in my household growing up.\
  \ I was always excited to see authentic representations of Eastern thought about\
  \ life, death, and reincarnation in Western media, so I’m thrilled to have the opportunity\
  \ to contribute to that legacy by fleshing out Sangpotshi for Pathfinder (expanding\
  \ on its first appearance in Pathfinder Second Edition in <em>Lost Omens Gods &amp;\
  \ Magic</em>)! Since Season of Ghosts presents so many amazing opportunities for\
  \ character-centric storytelling, this content should give you lots of new options\
  \ for playing someone in Tian Xia!</p>\n      <p>If you’d like to see my other work,\
  \ I’m the co-founder of the Gallant Goblin alongside my partner, Theo Thourson.\
  \ The Gallant Goblin is a TTRPG review channel on YouTube and other social media\
  \ platforms; we are also the makers of kuddly kobold plushies via our Hero Plush\
  \ line—you can find all our links at <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/thegallantgoblin\"\
  >linktr.ee/thegallantgoblin</a>. We also publish our own supplements, including\
  \ Pathfinder Infinite community content that seeks to promote diverse voices, such\
  \ as the Queerfinder series and Adventures in Jalmeray.</p>\n      <div class=\"\
