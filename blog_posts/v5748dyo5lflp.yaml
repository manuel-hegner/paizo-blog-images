  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">We are\
  \ in the home stretch now. The playtest has been going for three weeks now and we\
  \ have one week left to go. The big announcement this week is that we have released\
  \ a revised version of the playtest document! Inside you will find changes and alterations\
  \ to all 10 of the playtest classes, from sweeping changes to the Arcanist to smaller\
  \ alterations to the Shaman.</span></p> \n    <p>You can find the revised version\
  \ of the playtest document on your <a href=\"/paizo/account/assets\">My Downloads\
  \ page</a>. If you have yet to grab the document, you can download add it to your\
  \ account for free <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/advancedClassGuide\">here</a>.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Once you've downloaded the PDF and taken a look at our changes, head over\
  \ to the messageboards. We've created 10 new threads for you to use when discussing\
  \ these classes and we've locked the old threads to avoid any confusion. Give the\
  \ classes a try, use them in your games, roll up a PFS character, or just pit them\
  \ against foes in mock combats. We want to hear what you have to say. The design\
  \ on these classes is far from over, but your chance to comment comes to an end\
  \ in just one week on <b>December 17th</b>!</p> \n    <p>Once you've gotten a chance\
  \ to go through the revisions, don't forget to update your <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/advancedClassGuide/survey\"\
  >survey</a>. We are eager to see how these revisions affect your opinion and the\
  \ survey is our best tool to gauge your thoughts.</p> \n    <p>The playtest has\
  \ been great so far. We've gotten a lot of great ideas, feedback, and comments about\
  \ these classes, and we are excited to see what you have to say as the playtest\
  \ draws to a close. Thanks again for all of your hard work making this our most\
  \ successful playtest to date.</p> \n    <p>See you on the boards!</p> \n    <p>Jason\
