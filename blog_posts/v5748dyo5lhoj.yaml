  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 3, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome everyone to the Friday Publisher Preview,\
  \ and another look at some of the sweet <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> miniatures coming up in November's <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set of prepainted plastic gaming figures. Before\
  \ we get to that, however, I'd like to talk a little bit about the PREVIOUS set,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>. Specifically, I'd like\
  \ to discuss dungeon dressing.</p> \n     <p>Dungeon dressing is a new type of figure\
  \ introduced in <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>. That\
  \ set saw the release of six different sculpts, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9eod\"\
  >Anghazan Idol</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9eoe\">Bubbling Cauldron</a>, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9eob\">Burning Brazier</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9eoc\">Chest</a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9eog\">Iron Maiden</a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9eof\"\
  >Sarcophagus</a>.</p> \n     <p>Based on online commentary, it appears as though\
  \ dungeon dressing has been very popular, and some of the singles have been selling\
  \ for crazy money on the secondary market. From my perspective, that's primarily\
  \ due to a small handful of factors. The most important is availability.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In order to test the market for this sort of miniature, WizKids inserted\
  \ them in place of uncommon figures in randomly selected boosters, with at least\
  \ a full set of each figure in each case (case collation not guaranteed, etc., etc.,\
  \ etc.). In practice, that makes them equivalent to rares at the very least, which\
  \ is probably fitting in some sense. Since we announced dungeon dressing, a minority\
  \ of customers have been very against the idea, either because they don't use \"\
  props\" on their table, or simply because they'd prefer another monster or character\
  \ mini. </p> \n     <p>This sort of distribution for dungeon dressing has another\
  \ effect—it significantly reduced the number of figures we at paizo.com have to\
  \ sell. That's meant that, until today, zero dungeon dressing singles have appeared\
  \ on our web store.</p> \n     <p>Well, that changes as of now, with one major caveat.\
  \ As of this moment, customers can order dungeon dressing from paizo.com. <b><i>However</i></b>,\
  \ we know that the demand for these pieces will be very high, so in order to spread\
  \ their distribution as widely as possible, we are limiting sales of dungeon dressing\
  \ minis to one of each piece per customer account. I want to stress that we have\
  \ an extremely limited supply of these pieces, so even with the one-per-customer\
  \ limit I do not expect them to last very long. We'll evaluate how this goes for\
  \ the next set, and I'll do my best to keep you updated here over the months between\
  \ now and November.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71815-8-46-PR.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71815-8-46-PR_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>But wait, I hear some of you saying. One <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9eof\">Sarcophagus</a> or <a href=\"/products/btpy9eog\">Iron Maiden</a>\
  \ might be enough, but how about that awesome <a href=\"/products/btpy9eob\">Burning\
  \ Brazier</a>? I want like a dozen of those things!</p> \n     <p>Happily, I anticipated\
  \ the demand for the Burning Brazier immediately upon seing the final brilliant\
  \ design by WizKids, and I immediately ordered a special repaint <a href=\"/products/btpy9f5g\"\
  >Burning Brazier Promo Mini</a>, that is available exclusively from paizo.com. They\
  \ are online right now, with no per-customer limit. Trick out your whole dungeon\
  \ in these things!</p> \n     <p>I also made sure to differentiate the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9f5g\">Burning Brazier Promo</a> from the regular <a href=\"/products/btpy9eob\"\
  >Burning Brazier</a> figure by changing up the colors. The promo version is a flat\
  \ silver metal color, whereas the <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>\
  \ version has a gold color to it. That means you can set up an encounter with several\
  \ \"normal\" <a href=\"/products/btpy9f5g\">Promo Burning Braziers</a> and use the\
  \ more rare \"gold\" version as some kind of \"special\" set piece.</p> \n     <p>So\
  \ buy away to your heart's content!</p> \n     <p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to\
  \ get a promo version of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9eoc\">Chest</a> (probably\
  \ the best other candidate from this set), and there's no guarantee I'll be able\
  \ to do this with \"common\" dungeon dressing in future sets. But I knew people\
  \ would want more than one of those braziers, and I did what I could to make that\
  \ possible. </p> \n     <h2>And Now, Back to The Rusty Dragon Inn</h2> \n     <p>With\
  \ that out of the way, let's take a look at two pieces of dungeon dressing from\
  \ November's <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set.\
  \ As many of you have suspected, the dressing in this set follows the theme of the\
  \ set in general—the tavern. Let's take a look!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/PFB-20150703-WheeledCart.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/PFB-20150703-WheeledCart_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have a Cart that will look great as part of\
  \ a campsite, to liven up an urban street encounter, or carry around random junk.\
  \ I don't have final outputs of any of the Rusty Dragon figures yet, but the idea\
  \ is to make the back of this thing big enough to fit a figure into, so it also\
  \ makes a crude chariot. To my knowledge, the wheels on the cart are stationary,\
  \ so (as with all figures), you'll have to use a bit of imagination.</p> \n    \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/PFB-20150703-Wagon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/PFB-20150703-Wagon_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Even cooler than the cart is its older brother, the\
  \ Wagon. This simple wood-textured vehicle has a ton of uses. Cart around a player\
  \ character! Pick up several to fashion a crude barricade! Carry your dungeon treasure\
  \ back to town in style!</p> \n     <p>So, there you have it. Two of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn's</em></a> dungeon dressing figures.\
  \ But wait! I hear your questions already! </p> \n     <p>\"Hey Erik,\" I hear you\
  \ say. \"Just who is supposed to pull around this cart and wagon? Our player characters?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Why no,\" I reply calmly. \"I expect the set's Draft Horse to pull\
  \ them.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/PFB-20150703-DraftHorse.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/PFB-20150703-DraftHorse_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The Draft Horse is a Large, uncommon figure. </p> \n\
  \     <p>See you next week!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <em>Publisher</em></p> \n\
