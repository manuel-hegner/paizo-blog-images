  \ a Dark, Dark World</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, October 7, 2008</p> \n\
  \   <p> \"You're going to love this one,\" Erik told me when we decided to publish\
  \ Henry Kuttner's <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tx\"><i>The Dark World</i></a>. \"\
  It's amazing.\" </p>\n   <p> \"Cool,\" I said, and left it at that. After all, while\
  \ being publisher of <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet Stories</a> has given Erik\
  \ the chance to accelerate his ascension to pulp scholarship, we see a lot of good\
  \ books around here. So I got a little excited, but nothing out of the ordinary.\
  \ Then I saw what some other folks had to say about it. </p>\n   <blockquote> \n\
  \    <p> \"I consider the work of Henry Kuttner to be the finest science fantasy\
  \ ever written. <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tx\"><i>The Dark World</i></a> was the\
  \ best fantasy I have ever read...my copy is already half thumbed to death as I\
  \ imagine I have read it at least twelve times.\" <br>Marion Zimmer Bradley, author\
  \ of <i>The Mists of Avalon</i> </p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Oh. Well... </p>\n\
  \   <blockquote> \n    <p> \"Henry Kutter was a neglected master... a man who shaped\
  \ science fiction and fantasy in its most important years.\" <br>Ray Bradbury, author\
  \ of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> </p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Huh. </p>\n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p> \"The Kuttner story which most impressed me in those most impressionable\
  \ days was his short novel <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tx\"><i>The Dark World</i></a>.\
  \ I returned to it time and time, reading it over and over again, drawn by its colorful,\
  \ semi-mythic characters and strong action.... Looking back, Kuttner and Moore—\
  and, specifically, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tx\"><i>The Dark World</i></a>—were\
  \ doubtless a general influence on my development as a writer.\" <br>Roger Zelazny,\
  \ author of the Amber series </p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Okay, guys, I get it!\
  \ Geez! </p>\n   <p>The honest truth, though, is that <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tx\"\
  ><i>The Dark World</i></a> <b>is</b> amazing. In Kuttner's fast-reading fantasy\
  \ classic, WWII airman Edward Bond returns home from strange events during the war\
  \ to discover that his mind is no longer his own. Instead, he now shares his body\
  \ with his identical twin from an alternate dimension, the evil wizard Ganelon.\
  \ Sucked through a portal to the mysterious fey realm known as the Dark World, Bond\
  \ finds himself trapped between two warring factions. On one side is the Coven:\
  \ a werewolf, a hooded immortal, and a beautiful and seductive witch, all eager\
  \ to acknowledge Ganelon as their sinister ruler. On the other is the white sorceress\
  \ Freydis and her band of forest rebels that want nothing more than to see the warlock's\
  \ head on a spike. Within the first few pages, the book's central conflict comes\
  \ out swinging: will Edward/Ganelon join with the rebels to release the oppressed\
  \ world from the grip of a tyrannical, sacrifice—hungry god—or embrace the Coven\
  \ to become the world's greatest villain? </p>\n   <p>It's a classic premise—the\
  \ man drawn into another world of magic and swordplay—honed to the sharpest possible\
  \ edge by Kuttner's clever brand of mythology backed by science. Yet the vibrant,\
  \ instantly familiar setting isn't what makes this book stand out. No, what made\
  \ it startlingly different in its day was its moral ambiguity. In an era—remember,\
  \ we're in 1946—when you could reasonably expect any given protagonist to be a hard—\
  jawed paragon of virtue, instinctively punching and slashing his way to justice\
  \ without fail, Kuttner's hero is literally torn between good and evil. And for\
  \ the first time in my pulp—reading career, I began to actually fear that our hero\
  \ <i>might not win.</i> That the temptations of tyranny, unlimited power, and a\
  \ life of luxury might be too much, and Edward Bond might—to quote another science\
  \ fiction classic—give in to the dark side. </p>\n   <p>So take heed of what Marion,\
  \ Ray, Roger—and, yes, Erik—have been saying and give <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tx\"\
  ><i>The Dark World</i></a> a shot. There are witches. There are vampires. There\
  \ are werewolves. There are zombies. There are wizards and warlocks, dark gods with\
  \ bloody sacrifices, and things that go bump in the night. </p>\n   <p>And they're\
  \ <i>winning....</i> </p>\n   <p> James Sutter<br> <i>Planet Stories</i> Editor</p>\
