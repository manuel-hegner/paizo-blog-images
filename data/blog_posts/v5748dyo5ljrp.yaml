  ><img src=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Navasi_360.jpeg\"></a> \n       <p><i>Illustration\
  \ by Remko Troost</i></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>Born into a prominent family\
  \ on Absalom Station, the envoy who calls herself Navasi spent much of her childhood\
  \ avoiding her parents in their \"sky-villa,\" as they called their sprawling, six-story\
  \ home in the Nyori Palisades. Navasi's mother had designs on her canny-but-headstrong\
  \ daughter inheriting the family's business. Her father had visions of a queenly\
  \ young woman sitting in silk among the station's most prominent socialites.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Navasi wanted neither. A quip on her lips, she eschewed glitzy playdates\
  \ and family soirees in favor of zipping through Absalom Station's streets with\
  \ her best friends, the children of the household employees. She'd take the rush\
  \ of riding a screaming hovercycle over the pompous sniggering of the wealthy any\
  \ day of the week.</p> \n      <p>As she befriended more and more stationers from\
  \ less-privileged walks of life, Navasi's irritation with her parents and their\
  \ deliberate aloofness from the rest of society turned into outright disgust. The\
  \ inequities of Absalom Station, where the rich lived in fortified enclaves and\
  \ the poor lived in little more than metal boxes, pained her. Simply giving away\
  \ her pocket money didn't seem like enough. She began to dream of a fairy-tale life\
  \ in which she could steal the affluent's unearned wealth and give it to those truly\
  \ in need, and idolized the Free Captains of the Diaspora—pirates living by their\
  \ own rules. Navasi could only imagine the fun she'd have with such freedom—and\
  \ the good she'd do, of course.</p> \n      <p>On the eve of her eighteenth birthday,\
  \ Navasi sat in her plush quarters, staring at the gold-fibered holo-gown that was\
  \ to be her debut dress. Two choices stood before her. She could don that false\
  \ uniform, attend the gala, and accept her mother's gift of an executive position\
  \ in the family company. Or she could leave.</p> \n      <p>It took less than an\
  \ hour for Navasi to slip out of the manor and stow away onto a ship bound for the\
  \ Diaspora.</p> \n      <p>Navasi arrived on Broken Rock with a pocketful of stolen\
  \ credsticks and a gleam in her eye. She quickly signed up as a \"procurement specialist\"\
  \ with a contracting firm called the Sixth Finger—little more than a starfaring\
  \ thieves' guild—ready to use her new position to steal from exploitative corporations\
  \ and make herself a hero to those in need.</p> \n      <p>The reality of life in\
  \ a pirate enclave hit her like a meteorite. Having quickly blown through her money,\
  \ and too stubborn to return home in shame, Navasi found she no longer had a choice\
  \ in which jobs she took. Under the guildrunners' threats, she roughed up innocents,\
  \ stole from the less fortunate, and worse. Though she never completely lost her\
  \ egalitarian beliefs, she hardly recognized the naïve idealist she'd once been.\
  \ A few years in the streets showed her how much of her former life she'd taken\
  \ for granted, and taught her that if she wanted to take care of others, she first\
  \ needed to take care of herself. That, at least, she was good at, and she quickly\
  \ gained a reputation in the gang as the best fast-talker and facewoman around,\
  \ spinning bold plans and quick wits into fat paydays.</p> \n      <p>Now a jaded\
  \ young woman, Navasi found that the wealth from her scores brought little joy without\
  \ friends to share it with, and she took comfort in the hardscrabble survivalists\
  \ and secretly softhearted rogues she recruited to her crews. Yet it was in one\
  \ particular woman that Navasi truly found herself again. Purple-haired and tattooed,\
  \ with eyes like blue supergiants, the newcomer was outspoken against those in power.\
  \ She bucked the pirates' authority and operated alone, pulling the sorts of righteous\
  \ jobs Navasi had once dreamed of. She was the bravest, most exciting woman Navasi\
  \ had ever met, and despite Navasi's continuing allegiance to the Sixth Finger,\
  \ the two quickly became inseparable.</p> \n      <p>That all came crashing down\
  \ the day the Sixth Finger arranged to knock over a medship full of supplies bound\
  \ for Absalom Station. To the gang's leaders, the ship's mission—aiding refugees\
  \ of a wartorn star system—was inconsequential compared to the valuable drugs in\
  \ its cargo bays. Navasi's objections were overruled.</p> \n      <p>It was the\
  \ final straw. Together, Navasi and her partner formulated a plan, alerting the\
  \ medship to the imminent heist and carefully sabotaging the fighters the gang had\
  \ designated for the assault. It all might have gone unnoticed, had the gang's resident\
  \ technomancer not decided to check the security cams one final time. In the ensuing\
  \ ambush, Navasi and her partner were pinned down, their backs to the sole spaceworthy\
  \ ship—a single-seat fighter with only enough life support for one of them. Unwilling\
  \ to leave her companion, Navasi prepared for them to go out in a blaze of glory—\
  only to have her partner shove her into the cockpit and slam the canopy. As Navasi\
  \ scrabbled with the latch, the other woman winked, pulled the pins on her grenades,\
  \ and sprinted straight at their ambushers.</p> \n      <p>The wealthy scion of\
  \ Absalom Station died that day, as did the pirate she'd become. As she made her\
  \ way back to Absalom Station with the medship, knowing that neither the Sixth Finger\
  \ nor her spurned family would ever stop looking for her, she forsook both of her\
  \ previous incarnations. Abandoning her old identity, she took the name of her fallen\
  \ love—Navasi—and swore that henceforth she'd carry on the fight they'd started\
  \ together, only stealing from those who deserved it, putting her finger in the\
  \ eye of anyone who thrived on exploitation, regardless of which side of the law\
  \ they were on. Knowing she'd need a new appearance as well, she continued borrowing\
  \ from her partner, dyeing her jet-black hair purple and adding a single blue contact.\
  \ Yet when she considered mimicking the original Navasi's tattoos, she was shocked\
  \ to learn that they were symbols of Weydan, the god of discovery and equality,\
  \ famous for taking mortal form. Though her partner had never spoken of religion,\
  \ Navasi took it as a sign, and even holds out some hope that perhaps her companion\
  \ might have been more than she seemed, though she recognizes that such thoughts\
  \ are probably just a manifestation of her grief.</p> \n      <p>Today, Navasi has\
  \ built a reputation—perhaps more than is truly wise for a woman with a price on\
  \ her head—as a talented freelance captain, putting together crews for adventures\
  \ ranging from planetary scouting and private security to her old talent for \"\
  procurement,\" though she's careful about what sorts of jobs she and her friends\
  \ take on. Navasi still believes in freedom for all, spreading the wealth, and taking\
  \ plutocrats down a peg—but she also knows the value of earning credits, and takes\
  \ pride in the ability to take care of herself and her crew (though she still has\
  \ a sometimes inconvenient tendency to empty her pockets for those in need). As\
  \ a scoundrel, a fast-talker, and a brilliant negotiator, Navasi is happiest when\
  \ the chips are down and lives hang in the balance, as that's when you truly know\
  \ who your friends are. Above all, she knows to always look beneath the surface,\
  \ for like Navasi herself, nothing is ever quite what it seems.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
