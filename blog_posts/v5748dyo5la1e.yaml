  \ New Adventure on Old Mars!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, March 19, 2008</p>\
  \ \n   <p>(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. Those who have not yet read <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8c\"\
  ><i>City of the Beast</i></a> should seriously consider doing so before pressing\
  \ onward.)</p> \n   <p>Although it stands on its own as a novel, Michael Moorcock's\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdp\"><i>Lord of the Spiders</i></a> picks up immediately\
  \ where the events of <a href=\"/store /v5748btpy7x8c\"><i>City of the Beast</i></a>\
  \ left off. In the second of the Kane of Old Mars books, Moorcock brings us a slightly\
  \ darker series of adventures for the American physicist and duelist Michael Kane.\
  \ Pulled back to Earth on the eve of his engagement to the beautiful Princess Shizala,\
  \ Kane begins this story frantically preparing a second version of his matter transport\
  \ machine, this time with only the narrator (Mr. Edward P. Bradbury/Michael Moorcock\
  \ himself) to assist and fund his endeavors. Yet when the switch is finally thrown\
  \ and Kane goes hurtling through the aether to arrive on Mars's surface, he finds\
  \ things very different from when he left. The Blue Giant savages he remembers are\
  \ now civilized and in the midst of a bloody civil war, and the free peoples of\
  \ the south are marching on each other over false accusations. Has Michael Kane\
  \ arrived on the same planet, only to find himself centuries in the future? And\
  \ are his cunning and sword arm enough to free downtrodden peoples—both blue-skinned\
  \ and otherwise—from the rule of tyrants? Only an adventure worthy of Michael Moorcock—\
  complete with airships and spider-people, false gods and throne-room assassinations—\
  will reveal the truth. </p> \n   <p>And now, an excerpt from <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdp\"\
  ><i>Lord of the Spiders</i></a>:</p> \n   <blockquote> <i><p>They gibbered and fell\
  \ back for a moment, a terrible twittering noise, like that of thousands of bats,\
  \ filling the air and echoing on and on through the complex of chambers.</p> <p>Bac\
  \ Puri's sword swung to left and right, up and down, slicing off limbs, stabbing\
  \ vitals, piercing the unnaturally soft, clammy bodies. </p> <p>And then he was,\
  \ as if by magic, a mass of spears. He howled in his pain and madness as javelins\
  \ like the one we had seen earlier appeared in every part of his body until it was\
  \ almost impossible to distinguish the man beneath. </p> <p>He fell with a crash.\
  \ </p> <p>Seeing the creatures were at least mortal, I decided we should take advantage\
  \ of Bac Puri's mad attack and, waving my sword, I leapt through the entrance, shouting:\
  \ </p> <p> \"Come—they can be slain!\" </p> <p>They could be slain, but they were\
  \ elusive creatures and sight and feel of them brought physical revulsion. With\
  \ the others behind me, I carried the attack to them and soon found myself in a\
  \ tangle of soft, yielding flesh that seemed boneless. </p> <p>And the faces! They\
  \ were vile parodies of human faces and again resembled nothing quite so much as\
  \ the ugly little vampire bat of Earth. Flat faces with huge nostrils let into the\
  \ head, gashes of mouths full of sharp little fangs, half-blind eyes, dark and wicked—\
  and insensate. </p> <p>As I fought their claws, their sharp teeth and their spears,\
  \ they slithered about, gibbering and twittering. </p> <p>I had been wrong about\
  \ them. There was not a trace of intelligence in their faces—just a demoniac blood-hunger,\
  \ a dark malevolence that hated, hated, hated—but never reasoned. </p><p>My companions\
  \ and I stood shoulder to shoulder, back to back, as the things tore at us…</p></i>\
