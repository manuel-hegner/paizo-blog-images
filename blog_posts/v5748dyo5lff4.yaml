  \ itemprop=\"description\">The other day, Wes showed up in our cube with a treat:\
  \ a peak at an advance copy of <a href=\"/products/btpy92f5\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting: Towns of the Inner Sea</i></a>. I finally got to see my town, Solku,\
  \ in print!</span></p> \n    <p>When the list of available towns came out, I immediately\
  \ jumped on Solku, excited to explore this diverse corner of our world. Solku isn't\
  \ as famous as the much larger city of Katapesh, but it's a fascinating place: founded\
  \ by cultists fleeing persecution, preyed on by gnolls and fellow Katapeshi alike,\
  \ at once pious, mercantile, and afraid. It's decidedly good, but that doesn't mean\
  \ life there is easy <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la39\">(as exemplified by the\
  \ story of Solku's most famous resident, the iconic paladin Seelah)</a>—the town\
  \ is plagued by frequent attacks by gnoll bandits and slavers, and crowded with\
  \ long-term refugees. Being good also doesn't guarantee the well-intentioned inhabitants\
  \ all get along; the widening rift between the civilian government and Sarenrae's\
  \ church is another major source of tension in the town. And, of course, Solku also\
  \ has its fair share of con artists, madmen, and more!</p> \n    <p>I tried to write\
  \ about Solku like it was my own hometown—with a tangled mix of love and pride and\
  \ frustration. After all, while this book is partly about showing that adventure\
  \ isn't found only in dungeons and major cities, it's also about exploring places\
  \ and cultures that your characters could call home!</p> \n    <p>Judy Bauer<br>\
