  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">With Paizocon getting underway in just a few\
  \ days, we wanted to round out our previews by looking at the final class that you\
  \ will be able to play at the show. So, without further delay, it's time to look\
  \ at the wizard!</p> \n    <h2>Wizard Features</h2> \n    <p>If you are building\
  \ a wizard, everything starts with your key ability, Intelligence. Having a high\
  \ Intelligence gives you a boost to the DCs of your spells, and it gives you more\
  \ skill choices at 1st level.</p> \n    <p>At 1st level, you begin play with a spellbook\
  \ containing 10 cantrips and eight 1st-level spells, giving you a wide variety of\
  \ spells to draw upon when you prepare your magic each morning. Starting out, you\
  \ can prepare four cantrips and two 1st-level spells each day. In addition, you\
  \ also select your arcane school at 1st level, which grants you one extra spell\
  \ slot of each level that you can use only to prepare a spell from your chosen school.\
  \ You can compare this to the cleric, who doesn't get extra spell slots, but instead\
  \ gets a narrow ability to cast extra <i>heal</i> or <i>harm</i> spells. Your school\
  \ also grants you a school power that you can cast using a pool of Spell Points.\
  \ Take a look at the nifty power you can pick up from choosing divination as your\
  \ school. (Remember, that [[A]] code you see indicates that this is an action, and\
  \ it will be a snazzy icon in the final rulebook!)</p> \n    <blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p class=\"stat-block-title\">DIVINER'S SIGHT</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Concentrate, Divination, Fortune</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Casting</b>\
  \ [[A]] Verbal Casting</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Range</b> 30 feet;\
  \ <b>Targets</b> one willing living creature</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Duration</b> end of your next turn or until dismissed</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">You glimpse into the target's future. Roll a d20. When the target\
  \ attempts a Perception check, saving throw, or skill check, it can use the number\
  \ you rolled instead of rolling, and the spell is dismissed. Casting it again dismisses\
  \ any active <i>diviner's sight</i>.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Even if you\
  \ don't roll so great, it might still help avoid a critical failure on a vital saving\
  \ throw.</p> \n    <p>You can forgo selecting an arcane school, instead choosing\
  \ to be a universalist. This grants you a bonus wizard feat and extra uses of your\
  \ arcane focus.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of which, all wizards gain the ability to\
  \ place some of their power into a designated item called an arcane focus. You can\
  \ drain the power from that focus once per day to cast any one spell that you have\
  \ already cast without spending another spell slot. Universalists get to use this\
  \ ability once for each level of spell that they can cast!</p> \n    <p>As a wizard\
  \ goes up in level, they gain more spells that they can cast (either one extra spell\
  \ of their highest level, or two of a new level) and their proficiency at spellcasting\
  \ also increases. They start as trained, but rise to the rank of legendary at 19th\
  \ level.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180521-Ezren.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Wizard\
  \ Feats</h2> \n    <p>Wizards have never had too many class features to choose from\
  \ to help distinguish them from one another, so when it came time to design feats\
  \ for the wizard, it was a clear opportunity to add some variety to the class.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Lets start out with a few classic concepts. At 1st level, you can pick\
  \ up a feat that allows you to spend your reaction to counterspell any spell someone\
  \ else casts as long as you currently have that spell prepared. If that isn't to\
  \ your taste, you can take a wizard feat to recruit a familiar instead. Every day,\
  \ you can select a pair of abilities to give this loyal companion, some of which\
  \ grant you boons as well. At high levels, your familiar can even grant you an additional\
  \ spell slot, as long as it is 3 levels lower than the highest-level spell you can\
  \ cast. At 8th level you can select from a series of feats that enhance the power\
  \ of your arcane school, increasing your pool of Spell Points and granting you an\
  \ extra spell you can cast using that pool. One of my favorites is the necromantic\
  \ power called <i>life siphon</i>, which lets you draw some of the magic from a\
  \ non-cantrip necromancy spell you cast to regain 1d8 Hit Points per level of the\
  \ spell.</p> \n    <p>Not surprisingly, the wizard also has a lot of feats to choose\
  \ from that modify the spells that you cast. While many of these metamagic feats\
  \ will be familiar to veterans of the game, allowing you to extend the reach or\
  \ widen the area of a spell, for example, others are new. Conceal Spell lets you\
  \ add an action to a spell as you cast it to hide the fact that you are casting.\
  \ Focus Conservation is an action you can add to any spell that you cast by draining\
  \ your arcane focus, and it lets you drain your arcane focus again the next round,\
  \ casting another spell as long as it is 2 levels lower than the spell you just\
  \ cast. Better still, you can keep using this feat as long as you have lower-level\
  \ spells to cast. For example, if you start out draining your focus to cast <i>cone\
  \ of cold</i> (a 5th-level spell dealing a wicked 11d6 cold damage to all your enemies),\
  \ you could follow it up next round with a <i>fireball</i>. If you use the feat\
  \ again, you could drain focus again on the following round, casting any 1st-level\
  \ spell you had already cast.</p> \n    <p>As a wizard rises to the highest levels\
  \ of power, their feats grant them more and more options when determining how to\
  \ best utilize their spells. Effortless Concentration gives you a free action at\
  \ the start of each round to concentrate on a spell you have cast, freeing you up\
  \ to use all 3 actions normally. Superior Focus gives you another use of your arcane\
  \ focus. Quick Preparation lets you swap out spells you have already prepared in\
  \ just 10 minutes. At 20th level, you can pick Spell Combination, which lets you\
  \ combine two spells into one terrifying attack that you can unleash on one unfortunate\
  \ foe.</p> \n    <h2>Spells</h2> \n    <p>One of the biggest ways you can customize\
  \ your wizard is in your spell selection, so it's probably worth looking at a few\
  \ signature wizard spells to see how they work. Let's start with one of the most\
  \ iconic spells of them all.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >MAGIC MISSILE <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">SPELL 1</span></p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Evocation, Force</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Casting</b>\
  \ [[A]] Verbal Casting or more</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Range</b>\
  \ 120 feet; <b>Targets</b> one creature</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You\
  \ send a dart of force streaking toward a creature that you can see. It automatically\
  \ hits and deals 1d4+1 force damage. When Casting this Spell, you can increase the\
  \ casting by a Material Casting action, a Somatic Casting action, or both. For each\
  \ component you add, increase the number of missiles you shoot by one. You choose\
  \ the target for each missile individually.</p> \n     <p><b>Heightened (+2)</b>\
  \ You shoot one additional missile with each action you spend.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Magic missile</i> shows off a couple of interesting options in the\
  \ wizard's arsenal. Casting a spell can be done in a number of ways using a variable\
  \ number of actions. While most of the time this is through metamagic feats, it\
  \ can also come from the spell itself. Adding casting actions to <i>magic missile</i>\
  \ gives you more missiles to throw. In addition, a wide variety of spells can be\
  \ prepared using a higher-level spell slot, giving you a better effect without having\
  \ to refer to an entirely different spell. (You can find out more about that in\
  \ the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkpv?All-About-Spells\">All About Spells</a>\
  \ blog.) That means you can prepare <i>magic missile</i> as a 9th-level spell and\
  \ spend three actions casting it for 15 missiles!</p> \n    <p>Another important\
  \ aspect of picking spells for your wizard is to balance what saving throws they\
  \ allow and what effects you can get depending on the results of the save. For that,\
  \ let's take a look at a spell that might instantly kill a foe.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">PHANTASMAL KILLER <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >SPELL 4</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Death, Emotion, Fear, Illusion,\
  \ Mental</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Casting</b> [[A]] Somatic Casting,\
  \ [[A]] Verbal Casting</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Range</b> 120 feet;\
  \ <b>Targets</b> one living creature</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You create\
  \ a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only\
  \ the spell's target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the\
  \ illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the\
  \ outcome of the target's Will saving throw.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Success</b> The target is frightened 1.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Critical Success</b> The target is unaffected.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Failure</b> The target takes 8d6 mental damage and is frightened 2.</p> \n \
  \    <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Critical Failure</b> The target is so afraid it\
  \ might instantly die. It must attempt a Fortitude saving throw; if the target fails,\
  \ it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and dies. On a successful Fortitude save, the target\
  \ still takes 12d6 mental damage, is fleeing until the end of its next turn, and\
  \ is frightened 4.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Heightened (+1)</b> The\
  \ damage on a failure increases by 2d6 and on a critical failure by 3d6.</p> \n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <p>This spell is perfect for removing a lower-level foe\
  \ from a fight, but it has the chance of greatly hampering a higher-level foe as\
  \ well. The frightened condition reduces by 1 each turn, but it applies a penalty\
  \ to almost all of your checks and rolls until it does. You will find interesting\
  \ choices like these throughout the arcane spell list. While most will be familiar\
  \ to a Pathfinder veteran, there are a lot of new spells to explore as well, from\
  \ <i>grim tendril</i> to <i>chromatic wall</i>, so your wizard will be ready for\
  \ anything.</p> \n    <p>Well, that wraps up our look at the wizard. If you want\
  \ to give this class (or the alchemist, cleric, fighter, paladin, or rogue) a try,\
  \ make sure to stop by PaizoCon (this weekend), the UK Games Expo (early June),\
  \ or Origins (mid-June), as we'll be running demos during all three conventions!</p>\
