               <p>The magic items you find during your adventures become a part of your story and let you do things beyond the techniques you've mastered and the spells you know. So how do these essentials of the game work in the Pathfinder Playtest?</p>
               <p>Magic items are used in three major ways: by investing them, by activating them, or automatically. Invested items are ones you wear that you have to prepare as you don them, after which they work continuously. Activating items follows a system similar to that used for spells. Just as casting a spell requires you to spend actions to supply the somatic, verbal, and material components of the spell, activated items require you to use the Command Activation, Focus Activation, or Operate Activation action, or a combination of multiple actions. A potion requires you to spend an Operate Activation action to drink it. A <em>necklace of fireballs</em> requires you to spend 2 Operate Activation actions to unbind a bead and throw it. Activating a <em>luck blade</em> to reroll an attack just takes a mental nudge with a Focus Activation reaction (though you get to do that only once per day). Automatic activation happens with a small category of items that give their benefit whenever they're used for their normal purpose. A prime example is a sword with the <em>frost</em> property rune, which is always coated with frost and needs only hit a foe to deal extra cold damage.</p>

               <h2>Resonance</h2>
               <p>Activating or investing an item costs 1 Resonance Point (RP). You might have heard a bit about this on the Glass Cannon podcast! Resonance is a new resource all characters have that can be used to activate items. Your innate magic item resonance is represented by a number of Resonance Points equal to your level plus your Charisma modifier. This ties back to the Pathfinder First Edition concept of Charisma as the main ability score tied to innate magic, as seen in the Use Magic Device skill and the fact that Charisma is used for spell-like abilities, oracles, sorcerers, and so forth. However, in Pathfinder Second Edition, true scholars of itemcraft *cough*alchemists*cough* might get to use their Intelligence instead.</p>
               <p>The idea of resonance stems from the Pathfinder First Edition occultist, who was able to tap into the magical potential of items, and even before that to the idea of resonance between creatures and various magic items, as seen with the resonant powers of <em>wayfinders</em>. We've expanded that concept to apply to everyone. In practical terms, you're really unlikely to run out of Resonance Points unless you're using an absurd number of items, and you're at the greatest risk at low levels. You still have a chance even if your pool is empty, though. You can overspend Resonance Points! If you're at 0 RP, you can attempt to activate or invest an item anyway. You need to attempt a flat check (a d20 roll with no modifiers) against a DC equal to 10 + the number of points you've overspent today. So the first item has a 50% chance of working, and it gets more risky from there.</p>
               <p>We expect Resonance Points to be a contentious topic, and we're really curious to see how it plays at your tables. It's one of the more experimental changes to the game, and the playtest process gives us a chance to see it in the wild before committing to it. Here are the advantages we see from a design perspective:</p>
               <ol>
                <li>Using items is clear and consistent. Spend the required actions and 1 RP, and you activate or invest your item. If someone else wants to use the same item, you can remove it and let them put it on and invest it themselves.</li>
                <li>You have less to track. We get to remove some of the sub-pools that individual items have (such as "10 rounds per day which need not be consecutive" or "5 charges") because we know you have an overall limited resource. There are still some items that can't be used without limit, but they get to be special exceptions rather than being common out of necessity.</li>
                <li>It puts the focus on the strongest items. Because you can't activate items indefinitely, your best bet is to use the most RP-efficient item, not the most gp-efficient item. You want a high-level healing wand because you get more healing for your Resonance Point rather than getting a bunch of low-level wands because they're cheap.</li>
                <li>Investiture limits what you can wear. That means we don't need to rely heavily on an item slot system, creating more flexibility in what kind of worn items are useful. You'll read more about this on the blog on Friday, when we talk about removing the magic item Christmas tree!</li>
               </ol>
               <p>Will those benefits be compelling? Will people prefer this system over the Pathfinder First Edition system? We look forward to finding out!</p>
               <p>Want to look at an item to see how this works in practice?</p>
               <blockquote>
                <p class="stat-block-title">Cloak of Elvenkind <span class="stat-block-cr">Item 10+</span></p>
                <p class="stat-block-1">Illusion, Invested, Magical</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use </b>worn, cloak; <b>Bulk</b> L</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Focus Activation, [[A]] Operate Activation</p>
                <hr style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <p class="stat-block-1">This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, and is embroidered with gold trim and symbols of significance to the elves. The cloak allows you to cast the <em>ghost sound</em> cantrip as an innate arcane spell. When you draw the hood up over your head (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, giving you an item bonus to Stealth checks. If you activate the cloak, you pull the hood up and are affected by <em>invisibility </em>for 1 minute or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first.</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Type </b>standard; <b>Level</b> 10; <b>Price</b> 1,000 gp</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1">The cloak grants a +3 bonus.</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Type </b>greater; <b>Level</b> 18; <b>Price</b> 24,000 gp</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1">The cloak grants a +5 bonus, and <em>invisibility</em> is 4th level. If you're also wearing <em>greater boots of elvenkind</em>, the <em>greater cloak of elvenkind</em> allows you to Sneak in forest environments even when creatures are currently observing you.</p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>Here's a fairly complex item to show multiple parts of the system at once. The <em>cloak of elvenkind</em> is level 10, and there's also a <em>greater cloak of elvenkind</em> with an item level of 18. In case you missed it in the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkq6?Secrets-of-Alchemy"><b>crafting blog</b></a>, items have levels now, which indicate the point at which you can craft them (as well as being handy for the GM when making treasure hoards). Method of use indicates that this item is worn and that it's a cloak. A few items have this two-part listing because they're hard to wear multiples of. Multiple cloaks, multiple boots... not practical. Multiple rings or amulets? No problem.</p>
               <p>This item is both invested (note the invested trait) and activated (as you can see by the activation entry). Investing the cloak lets you cast <em>ghost sound</em>. You get this benefit as long as the cloak is invested, which means you can cast the spell whenever you want without activating the cloak and therefore without spending more Resonance Points. You can also get an item bonus to Stealth checks from the cloak (+3 or +5 for a greater cloak). Finally, you can activate the cloak as you raise the hood, spending 1 Resonance Point to turn invisible! Certainly not every item has as much going on as a <em>cloak of elvenkind</em>, but several classic items seemed like they needed a little extra special treatment! What do you think? Too much?</p>
               <p>How about something simpler?</p>
               <blockquote>
                <p class="stat-block-title">Floating Shield <span class="stat-block-cr">Item 13</span></p>
                <p class="stat-block-1">Magical</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 2,800 gp</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use </b>held, 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Operate Activation</p>
                <hr style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <p class="stat-block-1">This master-quality light wooden shield (Hardness 6) protects you without requiring you to spend actions each round. When you activate this shield, you can release it from your grip as a part of that action. The shield floats in the air next to you, granting you its bonus automatically, as if you Raised the Shield. Because you're not wielding the shield, you can't use reactions such as Shield Block with the shield.</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1">After 1 minute, the shield drops to the ground, ending its floating effect. While the shield is adjacent to you, you can grasp it with an Interact action, ending its floating effect.</p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>You can hold this and use it just like any other shield. Activating it lets you free up a hand to cause the shield to float, where it protects you without you spending an action! While the <em>floating shield </em>offers far less Hardness than many magic shields of a similar level (some have Hardness up to 18!), it's not meant for Shield Block, and its abilities allow you to use it even with a character who needs both hands for other things.</p>
               <p>Now let's look at two special types of items: one revamped classic and one brand-new category!</p>
               <h2>Staves</h2>
               <p>We went through several different iterations of staves. They needed to remain a powerful tool for spellcasters, but we also wanted them to appear earlier in the game so you didn't have to wait for most staves to appear at higher levels. Let's see the <em>staff of healing</em>!</p>
               <blockquote>
                <p class="stat-block-title">Staff of Healing <span class="stat-block-cr">Item 3+</span></p>
                <p class="stat-block-1">Invested, Magical, Necromancy, Staff</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use</b> held, 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> 1</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> Cast a Spell (1 RP)</p>
                <hr style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                <p class="stat-block-1">Made of smooth white wood, this staff is capped at each end with a golden cross adorned with a multitude of ruby cabochons. A <em>staff of healing</em> adds an item bonus to the Hit Points you restore any time you cast the <em>heal </em>spell using your own spell slots, using charges from the staff, or from channel energy.</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> minor; <b>Level</b> 3; <b>Price</b> 60 gp; <b>Maximum Charges</b> 3</p>
                <p class="stat-block-1">The item bonus to <em>heal</em> spells is +1.</p>
                <ul>
                 <li><em> stabilize</em> (cantrip)</li>
                 <li><em>heal</em> (level 1)</li>
                </ul>
               </blockquote>
               <p>I've included only the level 3 <em>minor staff of healing</em> here. There are also versions at levels 7, 11, and 15, and they add higher-level <em>heal</em> spells, plus <em>restoration</em>, <em>remove disease</em>, <em>restore senses</em>, and more! A staff is tied to you, which means you have to invest it, unlike most held items. This investiture has two extra benefits. First off, it links the staff to you, preventing anyone else from investing the staff for 24 hours. More importantly, it restores charges to the staff equal to the highest level of spell you can cast. You don't have to expend any spells to do this; it's all part of using your Resonance Points. You'll notice this also means that if you find one of these as a 1st-level character, it will take you longer to recharge it than if you're a higher-level spellcaster. You also get the item bonus to healing as long as you hold the invested staff.</p>
               <p>Now how do you cast these spells? Well, you activate the staff as part of casting one of the spells in it (spending 1 RP as usual). Then you have two options: You can either expend charges from the staff equal to the spell's level (1 charge for <em>heal</em> here) or expend one of your own spells of that level or higher. Yeah, your staff essentially lets you spontaneously cast the spells in it!</p>
               <h2>Trinkets</h2>
               <p>How about something completely different? One thing we wanted to add was a type of item that was like scrolls for martial characters. Spellcasters use scrolls and everyone uses potions, but how about something special that relies on nonmagical skills? Trinkets were the answer! Our first example was designed specifically for fighters.</p>

                <p class="stat-block-1">Dark smoke seems to writhe within this obsidian gem. When you activate the gem, if your Intimidating Strike hits, the target is frightened 2 and flat-footed against your attacks until the end of your next turn. If the attack roll is a critical success, the target is flat-footed against your attacks for 1 minute.</p>

               <p>Trinkets all have the consumable trait, meaning they're used up after being activated once. They have the "affixed" method of use, and as this one indicates, it has to be affixed to a weapon. You can activate it with a Focus Activation as a free action when you use the Intimidating Strike action from the fighter feat of the same name. This makes the Intimidating Strike more severe, increasing its effect to frightened 2 instead of frightened 1 and making it especially strong on a critical success.</p>
               <p>Now how about a trinket that's less specific?</p>

                <p class="stat-block-1">This copper coin dangles from a leather strip strung through a hole drilled into the coin's center. It's usually tied just below the throat on a suit of armor. Until it is activated, the coin becomes invisible for a few seconds every few minutes, but always at random intervals. When you activate the coin, you gain the benefits of a 2nd-level <em>invisibility</em> spell until the end of your next turn.</p>

               <p>Anyone with master proficiency in Stealth can use this trinket by affixing it to her armor. She can turn invisible by activating the coin when she rolls a Stealth check for initiative. Pretty useful in the first round of a fight!</p>
