  date\">Monday, October 29, 2007</p> \n    <p>With Halloween coming up, we thought\
  \ it a good idea to look back to the Foxglove Manor chapter of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8029\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #2</a> (which, incidentally, would work extremely well as a standalone\
  \ haunted house romp for All Hallows' Eve) and explain a bit more about one of the\
  \ spooky innovations introduced there. </p> \n    <p>In \"The Skinsaw Murders,\"\
  \ we present a new way to handle an old classic—haunts. The mechanic for haunts\
  \ is cool because it allows us to present really atmospheric encounters in a way\
  \ that combines crunchy game play and creepy flavor. It also allows for a lot of\
  \ flexibility in ways that classic haunted house monsters like ghosts don't really\
  \ work. You want a room with walls that bleed? A haunt can do that. With a ghost,\
  \ it's a little trickier. </p> \n    <p>You can expect haunts to show up now and\
  \ then in <i>Pathfinder</i>—when they do, we'll reprint the basic rules so you don't\
  \ need to always have a copy of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8029\"><i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ #2</a> on hand. But one thing became clear as I started reading messageboard posts\
  \ about \"The Skinsaw Murders\": what's missing is a section that talks about how\
  \ haunts play out in the game. I posted the rest of this blog post on the messageboard,\
  \ but I think it's important enough to \"graduate\" into the blog, so here it is!\
  \ <b>(WARNING: A small spoiler for \"The Skinsaw Murders\" is built into the rest\
  \ of this post!)</b> </p> \n    <p>The best analogy for a haunt is a trap. Treat\
  \ them in play as traps, but traps that are evil and freaky and have a malevolent\
  \ guiding intelligence behind them. </p> \n    <p>Take the first trap, the Burning\
  \ Manticore, as an example. The PCs may smell burning hair the first time they pass\
  \ through the room. The second time, the haunt manifests. Ask the PC who's haunted\
  \ by burning to make a Spot check. If he fails the DC 20 check, the haunt manifests,\
  \ makes its attack on him, and if he's hit he makes a Reflex save to avoid catching\
  \ on fire. If he catches on fire, to his friends it looks like he just spontaneously\
  \ combusts—he's the only one who can see the haunt, remember. Once the haunt's done\
  \ its thing, that's it. It's done for a day; it can't be triggered again for 24\
  \ hours. </p> \n    <p>If the haunted PC makes that DC 20 Spot check, have him roll\
  \ Initiative. Describe to him the image of the manticore lurching to life, its face\
  \ shifting and its fur igniting, but don't have the haunt do its thing until initiative\
  \ count 10. If the PC alerts his friends that something's going on, they get to\
  \ roll Initiative checks as well. Anyone who goes before 10 gets to do something\
  \ about the haunt (but remember, only the haunted character can SEE what's going\
  \ on). This includes attempts to turn undead, to run out of the room, to cast resist\
  \ elements (fire) on the haunted character, and so on. At initiative count 10, the\
  \ haunt triggers (unless its target is gone, in which case it fades away and can't\
  \ activate again for 24 hours) and does its thing, then fades away.</p> \n    <p>James\
