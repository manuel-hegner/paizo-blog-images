  \ The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens Character Guide</a> is available now at your local gaming store and\
  \ here on paizo.com! If you haven’t had a chance to check out what kind of awesome\
  \ content shows up in the book, take some time to check out <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/lostOmensCharacterGuide\"\
  >blog posts</a> from the past weeks. All of those posts cover the cool content for\
  \ ancestries and organizations, but there’s one more section of the book we wanted\
  \ to show off. However, rather than just giving a typical preview, we wanted to\
  \ show the book in action and have you, fine readers, follow along at home!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The final section of the Character Guide is an NPC gallery showcasing\
  \ individuals from the five organizations featured in the book. Each organization\
  \ receives two different NPCs: a standard, rank and file member and a higher ranking\
  \ member. The standard member is a level 4 NPC and include the likes of Hellknight\
  \ armigers and Magaambya adepts. The higher ranking members are level 11 NPCs, such\
  \ as the veteran reclaimer of the Knights of Lastwall and Pathfinder Venture-Captains.\
  \ We present a generic stat block to represent each of these NPCs, but my fellow\
  \ developer Eleanor Ferro also took some time to present a sample personality to\
  \ attach to each of the stat blocks so they are ready to go for your own games.\
  \ The Venture-Captain, for example, is Khoumrock Blackthane, explorer extraordinaire!\
  \ (We like to call him Captain Octo-boots around these parts.)</p> \n      <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102219_VentureCaptain.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"A male dwarf in heavy armor encrusted with barnacles that appears to be\

  \ and ignoring the small red octopus wrapped around his left ankle.\"></a> \n  \
  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration by Yanis Cardin</p> \n      </div>\
  \ \n      <p>These stat blocks are great, but what if you need stats for one of\
  \ the other prominent organizations in the Inner Sea? Or, what if you need a Hellknight\
  \ that’s level 7 or a very powerful Magaambyan mage that’s level 16? Well, the final\
  \ section of the NPC gallery has you covered! This section provides a new addition\
  \ to the rules: theme templates. Much like the elite and weak adjustments featured\
  \ in the Bestiary, these templates are simple adjustments that you can apply to\
  \ any NPC or monster to give them appropriate abilities that match the flavor of\
  \ a specific theme. In this case, these theme templates help you create new creatures\
  \ that are members of the various organizations featured in this book.</p> \n  \
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102219_ThemeTemplate.png\"\
  ><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102219_ThemeTemplate.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Bellflower Network. Members of the Bellflower Network fight against slavery\
  \ where they can, liberating slaves and helping those in need.\"></a> \n      </div>\
  \ \n      <p>While the Character Guide goes into much greater detail, the basics\
  \ are that you take an existing creature, take a look at its level and apply all\
  \ of the template’s abilities to the stat block. The higher level the creature,\
  \ the more abilities it receives. We recommend that you take a look at the final\
  \ stat block to determine whether or not the creature has grown in power with its\
  \ additional abilities and adjust its level accordingly. (The recently released\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021ct?Gamemastery-Guide-Monster-and-Hazard-Creation\"\
  >rules for creating creatures</a> will be big help here!) With these abilities,\
  \ you should be able to quickly take any existing stat block and adjust it to the\
  \ flavor you need. This might be as simple as taking a thief and making them an\
  \ Aspis Consortium smuggler or something more bizarre like a Pathfinder yeti! We\
  \ even have a list of different monsters that would be a good fit for each theme\
  \ template to encourage some more monstrous members for your games.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Of course, I can tell you all the cool things you can do, but it’s more fun\
  \ to show you! I’ve taken some of the theme templates and monsters from the Bestiary\
  \ to show you the final results. Each of the following stats has had both the theme\
  \ template and elite adjustment applied to them. For the most part, they should\
  \ look the same as the stats you’re used to seeing in the Bestiary, but they each\
  \ have some tweaks here and there to accommodate the template. The centaur has swapped\
  \ from a longsword to a halberd and learned Infernal as part of her Hellknight training\
  \ and I spell out some of the new abilities on the dragon’s stat block.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Hopefully you get a lot of mileage out of these stats and the theme templates\
  \ themselves! I’m a big fan of the templates and I’m sure they’ll show up here and\
  \ there in the Lost Omens line where they make sense, so keep an eye out for them!\
  \ And with that, we can finally close the book on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens Character Guide</a>. If any of what you’ve seen here has looked interesting,\
  \ I recommend checking it out. Keep an eye on this blog, though, as there are always\
  \ more books on the way! I hear the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zqa?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"\
  >next one</a> is going to be <i>divine</i>. So, without further ado, let’s look\
  \ at those monsters!</p> \n      <h2>Gwynimar Altiraan</h2> \n      <p>Taken in\
  \ at a young age by Maidrayne Vox, the Mistress of Blades at Citadel Vraid, Gwynimar\
  \ recalls very little of her youth. What memories she has are of grueling hours\
  \ training on the crags of the Mindspin Mountains. Maidrayne remains the only person\
  \ she maintains any kind of relationship as the rest of the Order of the Nail look\
  \ upon Gwynimar with disdain. It’s of no matter to Gwynimar, however, as the Measure\
  \ and the Chain come first and stand above all. Gwynimar’s training will soon be\
  \ complete and once the Mistress of Blades unleashes her from Vraid, Gwynimar will\
  \ be swift in bringing order to frontier beyond.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n      <p>Philannia’s search for the greater secrets of life soon led her to\
  \ seek out the means of achieving immortality. In this search she found herself\
  \ following Urgathoa, as the Pallid Princess’s promises of eternal indulgence through\
  \ undeath sang to Philannia’s heart in ways that nothing else did. During one of\
  \ her prayers, Philannia caught sight of a great explosion to the north. She soon\
  \ learned that the explosion caused the creation of countless undead and saw it\
  \ as a sign form Urgathoa. Philannia struck out toward the sight of the omen and\
  \ found agents of the Whispering Way. Here were the agents of Urgathoa herself,\
  \ ready to take her in and teach Philannia their secrets…</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ of the Vibrant Wave</h2> \n      <p>Even into his older age, Karthival was always\
  \ on the lookout for more opportunities to revel and delight in the joys of the\
  \ world. Unfortunately for him, the sight of a dragon typically puts off most that\
  \ approach him. When the Vibrant Wave, a Firebrand ship, sailed neared his lair\
  \ in northeast Rahadoum, Karthival reached out to the curious ship. While there\
  \ was some initial fear with Karthival’s appearance, the crew quickly took a liking\
  \ to him and invited him to tag along in their adventures. Now Karthival flies alongside\
  \ the ship on its countless journeys, joining them in their escapades and reliving\
  \ the excitement of his younger years.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\
