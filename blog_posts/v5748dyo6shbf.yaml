  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p></p>\n      <blockquote>\n       Ehu Hadif Ko’\
  ra Amares of Clan Tolar steps into the office. His office now, he realizes, and\
  \ smiles slightly. The newly-elected First Seeker sits behind the desk and brings\
  \ up the data display, reviewing the mission information he’d already read countless\
  \ times already at his temporary lodgings. The information detailed two important\
  \ missions that had come to his attention in the immediate aftermath of his formal\
  \ elevation and ceremony with the amalgam intelligence known as Guidance.\n    \
  \   <p></p> \n       <p>First, Ehu Hadif re-reads the request for assistance from\
  \ one of the Veskarium’s highest members of government, High Despot Jularaz the\
  \ Frozen, known as the senior political representative of the fringe Veskarium world\
  \ of Vesk-8. The appearance of a message bearing his seal of office had at first\
  \ surprised the new First Seeker. Ehu Hadif reads the message for the seventh time,\
  \ trying to find some hidden meaning in the request for a Starfinder Society investigation\
  \ of a strange anomaly on Vesk-8. No matter how many times Ehu reads the message,\
  \ he always feels he’s missing some key piece of context and that the Society might\
  \ be walking into a political trap.</p> \n       <p>Bringing up the second mission\
  \ report, Ehu smiles, knowing that it was already handled and doesn’t require his\
  \ immediate attention. After some misunderstandings over the past few years, the\
  \ Aballonian corporation, Resurgent Technologies, had reached out to Ehu Hadif in\
  \ hopes of working with the Society on a new-generation starship. Not only had Celita\
  \ of the Dataphiles and Fitch of the Wayfinders managed to handle the initial negotiations\
  \ with Resurgent Technologies, but Fitch offered to join a group of Starfinders\
  \ sent to retrieve a Resurgent Technologies scientist needed to complete the project\
  \ from a research outpost in the Vast.</p> \n       <p>Ehu flips back to the data\
  \ from Jularaz the Frozen’s office and once again debates how to respond. Opening\
  \ more ties with the Veskarium would have untold value to the Starfinder Society.\
  \ However, Jularaz’s ruthless reputation, as well as the generally antagonistic\
  \ approach of many Veskarium officials, is known and something Ehu must consider\
  \ before sending Starfinders into a potentially dangerous situation. The First Seeker\
  \ wonders if the benefits of improved relationships outweighed the risks of getting\
  \ embroiled in Veskarium politics.</p> \n       <p>He stares through the holographic\
  \ data stream, but then his eyes catch something on the desk: a simple white envelope.\
  \ Closing the data stream with a swipe of his upper arms, Ehu carefully grabs the\
  \ sealed envelope with his lower limbs. Delicately breaking the wax seal, he reads\
  \ the short words printed in ink on the paper within.</p> \n       <p><em>“Trust\
  \ your instincts. You’ll do fine. -Luwazi”</em></p> \n       <p>Smiling at the letter’\
  s simple contents, Ehu gently places the paper to the side. He opens the Veskarium\
  \ invitation and begins formulating his reply.</p>\n      </blockquote> \n     \

  \      </div> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hey folks! This month sees us\
  \ release our second batch of scenarios for the Year of Exploration’s Edge. <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq024x1?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-303-Frozen-Ambitions-The-Shimmerstone-Gateway\"\
  >Starfinder Society #3-03: Frozen Ambitions: The Shimmerstone Gateway</a>, by Paizo’\
  s own Samantha Phelan, is the first in an interlinked series of scenarios that has\
  \ the Starfinder Society exploring <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-Near-Space\"\
  >Near Space</a>; starting with a visit to the outermost fringes of the Veskarium.\
  \ Based on the narrative above, First Seeker Ehu Hadif still isn’t entirely sure\
  \ how this mission is going to turn out! </p> \n      <p>Our second scenario, <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024x2?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-Vast-Experiment-Falling-into-Deliverance\"\
  >Starfinder Society #3-04: The Vast Experiment: Falling into Deliverance</a>, comes\
  \ from veteran author, and another fellow Paizo employee, John Compton (of some\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  >Live Exploration Extreme!</a> fame). This scenario starts off the Vast Experiment\
  \ scenario series, and takes our PCs off into the depths of the Vast to rescue a\
  \ scientist from a dangerous situation, all in order to start construction of a\
  \ new generation of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023hm?Starfinder-Starship-Operations-Manual\"\
  >Starfinder Society starship</a>.</p> \n      <p>As we mentioned previously, this\
  \ Year’s storylines will feature three distinct arcs instead of one long metaplot.\
  \ They do not follow the traditional multi-part scenario format in that you can\
  \ play them in any order. You can find each scenario in an arc by looking for their\
  \ series titles such as Frozen Ambitions or The Vast Experiment!</p> \n      <p>We\
  \ hope you enjoy these scenarios and the series of adventures they kick off! Check\
  \ back this afternoon for more Paizo Organized Play information!</p> \n      <p>Until\
  \ next time,</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Thurston\
