  alt: "A banner with three columns of images and text. The first column is a ghostly\
    \ woman screaming angrily, under her image is text that says: Ghastly Gauntlight,\
    \ The very dungeon of Gauntlight Keep itself, holds great magic power, adding\
    \ new dangers and the potential for greatness. The second column is of a dusty\
    \ blue book with white scribbles on the cover and loose papers shoved between\
    \ the pages, under the book reads: Mysterious Magic Items. 16 new magic items\
    \ to liberate from Belcorra's keep. The third column is an image of a large worm-like\
    \ creature with dozens of short insect legs and two tails, each holding a sharp\
    \ weapon. Under the creature says, Haunting Horrors, over 90 monsters through\
    \ 10 levels of megadungeon!"
