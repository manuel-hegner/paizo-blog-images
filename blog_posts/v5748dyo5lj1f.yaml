  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Gen Con 2016 is in the books (and Delta's computer\
  \ failure gave me and many other Paizonians a lovely bonus day or two in the fabulous\
  \ airport waiting areas of Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Minneapolis-St.\
  \ Paul, and/or Salt Lake City) and what a show it was! Demos of the upcoming <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9mbg\"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> were a huge hit\
  \ in the exhibit hall, with 10 tables of action running basically at capacity for\
  \ four straight days. Many thanks to Dominick Trascritti and his skilled demo team\
  \ for giving fans old and new an excellent introduction to Mummy's Mask.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Action in the Sagamore Ballroom was also hopping, with the <a href=\"/pfsacg\"\
  >Adventure Card Guild</a> area serving up more tables of Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild play than ever before. We showcased the epic final adventures of Season\
  \ of the Runelords. We debuted the insane Season of the Goblins, written by Tyler\
  \ Beck, David Jacobson, and Keith Richmond... and let's just say that people were\
  \ not expecting to eat that many slugs. (For those of you who didn't make it to\
  \ Gen Con, these adventures will be available for sale soon!)</p> \n    <p>We debuted\
  \ a multimodal special event, <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbe\"><em>The Cosmic Captive</em></a>,\
  \ mixing RPG and ACG tables to great effect. We got a ton of great feedback on how\
  \ to improve the ACG side of future such events, so thank you all for being our\
  \ guinea pigs on that. Venture-Lieutenant Kevin Hanley and his phenomenal volunteer\
  \ staff did a spectacular job marshaling and managing the area, as well as the trial\
  \ by fire that was running multiple tables simultaneously. (The Cosmic Captive will\
  \ be available exclusively to conventions for the next year.) It was a privilege\
  \ and a pleasure to work with so many enthusiastic and talented Pathfinder Society\
  \ folk this year. (To my Special GMs: <i>JUMP</i>!)</p> \n    <p>We also brought\
  \ back the ACG Open for a second year, to the delight and chagrin of dedicated players.\
  \ This year's tournament, \"The Cayden Cailean Way,\" took 64 players through a\
  \ variety of tests in honor of the Lucky Drunk. In case you need to be terrified,\
  \ this year's event had rounds written by Chad Brown, Keith Richmond, and Mike Selinker,\
  \ with a little synthesis done by yours truly. The final round featured last year's\
  \ runner-up team, Level 5, against an upstart team of pick-up players called Team\
  \ One. Both teams completed the final scenario within one minute of each other,\
  \ but Team One won the day with a higher overall score. Level 5, I am rooting for\
  \ you to level up next year!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \  <p>This year's Gen Con (my nineteenth, yipes!) was bittersweet for me, because\
  \ it marked an ending and a beginning for me. I'm starting a new adventure this\
  \ fall: nursing school. Unfortunately, the demands of school and the demands of\
  \ ACG players are a little too much to handle at once, so I'm bidding farewell to\
  \ Paizo's hallowed halls. I leave the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game in the capable\
  \ hands of Vic and the Sharks, and the Adventure Card Guild in the capable hands\
  \ of Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge. Being a member of the ACG and Pathfinder\
  \ Society teams has been a joy, and I couldn't ask for better stewards.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Thank you all for allowing me to strain your brains and add fun to your days\
  \ with the Class Decks and the Adventure Card Guild. I've really enjoyed doing it,\
  \ and I look forward to playing with you all at a convention soon. Onward to adventure!</p>\
