  \ Clark Peterson, Neil Spicer, and I work our way through the last wondrous item\
  \ submissions for RPG Superstar, I've come to realize two things. One, magic item\
  \ stat blocks convey a lot of information, and two, many people don't understand\
  \ what goes into a magic item stat block. In this blog, I'll dissect a magic item\
  \ stat block and explain what goes where, and why.</p> \n   <p><b>Item Name:</b>\
  \ This section is self-evident. The magic item name header in the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i></a> looks like this is in all caps, but it's\
  \ just a text style—don't type yours in all caps!</p> \n   <p><b>Aura:</b> This\
  \ section exists so the GM can quickly tell a player what schools of magic the item\
  \ uses. This is noteworthy only if the PC fails the Spellcraft check to identify\
  \ the item and needs an idea of what it may do. Auras are always written as \"faint,\"\
  \ \"moderate,\" or \"strong,\" plus the appropriate school or schools, and perhaps\
  \ a subschool if relevant.</p> \n   <p><b>CL:</b> The caster level tells you what\
  \ caster level the item operates at. This means you don't have to specify a caster\
  \ level in the item's description—if you find an orb that can create a fireball,\
  \ it doesn't need to say \"fireball (10d6).\" Unless otherwise specified, the item\
  \ uses this caster level for all of its abilities. The caster level should include\
  \ the ordinal abbreviation for that number: \"CL 1st\" instead of just \"CL 1,\"\
  \ \"CL 2nd\" instead of just \"CL 2,\" and so on.</p> \n   <p><b>Slot:</b> This\
  \ slot tells you which of the magic item \"body slots\" the item uses (<i>Core Rulebook</i>\
  \ 459). If you have to hold the item in your hand (like a rod of wonder) or if it\
  \ doesn't use a slot at all (like an <i>ioun stone</i>), it's listed slot is \"\
  none.\" (Paizo used to put a dash there for slotless items but no longer does it\
  \ that way.)</p> \n   <p><b>Price:</b> This is the item's market price—how much\
  \ you'd pay for it if you bought it from an NPC. This is never expressed as a fraction\
  \ or decimal; \"12 gp, 5 sp\" is correct, \"12.5 gp\" is not, nor is \"12 1/2 gp.\"\
  \ If the item costs more than 999 gp, put a comma in to separate the thousands (\"\
  20,000 gp\" instead of \"20000 gp\" or \"20.000 gp\"). If your item costs more than\
  \ 200,000 gp, it's probably an artifact rather than a regular magic item. If the\
  \ item has several types (like a <i>figurine of wondrous power</i>) with different\
  \ costs, each is listed here, separated by commas.</p> \n   <p><b>Weight:</b> This\
  \ is how much the item weighs, in pounds (abbreviated \"lb.\" for 1 pound or less\
  \ and \"lbs.\" for 2 or more pounds). Most common items in the game have a specific\
  \ weight, just for consistency. For example, boots weigh 1 lb., so players don't\
  \ have to remember different boot weights. Some light items, like gems, headbands,\
  \ and rings, have a standard weight of \"—,\" which means individually their weight\
  \ isn't important (though the GM can rule that a chest full of them has weight).\
  \ When in doubt, find a similar item in the <i>Core Rulebook</i> and use the listed\
  \ weight.</p> \n   <p><b>Description (Header):</b> This is a text format we call\
  \ a \"breaker\"—the all caps and lines above and below the text are just an applied\
  \ style. Like the title, don't type this line in all caps, and don't add underlining.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Description (Paragraph):</b> The paragraph description of a magic item\
  \ should say (1) what it looks like, (2) what the item does, and (3) how often you\
  \ can use the item.</p> \n   <p>Normally, using a magic item is a standard action.\
  \ You shouldn't give an item a shorter activation time than that because it messes\
  \ with the \"action economy\" of the combat round—a player who tries to create a\
  \ faster item is trying to do more than one magical thing per round.</p> \n   <p>Whether\
  \ or not using an item provokes an attack of opportunity is built into how it's\
  \ activated (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 458). This means for command word items you don't\
  \ need to say that it's a standard action to activate and that it doesn't provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity—that's assumed for all command word items. In fact, the\
  \ assumption is if an item doesn't say how you activate it, it's a command word\
  \ item.</p> \n   <p>Magic items that have effects requiring saving throws should\
  \ include those saves in the item description. If it's duplicating a spell, the\
  \ default save DC is the minimum for casting that spell: 10 + 1.5 x the spell's\
  \ level.</p> \n   <p>If you refer to specific spells, italicize them, like <i>fireball</i>\
  \ or <i>pearl of power</i>. If you refer to feats or skill names, capitalize them,\
  \ like Power Attack, Weapon Focus (longsword), Perception, or Knowledge (local).\
  \ There's very little else in the game that always requires capitalization—you don't\
  \ capitalize class names (cleric), race names (dwarf), combat maneuvers (grapple,\
  \ trip), or other specific rules (breath weapon, drowning, trample, poison).</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Construction (Header):</b> Like the Description header, this is not\
  \ all caps and not manually underlined.</p> \n   <p><b>Requirements:</b> This section\
  \ is all the stuff a character needs to create the item using an item-crafting feat.\
  \ List the crafting feat first (capitalized), followed by spell names (italicized),\
  \ followed by any other requirements such as needing ranks in a skill (capitalized)\
  \ or an ability like channel energy.</p> \n   <p><b>Cost:</b> This is the item's\
  \ sale cost—how much a PC could get for selling it to an NPC. This is always half\
  \ the item's Price (with the exception of magic weapons, magic armor, and items\
  \ with expensive material components or foci, because the extra cost is factored\
  \ in differently). If your item's Cost isn't half its Price, you've done it wrong.\
  \ All rules for the Price apply to the Cost (no decimals, no fractions, separate\
  \ variants with commas).</p> \n   <p>Phew! That's a whole lot of nitpicking, but\
  \ it can make the difference between a professional-looking item and an amateur-looking\
  \ one, and between a reasonable item and an overpowered item.</p> \n   <p>Sean K\
