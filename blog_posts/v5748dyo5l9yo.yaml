  \ Water!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, August 4, 2008</p> \n   <p>So the waters\
  \ of Riddleport harbor are alive with things that find people delicious. A pirate\
  \ or smuggler who falls overboard generally has only a few minutes to get to shore\
  \ or clamber back on board a ship before a shark, bunyip, reefclaw, or other predator\
  \ catches his scent. In some cases, though, those hungry predators don't wait until\
  \ someone falls into the waterâ€”they can flop ashore to hunt for food if necessary.\
  \ One notorious local predator with this unnerving habit is the swamp barracuda.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Of course, the swamp barracudas have long been a menace along the shores\
  \ of the Varisian Gulf, and the local Sczarni families in particular have a unique\
  \ working history with these beasts. Take the following as an example as to why\
  \ it's generally a bad idea to annoy these criminals.</p> \n   <p><b>The Fish Tank</b>:\
  \ Owned by Jaster Frallino, the head of the Magnimarian Sczarni gang known as the\
  \ Gallowed, images of glassy-eyed sea serpents and scandalously clad mermaids stare\
  \ stupidly from the timbers of this peeling sea-blue caravan wagon. Within, the\
  \ roomy wagon holds a single battered stool and a four-foot-tall glass aquarium\
  \ filled with murky water. Inside the glass tank laze Frallino's three fat pet swamp\
  \ barracudas: Verna, Argarno, and Big Mal. In Frallino's displeasure, several lazy\
  \ thugs and untrustworthy business partners have lost a toe, a nose, or a whole\
  \ hand to \"The Boss's Fish,\" and more than one of the crime lord's enemies have\
  \ gone into the tank headfirst. It's also rumored that the Sczarni boss keeps a\
  \ collection of mysterious, rusted keys at the bottom of his chummy aquarium, guarded\
  \ by his beloved pets.</p> \n   <p>The swamp barracuda is one of four new monsters\
  \ presented in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84em\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #13's Bestiary</a>.</p>\
