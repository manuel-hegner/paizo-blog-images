  \      <h1>Character Creation Basics</h1>\n      <p>In general, you’ll follow the\
  \ rules as outlined in the <em>Starfinder Player Core</em> to create a player character\
  \ (PC) in Starfinder Society. For a preview of these rules, check out the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Core</em>. The following steps will augment these character creation rules:</p>\n\
  \      <ul>\n       <li>When creating your character concept, remember that you\
  \ are a member of the Starfinder Society. They must be able to work with any other\
  \ Starfinder and abide by the Society’s motto: “Explore, Report, Cooperate.”</li>\n\
  \       <li>Characters may use any ancestry, heritage, background, and class from\
  \ the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em> or <em>Starfinder Player Core</em>. \n  \
  \      <ul>\n         <li>Players who participated in the Starfinder Playtest will\
  \ have access to exclusive backgrounds based on these adventures. Additionally,\
  \ all Starfinders will have access to campaign-specific backgrounds in addition\
  \ to those found in hardcover material.</li>\n        </ul></li>\n       <li>Characters\
  \ must be adults for their ancestry, and cannot be sanctified to unholy.</li>\n\
  \      </ul>\n      <br>\n      <h1>Starting at Higher Levels</h1>\n      <p>In\
  \ Starfinder Society (second edition), characters may be created at 1st-, 3rd-,\
  \ 5th- or 7th-level. While we encourage all players to start their first character\
  \ at 1st-level to help them learn the system, we believe this flexibility will allow\
  \ for greater ease of scheduling across the board. Characters who participate in\
  \ an entire plotline from the very start will also find that later scenarios will\
  \ reward having participated in earlier adventures.</p>\n      <p>Pregenerated characters\
  \ will be available at 1st-, 3rd-, and 5th-level, though we want to caution you\
  \ all that 5th-level content won’t appear until close to the end of our first season\
  \ of play.</p>\n      <p>When creating a character at a higher level, you may select\
  \ starting equipment using either the lump sum or permanent items as found in the\
  \ Character Wealth table (<em>Starfinder GM Core </em>59).</p>\n      <br>\n   \
  \   <h1>Level Cap</h1>\n      <p>We do not intend to publish adventures for characters\
  \ above 10th level. As scenarios get into higher level ranges, we see diminishing\
  \ table counts. These high-level adventures are also significantly more involved\
  \ to design and develop. We’re announcing this cap now to set expectations and to\
  \ ensure you’re all aware of our plans from the start. We’d hate for you to create\
  \ a character whose build comes online late in the game, only to find out that you\
  \ won’t have a chance to play them in the campaign.</p>\n      <p>Those who are\
  \ interested in play above 10th-level should look to our other published Adventure\
  \ Paths and Adventure content. Organized Play is a great way to find other players\
  \ you enjoy gaming with for these additional experiences!</p>\n      <br clear=\"\

  \ Options</h1>\n      <p>Our plan, with a handful of exceptions, is to make as much\
  \ of our published Starfinder content available to all Starfinder characters without\
  \ purchasing boons or completing certain adventures. This means that at launch all\
  \ ancestries, classes, and other options in the <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy Guide</em>,\
  \ <em>Starfinder</em><em>Player Core</em>, and <em>Starfinder</em><em>GM Core</em>\
  \ will be available for all characters, and future products will see similarly permissive\
  \ access. Starfinder Society will not use variant rules such as Free Archetype or\
  \ Automatic Bonus Progression.</p>\n      <p>Additionally, players will be permitted\
  \ to use the technomancer and mechanic classes from the Tech Playtest until their\
  \ release in a future hardcover book! We will have full guidelines for converting\
  \ your character once we get closer, but expect that any technomancers or mechanics\
  \ will be required to rebuild into the final rules once they are released.</p>\n\
  \      <p>We want you to purchase a Paizo product and be able to use that content\
  \ immediately, without restriction. One of the core appeals of Starfinder is the\
  \ cantina of alien options available, and we believe that’s a key component of our\
  \ Organized Play program as well.</p>\n      <p>With that in mind, what might Achievement\
  \ Points be used for? And what other rewards might scenarios unlock? Join us next\
  \ week for more on adventure rewards and other program elements!</p>\n      <p>Follow\
