  \ itemprop=\"description\">Here at Paizo, the end of convention season can seem\
  \ like a holiday, enough so that it calls for a new holiday blog. The anniversary\
  \ of Iomedae's successful venture into the Starstone Cathedral was only yesterday,\
  \ and given the goddess's key role in the Mendevian Crusade that is so central both\
  \ to Pathfinder Society Organized Play's Year of the Demon and the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>, it seems particularly appropriate to\
  \ honor the Inheritor today.</span></p> \n     <p>Below, you will find a special\
  \ Chronicle sheet that you can download and apply to a Pathfinder Society character.\
  \ Iomedae's Ascendance Day is mentioned on page 249 of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ief\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide</i></a> as well as page\
  \ 70 of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy89vw\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path\
  \ #26</i></a>.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>To many, the Test of the Starstone\
  \ represents the greatest of all challenges, yet for Iomedae it was one of three\
  \ storied promotions in her rise from Aroden's herald to a goddess in her own right.\
  \ On the 6th of Lamashan, the Inheritor's faithful observe the heroism of Iomedae's\
  \ life before her moment of ascension and celebrate the anniversary of the apotheosis\
  \ itself.</p> \n      <p>The celebration takes place in several stages. Early in\
  \ the day, troupes of performers—as often passionate amateurs as professionals—\
  stage morality plays featuring the Eleven Acts of Iomedae, the heroic near-miracles\
  \ and sacrifices she made leading up to her trials in the Starstone Cathedral. Scripts\
  \ vary by region, city, and even neighborhood, but despite differences in setting,\
  \ performance medium, and word choice, the themes and morals are all the same.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>As the day continues, the priests organize jousts and mock battles,\
  \ allowing anyone to participate so long as she can demonstrate enough skill to\
  \ not be a risk to herself or others. The winners of these contests then face tests\
  \ of mental acuity such as solving riddles, deciphering philosophical quandaries,\
  \ and answering questions of honor and justice. Those who prove themselves in both\
  \ contests are awarded a white cloak—representing the Inheritor at peace—styled\
  \ after Iomedae's own red garment to wear for the rest of the celebration. Feasting\
  \ and singing follow the competitions, mirroring the jubilation that followed Iomedae's\
  \ ascension. This is occasion for making pledges of friendship and forgiving enemies,\
  \ and priests circulate about the crowd offering the Inheritor's blessing to those\
  \ who do and providing a moment's counsel or mediation for those who need an extra\
  \ nudge.</p> \n      <p>The celebration typically ends before midnight, and the\
  \ following day the priests and previous day's champions gather up the blunted swords\
  \ from the mock battles, sharpen them, and distribute them among the church's armory\
  \ and those of like-minded organizations so that all may remain vigilant against\
  \ evil and prepared to strike it down.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p align=\"\
