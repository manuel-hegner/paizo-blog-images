  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Druids are practitioners of primal magic, which\
  \ blends vital essence (the essence of life, instinct, and faith) with material\
  \ essence (the essence of matter and the natural world). Thus, primal traditions\
  \ are rooted in an instinctual connection with and faith in the surrounding world:\
  \ the cycle of day and night, the turning of the seasons, and the natural selection\
  \ of predator and prey. Druids are the iconic primal spellcasters; they call upon\
  \ the power of nature for magic through their deep faith, as opposed to primal sorcerers,\
  \ who harness the power of fey or other natural creatures that flows through their\
  \ blood to access the same sorts of primal energies.</p> \n    <p>Since this is\
  \ the last class, before we go deeper into the druid's mechanics, I want to show\
  \ you some extra pieces each class has that you might not know about. Every class\
  \ entry starts with some bullet points to help you get a feel for what playing the\
  \ class might be like.</p> \n    <h2>Playing a Druid</h2> \n    <p>Players of druid\
  \ characters might approach gameplay in the following ways:</p> \n    <ul> \n  \
  \   <li>During combat, you call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies\
  \ and protect your allies. You can cast spells drawing upon primal magic to summon\
  \ deadly animals to fight at your side, grant resilience to you and your friends,\
  \ or heal their wounds. Depending on your bond to nature, you might also call upon\
  \ powerful elemental magic or even change shape into a terrifying beast to fight\
  \ with tooth and claw.</li> \n     <li>During social encounters, you represent balance\
  \ and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions that not only are best\
  \ for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live in harmony\
  \ and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they\
  \ truly need, even if they can't have all that they desire.</li> \n     <li>In exploration\
  \ mode, your skills in nature are invaluable. You can track down enemies, navigate\
  \ through the wilderness, or use your spells to detect any magical auras around\
  \ you. You might even ask wild animals to assist your group in your travels with\
  \ their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities.</li> \n     <li>In downtime\
  \ mode, you might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature\
  \ might lead you to tend to an area of the wild, befriending its beasts and healing\
  \ the wounds caused by civilization. You might even attempt to teach people sustainable\
  \ techniques that allow them to subsist off the land without harming the natural\
  \ balance.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <h2>Roleplaying a Druid</h2> \n    <p>Druids are\
  \ the living embodiment of nature, acting as its agent; you protect the wild places\
  \ from harm and speak for their interests in more civilized lands.</p> \n    <h3>If\
  \ You're a Druid, You Likely...</h3> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Have a deep and meaningful\
  \ respect for the power of nature.</li> \n     <li>Are in constant awe of the natural\
  \ world, eager to share it with others but cautious of their influence.</li> \n\
  \     <li>Treat plants and animals as allies in your quest, working with them toward\
  \ your goals.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <h3>Others Probably...</h3> \n    <ul> \n \
  \    <li>View you as a representative of nature, and might even assume you can control\
  \ it.</li> \n     <li>Assume you're a recluse who avoids society and cities, preferring\
  \ to live in the wild.</li> \n     <li>Treat you as a mystic, similar to a priest,\
  \ but answering only to the forces of nature.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Spellcasting</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Druids are full prepared spellcasters, able to cast the same number of\
  \ spells per day as the cleric and bard, rather than gaining extra spells through\
  \ bloodlines or schools as the sorcerer and wizard do. However, just as the cleric\
  \ has channel energy and the bard has compositions, the druid has more than enough\
  \ tricks up her sleeve to make her a primal powerhouse. And figuring those out starts\
  \ with...</p> \n    <h2>Orders</h2> \n    <p>As the druid's initial architect, Jason\
  \ pulled the concept of orders from the sidelines of lore directly into the spotlight,\
  \ making your choice of order a major part of your druid. As with the bard's muse,\
  \ you can choose abilities that belong to another order, but unlike for the bard,\
  \ you gain extra benefits from feats and abilities that belong to your own order,\
  \ incentivizing you to check out your own order's feats first. An order member gains\
  \ a new skill and an order power that druids of other orders can't gain, and each\
  \ order adds its own component to the basic druid anathema forbidding actions like\
  \ despoiling nature. The four orders presented in the playtest are animal, leaf,\
  \ storm, and wild, though more orders are all but certain to arise.</p> \n    <h3>Animal</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>An animal druid (known by names like druid of the claw or druid of the\
  \ wing depending on her preferred animal) has a strong connection to animals. She\
  \ is trained in Athletics, which is a signature skill for her. She also gains the\
  \ <i>heal animal</i> order power (exclusive to that members of order) and the Animal\
  \ Companion feat. Committing wanton cruelty to animals or killing them unnecessarily\
  \ is anathema to her. (This doesn't prevent her from defending herself against animals\
  \ or killing them cleanly for food.)</p> \n    <p>This is the order that's all about\
  \ having the coolest animal companion. Other druids can easily get an animal companion\
  \ (and they're a solid choice for all druids) and take the same upgrade feats, but\
  \ with each feat, the animal order druid will get something cool or extra for the\
  \ animal. As an example, an animal druid's companion can have multiple specializations,\
  \ which are like animal companion archetypes, if the animal druid commits more to\
  \ this path.</p> \n    <h3>Leaf</h3> \n    <p>A druid of the leaf reveres plants\
  \ and the bounty of nature, acting as a caretaker and warden for the wilderness,\
  \ teaching sustainable techniques, and helping areas regrow after disasters or negligent\
  \ humanoid expansion. She is trained in Diplomacy, which is a signature skill for\
  \ her. She also gains the Leshy Familiar druid feat and the <i>goodberry</i> order\
  \ power (exclusive to that members of order). Committing wanton cruelty to plants\
  \ or killing plants unnecessarily is anathema to her. (This doesn't prevent her\
  \ from defending herself against plants or harvesting them if necessary for survival.)</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This style of druid is all about plants, with options including Verdant\
  \ Metamorphosis, where you flat-out become a plant, and the druid of the leaf's\
  \ leshy familiar, which has more powers than a typical familiar. Let's check out\
  \ Verdant Metamorphosis to see a special benefit only druids of the leaf receive:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Verdant Metamorphosis\
  \ <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 18</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Druid</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Leaf Order</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >You transform into a plant version of yourself. You gain the plant trait and lose\
  \ any trait that's inappropriate for your new form (typically humanoid). You can\
  \ change from a form that looks mostly like your old self into a tree or any other\
  \ non-creature plant as an action (this action has the concentrate trait). Perception\
  \ checks don't reveal your true form, but a creature can attempt a Nature or Survival\
  \ check against your class DC to determine that the plant is new to the surrounding\
  \ area. While in this form, you can observe everything around you, but you can't\
  \ act other than to spend an action (this action has the concentrate trait) to change\
  \ back, which ends your turn. In this form, your AC is 30, your TAC is 20, only\
  \ conditional bonuses, conditional penalties, and circumstance bonuses and penalties\
  \ can affect you, and you treat all successes and critical successes on Reflex saves\
  \ as failures.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b> If you are a\
  \ druid of the leaf order, if you transform into a non-creature plant and take your\
  \ daily rest during daylight hours, the rest restores you to maximum Hit Points\
  \ and removes all non-permanent drained, enfeebled, sluggish, and stupefied conditions.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <h3>Storm</h3> \n    <p>A druid of the storm carries\
  \ nature's fury within her, channeling it to terrifying effect and riding the winds\
  \ and storms. She is trained in Acrobatics, which is a signature skill for her.\
  \ She also gains the Storm Born druid feat and the <i>tempest surge</i> order power\
  \ (exclusive to that members of order). Creating unnatural weather patterns that\
  \ could be damaging to the local environment (such as by using a 9th-level <i>control\
  \ weather</i> ritual) is anathema to her.</p> \n    <p>In addition to healing magic,\
  \ the primal list contains powerful energy blasts, including <i>fireball </i>and\
  \ other spells newly available to druids. Armed with this magic, druids of the storm\
  \ are elemental dynamos who focus on the power of the tempest, flying around in\
  \ storms and ignoring penalties from weather. Notably, their <i>tempest surge </i>order\
  \ power is an extremely good blast for a 1 Spell Point power, particularly after\
  \ if they take a feat that ups the d10s to d12s. Let's take a look, since you'll\
  \ be slinging it around a bunch of times each day.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Tempest Surge <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Power\
  \ 1</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Air</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Electricity</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Evocation</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Casting </b>[[A]] Somatic Casting, [[A]] Verbal Casting</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Range</b> 30 feet;<b> Targets</b> one creature</p>\
  \ \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You surround\
  \ a foe in a swirling storm of violent winds, roiling clouds, and crackling lightning.\
  \ The storm deals 1d10 electricity damage to the target, depending on their Reflex\
  \ saving throw.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Success</b> Half damage.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Critical Success</b> No damage.</p> \n   \
  \  <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Failure</b> Full damage, and the target is sluggish\
  \ 1 for 1 round.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Critical Failure</b> Double\
  \ damage, and the target is sluggish 2 for 1 round.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Heightened (+1)</b> The damage increases by 1d10.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>After increasing the damage to d12s, the damage scales at the same rate\
  \ as <i>lightning bolt</i>. But it doesn't just deal damage! The sluggish condition\
  \ penalizes AC, attack rolls, and Reflex saves, so taking double damage on the critical\
  \ failure is just the beginning of the horrible pain. When we were playtesting,\
  \ every creature that critically failed against <i>tempest surge </i>was in for\
  \ a very bad round.</p> \n    <h3>Wild</h3> \n    <p>The savage, uncontrollable\
  \ call of the natural world infuses a druid of the wild, granting her the ability\
  \ to change her shape into the ferocious form of a wild creature. She is trained\
  \ in Intimidation, which becomes a signature skill for her. She also gains the Wild\
  \ Shape druid feat and the <i>wild claws</i> order power (exclusive to that members\
  \ of order). Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations of civilization is anathema\
  \ to her. (This doesn't prevent her from buying and using processed goods or staying\
  \ in a city for an adventure, but she can never come to rely on these conveniences\
  \ or truly call such a place her permanent home.)</p> \n    <p>Notice the wild order\
  \ druid starts with Wild Shape? Any druid with Wild Shape feats gets a free extra\
  \ casting of certain polymorph spells, heightened to her highest possible level,\
  \ eventually rising up to two free castings if the druid takes enough Wild Shape\
  \ feats. But the thing that makes a wild order druid particularly different is that,\
  \ in addition to these, she gains a number of additional bonus castings of these\
  \ spells equal to her Strength modifier (if it's more than 1). That means a druid\
  \ of the wild tends towards higher Strength than a typical member of other orders.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Druid Features</h2> \n    <p>Aside from an order, you gain spellcasting\
  \ and primal spell proficiency at the same levels as all the other spellcasters,\
  \ new spell levels at every odd level save 19th, expert proficiency in primal spells\
  \ at 12th level, master proficiency at 16th level, and legendary proficiency at\
  \ 19th level. You also get the secret Druidic language (don't teach it to nondruids—\
  that's anathema!) and wild empathy, which lets you use Diplomacy to Make a Request\
  \ of animals, and possibly of plants if you're a leaf order aficionado.</p> \n \
  \   <h2>Druid Feats</h2> \n    <p>I covered many feats that connect to orders, but\
  \ many feats aren't affiliated, like this powerhouse:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">[[F]] Leyline Conduit <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Feat 20</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Druid</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Metamagic</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Frequency</b> once\
  \ per minute</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Trigger</b> You start to cast\
  \ a spell of 5th level or lower that has no duration and a maximum of 2 spellcasting\
  \ actions.</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >You add a Somatic Casting action to the casting of the triggering spell, and you\
  \ don't expend the prepared spell as you cast it.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   \
  \ <p>This means every minute, you can cast a 5th level or lower spell without expending\
  \ it. That's really useful! There are some interesting effects of how Jason designed\
  \ this feat, though, that make it more than just a simple repetition, particularly\
  \ the fact that you can use Leyline Conduit only if you were already able to cast\
  \ the spell, meaning you had to prepare it and then avoid using it up by casting\
  \ it without Leyline Conduit. So the feat gives you somewhat limitless uses of the\
  \ spell, but if you really need to cast it again before the minute is up, while\
  \ Leyline Conduit is unavailable, you'll expend the spell for real (at least for\
  \ the rest of the day).</p> \n    <h2>Animal Companions</h2> \n    <p>Before I go,\
  \ let's talk about animal companions. While Jason was deep in preliminary design\
  \ of the druid, he bestowed upon me a strange primal chart of flowing options, almost\
  \ in Druidic itself, and explained it to me. This chart combined all the best aspects\
  \ of the 4th- and 7th-level animal companion advancements with animal companion\
  \ archetypes and new unique features for each different animal, all while moving\
  \ away from having to make tons of basic feat selections for the companion. What\
  \ I built from that chart was the first draft of the animal companion system in\
  \ the playtest. Let's show off the companion most often overlooked in Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition, the noble bear. The bear has generated a plethora of threads dedicated\
  \ to how neglected it is, so let's see how the playtest handles it.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Bear</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Your companion is a grizzly, panda, polar bear, or other type of bear.</p> \n \
  \    <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Size</b> Small</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>[[A]] Unarmed</b><b>Strikes</b> jaws, <b>Damage</b> 1d8 piercing;</p> \n   \
  \  <p class=\"stat-block-1\">claw (agile), <b>Damage</b> 1d6 slashing</p> \n   \
  \  <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Abilities</b> Str, Con</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Hit Points</b> 8</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Skill</b> Intimidation</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Senses</b> scent</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Speed</b> 35 feet</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Work Together Benefit</b>\
  \ Your bear mauls your enemies when you create an opening. Until your next turn,\
  \ all your weapon Strikes against a creature your bear threatens deal 1d8 additional\
  \ slashing damage. If your bear has a specialization, the additional slashing damage\
  \ increases to 2d8.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Advanced Maneuver</b>\
  \ Bear Hug</p> \n     <p></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">[[A]]Bear Hug</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Requirements </b>Your last action was a successful\
  \ claw Strike.</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Make another claw Strike against the same target. If your Strike hits, the target\
  \ is also grabbed, as if you had succeeded at the Grapple action.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>The bear starts out Small. Don't worry—when it grows up, it can eventually\
  \ become a Large bear (in the first book, too; there's no need to wait). The bear's\
  \ boost in Strength and d8 damage die for its jaws make it the most directly damaging\
  \ companion, tied with the snake, which it edges out in terms of Constitution, Hit\
  \ Points, and land Speed. (The snake, for its part, has better AC and lots of special\
  \ Speeds.) The Work Together benefit is something you can have the bear do instead\
  \ of attack, and it again deals the most direct damage, adding 1d8 (later 2d8) to\
  \ the damage of your weapon Strikes. The bear is a great companion for someone who\
  \ plans, much like the bear itself, to wade into the thick of the fight. Finally,\
  \ the bear can eventually learn the Bear Hug advanced maneuver. This maneuver essentially\
  \ means that if the bear hits twice in a row, it gets a free automatic grapple.\
  \ Handy for keeping foes in place!</p> \n    <p>So that about wraps up the druid.\
  \ If you were a druid, which of the four orders would you be?</p> \n    <p>Mark\
