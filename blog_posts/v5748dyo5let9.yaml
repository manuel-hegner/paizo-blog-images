  \ the sun high in the sky here in Seattle, it must mean that summer is just around\
  \ the corner. And summer means the release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6?Pathfinder-Battles-Skull-Shackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted fantasy miniatures!\
  \ This week I'd like to show off three more monsters coming your way this August!</span></p>\

  ><img border=\"0\" src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130524-GoldenGuardian_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have a figure long requested by miniatures fiends,\
  \ albeit under a slightly new name. We call this six-legged critter a Golden Guardian,\
  \ and he'd love to spend some time chewing on your coins or guarding your treasure\
  \ hoard. Just make sure to keep it away from his huge mouth. The Golden Guardian\
  \ (which, I should point out, James Jacobs saved me from naming the Gold Digger)\
  \ is a Small figure at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130524-Jakaw.jpg\"><img border=\"\

  \ \n    <p>One of the great things about publishing a pirate campaign set in a fantasy\
  \ world is that it gives us the opportunity to create interesting nonhuman pirates.\
  \ Here we have one of my absolute favorites from the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Adventure Path</a>, the tengu pirate Jakaw Razorbeak. This Medium figure is slated\
  \ at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130524-Duppy.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130524-Duppy_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week is one of the set's weirder miniatures,\
  \ an undead creature known as a Duppy. This creature comes from the monster appendix\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8qzx?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Isles-of-the-Shackles\"\
  >Isles of the Shackles</a> sourcebook, and also appears in the Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ campaign itself. A Duppy is the spirit of a cruel sailor who died on land away\
  \ from his ship, and thus was unable to receive a proper burial at sea. Duppies\
  \ have control over spectral dogs, which we see sculpted into the base on the figure\
  \ itself. WizKids did some amazing work with clear plastic on this figure, and I\
  \ think it looks like the most incorporeal beastie we've created for Pathfinder\
  \ Battles so far. The Duppy easily proxies for any kind of spooky undead ghost-like\
  \ villain. It is a rare figure.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week, my faithful\
  \ scallywags! Check back next week for another exciting look at the Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles set!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n \
