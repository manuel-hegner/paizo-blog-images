  \ Appendix – Sean K Reynolds (Part 1)</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 10,\
  \ 2009</p> \n   <p>Sean K Reynolds: Developer, diehard miniatures painter, and resident\
  \ \"gods guy\" of the Paizo offices. Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with\
  \ both Sean and Managing Editor F. Wesley Schneider about the sources of inspiration\
  \ they would include in Paizo's own Appendix N. Switching things up a bit, this\
  \ week we've got Part 1 of Sean's interview, with more from Wes next week. As would\
  \ be expected from a game designer who worked at TSR during the era of 2nd edition,\
  \ Sean's influences stretch back to the earliest roots of the hobby.</p> \n   <p><b>David</b>:\
  \ I understand that you are pretty well known as the go-to guy when it comes to\
  \ writing about the deities of <i>Greyhawk</i>, the <i>Forgotten Realms</i>, and\
  \ Golarion. What sparked this interest?</p> \n   <p><b>Sean</b>: I got into D&amp;D\
  \ by playing the basic boxed set with my Dad and then later with my cousin. What\
  \ really got me hooked was when, at the library, I picked up a book of Greek mythology,\
  \ <i>D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths</i>, which talked about the gods, the births\
  \ and deaths of heroes, and how the gods made the greatest heroes into constellations.\
  \ Reading this, I realized that these characters—even the gods—had personalities\
  \ and agendas, just like actual people. Later, I got a similar book about Norse\
  \ mythology, <i>D'Aulaire's Norse Gods &amp; Giants</i> (now retitled as <i>D'Aulaire's\
  \ Book of Norse Myths</i>), which was even better than the Greeks' because they\
  \ all wore heavy armor, the gods themselves fought the crazy monsters, and they\
  \ even had a prophecy about the end of the world. This is probably how I became\
  \ the \"gods guy\" of D&amp;D, because these books laid the foundation for my interest\
  \ in the apocalypse and the gods.</p> \n   <p>I remember playing in Monte Cook's\
  \ <i>Praemal</i> campaign—the precursor to <i>Ptolus</i>—where the characters were\
  \ the 3rd generation of humans to be on the planet, still dealing with the very\
  \ real influence of the gods and the forces of creation. We even found gigantic\
  \ handprints in the walls of a canyon from a battle between the gods. I found the\
  \ combination of creation and destruction very appealing.</p> \n   <p><b>David</b>:\
  \ You started full-time in the RPG industry with <i>Greyhawk</i>, correct?</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Sean:</b>Right. My first <i>Greyhawk</i> sourcebook was about <i>The Scarlet\
  \ Brotherhood</i>, who had always been very mysterious even from the days when Gary\
  \ Gygax was doing all the writing for the published setting. My sourcebook was the\
  \ first time anyone had really talked in depth about their society from their perspective.\
  \ I worked with Erik on the project. One of the daunting but fun things about it\
  \ was that there was an entire continent—Hepmonaland—that was entirely unexplored\
  \ in game books; it was barely visible on the Oerth map and nobody really knew what\
  \ was going on there. Erik and I were both familiar with really old adventures like\
  \ <i>The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan</i>, so we knew that there were Aztec-like people\
  \ running around. We pieced together little bits of information and then had to\
  \ make it our own. That was part of the product design philosophy at the time: we'd\
  \ publish the basics for your campaign and give you a lot of room to create your\
  \ own material, fill in the blanks, and make connections between various plot hooks.\
  \ This was very different from my later work on the <i>Forgotten Realms</i>, because\
  \ books for that line are more about giving people everything they need to run a\
  \ campaign without having build up anything on their own.</p> \n   <br> \n   <p>This\
  \ concludes Part 1 of my interview with Sean K Reynolds. Tune in next time for his\
  \ comparison of Golarion's gods with the deities of <i>Greyhawk</i> and the <i>Forgotten\
  \ Realms</i>, and his list of some of the works that most influenced his game design.</p>\
