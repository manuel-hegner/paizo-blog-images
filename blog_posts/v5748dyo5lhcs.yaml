  >Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>'s \"Season 0\" trial run, <a href=\"\
  /pfsacg/products/season0\">Season of the Shackles</a>. All six adventures will be\
  \ available for purchase as of April 15, and we'll soon be making a Season of the\
  \ Shackles deck available for purchase as a print-on-demand product at <a href=\"\
  http://drivethrucards.com\" target=\"_blank\">DriveThruCards.com</a>. That deck\
  \ will feature all the new cards we created for the season, so you won't have to\
  \ use proxy cards if you don't want to. The Adventure Path loot reward Councilor's\
  \ Ring will also be available at DriveThruCards.com at the same time.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>We've learned a lot from Season of the Shackles, and we'll be applying that\
  \ experience to make the next season of Adventure Card Guild play even better. Season\
  \ 1, dubbed Season of the Righteous, will premiere with the launch of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9a46\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</em></a> on May 27.</p>\

  \   </table> \n    <h2>Iconic Heroes Promo Cards</h2> \n    <p>Season 1 will also\
  \ allow characters to use promo cards from WizKids' Pathfinder Battles: <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\">Iconic Heroes</a> miniatures line. <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy98sw\">Set 1</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy98sx\">Set 2</a> are\
  \ available now, and at least four more sets will follow.</p> \n    <p>Each Adventure\
  \ Card Guild character can treat the promo card that belongs to the iconic for her\
  \ class as if it was in her Class Deck. For example, Wu Shen, a character from the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy97\">Rogue Class Deck</a>, would be able to take the item\
  \ Footpad's Boots for any B or better deck upgrade, since we treat the set indicator\
  \ P as 0.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6805-WuShenToken.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6805-WuShenToken_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Promo-Footpads.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Promo-Footpads_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>If you're playing Merisiel in the Adventure Card Guild,\
  \ you'll be in even better shape. Because Merisiel is listed as the card's owner,\
  \ she can treat the Footpad's Boots as if that card has the Basic trait. That means\
  \ she can start play with that card in her deck!</p> \n    <h2>Change to Feat Progression</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>The biggest change to the PFSACG organized play system is a response\
  \ to the feedback we've received from event organizers concerning the difficulty\
  \ of mustering tables at small- and medium-sized events. Players from different\
  \ local tables sometimes need different scenarios, but it can be difficult to backtrack\
  \ and catch up. We hear that concern, and we're tinkering with ways to alter feat\
  \ progression that will ease mustering problems. Details will come in the next version\
  \ of the <a href=\"/products/btpy98no\"><em>PFSACG Guide to Organized Play</em></a>.\
  \ In the coming days, we'll also be working closely with the organized play campaign's\
  \ venture-officers to refine ideas and deliver the best possible experience for\
  \ the first full season of the program.</p> \n    <h2>New Guide to Organized Play</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>What a segue! That's right, the card game team is working on an updated\
  \ version of the <a href=\"/products/btpy98no\"><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild Guide to Organized Play</em></a>. This version of the guide will feature\
  \ the update to promo cards mentioned above, as well as details on how the <em>Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous Base Set</em>'s mythic paths will be used in Adventure Card Guild\
  \ play. We're also adding sections that explain how to fill out a Chronicle sheet,\
  \ simplify the deck upgrade process, and address characters that want to play both\
  \ Season 0 and Season 1. All the detail-oriented, rules-lawyering fun your greedy\
  \ little heart could ask for will be coming to you through a download in mid-May.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Free Base Set Program for Retailers Continues</h2> \n    <p>Retailers\
  \ loved our free base set program as a way to get people into their stores and playing\
  \ in the Adventure Card Guild, so we're continuing the program with the Season of\
  \ the Righteous. Game stores that have registered with Paizo's <a href=\"/paizo/about/retailers\"\
  >retailer locator</a> will be contacted in the next few weeks with details about\
  \ how to get a free <em>Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</em>. If your store hasn't\
  \ signed up, you'd best get to it!</p> \n    <p>Until next time, Pathfinders.</p>\
