  \ Society Organized Play, Part 1</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 3, 2008\
  \ </p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Your life may very well be cut short, but your\
  \ legend shall live forever. Strap on your blade, finish memorizing that spell and\
  \ grab your pack. Your first journey awaits. The time to find your Path is at hand.<br>\
  \ —Venture Captain Alissa Moldreserva</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play centers on the sprawling city of Absalom, where five factions\
  \ engage in a shadow war for control of the city's politics and economy. As you\
  \ play, the outcome of your adventures, actions, and deeds affect events on a global\
  \ scale, turning the tide of secret wars between some of Golarion's most powerful\
  \ nations. The fate of the world is literally in your hands. </p> \n    <p>During\
  \ the months of June, July, and August, Nicolas Logue and I will be writing a series\
  \ of blog posts to peel back the curtain surrounding our plans for Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play. Premiering at Gen Con this August, Pathfinder Society is Paizo's\
  \ first foray into the world of RPG organized play. </p> \n    <p>One piece unique\
  \ to our RPG organized play system is factions. Every faction has its own unique\
  \ history, culture, style and specialty. Each has its own modus operandi in the\
  \ ongoing struggle for control of Absalom, and each offers the Pathfinders in their\
  \ service different boons. Choosing your faction is as important as choosing your\
  \ character class or race. It helps define your character in the campaign and ties\
  \ your Pathfinder to one particular nation's destiny. </p> \n    <p>And now, a sneak\
  \ peek at Andoran, birthplace of freedom, and the first unveiled faction for Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play.</p> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO1105-EagleKnight.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n    <p><b>ANDORAN</b><br> Birthplace of Freedom,\
  \ Fledgling Democracy of the Inner Sea</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The days\
  \ of kings are long gone. We are the future of humanity, and of all peoples. Ruled\
  \ by no crown or scepter, we instead rule ourselves.<br> —Captain Colson Mardris,\
  \ Eagle Knight of Andoran</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>From humble beginnings\
  \ as loggers and merchants, the Andorens proved themselves survivors on a hard frontier.\
  \ Even before they won their independence they were an impressive people. Brave\
  \ explorers and canny merchants, they were the first to sail the sea beyond the\
  \ Arch of Aroden. They settled distant colonies, hewing a life from wild lands and\
  \ an inhospitable coastline fraught with peril. The power of Old Taldor's navy rested\
  \ on the shoulders of capable Andoren commanders whose skill at arms, fiery tenacity,\
  \ and naval puissance was unrivaled in the empire's glory day. </p> \n    <p>Andoran\
  \ shrugged off the auspices of Old Taldor when Qadira invaded the empire. Shortly\
  \ thereafter they shattered Cheliax's diabolic chains. Now Andoran holds the reins\
  \ of its own destiny in the strong hands of its people. They are the first government\
  \ of the Inner Sea to entrust its power to its own citizens instead of dolloping\
  \ it upon the crowned brow of a king. Their weapons are innovation, a stubborn dedication\
  \ to idealism, and a firm belief in the potential of humanity. The Andorens are\
  \ a hard people, dedicated to freedom for all, and unable to sit by and watch as\
  \ the world around them submits to savagery and tyranny.</p> \n    <p><b>Goals:\
  \ Common Rule for All</b></p> \n    <p>Andoran would see the tyrannic empires who\
  \ once ruled them brought down. They would see slavery abolished and those who would\
  \ buy and sell people punished in the extreme. They would bring the torch of freedom\
  \ to the world's darkest places and banish mysticism, diabolism, and fear. Common\
  \ Rule must be spread across each horizon. </p> \n    <p><b>Methodology: Light the\
  \ Fires of Freedom</b></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Our greatest weapon is the\
  \ tyranny of our enemies.<br> —Captain Colson Maldris, Eagle Knight of Andoran</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The Andoran faction attacks its enemies from within.\
  \ They find dissidents, freedom fighters, and revolutionaries among the populations\
  \ of their foes and offer them covert aid, equipment, intelligence and the funds\
  \ they need to topple the tyrants. Missions assigned to Andoran faction members\
  \ tend toward helping dissident groups within the other factions, though anything\
  \ that shakes these tyrants' power is a worthy cause for an Andoren to lend himself\
  \ to.</p> \n    <p>Joshua J. Frost<br> Director of Sales &amp; Marketing</p> \n\
