  \ Serpent</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 1, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Season 6 of the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play campaign is coming to a close, and the Society has finally pieced\
  \ together the Numerian relic that gave this season its name: the Year of the Sky\
  \ Key. During the second of this year's interactive Specials, <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu7\"\
  ><em>The Sky Key Solution</em></a>, we're going to fire up the device and see what\
  \ happens!</p> \n    <p>Then again, the Sky Key helped us look back across the ages\
  \ once before, and I want to look ahead to the future—namely Season 7. As I announced\
  \ at the <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2015</a> Preview Banquet and the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Q&amp;A panel about a week ago, Season 7 is going to be the Year of the\
  \ Serpent! Too long has the Aspis Consortium been the source of ridicule and easily\
  \ defeated low-level rogues, and I began to ask what would happen if the Aspis Consortium\
  \ made a serious, concerted effort to tear down the Pathfinder Society. Where are\
  \ those elite operatives we've always heard about, and what can they accomplish\
  \ when bankrolled by one of the wealthiest operations in the Inner Sea? If you had\
  \ a chance to play <a href=\"/products/btpy9ctz\"><em>Pathfinder Society Special\
  \ #6-97: Siege of Serpents</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Special #6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a>, you've had a good look at the Consortium's\
  \ first major operation. However, there's a whole lot more in the works for this\
  \ season with plenty of opportunities to foil Aspis plans (and occasionally even\
  \ be foiled by Aspis plans). I'll let our new, serpentine overlords introduce the\
  \ season's logo: a serpent consuming the Pathfinder Society's Glyph of the Open\
  \ Road.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Logos/PFS-YofSer-Logo.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Logos/PFS-YofSer-Logo_360.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Of course, every great season becomes even better when we pick up a few\
  \ loose threads in addition to spinning new stories, and I have already begun outlining\
  \ some stories that pick up where we left off in far-flung locations from the Mwangi\
  \ Expanse to Mendev—plus at least one more in the earthquake-shattered Precipice\
  \ Quarter in Absalom.</p> \n    <p>And for those of you who were guessing whether\
  \ the Year of the Serpent would involve the Aspis Consortium or the serpentfolk,\
  \ why can't it be both?</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n  \
