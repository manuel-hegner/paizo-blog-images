  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Starfinder releases its\
  \ second Field Test!<br> Hey everyone! Welcome to the exciting reveal of our <a\
  \ href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/Starfinder_FieldTest2.pdf\">second Starfinder\
  \ Second Edition Field Test</a>.</p> \n     <p>If you didn’t already know, there's\
  \ a <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest\">new edition of Starfinder on\
  \ the way</a>. We’ve previously released a Field Test document that highlighted\
  \ a work-in-progress snapshot of the new soldier class, plus some new firearms.\
  \ Today we’re taking a similar approach and releasing the first five levels of the\
  \ new mystic class, along with a handful of Starfinder 2e spells.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/d9a1d0d4-695f-4256-a3af-595f2a372472/ChkChk_2000.png\"\

  \ Sketches by Kent Hamilton</p> \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>Mystic is a\
  \ class that we’re really interested in getting more feedback on. As a spontaneous\
  \ caster, its connections currently give it access to the divine and primal traditions.\
  \ However, regardless of the chosen connection, the mystic gains powerful healing\
  \ in the form of its vitality network ability. Mystics can further customize how\
  \ they use their vitality network through their connection and feat choices, but\
  \ you’ll have to download the Field Test to learn more!</p> \n     <p>In our playtests,\
  \ the mystic has been exceptionally efficient as a healer, in part because its powerful\
  \ vitality network ability has the potential to restore large sums of Hit Points\
  \ as a single action. However, the mystic is also a class that manages its resources,\
  \ either doling out Hit Points in smaller chunks or saving up for a big heal that\
  \ depletes the vitality network entirely. We found that in challenging encounters,\
  \ the mystic might easily deplete their vitality network and need to decide whether\
  \ or not keeping allies alive at low Hit Points is worth the risk.</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ new rendition of the mystic relies on its connection and forming bonds with fellow\
  \ party members. It shares a lot of the same design space as the First Edition mystic,\
  \ just reworked to fit the Second Edition engine and to mesh in a broader sense\
  \ with the setting. We’re taking some steps to allow for mystics to be more directly\
  \ connected to deities, which wasn’t entirely possible in the past. This means that\
  \ a player can create a mystic character who is a priest or follower of a deity\
  \ and gain many of the same benefits that a cleric might enjoy. Don’t worry, mystics\
  \ won’t be required to worship a deity.</p> \n     <p>Along with the mystic, we’\
  re also including some new spells for everyone to check over. Some of these are\
  \ spells we mentioned in our prior Field Test, now with actual stats included. In\
  \ addition, we’ve included some fun thematic spells like doom scroll and motivating\
  \ ringtone, which really show what Starfinder has to offer in terms of a truly different\
  \ type of spellcasting—not to mention the modern and futuristic themes we want to\
  \ explore with our new rules. As always, we’re excited to see fan feedback on our\
  \ work and can’t wait to see the thoughts people share with us in the coming weeks.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Stay tuned for our upcoming Paizo Live, where members of the Starfinder\
  \ team will further discuss the Field Test, as well as give some hints on exciting\
  \ up-and-coming content for the new edition of Starfinder.</p> \n     <p style=\"\
