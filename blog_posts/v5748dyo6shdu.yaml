  >Several years ago, as part of the program assessment made at the time of the Pathfinder\
  \ (second edition) Playtest, the team embarked on a huge initiative spanning several\
  \ years: digitization. This year, with Covid-19 pushing us into our homes and away\
  \ from our traditional spaces, we are both pleased to have started the process and\
  \ dismayed that our timelines aren’t aggressive enough. But we’ve gotten through\
  \ Phase 1 and we thought it would be a good time to talk over some of the items\
  \ we’ve completed, as well as what Phase 2 looks like. </p> \n     <p>We are also\
  \ making a huge plea to our GMs to report games and asking players to encourage\
  \ their GMs to do so as well. Reported games give us our program data - how many\
  \ people participated, what types of games did they play (scenarios/quests/bounties/Adventure\
  \ Paths), where do they play (conventions, home games, FLGS). All of this data is\
  \ necessary to plan for the program. We can’t argue we need to make more scenarios,\
  \ for example, without the data that X number of people play scenarios. We’ve incentived\
  \ the reporting through AcP, but we need the community to help us help them!</p>\
  \ \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <details> <summary><em>So where are we at with\
  \ each program and where are we going?</em></summary> \n      <p><b>Pathfinder Society\
  \ (first edition)</b>: Its foundations lay in paper Chronicles, reporting sheets,\
  \ character sheets, and boons. The emphasis on physical documentation made sense,\
  \ as smartphones weren’t commonplace and computers expensive (and often not-portable).\
  \ But as technology progressed, we stayed with paper, as that was what had been\
  \ done. Twelve years on, we aren’t looking to change how we process Pathfinder Society\
  \ (first edition) data. There is no benefit in trying to upload thousands of chronicles\
  \ and boons. But we don’t want to limit those players that want to use digital tools.\
  \ So we will maintain the hybrid state of the campaign, where you can either use\
  \ digital or paper options and paper records (or digitized versions) remain the\
  \ standard.</p> \n      <p><b>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</b>: As with Pathfinder\
  \ Society (first edition) we have years of paper records for PACS. While the game\
  \ is continuing in digital spaces during Covid, it is meant to be played in a physical\
  \ environment. At this point, we don’t think bringing the records online is a necessity.\
  \ If players wish to scan their Chronicles and boons to have a digital version,\
  \ they are welcome to do so, but the program will continue within the hybrid environment.\
  \ We will publish a Guide 7.0 via pdf that is in line behind the Pathfinder Society\
  \ guide and should be sorted out in early October. At this time, there are no major\
  \ program changes, so the guide will be a compilation of blogs.</p> \n      <p><b>Starfinder\
  \ Society</b>: This program started under the Pathfinder Society (first edition)\
  \ format but is now existing alongside Pathfinder Society (second edition) and we\
  \ want to shift them to be inline under organized play processes. This adjustment\
  \ will happen by the launch of Year 4 and will do so in several chunks. We just\
  \ issued Guide version 3.0 as a pdf, but Guide 4.0 is intended to be digital. We\
  \ are phasing out boons and boon-slotting will end as of Year 4. Chronicle boons\
  \ are moving online, as are Game Rewards, which take the place of Faction boons\
  \ or other benefits that unlock once criteria are achieved. We will also be building\
  \ an Achievement Points - SFS category that functions like the PFS version but draws\
  \ on points earned for playing or GMing Starfinder games. We are not getting rid\
  \ of Chronicles, but we will open up other methods of digital tracking. As we now\
  \ have the bandwidth to correct reporting errors, including fixing factions, restoring\
  \ deleted characters, adding missing AcP and refunding erroneous boons, we are confident\
  \ we can keep our digital records clean. </p> \n      <p><b>Pathfinder Society (second\
  \ edition)</b>: We’ve already implemented many of the items that Starfinder Society\
  \ will embrace this year. Now that we have, we can remove some of the paper tracking\
  \ that exists. The guide is online and had a facelift. Playing and GMing earns AcP-PFS\
  \ and rewards for purchase appear on the Boons tab of your My Organized Play account.\
  \ Chronicle Rewards are in and will go live next week. We’re converting the Faction\
  \ Boons part of the guide to Game Rewards, which will be operational sometime in\
  \ October. When it is ready to go live, we will let everyone know via blog and also\
  \ how to convert boons purchased by Fame. We’ve simplified the Chronicle and the\
  \ new version will appear in October scenarios. We plan to go back and put the simplified\
  \ version into Year 2 by the end of 2020 as well as update all Year 1, though that\
  \ is a larger project that will take longer due to resource need. The guide changes\
  \ include language on how to track character progress. Chronicles will be one way,\
  \ but a player may choose to track items via spreadsheet or other tool and keep\
  \ that as their proof of play alongside their character sheet, making Chronicle\
  \ sheets backups and relevant only to correct errors in the database. We’ve removed\
  \ personally identifying information from the Chronicles as well (no more player\
  \ name or GM signature) to help with player security and to make online completion\
  \ easier.</p> \n     </details> \n     <details> <summary><em>So what is Phase 2?</em></summary>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li>Finishing streamlining Pathfinder Society (second edition)\
  \ to make it easier to join and less cumbersome to track.</li> \n       <li>Bringing\
  \ Starfinder Society in line with Pathfinder Society (second edition)</li> \n  \
  \     <li>Overhauling reporting instructions/processes on paizo.com</li> \n    \
  \   <li>Encouraging use of community developed tools for tracking and character\
  \ management</li> \n       <li>Providing Organized Play Foundation volunteers with\
  \ the tools/information they need to rebuild their site and generate community best\
  \ practices documents.</li> \n      </ul> \n     </details> \n     <details> <summary><em>What\
  \ does this mean for the Pathfinder Society (second edition) Guide?</em></summary>\
  \ \n      <p>It will be available next <b>Wednesday, September 23rd</b>, after we\
  \ wrap PAX Online/TPKon. This puts the release in the middle of the week instead\
  \ of on top of major conventions. The guide underwent a major structural facelift\
  \ in preparation for Year 2. While moving things around, we cut out duplicate text,\
  \ revised the organization to make it read smoother, moved reference points/examples/longer\
  \ descriptions to appendices, reformatted references to reflect publishing styles,\
  \ and hyperlinked all of it. Once we know we don’t need to make further substantial\
  \ changes, we will also manually compile a set of PDFs to go with it. While we will\
  \ be able to update the digital guide, due to the amount of work involved, the PDF\
  \ will not be updated throughout the year.</p> \n      <p>In addition, we are migrating\
  \ the Guide from static pages to a Wiki-format to make finding items even easier.\
  \ If everything goes well, we hope to have this ready for version 3.0 next GenCon.\
  \ After a small period of testing and configuration, we should then be able to turn\
  \ on the automated print to PDF feature, allowing the PDF of the Guide to be updated\
  \ every time there is a significant change.</p> \n     </details> \n     <details>\
  \ <summary><em>What are the major program changes appearing in the Pathfinder Society\

  \ <b>No, GMs should not be adding Fame to any Chronicles earned. </b><br> </p>\n\
  \     <details> <summary><em>Longer answer: </em></summary> \n      <p>From Year\
  \ 2 launch forward, Pathfinder Society adventure (or sanctioned adventure) do not\
  \ award Fame. With AcP as a purchasing currency, we don’t believe the added complexity\
  \ of tracking Fame necessary. We are working on how to convert already purchased\
  \ Fame items into the digital environment as well as making sure we have AcP or\
  \ Faction benefits that cover items that used to be available to purchase with Fame,\
  \ such as Restorations or Infamy removal. We will have more information on how to\
  \ convert Fame in an October blog.</p> \n     </details>\n     <p></p> \n     <p>Wow,\
  \ that was quite a bit of information. As always, we are working towards delivering\
  \ a quality organized play program and value input from our community. We do ask\
  \ for any feedback to be constructive and that it be posted in forums or emailed\
  \ so that we can see and respond</p> \n     <p>Until next week, when we preview\
  \ our September Society scenarios (say that five times fast)<br> - Explore, Report,\
  \ Cooperate!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Tonya\
