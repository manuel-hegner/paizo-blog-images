  \ August release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted fantasy miniatures is only a couple of months\
  \ away. WizKids has delivered final production samples of all 55 figures in the\
  \ set, and it's pretty amazing how they continue to raise the bar on sculpting and\
  \ painting with each Pathfinder Battles release. It's always amazing to see creatures\
  \ and characters we created in our minds finally taking form as three-dimensional\
  \ full-color objects we can hold in our hands. I often consider it one of my greatest\
  \ powers as a publisher, in fact, and this week's preview fittingly covers four\
  \ figures that probably would never have existed if it wasn't for yours truly, even\
  \ if I did not directly invent any of them.</span></p> \n     <p>Let me explain.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The devil-binding empire of Cheliax, a major nation in the Golarion\
  \ campaign setting of the Pathfinder RPG, has a long and storied history that predates\
  \ the founding of Paizo Publishing and the creation of Gen Con.</p> \n     <p>It\
  \ all started more than 20 years ago, when my folks took me and my brother on a\
  \ special vacation to see the Final Four NCAA tournament being hosted that year\
  \ in Seattle. It was my first trip to the city, and as far as the basketball, the\
  \ museums, and the monorails were concerned, it was a highly enjoyable trip for\
  \ the whole family, and Seattle was a great city (little did I know then that I\
  \ would end up living here a couple of decades later).</p> \n     <p>The problems\
  \ started after the tournament, when my father had to stick around for some business\
  \ meetings in the city while my mom took me, my brother, and my grandmother to a\
  \ timeshare unit in a lakeside resort community called Lake Chelan to spend our\
  \ final week in Washington state in a gorgeous, rustic stay in a tourist-oriented\
  \ town filled with lake activities, waterslides, and other fun attractions. The\
  \ only trouble was that we arrived in late March, whereas all of the town's fun\
  \ activities were scheduled for the summer tourist season.</p> \n     <p>We arrived\
  \ to find the lake mostly drained, the \"resort\" part of our accommodations flooded,\
  \ all of the waterslides closed, and even the local bowling alley booked solid for\
  \ the high school \"bowling unit\" (!!!). For a little kid of 13 years, that immediately\
  \ qualified the trip for \"WORST EVER\" status, and it soon became a legend in our\
  \ family, a source of laughs years later but something that actively and truly sucked\
  \ for every hour during which it was actually taking place in what seemed like slow\
  \ motion.</p> \n     <p>The word \"Chelan\" soon became synonymous with the depths\
  \ of evil in my teenage mind, and as I moved on to college in the early 90s, I'd\
  \ taken to using Chelan as the name of the evil kingdom in most of my fantasy fiction.\
  \ By the time I moved to Seattle in 1999, I realized that everyone in my new home\
  \ knew Chelan as a classy resort destination, and since they didn't share my teenage\
  \ loathing for it, it just stuck out, like calling a kingdom Bellevue or Redmond\
  \ or something. It didn't work.</p> \n     <p>But man, I still hated Chelan, and\
  \ wanted to continue my literary revenge upon it. When it came time to design an\
  \ evil kingdom for what would become the Pathfinder Campaign Setting, I decided\
  \ to incorporate much of the creative work I'd done on Chelan, only I decided this\
  \ time to mask it a little more with a slightly modified name: Cheliax.</p> \n \
  \    <p>So yes, I'm afraid Chelaix is all my fault, at least in concept. Others\
  \ took the concepts I laid down and added significantly to them (especially Wes\
  \ Schneider, the demented mind behind the Hellknights). One of the great things\
  \ about being in on the creation of a huge part of the campaign setting is seeing\
  \ where others have taken \"my\" original ideas. Cheliax has come a huge distance\
  \ from my freshman year scribblings, and every time I see some new bit of development\
  \ for it, I can't help but feel like a proud parent.</p> \n     <p>And the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>\
  \ gave me plenty of reasons to play the proud papa, as Cheliax plays heavily in\
  \ the background of the campaign and in its resolution.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-Chelaxians.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-Chelaxians_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Today I present three miniatures associated with\
  \ the Chelish faction, intended to help you stage epic Skull &amp; Shackles encounters\
  \ but usable in any fantasy RPG. I didn't create any of these characters, but I\
  \ was responsible for a big part of their background and I'm ultimately the one\
  \ who decided to include them in the set. This close to Father's Day, I'll call\
  \ that close enough and declare them my twisted progeny by proxy.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-AdmiralThrune.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-AdmiralThrune_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Up first we have the leader of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> Chelaxians, the insidious Admiral Thrune! This diabolical\
  \ naval \"hero\" and her crew play a huge role in the campaign's endgame, and her\
  \ heavy mace, crossbow, and noble costume make her an ’interesting choice for a\
  \ player character, as well. But in the campaign, I'm afraid you're going to have\
  \ to fight her. And her companions, too! This medium figure is slated at the uncommon\
  \ rarity.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-HellknightParalictor.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-HellknightParalictor_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have one of Admiral Thrune's\
  \ most trusted allies, the Scourge Hellknight Paralictor! This fully armored female\
  \ polearm master Hellknight does everything in her power to protect the leadership\
  \ of House Thrune, including pole-axing your player characters in twain. The medium\
  \ figure is also uncommon, and while she is the first Hellknight we've produced\
  \ in the Pathfinder Battles line and the only one in this set, it's fair to say\
  \ she'll soon get a fair amount of company from others in her order…</p> \n    \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-ChelishMarine.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-ChelishMarine_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>A navy needs officers, of course, and the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set is ready to deliver in the form\
  \ of this figure, the Chelish Marine. His smart uniform matches that of his admiral,\
  \ making them look great together. Because you'll probably want more than a single\
  \ crewman, we've slated this medium figure at the common rarity. </p> \n     <p>And\
  \ that's not all for this week! Last week I accidentally previewed only two figures,\
  \ so I've decided to make up the difference by revealing what is probably my personal\
  \ favorite figure in the entire set. Open your eyes, me hearties, and behold the\
  \ SEAWEED SIREN!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-SeaweedSiren.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-SeaweedSiren_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The hideous creature is a CR 13 Large magical beast\
  \ that inhabits islands and coastal regions, luring sailors with its three false\
  \ heads. These bad boys (or girls, I suppose) have a host of cool powers, from a\
  \ gaze attack to a curse power to bolts of sonic energy. Mostly, I just thought\
  \ it looked amazingly cool. Even though the Seaweed Siren does not technically appear\
  \ as a monster in the six adventures of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>, its game statistics do appear in the Bestiary\
  \ section of Pathfinder Adventure Path #60, technically making it qualify for inclusion\
  \ in this set. And really, I just love the way it looks, so I used a rare bit of\
  \ publisher fiat to include it in the set simply because I wanted it. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>So blame me. Indirectly speaking, all four figures this week are my fault!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That's it for this week. Tune in to this space next week for a big announcement\
  \ and an even larger preview of figures… from something other than the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set. What? A NEW set of Pathfinder\
  \ Battles minis? Whatever could it be?</p> \n     <p>Well, come back next week,\
  \ and I'll tell you.</p> \n     <p>In the meantime, don't forget to set up an <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing Pathfinder Battles subscription</a> to make\
  \ sure you don't miss a single figure!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
