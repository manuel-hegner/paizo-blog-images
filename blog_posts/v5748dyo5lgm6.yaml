  \ class=\"date\">Monday, October 20, 2014</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As I noted <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgk7\"\
  >earlier this month</a>, about three weeks ago I began really diving into the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfindersociety/getinvolved\">Open Call</a> submissions and getting\
  \ back to authors with feedback about their work. I'm more than halfway through\
  \ the pile now, and so far it's been really productive. It looks like we might see\
  \ Open Call authors showing up on the front covers of scenarios in a matter of months!\
  \ I gather many of you are working on submissions now, and I'd like to share a few\
  \ recommendations and tips that have come up frequently.</p> \n    <p><b>Scope</b>:\
  \ A Quest is a quick, self-contained adventure that is restricted to 2,000 words\
  \ or less. Keep this in mind when outlining and writing a Quest, for it can be really\
  \ tempting to try to squeeze a full scenario- or module-worth of ideas into this\
  \ short format. The most successful Quests typically have a combat encounter and\
  \ a brief non-combat encounter, and some are able to manage two combat encounters\
  \ with style. I find that when a Quest tries to fit in three combats, it often comes\
  \ at the expense of the background, area descriptions, or some other important section.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It's certainly nice to have a definitive end to a Quest, not a \"to be\
  \ continued.\" Sometimes longer adventures have that type of cliffhanger, but I'd\
  \ rather your submission leave the players high-fiving and knowing they won rather\
  \ than looking worried and feeling like they barely scratched the surface of the\
  \ story.</p> \n    <p><b>Organization</b>: Be sure you're modeling the overall organization\
  \ of your submission after other Paizo adventures. <a href=\"/products/btpy8ttq\"\
  ><i>Ambush in Absalom</i></a> is an excellent reference for making sure you have\
  \ all of the important pieces in the right place, including the Summary, Getting\
  \ Started, and Conclusion sections. Where does the \"Creatures\" header appear in\
  \ an encounter? What types of information appear in the \"Development\" section\
  \ rather than in the room description? The more of this that an author can internalize\
  \ and demonstrate, the easier it is to develop and use that person's work.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Subtiers</b>: Pathfinder Society scenarios use a system of tiers that\
  \ enable play at two different level ranges (e.g. Subtiers 1-2 and 4-5). With the\
  \ exception of several early scenarios, every such adventure's subtiers are three\
  \ levels apart, so it's important that you design your encounters so that the difference\
  \ in the two subtiers' challenge ratings is three as well. That means if the lower\
  \ subtier is facing a CR 3 encounter, the higher subtier should be a CR 6 encounter\
  \ (not a CR 5 or CR 7).</p> \n    <p>Remember the Players: Keep your audience and\
  \ the game format in mind when creating your stories and encounters. A Pathfinder\
  \ Quest should be approachable enough that a group of somewhat experienced players\
  \ are likely to succeed, so I would avoid including really powerful combats that\
  \ are likely to devastate the PCs in a round or two. This is especially true for\
  \ Subtier 1-2, where it is possible to leverage the challenge rating system to make\
  \ a very effective yet low-CR creature that deals an average of [an average PC's\
  \ hit points] per swing. Table 1-1 on page 291 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  ><i>Bestiary</i></a> is a great resource for judging whether your NPCs are a reasonable\
  \ challenge. </p> \n    <p>On a related note, also remember that the players are\
  \ agents in the story limited only by their creativity. Unlike in a video game that\
  \ presents an uninterruptable cut scene, the PCs have the potential to interrupt\
  \ monologues and intervene when the villain tries to do something dastardly. Writing\
  \ cut scenes into an adventure rarely goes over well, and it shouldn't appear in\
  \ your Quest.</p> \n    <p><b>Stylistic Notes and Trends</b>: Paizo's adventures\
  \ tend to avoid future tense, passive voice, and second person references. Exceptions\
  \ show up in dialogue and in a few other circumstances. If you find yourself using\
  \ \"you\" or realize you've written \"will\" without referring to inheritance documentation\
  \ or a type of saving throw, it's probably better for you to revise it.</p> \n \
  \   <p><b>Review Your Submission</b>: Remember that your submission is a reflection\
  \ of your writing and adventure design abilities. Reading your work out loud or\
  \ giving it to a friend to read can help pick out a lot of errors, making it easier\
  \ to wow your reader with your creativity rather than distracting him with grammatical\
  \ concerns.</p> \n    <p>Once again, I'm excited to see so many submissions, and\
  \ I hope that the recommendations above can help many of you create even more engaging\
  \ adventures. Keep them coming.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
