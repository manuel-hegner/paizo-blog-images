  \ </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As soon as we announced Starfinder, there\
  \ were fans that wanted to know what kind of options there would be for the heavy-armor-wearing,\
  \ magic-plasma-cannon-firing, jet-packed combatant character. While any Starfinder\
  \ character can do those things if they dedicate themselves to getting the needed\
  \ resources, the character who does it most easily (and gets the most class features\
  \ designed to work with such actions) is the soldier. This is the description the\
  \ soldier gets in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Conflict is an inevitable result of life. On every\
  \ world that harbors complex living organisms, creatures battle one another for\
  \ dominance, resources, territory, or ideals. Whether you've taken up arms to protect\
  \ others, win glory, exact revenge, or simply earn a living, you are the perfect\
  \ embodiment of this truth. You're an expert at combat of all types but tend to\
  \ prefer heavy armor and weapons—the bigger, the better. You may be a career soldier,\
  \ a fresh mercenary recruit, or a lone wolf who rejects authority, but whether rushing\
  \ in for hand-to-hand combat or firing tactical barrages, you're a consummate warrior,\
  \ never hesitating to put yourself in the line of fire to protect your friends.</i></p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Soldiers are masters of weapons and armor of all\
  \ types, with a good base attack bonus progression (and good Fortitude and Will\
  \ save progressions); proficiency in light armor, heavy armor, and grenades; and\
  \ proficiency (and eventually specialization) in basic and advanced melee weapons,\
  \ small arms, longarms, heavy weapons, and sniper weapons. Since small arms and\
  \ many basic melee weapons gain only half the damage boost from specialization that\
  \ longarms and heavy weapons do, soldiers often prefer to use the bulkier weapon\
  \ options to maximize the damage they deal. Since specializing in heavy weapons\
  \ first requires you to be proficient with heavy weapons, which in turn requires\
  \ proficiency with longarms, it's a much more significant investment for any other\
  \ class to do the same.</p> \n    <p>But a soldier is not simply a killer or thug—\
  she's a trained professional combatant with access to thousands of years of military\
  \ theory and modern education systems. That education tends to be pretty focused,\
  \ but it's still enough to get the solider 8 class skills and 4 skill points per\
  \ level. The Athletics skill covers the need to climb, jump, and swim to get to\
  \ advantageous positions in combat (though by 2nd or 3rd level, jump jets are a\
  \ common armor upgrade that easily increases mobility, and by 5th or 6th level they're\
  \ likely to be replaced by a jetpack armor upgrade). That still leaves 3 skill points\
  \ even for a soldier with a 10 Intelligence to spread around class skills such as\
  \ Acrobatics (useful if you want to get the most out of that jetpack, but not necessary\
  \ for basic flight), Engineering, Intimidate, Medicine, Piloting, Profession, and\
  \ Survival.</p> \n    <p>Since the soldier class's focus is clearly on combat, there's\
  \ much more to her offensive and defensive abilities than just base attack bonuses,\
  \ proficiencies, and specializations. Every soldier begins play with a fighting\
  \ style, which grants special combat options tied to a specific approach to combat\
  \ as the soldier gains levels. There are 7 fighting styles to choose from—arcane\
  \ assailant, armor storm, blitz, bombard, guard, hit-and-run, and sharpshoot. A\
  \ soldier also picks up some of a second fighting style beginning at 9th level.\
  \ In addition to fighting styles, a soldier gains gear boosts that enhance the soldier's\
  \ effectiveness with specific equipment (such as anchoring arcana, armored advantage,\
  \ laser accuracy, and plasma immolation) at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter,\
  \ and a bonus combat feat at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The bonus combat feats leave the soldier free to use the feats all characters\
  \ gain at every odd level to expand beyond combat effectiveness. Other than proficiencies\
  \ and specializations, feats generally have at most one other feat and a few base\
  \ attack or ability score minimums as prerequisites, making even a few bonus feats\
  \ able to cover a wide range of options. (For example, the Shot on the Run feat\
  \ requires only Mobility, a +4 base attack bonus, and a 15 Dexterity—all easily\
  \ achieved by a soldier.) Even at 1st level, any soldier could take Skill Synergy\
  \ to gain 2 new skills as class skill. Or if a player preferred, by 2nd level a\
  \ soldier can have selected Weapon Focus and then Versatile Focus to gain the benefit\
  \ of Weapon Focus with every weapon with which the soldier is proficient.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Since fighting styles are going to be an important part of any soldier's\
  \ design, here's a look at the 5th-level ability from the arcane assailant fighting\
  \ style.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Secret of the Magi (SU)</h3> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block\">When you imbue a weapon with the rune of the eldritch knight,\
  \ in addition to its normal benefits, the rune grants the weapon one of the following\
  \ weapon fusions of your choice: <i>ethereal, flaming, frost, merciful,</i> or <i>shock</i>.\
  \ The weapon can't gain a fusion it already has, and this bonus fusion doesn't count\
  \ toward the maximum total level of fusions the weapon can have at once. The bonus\
  \ fusion ends when the weapon ceases to be imbued with the rune of the eldritch\
  \ knight. For more information on fusions, see page 191.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>With that, we've covered more than half of the Starfinder classes—check\
  \ out <a href=\"/starfinder\"><b>paizo.com/starfinder</b></a> to find links to previous\
  \ blogs presenting the envoy, mystic, operative, and soldier. We're going to take\
  \ a little break from classes next week in order to preview some other elements\
  \ of the game, but in the months before the game's release this August, we'll preview\
  \ the remaining three—the mechanic, solarian, and technomancer!</p> \n    <p>Owen\
