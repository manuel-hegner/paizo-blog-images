  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">We've talked in depth about many of the systematic\
  \ changes and PC options in the blogs so far, but what about monsters? From animated\
  \ objects to zombies, from the lowliest kobold to the mighty jabberwock, the Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Bestiary includes over 250 different monsters and other adversaries built\
  \ specifically for the playtest. But what makes these monsters tick? We've worked\
  \ to bring you many of your favorite Pathfinder monsters with their familiar feel\
  \ and niche in the world, but with updated mechanics to make your encounters even\
  \ more memorable!</p> \n    <h2>Signature Abilities</h2> \n    <p>One of the monster\
  \ innovations I—a computer science student at the time—appreciated most in Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition was the idea of the Universal Monster Rule. It follows one of the\
  \ most important principles of programming: modularity, which is to say, don't reinvent\
  \ the wheel. One side effect of Universal Monster Rules having been a new concept\
  \ in Pathfinder First Edition, however, is that many less fantastic creatures, especially\
  \ animals, had a similar suite of Universal Monster Rules. For example, owlbears\
  \ are iconic and memorable creatures, but as far as their statistics, if you look\
  \ at the CR 4 owlbear and the CR 4 tiger side by side, the owlbear doesn't really\
  \ have anything different to use during the encounter that the tiger doesn't.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>In\
  \ the playtest version, those two monsters have some significantly different abilities.\
  \ The tiger still has grab, allowing it to grapple a creature it hits with its jaws\
  \ or claw attack, and the pounce action, allowing it to Stride and then Strike.\
  \ Based on its real-world fighting style, it now also has wrestle, allowing it to\
  \ claw a creature it's grabbed and knock it prone, and sneak attack, granting it\
  \ extra damage against flat-footed creatures (typically ambushed via Stealth or\
  \ those prone from its wrestle). Meanwhile, the owlbear also still has grab, but\
  \ once it has you grabbed, it can gnaw on you, hoping to disembowel you so it can\
  \ devour your guts and later regurgitate them to feed its young—and potentially\
  \ making you sick from the disgusting sight. It can also unleash a blood-curdling\
  \ screech as it advances into the fight to frighten you.</p> \n    <p>In general,\
  \ giving interesting new abilities to real-world animals like the tiger allowed\
  \ us to do some fun research into the animals' habits and design from there. Animals\
  \ that hunt in packs sometimes have abilities to deal extra damage in groups, ambush\
  \ predators use sneak attack and various sneaky tactics, and so on.</p> \n    <h2>Dynamic\
  \ Defenses</h2> \n    <p>In Pathfinder First Edition, damage reduction (DR) and\
  \ energy resistance both reduce damage by a set amount, the rarer vulnerability\
  \ multiplies damage by 1.5, and immunity flat-out prevents certain abilities from\
  \ functioning. Taken as a whole, monster defenses generally penalize you for using\
  \ the wrong thing; you can deal your normal damage only by correctly bypassing DR,\
  \ resistance, and immunities, and monsters rarely have a vulnerability. But in stories,\
  \ we often imagine fey as being burned by cold iron or werewolves being poisoned\
  \ by silver, and the reality of DR is that they just take the same damage from those\
  \ as they do from cold, electricity, or fire. To fit those stories and to vary things\
  \ up, we've combined DR and energy resistance into resistance, which reduces damage\
  \ by a set amount, and we've changed vulnerability into a more common element called\
  \ weakness, which increases damage by a set amount.</p> \n    <p>Two great examples\
  \ of how this can dramatically change the feel of monsters are skeletons and zombies.\
  \ A level 0 skeleton has 14 AC, 6 HP, and since it's made of bone, resistance 5\
  \ to slashing and piercing damage. A level 0 zombie, on the other hand, has 11 AC,\
  \ 20 HP, and weakness 5 to slashing damage. The zombie takes 5 extra damage every\
  \ time it's hit by a slashing weapon—that's an extremely high weakness! This means\
  \ the fights feel very different, even though the creatures both take about the\
  \ same number of swings to bring down. You can test this out for yourself in Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition right now: consider giving zombies some extra HP and changing their\
  \ DR into a weakness instead and see how the feel of the fight shifts!</p> \n  \
  \  <h2>Sweet Suites</h2> \n    <p>Some monsters in Pathfinder First Edition have\
  \ a large suite of abilities (typically from long lists of spell-like abilities),\
  \ which vary between key iconic abilities, story abilities that influence what the\
  \ monster can do in the narrative, and other abilities that are niche, redundant,\
  \ or sometimes much weaker than their other attacks. For instance, it's pretty unlikely\
  \ a nalfeshnee's call lightning is a good idea for a CR 14 monster to use in combat,\
  \ and it doesn't have much of a noncombat application, either. In Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition, we tried to keep a monster's iconic abilities and story abilities while\
  \ removing redundant or niche abilities, and then adding something new that fits\
  \ the monster's ecology. For instance, barbed devils don't have the equivalent of\
  \ order's wrath or unholy blight, but they have a special power called Warden of\
  \ Erebus that lets them create extremely versatile glyphs of warding, cementing\
  \ their role as, well, wardens of Erebus. For all such monsters, the goal is to\
  \ make the monster's suite of abilities much easier to use and more memorable without\
  \ oversimplifying the monsters, following our overall goal of adding as much depth\
  \ to the game as possible while minimizing the cost in complexity.</p> \n    <h2>I\
  \ Have Multiattack</h2> \n    <p>To close off, many people have been wondering how\
  \ in the world we handle creatures with many heads, like the hydra, or arms, like\
  \ the marilith or hekatonkheires, in the 3-action system. Such creatures have unique\
  \ abilities to use their attacks in tandem in different ways. For instance, a marilith\
  \ has three options for her six blades. She can make a focused assault on one enemy,\
  \ which can deal a massive amount of damage on a hit, and deals damage for a single\
  \ longsword even on a failure (but not a critical failure). Alternatively, she can\
  \ spin about like a whirlwind of blades, attacking up to six different creatures\
  \ with her swords. Finally, she can just attack twice and use the other blades to\
  \ parry, giving her a killer AC for 1 round.</p> \n    <p>That's it for monsters\
  \ for today; tune in on Friday as Logan goes through an example monster in detail\
  \ and shows how we made the statblock easier to reference!</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br>\
