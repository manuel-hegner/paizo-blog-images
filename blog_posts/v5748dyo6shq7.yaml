  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Red Waves Aflame — Moderate 15</h3> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">The city of Bloodcove, on the western coast of the Mwangi Expanse,\
  \ is one of the region’s major port cities, a veritable melting pot where a merchant\
  \ can find any item they’re looking for, a traveler can find any dish to fill their\
  \ belly, and an outlaw can find any number of places to lay low. While it’s named\
  \ for the crimson waters that flow between its giant mangroves and reflect the burning\
  \ sunset, the city is also a chaotic one. Pirate captains and cutthroat merchants\
  \ vie for control and brawls are tolerated as long as they don’t cause to much disturbance,\
  \ providing another possible interpretation of its name.</p> \n     <p>Lately, several\
  \ of the fishers in one of the city’s docks, as well as nearby restaurant owners,\
  \ reported receiving threatening messages demanding a share of their catch and profits\
  \ in an obvious protection racket. Though such a thing is hardly unknown in Bloodcove,\
  \ the growing presence of some local Firebrands has empowered the dock workers to\
  \ resist the scheme, and they’ve even managed to drive off a few pirates come to\
  \ collect. The last such tussle ended with the pirates threatening that their leader\
  \ was going to send “a collector” next time, and the merchants worry that things\
  \ are getting beyond their ability to handle.</p> \n     <p>The adventurers have\
  \ been called to the docks to make sure everything’s well. After a few minutes,\
  \ the “collector” surfaces in the bay. A maliadi—a hippo-like beast as greedy as\
  \ it is massive, known for taking tribute from those it considers its lessers—emerges\
  \ from the water and begins to rampage. The adventurers must stop the creature before\
  \ it can make its way deeper into the inland markets, and maybe find out who sent\
  \ it there in the first place!</p> \n     <p><b>Creature</b> The maliadi remains\
  \ in the water initially, attacking from range using fire magic like <em>produce\
  \ flame</em> and, if necessary, <em>volcanic eruption</em>, relying on its collar\
  \ of fire to stymie incoming attacks and attempting to separate PCs from each other\
  \ using its wall spells. If targeted by magic, it uses its Counterspelling Wall\
  \ and then, seeing this as a challenge to its dominance, charges down the spellcaster\
  \ who would be so presumptuous as to use magic against it and attempts to Swallow\
  \ them Whole. When reduced to 30 Hit Points, the maliadi tries to flee by turning\
  \ itself into a river; if caught after this point, it recognizes its defeat and\
  \ is willing to give up the names of those who called it here, possibly leading\
  \ the PCs to their next encounter in Bloodcove.</p> \n     <p><b>Rickety Docks</b>\
  \ The docks here are all either old, floating, precariously built over mangrove\
  \ roots, or a combination of all three, and in any event were hardly made to withstand\
  \ a rampaging Gargantuan hippopotamus. The maliadi can Capsize the docks as if they\
  \ were boats of Huge size. </p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3e51327b-e54c-4881-a740-737eb86d99b4/070221_bestiaryintro.jpg\"\

  \ A creature within 100 feet of the maliadi that the maliadi can see Casts a Spell\

  \ The maliadi tries to capsize an adjacent aquatic vessel of its size or smaller.\
  \ The maliadi must succeed at a DC 35 Athletics check (reduced by 5 for each size\
  \ smaller the vessel is than the maliadi) or the pilot’s Sailing Lore DC, whichever\
  \ is higher.</p> \n     <p><b>Change Shape</b> [one-action] The maliadi can take\

  \ takes on the form of a stretch of river, with the effects of <em>wind walk</em>,\
