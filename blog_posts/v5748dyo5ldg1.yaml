  \ the Cat out of the Bag</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 15, 2012</p> \n\
  \   <div style=\"float: left; padding: 0 1em 1em 0;\">\n    <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"\

  \ </div> \n   <p>Actually, we are letting the cat out of the book. Last week, after\
  \ previewing the tengu section of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"><i>Advanced\
  \ Race Guide</i></a>, we asked you what you wanted to see next. We received many\
  \ good suggestions, but it seems that many of you wanted to see the catfolk.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>These lithe and agile creatures make excellent monks, rangers, and especially\
  \ rogues, but they also have a mysterious side, as they are sometimes able to control\
  \ luck and can draw on supernatural powers and spells that are very catlike in nature.\
  \ This week’s preview examines just some examples of these themes in the catfolk\
  \ section.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1121-Catfolk.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    <br> Illustration by Kieran Yanner\n   </div> \n   <h2>Catfolk Rogue\
  \ Talents</h2> \n   <p>The following rogue talents can only be taken by catfolk.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Deadly Scratch (Ex):</b> A catfolk rogue with this talent can apply\
  \ poison to her claws without accidentally poisoning herself. A catfolk rogue must\
  \ have the cat’s claws racial trait and the poison use class feature before taking\
  \ this talent.</p> \n   <p><b>Disarming Luck (Ex):</b> Once per day, when a catfolk\
  \ rogue attempts to disable a device and fails by 5 or more, she can reroll the\
  \ check as a free action. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse\
  \ than the original roll.</p> \n   <p><b>Graceful Faller (Ex):</b> A catfolk rogue\
  \ with this talent lands on her feet even when she takes lethal damage from a fall.\
  \ If the catfolk rogue also has the nimble faller racial trait, she takes damage\
  \ from any fall as if it were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.</p> \n   <p><b>Nimble\
  \ Climber (Ex):</b> A catfolk rogue with this talent gains a +4 bonus on Climb checks.\
  \ If she has the climber racial trait, she can take 10 on her Climb checks even\
  \ when in immediate danger or distracted.</p> \n   <p><b>Single-Minded Appraiser\
  \ (Ex):</b> A catfolk rogue with this talent is skilled at determining the value\
  \ of sparkly things. She can always take 10 when appraising gems and jewelry.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Vicious Claws (Ex):</b> A catfolk with this talent uses d8s to roll\
  \ sneak attack damage instead of d6s, but only when she uses her claws to make the\
  \ sneak attack. A catfolk rogue must have the cat’s claws racial trait before taking\
  \ this talent.</p> \n   <h2>Catfolk Feats</h2> \n   <p>Catfolk have access to the\
  \ following feats.</p> \n   <p><b>Black Cat</b><br> Bad luck befalls those who dare\
  \ to cross you.<br> <b>Prerequisite:</b> Catfolk.<br> <b>Benefit:</b> Once per day\
  \ as an immediate action, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can force the\
  \ opponent who made the attack to reroll it with a –4 penalty. The opponent must\
  \ take the result of the second attack roll. This is a supernatural ability.<br>\
  \ <b>Special:</b> If you take this feat and don’t already have all black fur, your\
  \ fur turns completely black when you take this feat.</p> \n   <h2>Catfolk Magic\
  \ Items</h2> \n   <p>The following magic items are often created and used by catfolk.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Daredevil Softpaws</b><br> <b>Aura</b> faint enchantment; <b>CL</b>\
  \ 3rd<br> <b>Slot</b> feet; <b>Price</b> 1,400 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p> \n  \
  \ <p class=\"stat-block-breaker\">Description</p> \n   <p>This pair of magical softpaw\
  \ boots (see above) allows the catfolk wearing them to gain extra maneuverability\
  \ while moving through hazardous areas. As a free action, the wearer can click her\
  \ heels together to grant herself a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks made\
  \ to move through threatened squares or to move through an enemy’s space without\
  \ provoking attacks of opportunity for up to 10 rounds per day. The rounds need\
  \ not be consecutive. Furthermore, anytime the wearer of the boots successfully\
  \ moves though the space of an enemy without provoking an attack of opportunity,\
  \ she gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that enemy until the end of her turn.</p>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"stat-block-breaker\">Construction</p> \n   <p><b>Requirements</b>\
  \ Craft Wondrous Item, <i>cat’s grace</i>; <b>Cost</b> 700 gp</p> \n   <h2>Catfolk\
  \ Spells</h2> \n   <p>Catfolk have access to the following spells.</p> \n   <p><b>Steal\
  \ breath</b><br> <b>School</b> transmutation [air]; <b>Level</b> bard 2, druid 2,\
  \ sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2<br> <b>Casting</b> Time 1 standard action<br> <b>Components</b>\
  \ V, S<br> <b>Range</b> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br> <b>Target</b> one living\
  \ creature<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 round (see text)<br> <b>Saving Throw</b> Fortitude\
  \ negates; see text; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes<br> You pull the breath from a\
  \ creature’s lungs, dealing damage and leaving it unable to speak, use breath weapons,\
  \ or cast spells with verbal components. If the target fails its saving throw, it\
  \ takes 2d6 points of damage, and it cannot speak, use breath weapons, or do anything\
  \ else requiring breathing, and a visible line of swirling air leaves the target’\
  s mouth and enters your mouth.<br> If, during the duration, the target moves out\
  \ of range or line of effect to you, the spell immediately ends. This spell has\
  \ no effect on creatures that do not need to breathe air.</p> \n   <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br>\
