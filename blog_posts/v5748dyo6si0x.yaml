  \ of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c7l/discuss&amp;page=2?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis#tabs\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em></a>, continued from the excerpt in the blog, “\
  <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0q\">On the Next Paizo LIVE:\
  \ Slayers and more!</a>”</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p><b>“INFORMATION FOR\
  \ EVERYONE</b><br> Whether you’re eager to play in a Drift Crisis campaign, itching\
  \ to run an adventure as the game master, seeking options for other campaigns, or\
  \ just delighted by Starfinder lore, Drift Crisis offers a wealth of content well-suited\
  \ for everybody. </p> \n       <p>“Chapter 1 is suitable for all readers, constructed\
  \ in many ways like a traditional setting supplement with details about factions,\
  \ regions, and thematic character options. This chapter introduces you to the Drift\
  \ and how it works before exploring what the Drift Crisis entails—all presented\
  \ as possibilities, not irrefutable facts. What exactly caused the Drift Crisis\
  \ and what might resolve it can vary based on the campaign’s needs, so the information\
  \ here can fuel character motivations, questions, and conspiracy theories. </p>\
  \ \n       <p>“You likely already know about Starfinder’s campaign setting (such\
  \ as through Chapter 12 of the Core Rulebook), and while much of that information\
  \ remains relevant, most worlds now experience new difficulties. How does Drift\
  \ disruption impact the Azlanti Star Empire, whose far-flung territories are connected\
  \ only by faster-than-light starships? What comes of Akiton’s failing thasteron\
  \ starship fuel industry once the predominant faster-than-light travel technology\
  \ becomes less attractive? How does the Veskarium respond when extraplanar material\
  \ bleeds into its core star system and envelops several planets, cutting those worlds\
  \ off from the empire? Articles ahead have the answers while also posing just as\
  \ many new questions and adventure hooks to inspire your group. </p> \n       <p>“\
  Grand organizations familiar and new are also working on how to best resolve or\
  \ exploit the Drift Crisis chaos. These could be key allies in your upcoming adventures,\
  \ or they could be adversaries seeking an underhanded advantage at others’ expense.\
  \ What do they want? And how might your characters get involved? With Drift technologies\
  \ disrupted, how do starship manufacturers respond? How does the church of Triune\
  \ respond when its deity isn’t answering prayers and the galaxy demands answers\
  \ that Triunites should have? Why is this calamity simultaneously profitable and\
  \ infuriating for the Free Captains? </p> \n       <p>“And of course, there’s loads\
  \ of what every player enjoys: exciting new character options! While these new options\
  \ all tie into the Drift, catastrophes, or extraplanar power in some way, they’\
  re well-suited for any campaign, not just for those set during the Drift Crisis.\
  \ Awaken your divinatory might with the new Drift Crisis precog anchor, or start\
  \ channeling extraplanar influences with new solarian revelations. Bend space with\
  \ new vanguard disciplines, or alter the planar properties of your own world with\
  \ the witchwarper’s plunderer of worlds alternate class features. New themes provide\
  \ four great origins for your character, and new gear ensures you’re properly equipped\
  \ for whatever extradimensional challenges lie ahead. Want more character content?\
  \ The last page of each adventure seed in Chapter 2 includes thematic new options\
  \ for PCs; if your GM is using that adventure seed to craft a campaign, though,\
  \ it might be reserved as special treasure, so check with your GM about these Chapter\
  \ 2 options.</p> \n       <p>“The wonderful part about the Drift Crisis is that,\
  \ because there’s no one storyline, the event caters well to a group running several\
  \ campaigns simultaneously, with each story run by a different GM. Once you know\
  \ which adventure hook from Chapter 2 one GM is using, you can enjoy reading the\
  \ other 19 virtually spoiler-free. To help with navigating all the options, check\
  \ out the player option index and general index on pages 187–188.”</p> \n      </blockquote>\
