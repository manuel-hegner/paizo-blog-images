  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 2, 2008</p> \n   <p>In <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i7\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #11</a>, we journey into the hostile, orc-infested Hold of Belkzen.\
  \ While the adventure “Skeletons of Scarwall” itself is primarily limited to one\
  \ single ruin in this savage land, we also have a gazetteer of the Hold in case\
  \ you want to do some sightseeing along the way. All manner of surprises and dangers\
  \ await discovery therein—check out the following two sample locations excerpted\
  \ from the article as examples!</p> \n   <p><b>The Brimstone Haruspex:</b> Though\
  \ highly independent, even proud orc chieftains sometimes seek advice. When this\
  \ happens, most warlords send their seconds-in-command to the Brimstone Haruspex,\
  \ the temple complex high in the caldera of a smoking volcano. Here a group of ancient\
  \ and inbred orc monks offer guidance in exchange for massive tribute. In addition\
  \ to maintaining the only supposedly complete record of orc history—a lengthy series\
  \ of cave paintings stretching all the way back to the orcs’ initial emergence—\
  the monks are also oracles, breathing in the vapors from the active fumaroles in\
  \ order to spin weird and bloody prophecies. Unfortunately, the fumes that give\
  \ them their insights are highly caustic, permanently scarring their faces and lungs.\
  \ It is for this reason that most leaders choose to send their seconds-incommand\
  \ with questions, as the cruel and prudent priests frequently opt to dangle petitioners\
  \ in the sulfurous pits to gain the revelations firsthand.</p> \n   <p><b>The Skittermounds:</b>\
  \ These tall, sandy mounds stretch for miles across the foothills of the Mindspin\
  \ Mountains, and are avoided by all but the truly desperate, as they represent the\
  \ openings to a vast and complex series of ankheg nests. For the most part, the\
  \ warring ankheg armies are content to battle each other in their leagues of underground\
  \ tunnels, noticeable to those above only as a low buzzing, though foolhardy travelers\
  \ might occasionally witness a colony raising a new mound entrance with frightening\
  \ speed and efficiency. Every few years, however, runoff from intense storms in\
  \ the mountains floods the plain, causing the colonies to erupt from their holes\
  \ by the thousands and press eastward, consuming all in their path.</p> \n   <p><b>Sech\
  \ Nevali:</b> Also called the Hanging Monastery, Sech Nevali is a relic from Thassilonian\
  \ times, a vast stone temple complex suspended over a mile-deep chasm by immense\
  \ chains running between three high mountain peaks. Originally dedicated to the\
  \ Peacock Spirit, the monastery is now inhabited by an order of secretive, isolationist\
  \ monks who believe (correctly) that not even orcs would brave the most treacherous\
  \ mountains in Belkzen in order to disturb their solitude. Yet what their ultimate\
  \ purpose could be in such a remote and inhospitable place remains a mystery beyond\
  \ Sech Nevali’s swaying walls.</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief</p>\
