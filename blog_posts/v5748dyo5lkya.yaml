  \ the Powered Armor in <i>Armory</i>!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July\
  \ 17, 2018</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Powered armor—high-tech defensive suits that\
  \ move under their own power rather than using the muscles of the wearer—have a\
  \ long history in science-fantasy stories, dating all the way back to E.E. \"Doc\"\
  \ Smith's 1937 Lensman novel <i>Galactic Patrol </i>(one reason the Lensman books\
  \ appear in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook's</em></a>\
  \ Inspirational Media list). The conceptually serve as armor, steed, and sometimes\
  \ even weapon for super-advanced knight of high-tech settings, allowing a character\
  \ to act as science-fantasy cavalry. There are five suits of powered armor in the\
  \ Core Rulebook, which is just enough to give an idea of how such gear works in\
  \ the game, but certainly isn't anywhere near enough to cover all your possible\
  \ powered armor needs.</p> \n     <p>Happily, there's a good deal more in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory\"><em>Starfinder Armory</em></a>.</p> \n  \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180717-PowerArmorSpread.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180717-PowerArmorSpread_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <br><i>Illustrations by Leonardo Borazio</i>\n      <p></p>\n    \
  \ </div> \n     <p>The book includes 18 total suits, from the scrapper's rig (item\
  \ level 4) to the starguard (item level 20), with at least one at each item level\
  \ and two at item level 17). Six of those suits are Medium, eleven are Large, and\
  \ one is Gargantuan. While most of them are technological items five (<i>celerity\
  \ rigging</i>, <i>extradimensional armor</i>, <i>kyton bloodsuit</i>, <i>spellcaster's\
  \ aegis</i>, and <i>stag-step suit</i>) incorporate magic into their core design\
  \ and are hybrid items.</p> \n     <p>In addition to providing more than three times\
  \ the number of suits as the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, Armory provides some general\
  \ power armor rules, covering weapon slots, hybrid powered armor… and how to improve\
  \ a suit of powered armor to be a higher item level. This system allows a character\
  \ to spend credits to boot a suit of powered armor's item level, EAC and KAC bonuses,\
  \ and even (if you boost it by enough item levels) its maximum Dexterity, Strength\
  \ bonus, and number of upgrade slots. These improvement rules are designed to allow\
  \ a player who builds a character around a specific design of powered armor, they\
  \ don't have to take a suit of a different size or environmental movement or operational\
  \ range just to keep their armor relevant when gaining character levels.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In addition to just offering more suits at more item levels, Armory also\
  \ provide powered armors design for specific situations. The explorer's cradle is\
  \ design for days-long missions of investigation in harsh environments. The personal\
  \ submersible operates underwater, and allows you to breath water and survive great\
  \ depths even without using its environmental protections. The reactor guard similar\
  \ protects you from radiation, even when its environmental protections aren't active.\
  \ The <i>spellcaster's aegis</i> is specifically designed to allow magic-savvy characters\
  \ to manipulate its built-in runes for more effective dispel efforts and greater\
  \ protection against spells.</p> \n     <p>Whether you are an armor storm soldier\
  \ looking for a suit to improve with you as you gain levels, or a mystic who has\
  \ decided the best offense is a good defense, <i>Starfinder Armory</i> has the powered\
  \ armor to meet your needs!</p> \n     <p>Owen K.C. Stephens<br> <i>Starfinder Design\
  \ Lead</i></p> \n    </div> <!-- tags: Starfinder, Starfinder Armory, Leonardo Borazio\
