  \ month, we highlighted the UK and Venture-Captain David Harrison's efforts to grow\
  \ Pathfinder Society there. We now shift our focus to the north and the land of\
  \ the Vikings. Venture-Captain Diego Winterborg's report on Pathfinder Society in\
  \ Denmark was a very interesting read for me and I hope all of you find it informative\
  \ as well.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Denmark is a Scandinavian country made\
  \ up of a peninsula that is geographically joined to Northern Germany, called Jutland,\
  \ and a large number of islands southwest of Sweden, the largest of which are Funen\
  \ and Zealand. Its size and population are roughly the equivalent of Tennessee.\
  \ Greenland and the Faroe Islands are part of the Danish Rigsfællesskab, or Commonwealth.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign made its arrival in Denmark\
  \ in February 2010 when a few friends and I went to a small RPG convention in the\
  \ town of Odense. Danish RPG conventions are, by their nature, rather small events,\
  \ and are largely dominated by indie games and a lot of deep-immersion, psychodrama\
  \ players, so it goes without saying that we made quite an impression with our loud\
  \ combat-heavy, dice-rolling RPG, which we ran in the convention's common area,\
  \ for all to see. While we fully expected a lot of people would be provoked by our\
  \ very different approach to gaming, it gave us an excellent opportunity to engage\
  \ them in a discussion about the merits of “our game.” By the end of the convention,\
  \ what started out as a four-man event had drawn in a score of new players and totaled\
  \ some 10 sessions.</p> \n     <p>During the summer of 2010, we arranged a game\
  \ day in honor of then Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator, Joshua J. Frost,\
  \ who was making Copenhagen his first stop on his European tour. His tour culminated\
  \ at Paizo Con UK that year. Frost was very keen on having a solid PFS presence\
  \ in Europe, and in Denmark I volunteered for the position of regional coordinator.\
  \ That is how Denmark, being a small country by most standards, was fortunate enough\
  \ to be assigned a Venture-Captain with the first round of selections, when the\
  \ program was born in the fall of 2010.</p> \n     <p>Early in the fall of 2010,\
  \ the first game days were planned at the game store, Fantask, in Copenhagen. While\
  \ the venue is very small and only allows for a single session every other weekend,\
  \ it has been very reliable and has been a constant for over a year.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Pathfinder Society has since had annual representation in Denmark's two largest\
  \ gaming conventions, Viking Con and Fastaval, as well as other smaller conventions\
  \ and game days in and around Copenhagen.</p> \n     <p>This winter Jacob Trier,\
  \ who had just recovered from serious illness, volunteered for the position as Venture-Lieutenant\
  \ based in Jutland. This addition will ensure a stronger presence in the western\
  \ half of Denmark. By next month, regular store games are expected to start in Dragon's\
  \ Lair in the city of Aarhus and this year's Fastaval convention will have a locally\
  \ based Pathfinder Society coordinator.</p> \n     <p>In 2011, Viking Con and Fastaval\
  \ had nine Pathfinder Society tables each. This was satisfactory as a very small\
  \ core of players and GMs drove our continued interest in Pathfinder. This year,\
  \ however, we are seeing the emergence of more private gaming groups and expect\
  \ to have a growing GM base for 2012's events.</p> \n     <p>The primary Pathfinder\
  \ Society events scheduled for 2012 in Denmark are:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Spilfestival,\
  \ on March 24, features <a href=\"/products/btpy8lwi\"><i>Blood under Absalom</i></a>\
  \ as its highlighted event. This marks a milestone for the Pathfinder Society in\
  \ Denmark as it is the first time a Pathfinder Society multi-table special will\
  \ be run here.</li> \n      <li>Fastaval, April 4–8: Danish Pathfinder players will\
  \ get their first opportunity to play the Season 3 exclusive, <a href=\"/products/btpy8qpw\"\
  ><i>The Cyphermage Dilemma</i></a>. We have 15 tables scheduled over the four days.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Viking Lodge Game Days are planned for July 28–29. Started in 2010,\
  \ this is fast becoming a Danish tradition. The plans for this event are still in\
  \ the planning stages. Participants can count on being among a good number of Paizo\
  \ fans and having a full day of Pathfinder Society games, followed by a night out\
  \ in Copenhagen afterward.</li> \n      <li>Viking Con 31, October 19—21, is Denmark's\
  \ largest gaming convention and we will certainly have something special to offer\
  \ to Pathfinder Society players.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>Danish Pathfinder Society\
  \ events are also receiving a measure of Paizo convention support, which hopefully\
  \ will increase interest and send a strong signal that Paizo pays attention to its\
  \ international fans.</p> \n     <p>To facilitate continued growth of Pathfinder\
  \ Society, we are making plans with public libraries to start having monthly game\
  \ days. The success of this plan is still dependant on GMs volunteering to run games.\
  \ Initially, I am planning game days in Copenhagen libraries only. But, the public\
  \ library network in Denmark is rather extensive and Pathfinder Society has the\
  \ potential to reach veritably every Danish roleplayer interested in participating\
  \ in an organized play campaign.</p> \n     <p>This brings me to one of my most\
  \ important points about roleplaying in Denmark. The RPGA and Living Greyhawk never\
  \ established themselves in our country, and the very concept of an organized play\
  \ campaign is very new to Danish gamers. According to my friendly local gaming store,\
  \ Pathfinder RPG sales are increasing, and continued convention scheduling and internet\
  \ exposition is bound to draw players into the fold one handful at a time. While\
  \ events to date remain small, we always know we will be among friends as we strive\
  \ to continue increasing our numbers.</p> \n     <p>If you live in Denmark or Southern\
  \ Sweden and are interested in trying out Pathfinder Society Organized Play, you\
