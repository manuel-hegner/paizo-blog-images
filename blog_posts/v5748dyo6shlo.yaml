  \ One</b></p>\n      </center> \n      <center>\n       <h2>DOWN AND OUT</h2>\n\
  \      </center> \n      <p>Misree crawled out of an air duct and looked around\
  \ the hangar bay, one of the cheapest and most cluttered on Absalom Station. She\
  \ crouched behind a pile of spent energy cells and listened past the hiss of leaking\
  \ hydraulic lines and the clang of someone banging on a bolt for anything that sounded...\
  \ worrisome. Like, say, snippets of conversation between enforcers bent on capturing\
  \ her. She didn’t pick up anything alarming.</p> \n      <p>There were two dozen\
  \ ships in the bay, arrayed in uneven lines, from little one-person runabouts to\
  \ bulky cargo vessels, and her own swift courier, the <em>Up and Out</em>, was way\
  \ in the back, closest to the exit, just where she liked it. This was the kind of\
  \ hangar where you had to pay your docking fees up front, so there was nothing stopping\
  \ her from jumping on board, spinning up the engines, and racing out of here. Sure,\
  \ coming back to the station without getting murdered on arrival would be tricky,\
  \ but once she got her hands on some credits, she'd make paying back Zephonith her\
  \ first—second—at least <em>third</em>—priority. In Misree's experience, enough\
  \ credits could smooth over just about any difficulty. It was just a shame she always\
  \ had more difficulties than credits lately.</p> \n      <p>Once she was confident\
  \ the way was clear, Misree ran across the hangar toward her ship... and was within\
  \ steps of the boarding ramp when a vesk shimmered out of some kind of stealth field\
  \ and stood in her way, holding an immense wrench casually in one clawed hand. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>Misree stopped short, very nearly colliding with the vesk, which would\
  \ have made a bad situation even worse. She looked up (and up, and up) into the\
  \ reptilian smile. The vesk was easily seven feet tall, while Misree was on the\
  \ short side for a human. \"Smeliel! I was just looking for you.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Isn't that lucky,\" the vesk enforcer rumbled. \"I was looking for you, too.\" She\
  \ rapped the nose of the <em>Up and Out</em> with her wrench. \"You weren't going\
  \ to leave, were you? You have an appointment with our mutual employer, and I’m\
  \ sure you don’t plan to keep her waiting.\"</p> \n      <p>Misree's smile slipped.\
  \ \"I don't work for Zephonith.\" Misree didn't work for anyone anymore. She charted\
  \ her own course, made her own choices, and didn't have to answer to anyone—or answer\
  \ for them, either. Flying solo was better in every way. Though it did mean, at\
  \ times like this, that nobody had her back. </p> \n      <p>\"Zephonith owns you,\
  \ though.\" Smeliel crouched, bringing her closer to Misree's eye level. \"Until\
  \ you pay what's owed.\"</p> \n      <p>Misree had borrowed heavily from Zephonith\
  \ to finance a heist, outfitting the <em>Up and Out</em> with the latest infiltration,\
  \ stealth, and combat tech, all part of a plan to rob the orbital pleasure palace\
  \ of a lashunta oligarch... but it turned out her contact sold the same security\
  \ system plans and station blueprints to <em>another</em> crew: one that managed\
  \ to strike a lot faster. The prize was stolen from Misree, which meant she didn’\
  t have the capital to repay her loan, or even keep up with the eye-watering interest.\
  \ \"I'm going to pay,” Misree said. “In fact, I was just going out to scout a new\
  \ job, so I’d have good news for Zephonith at our meeting.\"</p>&nbsp; \n      <p>Smeliel\
  \ turned her head and looked at the ship. \"You've got everything you need on here,\
  \ don't you?\" Her voice was full of undisguised admiration. \"I had a word with\
  \ the engineers you hired. The <em>Up and Out</em> is a custom-built flying crime\
  \ spree. Seems a shame to leave it in such.... ineffectual hands.\"</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Misree's guts went cold. \"Smeliel, no, you can't—\"</p> \n      <p>\"Half\
  \ the value of that vessel comes from upgrades you made with Zeph's money,\" the\
  \ Vesk said, as if idly musing. \"The other half... should pretty much cover the\
  \ interest, plus a gratuity to thank my employer for not tossing you out an airlock\
  \ for trying to run away today. In which case, you can just transfer the title,\
  \ and we’re done.\" </p> \n      <p>Misree gritted her teeth. \"You can't take my\
  \ ship. She's all I've got. I poured my life into the <em>Up and Out</em>—\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Smeliel clamped an immense clawed hand on Misree's shoulder. \"Then\
  \ don't make me pour your life out all over this hangar deck.\"</p> \n      <p>Did\
  \ you always want to be a hired thug? Was this your childhood dream? Beating people\
  \ up for a crime boss?\" Misree winced at herself. Sometimes her thoughts slipped\
  \ out of her mouth before she could stop them. </p> \n      <p>\"I'm a poet, actually,\"\
  \ Smeliel said, grinding down on Misree’s shoulder. \"That's why I left home, originally—\
  my family didn't understand my dreams. But poetry doesn't pay very well. Not compared\
  \ to enforcing the interests of a local entrepreneur. Sometimes you need a night\
  \ job. I will say, doing this kind of work?\" She showed all her serrated, triangular\
  \ teeth. \"It does give me a great deal of insight into the sapient condition, and\
  \ that's helpful in my art. Maybe I'll write something about you—'An Ode to Misery.'\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"I've never heard a joke like <em>that</em> before,\" Misree said.\
  \ \"Can I at least get my stuff?\"</p> \n      <p>\"You don't have any stuff,\"\
  \ Smeliel said. \"You walk away with your life. And that deal is only good for the\
  \ next minute or so. Transfer the title <em>now</em>.\"</p> \n      <p>Misree looked\
  \ wistfully at the <em>Up and Out</em>—her home, her livelihood, and practically\
  \ her only friend. But you had to know when to let things go, and “two seconds before\
  \ a vesk enforcer splits your head open with a wrench” was an excellent time to\
  \ do so. She tapped a command into her wrist-mounted computer and gave up her one\
  \ true love.</p> \n      <p>Smeliel looked at a readout on her own datapad, grunted,\
  \ and said, “Good choice. I hate getting blood all over my good wrench.” She made\
  \ a shooing gesture. “I'd say 'Don't let me see you on this station again,' but\
  \ since it's a big place, and you don't have access to a vehicle anymore, I'll settle\
  \ for saying, 'Stay out of Zephonith's club.'\"</p> \n      <p>“The drinks are overpriced\
  \ anyway,” Misree muttered. </p> \n      <p>“True,” Smeliel said. “You couldn’t\
  \ afford the cover charge anyway, now that I think about it. Stop loitering around\
  \ my ship.”</p> \n      <p>Misree trudged out of the hangar. At least she didn’\
  t have to sneak through air ducts and service tunnels anymore. She reviewed her\
  \ assets. She still had a day left on the rental for the sleep-pod where she'd been\
  \ hiding out from Zephonith. She had a change of clothes in the bag strapped to\
  \ her back, an ultrathin switchblade in her pocket, and a few credsticks squirreled\
  \ away here and there on the station—she'd learned early in life not to keep everything\
  \ of value in one place. </p> \n      <p>That was the totality of her net worth,\
  \ though, and it wasn’t enough to finance any kind of comeback or fresh start. Ugh.\
  \ Would she be reduced to running short cons on tourists in bars? Or worse, rolling\
  \ drunks and emptying their pockets? She’d never been into strongarm robbery, and\
  \ it was a dangerous proposition. She knew a guy who’d mugged a defenseless-looking\
  \ human who’d turned out to have an integrated cutting torch hidden in a cybernetic\
  \ arm, and everybody called the mugger “Cyclops” now because he only had one eye\
  \ left. But even robbery was a better option than hiring herself out to one of Zephonith's\
  \ competitors, which was her only other plausible path to financial security. It\
  \ was pretty easy to get a job with a crime boss when you had the kind of skills\
  \ and résumé Misree did... but it was really hard to quit that job if you ever wanted\
  \ to move on.</p> \n      <p>She turned onto a crowded thoroughfare, through a gray-market\
  \ bazaar that filled a hub where three corridors intersected. She headed down an\
  \ alley that led to her sleeping pod, one of two dozen stacked cubbyholes, each\
  \ just barely big enough to sleep in. At least her pod was on the bottom level,\
  \ so she didn’t have to climb a rickety ladder to reach—</p> \n      <p>Misree froze.\
  \ The door to her cubby was ajar. In theory it was biometrically locked to her for\
  \ the duration of her rental, but there were ways to spoof the locks, or you could\
  \ always just bribe the manager. Who was inside? Another of Zephonith’s enforcers,\
  \ one who hadn’t been called off yet? </p> \n      <p>She crouched beside an overflowing\
  \ trash bin and watched her door swing all the way open. An android stepped out\
  \ of her room—ebony skinned with a shining bald head of some silver alloy and bright\
  \ yellow eyes, wearing a slick black overcoat. </p> \n      <p>Zephinoth never employed\
  \ androids; Misree didn’t know why, but she assumed she’d been wronged by one too\
  \ many androids on her climb up the crime boss career ladder. Which meant... this\
  \ was some <em>other</em> kind of trouble.</p> \n      <p>The android turned his\
  \ head, his stoic yellow eyes fixing immediately on her. “Misree Ludovic! I’ve been\
  \ looking for you!”</p> \n      <p>Misree ran.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </blockquote>\
