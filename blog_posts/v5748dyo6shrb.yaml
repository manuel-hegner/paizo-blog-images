  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Since the launch of Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition, we’ve released a number of adventures set in the Mwangi Expanse.\
  \ The upcoming Strength of Thousands Adventure Path might be one of the most anticipated,\
  \ but we've also explored the Expanse in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ageOfAshes\"\
  >Age of Ashes</a>, the standalone adventure <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering\"\
  ><em>The Slithering</em></a>, and multiple Pathfinder Society scenarios. Such a\
  \ vast and beautiful locale invariably invites exploration beyond what has already\
  \ been presented, however, and there's no better resource for that than <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq026i4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/62cb1e0c-cc3f-4799-9f30-a155b4acc0a6/073021_AnadiHunter.jpg\"\

  \  <h3>Spidery Friends</h3> \n     <p>Ever since the anadi shyly tiptoed their way\
  \ into Pathfinder near the end of First Edition, our fans have been split between\
  \ those who love anadis and arachnophobes (sorry about that). An anadi named Renali\
  \ showed up in the first book of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path, and she could\
  \ even accompany the heroes of that adventure as they fought off a group of hostile\
  \ invaders in the town of Breachill and beyond. With the release of <em>The Mwangi\
  \ Expanse</em>, anadis are now a playable ancestry—GMs can take cues from these\
  \ rules to give Renali new abilities to help the PCs overcome their challenges,\
  \ or even allow a player to use Renali as a PC!</p> \n     <h3>Slithering Spoilers\
  \ Ahead!</h3> \n     <p>If you're still waiting to experience the events of <em>The\
  \ Slithering</em> unspoiled, then shoo! Get out of here! But if you're a GM seeking\
  \ to build on the framework the adventure provides you, consider checking out <em>The\
  \ Mwangi Expanse</em> as you begin your preparations. Not only does the book contain\
  \ more information on Kibwe, where the events of <em>The Slithering</em> take place,\
  \ it also provides information on the surrounding area, the people who live in the\
  \ city, and recent events that the locals might still be talking about—aside from\
  \ the terrible ooze curse, of course! Would the sudden influx of charau-ka refugees\
  \ from Usaro cause your PCs to raise an eyebrow? Could a visiting Alijae elf from\
  \ the White City of Nagisa have some helpful information to offer? Has a relative\
  \ or friend had a narrow escape from someone looking to cash in on the rumored Aspis\
  \ bounties for kobolds?</p> \n     <p><em>The Slithering</em> sees PCs venture into\
  \ the city of Holy Xatramba to face down a group of demonic cultists. But <em>The\
  \ Mwangi Expanse</em> unveils another resident of that city—the green dragon Olohimba,\
  \ who considers the ruins her domain. Though thoroughly evil and happy to dine on\
  \ any intruders to her realm, she considers herself an orthodox follower of Pharasma\
  \ (and since she isn't a cleric, Pharasma's ban on neutral evil clerics and champions\
  \ can't convince her otherwise!) Olohimba considers it her duty to the Lady of Graves\
  \ to cleanse Holy Xatramba of demons, and she could be swayed to help the PCs in\
  \ their predicament. Is negotiating with a dangerous and powerful draconic patron\
  \ worth the risks? Or would the PCs prefer to take their chances with the demons?</p>\

  \ Prep</h3> \n     <p>If you and your group are planning to play in the upcoming\
  \ Strength of Thousands adventure path, be sure to pack <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em>\
  \ in with your textbooks! Beyond offering a basic history of Old-Mage Jatembe, his\
  \ Ten Magic Warriors, and the founding of the Magaambya, the book also takes a close\
  \ look at the city of Nantambu, where the Adventure Path is set. The book outlines\
  \ all the hottest spots for students looking to spend their free time, from the\
  \ Black Crowned Crane restaurant to the best shops serving alcoholic “Jatembe Juice.”\
  \ Unless, of course, you'd rather spend your nights in your dorm room all alone.\
  \ Even the antisocial can find useful material, however: the ancestry rules for\
  \ some of the Mwangi Expanse's shiest people, from the secretive shisks to the paranoid\
  \ golomas. Whether you're a party animal or a studious scholar, <em>The Mwangi Expanse</em>\
  \ is the book for you!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\"\
