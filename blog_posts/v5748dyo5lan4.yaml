  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, November 25, 2009</p> \n   <p>So, last Saturday\
  \ was one of the most surreal days of my life. Not because I spent it all in Portland,\
  \ Oregon. Not because I watched Jason Bulmahn eat a doughnut that was topped with\
  \ bacon. Not because I spent an hour in an arcade filled with all the best videogaming\
  \ the '80s had to offer. And not because I had a hard time finding Lovecraft books\
  \ that I didn't already have at Powell's World of Books.</p> \n   <p>What made it\
  \ surreal was watching <a href=\"http://www.davinci.pps.k12.or.us/\" target=\"nofollow\"\
  >da Vinci Arts Middle School</a>'s stage production of my adventure, <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/v5748btpy7zkr\">\"Burnt Offerings,\" the first adventure\
  \ in the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>.</p> \n   <p>I'd seen photos of\
  \ the set and costumes already, but I still wasn't sure what to expect. Three cars\
  \ full of Paizo employees and significant others made the day-trip down to Portland,\
  \ but while everyone else spent the day eating Voodoo Doughnuts and playing videogames\
  \ and shopping for books and stuff, I couldn't stop wondering what that night's\
  \ performance was going to be like.</p> \n   <p>In a word, it was INCREDIBLE!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>From the stage dressing to the costumes to the props (real metal weapons!)\
  \ to the special effects (they included the giant hermit crab!) to the acting (including\
  \ songs!) to the directing, it was all jaw-droppingly amazing to see what director\
  \ Tom Beckett created. Looking at the program, I see that there were almost 50 roles\
  \ in the play—and at times, it felt like half of them were all on stage at once!\
  \ One thing in particular that I was incredibly impressed by was how Tom's adaptation\
  \ of the adventure kept a lot of the more mature elements in place—suitably downplayed\
  \ in some areas, but I never really felt like anything was missing. In fact, some\
  \ of Tom's additions to the story (giving Belor Hemlock a son who wants to become\
  \ a hero, or adding a few Skinsaw cultists to the dungeons of Thistletop) were really\
  \ cool, and I wish I'd thought of them to put into the adventure myself!</p> \n\

  \ border=\"0\"></a></td>\n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table>\n   </div> \n\
  \   <p>All in all, it was a fantastic time. We took a few photos after the play\
  \ was over, and the smoke in the air from the special effects or maybe remnants\
  \ of rain on the camera lens made the pictures a little spotty, alas, but you can\
  \ see in the first one how many folks were waiting in line to see the play before\
  \ it began (Note the table with gaming supplies for sale, including several Pathfinder\
  \ products, that local game store Guardian Games set up in the hall!). And in the\
  \ pictures of the cast posing with several of us from Paizo, see how many characters\
  \ from the adventure you can recognize!</p> \n   <p>Also cool: they gave me my own\
  \ dogslicer.</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief</p>\
