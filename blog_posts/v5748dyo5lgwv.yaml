  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Adam Heine</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Warm Bodies</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Seven silvers\
  \ and a copper. Pesh, grit, and other drugs tossed like bread flour. One dead body,\
  \ bled out on the floor of the abandoned hostel. Blit sighed. The Banshees hadn't\
  \ even <i>tried</i> to hide this mess. They relied on him too much lately. Blit\
  \ set down his pack and got to work.</p> \n    <p>The disreputable knew Blit as\
  \ the Patch Man—an ugly demonspawn with a gift for cleaning up after folks. The\
  \ guilds of the Puddles hired him to patch up their problems and keep the city watch\
  \ off their backs. Eighty percent of the time, that required only towels, soap,\
  \ and a meticulous attention to detail (though to be fair, the criminals who made\
  \ their home in the Puddles frequently lacked all three).</p> \n    <p>The rest\
  \ of the time, though, even the most fastidious murderer needed someone with Blit's\
  \ unique skills.</p> \n    <p>He pocketed the money (he considered it a tip) and\
  \ swept the brown grit powder into a bag. The blood was more difficult, but Blit\
  \ had devised a few formulae over the years for just this sort of work. He pulled\
  \ a flask from his coat and sprinkled its contents on the floor where a gallon or\
  \ two of blood had soaked into the wood. The dark stain bubbled and hissed until\
  \ it became an oily, translucent substance, which Blit wiped up with an old rag.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>What had happened here? It looked like a business transaction gone wrong.\
  \ Probably the poor bastard on the floor couldn't pay up, or else he upset someone\
  \ he shouldn't have. Gedrak, most likely; that son of an orc couldn't take an insult\
  \ if you paid him, and his face was eminently insultable. Not that Blit was one\
  \ to talk.</p> \n    <p>Regardless, it was unusually sloppy for the Banshees to\
  \ leave all of this to Blit. He should be glad—sloppy guilds meant steady work for\
  \ him—but every time they pulled him on a job, he was keenly aware of what would\
  \ happen if he missed something. If it meant saving their own skins, <i>nobody</i>\
  \ would hesitate to patch up the Patch Man.</p> \n    <p>Blit slid his hands underneath\
  \ the corpse's arms and hefted the torso experimentally. It weighed about two hundred\
  \ forty, maybe two hundred fifty pounds. Far more than Blit could carry. He reached\
  \ into his coat again and fingered an array of vials. Dozens of them. His extracts.\
  \ None of them were labeled, but even if Blit didn't have a strict organizational\
  \ system, he could identify each one by color, smell, viscosity.</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ selected a bronze liquid with the consistency (though hardly the flavor) of red\
  \ wine. It went down his throat like axle grease, and within moments, he could feel\
  \ the change within him. He put on his pack, which now felt as light as though it\
  \ were empty. Then he grabbed the body by the armpits and hefted it onto his back.\
  \ The arms fell across his chest and he held the wrists in front of him, so it looked\
  \ like he carried a very large, sleeping child. It weighed him down, but with the\
  \ bronze fluid in his system he could walk for miles before the burden even tired\
  \ him.</p> \n    <p>Taking one last look at the scene—clean, but not so clean that\
  \ it might raise suspicion—he turned and walked out of the hostel's double doors.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The goon outside sneered. They always sneered. It had become annoyingly\
  \ predictable. \"Patch Man.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Odim,\" Blit said in return. He pointed\
  \ his chin toward the doors. \"Job's done.\"</p> \n    <p>Odim grunted and went\
  \ inside. He probably thought he was performing a necessary task, checking up on\
  \ Blit's work. But if that thug were capable of the necessary level of scrutiny\
  \ to supervise <i>Blit's</i> work, then he would have pocketed the silvers before\
  \ Blit had even gotten there. No, getting inspected by the Banshees wasn't what\
  \ motivated Blit to do his job well.</p> \n    <p>Now getting <i>killed</i> by the\
  \ Banshees...</p> \n    <p>Odim returned after a minute—not nearly long enough to\
  \ determine whether Blit had done a good job. \"Looks good,\" he said and handed\
  \ Blit a small jingling pouch.</p> \n    <p>Blit knew without opening it that it\
  \ wasn't enough. \"I get ten. Twelve if there's a body.\" He shifted the corpse\
  \ on his back to emphasize the point.</p> \n    <p>Odim shook his fat head. \"Gedrak\
  \ says eight. Says you're getting lazy. You missed something last week.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Lying ratsack. Blit never missed anything. \"What, exactly, did he say I\
  \ missed?\"</p> \n    <p>Odim shrugged. \"Ask him. I just do what I'm told.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Blit let out a weary sigh. If he'd missed something, then Odim was a\
  \ wizard-in-training. But was Gedrak holding out on him or just Odim? \"Tell you\
  \ what. Give me two more, and I won't tell Gedrak you pocketed the rest.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Odim rubbed his chin between thumb and fat forefinger. \"No dice, pinhead.\"\
  \ He referred, of course, to the copious horns spiking out of Blit's skull. \"No\
  \ reason both of us need to be in trouble with the boss.\"</p> \n    <p>Not acting\
  \ on his own, then. But he'd had to think about it, which meant he had the whole\
  \ pay with him.</p> \n    <p>So, Gedrak was afraid of how the Patch Man would react\
  \ to getting stiffed. \"How's this?\" Blit unfolded his legs to their full height,\
  \ putting him eye to eye with the goon. He rested one of his toe claws ever so noticeably\
  \ on Odim's boot and—just for that extra dramatic effect—hissed a phrase in the\
  \ demonic tongue that turned the air around them pitch black. \"You give me <i>all</i>\
  \ the rest, and I let you—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Get off me, imp-cricket.\" Odim lifted\
  \ his foot so suddenly that it threw Blit off balance. He stumbled back. Odim shoved\
  \ him in the chest, knocking him the rest of the way down, causing the dead body\
  \ to flop to the ground next to him.</p> \n    <p>Odim shivered and pulled up his\
  \ jacket collar, though the night was warm enough. He turned his back on Blit and\
  \ hustled up the cobbled alley without another word.</p> \n    <p>Disgusted, but\
  \ not scared. Blit pushed himself off the ground and picked up the body. What an\
  \ idiot he was—probably the only half-demon in all of Avistan who couldn't frighten\
  \ anyone older than six. He still had a corpse to deal with. He produced two more\
  \ vials from his inner pockets and downed them one at a time. Immediately, he disappeared\
  \ (literally—that's the beauty of alchemy) and ran with inhuman speed to Wallow\
  \ Lane.</p> \n    <p>Nobody came to Wallow Lane, so it didn't matter that his invisibility\
  \ wore off by the time he got there. He climbed an old bridge, half of which had\
  \ collapsed into the waves years ago. The ocean lapped at the pillars below. Even\
  \ at low tide, the water was deeper here than anywhere else accessible by land.\
  \ The perfect place to dump a corpse—or dozens of corpses, in Blit's case.</p> \n\
  \    <p>He lugged the body off his back and began tying loose rubble around its\
  \ waist to weigh it down. All the while, he muttered ineffectual curses at Odim,\
  \ at his boss, Gedrak, at <i>all</i> the damn Banshees. Those torble-pods needed\
  \ him, certainly more than he needed them. Why did he play janitor for them and\
  \ let them cheat him at the same time?</p> \n    <p>He knew the answer, of course.\
  \ He'd tried the straight route, many times. It always ended in betrayal. At least\
  \ the Banshees cheated him to his face.</p> \n    <p>He got ready to push the corpse\
  \ off the bridge's broken edge when he caught a glint of something inside the man's\
  \ jacket. <i>Another tip</i>, he thought. Maybe it would make up for what he'd lost.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He reached in, but instead of coins he found a silver crest. He hissed\
  \ through his teeth. This man wasn't some grit addict who wouldn't pay up.</p> \n\
  \    <p>He was city watch.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p>\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> <i>Odim doesn't need to be the Banshees' brains—\
  just their muscle.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>A couple hours later, Blit was face\
  \ first in his third mug at a place called the Puddleglut. The beer tasted like\
  \ rotten lemon juice, but at least the barkeep didn't sneer at him when he ordered,\
  \ and the only other folks who were here at dawn weren't conscious enough to give\
  \ him dirty looks.</p> \n    <p>The watch. What the hell was Gedrak thinking? The\
  \ Banshees were more of a gang than a guild. They couldn't handle this kind of heat.\
  \ They were good enough at what they did, although smuggling drugs and slaves through\
  \ the Puddles wasn't exactly difficult (and considering how often they called upon\
  \ Blit, maybe they weren't even very good at that). What would they do when twenty\
  \ members of the city guard came through the district like drunken hill giants?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"No.\" Blit shook his head, aware that he was muttering aloud, but too\
  \ fuzzed out to decide whether or not he should. \"They can get themselves hanged\
  \ all they want. Ain't my job to care.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit was inculpable, at least\
  \ as much as anyone else in the Puddles. He just cleaned things up, didn't ask questions,\
  \ didn't make trouble (not even when he tried to, apparently). If the watch came,\
  \ he'd just hide out for a while and then work for the next guild to emerge from\
  \ the depths.</p> \n    <p>Unless the Banshees scapegoated him. Shax's knives, that's\
  \ exactly what they'd do.</p> \n    <p>\"Blitterton!\" said a cheerful voice behind\
  \ him.</p> \n    <p>Blit groaned. \"Would someone actually name their <i>child</i>\
  \ that?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, I know Blit's short for <i>something</i>.\" Allyra\
  \ took the stool next to Blit and leaned back against the bar. Her chestnut hair\
  \ fell off bare, muscular shoulders and into a puddle of ale. She didn't seem to\
  \ care. \"Damn, Blit, you look worse than usual.\"</p> \n    <p>He grunted in annoyance.\
  \ \"Thanks.\"</p> \n    <p>She laughed. \"You know what I mean, Blitskin.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Not it either.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Damn.\" She pounded the bar. \"I'll\
  \ figure it out eventually. So what the hell's wrong?\"</p> \n    <p>Blit stared\
  \ into his drink. He was going to tell her, of course. That's why he came here.\
  \ Not for her looks, of course—human beauty was... odd. No, Blit talked to Allyra\
  \ because he'd never met another soul in his life who would willingly start a conversation\
  \ with him that didn't begin with: \"Get out.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Something happened\
  \ at work tonight. I'm not sure what to do about it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Tell me.\"\
  \ She refilled his mug as though she were the waitress—which she was, but you couldn't\
  \ tell since Blit was the only customer with his head upright.</p> \n    <p>\"It's\
  \ that one gang.\"</p> \n    <p>She nodded. \"The smugglers.\" Allyra knew about\
  \ Blit's work—not the details, of course, but enough to know what kind of person\
  \ Blit really was. He had started telling her to disgust her, honestly. To make\
  \ her go away. She never did.</p> \n    <p>In a way, he felt like it absolved him—\
  so long as Allyra listened to him, he couldn't be <i>that</i> bad.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  They're in over their heads, I think.\" And he told her as much of the story as\
  \ he could get away with: about the drugs, the body, the argument he'd had with\
  \ Odim. Always as vague as possible, never naming names and <i>never</i> saying\
  \ the words \"city watch.\"</p> \n    <p>Allyra listened intently, with compassion.\
  \ \"You're afraid someone's going to come after you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Maybe. I guess\
  \ it's always a danger, but...\"</p> \n    <p>She touched him lightly. Not on his\
  \ human arm, but on his scaled leg. \"I won't say you're safe, Blit, 'cause I don't\
  \ know that. But it seems to me your gang has more to worry about than you right\
  \ now. Maybe stay out of it for a while.\" She chuckled. \"Besides, your boss will\
  \ forget in a week. You know how short half-orc memories are.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit\
  \ looked up sharply. He'd never told Allyra that Gedrak was a half-orc. Or had he?\
  \ He couldn't remember now, and the drink wasn't helping. It didn't matter. If she\
  \ knew that much, then Blit was in danger.</p> \n    <p>He slammed the mug onto\
  \ the bar, splattering it. \"I gotta go,\" he slurred and stumbled out into the\
  \ dark predawn.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ was so scared after that, he didn't leave his house for five days. (\"House\"\
  \ was probably a strong term. It was essentially three and a half walls on the roof\
  \ of a rowhouse whose neighbors had collapsed years ago.)</p> \n    <p>How much\
  \ did Allyra know? Who had she told? Probably nobody. She was just a waitress, for\
  \ Aroden's sake. Blit had probably just drunk too much and let slip something he\
  \ shouldn't have.</p> \n    <p>Anyway, Allyra wasn't the real problem. It was Gedrak\
  \ and the watch he was worried about. He should leave town, or at least move, but\
  \ some naive, stupid part of him wouldn't let him until he knew he had no choice.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>His corner of the Puddles stayed quiet until late that Oathday. Someone\
  \ knocked on his door (\"door\" also being a strong term). He peeked over the lip\
  \ of the flat roof to see Odim and another Banshee named Kip in the street. They\
  \ were breathing heavily, as though they'd run halfway across town. Kip rubbed a\
  \ bandaged wound on his arm.</p> \n    <p>\"What do you want?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Patch Man?\" Odim peered up at him, squinting. Humans couldn't see as clearly in\
  \ the dark as Blit could. \"We got... trouble,\" he said between breaths. \"Need\
  \ you... now.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit did nothing for a moment. Odim looked pale. He\
  \ must have known about the dead guard, but that hadn't fazed him at all. Had something\
  \ worse happened?</p> \n    <p>He sighed. He wouldn't refuse them. If he did, he'd\
  \ have to run again, leaving Absalom for good. So long as there was a chance he\
  \ could stay, he'd take it. \"I'll be right down.\"</p> \n    <p>Odim and Kip led\
  \ him a couple miles away, to an old wooden warehouse near the Foreign Quarter.\
  \ They said nothing the whole way, walking faster than Blit would have liked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Odim waved for him to go in and then sat down at the entrance like it\
  \ was a normal job, like he and Kip hadn't shown up at his door with sheet-white\
  \ faces.</p> \n    <p>\"That's it?\" Blit said. \"What happened to you two?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Nothing. Just do your job,\" Odim said, pulling out a cigar. Blit turned\
  \ away, and Odim grabbed his arm. \"But do it fast, yeah? We don't know how much\
  \ time we got.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit nodded and walked into the dark warehouse. Signs\
  \ of struggle were everywhere. Fresh blood, shattered woodwork—<i>recently</i> shattered,\
  \ as evidenced by the splinters dusting the floor and the warhammer near the dead\
  \ body. There were two bodies this time, one of them Gedrak's goon. Blit set his\
  \ pack down to work.</p> \n    <p>As soon as he did, he heard a faint cry. He stiffened.\
  \ The noise had come from inside the warehouse, right next to him, in fact. He turned\
  \ slowly.</p> \n    <p>It didn't take him long to find the source. One of the bodies\
  \ was still alive.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Coming Soon:</b>\
