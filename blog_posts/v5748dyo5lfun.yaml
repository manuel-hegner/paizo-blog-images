  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Josh Vogt</p> \n    <h2>Chapter 3: Lures</h2> \n  \
  \  <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The trio\
  \ hiked along the base of a scraggly knoll under the midday sun. Tali had at least\
  \ stopped complaining about the dirt soiling her dress, and now joined Aberny in\
  \ eyeing the skies for any sign of their foe. Ralynn kept an easy, if steady, pace\
  \ ahead, one blade always out as he scanned the wild brush and every dip and curve\
  \ of the earth in case the chimera crouched in wait.</span></p> \n     <p>When the\
  \ others weren't looking, Aberny wrung a pinky finger in either ear.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>How did he still hear Whistledown's fluting charms in the distance? Even if\
  \ they remained closed enough, normally they only played at night, when the lake\
  \ breezes blew through the village. Had the chimera's attack jarred him more than\
  \ he thought?</p> \n     <p>He tried to distract himself by scanning the rolling\
  \ landscape, with its high grasses, occasional groves, and streams. How did such\
  \ a verdant area host such a deadly creature? Where did it lurk? Chimeras often\
  \ holed up in their dens between meals. Yet this stretch of land lacked any significant\
  \ caves he knew of, having hastily studied a few maps before they set out.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Chimera.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n      <br>Vicious hunger gleams in each set of the chimera's putrid-yellow\
  \ eyes.\n     </div> \n     <p>Not more than half an hour later, Ralynn crouched\
  \ and touched a patch of earth. Aberny and Tali hesitated, checking all about until\
  \ the fighter waved them closer.</p> \n     <p>\"Sign?\" Aberny asked.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Ralynn shook his head and displayed fingers stained with mud. \"Water nearby.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Aberny nodded, but Tali pouted in confusion.</p> \n     <p>\"Water,\"\
  \ the merchant explained, \"suggests a spot where animals might come to drink on\
  \ a regular basis. Tempting for predators.\"</p> \n     <p>They crept forward, weapons\
  \ in Aberny's and Ralynn's hands, a charcoal nub and parchment in Tali's. They crested\
  \ a subtle ridge and found it sloped down sharply into a rockier area, where a stream\
  \ funneled in and formed a wide pool ringed by crumbling earth and stones. The place\
  \ appeared undisturbed, but Aberny well knew appearances deceived only the foolish.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Tali wriggled in delight. \"Gorgeous. I must fix this place in my mind.\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>As she dangled bare feet over the ridge and outlined the geography,\
  \ Ralynn shifted closer to Aberny, voice lowered.</p> \n     <p>\"I think the beast\
  \ is close, but waiting to catch us off guard again. How about we use her as bait?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Aberny narrowed his eyes. \"You're that desperate for the bounty?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Ralynn raised both hands. \"I never make a bet I don't intend to\
  \ win. But I'm not saying we let her get eaten. We'll divert it before it reaches\
  \ her.\"</p> \n     <p>The screams of Aberny's men briefly intruded on his thoughts\
  \ until he shoved them back. He shook his head. \"No. I'll go down with her while\
  \ you watch our backs.\"</p> \n     <p>Ralynn shrugged. \"Won't stop you.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Calling Tali to help him refill their waterskins, Aberny led her into\
  \ the depression, trying not to skid too much on scree and raise a clatter. When\
  \ they reached the pool, he set his staff down and kneeled to cup a palm of water.\
  \ As he swallowed, he glanced at Tali's sketch, noting she'd expertly captured the\
  \ rocky pool, but had added a few embellishments, including scattered animal skeletons\
  \ and the chimera itself crouched among the bodies.</p> \n     <p>\"Preparing a\
  \ morbid masterpiece?\" he asked.</p> \n     <p>She held the parchment out, eyeing\
  \ it critically. \"Hm. Are the bones taking it too far?\" </p> \n     <p>He peered\
  \ at the chimeric figure as she filled in various details. \"Are you managing that\
  \ from memory last night? Impressive.\"</p> \n     <p>She pointed with her charcoal\
  \ nub. \"Oh, no. It's right over there.\"</p> \n     <p>Aberny raised his eyes and\
  \ met the triple gaze of the chimera as it stood from its hiding spot across the\
  \ pool. Its tawny, dappled hide had blended in with the yellow earth and stones,\
  \ and its goat and dragon heads emerged from where they'd been tucked under the\
  \ wings until then. </p> \n     <p>Ralynn must've known it was there the whole time.\
  \ It couldn't have eluded his half-elven sight that easily. </p> \n     <p>The chimera's\
  \ dragon maw drizzled acid, while its goat teeth gnawed a scrap of flesh that Aberny\
  \ hoped didn't come from any of last night's kills. It began prowling around the\
  \ pool toward them. Its ears twitched, and it spoke through its lion head alone\
  \ this time. </p> \n     <p>\"What's it saying?\" Aberny asked Tali.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Her tongue darted over her lips. \"Oh... er... something about me not being\
  \ more than a nibble, while you might make a few mouthfuls.\"</p> \n     <p>Aberny\
  \ rose, taking up his staff and drawing his sword. He used the staff to pull Tali\
  \ along with him as he backed away toward Ralynn's concealed spot on the near ridge.\
  \ But before they took two steps, the chimera filled the area with a three-throated\
  \ roar and a great beat of wings propelled it straight at them.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ first leap sent it splashing into the middle of the pool. The second brought it\
  \ onto the bank before them, where it shook itself like a wet dog, whipping out\
  \ a vortex of water. In the midst of that half-blinding spray, it rushed in. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ralynn's yell resounded as he landed on the chimera's back, swords driving\
  \ down to plunge into its lungs and heart. Its water-slicked fur, though, offered\
  \ no firm footing. He slipped and what might've been a death blow merely scored\
  \ across the beast's ribs. The chimera screeched and reared. Ralynn dropped one\
  \ sword to grab a fistful of fur, holding on as he readied for another strike. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Aberny forced himself forward, spearing the staff at the lion snout\
  \ while chopping the sword whenever the dragon head wove too close. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>The chimera fell back to all fours, and its wings slammed back over Ralynn,\
  \ briefly clamping the fighter against its back. Then the chimera threw itself into\
  \ a roll. Ralynn cried out as the creature's bulk crushed him into the earth, and\
  \ he dropped off to lie stunned in the muddy gravel. </p> \n     <p>The chimera\
  \ flipped back to its feet. Fangs slavered drool and acid as it approached the stunned\
  \ fighter.</p> \n     <p>Then a harsh keening filled the hollow, painful enough\
  \ that Aberny almost dropped his weapons to clamp hands over his ears. The chimera's\
  \ heads swung around to fix on him. The creature growled deep enough to make the\
  \ waters ripple, and snarled in its own tongue. </p> \n     <p>Aberny braced as\
  \ it loped for him. He lashed out when it neared, but a claw struck him across the\
  \ stomach, throwing him aside. He lost staff and sword as he rolled and slammed\
  \ up against the base of the embankment. </p> \n     <p>The keening cut off, followed\
  \ by a shriek from Tali. Aberny's jarred vision cleared just as the chimera flung\
  \ itself into the sky, Tali screaming and writhing in its lion's maw. He stared\
  \ aghast as the chimera made off with their small companion, following the stream\
  \ as it wound out of sight among the hills. Her cries dwindled into nothing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The merchant pushed upright, groaning at a clench of pain where the\
  \ chimera had struck him. His chest would be a mass of bruises, and breathing already\
  \ proved strained. A quick inspection revealed four tears and shallow cuts across\
  \ his torso. Seemed he owed Desna, the goddess of luck, a few prayers. </p> \n \
  \    <p>He struggled to his feet and limped to Ralynn, who lurched up, gasping and\
  \ reaching for his weapons. The half-elf stilled as he realized they stood alone.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What happened? It fled?\"</p> \n     <p>Aberny gestured to Tali's\
  \ parchment, abandoned when the chimera nabbed her. It had fluttered from her grasp\
  \ and landed in the pool, already a pulpy mess. \"Maybe it wants to work up an appetite\
  \ before it feasts.\"</p> \n     <p>Ralynn grimaced and rose to retrieve his short\
  \ swords. Then he grunted and bent over, hand pressed to his side.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Damn it to Hell. Must've broken a rib.\" </p> \n     <p>Aberny rummaged through\
  \ the satchel of food and supplies he'd brought. While several had been smashed\
  \ in his tumble, one healing potion had blessedly survived. He considered his own\
  \ minor wounds and chances for survival. Then he handed the vial to Ralynn, who\
  \ nodded gratefully and downed it. </p> \n     <p>As the fighter recovered, Aberny\
  \ went to where Tali had been standing and closed his eyes to whisper a prayer of\
  \ protection. <i>Desna smile on the gnome, and may she be lucky enough to live,\
  \ despite all odds</i>.</p> \n     <p>When he opened his eyes, his gaze fell on\
  \ an item where Tali had been standing. He bent over to investigate and found...\
  \ a Whistledown charm. The wooden carving formed a complicated spiral, the tip secured\
  \ with a metal hook where it was meant to dangle from eaves or doorways. She must've\
  \ had it altered to produce the music on command, rather than just at night. Had\
  \ she brought it thinking to actually mesmerize the beast or use it as a distracting\
  \ weapon, as she'd just done?</p> \n     <p>He tucked this into a pocket, inert\
  \ for the time. Then he turned to Ralynn, who stretched and twisted to test his\
  \ healed ribs. \"We have to go after her.\"</p> \n     <p>Ralynn frowned. \"Actually,\
  \ I've been rethinking my rule about never backing off from a bet.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Aberny strode over and grabbed the half-elf's collar. Ralynn stiffened, but\
  \ didn't draw a blade.</p> \n     <p>\"You sent us straight into its grasp just\
  \ now, and her potential death is on your soul. You want to leave this hunt a coward?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Ralynn jerked out of his grip and brushed himself off. \"Better a\
  \ coward than dead! And since when have you cared about someone's fate unless they\
  \ put coin in your pocket? Oh, don't look surprised. You act so friendly, buying\
  \ us rounds all night long—but only because we're spilling gossip you can use to\
  \ get better deals. I know how it works.\"</p> \n     <p>\"That was... that was\
  \ idle business. This is life or death!\" </p> \n     <p>\"Thought it was all the\
  \ same to you.\"</p> \n     <p>Aberny threw up his hands and spun away, sick of\
  \ them both.</p> \n     <p>Ralynn's voice softened. \"Look, there's no shame in\
  \ knowing when to cut your losses. The biggest payoff doesn't mean a thing if you\
  \ aren't alive to collect it. Even if we find wherever it's hauled her off to, we'll\
  \ be walking straight into its territory. And it has a hostage.\"</p> \n     <p>Aberny\
  \ stared into the water as if it might offer a solution. Then he focused on his\
  \ reflection and realized he still had certain resources available. Best use them.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>He turned back to the fighter. \"I'll make you an offer.\" </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ralynn eyed him in suspicion. \"Like?\" </p> \n     <p>\"Help me rescue\
  \ her, and the bounty, plus a thousand from me, is yours. You don't even have to\
  \ kill the chimera. Just as long as she lives.\"</p> \n     <p>The half-elf blinked.\
  \ \"You're serious.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Entirely.\"</p> \n     <p>Ralynn scowled,\
  \ looking like a trapped beast himself, sleek figure coiled as if ready to sprint\
  \ for freedom. Then he sighed and straightened. \"Fine. You've got a deal.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Relieved, if slightly, Aberny pointed out the direction the beast had\
  \ flown. He and Ralynn followed the river, finding it broadened farther up and cut\
  \ through a ravine that would've been invisible from their trek up in the fields.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>At last, Ralynn crouched and pulled Aberny down with him. He pointed\
  \ ahead. The stream poured out from a wide crevice, not a hundred paces ahead. Half-hidden\
  \ by overgrown grasses, the opening led into the earth beneath a large hill. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>They split up and approached the crevice from opposing angles. One sword\
  \ readied, Ralynn eased up and peered inside for a moment. Then he slipped in.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Aberny held his breath until the half-elf leaned back out and waved\
  \ him on.</p> \n     <p>Once beyond the low stony lip, the ceiling quickly rose\
  \ enough for standing room, and outside light reached past to show a natural tunnel\
  \ leading into the depths of the hill. They paused, listening.</p> \n     <p>Tali's\
  \ voice echoed from somewhere deeper in, indistinct. A guttural murmur followed,\
  \ as if she conversed with the chimera.</p> \n     <p>Aberny's heart rose. Alive!\
  \ But not for long if they bungled this. </p> \n     <p>Ralynn took the lead, using\
  \ his heightened sight to guide them. After creeping through a darker section, light\
  \ once more appeared ahead. After ten paces, the tunnel ended, exiting onto a wide\
  \ ledge that curved around the edges of an earthy cavern.</p> \n     <p>The chimera's\
  \ den lay within the hollow hill, the walls all root-snaked dirt and rock. Several\
  \ wide cracks allowed shafts of sunlight in, illuminating the scene below as the\
  \ pair sneaked to the edge. </p> \n     <p>Tali stood before the chimera, which\
  \ lay basking in a narrow splay of sun, forepaws crossed, tail twitching. All three\
  \ heads watched her, cocked as if fascinated by this odd creature it had brought\
  \ back.</p> \n     <p>All around them lay spines and skulls and femurs of a dozen\
  \ different creatures, including at least a few humanoids by Aberny's estimation.\
  \ Tali had gathered a pile of bones and now worked them together, linked and stacked\
  \ into a grisly sculpture—a fragile spread of ribs that evoked wings. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"See?\" she said, as she crafted the piece. \"Even in death, there's beauty.\
  \ Think of it! If you let me live, I could craft you a gorgeous necklace out of\
  \ nothing but vertebrae and finger bones. I don't suppose you have any gems lying\
  \ about? Those could be socketed to enhance your natural glory. No? Pity. But one\
  \ must work with what one has.\"</p> \n     <p>Ralynn and Aberny drew back while\
  \ the chatter continued below.</p> \n     <p>\"I don't suppose you'd let me paint\
  \ you? Trap your essence for all to admire?\"</p> \n     <p>Ralynn made several\
  \ circling and grasping gestures with one hand. Aberny shook his head, not understanding.\
  \ Did he think to try and sneak down the ledge without drawing the beast's attention?\
  \ Or attempt another leap onto the chimera's back? </p> \n     <p>\"Oh! Have I mentioned\
  \ how I love the way your fur absolutely traps the light? Divine.\" </p> \n    \
  \ <p>At Ralynn's impatient pushing motions, Aberny edged along where the ledge sloped\
  \ toward the cave floor. The half-elf nodded, moving the opposite direction. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I once saw a chimera trapped in a menagerie, you know. Such a horrible\
  \ thing to do to such a magnificent beast.\"</p> \n     <p>A snuffling made him\
  \ freeze. The chimera's gravelly voice rose, the words alien, but the tone unmistakable.\
  \ It had detected the intruders.</p> \n     <p>Tali sighed. \"For Shelyn's sake.\
  \ It's a fools-be-damned trap. Run!\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next\
