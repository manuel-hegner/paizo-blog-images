  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, January 31, 2012</p> \n   <p>Behold, the beaming\
  \ excitement of the new interns! (Shhhh... Don’t tell them that enthusiasm is about\
  \ to wither away as they enter the Editorial Pit of Despair known as crosschecking\
  \ every feat, spell, trait, and magic item in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ld1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a>.) Everybody, please give a warm welcome Alexandra\
  \ and Jerome!</p> \n   <p>Christopher Carey<br> <i>Editor</i></p> \n   <p>Hi, I’\
  m Alexandra and I’m a new Paizo intern here in the Editorial Department. I’m not\
  \ quite sure exactly everything I’ll be doing, but I’m very excited! I’ll know I’\
  ll be showing up around the messageboards so here’s a little about me:</p> \n  \
  \ <p>I’m currently going to college and finishing up my AA in Digital Gaming while\
  \ working about 25 hours a week at my part-time job, doing this internship, and\
  \ trying to have a social life. In my free time, I love to play RPG games and post\
  \ on Tumblr. My friends and I run a Dragon Age fan blog there. Dragon Age is one\
  \ of my favorite games but I’m currently playing Skyrim whenever I can. I really\
  \ like to read fanfiction and write my own short stories. My favorite TV show is\
  \ Supernatural, and even though it’s totally ruined now I still love it.</p> \n\
  \   <p>I’ve lived in the same place forever, so after I get settled with my life,\
  \ I hope to do a lot of traveling and exploring of other cultures to feed my inspiration.\
  \ I’d love to go all over Europe and Southeast Asia and check out all the fashion\
  \ and food. I’m Jewish, so I’d also love to visit Israel and finally learn Hebrew.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Well, there’s me. Thanks for reading!</p> \n   <p>Alexandra Schecterson<br>\
  \ <i>Editorial Intern</i></p> \n   <p>Hello!</p> \n   <p>This is Jerome, one of\
  \ the new interns here at Paizo Publishing. It’s my first month on the job, and\
  \ I’m excited to discover what makes Pathfinder tick. At first blush, the answers\
  \ seem to be coffee, banter, and hoards of figurines!</p> \n   <p>I’m a relative\
  \ neophyte to the RPG scene, having discovered Pathfinder only a few years ago.\
  \ However, in the short time that I’ve been playing and GMing, I’ve become enamored\
  \ of the creativity and collaborative spirit that Pathfinder brings out in people.\
  \ I’m excited to see those same attitudes at work within the Paizo staff.</p> \n\
  \   <p>I’m a long-time strategy and athletic gamer with roots in Go, soccer, and\
  \ 8-bit cartridges. I continue to game regularly, and have burgeoning interest in\
  \ independent game design. I’ve also pursued (with varying degrees of success) kung\
  \ fu, story games, Starcraft, ballroom dancing, and girls. My childhood habit of\
  \ reading has blossomed into a love of writing that promises to delight and infuriate\
  \ me to the grave and beyond. Hopefully I’ll have the chance to try my hand at writing\
  \ for Paizo someday soon!</p> \n   <p>I’m excited to be working with Paizo, and\
  \ look forward to seeing you all on the messageboards!</p> \n   <p>Good Gaming,</p>\
