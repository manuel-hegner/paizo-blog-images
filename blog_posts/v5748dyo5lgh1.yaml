  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Illustration by Ian Llanas</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>The origins\
  \ of the Iron Gods Adventure Path itself are pretty clear. The seeds of advanced\
  \ technology in Golarion go back to its inception, and descriptions of Numeria,\
  \ Alkenstar, the Red Redoubt of Karamoss, and the Ruins of Kho have always included\
  \ a level of technology much different than most of the rest of the Inner Sea. Golarion\
  \ is a world where scraps of ancient lost technology exist in limited quantities,\
  \ and it makes sense that at least one adventure path explore that aspect of the\
  \ world. This follows a long tradition of mixing science fiction and fantasy elements\
  \ in roleplaying games, dating back to near the beginning of the hobby.</p> \n \
  \    <p>The RPG hobby is in turn built on a long tradition of genre-blurring stories,\
  \ dating back to at least the early 1700s. Earlier speculative fiction didn't mostly\
  \ bother to define a difference between science fiction and fantasy. Jonathan Swift's\
  \ 1726 novel <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> was written as a satire, but it is also arguably\
  \ an early work of mixed science fiction and fantasy. Beyond the well-known fantasy\
  \ races of Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians, protagonist Gulliver encounters many\
  \ other places including both the flying city of Laputa (a city of pure scientific\
  \ thought and clear antecedent of Kho), and a land of magicians (Glubbdubdrib) where\
  \ magic largely replaces technology.</p> \n     <p>Although not the same as most\
  \ modern fantasy, another common category of early speculative fiction that often\
  \ blends advanced technology and magic is the \"lost world\" genre, where a modern\
  \ character discovers a fantastic land unknown to the rest of civilization. In some\
  \ lost world books the discovery is the result of an exploratory expedition (such\
  \ as is the case for Jules Verne's 1864 novel <i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i>,\
  \ an early example of the genre), while in other cases the discovery is entirely\
  \ accidental (as in Edward Bulwer-Lyrtton's 1871 novel <i>Vril, the Power of the\
  \ Coming Race</i>).</p> \n     <p>Similar is the planetary romance genre, where\
  \ the foreign land is generally on other planets. One can argue that Edgar Rice\
  \ Burrough's Barsoom (from <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, and a series of novels that\
  \ follow) is pure science fiction, with its airships and radium pistols, but the\
  \ fact that most conflict is handled through swordplay reveals its fantasy roots.\
  \ The blending of science and magic is even clearer in related stories by Burroughs,\
  \ the most obvious example being \"The Wizard of Venus,\" where planetary explorer\
  \ Carson Napier learns extraordinary powers from the titular Venusian wizard.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb120\">\n      <a href=\"/products/btpy8xa5\"><img src=\"\
  /image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO8004_120.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Many novels\
  \ of the 1930s-1970s combined fantasy and science fiction in one setting, often\
  \ inspired by the tradition of Barsoom and the planetary romances. The fiction of\
  \ Michael Moorcock is one of the original influences for fantasy RPG settings, and\
  \ includes multiple cases of high science elements. Most extensively, the adventures\
  \ of Hawkmoon (who, as an incarnation of the Eternal Champion, is connected to the\
  \ better-known Elric of Melniboné,) take place in a world that appears to be a post-apocalyptic\
  \ version of Europe. Magic is commonplace, but sorcerer-scientists also often have\
  \ access to ancient advanced technology, including the Black Jewel, which is implanted\
  \ into Hawkmoon by his enemies to monitor his movements. Ursula K. Le Guin's 1966\
  \ novel <i>Rocannon's World</i> has fewer directly magic elements, but does describe\
  \ the travels of a scientist with advanced knowledge through an alien land of castes\
  \ and swordsmen. Poul Anderson's 1961 novel <i>Three Hearts</i> and <i>Three Lions</i>\
  \ presents a protagonist from the modern \"real\" world who ends up in a parallel\
  \ world where magic and trolls are real.</p> \n     <p>Instances where science fiction\
  \ elements enter an existing, established pure-fantasy setting are less common but\
  \ far from unknown. Robert E. Howard's fantasy character Conan encounters an alien\
  \ in the 1933 short story \"The Tower of the Elephant.\" Fritz Leiber's quintessential\
  \ rogue and barbarian team Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser run into a time traveler in\
  \ his 1968 novel <i>The Swords of Lankhmar</i>. Time travel and planetary travel\
  \ both come into play in C.L. Moore and Henry Kuttner's 1937 story \"Quest of the\
  \ Starstone,\" in which fantasy swordswoman Jirel of Joiry must deal with Northwest\
  \ Smith, a smuggler and scoundrel hired from a tavern on Mars in her own far-flung\
  \ future. (Those interest in seeing how that particular situation is resolved can\
  \ read the story in <a href=\"/products/btpy8xa5\"><i>Black God's Kiss</i></a>,\
  \ still available from paizo.com.)</p> \n     <p>The existence of fantasy tales\
  \ that added a dash of high science is no reason for groups that dislike blending\
  \ the two ideas to feel they must change their minds, but it is one of the reasons\
  \ other groups love having the option to through a little more sci-fi into their\
  \ fantasy games.</p> \n     <p>Owen K.C. Stephens<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n  \
