  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Earlier today, we previewed\
  \ one of our scenarios releasing today. Now it is time to present <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021b9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-207-Four-for-the-First\"\
  >Starfinder Society #2-07: Four for the First</a>. This scenario represents a major\
  \ step for the Organized Play Campaign, as we introduce players to the four potential\
  \ new leaders of the Starfinder Society!</p> \n     <p><i>Four for the First</i>\
  \ acts in many ways like a quest pack-style scenario as the core revolves around\
  \ thefour candidates seeking the mantle of First Seeker. The PCs partake in four\
  \ distinct quests, each pertaining to an area of interest to one of the four candidates.\
  \ That is where the similarity to standard scenarios ends. Unlike most scenarios,\
  \ we highly encourage groups to book as much time as needed to complete this adventure,\
  \ even if that requires booking this over multiple game sessions—we really want\
  \ to make sure each of our candidates has a time to shine!</p> \n     <p>Speaking\
  \ of our candidates, let’s get a quick preview of each potential First Seeker.</p>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li>Calder Soren is morlamaw (detailed in Alien Archive 3)\
  \ who’s risen within the Society and has a desire to see the establishment and recovery\
  \ of lodges out in Near Space and the Vast.</li> \n      <li>Avor Stelek is a red-skinned\
  \ Akitonian (also known as a hylki) who’s both a doctor and a swordsman. He looks\
  \ to recruit new agents and to protect those new recruits.</li> \n      <li>Tara\
  \ Nova is a vidcaster who wants to bring the Society to new levels of fame. She\
  \ doesn’t believe that old foes have suffered enough for their past transgressions\
  \ and looks to ensure other organizations don’t interfere with the Society.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Ehu Hadif Ko'Ra Amares of Clan Tolar is a kasatha who believes that\
  \ the Society still has much to learn from the past. Ehu wants the Society to investigate\
  \ past mysteries, and his goals are set to take the Starfinder Society back to the\
  \ library world of Athaeum.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Now the logistics: Voting opens <b>Wednesday, September\
  \ 25th, 2019, at 4 pm Pacific</b> time, and closes <b>November 20th, 2019, at noon\
  \ Pacific</b> time. We hope leaving a wide window between scenario launch and the\
  \ end of voting offers our players opportunity to interact with all candidates before\
  \ voting. Each player may experience the scenario multiple times (replayable, right?!?),\
  \ just with different characters, and we encourage multiple playthroughs. Getting\
  \ to know the candidates is important, as each player may only vote once no matter\
  \ how many times their characters play the adventure, so be sure to get all the\
  \ replays in before placing your vote. </p> \n     <p>For players who don’t play\
  \ the scenario during the voting window, no problem! The scenario remains playable\
  \ (and repeatable) after November 20th, players just don’t get the opportunity to\
  \ vote for the new First Seeker. </p> \n     <p>We chose Survey Monkey as our platform.\
  \ Once you’ve played the scenario, return here and <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZBHK3JQ\"\
  >click here to vote!</a> We will also post links to the voting on Facebook and Twitter\
  \ so that more people can find the survey, as well as post some reminders during\
  \ the voting period. We would also appreciate any procedural feedback as comments\
  \ on this thread, to help us refine our processes should we do something similar\
  \ in the future.</p> \n     <p>Next week, join us for the October installment of\
  \ our regular feature - Stars, Cons, Spotlights!</p> \n     <p>Looking forward to\
  \ the all votes,</p> \n     <p>Thurston Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder Society Developer</i></p>\
