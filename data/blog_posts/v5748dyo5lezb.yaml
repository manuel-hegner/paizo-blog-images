  \ itemprop=\"description\"><p><a href=\"/products/btpy8yw8\"><i>Player Companion:\
  \ Faiths &amp; Philosophies</i></a> is on its way to store shelves and subscribers'\
  \ hands, and I couldn't be more excited about this book! When threads pop up on\
  \ our messageboards with questions like \"<a href=\"/threads/rzs2pvxl\">Is it even\
  \ possible for a cleric to not be some deity-worshiping fanatic?</a>\" and \"<a\
  \ href=\"/threads/rzs2puse\">How much do the deities â€˜talk' to their followers?</a>\"\
  , it warms my heart to see that fans are truly ready for a book like <i>Faiths &amp;\
  \ Philosophies</i>, which is much unlike any other book we've ever done!</p></span>\
  \ \n     <p>In addition to answering these sorts of questions and more, this Player\
  \ Companion hosts a <i>bunch</i> of super-cool new ways to practice worship and\
  \ religion while also allowing characters to try out entirely new ways of finding\
  \ spiritual enlightenment. In no particular order (just kidding, it's alphabetical),\
  \ here's a list of the features in this book I'm most excited about:</p> \n    \
  \ <ul> \n      <li><b>Codes of Honor</b>: Ever wonder how you could get in good\
  \ with the Knights of Ozem? How about the Red Mantis Assassins? Wonder no more!\
  \ The new codes of honor in this book tie in perfectly with the rules for honor\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy8x64\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</i></a>,\
  \ and provide guidelines for gaining prestige within many of Golarion's most fabled\
  \ organizations.</li> \n      <li><b>Meditation Feats</b>: Now your monk has a reason\
  \ to sit and ponder while the wizard prepares her spells and the cleric prays to\
  \ his deity! By meditating every day, any character with a couple of these feats\
  \ can unlock powerful new abilities that allow you to channel your insight into\
  \ perilous situations, shield your body from deadly blows, and even slow down time\
  \ as you perceive it!</li> \n      <li><b>Pantheons</b>: This book delves into the\
  \ unique sets of deities worshiped by groups such as the Hellknights' Order of the\
  \ Godclaw and Taldor's zealous nationalists and even details some of Vudra's thousands\
  \ of deities! The pantheons discussed in this book provide a slew of ideas for characters\
  \ that worship more than one deity, and the new Pantheistic Blessing feat grants\
  \ believers some impressive divine powers should they uphold the tenets of their\
  \ diversified faith.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>I'd hate to spoil too much more,\
  \ so I'll just leave you all with a single piece of the awesome art that appears\
  \ in this book. Polish your holy symbols and get ready to cast some bones, because\
  \ <i>Faiths &amp; Philosophies</i> ships soon!</p> \n     <p>Patrick Renie<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
