  \ and enthusiasm for the next edition of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game. The upcoming\
  \ playtest is a vital part of making sure Starfinder Second Edition will be the\
  \ best possible game it can be! Your feedback is indispensable to our process, and\

  \ <p>The easiest way to playtest is to explore the material, cooperate with other\
  \ players, and report back using our surveys! There will be four surveys: the <strong>Class\
  \ Survey</strong> asks specific questions about your character choices and experiences,\
  \ the <strong>Class Open Response Survey </strong>that allows for more freeform\
  \ feedback about each of our six classes, the <strong>Game Feedback Survey</strong>\
  \ that lets you provide feedback about any other material in the <em>Starfinder\
  \ Playtest Rulebook</em>, and the <strong>Adventure Feedback Survey</strong> where\
  \ you can share your experiences and feedback about our playtest adventures!&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p>You can find the playtest and all supplementary information at<a href=\"\
  http://www.starfinderplaytest.com/\"> StarfinderPlaytest.com</a></p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h2>When We Playtest</h2>\n      <p>The <em>Starfinder Playtest Second Edition\
  \ Rulebook</em>, our first two playtest adventures, and the playtest surveys go\
  \ live on August 1 at 10 a.m. EST. The Playtest Rulebook PDF is free and the necessary\
  \ rules from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej2?Pathfinder-Player-Core\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Core</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eok?Pathfinder-GM-Core\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder GM Core</em></a> can be found online with our partners at <a href=\"\
  https://2e.aonprd.com/\">Archives of Nethys</a>. The playtesting period lasts until\
  \ December 31, 2024, when the surveys officially close. You can go back and modify\
  \ your survey at any point during the playtest period, so don’t wait until the last\
  \ minute thinking you’ve tried every class or run every adventure.</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h2>What We Playtest</h2>\n      <p>We’re releasing two Starfinder adventures\
  \ and four scenarios during the playtest period that help support the playtest itself.\
  \ These adventures and scenarios feature a wide variety of challenges and encounters\
  \ as the playtests focus on player facing options. We won’t spoil anything here\
  \ for our players who want to avoid spoilers, but you can read more about each adventure\
  \ on their accompanying product pages!<br><br><strong>Playtest Scenarios</strong>\
  \ are one-shots that should take roughly 2 hours to play, but can be used as a launching\
  \ point or side quest during a longer ongoing campaign.<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02jnz?Starfinder-Playtest-Scenario-1-Shards-of-the-Glass-Planet\"\

  \ Jarzabski is a 15th-level scenario coming out late October.</p>\n      <p><strong>Playtest\
  \ Adventures</strong> are longer self-contained adventures that should take multiple\
  \ sessions to complete and take characters across multiple levels. These adventures\
  \ are great introductions to the Starfinder setting and help players experience\
  \ two major events taking place in our setting.<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez5?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday\"\

  \ Thurston Hillman begins at 10th-level and will be released in October<em>.</em></p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Home game</strong> data will be immensely helpful during the playtest\
  \ process. GMs are highly encouraged to use monsters and other threats from the\
  \ playtest adventures or Pathfinder Second Edition sources like <em>Pathfinder Monster\
  \ Core</em>. Additional guidelines to running adventures during the playtest can\
  \ be extrapolated using <em>Pathfinder GM Core</em>. We suggest avoiding variant\
  \ rules during the playtest period, such as free archetype rules or proficiency\
  \ without level.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Who We Playtest</h2>\n      <p>When\
  \ building characters, stick to the official character creation guidelines as much\
  \ as possible. We will have pregenerated characters for every class available during\
  \ the playtest, with character sheets you can print out at home that include all\
  \ the information you need to play each character.</p>\n      <p>Players should\
  \ avoid using Pathfinder Second Edition ancestries, backgrounds, classes, equipment,\
  \ and feats that aren’t explicitly included in the playtest. Note that most of the\
  \ skill feats and some class feats from <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> have been\
  \ included in the skill feat tables and are part of the playtest. Spells should\
  \ be selected from the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> and <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em>.\
  \ While these options are available, we encourage players to try the new feats and\
  \ spells from the <em>Starfinder Playtest Core Rulebook</em> to provide us with\
  \ new data.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Where We Playtest</h2>\n      <p>Gen Con\
  \ and other major conventions, both in person and online, provide ample opportunity\
  \ for playtesting. Finding a local or online Starfinder Society lodge is a surefire\
  \ way to find people interested in playtesting, and you can find out how all these\
  \ adventures fit into our Organized Play Program<a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6uw6x?Starfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Playtest\"\
  > here</a>.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Why We Playtest</h2>\n      <p>The entire\
  \ team is grateful for everyone’s enthusiasm and excitement as we venture into this\
  \ new era of adventure! Paizo has a long tradition of playtesting new material,\
  \ and the data you provide playing our games is critical to our process and morale\
  \ (after all, nothing encourages a game developer like hearing about people playing\
  \ our games)! While we prioritize the data we get from the playtest surveys, the\
  \ Starfinder team actively reads and welcomes your thoughts on many social media\
  \ platforms and communities including our own<a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/secondEditionPlaytest\"\
