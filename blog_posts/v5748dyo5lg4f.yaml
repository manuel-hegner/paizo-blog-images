  >We're only a couple of weeks from the release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"\
  >Reign of Winter</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures! In recent months I've previewed\
  \ all 45 figures in that set, and I'm hoping you're looking forward to it with eager\
  \ anticipation. I know I can't wait to add the set to my personal collection.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>But these days I'm spending all of my minis time focused on the next\
  \ set, <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a>, which is currently scheduled\
  \ for a November release. Unlike the previous few sets, <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"\
  >The Lost Coast</a> does not take its inspiration from a specific Pathfinder <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Adventure Path</a>. Instead, the general theme\
  \ for <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a> is the Lost Coast of Varisia,\
  \ a monster-filled region that's been the setting of several of our Adventure Paths,\
  \ including previous <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> sets <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> and\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">The Shattered Star</a>. </p> \n    <p>This approach\
  \ has given me the opportunity to fill a few gaps from those previous sets. One\
  \ of my favorites, and certainly among the figures sure to get the most table use\
  \ in the entire set, are the Small elementals presented below.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_AirElemental_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_AirElemental_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have an excellent wisp of a mini-tornado\
  \ just waiting to blow away your player characters (or, since these creatures are\
  \ frequently summoned by PCs, your other monsters). We'll do a little more work\
  \ matching the final colors to the air elementals in <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\"\
  >The Shattered Star</a>—clear plastic figures always require a bit more tinkering\
  \ at the factory stage—but this sculpt perfectly captures the Tyler Walpole original,\
  \ which first appeared in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tj5\">Pathfinder Pawns Bestiary\
  \ Box</a>. It's a bit difficult to see in the photo, but in hand this figure has\
  \ incredible dimensionality. He is, naturally, smaller than the other air elementals\
  \ we've done, but this guy holds his own in the cool department. The Small Air Elemental\
  \ is a Small, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_EarthElemental_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_EarthElemental_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This guy is a Small, awesome version of\
  \ the earth elementals in <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">The Shattered Star</a>.\
  \ Like those figures, he comes complete with shiny green crystals emerging from\
  \ his back. As a whole, he appears to be burrowing up from underground, a common\
  \ feature of his larger brethren. As with the other elementals in today's preview,\
  \ there's a bit more work to be done to get the color match perfect, but I think\
  \ we're pretty close. The Small Earth Elemental is a Small, common figure.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_FireElemental_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_FireElemental_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Another figure sure to get a lot of use,\
  \ the Small Fire Elemental is absolutely magnificent, managing to be thin, Small,\
  \ and imposing all at the same time. The sculpt has an enormous amount of flame\
  \ texture detail that's really brought out by drybrushing, making this a fantastic\
  \ addition to your fire elemental horde! The Small Fire Elemental is a Small, common\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_WaterElemental_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_WaterElemental_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week is the Small Water Elemental,\
  \ perhaps my favorite of the quartet. There's just so much fluid motion to this\
  \ figure that I'm amazed it's so small. It probably has the best use of clear plastic\
  \ of the bunch. The Small Water Elemental is a Small, common figure.</p> \n    <p>And\
  \ that's it for this week. There are a ton more awesome figures to come in the next\
  \ several weeks. Come back next Friday to see what we preview next!</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ the meantime, please consider setting up an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing\
  \ Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a> to Pathfinder Battles to make sure you\
  \ don't miss a single figure!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br \\> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
