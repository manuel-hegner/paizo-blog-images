  date\">Monday, February 9, 2009</p> \n   <p>I'm excited to welcome a few new faces\
  \ to the Paizo offices: David Eitelbach and Hank Woon, our enthusiastic new editorial\
  \ assistants! David and Hank are going to help us here in the pit with… well… pretty\
  \ much everything and anything we can come up with—and not a moment too soon! Expect\
  \ to see them posting on the boards, blogging about all the cool stuff that crosses\
  \ their desks, and overall giving us a fresh look inside the Paizo offices. If you\
  \ have any questions for Dave and Hank, or just want to say \"hi,\" be sure to drop\
  \ them a \"welcome aboard\" post!</p> \n   <p>But that's enough out of me. First\
  \ up, meet Hank Woon, and tomorrow we'll check in with David.</p> \n   <p>F. Wesley\

  9\"> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Hello Paizo readers! This is my first blog for Paizo.\
  \ Who am I, and why am I wasting your time, you ask? I am like you: fan, gamer,\
  \ and enthusiastic supporter of <i>Pathfinder.</i> But, unlike you, I am not constrained\
  \ by the typical boundaries set by the stifling paradigm known as \"acceptable social\
  \ behavior\" or ridiculous and outrageous theories like \"the law.\" So, through\
  \ some cunning intelligence-gathering, I managed to locate the address of Paizo's\
  \ hidden fortress, deep within the unforgiving wilds of Bellevue, Washington, and\
  \ with no hesitation, set off on a quest to plunder its secrets. </p>\n   <p>Determined\
  \ to unravel the delicate mysteries shrouded within, I cleverly forced my way through\
  \ an unlocked hidden portal marked \"Enter.\" Unfortunately, I was soon captured\
  \ by Paizo's roving band of tiny, rabid, ninja robots (spawned from the unholy union\
  \ of spare computer parts and chewing gum, these deceptively fast mechanical menaces\
  \ are fanatically loyal to the Paizo team).</p> \n   <p>Now the Paizos have me lashed\
  \ to a desk, and as punishment are forcing me to edit documents for them. The foolish\
  \ mortals knew not that this is exactly what I wanted! When they are not looking\
  \ (or throwing thumb tacks at me, as they are wont to do), I shall leak information\
  \ about the inner workings of this academy of dark sorcerers; not just the docile,\
  \ politically-correct image they put forth, oh no, no, no... The truth is much more\
  \ interesting. There is danger, excitement, romance, adventure... and of course,\
  \ the robots.</p> \n   <p>Stay tuned.</p> \n   <p>Hank Woon <br>Paizo Editorial\
