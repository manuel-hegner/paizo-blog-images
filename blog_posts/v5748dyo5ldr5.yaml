  \ vast cavern was the crunch of their boots on the frost-covered stone. Up ahead,\
  \ nestled between drifts of snow and covered in a glaze of shimmering ice, was the\
  \ treasure that the pair had heard so much about. Not two weeks ago, while talking\
  \ to a drunken sod who had lost four fingers to the cold, Valeros had learned about\
  \ the treasure of the white wyrm. Now both he and Merisiel were here, ready to plunder\
  \ the vast fortune.</i></p> \n    <p><i>\"I told you the beast was probably dead,\"\
  \ Merisiel said, scanning the cavern. \"No one has heard from it in years. Even\
  \ that old fool said as much.\"</i></p> \n    <p><i>\"Maybe it flew south for the\
  \ winter,\" Valeros replied with a snort as he retrieved the sacks from his pack.\
  \ After taking just one step forward, the grin slid from his face as a blast of\
  \ freezing cold erupted from the shadows at the back of the cavern. The blast brought\
  \ the warrior to his knees, ice coating his hands, arms, and face.</i></p> \n  \
  \  <p><i>Merisiel wisely leaped behind a gigantic icy stalagmite to avoid the frosty\
  \ breath of the ancient white dragon that emerged from the shadows...</i></p> \n\
  \   </blockquote> \n   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">We are under 2 weeks away\
  \ from the release of <a href=\"/products/btpy8rcd\"><i>Ultimate Equipment</i></a>.\
  \ This week's preview takes a look at the treasure horde of a CR 15 ancient white\
  \ dragonâ€”not that poor Valeros and Merisiel are destined to get their hands on it.</span></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Dragons are known for their vast treasure hoards, and thus have access\
  \ to the mighty treasure types H and I. Since they also have triple the normal amount\
  \ of treasure, we have a total of 87,000 gp worth of loot to distribute. Let's start\
  \ with something big and spend 75,000 gp on a big roll on treasure type I and then\
  \ let's fill it out with some lesser loot from treasure type C.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Treasure Type I: Treasure Hoard</b><br> <b>75,000 gp Reward (total\
  \ value 69,120 gp)</b><br> 50,000 cp, 6,000 sp, 400 gp, 70 pp, <i>avalanche shield,\
  \ ring of energy shroud (cold), staff of tricks, wand of sleet storm</i>, flawless\
  \ star sapphire (worth 7,000 gp), platinum scepter with gold inlay (worth 1,200\
  \ gp)</p> \n    <p><b>Treasure Type C: Art Objects</b><br> <b>10,000 gp Reward plus\
  \ a 2,000 gp Reward (total value 11,900 gp)</b><br> unmelting ice shard (worth 10,000\
  \ gp), platinum censer with ornate markings (worth 800 gp), decorated platinum plate\
  \ (worth 1,100 gp)</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>I am not even sure they would\
  \ be able to carry that many coins out of the lair, since they weigh more than 1,100\
  \ pounds, but I am sure they would try. The treasure for this hoard could have taken\
  \ a number of different paths, focusing instead on a mountain of lesser items, such\
  \ as (undoubtedly frozen) potions, wands, and scrolls, as you might typically find\
  \ on the table for treasure type I, but since this is a dragon hoard, I thought\
  \ it would be best to stick with a mountain of coins, with a variety of valuable\
  \ objects sticking out of the heap.</p> \n   <p>That brings to a close this week's\
  \ treasure roll. Next week, in our final preview, it will be time for our heroes\
  \ to travel to the depths of hell for their most fearsome challenge yet!</p> \n\
