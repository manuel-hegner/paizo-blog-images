  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Just read any messageboards or comment threads,\
  \ and you'll realize this truth about people: some of them love to throw bombs and\
  \ blow things up. It's a visceral thrill. Lobbing bombs is dramatic and fun, and\
  \ every so often all of us love to watch something burn. If you enjoy this activity\
  \ more than most, do we have a class for you!</p> \n     <p>So far we've previewed\
  \ the fighter and the rogue. You might have thought we'd showcase one of the original\
  \ spellcasting classes next, but that involves talking a bit more about spellcasting,\
  \ so instead, we decided to unleash the secrets of the alchemist in our newest preview\
  \ of the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i>.</p> \n     <p>In the early days of\
  \ Pathfinder First Edition, the alchemist saw release in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide</i>. Since then, the alchemist has proven to be very popular. Unsurprisingly,\
  \ when we surveyed the player base about what classes see the most play, the alchemist\
  \ rose right to the top (along with the oracle, but more on that in a later preview).\
  \ That alone would have promoted the class into the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i>,\
  \ but tackling the alchemist early on during the design process was beneficial for\
  \ another reason: it allowed us to take a hard look at alchemical item design with\
  \ the alchemist in mind rather than as a later add-on.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Alchemist\
  \ Features</h2> \n     <p>While anyone trained in Crafting can take the Alchemical\
  \ Crafter skill feat and craft their own alchemical items, the alchemist is much\
  \ better at this crafting discipline. At 1st level, he gains Alchemical Crafter\
  \ and a formula book for free, along with four bonus alchemical item formulas (for\
  \ a total of eight, including the four from Alchemical Crafter). Each time he levels\
  \ up, he gains two more formulas. This is on top of ones he either discovers or\
  \ invents. Not only does he gain more access to alchemical tricks, by way of advanced\
  \ alchemy and the quick alchemy action, but he can also spend resonance to create\
  \ alchemical objects on the fly, though such hasty concoctions are potent for only\
  \ a short period.</p> \n     <p>Crafting is all well and good, but what about bombing\
  \ potential? The alchemist's bombs are now the basic alchemical items you are familiar\
  \ with: things like alchemist fire, thunderstones, acid flasks and so on. He crafts\
  \ these items and lobs them. At 3rd level, he gains the empower bomb feature, which\
  \ allows him to multiply the damage of the bombs he creates. This multiplier increases\
  \ with level until it reaches six times the alchemical bomb's base damage at 19th\
  \ level.</p> \n     <p>But that's only the startâ€”at 5th level the alchemist learns\
  \ the secrets of mutagens, and as he progresses his ability to craft alchemical\
  \ items on the fly becomes both greater and faster.</p> \n     <h2>Alchemist Feats</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Tying these features together is the selection of alchemist class feats.\
  \ As with other class feats, they allow the alchemist to either focus or diversify\
  \ his features and talents. In the case of the alchemist, class feats come in a\
  \ few broad categories. If the alchemist wants to make the most of his crafting,\
  \ he might choose Efficient Alchemy or Enduring Alchemy at 4th level. The former\
  \ allows him to craft larger batches of alchemical items during downtime, while\
  \ the latter extends the amount of time he can use alchemical items that he creates\
  \ with the Quick Alchemy action. When he reaches 6th level, Powerful Alchemy allows\
  \ him to increase the DCs of his alchemical effects, while the 18th-level Improbable\
  \ Elixirs feat enables him to craft elixirs with the effects of magical potions.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Making stuff is great, but destruction is much more fun. Most alchemical\
  \ bombs are splash weapons, which means that when the alchemist hits an enemy, those\
  \ nearby take a bit of damage. At 4th level, an alchemist with the Calculated Splash\
  \ feat can deal splash damage equal to his Intelligence modifier instead of the\
  \ normal 1 splash damage. At 6th level, the alchemist can take the Precise Bomb\
  \ feat, allowing him to hit everyone but his allies with the splash damage. Taking\
  \ both feats increases the hurt he puts on enemies while saving his allies the pain.\
  \ Of course, there are also plenty of feats that affect the primary target of a\
  \ bomb. Debilitating Bomb at 6th level and its greater counterparts at 10th and\
  \ 14th levels allow the alchemist to apply different types of conditions to the\
  \ primary target of his bombs.</p> \n     <p>After an alchemist gains the mutagen\
  \ crafting feature, he can take feats that modify how those powerful elixirs interact\
  \ with his internal chemistry. For instance, the 8th-level Feral Mutagen feat boosts\
  \ the alchemist's Intimidate checks and morphs his teeth into frightful jaws and\
  \ his hands into rending claws. Other such modifications are subtler. The 10th-level\
  \ Stalker Mutagen feat grants the alchemist Stealth as a signature skill and allows\
  \ him to move up to his Speed when he sneaks. While all mutagens grant some bonuses\
  \ and drawbacks, the Perfect Mutagen feat at 18th level allows the alchemist to\
  \ ignore the drawbacks when under the effect of a mutagen he crafted.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>All of this is only a small sample of what the class has to offer. The alchemist\
  \ is also a master of poisons (which he can craft for free each day just like other\
  \ alchemical items), has easy access to a number of skills, and can act as the party's\
  \ trap disabler or healer if necessary. The diversity in the class allows you to\
  \ pick and choose exactly how you want to manifest your particular brand of alchemical\
  \ discoveries.</p> \n     <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br> <i>Senior Designer</i></p>\
