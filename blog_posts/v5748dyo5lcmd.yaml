  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, September 9, 2011</p> \n   <p>We're only a month\
  \ away from the release of our very first prepainted miniatures set, <a href=\"\
  /store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8l52\">Beginner\
  \ Box Heroes</a>! Production samples of the actual final miniatures arrived in our\
  \ offices last week, and everyone here was absolutely amazed by the quality WizKids\
  \ was able to put into the models. People are going to flip out when they see the\
  \ intricate patterns on the back of iconic cleric Kyra's cape or the fine details\
  \ of iconic thief Merisiel's armor. I know it's difficult to believe until you're\
  \ actually holding the minis in your hand, but a lot of folks here at Paizo—no strangers\
  \ to prepainted miniature collecting—have called these the best-looking prepainted\
  \ miniatures they have ever seen.</p> \n   <p>Very soon, we will be posting high-quality\
  \ photos of the production samples so you can see these beautiful miniatures yourselves.\
  \ Also very soon, we will be posting details of how you can subscribe to our ongoing\
  \ miniatures line, Pathfinder Battles, and how you can preorder or subscribe to\
  \ make sure you have a chance to get the exclusive limited-edition Huge Black Dragon\
  \ special miniature that crowns our first full set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures,\
  \ <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>.</p> \n   <p>Until then, I thought I'd tide you over\
  \ with a look at digital renders of two of the nastiest critters in the Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters set, the Lich and the Medusa! WizKids is presently working on making\
  \ these digital renders into molds from which the production minis will be cast.\
  \ The final colors on the models themselves will look a little more \"realistic\"\
  \ than the images you see here, but the outlines of the figures themselves and the\
  \ general color scheme are right on the money.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ updates and image reveals of the additional miniatures in the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> set, and order or subscribe by October 1st to make sure\
  \ you get a chance to purchase the Huge Black Dragon! </p> \n   <p>Until then, feast\
  \ your eyes on these treacherous bad guys, but do yourself a favor and don't stare\
  \ into the eyes of the Medusa!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n\
