  \ with the flipping of an electronic switch, voting is closed for Round 1 of RPG\
  \ Superstar 2014!</span></p> \n    <p>This year, over 2,100 voters cast a total\
  \ of more than 310,000 votes to sort hundreds of items into a manageable hierarchy.\
  \ Now it's time for our three judges—Paizo editor <b>Judy Bauer</b>, Paizo developer\
  \ <b>Patrick Renie</b>, and EN World's <b>Russ \"Morrus\" Morrissey</b>—to read\
  \ over the top items, critique them, and determine our Top 32. The Top 32 are revealed\
  \ Tuesday, January 21st, and their next challenge is to <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/round2Rules\"\
  >design a monster</a>.</p> \n    <p>As a former RPG Superstar judge, I'd like to\
  \ take a moment to again thank everyone who voted on the wondrous items in this\
  \ year's competition. Before Paizo added public voting for Round 1, the judges had\
  \ to spend many hours over the holidays evaluating wondrous item submissions. By\
  \ sharing this responsibility with the public voters, you've allowed the judges\
  \ to focus their efforts on the very best items.</p> \n    <p>In particular, a big\
  \ \"thank you\" to the 76 people who voted <b>over 1,000 times</b> this year, you've\
  \ definitely earned your custom Marathon Voter messageboard tag. And a super-big\
  \ \"thank you\" to <b>Azouth</b>, <b>Feros</b>, and <b>Thomas LeBlanc</b>, who each\
  \ voted <b>over 5,000 times</b>—congratulations on your 2014 Champion Voter messageboard\
  \ tag!</p> \n    <p>Congratulations to everyone who submitted a wondrous item to\
  \ RPG Superstar this year. Please refrain from discussing your wondrous items until\
  \ the Top 32 are revealed on January 21st—we don't want to bias the judges or break\
  \ anonymity for any items. Start working on your R2 monster, whether or not you\
  \ think you're in the Top 32: it's good practice, and by starting now (instead of\
  \ waiting until next Tuesday) you give yourself an extra week of design time. Monster\
  \ entries for the Top 32 are due Friday, January 24, 2014!</p> \n    <p>Sean K Reynolds<br>\
