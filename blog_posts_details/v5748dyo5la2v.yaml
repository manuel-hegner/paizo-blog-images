  artist: "upstart adventures. The Innocent: This cute, athletic halfling named Madge\
    \ Blossomheart was little more than a girl when the crimes were committed, and\
    \ she retains much of her youthful charm. This unfortunate maiden doesn't even\
    \ understand most of what is going on... or at least that's what she claims. But\
    \ what dark secrets could she possibly be concealing behind that glowing smile?\
