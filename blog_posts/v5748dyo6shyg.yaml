  description\">It’s that time of year again when the convention machine begins to\
  \ grind to life! We’re working hard on plans for PaizoCon and Gen Con, and hope\
  \ to have news to share with you very soon, stay tuned. We’re also seeing event\
  \ support requests start to roll in, which is always great! Lots of other things\
  \ to talk about this month, so let’s dive right in!</p> \n     <h2>Digital Adventure\
  \ Releases</h2> \n     <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available February\
  \ 23, 2022:</p> \n     <h3>Pathfinder</h3> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02apj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Delve-the-Pallid-Depths\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-10: Delve the Pallid Depths</em></a>*<br> <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-311-No-Time-for-Treason\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-11: No Time for Treason</em></a>*<br> <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02arg?Pathfinder-Bounty-18-From-Family-Lost\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Bounty #18: From Family Lost</em></a><br> <em>Pathfinder One-Shot #4: Mark of\
  \ the Mantis</em></p> \n     <h3>Starfinder</h3> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar1?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-414-Rasheens-Remembrance\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-14: Rasheen's Remembrance</em></a>*</p> \n \
  \    <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Pathfinder Society-Specific\
  \ Rule Updates</h2> \n     <p>This month, we published several rule clarifications\
  \ &amp; updates that apply specifically to the Pathfinder Society campaign. These\
  \ clarifications are always available on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay/faq\"\
  >Organized Play FAQ pages</a> or in the appropriate <a href=\"https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/Homepage\"\
  ><em>Guide to Organized Play</em></a>, but we wanted to make sure we highlighted\
  \ them here.</p> \n     <h3>Massive Damage</h3> \n     <p>When considering if a\
  \ character would be killed outright by Massive Damage, you should treat their maximum\
  \ Hit Points as 20 if they have fewer than 20 maximum Hit Points. This clarification\
  \ is to attempt to avoid killing first-level characters outright. If a new player\
  \ is about to do something reckless that will almost certainly result in their death\
  \ (such as their character leaping off a cliff), ensure that they understand the\
  \ potential consequences first.</p> \n     <h3>Similar Lore</h3> \n     <p>If a\
  \ scenario calls for a specific Lore and a player has an extremely similar Lore\
  \ (such as Pathfinder Lore in place of Pathfinder Society Lore), the GM should permit\
  \ the use of that Lore. If a Lore is adjacent (e.g. Academia Lore in place of Library\
  \ Lore), the GM can permit its use if they feel the two overlap enough. Ultimately,\
  \ the GM is empowered to use their best judgment in such situations. This guidance\
  \ has been floating around for a while, so we wanted to codify it in the FAQ page.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Additional Languages</h3> \n     <p>The Character Creation section\
  \ of the <em>Guide to Organized Play</em> has been updated to grant all Pathfinder\
  \ Society characters an additional regional language at character creation. It’\
  s important to us that the characters in the campaign represent the diversity of\
  \ the world of Golarion, and this small change ensures that characters from a region\
  \ outside the Inner Sea can more accurately represent their home and know their\
  \ home region’s language. Most characters will gain an additional language as a\
  \ result of this update.</p> \n     <h3>Bequeathal Boons</h3> \n     <p>The section\
  \ of the Bequeathal boons that required a character receiving access to wait until\
  \ their level matched the level of the originating chronicle sheet has been removed.\
  \ This created unintentional tangles with sanctioned material that could be applied\
  \ to a character of any level and was unnecessary with the way the game system gives\
  \ most options a level anyway. The boons have been updated in the Achievement Points\
  \ store; any previously-downloaded versions can be downloaded again to update the\
  \ language, but doing so is not required.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Starfinder\
  \ Errata</h2> \n     <p>Last week, the Starfinder team <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinder/faq\"\
  >released some errata</a>, including updates for the newly-released <em>Galactic\
  \ Magic</em>. In particular, this errata changed the text of the Genetics Field\
  \ of Study for biohackers.</p> \n     <p>Any character who finds that this change\
  \ materially affects their character is free to choose a different field of study\
  \ for their biohacker with no required time or credit investment. We are updating\
  \ the language around similar rules updates in the <em>Guide to Organized Play</em>\
  \ to ensure that future changes of the same type will be handled similarly.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n     <p>This month was a busy month\
  \ for sanctioning! We released sanctioning for <em>Starfinder Galactic Magic</em>\
  \ on release date, and then updated it a few hours later to allow another option\
  \ through (you’re welcome, vanguard fans)! We also updated the sanctioning for the\
  \ <em>Character Operations Manual</em> to finally permit Qi Adept through for soldiers.\
  \ For Pathfinder Society (First Edition), the Return of the Runelords Adventure\
  \ Path is sanctioned for play and available for reporting.</p> \n     <p>February\
  \ is a fairly quiet month on the product release front, so it’s possible that there\
  \ won’t be any new content next time I talk to you. I’m working with our art team\
  \ to get the final updates of the older sanctioned content completed so as to ensure\
  \ that all sanctioned material is consistent and awards the correct rewards. Generally\
  \ speaking, the next material to be newly sanctioned will be Book of the Dead and\
  \ the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path for Pathfinder Society (Second Edition);\
  \ the Horizons of the Vast Adventure Path for Starfinder Society; and the Tyrant’\
  s Grasp Adventure Path for Pathfinder Society (First Edition), which should close\
  \ the book on new material for that campaign.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program\
  \ involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must\
  \ run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent).\
  \ A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!\
  \ </p>\n     <p>This month, we completed a hat trick for the first time, with one\
  \ new 5-rank GM in each program!</p> \n     <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Wally Waltner<br>\
  \ <b>5th Nova (SFS)</b>: Landon Hatfield<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Jimmy Dick</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication!\
  \ If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email\
  \ us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> \n     <p>That’s quite enough from me, so I’\
  ll sign off now. Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And stay tuned for\
  \ news about SFS Year 5, coming soon!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
