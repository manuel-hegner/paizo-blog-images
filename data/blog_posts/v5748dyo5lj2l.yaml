  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 30, 2016</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last year, while planning the class deck schedule,\
  \ a most Gobtastic plan was concocted. In addition to supporting Organized Play\
  \ using <a href=\"/products/btpy96ie\">Ranzak</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9fpr\"\
  >Ekkie</a>, and our newest promo goblin <a href=\"/products/btpy9nbv\">Tup</a>,\
  \ we could create playable versions of all the main goblins from the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8j5w\"><em>We Be Goblins!</em></a> RPG modules. To celebrate, we could\
  \ also do a short <a href=\"/products/btpy9o0o\">Season of the Goblins</a> (then\
  \ called \"We Be Card Goblins!\") based on the first couple of adventures. Little\
  \ did we realize that two of our coolest fans, Tyler Beck (<a href=\"/people/cartmanbeck\"\
  >cartmanbeck</a> on the boards) and David Jacobson (aka <a href=\"/people/theryonstormrune\"\
  >Theryon Stormrune</a>), would beat us to it. When we at Lone Shark Games saw their\
  \ work, we knew there was absolutely no point to us redoing it for Season of the\
  \ Goblins. But let's hear it directly from them!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n    \
  \  <p><b>David</b>: Back before there was a <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">DriveThruCards custom Card Creator</a> and before there was\
  \ a <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</em></a>, I\
  \ had wanted to take the <a href=\"\"><em>We Be Goblins!</em></a> module and turn\
  \ it into a card game adventure. Unfortunately without the ability to create cards,\
  \ my vision was limited on how to proceed. My thoughts turned to proxying cards\
  \ but that wasn't practical on the required scale. Over a year passed and through\
  \ the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2sy8t\">HawkCon</a> meetings, I met Tyler Beck. Somehow\
  \ the subject came up and I found a kindred spirit. Now, Tyler is a creative fiend.\
  \ He loves to throw ideas onto \"paper.\" I soon discovered that he had a lot more\
  \ done with <em>We Be Goblins!</em> than I had. So I started working with him to\
  \ polish and fit the work into the current structure of the game. And around that\
  \ point, the Card Creator came online, allowing us to create some of the proxy cards\
  \ we needed to bring the adventure to life.</p> \n      <p><b>Tyler</b>: While David\
  \ was designing his version of <em>We Be Goblins!</em> for Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game, I unknowingly was working on a very similar idea. I had decided that\
  \ PACG is fun, and goblins are fun, and so PACG plus goblins would be even more\
  \ fun! By June 2015, I had started writing card text, and by the time July rolled\
  \ around, I was finished with my first draft of the scenarios, as well as five goblin\
  \ characters. I decided that I wanted to do something more with them than just play\
  \ with my friends: I would go to PaizoCon and run the game there! I emailed Tanis\
  \ and asked her if she'd be interested in writing up a special boon for those who\
  \ play in my special goblin-themed games at PaizoCon, and she was tentatively excited\
  \ about the idea. Once I ran into David at the HawkCon event, I knew I had the perfect\
  \ person to get my crazy ideas boiled down into really clean card text, and we started\
  \ working together on the cards. David's meticulous editing made a huge difference,\
  \ and we quickly had a great set of scenarios all printed up, and we went into playtesting\
  \ mode. We each ran the game for our friends, and everyone had a blast (especially\
  \ those who played Mogmurch)! Eventually Tanis acquiesced to my idea of making the\
  \ event a sanctioned game, and she ended up writing up an absolutely amazing special\
  \ boon for those who would play in our game at PaizoCon. Unfortunately, I found\
  \ that I would not be able to attend PaizoCon, and all would be lost... except that\
  \ I had an excellent proxy!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n       <br> <i>Wait, not those proxies.</i>\n      </div> \n      <p><b>David</b>:\
  \ A couple months before PaizoCon 2016, Tyler asked me if I would run the <em>We\
  \ Be Goblins!</em> event at PaizoCon. It was my first PaizoCon, but we had put in\
  \ a lot of time into our work and I wanted to make sure it was a success. So I agreed.\
  \ We'd have three sessions with two tables each session: one run by me, one by Tanis.\
  \ I kept reading about it in the blogs leading up to PaizoCon. It made me nervous\
  \ and excited. Tyler and I kept creating and refining our cards with the Card Creator,\
  \ and then had two finished sets made. Then I got to Seattle and it was a big success.\
  \ The players enjoyed the adventure and gave us great feedback. I changed a few\
  \ things between sessions based on what people thought and how it played. I think\
  \ that was one of the most important things about the journey of our work. So I\
  \ made notes and headed back home. We had planned on creating a second adventure\
  \ based on <a href=\"/products/btpy8xc3\"><em>We Be Goblins Too! </em></a></p> \n\
  \      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n       <img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160830-Photo1.jpg\"\
  > \n       <img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160830-Photo2.jpg\"\
  >\n       <br> <i>Even got Gaby \"goblified\"!</i>\n      </div> \n      <p>But\
  \ Paizo's Season of the Goblins had been announced, apparently making our work (and\
  \ future work on the second adventure) moot. So Tyler and I started working immediately\
  \ on our other ideas. Again, his creative madness had started and I was just trying\
  \ to keep pace with the new adventure.</p> \n      <p><b>Tyler</b>: Then we got\
  \ tapped on the shoulder as Lone Shark was planning on adapting the We Be Goblins!\
  \ module for the mini-season. They had seen our work and realized that it would\
  \ be a great starting point. So we were asked if we'd be willing to contribute to\
  \ the design of the Season of the Goblins! mini-season, and we were happy to take\
  \ on the challenge. One major question was how to make it work with Pathfinder Society\
  \ Adventure Card Guild play. We had designed these scenarios to be played with goblin\
  \ characters, but for organized play, any legal character would need to be allowed.\
  \ David came up with the idea that any non-goblin character may have been transformed\
  \ into a goblin by the work of the dark deity Lamashtu, and we were off! We had\
  \ designed these scenarios to be played with a mountain of custom cards, including\
  \ custom goblin characters and decks, boons like allies <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/166149/Bruthazmus--Custom-Card\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Bruthazmus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/180790/Goblin-Raider--Custom-Card\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Goblin Raider</a>, and banes like the monster <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/173000/Shopkeeps-Daughter--Custom-Card\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Shopkeep's Daughter</a> and henchman <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/173006/Ven-Vinder--Custom-Card\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Ven Vinder</a>. PFSACG play would be problematic if every table\
  \ needed so many custom cards, so we pared it down to only the most useful cards.\
  \ Then we sent it over to Keith Richmond to do his magic.</p> \n      <p><b>David</b>:\
  \ And then it was time to head to Indianapolis for Gen Con. Again, I wondered how\
  \ it was going to look and how it was going to play. Tyler and I hadn't seen a copy\
  \ of the adventure yet. I had signed up to play sessions of Season of the Goblins!\
  \ as well as volunteer in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game section of the Sagamore\
  \ ballroom. And just like at PaizoCon, it was a big hit. Paizo had wanted to limit\
  \ the tables to 4 players, but every session had 5 to 6 players per table with three\
  \ tables having been \"goblified\" as we called it. The changes that Keith had made\
  \ were a perfect match to the original material and the feedback was overwhelmingly\
  \ positive. People had fun. The new characters from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"\
  ><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9k5m\"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a>\
  \ decks played well alongside other class deck characters.</p> \n      <p>But at\
  \ least for me, nothing really matched the excitement of hearing that Mike Selinker\
  \ liked our original work, and seeing our names at the top of the credits page.\
  \ It makes all the work worth it: the hours reading and re-reading our adventure\
  \ and card text, getting cards printed and reprinted, playtesting and fixing this\
  \ card or that card.</p> \n      <p><b>Keith</b>: I want to thank Tyler and David\
  \ again for being great fans and playtesters, whose excitement and hard work led\
  \ to a fun event at PaizoCon and made this season a breeze to develop. I like to\
  \ think I've added a couple cool twists, like \"Goblifying\" the boxes by shuffling\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9k5m\"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> cards if you have them, and rewarding\
  \ access to the goblin promos, but the overwhelming bulk of the work is theirs.\
  \ The first adventure of Season of the Goblins, <a href=\"/products/btpy9o0o\"><em>We\
  \ Be Goblins!</em></a> is available now. We Be (Card) Goblins Too! will be available\
  \ sometime in the next month. Enjoy the Gobbling!</p> \n      <p>Tyler Beck, David\
