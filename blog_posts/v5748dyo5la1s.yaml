  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, February 28, 2008</p> \n    <p>The <i><a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy7zda\">Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer</a></i> is off to the printer,\
  \ so here is your first look at what you can expect this juicy 64-page book to contain.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p></p>\n     <h2>Osirion</h2> <b>LAND OF THE PHARAOHS</b>\n\
  \     <br> <b>Alignment: </b> LN\n     <br> <b>Capital: </b> Sothis (111,989) \n\
  \     <br> <b>Notable Settlements: </b> Ipeq (12,730), Totra (52,360), Shiman-Sekh\
  \ (6,680) \n     <br> <b>Ruler: </b> The Ruby Prince Khemet III\n     <br> <b>Government:\
  \ </b> Celestial Monarchy\n     <br> <b>Languages: </b> Osiriani\n     <br> <b>Religion:\
  \ </b> Nethys, Sarenrae, Pharasma, Lamashtu, Irori, Norgorber, Rovagug\n     <p></p>\
  \ \n     <p>For almost 2000 years after the Starstone fell from space to create\
  \ the Inner Sea, chaos and ruin defined Golarion. The old empires were cast in ruin,\
  \ strange creatures born of darkness and fear stalked the land. It was a time of\
  \ barbarism and terror, a slow decline into extinction for humankind. But humanity\
  \ rose again in the jungles and deserts of the south Inner Sea coast. Osirion, a\
  \ land of living god-kings and monolithic pyramids, rose as a beacon in a world\
  \ ruled by barbarism, the first of the great kingdoms of man's Age of Destiny. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>A prophet of Nethys known as Azghaad unified the warring tribes along\
  \ the River Sphinx, initiating Osirion's first pharaonic dynasty in the city of\
  \ Sothis, which still bears titanic statues carved in the image of Osirion's first\
  \ ruler. The Osiriani folk honored their pharaohs as gods in the flesh, acceding\
  \ to their every whim and marching upon their grand ambitions. Within 500 years\
  \ Osirion controlled vast territories in Thuvia and modern day Rahadoum and Katapesh,\
  \ as well as a lost colony that eventually became the kingdom of Geb. This First\
  \ Age of Osirion generated pyramid tombs and temples for scores of pharaohs and\
  \ their servants, many of which remain undiscovered (and well trapped) to this day.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>A succession of lesser pharaohs and temporary foreign conquerors\
  \ ruled Osirion in the middle centuries of the Age of Destiny, erecting cities and\
  \ temples of their own in an attempt to leave a permanent mark on history. Most\
  \ are forgotten today, and during this period Osirion waned in influence throughout\
  \ the Inner Sea, ceding its marginal colonial territories. </p> \n     <p>Four competing\
  \ warlords known as the Four Pharaohs of Ascension halted Osirion's decline about\
  \ two centuries before the foundation of Taldor, restoring the nation's influence\
  \ and holdings through using force and guile. The resulting prosperity fueled a\
  \ rebirth in the nation's spirit, marking the birth of Osirion's Second Age. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>In 1532 AR, foreign influence ended Osirion's pharaonic era when Qadiri\
  \ agents toppled the corrupt government of Pharaoh Menedes XXVI, establishing Osirion\
  \ as a satrapy of the Keleshite Empire of the East. Over the centuries migrants\
  \ from Kelesh changed the ethnic character of the nation, crashing many of the old\
  \ monuments and structures to the ground in an effort to chart a new destiny for\
  \ Osirion. </p> \n     <p>This destiny brought the sun-focused religion of Sarenrae\
  \ to Osirion, whose own religious traditions had always centered strongly upon the\
  \ movements of heavenly bodies. As the cult of the Dawnflower achieved greater popularity\
  \ among Keleshite and Garundi alike it became a threat to the satrap, who banished\
  \ the dervishes to the deserts of Thuvia. </p> \n     <p>Members of the Dawnflower\
  \ cult murdered the Satrap of Osirion in 2253, establishing the first in a long\
  \ series of independent Keleshite sultans who ruled from Sothis. The last of these\
  \ dictators fell to rebellion exactly 100 years ago, handing the nation to Khemet\
  \ I, a Garundi prince who traced his lineage back to the Azghaadi Dynasty of Osirion's\
  \ First Age. Thousands of years of oppression and decline made the people eager\
  \ for a savior, and Prince Khemet offered them hope. Today, Khemet's grandson rules\
  \ Osirion, calling himself the Ruby Prince. Some say that he might one day change\
  \ this title to pharaoh, but such a shift would seriously trouble the desert nation's\
  \ neighbors. </p> \n     <p>The youthful Prince Khemet III has opened the borders\
  \ of Osirion to treasure seekers from around the world, offering a high bounty to\
  \ those who uncover the hidden wonders of the past. As a result, Sothis is filled\
  \ with treasure hunters of all shades. While the guards are keen to watch for anyone\
  \ stealing the heritage of Osirion, there are plenty of ways to smuggle these ancient\
  \ artifacts out of the country, and Osiriani relics have become a valuable commodity\
  \ in markets across Avistan. </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p> Jason Bulmahn <br>\
