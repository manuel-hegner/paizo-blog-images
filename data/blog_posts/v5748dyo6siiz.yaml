  \   </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <h2>Massacre on the Hill — Severe 3</h2>\n\
  \      <p itemprop=\"description\">This encounter takes place in the small town\
  \ of Navendale at the base of the Aspodell Mountains in Andoran not far from the\
  \ Cheliax border. Your PCs could be passing through town or restocking and relaxing\
  \ between adventures. Navendale is small, but it gets a fair number of travelers.\
  \ One of the draws is the Red Rose Refuge, a popular lodge perched high on a rocky\
  \ peak overlooking the town. The Refuge, as the locals call it, is known for having\
  \ musicians play nearly every night, and tonight the famed Brastlewark Trio are\
  \ performing.</p>\n      <p>The PCs are in the town square below when a stableboy\
  \ comes running down the steep road to the Refuge shouting for any attention he\
  \ can gather. He heads straight for the PCs and says, “Hey! You! You gotta help!\
  \ It’s real bad up there!” If he’s calmed and asked what’s going on, he continues,\
  \ “I was working in the stables brushing the horses when all of a sudden they got\
  \ spooked, and then a real bad stink rose up. I nearly urped; smelled like when\
  \ you stumble across a dead goat out on the mountainside. Then I heard all the yelling\
  \ and screaming. A couple people stumbled out into the snow all bloody. You gotta\
  \ get up there and do something!”</p>\n      <p>The PCs can run up the steep road\
  \ and get to the Refuge in about two minutes. When the PCs arrive, the first thing\
  \ they encounter is a stench of death carried on the cold spring wind. The Refuge’\
  s door hangs open and the sounds of gruff voices, sobbing cries, and violence spill\
  \ from the doorway. Inside, tables sit askew, and chairs are sprawled out on the\
  \ floor amid broken pottery mugs and shattered glass. Over a dozen bodies lie slumped\
  \ and bloody on the floor.</p>\n      <p><strong>Map:</strong> This map showcases\
  \ a portion of the upcoming <em>Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Showtime Multi-Pack</em>, out\
  \ next month on Paizo.com or your local hobby store!</p>\n      <p><strong>Creatures:</strong>\
  \ Forced from their warrens, this group of ghouls has been wandering the countryside\
  \ to find a new home. They’ve also grown hungry, and instead of hunting in town,\
  \ they decided to target the remote Red Rose Refuge. They slinked out of the woods,\
  \ passing by the stables before entering the Refuge.</p>\n      <p>They immediately\
  \ attacked anyone they could reach, killing a dozen staff and patrons before cornering\
  \ the frightened gnome singers on the stage. Three of the ghouls have the performers\
  \ restrained while they whisper into their ears using Ghoul Whispers, while the\
  \ other three are feeding on their fresh kills so they can use Grave Knowledge to\
  \ help them find new warrens under an old boneyard. As the PCs enter the room, all\
  \ six turn their attention to the door and bare their teeth.</p>\n      <center>\n\

  \ creature was trained (if it’s unclear whether the creature was trained, the GM\
  \ decides). The ghoul is treated as trained and uses a +7 skill modifier. This takes\
  \ the same amount of actions or time as usual for the check.</p>\n      <p>The ghoul\
  \ can instead automatically learn something specific known by a creature it consumed\

  \ of its flesh the ghoul consumed.</p>\n      <p><strong>Swift</strong><strong>Leap</strong>\
