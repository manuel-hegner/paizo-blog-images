  \ 27, 2008</p> \n  <p>Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!</p> \n  <p>Yesterday Managing\
  \ Art Director James Davis received a very special package in the mail: a copy of\
  \ the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8255\"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i></a> \"\
  white sample.\" A white sample is a totally blank book with the correct weight,\
  \ paper stock, and cover stock of the final product. I asked Lead Designer Jason\
  \ Bulmahn to hold the very heavy book so I could take a picture of it and share\
  \ it with you. So here's your first look at the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i>\
  \ hardcoverâ€”as a blank sample anyway.</p> \n  <p>Enjoy!</p> \n  <p>Joshua J. Frost\
