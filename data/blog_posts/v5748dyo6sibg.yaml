  \   </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Your journey\
  \ to adventure with the Pathfinder Remaster starts with the <em>Player Core</em>,\
  \ a mighty tome containing all the rules you need as a player to create a character\
  \ and take them on epic quests! Just as before, making a character is as simple\
  \ as ABC: picking your Ancestry, Background, and Class!</p> \n      <p>This week,\
  \ we wanted to focus on ancestries a bit to give you a sense of what you can expect\
  \ from them in the Remaster. Little has changed in for basic ancestry features—\
  you still get starting Hit Points, note your size and Speed, record your attribute\
  \ boosts and flaws, list out your languages, and so on. The core identity of each\
  \ ancestry hasn’t changed with the Remaster, so a lot of the descriptive text remains\
  \ unaltered. But with alignment no longer a part of Pathfinder, we wanted to make\
  \ sure that you still had a sense of what the ancestry was all about. So, we’ve\
  \ created popular edicts and anathemas for each ancestry to give you a richer sense\
  \ of what matters to them, beyond simple good or evil. You can use these as a basis\
  \ for your character’s code and outlook, taking them as-is for a more traditional\
  \ approach or tweaking them to spark your own unique ideas for your character. Take\
  \ a look at the revised Beliefs section of the dwarf ancestry.</p> \n      <br>\

  \      <blockquote> \n       <h2>Beliefs</h2> \n       <p>Dwarves tend to value\
  \ honor and closely follow the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. They have\
  \ a strong sense of friendship and justice, though they are often very particular\
  \ about who they consider a friend. They work hard and play harder—especially when\
  \ strong ale is involved. Torag, god of dwarvenkind, is dwarves’ primary deity,\
  \ though worship of Torag’s family members is also common.</p> \n       <p><b>Popular\
  \ Edicts</b> create art with beauty and utility, hunt the enemies of your people,\
  \ keep your clan dagger close</p> \n       <p><b>Popular Anathema</b> leave an activity\
  \ or promise uncompleted, forsake your family</p> \n      </blockquote> \n     \
  \ <p>As you can see, this gives you a more well-rounded and diverse picture of what\
  \ members of the dwarven ancestry value as a people. We’re super excited about this\
  \ change and have already started incorporating this format in our upcoming releases,\
  \ such as the ardande and talos versatile heritages in <em>Rage of Elements</em>\
  \ coming out in just a few months!</p> \n      <p>In addition to this, we’ve taken\
  \ a hard look at the feats in each ancestry, making sure they’re living up to their\
  \ design potential. You can expect to see upgrades to several feats to ensure they\
  \ meet our current design philosophy (I'm looking at you, Stonecunning). Also, we’\
  ve added feats from the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em> to the entries in the Player\
  \ Core. For the dwarf alone, we’ve added Dwarven Doughtiness, Defy the Darkness,\
  \ and more. Of course, we took this opportunity to create some new feats as well.\
  \ Take a look at this all-new high-level dwarf feat!</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"\
  > \n      <h3>Stonewall [reaction] — Feat 17</h3> \n      <p><b>Dwarf, Earth, Polymorph</b><br>\
  \ <b>Frequency</b> once per day<br> <b>Trigger</b> An enemy or hazard’s effect hits\
  \ you or you fail a Fortitude save against one.</p> \n      <p>The strength of stone\
  \ overcomes you so strongly that it replaces your stout body. You become petrified\
  \ until the end of the current turn. You don’t take any damage from the triggering\
  \ effect or any other ill effects that couldn’t affect stone.</p> \n      <p>This\
  \ brings us to the end of our first round of previews, but you can expect to hear\
  \ a lot more about the Remaster books in the coming months. If you want to learn\
  \ more, don’t forget to watch our Pathfinder Remaster panel this weekend at PaizoCon\
  \ Online! We’ll be going live on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sian?PaizoCon-Online-2023-Twitch-Stream-Schedule\"\
  >Friday from noon to 2 pm PST</a>, right after the keynote address, over on the\
  \ Paizo Twitch. We hope to see you there!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
