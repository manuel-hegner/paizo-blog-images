  \ \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Hovels</h2> \n   <p>The Hovels lived up to their name.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The poorest and most wretched of Nisroch's people did not live in the\
  \ city. They huddled outside its walls, clustered in a miserable, mud-drenched shantytown\
  \ by the Leper's Gate. There was little stable ground to support them, so the denizens\
  \ of the Hovels built high and dense, creating a teetering warren of sticks that\
  \ seemed a sneeze away from collapse at any moment.</p> \n   <p>Swaths of sucking\
  \ mud surrounded the Hovels, filling the entire tangled labyrinth with the stench\
  \ of rotting fish and worse. Isiem saw paupers picking through the filth in search\
  \ of food or usable refuse. They wore stilts and masks of wadded rags in a futile\
  \ attempt to protect themselves from disease as they poked through the city's garbage.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Other paupers bore the sigil of the Morbidium—three links of heavy chain\
  \ run through by a scalpel—scarred or branded on their skin. The mark signified\
  \ that they had sold their bodies to the scholars of the Morbidium for experimentation.\
  \ It allowed them temporary safe passage through Nisroch's walls... until the scholars\
  \ were done with them.</p> \n   <p>For a handful of gold, they sold their flesh,\
  \ their bones, their sanity. Then, stripped of everything that interested the scholars,\
  \ they were discarded. They drifted to the Hovels and stayed there for whatever\
  \ days or weeks were left to them. The unlucky ones, Isiem had heard, could persist\
  \ for years.</p> \n   <p>\"Why would anyone choose to live here?\" Ascaros muttered\
  \ through the sleeve pressed over his face. He lagged behind as Voraic led them\
  \ through the Leper's Gate, eyeing the damaged souls who wandered the slums.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Because they want to live, and there is nowhere else for them to do\
  \ it,\" Voraic said. There was an odd note of sympathy in his voice. Behind his\
  \ back, Ascaros and Isiem exchanged a look. Proper Nidalese did not express pity\
  \ for their inferiors.</p> \n   <p>\"I'd sooner die than live like this,\" Isiem\
  \ said. He meant it. The Kuthite church taught that beggars and paupers were parasites\
  \ on society; the only reason they were not purged immediately was because their\
  \ sufferings pleased Zon-Kuthon. It was not a doctrine that lent itself to charity.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"The rest of them should too,\" Ascaros said. \"Have some shred of dignity.\
  \ There's none in living in the Hovels, and there's no way out.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  There is,\" Voraic said, pushing open the creaking gate. He stepped through the\
  \ gap in Nisroch's great black walls, passing from rainy gloom into midnight and\
  \ back into rain.</p> \n   <p>Again the shadowcallers exchanged a glance as they\
  \ followed him. Then Ascaros said, carefully neutral: \"You speak from experience?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I do.\"</p> \n   <p>For a time it seemed that he would not elaborate.\
  \ The gate closed behind them. Isiem watched a knot of small children, some thirty\
  \ feet away, fight one another for the corpse of a starved orange tomcat. Their\
  \ struggle was as grimly silent as it was vicious. Beggars' get they might be, but\
  \ these children were still Nidalese.</p> \n   <p>A scrawny boy, bleeding from the\
  \ temple, ran off with the dead cat. The others scattered from the shadowcallers'\
  \ approach. Clearly they had learned to be wary of visitors coming from the city.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"I was like him, once,\" Voraic said softly, lifting a sleeved hand toward\
  \ the boy with the cat. \"Desperate. Starving. Willing to fight—to kill—for a meal\
  \ like that. Most days, I didn't have the chance. I lived in the mud with my mother\
  \ and four siblings. By the time I was ten, two of those four were dead, and my\
  \ mother had had two more. I don't remember any of our fathers.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  A terribly sad story,\" Ascaros said aridly.</p> \n   <p>\"How did you get out?\"\
  \ Isiem asked.</p> \n   <p>\"Misanthe lifted me from the Hovels,\" Voraic said.\
  \ His robes quivered and he hunched a little further down, keeping his back toward\
  \ his companions. \"It was during one of the burnings. Ten... fifteen burnings ago.\
  \ I don't remember. They happen every year, twice a year sometimes. It's hard to\
  \ keep count. I was ten. It was summertime, and the smell was bad. The Over-Diocesan\
  \ sent her faithful to cleanse the Hovels. Their poisoned fires tore through the\
  \ buildings, and they marched through the streets, killing anyone who managed to\
  \ survive the smoke.</p> \n   <p>\"My mother pushed me through the flames toward\
  \ them. I knew what she was doing; she wasn't the only one to try it. Children who\
  \ are stoic enough—Nidalese enough—to endure extraordinary pain without crying sometimes\
  \ find acceptance among the ranks of the faithful. My siblings were too weak to\
  \ have a chance. But I endured the fire without flinching, and when I stumbled back\
  \ to my feet in front of the masters, I saw a glimmering of respect.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Misanthe stopped the others from killing me. She said I had promise. She tested\
  \ that promise before she took me, but I passed. And so I became her apprentice.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Tested it how?\" Isiem asked.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n\
  \    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ascaros.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ascaros_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \  <br> Ascaros would do well to guard his emotions.\n   </div> \n   <p>A small\
  \ shrug rippled Voraic's rain-soaked robes. His voice was steady but toneless. \"\
  She found my mother. She killed her. Then and there, in the smoke. There were screams\
  \ all around us from others burning in the Hovels. My friends, some of them. My\
  \ brothers and sisters. But Misanthe told me not to take my eyes off what she was\
  \ doing, no matter what went on around us. I obeyed. And I did not cry. At the end\
  \ of it, she said I had proven myself well enough to be worthy of magic... eventually.\
  \ She did not want a useless child. So I trained in Nisroch, first, and in time\
  \ she came back for me.\"</p> \n   <p>A path of broken planks sunk into the mud\
  \ served as stepping stones to the Hovels. Ascaros lifted the hem of his charcoal-gray\
  \ shadowcaller's robes away from the filth, grimacing as his boots squelched in\
  \ the sodden earth. Ramshackle buildings closed around them, funneling the rainwater\
  \ into tumbling rivers that slid from warped roof boards and splashed into the mud.\
  \ \"Were you with her in Westcrown?\"</p> \n   <p>Voraic shook his head. \"Only\
  \ in Nisroch. I did not have permission to enter Cheliax.\" He paused, pointing\
  \ to a crooked black spar that thrust up from the teetering buildings ahead. \"\
  That is where it happened. The burning always starts on the outer perimeter and\
  \ pushes in toward the city, so that those fleeing the flames run into the archers\
  \ on the walls.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Wait here,\" Ascaros said. \"See that we are not\
  \ disturbed.\"</p> \n   <p>\"'See that we are not disturbed'?\" Isiem echoed as\
  \ they strode deeper into the Hovels. Fearful eyes peered at them from the darkness\
  \ within the shacks, but neither of the shadowcallers paid them any mind. Most of\
  \ the Hovels' denizens fled or hid from their approach. A few were too damaged to\
  \ do either, but even those would never dare confront them. Voraic was right: these\
  \ people wanted to live. And confronting shadowcallers was no way to do that.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ascaros shrugged. \"Let him see the excuse for what it is. What difference\
  \ does it make?\"</p> \n   <p>\"None, I suppose.\" Isiem watched a muttering idiot\
  \ go by. The sigil of the Morbidium was branded on his brow, although it had been\
  \ partly cut away. A row of large, careless stitches ran up the side of the man's\
  \ neck and across his stubbly head. The wound they'd once closed had healed long\
  \ ago, but the stitches remained, red and inflamed with infection. The man stumbled\
  \ into a doorless shack and vanished from view, although Isiem could still hear\
  \ him mumbling deliriously to his invisible friends or foes. \"Does his tale ring\
  \ true?\"</p> \n   <p>\"That he was plucked from the Hovels by my aunt? Perhaps.\
  \ It isn't a story I'd brag about, but perhaps he wanted to deflect our suspicions.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Do you suspect him?\" Isiem asked.</p> \n   <p>\"Maybe.\" Scowling,\
  \ Ascaros stepped over an insensible woman lying sprawled across the alley. A cracked\
  \ board served as her bed, or bier—Isiem wasn't sure which. She had no legs. The\
  \ empty cloth of her skirts had been trampled into the mud so deeply that the garments\
  \ were barely more than ripples in the puddled filth. The stench of wine-sweat fogged\
  \ the air around her.</p> \n   <p>Forty yards past the legless woman, the Hovels\
  \ opened to the sky. Spell-driven firestorms had blasted away the buildings. The\
  \ mud around them was black and gritty with the coarser leavings of the flames:\
  \ chunks of charred wood, a knot of melted pins embedded in a clump of burned hair,\
  \ a few fragments of scorched bone. Nothing larger survived.</p> \n   <p>At the\
  \ edges of the ruins, the Hovels were beginning to creep back, like vines stretching\
  \ out after a forest fire. A mound of garbage here, a tangle of laundry lines there.\
  \ Some of the rooms that had been cracked in half like gourds were patched up again.\
  \ But no people.</p> \n   <p>\"So this is where my aunt died,\" Ascaros said, surveying\
  \ the desolation. \"Useless. There's nothing here to examine.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Witnesses\
  \ don't seem likely either,\" Isiem said, \"although I suppose we could knock on\
  \ doors and see who answers. If they answer.\"</p> \n   <p>\"They'll answer,\" Ascaros\
  \ said grimly. Raising his silver-capped staff, he started for the nearest shack.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The fourth door they tried yielded a person with functional eyes and a\
  \ mouth. He was another of the Morbidium's cast-offs; his fingers were reduced to\
  \ three on each hand, and those three were unnaturally extended with stitched-in\
  \ joints from the missing digits. Craters the size of cherries pocked his skull,\
  \ collecting rain in little pools.</p> \n   <p>But he could see, and he could talk\
  \ to them, and that made him better than the other creatures they'd found.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"What did you see when the fires came?\" Ascaros demanded.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ wretch blinked at them from his doorway. Rain trickled down his dented scalp and\
  \ ran down the sides of his nose, dripping into his slack toothless mouth. Behind\
  \ him, a handful of children huddled in the dark. Isiem wondered if it was for their\
  \ sake that this man had sold himself to the Morbidium—and what they must think\
  \ if he had. What was a father like this worth?</p> \n   <p>\"Fires,\" he managed\
  \ at last.</p> \n   <p>\"Yes,\" Ascaros said impatiently. \"Fires. What happened?\
  \ Who was here?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Many. Many in robes. With the fires.\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"Was there a woman? One who looked like me?\" Ascaros lifted his bad arm in\
  \ its sling. \"With an arm like this?\"</p> \n   <p>The broken man nodded slowly.\
  \ His fingers twitched strangely, as if the movement originated somehow in the sewn-on\
  \ middle joints. \"She was here.\"</p> \n   <p>\"What happened to her?\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"The fires came down, and she walked into a house. Struggling. The fires\
  \ ate her.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Struggling?\" Isiem repeated. He wondered if the man\
  \ was confused. Those dents in his skull were very deep. \"Against what?\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Death.\" The broken man nodded emphatically. He drew his fingers across\
  \ his throat. They wriggled spastically, like the convulsing legs of a crushed ant.\
  \ \"Fighting against death. She walked into the fires and they ate her.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Thank you,\" Isiem said. He took Ascaros's sleeve gently and pulled his\
  \ friend away from the door. The other shadowcaller's face had twisted into a scowl\
  \ that suggested he was about to explode with rage, and Isiem didn’t think that\
  \ would help them here.</p> \n   <p>\"Worthless,\" Ascaros fumed, stabbing his staff\
  \ into the stinking ground. He seemed angrier—and more afraid, Isiem thought—than\
  \ the broken man's story warranted. \"That idiot was worthless.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Of course he was,\" Isiem said. \"The Morbidium took everything of worth in him.\"\
  \ He sighed, casting a glance up at the dull gray sky. The storm showed no signs\
  \ of dissipating. \"Do you want to try the other doors, or shall we pursue another\
  \ lead?\"</p> \n   <p>\"There's no use talking to any of these lackwits. The ones\
  \ that have tongues don't have eyes, and the ones that have eyes don't have brains.\"\
  \ With one last snarl at the patched-up dwellings around the burned site, Ascaros\
  \ turned back the way they'd come. This time he did not step over the legless woman\
  \ in the mud; he jabbed his staff into her empty skirts and kicked her savagely\
  \ in the side. The woman spluttered in the filth, struggling feebly.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Control yourself,\" Isiem cautioned him quietly. \"Voraic may see. Or some other\
  \ Nisrochi. It would not do to damage our dignity.\"</p> \n   <p>Ascaros stiffened,\
  \ breathing heavily, but after a moment he nodded and stepped over the sobbing,\
  \ still-drunk cripple. He brushed a fleck of mud from his robes. \"Yes.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Do we have another lead?\"</p> \n   <p>\"The apprentice. He might owe her\
  \ everything, but when has that stopped treachery? And my aunt's remains. They are\
  \ being kept at the cathedral.\"</p> \n   <p>\"We have to collect them anyway,\"\
  \ Isiem said. \"Let's begin there. No need to let Voraic know we suspect him until\
  \ we must—and if we glean anything from Misanthe's remains, it will let us question\
  \ him more carefully.\"</p> \n   <p>\"To the cathedral, then,\" Ascaros said.</p>\
  \ \n   <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n   <p>Misanthe's corpse was laid on a table\
  \ alongside several others in a small room under the Cathedral of Bones. Isiem had\
  \ seen similar rooms, and similar tables, beneath the Dusk Hall. They served alternately\
  \ as torture beds, dissection tables, and biers—sometimes all three in quick succession.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Copper pieces rested atop each of Misanthe's eyes, signifying that a spell\
  \ had been used to delay the decomposition of her body. Not that there was much\
  \ to preserve. The flames had not been gentle; Ascaros's aunt was barely recognizable\
  \ as human. She had suffered from the same family curse as her nephew, and the peculiar\
  \ decay it inflicted left her corpse even harder to study. Much of her body had\
  \ been dead and withered even while she was living, and the curse-desiccated flesh\
  \ had burned like kindling in the fire.</p> \n   <p>But there was enough left to\
  \ look at. Isiem pushed up his sleeves and began his examination. Ascaros hovered\
  \ by his shoulder, following his work.</p> \n   <p>Most of the injuries were straightforward,\
  \ but one...</p> \n   <p>\"Do you see this?\" Isiem asked, pointing to a dark ring\
  \ that encircled Misanthe's throat. Burns obscured some of it, but nevertheless\
  \ it was clear that the mark made a perfect circle around her neck. It looked like\
  \ a bruise, almost, but the evenness of the color and its peculiar grayish hue spoke\
  \ to an unnatural origin. No human hand could produce such perfect uniformity.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Yes.\" Ascaros looked paler than usual. The tension that had been in\
  \ him since their conversation with the dented man in the Hovels seemed to have\
  \ snapped, as if the sight of the corpse confirmed some suspicion he'd been nursing\
  \ since then.</p> \n   <p>\"What is it?\"</p> \n   <p>\"The mark of a spell. She\
  \ called it the shadow garrote.\" Ascaros paused, fiddling with the wrappings on\
  \ his bad arm. His mouth twisted slightly. \"That was one of her most powerful spells,\
  \ and the most secret. She wouldn't have taught it to anyone. She refused to teach\
  \ it to me—and I wouldn't have had the strength to cast it if she had. Not many\
  \ people even know it exists.\"</p> \n   <p>\"What are you saying?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  That Misanthe was the only one in the world who had that spell. Unless she used\
  \ it for a suicide, that means someone else reflected her own magic against her.\
  \ And that means...\"</p> \n   <p>\"...that she wasn't killed by an apprentice,\"\
  \ Isiem finished for him. Turning a spell against its creator was a feat of extraordinary\
  \ magic. It was far beyond either of them; it was likely beyond their masters at\
  \ the Dusk Hall. \"That's an archmage.\"</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Deepening\
