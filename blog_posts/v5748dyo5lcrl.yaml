  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>The Box</h1> \n   <p>by Bill Ward</p> \n\
  \   <h2>Chapter Four: Nothing Gained</h2> \n   <p>\"Move back!\" Kostin shouted,\
  \ barely parrying a spear thrust to the gut. There were more than a score of the\
  \ things, each scarcely taller than Shess but like no humanoid Kostin had ever seen.\
  \ Green-skinned, bedecked with shaggy ropes of dark moss, and armed with crude spears\
  \ and clubs of human bone, the naked savages fought silently, almost impassively.\
  \ The sheer weight and surprise of them had pushed Kostin back until he collided\
  \ with Aeventius.</p> \n   <p>\"Go forward!\" Aeventius snarled. A flash of light\
  \ behind him attracted Kostin's attention, and he spared a quick look. Shoanti,\
  \ howling for blood, were blocking the hallway that was their only exit. In the\
  \ instant that Kostin turned he saw white darts of energy burst from Aeventius's\
  \ wand to sear down the corridor and drop the lead thug dead, leaving black burn\
  \ holes smoking in the man's chest.</p> \n   <p>Beside Kostin, Gyrd sung a low,\
  \ rumbling war-ballad in the skaldic language of his people. His thick Ulfen blade\
  \ rose and fell grimly, black-green liquid clinging to the steel. He dropped his\
  \ shield hard down upon the skull of one of the monsters with a sickening crunch,\
  \ and bulled forward with a roar, scattering the creatures with his charge and clearing\
  \ a path into the shaman's sanctum.</p> \n   <p>Kostin parried another wicked jab\
  \ from his opponent, and sliced his blade down along the spear shaft, lopping the\
  \ creature's hands off with a snick. The thing made no sound, nor did its expression\
  \ change as he pushed past it.</p> \n   <p>\"They’re fungus!\" Taldara shouted behind\
  \ him, the twang of her crossbow punctuating her statement. \"Cover your nose and\
  \ mouth!\"</p> \n   <p>But Kostin now had his dagger in his other hand, and was\
  \ fighting in the style of the Sczarni street duelists he had so loved to emulate\
  \ as a kid. His blades whistled in a tight arc around him, alternately parrying\
  \ and striking, the difficulty of landing mortal blows on such diminutive opponents\
  \ compensated for by their lesser reach. With a wild howl he leaped and spun among\
  \ them, all fear forgotten now, or else subsumed in his desire to strike.</p> \n\
  \   <p>To his right, Gyrd fought like a juggernaut, hacking fungus-men down and\
  \ ignoring any blows that landed upon his armored form. Kostin took note of their\
  \ surroundings for the first time, the floor strewn with carpets and hides in a\
  \ score of styles and colors, the walls bedecked with a strange intaglio of scrawled\
  \ symbols, the black altar in one corner of the room shedding a weak radiance from\
  \ guttering candle-stubs.</p> \n   <p>It was only then that he noticed the bodies.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>They were Shoanti, clearly, or what was left of Shoanti. Each body was\
  \ sticky with a mass of glistening mold, and each horribly ruptured as if it had\
  \ burst from the inside. Suddenly Taldara's warning to cover their faces made sense,\
  \ and Kostin dropped his dagger and riffled one-handed through his pouch for some\
  \ kind of cloth. Smashing aside an attack from one of the creatures, he turned to\
  \ shout a warning at Gyrd—and was just in time to see the big man disappear behind\
  \ a wall of darkness in the room's far corner.</p> \n   <p>\"Light!\" Kostin shouted,\
  \ running toward the place where he had last seen the Ulfen. A lance of pain sent\
  \ him crashing to the floor, a bone-tipped spear lodged in his thigh. His sword\
  \ spilled from his hand, landing with a thump on the carpet, just out of reach.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He rolled, hands held up to ward off the blow of a femur club. He could\
  \ see everything in excruciating detail; the bone club brown with dried blood, poised\
  \ to strike; the horrible, vacant face of the monster, a thing more plant than animal;\
  \ and his own hands, held up uselessly, themselves green with the blood of these\
  \ creatures.</p> \n   <p>Kostin saw too the silver blade emerge from the thing’\
  s chest just as it was about to strike, and the unholy light go out of its eyes\
  \ as Shess appeared behind it, her invisibility spell nullified by her attack.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Stop sitting around, boss!\" She tipped him a wink as the monster dropped\
  \ dead at her feet. He had seen the same little girl enthusiasm in her once before,\
  \ when picking flowers in a cemetery. She whirled away, blade flashing through the\
  \ pack of monsters, babbling a cheerful sing-song in the strange language of gnomes.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>As Kostin regained his feet and removed the miniature spear—the wound\
  \ was not deep, but it bled profusely—Aeventius and Taldara were there beside him,\
  \ fending off the encroaching creatures. There were around a dozen of the things\
  \ left, surrounding them in a deadly noose.</p> \n   <p>\"I have held the door,\"\
  \ Aeventius said, \"but it will not last forever. I think we may have a larger problem,\
  \ however.\" The wizard gestured to the corner where Gyrd had disappeared. The unnatural\
  \ darkness emanating from it had rolled back, and the object of Kostin's quest was\
  \ revealed.</p> \n   <p>The box.</p> \n   <p>It stood open atop a seaman's chest,\
  \ seemingly innocuous, but a dissipating cloud of particles surrounded it in a halo\
  \ of death. Gyrd lay unconscious at its base among a group of ruined corpses.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Spores,\" Taldara said. She had discarded her crossbow in favor of a\
  \ fighting hatchet, and was laying into a pair of creatures to Kostin’s left. \"\
  We have to get to him soon!\"</p> \n   <p>Suddenly it all clicked into place for\
  \ Kostin. The box—not just bait for a thief, but a trap for a shaman. The Scales\
  \ had set it up. Dangling a treat the Azahg could not resist, and filling it with\
  \ a trap he would never be able to counter. Dispel the locks and you still had the\
  \ darkness spell—and the lethal spores within. Simple; diabolical; and if it weren’\
  t for the stupid greed of Donal Carent feeding Kostin information about such a tempting\
  \ prize, he would have never been involved in this business.</p> \n   <p>\"We need\
  \ acid!\" Aeventius was shouting at Taldara as Kostin regained focus. A creature\
  \ leaped over the back of its fellows, spear leveled at the wizard's heart. Aeventius\
  \ flicked a finger at it in midair, and a force equal to one of Gyrd's hammer fists\
  \ smashed it in the chest and flung it back the way it had come. \"Ask the imp!\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Shess was at his side, slashing with enthusiastic abandon. \"Aevy!”\
  \ she admonished, sounding wounded. “After all we've been through!\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Acid?\" Kostin asked Taldara, as they both danced out of the way of a flailing creature.\
  \ \"To kill the mold?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Well I don't know any acid spells either,\"\
  \ Shess piped above the din. \"I don't like that sort of thing!\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Tal—what else do you know? How do we kill it?\" Kostin was acutely aware that Aeventius's\
  \ holding spell on the door wasn’t going to last much longer, and they would soon\
  \ be trading one set of enemies for another.</p> \n   <p>Taldara caught the spear\
  \ of a charging creature in the crook of her axe blade and pried the weapon from\
  \ its hand before driving her fist into the creature's face. Mordimor leaped and\
  \ slashed around her feet, his oversized claws ripping through fibrous flesh with\
  \ ease. \"Acid and daylight are the best ways—real light, not Aeventius’s ring.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Not fire?\" Kostin asked, driving the point of his sword through\
  \ the midsection of one of the monsters.</p> \n   <p>\"No,\" Taldara answered. \"\
  Daylight. Acid. And... alcohol. But something hard, high proof stuff.\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>With a barking laugh, Kostin remembered the leather skin he had confiscated\
  \ from Gyrd. Judging from the smell of it, it was strong enough to strip paint.\
  \ Without hesitation he sheathed his weapon and sprang for the box in the corner,\
  \ wineskin in one hand, the other holding a cloth over his nose and mouth.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Don't get close!\" Taldara shouted behind him, but Kostin saw no other\
  \ choice. Muttering a prayer to Cayden Cailean, the god of drunks and heroes, he\
  \ moved in, skin held out at arm's length, the black box that had been the cause\
  \ of all his problems fixed in his sight.</p> \n   <p>When he was close enough to\
  \ see the reddish stuff—clinging to what looked like a clay shingle sitting serenely\
  \ in the otherwise empty interior of the box—the world suddenly exploded in a cloud\
  \ of dust.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_fungusmonster.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_fungusmonster_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    <br> \"The only thing worse than fighting one of these things is becoming\
  \ one.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>Spores. Kostin screwed his eyes tight against them and\
  \ held his breath beneath the cloth. It suddenly, stupidly occurred to him that\
  \ this just might be the last thing he ever did.</p> \n   <p>Not only that, but\
  \ he might just get everyone else killed in the process. Everyone that was here\
  \ because of him.</p> \n   <p>Moving by memory, he lunged forward on his wounded\
  \ leg, ignoring the bolt of pain that shot up his thigh and the blood squelching\
  \ in his boot. Reaching what he hoped was the right spot, he upended the strong\
  \ spirits into the box. For what seemed an eternity he squeezed the skin, lungs\
  \ hot as forge coals bursting in his chest. The skin of his face and hands tingled\
  \ unnaturally.</p> \n   <p>The jack was empty and Kostin dropped it, staggering\
  \ away while waving his arms and slapping his face and clothing to rid himself of\
  \ any spores that might have clung to him.</p> \n   <p>He opened his eyes. The dead\
  \ creatures all lay heaped in still mounds around his exhausted friends. Kostin\
  \ smiled, a ready quip on the tip of his tongue, just as the door banged open at\
  \ the other end of the room.</p> \n   <p>His smile evaporated as the vanguard of\
  \ the Shoanti mob poured into the sanctum. But a crazy notion seized him in the\
  \ same moment, and he rushed to meet the gang, arms spread wide and teeth bared.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Behold the vengeance of the Night Scales!\" Kostin bellowed in a voice\
  \ that sounded like the arrival of a god.</p> \n   <p>The Shoanti froze.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Kostin grinned his most intimidating of grins, conscious of the fact that\
  \ he was covered in green ichor and spore dust. He pointed at the bodies that littered\
  \ the rooms, both the horribly mutilated corpses of the Shoanti shaman and his women,\
  \ and those of the strange fungus people.</p> \n   <p>\"Thus do those who cross\
  \ us die: souless and damned for all time. Come to me and join your master in Urgathoa's\
  \ belly—or flee the city tonight!\" Kostin roared, ranting like a stage villain.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Behind him Shess murmured, and a ghostly image appeared between Kostin\
  \ and the Shoanti. It was vaguely man-shaped and glowed with its own inner light.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Witness his agonies as I wrack his soul!\" Kostin howled, throwing both\
  \ hands into the air. Before him the image writhed and flickered like a storm-blown\
  \ candle flame.</p> \n   <p>It was a stampede. The Shoanti, all will to fight broken,\
  \ scrambled for the door. Their howls had turned into those of whipped dogs, and\
  \ reverberated down the hallway until they were well out of sight.</p> \n   <p>Shess\
  \ giggled, her illusion winking out of existence.</p> \n   <p>Taldara moved instantly\
  \ to Gyrd's side, the threat from the spores extinguished by the Ulfen’s own potent\
  \ draught. She searched frantically through her small pack, discarding a slew of\
  \ items strange and sundry, before snatching up what she had sought. She brought\
  \ the small phial to the Ulfen's bearded lips, and tilted it down.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  That should kill the spores, but he’s still going to hurt like hell. Maybe if we\
  \ get this mail off, two of us will be able to manage him.\" She wiped sweat from\
  \ her forehead.</p> \n   <p>\"Let us be away from here first,\" Aeventius said.\
  \ Producing a pinch of coarse, brown hair from his pouch, he intoned the words of\
  \ a spell. His ring flashed.</p> \n   <p>Walking over to the massive warrior, Aeventius\
  \ bent down and hoisted him onto his shoulder with barely a grunt. \"Although,\"\
  \ he said casually, chainmailed form balanced on his shoulder as easily as if it\
  \ had been a child, \"if we run into anything more dangerous than another locked\
  \ door this evening, I am of no more use.\"</p> \n   <p>They moved quickly back\
  \ the way they had come, not daring to explore the complex any further in case some\
  \ of the Shoanti returned, and everyone aware that Aeventius's unnatural strength\
  \ could only last for a few minutes.</p> \n   <p>They encountered no one. Retracing\
  \ their steps to the same alleyway where they had ambushed the first pair of guards,\
  \ Aeventius set his burden down unceremoniously. Taldara dashed away, intent on\
  \ hiring a horse or mule from the livery yard on Kindrucker Street. Kostin moved\
  \ to accompany her, but Aeventius pushed past him with alarming intensity, saying\
  \ something about not being left behind with “the imp.”</p> \n   <p>Kostin sighed\
  \ and slipped down next to Gyrd’s sleeping form. He straightened his wounded leg,\
  \ tightening the hasty bandage that was half-soaked through with blood. \"Looks\
  \ like this was a wash. Lucky you got paid up front in Sczarni silver, right little\
  \ one?\"</p> \n   <p>Shess shrugged, trying to adjust her overlarge spectacles,\
  \ which had been bent in the fight. With a pout she plucked them from her button\
  \ nose and pitched them into the dark.</p> \n   <p>\"Oh, I don't know,” she said,\
  \ a grin sneaking over her face. \"It was interesting. Plus we get equal shares\
  \ of this thing I grabbed off the altar.\" From her pouch, Shess produced a sun-bleached\
  \ goat's skull. It would have been hideous if it were not for the dozens of fine-cut\
  \ gemstones clustered around its golden eye sockets.</p> \n   <p>Kostin threw his\
  \ head back and laughed. For the first time in seemingly forever, he really meant\
  \ it. </p>\n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Assassination in the markets of Katapesh\
