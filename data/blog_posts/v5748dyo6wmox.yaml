  \ we released the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq03w9z\"><em>Lost Omens:\
  \ Tian Xia Character Guide</em></a>! This is an incredible book, packed to the brim\
  \ with exciting new character options. It’s also <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >sanctioned for Pathfinder Society play</a>! You can find boons for the uncommon\
  \ and rare ancestries in the Boon Store, as well as some other uncommon or rare\
  \ archetypes. Note that a lot of the uncommon content in this book is accessed simply\
  \ by creating a character from Tian Xia; you won’t find boons for these options,\
  \ as you have other ways to access it!</p>\n      <p>Speaking of which, when we\
  \ were working on the two Tian Xia books, we noticed an issue with the World Traveler\
  \ boon. This boon allows you to select a second region to treat as a home region\
  \ for character options…but it didn’t actually include Tian Xia. Whoops! We’ve updated\
  \ this boon as a result to future-proof it. The new text is below, and it remains\
  \ available in the Boon Store for just 20 Achievement Points.</p>\n      <blockquote>\n\
  \       <p>&gt; <strong>World Traveler</strong> (Slotless): You have traveled widely,\
  \ spending a considerable amount of time in a distant region and absorbing the local\
  \ customs. When you assign this boon to a character, select a country or city on\
  \ Golarion. You qualify as being from that city or country, as well as any regions\
  \ which contain it, for the purpose of fulfilling the Access prerequisite of uncommon\
  \ character options, in addition to any other access benefits you have from other\
  \ sources. For example, a character who selected Alkenstar fulfills access requirements\
  \ for Alkenstar as well as the Mana Wastes and the Impossible Lands, and a character\
  \ who selects Hwanggot fulfills requirements for Hwanggot and Tian Xia.</p>\n  \
  \    </blockquote>\n      <p>We’re a little behind on adventure sanctioning right\
  \ now, but we’re working hard on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq03w9w?Pathfinder-Adventure-Prey-for-Death\"\
  ><em>Prey for Death</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/curtaincall\"\
  >Curtain Call </a><a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/curtaincall\"\
  >Adventure Path</a>. In just a few short weeks, at the end of October, we’ll see\
  \ our next major rulebook release in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02oar\"\
  ><em>War of Immortals</em></a>, and we hope you’re all excited!</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h2>New Pathfinder Society Year</h2>\n      <p>The Year of Immortal Influence\
  \ is officially upon us, and with it comes some new updates! First of all, the <a\
  \ href=\"https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=pfs2guide._.Introduction\"\
  >Guide to Organized Play</a> has been officially updated to version 6.00. This version\
  \ of the guide does not contain major rules changes, but there has been a major\
  \ reorganization to make it more usable and bring it in line with the Guide for\
  \ Starfinder Society. If you wish to leave feedback, you can do so in <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/threads/rzs4voaf?Official-PFS2-Guide-to-Organized-Play\">this\
  \ forum thread</a>, which also has a summary of the changes.</p>\n      <p>Additionally,\
  \ we have released <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02evu\">new pregenerated\
  \ characters</a>! This update adds pregens for the eight Player Core 2 classes (alchemist,\
  \ barbarian, champion, investigator, monk, oracle, sorcerer and swashbuckler), as\
  \ well as the kineticist from Rage of Elements. The previous pregens have not been\
  \ updated or altered as part of this update.</p>\n      <p>As all legacy pregenerated\
  \ characters have been updated, Pathfinder Society players must use the Remastered\
  \ versions going forward. Please leave any errors or comments on the product page!</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2>\n      <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>\n\
  \      <p>While attending PaizoCon Europe last month, I awarded three Campaign Coins\
  \ to outstanding volunteers! We award these coins to members of the community who\
  \ have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community\
  \ at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; so if you believe someone\
  \ in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture\
  \ Officer), send an email to organizedplay@paizo.com with their name and reasons.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Congratulations to:</p>\n      <p><strong>Frank Richard</strong>, who\
  \ now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #916</p>\n      <p><strong>Damien Monnier</strong>,\
  \ who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #917</p>\n      <p><strong>\"Mr. Fred\"\
  \ Frederic Meulenijzer</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #918</p>\n\
  \      <p>Unfortunately, due to my busy travel schedule, I did not have time this\
  \ month to catch up on GMs who have earned their 5th rank. My sincerest apologies\
  \ to those GMs who are waiting patiently; I promise you will all be celebrated in\
  \ next month’s blog.</p>\n      <h2>Conventions</h2>\n      <p>Convention season\
  \ may be on the tail end, but we’ve still got some fantastic events coming up in\
  \ September and October! You can (and should!) check out our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\"\
  >conventions calendar</a> to see events with a Paizo Organized Play presence near\
  \ you.</p>\n      <p>Earlier today, we began soliciting volunteers for PAX Unplugged!\
  \ Last year’s show was an incredible success and we’re looking to make the show\
  \ bigger and better this year. We’re looking for talented GMs to run Pathfinder\
  \ Society quests and scenarios, as well as Starfinder Playtest scenarios. If you’\
  d like to join us this December in Philadelphia, you can find all the information\
  \ in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6wi29?Call-to-Volunteer-PAX-Unplugged-2024\"\
  ><b>yesterday's blog</b></a>!</p>\n      <p>Alright, that’s enough from me. Until\
  \ next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy some chocolate. You deserve\
  \ it.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;\"\
