  \ would require someone with far more expertise to confirm this absolutely, I am\
  \ now convinced that this set of so-called prophecies are all authored by the same\
  \ hand. Some of this is due to the handwriting on the documents that have been found\
  \ in more pristine condition (it is perhaps fitting that a prophecy dedicated to\
  \ the death of the Lucky Drunk was found on a scrap of parchment that looked like\
  \ it had been dragged through the floor of more than one tavern), but the rest I\
  \ attribute both to the places in which they were discovered and, I believe, the\
  \ rhythm of the writing (though I would be a bit more sure of that if I had read</em>\
  \ The Peculiarities of Prophetic Speech <em>more closely despite what I believe\
  \ to be a truly excessive number of footnotes). I am sure that Lorminos knows someone\
  \ who can confirm my beliefs if needed. That is if, of course, my Lady wants a set\
  \ of writings so inflammatory to be so widely seen. I am far from convinced of the\
  \ truth of any of them, and a single author could point as much to a singular troublemaker\
  \ wishing to create strife as someone with a sudden gift of foresight.</em></p>\n\

  \      <h2>The Death of Cayden Cailean</h2>\n      <p>Cayden Cailean had never thought\
  \ himself a liar. A storyteller, sure, in the tradition of the tavern, where convincing\
  \ someone of your worth might mean a refilled tankard. Who among his fellow patrons\
  \ hadn’t added enemies to boost their tale of combat or invented some new twice-trapped\
  \ room deep within the dungeon of a newly fallen foe? To claim that he’d become\
  \ a god was more than normal boasting, but he couldn’t quite remember what had happened\
  \ with the<em> Starstone</em>. Maybe he had passed its test and that was what kept\
  \ him alive. Maybe he’d become a god and godhood felt no different than mortal existence.\
  \ Maybe he would take another round of good ale on the house (a thank you from the\
  \ barkeep for the honor of his presence). Maybe as he told his tale he could almost\
  \ believe it. At least until the nightly dreams began.</p>\n      <p>They started\
  \ off as flashes, tiny moments in the dark of night—a clanging sword that echoed\
  \ down a long and shadowed hallway, the smell of new-cut marble turned impossibly\
  \ acrid, the taste of blood and honey in the space behind his tongue. And still,\
  \ no matter what they were, each vision woke him shuddering—skin drenched in sweat,\
  \ heart racing wildly, cold breeze crawling up his spine, a voice he’d never heard\
  \ before that whispered in his eardrums—<em>liar, drunkard, cheater, thief. One\
  \ day you will pay for this with everything you owe. </em></p>\n      <p>Cayden\
  \ Cailean would never call himself a cheater. How could he know belief alone could\
  \ make a deity? But every time the story spread that he had passed the Test of Starstone,\
  \ something shifted in him, brought him that much closer to true divinity. By the\
  \ time he heard his story chanted like a rowdy prayer, he was every inch the god\
  \ that he had claimed to be. He did his best to share the gift, empower those who\
  \ followed him, pass blessings out like cups of drink to those who strived for freedom.\
  \ But no good deed had earned him pity from the voice that stalked his dreams, a\
  \ whisper he now recognized as that of the <em>Starstone</em> itself, murmuring\
  \ about the flask that he kept tight against his waist—<em>forbidden, stolen, holy\
  \ power. There will be a reckoning. </em></p>\n      <p>The flask was Cayden’s property\
  \ from long before the <em>Starstone</em>, but now it held a draft he’d brought\
  \ back from the Cathedral—a distillation of the power held within its core. And\
  \ while he still could not remember what he’d done to make or bring it back, he\
  \ knew that every sip gave him a taste of the divine. His followers’ convictions\
  \ may have been the thing that made him a god, but all beliefs grow worn and frayed\
  \ and faded over time. No matter who believed in him, he knew one thing down to\
  \ his core: the liquid in his flask was what kept his lie alive.</p>\n      <p>But\
  \ every tiny sip of nectar took his dreams on twisted paths, until he dreamt of\
  \ death in the Cathedral every night. And after he had died each way the Test of\
  \ Starstone could devise—some with the sound of steel on bone, some with the fall\
  \ of flesh to floor, some with a bargain on his tongue that faded in a gasping breath—\
  it left him with a final and unalterable verdict: <em>time for you to pay your debt,\
  \ return to mortal life.</em></p>\n      <p>Cayden Cailean had never minded being\
  \ mortal, but as his story shifted, he mourned his legacy. Word spread, as words\
  \ are wont to do, of his deceitful rise to grace, and those who’d raised his name\
  \ in praise could barely muster pity. The innkeepers and brewers he’d counted as\
  \ his worshipers now barred him from their premises, afraid they would be thought\
  \ of as complicit in his lie, and soon the one-time god had faded out of public\
  \ life, so far removed that no one knows quite how and where he died. Some say it\
  \ happened in an alley, slumped over in the pouring rain, while others claim he\
  \ died in battle fighting for a righteous cause, or braved the <em>Starstone</em>\
  \ once again in one last fatal try.</p>\n      <p>Iomedae and Norgorber, as fellow\
  \ gods Ascended, both moved to quell the rumors that they had also cheated to obtain\
  \ divinity—Iomedae appearing on the front lines with her champions in tireless demonstrations\
  \ of her prowess on the battlefield and Norgorber eliminating each one of his followers\
  \ who dared to voice dissent or wonder who he used to be. But neither sees the true\
  \ change that still lurks along the margins, as one after another shop begins to\
  \ claim that, for a cost, you too can be transformed from mortal life to deity.\
  \ If all it takes is stories and a liquor no one understands (as noted in a few\
  \ reports of Cayden’s sad demise), then nothing stops a hundred shops from selling\
  \ sugar water and a complement of town criers to those who feel that being god is\
  \ next on their agenda—a warlord here, a despot there, the righteous and the vengeful—\
  and what new revolution might they bring if they do rise?</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  >\n       <br>\n      </center>\n      <p><em>A god created from belief alone? That\
  \ is both deeply intriguing and somewhat baffling, as this is the first report I’\
  ve read of such an occurrence. Surely if this were truly possible, I’d have encountered\
  \ it before in my studies. This will require more research, though with what time\
  \ I will pursue it I know not. It does make me wonder how many believers one might\
  \ have to acquire to cross the boundary from mortal to god, and whether belief was\
  \ nearly as important in this case as the </em>Starstone<em> nectar mentioned above.\
  \ I have no doubt that if someone were able to distill a liquor from a source of\
  \ pure divine power, it would be Cayden Cailean, but for those of us not blessed\
  \ with that specific set of skills, I am struck by the idea that you could solve\
  \ for number of believers and gain divinity simply by exceeding that threshold.\
  \ Equations are not my strong suit, but I may see if I can find a collaborator and\
  \ determine what that number might be. Though it might be difficult to do without\
  \ revealing where the idea has come from. Perhaps it would be better to wait until\
  \ I have all the prophecies properly analyzed and know what my Lady wishes to do\
  \ with them before I begin making them a basis for a new research field, but it\
  \ is hard not to get excited!</em></p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
