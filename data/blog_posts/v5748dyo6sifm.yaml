  \ spooky season, but also the new Pathfinder Adventure Path, Season of Ghosts! This\
  \ is the first Adventure Path I’ve been the lead developer on from the very start\
  \ since Age of Ashes, back when we were launching Second Edition Pathfinder. Since\
  \ then, I’ve worked on hardcover compilations, written for other Adventure Paths,\
  \ and developed ones that started with other folks who moved on to other opportunities.\
  \ All of which was a lot of fun, of course, but it’s nice to be back in the proverbial\
  \ saddle, creating outlines and plots from the start.</p>\n      <p>An Adventure\
  \ Path set in the spookiest of all locations in the continent of Tian-Xia is something\
  \ I’ve been eager to get moving for many years, and despite some schedule hiccups,\
  \ I’m delighted the campaign is finally here for folks to enjoy. There’s quite a\
  \ lot of plot twists and surprises in store for all of you destined to play through\
  \ this campaign—I’m eager to hear how things went down at all of your game tables,\
  \ but I also ask folks to make liberal use of the spoiler tag technology when speaking\
  \ about these adventures, so we can all preserve those surprises for players to\
  \ uncover as they progress through these four upcoming seasons of horror.</p>\n\

  \ Nortjé</p>\n      </div>\n      <p>One of the most exciting parts of the process\
  \ for me, though, was getting to work with such a wide range of amazing and talented\
  \ writers! It’s been eye-opening, educational, and wonderful to see what the authors’\
  \ various adventures and support articles have brought to each volume of Season\
  \ of Ghosts, bringing in an incredible range of inspiration from throughout Asia.\
  \ So, for the next four months, I’ve invited the authors of Season of Ghosts to\
  \ introduce themselves as the volumes they contributed to come out. In some cases,\
  \ authors wrote for multiple volumes, while in others (like this first one), only\
  \ a single author tackled the contents of the volume. So without further ado, take\
  \ it away, Sen H.H.S.!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\

  \      <p>Happy spookiness everyone! I'm Sen H.H.S., the writer of the first volume\
  \ of Season of Ghosts, “The Summer that Never Was.” I welcome you all to your beloved\
  \ town of Willowshore and the town's lovely inhabitants... along with the first\
  \ three months (or more!) of fears, horrors, and thrills you are about to face.\
  \ As someone who generally avoids ghost stories and the horror genre, writing this\
  \ adventure was an interesting challenge, though one I gladly took on to help establish\
  \ a baseline for how our PCs and the folks of Willowshore generally survive haunted\
  \ Shenmen day-to-day. Now that those usual strategies don't work though, it's time\
  \ to step up to the challenge. If you are interested in what I'm up to, you can\
  \ follow me on Bluesky at senhhs.bsky.social or you can see what I'm retweeting\
  \ on Twitter @SenHHS. For my past works, check out my website at https://senhhs.carrd.co/.\
  \ Otherwise, I'll see you all in the upcoming Tian Xia books AND [falls into the\
  \ NDA pit].</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/2358b9e2-e7ef-49a5-a899-49c0224cbeac/PZO90196_WALLOFGHOSTS_ShafiAdams_1572x2000.jpg\"\
