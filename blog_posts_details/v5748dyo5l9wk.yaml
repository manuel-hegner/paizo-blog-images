  artist: "a wailing cry which froze the blood of any victim not asleep. There was\
    \ a silent rush of menacing figures. It was impossible in the confusion of moonlight\
    \ and shadow to tell how many thugs were there. More than half a hundred, perhaps\
    \ twice that number, and one at least was capable of using potent heka. Whatever\
    \ casting he sent at them, both Inhetep and Rachelle were suddenly themselves\
    \ again. That is, their Hindi disguises were gone, and for the few heartbeats'\
    \ time the change required, neither could do aught but stand dazed, feeling the\
    \ effects of the transformation. \"Thugs!\" he managed to should to Rachelle.\
    \ \"Stranglers of Kali!\" There was no free passage for the attackers, however.\
    \ In a mere matter of heartbeats after the time the practitioner among the crazed\
    \ strangers activated his casting, Magister Inhetep had triggered one of his own\
    \ dweomers. There appeared a sudden smoke arc as a hundred separate sparks winked\
    \ into being. For a second these motes glowed, in the next they brightened into\
    \ a multi-hued array of blossoming fires, and but a second after that each began\
    \ its dance. A flight of them whizzed high in angry amber lines, making sounds\
    \ as hornets do. Others fluttered like butterflies with wings of flame. There\
    \ were a dozen bright blue serpentine paths traced along the ground, and violet\
    \ arcs as if grasshoppers were alight and on the move. Bright green embers jumped\
    \ toward the onrushing attackers as might insane frogs bent on meeting the assailants\
    \ in midair. Some spiraled aloft to spin and spit scintillating jets, which whirled\
    \ crazily as their erratic flight carried them outward"
