  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Our second\
  \ marathon is a wrap, so let’s get to it! In case you haven’t caught up on the <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7l?The-Abomination-Arsenal-Part-1\"\
  >first report</a>, our party of gunslingers succeeded in delving the top level of\
  \ the Abomination Vaults, but at a cost. We fared much better on this marathon:\
  \ we started to click more as a party and improved on some of the combat strategies\
  \ needed to pump lead into every monster in a megadungeon. It’s hard to say at this\
  \ point, but if we play as well through the remaining marathons as we did here,\
  \ we might just gun down the entire Abomination Vaults.</p> \n      <p>Order of\
  \ the Amber Die (OAD) members are spread out across the country, with about twelve-to-fifteen\
  \ active members at any given time. As we’ve shown in other blog reports, they’\
  ve flown in from places like <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shdq?Order-of-the-Amber-Die-Beyond-the-Veiled-Past\"\
  >Washington</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgur?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-5\"\
  >Rhode Island</a>, and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhfu?Giantslayer-Marathon-Part-2\"\
  >North Dakota</a> to our headquarters in New Jersey for days of gaming. It’s also\
  \ the norm for members to drive up to eight hours to be here. For this marathon\
  \ we really tapped into our membership with numerous cameos (all gunslingers of\
  \ course), turning the marathon into a mini reunion. The encounters got a bit harder\
  \ with more characters, but more guns meant more fun!</p> \n      <ul> \n      \
  \ <li><strong>Adventure:</strong> <em>Ruins of Gauntlight</em></li> \n       <li><strong>Marathon\
  \ Length:</strong> 59 hours</li> \n       <li><strong>Session Hours:</strong> 34\
  \ hours, 30 minutes</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>Our party, the Black Powder Cadre,\
  \ picked up where we left off by exploring levels two and three of the megadungeon.\
  \ We also continued developing our organization by employing the Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition organization rules, along with adding new gunslingers to our core four-character\
  \ roster. We’re a sizeable band, though the Black Powder Cadre doesn’t exactly take\
  \ the usual approach. We gave a false party name to town authorities, took the books\
  \ we recovered from the Vaults for ourselves, pickpocketed patrons in a tavern to\
  \ foster competition from another establishment, and lied to the mayor about a nefarious\
  \ incident involving Otari’s foremost librarian. What can we say, we like working\
  \ together!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3f9b628c-5288-48a7-a7fb-a6f7bc2f1bae/1-Devil_2000.png\"\

  \ from <em>Ruins of Gauntlight</em></h3> \n      <ul> \n       <li>The symbol of\
  \ the Black Powder Cadre is the harmona bird, and each of us wears a different shade\
  \ of blue to represent it. You can imagine our reaction when we ran into a cult\
  \ of blue-robed ghouls on level three of the Vaults. Someone had to establish dominance\
  \ over this precious primary color, and it wasn’t gonna be them. A fierce clash\
  \ in the library ensued and, despite improving our skillset with the dying condition,\
  \ we prevailed.</li> \n       <li>Megadungeon crawling is dirty business; so far\
  \ two characters have acquired Cocytan Filth and two more picked up Ghoul Fever.\
  \ We’d like to thank our sponsor and friend Vandy Banderdash, head priestess of\
  \ the Dawnflower Library! Frankly, Vandy is one of the main reasons we haven’t TPKed\
  \ yet.</li> \n       <li>When we decided to bring this many firearms into a megadungeon,\
  \ we knew there would be some heroic displays of marksmanship along the way. The\
  \ first nod goes to a cameo from Auralee, a veteran of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shta?Order-of-the-Amber-Die-The-Slithering-Salve\"\
  >The Slithering Salve</a>, who joined the Black Powder Cadre during this marathon\
  \ as “Lady Sniper.” She once put down four critical hits in two rounds, with a staggering\
  \ 36 damage scored from a single bullet as a 2nd-level character. Vlai’s dwarven\
  \ scattergun holds our next favorite record though, with six allies hit in just\
  \ one blast from the boomstick.</li> \n       <li>We finally came across something\
  \ that could outduel us: a wood golem. It beat us to the draw and fanned out 103\
  \ damage across four targets with a single splinter volley—respectable by any desperados\
  \ standards. We pulled steel and returned fire, but in the end decided to run. We'll\
  \ be back for another showdown in the next marathon.</li> \n       <li>We probably\
  \ shouldn’t have picked a fight with a bearded devil, but someone had an itchy trigger\
  \ finger. Before we knew it, two PCs were on the ground in horrible fashion. Mazatl,\
  \ practicing the Way of the Spellshot, scoped in hard and held his breath. The devil’\
  s chest exploded with a sound that was only slightly less gratifying than the natural\
  \ 20 as it landed on Erick’s copy of <em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em>.</li>\

  \ a party consisting entirely of gunslingers, so what makes each character stand\
  \ out—what gives them identity—isn't the same as other parties of the past. In this\
  \ campaign, it's your weapon and the way you use it that separates you from the\
  \ rest. The sound of a harmona gun is unmistakable, and you won't be hearing anything\
  \ for a while after Maloika fires it. The quick grouping of holes that tears open\
  \ the enemy in front of you comes from Breen, our pistolero. When a ghoul's dome\
  \ bursts into pieces from the far end of the hallway, that's Mazatl, our sniper.\
  \ And that sting in your back? That's Vlai with the scattergun. Out of game, it's\
  \ just as important to distinguish your gunslinger from the rest, and that's where\
  \ our props come in. Each player's weapon has been crafted and custom-painted to\
  \ look like the one they have in-game—it helps to have an artist at the table!</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Character Deaths</h3> \n      <p>None. Props to Matt, our player captain,\
  \ for the pre-marathon strategy posts in the Google Classroom.</p> \n      <h3>Best\
  \ Quote from Marathon 2</h3> \n      <p>Town notary: \"And your party's name?\"\
  <br> Zoric: \"Umm... the Blue Coat Adventurers.\"<br> Town notary: \"Very well...\"\
  <br> Party (to each other, bristling with firearms): \"Seriously, '<em>Blue Coat\
  \ Adventurers</em>'?\"</p> \n      <h3>Current Situation</h3> \n      <p>The Pathfinder\
  \ community was right when they said that we would run into some issues with a party\
  \ consisting entirely of gunslingers. That being said, this is OAD, and over the\
  \ years you've seen how competitive we can get. We've adapted to our main weakness,\
  \ which is any enemy with a high Armor Class. We've taken advantage of our strong\
  \ point, especially on level three, which is mass combat. In fact, the more enemies\
  \ the better—we make our own ammo and have plenty of it! We've managed to clear\
  \ most of level two and three at this point, discovered Otari's ghost once again,\
  \ and followed it down to level four. We've done pretty well with discovering lore,\
  \ so we have a decent idea of what once happened on the upper levels of the Vaults.\
  \ As for what lies beneath, that's a different matter…</p> \n      <div class=\"\
