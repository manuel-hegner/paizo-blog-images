  artist: "12:01 PM Pacific Standard Time on Thursday, November 29th. Good Luck! Question\
    \ #3 Solution: Congratulations to Jonathan Cruz who correctly answered \"10th\"\
    \ to last week's question. We got a number of creative answers (some that involved\
    \ level drain), but \"10th\" was the correct answer, as Kyra would need to pick\
    \ up two feats to qualify for the Spherewalker prestige class. Jason Bulmahn GameMastery\
