  \ by Remko Troost</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>In classic vesk fashion, Obozaya\
  \ Ymeros lets her friends shorten her name to \"Obo,\" but not even Damoritosh himself\
  \ can protect those who attempt to use her nickname without earning it first.</p>\
  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Obozaya was born on Vesk Prime, the planetary\
  \ capital of the Veskarium, to a family of low-level military bureaucrats. Distinguishing\
  \ herself with her determination and ferocity on the sports field and in the dueling\
  \ ring—if not in her academic studies—Obozaya quickly established herself as a top-notch\
  \ military cadet, enlisting as soon as her basic studies were complete.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Obozaya took to military life like a swamp lion to water, and soon outpaced\
  \ many in her cohort. In Veskarium society, social status is most easily earned\
  \ through excellence in combat, and Obo had no desire to spend her entire life at\
  \ the same forgettable rank as her parents. Though her dreams of glory were hardly\
  \ unique, she nevertheless proved herself in several early battles, putting down\
  \ a vicious rebellion among the feline barbarians of Vesk-6.</p> \n     <p>Yet in\
  \ her youthful arrogance, Obozaya overlooked the power of political connection.\
  \ After dueling and deeply shaming another member of her unit—one with family ties\
  \ to high-ranking military officials—she found herself promoted and assigned to\
  \ patrol a section of frozen tundra on Vesk-8, where the staunchly pacifist residents\
  \ refused to give her any opportunity for righteous combat. It soon became clear\
  \ that neither appeals to her superiors nor prayers to Damoritosh the Conqueror\
  \ were going to get her a better assignment. Thus, as her first term of enlistment\
  \ drew to a close, a frustrated Obozaya took the Soldier's Due, the time-honored\
  \ vesk tradition of being honorably discharged and taking your government-issue\
  \ armor and weapons with you.</p> \n     <p>Still in love with the idea of one day\
  \ becoming a major player in vesk society, and disgusted by the idea that politics\
  \ could exist within the Veskarium's vaunted military meritocracy, Obozaya followed\
  \ in the footsteps of many other legendary vesk warriors and left home to work as\
  \ a mercenary in the Pact Worlds. Here, at last, she found what she'd been searching\
  \ for: an endless series of battles and adventures, with no restrictions but her\
  \ own sense of honor. Rather than signing on with an established mercenary company,\
  \ Obozaya found herself better suited to working with small groups of explorers\
  \ and adventurers. Small teams mean more glory per person when you succeed, and\
  \ she often finds herself the sole front-line fighter on a crew, which appeals to\
  \ both her vanity and her showboating style. As she's fond of saying, battle is\
  \ too important to leave to amateurs, and Obozaya believes that the best way to\
  \ win a fight is to move fast and hit hard. Though she's drifted away from Damoritosh's\
  \ faith in recent years, coming to appreciate some other races' criticisms of the\
  \ Conqueror, she still adores using his sacred doshko for her close-up fighting.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Personality-wise, Obozaya is a study in contrasts. While she appreciates\
  \ material wealth and creature comforts, her true desire is for recognition. This\
  \ is perhaps best exemplified by the holoprojector on her back, which usually projects\
  \ a modified version of Damoritosh's symbol to advertise her as a warrior for hire,\
  \ but which is capable of projecting a personalized holographic war-banner in combat\
  \ to make sure the enemy knows exactly who's coming for them. Brilliant on the battlefield,\
  \ Obozaya nevertheless finds herself a little slow on the draw in most intellectual\
  \ pursuits, having little patience for any education not directly related to her\
  \ vocation. She believes that honor demands honesty, and while she's not against\
  \ lying by omission, she would rather die than break her word or renege on a contract.\
  \ In conversations with new people, she's either unnervingly stoic or direct to\
  \ the point of rudeness, and thinks that most species talk more than they need to\
  \ as an attempt to cover up their cowardice.</p> \n     <p>All of which makes it\
  \ that much more surprising to discover how much her companions adore her. Sure,\
  \ Obo may explain her loyalty as a mercenary's pragmatism, yet everyone in her crew\
  \ knows they can count on \"the big lizard\" to pull them out of a scrape, no matter\
  \ the cost. As with many vesk, her gruff manner is punctuated with sudden outpourings\
  \ of emotion, and with her characteristic directness, Obo finds no fear or shame\
  \ in telling her friends how much she loves them. Much of her life is spent on or\
  \ training for missions, yet when Obozaya sets out to celebrate a success, it's\
  \ with her trademark bombastic zeal. Eschewing the berserker drugs favored by some\
  \ of her kindred, she's nevertheless fond of the Veskarium nose-hookahs sometimes\
  \ called \"dragon's breath,\" as well as the mildly hallucinogenic brain snails\
  \ of Vesk-2 and other traditional vesk snacks. More than one bar has been sacrificed\
  \ to (and well compensated for) her parties, and the heavy bass of her beloved revelaz\
  \ dance-pop beats is notorious for bursting rivets on ship bulkheads.</p> \n   \
