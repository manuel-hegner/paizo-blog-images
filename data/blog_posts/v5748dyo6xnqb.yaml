  \ Cisco. I’m a TV/Film and TTRPG Writer with credits most recently on <em>Star Trek:\
  \ Discovery</em>, Pathfinder, <em>Daggerheart</em>,<em>Candela Obscura</em>, and\
  \ <em>Draw Steel</em>. I have a deep and abiding love of horror, fantasy, sci fi,\
  \ and collective action, and a deep and abiding hate for the ravages of late-stage\
  \ capitalism… which fed into how I approached working on Abadar, a god of civilization,\
  \ trade, and capital. Gods of money are complex beasts, and I wanted to explore\
  \ how bad actors might manipulate his words and doctrine for personal gain. This\
  \ work also fed into my work on the Death of the Divine, which embraced a new and\
  \ complicated layer to Abadar’s story.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Now that <em>Divine Mysteries</em> is out in the world, I'm even more\
  \ proud to have contributed to this amazing book! As a freelancer, I've worked on\
  \ a handful of Paizo products including <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, the Curtain Call\
  \ Adventure Path, and some forthcoming books! For <em>Divine Mysteries</em>, I was\
  \ overjoyed to write the article on Pharasma, Lady of Graves. As an unrepentant\
  \ goth, and someone for whom life, death, and fate are all very important, Pharasma\
  \ has always been my favorite deity, and getting to add my voice to her body of\
  \ work is something I'm very thankful for! A thousand compliments to the developers,\
  \ editors, and art team for making this book a phenomenal guide to all things holy\
  \ (and unholy)!</p>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n      <table class=\"image\" align=\"\

  \ about a society by the gods they worship and the lessons their legends hold, so\
  \ getting to create and add to that for the world of Golarion was wonderful! Writing\
  \ Lamashtu was especially exciting for me because my first Pathfinder character\

  \ I got to work on projects like <em>Seas of Vodari</em> and <em>Under the Seas\

  \ are often overlooked in many fantasy stories and roleplaying games. Additionally,\

  \ about my work on&nbsp;<em>Divine Mysteries</em>. You can find my writing in the\
  \ Asmodeus section and the Qlippoth Lords. I’m especially proud of my contributions\

  \ introduction of a new Qlippoth Lord, Nyuo-Ogh, the Always Observing. Besides freelancing,\

  \ and watching them grow and evolve and become something more amazing than I ever\
  \ could have done on my own thanks to the input and imagination of so many other\

  \ (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here! You might know me from\
  \ my work co-creating Pathfinder Second Edition, including serving as the primary\
  \ design lead for the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder\
  \ Advanced Player’s Guide</em>. In D<em>ivine Mysteries</em>, I was thrilled to\
  \ create a brand-new deity embodying darkness in a different sense than we usually\
  \ see. I love deities and mythology, and despite working on a lot of different books\
  \ at Paizo, I happened to not have a chance to write a new deity until now, so I'm\
  \ beyond excited! These days, you can find me creating all sorts of compatible products\
  \ for Pathfinder Second Edition over&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a title=\"This external link\
  \ opens in a new window\" href=\"https://battlezoo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Roll\
  \ for Combat</a>.&nbsp;You can also check my YouTube stream, Arcane Mark, with fellow\

  \ Sayre</h3>\n      <p>Hello! I'm Michael Sayre, the former director of Rules &amp;\
  \ Lore at Paizo. I worked on the Razmir entries for <em>Divine Mysteries</em>, as\
  \ well as segments of the orc and Sarkorian deities and some other bits and pieces\
  \ scattered throughout the book. In the aftermath of the Godsrain I've moved on\
  \ to work with other organizations like the High Int Low Wis podcast [<a title=\"\

  \ projects that will be going public early next year. I'll be a bit quiet as I spend\
  \ the holiday season taking care of family who have been dealing with medical emergencies,\
  \ but as I ramp back up you'll be able to follow me for updates on my Bluesky account,\

  \ (she/her)</h3>\n      <p>Hey all, I'm Isis Wozniakowska and I wrote both the Battle\
  \ Harbinger and the new article on Nethys. I've always loved magic and fantasy and\
  \ most especially wizard nonsense so it was a treat to work on this project and\
  \ get to work with magic and the divine. I got into my field of Comparative Literature\
  \ from an early fascination with mythology and so tales of the divine hold a very\
  \ special place in my heart, and I hope I managed to let that shine through here.\
  \ I was super excited to tackle Battle Harbinger since I was, early on, someone\
  \ who really wanted a more martial combat ready style of cleric. I'm currently making\
  \ my way through an MA so I don't have too many active projects right now but I\
  \ am occasionally on Bluesky under <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/wozenstein.bsky.social\"\
  >@wozenstein</a>, where I mostly talk about books I read and sometimes video games\

  \ <p>Hi, I’m&nbsp;Sebastian Yūe, an award-winning game designer, writer, and editor.\
  \ I’m proud to have put my spin on Calistria and Irori for this book. I sought to\
  \ bring themes of queer and trans self-expression to these deities; though vastly\
  \ different, they both encourage the embracement of the authentic self. Pathfinder\
  \ 1e was the first TTRPG I ever played and my first character was a paladin of Irori.\
  \ It’s been a joy to revisit the god of self-perfection after a long journey of\
  \ my own.&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</em>&nbsp;is my first\
  \ title with Paizo. When I’m not writing TTRPGs, I’m publishing them as the publishing\
  \ coordinator at Hit Point Press, and when I’m not working at all, I’m teaching\
  \ myself to draw, going on hikes, or writing short stories with original characters.\
