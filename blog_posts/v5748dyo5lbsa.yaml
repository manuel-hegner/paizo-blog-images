  \ series of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/designTuesdays\">Design Tuesday</a> blogs\
  \ exploring Intelligent Magic Items. Part 1 of this series can be found <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lbrd\">here</a>. </p> \n   <p><b>Intelligent Magic Items: Part\
  \ 2</b></p> \n   <p>Last week, we examined the basics of adding an intelligent magic\
  \ item to your campaign. This week, we are investigating the process of determining\
  \ the powers and abilities of intelligent magic items. While this process is not\
  \ too complicated, what powers are given to an item greatly influence how it interacts\
  \ with the game.</p> \n   <p>The process used in building intelligent magic items\
  \ is relatively straightforward, moving from one step to the next, but there are\
  \ a number of particular tips that are worth noting.</p> \n   <p><b>Cost</b>: The\
  \ price for an intelligent magic item can go up very quickly. As a result, intelligent\
  \ magic items tend to be out of the reach of most low-level characters. This is\
  \ one area, however, where the GM can relax the usual wealth guidelines a bit if\
  \ it serves the story. In addition, the item might not have access to or choose\
  \ to use certain abilities until its possessor is suitably experienced, meaning\
  \ that the item's approximate value might increase over time, making it more affordable\
  \ at lower levels. This can even extend to the powers granted by the base item on\
  \ which the intelligent item is built. For example, an intelligent <i>ring of protection</i>\
  \ might start out granting a +1 deflection bonus and be perfectly suitable for a\
  \ low-level hero, but as time goes on, this bonus might increase and other abilities\
  \ might reveal themselves as the ring learns to trust its possessor.</p> \n   <p><b>Ego</b>:\
  \ Most of the time, an intelligent magic item is more than willing to work with\
  \ its possessor, but those with a high ego often try to control the relationship.\
  \ When building an item, you should decide how its personality affects its ego score.\
  \ While not all items act in this way, the following general guidelines should help\
  \ you determine the item's personality. Items with an ego less than 10 are generally\
  \ passive, willing to work with their possessors almost unquestioningly. Items with\
  \ egos between 11 and 19 are confident and sometimes quarrel with their possessors\
  \ if it is something they are passionate about. Items with egos between 20 and 30\
  \ are arrogant and believe they know what is best almost all the time. They are\
  \ difficult to control. An item with an ego greater than 30 almost always tries\
  \ to dominate the situation, seeing its possessor as a vessel for its supreme will,\
  \ a tool to be used to achieve its ends.</p> \n   <p><b>Base Item</b>: The base\
  \ item can tell you a lot about the item and its story. As a general rule, items\
  \ with interesting mechanics make for better base items. A <i>cloak of arachnida</i>\
  \ is a lot more evocative than a <i>cloak of resistance +2</i>, but it is not always\
  \ a bad thing to have a less interesting item as basis of an intelligent item. The\
  \ <i>cloak of resistance</i> is more of a blank slate, allowing you to associate\
  \ nearly any personality with the item, whereas the <i>cloak of arachnida</i> only\
  \ makes sense with backgrounds and personalities of a specific flavor.</p> <a href=\"\
  /gameMastery/itemPacks/v5748btpy8g7n\"><img src=\"/image/content/CarrionCrown/PZO3017-Cloak_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"9\"></a> \n   <p>Keeping these in mind,\
  \ along with the item's background and story, deciding on most of its powers and\
  \ abilities is an easy process. The most interesting part is deciding on its powers\
  \ and special purpose (if it has one). While Table 15–24 gives a good starting point\
  \ for powers, it is not particularly evocative, primarily because the powers on\
  \ this list are made to be used with any magic item in the game. You should feel\
  \ free to use these as a guideline to design specific powers that better fit the\
  \ item's theme, type, and backstory. To assist you in this process, here is a list\
  \ of new powers designed for specific item types or story ideas, including their\
  \ costs and ego modifiers.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Hiding</b>: The item\
  \ can make itself invisible as per the spell once per day. Although it cannot be\
  \ actively used while hidden in this way, any constant powers or bonuses it grants\
  \ or possesses remain active. <b>Item Type</b>: Any. <b>Price Modifier</b>: 1,200\
  \ gp. <b>Ego Modifier</b>: +1.</p> \n    <p><b>Leaping</b>: The item can leap to\
  \ its possessor's hand or become instantly equipped. As long as the possessor has\
  \ the item on his person, as a free action he can call out to the item, causing\
  \ it to jump into his hand (if that is how it is wielded) or equip itself in the\
  \ appropriate slot (if it takes up a slot). Items that are not wielded or do not\
  \ take up a slot cannot have this power. The possessor must have a free hand or\
  \ the appropriate slot free for this ability to function. <b>Item Type</b>: Special.\
  \ <b>Price Modifier</b>: 2,000 gp. <b>Ego Modifier</b>: +1.</p> \n    <p><b>Maneuvering</b>:\
  \ Whenever this weapon is used to perform one specific type of combat maneuver,\
  \ usually disarm or sunder, the possessor receives a +2 bonus on the check and does\
  \ not provoke attacks of opportunity when attempting the combat maneuver. This does\
  \ not stack with the bonus gained from the feat that grants the same bonus, such\
  \ as Improved Disarm. <b>Item Type</b>: Weapon. <b>Price Modifier</b>: 8,000 gp.\
  \ <b>Ego Modifier</b>: +1.</p> \n    <p><b>Proficiency</b>: The possessor is automatically\
  \ considered proficient in the weapon's use. This power does not grant the possessor\
  \ the ability to use other weapons of the same type or to use this magically granted\
  \ proficiency to meet prerequisites. <b>Item Type</b>: Weapon. <b>Price Modifier</b>:\
  \ 2,000 gp. <b>Ego Modifier</b>: +1.</p> \n    <br><b>Recharging</b>: The item regains\
  \ one charge each day that it does not use a power that consumes a charge. If the\
  \ item is a wand, it is not destroyed when it is reduced to 0 charges. The item\
  \ cannot have more charges than its maximum (50 for a wand, 10 for a staff). <b>Item\
  \ Type</b>: Staff, Wand, or other charged item. <b>Price Modifier</b>: 18,000 gp.\
  \ <b>Ego Modifier</b>: +2.\n    <p></p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>In addition to\
  \ powers, you might want to consider giving the item a drawback or two, to fit with\
  \ its flavor. These drawbacks reduce the ego of the item, but do not otherwise affect\
  \ its cost. An item should not have more than one drawback. A caster that crafts\
  \ an intelligent item cannot build it with a drawback. These develop naturally over\
  \ time or as the result of a botched creation attempt.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n\
  \    <p><b>Forgetful</b>: The item does not remember its possessor. Each morning\
  \ it treats its possessor as if it does not know him. As a result, he must constantly\
  \ earn its trust. <b>Ego Modifier</b>: –1.</p> \n    <p><b>Secretive</b>: The item's\
  \ special powers are not discernable by <i>detect magic</i> or <i>identify</i>.\
  \ The special powers can be identified with <i>analyze dweomer</i>. The powers and\
  \ the abilities of the base item can be learned normally. <b>Ego Modifier</b>: –\
  1.</p> \n    <p><b>Singing</b>: The item sings or talks at inappropriate times,\
  \ giving its possessor a –4 penalty on Stealth skill checks. The item must possess\
  \ the ability to speak to have this drawback. <b>Ego Modifier</b>: –1.</p> \n  \
  \  <p><b>Split</b>: The item has two alignments, and each day the GM determines\
  \ which one of the alignments manifests. These alignments are always opposite one\
  \ another. <b>Ego Modifier</b>: –2.</p> \n    <p><b>Uncaring</b>: The item does\
  \ not care about its possessor's safety or goals, and will gladly put him in harm's\
  \ way if it gets the item closer to its purpose. As a result, the possessor must\
  \ make a Will save against the item's Ego each day. If the save fails, the item\
  \ does not function that day, unless events or the actions of the possessor bring\
  \ it closer to its purpose. <b>Ego Modifier</b>: –3.</p> \n    <p><b>Unreliable</b>:\
  \ The item is very old and has forgotten how to reliably use its abilities. Whenever\
  \ a possessor attempts to use its powers, there is a 25% chance that the power does\
  \ not work. <b>Ego Modifier</b>: –2.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>That about wraps\
  \ up our look at creating intelligent magic items. Next week we'll conclude this\
  \ series by giving you a number of sample intelligent magic items.</p> \n   <p style=\"\
