  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">Far from home as it was, the city of Wati was comforting,\
  \ familiar somehow to Estra. Though her old ears struggled to understand the exotic\
  \ tongues the local merchants spoke, the shopkeepers were always excessively polite.\
  \ This was a city that embraced death, lived next door to death. Respecting the\
  \ elderly was etched into the bones of Osirion culture.</p> \n    <p>The young man\
  \ managing the auction offered Estra a well-muscled arm and led her to a soft cushion\
  \ to rest. \"May I?\" he asked, unfurling the small carpet she kept tucked under\
  \ her arm. His voice was rich and warm as he comforted, \"Ask for Ptemenib if you\
  \ desire for anything else, Honored Grandmother.\" She didn't need the seat; she\
  \ felt as spry as a woman half her age.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ point allowed her to watch the stevedores fill the Canny Jackal's storeroom with\
  \ treasures scavenged this morning from the necropolis. Grave goods crafted in a\
  \ dozen different dynasties shuffled through the doors, glittering gold and lapis\
  \ in the light of the oil lamps. Occasionally, pieces of the dead carefully wrapped\
  \ in blessed linen joined the gaudy trinkets on the storeroom shelves. She spotted\
  \ what appeared to be a severed hand and gasped. \"No worries, Love,\" the gruff\
  \ voice at the back of her mind reassured, \"he deserved it.\"</p> \n    <p>A cleric\
  \ of Nethys appeared from the shadows. He was looking for someone.</p> \n    <div\

  \ was about to admonish Honaire with her favorite line from the parable of <i>Pharasma\
  \ and Forgiveness</i> when the exuberant shouting of the auction broke into screams.\
  \ A crash-tumble of precious objects clattered to the floor as the mummified remains\
  \ crawled off the shelves. A falcon-headed canopic jar rolled into the bidding room,\
  \ cracking against a stone column. The abomination that spilled forth was malevolent\
  \ and... juicy.</p> \n    <p>\"There!\" Honaire spotted movement through the window.\
  \ A golden-masked figure dashed into an alleyway, the cleric of Nethys in close\
  \ pursuit.</p> \n    <p>Outside, merchants hunched over their wares. It was all\
  \ they could do to protect them from the panicked customers desperate to escape\
  \ the vanth stalking above.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ around Estra, young wills broke and they ran for safety. There was danger, sure.\
  \ Estra had seen the chaos of death many times before. In the withering gasps of\
  \ a sick child in her arms, in the bewilderment of restless battlefield shades,\
  \ as the light faded from the eyes of her own Honaire, death marked the beginning\
  \ of a new journey. In this hot and sandy place, on this journey through ancient\
  \ graves, she carried the wisdom of Pharasma. A powerful ill will was causing the\
  \ dead to rise. She could help, but only one at a time.</p> \n    <p>The screams\
  \ pouring in from the street broke as the crowd passed. In its wake, a woman in\
  \ mourning garb glared daggers at all who passed. With kohl-rimmed eyes streaked\
  \ by tears, she was quite young to be widowed. Cold, dark energy coalesced about\
  \ her arms, ready to defend the figure still wearing his funerary shroud shuffling\
  \ behind her. This poor woman reminded Estra of her younger self. She remembered\
  \ the black well of loss, her desperate screams into the oblivion that claimed her\
  \ beloved. Her old heart cracked, then broke. Her love poured forth in a plume of\
  \ vivid ectoplasm that took shape around her.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
