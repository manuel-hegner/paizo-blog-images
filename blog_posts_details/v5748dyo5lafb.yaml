  artist: "the artist Escher.\" Turns out, Rich also channeled M. R. James, Dante,\
    \ Freud, and more, with strange psychological tests, deadly curses, devious traps,\
    \ and more awaiting your PCs within. Yet it's the Outcast King who takes the crown.\
    \ Check him out, in all of his handsome majesty! (And no, I'm not going to reveal\
    \ what he is!)"
