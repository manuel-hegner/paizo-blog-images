  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Ed Greenwood</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: An End to All\
  \ Skulking Games</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>\"Helms don't\
  \ have feelings,\" a sultry female voice announced sharply. \"They <i>really</i>\
  \ don't care if you leave them in those crates. Now <i>go</i>. Bendrar and I need\
  \ to confer.\"</p> <span itemprop=\"description\"><p>Boots went, hastily.</p> <p>From\
  \ her hiding place behind a stack of shipping crates, Tantaerra leaned forward,\
  \ trying to get as close to the conversation as possible without being seen. Bendrar\
  \ was Loryn Garldrake's son, and the woman giving orders had to be Semdeira Sarpent.</p></span>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Ah, good, good, you're both here,\" said a hearty voice; Loryn Garldrake.\
  \ \"Ben, we were hoping to leave you out of this, but things have changed, and we\
  \ need you to be able to say and do just the right things if you're questioned by\
  \ the guard. This is all happening rather fast, but... uh...\"</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br>Semdeira is just like the blades she sells—hard and sharp.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>\"Let me,\" Sarpent interrupted firmly. \"Our plan has always\
  \ been to find a scapegoat for when the General Lords send for us, someone we can\
  \ blame for tricking us—supplying us with inferior weapons and armor. A scapegoat\
  \ who promptly gets killed, the body too damaged for any priest to work with. The\
  \ dead defend themselves poorly. He takes the blame, we pay whatever fines the Lords\
  \ want to levy, and if need be we depart Molthune. The problem is, a certain official\
  \ here in Canorate is suspicious of us already. Too soon.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We intended\
  \ to frame Alsaerdus,\" Bendrar's father put in, \"and rid ourselves of a big creditor,\
  \ but he's out of the country. So we need someone else. Right now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Hence Master Hroalund,\" Sarpent purred. \"Knife-hurler and trap-spinner. Who insists\
  \ on providing his own knives for his traps, and has many suppliers, some Drumish—\
  and high Molthuni officials dislike those who have too much to do with foreigners.\
  \ What we sent to kill him the fastest, tidiest way failed, but our cleverness at\
  \ engaging him has brought him right here, and we have his demise in hand right\
  \ now. When he's dead, we'll claim to have killed him <i>and</i> his assistants\
  \ in a desperate fight, because they tried to murder us when we confronted Hroalund\
  \ about shoddy knives he'd provided to us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're going to, ah,\
  \ kill him <i>here</i>? Now?\" Bendrar sounded nervous. </p> \n    <p>\"No.\" Sarpent's\
  \ voice was crisp. \"At his shop. If the bloodcoats want to search and pry, we want\
  \ them to be confiscating and rummaging his stock, not ours.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Never\
  \ you mind where and when yet, son. For now, get out to the front counter before\
  \ Indur and Yelhar do anything foolish, and run things until closeup. Make certain\
  \ no patron gets near Hroalund or sees his work. A trap someone's seen is useless\
  \ to us.\"</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra heard Bendrar hurry away.</p> \n    <p>\"Tonight,\"\
  \ Garldrake muttered. \"Velar will come at nightfall. Shall I tell him to bring\
  \ Urling and Taethur?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No. Too apt to be clumsily over-enthusiastic.\
  \ We need far quieter, during and after. I know who to get.\"</p> \n    <p>In her\
  \ hiding place, Tantaerra grit her teeth. That was it, then. Garldrake and Sarpent\
  \ had to die, or the lives lost would be hers and the Master's. The rest of the\
  \ staff she could take down with her sleeping darts–without their masters, the underlings\
  \ would be no problem when they awoke, if indeed they even knew of the plan. For\
  \ Sarpent and Garldrake, though...</p> \n    <p>Well, mercy was just one of many\
  \ things a humble slave couldn't afford. </p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Nine darts were gone, all well sped, and the Master long since headed\
  \ home by the time Bendrar Garldrake met the tenth—and dropped a decanter as he\
  \ slumped.</p> \n    <p>The crash brought Loryn Garldrake around the corner at a\
  \ run. He had a decanter of his own. Upon seeing a dark-swathed assassin—even a\
  \ half-sized one—standing above his unmoving son, he howled and threw the glass\
  \ carafe without hesitation.</p> \n    <p>It shattered just above Tantaerra's head,\
  \ drenching her with something reeking and sticky.</p> \n    <p>She ran, but Garldrake\
  \ snatched a long horse-lance down from a wall-rack and used it more wisely than\
  \ she expected. Instead of trying to spit her, he swung it like a club, raking her\
  \ feet out from under her.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra landed groaningly hard on her\
  \ hip against a wardrobe—and <i>then</i> he lowered the lance to run her through.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Hah! Roast halfling on a spit tonight!\"</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra promptly\
  \ grabbed the wardrobe doors and toppled the massive thing over on top of herself.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The falling furniture caught the lance-tip and bore it down. It shrieked\
  \ along, digging a deep gouge out of the polished floor, before breaking—but held\
  \ up more than long enough for a hurrying halfling to hurl herself out from under\
  \ the wardrobe.</p> \n    <p>And turn to race right up the lance-shaft at its wielder.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Garldrake got his belt-dagger out and slashed at her viciously, forcing\
  \ her to leap aside, but her next leap slammed her headfirst into his crotch.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Garldrake shrieked and went down, and Tantaerra jumped up and down on\
  \ his nearest ankle, repeatedly, until something broke under her.</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ shrieked—and suddenly Semdeira Sarpent and three ruthless-looking men were in\
  \ the room, drawn daggers gleaming in every hand.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra used her\
  \ next dart to stab Garldrake, and fled.</p> \n    <p>The rooms were dark, and there\
  \ were many of them, but after three she saw the curtains and remembered the chart.\
  \ The Master never seemed to hurry, but his work was swift, and she was shorter\
  \ than the height his trap-bows would be set to fire at in here, so one of them\
  \ should be just... <i>here</i>.</p> \n    <p>It was. Not loaded, but cocked and\
  \ with its trip-line in position. Ready to demonstrate to Garldrake and Sarpent\
  \ when—</p> \n    <p>Well, why not now?</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra dropped a dart into\
  \ the little launcher's maw as she passed, then ducked around behind the next shelf.\
  \ Deliberately jostled armor clattered.</p> \n    <p>One of the killers chasing\
  \ her went for the bait, but Tantaerra was already two shelves away, loading trap-bows\
  \ for all she was worth. She heard his heavy fall, grinned, and went right on scurrying,\
  \ keeping low.</p> \n    <p>Before she slipped out of that room, a second of Sarpent's\
  \ professional slayers had gone down.</p> \n    <p>Whereupon a tense, straining\
  \ silence fell. Sarpent and her last slayer were closing in far more warily, and\
  \ Tantaerra was running low on darts.</p> \n    <p>If she didn't move fast, they'd—\
  </p> \n    <p>Too late. A door closed, and she was shut in an end room full of stock\
  \ shelves.</p> \n    <p>She could hear her pursuers hastily moving things on the\
  \ other side of the door. Blocking aisles, no doubt. Those display frames of spears\
  \ and lances, set on their sides, would make deadly walls of sharp points. And a\
  \ cargo net from their back room draped over the shelves could entrap a climbing\
  \ or leaping halfling.</p> \n    <p>Then came a sound she knew well. Twice. Thrice.\
  \ Three crossbows cocked, and no doubt loaded and laid ready.</p> \n    <p>Bright\
  \ light flared under the closed door. Then the door slid open, and Tantaerra saw\
  \ the last assassin standing ready with a crossbow.</p> \n    <p>The light came\
  \ from an unshuttered storm lantern Sarpent was carrying into the room with a stepstool.\
  \ All menacing catlike grace, she hung it on a ceiling-hook, lighting the room brightly.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Let there be an end to all skulking games,\" she purred smugly, retreated\
  \ to the doorway, and took up a loaded crossbow of her own.</p> \n    <p>Then she\
  \ and her hired killer waited.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra, comfortably flat on the floor\
  \ under a shelf, smiled coldly, and resolved to wait them out.</p> \n    <p>Time\
  \ unfolded.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>A lot of tense silence\
  \ stretched before Sarpent and the assassin grew restless enough to enter the room\
  \ and explore.</p> \n    <p>Which was Tantaerra's cue.</p> \n    <p>She heaved herself\
  \ up off the floor, shoulders against one side of the shelf above her, and toppled\
  \ it toward the doorway.</p> \n    <p>It crashed into the shelf next to it, and\
  \ both shelves groaned, leaned, and started to fall. The swearing assassin got clear\
  \ just in time—and the lantern fell, bounced clangingly amid falling stock, and\
  \ ended up on the floor, half-crushed but alight. Tantaerra tossed her hood into\
  \ its blazing interior.</p> \n    <p>Flames flared up, spreading swiftly across\
  \ the polished floor, and Semdeira Sarpent spat something less than ladylike. Tantaerra\
  \ scuttled along that aisle, back into darkness, straining to see where her foes\
  \ were.</p> \n    <p>As it turned out, they were both in the room with her and staring\
  \ at the open doorway, waiting for her to try to dart through it. Tantaerra found\
  \ something suitable on a shelf and threw it through the opening—and two crossbow\
  \ bolts chased it.</p> \n    <p>The flames spread merrily, and she repeated the\
  \ gambit. Just one bolt, this time. Neither of them went for her next throw, but\
  \ a distant shout told her someone had smelled smoke, and when she flung something\
  \ much larger—a shield—two bolts rang off it.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra knew how long\
  \ it took to recock a crossbow. Line and trap ready through her belt, she risked\
  \ a run.</p> \n    <p>There was Sarpent. Throwing a knife at her.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra\
  \ sneered. <i>She'd</i> demonstrate knife-hurling—and did, her own spinning blade\
  \ striking aside the one coming at her.</p> \n    <p>The last hired assassin came\
  \ charging out of the darkness. He avoided the little trap she was dragging along\
  \ with contemptuous ease, but Tantaerra slowed, then sprinted again and tugged on\
  \ the tripline. The little trap-bow sprang through the air and landed under the\
  \ man's boots. He stumbled, staggered, clawed at her—and Tantaerra stabbed him through\
  \ that reaching hand with one of her sleep-poisoned darts.</p> \n    <p>Then she\
  \ was through the door into the next room, with Sarpent hard on her heels.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Time to play the agile little monkey. Tantaerra swarmed the nearest shelf\
  \ to get out of reach.</p> \n    <p>There were the lance-barriers, and there was\
  \ the netting overhead, just as she'd suspected. Sarpent jumped and grabbed at it,\
  \ trying to pin Tantaerra atop the shelf—and succeeded.</p> \n    <p>She was stuck,\
  \ but not helpless. Tantaerra snatched up pieces of armor from the shelf and flung\
  \ them at Sarpent's face, one after another, until she saw blood on that enraged\
  \ but hitherto unmarred visage.</p> \n    <p>\"Who <i>are</i> you, you little <i>rat</i>?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"A concerned citizen,\" Tantaerra panted, not slowing her armor-flinging.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The arms-dealer tried to fend off the rain of sharp metal and get closer.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Citizen? You're a <i>halfling</i>! Slave, more like!\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You want my Master dead—my master who's done no ill to you!\"</p> \n    <p>\"So\
  \ you're Hroalund's wench, then? I should have known. But well enough—showing the\
  \ guards how you attacked us in our own shop can only help us when we explain how\
  \ we were forced to kill you both in self-defense!\"</p> \n    <p>Then Semdeira\
  \ Sarpent was close enough, with a needle-rapier in hand. She stabbed at Tantaerra.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Who kicked out at it, desperately—and shrieked as her foot got skewered.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Sarpent snarled and pressed the advantage, stabbing again and again.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Tantaerra twisted and arched and flung stock frantically, emptying the\
  \ shelf and getting free of the netting. Sometime during all of that, the rapier\
  \ skidded along her side, slicing open smoke suit and skin beneath.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ felt icy, and there was a lot of blood on her and all over the shelf.</p> \n \
  \   <p>She flung herself at Sarpent and managed to scissor her legs around the woman's\
  \ sword arm, clinging to the blade's ornate knuckle guard and bearing the rapier\
  \ down. Sarpent slapped at her, and Tantaerra clawed right back, the room a whirl\
  \ around them as the arms-dealer tried to shake her off the blade. Sarpent tore\
  \ at her ear and hair—and Tantaerra slapped her fingers across her foe's face, smearing\
  \ her own sticky spilled blood into those glaring eyes.</p> \n    <p>The shriek\
  \ was impressive.</p> \n    <p>When it sank into words again, they were a strangled,\
  \ \"Get <i>off</i> me, slave!\" </p> \n    <p>\"Certainly,\" Tantaerra snapped—\
  and drove the second to last of her poison-tipped darts through the palm of Sarpent's\
  \ descending hand.</p> \n    <p>Sarpent shrieked again, going wild.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Oh, be <i>quiet</i>,\" Tantaerra snarled, driving the last of her darts deep into\
  \ Sarpent's throat—and kicked her way free.</p> \n    <p>The arms-dealer went down,\
  \ staring at Tantaerra in horror and disbelief as she choked and gurgled on her\
  \ own blood. Yet already the poison was closing those terrified eyes.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Tantaerra was more interested in what she could see of the end room. It was\
  \ now an inferno of raging flame.</p> \n    <p>\"Ah,\" she panted, turning to burrow\
  \ through the stock on the nearest shelf behind her and so get clear of the barriers\
  \ and netting, \"<i>that</i> has become useful.\"</p> \n    <p>Sarpent dead, Garldrake\
  \ and the hired slayers all too asleep to escape the flames, their splendid business\
  \ burning down. Satisfactory work, indeed.</p> \n    <p>Of course, those weren't\
  \ the only people in the building. The ordinary staff she'd put to sleep were going\
  \ to need to be woken up. Fortunately, Tantaerra never used poison without also\
  \ bringing along the antidote, and there was a <i>wide</i> variety of sharp instruments\
  \ with which to deliver it.</p> \n    <p>Already the smoke was hiding the high ceilings\
  \ from view. Tantaerra sighed and sprinted for the stairs.</p> \n    <p>She was\
  \ two rooms away before she wondered which useful tools the Master might have left,\
  \ that she should fetch before the entire building burned down. </p> \n    <p>She\
  \ settled for stuffing a helm full of coins to pay for them, instead. Better to\
  \ save the people—but nobody said heroes had to work for free.</p> \n    <p align=\"\
  center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>When Master Argulk Hroalund cautiously opened the door,\
  \ three throwing knives at the ready in his free hand, an exhausted and bloody halfling\
  \ stood on his back doorstep.</p> \n    <p>Through the blood, she gave him a triumphant\
  \ grin. \"Your traps worked well.\"</p> \n    <p>Then she reeled and toppled.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Before his frantic grab could catch her, Tantaerra put a hand down to\
  \ the cobbles and flung herself into a somersault that brought her unsteadily to\
  \ her feet again.</p> \n    <p>Limping and wincing, Tantaerra handed her master\
  \ the coin-filled helm, and gave him a harder grin.</p> \n    <p>\"Bath,\" she said.\
  \ \"Something to drink.\"</p> \n    <p>They were not requests.</p> \n    <p>Her\
  \ Master smiled down at her. \"Of course.\"</p> \n    <p>She smiled back, and fell\
  \ into oblivion.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Like Tantaerra the plucky halfling?\
