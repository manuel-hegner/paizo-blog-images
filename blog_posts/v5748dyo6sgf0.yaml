  \ the veil on distant continents and lesser known cultures in the Inner Sea. As\
  \ stories of these travels filtered back and spread across northern Garund and Avistan,\
  \ tales of foreign gods came with them, piquing the interest of religious scholars.\
  \ Now, with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vao?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Faiths-of-Golarion\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i><i>Campaign Setting: Faiths of Golarion</i></a>, we're offering\
  \ up the details of some of these faiths, with a few hotly anticipated divinities\
  \ and notes from their authors:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ \n     <p>You know who isn't going to stand for your bullying? Chaldira Zuzaristan,\
  \ that's who. This halfling demigoddess jumps fist-first into tyrants and oppressors,\
  \ showing her followers how quick action, trust in luck, and faithful friends can\
  \ see you through any trouble. Chaldira's worshippers can rely on powers that bolster\
  \ their fortune and enable their light-hearted mischief. Sure, she's got a paladin\
  \ code, but when your paladin code includes \"It is my sacred duty to explore\"\
  \ and \"I know mischief brings joy,\" you know you'll have a character that can\
  \ find two fistfuls of trouble. My favorite part of writing Chaldira's entry was\
  \ bringing her attitude through in the writing, and into your game!</p> \n     <p>—\
  Ron Lundeen, Pathfinder Adventure Path Developer</p> \n     <p>I was excited to\
  \ add a deific creation of my own to this book. Kazutal, Arcadian goddess of community,\
  \ liberty, and safety, started in an office game run by James Jacobs. I was playing\
  \ a cleric and asked him if I could make up a deity from my notes on Arcadia. He\
  \ agreed, and I presented him with a short write up of Lady Jaguar (as I hadn't\
  \ fully decided on her real name at that point). I knew that she was different long\
  \ ago than she is now, and I wanted her faith to be concerned with protection and\
  \ the bonds of community. Playing a cleric of a god that had little lore to start\
  \ with was a great way to help build lore organically through play and interaction\
  \ with the other characters. (Fun fact: you can find an illustration of this cleric—\
  Xochitl—in the Segada chapter of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vao?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Faiths-of-Golarion\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Shores</i></a>.)</p> \n     <p>—Adam Daigle,\
  \ Pathfinder Managing Developer</p> \n     <p>So, I got to the write-up on Nivi\
  \ Rhombodazzle, which makes it hard to nail down one particular part that's my absolute\
  \ favorite. I mean, <i>the</i> gnome goddess, who is almost perfectly described\
  \ by Kenny Rogers in the song \"The Gambler\", what's not to like? But since I <i>have</i>\
  \ to choose something… I loved writing up Nivi's planar allies. While some of Nivi's\
  \ allies, like her sapient magical die Seven-Eyes, had already been briefly mentioned\
  \ in previous works, it was still fun to build out the details of these figures\
  \ that represent some important aspects of Nivi's personality. Maybe I'm a bit too\
  \ fond of talking animals (I <i>did </i>read the entire Chronicles of Narnia at\
  \ least a dozen times as a kid) but I also had to add the earth elemental Rummbrrlar,\
  \ in no small part because I want to use him in a Pathfinder Society scenario at\
  \ some point. A powerful elder earth elemental who spends most of its time in the\
  \ shape of a mole made out of diamond, riding around in adventurer's backpacks dispensing\
  \ sage advice that would have been most useful about five minutes earlier, just\
  \ leapt out at me as the kind of individual Nivi would take a special liking to.\
  \ I hope everyone else who loves Nivi as much as I do finds something worthwhile\
  \ in this article, and that you all have some fun bringing Nivi's faith and lore\
  \ into your Pathfinder games. I know I did!</p> \n     <p>—Michael Sayre, Organized\
  \ Play Developer</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/20181207-Tsukiyo.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p>Much as the Glory domain's mechanics lend themselves to good-aligned\
  \ deities, the Madness domain seemed nearly exclusive to evil divinities in early\
  \ Pathfinder. This style of madness hearkened to the slavering beasts, wild psychopathy,\
  \ or sinister misanthropy presented in many scary movies. A few years later I read\
  \ about Tsukiyo in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy8pfu\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Dragon Empires Gazetteer</i></a>, and I reread it in puzzlement\
  \ for a while. Lawful good madness? How could this be?</p> \n     <p>The more I\
  \ considered him, though, the more I understood what might have happened. Tsukiyo's\
  \ story is similar to that of Osiris in Egyptian mythology: killed by a jealous\
  \ rival, mourned by his lover, pieced together by divine mysteries, and brought\
  \ back to life. Whereas Osiris changed in body (having been embalmed in some versions),\
  \ Tsukiyo had changed mentally. His love for Shizuru had not dimmed, nor had his\
  \ power diminished; however, he was shy, reserved, and seemed to process the world\
  \ around himself in a strange way, puzzling his bold and boisterous peers. Yet Tsukiyo\
  \ overflows with compassion for mortals, especially those whom societies deem insane.\
  \ He doesn't have the Madness domain because he revels in inflicting psychological\
  \ distress. He has that domain because he defends, comforts, and above all understands\
  \ the neurodivergent. Creating the codes for his priests and paladins was an absolute\
  \ pleasure, as was working with Liane Merciel (author of the Shizuru article) to\
  \ describe his difficult yet utterly devoted romance with Shizuru.</p> \n     <p>—\
  John Compton, Organized Play Lead<!--/\r\n  \r\n</blockquote--> </p>\n     <p>Some\
  \ of my other favorites include Grandmother Spider, Achaekek's little sister, who\
  \ much like younger siblings everywhere likes to play pranks on her big brother…\
  \ as well as everyone else! In fact, she even managed to steal and copy Asmodeus'\
  \ keys, an embarrassment that the Dark Prince hates other people knowing about.\
  \ There's also Gruhastha, whose beautiful features were cited by a coworker as \"\
  one way to get people interested in reading.\" A former mortal, Gruhastha really\
  \ put himself into his writing—so much so, that he actually became one with the\
  \ text. I'm sure other authors can sometimes relate.</p> \n     <p>Eleanor Ferron<br>\
