  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">This time of year it’s easy for the Pathfinder\
  \ Society team to focus so hard on the major conventions (all of the adventures\
  \ for PaizoCon and Gen Con in particular) that we can lose sight of the smaller\
  \ events. These might not have the same reach and exposure as the big names, but\
  \ they’re all stronger in how they bring the community—both the players and the\
  \ public—together. Venture-Captain Mike Bramnik of Bloomington, Indiana recently\
  \ contacted me with an after-event report for the Convention of Stonekeep, which\
  \ did exactly that. Let’s read it in his words.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n     \
  \ <p>Being the Venture-Captain for a Pathfinder Society lodge in a college town\
  \ is usually quite predictable. You know what times of year to expect to run lots\
  \ of introductory scenarios and quests, and when to plan for lulls in attendance.\
  \ Something that you would never be able to foresee, however, is just how awesome\
  \ and generous your lodge can turn out to be when given a challenge.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Our lodge here in Bloomington, Indiana boasts several current and former employees\
  \ of a nonprofit facility called Stone Belt, as well as friends and family of clients\
  \ who utilize the services. Stone Belt is a charitable organization dedicated to\
  \ helping adults with physical and developmental disabilities. They provide a number\
  \ of services from home care to employment services and even pass the charity on\
  \ to others in need. When one of our local players who works in special education\
  \ suggested teaming up with Stone Belt to have fun and give back to our local community,\
  \ things came together in a really amazing way.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Ducky the Goblin to Lori (Stone Belt's Director of Development),<br> and a \"\
  thank you\" card from several of Stone Belt's clients.</i>\n      </div> \n    \
  \  <p>As a challenge to our players, many of who wanted to experience a local-level\
  \ convention before \"con season\" got into high gear (culminating at Gen Con next\
  \ month!), we decided to create an event with all of the \"hardest\" scenarios available—\
  an event we called the \"Convention at Stonekeep.\" We offered all three Ruins of\
  \ Bonekeep adventures, every scenario with a hard mode option, and a few other scenarios\
  \ with deadly reputations. In addition, we held a charity auction with prizes donated\
  \ by several local GMs, Sean K. Reynolds, and two local businesses (Common Room\
  \ Games and That's The Rub Massage Therapy Center), as well as having our lodge's\
  \ aspiring authors create two new unofficial adventures using PFS rules—one for\
  \ the Adventure Card Game and the other for the Roleplaying Game—partially integrated\
  \ with each other as well.</p> \n      <p>Two tables for the ACG adventure (written\
  \ by Michael Johnson and me) assembled on their ships to bravely escort the PCs\
  \ for the RPG scenario to their destination: the center of the Eye of Abendego.\
  \ Once there, three tables of level 7th-level pregenerated PCs faced \"The All-Seeing\
  \ Eye of Abendego,\" written by Alex Ducey, Joe Ducey, and Justin McNeely. The convention\
  \ was a nice-sized event, with 17 tables of PFS in addition to the 5 charity tables\
  \ and charity auction over 2.5 days—part of which was a live auction held during\
  \ the middle of Race for the Runecarved Key right before the PCs for the Season\
  \ 4 Special went to the auction themselves!</p> \n      <p>Thanks to the generosity\
  \ of our players, we were able to purchase $800 of equipment for Stone Belt's Lifelong\
  \ Learning program, including mobility scooters, a variety of headphones, jump ropes,\
  \ bubble machines, and over 30 lbs of kinetic \"moon sand\"—in addition to a Paizo\
  \ goblin plushie immediately named \"Ducky!\" by one of Stone Belt's clients! Overall,\
  \ our event was a smashing success, and our lodge is now looking forward to partnering\
  \ with Stone Belt and possibly other organizations like it on an annual basis so\
  \ we can continue to share the fun of being part of the Pathfinder Society as well\
  \ as give back to our community that has produced so many amazing and kind people\
  \ who are part of our lodge!</p> \n      <p>Mike Bramnik<br> <i>Venture-Captain—\
  Bloomington, Indiana</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Thank you Mike, Stone\
  \ Belt, and the Bloomington lodge for your hard work!</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br>\
